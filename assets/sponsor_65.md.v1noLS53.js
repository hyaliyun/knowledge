The corps artillery headquarters for the Kentucky Army National Guard had been formed in 1953 due to the quantity of field artillery battalions in the state and given the designation of XXIII Corps Artillery, although the corresponding corps headquarters did not exist.

S. Federal Census, 1900. Oliver was an only child, never married, and lived with his father in East Boston until 1942, when they moved to Chelsea. He returned to East Boston after his father's death in 1947 and remained there for the rest of his life.

Story's early pieces and publications were collaborations with Peter H. (‚ÄúHappy‚Äù) O‚ÄôNeil.

The following year Oliver E. Story opened his own publishing firm, with offices at 218 Tremont Street, the heart of Boston's music district.The Boston Directory (Boston: Sampson & Murdock Company), 1913. He issued over fifty titles from 1913 through 1917, including more than a dozen of his own compositions.Catalog of Copyright Entries ...

Noteworthy early songs included ‚ÄúThanks for the Lobster‚Äù and ‚ÄúA Hundred Years from Now,‚Äù the latter co-composed with James A. Brennan. Caddigan, Story, and Brennan created the bulk of titles published by Story's firm. During this period Story was also active as a pianist and singer, appearing at events from political rallies to vaudeville.

Story's publishing offices closed in 1917, and in 1918 Oliver was employed in the Boston office of Leo Feist. Caddigan and Story published a few songs with Boston publishers (Billy Lang, D. W. Cooper) and then released ‚ÄúSalvation Lassie of Mine,‚Äù a popular postwar number, with Feist.Catalog of Copyright Entries ...

Story continued to list himself as a ‚Äúmusician‚Äù in Boston City Directories, and he appeared irregularly in Boston papers as a pianist and as director of amateur theatricals. In the 1940s he appeared in restaurants and clubs, performing ‚Äúsongs of yesteryear.‚ÄùSee, for instance, The Boston Daily Globe, April 15, 1925, p. A5; June 20, 1933, p. 4; May 25, 1946, p. 12.

Ticul, along with Mama and Maxcan√∫ are traditional pottery centers for the state, where pieces are made using a k¬¥abal, a rudimentary form of pottery wheel. The pieces are decorated using implements that they make themselves from branches, leather, gourds and feathers. The partners have worked together for many years as the ‚ÄúArte Maya‚Äù workshop, which was formerly directed by Wilbert Gonzalez before he died. The two learned the craft together here, producing cups, storage boxes, cantaros, vases and decorative figures, inspired by the old gods and sacred animals and myths of the Maya. Their pieces are principally made on the k‚Äôabal, which they turn with their feet, either using the coil method or forming the piece from a single ball of clay. Chan is the more versatile of the two, making everything from utilitarian pieces to reproduction of Jaina figures, the latter made with special molds along with modeling. Juarez specializes in creating plates and containers with Mayan inspired designs, creating using tones of red and yellow clay slips, which are burnished before firing. Firing is done in kilns they have constructed, which contain a type of ventilation unique to the pottery of the region along with the use of a grill to keep pieces from being stained by the burning wood. After firing some pieces are further decorated with vinyl paints and others are left in natural clay tones, which can include a type of blue associated with the ancient Mayans.

It is known by the English common names pearl oyster, Mazatlan pearl oyster, and Panama pearl oyster. Spanish common names include madre perla, and ostra perlifera paname√±a. This mollusc was first described to science in 1856 by conchologist Sylvannus Charles Thorp Hanley. Pinctada mazatlanica produces gem-quality pearls and was the basis of a pearling industry in the Gulf of California for centuries.  Description  Pinctada mazatlanica in life, photographed in the Gulf of California Valves are shallow, attaining a maximum length of 20 cm (8 inches). They are generally round with minimal, if any, wing-like extensions on the hinge margin which are found in other species of its family. In life, the shell has a shaggy periostracum, or skin-like coating. The exterior of the valves is grayish-brown and scaly. The interior is brilliantly nacreous, iridescent mother-of-pearl.  Distribution  Pinctada mazatlanica is found in the eastern Pacific Ocean from Baja California Sur to Peru, including the Gulf of California. It is also widespread in the Galapagos Islands. These pearl oysters live in shallow water from 3 to 30 meters (4 to 99 feet) deep on coral reefs and rocky bottoms.  Life history  Pearl oysters begin life as males. When they reach approximately 100 mm (4 inches), they transform into females, a process known as protandrous hermaphroditism. They reproduce by broadcast spawning, releasing sperm and eggs into the sea to achieve fertilization. In the Gulf of California, spawning takes place in September. The fertilized egg develops into a free-swimming veliger which feeds on smaller plankton. At roughly three weeks after fertilization, the veliger becomes a pediveliger. At this stage of development, the animal is approximately 0.2 mm in diameter and has a foot which allows it to crawl on the seabed. In response to some unknown environmental cue, the pediveliger attaches itself to the seabed with a byssus and grows into adulthood at that spot. Pearls form naturally in approximately 5% of this species pearl oysters. A male and female pair of the shrimp Pontonia pinnae is often found dwelling inside the live shells. History This oyster along with the Pacific wing-oyster (Pteria sterna) was the subject of a pearl fishery in the Gulf of California since before the arrival of Hernando Cortez in 1535. The Spaniards quickly appreciated the value of the harvest and in 1586 declared the gathering of oysters to be a right of the Spanish crown. By the 1840s, the export of the shells was as valuable as the pearls extracted from them; the nacreous shells were used to make mother-of- pearl buttons for clothing. In 1874, compressed air diving equipment made harvesting the oysters easier. By the early 1900s, some 200,000 to 500,000 oysters were being harvested annually. This over-exploitation caused populations of both species of oyster to become depleted and in 1940 the fishery was closed by the Mexican Government, a ban that still remains in force. The Gulf of California pearl industry was the basis of John Steinbeck's novella, The Pearl, published in 1947.

Summary In the first part of the book, the author uses research to demonstrate social intuitionism, how people's beliefs come primarily from their intuitions, and rational thought often comes after to justify initial beliefs. He cites David Hume and E. O. Wilson as thinkers who gave reason a relatively low estimation, as opposed to more popular thinkers who give reason a central place in moral cognition, such as Lawrence Kohlberg and his stages of moral reasoning. In the second portion of the book, he presents moral foundations theory, and applies it to the political beliefs of liberals, conservatives, and libertarians in the US. Haidt argues that people are too quick to denigrate other points of view without giving those views full consideration, and attempts to reach common ground between liberals and conservatives. He makes the case in the book for morality having multiple foundations (more than just harm and fairness), and said in an interview that morality \\"is at least six things, and probably a lot more than that\\" and \\"[religion and politics are]‚Ä¶expressions of our tribal, groupish, righteous nature.\\" Haidt himself acknowledges that while he has been a liberal all his life, he is now more open to other points of view. In the third part of the book, Haidt describes a hypothetical \\"hive switch,\\" which turns a selfish human \\"chimp\\" into a \\"groupish\\" human \\"bee.\\" Cultures and organizations have techniques for getting people to identify with their groups, such as dancing, moving, and singing in unison.

The book received two reviews in The Guardian: Ian Birrell called the book a \\"compelling study of the morality of those on the left and right [that] reaches some surprising conclusions;\\" and Nicholas Lezard wrote that he was \\"in the odd position of being wary of a book I am also recommending.

In an expanded version of an academic review, social psychologist John Jost wrote that \\"Haidt's book is creative, interesting, and provocative.... The book shines a new light on moral psychology and presents a bold, confrontational message. From a scientific perspective, however, I worry that his theory raises more questions than it answers.\\" Jost criticized Haidt for what he perceived as showing more empathy for why conservatives hold their views than for why liberals do, and said Haidt \\"mocks the liberal vision of a tolerant, pluralistic, civil society, but, ironically, this is precisely where he wants to end up.\\"  Academic reviews   * * See also * Big Five personality traits * Evolutionary psychology * Moral psychology ReferencesExternal links * * TED Talk: The Moral Roots of Liberals and Conservatives Category:2012 non-fiction books Category:Books about evolutionary psychology Category:Books about social psychology Category:Books about the politics of science Category:Books in political philosophy Category:Contemporary philosophical literature Category:English-language books Category:Moral psychology books Category:Political philosophy literature Category:Works by Jonathan Haidt ","title":"The Righteous Mind"},{"id":"41945300","text":"Flowers in a terracotta vase, collection National Gallery, London Marie Blancour (active 1650 - 1699), was a 17th-century French painter.

She uses techniques of painting, performance, sculpture, publishing, geometrics, abstraction, video/audio, and textiles to explore questions of body and identity politics and interrupt and criticize the gender binaries. For instance, for her exhibition Raw/Cooked at the Brooklyn Museum in 2012, M√ºller invited a range of feminist and queer artists, including Nicole Eisenman, A.L. Steiner and Amy Sillman to create two-dimensional renderings of t-shirt quotes taken from the Lesbian Herstory Archives in Brooklyn. Ulrike M√ºller currently teaches painting at the Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts at Bard College. Previously, she was on the faculty for the Vermont College of Fine Arts‚Äô low- residency MFA in Visual Arts program, and has lectured in painting/printmaking at Yale University since 2013.Yale.edu bio on Ulrike M√ºller  Themes  M√ºller‚Äôs art typically uses abstraction to play with representation with the intention of combine social and individual experiences as well as to blur the connection between the artist and the viewer. She strives to disrupt traditional gender norms and suggest alternatives through her feminist lens. M√ºller‚Äôs paintings are largely influenced by geometric abstraction to create an intimate relationship between color and shape. Through her paintings, she examines how color and shape can express ideas of representation, identity, and body. M√ºller strives for radical feminism, placing her work outside the usual scope of abstract and geometric painting, creating links between form, social context, and identity.  Herstory Inventory  Herstory Inventory an exhibition in the Brooklyn Museum's series Raw/Cookedwas meant to revise and respond to the feminist work The Dinner Party by Judy Chicago in 1974‚Äì79. The Dinner Party displayed a series of photographic panels to bring recognition to minority pieces of art. M√ºller transformed this idea, involving feminist and queer artists to take quotations from T-Shirts from the Lesbian Herstory Archives and create 2D objects. Herstory is history written from a feminist perspective, emphasizing the role of women, or told from a woman's point of view. Raw/Cooked had a variety of results, but all involved the relationship between abstraction and representation. The project was successful in its focus on the diverse artists‚Äô agencies.  And Then Some  And Then Some is M√ºller‚Äôs most recent concluded solo project with Callicoon Fine Arts. The exhibition ran from 15 September to 30 October 2016. And Then Some involved paper and oil paintings contextualized with rugs and enamel designs. M√ºller aimed to explore and combine the contexts of different mediums and materials. Using a wall painting the grey color of the floor, she forces viewers to question their own perception of space and objects. And Then Some explores how these perceptions of space and objects are created or suggested even without a recognized identity. M√ºller expands this idea to gender, expressing how different elements of objects suggest certain knowledge or identities surrounding gender. For example, there is one piece made of enamel - a typically industrial material - that acts as a mirror to the viewer, convincing them to question such ideas about the medium.  LTTR  LTTR is a feminist genderqueer collective with a flexible project oriented practice. Its aim is to celebrate different forms of feminist art and unite people together. M√ºller joined in 2005 and has been actively involved both as an individual and a collective artist. She helps in editing the journal and organizing different events and exhibitions. Others involved with LTTR are Ginger Brooks Takahashi, K8 Hardy and Emily Roysdon, and Lanka Tattersal.  Recognition  M√ºller is recognized for her efforts to revise outdated ideas of representation and expression in feminism. She is renowned for her various exhibitions that strive to give minority artists agency in their goal to break rules of patriarchy. She is also known for using her mediums to their absolute potential to build on ideas of the body and its connection to the world. The artistic public values M√ºller‚Äôs revisiting of modernist abstraction and how she transforms it, forcing it to represent themes of the outside world such as the gendered body. Her use of subtlety and historical revisionism allows her to reconsider art history and feminist history and how they influence and represent the modern world.

He was a member of the Greek Parliament from 1989 to 2004 for the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PA.SO.K). In May 2013 he founded the political party Drachmi Greek Democratic Movement Five Stars, which campaigns for Greece to abandon the euro and return to the drachma.  Biography  Katsanevas received his degree from the University of Piraeus. He obtained an MA from the University of Warwick and a PhD from the London School of Economics. He was Professor of labour economics at the University of Piraeus. In 1981, he was among the authors of the program for the First Cabinet of Andreas Papandreou and he was first appointed to the Manpower Employment Organisation (OAED, ), then in 1985 to the welfare state agency. He was elected deputy in the second electoral district of Athens with PASOK from 1989 until 2004, when he was officially restricted from standing as a candidate by the party itself. Economist Stavros Thomadakis called Katsanevas's 1984 book, Trade Unions in Greece \\"an important contribution to the systematic examination of the Greek labor union movement.\\" As early as 2011, Katsanevas, as well as some other Greek economists, advocated for Greece abandoning the euro and returning to its former national currency, the drachma, as a response to the Greek government-debt crisis. In 2013 he went on to found Drachmi Greek Democratic Movement Five Stars, a Greek political party advocating such currency change.

Papandreou's four children objected to their father's will, in which he left his entire estate to his third wife, former airline hostess Dimitra Liani. Papandreou's relationship with Liani had been a source of controversy during his last years in public office, when his health was failing. He had placed Liani in charge of his office, and opponents of Papandreou alleged that she was overstepping the bounds of her authority and seeking to advance a political career of her own. Liani became the subject of unfavourable news media attention, including publication, by the newspaper Avriani (which for many years supported Papandreou) of old photographs that showed her naked with men and other women. These photographs were immediately denounced as \\"crude photo-montage\\" and Liani accused Katsanevas of orchestrating the publicity against her; Papandreou supported her, seeking unsuccessfully to convince his three sons to ostracize their brother-in-law. Theodore Katsanevas disputes the validity of the will and in 2003 won a defamation trial against Spyros Karatzaferis, publisher of a newspaper which for some time in 1998 featured, every day on the front page, a photograph of Katsanevas subtitled \\"Disgrace\\". However, the judgement in the case did not address the authenticity of the will. As a result of this matter being described in Katsanevas's biography in the Greek Wikipedia, he brought a lawsuit against a Greek Wikipedia user and administrator known by the user name \\"Diu\\", and the Greek Free/Open Source Software Society (\\"GFOSS\\", aka \\"EELLAK\\"), although neither has any control over the Wikipedia. The judge temporarily ordered the administrator to remove the information from Wikipedia. The administrator complied, but the information was soon replaced by another editor. The temporary court order was reversed on 1 September 2014,Decision of Athens First Degree Court #9118/2014 while the main trial was still pending. The administrator noted that the lawsuit and publicity had produced a Streisand effect and that the original Greek article was now hosted in translation on multiple Wikipedias in English, Catalan, Polish, Yakut, French, German, Dutch, Spanish and Italian. The Wikimedia Foundation financially supported this Wikipedia user subject to defamation lawsuit in Greece.

Background Formed in 2006, the band derived its name from the Wilco song, ‚ÄúI Am Trying to Break Your Heart,‚Äù and is led by band founder and lead vocalist/ guitarist BJ Barham. A new lineup was announced in April 2017 with new faces joining the ranks: Crooks drummer Joey Bybee, Damn Quails bass player Ben Hussey and guitarist Shane Boeker ‚Äì all from Texas ‚Äì along with Nashville pedal-steel player Adam Kurtz, who also fronts Music City's experimental Buck Owens tribute Buck N' Stuff. Bybee left in August 2018 and was replaced by Nashville-based drummer Matty Alger, who in turn left in February 2019. Kurtz left the band after the Mile Zero fest in January 2019, and Hussey left in July 2019. American Aquarium has released seven albums, including their most critically acclaimed album to date, 2012‚Äôs Burn. Flicker. Die.. According to American Songwriter, 'It‚Äôs a record for anyone who creates art, even if recognition and a stable living may never come of it\\". Their first album, Antique Hearts, was released in 2006, followed by The Bible and the Bottle in 2008. The band continued to tour extensively, playing around 250 shows a year. They began building a wider and more varied fan base beyond their native state. Their sophomore effort received some critical attention, and that same year the band released the minimalist live EP Bones, recorded in a friend‚Äôs living room. Barham wrote the songs in the wake of a break-up, helping to cement a familiar theme of women who either got away or did the protagonist wrong. Their next album was Dances for the Lonely. Released by Last Chance Records in 2009,it featured one of their fan favorites, ‚ÄúI Hope He Breaks Your Heart.‚Äù Small Town Hymns, released in 2010, brought more favorable reviews and continued comparisons to Bruce Springsteen, Whiskeytown, and Lucero. In 2012, American Aquarium released two albums: Live in Raleigh and Burn. Flicker. Die., which garnered considerable praise from music critics and fans. Produced by Jason Isbell, formerly of Drive By Truckers, the album was originally intended to be the band‚Äôs last, but they now have no plans for retirement. Barham says,\\"It's kind of ironic that the record about not making it is the record that helped us make it.\\" \\"Throughout, the music crackles and snarls with a raw viscerality that carries distinct echoes of the Drive-By Truckers and early-seventies Rolling Stones‚Äîboozy, swaggering closing track ‚ÄúSaturday Nights‚Äù even sports a signature crunch-riff that‚Äôd put a big smile on Keith Richards‚Äô face.\\" Burn. Flicker. Die. was nominated for \\"Best Americana/Roots Album‚Äù and ‚ÄúBest Album Artwork‚Äù in the 2013 Lone Star Music Awards. The band released their sixth original album, Wolves, in February 2015. The band's fans helped raise $24,000 through a Kickstarter project to help fund the album's production, and the album was recorded in Asheville, North Carolina at Echo Mountain. On November 25, 2016 \\"Live at Terminal West\\" was released by the band from a live show recording in November 2015 at Terminal West in Atlanta, Georgia.

To measure gender diversity on corporate boards, studies often use the percentage of women holding corporate board seats and the percentage of companies with at least one woman on their board. Globally, men occupy more board seats than women. , women held 20.8% of the board seats on Russell 1000 companies (up from 17.9% in 2015)..https://www.vell.com/images/pdf/VELL%20Report%20Women%20Board%20Members%20on%20Tech%20Boards%202017%203%2029.pdf The reasons behind the disproportionate gender ratio of directors is a subject of much debate. A survey of more than 4000 directors found that male directors over the age of 55 cited a lack of qualified female candidates as the main reason behind the stagnant number of female directors. In contrast, in the same study, female directors and younger male directors considered the male- dominated networking that often led to the appointment of directors to be the reason behind women's slow progress. Given that gender diversity on boards is an issue rooted in the principle of equality of treatment, inequality in gender representation on boards can be combatted through equality of opportunity reforms, equality of outcome reforms, or spread of information on gender bias. Governments and corporations have attempted to address the disproportionality of gender representation on corporate boards through both types of reform measures, including legislation mandating gender quotas (a reform based on the principle of equality of outcome) and comply or explain guidelines (a reform based on the principle of equality of opportunity).  History  The Lettie Pate Whitehead Foundation asserts that Lettie Pate Whitehead was one of the first female directors of a prominent company. She was a member of the board of the Coca-Cola Company from 1934. A survey of Fortune 250 companies in 2012, however, found the first female director of the surveyed companies to be Clara Abbott, a director of Abbott Laboratories from 1900. The survey also found that the average first year of appointing a company's first female director was 1985. In 2001, Sarah Hogg, Viscountess Hailsham, became the first woman to chair a FTSE 100 company. Katharine Graham, previously the chairwoman of the board of The Post Co., was the first female Fortune 500 CEO in 1972. Ursula Burns, the Chairman and CEO of Xerox, was the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company.  Rationale behind gender diversity on corporate boards  The desire to achieve proportionate gender representation on corporate boards is derived from the principle of equality of treatment. Equality of treatment requires comparable situations to be treated in the same manner and prohibits direct and indirect discrimination. Equality of treatment refers to either equality of opportunity or equality of outcome. Equality of opportunity requires providing everyone with the same opportunity to attain what they desire. Equality of outcome requires every individual to possess an equal share of outcomes such as goods or positions. The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women requires states that have ratified the Convention to guarantee the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms to women on an equal basis to men. Further, achieving gender equality, including in economic decision-making processes, is one of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. Many countries have also opted to pursue this principle through their constitution or through various forms of legislation. For example, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which guarantees equality rights, including gender equality, and the Equality Act 2010 in the United Kingdom which protects against discrimination based on sex. In the United States, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination against employees on the basis of sex.  Determinants of gender diversity on corporate boards  Boardroom A number of studies have been conducted to determine the type of companies that are more likely to have female directors on their boards. A study on Spanish small and medium-sized enterprises found that firm performance increases the probability of having a female director. The same study also found that higher corporate ownership and firm risk led to a lower probability of having a female presence on a company's board. A survey of UK companies found larger companies to be more likely to have a higher proportion of female directors. The findings regarding firm size and corporate risk are consistent with a study conducted on 1002 companies across Brazil, Russia, India, China, the UK and USA. Masayuki Morikawa conducted a study that focused on Japanese companies and found that the probability of having a female director increased for companies that are managed by the owners of the companies, but decreased for public companies and older companies.  Impact  Numerous studies have been undertaken on the effects of gender diversity on company boards with mixed results. In exploring the relationship between female directors and firm performance, Corinne Post and Kris Byron argue that differences in cognitive functions and values between the genders should influence firm performance and a board's decision making process. Another study by Nada K. Kakabadse et al. suggest that a diverse board will expand the board access to resources and networks, either from the directors' personal connections or simply by being a symbol through their position as a female director. The theory that gender diversity on corporate boards is of value is further strengthened by a study of 127 Malaysian firms that found stock markets react in a positive manner to the appointment of female directors. An analysis of the effects of greater female representation in the boards of directors of Iraqi companies by Farhan and Nayan found a \\"positive and significant\\" relationship between female directors and firm performance, as measured by return on assets. The study's authors stated that the important policy implication of their findings is that companies on the Iraqi stock exchange and security commission should incorporate gender diversity in their corporate governance practices. The study by Corinne Post and Kris Byron using results from 140 studies found that the presence of female directors on a corporate board has a positive correlation with accounting returns and monitoring and strategizing tasks. However, the study concluded that there is no significant relationship between female directors and market performance, possibly due to a variations in the female director/firm performance relationship between countries with different levels of gender equality. The relationship was found to be positive in those with gender equality and negative in those less gender equality. A study on nonfinancial Spanish small and medium-sized enterprises found a positive relationship between female directors and firm performance using return of assets as a measure of firm performance. Further, a survey of 6500 company boards revealed that an increase in participation by female directors reduces the firm's chances of becoming embroiled in corporate governance issues. A study of S&P; 1500 companies by Maurice Levi, Kai Li and Feng Zhang found companies with female directors to be less likely to acquire other companies and to pay less bid premium if an acquisition occurs. Another study, conducted by Gennaro Bernile, Vineet Bhagwat, and Scott Yonker in 2017, found that \\"board diversity [was] associated with lower realized firm risk.\\" The study further noted that \\"both operating performance and asset valuation multiples increase with board diversity.\\" In addition, firms with more diverse boards tended to pay higher dividends, pursue less risky financial policies, and invest more in research and development. The findings of this study were not exclusively positive, however. The study authors found that greater diversity was not always beneficial to firm performance when overall volatility was high. They posited that because diverse boards can endure longer decision-making processes, they can fail to respond rapidly when a quick decision is necessary. Other studies have found no evidence of a positive relationship between gender diversity and firm performance. A study by Ian Gregory-Smith, Brian G.M. Main and Charles A. O'Reilly III on companies listed on the FTSE 350 found no significant relationship between having a female director and company performance as measured by shareholder return, return on assets, return on equity and price to book ratio. In an interview with 45 corporate insiders, Lissa Broome, John Conley and Kimberly Krawiec found that insiders have difficulty with isolating the particular manner in which female directors contribute solely on the basis of their gender. Further, in the context of emerging economies, the study on Malaysian firms found gender diversity to have a negative effect on firm value in government owned companies, suggesting that the relationship between female directors and firm value might vary across company types. Another study on 30 companies with female directors in the United Kingdom, United States and Ghana found that having a minority female board representation does not affect board performance. This is in line with previous research based on 50 female directors that concluded at least 3 female directors is required to improve a company's corporate governance. According to a 2019 study in The Review of Economic Studies, Norway's gender quota \\"had very little discernible impact on women in business beyond its direct effect on the women who made it into boardrooms.\\" According to a 2019 study in the journal Electoral Studies, Norway's adoption of the gender quota did not have a spillover on politics. It did not lead to greater political representation among women.  Current landscape = Percentage of women holding corporate board seats  As of March 2018, 27.1% of board seats of companies on the Australian S&P;/ASX 200 index are held by women. In Hong Kong and India, women hold 10.2% and 9.5% of board seats of the Hang Seng Index and BSE 200 index respectively. Women in Japan hold 3.1% of board seats on companies in the TOPIX Core 30 Index. The proportion of board seats held by women in Europe varies significantly. In the Scandinavian countries, Norway leads the way with 35.5% of board seats of the companies in the OBX index held by women. Finland is in second place with women holding 29.9% of board seats on the companies in the OMX Helsinki 25 index. In Sweden, 28.8% of board seats of the companies in the OMX Stockholm 30 index are held by women. Women also hold 21.9% of board seats of the companies on the OMX Copenhagen 20 index in Denmark. In France and Germany, women hold 29.7% and 18.5% of board seats of companies on the CAC 40 index and the DAX index respectively. In the United Kingdom, among the companies in the FTSE 100 index, women hold 22.8% of board seats. At the other end of the scale, women hold only 10.3% of board seats in Ireland and 7.9% in Portugal. In Canada, women hold 20.8% of board seats on companies in the S&P;/TSX 60 index. In the United States of America, women hold 19.2% of board seats on companies in the S&P; 500 index. In Latin America, only 6.4% of board seats of the 100 largest companies in the region are held by women. Colombia has the highest percentage of female board seats in Latin America with 13.4%. Brazil has the second highest with 6.3%. Chile shows a percentage of female on board equal to 7%. In Africa, a survey of 307 listed companies across 12 African nations found that women hold 12.7% of board seats. Kenya has the largest female board representation of 19.8%, South Africa has 17.4% and Botswana has 16.9%. On the other end, C√¥te d'Ivoire has the lowest female board representation of 5.1%. Although, women hold 17.9% of the board seats on Fortune 1000 companies, female board representation varies between industry sectors. In Germany, women consisted of 8% of executive board members of the largest banks in Germany despite holding 18.5% of board seats across industries.  Percentage of companies with at least one female director  As of August 2015, 2% of S&P; 500 companies had all male boards of directors. This is a marked improvement from 2005, when 12% of S&P; companies had all male boards of directors. All FTSE 100 firms have female directors. The 2014 Catalyst Census found that 26.2% of S&P; 500 companies had 24% or more female directors. In Canada, 36.7% of S&P;/TSX60 Companies has 25% or more female directors. 53 of the 100 largest companies in Latin America have at least one female director. In Africa, 67.1% of 307 listed companies across 12 African nations surveyed had at least 1 female director. 33.6% of the companies only have 1 female director.  Encouraging gender diversity on corporate boards = Gender quotas  One approach taken by governments to achieve gender equality on corporate boards has been to enact legislation requiring a set quota of female representation on corporate boards. The quota system typifies an equality of outcome approach, which is concerned with the result rather than the means of achieving such a result. Belgium, France, Germany, Iceland, India, Israel, Italy, Norway, Pakistan and Spain currently have legislated quotas for women on corporate boards of publicly listed companies. A study on 10 countries with gender quotas and 15 countries with comply and explain systems found that countries that adopt gender quotas tend to have several pre-conditions: female labor market and gendered welfare state provisions, left-leaning political government coalitions, and path dependent policy initiatives for gender equality, both in the public realm as well as in the corporate domain. = Asia Pacific = In India, the Companies' Act of 2013 imposes a quota of at least one female director on the board of listed companies and any public company having a paid-up share capital of 100 crore or more rupees or a turnover of 300 crore or more rupees. In Australia, the ASX Corporate Governance Council announced proposed amendments to its guidelines to include a 30% quota in April 2018. Compliance is enforced only on a 'if not, why not' basis. In 2015, the Australian Institute of Company Directors had introduced the same quota as a recommendation. In Pakistan, the Corporate Governance Code implemented under the Companies Act of 2017 imposes a requirement on all public interest companies to have at least one woman director within three years. = Europe = In 2006, the Norwegian government introduced quota legislation that required both public and state owned companies to have 40% female board representation by 2008. Failure to comply resulted in fines or company closures. Full compliance was achieved by 2009. The percentage of female board members has since remained between 36% and 40%.UK Department for Business, Innovation & Skills, Women on Boards (UK: Department for Business, 2011) at 22, online: GOV.UK Iceland and Spain have introduced legislation requiring 40% of female board representation on publicly traded companies. Finland requires 40% of state owned enterprises to have female directors for 40% of their board seats. The Netherlands requires public companies with more than 250 employees to have female directors for 30% of the board seats. In France, a bill was passed in 2011 requiring 40% female directorship by 2016. This quota is to be implemented on two schedules, one for private companies and one for public companies. Public companies will require 20% female board representation within three years, and 40% within six years. Private companies will have nine years to reach the 40% quota. Failure to comply with these schedules will result in voided nominations and suspended remuneration of board members. Italy requires public companies to have 33% of either underrepresented gender. Belgium passed a law requiring 33% female directorship by 2018. Failure to comply with these schedules will result in voided nominations and suspended remuneration of board members. = Middle East = In 1999, Israel legislated a gender quota requiring one female board director for publicly traded companies. = North America = Quebec's Bill 53, passed in 2006, is the only provincial legislation currently in effect in Canada that deals with gender representation on corporate boards. This bill requires an equal number of men and woman on the boards of Crown corporations.Bill 53, An Act respecting the governance of state-owned enterprises and amending various legislative provisions, 2nd Sess, 37th Leg, Quebec, 2006, cl 43(2) (assented to 14 December 2006), SQ 2006, c 59. California passed a quota law in October 2018, for women on boards of companies headquartered in California, with deadlines in 2019 (for two women on five-person boards) and 2021 (for three women on seven-person boards). It is expected to be challenged as unconstitutional on grounds it violates equal protection.California Becomes 1st State To Require Women On Corporate Boards = Impact and criticism of gender quotas = The use of gender quotas as a mean of rectifying disproportionate gender representation on corporate boards has been controversial. Many studies have found gender quotas to be beneficial, including through its positive impact on the appointment of a female board chair and a female CEO. A 2016 study of more than 21,000 companies in 91 countries showed that firms with at least 30% women in the c-suite are more profitable.\\"Huge study finds that companies with more women leaders are more profitable,\\" Quartz, 8 February 2016. The original study was Marcus Noland, Tyler Moran, and Barbara Kotschwar, \\"Is Gender Diversity Profitable? Evidence from a Global Survey,\\" 2016, Petersen Institute for International Economics. An earlier report discovered that Fortune-500 companies with the most female directors reported greater return on sales and equity.\\"The Bottom Line: Corporate Performance and Women‚Äôs Representation on Boards,\\" Catalyst, 2007. Other studies show that female directors enhance the effectiveness of boards at governing.Ren√©e B. Adams, Daniel Ferreira, Women in the boardroom and their impact on governance and performance, Journal of Financial Economics, Volume 94, Issue 2, 2009, Pages 291-309.. Women have better attendance, and their presence improves the attendance of men. Female directors are also more apt to serve on monitoring committees and more likely to hold CEO‚Äôs accountable for poor financial returns. Female directors, too, tend to ensure that corporations are more environmentally responsible.Glass, Christy & Cook, Alison & R. Ingersoll, Alicia. (2015). Do Women Leaders Promote Sustainability? Analyzing the Effect of Corporate Governance Composition on Environmental Performance. Business Strategy and the Environment. 10.1002/bse.1879. Three or more women directors also correlates with employee productivity, higher dividend payouts, and a greater diversity of ideas.\\"Women on Boards and the Human Capital Connection,\\" 2018, MSCI. Yet other studies advance negative outcomes. Some argue that quotas inadequately address the larger structural issue known as the glass ceiling. A working paper on the female labor market in Norway found that although a mandated quota led to an increase in female directors, it did not affect female employees of lower positions. Board members are typically appointed in one of two ways: (1) internally, through in-firm appointments of high level executives such as CEOs; and (2) externally, through appointments made from outside of the firm. Quota systems simply affect gender representation of the board and might not affect the number of women who reach the internal pool from which candidates are appointed. So even if there is greater gender diversity on a corporate board, the pool from which candidates are chosen remain disproportionately occupied by men. For example, Norway's quota system has significantly increased the number of women on corporate boards. However, the quota may not have altered the way women progress through organizations. In 2013, Norway's public companies had 41% female board representation but women made up only 5.8% of general managers at the public companies. In the same year, at the CEO level, only 6% of listed companies in Norway had a female CEO. Nevertheless, the disparity between internal and external appointments to corporate boards also arises in jurisdictions that have not instituted a quota system. For example, in 2013, 48% of the female executive directors in the United Kingdom were internally promoted, compared to 62% for males.Cranfield University School of Management, The Female FTSE Board Report 2013, (Bedford (England): Cranfield University, 2013) at 7, online: Cranfield University .  Corporate governance codes  Another approach to addressing the disproportionality on corporate boards has been the adoption of the ‚Äúcomply or explain‚Äù governance system by Governments and organizations such as stock exchanges. This system requires companies to address the issue of proportionate gender representation with regards to board and executive appointments in their company filings and other reports and to explain the reason for any failure to comply with particular gender guidelines issued by the organization. The ‚Äúcomply or explain‚Äù system exemplifies equality of opportunity, an approach to equality whereby all people should be treated similarly, regardless of prejudices, preferences, or historical disadvantages, unless particular distinctions can be justified.(Paul de Vries (2011-09-12), equal opportunity, Blackwell Reference, retrieved 2011-09-12) Fifteen countries have inserted requirements to report gender diversity board composition in their corporate governance codes. = Asia Pacific = In Australia, the Australian Securities Exchange adopted diversity reporting guidelines in 2010. The percentage of women on boards of ASX 200 companies in Australia has increased from 11% to 20% from 2010 to 2015. = Europe = In the United Kingdom, the UK Corporate Governance Code contains a mandatory ‚Äúcomply or explain‚Äù measure designed to address the disproportionally on corporate boards. The UK Corporate Governance Code allows corporate boards to implement their own gender diversity policies and explicitly requires merit to be a consideration in candidate selection.Financial Reporting Council, The UK Corporate Governance Code, 2011, at 12, online: Financial Reporting Council The UK Government has commissioned two five year reviews, the Davies Review (2011) and the Hampton-Alexander Review (2016) to set recommendations and voluntary targets for FTSE350 listed companies to increase the number of women on public company boards. Further, companies are required to provide details of their boardroom gender diversity policy and procedures for appointing executives and managers, and to provide explanations for discrepancies with the targets listed in the guidelines. In Sweden, the Swedish Annual Accounts Act requires companies to disclose information on the gender proportionality their managers in the companies' annual reports.Finland Chamber of Commerce, Consultation on Gender Imbalance in Corporate Boards in the EU, 2012, at 4, online: Financial Chamber of Commerce < http://ec.europa.eu/justice/newsroom/gender- equality/opinion/files/120528/all/143_en.pdf> In Finland, a ‚Äúcomply or explain‚Äù system requires both genders to be represented on corporate boards, and to describe and justify any failures to meet such gender representation. Following the introduction of this system and Finland's gender quota, female board representation increased from 12% to 29%.TD Economics, Special Report: Get on Board Corporate Canada (7 March 2013) at 1, online: TD In 2012, the Finland Chamber of Commerce implemented a mentoring program for women in mid to high-level managerial positions as a supplement to their current approach. = North America = In December 2014, the Ontario Securities Commission introduced comply-and-explain rules with regards to the percentage of female directors.  Pressure by institutional investors  United Kingdom = Institutional Investor Glass Lewis released guidelines related to gender diversity on corporate boards in 2016. The most recent guidelines state that FTSE 350 companies must have 33% female board representation by 2020. The method of enforcement laid out is that Glass Lewis \\"may recommend voting against the nominating committee chair.\\" = United States = BlackRock added board diversity guidelines in 2017. BlackRock's 2020 Proxy paper encourages \\"companies to have at least two women directors on their board.\\" In the event that BlackRock determines a company is not sufficiently committed to board diversity, Blackrock may recommend voting against the nominating/governance committee.\\" Glass Lewis' US benchmarks were first released in 2017. The most recent proxy paper mandates that boards have at least one female director and \\"will generally recommend voting against the nominating committee chair of a board that has no female members.\\" ISS added board diversity guidelines in 2018, stipulating that U.S. boards should have at least one female director. In the guidelines released for 2020, ISS recommended to \\"vote against or withhold from the chair of the nominating committee at companies where there are no women on the company's board.\\" This advice was relevant to companies on either the Russell 3000 or the S&P; 1500 indices.  Other responses and pending responses  Asia Pacific = In 2013, Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister of Japan announced his intention to facilitate a great increase in female directors in Japan in a commentary in the Wall Street Journal. = Europe = In 2012, the European Commission introduced a proposal requiring companies in the EU member states to have 40% non executive female directors. For the time being the proposal (which was introduced by Viviane Reding) has been shelved,https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203406404578074623918256116 although discussions for such a proposal (or a similar one) remain open.https://www.cipd.co.uk/binaries/gender-diversity-on-boards-quota-systems- work_june-2015.pdf = Latin America = In Latin America, the Brazilian Government has proposed a quota for female directors on state owned enterprises. The bill requires boards to eventually have a minimum of 40% of female directors. = North America = In Canada, two bills have been introduced that would require 40% of female board directors. Bill S-217 imposes a 40% quota for female board members of public companies and other regulated entities such as banks and insurance companies.Bill S-203 is an Act to modernize the composition of the boards of directors of certain corporations, financial institutions and parent Crown corporations, and in particular to ensure the balanced representation of women and men on those boards, 1st Sess, 41st Parl, 2011, (second reading 16 December 2011). Bill-C473 will balance the gender proportionality of directors serving on boards of state corporations by establishing minimum participant requirements by gender.Bill C-473, An Act to amend the Financial Administration Act (balanced representation), 2nd Sess, 41st Parl, 2013, (first reading 25 February 2013).  The gender pay gap on corporate boards  The gender pay gap refers to differences between pay received by men and women for comparable work. A number of studies, including a study on top managers of listed UK companies and one on companies listed on the Madrid Stock Exchange, have concluded that a gender pay gap exists between male and female directors. Philipp Geiler and Luc Renneboog found that female executive directors of listed UK companies earn 23% less than their male counterparts. A study by Gregory-Smith, Main and O'Reilly III on FTSE350 companies, however, found no evidence of such a discrepancy once the director's traits (including age and tenure) and other company features such as firm size and price to book ratio are taken into account. The director gender pay gap appears to be dependent on several factors, including whether the company is in a male dominated industry and whether the female director is married or has children. Other relevant factors found by Maria Consuelo Pucheta-Martinez and Inmaculada Bel-Oms include whether the Compensation Committee contains female members and the size of the companies. Another study by Marianne Bertrand et al. concluded that the gender quota in Norway reduced the gender gap on boards. However, as some researchers have cautioned, the small dataset from which such data from which the studies have been conducted should be considered in interpreting such results.  Controversies  Protests in the United States in 2020 have ignited controversy that progress on board diversity has advanced significantly faster for white women than for racial minorities. In data from 2019, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) observed that black directors accounted for only 4.1% of board directors in the Russell 3000 index, up .5% since 2008. In contrast, 20% of directors in the Russell 3000 were women, doubling from 10% in 2008. A 2020 report revealed that in the wake of California‚Äôs adoption of SB 826, mandating gender diversity on boards, 511 board seats were filled by women. 77.9% of those seats were filled by white women, 11.5% by Asian women, 5.3% by African American women, and 3.3% by Latina women. Companies in the UK are facing similar scrutiny. A 2019 analysis of FTSE board directors found that 100% of female board directors in the FTSE 100 were white, as were 97% of female directors in the FTSE 250.  Female Chief Executive Officers  Similar to the disproportionate gender representation on corporate boards, there is a lack of gender diversity amongst Chief Executive Officers (CEO). As of February 2016, only 4% of CEOs of S&P; 500 companies were female. that had increased to 5% (25 in total). A study on Norwegian companies following the introduction of a gender quota for female directors found that the increase in female directors had a positive correlation with the appointment of a female board chair and a female CEO. Unlike directors, there does not appear to be a gender pay gap between male and female CEOs.

Zomaya, \\"Green Data Center Networks: Challenges and Opportunities,\\" in 11th IEEE International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology (FIT), Islamabad, Pakistan, December 2013, pp. 229-234. Types of Data center network=Three-tier DCN The legacy three-tier DCN architecture follows a multi-rooted tree based network topology composed of three layers of network switches, namely access, aggregate, and core layers.Cisco, Cisco Data Center Infrastructure 2.5 Design Guide, Cisco Press, 2010. The servers in the lowest layers are connected directly to one of the edge layer switches. The aggregate layer switches interconnect together multiple access layer switches. All of the aggregate layer switches are connected to each other by core layer switches. Core layer switches are also responsible for connecting the data center to the Internet. The three-tier is the common network architecture used in data centers. However, three-tier architecture is unable to handle the growing demand of cloud computing.Bilal et al., \\"A Taxonomy and Survey on Green Data Center Networks,\\" Future Generation Computer Systems. The higher layers of the three-tier DCN are highly oversubscribed. Moreover, scalability is another major issue in three- tier DCN. Major problems faced by the three-tier architecture include, scalability, fault tolerance, energy efficiency, and cross-sectional bandwidth. The three-tier architecture uses enterprise-level network devices at the higher layers of topology that are very expensive and power hungry. Fat tree DCN Fat tree DCN architecture reduces the oversubscription and cross section bandwidth problem faced by the legacy three-tier DCN architecture. Fat tree DCN employs commodity network switches based architecture using Clos topology. The network elements in fat tree topology also follows hierarchical organization of network switches in access, aggregate, and core layers. However, the number of network switches is much larger than the three-tier DCN. The architecture is composed of k pods, where each pod contains, (k/2)2 servers, k/2 access layer switches, and k/2 aggregate layer switches in the topology. The core layers contain (k/2)2 core switches where each of the core switches is connected to one aggregate layer switch in each of the pods. The fat tree topology can offer up to 1:1 oversubscription ratio and full bisection bandwidth , depending on the each rack's total bandwidth versus the bandwidth available at the tree's highest levels. Higher tree branches are typically oversubscribed to their lower branches by a ratio of 1:5, with the problem compounding at the highest tree levels, including up to 1:80 or 1:240, at the highest levels Greenberg, Albert, et al. \\"VL2: a scalable and flexible data center network.\\" Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM 2009 conference on Data communication. 2009.. The fat tree architecture uses a customized addressing scheme and routing algorithm. The scalability is one of the major issues in fat tree DCN architecture and maximum number of pods is equal to the number of ports in each switch. DCell DCell is a server-centric hybrid DCN architecture where one server is directly connected to one server. A server in the DCell architecture is equipped with multiple Network Interface Cards (NICs). The DCell follows a recursively built hierarchy of cells. A cell0 is the basic unit and building block of DCell topology arranged in multiple levels, where a higher level cell contains multiple lower layer cells. The cell0 is building block of DCell topology, which contains n servers and one commodity network switch. The network switch is only used to connect the server within a cell0. A cell1 contain k=n+1 cell0 cells, and similarly a cell2 contains k * n + 1 dcell1. The DCell is a highly scalable architecture where a four level DCell with only six servers in cell0 can accommodate around 3.26 million servers. Besides very high scalability, the DCell architecture depicts very high structural robustness.K. Bilal, M. Manzano, S. U. Khan, E. Calle, K. Li, and A. Y. Zomaya, \\"On the Characterization of the Structural Robustness of Data Center Networks,\\" IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing, vol. 1, no. 1, pp. 64-77, 2013. However, cross section bandwidth and network latency is a major issue in DCell DCN architecture.

A qualitative discussion of different DCNs along with benefits and drawbacks associated with each one has been made available.  Challenges  Scalability is one of the foremost challenges to the DCNs. With the advent of cloud paradigm, data centers are required to scale up to hundreds of thousands of nodes. Besides offering immense scalability, the DCNs are also required to deliver high cross-section bandwidth. Current DCN architectures, such as three-tier DCN offer poor cross-section bandwidth and possess very high over-subscription ratio near the root. Fat tree DCN architecture delivers 1:1 oversubscription ratio and high cross section bandwidth, but it suffers from low scalability limited to k=total number of ports in a switch. DCell offers immense scalability, but it delivers very poor performance under heavy network load and one-to-many traffic patterns.  Performance Analysis of DCNs  A quantitative analysis of the three-tier, fat tree, and DCell architectures for performance comparison (based on throughput and latency) is performed for different network traffic pattern. The fat tree DCN delivers high throughput and low latency as compared to three-tier and DCell. DCell suffers from very low throughput under high network load and one to many traffic patterns. One of the major reasons for DCell's low throughput is very high over subscription ratio on the links that interconnect the highest level cells.  Structural robustness and Connectivity of DCNs  The DCell exhibits very high robustness against random and targeted attacks and retains most of its node in the giant cluster after even 10% of targeted failure. multiple failures whether targeted or random, as compared to the fat tree and three-tier DCNs.M. Manzano, K. Bilal, E. Calle, and S. U. Khan, \\"On the Connectivity of Data Center Networks,\\" IEEE Communications Letters, vol. 17, no. 11, pp. 2172-2175, 2013. One of the major reasons for high robustness and connectivity of the DCell is its multiple connectivity to other nodes that is not found in fat tree or three-tier architectures.  Energy efficiency of DCNs  The concerns about the energy needs and environmental impacts of data centers are intensifying. Energy efficiency is one of the major challenges of today's Information and communications technology (ICT) sector. The networking portion of a data center is accounted to consume around 15% of overall cyber energy usage. Around 15.6 billion kWh of energy was utilized solely by the networks infrastructure within the data centers worldwide. The energy consumption by the network infrastructure within a data center is expected to increase to around 50% in data centers. IEEE 802.3az standard has been standardized in 2011 that make use of adaptive link rate technique for energy efficiency.K. Bilal, S. U. Khan, S. A. Madani, K. Hayat, M. I. Khan, N. Min- Allah, J.

Chen, \\"A Survey on Green Communications using Adaptive Link Rate,\\" Cluster Computing, vol. 16, no. 3, pp. 575-589, 2013 Moreover, fat tree and DCell architectures use commodity network equipment that is inherently energy efficient. Workload consolidation is also used for energy efficiency by consolidating the workload on few devices to power-off or sleep the idle devices.Heller, Brandon, et al. \\"ElasticTree: Saving Energy in Data Center Networks.\\" NSDI.

It comprises the Burlington Bike Path (Burlington), Colchester Park (Colchester) and the Allen Point Access Area (South Hero). The trail follows the route of the Island Line railroad, built by the Rutland Railroad in 1901. The history of the Rutland Railroad is covered in Robert C. Jones \\"Railroads of Vermont, Volume 2\\" (), and in James Shaughnessy's \\"The Rutland Railroad\\", Howell North Books 1964. Passenger service on the Rutland's Island Line (and on the entire Rutland RR system) ended after a strike by employees in late June 1953. A second set of strikes in 1960 and 1961 brought about the complete closure of the Rutland Railroad. The final trains ran on September 25, 1961. In 1963 the state of Vermont purchased the abandoned, but not torn-up, Rutland Railroad lines from Burlington to Rutland, Bennington, Hoosic Junction and Bellows Falls, leasing them to the Vermont Railway and the Green Mountain Railway to resume freight service, but the state chose not acquire and reopen the Island Line. There was little on-line traffic left on that portion of the route and freight for Canada could be routed from Burlington north to Montreal over the somewhat longer Central Vermont Railway through St. Albans, Vermont. After several years of inactivity, restoring service on the Island Line would have required extensive rebuilding, and renovations of the three swing bridges on the line, over various bays of Lake Champlain. Ultimately all of the bridges on the route were removed, but the roadbed on the causeway across the lake survived, as it was heavily built with much use of granite. The alignment along the shores of Lake Champlain from Burlington Union Station north to the causeway was converted to form the Burlington Bike Path, and later took the Island Line name when the causeway was reopened, with a seasonal bike-ferry replacing the swing bridge in the northern portion of the causeway alignment. Due to a gap in the causeway, the organization Local Motion operates the Island Line Bike Ferry to shuttle cyclists across the gap. Recent developments The trail will be closed after Labor Day weekend in 2019 so that nearly $2 million in upgrades and repairs can be made due to damage caused in May 2019 when the trail experienced 70 mile an hour winds and 7 foot waves.

Background Robert Baden-Powell tested his ideas on boys' citizenship training in 1907 with an experimental camp on Brownsea Island, and in the following year, published Scouting for Boys in fortnightly instalments. Originally intended as a programme for leaders of other youth organisations to utilise, however independent Scout patrols were formed spontaneously across the United Kingdom. Baden-Powell's response was to establish a structured organisation, including tests for ranks which would enable boys to mark their proficiency in the various Scouting skills. Scout badges The insignia of a Second Class Scout Tenderfoot Scout The Tenderfoot Test was the test that a boy, originally aged between 12 and 18 years old, would have to pass before he could make his Scout Promise and become an invested member of the Scout Troop. To become a Tenderfoot, a boy had to prove that he: knew the Scout Law and Promise, knew the Scout sign and salute, knew the composition of, and how to fly the Union Jack, and could tie six specified knots and knew their uses. The Tenderfoot Badge was the Scout fleur-de-lys emblem, embroidered on cloth and worn on the left pocket of the uniform shirt.

Later developments Scouting quickly spread to other countries and territories, both within the British Empire and outside of it. In these countries, Baden-Powell's scheme was adapted to suit local conditions. In the United Kingdom Boy Scouts' Association, there were several amendments to the scheme before it was replaced on the recommendation of the 1966 Advance Party Report, which said that \\"The worst condemnation of the present training Scheme is the fact that more than half of those who join the Movement never progress beyond the Tenderfoot stage\\".The Boy Scouts' Association (1966), The Chief Scout's Advance Party Report (p. 32) The proposal for a new three stage scheme in which Scouts could progress rapidly in the early stages was adopted by the Association and began to be implemented in October 1967.The Boy Scouts' Association (1966), Design for Scouting (p. 21) A number of Scout Groups that were dissatisfied with this and other restructuring formed the Baden-Powell Scouts' Association in 1970 and continue with an updated version of Baden-Powell's scheme to the present day.

As Janice Atkinson-Small she wrote a column for the Daily Mail.http://www.tv.com/shows/question-time/season-33/ She was selected as the UKIP candidate for Folkestone and Hythe for the 2015 general election, before being expelled from the party and withdrawn as its candidate due to a 'serious financial irregularity'. On 16 June 2015, it was announced that Atkinson had joined the newly formed far-right group in the European Parliament, Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF). Atkinson is an associate of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Atkinson did not stand in the 2019 European Parliament elections.

Rebel Media In February 2019 Atkinson joined the Canadian website The Rebel Media as a reporter. Controversies During the 2014 campaign it emerged that despite Atkinson's claims ‚Äì and status as a champion of state selective education ‚Äì her alma mater, Blackheath Bluecoat School, is not and has never been a grammar school. It was also reported that, before she joined UKIP, Atkinson was dropped from the 2011 alternative vote campaign following a meeting with undecided Conservatives in which she mentioned \\"her support for elements of\\" the British National Party's platform. A few days later Atkinson swore at anti-racism campaigners. The incident followed her call for 'abusive' anti-UKIP protestors to be arrested by the police. A photo capturing the moment was widely reported and went viral on social media. Atkinson, who has described towns in Kent as 'no-go areas' as a result of Eastern European immigration, has defended her position, claiming she marched as part of the Anti-Nazi League in her youth. In August 2014 she issued an apology after being recorded by a BBC News crew referring to the Thai (or Thai-born) wife of a constituent, who were both UKIP supporters, as \\"a ting-tong from somewhere\\", a term used in Thailand for people with mental health problems. The woman and her husband threatened to withdraw from UKIP membership but changed their mind after a personal apology from UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Interviewed on camera later at their home, the woman and her husband said that Atkinson hadn't apologised to them and was quite belligerent. Whilst speaking of Atkinson, Farage said \\"99% of UKIP members aren't like that and don't hold those views\\". Atkinson apologised and explained in an interview shortly after that she never meant any malice and the unintended comment was taken out of context. In December 2014 it was revealed that Atkinson, whose annual salary as an MEP was around ¬£79,000 per year, owed more than ¬£2,000 in unpaid child support. Her ex-husband claimed this had \\"caused major hardship for her son and for her family\\". Atkinson was singled out for criticism as she had previously attacked \\"feckless families\\" who have more children than they can afford. Expenses fraud and expulsion from UKIP On 19 March 2015 Atkinson was suspended from the party following \\"allegations of a serious financial nature\\". The Sun published a secret recording in which Atkinson's chief of staff, Christine Hewitt, spoke to a staff member at a restaurant in Margate and asked them for a fraudulent invoice, inflating the bill to over three times the cost of the ¬£950 meal. On the recording Hewett was heard to say \\"we overcharge them slightly, because that‚Äôs the way we repatriate it\\". The following day the police were reported to be investigating. On 23 March Atkinson was expelled from UKIP for \\"bringing the party into disrepute\\". No legal action was taken against Atkinson, but Hewitt pled guilty to fraud and was given a suspended sentence. Atkinson was cleared of all allegations by the Kent Police and no further action was taken against her. Policies In the aftermath of the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017, Atkinson called for the reintroduction of the death penalty for those convicted of terrorist crimes. On 1 March 2018 Atkinson was one of three UK MEPs who voted against a motion to encourage national parliaments to ban \\"gay conversion therapies\\". In August 2018 Atkinson called on Home Secretary Sajid Javid to fly the Union Jack at ports and airports; the request was refused. Personal Atkinson was previously married to Steve Small, with whom she had two sons. Small, who was granted custody of the children following their divorce, criticised Atkinson in 2014 for falling behind on her child support payments. She was taken to court twice by the Child Support Agency to force her to pay what she owed. Her current husband, Simon, is a banker. In March 2019, she revealed that she had been diagnosed with cancer of the tonsils.

By 1920 it was an established manufacturer of fire engines for towns in Massachusetts, and from the 1920s through the 1980s it expanded to small but reliable markets in the south, midwest, west coast, and internationally. Howard Smith, two time author on Maxim has estimated that, all told, Maxim made over 3,000 fire engines during this period. Also known as Maxim Motor Division (when bought by the Seagrave Corporation in 1963 and operated as an independent corporation). It was known as Maxim Industries when bought by North Street Associates in 1975. The name was changed back to Maxim Motor Company when owned by David Deane, owner of Springfield Fire Equipment. It was acquired by Harvey Waite in 1985 and company changed to Maxim Incorporated.

Parker, civil rights lawyer and voting rights activist (1996 photo) Frank Ruff Parker III (May 11, 1940 ‚Äì July 10, 1997) was an American civil rights lawyer and voting rights activist. Beginning in 1981, while working for The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, he directed the Voting Rights Project, where he helped secure from the United States Congress a 25-year extension of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. During his 12 years as Director of the Voting Rights Project, he launched a program to enforce the guarantees of the Voting Rights Act on a nationwide level through litigation and public education, and was a leader in the five-year struggle to enact the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. In 1990, he authored an award-winning book on the impact of the Voting Rights Act in Mississippi, Black Votes Count: Political Empowerment in Mississippi After 1965. Early career Frank Parker began his legal career as a staff attorney in the Office of General Counsel of the United States Commission on Civil Rights from 1966 to 1968. He moved to Jackson, Mississippi, in 1968, working as a staff attorney with the Jackson office of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. He became chief counsel in 1976. He litigated dozens of voting rights and employment discrimination cases in the state of Mississippi. Parker served as chief counsel or co-counsel in several landmark cases, including, but not limited to, Brooks v. Winter, which resulted in the creation of a majority Black court-ordered congressional district and the election in 1986 of Mike Espy, the first Black member of Congress from Mississippi since Reconstruction; and Connor v. Finch, which resulted in four Black legislators being elected to the Mississippi Legislature in Hinds County in 1975 and a total of 17 Black legislators elected statewide from single member districts in 1979. In 1978 Parker succeeded Mel Leventhal as counsel for plaintiffs in Loewen et al. v. Turnipseed et al., challenging Mississippi's denial of Mississippi: Conflict and Change, a textbook in Mississippi history intended for use in a required ninth-grade course. Under his leadership, the case was won, a victory that the American Library Association includes among a dozen decisions that underlie Americans' right to read. After Jackson Easter flood damaged the campus of Jackson Academy, the racially segregated private school resumed classes in temporary facilities provided by local churches. Jackson Academy was forced to vacate the churches after Parker filed a lawsuit to force the IRS to remove the churches' tax exempt status since the churches were aiding a segregation academy. TParker recalled that he received so many threats of violence that he had to leave Mississippi for several weeks. Parker served as an associate professor of political science at Tougaloo College from 1975 to 1976. He returned to Washington, D.C., in 1981, working as voting rights director for the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law until 1993. Mr. Parker was a leader in the effort to gain passage of the Voter Registration Act of 1993, the \\"motor-voter\\" law. Parker taught at the District of Columbia School of Law from 1993 to 1995. He taught at American University in 1996 and then accepted an appointment as a visiting professor at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, teaching constitutional law. At the time of his death on July 10, 1997, Parker had accepted an appointment as a visiting law professor at the University of Pittsburgh. Awards Parker's book Black Votes Count received numerous awards in 1991, including the Silver Gavel Award from the American Bar Association, the Ralph J. Bunche Award from the American Political Science Association, the V. O. Key Award from the Southern Political Science Association, the McLemore Prize from the Mississippi Historical Society, and the Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Human Rights in the United States Outstanding Book Award. Parker was rewarded with an Honorary Black Man of the Year Award in 1970, the Martin Luther King-John F. Kennedy Award from the Mississippi Council on Human Relations in 1974 and the Jackson Branch NAACP Freedom Award in 1975. Personal life and Education Frank Parker was born May 11, 1940, in Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania, to Marjorie LeClair Parker and Frank R.

The engine shown is Calico R.R. #2 'Emil'. The Waterloo Mining Railroad, also known as the Calico Railroad or Daggett-Calico Railroad, was a narrow gauge railroad built to carry silver ore from the mines in the Calico Mountains north of Calico to the mills located at Elephant Mountain near Daggett, California from 1888 to 1903. The American Borax Company leased, and later bought, a small length of the railroad to use for their borax mining operations near Lead Mountain in 1901, and the line managed to last for about another 6 years afterwards. During this time, it was referred to as the American Borax Company Railroad (or A.B.C. Railroad), and the Columbia Mine Railroad. History=Silver mining The Columbia Mill near Daggett, California, where Calico R.R. No. 1 'Uncle Dan' bought the borax shales mined from Lead Mountain to be processed. In the 1880s, Calico was one of the most successful silver mining towns in Southern California, with a large town population of about 1,200. It had two silver mines, the Waterloo and Silver King, which produced about over $1,000,000 worth of silver ore in just 14 months. The Southern Pacific Railroad built a railroad line to the nearest town of Daggett about 10 miles away, to become involved in the silver mining business, and in return, supply the residents of Calico with goods, timber and whatever else was needed to keep the mines going. The Oro Grande Mining Company owned most of the silver mines in and around Calico, and was usually responsible for the transfer of the silver ore from the mines to Waterloo Mills near Daggett, and for the export of the silver products from there. Hauling silver ore was about $2.50 per ton, but production was limited by the amount that could be hauled. Oro Grande had their own 14-mule team hauling the silver ore from the mines to the processing plants at Elephant Mountain near Daggett, but thought they could do better with a shortline from Calico to Daggett. In March 1885, plans were put forward for a standard gauge line to be built from the junction at Daggett, to branch off to the silver mines and mills, and connect with Calico to provide a direct rail service with trains incoming from Barstow and Needles. However, the Calico mines were already showing signs of declining production, and the rising costs of transportation and the falling prices of silver made the project unfeasible. The plans for the shortline were soon abandoned. =Railroad= By 1887 production of silver ore at the mines had increased sufficiently for the Waterloo Mills at Daggett to upgrade their operations to a 60-stamp mill, powered by electricity and water from the Mojave River. It was decided that a railroad had to be built to keep up with the increase in demand for ore. The Calico Railroad was built for 11 miles long starting at the Waterloo Mine, about 2 to 3 miles to the west of Calico. From there, the line went straight down for about 11 miles before looping around Elephant Mountain at a steady rising grade before finally reaching the Waterloo Mill on the side of the mountain facing towards Daggett. A spur was later added to the Silver King Mine in Calico in 1889. The railroad was built up Wall Street Canyon, where at the end was a huge ore bin which was fed ore from the mine high above the town by either animal-drawn ore wagons or mine carts. The line never actually reached Daggett, but luckily the town was right over the river from the mill at Elephant Mountain, so whenever something needed to be shipped over to Daggett, either the local wagon roads took the goods to the town or people walked across the riverbed whenever it was dry. The line also hauled a few passengers, but the line never owned any carriages, so people rode in the ore wagons in between Calico or Daggett, or miners would ride them from Calico to wherever they worked. The declining demands and prices of silver forced the Calico mines to go into decline, and in March 1892 the Waterloo Mine was closed down, followed by the Silver King later on in 1896, and the Calico Railroad ceased operations for a while. The locomotives and rolling stock were stored at the engine house located near to the Waterloo Mill, on the north-west side of the Mojave River close to the location of the current road bridge linking Daggett and Yermo. Later in 1899, D.D. Connell and Marcus Pluth agreed to lease the properties of the Waterloo Mining Company, including the railroad, to haul whatever profitable amount of silver was left in the mines. Silver ore was hauled from the Waterloo Mine down towards Elephant Mountain, where the silver was processed in the original 16-stamp mill the company had erected since Calico's early days in 1883. The lease for the silver operations lasted from 1899 until 1903. Borax mining In 1897, the Pacific Coast Borax Company began constructing the Borate and Daggett Railroad to link the nearby borax mines of Borate to the standard-gauge railway at Daggett, and were short on locomotives to run the line. They leased the one of the saddle-tank engines (No. 2, \\"Emil\\") from the Waterloo Mining Company to aid in the construction of the new line. The locomotive was said to have been rather slippy on the steep grade ascending to Borate, and was used for only a few months until the arrival of PCB's first locomotive and \\"Emil\\" was sent back to Waterloo. =American Borax Company= In 1899, the American Borax Company bought mining claims at Lead Mountain, about four miles west of Calico, to mine boric acid and plotted to build a railroad to reach Daggett across the river where they had their processing plants. American Borax agreed with the Waterloo Mining Company and D.D. Connell (who by then was also leasing the line from Waterloo Mining along with fellow miner Marcus Pluth, to transport the last of the ore from Waterloo Mine in 1899) to reserve running rights on the line to allow their trains to use the same track in between the junctions going towards Calico and the borax mine at Lead Mountain (named \\"Columbia\\"). They had also leased the line's first locomotive \\"Uncle Dan,\\" to operate the borax trains outgoing from Lead Mountain. The line was extended from the mill branch at Elephant Mountain to cross the Mojave River on a Pratt through truss bridge before pulling into the Columbia Mill on the other side of the river, where the calcining plants were located. Once the boric acid was processed into borax, the train took the ore to the railhead in the town of Daggett where the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad came and took away the borax to sell in the market. American Borax and D.D. Connell both ran the line for their reasons, until a disastrous train wreck between the two engines at a switch in 1903 happened due to Connell hurrying with his engine (No. 2, \\"Emil\\") to get back to Daggett during a storm to terminate his lease. After Connell had been contracted to tear up the rail line towards Calico and all the wooden structures in the town, Waterloo Mining Co. gave full ownership of the railroad to American Borax to use the remainder of the line for the borax traffic from the Columbia Mine at Lead Mountain. By 1907, the American Borax Company discovered better deposits of borax in the Tick Canyon Formation, about 30 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Once they partnered up with fellow borax company, Sterling Borax, to take a hold of the borax claims there, the mining operations at Daggett were shut down and all the mining equipment, even the railroad itself was moved up to Lang, California, and the mining operations of the Calico Mountains ceased to exist. Daggett & Calico/Waterloo Mining Railroad's No. 1 'Uncle Dan'. Daggett & Calico/Waterloo Mining Railroad's No. 2 'Emil'. Locomotives and rolling stock The Waterloo Mining Railroad only had two engines. Both were built by H.K. Porter, Inc. in 1888 for use on the railway line in between Daggett and Calico. One was called 'Uncle Dan' was an (H.K. Porter B-S Class; s/n 937), the other 'Emil' was an (H.K. Porter C-S Class; s/n 962). Both were named for the important heads of the mining company and the railroad, Daniel Wells Jr. and Emil Sanger, who was appointed head of the Waterloo Mining Company in 1888 and the one who ordered for the building of the railroad. They were both used on the line, even after the American Borax Company took over the operations of the railroad. In 1903, 'Emil' was bought by the Mohave and Milltown Railway, and 'Uncle Dan' was left to handle the borax operations alone until about 1907 when the railroad was torn up and moved up to Lang, California to work the mines at Tick Canyon for the Sterling Borax Company. No records were kept of the two engines being moved away, sold or scrapped from their respective railroads after that. Whether they actually survived scrapping or not is one of the great mysteries surrounding this little-known mining railroad. Rolling stock consisted of at least four ore wagons built at the Virginia & Truckee Railroad's shops at Carson City, Nevada, along with a water car. American Borax added a further five ore wagons for hauling borax to the roster, these cars' design is of unknown origin.

Legacy The town of Calico was bought and rebuilt from the ground up in 1951 by Walter Knott, the owner of Knott's Berry Farm, as a ghost town tourist attraction. A tourist railroad was planned to be built to revive the history and legacy of the old Waterloo Mining Railroad. The narrow gauge Calico & Odessa Railroad was built by Shafe-Malcom Enterprises in 1954. It loops around one of the mountains nearest to Calico Ghost Town to one of the old silver mine shafts and the site of the former eastern portion of Calico. The line is operated by a single 0-4-2 steam-outline diesel locomotive. The line today does not follow any of the former trackbed of the Waterloo Mining Railroad. The original line began below at the mouth of Wall Street Canyon, and is now a paved road for tourists to access Calico from Interstate 10. Some segments of the old railbed can still be traced out in some places in the desert, but much has now been covered by housing developments of Yermo. The best place to see traces of the old line are at the site of the former Waterloo Mine, where a large ore bin had dumped silver ore into the waiting trains below. The old foundations of the mills at Elephant Mountain near Daggett also can still be seen and explored.

Trbojeviƒá, Cersko-majeviƒçka grupa korpusa pukovnika Dragoslava Raƒçiƒáa, published 2001. Deroko is notable for leading joint Chetnik‚ÄìPartisan operations. He was killed by Partisan soldiers and his death marked the beginning of an all-out civil war in Yugoslavia.How was Captain Deroko killed? at Glas javnosti Early life Deroko was born in the French city of Le Creusot on 7 April 1912 as the son of Col. Vladislav Deroko and Natalija Deroko (n√©e ƒêorƒëeviƒá). His mother Natalija was the daughter of the Medical Corps Colonel and Doctor Vladan ƒêorƒëeviƒá who was a President of the Ministry Council, Minister and Ambassador in the Serbian government. Jovan Deroko's great-grandfather was a Venetian by the name of Marco de Rocco, who moved to Dubrovnik and married a local woman. The surname de Rocco was later phoneticized to Deroko. Deroko's first cousin was well-known Serbian architect Aleksandar Deroko. World War II Deroko's division was stationed on the periphery of Zagreb at the same time Croatian officers were massively leaving the Yugoslav side. The Wehrmacht entered Zagreb without battle and Deroko retreated towards Montenegro in order to escape imprisonment. He continued towards the Bojana river as was stated by the P-41 plan by General Du≈°an Simoviƒá. After the Yugoslav government capitulated, Deroko and numerous officers left for the Bay of Kotor with the goal of joining the government-in-exile in London and by offering them his services as an officer who wishes to continue to battle. Along with him at that time was colonel Zvonimir Vuƒçkoviƒá who escaped to Montenegro after the capitulation. While at the Bay of Kotor, Deroko found out that Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá is hiding out somewhere in the western part of Serbia and Deroko tried to contact him. He soon found a contact with high-ranking politicians who let him know Mihailoviƒá's whereabouts. In the middle of June, Deroko arrived at Ravna Gora and quickly made himself known as one of the most capable commanders and became known as the youngest captain in the entire Chetnik organization. After organizing the first Chetnik battalions, Deroko was assigned the task of organizing the Ljubiƒá area.Stenografske bele≈°ke, pp. 407‚Äî409; dr J. Marjanoviƒá, Prilozi, pp. 212 and 312 In the first joint Chetnik‚ÄìPartisan operations in the western part of Serbia, Deroko took part in liberating ƒåaƒçak. The Jelica Partisan detachment also took part in the action. In ƒåaƒçak, two German cannons were captured. The cannons were immediately given to Deroko who used them in his battles. Deroko thus became the commander of the first Chetnik artillery unit in western Serbia. Upon freeing the city, Deroko was named the temporary representative of the Chetnik command in ƒåaƒçak while Ratko Mitroviƒá was named the Partisan representative. Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá then gave Deroko the responsibility of being the chief executive of the High Command and command of the artillery unit which took part in the Battle of Kraljevo. The Siege of Kraljevo took place in the first few days of October and lasted almost a month. The commander of the Chetnik forces was major Radoslav ƒêuriƒá while Deroko still held the function of chief executive and commander of the artillery unit located at the Ibar river. During the siege, Deroko managed to take out a German airport near Kraljevo and to cut off German communication between Kraljevo and Belgrade. The failed siege of Kraljevo also marked the beginning of the civil war between Partisans and Chetniks. After the Chetnik attack on U≈æice on 1 November 1941 (known as the Battle of Tre≈°njica), Deroko gained new functions. After the beginning of the first serious battles between Chetniks and Partizans, Deroko represented the Chetnik delegation at the talks of stopping the battles. The first meeting was held in the Drakƒçiƒái village near Kraljevo. At the meeting, present were Deroko and major ƒêuriƒá from the Chetnik side and Sredoje Uro≈°eviƒá from the Partisan side. The talks however didn't have any result. During the talks, Deroko ordered that the Partisan delegation be apprehended as a retaliation to the Partisan attack on the Chetnik formation in ƒåaƒçak. After tiresome negotiations, Deroko freed the Partisan delegations but the Partisans had already surrounded the village. This led to an armed confrontation which lasted until Deroko and his group were kicked out of the village. Death and legacy Deroko then attacked a new area of Ljubiƒá with his cannons with the aim of bombing ƒåaƒçak which was held by Partisans. The Partisan patrol found out where Deroko was in Ljubiƒá so as a preventative measure, the Jelica Partisan unit was sent in to thwart Deroko. The battle began in the evening hours of 6 November 1941 in Ljubiƒá. The Partisans wanted to destroy the two cannons Deroko was using. Deroko took control of the area on the surrounding hills beside a small lake from which he had a good view of the situation. In trying to stop the Partisan unit which was advancing upon the hill however, Deroko was killed beside his cannons when struck in the head. After that, the Partisans took the two cannons and used them in their units. The second version of his death states that Deroko was lightly wounded and went down to the lake to take care of his wound where he was spotted by a Partisan platoon which executed him on the spot. According to testimonies of some of the Chetniks, Partisans first captured Deroko and then murdered him. When he was killed, Deroko was only 29 years old. Besides proving himself a capable commander, he was a renowned writer as well. Since he lived in the Toplica region in the years of the beginning of the famous Toplica Uprising, Deroko wrote the book Topliƒçki ustanak while still preparing to enter the army. The song Nad Kraljevom ≈æiva vatra seva is about his death and the death of his fellow soldier and friend Simo Uzelac who was with him at the time.

Gantt Center, Opening Day The Harvey B. Gantt Center for African- American Arts + Culture, formerly known as the Afro-American Cultural Center, is located in Charlotte, North Carolina and named for Harvey Gantt, the city's first African-American mayor and the first African-American student at Clemson University. The 46,500 sq ft, four-story center was designed by Freelon Group Architects at a cost of $18.6 million -- and was dedicated in October 2009 as part of what is now the Levine Center for the Arts.  About the building  Located at South Tryon and Stonewall streets, the four-story 46,490-square foot building is a \\"modernist structure wrapped in glass and metal\\", is 360' by 40' and located above tunnels connecting College Street and Stonewall Street to a parking garage for Duke Energy Center. To allow access by car and truck ramps on the narrow site (400' x 60'), the lobby is on the second floor and is reached by stairs and escalators which frame a central glass atrium and are based on Jacob's Ladder in the Book of Genesis. The design was inspired by Myers Street School in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Charlotte, an African- American section of the city which was demolished as a result of urban renewal in the 1960s. The school was Charlotte's only public school for African- Americans from 1886 to 1907. The Jacob's Ladder concept also appears outside the building. Another feature of the building is a rain screen, with perforated metal panels in some areas and windows in others, resembling a quilt with fluorescent lights that resemble stitches. Freelon Group won the 2009 Thomas Jefferson Award for Public Architecture from the American Institute of Architects for projects that included the Gantt Center. On the east wing wall is Divergent Threads, Lucent Memories, a work by David Wilson of Apex inspired by quilts which recalls the history of Brooklyn. On the plaza connecting the center to other area buildings, Intersections by Juan Logan uses Kuba patterns from Democratic Republic of Congo, with chevron and diamond patterns representing connections between different cultures.  The John and Vivian Hewitt Collection of African-American Art  Vivian Hewitt was the first African-American librarian hired by Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, and she taught and served as a librarian at Atlanta University. Her husband John taught English at Morehouse College. John and Vivian Hewitt, though not rich, put together one of the most significant collections of African-American art during their 50 years of marriage, starting in 1949. The art works were gifts made to each other over the years. The works were affordable for them at the time they bought them because white people had not started buying them, but as the importance of African-American artists became clear, that started to change. The Hewitt Collection was purchased by NationsBank (later Bank of America) in 1998, with the plan being to locate the works in an expanded Afro- American Cultural Center. The collection toured the country, and the 58 works now make up the majority of the Gantt Center's permanent collection. The 20th century African-American artists include Henry Ossawa Tanner, Ann Tanksley, John Biggers, Elizabeth Catlett and Romare Bearden. Shortly before the Gantt Center opened in October 2009, 26 works by 20 artists went to the center. Other works from the collection were scheduled to appear in the gallery devoted to the collection over a two-year period.  History  In 1974, as an English professor and doctoral student at UNC-Charlotte, Mary Harper proposed an Afro-American cultural center for Charlotte. Working with Dr. Bertha Maxwell-Roddey, director of the University's Black Studies Center, she called her proposal \\"Vistas Unlimited: The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Afro-American Cultural and Service Center\\". Harper and Roddey realized that people did not know a lot about the accomplishments of African-Americans, and particularly African-Americans from North Carolina. The center they planned would let African-Americans celebrate who they were and what their people had done. Harper and Maxwell-Roddey started with a festival in Marshall Park, the former site of the Brooklyn neighborhood. After a second festival in 1975, the women helped to start the Afro-American Cultural and Service Center. For ten years starting in 1976, the Afro-American Cultural Center used 605 square feet in the former First Baptist Church known as Spirit Square. Other locations were considered including the McColl Center for Visual Art. The permanent location eventually chosen was Little Rock A.M.E. Zion Church. The church was planning a new sanctuary across the street from their existing location on Myers Street, and people worried the old building might be demolished. The brick Neoclassical Revival building that was Little Rock's third location was designed by James Mackson McMichael and was completed in June 1911 at a cost of $20,000. Little Rock sold their old building to the city in 1979 and moved to their new home in 1981. The building was declared a historical landmark in 1982. 7th Street was to be widened, which put the historic building in jeopardy. Instead, the former church was renovated using $1.1 million in donations and a $540,000 grant from the city, with Dalton Morgan Shook & Partners as the architects. On March 15, 1986, the Afro-American Cultural Center officially opened its new 11,000-square-foot home at Myers and 7th Streets. The two-story building had three levels, with a 180-seat theater and a 300-seat amphitheater. Its classes included music, dance, theater and visual arts. Voters rejected a $95 million plan for cultural facilities and a new arena in 2001. At the time, the plan was to expand the Afro-American Cultural Center with $10 million that would have come from the arts package. In addition to expansion, several new sites were considered. On November 2, 2005, a plan was announced for a new $17.9 million Afro-American Cultural Center as part of the Wachovia Cultural Campus on Tryon Street. To attract visitors would require a major attraction. Bank of America had announced it would donate the Hewitt Collection in 1998, but the existing building was not large enough. On December 7, 2007, the Afro-American Cultural Center, which had said earlier in the year that their new facility would be named for Harvey Gantt, revealed the formal name The Harvey B. Gantt Center for African-American Arts and Culture. This was later changed to Harvey B. Gantt Center for African- American Arts + Culture. Freelon, later named as lead architect for the National Museum of African American History and Culture, designed the new building. Although the site was very narrow, Freelon saw designing a building in that space as a challenge. After the decision was made to move the Afro- American Cultural Center to the new Harvey Gantt Center, those interested in historic preservation wanted to make sure the former church remained standing. In 2008, Little Rock Church had already asked to lease their former home. Little Rock paid $590,000 in April 2009 to buy back the old building, which was rededicated on December 13, 2009, as the Little Rock Community Development Center. The Gantt Center was the first part of the Wells Fargo (formerly Wachovia) Cultural Campus to be completed. It had four times the space of the Little Rock site. The dedication ceremonies for the $18.6 million Gantt Center at Tryon and Stonewall Streets were held on October 24, 2009. Mayor Pat McCrory, who was about to leave office, told Gantt, \\"Former mayor to former mayor, you have been a great role model. You are the best of Charlotte, and I am so glad to see your name on this building.\\" Gantt said, \\"This beautiful, awesome building is far beyond my wildest dreams. I feel good about what this magnificent building represents ‚Äì how far we have come.\\" The Harvey B. Gantt Center was featured in Google Cultural Institute's February 2016 online gallery celebrating black history, art, and culture. The Center was part of 50 cultural institutions, 80 curated exhibits, and over 500 videos, images, and articles in the gallery.  References  External links  * * Harvey B.

A native of Daylam, Ruzbahan began serving the Buyids at an unknown date and quickly rose into high ranks. After constant pressure from king Mu'izz al- Dawla to conquer Batihah, he, along with his two brothers, started a rebellion lasting from 955 to 957. After the end of the rebellion, Ruzbahan was imprisoned and shortly executed.  Biography = Early life and career  Map of Iraq in the 9th‚Äì10th centuries Ruzbahan was the son of a certain Vindadh-Khurshid, and had two brothers named Asfar and Bullaka. Like his Buyid overlords, Ruzbahan was a Daylamite. However, unlike the Buyids, he probably belonged to a family of noble origin. When the Buyid ruler Mu'izz al-Dawla conquered Iraq in 945, Ruzbahan was appointed as the tax collector of the Sawad. Ruzbahan was originally a low rank officer who served a Buyid officer named Musa Fayadhah. However, under Mu'izz al-Dawla he rapidly rose to higher ranks and became a favourite of Mu'izz al-Dawla. In 948/949, during negotiations between Mu'izz al-Dawla's and the Sallarid ruler Marzuban's ambassadors, Marzuban was greatly insulted, and became enraged; he tried to avenge himself by marching towards Ray, which was under the control of Mu'izz al-Dawla's brother Rukn al-Dawla. Rukn al-Dawla, however, managed to trick and slow Marzuban down by diplomatic means, while he was receiving aid from Mu'izz al-Dawla, who sent an army under Seb√ºk-Tegin, which also included other officer such as Ruzbahan, Burarish, Ibrahim ibn al-Mutawwaq, 'Ammar \\"the Mad\\", and Ahmad ibn Salih Kilabi. However, when the army was close to Dinavar, Burarish, who disliked Seb√ºk-Tegin and refused to obey the orders of the latter, mutinied along with most of the Daylamites in the army, except Ruzbahan and other Daylamite officers. Burarish shortly heavily wounded Seb√ºk- Tegin, who, however, managed to flee from the latter. For unknown reasons, Burarish shortly fled, but was quickly captured by the supporters of Seb√ºk- Tegin. The army of Seb√ºk-Tegin then continued to Ray, and at the same time, reinforcements arrived from Shiraz. Rukn al-Dawla shortly managed to defeat and capture Marzuban. In 949, Mu'izz al-Dawla sent Ruzbahan on an expedition against the Batihah ruler 'Imran ibn Shahin. Ruzbahan discovered 'Imran's location and attacked him, but was heavily defeated and forced to withdraw. 'Imran then became even more bold, with his subjects demanding protection money from anyone, including government officials, that crossed their path, and the path to Basra by water was effectively closed off. Mu'izz al-Dawla, after receiving numerous complaints from his officers, sent another army in 950 or 951, under the joint command of Ruzbahan and the amir's vizier al- Muhallabi. Ruzbahan, who disliked the vizier, convinced him to directly attack 'Imran. He kept his forces in the rear and fled as soon as fighting between the two sides began. 'Imran used the terrain effectively, laying ambushes and confusing al-Muhallabi's army. Many of the vizier's soldiers died in the fighting and he himself only narrowly escaped capture, swimming to safety. Mu'izz al-Dawla then came to terms with 'Imran, acceding to his terms. Prisoners were exchanged and 'Imran was made a vassal of the Buyids, being instated as governor of the Batihah.  Rebellion  Peace lasted for approximately five years between the two sides. During this period, a marriage was being arranged between a daughter of Ruzbahan and Mu'izz al-Dawla's son Izz al-Dawla. A false rumor of Mu'izz al-Dawla's death in 955, however, prompted 'Imran to seize a Buyid convoy traveling from Ahvaz to Baghdad. Mu'izz demanded that the items confiscated be returned, at which point 'Imran returned the money gained, but kept the goods taken. Ruzbahan was then for a third time sent to the swamp, but shortly revolted along with his brother Asfar and spared 'Imran from a new attack. Ruzbahan's other brother, Bullaka, joined the rebellion and revolted at Shiraz. Ruzbahan was further joined by the Daylamite soldiers of al-Muhallabi. Ruzbahan quickly marched towards Ahvaz, where al-Muhallabi was preparing a counter-attack. However, the troops of al-Muhallabi quickly deserted him and joined Ruzbahan. Ruzbahan then marched towards Mu'izz al-Dawla, who sent an army under his Daylamite general Shirzil, who, however, shortly, along with his army, joined the rebellion of Ruzbahan. In 956, Mu'izz al-Dawla left Baghdad in order to fight Ruzbahan himself. Meanwhile, the Hamdanid ruler Nasir al-Dawla used this opportunity to seize Baghdad. In 957, Ruzbahan fought a final battle against Mu'izz al-Dawla. Ruzbahan almost managed to win the battle, but was defeated by Mu'izz al- Dawla's ghulams. The defeat marked the end of Ruzbahan's rebellion. Ruzbahan was captured during the battle and was imprisoned in a fortress known as Sarat.  Captivity and death  The Daylamite supporters of Ruzbahan then began planning to capture the fortress and rescue Ruzbahan. However, Abu'l-Abbas Musafir, an officer of Mu'izz al-Dawla, managed to discover of the Daylamite's plan, and quickly urged Mu'izz al-Dawla to have Ruzbahan killed. Mu'izz al-Dawla, however, did not agree with him. A number of Mu'izz al- Dawla's officer shortly told him the same, which made him agree with them. When it became night, the guards of Mu'izz al-Dawla took Ruzbahan to the Tigris river, where he was drowned.

St Olan's is a residence in Aghavrin townland, north-west of Coachford village in County Cork, Ireland. Lewis's Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837) states a glebe of 30 acres was purchased at Aghavrin by the Board of First Fruits, but the rector did not take possession, as the annual rental was too high. The Ordnance Survey name book (c. 1840) describes the 'Glebe of Aghavrin' as the property of Captain Crooke, being good ground with some plantation, and the remainder under cultivation. The 1842 surveyed OS map depicts St Olan's Rectory, with the surrounding grounds and glebe clearly shown. By the mid- nineteenth century, the Primary Valuation of Ireland (Griffith's Valuation) records Reverend William Welland as occupying c. 30 acres in Aghavrin townland, which consisted of a 'house, offices, land and glebe', with the lessor being William Crooke of Aghavrin House. Reverend Welland also occupied c. 5 acres of plantation land, with the lessor again being William Crooke. The 1901 surveyed OS map indicates a name change to 'St Olan's', with the grounds of the property still clearly identifiable. The Irish Tourist Association survey of 1944 refers to 'St Olan's House, Aghavrin', the residence of Mr Devlin, Area Engineer of Cork County Council. The erection date of the property is given as c. 1840, as a 'Protestant Rectory', and completed c. 1890. It remains a private residence, and is not accessible to the public.

He is known for his statuette in the shape of a seated scribe. He is also subject of a theory that claims he was pharaoh of Egypt for a very short time.  Identity  Setka was the eldest son and crown prince of pharaoh Djedefre. He lived and worked during the 4th Dynasty. His private live is unknown, the names of his own family members are lost. Since the names of three other sons of Djedefre, namely Baka, Harnit and Nykau-Djedefre, are archaeologically detected, these should be Setka's brothers or half-brothers. The daughters of Djedefre, Hetepheres III and Neferhetepes, would be Setka's sisters or half-sisters. His mother is unknown, too. It could be one of Djedefre's wives, Khentetka or Hetepheres II, but this is highly uncertain.Aidan Dodson, Dyan Hilton: The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. The American University in Cairo Press, London 2004, , p. 52-61.Aidan Dodson: On the date of the unfinished pyramid of Zawyet el-Aryan. In: Discussion in Egyptology, vol. 3. University Press, Oxford (UK) 1985, p. 21‚Äì24.  Office and career  According to the inscription on the podest of his statuette, Setka was Member of the elite, Eldest bodily son of the king, High lector priest of his father, Provost of the morning house and Head of the palace.  Possible reign as pharaoh  According to Egyptologist Aidan Dodson, it is possible that Setka was pharaoh in Egypt for a very short time (maybe one or two years). His assumption is based on the so-called Unfinished Northern Pyramid of Zawyet el'Aryan, which is located at Zawyet el'Aryan. This unfinished pyramid shaft was abandoned shortly after beginning and only a great sum of red and black ink inscriptions left by the workmen were found. These provide a royal cartouche name, which remains partially illegible. The first sign can be identified as a Ka-sign, but the first, introducing sign was copied by the pyramid excavator so fuzzy, that it remains undecipherable. Aidan Dodson is convinced of the depiction of a sitting Seth-animal, reading the royal name as Seth-Ka (\\"Seth is mine Ka\\"). In this case, Setka had actually followed his father onto the throne. Additionally, some scholars believe that Setka and his father Radjedef started some kind of family feud when he ascended the throne. This would explain why any contemporary document mentioning him was destroyed, except for his statuette, which was already placed in Radjedef's pyramid as a grave good. It could also explain why Radjedef and Setka chose their own burial sites at a remarkable distance from the Giza necropolis.Margaret Bunson: Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt. Infobase Publishing, 2009, , p. 368. Dodson's theory is not commonly accepted, though. Egyptologists such as Rainer Stadelmann and George Reisner propose prince Baka as the owner of the unfinished pyramid. According to their theory, Baka (whose name was written with the signs of a ram and the Ka) simply used the original name form due his lifetime, but it was changed after his death into Bakar√™ (\\"soul and Ka of R√¢\\"). In ancient Greek chronics Baka's name was hellenized into Bikheris. For this reason, the unfinished tomb shaft at Zawyet el'Aryan is also called \\"Pyramid of Bikheris\\".Rainer Stadelmann: Die √Ñgyptischen Pyramiden: vom Ziegelbau zum Weltwunder ( = Kulturgeschichte der antiken Welt, vol. 30). von Zabern, Mainz 1985, , p. 77, 140-145.  Setka's statuette  Actually, Setka is known to scholars only by his statuette. It was found during the winter of 1901 by French archaeologist √âmile Chassinat in Abu Rawash, when he excavated the Pyramid of Djedefre. Today the statuette is on display at the Louvre museum at Paris under its inventory number E 12639. Setka's statuette is the eldest known model of the so-called seated scribe typus. The artifact is made of polished granite and 30 cm high, 23 cm wide and 17 cm deep. The figure is shown in a cross-legged position, holding a papyrus sheet in its lap and an imaginary writing bulrush. The podest of the statue is made of polished limestone, its surface is engraved with Setka's name and titles. The papyrus sheet is decorated with the title Bodily son of the king.Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.): Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids.

Founded by Ellie Laks in 1999, The Gentle Barn's mission is to provide sanctuary for abused animals who would not otherwise be able to find homes.  History  The Gentle Barn was founded in 1999 on a half-acre property in Tarzana, California. Jay Weiner, who is also Laks' husband, joined the organization in 2002. In 2003, the organization moved to a six-acre property at its current location in Santa Clarita. Laks cites a childhood love for animals as the inspiration for creating the sanctuary. She also credits animals with helping her heal after an abusive childhood. The organization began allowing visitors the same year it opened and later added animal-assisted therapy programs for disabled and special- needs children and at-risk youth, including inner-city gang members, drug addicts, and abused children. In 2012, The Gentle Barn took in 51 animals from the property of Roberto Celedon, a \\"backyard butcher\\" who was charged on 13 counts, including three felonies related to cruelty to animals. For its work in the case, The Gentle Barn was honored by Supervisor Michael D, Antonovich of the Fifth District of Los Angeles County. The Gentle Barn established additional sanctuaries in Dittmer, Missouri in 2017 and Christiana, Tennessee in 2018.  The sanctuary  The current six-acre property has horse and cow pastures, a barnyard for the smaller animals, and an organic vegetable garden. It currently houses 170 animals, including cows, horses, pigs, sheep, chickens, llamas, emus, cats, dogs, birds. The first cow rescued, Buddha, is often used for therapy sessions with quadriplegic children. Animals at The Gentle Barn are treated with a holistic approach, including acupuncture and veterinary chiropractic methods. The property is completely vegan and does not allow any food products derived from animals. The property is open for tours on Sundays. A separate facility, the Sun Chlorella Healing Center, is not open to the public and is used to treat the sickest and most traumatized animals. The Gentle Barn requires $50,000 a month to operate. Most of the funds come through the website, from individual donors, corporate grants, and foundations. Major donors include Ellen DeGeneres, Portia de Rossi, Hilary Swank, Kirstie Alley, Toyota, CBS, William Morris Endeavor, and Princess Cruises. Actress and animal activist Pamela Anderson has also visited The Gentle Barn to feed turkeys on Thanksgiving. In 2011, a lock of hair given by Justin Bieber to Ellen DeGeneres was auctioned for over $40,000, with all proceeds going to The Gentle Barn.

Built on a 370-acre working farm, it provided a means of support and education for disadvantaged boys starting in 1929. History Andrew Drumm, the founder of the Drumm Institute, was a successful cattle rancher who had made his fortune in California, Texas, and Oklahoma. Married but childless, he always helped the lesser privileged, especially children. The idea of the Institute was outlined in his will. His will described the creation of \\"a home, school and farm for orphaned or indigent boys.\\" Drumm died in 1919, but he had drawn up his will in 1912. Andrew Drumm acquired a farm in 1912 to form the basis of his plan to instill self-respect and agriculture skill in indigent boys that would come under the care of the institute. Issues with settling his estate after his death in 1919 delayed the opening of the institute until 1929. The Institute was self-supporting through a combination of the endowment from Andrew Drumm, and use of the farm output for food and revenue. The boys had farm and house chores to perform that matched their age and abilities, they and received a small allowance and any profit from their 4-H farm-based projects. The boys' education was a combination of schooling at the institute and well as off-site education at local schools. The institute hosted about 20 boys per year until 1944, when expanded facilities allowed an average of 35 per year, with another expansion in the 1960s leading to a peak of nearly 54 boys in 1970. Expansion in the 1970s, changes in child labor laws, state licensing requirements and additional regulations limited the institute's ability to be self-sustaining through production and preparation of home grown food. After several failed attempts at re-purposing, an agreement permitting the development of a golf course on the grounds provided a new source of revenue. The institute is currently known as the Drumm Farm Center for Children. One famous alumni of the institute, Richard Rhodes, wrote about his experiences there in his book A Hole in the World: An American Boyhood (1990). Historic district Andrew Drumm Institute was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 3, 2006. It is a historic district consisting of 10 contributing buildings, primarily the living quarters and classrooms for the boys. After the institute's change away from farming, many of the farm buildings and fencing deteriorated and were removed. A golf course has been built on 209 acres of the surrounding land.

Biography Frank Leverett was born on March 10, 1859 in Denmark, Iowa and was descended from a family that emigrated from Boston, Lincolnshire in 1663. Following an education in Denmark Academy from which he expected to become a farmer, Leverett taught in public schools for a year in 1878 before becoming an instructor in natural sciences at the academy for the following three years. Here he became interested in geology and so enrolled in Colorado College and subsequently Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts to study mineralogy and assaying, graduating with a bachelor of science from the latter in 1885. He then began work in a temporary job in Madison, Wisconsin working with the United States Geological Survey. Leverett continued as an assistant until 1890 when he was given the position of assistant geologist, before becoming a geologist in 1901 and a senior geologist in 1928, until his retirement in 1929. Between 1909 and 1929 Leverett was a lecturer in glacial geology at the University of Michigan, the institution which awarded him an honorary degree of doctor of science in 1930. Leverett was one of the leading authorities on Pleistocene glaciation and authored over 180 reports and papers. He was elected a fellow of both the Geological Society of America and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, becoming Vice President of the latter in 1928. Leverett married Frances Gibson on December 22, 1887, and later married Dorothy Park on December 18, 1895 after Gibson's death. He did not have children by either marriage. Leverett died on November 15, 1943 after a brief illness at his home in Ann Arbor, Michigan. A fortnight before his death a bust of Leverett was constructed by the sculptor Carleton Angell. The Leverett Glacier in Antarctica, Leverett Glacier in Greenland, Lake Leverett in Washington (since drained), and plant species Sigillaria leveretti were named after Frank Leverett.

It is located in the townland of Favor Royal Demesne, around east of Augher, close to the Irish border. It is within the parish of Errigal-Trough which is part of the historic barony of Clogher. History Portclare was granted, in 1613, by James I to Sir Thomas Ridgeway, a prominent figure in the plantation of Ulster. Samuel Lewis recorded Ridgeway's grants as comprising of arable land and extending over the present towns of Aughnacloy and Augher, including the districts of Lismore and Garvey, with all the intermediate country. In 1622 Ridgeway sold Portclare to Sir James Erskine, younger son of Alexander Erskine of Gogar. In 1665 the manor of Portclare was confirmed to the Erskines by Charles II, under the name Favour Royal. The estate was subsequently divided between Sir James Erskine's two granddaughters. Favour Royal comprises one part, while the other, lying to the west of Augher, is known as Spur Royal or Augher Castle. St Mary's, Portclare, on the Favour Royal Estate John Moutray married the Erskine heiress of Favour Royal, and the original house was built by them in 1670. In 1816 the Moutrays briefly employed a local boy, John Hughes, as an apprentice gardener - Hughes would go on to become the Catholic Archbishop of New York in 1842. The old house was destroyed in 1823 by an accidental fire, and was replaced with a larger structure by Captain John Corry Moutray of Castle Coole. Captain Moutray commissioned the architect John Hargrave to design the new building, which was completed in 1825 in a Tudor revival style. Captain Moutray also commissioned the building of a private chapel on the estate, consecrated on 3 July 1835, which is now the parish church of St Mary's, Portclare. Favour Royal continued to be the family home of the Moutrays until 1976, when the house, demesne and contents were sold. It was occupied until the 1990s but is now derelict. The demesne comprised of fertile and highly cultivated land, and is finely diversified and richly wooded. The house is situated on the bank of the River Blackwater, and is built of freestone found on the estate. It is embellished with a noble portico, and with elegant architectural details. The demesne includes an ornamental lake and an 18th-century walled garden, and is listed on the Register of Parks, Gardens and Demesnes of Special Historic Interest. More recently it has been planted with coniferous forestry by the Forest Service Northern Ireland. Favour Royal Forest is one of Ireland's Millennium Forest sites. Several planning applications were submitted for permission to restore Favour Royal as a hotel and golf course, but these expired, and the house was on the market in 2013.

It is sometimes classed as a subtype of speculative fiction. Examples include the novels The Celestine Prophecy The Alchemist, and Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah. The Book Industry Study Group's BISAC subject heading FIC039000 is \\"FICTION / Visionary & Metaphysical\\". Although similar themes and content occur in the literature of numerous cultures in many ages, the term \\"visionary fiction\\" was suggested by Ren√©e Weber, professor of philosophy at Rutgers University, and used by John Algeo in a 1982 article describing recent examples and earlier precursors. By the year 2000 it had recognition as a distinct genre. Contemporary authors have formed organizations like the Visionary Fiction Alliance to clearly define what the genre is and what works belong to this category, advocate the use of this term for all fiction of the determined type, and promote authorship and readership of this form of fiction.  Definitions  While the basic definition of Visionary Fiction‚Äîthe literary form that illustrates and demonstrates the process of growth in human consciousness‚Äîis now generally accepted, it remains an evolving genre with some controversy over what literature it includes. Following are some of the most frequently cited definitions, sometimes at variance with each other, which illustrate the range, historically and ideologically, of the term's usage.  \\"Visionary\\"  As a literary term, the word visionary is defined thus: \\"Visionary writing has the qualities of prophecy‚Äîperhaps it is apocalyptic in imagery, or it may be predictive in its insights, or it may contain a core of moral truth. Many of the Romantic poets (especially Blake) have been labeled visionary. Note that in its literary sense, visionary writing need not be religious in nature, though it frequently is.\\"  Carl Jung  In his 1929 lecture, \\"Psychology and Literature,\\" (also a chapter in Modern Man in Search of a Soul), psychologist Carl Jung divides all works of art into two distinct forms, psychological and visionary. \\"The psychological work of art always takes its materials from the vast real of conscious human experience‚Äîfrom the vivid foreground of life, we might say.\\" What is currently classified as mainstream or realism. \\"The latter [visionary] reverses all the conditions of the former [psychological]. The experience that furnishes the material for artistic expression is no longer familiar. It is a strange something that derives its existence from the hinterlands of man‚Äôs mind‚Äîthat suggests the abyss of time separating us from pre-human ages, or evokes a superhuman world of contrasting light and darkness.\\" Jung's model would classify all serious imaginative literature, including the classics like Homer, Virgil, and Beowulf, as Visionary Fiction.  Flo Keyes  In The Literature of Hope in the Middle Ages And Today, Flo Keyes endorses Jung's term, visionary fiction, while detailing the medieval romance's impact on modern Fantasy and Science Fiction: \\"Jung places greater value on what he calls visionary novels, novels in which fundamental human experiences are tapped and shaped and left to the individual to interpret. These visionary works are stories that break the bonds of everyday human experience.\\"  Michael Gurian  American author and social philosopher Michael Gurian, one of the first to promote the genre on the web, wrote: \\"'Visionary fiction' is fiction in which the expansion of the human mind drives the plot. Where science fiction is characterized by storytelling based in expanded use of science to drive narrative, visionary fiction is characterized by storytelling based in expanded use of mental ability to drive narrative.\\"  Visionary Fiction Alliance  The Visionary Fiction Alliance defines the term thus: \\"Visionary Fiction embraces spiritual and esoteric wisdom, often from ancient sources, and makes it relevant for our modern life. These gems of wisdom are brought forth in story form and in a way that readers can experience the wisdom from within themselves. It emphasizes and envisions humanity‚Äôs transition into evolved consciousness. While there is a strong theme, it in no way proselytizes or preaches. Visionary is a tone as well as a genre. The ‚Äòvisionary‚Äô element can technically be present in any genre and set in any time.\\"  Hal Zina Bennett  Visionary Fiction pioneer, Hal Zina Bennett describes the genre thus: \\"Visionary fiction often deals with the stuff that happens at the edge between inner and outer, glimpsing those moments when the ‚Äòthin veil‚Äô, the boundary between inner and outer worlds, dissolves or is at least briefly drawn away. Every moment of our lives there's some of that interchange between inner and outer, of course. Our ‚Äòvisionary fiction‚Äô focuses on that phenomenon itself. Stories written in this genre draw our attention to how our visions inform us and impact our lives... The ‚Äòvision‚Äô part of visionary fiction is the vehicle that carries us to the filmy veil separating our ability to know from what we can't know.\\" Visionary fiction, he concludes, generally acknowledges something bigger, limitless, actually, beyond what Aldous Huxley called the ‚Äòphenomenological‚Äô world.  Edward J. Ahearn  Edward J. Ahearn's definition in Visionary Fictions: Apocalyptic Writing from Blake to the Modern Age, is summarized thus on the book's jacket cover: \\"Visionary writers seek a personal way to explode the normal experience of the ‚Äòreal,‚Äô using prophetic visions, fantastic tales, insane rantings, surrealistic dreams, and drug- or sex-induced dislocations in their work. Their fiction expresses rebellion against all the values of Western civilization‚Äîpersonal, sexual, familial, religious, moral, societal, and political. Yet even though they are anti-realistic, they do react to specific aspects of modern reality, such as the recurring promise and failure of social revolution.\\" To some current VF authors, Ahearn's ‚Äúshock and awe‚Äù definition of VF may be extreme although it does provide an antidote against too saccharine an approach.  Inspirational fiction  The Wikipedia article inspirational fiction mentions Michael Gurian and others as promoting the term visionary fiction and cites it as \\"possibly a subgenre of inspirational fiction.\\"  Characteristics  An analysis of available sources cites the following characteristics as essential to Visionary Fiction, noting that such elements, like the definition of Visionary Fiction, intentionally remains fluid to accommodate innovation.  Growth in consciousness  The primary characteristic of VF, according to the Visionary Fiction Alliance: \\"Growth of consciousness is the central theme of the story and drives the protagonist, and/or other important characters.\\" In \\"The Altered State of Visionary Fiction,\\" Monty Joynes writes: \\"For me, the Visionary Fiction genre includes novels that deal with shifts in awareness that result in metaphysical understanding by the central characters. The plot of the novel is generally more concerned with internal experiences than with external.\\" Michael Gurian also makes it preeminent: \\"Visionary fiction is fiction in which the expansion of the human mind drives the plot.\\" All commentators on the basic nature of VF seem to agree that growth in consciousness is the hallmark of Visionary Fiction. In any credible story, the characters must change, but in VF this change is from the inside out rather than from outside in. Growth in consciousness dictates that Visionary Fiction be optimistic. With realism, birth inevitably results in death. In VF, death tends to rebirth at a higher level.  Reader experience  Visionary Fiction author Jodine Turner writes: \\"Visionary Fiction is like the legendary Celtic Immram (the mythical heroes‚Äô quest). The drama and tension of the characters‚Äô adventures is one layer of the tale. All of the usual elements of suspense, conflict, even romance and mystery, are interwoven in the plot. The other layer, deeper and more archetypal, is that mystical inner journey of spiritual awakening. In Visionary Fiction, esoteric wisdom is embedded in story so that the reader can actually experience it, instead of merely learning about it.\\" And author Margaret Duarte seconds this notion: \\"What separates VF from other speculative fiction is intention. Besides telling a good story, VF enlightens and encourages readers to expand their awareness of greater possibilities.\\" Visionary Fiction renders the reading experience interactive. Readers have progressed beyond where they can just be told (the authority paradigm); instead, the visionary model gives them the bare essentials and invites them to try it (the Gnostic or experiential model). The best VF is multi-layered to suit readers at different awareness levels.  Spiritual component  The VF Alliance definition states: \\"[Visionary Fiction] embraces spiritual and esoteric wisdom, often from ancient sources, and makes it relevant for our modern life.\\" Clearly differentiating itself from conventional religion and its associated genre, religious fiction, Visionary Fiction's spirituality is all-inclusive with an appeal that, according to the Visionary Fiction Alliance, \\"is universal in its worldview and scope.\\" Since it lacks this universal ingredient, spiritually-oriented fiction that highlights a single issue,(recovery, women's‚Äô rights, political reform), is not generally considered Visionary Fiction. VF's spiritual focus does not require it to have a \\"feel good\\" flavor. While Edward Ahearn's dark apocalyptic leaning in his definition may be extreme, it serves to remind that the spiritual conflicts addressed in VF are serious, existential, and often life-threatening in the process of becoming life changing.  Paranormal perceptions  The word visionary indicates an ability to perceive beyond the normal purview. Growth in consciousness implies transcending the five senses when assigning validity to an extrasensory experience. Monty Joynes states, \\"The work is also ‚Äòvisionary‚Äô in the aspect that the authors sometimes (or often) employ non- rational means such as dreams or extrasensory perceptions to develop the content of the book.\\" Michael Gurian is more emphatic about the inclusion of this element, stating that in VF such extraordinary phenomena \\"not only happen, but drive the plot and its characters (i.e. without these experiences, there would be no plot or character).\\" The VF Alliance maintains that VF \\"oftentimes uses reincarnation, dreams, visions, paranormal, psychic abilities, and other metaphysical plot devices.\\" In his article \\"Visionary Fiction: Rediscovering Ancient Paths to Truth,\\" Hal Zina Bennett addresses the use of paranormal elements in VF more mythically: \\"Like a shaman‚Äôs stories of the spirit world, where the spirits of animals, trees, sky, or the stars teach us how to live, visionary fiction introduces us to a reality beyond physical reality. They often carry us deep into a consciousness once thought to be the domain of seers, visionaries, oracles and psychics. The magic of this genre is the magic of human consciousness itself, our ability to see beneath the surface and create new visions of what our lives can be.\\" The use of a paranormal element does not make fiction automatically visionary. A detective story with a mentalist as the crime solver might only be considered visionary if it demonstrates how the psychic's gift produces a higher state of consciousness.  Distinguishing visionary fiction  Determining what is and what is not visionary fiction suffers all the ills of any classification system with the definition of genre in fiction being especially problematic. For the last century, the library profession has held fiction in endemic disdain, and both the Dewey Decimal Classification system and the Library of Congress Classification system assign all fiction to a narrow range of numbers without any further breakout into fiction type. Largely as a response to seller and buyer demand, an ad hoc fiction genre system emerged during the 20th century, although some of its labels remain loosely defined or duplicative. Nevertheless, in recent years visionary fiction has emerged sufficiently into a recognizable genre that it can now be distinguished from its ancestors and close relatives.  Mainstream fiction (realism)  As noted above, Carl Jung divided all serious literature between psychological and visionary. He further explains the fiction type he designated psychological, and thus not-visionary, as taking \\"its materials from the vast realm of conscious human experience‚Äîfrom the vivid foreground of life.\\" Flo Keyes elaborates: \\"In these works, the psychological components of the characters and their behavior have already been scrutinized by the author, and little room has been left for interpretation by the reader‚Ä¶ Mainstream fiction as described here would encompass everything from Madame Bovary to the latest Danielle Steel novel, all of which concentrate on revealing our psychological motivations and responses to us rather than letting us discover them for ourselves in our reactions to what we have read.\\" Today, we would substitute mainstream or realistic for psychological, and all such works are easily recognized as beyond the pale of visionary fiction.  Science fiction/fantasy  Works of fantasy by definition go apart from the world of the senses for story material, and thus are not mainstream or realistic. And, many works of speculative fiction/fantasy (paranormal, supernatural, utopian, dystopian, apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic, science fiction, magical realism, alternative history) have substance beyond the sensational and purpose beyond entertainment, some enough to be classified as VF. A rule of thumb to differentiate is given by author Margaret Duarte: \\"What separates VF from other speculative fiction is intention. Besides telling a good story, VF enlightens and encourages readers to expand their awareness of greater possibilities.\\" Comparing Science Fiction to VF, Michael Gurian says: \\"Visionary fiction is not science fiction, yet if a skeptic needs ‚Äòscientific proof‚Äô of the reality of the visionary landscape, it can be connected to the new neural sciences‚Äîneurobiology, neuropsychology, neurophysics. All visionary fiction is driven by new and uncanny experiences (mystical, spiritual and paranormal) in the neural web. The new sciences have shown us over the last three decades how vast and limitless is the increasing power of the human mind. As in so many eras of human life, where our science goes our literature follows.\\"  Religious/spiritual/new age fiction  Since visionary fiction concerns itself with consciousness and its evolution, it requires a spiritual component. However, as Gurian notes, it should not be equated with religious fiction: \\"Religious fiction is a phrase that generally means Christian fiction. The most famous examples would be the Left Behind series. In this kind of fiction, plot is driven by a religious topography. Whether Christian, Jewish, Hindu in base, religious fiction is a footnote to the already written topography of the religion itself.\\" He says it is also not the same as New Age Fiction: \\"Where religious literature is pre-structured by a religion, ‚Äònew age literature‚Äô tends to be the opposite: employing loose adventure formats which can be laden with personal wisdom teaching. The topography or structure of the narrative is not very important in new age literature: the teaching is most important.\\" Neither is it spiritual fiction: \\"I make a distinction between ‚Äòspiritual fiction‚Äô and ‚Äòvisionary fiction‚Äô that others may find to be too fine.... In spiritual fiction (as in new age literature), spirituality rather than mental ability drives the plot,\\" Gurian maintains. Given its spiritual component, VF works are often found in some combination with spiritual and new age fiction. Gurian recognizes this and qualifies himself by noting that \\"a lot of visionary fiction is very spiritual\\" and acknowledging that \\"in the publishing market, visionary fiction, spiritual fiction, new age fiction and even new age nonfiction all blur together for marketing purposes.\\" He predicts a clearer \\"distinction to be made over the next decades between novels that are written for the purpose of teaching spirituality and novels that are written about our growing mental abilities per se, with the story itself breaking new ground.\\" A rule of thumb to distinguish spiritual from visionary fiction: if the novel's spiritual focus is passive, that is, it features an external power (an institution, dogma, charismatic leader, practice, or talisman) that affects the individual, it is religious/New Age/spiritual fiction. If the focus is active with the spiritual power generated and motivated from within the individual and flowing outward to positively affect the environment, it is visionary fiction.  Metaphysical fiction  Although BISAC groups Visionary & Metaphysical together as a single Main Subject Category under Fiction, the genres are not identical. Metaphysical Fiction was originally identified with Philosophical fiction, \\"in which a significant proportion of the work is devoted to a discussion of the sort of questions normally addressed in discursive philosophy. These might include the function and role of society, the purpose of life, ethics or morals, the role of art in human lives, and the role of experience or reason in the development of knowledge.\\" Novels by Albert Camus, Herman Hesse, Philip K. Dick, Ayn Rand, and Umberto Eco are categorized as such. The classical term metaphysical has evolved to include a much larger and more perplexing world. Instead of focusing on nature and purpose, it is now used to describe the world of spirits, faith healing, crystals and other paranormal elements. The scope of Metaphysical Fiction, too, has been enlarged accordingly, thus moving it closer to the realm of VF. Still there is a distinction, which author Talia Newland makes: \\"Sometimes the terms are used synonymously but my understanding is that visionary fiction is more obviously ‚Äòspiritual‚Äô in nature, and that an individual's movement towards self-actualization is a primary theme. In metaphysical fiction, though the philosophy underlies the story, the story takes precedence over expression of the philosophy; in visionary fiction the expression of the philosophy is more important than the story. According to Karen Rider, \\"Metaphysical Fiction encompasses topics like energy healing, past lives, intuition...events or experiences that we may be able to subjectively experience or sense but cannot objectively measure or explain. In the narrative, metaphysical phenomenon is part of ordinary human experience in ways that create conflict for the characters, propelling the story forward to find out how will the character deal with these events.\\" Again the active/passive focus rule above can be used to differentiate the Metaphysical Fiction from VF although more genre-crossing can be expected. A June 2014 article on the Visionary Fiction Alliance website widely supported BISAC's marriage of the two genres into the single category: Visionary & Metaphysical.  Publishing and marketing = Publishing history  Prior to the 20-teens, visionary fiction as a genre experienced difficulty gaining a reputation as marketable with traditional publishers and thus dedicated shelf space in libraries and bookstores. This faltering on the way to popular acclaim may be intrinsic to the genre's content. Speaking of visionary fiction, which necessarily deals with uncomfortable material and challenges the reader to change his level of consciousness, Carl Jung noted, \\"The reading public for the most part repudiates this kind of writing‚Äîunless indeed it is coarsely sensational‚Äîand even the literary critic seems embarrassed by it.\\" Because it was not already in demand by agents and publishers, quality writers stayed with more popular genres, while VF and similar genres attracted a disproportionate number of authors (many from other professions) with brilliant ideas but inferior writing skills. A few such works, like James Redfield's Celestine Prophecy, did rocket up the best-seller lists, which may have misled authors to assume that a sublime message trumps amateur writing. Hal Zina Bennet says of such deficiencies: \\"What happens in most visionary fiction that I‚Äôve read over the years is that it gets burdened down by the author‚Äôs desire to get readers to believe what he or she believes. Characters disappear in the author‚Äôs message, which is another way of saying that they are two-dimensional, thinly disguised vehicles that simply recite the author‚Äôs beliefs.\\" Before 2000 a number of unsuccessful attempts were made to market VF as a distinct genre, most notably at Hampton Roads Publishing of which editor Bob Friedman said, \\"We tried mightily to get the retailing powers to start a visionary fiction shelf. We came close with Walden, but the suits at B&N;, alas, took the position of ‚Äòno one is coming into the store asking for visionary fiction‚Äô.\\" In 2003 author and social philosopher Michael Gurian launched the website visionaryfiction.org that defined VF in his terms and expressed his hope \\"that like-minded writers will create a visionary fiction writers association.\\" His effort failed to get any direct traction when Gurian had relax participation in favor of his professional pursuits. Nevertheless, credit his vision that inspired later efforts: \\"If this takes off, it opens new avenues for writers over the next generations. I envision a publishing culture in which my children and their children have access to visionary fiction in the same way that I‚Äîbecause of the hard work of previous generations‚Äîhave access to science fiction.\\"  Current status  BISAC categorization = The genre system that evolved ad hoc through the mid-20th century was finally formed into an organized but flexible classification system of Marketing Categories through the work of the Book Industry Study Group founded in 1975. This non-profit organization developed the BISAC (Book Industry Subject and Category) Subject Headings, now considered the industry standard and a requirement for participation in many book listing databases. While it is now considered best practice for publishers, manufacturers, suppliers, wholesalers, and retailers, and has gained ground in some libraries, its use is not yet universal. In the 2013 edition of BISAC, Visionary Fiction is assigned a first-level Main Subject Category (FIC039000 FICTION / Visionary & Metaphysical), thus giving the genre a specific slot in the coding scheme, which is gaining reflection in bookstore shelving and online classification schemes. = Conventional publishers = In December 2013 Len Vlahos, Executive Director of BISG, stated: \\"BISAC Subject Codes are a voluntary industry standard. Many, if not all, large retailers use the BISAC Codes as a basis for identifying content, but then augment those codes based on their own customer intelligence. The retailers consider this augmentation to be a kind of special sauce. This is, of course, one of the challenges of voluntary standards, but we‚Äôre still pleased at how widely adopted and used BISAC codes are.\\" The words voluntary and special sauce allow a latitude in categorization that could mean continued obscurity for VF titles if authors and agents continue to be publish under other more \\"popular\\" categories, as has been the practice. Barnes and Noble requires BISAC codes for all books, print and electronic, and yet on Barnesandnoble.com, neither Visionary Fiction nor Metaphysical Fiction appears in their category browser. Typing \\"visionary fiction\\" into the search box does bring up more than 7,000 results, but several items on the very first page are not even fiction. Thus the tendency to publish titles that are clearly VF labeled as a more popular or generic genre continues. Best-selling VF authors (Coelho, Redfield, etc.) are routinely shelved with Literature and Fiction. Lesser known authors may find themselves in the New Age section among mostly non-fiction titles. The few traditional publishers that directly solicit and encourage VF works tend to be small and unstable. = Online vendors = While online vendor, Amazon, claims to adhere to BISAC strictly, its print offerings are usually pre-coded by the publishers with results similar to the above. EBooks uploaded by the author also face hurdles during the categorization process. As Louisa Locke explains: \\"The ‚Äòcategories‚Äô Amazon offers when you upload your book to KDP are based on BISAC categories.... What authors find confusing is that Amazon converts the BISAC categories into the Amazon browsing-path categories and subcategories that show up in the Kindle store‚Äì‚Äìand the two are not always identical.\\" To find Visionary Fiction listed in Amazon's Categories, requires the path Books> Literature & Fiction> Genre Fiction> Religious and Inspirational> Visionary Fiction. Typing visionary fiction in the Search box brings up an unwieldy 8,000+ results. Smashwords, like Amazon, professes to follow BISAC, but Visionary Fiction does not appear at all in its listed Categories. = Cross genres and subgenres = The increased tendency of contemporary authors to cross genres, which increases the complexity of categorization, is especially evident with VF writers. Nevertheless, such hybrids, like Kate Atkinson‚Äôs Life after Life (historical and visionary), have proved popular and can produce unique effects. Computer-based systems, now used in brick-and-mortar stores and on-line, support multi-category classification and further refinement in grouping, such as key words, thus making the listing of a single title under several genres and subgenres possible. Since BISAC has not yet supplied the Visionary & Metaphysical Main Category with subcategories as it has done for other genres, all works of the two types are listed under the main heading without further differentiation. Until the BISAC Main Category is further refined, authors may use keywords to indicate subgenres for marketing and reader convenience. = Visionary Fiction Alliance = The Visionary Fiction Alliance (VFA) actively organizes and promotes the Visionary fiction genre. The VFA began as a web-ring formed in March 2012 by visionary authors Jodine Turner, Saleena Karim, and Shannan Sinclair, who joined forces to promote their genre via the Visionary Fiction Group at goodreads.com. The Visionary Fiction group expanded to 12 authors before the VFA website live in August 2012. By May 2014 the VFA had 36 member authors ranging from seasoned veterans to developing novices; most of these authors created links on VFA which lead to the authors' personal websites. The stated objective of the VFA reads: > As the world evolves away from the Newtonian model of the five senses to the > more evolved quantum model that includes the sense of spirit so resurgent > today, Visionary Fiction is rapidly becoming the genre of choice to express > that evolution and predict the breath-taking future that might follow the > anticipated leaps. Under its broader umbrella are now gathering works > previously classified as spiritual, metaphysical, or science fiction. The > VFA aims to provide a home base and central clearing house for readers, > writers, and researchers dedicated to this endeavor. Its purposes are stated as such: # Increase awareness of the genre # Help readers discover, explore, and enjoy Visionary Fiction # Mentor new writers who wish to explore this genre # Provide resources for writers of Visionary Fiction # Be a place where readers can find Visionary Fiction books and engage in discussion with the authors.  Scholarship = Major studies of visionary fiction  For an art and study ripe with implications for today's evolving personal and social milieu, formal studies of Visionary Fiction are few, even including university research papers. The following existing comprehensive works on the subject are relatively unknown, even to VF authors, although some have recently been highlighted on websites like that of the Visionary Fiction Alliance. = Carl Jung = Carl Jung, \\"Psychology and Literature\\" (1929 lecture), included in the volume Modern Man in Search of a Soul. Rather than the narrow subgenre it is often reduced to, Jung depicts Visionary Fiction as a super-genre that forms one of the two major divisions of artistic production: \\"I will call the one mode of artistic creation psychological, and the other visionary.\\" Jung's contribution to Visionary Fiction is highlighted in a two-part series \\"Carl Jung and Visionary Fiction.\\" = Flo Keyes = Flo Keyes, The Literature of Hope in the Middle Ages And Today (2006). This work explores the influence of medieval literature on modern fantasy literature as well as such literature's social function. Using Jungian theory, including his view of visionary fiction, it examines the connections between the genres and finds common ground among them in plots that often reflect the recurring cycle of life and the elements of psychological rather than literal realism. Works such as Malory's Le Morte D‚ÄôArthur, the Witch World series by Andre Norton, and More Than Human by Theodore Sturgeon are examined in depth. = Edward J. Ahearn = Edward J. Ahearn, Visionary Fictions: Apocalyptic Writing from Blake to the Modern Age (2011). Starting with the stark premise that visionary writers seek to explode the normal experience of the \\"real\\", through devices like prophetic visions, fantastic tales, insane rantings, surrealistic dreams, and drug- or sex- induced dislocations in their work, Ahearn explores the work of a wide variety of authors who have contributed to the genre from the late eighteenth century to the present day. Beginning with William Blake, he traces the evolution of the form in texts by authors including Novalis, Lautr√©amont, Breton, William Burroughs, and contemporary feminists Monique Wittig and Jamaica Kincaid, among others. = Paul Maltby = Paul Maltby, The Visionary Moment: A Postmodern Critique (2002). This study aims to debunk any objective base for the visionary experience in general. It critiques the metaphysics and ideology of the visionary moment as a convention in twentieth-century American fiction, from the standpoint of postmodernism. Draws on the works of Don DeLillo, Jack Kerouac, Saul Bellow, Flannery O‚ÄôConnor, Alice Walker, and William Faulkner. In turn his book has been castigated as a postmodern critique that \\"hardly deserves the name. Maltby's critique really issues from a particularly straitjacketed form of social constructionism.\\"  Additional studies  Increased interest in Visionary Fiction as a genre has prompted multiple articles and commentary on the web since 2000, with activity surging since 2012. Weighing in with posts or interviews are prominent authors Hal Zinna Bennett, Monty Joynes, Dean Koontz, and Peggy Payne. Studies into the visionary writing component in the Bible, Jewish and Christian literature, medieval epics (Keyes), romantic prose/poetry (Ahearn) as well as modern authorship appear on the web.  University courses  While some university programs, such as the James Gunn's Center for the Study of Science Fiction at Kansas University, have long adopted a visionary stance to the study of genre literature, courses in Visionary Fiction proper remain scarce with the subject normally addressed in general literature courses. However, this is changing as demonstrated by recent course descriptions such as \\"Women‚Äôs Visionary Literature\\" at Penn State, and \\"Visionary Literature: From Dante to Bob Dylan\\" at Canada's York University Educators like Dr. Mary Mackey, herself a best- selling Visionary author, continue to contribute to VF scholarship.  Awards and community = Awards  While a comprehensive contest that evaluates and awards Visionary Fiction offerings has not yet been established, various organizations bestow awards for VF as a category, usually chosen or submitted from a select field of authors. Additionally, titles that are mainly VF have received awards under categories other than VF in contests that did not have VF as a category. A limited sampling: Conducted annually, the Independent Publisher Book Awards honor the year's best independently published titles from around the world. Visionary Fiction is one of its categories. In 2014 the \\"IPPY\\" Award for VF went to Mystic Tea, by Rea Nolan Martin (Wiawaka Press). The Coalition of Visionary Resources (COVR) offers an annual award for Visionary Fiction. Pope Annalisa by Peter Canova received the Nautilus Book Award Gold Medal for Visionary Fiction. Jeffrey Small's debut novel The Breath of God won the 2012 Nautilus Book Award Gold Medal for best fiction and was hailed as \\"visionary fiction\\" by Library Journal. Kate Atkinson's Life after Life: a Novel, an innovative tale of reincarnation in World War II Britain, won the 2013 Goodreads Choice Awards for Historical Fiction.

He is known for his destroyed statuette. He is also subject of a theory that claims he was pharaoh of Egypt for a very short time. Thus, he might be identical to a scarcely known king named Bikheris.Thomas Schneider: Lexikon der Pharaonen. Albatros Verlag, D√ºsseldorf 2002, , p.91,  Identity  Baka was prince and son of pharaoh Djedefre. He lived and worked during the 4th Dynasty.

Since the names of three other sons of Djedefre, namely Setka, Harnit and Nykau-Djedefre, are archaeologically detected, these should be Baka's brothers or halfbrothers. The daughters of Djedefre, Hetepheres III and Neferhetepes, would be Baka's sisters or half-sisters. His mother is unknown, too. It could be one of Djedefre's wives, Khentetka or Hetepheres II, but this is highly uncertain.Aidan Dodson, Dyan Hilton: The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. The American University in Cairo Press, London 2004, , p. 52-61.Aidan Dodson: On the date of the unfinished pyramid of Zawyet el-Aryan. In: Discussion in Egyptology, vol. 3. University Press, Oxford (UK) 1985, p. 21‚Äì24.  Possible reign as pharaoh  According to Rainer Stadelmann and George Reisner, it is possible, that Baka was pharaoh in Egypt for a very short time (maybe one or two years). Their assumption is based on the so- called Unfinished Northern Pyramid of Zawyet el'Aryan, which is located at Zawyet el'Aryan. This unfinished pyramid shaft was abandoned shortly after beginning and only a dozen of black ink workmen's inscriptions were found. These provide a royal cartouche name, which remains partially illegible. The first sign can be identified as a Ka-sign, but the first (and former) sign was copied by the pyramid excavator so fuzzy, that it remains undecipherable. According to Stadelmann and Reisner, the first sign shows a walking ram, as it does in the birth name of the prince. Baka simply put his citizen name into a royal cartouche due his lifetime, but then the name was changed after his death into Bakar√™ (\\"soul and Ka of R√¢\\"). In ancient Greek chronics Baka's name was hellenized into Bikheris. For this reason, the unfinished tomb shaft at Zawyet el'Aryan is also called \\"Pyramid of Bikheris\\".Rainer Stadelmann: Die √Ñgyptischen Pyramiden: vom Ziegelbau zum Weltwunder ( = Kulturgeschichte der antiken Welt, vol. 30). von Zabern, Mainz 1985, , p. 77, 140-145. This theory is not commonly accepted, though. Aidan Dodson is convinced of the depiction of a sitting Seth-animal, reading the royal name as Seth-Ka (\\"Seth is mine Ka\\"). In this case, Setka had actually followed his father onto the throne.

Sacarello Limited, more commonly known as Sacarello's, is a coffee roasting family business and coffee shop/restaurant in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar. Originally Italian, the Sacarello family first established itself in Gibraltar in the late 19th century and, despite economic upheavals, has served the Rock for over 125 years. The Sacarellos have owned a merchant house at 57 Irish Town, on the corner of Tuckey's Lane, since 1906 which now houses their coffee shop. History=Italian origins The Sacarello name first established itself in Gibraltar with the arrival at Gibraltar Harbour of Giovanni Batista Sacarello, an Italian merchant. Giovanni was originally from Spotorno at the foot of Monte Saccarello near the Ligurian capital of Genoa, but had been based in the port city of Livorno as the captain of a brigantine. He led his ship through the major Mediterranean ports trading in wool and hides becoming a frequent visitor to Gibraltar where he met local Maria Dominica Bignone whom he married at the Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned in 1817. He was 27 and Maria was 20. Bignone was also of Ligurian descent with her family also hailing from Spotorno. Her surname also took its name from a nearby mountain, Monte Bignone. For this reason the Sacarello-Bignone marriage was to be known as the \\"Marriage of Two Mountains\\". However, the newlyweds did not immediately settle in Gibraltar. They left the Rock soon after the wedding, probably to go back to Livorno or elsewhere in Liguria. It was 1845 before Giovanni returned to the Rock's shores indefinitely, with Maria having made it back sooner. The marriage marked the start of the Sacarello family of Gibraltar. After having been settled in Gibraltar for some time, the couple's youngest son Francisco Felipe (born 26 June 1833) married Maria Magdalena Fava (born 1837). Their son Bartholomew Sacarello - better known as Bartolo - later founded the family business by establishing B. Sacarello Limited as a provisions merchant in 1888. Starting a family business Bartholomew and Josefa Sacarello with their children. Federico, eventual heir to the family business is seen sitting on his mother's knee Gibraltar has always had to import almost everything it consumes; this was no different in the late 19th century when Gibraltar was a British garrison with few civilians. Bartolo was able to take advantage of this fact by supplying the local population with all and sundry - \\"from safety matches to flour, from buckets of lard to spaghetti\\". By the turn of the 19th century, the business was the top provisions merchant in Gibraltar. Soon Bartolo expanded into the Spanish and Moroccan markets and before long became rather wealthy. He soon realised that the future of his business lay in coffee which over a few years became an increasingly profitable part of the business, perhaps from his dealing with Spain. In just a few years coffee had generally become big business in Gibraltar which was probably partly down to the profitable smuggling trade which had become part of daily life on the Rock. Coffee, as well as tobacco, were the two main exports historically smuggled across the land border from Gibraltar into Spain. In 1906 Bartolo purchased a merchant house designed by renown Italian architect, Giovanni Maria Boschetti, on the corner of Irish Town and Tuckey's Lane. Focus on coffee Gradually ditching his other imports, Bartolo focused on purchasing large quantities of the finest Arabica and Robusta coffee beans from Africa and South America. Once arrived in Gibraltar the beans would be roasted, blended and packaged in-house at the Irish Town merchant house into a variety of brands to suite different tastes. By this time coffee drinking was becoming increasingly popular and the streets in both Gibraltar and Campo de Gibraltar were teeming with caf√©s. Although coffee smuggling later declined and eventually ceased to be profitable, the business continued to prosper purely on local trade and Sacarello's brands would soon become famous in Gibraltar and southern Spain. Continuity through tough times Sign outside Sacarello's coffee shop Following the death of Bartolo, his wife Josefa encouraged their son Federico to take over the business at the young age of 17. Shortly after Federico took the helm, Spanish dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera, closed the frontier with Gibraltar in the 1920s making it harder to do business and maintain his widowed mother, brother and two sisters. This was the first of a repeating pattern of political obstacles which the family business would have to face from governments in Madrid. The next decade continued to be troublesome times for Gibraltar with the Spanish Civil War at its doorstep. The end of the war in 1939 reopened access to the Spanish market for Gibraltarian merchants. Commodities such as tobacco and coffee were scarce in the post civil war Spain and Federico, together with his younger brother Bartolo were able to sell vast quantities of coffee there. Their renown La Negrita brand became so popular in southern Spain that it was even mentioned in a famous chirigota, a satirical folksong so typical of the C√°diz Carnival. The Sacarellos were the first Gibraltarian family to purchase a Rolls-Royce which was testament to the wealth that the business had amassed. Federico did not marry until the mature age of 47. However, the marriage would eventually give fruit to four sons and the business continued to thrive under Federico's leadership until the frontier was shut once again by Spanish caudillo, Francisco Franco, in 1969. The latest frontier closure, which was to last 16 years, was to have a huge impact on the economy of Gibraltar especially in importation and exportation of goods. This meant drastic drops in coffee sales for Sacarello's. Nevertheless, the business weathered the economic storm and the eventual full re-opening of the frontier in 1985 (it had been opened in 1982 for pedestrians only) rekindled the demand for Sacarello's coffees in the Spanish hinterland as well as from tourists and the expanding retail and catering industry in Gibraltar. From merchant house to coffee shop Federico dedicated his entire working life to B. Sacarello Limited and following the hardships of the 1970s and early 80s two of his sons, Patrick and Richard, joined the family business and seeking to recover the business. in 1985 they hired the services of local heritage conservation architect, John Langdon, to design the conversion of the front warehouse in their centuries-old merchant house into a coffee shop while retaining the old coffee grinders and other machinery as original features. By 1994 the success of the new venture was such that the brothers sought to rehire Langdon to redesign and convert the remaining part of the warehouse into a kitchen with extended seating areas for customers. The Sacarello brothers agreed to an amicable split of the business in 2009 whereby the coffee shop/restaurant is managed by Patrick and Richard retained the coffee roasting wholesale/distribution company with its new warehouse at Mons Calpe Road on the North Mole. The coffee shop stocks all of Sacarello's coffees as well as top of the range wines, jams, marmalades, chocolates and teas. In 2013 Sacarello's celebrated its 125-year anniversary.

Archaeology Keyhole Sink, formerly called Box Canyon, is a few miles east of Williams off Route 66 in Kaibab National Forest, and can be accessed on foot by a short, unpaved pathway known as Keyhole Sink Trail. Archaeological research suggests that not many people actually lived in Keyhole Sink, and that it was mainly used as a sort of sacred rest stop for hunters and as a place for clan initiations. Surrounding the site for a radius of fifteen miles are remnants of pit house foundations. The petroglyphs, which were carved into volcanic basalt, date from between 700 and 1100 CE. Design elements include snakes, lizards, deer, and amorphous images.

Introduced in 2006, the Pinnacle is the successor of the Mack Vision. Currently, the product line is sold in the United States and Canada; in Venezuela and Peru, the Pinnacle is marketed as the Mack Vision Elite. Marketed primarily as a highway tractor, the Pinnacle is sold in a set-forward front-axle configuration (the set-back axle version has been replaced in the United States and Canada by the Mack Anthem). Mack assembles the Pinnacle in its Lehigh Valley Operations facility in Macungie, Pennsylvania.  Design  The Pinnacle is a long-hood conventional semi-tractor. Designed for local and regional use it usually has a day-cab but five sleepers, from a flat top to a hi-rise, are available. Roof faring, side shields, and skirts aerodynamic aids are offered. Commonly a 6x4 (3 axles, 2 powered) there are also 4x2 (2 axles, one powered) and 6x2 (4x2 with a third lift axle) models. Advanced electronics are used for engine and chassis controls, as well as maintenance. All trucks have ABS. Mack builds most of their components (engines, transmissions, and axles) to work together. Trucks can also be custom-designed with vendor components. Total loaded weight can be up to and over including trailers.  Engine  The Mack MP8 engine is the only engine used in the Pinnacle. It is a overhead cam turbocharged inline six-cylinder engine. It develops and of torque.  Transmissions  All Mack transmissions have aluminum cases and three countershafts. Multiple countershafts (Fullers have two) allows smaller countershaft gears to spread the load between them and allow easier shifting. Manual transmissions have five or six main gears, extra ratios are made with different combinations of ranges. Both Mack and Fuller have manual and automated shifting models. Allison transmissions are available as fully automatic only. Mack mDRIVE‚Ñ¢ automated manual is the base transmission. It has no clutch pedal and shifts itself on demand. The driver can override it but it is normally driven in \\"D\\". It can have 12, 13, or 14-speeds. Other Mack manual transmissions have 8-18 speeds. Fuller UltraShift‚Ñ¢automated shifting systems are available on all transmissions from 9- to 18-speeds. Allison RD series 5, 6, or 7-speed transmissions are available. The RDS is a fully automatic planetary gear transmission with a lock-up torque converter.  Frame  A ladder frame with beam axles is used. The front axle is set forward on semi- elliptical leaf springs. The set-back axle version was replaced by the Anthem in 2017 The base rear suspension is a Mack tandem (two powered axles) but other axle/suspension combinations are available. Wheelbases are from Meritor supplies S-cam air brakes, steering systems, driveshafts, and other components. Front air disc brakes are available.  Axles  Front axles are available with rating. Mack powered axles have the drive carrier on top of the housing. This lets the driveshafts be in line from the transmission to and between the axles at a higher level above the ground. With the higher level above the ground the driveshafts and u-joints are less prone to dirt and damage, important in on/off-road construction. The Twin Y air suspension is base. It has trailing arms that fork to the rear and attach to both the top and bottom of the axle. There is an air bag behind the axle. Each axle is sprung individually. They are rated at . The Camelback tandem (two powered axles) was offered in earlier models. This has multiple leaves mounted above the bogey pivot which curve down and under the axles. It was not offered after 2015. Vendor spring and air-ride axle/suspension combinations are rated up to .  Applications  The Pinnacle's set-forward front axle and high rectangular grille make it high drag and not well-suited for long-distance hauling. It is available with a sleeper but it is commonly used as a day cab for local and regional hauling, where local laws and conditions restrict length or affect weight distribution. The Pinnacle has the high ground clearance, strong chassis, and available components for on/off-road construction. It is suited for dump, flatbed, and lowboy use. On-highway markets for Mack are freight, bulk materials, and farm products like grain and livestock.

A substantial hit, it ran for more than a year and helped build Allen's reputation as a performer who could portray a comedic romantic lead as well as the neurotic persona for which he was best known at the time. The play became the basis for a 1972 film of the same name, starring Allen and directed by Herbert Ross. Plot The play is about a recently divorced film magazine writer, Allan Felix, who is trying to restart his romantic life. Eventually he falls in love (and has a brief affair) with Linda, the wife of his best friend, Dick. During the course of the play, he repeatedly seeks advice from the ghost of his idol, Humphrey Bogart, but eventually decides that he needs to be himself rather than imitating Bogart. Telling Linda that the right thing for her to do is to return to her husband, Felix quotes the famous lines that Bogart delivers to Ingrid Bergman in the last scene of Casablanca.

The first rail ambulance in Queensland, Australia was introduced in 1918, with the last withdrawn from service around 1990. The rail ambulance was usually a specially equipped petrol engined rail inspection trolley, funded by a local community, with a railway employee volunteering to drive it when necessary. The initials QATB stand for Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade. History Queensland is a vast, relatively unpopulated area, where providing services to remote communities in a cost-effective way has been a continual challenge. Railways were built from 1865, and in many areas provided the major form of transport until a significant road improvement program was commenced by the Queensland government from the 1960s. It was in this context that the mining community of Blair Athol introduced the first rail ambulance in 1918, in order to enable injured people to be transported to the nearest hospital at Clermont.Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge', Boolarong Publications 1990 The idea rapidly spread, with rail ambulances being introduced at Dalby (1919), Mount Mulligan (1920), Roma and Charleville (1922), Goondiwindi and Baralaba (1923), Cloncurry (1925) and Blackall (1941). Other towns known to have had a rail ambulance at some stage include Charters Towers, Pentland, Atherton, Ravenshoe and Millaa Millaa. The last rail ambulances were withdrawn in 1990 from Mareeba and Blackall, as by that stage road ambulance services were available through the State.

The first meeting took place in Nanjing on 11 February 2014 when Wang visited mainland China, the very first official contact between the two governments across the Taiwan Strait after the end of Chinese Civil War in 1949. The tour of Wang and his delegates lasted from 11 to 14 February in Nanjing and Shanghai. On 25‚Äì28 June 2014, Zhang paid a retrospective visit to Taiwan in order to rebuild ties in the aftermath of the Sunflower Movement. It was the highest PRC government official visit to Taiwan. However, due to protests which turned violent, Zhang shortened his trip by cancelling three public appearances at the last minute.China Official Cancels Appearances After Protests in Taiwan  Background  In October 2013, in a hotel lobby on the sidelines of the APEC Indonesia 2013 meetings in the Indonesian island of Bali, Wang met with Zhang Zhijun, a ground breaking historical meeting for the first time between leader of Taiwan Affairs Office and leader of Mainland Affairs Council, where the two addressed each other by each's official title. Both of them called on the establishment of a regular dialogue mechanism between their two agencies to enhance mutual understanding and facilitate cross-strait engagement. Wang was also invited by Zhang to visit mainland China. Prior to the first official meeting between Wang Yu-chi and Zhang Zhijun in Nanjing, Wang was not expected to sign any paper agreement with the Chinese mainland government as requested by the Legislative Yuan earlier on 11 January. On 12 June 2014, the MAC confirmed in a press conference of the four-day visit of Zhang Zhijun to Taiwan in end of June 2014. The TAO staff reportedly said that this trip would be conducted in the spirit of equality and dignity after Wang's visit to mainland China earlier on. It was reportedly that Zhang wishes to better understand the general perception of the Taiwanese people so that misunderstanding about mainland China can be reduced. Two days prior to Zhang's arrival in Taiwan, the MAC said that both sides would not discuss any highly sensitive political issues and would not sign any agreement or release any joint statement. The opposition Democratic Progressive Party demanded that the meeting to be conducted without any discussion about one China, one China framework and one country, two areas concepts or military mutual trust mechanism and peace treaties issues.  Wang Yu-chi's visit to mainland China = 11 February 2014  Departure to Nanjing = Speaking at Taoyuan International Airport in Taiwan before departure to Nanjing with a delegation of 20 people, Wang said that he hoped that this trip would be smooth and help to promote mutual understanding between the two sides. Upon arrival at Nanjing Lukou International Airport in Nanjing, Wang and his delegates were welcomed by Chen Yuanfeng, Deputy Director of Taiwan Affairs Office. = Wang Yu-chi and Zhang Zhijun meeting = At the Purple Palace Nanjing () before shaking hand, Wang referred Zhang as \\"TAO Director Zhang Zhijun\\" and Zhang referred Wang as \\"Minister Wang Yu-chi\\" without mentioning the name Mainland Affairs Council. However, mainland China's Xinhua News Agency referred Wang as the \\"Responsible Official of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council\\" () in its Chinese- language news or as the \\"Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Chief\\" in its English- language news. Upon meeting with Zhang which began at 2 p.m., both of them agreed on establishing a direct and regular communication channel between the two sides for future engagement under the 1992 Consensus. They also agreed on finding a solution for health insurance coverage aiming towards Taiwanese students studying in the mainland, on pragmatically establishing Straits Exchange Foundation and Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits offices in each other's territory and on studying the feasibility of allowing visits to detained person once offices have been established. Zhang said that the people on both sides across the Taiwan Strait belongs to one family, while Wang invited Zhang to visit Taiwan one day. In the evening at 8:00 p.m., Wang and Zhang held a closed-door meeting which was not open to reporters. They also didn't make any public statement prior to the meeting.  12 February 2014 Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum visit= Wang and delegates started the day by visiting the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and paid tribute to Sun Yat-sen. To climb the 392 steps leading to the tomb of Sun without a stop, an equivalent to 18-story building, Wang had earlier on practice on treadmill during the Chinese New Year. At 10:10 a.m., Wang and delegates reached the Festival Hall and bowed down three times to Sun statue. The 10:10 a.m. time was chosen to coincide with the Double Ten Day, the national day of the Republic of China which marked the starting date of Wuchang Uprising in Wuchang District, Hupeh Province. After paying tribute, speaking at the Bo'ai Square of the mausoleum, Wang made a remark about his visit by mentioning the Three Principles of the People and Five-Power Constitution which are practiced in Taiwan. He also mentioned the name Republic of China in his speech which has already been in existence for 103 years. TAO officials deliberately avoided Wang during his speech. =Nanjing University speech= In the afternoon after his visit to Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, speaking at Nanjing University to more than 200 students, Wang stressed the importance of youth exchanges in promoting the development of cross-strait relations. He called on people on both sides of the strait to keep carrying on Chinese traditional culture. He noted that there are still many differences between Taiwan and mainland China in terms of culture, society and education. He said however, as long as these differences can be treated pragmatically, more common ground and cooperation could be created. He also tactfully spoke about democracy.  13 February 2014  Shanghai think tank meeting = After arriving in Shanghai by Maglev from Shanghai Pudong International Airport, Wang and delegates joined a think tank on cross-strait relations with 14 scholars including the President of Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. Wang was referred as the head of an agency of Taiwan area. Wang responded that generally in the meeting, both leaders of MAC and TAO were referred as Chairman. However, he could understand the dilemma faced by Chinese mainland people in addressing such issues and he had seen some progresses recently. =Shanghai Media Group and Shanghai Television visit= After the meeting, Wang continued his trip to visit Shanghai Media Group and Shanghai Television. At Shanghai Television, Wang urged the Chinese mainland government to lift bans against certain Taiwanese websites to allow Chinese mainland people to see more shows, especially regarding Taiwanese films, TV programs and pop music. Responding to Wang's remark, the Taiwan Affairs Office said that they don't rule the Internet in mainland China, but rather \\"manage\\" it according with the existing law.  14 February 2014  Shanghai school for children of Taiwanese businessmen visit = Speaking in a forum at a school for children of Taiwanese businessmen in Shanghai, Wang said that his visit to Nanjing was aimed to build mutual understanding between both sides of the Taiwan Strait. He said that from his experience studying abroad, misunderstanding between people can caused by cultural differences, such that accepting differences and respecting other is something easy to understand but difficult to put into practice.

During the press conference following the meeting, the spokesperson of TAO conveyed a remark saying that both sides should be committed to develop and further consolidate the political foundation to continue cross-strait exchanges in various fields despite the recent twists and turns. On the MAC side, Wang made a remark saying that Zhang had responded positively to MAC proposal to reopen negotiations on certain controversial items in the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement signed last year provided that the agreement is first put into effect. Opposition parties accused the National Security Bureau and the police of reportedly breaking into a room of the Novotel Hotel without a search warrant to expel people they suspected would protest against Zhang, saying the act was a serious violation of human rights and an abuse of power.ÂºµÂøóËªçÊäµÂè∞ ÈáéË†ªÈ£ØÂ∫ó Ë∏πÈñÄË∂ïÁ§∫Â®ÅÊàøÂÆ¢Police evicted suspected protesters from hotel: DPP = Meetings with academics = In the evening, Zhang held a closed-door meeting with mostly pro-reunification activists, including New Revolutionary Alliance () President Hsu Li-nong and Shih Hsin University Professor Wang Hsiao-po.  26 June 2014  New Taipei tour and New Taipei Mayor meeting = Zhang started the day by visiting a group of veterans, mainland Chinese spouses of Taiwanese nationals and residents in Xizhi District, New Taipei City. He then continued his trip to an adult daycare in Tucheng District to have lunch with the elderly. In the afternoon, he met with New Taipei Mayor Eric Chu. Zhang expressed the hope for New Taipei City to continue deepen cooperation with mainland cities to create a win-win situation. Zhang added that he took New Taipei City as his first stop to learn about the construction of the city and learn the lives of the ordinary New Taipei citizens. Chu then accompanied Zhang to visit a public senior nursing center. After the meeting, he visited Vigor Kobo Bakery in Wugu District famous for its pineapple cakes where he sat down with several small and medium enterprises (SME) leaders accompanied by MAC Special Deputy Minister Chang Hsien-yao and Economic Development Director Yeh Hui-ching to listen and hear suggestions and ideas on promoting cross-strait economic and trade exchanges to benefit SME. In the evening, he visited a Taiwanese aborigines community in Wulai District and promised that he would do more to promote aboriginal villages in Taiwan as tourist destinations for Chinese mainland tourists visiting Taiwan. Around ten people wrapped in iron chains and ropes were arrested for trying to blockade the car of Zhang Zhijun.Taiwan protesters arrested trying to block Chinese official  27 June 2014  Kaohsiung Mayor meeting = Zhang visited Kaohsiung by Taiwan High Speed Rail on Friday morning and met with Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu at Grand Hi-lai Hotel. While not mentioning the word \\"democracy\\" explicitly, Zhang made a statement saying that Chinese mainland leaders know that Taiwanese people value their own system and that the mainland respects their choices of social system, values and way of life. Responding to Zhang's statement, Chen said that Zhang should regard all of the protests he encountered in Taiwan as \\"normal\\", as they are part of Taiwan's democratic system and that she appreciated Zhang's understanding of the situation. She also told Zhang about the anger of Taiwanese over the recent statement made by TAO spokesperson Fan Liqing that the future of Taiwan must be decided by all Chinese people, not only the Taiwanese. =I-Shou University Student meeting= At I-Shou University, Zhang, accompanied by officials from TAO and MAC, had a meeting with the chairperson of E United Group. The meeting was then followed by a gathering of 20 Taiwanese and Chinese mainland students from the university for 20 minutes followed by a lunch. Media was not allowed in the meeting. Zhang later remarked that he hopes Taiwanese students would have the opportunity to visit mainland China and see how the two sides are deeply rooted in common ancestry.ËàáÁæ©Â§ßÂ≠∏ÁîüÂ∫ßË´á 20ÂàÜÈêòÊâìÁôº He said that the mainland would like to share its economic achievements with Taiwan, rather than to swallow Taiwan's economy. =Fo Guang Shan visit= Zhang continued his trip to visit Fo Guang Shan, a famous Buddhist temple in Dashu District. Practitioners lined up from the entrance and waved flags to welcome him. The visit to this venue was the only visit in which Zhang did not encounter protesters. =Wang Yu-chi casual meeting= When Zhang arrived at a casual meeting with Wang Yu-chi at Sizihwan Sunset Beach Resort in Xiziwan, Gushan District in the evening around 8:10 pm, protesters organized by Taiwan Solidarity Union and Black Island National Youth Front greeted the motorcade by spraying white paint and throwing ghost money, shouting slogans such as \\"One Country on Each Side\\" and \\"Zhang Zhijun get out of here\\". The white paint did not hit Zhang but instead his body guards.ÂºµÂøóËªçËá≥Ë•øÂ≠êÁÅ£ ÈªëÂ≥∂Èùí‰∏üÁôΩÊºÜÁ†∏Ëªä There were at least 400 policemen and 66 special officers deployed to the site at that time. After Zhang had entered the building safely to meet Wang, MAC Deputy Minister Chang Hsien-yao appeared outside the venue in apparent anger. He criticized the council staff and demanded to speak with the police officer in charge in the insufficiency of police personnel at the site. Chang then started to order the police and SWAT to be standby the door. Zhang responded to the protest by saying such protest was normal and saying that Taiwanese society is plural with many diversity views, and that he believed that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should adhere to the path of peaceful development in cross-trait relations. Wang then told Zhang that people protesting to make their voice heard is part of the Taiwanese life, and that since he is the head of TAO, he must get used to it and understand Taiwan more, because the ROC government has been experiencing such protests everyday in life. 28 June 2014Hui- ming Elementary School for the Blind visit and Taichung Mayor meeting= In his last day trip to Taiwan, Zhang visited the Hui-ming Elementary School for the Blind in Taichung at noon where he had a chat with Taichung Mayor Jason Hu. Zhang also delivered a short speech at the school saying that he had made a wish during his visit to Fo Guang Shan at Kaohsiung hoping that both sides of the Taiwan Strait can resolve long-term issues gradually with wisdom and familial affection and jointly make contribution to revive the Chinese nation.

By avoiding the need for rebooting the system with a new kernel that contains the desired patches, kGraft aims to maximize the system uptime and availability. At the same time, kGraft allows kernel-related security updates to be applied without deferring them to scheduled downtimes. Internally, kGraft allows entire functions in a running kernel to be replaced with their patched versions, doing that safely by selectively using original versions of functions to ensure per-process consistency while the live patching is performed. kGraft is developed by SUSE, with its source code licensed under the terms of versions two and three of the GNU General Public License (GPL). In April 2014, kGraft was submitted for inclusion into the Linux kernel mainline, and the minimalistic foundations for live patching were merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 4.0, which was released on April 12, 2015. Internals Internally, kGraft consists of two parts the core kernel module executes the live patching mechanism by altering kernel's inner workings, while userspace utilities prepare individual hot patch kernel modules from source diffs. Live kernel patching is performed at the function level, meaning that kGraft can replace entire functions in the running kernel with their patched versions, while relying on the mechanisms and infrastructure established by ftrace to \\"route around\\" old versions of functions. No changes to the kernel's internal data structures are possible; however, security patches, which are one of the natural candidates to be used with kGraft, rarely contain changes to the kernel's data structures. While applying hot patches, kGraft does not require a running kernel to be stopped for patched versions of functions to be introduced into it. Instead of replacing functions atomically, kGraft provides consistent \\"world views\\" (or \\"universes\\") to userspace processes, kernel threads and interrupt handlers, which are monitored during their execution so the original versions of patched kernel functions can continue to be used. To accomplish that, kGraft maintains original versions of patched functions in a read-copy-update (RCU) fashion, and dynamically selects between the original and patched versions depending on which process, kernel thread or interrupt handler executes them. More specifically, original versions of functions continue to be usedat the time when a hot patch is appliedfor processes currently executing within the kernel space, for kernel threads until they reach their completion points, and for currently executing interrupt handlers. Due to its design, kGraft does not introduce additional latency while applying hot patches. As the downside, original versions of patched kernel functions may be required to be maintained for extended periods of time in case there are processes that remain for too long within the kernel space; for example, a process may wait for I/O on a network socket. Also, as both original and patched versions of functions are allowed to be executed in parallel, troubles may arise if they use kernel's internal data structures in different ways. History SUSE announced kGraft in January 2014 and released it publicly in March 2014 under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) for the kernel part, and under the terms of version 3 (GPLv3) for the userspace part. It was released shortly after Red Hat released its own live kernel patching implementation called kpatch. kGraft aims to become merged into the Linux kernel mainline, and it was submitted for the inclusion in April 2014. kGraft was made available for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 on November 18, 2014, as an additional feature called SUSE Linux Enterprise Live Patching. Minimalistic foundations for live kernel patching were merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 4.0, which was released on April 12, 2015. Those foundations, based primarily on the kernel's ftrace functionality, form a common core capable of supporting hot patching by both kGraft and kpatch, by providing an application programming interface (API) for kernel modules that contain hot patches and an application binary interface (ABI) for the userspace management utilities. However, the common core included into Linux kernel 4.0 supports only the x86 architecture and does not provide any mechanisms for ensuring function-level consistency while the hot patches are applied. Since April 2015, there is ongoing work on porting kGraft to the common live patching core provided by the Linux kernel mainline. However, implementation of the required function- level consistency mechanisms has been delayed because the call stacks provided by the Linux kernel may be unreliable in situations that involve assembly code without proper stack frames; as a result, the porting work remains in progress . In an attempt to improve the reliability of kernel's call stacks, a specialized sanity-check userspace utility has also been developed.

Internally, kpatch consists of two parts the core kernel module executes the live patching mechanism by altering kernel's inner workings, while a set of userspace utilities prepares individual hot patch kernel modules from source diffs and manages their application. Live kernel patching is performed at the function level, meaning that kpatch can replace entire functions in the running kernel with their patched versions by using facilities provided by ftrace to \\"route around\\" old versions of functions; that way, hot patches can also easily be undone. No changes to the kernel's internal data structures are possible; however, security patches, which are one of the natural candidates to be used with kpatch, rarely contain changes to the kernel's data structures. kpatch ensures that hot patches are applied atomically and safely by stopping all running processes while the hot patch is applied, and by ensuring that none of the stopped processes is running inside the functions that are to be patched. Such an approach simplifies the whole live patching mechanism and prevents certain issues associated with the way data structures are used by original and patched versions of functions. As the downside, this approach also leaves the possibility for a hot patch to fail, and introduces a small amount of latency required for stopping all running processes.

Plot The surrealist film shows repetitive imagery involving a string fashioned in a bizarre, almost spiderweb-like pattern over the hands of several individuals, most notably an unnamed young woman (Pajorita Matta) and an elderly gentleman (Duchamp). The film also shows a shadowy darkness and people filmed at odd angles, an exposed human heart, and other occult symbols and ritualistic imagery which evokes an unsettling and dream-like aura. Cast *Marcel Duchamp as The artist (uncredited) *Pajorita Matta as The girl (uncredited) Production The Witch's Cradle was written and directed by experimental filmmaker Maya Deren. The film was developed at a comparison between surrealists' defiance of time and space and that of medieval magicians and witches. Deren developed the film over a period of one month, lasting from August to September 1943. However, long after principal photography for the film commenced, she abandoned the project, leaving the film incomplete. Some of the film's outtakes were found and stored at the Anthology Film Archives, while several sequences that were shot appear to be lost.

A Coulombmeter is used in combination with a Faraday cup or a metal probe for taking charge measures of a material. A Nanocoulombmeter is a Coulombmeter that is capable of measuring electrostatic charge down to the accuracy of a fraction of a nanocoulomb (nC). Electrostatic charge on an object can be measured by placing it into the Faraday Cup. The charge is transferred to the cup and displayed on the meter's display. The Faraday Cup of the Coulombmeter has an outer, grounded metal shield that surrounds an inner electrode. The inner electrode, which is electrically isolated from the shield, is connected to a meter to measure the charge. In the field of semiconductor design, a coulombmeter consists of a meter used in combination with a metal probe tip to pinpoint locations of excess charge on for instance a semiconductor device. This application of a coulombmeter is useful because electrostatic discharge is a leading cause of failure in semiconductor chip designs, and may occur during the fabrication, inspection, assembly, and other processes. A coulombmeter allow this electrostatic buildup to be easily measured simply by applying the instrument's probe to its lead. The coulombmeter was devised in 1984 for the Revised Nuffield Advanced Physics course.Revised Nuffield Advanced Physics: Apparatus Guide by Mark Ellse, 1985, p59, Note: coulombmeter is typically written as a single word in order to avoid confusion with the measurement unit 'coulombs-meter' and also to make it easily searchable in scientific literature. Detection of electron and ion beams A nanocoulombmeter, in combination with a Faraday cup, can be used to detect and measure the beams emitted from electron guns and ion guns. The Faraday cup consists of a shielded cup with an aperture, which collects the kinetically active electrons or ions, and an output wire, which is connected to an nanocoulombmeter. The Faraday cup can be completely separate from the gun, or it can be part of an assembly mounted to the end of the electron/ion gun and manipulated remotely. Some Faraday cup assemblies include a phosphor screen as well. An array of small Faraday cups or a Faraday cup on mounted on a linear manipulator can be used to measure the distribution of the beam current across the spot; this shows the beam uniformity.

Background In 1884, the teenaged Anna Blythe met Sam Speas, a young railroad employee who lived at the boardinghouse in Boulder, Colorado, which was owned by Anna's mother, Mary Jane Blythe, and operated by Anna's sister and brother-in-law, Nellie and Joe McCabe. Sometimes called the \\"Belle of Boulder\\", Anna was tall and shapely and had wavy black hair and aquamarine eyes. Many young men in Boulder sought to court her. At seventeen on September 30, 1886, Anna married Sam Speas in Boulder; he was eleven years her senior. After a number of months, the young couple moved to Como, where Speas was promoted to engineer of the Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad, which was sold at foreclosure proceedings in 1889 to the Denver, Leadville and Gunnison Railway. Speas was often away from home on railroad business. As a housewife, Anna may have had difficulty adjusting to Como and turned to alcohol. The couple had three babies, all of whom died shortly after birth and are interred with a common marker at the Como Cemetery.Laura King Van Dusen, \\"The Short, Tragic Life of Anna Blythe Speas: Belle of Boulder, Suspected Criminal in Como, Dead in Denver at Twenty-eight\\", Historic Tales from Park County: Parked in the Past (Charleston, South Carolina: The History Press, 2013), , pp. 113-125. Life of unrest and tragedy In 1894, Anna and another woman, Lillian Kennedy Robinson, were charged as accessories to the shooting death of Town Marshal Adolph E. Cook of Como. At the time of the murder, Anna was at the residence of Levi J. Streeter, a single man and a shoemaker. A loud party was underway. Neither woman was accompanied by her husband. Robinson was divorced during the trial and reverted to the name Kennedy. Streeter was subsequently found guilty of the crime, but the women were acquitted in the trial held in the county seat of Fairplay, Colorado. Streeter claimed that he thought Cook was a robber and an intruder, and he therefore fired three shots at the marshal and then beat his skull with the handle of the revolver. Streeter was sentenced to be hanged in June 1894 at the Colorado State Penitentiary in Ca√±on City. The sentence was reduced to life imprisonment at hard labor, but he died not long afterwards in 1896. Speas provided legal counsel for his wife but shortly thereafter the two divorced on grounds of Anna's cruelty and alcoholism. Anna moved away from Como, never to return. After a time in Boulder, she spent the last years of her life in Denver, where she lived in a shack with an African American, Andrew Lyles. Her mother had begged her to return to Boulder, but she refused. On July 5, 1898, neighbors reported that Lyles severely beat Anna. Lyles and another man living at the house, John C. Motley, were arrested and charged with Anna's murder. But the autopsy report cites an internal abscess, pneumonia, and alcoholism as the cause of death, not the beating. Lyles, meanwhile, was immediately rearrested for criminal assault on a six- year-old girl. Aftermath A year after the divorce, Sam Speas married Ellen O'Leary, who worked at the Pacific Hotel, since the Como Eating House and Bed and Breakfast. Their three sons also became railroad engineers. Speas' granddaughter, Margaret Coel, wrote a book on his life, Goin' Railroading. Anna Blythe Speas is buried in an unmarked grave in Fairmount Cemetery in Denver. On May 13, 2011, Marshal Adolph Cook was inducted into the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, D.C. Earlier in 1999, he was inducted into the Colorado Law Enforcement Memorial. He is the only law enforcement officer from Park County to qualify for the posthumous honors. In 2012, the journalist Laura King Van Dusen of Como, who writes for The Flume, the newspaper in Fairplay, won first place for \\"Best Feature Story\\" from the Colorado Press Association. for her article on Anna Blythe Speas.

Argentina is home to the fourth largest Estonian community in the Americas, behind the United States, Canada and Brazil. Estonian immigration to Argentina began in the early twentieth century and continued after the Second World War. Despite not having arrived in large numbers as other nationalities, the Estonian presence was important, settling mainly in Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires Province and elsewhere within their new country.  History  Estonian immigrants who arrived in Argentina from Germany in 1949. Like their Baltic neighbours, Estonians have a significant diaspora, especially created after the Second World War. There are approximately 1,100,000 Estonians in the world, of which 930,000 live in Estonia representing 85% of the total, the remaining 15% is distributed primarily in Finland, the United States, Canada, Brazil, Sweden, and Russia. There are organised groups of Estonians in more than 20 countries such as Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, the United Kingdom, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and the United States.Estonian tastes and traditions.

A speech at the Estonian Society of Argentina in Buenos Aires by Estonian immigrant Allan Soonets Kippasto. In 1924, Estonians founded \\"The Estonian Society of Argentina\\" (, ), i.e., much earlier than in other countries with a larger number of Estonians. At the end of the second decade of the 20th century there were about 3,000 Estonians in Argentina. Today, about 1,500 Estonians reside in Argentina, who are mostly interested in the development of relations between Estonia and Argentina. In 2006, to meet the needs of Estonians living in Argentina, a consular mission was organised in Buenos Aires. During the mission, the consul of Estonia who resides in New York City held various consular services for local Estonians. The Estonian community in Buenos Aires consists of about 50 families with Estonian roots. Unfortunately, members of the younger generations have only a small knowledge of the Estonian language due to the preference for the Spanish language as their mother tongue.  Religion  Estonian Argentines with diplomats from Estonia.  Lutheran Church  Estonians, like other immigrants from Europe (as the Germans, Danes, Norwegians, Swedes, Finns, Latvians, etc.) brought with them to Argentina their Lutheran religion. The Estonian community led to the Evangelical Lutheran Congregation \\"The Reformation\\" () over 55 years ago. In the church, which belongs to the United Evangelical Lutheran Church in Argentina and Uruguay, masses were offered in Estonian language. In its 50th anniversary an exhibition of paintings, books and other items that evoke the Estonian cultural tradition was performed. The church is located in Olivos, Vicente L√≥pez, meters from the presidential residence on 1100 Malaver Street. On October 13, 1970 a public worship was held in the Temple with the German Congregation; this marked the beginning of the Parish Community Centre of Olivos. The service was held in three languages: Estonian, German and Spanish. It was expected that the Spanish language was a factor of unity among the churches.

Originally established by the Rand School of Social Science in New York City as a Socialist camp and summer school, Tamiment developed into a regular resort and later fell under private ownership. The Tamiment Playhouse entertained guests with weekly revues and served as a training ground for many prominent Broadway and TV performers and writers. Playhouse alumni have included Danny Kaye, Imogene Coca, Jerome Robbins, Carol Burnett, Woody Allen, Neil Simon, and many others. Tamiment was a popular resort for Jewish singles and has been referred to as \\"a progressive version of the Catskills...\\" and \\"...a pillar of the Poconos tourist industry.\\" The Tamiment golf course, designed by Robert Trent Jones, was ranked among the top 200 U. S. golf courses by Golf Digest magazine. The resort was liquidated in 2005 to make room for a residential condominium development. History=Background The Rand School of Social Science was a Socialist institution in New York City, founded in 1906 and governed by the American Socialist Society. The school enrolled five thousand students annually between 1910 and 1920 but often did not have enough capital to cover operating costs. In JSTOR The Lusk Committee, led by New York state senator Clayton Lusk, was investigating what it regarded as \\"subversive activities\\" and attempted to close the Rand School by injunction. The school fought and won a costly two-year battle to remain open but, in 1920, its operating capital was at an all-time low.Swanson, p. 153. Bertha Mailly, executive secretary of the Rand School, held many fundraisers and was credited for keeping the school afloat. She conceived of the idea of establishing a summer school and camp that would generate enough revenue to support both itself and the Rand School. In the summer of 1919 Mailly had visited Unity House in Bushkill, PA, a resort operated by a local chapter of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU). While she was there she learned that an adjoining 2,100 acre property was for sale, promptly made a deposit, and successfully raised the money to buy the land and establish a new camp. The facility was named Tamiment, an old Native American word for the area, and would be located less than one hundred miles from New York City. Establishment and development Camp Tamiment opened on June 21, 1921, and its first visitors were 65 members of Local Allentown, a Socialist party. The camp was designed \\"to diffuse a general knowledge of literature, art and science through the medium of lectures, publications, and dramatic performances.\\" It earned an operating profit in its first year and became self-sustaining after 1923. Between 1937 and 1956, Camp Tamiment funded between half and three-quarters of the Rand School's annual operating budget.Swanson, p. 154. In December 1922 Mailly referred to the camp as a \\"great aid and inspiration\\" for the Rand School. She said, \\"It enabled us to give the young men and women the thing they need, the joy of living to which they are entitled. They study with us. We teach them how to think in the right direction and in their leisure hours, we prove to them that we know how to play.\\" Camp Tamiment was described as \\"...the first attempt of Socialists and working people to make for themselves a place for rest, recreation and vacationing.\\" A corporation identified as the People's Educational Camp Society (PECS) was created for the purpose of operating the camp.Squeri, p. 132 Author Martha LaMonaco wrote, \\"Legally, the camp had been established as a separate entity from the school, but the two organizations shared both a common political and social ideology and numerous board members.\\" The PECS board had envisioned Camp Tamiment as a country summer school, but Mailly and manager Ben Josephson chose to turn the facility into a regular resort.Squeri, p. 133 Political subjects were progressively downplayed while swimming, tennis, and calisthenics became the most popular activities. Tamiment served as a destination for Jewish singles from the working and emerging middle class and would be referred to as \\"a progressive version of the Catskills...\\" The facility included a 90-acre lake and, in 1947, Tamiment opened an 18-hole golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones. The golf course has been ranked among the top 200 U. S. courses by Golf Digest magazine and, beginning in 1959, it was the site of an annual golf tournament hosted by prominent entertainer Danny Kaye. Josephson described the Tamiment facility as \\"a summer resort that has attained top rank in the field, outranking by far many of the privately owned vacation places in both beauty and business.\\" The camp did not consider itself just a recreational enterprise as it had educational and cultural programs. All of the profits were reinvested in the camp or donated to charitable or educational institutions. These factors allowed Camp Tamiment to have tax-exempt status, which significantly contributed to its success. Author Lawrence Squeri wrote, \\"Once Tamiment became a money-making resort, it also became a paradox. Ostensibly an institution devoted to the undermining of capitalism, it sought to make money in the best capitalist tradition.\\" In the 1950s, resort guests might not have been aware of Tamiment's political agenda as it was sponsoring seminars offsite in New York City.Squeri, p. 180 Later years and dissolution The government took notice of Tamiment's tax exemption and would later characterize it as \\"one of the largest, most modern, and most profitable resorts in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\\" In 1956 the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) revoked Tamiment's tax-exempt status, ruling that the People's Educational Camp Society's main business was running a summer resort for profit and that its social agenda was secondary.Squeri, p. 203 The camp decided to acquire the title to the Rand School's library, the Meyer London Memorial Library and Reading Room, in order to continue its tax exemption. On March 29, 1956, the PECS acquired the title and full ownership of both the Rand School and its library.LoMonaco, p. 172 (The PECS dissolved the Rand School while its library, renamed the Tamiment Institute Library, moved into the Bobst Library at New York University in 1973.)LoMonaco, p. 172Swanson, p. 148,154 After multiple court appeals, the PECS lost its case for tax-exemption, and in 1963 Tamiment's parent corporation had a tax bill of almost ninety thousand dollars. On September 18, 1963, Josephson recommended to the PECS board that the resort be sold, and on June 28, 1965, Camp Tamiment was acquired by a Delaware corporation in a multimillion-dollar deal. Squeri wrote, \\"Once PECS lost the encumbrance of a commercial enterprise, it quickly regained its tax free status.\\" At the time of the sale, Tamiment was described as \\"one of the largest resort hotels in the country...\\" and included over 150 buildings, over 300 employees, a theater that could seat 1,000 people, and a dining room that could seat 1,200. During the 1970s and 1980s, stars Joan Rivers, Frankie Valli, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Alan King, and Donny and Marie Osmond performed at Tamiment. Las Vegas entertainer Wayne Newton purchased the resort in 1982 for a reported $15 million and planned to make it the flagship property in a national chain of timeshare hotels. He sold Tamiment in 1987. Lawrence Squeri wrote in 2002 that the facility \\"no longer has the New York liberal Jewish flavor that made it unique.\\" In March 2005 Tamiment owner Suong Hong sold the resort for $64 million to developers Greystone Capital Partners of Paoli, Pennsylvania. The firm started auctioning off Tamiment's contents on May 14 with the intention of demolishing the resort buildings. As of 2011, Greystone was planning to build over 200 residential condominiums on the 2,200 acre property. At the time of its sale, Tamiment was considered \\"...a pillar of the Poconos tourist industry.\\" Tamiment Playhouse The original Tamiment Playhouse was a multi-purpose facility in the 1930s while a new theater opened on July 5, 1941.LoMonaco, pp. 99-100 LaMonaco wrote, \\"From all accounts, the theatre was not only beautiful but commodious, with 1,200 seats on a raked main floor and balcony. It was constructed almost entirely of wood cut at Pike County sawmills, with local fieldstone used on part of the exterior.\\"LoMonaco, pp. 99-100 Max Liebman became theater director at Tamiment in 1933LoMonaco, pp. 41-42 and created an original stage revue every Saturday night during the 10-week summer season. His shows combined music and dance with comedy, and the people Liebman hired included Danny Kaye, Sylvia Fine, Imogene Coca, Betty Garrett, Jules Munshin, Herbert Ross, and Jerome Robbins.Sweet, p. 75. The Broadway musical The Straw Hat Revue was based on his Tamiment revues from the 1939 season and had a large cast of Tamiment players.Sweet, p. 79. Liebman's last season at the playhouse was 1949LoMonaco, p. 114 and, during the 1950s, he directed the TV variety show Your Show of Shows, utilizing his Tamiment experience to put on a weekly live revue.Sweet, p. 76. He stated, \\"I was really preparing myself for television at Tamiment. I was doing what you might call television without cameras...\\" Tamiment Playhouse was referred to as the \\"Poconos boot camp for Broadway writers and performers.\\" Broadway and TV producers watched the shows there and recruited new talent. Performers Barbara Cook, Carol Burnett, Bea Arthur, Larry Kert, and others gained experience at Tamiment. Cook considered the playhouse to be a \\"very important step\\" for her, as she developed the confidence to perform on Broadway. Noted choreographer Robbins learned the importance of timing and acquired the skill to quickly assemble material at Tamiment. Composer Jerry Bock spent three summers there, which he said helped prepare him for the experience of reworking a musical in pre-Broadway tryouts. Bock stated, \\"‚Ä¶How do you get to Broadway? Practice, at Tamiment!\\" Neil Simon's first theater work were the sketches he wrote with his brother Danny Simon for Tamiment Playhouse shows. \\"Getting the job at Tamiment was my first exposure to writing for the stage,\\" Neil recalled, \\"and I knew as soon as I did that, it was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\\"LoMonaco, p. 130 Woody Allen acted and directed for the first time at Tamiment, where he also went from writing jokes to writing sketch comedy. Authors Willis Hall and Keith Waterhouse wrote, \\"Allen bemoaned the fact that he was not able to sell any of his Tamiment material, yet many of the ideas and themes formulated at Tamiment were seminal in terms of his later work...\\"Evanier, p. 96 Once Upon A Mattress was originally presented as a one-act musical at the Tamiment Playhouse in August 1958. The show had been written by resident Tamiment writers and was designed to accommodate the lead players there. After being a hit with hotel guests, Once Upon A Mattress was significantly expanded for Off-Broadway, later moved to Broadway, and became one of the most frequently produced musicals in the United States. The Tamiment Playhouse presented weekly summer revues until 1960, when audiences were dwindling. The theater was razed in 1976 to make space for meetings rooms and indoor tennis courts.LoMonaco, p. 173 ReferencesFurther reading * Jill P.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 71, based on 4 reviews.

Solutions to the nurse scheduling problem can be applied to constrained scheduling problems in other fields. The nurse scheduling problem has been studied since before 1969, and is known to have NP-hard complexity. General description The nurse scheduling problem involves the assignment of shifts and holidays to nurses. Each nurse has their own wishes and restrictions, as does the hospital. The problem is described as finding a schedule that both respects the constraints of the nurses and fulfills the objectives of the hospital. Conventionally, a nurse can work 3 shifts because nursing is shift work: * day shift * night shift * late night shift In this problem we must search for a solution satisfying as many wishes as possible while not compromising the needs of the hospital.  Constraints  There are two types of constraints: * hard constraints: if this constraint fails then the entire schedule is invalid. * soft constraints: it is desirable that these constraints are met but not meeting them does not make the schedule invalid. Some examples of constraints are: * A nurse does not work the day shift, night shift and late night shift on the same day (for obvious reasons). * A nurse may go on a holiday and will not work shifts during this time. * A nurse does not do a late night shift followed by a day shift the next day. * Two nurses dislike each other and thus cannot work on the same shift because of that. * One nurse is lazy and must be paired with a hard worker. * A shift requires a charge nurse. Hard constraints typically include a specification of shifts (e.g. morning, afternoon, and night), that each nurse should work no more than one shift per day, and that all patients should have nursing coverage. Differences in qualifications between nurses also create hard constraints. Soft constraints may include minimum and maximum numbers of shifts assigned to a given nurse in a given week, of hours worked per week, of days worked consecutively, of days off consecutively, and so on. The shift preferences of individual nurses may be treated as a soft constraint, or as a hard constraint.  Solutions  Solutions to the problem use a variety of techniques, including both mathematically exact solutions and a variety of heuristic solutions using decomposition, parallel computing, stochastic optimization, genetic algorithms, colony optimization, simulated annealing, quantum annealing Tabu search, and coordinate descent. Burke et al. (2004) summarised the state of art of academic research to the nurse rostering problem, including brief introductions of various then published solutions.

He is the first governor of Embu County in Kenya after winning on a TNA (The National Alliance) ticket in the Embu gubernatorial elections which was conducted in March 2013. He would later become the first Governor in Kenya to be impeached not once but twice but he successfully challenged the impeachment later and overwhelmingly Re elected in 2017 winning his 2nd term in office. He was a former member of parliament for Runyenjes Constituency from 2003 to 2007. Prior to becoming the governor of Embu county, he served as the chairman of the board of Kenya Airports Authority and led to its winning of the two most prestigious airport industry awards in 2011. Education He went to Muragari Primary School in Mukuuri (Runyenjes). He holds an MBA from the University of Hartford (US), postgraduate diploma in public management and rural development from the University of Connecticut (US) and a B.Sc. in political science from the Makerere University. Career He served as a district officer between 1976 and 1984 under the former Ministry of State for Provincial Administration and Internal Security. Impeachment He is the first Kenyan governor to be impeached in a highly disputed and political process, this was a decision that was made by the Kenyan senate. 39 senators voted yes,1 senator voted no and 1 abstained from voting during a motion that was conducted to ascertain whether the five Embu county assembly's allegations were right. The decision has been challenged in courts. There were also revelations that a politician from Mbeere side of the county bribed MCAs with a trip to Mombasa, to plan for the impeachment. Reinstated Kerugoya court has reinstated ousted Embu governor Wambora as of April 16, 2014, after declaring his impeachment null and void. The judges stated that, ‚Äúhad the Senate investigated Wambora's case, it would discover it was done in violation of the court order in the County Assembly.‚Äù Re-elected Wambora, who is widely regarded as the governor with the proverbial nine lives, was reelected Embu Governor for the second term on August 8, 2017. He garnered 97,544 votes against Lenny Kivuti's 96,597 while Kithinji Kiragu (PNU) emerged third with 50,590, with only one polling station not tallied. Former Transport Principal Secretary Cyrus Njiru was a distant fourth with 2,344, followed by Leonard Muriuki (Narc Kenya, 2,313) and Dr Njagi Kumantha (939 votes). Wambora, the Jubilee Party candidate, won by a huge margin in Runyenjes, attaining 53,345 votes against Kivuti's 9,048; and repeated the feat in Manyatta by scoring 32,403 while the outgoing senator had 14,835. His election was nullified in Embu High Court on 22 February 2018. The high court judge ordered for a fresh election.

It was started in 2014 with the reconstruction of the Belgrade Cooperative building, which was finished in June of the same year. It is the second largest mixed use complex under construction in Europe, just after Minsk Mir (Minsk World) worth 3.5 billion dollars. 6.000 apartments, seven hotels including W Hotel and St Regis, 2000 offices, the largest shopping mall in South East Europe and public buildings are planned for the area. It was announced on 15 March 2015 that the Phase I apartments in BW Residences, a residential development, will be launched for sale.

Standing at , this building is designed by the architectural firm, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Criticism Among Belgrade residents, there is a great deal of contempt for the project. The points criticised encompass the lacking of a public consultation process as well as the disconnect of the lifestyle of Belgrade's middle and upper classes on one hand and the target group of the developed apartments on the other hand. In addition to this, the intransparency and perceived backroom nature of the Belgrade Waterfront deal has caused real anger, expressed most visibly by the street protests organised by the movement Do not let Belgrade d(r)own, accusing the development of money laundering and corruption. In May 2016, thousands of people went on the street to protest against an incident where dozens of men with masks demolished buildings in the area, where the Belgrade Waterfront complex is planned to be built.

She is mentioned in the old Pali texts and Buddhist traditions, particularly in conjunction with the Buddha staying at her mango grove, Ambapali vana, which she later donated to his order and wherein he preached the famous Ambapalika Sutra.Ambapaali vana Pali dictionaryKhanna, p. 45Ambapaali Sutta Pali dictionary The legend of Amrapali originated in the Buddhist Jataka Tales some 1500 years ago. Early life Amrapali was born around 600-500 BCE, to Mahanama & an unknown mother. Etymologically, the variants on her name derive from a combination of two Sanskrit words: amra, meaning mango, and pallawa, meaning young leaves or sprouts. It is said that she was spontaneously born at the foot of a mango tree in one of the royal gardens in Vaishali ‚Äî hence her name. Even as a young maiden, Amrapali was exceptionally beautiful. It is said that a feudal lord by the name of Mahanaman was so enchanted by the young Amrapali's looks that he abandoned his kingdom and moved to Ambara village, a small hamlet in Vaishali presently in Muzaffarpur.  As a courtesan  Vaishali was the capital city of the Lichchavi clan, one of the eight Khattiya (Sanskrit Kshatriya) clans that had united to form the Vajjian confederacy. The king was elected by an electoral college consisting of princes and nobles from the Kshatriya clans. It was customary that the most beautiful women in the land, rather than marrying one man, dedicated themselves to the pleasure of many. Amrapali grew up to be a lady of extraordinary charm and grace, and was talented in many art forms. Many young nobles desired her company. When Manudev, king of Vaishali, saw Amrapali perform a dance in the city, he plotted to \\"own\\" her. He murdered Amrapali's childhood love and would-be-groom, Pushpakumar, on the day of their wedding, and afterwards made an official announcement declaring Amrapali as the 'bride' of Vaishali ‚Äî i.e. the Nagarvadhu. She was also bestowed with the title of Vaishali Janpad Kalayani, given to the most beautiful and talented girl of the kingdom for a period of seven years. Amrapali had the right to choose her lovers, but according to the aforementioned custom, she could not be committed to any one man. After being declared a Nagarvadhu, Amrapali also became the Rajanartiki or court dancer. Her talent and beauty attracted so many men that the glory of Vaishali during this period is often attributed to Amrapali's fame. Amrapali's price was fifty Karshapanas per night, and her treasury grew much larger than the treasuries of some kings. Legends associated with Amrapali = Amrapali and Bimbisara  Stories of her beauty travelled to the ears of Bimbisara, king of the hostile neighbouring kingdom of Magadha. He attacked Vaishali, and took refuge in Amrapali's house. Bimbisara was a good musician. Before long, Amrapali and Bimbisara fell in love. When she learned his true identity, Amrapali asked Bimbisara to leave and cease his war. Bimbisara, smitten with love, did as she asked. In the eyes of the people of Vaishali, this incident made him a coward. Later, Amrapali bore him a son named Vimala Kondanna. Ajatashatru, Bimbisara's son by Queen Chellana (according to Jaina traditions) or Queen Kosala Devi (according to Buddhist traditions), later invaded Vaishali due to a dispute with his brothers. He was so moved by her beauty that when Amrapali was imprisoned, he burned the whole of Vaishali. Almost everyone died in the massacre, except his beloved Amrapali, but when she saw the condition of her motherland, she renounced her love for him.  Amrapali and the Buddha  In Buddhist records, Amrapali is noted as having had the opportunity to serve food to the Buddha during his last visit to Vaishali, shortly before his death. Amrapali attended his sermon at a nearby grove and was so deeply moved by it that she invited him for a meal at her quarters. In other accounts, it is stated that the Buddha himself took shelter in her mango groves and was visited by Amrapali who paid her obeisance to him and then extended the invitation. He consented to her proposal with silence. On her way back, her chariot collided with that of the princely nobles of Vaishali who were also heading to invite the Buddha to dine with them. They berate her by calling her a 'mango-woman' and ask her, a woman of ill repute, to move aside and let her superiors pass. It is then that she announces that the Buddha was coming to her house for a meal. The princes were upset and offered her gold in return of the privilege of hosting the Buddha but she refuses. Buddha also turns them down, having already committed to Amrapali. Buddha recognised her beauty and advised his disciples to be mindful in her presence lest they become infatuated with her. Amrapali received the Buddha with her retinue in her grand residence which had been specially decorated for the occasion. It was no less than the palace of any king; such was the wealth she commanded. At the conclusion of the meal, she offered to the Buddha and his order her entire property including her groves which became the venue for several sermons on mindfulness. Soon thereafter, she renounced her position as courtesan, accepted the Buddhist way, and remained an active supporter of the Buddhist order. She dedicated her life to the service of the poor and the destitutes. On growing up, Amrapali's son, Vimala Kondanna also became a Buddhist monk and a renowned elder.  Attitudes towards courtesans in scriptures  The story of Amrapali is significant for understanding contemporary attitudes of courtesans. Though she received much fame as a talented artist, she was also berated by the noble princes of Vaishali by calling her 'ganika' (i.e.prostitute) which carried derogatory connotations. However, unlike them, Buddha did not share that kind of prejudice towards her. He ate at her residence and accepted her grove for the Buddhist order. This is often quoted as an example for his unbiased regard towards women. However, what has been noticed is that with the passage of time and as the Therigatha was collated, this bias also entered the Buddhist fold. Amrapali's possible alliance with Bimbisara has also survived mainly through an oral tradition and has not found its way into the Pali canon of Buddhism. This is because Bimbisara was a great royal patron of Buddhism and his links with Amrapali may throw a negative light on him. Amrapali's mention in the canon also focuses mostly on the later part of her life when she converted to Buddhism. However, records of Chinese travellers who came to India in search of Buddhist texts have made note of Amrapali's early life and her relationship with Bimbisara. The latter is found in the Chinese Recension of the Buddhist tripitaka. This narrative has been written in the Mahayana tradition and therefore did not have the onus of representing Bimbisara in a positive light. Hence, their relationship is highlighted. A third set of scriptures which refer to the story of Amrapali, and do so most elaborately, come from the Gilgit area of Kashmir and are therefore known as the Gilgit Manuscripts. These are the Tibetan-Sanskrit scriptures of the Mulasarvastivada branch of Buddhism which hold her in high esteem. However, the negative connotation of being a courtesan is still present. Thus, the cultural memory of a courtesan shows a complex pattern, varying across time and place. In popular culture * Amrapali has been the subject of three biographical films: Amrapali (1945) starring Sabita Devi, Jagdish Sethi, Prem Adeeb, Amrapali (1959) starring Supriya Devi as Amrapali and Asit Baran as King Ajatshatru, and Amrapali (1966), starring Vyjayanthimala as Amrapali and Sunil Dutt as King Ajatshatru. * Bollywood actress Hema Malini produced, directed, and starred in a television series called Women of India, which depicted the story of Amrapali.

Michalski (April 21, 1902 ‚Äì October 20, 1977) was an American machinist and politician from Milwaukee, Wisconsin who represented the 12th Milwaukee County Assembly district (the 12th and 14th Wards of the City of Milwaukee), succeeding Democrat Max Galasinski (who was successfully pursuing a seat in the Wisconsin State Senate). Michalski was a U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of Wisconsin form 1952 to December 31,1955, after which Michalski was elected Sheriff of Milwaukee. Michalski served as sheriff from 1956 to 1960 when George J. Witkowski was elected.  Background  Michalski was born on April 21, 1902, in Milwaukee, where at one time or another he attended public schools, parochial schools and night school. In 1918, he became an apprentice machinist, and continued in that profession, except for a brief time (September 1, 1933 - January 1, 1935) as an inspector for the State Athletic Commission. He worked for many years for Allis-Chalmers; and also worked part-time as a salesman of Essex and Hudson automobiles.Ohm, Howard F.; Bryhan, Leone G., eds.

He was the only member of the Assembly to specifically list his political affiliation as \\"Liberal Democrat\\" (the Democratic Party was not traditionally regarded as a liberal party in Wisconsin politics.) In 1936, he ran for a position on the Milwaukee Common Council; he would remain as an alderman for 16 years. (According to a 1960 study, Assembly salaries and benefits were so low that in Milwaukee County, positions on the County Board of Supervisors and the Common Council were considered more desirable than seats in the Assembly, and an average of 23% of Milwaukee legislators did not seek re-election. This pattern was not seen to hold to the same extent in the rest of the state, where local offices tended to pay less well.Hagensick, A.

Other organizations he has worked for include the Aga Khan Foundation and Tegemeo Institute of Agricultural Policy and Development (an institute of Egerton University). Some of the programs he implemented were funded by DFID, USAID, Ministries of Foreign Affairs in Netherlands and Finland, and NORAD, Norway. Politics In the 2013 general elections, Mvurya ran for Kwale governorship on an ODM ticket with Fatuma Achani as his running mate. His rivals were James Dena, Kassima Rigga Mambo, Simeon Mwero Mkalla and Mwarapayo Mohammed Mwachai. Mvurya won by more than half the votes cast. In May 2014, Mvurya ousted Nairobi governor Evans Kidero to become vice chairman of the Council of Governors.

She worked on African American history, social movements, labor and business history, and political economy. Her major works are World of Marcus Garvey: Race and Class in Modern Society, Running Steel, Running America: Race, Economy and the Decline of Liberalism, and Pivotal Decade: How the United States Traded Factories for Finance.  Life  Stein was born in Brooklyn, New York, where her parents were a stockbroker and a schoolteacher, attended James Madison High School, and graduated with honors from Vassar College in 1960. She received a Ph.D. in American Studies from Yale University in 1968.  Works  Stein's first book The World of Marcus Garvey addressed a major African American leader and movement, as well as his era, the early twentieth century up until the Great Depression. Harvard historian Nathan Huggins, writing in the American Historical Review, said Stein, writing on a subject that is often \\"overly heated... has written the most balanced and the most historically textured study of Garvey and his times.\\" Her second book, Running Steel, Running America placed race in the context of economy. Business History called it \\"[A] marvelous and important book, an immaculately researched, powerfully written analysis.\\" It \\"used the steel industry to chart the decline of liberalism\\" wrote the Law and History Review Her third book, Pivotal Decade addresses the decade of the 1970s. Stein asked \\"Why did the nation replace the assumptions that capital and labor should prosper together with an ethic claiming that the promotion of capital will eventually benefit labor.\\" \\"This book should be required reading for any- one seeking to understand how the economic re-structuring of the 1970s led to our current age of inequality,\\" wrote reviewer Shane Hamilton, from the Department of History at the University of Georgia. Stein was writing a book about the 1990s and the triumph of neoliberalism.  Academic activities  Stein was on the editorial board of the journal International Labor and Working Class History.

It was, at the time, the deadliest aircraft crash on Canadian soil. Aircraft and occupants Flagship New England was a Douglas C-54E-5-DO military transport aircraft that had been converted to a Douglas DC-4 civilian airliner; and was registered N90904. It had first flown in 1945 and had logged a total of 3,731 flight hours during its career. On 24 October 1945, it was with Flagship New England that American Overseas Airlines (AOA) launched international flight services. On the accident flight, the aircraft carried thirty-one passengers and a crew of eight. Most of the passengers were wives and children of U.S. servicemen stationed in Allied-occupied Germany. Flight and accident At 12:14 PM EST on 2 October, Flagship New England departed New York-LaGuardia Airport for a transatlantic commercial flight to Berlin, with stops in Gander, Newfoundland and Shannon, Ireland. However, poor weather conditions at Gander forced the flight crew to land at Stephenville Air Base in Newfoundland instead. In order to let the crew rest, the flight stopped at Stephenville for the next twelve hours. At 4:45 AM on 3 October, Flagship New England left the gate and was initially cleared to depart from runway 30; however, apparently unfavorable wind conditions prompted Stephenville Air Traffic Control to clear it for runway 07 instead. Overcast skies blocked out light from the moon and stars, rendering the terrain ahead unlit. Flights departing from runway 07 were supposed to make a right-hand turn immediately after take-off so as to avoid hilly terrain in line with the runway. However, the pilots of Flagship New England instead allowed the aircraft to continue going straight ahead after lifting off. At about 5:03 AM, some seven miles from the end of the runway, the aircraft hit a ridge at an elevation of about 1,160 feet and crashed, killing everyone on board. The investigation into the accident indicated the pilots' failure to change course, which led the aircraft across terrain over which sufficient clearance could not be gained, led to the crash.

It was directed by The Teng Chun, his first film to recognise native interests. Plot Han Nio is in love with Oey Koen Beng. However, Han Nio's mother - hoping for a rich son-in-law to feed her gambling habit - arranges for Han Nio to marry a rich young man named Lim Goan Tek. Though they have a daughter, their life together is unhappy, and ultimately Goan Tek accuses of Han Nio of stealing from him and runs her out of the house. She falls ill and dies soon afterwards, but not before meeting Koen Beng. Learning of how his former lover had been treated, Koen Beng seeks out Goan Tek. However, before he can have his revenge, Han Nio's brother Eng Swan - the real thief - shoots Goan Tek, killing him. Production Gadis jang Terdjoeal was produced and directed by The Teng Chun for his company, Java Industrial Film. He had made his directorial debut in 1931 with the film Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang, and his subsequent productions had been based on Chinese legends and targeted at ethnic Chinese audiences. Following Albert Balink's Pareh (Rice) in 1936, The realized the potential of native audiences and began directing works with more modern stories which suited their interests, although characters remained Chinese. The cast and crew of this black-and- white film is otherwise not recorded. Release and reception Gadis jang Terdjoeal was released around 1937. The film is likely lost. Movies were then shot on flammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. As such, American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

He is known for his book Noir Canada: Pillage, corruption et criminalit√© en Afrique and the legal proceedings that followed its publishing.  Biography  Deneault was born in Outaouais, Quebec. He has a research doctorate from Centre Marc Bloch, Berlin, and a PhD in philosophy from Paris 8 University under the supervision of Jacques Ranci√®re. His studies focused on philosophy from nineteenth-century Germany and twentieth-century France, particularly the work of Georg Simmel. He lives in Petite-Rivi√®re-de-l‚Äô√éle, and he teaches philosophy at the campus de la P√©ninsule acadienne de l‚ÄôUniversit√© de Moncton. https://www.ledevoir.com/lire/586152/essai-reveillez- vous-bande-de-colons He has written several books on topics related to international finance, globalization, transnational corporations, and corporate tax havens. In 1999, Deneault was a speaker on globalization at the Millennium Round of the World Trade Organization Conference in Seattle. The book Noir Canada: Pillage, corruption et criminalit√© en Afrique, written by Deneault, Delphine Abadie, and William Sacher, published in 2008 by Les √âditions √âcosoci√©t√© Inc., concerns the activities of Canadian mining companies in Africa.  Lawsuits  Following the publication of Noir Canada, mining company Barrick Gold sent √âcosoci√©t√© a threatening letter regarding alleged inaccuracies in the book's description of evictions at the Bulyanhulu Gold Mine in Tanzania in 1996. The book's launch was postponed as a result, but the publisher managed to distribute 1,700 copies. Barrick filed a $6-million lawsuit against the authors and the publisher for libel. The lawsuit has been considered by some to be a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP). On 12 August 2011 the Quebec Superior Court ruled that \\"Barrick seems to be trying to intimidate authors\\", that the suit was \\"seemingly abusive\\", and that Barrick must pay the authors and publisher $143,000 to prepare their defense. On 18 October 2011 Barrick, the authors, and the publisher reached an out-of-court settlement that included a payment to Barrick and ceasing publication of the book. Deneault told news media that the authors had agreed to the settlement in order to bring an end to the legal proceedings, so that they could \\"return to having our discussions back in the public sphere, instead of the courtroom\\". In May 2008 a coalition of Quebec organizations formed to push for anti-SLAPP legislation. The Barrick suit against √âcosoci√©t√© (which joined the coalition) helped bring awareness to the cause. On 4 June 2009 Quebec adopted an anti-SLAPP bill called \\"An Act to amend the Code of Civil Procedure to prevent improper use of the courts and promote freedom of expression and citizen participation in public debate\\". In June 2008 another mining company, Banro Corporation, sued the authors and publisher for allegedly defamatory content in Noir Canada, for $5 million. The prosecution took place in Ontario courts, despite the fact that less than 100 copies of the book were distributed in the province. The publisher appealed to the Supreme Court to repatriate the suit to Quebec, partly because of its newly adopted anti-SLAPP legislation, but was denied. In 2013, the proceedings ended with an out-of-court settlement that involved √âcosoci√©t√© paying compensation to Banro. In February 2010 Barrick Gold sent a letter threatening legal action to everyone involved in the book Imperial Canada Inc.: Legal Haven of Choice for the World's Mining Industries, an English translation of a book by Deneault and William Sacher, also about the Canadian mining industry.

Some authorities classify this oyster as Pinctada imbricata fucata (Gould, 1850). It is native to shallow waters in the Indo-Pacific region and is used in the culture of pearls. Description Pinctada fucata has two valves connected by a long straight hinge. The length of the shell is slightly greater than its width, and the latter is about 85% of the length of the hinge. The right valve is flatter than the left and there are hinge teeth in both valves. The anterior ear is larger than that in other members of the genus and there is a slit-like notch for the byssus threads to pass through at the junction of the ear and the rest of the shell. The posterior ear is large. The outer surface of the valves is scaly and reddish or golden brown with pale radiating streaks. The inner surface of the valve is lined with a thick layer of golden-yellow nacre with a metallic sheen. Distribution Pinctada fucata is native to the Indo- Pacific region. Its range includes the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, and coastal waters of India, China, Korea, Japan, and the Western Pacific Ocean. It has been introduced in coastal waters of Venezuela Biology Like other bivalve mollusks, Pinctada fucata is a filter feeder. Water enters the shell through an opening in the mantle, passes over the gills where food particles are filtered out and gas exchange takes place, and passes out through another opening. These pearl oysters feed on infusorians, foraminifers, radiolarians and other small planktonic organisms. The sexes are separate in Pinctada fucata and gametes are released into the sea where fertilisation takes place. In India, spawning peaks from June to September and again in November and December, during the monsoon periods. The developing larvae pass through a veliger stage and after about twenty-four days settle on the seabed and become juvenile oysters known as spat. Pearl culture Japan and Australia are the largest producers of cultured pearls. The process takes place within the tissues of living oysters, the species Pinctada fucata and Pteria penguin being mainly used for this purpose in Japan and Pinctada maxima in Australia. The oyster spat is grown in mesh baskets immersed in the sea for two or three years until large enough to seed. Then a tiny mother-of-pearl bead is inserted into the shell and layers of nacre become deposited around this. The oysters are kept in wire nets suspended from rafts while both oysters and pearls grow. Readiness for harvest is often determined by x-ray. Not only is the pearl gathered, but the nacre lining the inside of the valves of the shell is used in jewellery and in the manufacture of ornamental objects.

The financial security company provides consultation on wealth and asset income protection, education planning, retirement planning, investment advisory services, financial planning trust and private client services, estate planning and business planning. Its products include life insurance, permanent life insurance, disability income, and long-term care insurance; annuities; investments; and investment advisory products and services. Northwestern Mutual ranked No. 111 in the 2019 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue and is currently ranked No. 102 by total revenue and is in the top 50 by assets held. The firm distributes a portion of its earnings to eligible policyholders as annual dividends. History Northwestern Mutual was founded as the Mutual Life Insurance Company of the State of Wisconsin on March 2, 1857. Originally located in Janesville, Wisconsin, the fledgeling company relocated to Milwaukee in 1859. Shortly after, the company experienced its first two death claims, when an excursion train traveling from Janesville to Fond du Lac, Wisconsin derailed, killing 14 people, two of whom were policy owners. With losses amounting to $3,500 and having funds of only $2,000, company President Samuel Daggett and Treasurer Charles Nash personally borrowed the needed funds to pay the claims immediately. In 1864, the company paid its first dividends to policy owners. It again paid dividends in 1867 and 1870, and has done so annually since 1872. By 1865, it was operating throughout the Midwest and had entered the East coast, and the board of trustees changed the company‚Äôs name to The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company. For the first half of the 1900s, Northwestern Mutual focused on life insurance. In 1969, the company began offering disability insurance, and by the late 1970s a series of retirement annuities were available. In the 1990s, the company introduced long-term care insurance, and in 2000, the company changed its name to Northwestern Mutual. In 2015, Northwestern Mutual began construction of Northwestern Mutual Tower and Commons, which opened in 2017. Following the accident, the company saw a rapid increase in its sales and an expansion into new markets. By 1865, it was operating throughout the Midwest and had entered the market along the East coast. To reflect this increased presence, the board of trustees changed the company's name to The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 1864, the company paid its first dividends to policy owners. It again paid dividends in 1867 and 1870, and has done so annually since 1872. Throughout the early years of the 20th century, Northwestern Mutual focused on life insurance. At the same time, the company worked to increase its accountability. In 1907, company leaders invited policy owners who were not trustees to probe into finances for accountability. This unique tradition has continued to the present day; members of the Policy owners‚Äô Examining Committee have unrestricted access to evaluate Northwestern Mutual's operations, management and strategic plans independently. In 1969, the company began offering disability insurance. Less than a decade later, a series of retirement annuities were introduced for the employee benefits market. In the 1990s, the company saw further growth with the introduction of its long-term care insurance. In 2000, the company changed its name to reflect this broadening of its product offerings to just Northwestern Mutual. In 2001 the company continued to expand its product and service offerings by launching a wholly owned subsidiary known today as Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company (NMWMC), a federal savings bank. Through NMWMC, the company offers a range of financial planning products and services including investment management, fee-based financial planning, business retirement plans, and trust and private client services. In 2015 Northwestern Mutual began construction of Northwestern Mutual Tower and Commons; it opened in 2017.Northwestern Mutual Tower named Project of the Year in Milwaukee Business Journal Real Estate Awards Mark Kass, Milwaukee Business Journal, April 12, 2018 On March 25, 2015, Northwestern Mutual bought financial planning company LearnVest for over $250 million.

Design Nanoblocks are similar in design to a Lego brick but smaller, with the smallest brick being 4 mm √ó 4 mm √ó 5 mm. The bricks are the size of Kawada's Diablock line of bricks. The underside of the bricks are different from Lego bricks because they use a dividing flange, known as the double- ridged backing system, instead of the tube system that Lego employs. The bricks are made using ABS plastic and there are eleven different types, the biggest being an 8√ó2 brick and the smallest a single stud brick. Nanoblock sets typically include spare pieces.  Reception  Wired described Nanoblock as an affordable alternative to Lego, but noted the small pieces were easily lost.

She was unbeaten in three National Hunt Flat races including the Champion INH Flat Race and her first five over hurdles including the Royal Bond Novice Hurdle, Deloitte Novice Hurdle and Supreme Novices' Hurdle. She won the Irish Champion Hurdle but missed the whole of the next season through injury. In her final season she competed in steeplechases and won three times including the Powers Gold Cup and the Mildmay Novices' Chase. After retiring from racing she produced five foals before dying of horse colic at the age of nineteen. Background Like-A-Butterfly was a bay mare with no white markings bred in Ireland by P. J. McGee. he was sired by Montelimar, a lightly-campaigned son of Alleged who won the Gallinule Stakes in 1984 and became a very successful National Hunt stallion: his other progeny included the Grand National winners Hedgehunter and Monty's Pass. Her dam, Swifts Butterfly, was a poor racehorse who never finished better than third in thirteen attempts in 1990 and 1991. During her racing career, Like-A-Butterfly was owned by J. P. McManus and trained by the former flat race jockey Christy Roche at Coolaghknock Glebe, County Kildare. Racing career=2000/2001 National Hunt season: National Hunt Flat races Like-A-Butterfly did not race until the age of seven, when she began competing in National Hunt Flat races, also known as \\"Bumpers\\". On 7 January at Naas Racecourse she started even money favourite against twenty opponents in a two-mile event and won easily by eleven lengths from twenty opponents. Two weeks later at Leopardstown Racecourse moved up in distance to two and a quarter miles and started 4/9 favourite in a field of eight. Ridden as on her debut by Alan Crowe, she took the lead three furlongs from the finish and drew away to win by fifteen lengths. On 27 April, the mare was moved up in class for the Grade I paddypower.com Champion INH Flat Race in which she was ridden by the leading amateur jockey J T McNamara, Crowe being forced to miss the ride after sustaining a broken collar bone. Like A Butterfly started 11/8 favourite ahead of the previously unbeaten geldings Native Jack and Davenport Milenium. She was restrained by McNamara in the early stages before moving up to take the lead a furlong and a half from the finish and kept on well in the closing stages to win by one and a half lengths and three lengths from Davenport Milenium and the mare Spirit Leader. 2001/2002 National Hunt season: Novice Hurdles In the 2001/2002 season, Like-A-Butterfly competed in Novice hurdle races, beginning at Navan Racecourse in November. Ridden by Charlie Swan and starting the 4/7 favourite, she won by eight lengths from Rule Supreme, a gelding who went on to win the Hennessy Gold Cup in 2005. Swan partnered the mare again when she started 4/7 favourite for the Grade I Royal Bond Hurdle at Fairyhouse on 2 December. She took the lead three hurdles from the finish, went clear of her opponents, and won by four lengths from Sacundai, despite being eased down by Swan near the finish. At the end of the month she won again at Leopardstown, but had her closest race up to that time, prevailing by half a length from the five-year-old Pietro Vannucci. Like-A-Butterfly prepared for her first Cheltenham Festival with a run in the Grade II Deloitte and Touche Novice hurdle at Leopardstown on 10 February. She took the lead at the sixth hurdle and drew clear of her rivals in the closing stages to win by five lengths, with the unplaced runners including Beef or Salmon. On 12 March at Cheltenham Racecourse, the unbeaten mare started 7/4 favourite against twenty-seven opponents for the Grade I Gerrard Supreme Novices' Hurdle, with her main rival appearing to be the former flat racer Westender. Like-A- Butterfly led briefly in the early stages and then tracked Westender before regaining the lead two hurdles from the finish. She was overtaken by the Willie Mullins-trained Adamant Approach, but when that horse fell at the last she regained the lead and held off the renewed challenge of Westender to win by a neck. Like-A-Butterfly was unbeaten in eight races when he started favourite for the Grade I Menolly Homes Champion Novice Hurdle at Punchestown Racecourse on 24 April. She took the lead after the second last hurdle, but was soon overtaken and sustained her first defeat, finishing third behind Davenport Milenium and Thari. 2002/2003 National Hunt season: Hurdles Like-A-Butterfly made her debut in open competition when she was matched against the multiple Grade I winning gelding Limestone Lad in the Irish Champion Hurdle at Leopardstown on 26 January 2003. Swan tracked Limestone Lad for most of the race before taking the lead at the last hurdle. The gelding rallied strongly in the closing stages, but Like-A-Butterfly held on under pressure to win by a head. After the race, Swan commented \\"The mare is very quick and dug deep for me\\" and said that she \\"would have a big chance of taking the title\\". On 11 March at Cheltenham, the mare started 13/2 fourth choice in the betting for the Champion Hurdle behind Rhinestone Cowboy, Rooster Booster and Intersky Falcon. She was among the early leaders, but struggled in the second half of the race and eventually finished tenth behind Rooster Booster. On her final start of the season a month later she finished third behind Sacundai and Rooster Booster in the Aintree Hurdle. 2004/2005 National Hunt season: Steeplechases After missing the whole of the 2003/2004 season with a tendon injury, Like-A-Butterfly returned to compete in steeplechases in the following season. In her first appearance in more than nineteen months, she was ridden by Conor O'Dwyer and was an impressive four- length winner of a novice chase at Naas on 20 November. The mare started favourite for the Grade I Durkan New Homes Novice Chase at Leopardstown on 26 December, but dropped out of contention five fences from the finish and failed to complete the course for the only time in her career as O'Dwyer pulled her up before the second last. The mare was moved up to three miles for the Royal & SunAlliance Chase at the Cheltenham Festival in which she was ridden by A. P. McCoy. She moved up to challenge the leaders three fences from the finish but weakened from the last and finished fifth of the six finishers behind Trabolgan. On 29 March at Fairyhouse the mare dropped back in distance for the Grade I Powers Gold Cup over two and a half miles and started 7/2 favourite in a field of thirteen which included Davenport Milenium. Ridden by McCoy, she tracked the leader before challenging for the lead at the final fence and won by half a length from Forget The Past. Like-A-Butterfly's final appearance came at Aintree Racecourse on 8 April, when she started 6/1 third favourite for the Mildmay Novices' Chase over three miles and one furlong. McCoy restrained the mare in the early stages before moving up to take the lead approaching the last fence and winning by one and three quarter lengths from See You Sometime and the favourite L'Ami. Breeding record Like-A-Butterfly was retired from racing to become a broodmare for J. P. McManus's stud. She produced five foals: *Speckled Wood (bay filly, foaled 2008, sired by High Chaparral), winner of three races *All For Luck (bay filly, 2010, by High Chaparral), unraced *Unnamed filly, 2011, by Yeats *Unnamed colt, 2012, by Yeats *Unnamed colt, 2013, by Yeats Like-A-Butterfly died in February 2013 after contracting colic following the birth of her last foal.

The special is presented as a parody of self-help infomercials, advertising a four-step program for creating a digital avatar that acts as a backup of its host. The special is hosted by Alan Resnick as himself, and is presented by Dan Deacon. Both, along with O'Brien, are members of the Baltimore-based art collective Wham City, who co-produced the episode under their video production division, AB Video Solutions. The special aired on December 24, 2013 at 4 a.m. on Cartoon Network's late-night programming block, Adult Swim. The special was viewed by 926,000 viewers and received a Nielsen household rating of 0.7. Critical reception was positive, with both the humor and the performances receiving praise. Summary Alan Resnick (portrayed by himself), an emerging young tech expert and innovator, is introduced to the viewer. He tells the audience of his four-step program to create a digital avatar that acts as a backup of its host, granting \\"the secret to eternal life\\". He tells the audience of his past: two years ago, Resnick was banished to his couch after getting into a lovers' spat with his wife, Janet. He dreamt of himself in a foggy meadow with an attractive, nude young woman (portrayed by \\"MKNZ\\") who calls for him to engage in sex. He initially refuses, but then changes his mind, but before they are able to do so, he is shot with a gun by a nameless man (Ben O'Brien), which totally destroys his face. This gave him the idea to come up with a way to digitally back himself up. Two months pass, and he is able to create an \\"exact digital copy\\" of himself who calls himself \\"Teddy\\" (for unknown reasons). \\"Teddy\\", a floating avatar head, acts as the co-host for the remainder of the program, often interrupting Resnick's speech to talk about his \\"wife\\". Resnick goes on to explain the four steps behind his process: # Subjects are instructed to look in a mirror every night for five hours and observe their facial features, sketching what they recall while in the dark; subjects are then instructed to hang up said drawings around their house. # The subject comes over to Resnick's house, where blindingly bright patterns are projected into their eyes and face while they spin around. These patterns will be \\"queered\\" by their head form, generating three-point axes, which are then \\"booleaned\\" to generate a three-dimensional mesh of their head. Resnick then goes on to explain the \\"uncanny valley\\",Mori, M. (1970/2012). The uncanny valley (K. F. MacDorman & N. Kageki, Trans.). IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine, 19(2), 98‚Äì100. which leads him into his third step: # The avatars are put through a series of intensive \\"skin stress tests\\", including \\"ball tests\\", \\"wiggle tests\\" and \\"durability and tear testing\\". # Resnick comes into his subjects' house for two months to analyze their interests and personality types; he will ask \\"hundreds of personal questions\\" involving friends, furniture, romance, animals, food, events and touch. All the information will be scanned into the USB flash drive of the subject's computer, which makes the \\"brain\\" of their avatar. Various testimonials are then given; a widower and \\"textbook salesman\\" Ryan Syrell (Steve Izant) tells of the reconstruction of his wife Morgan and the creation of his own avatar. Jordan Card, an elderly woman, shows off her digital avatar, who insists that their room \\"is too cold.\\" Chester Gwazda (Caynen Couture), a young bedridden boy, says that it was his mother's (Michelle Word) idea, and that he would rather play football than go boogie boarding with his avatar. Concluding his seminar, Resnick thanks his audience and \\"Teddy\\", who speaks again of the love for his wife, shown to be a pink morphing sphere. A frustrated Resnick scolds his creation and informs the audience that his avatar is autonomous, and that he is being manipulative and disappointing. He reminds the viewer to purchase his program through the following informational screen.

The series was originally developed as a comedy sketch by Alan Resnick, as part of his comedy tours with the Baltimore-based art collective Wham City, best known for their work with Dan Deacon. The skit, first conceived in 2009 and roughly modeled after TED Talks, features Resnick telling the audience how to create a complete digital backup of himself. Long-time associate Ben O'Brien co-produced, directed and edited the special along with Resnick. In addition, both co-produced the episode under their video production division, AB Video Solutions. Resnick, along with set decorator Emma Alamo, transformed Resnick's house into the set of the special. The collective had pitched a Wham City television sitcom to Adult Swim before, but according to Resnick, the network insisted that \\"no one would ever watch more than one episode.\\" Resnick named Mr. Show with Bob and David, The Kids in the Hall and the Upright Citizens Brigade as influences on the special. Dave Hughes, creator of the series Off the Air, who had discussed with the group about developing a series, took note of Resnick's sketch and helped the collective develop it into an infomercial. After airing the special, Wham City featured the skit for their comedy tour of New York City. Resnick informed Network Awesome that they will probably not produce any more fake infomercials, and that O'Brien is working with the network to create something that viewers will \\"stumble on unintentionally.\\" Broadcast and reception Live Forever as You Are Now with Alan Resnick aired on December 24, 2013 at 4 a.m. on Adult Swim. It was the third in a series of infomercial parodies broadcast by the network, succeeding Broomshakalaka and For-Profit Online University. The early-morning timeslot was chosen since infomercials usually air during such hours. The special was published onto Adult Swim's YouTube channel the same day. The special was viewed by 926,000 viewers and received a Nielsen household rating of 0.7, meaning that approximately 0.7 percent of households with a television watched it. A web chat allowing users to converse with \\"Teddy\\" was created for the network's website. The special has received positive critical reception. In talking about Resnick with regards to the special, Baltimore City Paper Baynard Woods wrote that it \\"combines the traditional kind-of-creepy positivity of the infomercial host with the creepy techno-utopian positivity of a TED Talk's technologist.\\" He ultimately opined that the humor derived from \\"the disconnect between what Resnick claims‚Äîthat his avatar is a complete backup of himself‚Äîand the reality that it is not at all like him and is, in fact, extremely limited.\\" Ezra Lefko of What Weekly, another Baltimore-based publication, praised the special. In particular, he expressed his approval of seeing \\"success and national exposure for these talented artists.\\" Lea McLellan of Mountain Xpress called it \\"hilarious\\" and \\"a good representation of their bizarre comedic stylings.\\" See also * Paid Programming * You're Whole Explanatory notesReferencesExternal links * * Alan Resnick's official website (archived from the original on January 16, 2014) * Category:Adult Swim pilots and specials Category:2010s American television specials Category:2013 television specials Category:Infomercial parodies ","title":"Live Forever as You Are Now with Alan Resnick"},{"id":"41949133","text":"General Sir John Ross (18 March 1829 ‚Äì 5 January 1905) was a soldier of the British Army and the Bengal Army who fought in the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny and later commanded British forces in Canada.

Distribution  The woodland elaeocarpus is found in China (Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Zhejiang), Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam (Indochina).  Description  The tree is up to 15 m and is found in evergreen forests at altitudes comprised between 300 and 2000 m. The evergreen shiny leaves are oblanceolate. The greeny-white flowers are grouped in racemes and are followed by black olive-like fruit in autumn.  Uses  The fruits of the woodland elaeocarpus are edible. The oil from the seeds may be processed into soap or lubricants. The bark may be used as a source for dye. The wood does not resist water, so it is not considered good timber, but it is used for growing shiitake mushrooms.Woodland elaeocarpus at taipei-expopark.tw It is also planted along streets and in parks.

Formerly the administrator of the Philippines' National Food Authority (NFA), he was later appointed the Assistant Secretary for Project Planning & Development at the Philippine Department of Agriculture. Calayag grew up in the Philippines before emigrating to the United States, then later returned to the Philippines and became the NFA's head on the recommendation of Secretary of Agriculture Proceso Alcala. As NFA head, Calayag faced controversy and calls to step down in response to rising rice prices during his term, and in particular an April 2013 decision to import rice from Vietnam at a price which political opponents alleged was well above the market price at the time. He continued in the position until May 2014. He make nfa rice from 18 pesos per kilo to 32 pesos per kilo. Personal life and early career Calayag was born in San Pablo, Laguna to Nemesio Amat Calayag and Mauricia Bunquin Agbin in 1974. He graduated from Manuel Enverga University in Lucena City, and later moved to Washington state in the United States, where he completed a real estate professional course at the Rockwell Institute. Afterwards, he held a variety of jobs, including patient services specialist at the Swedish Medical Center, loan officer at the Bank of America, auditor of the Bellevue Sheraton Hotel, and customer relationship manager at KeyBank. He naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2009. He also worked as a congressional aide for Proceso Alcala. He later moved back to the Philippines. Shortly after regaining Philippine citizenship, Calayag renounced U.S. citizenship under the procedures set by the U.S. government. In August 2013, a notice confirming his loss of citizenship appeared in the U.S. government's Quarterly Publication of Individuals Who Have Chosen to Expatriate. He also began pursuing a Master's of Business Administration at De La Salle University in Manila. As head of the National Food Authority=Appointment On January 17, 2013, Calayag was appointed as NFA administrator ad interim to serve out the remaining six months of the term of Angelito Banayo, who resigned from the post to contest the May 2013 House of Representatives mid-term elections. Proceso Alcala, who had been appointed head of the Department of Agriculture, convinced Calayag to take up the post, and recommended him to President Benigno Aquino III. After Calayag's first term ended, he was re-appointed to the post on July 12. The Philippines is a net importer of rice; amidst a wider trend of governments in the Asia-Pacific region increasing their emergency grain stocks to guard against a repeat of panic-buying seen during the 2007‚Äì08 world food price crisis, Calayag indicated that the Philippines was aiming for self-sufficiency in food rather than continuing imports, and would invest in expansion and improvement of grain storage facilities. Rice importation controversy Nevertheless, Calayag also made the decision to import 187,000 metric tons of rice, and invited tenders from firms in ASEAN member countries; among them, only Thailand and Vietnam submitted bids, and so the NFA awarded the rice import contract to Vietnam's Southern Food Corp. This decision would prove controversial. Lawyer and political activist Argee Guevarra, a member of Sanlakas, was one of the early voices of criticism against Calayag. Guevarra made accusations of overpricing, stating in August 2013 that the P19,762 per metric ton price the NFA had paid for the rice was above both the Oryza Global Rice Price index for the period in question, as well as the prevailing Vietnamese market price of P15,480 per metric ton. As the controversy drew on, Guevarra also questioned whether Calayag was eligible to hold the position of head of the NFA, as its charter required that administrators be natural-born Philippine citizens; it was not clear whether Calayag's re-acquisition of Philippine citizenship under Republic Act 9225 and subsequent renunciation of U.S. citizenship would fall under this definition. A statement from the Office of the Executive Secretary responded that Calayag \\"has met all the qualifications necessary to hold his current position\\". A number of lawmakers urged Calayag to step down, including Speaker Feliciano Belmonte, Jr., Carlos Zarate of Bayan Muna, Jonathan dela Cruz of Abakada, and Fernando Hicap of Anakpawis. Hicap criticized Calayag's track record at the NFA, noting that the price of rice had risen to P40 to P45 per kilo under his tenure. Guevarra also became more vocal in his accusations, filing a plunder complaint against Calayag with the Office of the Ombudsman, and accusing Calayag and his boss Alcala of \\"coddling smugglers\\" and being part of a \\"Quezon mafia\\". Remainder of term During the rest of his tenure, Calayag worked to improve the agency's financial position and increase procurement volumes. On May 5, 2014, organizational restructuring ordered by President Aquino reassigned the National Food Authority, the Philippine Coconut Authority, the National Irrigation Administration, and the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority from the Department of Agriculture to the Office of the President, with Francis Pangilinan given oversight responsibilities for the four agencies in the newly created post of Presidential Assistant for Food Security and Agricultural Modernization. Calayag and PCA administrator Euclides G. Forbes then both chose to step down from their respective positions on May 8 in order to allow Pangilinan to appoint his own preferred candidates to head the agencies. Former San Miguel Foods president Arthur Juan was appointed to succeed Calayag in June 2014.https://www.rappler.com/nation/61448-new-nfa-pca- administrators-arthur-juan-romulo-arancon As Agriculture Assistant Secretary After his stint at the National Food Authority, Alcala appointed Calayag as Assistant Secretary for Project Planning and Development in mid-2014.

He trained and worked as a surgeon at The London Hospital. In 1901, Sherren agreed to surgically divide two nerves in the arm of colleague Henry Head so that they could study the evolution of Head's recovery. Sherren and Head published three books together, one of them also co-authored by W. H. R. Rivers. Sherren served with the War Office during World War I and rose to the rank of colonel. He was appointed a CBE designation in 1919. In London, his notable patients included author Florence Dugdale, the wife of Thomas Hardy. Sherren operated on Dugdale for a mass in her neck. In the mid-1920s, Sherren quit his hospital practice to become a ship's surgeon. He died in 1945 after an extended illness.

In 2013, she qualified for the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships, selected for the T54 100 m and 200 m, taking bronze in the former. Oliver has spina bifida. Career history Oliver, from Rastrick in Yorkshire, came to prominence as a sprint and mid- distance racer in 2009, medalling in several national race events. Her first major result came in the 2009 BWRA (British Wheelchair Racing Association) Championships in Gateshead when she won bronze in the 100m sprint and 400m race, at the age of sixteen. The following year she record two more podium finishes with another two third places, in the 100m and 200m sprints, at the 2010 BWRA Championship. She improved her results in the 2013 Championships with silver in both the 100m and 200m events. 2012 was a disappointing year for Oliver, as with hopes of qualifying for the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, she failed to record a successful qualifying time at the Paralympic World Cup. Despite posting a personal best at the Daniela Jutzeler Memorial in Switzerland earlier in the year she was unable to replicate the result at the 2012 BWRA Championships where she took gold in the 400m, but failed to medal in her favoured 100m and 200m sprint events. The 2013 season saw an improvement in Oliver's results when, at the BWRA Championships, she took gold in the 100m and 200m sprints and in the 400m and 800m. This saw her qualify for the British team for the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships in Lyon, competing in both the 100m and 200m sprints. At Lyon she qualified for the final of the 200m after finishing third in the heats with a personal best of 31.38s. In the final she finished seventh. Oliver fared better in the 100m, qualifying for the 100m final when she finished third recording a time of 17.93s. In the final she initially finished fourth, recording a personal best of 17.28s, but she was promoted to third place, winning the bronze medal after China's Liu Wenjun was disqualified. Her success in 2013 saw Oliver selected by British Athletics as an athlete with World Cup Podium Potential, ensuring funding for future events.

From 1956 to 1960 he studied at Yale University (New Haven, Connecticut). There he earned his PhD with the dissertation Generalized Convolution Algebras and Spectral Representations supervised by Cassius Ionescu-Tulcea. During 1960‚Äì61 he worked as a NATO Fellow at the Georg-August-University of G√∂ttingen (Germany). After lecturing as an instructor at the MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts he joined in 1963 the University of Maryland, College Park, (Maryland). There he worked, interrupted by guest professorships at the University of Frankfurt (in 1966‚Äì67 and 1970‚Äì71), until 1973, from 1969 on as a Full Professor. In 1973 Maltese moved to Germany where he accepted a position as a Full Professor for mathematics at the University of M√ºnster; there he worked until he retired in 1996. His research within the field of Functional analysis was concerned mainly with Harmonic analysis, the theory of Banach-algebras, integral representations in convex sets, and Korovkin theory. Maltese was guest professor at the University of Palermo in 1970‚Äì71, at the University of Bari in 1979, at the University of Kuwait in 1977, at the University of Bahrain in 1988‚Äì89 and at the University of Oman in 1990‚Äì91. The Mathematics Genealogy Project lists 17 PhD students of Maltese, among others Ferdinand Beckhoff (Habilitation in 1994) and Anand Srivastav (Professor of Computer Science at the Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel). Since 1987 he was a member of the Academia nazionale di szienze, lettere e arti di Palermo. Following his retirement Maltese went, together with his wife Marlene (n√©e Kunz) back to Middletown and the Wesleyan University.

The von Than coat of arms in the late 15th century Hyghalmen Roll (centre left). The roll was published in 1447‚Äì1455 in Cologne and is today in the possession of the College of Arms in London  Name  The name Dahn, Tan, Tann or Thann often occurs in these variations as a surname. For example, there is also a Franconian aristocratic family, the von Tanns. The person who is often named in the literature as the progenitor of the lords of Dahn, Anshelmus de Tannicka, is clearly not connected to the Palatine Dahns, but just bore a similar name.  Ministeriales of the bishops of Speyer  It is probable that the Dahns who resided in the southern Palatinate Forest had not migrated there from elsewhere, but were a long-established family. They appear several times in late 12th century records as imperial ministeriales, but later acted more often as ministeriales for the bishops of Speyer. A ministerialis was someone appointed to work for an important clerical or secular lord. They were originally unfree knights who were used by their masters to manage their estates. Some of them made careers in the management and administration for their masters and rose in social standing, leaving their former unfree status behind them. An old fief of the Dahns was mentioned in 1285, which the family was granted by the Bishopric of Speyer in Hinterweidenthal, near the town of Dahn and which came from the imperial abbey of Hornbach. It is therefore quite possible that the southwest Palatine or Wasgau Dahns originally came from the retinue of the abbey at Hornbach. This connexion may be the reason that the Dahns were initially employed as imperial ministeriales and then increasingly as ministeriales to the bishop.  Castles of Dahn  The castles of Dahn: View from Tanstein Castle rocks (foreground) over Grafendahn Castle to Altdahn Castle. Neudahn Castle from the south. The castle underwent its first major expansion in the early 16th century in order to protect it from artillery fire. In the foreground are the striking battery towers of this time To begin with, the family seat of the Dahns was probably Altdahn Castle. The first record of a castle seat on 3 May 1285, however, relates to Neudahn Castle (also enfeoffed by Speyer), as is evident from a list of the estates. The three castles at Dahn, especially Altdahn and Tanstein must have been older than that, however.Grathoff 2003 p. 6 Until 1327, all the castles on the ridge above Dahn were referred to as \\"Than Castle\\" (Burg Than); only later were they given separate names. Occasionally even Tanstein was referred to as Old Than (Alt-Than). In 1288, four knights of Dahn at the burg zu tan were mentioned in a deed: Conrad III Mursel, John I, Henry IV Sumer and Conrad IV of Dahn. The amount of space they needed must have been considerable, which is why all five castle rocks were built on; Altdahn and Tanstein probably being the oldest elements, hence why there are fewere references to them. Neudahn, which was built further away from the main castle group, was first mentioned in 1340 as nuwenburg zu Than. The early history of the ministeriales of Dahn is largely unclear due to the complex ownership and family relationships.Thon 2005 p. 113. The first known recipient of the Dahn fief was Frederick I of Dahn between 1198 and 1236. At that time the castle was already an episcopal enfeoffment. From Berwartstein Castle, which was close by, we know that Emperor Frederick I gifted it in 1152 to the Bishopric of Speyer as a reward for their support.Thon 2005 p. 31. This imperial castle (Reichsburg) thus became an episcopal fief-castle for the imperial ministeriales (Reichsministerialen) and, later, the ministeriales of the bishop. A similar situation may have pertained to the fief at Dahn.Grathoff 2003 p. 4. On the death of John I of Dahn in 1319 the family lost control over the third castle, Grafendahn, situated between Altdahn and Tanstein. After a feud over the inheritance the Bishop of Speyer re-enfeoffed the estate and it went to the counts of Sponheim. In the early 15th century the knights of Dahn ran into difficulties. John VII and his brother, Henry X, of Dahn refused to attack Tannenberg Castle with Count Palatine Rupert III because members of the family lived in the castle. The king had Neudahn Castle seized, although it was later returned. Henry XIII of Dahn zu Tanstein was a follower of Franz von Sickingen. In the wake of the Sickingen Feud, Tanstein Castle was occupied by troops from Electoral Trier and not returned until 1544. Towards the end of the Middle Ages the Dahn castles lost their significance and fell into ruins. Louis II of Dahn had a small schloss built in Burrweiler; this was first mentioned in 1571. Only a gate arch remains today.burrweiler.de The Dahns died out after Louis II of Dahn died in 1603 in Burrweiler. The fief then went back to the Bishopric of Speyer.  Coat of arms  Silver spoon with the coat of arms of the lords of Dahn (on the left as viewed) The von Tann coat of arms consists of three silver eagles (2:1) on a red field.Hans Ammerich: Das Bistum Speyer und seine Geschichte, Band 2: Von der Stauferzeit (1125) bis zum Beginn des 16.

Coat of arms of Bishop Conrad IV of Tann  The prince-bishop's coat of arms of Conrad IV of Tann as Bishop of Speyer (1233‚Äì1236) is usually quartered. The fields of the coat of arms alternate the family coat of arms of the von Tanns with the coat of arms of the Bishopric of Speyer, a silver cross on a blue field.

The series consists of four games, each with multiple downloadable content packs: Borderlands (2009), Borderlands 2 (2012), Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel (2014) by 2K Australia and Borderlands 3 (2019). Tales from the Borderlands (2014‚Äì2015) is a spin-off episodic graphic adventure game by Telltale Games. The series has received critical acclaim and commercial success for its loot-driven multiplayer co-op gameplay and its sense of humor. As of August 2019, more than 45 million copies of Borderlands games had been shipped, with 22 million from Borderlands 2. An additional 5 million copies of Borderlands 3 were sold within five days of release, bringing the total series' net revenues to over . This makes it one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time. A film adaptation of the series is in development by Lionsgate. Gameplay The main Borderlands games are first-person loot shooters, set in an open world, with some role-playing game elements. Players select one of the available characters, representing Vault Hunters that have traveled to the planet Pandora to try to seek its fabled Vault. Each Vault Hunter has a different skill tree and one or more unique abilities. Players then work on completing quests and exploring Pandora while dealing with the violent Pandora wildlife, crazed scavengers that have been stranded on the planet, and various military groups that attempt to stop them. Completing quests and defeating foes earns in-game money and experience, which is used for expanding the player's skill tree. If the player loses their health or falls into bottomless chasms, they respawn at the most recent checkpoint and lose some of their money. The games are divided into several maps, and once players have reached a waypoint station on the map, they can teleport to any other previously visited map. Otherwise, players must reach certain points on the edges of the map to move into a different area. Some maps allow the player to spawn an armed vehicle to help traverse large maps or to deal with more powerful enemies. A core feature of Borderlands is the loot system, which generates a variety of guns (such as pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, and rocket launchers), shield generators, grenade modifications, and class modifications. This equipment is randomly dropped by foes, found in containers around Pandora, or obtained as rewards for completing quests. The statistics of the equipment, such as the amount of damage and accuracy for a gun and special elemental attacks, are procedurally generated, and use a loot color-coding system similar to games like World of Warcraft to indicate rarity, ranging from white (most common), to purple and orange (most rare and powerful). The first Borderlands is credited by the Guinness Book of World Records to have over 17 million different possible guns that could be generated, while the latter games expand further on this. Other facets of the game use a similar procedural system: foes may have unique attributes and more powerful variants, such as creatures that can spit corrosive acid or flame, or scavengers with higher amounts of health and armor. Weapons and other equipment can be sold and bought at various vending machines scattered about the maps; nearly all vending machines include a rare piece of loot that is only available for a limited amount of in-game time, after which the machine's inventory is rotated for a new set of equipment. Borderlands 2, 3, and The Pre-Sequel! include the use of \\"SHIFT codes\\", which the player can obtain through social media or other promotions, and give players \\"golden keys\\" that can be used once to obtain an item of exceptional quality appropriate for the player's level; this feature was also added to the remaster of borderlands 1 As the player levels, the loot drops will become more powerful; at the same time, the enemies that the player faces on the map will increase in level as well. All three games feature a New Game Plus-type replay mode, where they can start with the same character at the same level they completed the game with, and continue to level up the character through the replay up to a fixed level, making the game more difficult. All three games support co-operative play for up to four people; the difficulty of the enemies as well as the quality of the loot drops scales with the number of players. In Borderlands 2 and in the Pre-Sequel, a \\"Badass Rank\\" system was added. By completing certain challenges, such as killing a number of enemies with a specific weapon type, the player would be awarded Badass points; for every 100 points, they can then redeem these for one of several small buffs to the player's attributes such as gun damage or shield capacity. Selecting the same buff repeatedly on redemption while using a given character would provide less beneficial rewards. However, these Badass buffs are shared by all characters that the player has so that if the player starts a new character, they will retain all the existing buffs, and new buffs when the points are redeemed will be more beneficial; the \\"Badass Rank\\" system has been replaced in borderlands 3 by the \\"guardian\\" system. All the games in the series use a comic book-like rendering approach, frequently mistaken as a cel-shaded technique. Instead, the games use fully realized hand-drawn textures and within the game engine, add noticeable outlines to create the appearance of a comic book setting. Plot=Setting The games in Borderlands primarily take place on the planet Pandora. Pandora is believed to be rich with mineral wealth leading several interstellar megacorporations to send colony ships there to capitalize on it, but once they arrive, they find little of value outside of undecipherable alien artifacts from a long-extinct race known as the Eridians, and numerous native lifeforms make it too dangerous. Many of the corporations abandon the planet, leaving behind their workforce, former prisoners coerced into employment, who take over much of the planet as bandits and raiders. However, a study of the alien artifacts leads to the discovery of mythical Eridian Vaults filled with untold treasure and wealth, which are guarded by extremely powerful and ancient monsters. Corporations and military forces return to the planet, along with a number of Vault Hunters who seek to find the Vaults themselves. The settings are expanded to include the moon of Pandora in Borderlands: The Pre-sequel, and other planets in Borderlands 3. Characters Several characters appear in multiple Borderlands games. The small yellow robot Claptrap (voiced by David Eddings, with Jim Foronda in Borderlands 3), the de facto mascot for the franchise, has appeared in all games as a non-player character (NPC) and in the Pre-Sequel as a playable character. The megalomaniacal CEO of the Hyperion Corporation, Handsome Jack (Dameon Clarke) is first encountered as the principal antagonist of Borderlands 2, while the Pre-Sequel features him as an NPC whose rise to power is assisted by the player. After his death at the end of Borderlands 2, Jack reappears in Tales from the Borderlands as an AI personality. The enigmatic \\"Angel\\" who guides the players through Borderlands (voiced by Jennifer Green, portrayed in the video by Brittani Johnson) is in the sequel revealed to be Jack's daughter. Handsome Jack's likeness also appears in Borderlands 3's \\"Moxxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot\\" DLC. In each main game, the player chooses one of several player characters ‚Äì \\"Vault Hunters\\" drawn to Pandora by the prospect of the alien riches contained within the Vaults ‚Äì but as the games support up to four-player co-op gameplay, their continuity presents these characters as having witnessed the events of each game together. The player characters of the first Borderlands appear as NPCs in the later games. They are Roland, a stoic soldier (voiced by Oliver Tull in Borderlands and Markus Lloyd in Borderlands 2), Lilith, a \\"Siren\\" with magical powers (Colleen Clinkenbeard), Mordecai, a hunter and sniper with a pet bird- of-prey (Julio Cedillo / Jason Liebrecht), and Brick, a strongman brawler (Marcus Mauldin). The main protagonists of Borderlands 2 are Axton, a renegade soldier (Robert McCollum), Maya, another Siren (Martha Harms), Salvador (John Swasey), a short-statured and short-tempered \\"gunzerker\\", and Zer0, an enigmatic masked assassin (Michael Turner). Through DLC, two additional characters were added: Gaige, the \\"Mechromancer\\" (Cherami Leigh), a young girl with a flying killer robot, and Krieg (Jason Douglas), a deranged wanderer with a split personality. All but two of the player characters of the Pre- Sequel appeared in earlier games as NPCs. Athena is a renegade assassin, and was encountered in a DLC campaign in Borderlands. Nisha Kadam (Stephanie Young), a bounty hunter and eventually Jack's girlfriend, goes on to be killed by the players in Borderlands 2 ‚Äì as does Wilhelm (Bryan Massey), a cyborg mercenary obsessed with transhumanism. The other two player characters of the Pre-Sequel, available through DLC, are Timothy (Dameon Clarke), a body double of Handsome Jack, and Lady Aurelia Hammerlock (Kenneisha Thompson), Alistair's sister and big game hunter. Tales from the Borderlands, set just after Borderlands 2, introduces two protagonists: the Hyperion company man Rhys (Troy Baker), and the con artist Fiona (Laura Bailey). Other characters introduced in Tales from the Borderlands include Vaughn (Chris Hardwick), Rhys's best friend and a Hyperion accountant; Sasha (Erin Yvette), Fiona's sister and fellow con-artist; Gortys (Ashley Johnson), an Atlas robot; and Felix (Norman Hall), Fiona and Sasha's father figure. Borderlands 3, set years after Tales from the Borderlands, features four new Vault Hunter protagonists: Amara, a Siren (Zehra Fazal); Moze, a gunner who pilots the mecha Iron Bear (Marissa Lenti); Zane, an operative with a variety of gadgets (Cian Berry); and FL4K, a robot beastmaster (Sung-Won Cho). The antagonists are Tyreen and Troy Calypso (Elisa Melendez and Max Mittelman). Also appearing across multiple games are several NPCs who act as vendors and quest-givers. They include the erratic researcher Patricia Tannis (Colleen Clinkenbeard), the garage owner and mechanic Scooter (Michael Neumann), Scooter's younger sister and mechanic Ellie (Jamie Marchi), the buxom bartender Mad Moxxi (Brina Palencia), the 13-year-old demolitions expert Tiny Tina (Ashly Burch), the gun company founder Mr. Torgue High-Five Flexington (Chris Rager), the gentleman hunter Sir Alistair Hammerlock (J. Michael Tatum), the junk dealer Janey Springs (Catherine Moore), the shady surgeon Dr. Zed (Ric Spiegel) and the gun merchant Marcus Kincaid (Bruce DuBose), who also narrates the opening cinematics. Synopsis Shortly after the Dahl corporation leaves the planet Pandora at the start of Borderlands, four Vault Hunters arrive to seek out the Vault ‚Äì Lilith, Roland, Brick, and Mordecai. They are guided by a mysterious entity, the Guardian Angel, that lives within the planet's communication EchoNet system, to collect pieces of the Vault Key, but warned that the Vault can only be accessed every 200 years, and that time is soon approaching, urging them onward. They eventually complete the Key, but immediately come into conflict with the Atlas corporation coming back to claim Pandora and the Vault. The Vault Hunters fight Atlas back and locate the Vault, but upon opening, it releases a giant monster, named the \\"Destroyer\\". They fight off the monster and push it back into the Vault, which then closes, leaving Pandora safe. In the Pre-Sequel, Jack, a low-level programmer for Hyperion, discovers another Vault on Pandora's moon, Elpis, and hires four more Vault Hunters, including Athena, to seek it in the wake of the First Vault's closure. With the Vault Hunters' help, Jack is able to seize control of Helios, the Hyperion space station in orbit between Pandora and Elpis, and uses its resources to secure the Vault with the help of the Hunters. Inside, there is only a strange artifact in the shape of the Vault symbol, but when Jack touches it, he experiences visions of the \\"Warrior\\"'s imminent release. Jack starts to go mad with power, and Lilith punches the artifact into his face, disfiguring him forever. Jack assumes his mask, becoming Handsome Jack, and takes over Hyperion as he swears vengeance on the Vault Hunters. In Borderlands 2, four new Hunters have arrived to find a new Vault that has been discovered on Pandora, but Handsome Jack uses his vast array of Hyperion resources to try to stop them. The new Hunters ‚Äì Axton, Maya, Zer0 and Salvador ‚Äì are aided by Roland and his former Vault Hunters, now leading a resistance known as the Crimson Raiders, secured in their base Sanctuary, and further guided by the Guardian Angel, who is revealed to be Jack's Siren daughter, dying from excessive usage of her powers. Jack had used Angel to trick the former Vault Hunters into opening the Vault on Pandora to gain access to Eridium, a special alien mineral with untold properties. After The Vault Hunters kill Angel in an act of mercy and to disrupt Jack's plan, Jack appears in Angel's chamber and proceeds to kill Roland. Lilith teleports The Vault Hunters to safety before being captured by Jack and used to finish charging the Vault Key. While they find the Vault, Jack arrives and joins them as they open it, and he summons forth the gigantic Warrior, which he wants to use to control Pandora and beyond. The Vault Hunters defeat the Warrior and leave Jack to his death before discovering that the Vault Key contains a map leading to Vaults across the galaxy, with Lilith stating 'there's no rest for the wicked'. As more DLC has been released since the Borderlands 2 has been released, the number of \\"new\\" vault hunters is 6, to include Gaige and Krieg. Sometime after these events, in Tales of the Borderlands, the absence of Jack's control leaves a power void on both Pandora and Hyperion. A Hyperion lackey, Rhys, and a con artist Fiona get caught up in events over the sale of a fake Vault Key to Rhys' superior for ten million dollars. They discover that there is another vault, the Vault of the Traveler, controlled by an Atlas prototype robot named Gortys. As they collect the scattered parts of Gortys, Rhys inadvertently downloads an AI copy of Handsome Jack's personality into his cybernetic mind. Rhys and Fiona's group makes to Helios in a makeshift spacecraft, and Scooter sacrifices himself to assure they get there. Once back on Helios, Jack takes over the entire station. Rhys and Fiona stop Jack and cause the station to crash into Pandora, wiping out Jack's personality for good. After going their separate ways for a while, They reunite to help defeat the Traveler, another giant Vault monster, freeing Gortys and leaving the Vault to be explored. Borderlands 3 follows 7 years after the events of Borderlands 2 and Tales. After being forced to destroy Sanctuary to protect Pandora from a doomsday plot by former Dahl commander, Colonel Hector, Lilith and the Crimson Raiders recover the Vault Key/Map to discover the many Vaults that exist across the galaxy, and travel among planets via their new spacecraft Sanctuary III. However, the Calypso Twins, Tyreen and Troy, have claimed themselves the rightful owners of the Vaults, creating a cult of personality, the Children of the Vault, from the remnant bandit factions of Pandora to secure these Vaults themselves, and making a strategic partnership with megacorporation Maliwan for military support. Lilith recruits new Vault Hunters (Amara, Moze, Zane, and FL4K) to help secure these Vaults before Tyreen and Troy can. They learn that the pair are Sirens themselves, seeking to absorb the power of the Vault monsters for their own to open the \\"Great Vault\\", revealed to be the planet Pandora itself, unaware that it still contains the \\"Destroyer\\", which is further explained to be a being intent on destroying the universe. With the help of former and new allies, the Crimson Raiders managed to stop the Calypso Twins and kill the Destroyer but at the cost of Maya and Lilith's lives, although the latter's fate is ambiguous. Main series=Borderlands Borderlands was released in 2009, and combines traditional first-person shooter gameplay with character-building elements found in role-playing games, leading Gearbox to call the game a \\"role-playing shooter\\". Players choose to play as one of four characters: Lilith the Siren, Mordecai the Hunter, Brick the Berserker, and Roland the Soldier. The game awards experience points for enemies killed and objectives completed, as well as encouraging skillful gameplay by granting bonuses to more difficult actions such as headshots. Earned experience builds toward the threshold of the next level. Leveling up provides the player with additional \\"skill points\\", which are used to select various skills that allow character specialization. In addition to various melee weaponry, the character can wield an array of firearms, grenades, and specialized weaponry, which are procedurally generated to provide a rich variety of loot. The game supports solo play as well as a cooperative mode for up to four players. A New Game Plus mode allows players to replay the game with the same character at a higher difficulty level. The game is set on the planet Pandora, contested by bandits, mercenaries of interstellar corporations, dangerous wildlife and, eventually, eldritch alien abominations. As a \\"Vault Hunter\\", guided by the mysterious \\"Guardian Angel\\", the player is searching for a fabled vault full of alien loot. Borderlands is characterized by its offbeat humor and a cartoonish, cel-shaded art style. About 4.5 million copies of the game had been sold worldwide by 2011, an unexpected success for Gearbox. Borderlands received positive reviews, with an aggregate Metacritic score of 81 to 86, depending on the platform. It was complemented by four DLC packs: The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned, Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot, The Secret Armory of General Knoxx, and Claptrap's New Robot Revolution. A remastered version for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One ‚Äì Borderlands: Game of the Year Edition ‚Äì was released on April 3, 2019. It was released for Nintendo Switch version, which released on May 29, 2020. Borderlands 2 The sequel to Borderlands, released in 2012, picked up the setting and gameplay mechanics of its predecessor. Again, players control one of four (or, with DLC, six) Vault Hunters, while the four-player characters of the original game re-appear as non-player characters. The story, written by Anthony Burch, focuses on the players' struggle with Handsome Jack, the megalomaniacal CEO of the Hyperion corporation, who seeks control of Pandora's mineral riches and alien artifacts. Gearbox released five DLC campaigns that continue the main game's story (Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty, Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage, Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt, Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep and Commander Lilith & the Fight for Sanctuary). In addition, several DLC packs introducing two new player characters (Gaige the Mechromancer and Krieg the Psycho), more character development possibilities and quests have been released. Even more so than the first game, Borderlands 2 was an unexpected critical and commercial success. It was one of the best-selling games of 2012, and has become the best-selling game in the history of its publisher 2K Games, with 8.5 million copies sold by February 2014. The game received aggregate Metacritic scores of 89 to 91, depending on the platform. A port of Borderlands 2 for the PlayStation Vita handheld was released in 2014, offering the full game and some of its DLC, but limited to two-person multiplayer. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel Announced in April 2014, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel was developed by 2K Australia and released for PS3, Xbox 360 and Windows PC in October 2014, as well as for Mac OS later in 2014. It is set on Elpis, the moon of Pandora, and its story ‚Äì occurring between the events of the first two games ‚Äì covers the rise of Handsome Jack to power. The game features four of Jack's henchmen as playable characters: Athena the Gladiator, Wilhelm the Enforcer, Nisha the Lawbringer and the robot Claptrap, \\"the Fragtrap\\". Jack's body double Timothy Lawrence and Sir Hammerlock's sister Aurelia were added later as DLC player characters. New game mechanics include the use of oxygen tanks and a boost jump. The game was re-released in 2015 as part of Borderlands: The Handsome Collection, a compilation and port of Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel! for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Borderlands 3  Borderlands 3 was released on September 13, 2019 for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game had been in development at Gearbox as early as 2015, and was revealed at PAX East on March 28, 2019. Borderlands 3 was the best selling game in the Borderlands series, selling over five million copies within the first 5 days of its release, and reaching 8 million by the end of 2019. As with past games, players select one of four new Vault Hunters ‚Äì Amara the Siren, Moze the Gunner, Zane the Operative and FL4K the Beastmaster ‚Äì as they try to stop the Calypso Twins from acquiring the greatest power in the universe, including on planets other than Pandora.

Spin-off games=Borderlands Legends To coincide with the release of Borderlands 2, the iOS spin-off game Borderlands Legends was released on October 31, 2012, for iOS devices. It is more of a strategy game than a RPG and is played from a top-down perspective with players controlling all four Vault hunters from Borderlands. The game received mixed reviews and an aggregate Metacritic score of 52 out of 100. IGN gave the game a review score of 6.5/10 saying that the game was \\"a good idea dragged down by its inconsistent execution and lack of content.\\"  LootTheWorld  LootTheWorld was a free mobile app available for iOS and Android released on December 12, 2013 and shut down on October 18, 2015.

Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford and Take-Two Interactive's CEO Strauss Zelnick will serve as executive producers. Craig Mazin is to write the script and Eli Roth is to direct the film, which is expected to be R-rated. Cate Blanchett was signed on in May 2020 to star as Lilith. A May 2015 media report summarized the premise of the film as follows: \\"When a nearby star's gravitational pull unearths horrifying alien creatures hidden deep below the surface, the surviving colonists retreat to a vault rumored to contain advanced alien technology\\". In 2019, reporting by Full Circle Cinema suggested that the plot and characters of the film would only vaguely resemble those from the games. Reportedly, the film is to follow the \\"legendary thief\\" Lilith, who has to rescue the Atlas Corporation's CEO's daughter, Tiny Tina, assisted by Claptrap, Tina's bodyguard Krieg, and a group of vault hunters. Tabletop games Alongside the reveal of Borderlands 3, Gearbox presented a card game called Borderlands: Tiny Tina's Robot Tea Party. Designed for two to five players and taking 15 minutes a game, the goal is to collect the necessary cards to assemble a specific Claptrap model, but which can be waylaid by action cards played by other players. The game is being published by Gearbox, XYZ Game Labs, and Nerdvana Games.

The position eventually became a hereditary governorship after the fief was purchased from the Crown.  History  In 1660, as a reward for his loyalty to the Crown during the English Civil War, Edward de Carteret was granted the title of Governor of Alderney by King Charles II. De Carteret as Governor of Alderney superseded Nicholas Ling, the leader of Alderney as Lieutenant-Governor under Oliver Cromwell, as the leader of Alderney while Ling retained the Lieutenant-Governorship under de Carteret until he died. When de Carteret died, the governorship was in abeyance with acting governors taking the titular leadership of Alderney until 1680 when his widow sold the title to Sir Edmund Andros. In 1683, Andros was granted the island of Alderney for ninety-nine years in exchange for an annual rent of thirteen shillings. This led to the Governor of Alderney holding a hereditary position similar to the Seigneur of Sark. When Andros was appointed as the Governor of New York and left Alderney for British America, he delegated the role of governor of Alderney to Thomas Le Mesurier, whom he was related to through marriage. After Andros died, the Le Mesurier family took control of the governorship with the initial grant being extended by King George III. In 1825 the governor, John Le Mesurier III resigned the grant of the island, returning it to the Crown in exchange for an annual pension of ¬£700 (approximately ¬£ in 2014) in an agreement which eventually expired in 1862.

Parts of this railway have been removed; the remaining part, which has been regauged to the 1,000 mm gauge, still exists as the long Mengbao (Mengzi‚ÄìBaoxiu) railway. History=The growth of the system Some of the original 600 mm rolling stock from the Gebishi railway (a locomotive, two mail/luggage cars, and a boxcar) on display in the Yunnan Railway Museum (middle row) Plans for the construction of a railway to the tin mines of Gejiu were first made in 1913, just 3 years after the opening of the metre-gauge Kunming‚ÄìHai Phong railway (whose Chinese section is known as the Kunming‚ÄìHekou railway). The construction of the Bisezhai‚ÄìGejiu railway started on May 15, 1915 using Decauville equipment. The route required eight tunnels as long as with 3 percent grades and 28-degree curves ( radius). In November 1918, the first section of this railway, from Bisezhai (the connecting point to the Kunming‚ÄìHekou railway) to Jijie station (È∏°Ë°óÁ´ô, in Jijie Town of Gejiu City) opened. On November 9, 1921, the 34.1 km section from Jijie to Gejiu (the Jijie‚ÄìGejiu railway, È∏°‰∏™ÈìÅË∑Ø) opened as well. In 1922, construction work started on a branch that ran from Jijie to Lin'an Town (the county seat of Jianshui County). It ran in the general western direction, along the Lin'an River. This branch opened in November 1928. In 1931, work started on a further western extension, from Lin'an to Shiping; it opened on October 10, 1936, the railway thus acquiring its \\"Gebishi\\" (Gejiu‚ÄìBisezhai‚ÄìShiping) configuration.A little-known narrow-gauge railway connecting Gejiu, Mengzi and ShipingPeaceful rural scenery along Gebishi railway Gejiu Tin-Mining Company freight required rail. At the time of construction it was the only private railway in China,Bisezhai railway station (Caoba Town) and was later nationalised and merged into China‚Äôs national railways. In 1959, a new metre-gauge branch was constructed from Caoba station on the Kunming‚ÄìHekou railway to Yuguopu railway station (Èõ®ËøáÈì∫Á´ô) of the Gebishi railway (located on the north side of Mengzi City, between Bisezhai and Jijie). Yuguopu then became the new transhipment point between the 600 mm gauge Gebishi railway and Yunnan's metre-gauge rail network, while the old, less conveniently located connection at Bisezhai fell into disuse. Not needed anymore, the easternmost end of the Bisezhai‚ÄìJijie line, from Bisezhai to Mengzi, was removed in 1960‚Äì1962. The track removed from the eastern end of the line was used to construct a new extension at its western end, from Shiping to Baoxiu (ÂÆùÁßÄ; also within Shiping County), in order to provide rail access to the new Longkouchong iron ore mine (ÈæôÂè£ÂÜ≤ÈìÅÁüø). This Shiping‚ÄìBaoxiu extension was opened in August 1965. The gauge conversion on the Mengbao line In 1967‚Äì1969, plans were worked out for the regauging of the Mengzi‚ÄìJijie‚ÄìShiping‚ÄìBaoxiu Line (the 143 km long Mengbao Line) to the 1,000 mm gauge, to enable direct railcar interchange with the Kunming‚ÄìHekou mainline (via Yuguopo station and the Caoba‚ÄìGuanjiashan branch). The reconstruction was to also improve the track layout, the curve radius being increased to . rail was to be used for the new tracks. KD55 steam locomotives were to be used to pull trains on it. Jijie would become the transhipment point between the Jijie‚ÄìGejiu branch (the last remaining 600 mm section of the original Gebishi system) and the 1,000 mm network, with the capacity to process up to 300,000 metric tons of freight per year. The regauging project started on January 1, 1970, using rails end equipment moved from other, recently torn down, metre-gauge lines in Yunnan. On October 1, 1970, the first train ran the entire length of the converted Mengabo line; the project was fully completed in May 1971, at the cost of 15 million yuan (105,000 yuan per km). In 1977, the Mengbao line was converted from the manual blocking to the semi-automatic blocking. The abandonment of the Jijie‚ÄìGejiu branch In 1977‚Äì1978, plans were worked out by the Kunming railway Bureau and the Ministry of railways for the conversion of the Jijie‚ÄìGejiu branch to the metre gauge as well. However, they were never implemented. In 1985, only two station remained in operation on the Gejiu branch; the passenger service ended. In August 1991, all service on the Jijie‚ÄìGejiu branch stopped. The tracks were removed in 2008. The Mengbao line today In 2003, passenger service on the Mengbao line was terminated. In February 2010, freight service west of Lin'an Town (Jiashui County seat) ceased as well. More recently, the Mengbao line became viewed as a heritage object, with a tourist potential. Since 2015, an excursion train called, in English, Jianshui Old Train, or in Chinese Âª∫Ê∞¥Âè§ÂüéÂ∞èÁÅ´ËΩ¶ (Jianshui Gu Cheng Xiao Huoche, i.e. \\"Jianshui Old City Small Train\\"), has been running between Lin'an station and Tuanshan station, 12.82 km to the west.ÁôæÂπ¥ÂØ∏ËΩ®ÈªÑÈáëÁ∫ø‚ÄîÂª∫Ê∞¥Âè§ÂüéÂ∞èÁÅ´ËΩ¶ (The golden line of the century-old \\"inch track\\" railway ‚Äì Jianshui Old City Small Train) The new standard-gauge Yuxi‚ÄìMengzi railway, opened in 2013, serves both Lin'an Town (Jianshui station) and Mengzi City. Between these two cities it follows a route that is fairly similar to that of the narrow-gauge Mengbao line, but is straighter, due to greater use of tunnels and elevated sections. Locomotives Baldwin SN-29 from the Gebishi railway on display in the Yunnan Railway Museum Baldwin Locomotive Works built sixteen 0-10-0 locomotives for the line between 1924 and 1929. These locomotives remained operational until the branch was closed in 1990.

Life  Andronikos is a very obscure figure. As R. Macrides writes, \\"almost everything that is known about him [...] has been disputed: his identity/name, the date of his marriage, the date of his death, the cause of his death\\". Nothing is known of his origin and early life, and even his name is uncertain, as the metropolitan of Ephesus, Nicholas Mesarites, who officiated at his marriage, calls him \\"Constantine Doukas Palaiologos\\" in a sermon of his. All Byzantine chroniclers on the other hand, beginning with George Akropolites who is the main source on his life, call him Andronikos, and it is usually supposed that the different name in Mesarites' account is a transcription error by a later copyist. Andronikos is first mentioned by Akropolites as participating in the 1211 campaign against the Latin Empire, which ended with the Nicaean defeat at the Battle of the Rhyndacus. During the course of the campaign, the Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders also took the cities of Lentiana and Poimanenon. Andronikos was evidently one of the main commanders during the siege of Lentiana, and was captured but later released by the Latins. Due to the chronological order of Akropolites' narrative, the marriage of Andronikos with Irene Laskarina, the eldest daughter of the Nicaean emperor Theodore I, was earlier regarded as contemporary with the 1211 events, but is now placed in February 1216. After his marriage Andronikos was elevated to the supreme rank of despot and became Theodore's heir-apparent, since the latter had no sons. He died soon after, however, from an unidentified \\"sexual condition\\" according to Akropolites, and Irene was remarried to John Doukas Vatatzes, who eventually succeeded Theodore I as emperor.

It is usually run within an organization such as a mining operation, a steel mill, a corporate center, or a government or military unit, and is usually intended, primarily for the use of employees. For instance, the United States Defense Commissary Agency operates commissaries that are similar to supermarkets, providing service members with most of the same products available in the United States regardless of where they are stationed abroad. Commissaries sell primarily grocery articles; other items can be purchased at a base exchange (BX) or post exchange (PX).  Purpose  Military commissaries serve to provide groceries and household goods, at a reasonable cost, to many members within the Department of Defense regardless of the country in which the service members are posted. Eligible patrons include active-duty personnel in all services, retirees of all services, Guard and Reserve personnel, and immediate family members of service personnel. A secondary benefit of US military Commissaries is the opportunity for employment of family members. This is especially significant in overseas locations where acquiring a job could prove difficult for U.S. citizens.  Benefits  A commissary offers food and household items sold at cost plus five percent surcharge, eliminating sales tax. The average shopper can save more than 30 percent when compared to shopping in town. During the commissary customer appreciation case lot sale, an average saving of 50 percent or more are available. These benefits extend to online shopping as well. They also offer rewards cards that allow shoppers to add additional promotions, coupons, and discount savings. Shoppers can also enter many commissary contests, sweepstakes, and shopping sprees. Commissaries also offer gift cards and contribute to academic scholarships.

Designed by architects Niels Munk and Keld Wohlert, the red-brick building with a steeply pitched roof was completed in 1983. Background In 1979, Gjesing Parish was established in the northern suburbs of Esbjerg. The area had previously formed part of Bryndum Parish. Initially, a temporary building served the new parish until, following a competition between four architectural firms in 1979, a complex designed by Niels Munk and Keld Wohlert of Solr√∏d Strand was inaugurated on 30 January 1983. In 2010, the complex was extended with a meeting room, a handicapped toilet and three offices. The church is adjacent to Esbjerg Storcenter, a shopping centre, in a residential area with apartment buildings and detached houses. Architecture Under the same tall roof, the complex consists of the church proper to the east and a parish hall to the west. A corridor connects the two and leads to offices, a classroom for confirmation candidates and atriums. The ground plan, which also consists of a porch and waiting room to the west and a sacristy and a chapel to the east, can be described as two large rectangles with two steep half-roofs, set off a little from one another. Light from glazed rifts in the roofing above comes into the nave from the south and north gables, with a similar approach in the church hall. The entire complex is built of red brick, with zig-zag patterns in the gable brickwork, and is roofed with copper. The free-standing bell tower stands to the southwest. Inside, the harmoniously designed nave has an open roof trussed ceiling, finished with white sheeting, and whitewashed walls. Three old bricks from the mother church in Bryndum are built into the wall behind the pulpit. The floor is laid with red tiles. A white altar table of pine stands beside the east wall. The font takes the form of an intersected cylinder consisting of four blocks of Bornholm granite. Seen from above, the blocks form a cross. The pulpit, which resembles a normal speaking podium, rises only slightly above the floor. Like the altar, the pulpit and the pews are made of pine.

The specific epithet honours either Johann Forster or Georg Forster, father and son German botanists, who accompanied James Cook as naturalists on his second voyage (1772‚Äì1775). Description It is an unmistakable tree growing to 15 m in height, characterised by wart-like outgrowths and aerial roots up to 5 m long. The strap-shaped leaves are 1‚Äì1.5 m long and 3‚Äì5 cm wide, spiny along the edges and beneath the midrib. The tiny female flowers are covered by leaves; male flowers are borne on 50 cm long inflorescences enclosed in white bracts enclosed by a large sheath or spathe. The fruits are dense spheroidal clusters about 20 cm across, red when ripe. The flowering season is from December to April. P. forsteri is notably taller than other species of Pandanus, and it takes years for its aerial roots to reach the ground. Its leaves function as gutters, channeling water to the trunk, and grooves in the upper surface of the roots carry water to the tips of the aerial roots where it can be absorbed.

Biography = Nude photo \\"My body is mine\\"  On 11 March 2013, Tyler was the first Tunisian woman to post a photograph of herself nude from the waist up on Facebook, with the phrase \\"My body is mine and not the source of anybody's honour\\" in Arabic. The photo was seen as scandalous and evoked strong controversies within Tunisian society comparable to the nude self-portraits of the Egyptian Aliaa Magda Elmahdy two years earlier. On 16 March, the popular talk host Naoufel Ouertani invited her to his show on Ettounsiya where she appeared disguised by pixellation. She explained that it was not for sexual reasons that she appeared topless but to call out their demands for the women's liberation in a patriarchal society. Imam Adel Almi issued a fatwa for her to be punished with 100 lashes and stoned to death.  Imprisonment  On 19 May 2013 she painted the name \\"FEMEN\\" on a cemetery wall in Kairouan, to protest against the annual congress of Salafi party Ansar al-Sharia. She was arrested and brought to Messaadine jail in Sousse. She faced up to 1 year in prison Tyler's father, the medical doctor Mounir Sbou√Ø, told the French newspaper Lib√©ration in an interview that his daughter made a mistake but didn't commit a crime. The long time militant and campaigner of the socialist Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties, who had left the party only after it joined the Troika government, said he was even proud of his daughter who \\"defended her ideas\\" and who also brought him to reconcile with his own values making him understand that one needs to be active. Maryam Namazie interviews Amina and Aliaa Elmahdy (8 March 2014). International protests followed for her release from detention. On 29 May 2013, three FEMEN members held topless protest in front of the Tunis court to demand her release while shouting \\"Free Amina!\\" and \\"A women's spring is coming!\\" (a reference to the Arab Spring). On 12 June 2013 a Tunisian judge convicted the two French and one German FEMEN members to fourth months and one day imprisonment for public indecency while protesting for the release of Tyler. The protestors, Pauline Hillier, Marguerite Stern, and Josephine Markmann, were released on 26 June 2013 after a Tunisian court lifted their prison sentence. Amina Tyler was acquitted for contempt and defamation on 29 July 2013, but she remained jailed pending trial on a separate charge of desecrating a cemetery.  Later activism  FEMEN had staged protests in front of the Tunisian embassy in Paris where they chanted 'Amina akbar! FEMEN akbar!' (referencing the Takbir) and in front of the Grand Mosque of Paris burning a Tawhid flag. Upon release in August 2013, Tyler declared that she was leaving the group in protest, adding that she thought FEMEN's actions in Paris were disrespectful to 'the religion of others' and because she saw a lack of financial transparency in the organisation. Inna Shevchenko reacted surprised: \\"It‚Äôs thanks to this campaign that Amina is out of prison.\\" In 2013, Tyler moved to Paris, where she completed high school and co-authored an autobiography, published in February 2014 under the title My Body Belongs to Me (). During International Women's Day on 8 March 2014, Tyler and seven other Arab and Iranian women, including Maryam Namazie and Aliaa Elmahdy, protested naked for women's rights at the Louvre Pyramid, chanting slogans in French in favour of freedom, equality and secularism (libert√©, √©galit√© et la√Øcit√©).

The name Methanohalophilus is said to be derived from methanum meaning \\"methane\\" in Latin; halo meaning \\"salt\\" in Greek; and mahii meaning \\"of Mah\\" in Latin, after R.A. Mah, who did substantial amounts of research on aerobic and methanogenic microbes. The proper word in ancient Greek for \\"salt\\" is however hals (·ºÖŒªœÇ).Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones with the assistance of. Roderick McKenzie. Oxford: Clarendon Press. The specific strain type was designated SLP (= ATCC 35705) and is currently the only identified strain of this species.  Phylogeny  There are a total of four species in the genus Methanohalophilus including Methanohalophilus mahii, Methanohalophilus halophilus, Methanohalophilus portucalensis, and Methanohalophilus euhalobius. The closest relative, Methanohalophilus portucalensis, has a 99.8% similarity in sequence across the whole genome to Methanohalophilus mahii. The other Methanohalophilus species have less than a 94.7% similarity to Methanohalophilus mahii. All species in the genus are halophilic methanogens that contribute to marine ecosystem mineral cycling.  Discovery  In 1988, Robert Paterek and Paul Smith were searching for methanogenic bacteria in the Great Salt Lake in Utah when they first discovered the archaeon Methanohalophilus mahii in its anoxic sediments. Sediment samples were collected and stored in plexiglas tubes, and sub-core samples taken with a brass cork borer and transferred to fifty milliliter serum bottles. All samples were processed within forty-eight hours of collection. The media used for isolation of Methanohalophilus mahii colonies was prepared using the Hungate technique for proper isolation of anaerobic microbes. Serial dilutions were prepared in a 1:10 ratio, and agar roll tubes were inoculated and incubated at 30 ¬∞C for eight weeks. Isolated methanogenic colonies were chosen by identifying those with a foamy texture, denoting gas release, and repeatedly diluted and inoculated on agar roll tubes until only one type of colony morphology remained. These colonies appeared as cream to pale yellow- colored circular-shaped colonies with an overall foamy texture due to gas release.  Cell Culture  Several analyses were done to determine cell characteristics. Methanohalophilus mahii is classified as a moderate halophile, or an organism that can grow in high salinity environments, since it can grow anywhere from a 0.5 to 3.5 M NaCl range, with an optimal growth concentration at 2.0 M NaCl, but with a 1.2 M NaCl concentration yielding the highest culture density. It can also grow in varying pH levels ranging from 6.5 to 8.2, with an optimum pH of 7.5. Methanohalophilus mahii is a mesophile, or an organism that thrives at moderate temperatures, and grows best at a temperature of 37 ¬∞C.  Cell Structure  Methanohalophilus mahii cells stain Gram negative, and are non-motile, irregular cocci approximately 0.8 to 1.8 micrometers in diameter. Additionally, the cells fluoresce under 420 nanometer light. Membrane phospholipids are composed of Œ≤-hydroxyarchaeol cores, glucose glycolipids, and ethanolamine, glycerol, and myo-inositol polar head groups. Metabolism Methanohalophilus mahii is an obligately anaerobic methylotrophic and methanogenic chemoheterotroph, able to reduce single-carbon compounds and multi-carbon compounds given that there are no carbon-carbon double bonds present. Trace amounts of Mg2+, K+, Ca2+, and Fe2+ ions are required for methanogenic growth. Methanol can be used independently as a carbon source, and the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) glycolytic pathway can be utilized for catabolic processes. Possible electron donors include methanol, methylamines, dimethylamines, and trimethylamines. Methanohalophilus mahii is capable of utilizing several metabolic pathways to either reduce or oxidize methyl groups, creating either methane or carbon dioxide in the process. In the reductive methylotrophic methanogenic pathway, Methanohalophilus mahii can eventually reduce a methyl group to a methane, which is released. In the oxidative methylotrophic pathway, the methyl group is instead oxidized to carbon dioxide and released. This process directly contributes to carbon mineralization in marine ecosystems.  Genome  Methanohalophilus mahii‚Äôs genome was sequenced through shotgun sequencing using a 6.8 kilobase Sanger DNA library. The complete genome size was determined to be 2,012,424 base pairs long, with 2,906 total genes, and 2,032 actual protein-coding genes. The sequence had a 42.6% GC content, and forty-five pseudogenes were located.  Importance  Methanohalophilus mahii has a unique suppressor tRNA with a modified pyrrolysine, an amino acid that is most commonly found in prokaryotes, that can recognize and bind to the amber STOP codon (UAG) which is also coded for by the genes used for methylamine methyltransferases. This species was also the first member to have its genome completely sequenced in the genus Methanohalophilus[1], which comprises mildly halophilic, methylotrophic methanogens. These archaea in general are known to greatly contribute to the carbon mineralization process in marine ecosystems. Specifically, the oxidative methylotrophic pathway Methanohalophilus mahii utilizes allows the species to oxidize methane to carbon dioxide, which, in turn, is used by other plants and organisms. This mineral cycling process allows for more growth and diversity in the ocean. ReferencesFurther reading *Dworkin, Martin, and Stanley Falkow, eds. The Prokaryotes: Vol. 3: Archaea.

It started as an estate developed under the provisions of the Agricultural Lands Purchase Act (1896) near what was then known as Newcastle (now Toodyay). The estate was one of the first established under the provisions of the Agricultural Lands Purchase Act; originally Coondle was an immigrant grant where, to encourage development of the Swan River Colony, people were granted land based on the value of their investment in the colony. History In late May and early June 1836 George Leake, George Moore, and Richard Brown explored the Toodyay and Bolgart areas looking for land for Leake. The first title, identified as Avon Location 1, was issued to George Leake in 1836; Leake named the property Coondle. Upon his death in 1849 the property passed to his nephew George Walpole Leake, who died in 1895. There is no record of the Leake family residing on the property; it was leased by a number of prominent locals including Charles Ferguson, who would later purchase one of the allotments, James Drummond Jnr, and the Dempster family .Old Toodyay and Newcastle, page 25 and Toodyay Homesteads pg93-97 In November 1897 the people of Newcastle expressed support for the Land Purchase Board acquiring the Coondle Estate for the Government, as rumours of new gold finds on land in the area had seen several parcels of land sold at considerably increased prices. The land - 7800 acres in total - was purchased from the Leake Estate for ¬£7015 9s 8d. In 1898 Coondle was surveyed for the Crown Lands Department by Leeming, Crowther and Rutherford; the lots were identified as Avon Locations 1 and 15. Avon Location 1, released in April 1898, covered about 7000 acres of land and was subdivided into blocks ranging from 20 to 567 acres. The cost of the land varied from 10s to ¬£5 dependent upon its suitability for the various farming activities already occurring in the region. The estate was served by the existing Newcastle-Bejoording road through the centre, providing access to Newcastle and the goods sheds for the railway. An old track to Chittering was upgraded to a permanent road (now Julimar Road) to provide access to the western side, and a road along Church Gully (now Church Gully Road) provided access to the eastern side. Toodyay Brook, a tributary of the Avon River, provided a permanent water supply, although it was brackish during summer. A well provided fresh water, and previous experience with several soaks suggested that more wells could be successfully sunk. Avon Location 15, comprising 800 acres adjoining the old Newcastle town site was partly cleared but not subdivided. The sale of Avon Location 1, Coondle Estate was considered an experiment as to the success of the Agricultural Lands Purchase Act, and was being watched carefully as to what impact it could have on future land policies of the Western Australian Government. The land was officially released on 13 April 1898, and by 30 April 1898 it was being reported that over half of the estate had been sold. An audit of the Coondle development in 1905 showed that all of the land had been sold and - with the exception of one 100-acre allotment - improved. These improvements included dwellings, wells, 66 miles of fencing, and 1800 acres under cultivation. One farmer had 8 acres of orchids, 20 acres under cultivation, along with 200 bee hives, from which he held approximately 13 tons of honey in storage.

Cryptosporidium does originate in common mice, specifically laboratory mice. However, it also has infected cows, dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, lambs, and humans and other primates. General characteristics Cryptosporidium muris infects dogs, rabbits, lambs, cats, humans, and non-human primates. This type of cryptosporidium infects people and animals by the oocyst acquired in water. If people or animals drink the water, then they could become infected and then complete the cycle by passing oocysts. People and animals can also become infected by being in water that has the oocysts present. The area where Cryptosporidium muris most commonly occurs is in Kenya, France, Thailand, and Indonesia. It also occurs in the western hemisphere but to a far lower amount. Diagnostics and prevention The current diagnostics for Cryptosporidium muris are Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), and DNA sequencing. Diagnostic tests can be frustrating as it is highly difficult to differentiate between species and the treatment would be the same for all species. Cryptosporidium muris is resistant to disinfectants; it has been discovered that ultraviolet or UV light helps to kill the species. As for prevention, people should not drink infected water or play in it. Also making sure to practice good hygiene improves the risks of not contracting Cryptosporidium. Prevalence Cryptosporidium muris has prevalence in the following species in the following amount: Dairy Cows -68% Feedlot Cows- 80% Mice- 26%, and Rats- 5%.

Life  Born ca. 1163/4, Mesarites is first recorded in 1200, during the attempted coup of John Komnenos the Fat. At the time, Mesarites was skeuophylax of the Church of the Pharos in the Great Palace of Constantinople, and wrote an eyewitness account of the events. After the capture of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, he initially remained in the city. In late 1206, along with his brother John he participated in discussions between the Greek Orthodox clergy and the new Latin authorities, represented by the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople Thomas Morosini and the papal legate, Cardinal Benedict of Santa Susanna. The discussion failed to breach the rift between the two parties, as the Greeks refused to subordinate themselves to the Latin clergy. Following the death of his brother in February 1207, Mesarites left for the Empire of Nicaea, where he was appointed Metropolitan of Ephesus soon after. As Metropolitan of Ephesus, he headed a mission in 1214/5 to Constantinople for discussions with the new papal envoy, Cardinal Pelagius of Albano. Mesarites wrote a report of his discussions with Pelagius, where he highlights his intransigence, intolerance towards the Greek Orthodox clergy and insistence on Papal primacy. In 1216 he officiated at the marriage of Irene Laskarina, the eldest daughter of the Nicaean emperor Theodore I Laskaris, and Andronikos Palaiologos.  Writings  Mesarites' writing style, distinguished by \\"his interest in vivid details and in his own role in the events\\" (A. Kazhdan), marks a conscious departure from the conventions of Byzantine literature, which he on occasion mocks. This is particularly evident in his description of the 1200 coup, which is far more vivid and immediate than the far more stylized and abstract treatments of the same event by other contemporary writers. The epitaph he composed for his brother contains also an eyewitness account of the fall of Constantinople and contemporary events. Mesarites also left a valuable description of the Church of the Holy Apostles, and of the school that functioned in its premises.  Editions  * August Heisenberg, Nikolaos Mesarites.

Reception = Critical response  Upon release the film got what the IB Times called \\"decent\\" reviews with the critics mostly praising the lead actors performances and the gripping screenplay. Ranjani Rajendra of The Hindu called it a \\"regular feel good fare\\" and wrote \\"Though there's nothing phenomenal in terms of storyline, Oka Laila Kosam makes for a good one-time watch with its fair share of laughs and entertainment.\\" Hemanth Kumar of The Times of India wrote \\"Oka Laila Kosam is a simple love story which doesn't quite leave you with a big smile on your face, but it has enough mojo, if you are a big sucker for romance. After all, there's nothing more comforting than a happy ending in a romantic film\\" and rated it 3 out of 5. Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle wrote \\"The director has concentrated more on the lead actor and has left the female lead in confusion and there is no clarity about her character. But overall it's a feel good film and you can watch it once for Chaitanya and Pooja Hegde\\" and rated it 3 out of 5. Veena of Oneindia Entertainment wrote \\"Vijay Kumar Konda's story and screenplay should really be appreciated for portraying the casual story magically, onscreen. Oka Laila Kosam is a good romantic entertainer. The movie includes all commercial elements and will be a hit movie in Naga Chaitanya's career again\\" and rated it 3 out of 5. IndiaGlitz wrote \\"Barring a few well-crafted scenes and nice visuals, the film lacks a strong story to keep the story going. Once watchable for the taking\\" and rated it 2.75 out of 5. IANS wrote \\"At a running time of 150 minutes, you really wish you had the power to stop the film whenever you want. Alas, that option is out of the question .Oka Laila Kosam, which is partly refreshing, is messed up mostly as it suffers from clich√©d storytelling.\\" Rajitha S. of The New Indian Express wrote \\"The film starts on a boring note, but it gets racy until the end of first half. The second half has too many elements which makes it clear that director Vijay Kumar Konda wanted to attribute too many characteristics to Naga Chaitanya. Chaitanya though has done justice to the role, as a character Karthik is slightly overdone\\".  Box office  Oka Laila Kosam opened to low occupancy in both single screens and multiplexes. The film collected on its first day at the global box office. The film collected in AP/Nizam region and nett in the rest of the world by the end of three days taking its global first weekend total to thus recovering 5% of the film's budget.

History Bedlington United was formed in or before 1897, and in that year became a founder member of the East Northumberland Combination. The team played in the East Northumberland League from 1902, and their 1907‚Äì08 league title preceded election to the Northern Alliance. Bedlington regularly finished in mid-table in the seasons running up to the war; their best result was fourth in 1911‚Äì12. In 1913, a stand was built at their Hollymount ground, and the sale of advertising space within the ground contributed to the club's finances. However, the land was requisitioned in 1920 by the local council for housebuilding, and the club moved to a site in Church Lane to be known as Burdon Park. Bedlington continued in the Northern Alliance for one post-war season and were then accepted into the North-Eastern League. They finished bottom in their first season, but were reprieved by four teams leaving to join the newly formed Football League Third Division North, and continued in mid-table or below until 1929‚Äì30, when a bottom-place finish meant they were relegated to the North-Eastern League Second Division. Runners-up spots in 1934 and 1935 did not bring promotion, and when the North-Eastern League reverted to a single division, Bedlington joined the re-formed Northern Alliance. They struggled on for two seasons, but after a third in which they finished bottom of the table, conceded eight goals both at home and away to Newcastle United \\"A\\", failed to win away from home until the penultimate match of the season, and had three players fail to turn up for the last home fixture, the club resigned. Its structure as a limited liability company combined with a longstanding lack of interest from the shareholders had made it impossible to continue. A public meeting agreed to set up a new club with the intention of replacing it in the Northern Alliance, but there were five clubs applying for three vacancies and Bedlington were unsuccessful. Bedlington United first entered the FA Cup in 1908‚Äì09, and entered every season until 1927‚Äì28; their last participation was in 1935‚Äì36. Their best performance was in 1926‚Äì27, when they reached the second round proper before losing heavily to North-Eastern League rivals Carlisle United. They beat favourites Blyth Spartans 5‚Äì0 to win the Northumberland Senior Cup for the first time in 1923, and won it again in 1928.

Life and work  Das Rheintal von Bingen bis Koblenz (1811) Elisabeth von Adlerflycht studied in Frankfurt under Johann Daniel Bager (1754‚Äì1815), who painted still lifes and portraits. In 1797 she married Justinian von Adlerflycht, who later became a senator of the Free City of Frankfurt. During a cruise on the Rhine in 1811, she drew preparatory sketches for a panoramic painting of the Rhine valley from the mouth of the Nahe to the Moselle. The panorama used continuous parallel projection to illustrate an overhead view of the full Rhine Valley. Johann Friedrich Cotta von Cottendorf (1764‚Äì1832) recognized the novelty of this technique of making pictorial maps and initiated the lithographic printing of this sheet by the Stuttgart geographer and cartographer Heinrich Keller in 1822. In 1823, Friedrich Wilhelm Delkeskamp of the Frankfurt publishing company Friedrich Wilmans published this classic panorama of the Rhine from Mainz to Cologne. Elisabeth von Adlerflycht had a painting gallery in Frankfurt, where today a street is named after the von Adlerflycht family.

When the local government tried to force the miners back to work, they resisted with firearms and the uprising was put down with great violence. Seven workers were killed and four-hundred arrested. The uprising was put down, but its memory was preserved as part of Tuzla‚Äôs anti-authoritarian legacy. The rebellion has been called one of the most important historical events in Yugoslavia and has remained an example of class struggle against injustice and oppression. Event A miners' strike began on 21 December 1920 in Husino when the miners requested a rise of wages of 30-45% to counter the gallop inflation which had paralyzed the economy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (+60% between August and December 1920). Even with threats in the event of refusal of the authorities, the miners began a general strike. This very badly accommodated by the authorities who took radical measures to counter it. On the night of 27‚Äì28 December 1920, they sent a troop of 19 gendarmerie and police officers, who were ordered to evacuate the houses of the strikers in order to capture them and to counterbalance them, to Husino, which was then regarded as general headquarter of the strike movement. The main actors of the strike were Jure Kero≈°eviƒá (Guja), Osman ƒêuloviƒá (Topƒço), Mujo ƒêuloviƒá (Mujko), Karlo ≈Ωeleznik, Ivan Brcun, Franjo Mariƒá, Marko Fidler, Bozo Mrkiƒá, Simo Topaloviƒá, Mijo Tomiƒá. The 7,000 miners, armed with simple stones and pickaxes, quickly decimated the gendarmes and police officers, which caused the anger of the authorities who sent two battalions of the army as well as heavy artillery and 50 gendarmes that same evening. Vis-√†-vis the army, the miners had only one choice: to surrender and give up their requirements. The rebellion was choked in blood by the Yugoslav government and the miners and their families' homes were confiscated, women were raped, over 400 people were arrested and some were expatriated. Thirteen months later, the revolt got an epilogue in a trial conducted in Tuzla in January‚ÄìFebruary 1922. The indictment charged the miners, including the leader of the uprising, Juro Kero≈°eviƒá, who was originally sentenced to death by hanging for allegedly killing gendarmerie officers. However, under pressure from domestic and international publicity the penalty was commuted to 20 years in prison. 32 miners were sentenced to death and 10 other miners were penalized with prison time ranging from 1‚Äì15 months. Aftermath and legacy The rebellion has been called one of the most important historical events in the former Yugoslavia and has remained an example of class struggle against injustice and oppression. The steles of the victims installed in the municipal park of Husino testify still today to that dark time in the recent history of the village. A monument to memorialize the Husino miners (created by Ivan Saboliƒá) was erected in 1956, showing a miner dropping his pick for a rifle. In SFR Yugoslavia, 21 December was celebrated as Miners' Day throughout the country, because of the Husino Uprising. During the Bosnian War (1992‚Äì95), a boot camp in Tuzla was named Husinska buna. In February 2014, multiple Bosnian newspapers including Osloboƒëenje called the 2014 unrest in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the \\"new Husino Uprising\\". In popular culture A folk song called Konjuh planinom (Konjuh Mountain) was inspired by the uprising in the Husino village. It was first sung by Pejo Markoviƒá, who was killed in 1944 during World War II. Televizija Sarajevo produced a television film about the Husino Uprising called Husinska buna (Husino Rebellion, 1980).

Early prototypes of the game were distributed through Steam's early access program in 2013. Nuclear Throne was released on December 5, 2015, for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, and on March 25, 2019 for the Nintendo Switch, with an Xbox One release due in the future.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot Nuclear Throne is a top-down shooter roguelike game. The game consists of two main game modes: single-player, and a local cooperative gameplay mode. There are daily and weekly challenge modes, allowing the player to compete against others via the Steam platform for the best score (determined by the number of kills in the playthrough), on the same set of randomly generated levels. The player controls one of a total of 12 characters, 10 of which must be unlocked through play. Two additional secret characters can only be played under special circumstances during play. Each character has an ability unique to them, adding an additional element to the gameplay. These abilities offered by the game for each individual character allow different play-styles to be achieved by the player and improve the variety and replay-value of the game. Secondary sprites or skins can be acquired for the characters played, if the player completes special or secret tasks. The player progresses through the linear level structure until level 7-3, where the final boss, the Nuclear Throne, has to be defeated. After this, the player may choose to loop to the beginning of the game again with a greatly increased difficulty. The user may continue looping indefinitely until death. The game resets upon death. Except for special weapons acquired in a hidden level and \\"crowns\\" retained until after defeating the final boss, anything acquired in one playthrough does not carry over to the next. The game has a leveling system, where the player gains experience in the form of radiation pellets, or \\"rads\\", dropped by enemies, that allow them to get different mutations and choose what would benefit the character the most out of a selection of four, randomly selected mutations. Upon mutating 10 times the player can choose a character-specific \\"ultra-mutation\\". As well as the available mutations being randomly generated, the levels are procedurally generated, with every playthrough having a unique set of levels for the user to complete. The player starts with the basic revolver, but they may upgrade by taking weapons from red chests and collect more ammunition by opening yellow chests. The player can have two weapons equipped at any time, such as a shovel and an assault rifle. The weapons available to the player get increasingly advanced and powerful as the enemies become increasingly difficult and numerous. Weapons utilise different ammo types, with there being bullet, energy, shell, bolt, explosive and melee weapons. The user may use powerful Ultra Weapons after reaching Level Ultra, following the completion of experience levels up to Level 9.  Development  Vlambeer's Jan Willem Nijman and Rami Ismail served as the game's designer and producer, respectively, and shared the development work. Paul Veer, who had previously animated Vlambeer's Super Crate Box, returned to contribute art to Nuclear Throne. The game's promotional art was drawn by Justin Chan, an art student hired on the basis of his fan art for early releases of the game. Nuclear Throne music was composed by Jukio \\"Kozilek\\" Kallio, who had composed for several previous Vlambeer titles. A friend of Kallio's, Joonas Turner, worked on the sound effect design. Nuclear Throne development took 2.5 years, beginning in February 2013 and releasing into Steam Early Access that same year. During PAX Prime 2013 Vlambeer showed off the prototype for Nuclear Throne, known as Wasteland Kings, with five of the twelve characters playable in the prototype. After the release of Nuclear Throne to early access, this prototype was made for public download. It was revealed by Rami Ismail that the name change was due primarily to a trademark issue with InXile Entertainment. Vlambeer live streamed gameplay online for the public twice a week during development. Vlambeer announced PlayStation 4 and Vita releases at the December 2015 PlayStation Experience keynote.  Release  In January 2016, Vlambeer teamed up with the subscription box company, IndieBox, to offer a physical release of Nuclear Throne. This limited collector's edition included a themed USB drive with DRM-free game file, soundtrack, instruction manual, Steam key, and various custom-designed collectibles.  Reception  Nuclear Throne has received positive reviews from critics, with the game's PS4 version scoring 82/100 on Metacritic, and the PC version 88/100. Alexander Chatziioannou of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4 out of 5 saying, \\"Nuclear Throne is impeccably presented and tightly designed. There is enough variety in characters, upgrades and weapons to ensure that playthroughs never get repetitive and its visceral combat is a joy in itself.\\" Jordan Devore from Destructoid rated the game an 8/10 saying, \\"it's one of the hardest, most rewarding games I've ever played. But as satisfying as it can eventually become, I think it is far too demanding for its own good.\\" IGN awarded it a score of 9.0 out of 10, saying \\"Nuclear Throne is an enjoyably tough run-and- gun with tons of energy and variety to justify hours and hours of replays.\\"  References  External links  * Category:2015 video games Category:Indie video games Category:Linux games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:MacOS games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Vita games Category:Roguelike video games Category:Video games using procedural generation Category:Shoot 'em ups Category:Shooter video games Category:Top-down video games Category:Video games developed in the Netherlands Category:Vlambeer games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Early access video games Category:GameMaker Studio games Category:Nintendo Switch games ","title":"Nuclear Throne"},{"id":"41950409","text":"J'Adore may refer to: *J'Adore (fragrance), a fragrance created in 1999 by Calice Becker for Dior *J'Adore (magazine), Romanian shopping magazine *J'Adore (album), an album by Fish Leong, or the title song *\\"J'adore\\", a song by Inna from the album J'Adore *\\"J'adore\\", a 1971 song by Sheila and Aldo Maccione ","title":"J'Adore"},{"id":"41950416","text":"The Lemon Table is the second collection of short stories written by Julian Barnes, and has the general theme of old age.Age has not withered him: Frank Kermode salutes the bleak virtuosity of Julian Barnes's new collection of short stories, The Lemon Table, Frank Kermode, The Guardian, March 2004 It was first published in 2004 by Jonathan Cape.

He played his early football for East Albury and in 1933 trained with Richmond, where his brothers Doug and Gordon were premiership players. A younger brother, Allan Strang played for South Melbourne. However it was with St Kilda that he made his two league appearances, in the 1933 VFL season. He kicked three goals from full-forward on debut, against Carlton at Junction Oval, in round seven. The following round he played in St Kilda's loss to Collingwood at Victoria Park, then lost his place in the team when Bill Mohr returned from injury. He returned home in 1935 and began playing for Albury, which was followed by a stint with Kyneton in the Bendigo Football League. In 1937 he joined Northern Tasmanian Football Association side North Launceston, a club captain-coached by his brother Gordon. They lost the grand final that year to Launceston, after which Strang returned to Albury. On 28 November 1946, Strang died from an illness, aged only 36.

She has been notably compared to Amedeo Modigliani and Chaim Soutine, the peintres maudits of early twentieth-century Paris.http://www.artfund.org/exhibition.php?ar=0&yy;=2012&mm;=10‚ÖÜ=23&pid;=pat- douthwaite-pallant-house  Life  Douthwaite was born in Largs, Ayrshire, Scotland, to mother Winifred Rachael, and father Thomas Leslie Douthwaite. She spent her early life in Paisley. She travelled widely, living in various places across the world until her death in Dundee, in 2002. Although she was born in 1934, she claimed throughout her life to have been born in 1939. In 1947, Douthwaite took up expressive dance and ballet classes, only making the decision to be a painter later in her life, and without any formal art education. Her work is featured in several different museums.http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/77051 She was married to Paul Hogarth between 1963-1970, and they had one son together. Douthwaite's extensive travel during her life saw her living in York, Edinburgh, Dumfriesshire, and Berwick upon Tweed. In addition, she travelled to North Africa, India and Peru.  Dance career  Douthwaite took up dance classes in 1947, which were taught by Margaret Morris. It was there that she met the artist J.D. Fergusson, Morris' partner. Fergusson was a landscape artist and taught Douthwaite how to appreciate the light interacting with a landscape. She continued to dance and was a part of Morris's Celtic Ballet in 1954 at Jacob's Pillow Theatre in Massachusetts U.S.A.  Art career  In the late 1950s, Douthwaite made the decision to take up a career in visual art, rather than dance, with Fergusson persuading her not to engage in formal art education. She had her first solo show at 57 Gallery in Edinburgh in 1958. She left Scotland in 1958, and associated herself with a wide artistic crowd which included Robert MacBryde, Robert Colquhoun, Peter Cook, Roger Law, and William Crozier, the latter of whom she had met in Glasgow. She moved into Crozier's house in Essex in 1958, however the extent of her relationship with many other of these artists is not clear. In December 1963 Douthwaite exhibited alongside the artists Philip Jones and Bill Featherstone at the Grabowski Gallery in London. A review of the exhibition by Kenneth Coutts-Smith appeared in Arts Review, where he remarked on her enigmatic, dreamlike and disturbing work which he felt had 'an almost embroidered applique effect'.Coutts-Smith, Kenneth, 'Pat Douthwaite, Philip Jones, Bill Featherstone', exhibition review in Arts Review, Vol. 15, Issue 24, 14 December 1963, p. 8. Douthwaite exhibited with the Women's International Art Club in London between 1960 and 1966.Costello, Doreen (1981). List of women artists exhibiting with the Womens International Art Club, 1900‚Äì1966. List held at the National Art Library, Victoria & Albert Museum, London. Records accessed 20/05/19. Although much of her work explores issues surrounding femininity and womanhood, Douthwaite did not self identify as a feminist. She was the recipient of various awards from the Scottish Arts Council. In 2005, following her death, the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh held a memorial exhibition. Douthwaite's work pursued a variety of themes including the Manson Trial, American Women Bandits and the aviator Amy Johnson.

Lewis and stars Tom Conway, Rita Corday and Edward Brophy, who played the recurring role of \\"Goldie\\" Locke. The film was the 11th in The Falcon series of detective films, and the eighth featuring Conway as the amateur sleuth. The Falcon in San Francisco was the final film in the series produced by Maurice Geraghty, after which budgets were reduced and location shooting largely abandoned.Mayer 2012, p. 140. Synopsis While travelling by train with his sidekick and assistant, \\"Goldie\\" Locke (Edward Brophy), for a vacation in San Francisco, Tom Lawrence (Tom Conway), a.k.a. The Falcon, meets Annie Marshall (Sharyn Moffett), a lonely little girl. Annie tells them that she is being held prisoner by her nurse, Miss Carla Keyes (Hermine Sterler), and butler Loomis (Jason Robards Sr.). Annie's story is cut short when Miss Keyes comes for her. Shortly after, the little girl rushes back to Tom to tell him her nurse is dead. Tom and Goldie take charge of Annie but police are notified that the little girl was kidnapped. When the train arrives in San Francisco, the police are waiting for the Falcon. Released on $10,000 bail, posted by Doreen Temple (Fay Helm), who promises Tom she will disclose the motive behind her generosity. At dinner that evening, Doreen brings along her bodyguard Rickey (Carl Kent), posing as a police officer. When they leave, Rickey knocks Tom out and takes him to Doreen's apartment where she interrogates him about the murder, and to stay away from gangster Peter Vantine (John Mylong) and the cargo ship, the S.S. Citadel. After Tom returns to his hotel to collect Goldie, they decide to pay a visit to Annie's house, where they meet her older sister Joan (Rita Corday) who denies that she knows Doreen or Vantine. Annie claims she made up the story about being held captive, but when Tom sneaks back to the house to talk to her, she says Loomis is holding her prisoner. She takes them to Carla's room where they find a photograph of a ship's officer (Johnny Strong), signed to his wife, Carla. Loomis hears someone rummaging around in the nurse's room, but is shot dead by an unknown assailant. Returning to their hotel, Tom is confronted by Vantine, who is brandishing a gun. When Tom disarms him, he learns Doreen was the romantic interest of an ex-bootlegger, Duke Monette (Robert Armstrong), involved with a shipment aboard the S.S. Citadel. Tom visits the Star Coastal lines where DeForrest, the company's general manager, is meeting with Joan, the owner of the company. A clerk at the office alerts Tom to go to an address, which turns out to be Doreen's apartment, where she is waiting with her gang. Vantine, also lured into her trap, arrives and begins to fight with Doreen's thugs. Tom and Joan manage an escape but on his return to his hotel room, discovers DeForrest hiding in a closet. Goldie finds a newspaper article that shows who the real owner of the steamship S.S. Citadel is: Duke Monette. That night Tom and Goldie sneak aboard the ship and find raw silk hidden among the bales of hemp cargo. Returning to the Marshall house, the little girl tells Tom that Joan has left to meet her \\"secret lover\\" on Telegraph Hill. Tom observes the rendezvous with Joan and DeForrest, who Tom thinks is really Duke Monette, confessing that he used a secret identity to protect his daughters, Joan and Annie. Fearing Doreen plans to hijack the illicit silk cargo that night, Duke asks for the detective's help. At dockside, Duke and Tom watch Vantine, Doreen and the other gang members board the S.S. Citadel. Duke suddenly knocks the ship's engineer unconscious, and blows up the unattended boiler room, then pulls a gun on Doreen and Tom. Tom tells Doreen that Duke killed Miss Keyes and Loomis, the employees she hired to watch over the girls. When Tom warns that Duke plans to blow up the ship, Doreen and Rickey lunge forward to disarm Duke, who shoots them both, but Rickey shoots Duke, allowing Tom to flee before the ship explodes.

The railway's headquarters and workshops were built in Namtu. In 1914 the connection with the metre gauge Burma Railways was moved from Manpwe to Namyao, a short distance to the east. After the First World War, the local Burma Corporation Ltd took over operations and built an electrified underground railway at Tiger Camp and 100 hopper cars were ordered from the American Pressed Steel Car Company. In the 1930s the line experienced its peak traffic.The Burma Mines Railway 1999 Steam was largely replaced in the 1970s and 1980s but today two steam locos remain in working order.The Burma Mines Railway in Namtu Present day In present day, the coal for the smelters and the finished products is transported by road.

Designed by Paolo Catone, it initially used a 5-litre Chevrolet V8 engine, developed by Comptech, and later used the 3-litre twin-turbocharged flat-six engine from a Porsche 935, as well as an Oldsmobile V8. In 1998, two of the C41s were developed into the Courage C51, which used a 3-litre twin- turbocharged Nissan VRH35Z V8 engine, and was used in that year's 24 Hours of Le Mans. In 1999, the C41s were mostly converted to the C52 specification (although one retained its Porsche 935 flat six, and was developed into the C50, whilst another was entered as a Chevrolet-entered C41 in two events); this initially used a 3.5-litre twin-turbocharged Nissan VRH35L V8, which was then replaced by a 3.2-litre twin-turbocharged Peugeot A32 V6 engine for 2000. In 2000, the C41 line was replaced by the new C60. Design and development In 1994, Yves Courage decided to build a World Sports Car for the IMSA GT Championship, which was the Paolo Catone-designed C41. Although the C41 was entirely designed by Catone, Marcel Hubert had initially developed a long- tailed concept model for the car, but this design was scrapped after Hubert retired. Catone began to design the car, on a limited budget, in early 1994, and completed it in July 1994. The C41 used a carbon fibre and aluminium honeycomb monocoque chassis, with a rear shear plate designed to allow the usage of multiple different types of engine. The first C41 was built in October 1994, and it was fitted with a Comptech-developed 5-litre Chevrolet V8 engine, which, in 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans trim, was claimed to produce around . The power was transmitted to the rear wheels via a 5-speed Intermotion SDC gearbox, whilst Brembo brakes were used to slow the BBS wheels. KONI developed the suspension, which consisted of double wishbones made out of fabricated steel, and pushrod-operated dampers with coil springs. The Chevrolet engine remained the primary engine for the 1995 and the start of the 1996 IMSA GT Championship seasons, but by the middle of 1996, different engines began to be fitted. Scott Schubot fitted an Oldsmobile engine to his C41 partway through the 1996 season, whilst a 3-litre twin-turbocharged Porsche 935 flat-six engine was fitted by Courage for the 1997 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Nissan- engined Courage C52 that finished sixth at the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans. In 1998, two C41s were developed into the C51 specification for that year's 24 Hours of Le Mans; one of the C51s used a 3-litre twin-turbocharged Nissan VRH35Z V8 engine derived from a Nissan Group C car, whilst the other used a 3.5-litre version of the same engine. The C51 was then further developed into the C52 for the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans, and the VRH35Z was replaced with a 3.5-litre Nissan VRH35L engine. For this race, another C41 was converted to the C51 specification, although this retained its Porsche 935 flat-six; this C51 is also referred to as the C50. The final development of the C41 line came in 2000, when the C52s were fitted with the Sodemo-developed 3.2-litre twin- turbocharged Peugeot A32 V6 engine, producing a claimed output of . In 2000, the new Courage C60 was introduced as the C52's replacement, bringing to an end the C41 line. Racing history=1995-1996 The Courage C41 made its first appearance at the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans, with Courage Comp√©tition selecting Henri Pescarolo, Franck Lagorce and √âric Bernard to drive it. A second C41, driven by Eric van de Poele, Olivier Beretta and Matjaz Tomlje, was also entered, but was disqualified for technical infringements for the event. The C41 of Pescarolo, Lagorce and Bernard lasted 26 laps before succumbing to electrical problems, and retiring. Following this race, two C41s were shipped to America for use in the IMSA GT Championship in 1996. Wheel Works Racing took one of the C41s, and selected Rick Sutherland, Jean-Paul Libert, and Steve Fossett to drive at the 24 Hours of Daytona. van de Poele joined the trio for the race, but the C41 was forced to retire due to accident damage after 209 laps, restricting them to 49th place. For the 12 Hours of Sebring, van de Poele left the team and switched to Doyle Racing; Dean Hall was selected to replace him. In addition to this, Scott Schubot entered himself and J√©r√¥me Policand in his privately entered C41. The Wheel Works Racing C41 was forced to retire due to accident damage after 56 laps, whilst Schubot's car retired for the same reason after 239 laps; the two teams were classified 53rd and 30th respectively. Wheel Works Racing did not compete with the C41 again, leaving Schubot as the only C41 entrant at the Grand Prix of Atlanta; he took sixth overall in the race, six laps behind the leader. At the Exxon Superflo 500, Schubot crashed the C41 in practice, and drove Support Net Racing's Hawk C-8 instead in the race. He returned to the C41 for the Lime Rock Grand Prix, with the car now using an Oldsmobile engine; he finished the race in 14th place overall, and 11th in the World Sports Car class. At the California Grand Prix, Schubot finished in seventh place, before taking 14th overall, and ninth in class, at the Grand Prix of Dallas. At the Daytona Finale, Schubot's C41 overheated prior to the start of the race, resulting in him driving for Doyle Racing in the race. 1997-1998 In 1997, Courage Comp√©tition began running the C41 in the IMSA GT Championship, doing so for the first time at the 24 Hours of Daytona. It would not be a successful event, as the C41, driven by Policand, Didier Cottaz and Fredrik Ekblom, succumbed to engine trouble after 12 laps, restricting them to 80th place. At the Grand Prix of Atlanta, Schubot was the sole C41 entrant, running Policand, Martin Guimont and Jacek Mucha in his C41, but the team could only manage 51 laps, and finished 18th, and last, overall. Schubot partnered Mucha in the next round, which was the Lime Rock Grand Prix, and the pair competed 91 laps before gearbox problems struck, and were classified 11th. At the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen, Schubot drove alongside Mucha and Guimont, but mechanical issues forced them to retire after 28 laps, and restricted them to 41st. Courage Comp√©tition then entered a C41 in the 24 Hours of Le Mans; the car, driven by Cottaz, Policand and Marc Goossens, finished fourth overall, having completed 336 laps, and second in the LMP category. The team then entered the C41 in the International Sports Racing Series, and at the 1 Hour 15 Minutes of Zolder, Policand and Cottaz took second overall, ahead of a pair of Courage C36s. At the Mosport Festival (part of the IMSA GT Championship), Mucha and Guimont finished the race in tenth, before Mucha and Field took eighth in the Grand Prix of Las Vegas. In the non-championship 4 Hours of Le Mans, Cottaz and Policand won both races, and thus took the overall victory by three laps. Courage then returned to the IMSA GT Championship, and the pairing of Mucha and Guimont saw mechanical issues restrict them to 102 laps and 14th place at the Festival of Road Racing, before Field and Mucha took ninth at the 2 Hours of Sebring. Field and Mucha finished the IMSA GT Championship season with a 14th finish at the Monterey Sports Car Championships, before Cottaz and Policand finished the International Sports Racing Series season with a victory at the 2 Hours of Jarama. In 1998, Courage entered three C41-based cars in the 24 Hours of Le Mans; one C41, driven by Franck Fr√©on, Olivier Th√©venin and Yojiro Terada, and two C51s, with Cottaz and Goossens partnering Jean-Philippe Belloc in one, and Fredrik Ekblom, Patrice Gay and Tetsuya Tsuchiya driving the other. The C41 finished in 15th, having completed 304 laps, whilst the Cottaz/Belloc/Goossens C51 retired due to an issue with its gear lever after 232 laps, and the other C51 succumbed to a water leak after 126 laps. Equipe Promotion Racing then ran a C41 in the International Sports Racing Series, entering Geoff Farmer and John Burton in the RAC Tourist Trophy; they took tenth overall, and seventh in the SR1 category. At the Coupes d'Automne, Equipe Promotion Racing selected Didier Andr√© and Franck Fr√©on to drive the C41, and they took fourth overall. 1999-2000 Jacobs Motorsport Ltd. attempted to run Mucha, Michael Jacobs and Frank Del Vecchio in a C41 at the Lime Rock Grand Prix round of the United States Road Racing Championship in 1999, but were unable to start the race. At the 24 Hours of Le Mans, three C41-based cars were entered by three different teams. Pescarolo Promotion Racing Team entered Gay, Pescarolo and Michel Fert√© in the C50, Courage Comp√©tition selected Alex Caffi, Andrea Montermini and Domenico Schiattarella to drive a C52, and Nissan Motorsports ran Ekblom, Cottaz and Goossens in a second C52. The Courage Comp√©tition entry completed 343 laps, and took sixth, whilst the Nissan Motorsports entry took eighth, with 335 laps, and the Pescarolo entry finished ninth, having completed 328 laps. Pescarolo Sport used their C52, refitted with the Peugeot A32 engine, in the American Le Mans Series in 2000; in their first race in the series, Emmanuel Cl√©rico, Olivier Grouillard and S√©bastien Bourdais took seventh place, three places ahead of the new Courage C60. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, they named an unchanged driver lineup, and took fourth place in the race ‚Äì the fastest of the non-Audi entries. This would prove to be the last time a Courage C41-based car was used in a major race.

After studying theology at Herborn and Marburg, he travelled to G√∂ttingen where he became interested in science through attending lectures by Georg Christoph Lichtenberg and Abraham Gotthelf K√§stner. Benzenberg obtained a PhD from the University of Duisburg in 1800 and became a professor of mathematics at the women's college of D√ºsseldorf in 1805. After the Napoleonic occupation of Germany he immigrated to Switzerland where he became interested in politics. Benzenberg's interest in politics led him to write extensively on issues such as the constitution of Prussia. In 1844 Benzenberg built a private observatory, the D√ºsseldorf-Bilk Observatory, in Bilk, which he later donated to the city along with a grant to pay for a resident astronomer. In 1798, whilst still a student at the University of G√∂ttingen, Benzenberg and Heinrich Wilhelm Brandes studied the atmospheric altitude of meteors, collecting the first evidence that they were inside the atmosphere. Later, in 1802 and 1804, Benzenberg helped prove the Earth's rotation by conducting experiments originally suggested by Isaac Newton; dropping balls from a height.

On 12 March 1853, a meeting was held in Dickinson's rooms, and a society was formed under the name of the India Reform Society. Initially involved, besides Dickinson, were two Members of Parliament, John Blackett and Henry Danby Seymour. John Bright came onto the committee, and his contacts gave the Society access to many more MPs; his interests included Indian cotton as an alternative source to the United States, and lobbying the British government to have Indian infrastructure improved. Another activist was Francis Carnac Brown who had been a committee member of the earlier British India Society, formed in 1839 by Joseph Pease (1772‚Äì1846). The debate in parliament of 1853 on the renewal of the East India Company's charter gave the society a short-term objective, and the maintenance of good faith towards the Indian states a major theme. The Indian Rebellion of 1857 made for another push, in efforts towards moderation, and to prevent exclusive attention to penal and repressive measures, and Dickinson organised a series of public meetings. After 1859 the India Reform Society began to languish: at a meeting in 1861 Bright resigned the chairmanship, and carried by a motion appointing Dickinson his successor. The publication in 1864‚Äì5 of two pamphlets entitled Dhar not restored roused in Calcutta feeling against Dickinson, who was called a \\"needy adventurer\\". By 1865 the Society had ceased to function. Life On the death of his father in 1869, Dickinson inherited a fortune, but was in weak health. He corresponded with Tukojirao Holkar II, maharajah of Indore. On 23 November 1876 he was found dead in his study, at 1 Upper Grosvenor Street, London.

He later became a disc jockey at radio station WOBS in Jacksonville, where he was known as \\"The Demon\\", Marsha Washington George, Black Radio ... Winner Takes All, 2002, p.114 before moving on to station WTMP in Tampa. His first success as a songwriter came with \\"What a Man\\", a minor R&B; chart hit in 1968 for Linda Lyndell. The song, re-titled \\"Whatta Man\\", became a much bigger hit in 1994 for Salt-n-Pepa. In 1969, he and Brad Shapiro became staff producers at Atlantic Records, where they worked with Wilson Pickett and Dee Dee Warwick, and produced the debut album by The J. Geils Band. Crawford also co-wrote, with his cousin Jackie Moore, the song \\"Precious, Precious\\" which was recorded by Moore and reached the Billboard R&B; and pop chart in 1970. He continued to work with Shapiro on Moore's subsequent records for Atlantic, and also worked as a producer with B. B. King, The Mighty Clouds of Joy, and Phyllis Hyman. As a freelance producer in 1975, based in Atlanta, Georgia, he was paired with singer Candi Staton, and wrote \\"Young Hearts Run Free\\". According to Staton, the song's genesis was a conversation she had with Crawford over lunch in Los Angeles. Staton said: \\"Dave Crawford was always asking me: 'What's happening in your life?'...and I was [then] with someone I shouldn't have been with and it was hard getting out of that...very abusive relationship.Chris Watts Speaks to Candi Staton at 107 Meridian FM [He said], 'You know, I‚Äôm gonna write you a song.

The label released several singles and an album, Here Am I, by Crawford as a solo performer, but neither they, nor other releases on the label by Judy Clay, Charles Mann and others, were successful. Crawford reportedly made substantial financial losses on the venture, and returned to Miami where he worked as a DJ on gospel radio.North Florida Music Hall of Fame He was murdered in Brooklyn, New York, in June 1988, and was buried there.
