The participants were Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Eilert Sundt. The core of the debate was about whether or not it was redundant to add flour to porridge after cooking it. The background for the debate was that Asbjørnsen published a cookbook in 1864 called Fornuftigt Madstel. En tidsmæssig Koge- og Husholdningsbog (approximately translated as, \\"Sensible Fare. A Modern Cooking and Housekeeping Book\\"), under the pseudonym Clemens Bonifacius, where he argued that the addition of flour to the porridge was wasteful. Asbjørnsen believed that the human body could simply not extract any nutritional value from the flour; he believed that it was uncooked and that uncooked flour was indigestible. On the other side, Sundt argued that one should trust the competence of the Norwegian porridge makers gathered through generations. Asbjørnsen's belief that the flour remained uncooked was incorrect, as the flour cooks when it is stirred into the hot, watery dish. Later sources say that adding flour to porridge is sometimes necessary to make it thicken properly, especially if the porridge is cooked with grains of doubtful quality, such as most Norwegian cooks would have encountered after a bad harvest. In this analysis, flour was neither added because women followed the traditions of previous generations, nor omitted in the name of science and domestic economy, but added because it produced the desired texture.

He was often referred to as \\"Chidda\\" or \\"Chidder\\" Stevens. Career Stevens arrived at Footscray in 1927, from Victorian Football Association club Preston. He was already aged 28 when he made his debut against St Kilda at Western Oval in round 10. A ruckman, Stevens immediately cemented his spot in the team and in 1928 was picked in the Victorian state side to play South Australia in Adelaide. He made 16 league appearances in the 1928 season and another 16 in 1929. When Footscray captain Allan Hopkins became unavailable in 1929, Stevens filled in as club captain. On 17 August 1929, Footscray played a round 16 fixture against Melbourne at the MCG, during which Stevens was involved in several on field incidents. As the players were leaving the field at half time, Stevens was struck in the face by a man from the crowd and hit \\"by a women with her parasol\\", before being assisted to the rooms by police constables. The spectator that struck Stevens, Hector Michael Davis, was charged with assault and fined in court. At the VFL Tribunal, Stevens was suspended for 10 league games, on three charges. He received four weeks for \\"kneeing\\" Melbourne player Col Deane, two for conducting himself in \\"an unseemly manner\\" (an objectionable gesture) and four for elbowing and attempting to strike Melbourne's George Cassidy. Stevens made just five appearances in the 1930 VFL season. On his first game back from suspension, at Corio Oval in round 10, the umpire reported him for attempting to elbow Geelong player Jack Plunkett. Although cleared of the charge at the tribunal, he received a four-week ban for his actions after he had been approached by the umpire, when he threw the ball away. In 1931 he played 11 games and was a member of a Footscray team that missed out on the finals only on percentage. He featured in the opening eight rounds of the 1932 season, then found himself back at the tribunal, reported for striking Melbourne's Joe Kinnear with his elbow. For this he received an eight-week suspension. His next and ultimately final appearance for Footscray came in round 18, against North Melbourne. He retired at the end of the season. Death Stevens died at the age of 54 on 7 July 1953, when he was struck by a train on the railway line at Reservoir, Melbourne. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances around his death. Family He had a son, Harvey, who played for Footscray and was a member of their historic 1954 premiership team.

Among his most well-known films are North Korean Partisan in South Korea (1990), White Badge (1992), Life and Death of the Hollywood Kid (1994), Unbowed (2012) and National Security (2012). Career Chung Ji-young honed his directing skills by working as an assistant director to legendary filmmaker Kim Soo-yong. Chung, whose feature debut was an erotic mystery, The Mist Whispers Like a Woman (1982), also directed about 20 episodes of the MBC single-episode anthology drama series Best Theater. He spent the majority of the 1980s directing melodramatic fare before moving on to more politically- charged works following the end of the Chun Doo-hwan administration. During his heyday, Chung helmed some of the most hard-hitting and socially conscious films of the 1980s and 1990s such as North Korean Partisan in South Korea (1990), White Badge (1992), and Life and Death of the Hollywood Kid (1994). But his influence on the industry extended far beyond his filmography, as he was also a fierce advocate for governmental reform, particularly as it affected the Korean film industry. As a leading voice in the Chungmuro filmmaking community, he argued for the establishment of a screen quota system, the abolishment of the pre-censorship system, campaigned against direct distribution of foreign movies, and was opposed to the signing of the Korea-USA free trade agreement, among other issues confronting the industry at the time. However, following Naked Being (1998), Chung took an extended hiatus that finally ended thirteen years later when he returned with Unbowed at the 2011 Busan International Film Festival. A critique of corruption in the judicial system inspired by the real-life case of a math professor who fired a crossbow at a judge, the film caused a sensation subsequent to its commercial release in January 2012. Aside from the enormous critical acclaim it received, the low-budget production was an unexpected box office success, drawing some 3.4 million viewers. And Chung was awarded Best Director at the 33rd Blue Dragon Film Awards. Later in 2012 he again turned to another politically sensitive, controversial topic for his next film. National Security is based on the true story of Kim Geun-tae, a democracy activist who was kidnapped and tortured by the Chun Doo-hwan regime over 22 days within the walls of Room 515 in the anti-communism division of the National Police Headquarters in Seoul's Namyeong neighborhood circa 1985 (from which the film's Korean title Namyeong- dong 1985 is derived). Boldly opting to spend 90% of its running time on the waterboarding and other acts of horrific torture inflicted on Kim (who subsequently became Korea's Minister of Health and Welfare), Chung's film was uncompromising and challenging. By the director's own admission, he found it difficult to shoot the most trying scenes. Though it focused almost exclusively on the torture itself, many viewers have found the film to be tremendously moving in the end, and Chung hoped that the film will be a reminder of the sacrifices that some endured in order for Korea to progress to its present state. Chung appeared in Heo Chul's documentary Ari Ari the Korean Cinema, in which he and actress Yoon Jin-seo interviewed more than a hundred respected film professionals to discuss the industry's history and the issues it currently faces. Chung originally began the project as its co-director, but when his film Unbowed was green-lighted, he turned over the final editing to his collaborator, the US-trained director and professor Heo Chul. As a veteran director, it was Chung's connections in the film industry that helped the documentary to assemble its impressive cast, which includes directors Lee Chang-dong, Im Kwon-taek, Bong Joon-ho, and Park Chan-wook; and actors Ahn Sung-ki, Park Joong-hoon, Song Kang-ho, and Choi Min-sik; as well as producers, critics, and other industry figures. In the film, Chung questions why major film companies in the country prefer working with up-and-coming directors ― it turns out it is because it is easier for the companies to take control over the products ― and how challenging it is for older directors like himself to produce the kind of movies that they want to make. He also openly criticizes the current film distribution system which he thinks makes it difficult for independent or small-budget films to secure screens. He was the recipient of the Kim Dae-jung Nobel Peace Film Award at the 2012 Gwangju International Film Festival. Chung said he believes \\"there's still a lot of passion in this industry, and that’s what keeps the diversity of Korean cinema against the dominance of the major production houses.\\" When asked why he keeps poking at sensitive areas of politics and society, Chung answered, \\"I wouldn’t do it if younger directors tackled this kind of topic. I'm only doing it because they aren’t saying what needs to be said. I decided that if making a film like this requires courage, I was going to show that courage.\\" Filmography *Project Cheonan Ship (2013) - producer *Lee Heon's Odyssey (short film in A Journey with Korean Masters, 2013) - director *Ari Ari the Korean Cinema (2012) - actor *National Security (2012) - director, screenplay *Unbowed (2012) - director, screenplay, producer *Iri (2008) - cameo *Extra (1998) - cameo *Naked Being (1998) - director, cameo *Blackjack (1997) - director *7 Reasons Why Beer Is Better Than a Lover (1996) - director *Life and Death of the Hollywood Kid (1994) - director, adaptation *Sun of Fire (1994) - cameo *White Badge (1992) - director, adaptation *Beyond the Mountain (1991) - director, adaptation *North Korean Partisan in South Korea (1990) - director, producer *Mountain Snake (1988) - director *A Forest Where a Woman Breathes (1988) - director, screenplay *A Woman on the Verge (1987) - director, cameo *A Street Musician (1987) - director, screenplay *The Light of Recollection (1984) - director *Mrs. Kim Ma-ri (1983) - cameo *The Mist Whispers Like a Woman (1982) - director, screenplay *A Woman's Trap (1982) - screenplay *Bird That Cries At Night (1982) - screenplay *White Smile (1980) - screenplay *Flower Woman (1979) - screenplay *The Terms of Love (1979) - assistant director *The Sound of Laughter (1978) - assistant director *The Swamp of Exile (1978) - assistant director *A Splendid Outing (1977) - assistant director *Scissors, Rock, and Wrap (1976) - assistant director References External links * * Category:South Korean film directors Category:South Korean screenwriters Category:Dongguk University alumni Category:Korea University alumni Category:1946 births Category:Living people ","title":"Chung Ji-young"},{"id":"45299548","text":"Walvisteuthis virilis is a species of squid from the family Onychoteuthidae, it is the type species of the genus Walvisteuthis.

Single-board computers such as Arduino, or Raspberry Pi, are commonly used for DiY networking purposes, since such computers are open-source, relatively cheap, have low power demands, support multiple protocols, and are portable. In 2016, the EU Horizon2020 research funding framework, and more specifically CAPS (Collective Awareness Platforms for Sustainability and social innovation) has funded two 3-year projects on DIY networking: 1) project MAZI, \\"A DIY networking toolkit for location-based collective awareness\\", focusing on small-scale networks and aiming to provide tools and interdisciplinary knowledge for individual or small groups to create their own off-the-cloud networks, and 2) project netCommons, \\"Network Infrastructure as Commons\\", focusing on existing large- scale community networks like Guifi.net, Freifunk, Ninux and combining research from different disciplines in close collaboration with key actors to address important economic, social, and political challenges that these networks face today. Regarding terminology, there is often criticism on the use of the term “Do It Yourself” to characterize collective action projects, such as the creation of a network. Alternative terms, more “collaborative”, include “Do It With Others”, “Do It Together”, or “Do It Ourselves”. The preference for the term DIY is first practical, since it is a common abbreviation that does not need explanation.

History The Hanoi Highway, formerly known as Highway Bien Hoa, was constructed between July 1957 and April 1961. The road was funded by American economic aid as a part of a massive nation building effort conducted over the course of the Vietnam War. The highway originally was nearly 32 kilometers long and 21 meters wide, spanning between the 4 Hang Xanh intersection and the intersection of Highway 1A 3 Gorges. At the moment of its inauguration by President Ngo Dinh Diem, the highway had two major bridges, six intermediate bridges, drainage systems, and erosion and traffic controls. The highway was surfaced with asphalt, a relatively modern innovation. James M.

Though the highway was constructed under the pretenses of economic development, the use of this cutting-edge technology bred suspicion that the highway had been built with the intent of military use. However, many countered that the presence of the highway would encourage local residents to build communities and open businesses along the roadside, a narrative that the United States happily adopted.\\"The Story Behind Saigon's Hanoi Highway.\\" Saigoneer, July 18, 2016, https://saigoneer.com/old-saigon/old-saigon-categories/7311-the-story- behind- saigon-s-hanoi-highway. All in all, paid for under the pretenses of non-military economic development, the road cost more than that which was spent on \\"labor, community development, social welfare, health, housing, and education combined for the period 1954-1961.\\"Carter, Inventing Vietnam, 76-77. In 1971, improvements were made to accommodate for civilian use. The route was designed to prevent two-way travel. Each dimension had two aisles, and this highway had two major bridges: the Saigon Bridge (982 m long) across the Saigon River and Dong Nai bridge (453 m long) across the Dong Nai River. [1] In 1984 the highway was renamed Hanoi Highway on the 30th anniversary of the liberation of Hanoi. Another name of this route is National Highway 52, commonly used to refer to the period from Saigon bridge to the intersection with Highway 1A in Thu Duc junction (junction of Station 2). Currently on Hanoi Highway 1A, it includes a highway crossing, starting from junction to junction Thu Duc, Ho Nai aka fork for Sat Sat Bien Hoa city is located near the junction, the intersection three Park April 30, (intersection with Highway 1K, beyond the intersection of the Three Gorges). Areas that the Hanoi highway passes through include Bình Thạnh District (wards 2 and 9), Thu Duc of Ho Chi Minh City and Di An City in the province of Binh Duong, Biên Hòa City, Dong Nai Province. With the economic situation in Ho Chi Minh City and the region growing, Hanoi Highway has become overcrowded in recent years, so Hanoi Highway will be extended up to 140 m. This project is planned to be initiated in 2009 with a project to expand Highway 51. According to the project, the construction period is 2 years initially.

Introduction  Let G(V,E) be an undirected, weighted graph, with n = V nodes and m = E edges. We would like to answer queries of the form \\"what is the distance between the nodes s and t?\\". One way to do this is just run the Dijkstra algorithm. This takes time O(m + n \\\\log n), and requires no extra space (besides the graph itself). In order to answer many queries more efficiently, we can spend some time in pre-processing the graph and creating an auxiliary data structure. A simple data structure that achieves this goal is a matrix which specifies, for each pair of nodes, the distance between them. This structure allows us to answer queries in constant time O(1), but requires O(n^2) extra space. It can be initialized in time O(n^3) using an all-pairs shortest paths algorithm, such as the Floyd–Warshall algorithm. A DO lies between these two extremes. It uses less than O(n^2) space in order to answer queries in less than O(m + n \\\\log n) time. Most DOs have to compromise on accuracy, i.e. they don't return the accurate distance but rather a constant-factor approximation of it.  Approximate DO  Thorup and Zwick describe more than 10 different DOs. They then suggest a new DO that, for every k, requires space O(k n^{1+1/k}), such that any subsequent distance query can be approximately answered in time O(k). The approximate distance returned is of stretch at most 2k-1, that is, the quotient obtained by dividing the estimated distance by the actual distance lies between 1 and 2k-1. The initialization time is O(kmn^{1/k}). Some special cases include: * For k=1 we get the simple distance matrix. * For k=2 we get a structure using O(n^{1.5}) space which answers each query in constant time and approximation factor at most 3. * For k=\\\\lfloor \\\\log n \\\\rfloor, we get a structure using O(n \\\\log n) space, query time O(\\\\log n), and stretch O(\\\\log n). Higher values of k do not improve the space or preprocessing time. = DO for general metric spaces = The oracle is built of a decreasing collection of k+1 sets of vertices: * A_0 = V * For every i=1,\\\\ldots,k-1: A_i contains each element of A_{i-1}, independently, with probability n^{-1/k}. Note that the expected size of A_i is n^{1-i/k}. The elements of A_i are called i-centers. * A_k = \\\\emptyset For every node v, calculate its distance from each of these sets: * For every i=0,\\\\ldots,k-1: d(A_i,v) = \\\\min{(d(w,v)w\\\\in A_i} and p_i(v) = \\\\arg \\\\min{(d(w,v)w\\\\in A_i}. I.e., p_i(v) is the i-center nearest to v, and d(A_i,v) is the distance between them. Note that for a fixed v, this distance is weakly increasing with i. Also note that for every v, d(A_0,v)=0 and p_0(v)=v. * d(A_k,v)=\\\\infty. For every node v, calculate: * For every i=0,\\\\ldots,k-1: B_i(v) = {w\\\\in A_i\\\\setminus A_{i+1}d(w,v). B_i(v) contains all vertices in A_i which are strictly closer to v than all vertices in A_{i+1}. The partial unions of B_is are balls in increasing diameter, that contain vertices with distances up to the first vertex of the next level. For every v, compute its bunch: * B(v) = \\\\bigcup_{i=0}^{k-1}B_i(v). It is possible to show that the expected size of B(v) is at most kn^{1/k}. For every bunch B(v), construct a hash table that holds, for every w\\\\in B(V), the distance d(w,v). The total size of the data structure is O(kn+\\\\SigmaB(v))=O(kn+nkn^{1/k})=O(kn^{1+1/k}) Having this structure initialized, the following algorithm finds the distance between two nodes, u and v: * w:=u, i:=0 * while w otin B(v): ** i:=i+1 ** (u,v):=(v,u) (swap the two input nodes; this does not change the distance between them since the graph is undirected). ** w := p_i(u) * return d(w,u)+d(w,v) It is possible to show that, in each iteration, the distance d(w,u) grows by at most d(v,u). Since A_{k-1}\\\\subseteq B(v), there are at most k-1 iterations, so finally d(w,u)\\\\leq (k-1)d(v,u). Now by the triangle inequality, d(w,v)\\\\leq d(w,u)+d(u,v)\\\\leq kd(v,u), so the distance returned is at most (2k-1)d(u,v). = Improvements = The above result was later improved by Patrascu and Roditty who suggest a DO of size O(n^{4/3} m^{1/3}) which returns a factor 2 approximation.  Reduction from set intersection oracle  If there is a DO with an approximation factor of at most 2, then it is possible to build a set intersection oracle (SIO) with query time O(1) and space requirements O(N+n), where n is the number of sets and N the sum of their sizes; see set intersection oracle#Reduction to approximate distance oracle. It is believed that the SIO problem does not have a non-trivial solution. I.e., it requires \\\\Omega(n^2) space to answer queries in time O(1), e.g. using an n-by-n table with the intersection between each two sets. If this conjecture is true, this implies that there is no DO with an approximation factor of less than 2 and a constant query time.

Minister for Primary Industry and Mines Willem Westra van Holthe announced in a late night press conference on 2 February that the CLP had elected him as its new leader, and hence Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, replacing Adam Giles. According to Westra van Holthe, the vote in the party room was 9 votes to 5 in favour of rolling Giles. Attorney-General John Elferink had been named as deputy leader, and hence Deputy Chief Minister.NT Chief Minister Adam Giles dumped: AM ABC 3 February 2015 However, Giles refused to resign, and the Administrator of the Northern Territory, John Hardy, declined to sack Giles. Hardy cited perceived irregularities in the spill process and doubt over whether Westra van Holthe would be able to maintain the confidence of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. While Westra van Holthe appeared to have the support of the majority of the CLP party room, there was no guarantee he could command a majority on the floor of the Assembly—and with it, enough support to govern. Under pressure from the CLP's organisational wing, the CLP party room met on the afternoon of 3 February to break the impasse. At that meeting, an agreement was reached between the Giles and Westra van Holthe factions whereby Giles would continue as leader, and Westra van Holthe would become his deputy. Westra van Holthe ruled out another leadership challenge against Giles. Background Adam Giles became Chief Minister of the Northern Territory in March 2013, replacing long-term Country Liberal leader Terry Mills in a party- room coup while Mills was attending a trade mission in Japan, becoming the first Indigenous head of government in modern Australian history. Initially he was popular with the electorate, however a series of scandals and problems shook his authority, including the defection of MPs Alison Anderson and Larisa Lee, and the resignation under a cloud of Northern Territory police commissioner John McRoberts. Giles' style was frequently compared to that of Queensland Premier Campbell Newman, which became a liability when Newman lost his seat in the 2015 state election. Impasse At his press conference, Westra van Holthe promised to govern in a more consultative manner than Giles. He also stated that Giles had agreed to stand down.Bardon, Jane. NT Chief Minister Adam Giles rolled in midnight coup. ABC News, 3 February 2015. However, the swearing-in ceremony scheduled for 3 February was cancelled when Giles refused to resign. Australian constitutional practice calls for a first minister (Prime Minister at the federal level, premier at the state level, and chief minister at the territorial level) to stay in office unless they resign or are defeated in the legislature. The Legislative Assembly was in recess and was not due to sit again for two weeks. Hardy refused to call the legislature back to Darwin. This prompted Westra van Holthe to draw up an instrument allowing Hardy to use his reserve power to sack Giles and commission Westra van Holthe in his place. At a press conference later that day, Giles declared that he was still Chief Minister because he had the support of the legislature—implying that he would topple Westra van Holthe and force new elections unless Westra van Holthe backed down. If the CLP members who supported Giles in the leadership vote joined Giles in breaking party discipline, Westra van Holthe would have faced being defeated on the floor of the Assembly at his first sitting. Additionally, if Giles and his close friend, Dave Tollner, had resigned, the CLP faced the prospect of losing government if it lost Giles' seat of Braitling and Tollner's seat of Fong Lim at by-elections. A wave of resignations raised doubts about whether the CLP had enough members to retain its registration. Opposition Leader Delia Lawrie and federal Labor MP Warren Snowdon both called for new elections. Rolf Gerritsen, a research fellow at Charles Darwin University, likened the spill to the party-room coups that characterised the CLP in the 1980s and 1990s—an era which saw four chief ministers in 15 years, including three in four years. Resolution Under pressure from the CLP's organisational wing, the CLP party room met on the afternoon of 3 February to break the impasse. At that meeting, an agreement was reached between the Giles and Westra van Holthe factions whereby Giles would continue as leader, with Westra van Holthe as his deputy. Westra van Holthe ruled out another leadership challenge against Giles. Giles later dumped Westra van Holthe supporter Robyn Lambley from cabinet, labelling her a \\"conspirator\\". Giles announced a new cabinet on 10 February; Transport Minister Matt Conlan, a supporter of the spill, resigned and moved to the backbench \\"to spend time with his family\\", and former Treasurer Dave Tollner, who had been forced to resign in August 2014, was reinstated into the ministry and as Treasurer. The Guardian reported that Conlan's departure had been expected following the failure of the spill.

She is Professor of English and Religion, and John Evans Professor of Latin, at Northwestern University. Newman was elected in 2017 to the American Philosophical Society. Education and career Newman was raised near Chicago, Illinois. After an undergraduate education at Oberlin College and graduate work at the University of Chicago, she began her scholarly career with a 1981 dissertation at Yale on Hildegard of Bingen. She has written on issues of gender and identity in a broad range of literary and theological texts, as well as translating important works from Latin, French, and Middle High German. Her scholarship has explored figures such as Julian of Norwich, Heloise and Abelard, Thomas of Cantimpré, Mechthild of Hackeborn, Marguerite Porete, Henry Suso, and Guillaume de Lorris. She has been described as \\"one of the finest Hildegard scholars\\". Her 2003 book, God and the Goddesses: Vision, Poetry, and Belief in the Middle Ages suggested that medieval Christianity included multiple female figures, \\"distinctive creations of the Christian imagination\\", who deepened the medieval vision of God. Her book was praised in Speculum as a \\"provocatively and eloquently written study\\" in which \\"Newman has directed her lifelong passion for the feminine in medieval Christian literature toward a finely tuned reading of female figures\\" as Goddesses; Caroline Walker Bynum wrote that when \\"we look back fifty years from now, we will see this book as one that changed the face of scholarship and maybe even our understanding of Christianity itself.\\" In 2006 Newman published a study and translation of the Song of Songs or Marienleich of Heinrich Frauenlob, which was described in The Times Literary Supplement as being \\"a gorgeous publication, clearly and forcefully written, stunningly laid out and carefully edited.\\" In 2015 she was elected to a one-year term as President of the Medieval Academy of America.

It first appeared in full published form presumably in Derek Parfit's 1984 book Reasons and Persons, but similar questions have been raised as early as 1775. The Polish science-fiction writer Stanisław Lem discovered the same problem independently in the middle of the twentieth century. He put it in writing in his philosophical text \\"Dialogi\\", 1957. Similarly, in Lem's Star Diaries of 1957 the hero visits a planet and he finds himself recreated from a backup record, after his death from a meteorite strike, which on this planet is a very commonplace procedure ('Fourteenth Voyage'). Derek Parfit's version In Divided Minds and the Nature of Persons (1987), Parfit asks the reader to imagine entering a \\"teletransporter\\", a machine that puts you to sleep, records your molecular composition, breaking you down into atoms, and relaying it to Mars at the speed of light. On Mars, another machine re-creates you (from local stores of carbon, hydrogen, and so on), each atom in exactly the same relative position. Parfit poses the question of whether or not the teletransporter is a method of travel—is the person on Mars the same person as the person who entered the teletransporter on Earth? Certainly, when waking up on Mars, you would feel like being you, you would remember entering the teletransporter in order to travel to Mars, you would even feel the cut on your upper lip from shaving this morning. Then the teleporter is upgraded. The teletransporter on Earth is modified to not destroy the person who enters it, but instead it can simply make infinite replicas, all of whom would claim to remember entering the teletransporter on Earth in the first place. Using thought experiments such as these, Parfit argues that any criteria we attempt to use to determine sameness of person will be lacking, because there is no further fact. What matters, to Parfit, is simply \\"Relation R\\", psychological connectedness, including memory, personality, and so on. Parfit continues this logic to establish a new context for morality and social control. He cites that it is morally wrong for one person to harm or interfere with another person and it is incumbent on society to protect individuals from such transgressions. That accepted, it is a short extrapolation to conclude that it is also incumbent on society to protect an individual's \\"Future Self\\" from such transgressions; tobacco use could be classified as an abuse of a Future Self's right to a healthy existence. Parfit resolves the logic to reach this conclusion, which appears to justify incursion into personal freedoms, but he does not explicitly endorse such invasive control. Parfit's conclusion is similar to David Hume's view and also to the view of the self in Buddhism, though it does not restrict itself to a mere reformulation of them. For besides being reductive, Parfit's view is also deflationary: in the end, \\"what matters\\" is not personal identity, but rather mental continuity and connectedness.

Early life and education Ogórek was born in Rybnik, Poland. In 2002, she completed a master's degree in history at the University of Opole, and in 2003 completed postgraduate studies in European integration at the University of Warsaw, and thematic studies in 2005 at the European Institute of Public Administration in Maastricht. In 2009, at the University of Opole, Ogórek received her PhD. She has lectured at the School of Customs and Logistics in Warsaw under the auspices of Malopolska College in Kraków. Professional and political activity Ogórek had internships and apprenticeships in the Office for European Integration in the Office of the President of Poland and the Prime Minister's Office. In 2004, she was employed as a clerk in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration, where she worked for two years. For three years she was an associate of the President of the Democratic Left Alliance Grzegorz Napieralski, and in 2010 was a member of the presidential election staff. In the parliamentary elections in 2011, she unsuccessfully stood as a parliamentary candidate of the Democratic Left Alliance. On 9 January 2015, Ogórek announced that she was standing in the 2015 presidential election as the candidate of the Democratic Left Alliance. She criticised Russian actions in Ukraine, but argued Poland cannot afford to be seen by Russian media as an enemy. She highlighted the Jewish ancestry of a senator, Marek Borowski, when criticizing his politics on TVP which sparked a wave of critical comments. The head of TVP demanded an explanation from Ogórek. From 2015, she has been actively involved in recovery of precious Polish art work and artifacts stolen in large quantities by German and Austrian Nazis during World War II. One of her successes was the recovery in February 2017 of the painting of Potocki Palace by 19th-century Polish countess Julia Potocka, the 18th Century map of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the engraving presenting view on Kraków. It was possible due to 2-year long negotiations with Horst von Wächter, a son of Austrian Nazi governor Otto von Wächter, who stole those paintings from occupied Kraków during World War II. Media career Ogórek has had cameo roles in television and film productions, including In Los Chlopakos (2003), Czego się boją faceci, czyli seks w mniejszym mieście (What are men afraid of, sex in a smaller city) (2003) and Lokatorzy (Tenants) (2002).

It was created between 84 and 55 BC and discovered in 1915 at Anzio, the ancient Antium, in a crypt next to the coast. It is now located in the Palazzo Massimo alle Terme in Rome, part of the Museo Nazionale Romano, while a reconstruction of it is in the Museo del Teatro de Caesaragusta (Theater Museum of Caesar Augusta) also in Rome.  Background  Anzio lies about 58 km south of Rome in the region of Latium. In the sixth century, at the latest, the Latins inhabited the region of Latium, remaining independent of Rome until 338 BC. Rome first took control of the region in the Latin War after the Battle of Trifanum and incorporated it into the incipient Roman empire.  Description  The Fasti Antiates maiores consist of two fragments of the thirteen month calendar and the List of Roman consuls. The 1.16 m high and 2.5 m wide calendar contains the leap month Mensis Intercalaris in addition to the twelve months. The list of consuls was the same height as the calendar, but 1.36 m wide. The names of the consuls span the period from 164 BC to 84 BC. According to the restoration of the lacunae at both ends, the list originally extended from 173 BC to 67 BC.  Contents  The calendar takes the form of a table with thirteen columns, each of which is a month labelled with an abbreviation of its name. Still legible are the following: IAN for Ianuarius (January), FEB for Februarius (February), APR for Aprilis (April), IVN for Iunius (June), and SEP for September. Each column consists of several rows containing the days as well as a supplementary row indicating the total number of days in the month. Still visible are XXIIX (28) for February, XXIX (29) for April, June and partly for August, XXXI (31) (partly) for May and October. Each day is marked with a letter from A to H, indicating the position of the day in the Roman nundinal cycle. The first day of each month is marked by the letter K, short for Kalendae. The fifth day of January, February, April, June, August, September, November and December is marked with the letters NON, short for Nonae. It is placed in the seventh day for the months of March, May, July, and October. The eighth day after the Nones of each month is labelled EIDVS (Ides). Some days are marked with the letters F, N or C. F is short for fastus dies (\\"allowed days\\", when it was legal to initiate action in the courts of civil law), N for Nefastus dies (banned days, when it was not), and C for comitialis dies (assembly days, when political assemblies were permitted). The calendar also lists the foundation dates (dies natales) of the temples in the city of Rome. The fact that the foundation of the Temple of Venus connected to the Theatre of Pompey is missing indicates that the calendar was created before 55 BC. The calendar also includes important events, like the Ludi Megalense, one of the festivals of the cult of Magna Mater. The inauguration of her temple on the Palatine occurred in 191 BC on 11 April. The relevant festival took place from 4–11 April. A confirmation of the date of the Ludi Megalense is found in the Fasti Quirinales, which additionally classify 11 April as Endoitio Exitio Nefas. Later Fasti contain a transmission error, which is why they provide the incorrect dates of 4–10 April.Jörg Rüpke, \\"Fehler und Fehlinterpretationen in der Datierung des \\"dies natalis\\" des stadtrömischen Mater Magna-Tempels,\\" Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 102 (1994), pp. 237–240.

It is a rhizomatous perennial plant, found in Kashmir. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant. It is also commonly known as Golden Iris or Golden Flag. It was also known as Iris aurea for a long time, before that was regarded as a synonym of Iris crocea. Description It is similar in form to Iris orientalis but with larger flowers. It has stout rhizomes, and it has long, erect, straight, and (ensiform) sword-like leaves.British Iris Society (1997) Measuring between long and 1.5–2.5 cm wide. It has a stout, terete (round in cross-section) long stem. It has few branches, and it has 2–3 green, between long, spathes (leaves of the flower bud). The stems hold 2–3 flowers, one terminal (top of stem) and two lateral (further down the stem), blooming early summer, between April and June, or June and July (in the UK). It has large flowers which are in diameter, in shades of yellow, from pure yellow, to bright yellow, to golden yellow. It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The wavy edged falls, are long and 4–5 cm wide. They have a narrow 3–4 cm long haft (section of petal closest to the centre). The standards are oblanceolate, wavy edged (or crinkled), measuring long. It has a 3.5–4 cm long style, with a deltoid crest, in the same shade of colour as the petals. It has a 1–1.5 cm long perianth tube, and a 3–4 cm long pedicel. After the iris has flowered, it produces an oblong seed capsule, measuring 3.8–4 cm long. It has 6 angles and beak. =Biochemistry= In 1992, it was studied to find the chemical composition of the iris, using spectroscopic and chemical methods. Several compounds were found including an isoflavone, called glucoside. In June 2012, a phytochemical study was carried out on 5 iris species growing in Kashmir, India. Including Iris crocea, Iris ensata, Iris germanica, Iris hookeriana and Iris kashmiriana. It found several flavonoids (including isoflavonoids, glycosides and tannins), within the irises. In September 2012, five Iris species (Iris pseudacorus, Iris crocea, Iris spuria, Iris orientalis and Iris ensata) were studied, to measure the flavonoids and phenolics content with the rhizomes. Iris pseudacorus had the highest content and Iris crocea had the lowest content. In 2014, eight Irises from the Limniris section (Iris crocea, Iris ensata, Iris orientalis, Iris pseudacorus, Iris setosa, Iris sibirica with its cultivars ´Supernatural´ and ´Whiskey White´, Iris spuria and Iris versicolor) were studied to find 12 chemical compounds (flavonoids, phenols, quinones, tannins, saponins, cardiac glycosides, terpenoids, alkaloids, steroids, glycosides and proteins). In 2015, a new rotenoid called 'Crocetenone' was extracted from the rhizome of the iris. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes. This can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=40. It has been counted several times; 2n=40, Lenz & Day, 1963; 2n=40, Mehra & Pand., 1978; 2n=40, Simonet, 1932; 2n=40, Banerji; 1970; 2n=40, Sharma, 1970; 2n=34, Mehra & Sach., 1976 and 2n=40, Karihaloo, 1978. Taxonomy It has a few of common names, including 'Golden Iris', 'Golden flag', 'Kaschmir Iris' (in Germany), and 'Quilting Sword lily' (also in Germany). The Latin specific epithet crocea refers to the word for saffron coloured or yellow. It was originally described under the name Iris aurea Lindl. by Baker in The Gardeners' Chronicle p. 584 on 4 November 1876. This name was later declared Illegitimate. It was then published in the Journal of the Linnean Society, Vol.16, page141 in 1877. It was the published and described as Iris crocea by Jacque in 'Gentes Herbarum', Vol.8 page21 in 1949, based on an earlier description by R.C.Foster in 'Contributions from the Gray Herbarium of Harvard University' Vol.114, page41 in 1936. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003. Iris crocea is an accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat It is native to tropical regions of Central Asia. =Range= It is found in Kashmir, and Jammu in India. It is also found in the west Himalayas., in Bhutan, Pakistan and China. =Habitat= It is found growing on graves within cemeteries, also beside roads and on central reservations of roads. It was found originally in grassy woods. It is found at altitudes between above sea levels. Cultivation Iris crocea is hardy to USDA Zones 3 – 10. Known to be hardy to −20OC. It is known to be tough and reliable in the UK. It is tolerant of a light frost. It grows well on likes rich, well drained soils such as, heavy loam in the UK. It is tolerant of clay soils. It likes mildly acidic to mildly alkaline soils. It prefers positions in full sun. It also prefers to be moist during the growing season. It resents being disturbed after being planted. It can be grown in the long grasses of orchards. =Propagation= It can be propagated by division or by seed. =Hybrids and cultivars= Known Iris crocea crosses included; *Iris crocea X Iris orientalis: 'Carol McKee', 'Mrs. H.

Administratively, Chorachiwadi is in the Shrigonda taluka of Ahmadnagar District in Maharashtra.Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India The Grampanchayat of Chorachiwadi is made of two small villages, Chorachiwadi Gavthan and Bhingan Dumala. The former has a larger land area and population than the latter and is located between the historic Bahadur Gadh (named after Chhatrapati Sambhaji) fort of Pedgaon and the Shrigonda taluka. Bhingan Dumala is situated on the banks of Saraswati, a small river which meets the Bhima River in Pedgaon at a distance of five kilometers.  Agriculture  Most of the villagers are farmers who harvest various crops such as sugarcane, sorghum (Jowar), wheat, cotton, grapes, lemons, pomegranates, bananas, different nuts such as tree nuts and peanuts, onions, watermelons, and cucumbers. Due to lack of rain, almost all irrigation depends on water canal systems, locally named Kukadi and Ghod. The Ghod water canal passes through the village, even though most of the land is irrigated by Kukadi canal water.  Education  Chorachiwadi has the facility of Anganwadis and Balwadis (kindergartens), under the Ekatmik Balvikas Kendra in Shrigonda tehsil. Anganwadis are in different regions of the village viz. Chorachiwadi, Bhingan Dumala, Salunke Wasti, Landge Wasti etc. There is a Zilla Parishad Prathamik (ZPP) school up to seventh grade, and a high school named Palhad Maharaj High School (2006) for grades eighth to tenth. Students can also enroll in other high schools of Shrigonda, where they can opt for a convent or semi-English medium school, and pursue vocational courses along with their regular courses. Several students from Chorachiwadi are pursuing their engineering degree from reputed government and non-government engineering colleges all over Maharashtra.  Politics  As of 2014, the total number of voters was around 1200.  Sports  The youth of Chorachiwadi plays different sports. Kho kho and Kabaddi are played since primary school and students participate in interschool Kho kho and Kabaddi competitions to represent Chorachiwadi. On the day of Sankranti, the youth organizes informal Kabaddi matches in the village. The Chorachiwadi Cricket team participates in various cricket tournaments all over the district. The youth also started a cricket league named Chorachiwadi Premier League (CPL) and organized a cricket tournament during October 2016. Volleyball gained popularity and players have formed a group called the Yodhha group. The said group participates in other social activities as well. Female participation in local sports remains low, as it does in most parts of rural India.

It is a small rhizomatous perennial plant, with fragrant, yellow flowers from Turkey. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions and known as Kerner Iris or Kerner's Iris. Description It is often confused with Iris halophila, which has bigger leaves. It is also similar in form to Iris sintenisii, except for the colour of the flowers, for the shape of the falls and for the fact that the spathe valves are not sharply keeled. It has long, thin rhizomes. That can form creeping clumps of plants. It has narrow, grass-like, bright green – pale green leaves. They can grow up to long, and 2–3 mm wide, (rarely 1 cm). They are more compact than Iris graminea. The flower stems are normally taller than the very narrow leaves. They can grow up to between, tall. Very rarely, they reach . In larger, more established plants, the strong erect, flower stems can branch and bear between 2–4 blooms on each plant. It has bracts that have wide transparent margins, which become scarious after antithesis (after flowering). The scented flowers, begin to appear between spring and early summer, between May and July. The flowers show a range of yellow shades; from sulphur yellow, to lemon yellow, to straw-yellow, to pale yellow, and deep cream. The flowers are in diameter. It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals, known as the 'standards'. The narrow pointed, lance-shaped, falls are reflexed, arching over, so the tips of the falls almost touch the stem. They have a deeper yellow signal patch, then fade to cream at the edges. The cream standards are upright and erect, sometimes twisted. The style arms are similar in form to the falls. It has a perianth tube that can extends to 2 cm longer than the spathes, (leaves of the flower bud), but the spathe can almost extend to the base of the segments. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes. This can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=18. It has also been counted by 'La Cour', (but unpublished) and by Lenz in 1963, both as 2n=18. In 2011, a study to find the various volatile chemical compounds within 3 species of native iris from Turkey. Iris pseudacorus, Iris kerneriana and Iris sofarana, were used and collected from Beyşehir and Trabzon. They used gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry methods. It was found that the flowers of Iris kerneriana contain (in percentages); α-kessyl acetate (14.7%), longipinene (10.8%), decanoic acid (10.6%), heptacosane (10.2%), hexadecanoic acid (9.5%) and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (7.1%). The Iris kerneriana rhizomes contain; tetradecanoic acid (31.5%), heptacosane (10.0%), α-kessyl acetate (9.5%), nonacosane (8.8%) and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (7.7%). Iris kerneriana stems contain; nonacosane (18.3%), heptacosane (16.7%), pentacosane (10.3%) and tricosane (6.0%). In 2013, a study into various chemical compounds of Iris species, it was found that the rhizomes of Iris soforana and stems of Iris kerneriana contain b-irone and the stems of Iris kerneriana contain trans-bionone-5,6-epoxide.  Taxonomy The Latin specific epithet kerneriana refers to 'Anton Kerner von Marilaun' (1755-1830), an Austrian botanist, and Professor of Botany in Vienna. It has the common name of Kerner Iris, or Kerner's Iris. It was originally published by Paul Friedrich August Ascherson and Paul Ernst Emil Sintenis in 'Gardeners' Chronicle' Series 2, Vol.21 page795 in 1884. It was not validly published as they did not attach a description of the plant. In 1892, Baker published an article on it in the 'Handbook of the Iridaceae' Vol.16. on Aug–Nov 1892, but thought that it was a synonym of Iris orientalis. It was later published as Iris kerneriana in 'Gardening Illustrated' Vol.58 page68 on 1 February 1936. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003. Iris kerneriana is an accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat It is native to a small temperate region of western Asia. =Range= It is found in Northern Turkey, from Bolu east to Erzurum and south to Kaz Dag and Ankara. Including; around the city of Amasya, and the villages of Direkli, Yassucal and Abacu. It is also thought to occur in Armenia. =Habitat= Iris kerneriana grows in open pine forests, in dry grassy turf/meadows and on dry scrub land. It grows at altitudes of between 300-2300m above sea level. Cultivation Iris kerneriana is hardy to between USDA Zone 3a (−39.9 °C (−40 °F)) to Zone 8b (−9.4 °C (15 °F)). It is also hardy in Europe and the UK. It prefers to grow in neutral to slightly acidic, (6.1 to 6.5 (mildly acidic) – 7.6 to 7.8 (mildly alkaline)), gritty, well- drained soils, that are rich (in nutrients) and having proper drainage. It does not like soils containing lime. It prefers positions in full sun. There should be plenty of free-flowing water in spring, during the growing period. But they will not tolerate overwatering. Also, they should have a little water during the fall/autumn, during the dormant period. These isis are known to be 'difficult' to establish within a garden. It resents being disturbed after being planted, clumps should be left for several years, (ideally 10–15 years). They are thought to be ideal to use growing in front of borders and in rock gardens. They can also be grown on a peat bank amongst rhododendrons. It can be found growing on the rock gardens at Kew Gardens. =Propagation= Iris kerneriana can also be propagated by division or by seed growing. Since, it resents being disturbed, seed growing is the best option. Seeds can be collected from the dried seed capsules on the iris (after it has flowered). They can then be sown at any time, but winter or early spring gives better results, since they prefer a cold spell in damp conditions. Seeds should be covered with a very, fine layer of sand or grit. The seeds take a very long time to germinate, sometimes not appearing for many months. If they do not appear within 6 to 12 weeks, the seed tray should be then placed within a fridge for a short period (four weeks). Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (especially the rhizome and leaves), if ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction. Uses In Turkish folk medicine, the rhizomes of Iris species called Turkey ‘navruz’ or ‘su¨sen’ have been applied as diuretics, carminatives and laxatives. References Sources *Davis, P.

It is a rhizomatous perennial plant, with yellow, white or violet flowers. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. It comes from a wide range from eastern Europe to China in Asia. It was known for a long while as a subspecies of Iris spuria, before being treated as a separate species in its own right. Description It is similar in form to Iris orientalis but it is shorter. It has stout, thick, purple brown rhizomes, which can be 1.3–3 cm in diameter. Under the rhizome are thick roots. The rhizome spreads along the ground in a creeping habit. It has greyish-green, linear, erect, sword-shaped, leaves. That can grow up to long, and 0.7–2 cm wide. The leaves do not have a mid-vein. The leaves and foliage are sometimes longer than the flowering stems. Similar to Iris spuria, they also have the ability to produce an offensive smell, when the leaves are bruised. It has a smooth, long flowering stem. It has 1–4 very short lateral branches. The stems hold 3–8 flowers, 3–4 per stem, terminal (top of stem), in early summer, between May and June. The lanceolate and membranous at the top, spathes are long and 2 cm wide. It has flowers that are in diameter, ranging in colour from white, yellowish to grey purple, and violet. It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'.} It has fiddle=shaped falls, with a narrow section between the claw (section closest to the stem) and limb or blade (outer part). The claw is 2–3 cm long and 0.5 cm wide and the oblong or rounded limb is 1.5 cm long and 1 cm wide. Normally, the limb bends downwards. It has an erect, oblanceolate standard, which is 3.5 cm long and 6–8 mm wide. Some references mention pale to dark yellow forms with darker veining. This is Iris spuria subsp. halophila (Pall.) B.Mathew & Wendelbo. It has a 1.5–3 cm long pedicel, a short, 1 cm long perianth tube, 3 cm long stamens, yellow anthers and 3.5–4 cm long ovary. The style branches (in white or yellow, depending on the petal colour) are 3.5 cm long and 6 mm wide. They are as long as the claw of the petals. After the iris has flowered, between July and August it produces a greenish brown, ellipsoid-cylindric (shaped) seed capsule, measuring long and 2-2.5 cm wide. It has ridges and beak on the top. Normally in pairs of capsules. Inside, are pyriform (pear shaped), paper- like seeds, with a glossy or wrinkled (rugose), yellowish maroon, seed coat (or testa). =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes. This can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has been counted many times; 2n=44, 66, Lenz & Day, 1963; 2n=20, Lungeanu, 1970. 2n=44, is the accepted count number. In 2003, a study was carried out into the chemical structure of seeds of Iris halophila, it found new chemical compounds including halophilol A and a new tetrastilbene, halophilol B. In 2007, the anti-oxidative components of the rhizome of Iris halophila were studied in Li Xiao Fei's (of Xinjiang University) Master's thesis. Several chemical compounds were found including, flavones, phenolic compounds amylose and organic acid. The salt tolerance and absorption qualities of the iris have been studied.Marius-Nicusor Grigore, Lacramioara Ivanescu and Constantin Toma In 2012, a genetic study was carried out on Iris laevigata and several of its closely related iris species, including Iris ensata, Iris setosa, Iris halophila, Iris scariosa, Iris potaninii, Iris tenuifolia, Iris bloudowii, and Iris sanguinea. In 2014, a study was carried out to work out the cross-breeding barriers between two Iris species, Iris halophila and Iris pseudacorus. a post-zygotic barrier was found to be the main obstacle. Taxonomy Clump of Iris halophila, seen in Botanical Garden of Moscow State University The Latin specific epithet halophila refers to salt loving. It had the common name of long leafed flag,John Sims (Editor)Liverpool Botanical GardenWilliam Salisbury It is known as the salt marsh iris in Germany. It is written as 喜盐鸢尾 in Chinese script and known as xi yan yuan wei in Pinyin Chinese. It was first published as Iris spuria subsp. halophila, by Peter Simon Pallas in 'Reise Russ. Reich.' Vol.2 page733. in 1773. It was then 3 years later re-published as Iris halophila by Pallas in 'Reise Russ. Reich.' Vol3 page713 in 1776. Most plant authors and botanists classed it as a subspecies of Iris spuria, including Brian Mathew in 1981 in his book 'The Iris'. It was still verified as Iris halophila by United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service on 9 January 2003. As of February 2015, it is incorrectly listed as a synonym of Iris spuria by the RHS. Native Iris halophila is native to a wide range of temperate regions, from western Europe to Central Asia. =Range= It is found in the western European countries of Germany, Romania and Ukraine. In the middle Asian countries of (the former Soviet Union republics of); it is found in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. It is also found in Iran (or Persia,), Pakistan and Afghanistan and within the Caucasus area of Russia. It is found in west Asian countries and regions of Siberia, Mongolia and China. Within China, it is found in the Chinese provinces of Gansu and Xinjiang. =Habitat= Iris halophila is grown on wet grasslands or meadows, on hillsides, beside rivers and on wet salty soils or salt marshes. Cultivation It is hardy to −25 °C. It is known to lose the leaves in the winter, leaving a few short leaf tips. It prefers moist, heavy soils but can tolerate most other soils. It prefers positions in full sun. It is very hardy, seeds very readily and so springs up where more delicate species have died out. It is thought to be best planted between August and September. Uses It is used in Chinese herbal medicines to treat hematochezia and various other problems.Jiaju Zhou, Guirong Xie and Xinjian Yan A research specimen exists in the Linnean Society of London herbarium. Hybrids and cultivars Iris halophila var. sogdiana (Bunge) Grubov is a known variant, although this was only recently thought as a synonym of Iris halophila. References Sources *Czerepanov, S.

It holds public Services of Remembrance, of any or no religious faith, across the UK to acknowledge the loss of a baby by their families, and by arranging specialist support divisions to help people with their associated grief and trauma. It is one of the organizations that supports baby loss awareness week. Clark-Coates and her husband Andy set up the trust after remortgaging their home. The charity soon generated more than 600,000 online hits per month. There are now 250 volunteers – doctors, midwives, counsellors, fundraisers, and ambassadors including Nigella Lawson and Gabby Logan. It is a British charity that supports people through miscarriages, infant death, stillbirth and other problems with pregnancy and early parenthood. The charity has organised numerous \\"Saying Goodbye\\" services at cathedrals and minsters around Britain as well as fundraising events. Background The organisation was founded by Zoe and Andy Clark-Coates, who lost five babies through miscarriage and wanted to use their experiences to help others. It launched in August 2012 and became a charity in March 2013. The primary aim of the charity is to support people who have lost a baby during any stage of pregnancy, at birth or during infancy. Around one in four pregnancies in the UK (around 250,000 per year) end in a miscarriage, with a further 4,000 through stillbirth and infant deaths. The couple set up the charity because they believe that miscarriages and infant death are a taboo subject in Britain and that people can find it difficult to talk about. Events The charity holds various \\"Saying Goodbye\\" services at cathedrals and minsters around Britain, with around 20 taking place in 2014. Locations have included cathedrals at Bradford, Lichfield, Derby, Exeter, York, Portsmouth and Glasgow. The services are provided for free and to all people of any or no faith. The charity's work is supported by volunteers who organise various fundraising events around the country. Sky diving events, called 'Jump for Love', have taken place in eight locations across Britain in association with the charity. The charity aims to have 254 'jumpers', one for every 1000 babies lost each year. One event in Bristol was undertaken by a mother who had lost a baby two years prior in a miscarriage. Ambassadors and advocates The charity has a range of ambassadors and advocates.

The character has been depicted as an ally of the antihero the Punisher. He was created by Chuck Dixon and John Romita Jr., and first appeared in The Punisher War Zone Vol. 1, #1 (March 1992).  Publication history  The character first appeared in a story-arc that spanned The Punisher War Zone Vol. 1, #1-6, and was also present in #9-10, #23, #31, #41, and both of The Punisher War Zone Annuals.

Fictional character biography  A career criminal living in Sheepshead Bay, Mickey claims to be Italian, but is in fact Albanian. While robbing a Chinese restaurant where Triad money is being held, Mickey and his gang are attacked by the Punisher, who guns down all of the thieves save Mickey. Via psychological torture, the Punisher coerces Mickey into sponsoring him (under the alias \\"Johnny Tower\\") for membership in the Carbones, a Brooklyn crime family. When Salvatore, the younger brother of the head of the Carbones, becomes suspicious of Mickey and \\"Johnny\\" the two frame him for disloyalty, and are given permission to kill him by Salvatore's brother, Julius. The attempt on Salvatore's life goes awry, and ends with him falling through the ice of a frozen lake, where he is later found by the authorities, who admit him to a hospital as a John Doe. Mickey and the Punisher's identities as saboteurs are later discovered by Julius, who orders their execution, though the two are saved by Shotgun. The Punisher allows Mickey to live, on the condition that he become an informant for him, after Mickey helps him and Shotgun massacre the Carbones and the European syndicate that the Carbones had planned on uniting with on La Isla de Tiburones Durmientes. Mickey begins smuggling cigarettes in DeKalb, but his operation is shut down by the Punisher, who has Mickey assist Microchip with spying on the high-level criminals who are attending a summit in Las Vegas. Mickey and Microchip's investigation leads to them being captured by Hydra, though the two are able to stave off being executed by the organization by telling Werner von Strucker that they are members of the Secret Empire. The duo escape, track the Punisher down to a Nevada airport, and give him, Nomad, and Daredevil a drive back to New York City. A group of hitmen hired by Rosalie Carbone hunt Mickey down in order to obtain intel on the Punisher. After being interrogated by the assassins, Mickey is locked in the trunk of their car, which he escapes from due to the vehicle being hijacked and crashed by a Chinese gang. The Punisher goes to Mickey for information regarding visiting Yakuza and, after saving him from the Russian gangsters whose shipment of meat Mickey had stolen, learns from him that a number of foreign crime lords are going to be attending an auction in Atlantic City. The Punisher subsequently has Mickey, who had taken to bootlegging cartoons, tell him about a child pornographer living in Long Island, and help him rescue his stolen guard dog, Max. Salvatore Carbone, who had become a superhuman called Thorn, then finds and tries to get revenge on Mickey, but he is defeated by the Punisher. Mickey and Microchip team-up again to help the Punisher infiltrate and plant explosives in Manhattan Tower. When the Punisher seemingly dies blowing up Manhattan Tower, Mickey panics, and abandons Microchip. Mickey goes into hiding, but is located by Microchip, who convinces Mickey to help him rebuild his depleted crime fighting network, in the off chance that the Punisher survived the destruction of Manhattan Tower. Mickey becomes involved with counterfeiters, betrays them, and is saved from retribution by Microchip. After the Punisher catches him trying to steal telephone card numbers at an airport, Mickey tips the vigilante off about Russian mobsters who are arranging a deal with a Vietnamese gangster named Randy Kwoc. Later, the Punisher blows up Mickey's chop shop, and has Mickey tell him about an up-and-coming drug lord known as Cringe. The Punisher then moves into Mickey's trailer with the two hackers he had recruited to replace Microchip, with whom he had a falling out, not knowing that Mickey is secretly in contact with Cringe, who is really Microchip. A rogue S.H.I.E.L.D. operative called Stone Cold begins eliminating vigilantes, and attempts to find the Punisher by capturing and interrogating Mickey. While Stone Cold is out hunting the Punisher and Microchip, Mickey breaks the chair he was left tied to, and returns to his trailer, where he is taunted by a passing Bullseye. Stone Cold recaptures Mickey, but the informant is freed by agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Mickey later has information pertaining to a drug dealer known as Daddy Wronglegs beaten out of him by the Punisher. After Black Widow's car is hijacked, she and Dagger trace its whereabouts to Mickey's Salvage, a car lot that Mickey has established in Weehawken. Using her powers, Dagger is able to get Mickey to divulge the whereabouts of Black Widows's car. With his soul cleansed by Dagger's abilities, Mickey gives up his criminal ways and becomes religiously devout; when the Punisher finds Mickey in a Brooklyn church and discerns that he has genuinely changed, the vigilante severs all ties with him, musing, \\"So Mickey Fondozzi's found religion. You can't even trust a snitch anymore\\".  Other versions  Mickey is \\"a lousy little snitch\\" who is repeatedly accosted for information by the Punisher in The Punisher/Painkiller Jane. Painkiller Jane shoots Mickey to death after he tells her that he sold the Punisher out to a crime lord named Vinnie Veronica.  In other media  Mickey appears in the 2004 Punisher film, where the character is renamed Mickey Duka and portrayed by Eddie Jemison. An affiliate of the Saint crime family, Mickey is psychologically tortured (in a shot for shot recreation of his introduction in the comics) by the Punisher into helping him wipe out the Saints as revenge for wiping out his family. Mickey, who actually despises the Saints as much as Castle does, willingly becomes his mole afterwards and helps him cause the Saints to destroy each other before Castle personally kills Howard Saint.

After briefly living with his brother in Birmingham in England for part of 1886 he moved to London. He is noted as applying for membership of the Quaker Meeting House in Middlesex in April 1888. Here he met Marie Marthe Bobenrieth (1863–1955) from Lyon in France who married him shortly thereafter. After living in Acton, London in his self-designed house, Eden Hall, the couple retired to Hyères (a popular British hub) in France in 1933 where they lived in the Villa l’Ensoleillado (which he had purchased in 1926). He died there in 1941.

Gameplay As a variation of the Tetris concept, rather than having the objective of matching horizontal lines of blocks that descend from the top of the screen as tetrominos, instead the player matches the colors of the descending blocks (which include irregular tetromino shapes) to blocks already fixed on the game board, which causes blocks to disappear from the board when three blocks of the same color are matched, in a manner similar to the game Dr. Mario. Reception Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the SNES version an 8 out of 10, saying that \\"If you were a fan of the first one, then this one will definitely please.\\" They particularly praised the backgrounds and the two-player mode. Reviews of the NES version were more mixed.

Sir Alexander Lindsay of Glenesk (died 1381) was a Scottish knight banneret. Active in jousting and as a crusader he was in favour with the Scottish kings David II and Robert II. Biography Lindsay was the second surviving son to Sir David de Lindsay of Crawford and the Byres, and Mary Abernethy, widow of Andre de Leschelyn (Leslie), and a daughter and co-heiress of Alexander de Abernethy. Lindsay's father had been Constable of Edinburgh Castle and Berwick and active during the Wars of Independence. Lindsay was esquire to his cousin Thomas Stewart, 2nd Earl of Angus. Lindsay inherited his mother's lands in Angus, and also acquired some of the baronies allotted to his aunt Marget Aberhethy, Countess of Angus. Upon his marriage to Catherine Stirling around 1358, he consolidated his already large maternal inheritance, with that of his wife, which would add to the extensive landholdings of the Earldom of Crawford in north-east Scotland and elsewhere. Lindsay was knighted before 1368, He was party to a truce with England as \\"Chevalier et Baron\\" in 1369. He sealed with his nephew the settlements of the Crown (1371–1373) and was Justiciary in the North possibly as early of 1371 but definitely by 1373. He had many safe-conducts from the English kings Edward III and Richard II, and on December 1381, he obtained a passport to travel through England on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He died on Crete some time before March 1382. Family Lindsay married Catherine Stirling (died by 1378), widow of Andrew Leslie of that Ilk and daughter to John Stirling of Glenesk. They had children: *David Lindsay, 1st Earl of Crawford. *Sir Alexander Lindsay of Baltrody. He fought in a tournament with Ralph de Nevill 1391, a warrant to this effect being granted by King Richard II 20 June 1391. He had a pension from Crail, the entries in the Exchequer Rolls proving that he died between 1397 and 1398. He probably died childless. *Euphemia Lindsay, who married David Stewart, Earl of Strathearn Lindsay married secondly to Marjorie, daughter to Sir John Stewart of Ralston, and niece to Robert II of Scotland. They had children: *Sir William Lindsay of Rossie, known as one of those responsible for the death of David, Duke of Rothesay. He was tutor to David, younger son of the Earl of Crawford in 1407, executor to the Earl, had charter of lands in Ballenbreich from Earl Alexander in 1423. He married Matilda Stewart (died 1485). He died between 1435 and 1437. *Sir Walter Lindsay of Kinneff who was killed at the battle of Verneuil (1424). Katherine his widow married Walter Dempster. Sir Walter had a son also Walter *Euphemia Lindsay who was engaged to David Duke of Rothesay, but the marriage did not take place. Lindsay also had an illegitimate son Jon who was living in 1378. He also had a son James, Rector of St. Brioc, Canon and Treasurer of Aberdeen. He had dispensation for illegitimacy on taking Holy Orders, but as Sir Alexander Lindsay and his second wife must have been cousins James may have been their son.

It flows generally north through the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest in the Cascade Range east of Medford. The creek begins at above sea level near Howard Prairie Lake and enters the South Fork at Camp Latgawa. The South Fork flows northwest to meet the North Fork near Lake Creek; combined they form Little Butte Creek, a tributary of the Rogue River. Dead Indian Creek was so named in the 1850s when two Tututni died near its banks. According to Oregon Geographic Names, Dead Indian Mountain and Dead Indian Memorial Road are also named after the same incident in which two settlers found two dead Native Americans in deserted dwellings near the creek. The road, originally named \\"Dead Indian Road\\" but renamed to avoid being interpreted as denigrating, eventually extended from Ashland, past the mountain and the creek to Upper Klamath Lake.

Probably built sometime between 1825 and 1828, the main house is a fine local example of Federal style architecture. It is most notable, however, for the murals drawn on its walls by Jonathan Poor, an itinerant artist active in Maine in the 1830s. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The McCleary Farm complex is set on the west side of South Strong Road, just north of its crossing of McCleary Brook, on a parcel of . It consists of a typical New England connected farmstead, with a main house block connected to a piggery and chicken house via an ell off the southwest corner. The complex also includes a 19th-century barn and blacksmith shop, and a 20th-century garage. Both the barn and blacksmith shop appear to be contemporaneous to the house. The main block of the house is a rectangular wood-frame structure 2-1/2 stories tall and five bays wide, with a side gable roof, twin interior chimneys, and a granite foundation. A single-story hip-roof porch extends across the southern gable end, whose wall is flush with that of the rear ell. The main entrance is in the east-facing facade; it is framed by sidelight windows and a semi-elliptical transom window with a cornice above. The interior follows a typical central hall plan, with parlor and living room on either side of the hall in front, and the kitchen (which extends into the ell) and a bedroom in the rear. The living room features typical Federal style woodwork, and the parlor has flush wainscoting, with its plaster walls covered with painted murals. Jonathan Poor (1807–45) was the nephew of Rufus Porter (1792-1884), whose varied career included a period (1815–24) in which he worked has an itinerant painter. Poor learned the trade and techniques from his uncle, whose guidelines for creating murals were published in the 1825 book Curious Arts. Poor's adherence to Porter's guidelines in creating murals means that attribution of work to him specifically is difficult. The murals in this house, which depict a generalized New England rolling hill scene, with mountains, Federal period houses, and a water scene, all elements recommended by Porter. They are painted in bold colors, with some detailed elements stenciled. The farm was established by Robert McCleary, who cleared the land, and the house was built for his son William, probably between 1825 and 1828. The property is notable as one of the oldest surviving post-and-beam houses in Strong, and for the number of surviving early outbuildings, including the barn and the blacksmith shop, which includes remnants of the original forge.

This has led the health authorities in Norway to give authorization upon graduating, so that Norwegian graduates would have the same rights as foreign graduates. Now the internship programme is a part of the specialist-education. Admissions The requirements for admission is the completion of high school with additional science subjects (Mathematics R1 or S1+S2, Physics 1, Chemistry 1 and 2). The grade point requirements are dependent on the number of available spots in the programme, and because the number of appliers are extremely high on all of the medical programmes in Norway, the grade point requirement is considered very high relative to other study programmes in Norway.

After the persecution of Falun Gong began in 1999, they were isolated, fragmented, and looking for a way to organize and change government policy. They went online, used code words, avoided precise details and communicated in short bursts. But like a cat listening to mice, the 6-10 Office could find their exact location, having developed the ability to search and spy as a result of a joint venture between the Shandong Province public security bureau and Cisco Systems. The result was a comprehensive database of people's personal information, including the 6-10 Office's Falun Gong lists and a wraparound surveillance system that was quickly distributed to other provinces. The Chinese authorities called it the Golden Shield, and Hao Fengjun used it on a daily basis. \\"As far as following practitioners\\" he said, \\"the Golden Shield includes the ability to monitor online chatting services and email, identifying Internet Protocol addresses and all of the person's previous communication, and then being able to lock in on the person's location, because a person will usually use the computer at home or at work.\\" Then the arrest is made.Ethan Gutmann (May/June 2010) \\"Hacker Nation: China's Cyber Assault\\" , World Affairs Journal In 2011, two lawsuits were filed in U.S. federal courts against Cisco Systems alleging that its technology enabled the government of China to monitor, capture, and kill Chinese citizens for their views and beliefs.\\"Human Rights Verdict Could Affect Cisco in China\\", Global Voices Online, 24 April 2013 Evidence of Cisco's activities in China had become public in Gutmann's book Losing the New China: A Story of American Commerce, Desire and Betrayal.\\"Suit Claims Cisco Helped China Pursue Falun Gong\\", The New York Times, 22 May 2011 =Organ harvesting in China= In 2006, allegations emerged that a large number of Falun Gong practitioners had been killed to supply China's organ transplant industry.

The new book, which took seven years, was based on interviews with top-ranking police officials, former prisoners of conscience and Chinese doctors who killed prisoners on the operating table. Gutmann interviewed dissidents including of Falun Gong, Tibetans, Uighurs and House Christians. In 2016, Gutmann, David Kilgour, and David Matas authored an updated investigative report on China's organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience. The 700-page report contains extensive information on the actual transplant statistics, sourced directly to Chinese hospitals' own publications and other Chinese primary sources. The report has been widely publicized by Chinese officials in The New York Times, The Globe and Mail, The Times, CNN, The Independent, and several other major media outlets around the world. Controversies in Taiwan = 2014 Taipei mayoral election = During the 2014 Taipei City mayoral election there was controversy about what Gutmann's book, The Slaughter: Mass Killings, Organ Harvesting, and China's Secret Solution to Its Dissident Problem, published in August 2014, said about mayoral candidate Ko Wen-je. Gutmann stated he had not said that Ko was involved in the organ trade and that he might have been misinterpreted.\\"Ko denies organ buying allegations\\", Taipei Times, 29 October 2014 On 27 November, Gutmann released a legal response with lawyer Clive Ansley, stating that \\"no English-speaking reader to date has understood for one moment that Dr. Ko was acting as an organ broker\\" and \\"Mr. Gutmann believes, and we think his book demonstrates, that Dr. Ko has acted honourably\\".葛特曼律師回函 澄清柯P沒參與器官仲介 27 November 2014, newtalk.tw On 29 November, Ko won the election.

In a news conference in Taipei on 2 October, Gutmann was asked if he had changed his mind about Ko, in which he answered “yes”.'Slaughter' author says Chinese used Taipei Mayor Ko's tech to transplant Falun Gong prisoners' organs 2 October 2018, Taiwan News Gutmann showed a group photograph of Ko attending a conference on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation training in China and said Ko had told him he knew about organ harvesting of Falun Gong members in 2005, but Gutmann had discovered that the conference took place only three months before he interviewed Ko. “Dr. Ko did not say explicitly what he did in the mainland,” Gutmann said, adding that Ko did not tell him whether he was making money or arranging for patients to receive organ transplants in China. At the end of the news conference, Gutmann said he thought Ko was a liar. He was sued by Ko and was subpoenaed on October 5, 2018.\\"Ko’s office asks author to explain change of stance\\",Taipei Times,2 October 2018  Views  =Falun Gong issues= In 2012 Gutmann stated, \\"There is a long-standing taboo in the journalism community about Falun Gong, about this issue [organ harvesting]. To touch this issue is the Third Rail of journalism. If you touch it—if you are in Beijing, if you are based in China—you will not be given access to top leaders anymore.\\" Reception to books Jay Nordlinger, a senior editor of National Review, wrote that Gutmann's 2004 book Losing the New China: A Story of American Commerce, Desire and Betrayal \\"was about the sordid relationship between the American business community and the Chinese Communist Party. Our businessmen accommodate themselves to the Communist Party, and turn a blind eye to persecution.\\" Sometimes they even assist the persecution, as when Cisco and other technology companies devised special ways to monitor and arrest Falun Gong practitioners\\". Nordlinger called Gutmann's 2014 book The Slaughter: Mass Killings, Organ Harvesting, and China's Secret Solution to Its Dissident Problem \\"another atom bomb\\".

It occurs when nerve endings of the lower thoracic intercostal nerves (7–12) are 'entrapped' in abdominal muscles, causing a severe localized nerve (neuropathic) pain that is usually experienced at the front of the abdomen. ACNES syndrome is frequently overlooked and unrecognized, although the incidence is estimated to be 1:2000 patients. The relative unfamiliarity with this condition often leads to significant diagnostic delays and misdiagnoses, often resulting in unnecessary diagnostic interventions and futile procedures. Physicians often misdiagnose ACNES as irritable bowel syndrome or \\"functional disorders\\", as symptoms of the condition are not dispositive.  Signs and symptoms  Affected individuals typically experience limited relief from standard pain relieving medication, with the exception of some neuroleptic agents. Patients frequently experience 'pseudovisceral' phenomena or symptoms of altered autonomic nervous system function including nausea, bloating, abdominal swelling, loss of appetite with consecutively lowered body weight or an altered defecation process. Pain is typically related to tensing the abdominal wall muscles, so any type of movement is prone to aggravate pain. Lying quietly can be the least painful position. Most patients report that they cannot sleep on the painful side.  Diagnosis  Once ACNES is considered based on the patient's history, the diagnosis can be made via a thorough physical examination: looking for a painful spot, which worsens by tensing the abdominal muscles with lifting the head and straightened legs (Carnett's sign). Almost always, a small area of maximal pain is covered by a larger area of altered skin sensibility with somatosensory disturbances such as hypoesthesia as well as hyperesthesia or hyperalgesia and change of cool perception. Pinching the skin between thumb and index finger is extremely painful compared to the opposite non-involved side. Confirmation of a diagnosis of ACNES is warranted using an abdominal wall infiltration with a local anesthetic agent near the painful spot.  Treatment  Treatment consists of several such anesthetic injections, sometimes combined with corticosteroids. Such an approach yields persistent pain relief in two-thirds of patients. This beneficial effect on pain has been demonstrated in a prospective double blind trial. The physical volume of the injection may also break apart the adhesions or fibrosis responsible for the entrapment symptoms. Patients who do not respond to a stratagem of repetitive local trigger point injections can be offered a surgical approach. Terminal branches of an intercostal nerve are removed at the level of the anterior sheath of the rectus abdominal muscle ('anterior neurectomy'). Several larger series demonstrated a successful response in approximately two out of three patients, which was confirmed in another prospective double blind surgical trial: 73% of the patients who underwent a neurectomy were pain free, compared to 18% in the non-nerve resected group. Patients not responding to an anterior neurectomy, or those in whom the pain syndrome recurs after an initial pain free period (10%) may choose to undergo secondary surgery. This involves a repeated exploration combined with a posterior neurectomy. This procedure has been shown to be beneficial in 50% of cases.  Epidemiology  This syndrome is predominantly found in young women, but also occurs in children, teenagers and octogenarians.

(17 March 1926 – 1 February 2015) was an Irish Jesuit priest, physicist, and philosopher of science. He was William A. Gaston Professor of Philosophy at Georgetown University.  Biography  Patrick A. Heelan was born in Dublin to an Irish father and a Belgian mother. He joined the Society of Jesus at 16, received his B.A. in 1947 and his M.A. in 1948, all with first-class Honors, in mathematics and mathematical physics at University College, Dublin during which time he also worked with Erwin Schrödinger and John Synge at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies both mathematicians famous for their work in General Relativity and Cosmology. In 1948, he won a prestigious fellowship (a Travelling Studentship that paid for doctoral studies abroad anywhere in the world) and his superior directed him to take his doctorate in geophysics and seismology at the Institute of Geophysics at St. Louis University as a junior Jesuit scholastic, where he specialised in the philosophy of science with a concentration on the philosophy of modern physics with a novel approach from the phenomenological and hermeneutical perspective of Husserl and Heidegger. He then taught physics at UCD for several years before being asked by the Archbishop of Dublin to teach the philosophy of science. Patrick Heelan's sense that he needed more philosophy for this brought him, in two steps, first to an encounter with Bernard Lonergan's 1957 book Insight (starting with the original notes in Latin), and then after a two-year post-doc working with Eugene Wigner at Princeton University (1960–62) at the Institute for Advanced Studies, which also gave him, at the start his first experience at Fordham University, Dr Heelan returned to Europe to pursue a second doctorate in philosophy (September 1962 – 1964) at the Catholic University of Louvain at Leuven (in Belgium) where he worked with Jean Ladrière, studying both logic and Husserlian philosophy (Ladrière would write the biographical entries on Patrick Heelan, including his first book, for the French Encyclopédie Philosophique Universelle). He defended his dissertation (with félications du jury) and published Quantum Mechanics and Objectivity in 1965 (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Table of Contents and Preface). During the same period he began his visits and correspondence with Werner Heisenberg himself at the Max- Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics in Munich, a contact Heelan maintained until Heisenberg's death in 1976. In 1965, Heelan joined the philosophy department at Fordham University. He would leave in 1970 at the invitation of John Toll, then the president of State University of New York at Stony Brook, to chair (and to build) the department of philosophy where over the next 22 years he would also fill several major positions in the administration of the University. He published his second major study, Space Perception and the Philosophy of Science with the University of California Press in 1983, which examines the geometry of vision including the space of art and experience and draws on Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty. He came to Georgetown University as Executive Vice-President for the Main Campus in 1992 and in 1995, he became the William A. Gaston Professor of Philosophy. The year of 2002, saw the publication of a festschrift, edited by Babette Babich, Hermeneutic Philosophy of Science, Van Gogh's Eyes, and God: Essays in Honor of Patrick A. Heelan, S.J. which appeared as Volume 225 in the Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science. His third book, The Observable, also edited by Babette Babich came out in 2016 although written almost a half a century before; completed while Heisenberg was still living, it dealt with Heisenberg, Bohr, and Pauli, in addition to Einstein. Patrick Heelan, who continued to write and to teach until he retired from the philosophy department in 2013, returned to Dublin in 2014. He died in Dublin in 2015.

Tomo) Hiroishi, Kota Fujii, Daisuke Wakabayashi, and Sohei Oyama. Tomo was born and raised in Mexico City, while the rest of the band grew up in Japan. They met while studying at the Berklee College of Music in Massachusetts and formed the band in 2004. The Ricecookers’ songs are written by Tomo Hiroishi and Kota Fujii, in English and Japanese. Each band member brings different influences from a variety of genres including blues, funk, techno, and jazz to their sound. Tokyo Calendar said that \\"Their deep understanding of modern music, learned at the prestigious Berklee College of Music, is reflected in their strong yet sensitive progressive rock sound”. Their performance is memorable with Tomomi Hiroishi’s hard yet transparent voice, while the powerful and beautiful sound is created by Daisuke Wakabayashi, Sohei Oyama and Kota Fujii. The band is known for their explosive live performance.  History  = 2004~2008 (Early Years) = The band members enrolled at Berklee College of Music from separate paths, but soon met and became fast friends. In 2004, Tomomi Hiroishi asked Kota Fujii and Masaki Minami to start a rock band hoping to bring together their interest in different genres of music. Original members of The Ricecookers were Tomomi Hiroishi (vocals, guitar), Kota Fujii (guitar), Masaki Minami (guitar), Daisuke Wakabayashi (bass), and Tom Ulichny (drums). The band performed at a wide range of venues in Boston and surrounding areas, most of their music inspired by groups like Rage Against the Machine, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Maceo Parker and Audioslave. In 2006, Masaki Minami decided to go back to Japan leaving the band, and Sohei Oyama replaced Tom Ulichny as the official drummer; creating The Rice cookers as we know them today. That same year, they released their first self-produced album, “1st Blood” in the United States. = 2008~ = In 2008, The Ricecookers met New York producer Shunji Okada, and collaborated to record their first EP, Four of our Songs. They appeared in events such as Japan Day @ Central Park, to broaden their horizons. As they worked towards becoming known in the New York area, they debuted in the spring of 2010 in Japan, on a Tokyo tour where film director Yukihiko Tsutsumi saw their performance, purely by chance, and quickly bought the rights to their song Nami No Yukisaki for his upcoming television drama series, “Spec” on Tokyo Broadcasting System Television Network in Japan. The Ricecookers made history in Japan by becoming the first unknown indie band to be featured as the theme song for a drama series. The media described their dramatic debut as a “never before seen miracle”, and they were also the very first band to custom produce different versions of the same song to fit each episode of the series. After the tour The Ricecookers returned to the United States and relocated to New York City from Boston, where they recorded their second EP, Chacmool. Soon after its release in Sept 2010, “Chacmool” became the #1 selling Alternative Rock Album on iTunes Japan. The Ricecookers once again travelled to Japan for their second tour, this time hitting 5 different cities throughout the country. The Ricecookers performing at the Under the Shoes eventThey also started a two- band event “Under the Shoes” with another Japanese rock band called, Response. Their final event at Star Lounge in Tokyo was filmed and aired on BS Fuji TV Network and later released on DVD. On October 8, 2010, their single Nami No Yukisaki aired on a Friday night weekly drama series on TBS Network, “Spec” as its theme song. Along with the premiere of the program, the band became the #7 most searched keyword on GOOGLE Japan. In December 2010, Anchor Records released the 10 different bilingual versions of Nami no Yukusaki and its music video as a CD-DVD set titled Nami no Yukusaki TV Special Collection. This CD ranked #1 on the Indie Album & Single Sales Chart on the Billboard JAPANTop Independent Albums and Singles Japan ChartsBillboard JAPAN and #6 on Oricon Charts. During the same month, The Ricecookers travelled to Japan for their last tour of the year, and once again hosted “Under the Shoes Vol. 2” event in Tokyo. They ended the tour headlining for the “Spec Final Episode Event” at Akasaka Blitz in Tokyo. Live recordings from this performance along with their new single, “Lost Raven”, was released by Anchor Records as a mini album titled, Eat, Breathe and Live in April 2011. Shortly after its release, “Lost Raven” was featured as the theme song for the Japanese variety show, “Summers no Yaritaga☆ga~ri~” airing weekly on Thursday nights on the TBS Network. The release of this album caught the eye of a renowned Bi-Lingual magazine called Commons & Sense man, who interviewed The Ricecookers, furthering the acknowledgment of the band to a wider audience. In July 2011, The Ricecookers released their first album entitled sélf. The album was produced by Shunji Okada, recorded by Ted Young and Kabir Hermon, and was mastered by the Grammy Award Winner George Marino. During the same month, The Ricecookers went on their fourth tour to Japan and held their first 90-minute solo-performances titled, “The Ricecookers self-ish” at La.mama in Tokyo and Taku Taku in Kyoto. Following their solo performance, they returned to New York and attended their first CMJ Music Marathon, which was followed by a nomination in the “Independent Artist of the Year 2011” category by Billboard Japan. In April 2012, they released Showtime in Japan, and Paradise in the USA at the same time. This release was followed by another Japanese CD release, under the title Pied Piper. Live performance by The Ricecookers during the Spec movie event In 2012, the TV drama series \\"Spec\\" debuted its first movie, in which The Ricecookers performed yet another version of Nami No Yukusaki. Due to the band contributing the theme song for the movie as well as the TV series, they were invited to the movie premiere event, which was held in Tokyo. 2012 was also the year they performed at Rising Sun Rock Festival in Japan, becoming one of the many celebrated artists from Japan, performing at this highly recognized event. Ending the year with a bang, The Ricecookers appeared on a famous Japanese year end countdown TV show titled Count Down TV, broadcast live throughout Japan, ringing-in 2013 on live TV. Starting in 2013, The Ricecookers have been participating in a charitable music event in New York every March, to raise fund for the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami victims and survivors. of the real was also released in 2013, and stirred up some buzz, as they got the famous Akihiro Nishino, a Japanese comedian/clay animation artist to create a Music Video for them. 2013 was also the year in which The Ricecookers went on the \\"Standing Egg Tour\\", where they toured 4 major states in the East Coast, including their home ground New York, and the band's birthplace Boston. The Ricecookers went on the Standing Egg Tour with Uzuhi, another New York based punk rock band and Kagero, a punk jazz band directly imported from Japan for this tour. The tour was a mixture of various types of music, one normally would not have the chance to see on the same stage on the same night, thus making it a success. The event was covered by various Japanese media. After performing at CMJ Music Marathon again that year, they released their latest full album parallax in Japan. This latest product is available not only in Japan but in America as well, via iTunes America starting in 2014. In 2014, the band was invited to perform for the long running charity event held in New York City titled Rock For Hope, where all the proceeds will be donated to fund the educational programs for financially underprivileged children in China. The sumer of 2014 also marked the bands Otakon debut. The Ricecookers were invited by the famous Otakon held at the Baltimore Convention Center every year to perform. The convention was kicked off with an event titled \\"Matsuri\\", which the band performed in. The next day, the band performed again, with an acoustic set. Their performance at the Otakon collided with the release of The Ricecookers' newest EP titled \\"again and again\\". In January 2015, the band was invited to perform at KotoriCon at Rowan College at Gloucester County in Sewell, New Jersey.

Early life The daughter of Josephine Wouassimba, a Banziri woman, and Pierre Gerbillat, a French businessman and adventurer, Andrée Blouin was born in Bessou, a village in Oubangui-Chari (later the Central African Republic). At the time of Andrée's birth, her mother was 14 years old, and her father was 41. At three years of age Andrée was taken from her mother by her father and his new wife Henriette Poussart, and placed in the Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny orphanage for girls of mixed race, where she endured neglect and abuse. At her 15, the nuns tried to pressure her in an arranged marriage. She spent 14 years in the orphanage before she and two other girls ran away in 1938.  Personal life  After escaping from the orphanage, Andrée moved with her mother to Brazzaville began work as a seamstress. While riding on a riverboat in the Congo River, Andrée met a Belgian aristocrat named Roger Serruys. Soon afterwards, she moved in with Serruys to Banningville, where he was appointed the new director of the Belgian Kasai Company. Frustrated by his insistence that their relationship be kept a secret, Andrée returned home to Brazzavile three months pregnant. She gave birth to her daughter Rita on her 19th birthday, December 16, 1940. Andrée met a local Frenchman named Charles Greutz, and they welcomed a son René on her 21st birthday, December 16, 1942. At two years of age, René fell ill with malaria but was refused treatment in local hospitals because of his African ancestry and before long he died from complications related to the disease. Tramautized by the experience, Andrée decided that Rita should not grow up in colonial Africa, and after legally marrying Greutz, she and her daughter relocated to France in 1946. Greutz stayed behind in Bangui to work, while Andrée and Rita resided with the Greutz family in the town of Gebviller in Alsace. Andrée returned to Bangui in 1948, and learned that her husband Charles was having an affair. Not long afterwards she met French engineer André Blouin, one of her husband's contemporaries, who was on assignment for the French Bureau of Mines. The two fell in love, and after Andrée's divorce from Greutz was finalized, she and André Blouin were married in 1952. The couple went on to have two children, a son named Patrick and a daughter named Sylviane. Activism Andrée Blouin credits the untimely death of her young son as her primary motivation for becoming a political activist later in life. Her son's death from malaria could have been prevented with the right medication; however, because of his African ancestry, he was denied the proper medical treatment. Blouin launched a campaign against the Quinine Law that prohibited individuals of African ancestry in French Equatorial Africa from receiving appropriate medication to treat malaria. In the 1950s, she left her new husband and her daughter to travel to Guinea to support the country's independence movement. Blouin joined Sékou Touré, the leader of the Guinean Democratic Party, in the fight for independence from France. After being expelled from Guinea by French President Charles de Gaulle for her political activism, she returned to Central Africa to support the struggle for independence from France. She organized and mobilized women for the Parti Solidaire Africain, an organization from Belgian Congo whose goal was freeing Africa from colonial rule. She later became chief of protocol in Patrice Lumumba's government, formed during the aftermath of Congolese independence from France. Blouin was expelled from the Congo in 1960 just before Lumumba was executed by political rivals. In 1973, her husband divorced her and she then decided to settle in Paris. In Europe, she continued her work as an advocate for gender and social equality, as well as for economic justice in various African countries. During her life, her activism rose concerns in the Western world: the Eisenhower administration and the Belgian authorities worried about her supposed Communist links and the New York Times called her an “advocate of extreme African nationalism.” However, she described herself as a socialist who was committed to African nationalism.  End of life  At the end of her life, she was diagnosed with lymphoma and she was depressed. She died on April 9, 1986. Literary works Blouin's autobiography, My Country, Africa: Autobiography of a Black Pasionaria, was published in English in 1983.  Further reading  * My Country, Africa.

Developed in parallel to sensitivity analysis, its earliest mention can be found in a thesis from 1952. Since then, there have been considerable developments for the cases of multiple parameters, presence of integer variables as well as nonlinearities. In particular the connection between parametric programming and model predictive control established in 2000 has contributed to an increased interest in the topic.  Notation  In general, the following optimization problem is considered : \\\\begin{align} J^*(\\\\theta) = {} \\\\min_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb R^n} \\\\ & f(x,\\\\theta) \\\\ \\\\text{subject to}\\\\ & g(x,\\\\theta)\\\\leq 0. \\\\ \\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta \\\\subset \\\\mathbb R^m \\\\end{align} where x is the optimization variable, \\\\theta are the parameters, f(x,\\\\theta) is the objective function and g(x,\\\\theta) denote the constraints. The set \\\\Theta is generally referred to as parameter space.  Classification  Depending on the nature of f(x,\\\\theta) and g(x,\\\\theta) and whether the optimization problem features integer variables, parametric programming problems are classified into different sub-classes: * If more than one parameter is present, i.e. m > 1, then it is often referred to as multiparametric programming problem * If integer variables are present, then the problem is referred to as (multi)parametric mixed-integer programming problem * If constraints are affine, then additional classifications depending to nature of the objective function in (multi)parametric (mixed-integer) linear, quadratic and nonlinear programming problems is performed.

The present church building, in Gothic Revival style, was erected from 1882 onwards at the Gaudigplatz, and also serves as a concert venue. It replaced a former building at a different location. The former building was built in 1507. After the Reformation, it was used as a Lutheran church until 1539, and again from 1712 to 1885. It was demolished in 1886. With 87 metres (285 ft) it is Leipzig's tallest church.  History  The Peterskirche, sometimes called Alte Peterskirche (Old St. Peter) to distinguish it from the later building at a different location) was built close to one of the four city gates and adjacent to the wall. The quarter around it was called Petersviertel (St. Peter's quarter). The church was dedicated on 29 March 1507. After the Reformation, the church was abandoned in 1539. The building served as storage and during the Thirty Years' War as barracks. In 1704, the minister of St. Thomas's church suggested that the building should be used again for religious purposes. It was rebuilt, including a sacristy and two storeys. The first service was held on 29 May 1712. A new altar and organ were installed from 1797 to 1799. A bell tower was added in 1874. When the congregation outgrew the old church, minister and the church council decided in 1876 to build a new church. A property at the Schlettenplatz, south of the old city, was exchanged for the property of the old church. Eighty architects from all over Germany responded to a competition in 1877. The designs by August Hartel and Constantin Lipsius were chosen. Construction began in March 1882; the Grundsteinlegung (laying the foundation stone) was celebrated on 17 September that year. It was dedicated on 27 December 1885. The interior painting and stained glass windows were completed in 1886. The church was damaged during the bombing of Leipzig in World War II; its roof was largely destroyed and was left unrepaired for several years. Restoration was performed during the 1970s and again in the 1990s and 2000s.  Architecture  The church is built in a Gothic Revival style. It has the highest tower of any church in Leipzig, at . Its exterior is richly decorated, with stained-glass windows and a large portal on the western side.

It specifies a method for a learning system to invoke and to communicate with external systems. In the current version of the specification, v1.3, this is done using OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and JSON Web Tokens. For example, a Learning Management System (LMS) may use LTI to host course content and tools provided by external, third-party systems on a web site, without requiring a learner to log in separately on the external systems, with information about the learner and the learning context shared by the LMS with the external systems. History * Learning Tools Interoperability, then called BasicLTI, originated in 2008 as a Google Summer of Code project developed by Jordi Piguillem under the mentorship of Charles Severance and Marc Alier. *In June 2010 LTI v1.0 was finalized. *In August 2012, LTI v1.1 added the ability for the external tool to pass grades back to the invoking system. *In January 2014, LTI v2.0 was released, providing REST- based two-way communication between the external tool and the invoking platform. At the same time, a subset of v2.0 was released as v1.2, as a stepping stone between v1.1 and v2.0. *Due to complexity, adoption of LTI v1.2 and v2.0 was slow, and IMS GLC subsequently declared them to be \\"legacy\\" specifications, not in the recommended upgrade path from LTI v1.1, citing security concerns. * In May 2019, the IMS Security Framework and LTI v1.3 were published, based on OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and JWT.

In the related process of kleptoplasty, the predator sequesters plastids (especially chloroplasts) from dietary algae. The chloroplasts can still photosynthesize, but do not last long after the prey's cells are metabolised. If the predator can also sequester cell nuclei from the prey to encode proteins for the plastids, it can sustain them. Karyoklepty is this sequestration of nuclei; even after sequestration, the nuclei are still capable of transcription.

He is mostly known for hosting the programs Uncle Ted's Children's Party Some sources (Watson 1991, Times-Leader 2007) state that the name of Raub's show was \\"Uncle Ted's Children's Hour\\" instead of \\"Uncle Ted's Children's Party\\". in the 1960s, Uncle Ted's Ghoul School from 1974–1982 and Uncle Ted's Monstermania from 1984–1997. He was posthumously inducted into the Horror Host Hall Of Fame in 2014. According to his first sidekick Richard Briggs: \\"He was a living legend, one of those guys who was around when (television) started up, and there's not too many of those guys around anymore.\\" Early life and military service Edwin L. Raub (many resources erroneously list his middle initial as \\"C\\") was born May 14, 1921 in Kingston, Pennsylvania to Samuel J. and Margaret Lynn Raub, the oldest of two sons. He was married to the former Angela Wiffen who had grown up in Wallington, Surrey, England. They had two daughters, Rita and Beth, and a son, Edwin L., Jr. He had an uncle, named Edwin Hyde Raub, who fought during World War I, for the PA 109th Field Artillery A.E.F.; and died of pneumonia in Lyons, France. Pvt. Edwin Raub During the Second World War, as a radio operator with the 82nd Airborne Division's 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment Raub participated in D-Day and Operation Market Garden. According to author Cornelius Ryan's best-selling account of the battle, A Bridge Too Far: \\"When tracer bullets began ripping through his canopy, Private Edwin Raub became so enraged that he deliberately side-slipped his chute so as to land next to the anti-aircraft gun. Without removing his harness, and dragging his parachute behind him, Raub rushed the Germans with his Tommy gun. He killed one, captured the others, and then, with plastic explosives destroyed the flak-gun barrels.\\" A few days later during a German artillery barrage Pvt. Raub was severely burned on both of his hands when some gasoline cans near him exploded when hit; he later received two Purple Hearts. Raub was always humble about his wartime service and tended to downplay his efforts. In 1977 he told The Scranton Times, \\"I was in the paratroopers because it meant an additional $50 a month in pay. When I jumped from the plane, my main concern was just to get to the ground in one piece. Sure, I saw the shells' effects, but if I had had my choice, I wouldn't have landed right in the middle of the gun emplacement!\\" Early career It was during his wartime convalescence that Raub became interested in sleight-of-hand and card tricks, initially to regain the dexterity and function of his injured hands, later finding it a good way amuse himself and his fellow wounded comrades. Upon returning home he became a copywriter at local radio station WARM-FM. He also wrote dialog for commercials and would sometimes perform voice-over work. His card trick and magic hobby \\"just got away\\" and became a sideline, performing for churches and private parties then graduating to clubs, resorts, store promotions, fairs, schools, and \\"every mall in Northeastern Pennsylvania.\\" His initial foray into television was in the mid-1950s at WBRE-TV as a fill-in for a leprechaun character named Mr. Nobody, later performing on the same program as \\"Professor Feathers,\\" complete with homemade costume. Moving to WDAU-TV, Raub hosted his first program The Uncle Ted Show performing magic tricks for his studio audience. Advertisement for Uncle Ted's Children's Party His first notable success came with Uncle Ted's Children's Hour. A typical local television show of the time, it was broadcast live daily with Raub as the master of ceremonies. Besides his magic act it featured such fare as puppet shows, pantomimes and birthday parties. It became a success, and \\"Uncle Ted\\" a local celebrity. Raub felt it became a success because \\"I never talked down to the children, I did things that interested them. Entertained them. Children like to be fooled but they are tougher to fool than grownups.\\" Raub later tailored his school act to include a strong but entertaining anti-drug and alcohol message. Later career and success Throughout his broadcasting career Raub continued to work on and off behind the scenes as a copywriter, salesman, producer and announcer. Magic however, remained his true love. At the height of his popularity he performed between 400 and 500 shows a year. He constructed a special trailer for his supplies dubbed the \\"magic wagon' and towed it from show to show with his lime-green AMC Pacer. Raub also opened a magic shop in his hometown of Kingston with fellow magician Harry Crawford. It was this act that indirectly set Raub on the path he'd become most well-known for, horror host. In 1974 Raub began starring as the host Uncle Ted's Ghoul School Friday nights on the area's largest broadcaster, WNEP-TV. The show, which was originally broadcast live, featured skits and magic interspersed throughout the film shown. It was here that Uncle Ted developed his trademark, a tuxedo, bright red fez and bushy white moustache. During 1975 WNEP had hired a brash young reporter fresh out of college on his climb to national stardom, Bill O'Reilly. In his first book The O'Reilly Factor he relates that he had some \\"fierce creative differences\\" with the titular host. To supplement his income during his nine months at the station, O'Reilly wrote gags for Uncle Ted, who incensed him by mangling them on air because he was, according to O'Reilly, \\"usually half in the bag\\" during the telecasts. Raub's daughter, Beth Raub Bessmer strongly denies this allegation stating although her father was a recovering alcoholic he stopped drinking in June 1968. She also relates that he was a mentor and sponsor to many, when he died he was only three months shy of receiving his 30th anniversary Sobriety coin. The allegation is also denied by Tom W. who was sponsored by Raub in 1978 and remained a friend until Raub's death. O'Reilly states that he arranged to have Uncle Ted open a show by emerging from a coffin supplied as a plug for a local mortuary. After Ted entered and the lid was closed O'Reilly locked it as revenge, resulting in the show opening to a rocking closed coffin and the muffled screams of the claustrophobic host. That was O'Reilly's last day on Ghoul School although he got to host Dracula's Daughter that night after Uncle Ted stormed out of the studio. O'Reilly admits these actions were a \\"tad inappropriate.\\" Mrs. Raub- Bessmer also questions the claustrophobia claims noting that her father performed years of Punch and Judy shows from within very cramped enclosures. Uncle Ted's Ghoul School was cancelled in 1982, but two years later Raub returned to the airwaves with Uncle Ted's Monstermania on local Public TV station WVIA-TV. There the show was taped but performed in one take without edits, flubs and all, to capture a live feel. With its expanded set and the addition of Uncle Ted's first sidekick \\"Nefu Ned\\" (played by co-producer Richard Briggs) Monstermania became a local and cult favorite. According to Briggs, “Ted’s shtick was to act goofy, like he wasn’t very good with his magic. We liked to try to trip him up when he did his tricks. But he was excellent at what he did.” In 1992 Gerry Coleman took over the Nefu Ned role from Richard Briggs on Monstermania, later performing as a new character, Morticai the demented hunchback. The show had an annual Halloween costume contest with bizarre prizes (like bringing the backstage crew's lunch) and the usual wacky skits. In one particular skit Uncle Ted anticipated the film Honey, I Shrunk the Kids by shrinking his crew with an inability to reverse the process. Monstermania's former director Jim Langan summed up Uncle Ted's appeal; \\"When you saw him, you felt like you were meeting with a friend. People like Johnny Carson and Uncle Ted made you feel like you were visiting with them rather than watching them on television. He was just so good at reaching through the screen and touching his audience.\\" In 1994, Raub was recognized by both the Society of American Magicians and Scary Monsters Magazine as one of the nation's \\"longest-running horror hosts.\\" Death A long-time smoker of filter-less Camel cigarettes who suffered ill-health from his addiction, Raub made anti-smoking messages part of his work, especially with children. He also made a few anti-smoking public service commercials. After a struggle with emphysema, Raub died March 10, 1998. He was interred at Memorial Shrine Cemetery in Franklin Township, PA. Uncle Ted was inducted posthumously into the Horror Host Hall of Fame on March 22, 2014.

Le Stanze del Vetro is both a cultural project and an exhibition space, designed by New York-based architect Annabelle Selldorf in collaboration with Fabrizio Cattaruzza and Francesco Millosevich.  Mission  The purpose of Le Stanze del Vetro is to focus on the history and the use of glass in 20th and 21st century Art in order to bring this medium back into the center of the attention and discussion within the international Art scene. Le Stanze del Vetro has adopted a model often found in English-speaking countries of free access to museums based on the idea that cultural heritage belongs to the community. That is why the admission to the exhibitions, the tours and the educational activities are free of charge.  Exhibitions and cultural initiatives  The cultural initiatives of Le Stanze del Vetro focus not only on contemporary artists who have used glass as their artistic medium, but also on the main producers and on the major glass collections in the world. For this reason, two exhibitions are staged each year on the Island of San Giorgio Maggiore. One in the Spring, dedicated to the use of glass in 20th and 21st century Art and Design, the second in the Autumn, dedicated to the talented people who have designed objects for the Venini glassware company in the 20th century.  Site-specific Projects  Alongside these initiatives, a series of special, often site- specific projects are organized involving contemporary artists (Swiss artist Not Vital in 2013, and Japanese artist Hiroshi Sugimoto in 2014), who are invited to work with glass, either prefabricated or specially produced by craftsmen from Venice. The result is a large site-specific installation, coupled with the design of a small limited-edition object produced in Murano and sold at the Le Stanze del Vetro bookshop to support the activities organized and promoted by Le Stanze del Vetro.  Study Centre  In addition to this, Le Stanze del Vetro has set up a Study Centre dedicated to research in the field of artistic glass, together with a general archive of Venetian glass, a series of scholarships specifically addressed to researchers interested in the topic and a series of seminars, conferences and workshops for scholars and artists interested in the history, technology and development of the art of glassmaking.

All the sculptural work is by the Maître de Plougastel except the horseman on the left of the crucifix which is by Millet. It is a listed historical monument since 1889. Calvaire Description Below the top of the pedestal and running around it is a moulded cornice on which are placed a further series of statues carved from the bluish stone from Kersanton. Three crosses rise from the pedestal, the central cross having two crosspieces/bars and the crosses on the left and right bearing the two thieves crucified alongside Jesus. Around these crosses and on the surface of the pedestal are further statues. In total, there are 182 statues carved from Kersanton stone which are placed in groups to form 28 tableaux depicting scenes from the life of Christ. The Breton legend \\"Katell Kollet\\" features in one tableau when she is shown as one of those unfortunate souls writhing in the mouth of hell. The Calvary at Plougastel-Daoulas seen from the eastern side. In the centre of the pedestal's upper surface, Christ is being prepared for burial (the \\"mise au tombeau\\") with Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea, Mary Cléophas and Gamaliel in attendance. A man stands holding a linen shroud. The Virgin Mary, disturbed by what she sees before her, is being supported by John the Apostle and Mary Magdalene holds her pot of oil. On the left of the \\"mise au tombeau\\" we see the Angel of the Annunciation followed by Jesus being baptized. Then to the right of the \\"mise au tombeau\\" we see a soldier and a Jew following Jesus into the presence of a High Priest. On the cornice below we can see from left to right the Angel of the Annunciation knelt at a prie dieu, the Visitation (Christianity), Mary and Joseph's marriage, the Nativity of Jesus, Jesus' circumcision and the flight into Egypt. Note the two arched buttresses with Matthew the Apostle and his angel on the left side buttress and Mark the Evangelist and his lion on the right side buttress. We are seeing the reverse side of the three crosses History of the calvary What was an \\"enclos paroissial\\" was hit by bombing during the 1944 Liberation of France and the Calvary is really all that is left. The parish church of Saint-Pierre, which had been built in 1870 to replace the existing 17th-century church, was left in ruins and ultimately rebuilt in 1950. The Calvary had been built between 1602 and 1604 to mark the end of the bubonic plague epidemic of 1598 and has been classified as a \\"monument historique\\" since 1889. The Calvary stands in the centre of Plougastel- Daoulas, just by the parish church. The name of the Calvary in Breton translates as the \\"Cross of the Plague\\". It was on 23 August 1944 that the area was bombarded by the American forces as they advanced towards Brest. Several of the statues on the Calvary were badly damaged, as were the three crosses. John D. Skilton, an Army Officer and a curator at the Washington Museum in civilian life, was in Plougastel-Daoulas at the time of the bombing, saw the damage done and resolved to restore the Calvary. When back in the USA, he formed the \\"Plougastel Calvary Restoration Fund Inc\\" to raise the funds needed for the Calvary's restoration and, sufficient funds having been raised, the restoration started in 1949 under the direction of the Ministère des Beaux-Arts et des Monuments Historiques who used the services of the sculptor Millet. Further restoration was carried out between 2003 and 2004. The Calvary is 10 metres high. The various scenes depicted are arranged along the lines of the cardinal points. The scenes relating to the birth of Christ and his burial are grouped on the eastern side, whilst on the northern side are scenes dealing with Christ's suffering. On the southern side the scenes deal with Passover, (the \\"Last supper\\"), Jesus' washing of Peter's feet and the \\"chemin de croix\\" (the path to Calvary). On the western side we encounter scenes of Christ's death and resurrection. The depictions of the four apostles on the buttresses In the niches on the face of each of the four buttresses are statues of the four evangelists. They sit in armchairs writing at desks and three wear barettas or the hats worn by doctors. Each is accompanied by their traditional attribute. Matthew the Apostle appears with an angel, Mark the Evangelist with a lion, Luke the Evangelist an ox and John the Evangelist an eagle. The west face of the Calvary The mouth of hell has already taken several lost souls as Jesus leads away two that he has rescued The west face of the Calvary deals with the \\"résurrection\\". The western face is slightly larger and higher than the other three faces. It is dominated by a depiction of the resurrected Christ which is placed above a large arch with pillars on either side in which there is a form of altar. This arch interrupts and divides the cornice and to the left of this part of the Calvary there is a stairway leading up to the pedestal's platform. Priests would use this stairway to access the platform and deliver sermons. Another feature of this face of the Calvary is that there is extra space over each buttress so that individual statues can be placed on them. The west facing cornice is in two sections, divided by the arch. On the left-hand side of the arch, after a statue of a bishop and Saint John and his attribute the eagle on the buttress, we have a scene showing Jesus' entry into Jerusalem. On the right hand side of the arch we have a depiction of the Adoration of the Magi. * The entry into Jerusalem. Jesus rides on an ass and is accompanied by five of his disciples, one of whom holds a book. A small figure emerges from the nearby tower and lays a rug in Jesus' path whilst another, his hands clasped together, stands in the door of the fortress of Jerusalem, here represented by a small crenelated tower. * The adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary sits holding the baby Jesus and Joseph is behind her. The first king is on his knees, has placed his crown on the ground and offers his present in a sort of square chalice. The other two kings stand, their crowns on their heads and hold vases containing their gifts. One's costume is completed by a small cross and type of coif whilst the other has a cord around his shoulders from which a cross is suspended. The cow and the ass are at Joseph's side. The three wise men present their gifts with Mary and Joseph looking on. The two cattle remind us that the birth has taken place in a stable On the surface of the west face of the pedestal and from left to right we first see the devil himself, a frightening figure. He is trying to tempt Jesus who is appearing before Pontius Pilate. Next, we are shown the resurrected Christ who has emerged from the tomb. Here the date 1604 is inscribed. Next, we see the young Jesus engaged in discussions with the two lawyers. Then Jesus is shown holding the hands of two lost souls who he has rescued from the open mouth of hell (\\"Abandon all hope ye who enter here\\") from which flames emerge and other lost souls writhe in agony, including the legendary Kattell Gollet. A demon sits above the mouth orchestrating proceedings and another with horns is with the others in the mouth itself. Jesus is led before Pontius Pilate by a soldier. Pilate is asking questions as shown by the fact that he touches his thumb with his left index finger. On the left is the devil himself and next to the soldier the figure of Jesus without the crown of thorns. The image of the devil and of Jesus are best seen as apparitions looking in on the scene of Jesus before Pontius Pilate * The devil, dressed in a monk's habit and with fearsome teeth, holds out some stones in his left hand and a globe in his right hand. He teases Jesus asking him to turn the stones into bread and telling Jesus, with reference to the globe, that he could be the ruler of the entire world if he chose to be so. Between the devil and the second image of Jesus we see Jesus wearing the crown of thorns, his hands bound and held by a soldier. He is appearing before Pontius Pilate who is seated and wears a turban. He touches his thumb with his left index finger to show that he is speaking. Then we see a second image of Jesus but without the crown of thorns. To understand this scene it is best to see the image of the devil and the image of Christ without the crown of thorns as apparitions and speaking across Pontius and that group. The devil himself * The risen Christ. By the simple device of making Jesus Christ's statue much taller than the surrounding statues, the sculptor underlines Christ's importance. He emerges from the tomb with a \\"pilgrims's staff\\" in his hand whilst he gives a blessing with the other. He is surrounded by four guards, two seated and two standing. All four are asleep. The arch contains an altar and statues of Saint Peter, Saint Sebastian and Saint Roch. Sebastion and Roch were regarded as saints who specialised in warding off disease so their veneration was important. The people feared another epidemic and wanted it avoided. Peter holds his key, Sebastian is depicted with arrows whilst St Roch prays on his knees. On the buttress to the right is Saint Luke and his attribute the ox. View of the Calvary. To the left of the buttress bearing the depiction of Saint Matthew we see depictions of Jesus' journey to Calvary carrying the cross and on the cornice below the Last Supper and the washing of Jesus' feet. On the right of the buttress, we see the \\"Mise au tombeau\\" preceded by John the Baptist baptizing Jesus, with an angel in attendance who is holding Jesus' robe, followed by Jesus being brought before the High Priest. Along the cornice we see the Annunciation with the Virgin Mary sat at a prie-dieu, the visitation, the marriage of Mary and Joseph, the circumcision, the flight to Egypt and the Archangel Gabriel, the Angel of the Annunciation Christ is shown carrying the Cross The south face of the calvary On the south facing surface of the pedestal fourteen statues cover aspects of Jesus' journey carrying the cross to Calvary, the \\"Chemin de Croix\\" (Stations of the Cross). These are, from left to right, St Veronica holding up her veil which now bears Jesus' image, Saint John and the Virgin Mary following Jesus carrying the cross, Christ surrounded by soldiers two of whom are blowing horns, Jesus is helped by Simon of Cyrene, a man beating on a Tabor (instrument) and finally heading the cortège is a man on horseback. Along the cornice beneath these figures, and from left to right, the scenes deal with the Last Supper and Saint Peter washing Christ's feet watched by the other disciples. One soldier rests his leg on the cross pushing it down and adding to the weight which Jesus has to carry * Jesus carrying the cross. Looking closely at the six soldiers, the one near the bottom of the cross where it is dragging on the ground holds a shield and sword. Then the man with his leg straddling the cross and seeming to add to Christ' difficulty in lifting the cross, has a piece of rope in his right hand and in his left hand what appears to be a form of maraca to add to the rhythm of the music being played. The sixth soldier also appears to be pushing the cross down to add to the weight. * The Last Supper. Jesus sits at the table with the apostles. Judas Iscariot sits at one end of the table holding a purse. One of the apostles holds a cup and another a knife. In the case of three of the apostles, the sculptor uses the device to show they are speaking by showing them placing the index finger of their right hand on the thumb of their left hand. * The Washing of Feet. Jesus washes Saint Peter's feet whilst the other apostles look on and await their turn, their demeanor expressing a mixture of admiration and astonishment. Judas has now left the gathering. File:PSIMG 4260.JPGVeronica holds up her veil bearing Jesus' image, Saint John and the Virgin Mary follow Jesus carrying the Cross, assisted by Simon and between them and Jesus three soldiers play instruments. File:Jesus washing Saint Peter's feet.JPGJesus washing Peter's feet The east face of the calvary This face of the Calvary deals with aspects of the birth and the death of Jesus. On the eastern cornice and after the buttress with the niche containing the depiction of Saint Matthew, we start with the Virgin of the Annunciation kneeling in prayer. Normally the Archangel Gabriel would appear in front of her but in this case, the sculptor places five further scenes before Gabriel appears. The Annunciation is thus interspersed with the visitation, Mary's marriage to Joseph, the nativity with Jesus being crowned, the circumcision and the flight into Egypt of Mary, Joseph and Jesus and finally the Archangel Gabriel completing the Annunciation story. He holds a flowered sceptre, the symbol of a celestial mission. He also holds a banner reading \\" Ave gratia plena\\". We then have the buttress with Saint Mark depicted along with his lion. * The Virgin of the Annunciation. Mary kneels at a prie-dieu her right hand resting on a book, her left hand resting on her chest. A vase of lilies is by her side. * The Visitation. The Virgin Mary and her cousin Elizabeth face each other and hold hands in greeting. They discuss the miracles God has worked with them both. * Mary's marriage to Joseph. A priest dressed in surplus, cappa magna and wearing a mitre takes the hands of Mary and Joseph whilst they take their vows. Joseph holds his staff in his left hand and it has miraculously sprouted flowers. * The nativity. The baby Jesus lies between Mary and Joseph who are both kneeling. A small angel joins the two admiring parents whilst the cow and ass seem to be warming Jesus with their breath. * The flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary sits side-saddle on a donkey, her feet resting on a suspended board which has created a large stirrup. Jesus is on her knee wrapped in swaddling clothes. Joseph wears a hat and carries a baton. * The Archangel Gabriel. When he finally appears he holds out a lily in his left hand and is raising the other hand. Above this cornice and on the surface of the eastern face of the pedestal we start with a depiction of an angel and then Jesus being baptized. Then we see the \\"Mise au tombeau\\"; Jesus being prepared for burial, with Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea, Mary Cleophas and Gamaliel in attendance. A man stands holding a linen shroud. Mary is being supported by John and Mary Magdalene holds her pot of oil. Finally, we see Jesus being taken before Annas the father in law of Caiaphas. Annas does not want to get involved and sends the accused to appear before Caiaphas. * The baptism. John the Baptist is dressed in an animal skin and pours water from the Jordan on Jesus' head and next to Jesus an angel stands holding the Holy Robe/Seamless robe of Jesus. * The \\"Mise au tombeau\\". The body of Jesus is prepared before being placed in a sepulchre here carved to replicate the type of sepulchre that would have been used in antiquity. Mary accompanied by John the Evangelist, Mary Magdalene and another female figure are in deep despair and cannot take their eyes of the body. Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea stand at Jesus' head and feet and there is a third person present, probably Abibon or Gamaliel. * The appearance before Caiaphas. Jesus is guarded by two soldiers. Caiaphas' servant has one hand on Jesus' shoulder and raises the other hand as if to hit him. A third soldier wears a turban and seems to be in charge of the other two. According to the Gospel of John (the event is not mentioned in other accounts) Jesus was first brought before Annas and after a brief questioning of him (John 18:19-23) was sent to the home of Caiaphas where some members of the Sanhedrin were gathered and the first trial of Jesus took place (Matt. 26:57-68). The north face of the Calvary A soldier taps Jesus on the chest with a reed, the reed he will eventually hold in his right hand Here we deal with the north facing cornice and the statues ranged above it as well as the scene depicted above the north west buttress. This section of the Calvary deals with Christ's suffering-\\"La souffrance\\" On the north facing cornice and from left to right are depictions of Jesus praying in Gethsemane with Saint John next to him, Saint Peter and James, son of Zebedee, a guard restraining Saint Peter who holds the sword with which he has just cut off the ear of Malchus, Jesus and Judas with Malchus on the ground before them. Next, come statues depicting the three soldiers who helped with the arrest of Jesus and a fourth who holds a rope this followed by Jesus' being brought before Caiaphas. Above the frieze we firstly see some soldiers carrying whips, then Jesus tied to a column with two more soldiers in attendance. The scene is set for his flagellation. Next the crown of thorns is pressed on to Christ's head whilst at his feet, a soldier taps him with a reed. Jesus is now presented to Pontius Pilate and a Jew who stands to Jesus' right and makes his accusations. * In the garden of Gethsemane, Jesus is depicted on his knees in prayer. Saint John is at his side and in a deep sleep, his head cupped in his left hand. Saint Peter and Saint James are also fast asleep. * Jesus' arrest. Eight statues tell the story of Jesus' arrest. First, we have a helmeted guard in armour who holds a rope in his hand and to his left is Saint Peter brandishing the sword with which he has cut off Malchus' ear. Then we see Jesus and Judas and at their feet Malchus who has fallen backward to the ground after being struck by Saint Peter and has dropped the lantern he was carrying. He tries to steady himself by holding on Jesus' arm. Judas stands close to Jesus holding the purse no doubt containing the reward for his treachery. He has either kissed Jesus or is about to do so. Then we have three other guards who will make the arrest. The one in the middle holds a sword. Jesus is then led before Caiaphas who is seated and holds a sceptre and wears a crown, symbols of his power. * The Flagellation scene. In the flagellation scene, we start with two soldiers standing holding whips then see two soldiers who have tied Jesus to a column. * The crown of thorns. Three soldiers put much effort into pushing the crown down on Jesus' head using a long bar which is lain across the crown and then pushed down. A fourth soldier kneels by Jesus' side and taps his chest with a reed. * The appearance before Pontius Pilate. Jesus' hands are tied and he still wears the crown of thorns and in his right hand holds the reed. Pilate wears a turban and his hands are spread open as he addresses those who have brought Jesus before him. One soldier opens Jesus' cloak. On his right, another soldier prepares the towel he will give Pilate to wash his hands. The last of the soldiers carries a jug of water. On the space over the north east buttress, we see Jesus being mocked and ridiculed by five guards (\\"Christ aux outrages\\"). He sits on a stool. His hands are bound and he is blindfolded. A soldier standing on the left holds a whip ready to start the flogging. Three soldiers stand behind Jesus and two have their hands raised ready as though to strike him. Another soldier kneels at Jesus' side taunting him and asking who has hit him. Jesus sits on a stool awaiting his flogging. He is bound and blindfolded. The soldiers mock him and one kneels in front of Jesus and makes fun of him. Two have raised hands with which they will hit Jesus who is blindfolded so is teased by the soldier on his kness who asks \\"who hit you?\\" The three crosses The Pieta. The Virgin Mary holds the body of her dead son whilst Mary Magdalene stands with her pot of ointment The shaft of the central cross is covered in small lumps as was the case with all votive crosses erected to celebrate the end of an outbreak of the plague. These are thought by some architectural historians to mimick the boil like sores which were one of the symptoms of the bubonic plague. Dismas, the good thief, hangs from a cross to the right of Jesus and an angel stands near his right shoulder ready to carry off his soul. The bad thief hangs on the cross to Jesus' left and in his case it is the devil who will carry off his soul. Both the angel and the devil clutch small doll like sculptures no doubt depictions of the souls they will eventually carry off.

On the upper crosspiece are two men on horseback, Saint Longinus and Stephaton, the two soldiers who were at the crucifixion. It was Longinus who pierced Jesus' side so he carries a lance whilst Stephaton carries a sponge as he was the soldier who gave Jesus a sponge soaked in vinegar. On the reverse side of the two horsemen is a depiction of Jesus tied with ropes (\\"Christ lié\\"). Jesus hangs from the central cross and is sculpted back to back with an Ecce Homo. The crucified Jesus is surrounded by four small angels who are collecting the blood running from his wounds. Note that Jesus was nailed to the cross but the two thieves were tied to their crosses with rope. * The \\"Ecco Homo\\". Jesus, carrying the crown of thorns and the reed, is presented to the crowd.

A second portrait, by Pontormo, has also been argued to show Bia de' Medici, but this identification is disputed. Description After her death, many art historians believe her father commissioned a posthumous painting of her by Agnolo Bronzino, which art historians regard as one of his finest works. The work is 64 cm by 48 cm and was painted in tempera on wood. In the famous painting, which is on display in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence, Bia wears a medallion with her father's profile on it, emphasizing her bond with her father. Bronzino shows the child half-length and sitting on a chair, similar to the pose in his Portrait of Lucrezia Panciatichi – a rigid official pose offset by some hints of hand movement, as if the character was about to get up, along with an intense but emotionless gaze straight at the viewer. The face is lit and highlighted by the blue background, whilst the cold light and absence of any strong chiaroscuro effect accentuates the smoothness of the subject's complexion and idealises her features. Her complexion is a pale white because Bronzino painted the portrait using her death mask as a model.Murphy (2008), p. 32. Bia has her hair parted in the middle of her forehead and a falling bob, with two carefully tied braids framing the face. She wears pearl earrings, a gold chain with a pendant or medallion with her father's profile on it, emphasizing her bond with her father.Murphy (2008), p. 17. She also wears a sumptuous dress, made of blue satin with puffy sleeves, produced in the silk factories Cosimo was setting up in Florence at the time. With her right hand she is fiddling with the end or tassel of a golden chain or belt around her waist. It was not an official state portrait, but would have hung in the family's private rooms as a reminder to them of the dead child and an inspiration and guide on the path to salvation.Langdon (2006), p. 103. As art historian Gabrielle Langdon argues, Bronzino painted the child with a halo effect, in \\"light-emitting white satin and pearls\\" as a metaphor for both her name \\"Bianca,\\" which means \\"white\\" and her childish innocence. \\"Like (Petrarch's) 'Laura,' the posthumous Bia is a riveting emanation from Heaven who bestows purifying grace on the beholder,\\" Langdon wrote in the 2004 collection The Cultural World of Eleanora Di Toledo.Eisenbichler (2004), p. 49. Identification A 1954 Saarland stamp of the Bia de' Medici portrait, commemorating the work of Agnolo Bronzino. Maike Vogt-Lüerssen argues that the famous painting actually depicts Bia's younger, legitimate half sister, Maria de' Medici. Vogt-Lüerssen noted in an article in Medicea – Rivista interdisciplinare di studi medicei that the subject of the portrait was identified as Maria until the 1950s and the pearls depicted in the portrait were a common symbol of the Medicis, often worn by legitimate female members of the house. Vogt-Lüerssen believes that the child depicted in a famous portrait by Pontormo with Maria Salviati is actually Bia, her eldest granddaughter, because group portraits in that era depicted family members with close blood relationships and Salviati's two younger granddaughters, Maria and Isabella, were too young at Salviati's death to be the 5- or 6-year- old girl in the portrait.http://www.kleio.org/de/buecher/true_faces_medici.html Influence Regardless of which Medici daughter it depicts, the painting has continued to inspire modern artists. American sculptor Joseph Cornell's 1948 sculpture Medici Princess incorporates Bronzino's portrait of the girl. The sculpture, one of a series depicting members of the Medici family, shows an enameled reproduction of Bronzino's portrait in a dark wooden box, behind a blurred, deep blue glass pane. On either side of the main portrait are smaller vignette reproductions of the same portrait, behind glass as well. Below the girl's image, in a pull-out drawer, are a feather and a floor plan of the palace in Florence that was once her home. The sculpture, which is owned by a private collector, was on display during a recent retrospective of Cornell's work originating with the Smithsonian American Art Museum.Artchive.com Bia de' Medici Bianca de' Medici, usually known as Bia de' Medici, ( – 1 March 1542) was the illegitimate daughter of Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, born before his first marriage. The identity of Bia's mother is not known, but Cosimo I was likely no older than sixteen when he fathered her. According to Edgcumbe Staley's The Tragedies of the Medici, some stories said the girl's mother was a village girl from Trebbio, where the Medicis had built one of their first villas, while others said she was a gentlewoman from Florence. Only Cosimo I and the girl's paternal grandmother, Maria Salviati, knew the identity of the girl's mother, but Salviati refused to reveal it, though she did acknowledge Bia was the daughter of Cosimo. Staley wrote that the little girl was called La Bia, short for Bambina (little girl or baby). The name might also have been short for Bianca. Staley wrote that her father's new wife, Eleonora di Toledo, refused to tolerate her presence in the palace after their marriage, so Cosimo sent her off to the Villa di Castello, her paternal grandmother's chief residence north of Florence.Staley, Edgcumbe. The Tragedies of the Medici. However, other more reliable reports indicate that her stepmother \\"brought her up very lovingly.\\"Murphy (2008), p. 17. Her paternal grandmother supervised the nurseries for all of the children of Cosimo I. All of them, not only Cosimo's illegitimate daughter, spent most of their time at the Villa di Castello and were raised by nurses, with minimal day-to-day contact with their parents, though both Cosimo and Eleonora heard reports of their progress and offered directions for their education, their living arrangements, and the clothing they wore. Bia shared her nursery with Giulia de' Medici, the illegitimate daughter of Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of Florence, who was close to her in age. She grew into a high-spirited, loving little girl who kept her grandmother and nurses entertained with her antics.Langdon (2006), p. 99. Bia's father adored his first-born child, and her paternal grandmother, Maria Salviati, said the little girl \\"was the comfort of our court, being so very affectionate.\\" Both Bia and her cousin Giulia contracted a fast-moving fever in February 1542, from which Giulia recovered but Bia did not. Cosimo I received almost daily reports of Bia's worsening condition from his mother, Maria Salviati. The child grew weaker between 25 February and 28 February and finally died on 1 March 1542. She was buried in the Medici family crypt in San Lorenzo.Langdon (2006), p. 100. When her legitimate half-sister Isabella de' Medici was born six months after her death, her father rejoiced to have another daughter. Contemporaries who might normally have consoled him on his wife's failure to present him with a second son instead congratulated him on her birth, knowing how he had grieved for the loss of Bia. \\"(I) congratulate you on the beautiful baby girl God has conceded to you in recompense for the one he has taken to join him in paradise,\\" wrote Paolo Giovio after the birth of Isabella.Murphy (2008), p. 18. A comparison of portraits of Bia and Isabella reveal that, had she lived past early childhood, Bia likely would have closely resembled her half-sister Isabella, who shared her reddish-blonde hair, brown eyes, and dainty features.Murphy (2008), p. 32. Pontormo painting Maria Salviati with Giulia de' Medici or Bia de' MediciVogt-Lüerssen, Maike: The True Faces of the Daughters and Sons of Cosimo I de' Medici in a portrait by Pontormo, c. 1537 or 1542; Oil on panel, Baltimore, The Walters Art Museum. In a portrait by Pontormo, the child's identification, according to the Walters Art Museum and scholarship sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities is likely to be Giulia de' Medici.http://art.thewalters.org/detail/26104/portrait-of-maria-salviati-de- medici-with-giulia-de-medici/http://www.artnews.com/2012/10/25/image-of- africans-in-western- art/http://www.neh.gov/humanities/2013/januaryfebruary/feature/faces-the- renaissance However, Maike Vogt-Lüerssen argues in an article in Medicea – Rivista interdisciplinare di studi medicei that the child in the portrait with Maria Salviati is actually Salviati's granddaughter Bia de' Medici. She believes that the child does not resemble the known portrait of an adult Giulia de' Medici and that the relationship between Maria Salviati and Giulia was not close enough to have warranted a portrait. Most group portraits were of family members with close blood ties.http://www.kleio.org/de/buecher/true_faces_medici.html Some art historians once identified the child as a young Cosimo I de' Medici, but it is now generally accepted to be Giulia. The child in the portrait appears to be a little girl, rather than a boy, and her expression is anxious. Maria Salviati, who is dressed soberly as befitted a widow, is seen sheltering the vulnerable child against her side. Art historian Gabrielle Langdon argues that the girl's demeanor in the portrait is different than would have been expected for the child Cosimo, whose family anticipated his role as a strong leader from his earliest days. It would have been to Cosimo I's advantage to commission a portrait depicting his mother as an exemplary widow, affectionately bringing up the orphaned daughter of Cosimo I's predecessor. The child's full lips, round nose, and curly reddish hair also bear little resemblance to known portraits of Cosimo as a child, though they do to portraits of the young Alessandro. Other girls of about the right age who were at court during this period also do not resemble the child in the portrait. The portrait might be one of the first in Renaissance-era Europe of a girl of presumed African and European ancestry.Langdon (2006), p. 40 This painting is in the permanent collection of The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. The portrait has also been identified with other women, such as Isabella or Maria.

FACE was started by Sherry Warner Seefeld and two other mothers who say their sons were falsely accused of sexual misconduct on their college campuses. History Cynthia P. Garrett, an attorney, and Alison Scott are currently co-presidents of FACE, which has expanded rapidly over the last few years as awareness of campus Title IX issues has become more well publicized. Issues Specifically, FACE objects to many schools' Title IX proceedings that deny students basic procedures traditionally provided to those defending themselves against allegations of wrongdoing, such as: not being informed of the specific accusations, denied access to the complaint, witness statements, and evidence, and not being permitted to contact and present witnesses. FACE and others who support more protections for accused students say these procedures were denied students due to the Department of Education's \\"civil- rights office and its aggressive enforcement of Title IX and victims’ rights during the Obama years.\\" \\"Critics say the guidance went too far and effectively directed colleges to tilt their processes in favor of victims, trampling on the rights of accused students.\\" Seefeld, FACE's first president, acknowledges the problem of sexual assault on college campuses, but says \\"Even if a small percentage of rape reports are given falsely, it's not OK to throw away one person's life\\". Seefeld's son, Caleb Warner, was accused in January 2010 of sexually assaulting a fellow University of North Dakota student. He was initially suspended from the university, but the sanction was later lifted after a warrant was issued for his accuser for her arrest for making a false report to law enforcement. According to FACE board member and attorney Eric Rosenberg, who has represented numerous accused students, \\"'There has been a massive fear on campuses of OCR' ... Now, he said, 'the voice of the falsely accused is beginning to be heard in ways that were not previously available to them.'\\" Advocacy FACE has become involved in educating state and federal legislators about the need for improvement in the way campuses respond to allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct. \\"In a very short time, FACE has come a very long way as an advocacy organization for students accused of sexual misconduct on campus. Beginning as a 'mommy org,' it’s gained substantial sophistication in dealing with Title IX.\\" On July 13, 2017, co- presidents Alison Scott and Cynthia Garrett shepherded several students to a meeting in Washington DC with Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Later, during Secretary DeVos' September 7, 2017 speech at George Mason University, she mentioned the cases of two FACE students with whom she had met, one of whom had \\"honorably served in the Navy.\\" \\" In that speech DeVos reported, “Since becoming Secretary, I’ve heard from many students whose lives were impacted by sexual misconduct: students who came to campus to gain knowledge, and who instead lost something sacred.\\" The Secretary declared, \\"We know this much to be true: one rape is one too many. One assault is one too many. One aggressive act of harassment is one too many. One person denied due process is one too many.\\" Positions FACE maintains that the goals of victim protection and equitable processes are not mutually exclusive: \\"Our goals are not to get rid of Title IX, ... Our goals are not to deny anybody civil rights ... [Nor does FACE] want the civil-rights office to stop enforcing Title IX with respect to campus sexual violence.\\" According to Garrett, \\"We're looking for a balanced solution and we don't believe the current enforcement, or 'Dear Colleague' letter offers a balanced solution.\\" In another interview, Garrett said, \\"We want fair procedures. We don't want to take away Title IX.\\" As an example, Garrett served on an American Bar Association Criminal Justice Section task force which addressed the problem and, along with victims' advocates and campus administrators, was able to reach a consensus on procedures that would protect the interests of all parties. In June 2017, the task force issued its \\"recommendations to guide colleges and universities\\". Garrett said FACE is \\"not looking for a one-sided, make-it-impossible for complainants to have their rights vindicated\\" approach. In 2015, FACE criticized Senator Kirsten Gillibrand for inviting Emma Sulkowicz to the State of the Union Address, saying such an honor was \\"undeserved and violates the principles of confidentiality and gender equality of Title IX, the law that oversees sexual misconduct on campus\\" and saying that \\"Sulkowicz failed to establish any wrongdoing by the student she accused after a tribunal, and an appeal at Columbia, as well as an investigation by the New York Police Department.\\" In July 2017 Columbia settled with Nungesser on undisclosed terms.

History The rock was brought to football coach Frank Howard in the early 1960s as a gift from Samuel C. Jones. Jones found the rock while driving through Death Valley, California and gave it to Howard as a reference to \\"Death Valley,\\" the name used to refer to Memorial Stadium.Dinich, Heather \\"Howard's Rock Damaged by Vandals\\" ESPN College Football The coach used the rock as a doorstop until 1966. He was cleaning out his office when he told Gene Willimon, a Clemson booster, \\"Take this rock and throw it over the fence or out in the ditch...Do something with it, but get it out of my office.\\" It was Willimon who had the rock placed on a pedestal in the east end zone, where it remains today.Sam Blackman; Bob Bradley; Chuck Kriese (15 August 2017). Clemson: Where the Tigers Play. Sports Publishing. pp. 898–. . The rock made its first appearance on September 24, 1966: Clemson was losing to Virginia by 18 points with seventeen minutes left in the game. The Tigers made up the deficit and won the game 40-35. The next season was when the tradition of rubbing the rock upon entering the stadium began. Howard reportedly said to his players, \\"If you're going to give me 110 percent, you can rub that rock. If you're not, keep your filthy hands off of it.\\"Schlabach, Mark \\"Gift from Death Valley became \\"Death Valley\\" tradition\\" ESPN College Football The Tigers have continued this tradition since 1967, except for two- and-a-half seasons between 1970 and 1972. This was due to new head coach Hootie Ingram's changing the team's entrance to the west end zone after Frank Howard's retirement. During those seasons, Clemson held a bad record at home of 6-9. Before the South Carolina rivalry game in 1972, the team voted to enter via the east end zone and run down the hill. They later won the game 7-6. Vandalism On June 2, 2013 Howard's Rock was vandalized. The case the Rock was held in was broken into and a large portion of the rock was broken off.

The damage to the rock was re-evaluated to more than 10,000 dollars. http://www.foxcarolina.com/story/27904220/court-howards-rock-vandal-faces- more-charges Clemson University police later stated that the surveillance video from the outside of Memorial Stadium shows that three people got out of the truck used in the act.

A jury found Rogers guilty of malicious damage, but they found him not guilty of grand larceny. The judge gave Rogers the maximum sentence of 30 days in jail or a $1,000 fine for the malicious damage charge; however, the sentence was suspended, meaning Rogers does not have to serve the jail time, so long as he pays a $750 fine and completes 25 days of supervised community service.http://www.wyff4.com/news/suspect-in- howards-rock-vandalism-headed-to-court/34243000 Two other men later pleaded guilty to attempting to cover up the vandalism of Howard's Rock that took place in June 2013. Michael J. Rogers, 49, and Alden J.

Tackett’s musical reputation extends well beyond the underground clubs of Los Angeles. He has performed and collaborated with a wide range of artists, including Blind Melon, B.B. King, Damien Marley, Little Feat, Macy Gray and legendary soul singer Syl Johnson. After years of focusing on a purist funk style and sound with Breakestra, Tackett has taken some time to write new songs using his first love, the electric guitar. Miles has released his most personal album yet, the soulful, guitar-centric The Fool Who Wonders. With an array of influences that draw from vintage soul, rhythm and blues, psychedelic, and blues/jazz influenced folk and rock, this album’s new vintage sound brings Tackett’s varied musical travels back to his roots. Biography Miles Tackett was raised on the sounds of 60s/70s gumbo rock while growing up in the Santa Monica Mountains of Topanga Canyon. His father is Fred Tackett, the multi-instrumental member of 70s American rock band Little Feat. While in his teens, Miles co-formed the soulful-funky-melodic rock band The Inclined and in 1993 they released Bright New Day (Columbia). In 1999, Breakestra released the Miles Tackett produced & composed his first deep funk track Getcho Soul Togetha on Stones Throw Records which featured him on drums, bass & guitar along with Mixmaster Wolf on vocals. A full length Breakestra record “the Live Mix tape part 2” on Stones Throw soon followed displaying the seamless, live medley style “band as the funk/hip hop Dj” concept featuring covers of deep & classic funk/soul/jazz that had been sampled in golden era hip hop records which is where he & other orange original members in Breakestra like keyboardist Carlos Guaico & vocalist Mixmaster Wolf had first the tracks. A few years later after securing a deal with Ubiquity Records Miles composed, produced, and played on Breakestra's Hit the Floor which included all-original songs. Tackett and Breakestra appear on the soundtrack for the 2005 Tony Hawk's American Wasteland video game. In late 2009, Breakestra led by Miles Tackett put together the full-length CD, Dusk Till Dawn, another all original funky-soul- jazz collection that featured guest rapper Chali 2na, the late DJ Dusk and soul vocalist Afrodyete the \\"African Goddess of Love\\". In addition to the live performing & recording in 1999 Miles had started collecting hip hop & funk vinyl which led him to start djing at his Root Down party underground Hip hop party. Soon after in 2000 he felt there was a need for a dj dance party night that focused on the deep funky soul music he loved so Along with Dj Egon & Cut Chemist he started the long running Funky Sole vintage vinyl dance party that even now in 2018 happens every Saturday at the Echo in Echo Park where Miles is promoter & Resident Dj along with guests.

Retrieved August 13, 2018 and National Monument near Naas, County Kildare, Ireland. It was constructed in the late 1630s when Ireland was under the reign of Charles I (1625–1649). At the time it was one of the largest buildings in Ireland, and the first to be constructed of red brick: the plans provided for a pavement and columns of Kilkenny marble. Jigginstown Castle was built on the periphery of an area known as The Pale, which was on the outskirts of Dublin. It was an area which was guarded on its outskirts by the English plantation settlers to protect valuables and livestock. The castle has also been previously known as Siggingstown Castle. Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the 1630s, in his time the most powerful figure in Ireland, was responsible for the construction. His intention was for the castle to be a place where the King could reside on royal visits to Ireland. The downfall and execution for treason of Lord Strafford in 1641 meant that the house was never completed, and it was largely destroyed during the civil strife of the 1640s. According to Strafford's biographer Veronica Wedgwood, the ruins were still visible in the 1950s. The basement and castle's ground floor still stand to this day.Wedgwood, C. V.

Jayaram (1981) reports that at least six other species occur in the north-eastern part of India (Assam to Burma). Tilak & Hussain (1981) have written a review on the systematics of the Indian members of the genus. Lepidocephalichthys jonklaasi is distinguished from L. furcatus, L. micropogon, L. manipurensis, and L. goalparensis by rounded/truncated (vs. forked) caudal fin, from L. irrorata and L. kranos by absence of scales on top of head, from L. guntea, L. hasselti, L. tomaculum, L. alkaia, and L. annandalei by broad regularly spaced dark bars (vs. reticulations, spots, or stripe) on caudal fin, from L. thermalis, L. arunachalensis, L. coromandelensis, and L. berdmorei by vertically elongated, dark spots on side that form irregular, thin bars (vs. round spots that sometimes form squares or thin stripe), and from L. lorentzi by thinner, more irregularly spaced dark side bars, dorsal-fin origin anterior (vs. posterior) to pelvic-fin origin, and larger size (to 45 vs. 33 mm SL), (Havird & Page 2010). The two Sri Lankan species L. jonklaasi and L. thermalis are not very closely related. They are easily differentiated by body shape and proportions, colour pattern, and form of sexual dimorphism that is unique to L. jonklaasi. Further, a mature adult L. jonklaasi is significantly longer than L. thermalis. It is not easily confused with L. thermalis owing to its distinctive colour pattern and robust, tubular body.

The engineer Friedrich Eugen Maier from Berlin drafted and built in the 1930s at least one car prototype and succeeded in bringing this vehicle on the road.  Technical description of a found prototype  The found compact car had a 20 HP DKW- engine. It was later replaced by the engine of a VW Käfer. The engineer installed some details that were revolutionary at that time: a driver’s seat that can be adjusted in height (patented in July 1938), headlights that follow the steering, a chassis that was adjustable in height and a self-supporting closed car body (patented in July 1932.First patent of Maier at the German DPMA). In total, Maier applied for 12 car related patentsAll patents of Maier at the German DPMA. Start search again with Friedrich Eugen Maier in Germany and others in the United States and Great Britain. The following can be found on the type board: \\"Fabrikat Leichtbau Maier.

Vehicle number LM 050 1/35; Engine number 386418; 20 HP; Hole 76; Stroke 76; weight 684 kg; total weight 1034 kg)  History  The published vehicle went through some collectors and a paint shop 2007 in the possession of Jörg Jansen. He began to restore the car and found the mentioned type board. Since his profession as expert for cars, he began to search what the name Leichtbau Maier meant. Thanks to the support of the Ptotoype-Museum in Hamburg, Hanspeter Bröhl and Herman van Oldeneel (who found out what the precise name was of the spot where Maier lived and worked), the history became a little bit more clear. Friedrich Eugen Maier ran in the beginning of the 1930s until 1944 a repair shop on the Sömmeringstraße 31/32 in Berlin-Charlottenburg on the ground that belonged to the Magistrat von Berlin. On this terrain, there was a printing office (Bernand & Graefe) until 1933. In the neighbourhood, a repair shop, a paint shop and the Kraftfahrzeugwerkstätte Sömmeringstraße GmbH. It is possible that they influenced Maier’s choice where he opened his company. There is no official address registered for an engineer Friedrich Maier, neither for a Eugen Maier in the address books of Berlin in 1930 - 1935. Nevertheless, he applied in 1935 for a patent concerning a driver's seat that can be adjusted completely in height, length and angleDriver's seat patent of Maier at the German DPMA and for another patent about a wheels suspensionWheel suspension patent of Maier at the German DPMA that was the first of its kind. Based on a facsimile regarding a patent of Maier, it can be concluded that he lived in Berlin- Karlshorst. In 1936, an official entry can be found: „Maier, Friedrich, E.“, Leichtbau, Sömmeringstraße 30 (followed by his phone number). A search after the street and number doesn’t result in anything. It seems that the site was split, got new numbers and were then used by Maier. In the same year, Maier had to repair German Wehrmachts-vehicle. Also, he applied for his second patent about the car body for automobileSecond patent of Maier at the German DPMA In 1937, Maier had an entry on the Sömmeringstraße 30 (\\"Maier, Fr., Dipl. Ing.\\") without his company. According to the official address books, Maier was present on the Sömmeringstraße 30 until 1943, but the brand \\"Leichtbau Maier\\" can’t be found anymore. Maier bought the site 1943 and changed it into a sports field. Except the mentioned prototype, there are now other known cars that were produced here.

He was a member of the Communist Party. Early life Jiang Feng was born in Shanghai. His original name was Zhou Xi(周熙). Jiang grew up in a working class family. As a teenager, he became involved in left-wing politics, mainly because he worked as a bookkeeper for a railroad company and participated in labor strike activities. At the age of nineteen, Jiang began taking classes at the White Swan Western Painting Club in Shanghai. Left-Wing Activity In 1931, Jiang joined a group of protesting students and launched the Shanghai Eighteen Art Society Research Center. The group got its name from the year it began forming, 1929- the 18th year of the republic. The group published and spread anti-imperialist propaganda among Chinese workers. He participated in founding Lu Xun's Creative Print Movement. Lu supplied the Eighteen Art Society with funds, woodcuts, and books. He put Jiang and the members of the \\"Eighteen Art Society in charge of selecting students for the workshop on woodcut technique in 1931 that Lu Xun organized in Shanghai.\\" In 1932, Jiang officially became a part of the Communist Party. Soon after he was elected executive of the League of Left-Wing Artists. On numerous occasions, Jiang Feng was arrested. Shortly after Jiang joined the Communist Party, he was arrested along with eleven other members of the Eighteen Art Society by the Nationalist Government. He spent two years in prison. During this time he led hunger strikes and organized a school. In 1933, two months after his release, Jiang was rearrested, and spent another two years in jail. In the wake of Mao Zedong's Rectification Campaign in 1942 Jiang was arrested again for unknown reasons. After his second release from prison, he returned to Shanghai in 1935. There, he continued his political activity. Jiang worked for a publication titled Iron Horse Press. He produced several woodcuts inspired by Soviet Constructivism for them. When the Japanese attacked Shanghai in 1937, Jiang fled to the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in Yan'an. Career In 1939, Jiang Feng was an instructor at Lu Xun Academy of Literature and Art in Yan'an. He was made director of the art department the following year. In this particular position, he was in charge of the art factory responsible for producing nianhua prints for Red Army propaganda. \\"Between 1945 and 1949, Jiang dedicated his work to the war of liberation against the nationalists.\\" Jiang Feng held many different positions at various institutes. In 1946 he was the Head of the Art Department at Huabei United Revolutionary University. In 1949 he was the Vice-Chairman of Chinese Artists' Association under Maoist regime. He also held the titles of Deputy Director, then Director of Chinese Artists' Association. From 1949 through 1957 Feng was the leading figure in Mao's project of cultural reform in the art world. Jiang was the Vice President of Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts in Hangzhou. He was also the President of the prestigious Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. In July 1949, Jiang was elected to the National Committee of All-China Literary and Arts Circles. He was made an Honorary Chairman of Chinese Print Media Artists Association. In 1979, after the Cultural Revolution ended, Jiang was honored with Presidency of the Chinese Artists' Association. =Teachings= While working at these academies, Jiang taught using two concepts of art: Yan'an conception of art education and the Russian system of art education. The Yan'an conception of art education required students to learn Marxist and Mao Zedong thought. Students also had to devote a significant amount of time to working with peasants, workers, and soldiers. The Russian system of art education emphasized drawing from life and from plaster casts of sculpture, and acquiring the skills needed to paint with oils and watercolors. Because Jiang was dedicated to the medium of printmaking, this was eventually granted independent department status within schools. Artwork Much of Jiang Feng's artwork incorporated styles from other countries. In 1931 he produced a woodcut titled, \\"Kill the Resisters.\\" It is in the stark style of German Expressionism. The painting depicts a group of flag-warning demonstrators fleeing from the gunfire of armed Nationalist troops. In 1942 Jiang created, \\"Studying is Good,\\" which was a mix of nianhua prints and positive Communist content. It conveyed two children holding up a writing brush and abacus, while squash and grain are growing at their feet. The slogan above their heads reads, \\"Studying is good. After you study you can do accounts and write letters.\\" Jiang also published papers on art: \\"Art of Italian Renaissance,\\" \\"Appreciation of Western Famous Paintings,\\" and \\"Art of DaVinci.\\" References Further reading *Andrews, Julia F.

Semi-rural Foxdenton lies to the south. The name Nordens derives from North Dene or Valley, and is commemorated in the name North Dene Park, a street name in the district.http://www.chadderton-hs.freeuk.com/currentnewsletter.htm Nordens Lane (later Nordens Road), a short stretch of which still exists as Nordens Street, was one of Chadderton's oldest roads and was one of the main routes leading to the nearby Chadderton Hall manor house. Suburban housing now lies on the land the lane went through. Between the mid 1960s and 1992 Nordens Road was the home ground of the now defunct Oldham Town Football Club (previously known as Oldham Dew) who played in the North West Counties League. The ground is now open space, the club having relocated to the Whitebank Stadium in Oldham. The Radclyffe School lies in the vicinity of this district. The Hunt Lane Tavern is a public house in the area, dating back to 1854.P.30 Chadderton Pubs And Their Licencees 1750 - 1999, Magee Rob (1986) The pub has its origins in a farmhouse which was situated in Hunt Clough. This was a valley through which ran the stream known as Spring Brook. The pub, first licensed in 1840, was in the area of Hunt Clough now built over by the Swallow Fields housing development off Middleton Road. Adjacent to the pub lies the former Nordens Branch of the Co-operative Wholesale Society dating from the early 20th century although the building is now used for other retail purposes.http://www.chadderton-hs.freeuk.com/currentnewsletter.htm The extensive Chadderton Cemetery, which opened in 1857, lies in close vicinity at Spring Brook. The Spring Brook Works, a major finishing factory, also lay at Spring Brook just off Nordens Road. It was built in 1875, being demolished in 1985. Suburban housing now covers this area.http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/Chadderton/MiddletonRdCemetery.shtmlhttp://www.chadderton- hs.freeuk.com/page3-chadd-mills.htm In 1914 a branch of the now defunct Middleton Junction and Oldham Branch Railway to Chadderton Coal and Mineral Yard opened necessitating the realignment of Hunt Lane so as to enter Middleton Road further west. Thus it no longer faced the Hunt Lane Tavern pub. This confuses people to this day with the Hunt Lane Chippy and the Hunt Lane Tavern no longer being adjacent to the lane of that name.

Her artistic style is surrealism with commentary on modern and traditional Emirati culture. Her paintings often feature the skeletons of humans and animals. Early life and education Al Saleh was born in 1988 in Dubai where her family lived in a home they built off of Sheikh Zayed Road. At the age of 8, she began painting with oil paints on canvas with the help of her aunt, who was also an artist. She received a degree in interior design from Zayed University in January 2010. She began painting images of bones and skeletons around the age of 16 after she had an X-ray taken on her back during a medical check-up. Al Saleh uses various mediums which include acrylic on canvas, mixed media for installations, and fiberglass and mixed media for her sculptures. Career Al Saleh began her career as an artist in 2008. In 2009, she contributed her work to Emirati Expressions: Art from the Heart of the Emirates at Emirates Palace's Gallery One. Her first solo exhibition was held in summer 2010 in the Maraya Art Centre in Sharjah. Her second solo art exhibition was titled The Bright Side of the Bones and was held at the Dubai Community Theatre and Arts Centre's Gallery of Light in 2011. That same year Time Out Dubai included Al Saleh in a list of \\"Top 10 artists in Dubai.\\" Outside of the UAE, Al Saleh's work has been displayed in the Macedonian Museum of Contemporary Art, the Palazzo del Te, the Centro Cultural Caja Granada in Spain and several shows in the United States. In 2016, Al Saleh's art, with symbols of skulls and bones, was included in a group exhibition of Emirati artists in Kreuzberg, Berlin, entitled Art Nomads - Made in the Emirates. =Selected works= One of Al Saleh's first sales was a diptych titled The Couple that sold to the Barjeel Art Foundation in Sharjah. The Couple depicts a male and a female skeleton dressed in traditional wedding attire and were based on a real couple who died. Her painting On a Diet features a female skeleton sitting down for a meal. It is a commentary on dieting, eating disorders and how the desire to lose weight effects young women in the UAE. Mummy and I depicts a mother, covered in black abaya and scarf while clutching her infant. The painting is based on stories of mothers when the UAE gained independence in 1971. In 2010, she participated in a custom toys exhibition at the Dubai International Financial Centre as one of 100 artists who added individual touches to a 20 cm-high white figurine. Her addition was a skeleton wearing a ghutra and headphones which portrayed the traditional yowla dance. In 2011, The Dubai Culture & Arts Authority commissioned Al Saleh to contribute a mixed-media installation to the Sikka Art Fair. Al Saleh was one of 21 artists to contribute to the Maritime UAE exhibition presented in conjunction with the 2012 National Day celebrations. The exhibit paid tribute to the maritime influence on Emirate culture and Al Saleh's contribution featured fish skeletons. In November 2014, Al Saleh contributed to Promesse, an exhibition where 16 artists were asked to interpret Baume et Mercier timepieces. The same year, her painting Money Doesnt Float from her exhibit The Dara Chronicles was auctioned at Bonhams in London. =The Dara Chronicles= In 2013, Al Saleh presented her third solo show, The Dara Chronicles, at The Ara Gallery in downtown Dubai. The exhibit contained digital paintings and mixed-media prints that used X-rays and vintage suitcases. The exhibit was inspired by the stories she heard from her grandfather about the MV Dara explosion of 1961. Her grandfather was a survivor of the incident. The beginning of the exhibit included a brief video with footage she shot while diving at the MV Dara site. In preparation for the exhibit, Al Saleh participated in an exploratory dive at the Dara grave site where she sketched portraits while scuba diving by using treated water-resistant canvases and a special crayon to make initial marks. Her research also included reading letters written by the boat company and police investigators, as well as news articles and stories told by survivors. Much of the original coverage of the event was based on the British media, and The Dara Chronicles provided insight on the hidden stories of people who survived the MV Dara explosion.

(2013). Psychophysiological economics: Introducing an emerging field of study. Journal of Financial Service Professionals, 67(5), 16-18 Psychophysiological economists believe that behavior and cognitive processing are indivisible and that behavioral, cognitive, and physiological tools and techniques can be combined to create interventions that improve the economic well-being of consumers. Psychophysiological economics differs from behavioral economics by focusing on direct measures of physiological change and observational data, in addition to attitudinal measurement. Psychophysiological economics also differs from functional magnetic resonance imaging, which is typically applied exclusively to the study of brain activity. Psychophysiological economics emphasizes the role of the peripheral nervous system as it relates to shaping economic behavior. The peripheral nervous system includes the spinal and cranial nerves. Of specific relevance is the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS). The ANS regulates glands and other internal organs (visceral structures). Visceral structures control involuntary physiological activities and behavior. Psychophysiological economics researchers directly measure the sympathetic nervous system as a person responds to stressor within the environment. Assumptions Three assumptions provide the basis for psychophysiological economics studies. First, stress shapes how consumers react, both physically and mentally, to economic challenges (i.e., stressors). Second, stress cannot be evaluated and assessed easily using traditional observational methods. Third, both eustress (positive stress) and distress (negative stress) can alter behavior by causing changes in a person’s visceral structures. These changes occur involuntarily, but the underlying cause can be measured and evaluated.Grable, J.E., Heo, W., & Rabbani, A. (2014). Financial anxiety, physiological arousal, and planning intention. Journal of Financial Therapy, 5(2), 1-18 Scope As a new field of study, psychophysiological economics tends to be focused on evaluating and assessing physiological aspects of economic behavior. Clinical and experimental research uses the following tools to evaluate stress responses: *Cardiovascular activity: heart rate variability *Electrodermal activity: skin conductance *Peripheral skin temperature: sympathetic activation (sympathetic nervous system) *Respiratory feedback: breathing patterns *Surface electromyography: muscle tension patterns (muscle tone) These tools allow Psychophysiological Economics researchers to evaluate directly, in real time, the relationship between cognition and economic behavior. In general, someone experiencing economic stress (either acute or chronic) should exhibit the following characteristics as they relate to any given economic stressor: (a) muscle tension, (b) increased sweat production, (c) a decrease in peripheral skin temperature, (d) increased breathing, and (e) increased heart rate variability. For those who are experiencing economic stress, specific interventions can be used to reduce such stress. A good source of papers on the topic can be found in the Journal of Financial Therapy.

Boomf now offer a range of gifts, the Boomf 'bomb' (a personalised greeting card that pops out of the envelope) and the Boomf 'Flutter' (a personalised greeting card with a butterfly flying out). Background Boomf was founded in November 2013 by James Middleton and Andy Bell. Middleton had previously founded Nice Cakes, which specialised in personalised cakes. Bell had previously founded Mint Digital, which created StickyGram (now Sticky9), an Instagram magnet company which sold to PhotoBox. Boomf combines elements from both businesses. History In 2014, Boomf raised over $1m and is backed by a number of angel investors, including Nick Jenkins, founder of Moonpig, Duncan Jennings and Matt Wheeler. Boomf launched in November 2013 without mentioning Middleton's involvement, to allow for a low profile launch. In January 2014, Boomf announced Middleton's involvement, believing that it would be impossible to keep it secret long-term. The initial reaction to Boomf was incredulity; in the Bluff the Listener section of NPR's Wait, Wait... Don't Tell Me, one listener believed it was more plausible that Vladimir Putin had a brother Igor who had invented a pill to stop old people smelling, than that the Duchess of Cambridge's brother has launched a personalised marshmallow company. Nevertheless, Boomf shipped 2 tons of marshmallows in its first year and made £100,000 ($168,000) in sales in its first three months. Boomf launched a real-time personalised marshmallow service on a reconditioned Pashley's tricycle in the department store Selfridges, as part of Selfridge's Meet the Makers pop-up season. For Valentines, Boomf created a S'mores pop-up, allowing customers to roast their ex. In July 2015, Boomf launched a nationwide search for a new marshmallow designer.

Redeveloped thirty years later, it is a homebuilt, single engine two seater. More than twenty have been constructed. Design and development In 1966 Jean Pottier designed the P.30 Pétrel. It would have been a single engine, small, shoulder wing monoplane, but it was never built. Thirty years later Pottier produced a revised version seating two side-by-side and designated the P.130 Coccinelle. This venture was supported by the RSA's Bleu Citron () programme and the P.130 has sometimes been referred to as the Pottier Bleu Citron. The Coccinelle is a simple wood framed, fabric covered monoplane, with shoulder mounted wings braced by a single strut each side from the lower fuselage longerons. The wings are essentially rectangular in plan, though with blunted forward tips, and have significant forward sweep. The balanced rudder is almost without a fin, though there is a shallow, triangular fillet in front of the rudder, which is large, straight edged and extends to the keel. The rectangular tailplane, mounted at the top of the fuselage, carries full span, rectangular plan elevators with a central cut-out to allow rudder movement. The Coccinelle's fuselage has a rectangular section throughout and its profile is straight edged except under the engine, where it curves upwards. The side-by-side seats are ahead of the wing leading edge and largely enclosed under a one piece, rear hinged, part bubble type canopy. Behind this are further transparencies which can vary from builder to builder but extend rearwards a little way into the wing. Most Coccinelles have a tail wheel undercarriage with front wheels on thin, steel cantilever legs, though a tricycle undercarriage is an option. Some builders have added spats. Following Pettier normal practice, the Coccinelle was intended for home building from his plans. These allow a choice between the P.130UL, meeting the ultralight certification requirements, or the normal P.130L. The 2014 French register shows that the latter is usually preferred.

He is the inaugural director of the Intelligence Studies Project at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is also a Clinical Professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs and the Bobby R. Inman Chair in Intelligence Studies. During his career in the CIA's Clandestine Service, he completed five overseas tours, including two as chief of station and senior intelligence community representative. He also played key roles in developing the provisions of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and amendments to Executive Order 12333, issued by President Bush in 2008.  Education and early career  Slick holds a Bachelor of Arts degree (B.A.) (with high honors) in political science from the Pennsylvania State University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the UCLA School of Law, where he was a member of Law Review. He also received a Master's Degree in Public Policy from Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs while studying on a John L. Weinberg fellowship. From 1983-1986, Slick was a litigation associate at the Rawle and Henderson law firm in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Slick joined the CIA in 1987. After completing basic espionage tradecraft and foreign language training, Slick was assigned under official cover overseas as an operations officer in Eastern Europe, South Asia, and as Deputy Chief of Station in Eurasia. From 1996-1998, he was assigned to CIA Headquarters, where he directed the CIA's training and tradecraft development for operations in complex security and counterintelligence environments. Slick was awarded CIA's Commendation Medal, Medal of Merit, and the National Intelligence Superior Service Medal, and other awards from the CIA, the Department of State, and foreign governments. In 2018, he was recognized as Penn State's Outstanding Political Science Alumnus by the Department's Board of Visitors.  Career  After serving as Chief of Station in Budapest, Hungary from 1998-2000, Slick returned to Langley to lead the CIA's Balkan Operations. He then became an Executive Assistant to Deputy Director of Central Intelligence John McLaughlin. In 2004, he moved to the National Security Council (NSC) as Director for Intelligence Programs. In 2005, Slick was appointed Special Assistant to the President and NSC Senior Director for Intelligence Programs and Reform. In this latter position, he was an advisor on intelligence matters to the President and the assistants to the President for national security affairs, homeland security, and counterterrorism. At the NSC, Slick chaired the Policy Coordination Committee on Intelligence Programs, leading administrative and interagency reviews of ongoing and proposed covert action programs and sensitive intelligence collection activities. Slick was part of a team led by NSC Counsel John Bellinger and Senior Director for Intelligence Programs David Shedd that supported the development of an administration response to recommendations for government reform put forward by the 9/11 Commission. The team also lobbied for what would ultimately be enacted as the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (the IRTPA). Slick led an NSC staff review of recommendations by the Silberman-Robb Commission regarding intelligence failures in connection with pre-war assessments of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. During his White House assignment, Slick advocated for strong central leadership of the Intelligence Community while preserving the CIA's traditional roles in human intelligence, coordinating intelligence activities overseas, and conducting covert action directed by the President and supervised by the NSC. During President Bush's second term, Slick supported calls by Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell and the President's Intelligence Advisory Board to revise Executive Order 12333. The Order, originally issued by President Ronald Reagan in 1981, served as the “charter” for U.S. intelligence. Many of its terms became obsolete on passage of the IRTPA. Slick led the year-long process of interagency coordination of a revised Executive Order 12333, which President Bush signed in July 2008. After assisting with the transition of intelligence activities to the Obama administration, Slick returned to the CIA in early 2009. He was given a four- year assignment as Chief of Station and the Director of National Intelligence's Representative in a Middle Eastern capital. He retired from federal service in 2014. In January 2015, Slick was named the first Director of the Intelligence Studies Project, sponsored jointly by the Robert S. Strauss Center for International Security and Law and the Clements Center for National Security at the University of Texas at Austin. He was appointed as a Clinical Professor at the University's Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the same time. Slick is Fellow to the Bobby R. Inman Chair in Intelligence Studies.

The term describes how various investors' claims on dividends or on other distributions are queued and covered. Liquidation preference establishes that certain investors receive their investment money back first before other company owners in the event the company is sold, has a public offering, pays dividends, or has another liquidation (payout) event. Types Liquidation preferences can be partial (they apply to less than 100% of investment funds), full (100%), or at a multiple of original investment funds. Further, interest or guaranteed dividends may or may not be added to the preference amount over time. Occasionally the multiple shifts over time as well. Another distinction is that preferences may be \\"participating\\", meaning investors receive their preference first and are then entitled to a share of any remaining funds based on their ownership, or they may be \\"non-participating\\", in which case they receive either their preference amount only with no further right to distributions, or else their proportionate share of distributions but without the preference, whichever is greater. For instance: Participating liquidation preference: As an example, an investor invested $1M in a $6M pre-money valuation ($7M post) with a 2x participating liquidation preference. They would then own 14.4% ($1M/$7M) of the company and would get upside on any change of control. If the company then sold for $15M the investor would get back 2x of their investment first for $2M (2 × $1M) and then the rest of the remaining $13M ($15M – $2M) would be distributed among all shareholders. The investor would then get an additional $1.9M (14.4% × $13M) for a total of $3.9M ($2M + $1.9M). Non-Participating liquidation preference: As another example using the same numbers as above, the investor has a 2x non- participating liquidation preference and a 14.4% ownership of a $7M post-money valuation. If the company again sold for $15M, the investor would have a choice of either receiving $2M (2 × $1M) for their liquidation preference or $2.2M (14.4% × $15M) for their participation. Thus the investor would then receive $2.2M. Preferred stock Liquidation preferences are typically implemented by making them an attribute that attaches to preferred stock that investors purchase in exchange for their investment. This means that the preference is senior to holders of common shares (and possibly other series of preferred stock), but junior to a company's debts and secured obligations. There are several types of liquidation preferences related to preferred stock.

History It forms part of a series of allegorical paintings praising the sacrament of the Eucharist, the Catholic faith and the Counter Reformation and attacking heresy and the Protestant Reformation. They were first conceived as modellos for monumental tapestries to be displayed during major festivals such as Corpus Christi at the Convent of Las Descalzas Reales in Madrid. The paintings took from 1622 to 1625 and were commissioned by Isabel Clara Eugenia, daughter of Philip II of Spain and governor of the Spanish Netherlands, which was not only Rubens' homeland but also included the Brussels tapestry factories. The tapestries after the paintings were produced between 1627 and 1632 in these factories and in the studio of Jan II Raes, before being sent to the Spanish court. Some of the tapisteries show Rubens introduced changes in his final drawingsSee: The other subjects in the cycle were The Triumph of Divine Love, The Meeting between Abraham and Melchizedek, The Victory of Virtue over Heresy, The Victory of the Eucharist over Idolatry and The Defenders of the Eucharist. They were mainly on allegorical themes with strong propagandistic and doctrinal subtext, along with some on Old Testament episodes. The Triumph of the Church was probably one of the central works in the cycle and the resulting tapestry was probably the biggest in the set with the most complex themes and composition.

McLachlan is noted for his work on epidemiological research surrounding the effects of the A1 beta-casein. He believed the existence of this protein in cows’ milk to be a public health issue contributing to both heart disease and type 1 diabetes. In February 2000, McLachlan and his business partner, Howard Paterson, established A2 Corporation Limited (renamed The a2 Milk Company in April 2014) to market A2 cows’ milk, which was free from the A1 beta-casein. A1 versus A2 Milk: Whose Side Are You On? Early life, education, and family McLachlan attended his local primary school where he was one of two students in his class before attending Wairarapa College in Masterton from 1957 to 1961. It was here that he developed his interest in science, a discipline he continued to pursue. In 1962, McLachlan began studying at the University of Canterbury, and graduated with a first-class honours degree in chemical engineering. He then went to the University of Cambridge, where he completed a PhD on the reactions of carbon dioxide in alkaline solutions, supervised by Peter Danckwerts, in 1969. While at Cambridge, McLachlan met a German au pair, Ulrike von Thielen, and they were married within seven months. The couple went on to have three children. Career In 1970, McLachlan returned to New Zealand and began working in the Chemistry Division of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In 1974, he won the first United Development Corporation inventor's prize.Woodford, K. (2007) Devil In The Milk. Illness, heath and politics. A1 and A2 Milk. Nelson: Craig Potton Publishing. Pg. 20 McLachlan first became involved in the dairy industry in 1989 when he became the managing director of Tenon Developments. In a joint venture with Morrinsville Thames Cooperative Dairy Company, they developed a method of producing cholesterol-free butter and low-fat meats using extraction technology. He remained the managing director of Tenon Developments Ltd until his death. While the research project was dropped by the New Zealand Dairy Group, McLachlan's interest in the subject of cholesterol and heart disease remained. He spent five years investigating a potential connection between A1 beta casein protein consumption and heart disease. In 2000, he formed A2 Corporation, backed by Howard Paterson to license technology for testing, production and use of milk containing only the A2 beta casein protein and no A1 protein (primarily which the BCM-7 peptide is a variant of) in cows' DNA.McDonald S. (2001). ‘Groundbreaking research into heart disease’, The Devonport Flagstaff’, May17, page 15. Research McLachlan began his research into milk consumption and heart disease prevalence in different countries in 1994 and continued this work for five years. His research concluded a strong link between the consumption of the A1 beta casein protein and Ischaemic heart disease, childhood Type 1 diabetes and other ailments, and he believed that many people thought to have lactose intolerance are instead sensitive to the A1 protein. Using a genetic test, McLachlan was able to identify cows that produce only the A2 protein. McLachlan's conclusions were not accepted among all scientists; many pointed out that the research was ‘correlative, rather than proven cause and effect’.Ingram M. (2001). ‘The pinta revolution’, The Times’, April 24, page13. McLachlan authored 29 scientific papers and confidential reports and was awarded 11 patents. In 1995, McLachlan was made an honorary senior research fellow of the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Auckland. Death McLachlan died of cancer on 9 August 2003. At the time, acting chief executive of A2 Corporation, Andrew Clarke, said, \\"This has been a double tragedy for A2\\", referring to the deaths of both McLachlan and Howard Paterson within a short period of time.

The prints may have commemorated or helped draw Edo's citizens attention to the progress of the rebuilding.Good News from Hiroshige: A New Interpretation of the Series “One Hundred Famous Views of Edo” Description The modern Shinohashi bridge in Tokyo in a very similar location to the old bridge. The print shows a small part of the wooden Ōhashi (Great) bridge diagonally across the foreground of the image as the bridge crosses the Sumida River. In the background is a boatman punting his log raft towards the Fukagawa timber yards, looking for shelter.Sudden Shower Over Shin-Ohashi Bridge and Atake (Ohashi Atake no Yudachi), No. 58 from One Hundred Famous Views of Edo Also seen is the far bank of the river in a part of Edo known as Atake after the government ship, the Atakemaru that was moored there.Ohashi bridge, evening shower in Atake Two women and four or five men are shown crossing the bridge sheltering under hats, umbrellas or straw capes from a sudden shower of rain. Sudden showers are a recurring theme in ukiyo-e works and here in what Hiroshige calls \\"white rain\\"'Oshashi Bridge & Atake in a suden shower' are depicted using a large number of thin dark parallel lines in 2 directions - a difficult skill in woodblock printing.Sudden Shower over Shin-Ōhashi Bridge and Atake (Ōhashi Atake no yūdachi), from the series One Hundred Famous Views of Edo (Meisho Edo hyakkei)Japanese Language Blog - Hiroshige At the top of the print are dark clouds from which the rain emanates, these are produced using a bokashi technique, another difficult printing technique, and vary significantly between prints. Other bokashi areas seen in some prints are the water around the bridge and the bridge's roadway. The rain, sheltering people and log raft at the centre of the image give the image a sense of movement.Ukiyoe Bridges have been sited at that same location since 1693. https://thehaikuexperiment.wordpress.com/tag/haiku- translation/https://wordpress.com/post/matsuobashohaiku.home.blog/43 The wooden bridge depicted in the print was replaced by another bridge in 1885, completed in 1912 and later moved to a new site elsewhere. The current bridge at the site was erected in 1973. Influence 'Old Putney Bridge' etching by Whistler from the 1870s Some of Hiroshige's most popular prints were produced in the tens of thousands at a low individual cost and due to the opening up of Japan after 1853 were popular both in Japan and Europe where they had a huge influence on the future Impressionist artists.Hiroshige: Master printmaker still making waves Whistler produced a number of prints and paintings using a bridge motif in London in the 1870s that were heavily influenced in their composition and subject by Hiroshige's many bridge prints. He used for example non-Western composition in the siting of the bridges, sometimes using no detailed foreground or background objects, scurrying undetailed people on the bridges, large area of negative space and the odd boat on the river. The theme of scurrying people sheltering from the weather under umbrellas that is typical of One Hundred Views of Edo was an influence on Félix Buhot's Le Petit Enterrement and Hiroshige's high horizons, areas of blue wash and strong foreground imagery with lack of middle ground influenced Auguste-Louis Lepère's prints such as La Convalescente: Madame Lepère. Hiroshige's original woodblock print and Van Gogh's copy in oil Vincent van Gogh was a major collector of Japanese prints,Van Gogh and Japanese Art, Part 1 - The Bridge in the Rain (after Hiroshige) & Flowering Plum Tree (after Hiroshige) decorating his studio with them. He was heavily influenced by these prints, particularly Hiroshige, and made copies of two of the One Hundred Famous Views of Edo, Plum Park in Kameido and this one. He made these copies in order to try out for himself elements he admired such as the cropped composition, blocks of colour with strong outlines and diagonal elements. Van Gogh's painting used brighter colours with greater contrast than the original, conspicuous brushstrokes rather than areas of flat colour, and was also framed with a selection of Van Gogh's approximations to Japanese characters.Bridge in the Rain (after Hiroshige) Hiroshige's print was listed by The Observers art critic Laura Cumming as one of the 10 best skies in art.The 10 best... skies in art The composer Geoffrey Poole produced the work Crossing Ohashi Bridge for the Goldberg Ensemble and named after Hiroshige's print.

He has lived in London since 1968. Studies and Early Career Guillem Ramos-Poquí grew up in Barcelona where he studied painting at the city's School of Fine Art. During the 60s he was a major figure in the Catalan Conceptual art and Arte Povera avant-garde. After being awarded several art fellowships that took him to Paris and New York, he settled in London in 1968 where he studied at the Slade and the Royal College of Art. In 1995 he received his Ph.D. in Fine Art Painting from the University of Barcelona for his art work and thesis entitled The Conceptual Dimension in Art: Theory as an Inherent Component of the Practice of Painting, written in Catalan. He was Head of Fine Art at Kensington and Chelsea College (1990-2004)http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/beyond- words/148321.article and Lecturer in Advanced Painting at Morley College (2004-2012).http://www.morleycollege.ac.uk/morley_gallery/exhibition_archive/457_morley_gallery_painting_advanced_workshop He has exhibited extensively in London and abroad.

Although these 1965 collages have a post-Pop Art feel, their employment of a personal code and incorporation of mechanical, automatic and lyrical formal elements defy categorisation. His 1967 work, exhibited in the Gallery of the Institute of North American Studies in Barcelona, consisted of a series of minimalist 'signs' made with industrial spray paint. Ramos-Poquí was granted the American Elias Ahuja Art Specialist Fellowship to New York, where he had a studio from 1967 to 1968.Artists in Britain Since 1945 (Vol 2: M to Z, pp 1312). David Buckman.

Industrial spray on paper and canvas Arte Povera and Conceptual Art Ramos-Poquí belongs to the generation of Catalan artists of the 1960s who emigrated to Paris, London and New York, including fellow artists such as :es:Antoni Llena, who also spent time in London, Antoni Miralda, Benet Rossell and Jaume Xifra. Ramos-Poquí’s works from this decade include a series of collages juxtaposing dynamic forms with the use of industrial spray paint to allude to mechanical progress. During the 60s he also produced a series of ‘found objects’ belonging to the consumer market, with which he created assemblages. They reveal the impact of Pop Art and the works of Rauschenberg on his work. The small scale and poetic associations of many of these assemblages from the 60s echo the Surrealist objects by Joan Miró and the boxes by Joseph Cornell, as pointed out by the author Gerald L. Bruns'The Materials of Poetry - Sketches for a Philosophical Poetics' Vol I by Gerald L.

In September 1968 he staged an exhibition and installation of his Arte Povera 'found objects' displayed in boxes and Conceptual Art pieces, consisting of 'photographs of ideas', at the Arts Lab in Drury Lane, London. Because of these works he is considered, according to Catalan Art Critic and Historian :ca:Alexandre Cirici i Pellicer, the forerunner of Arte Povera and Conceptual Art in Catalonia.Alexandre Cirici: \\"L'art català contemporani\\" - Edicions 62, Barcelona 1970, p. 296 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0NMMAQAAIAAJ&q;=L'Art+català+contemporani&dq;=L'Art+català+contemporani&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=1DHeVPKHF4Puas- tgfAB&ved;=0CBQQ6AEwAA File:Beggar's_Box_,1968.jpg Beggar's Box ,1968 File:Boxes_and_assemblages,_1968.jpg Boxes and assemblages, 1968 File:Photographs_of_ideas.jpg  Photographs of ideas. Left: 'Girl in a Garden', 1968. Right: 'Aeroplane in a Garden' 1968 Geometric colour field paintings His colour field paintings show the influence of Rothko and North- American Post-painterly abstraction, especially Barnett Newman, Kenneth Noland and Frank Stella. He reached a post-Bauhaus geometric synthesis rooted in theories concerning visual perception, demonstrating an indebtedness to the geometry and colour of Johannes Itten, Rudolf Arnheim, and Josef Albers. In Paris he became acquainted with a Bauhaus pupil of Paul Klee, Mordecai Ardon, while in Chicago he met Gyorgy Kepes who, together with Moholy-Nagy, founded the New Bauhaus (today the IIT Institute of Design in Illinois). Further encounters with Ola Okuniewska (Ola Wolpe) and Clement Greenberg also impacted his work. His passion for geometry continued throughout his career, right up until the present day. During the mid-70s he started teaching in London. His extensive knowledge of the techniques of painting led to him giving a series of demonstrations at the National Gallery and at several art colleges. In London he founded the Essendine Art Centre, where he taught advanced printmaking, life drawing and techniques of painting to young art college graduates. One of the specialized courses focused on 'The Technique of Icon Painting.' https://iconographersireland.wordpress.com/about/ The success of the course led to the commission of a book on this subject, published by Search Press Ltd.

In his recent 2014 mixed-media collages 'found objects', text and fragments of reproductions by the old masters interact with the other elements of the composition. Found objects include dried flowers and leaves, insects, feathers, bottle tops and mirrors, broken clocks, pieces of embroidery, threaded paper, fragments of text or musical scores, and crystals. All of these elements possess intrinsic metaphorical values and, in terms of contrasts of textures, colours and formal transformations, relate to the artist's work as a painter as well as his early collages and assemblages. They affirm that the old masters remain an inspiration to contemporary artists today in their endeavour to interpret the world. A catalogue of these collages includes an introduction by Professor David Jasper, an expert in the field of Hermeneutics (University of Glasgow). He describes his mixed-media collages thus: In the complex and riddling collages of Guillem Ramos-Poquí we might glimpse a recovery of the art of memory as it is rooted in the sense of sight, and in its further verbalisations, a haunting presence of the divine in the midst of the contradictions and strange encounters in the world around us.

Geography and amenities The main village is dispersed astride a gently winding uphill road extending many miles past St Michael’s Church to the south. Its relative concentration of homes commence just south of the Llanfyllin to Llanwddyn road, WNW of Welshpool; on the east side is the cemetery, six houses largely still owned by the local authority, and a couple of bungalows. The church is no longer used, as unsafe. At the centre are The Goat Inn, a post office/shop, and the village hall, opened in 1981, which has frequent whole-community, family and retired community events. History A war memorial is at the centre of the village. Behind it is Poplar Cottage, once the home of E. D. O'Brien (1911-1953), a noted Eisteddfod conductor.http://www.llanfihangelcc.org.uk/Llanfihangelncc/Local_Information_17680.aspx =Ffair Llan= A fair, known as Ffair Llan, used to be held every year on 9 May, when store cattle and sheep were sold to visiting dealers. Piglets were brought by horse and cart, with a mesh strung over to prevent their escape. Demographics Llanfihangel community's population was 467, according to the 2011 census; a 9.5% decrease since the 516 people noted in 2001. The 2011 census showed 52.6% of the population could speak Welsh, a fall from 65.0% in 2001. Governance Llanfihangel-yng-Ngwynfa is in the Llanfihangel electoral ward which elects a councillor to Powys County Council. This ward had a population of 1,049 at the 2011 census. Life in a Welsh Countryside In 1950 Life in a Welsh Countryside, A Social Study of Llanfihangel-yng-Ngwynfa by was published. This was soon seen as a classic study of the social structure and life in a predominantly Welsh-speaking rural community in upland Wales. This study describes the farming, kindred relationships, customs and traditions, and the role of religion, particularly the chapels. In 2003 the Llanfihangel Social History Group published A Welsh Countryside Revisited: A new study of Llanfihangel-yng-Ngwynfa, which records the changes since the original publication such as decline in chapel attendance and preferred use of Welsh.

History In 2013, the National Association of Graduate Admissions Professionals (NAGAP), changed its name to NAGAP, The Association for Graduate Enrollment Management and in 2014 the term started to gain more traction, appearing in publications from both NAGAP and American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO)https://aacrao- web.s3.amazonaws.com/files/ERRrFKrUSgKa26VLIPL2_CUJ8903_WEB.pdf as well as on their websites. Definition In 2014, NAGAP, based on the findings of its Research and Global Issues Committee (LaFave, J., Connor, C., Cipriano, M., Lake, E. and Balayan, A.) rolled out the following definition for graduate enrollment management: graduate enrollment management is a systematic approach to managing enrollment and the graduate student lifecycle from awareness to alumnus by integrating the core functions associated with the support of a graduate student. GEM represents a synthesis of traditional student support areas into seamless, cross-functional operations designed to integrated stakeholders, consolidate key assessment mechanisms, and bolster service levels. A longer definition of GEM followed: graduate enrollment management (GEM) represents a comprehensive approach to the methods by which an institution recruits, admits, supports, retains, and graduates post- baccalaureate students in their respective degree programs. This dynamic paradigm includes codependent functions working congruently to strategically manage overall enrollment levels and the student experience. These include enrollment planning, marketing, recruitment and admissions, advisement/coaching, financial aid, student services, retention, and alumni relations. Regardless of staffing levels, integrated interdependence in GEM will ideally create an environment whereby a cross-trained professional from a graduate office is able to support a student throughout their time at the institution. This approach creates an environment that sustains differentiated student experiences. In 2015, NAGAP released a white paper by Connor, C., LaFave, J., Balayan, A., Integrated Interdependence: The Emergence of Graduate Enrollment Management. Organizations A number of organizations focus on the field of GEM.

She found her flair for fashion design at an early age when she would make clothes for her dolls that matched the latest trends and styles. She later developed that flair when, while attending USC, she worked as a floor model and sales associate at a large department store in Los Angeles in the mid-1930s. After graduating from college, she began working at Bullock's Willshire as a floor model. The names were purely coincidental, as she had no relation to the store-owners. After that she was hired by a milliner, or a hat designer for women, and then an established fashion designer. Realizing this was something she wanted to pursue even further, Georgia then studied at Frank Wiggins Trade School in Los Angeles. All of her work in stores and with customers helped prepare her for her career in fashion.  Career in Fashion  In 1941, she and her partner, Dorothy Phillips, and $50, created a company based on Georgia's one idea for a black dress. This business lasted two years and by 1943, she was doing business by herself. She was only 25 years old. At first she started off doing all the work in a small factory but then, over the years, she began selling her clothes nationally and was being quoted in national newspapers. While designing she always kept in mind the different shapes and sizes of her customers, trying to make clothes that would flatter all of them, backing up her fashion philosophy. Her designs have been described as having \\"high style with simple elegance\\". In the early 1950s, she had a factory in Hollywood, working on her own clothing line as well as taking up a job in Kansas City for the well known clothing company \\"Nellie Don\\" in 1953, all while working from Los Angeles. At first her style was suave and sophisticated, but then she slowly tried to widen the horizon and appeal to other crowds by doing a line of sportswear that seemed elegant and presenting her fashion shows on tennis courts and large estates to draw in the country club crowd. Huge department stores like Saks, I. Magnin's, and Bullock's Willshire, all sold her clothing. They were also seen on the Danny Thomas television show \\"Make Room for Daddy\\". In 1963, she opened up her own line called \\"Miss Georgia\\". This line was cheaper than her other lines (it was around $50). It was more fashion forward than the other lines, being more fashion forward and bold. Her last years as a designer were in the 1970s.  Achievements  In 1966, she received the Designer of the Year Award for her work.  Personal life  In 1948, she was married to Jack Dunbar and had two children (Sandal and Scot), she continued to work, but the marriage later ended in 1961. She remarried in 1962 to Weston Jones Lloyd (1918–1988), that produced her third child, Cynthia. On Friday, June 7, 1991 Georgia died from complications from Alzheimer's, a brain disease that targets the hippocampus area of the brain, in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, California. http://pintuckstyle.blogspot.com/2014/11/georgia-bullock- california-fashion.html http://coutureallure.blogspot.com/2012/08/forgotten- designer-georgia-bullock.html https://articles.latimes.com/1991-06-11/news/mn-425_1_fashion-designer References Category:1918 births Category:1991 deaths Category:American fashion designers Category:Women fashion designers Category:Deaths from Alzheimer's disease ","title":"Georgia Bullock Lloyd"},{"id":"45303726","text":"Luostarinen is a Finnish surname.

Hayfield Farm is a subdivision of Fairfax County, Virginia, that has around 690 houses. It is surrounded by Huntley Meadows Park and wooded military facilities. North, adjacent to the community, is a U.S. Coast Guard station off Telegraph Road. History Shortly after the Revolutionary War, in 1785, George Washington deeded 460 acres of his Dogue Run Farm to Lund Washington, a third cousin and the \\"faithful and trusted manager\\" of the General's Mount Vernon estate. The tract was named \\"Hayfield\\" and a brick dwelling house, completed in 1784 by Lund in anticipation of General Washington's return home, was the site's only substantial structure during Lund Washington's ownership. Upon his death, the farm was conveyed to Lund's widow, Elizabeth Foote. Thereafter, Hayfield was used by various owners as a school, cattle farm and residence. Perhaps the most unusual feature of Hayfield was its Round Barn, built for William Clarke between 1874 and 1887. Clarke's \\"Big Red Barn\\" stood 100 feet high, 100 feet in diameter as a 16 sided double octagonal shaped barn. Damaged by a fire in 1892, Clarke quickly improved the building with an open circular threshing floor, a 250 ton silo at the center, and 200 steps leading to a cupola which topped the new roof. Farm manager J.H. Shertzer boasted that the enormous barn could store 400 tons of provender (hay) and that a wagon and team of six horses might drive around the inside with ease. The structure was indeed a \\"large and commodious barn\\" adorned with gutters, downspouts, and cast iron ornaments in which the initials \\"W.E.C\\" were the central design. Lund Washington's brick house was destroyed by fire in 1917. Hayfield's second Round Barn outlasted successive changes in ownership until it too was lost in a fire on September 22, 1967. This information is on a plaque in Hayfield Park written by the Fairfax County Park Authority. Plaque on display in Hayfield Park. Schools In 1967, Hayfield Elementary School opened then in 1969, the Hayfield Secondary School opened. Both of the schools are part of the Fairfax County Public Schools system.

Journalists first met in 1867, and the club was incorporated in 1877.Denver Press Club History History Members first met in the basement of Wolfe Londoner's grocery store on Larimer Street but outgrew the space and met at various hotels in Denver. Theodore Roosevelt and William Taft were the only two presidents to receive an honorary membership in the form of a solid gold-and-silver membership card to the Denver Press Club. During the 1908 National Democratic Convention, the Denver Press Club served as press headquarters and organizers of the convention's social entertainment. In 1925, members decided to have their own building and chose architects Merill H. and Burnham Hoyt to design the building. The Denver Press Club building was built by Francis Kirchof for approximately $50,000, paid mostly with the sale of Who's Who in the Rockies. In 1945, artist Herndon Davis painted a wall-size mural of Denver journalists in the club's basement poker room. It remains there today. In 1986, the building was designated an Historic Landmark by the Denver Landmark Preservation Commission. The Society of Professional Journalists deemed it as a \\"significant historical place in journalism\\" in 2008. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.

Prouvost was best known for building and owning the publications that became France-Soir, Paris Match, and Télé 7 Jours.  Early life  Prouvost was born into a family of industrialists from Northern France, the son of Albert Felix Prouvost, president of the Commercial Court of Roubaix, and Martha Devémy. Jean Prouvost was not the eldest son Thierry Prouvost: Albert I Félix Prouvost and would not inherit the family firm, Peignage Amédée Prouvost. Prouvost instead borrowed one million francs and in 1911 started La Lainière de Roubaix, a textile company that quickly became a leader in the European textile industry. Jean Prouvost - Le Patron de Presse. Société d’Emulation de Roubaix Newspaper Empire After the First World War, Jean Prouvost focused his interests on the newspaper business. In 1924 he bought Paris-Midi, a Paris daily \\"Paris-midi : seul journal quotidien paraissant à midi\\" that then had a circulation of 4,000. Six years later, thanks to a bold commercial and editorial policy, circulation had reached 100,000. In 1930 he bought Paris- Soir, where he introduced methods proven in the United States: extensive photo spreads, high quality paper, and especially the improvement of content. He recruited top journalists (Pierre Lazareff, Paul Gordeaux and Hervé Mille) and commissioned occasional contributions from prominent literary names: Colette covered various subjects; Jean Cocteau toured the world for the newspaper; Georges Simenon reported on sensational criminal cases. Prouvost hired as war correspondents Blaise Cendrars, Joseph Kessel, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, and Paul Gordeaux. Paris-Soir published story serializations from Maurice Dekobra,Mimi Broadway, Extra de Paris-soir, 7 juin-2 juillet 1932. Pierre Mac Orlan and Pierre Daninos. From 70,000 copies in 1930, the circulation of Paris-Soir reached 1.7 million in 1936. Jean Prouvost soon had an empire that also included Marie Claire, the women's magazine bought in March 1937, and the sports paper Match, bought the following year to Louis Louis-Dreyfus Group. During the Second World War, on 6 June 1940, with France on the verge of surrender, Prouvost became information minister in the Reynaud government and on 19 June 1940 High Commissioner for Information in the Petain government, a post he resigned on 10 July 1940, when Pétain took dictatorial powers. During the Occupation, two versions of Paris-Soir were published: one in Paris, a collaborationist daily disowned by Jean Prouvost and his colleagues, and another published in Lyon. During this period, Jean Prouvost was hated by both the Vichy regime and by the Resistance. At the Liberation he was charged with Indignité nationale, the criminal offense of collaboration with the Nazi regime, but the High Court dismissed the charge in 1947.  Post-War  After that time, Jean Prouvost began to rebuild his empire, dismantled after the liberation. The FFI authorities had confiscated newspapers that had continued to publish after the German 1942 invasion of Vichy France. While he had permanently lost Paris-Soir, which soon became France-Soir under his former employee Pierre Lazareff, Match was reborn in 1949 under the name Paris Match, with Paul Gordeaux as its first editor. Marie Claire restarted publication in 1953. In 1950, Prouvost and Ferdinand Béghin together bought half the shares of the newspaper Le Figaro. In 1960, Jean Prouvost bought TV 60, which he renamed Télé 7 Jours, a television magazine that became a huge success (with a circulation of 3 million copies in 1978). Paris Match's circulation later declined however, suffering from competition from radio and TV. Prouvost appointed the writer Gaston Bonheur as director of his newspaper holdings. In 1966, Prouvost became involved in radio and acquired a significant shareholding in Radio-Télé-Luxembourg. Prouvost was appointed the company's Président administrateur délégué (that is, Chairman and CEO) in 1965. Libération Médias. \\"68 ans sur les ondes\\". 20 January 2001 Prouvost renamed Radio Luxembourg as RTL on 11 October 1966 to make it seem less foreign to French listeners and changed the programming to adopt a more modern and friendly tone. From 1970, the Prouvost empire entered a period of difficulties. In July 1975 Le Figaro was sold to Robert Hersant, while in 1976 Télé 7 Jours was sold to the Hachette group and Paris Match was acquired by the Filipacchi group. By the time of Jean Prouvost's death in October 1978, only the women's publications remained in his family.  Private life  He married Germaine Lefebvre (died 1973), Thierry Prouvost: Lefebvre daughter of Edmond Henri Lefebvre (a Roubaix industrialist) and Julie Marie Grimonprez. In 1951 Prouvost became the mayor of Yvoy-le-Marron, a small village in Loir-et- Cher, where he later retired.

The Adoration of the Magi is a very large oil painting by the Flemish Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens. He first painted it in 1609 and later gave it a major reworking between 1628 and 1629 during his second trip to Spain. It is now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid. It is one of many works on the subject by Rubens - others include those of 1616-17 and 1624. History Towards the end of 1608 Antwerp was preparing to receive the peace delegates negotiating an end to the war between Spain and the Dutch Republic. Their negotiations were to be held in Antwerp City Hall between 28 March and 9 April 1609 and resulted in the Twelve Years' Truce. Hopes were high for the talks and for the renewed economic prosperity that peace or a truce would bring - Antwerp was a major commercial centre and it was in crisis due to the Dutch blockade of the city. The city council decided in early 1609 to commission a painting for the Statenkamer, in which the negotiations would be held, and to choose Rubens for the commission, due to his first-hand experience of Italian art. He had returned to Antwerp and was already the city's most notable painter. He was paid 1,800 florins for the commission. The theme of the commission was an allusion to the benefits the city hoped to gain from peace. There is a sketch for the work in Groninger Museum in Groningen,Adoration of the Magi, by Rubens (in Dutch) as well as several preparatory studies, including Head of a black Magus (private collection, London), a Portrait of a bearded man (Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Palazzo Corsini alla Lungara, RomeHead of an old man, Rubens (in Italian)) and others in the Museum Boymans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam. There is also a study for the whole work in a private collection in London, which allows its original appearance to be reconstructed. In spring 1612 Rodrigo Calderón, a confidant of the duque de Lerma, came to the Spanish Netherlands as an extraordinary ambassador of the king of Spain, presumably with the task of converting the truce into a permanent peace treaty. The town magistrates presented the painting to Calderón, but in 1621 he fell into disgrace and was executed. In 1623 Philip IV of Spain purchased the painting from the sale of Calderón's collection and installed it in his Royal Alcázar of Madrid. In September 1628 Rubens travelled to Spain for the second time, leaving on 29 September 1629. He had been summoned there to inform the king about his peace negotiations with Britain, but was also able to rework the painting while he was there. Francisco Pacheco relates in his work El arte de la pintura \\"[Rubens] changed some things in his painting of the Adoration of the Magi that was in the palace\\". This amounted to a complete re-working, with several details modified, strips added to the top and right hand edges (its original dimensions were 259 cm by 381 cm) and the style updated to that of the late 1620s, heavily influenced by Titian. The painting became very popular within the Spanish royal collection and when Maria Anna of Neuburg suggested sending it to Germany as a gift to her father Philip William, Elector Palatine, she was vetoed by her husband Charles II of Spain. It had to be cut from its frame with a knife, rolled up and thrown out of a window during a fire at the Royal Alcazar of Madrid in 1734 - the cuts and small blisters in the paint (caused by exposure to the heat of the fire) are still visible, though it was otherwise undamaged. It was later installed in the Royal Palace of Madrid, built on the same site, and he then went to the Museo del Prado, in whose inventories it first appears in 1834. In 2004, the painting underwent a complete restoration.Notes on the restoration.2004 exhibition celebrating the restoration.

It is also referred to as The Almonry Heritage Centre, The Almonry Museum and just The Almonry. It is governed by Evesham Town Council. The focus of the museum is on local history, but it also covers history and science more broadly. The museum derives its name from the original use of the building as the almonry of the 14th-century Evesham Abbey The museum opened within this building in 1957. History The Almonry from the rear The Almonry Museum is housed in a 14th-century building that was formerly part of the Benedictine Evesham Abbey, the third largest abbey in England. The building is an almonry, meaning it was the home of the almoner, a monk whose role was to provide alms to the poor. Evesham Abbey was closed by Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, after which the Almonry became the personal home of the last Abbot, Philip Ballard. Two churches, a bell tower and a cloister arch from Evesham Abbey also survive nearby. The Almonry is a grade I listed building and was first listed in 1952. It has a part rubble and part timber framed structure with a Cotswold stone roof. Additions to the building were made in the 15th and 17th-centuries. Following the closure of the Abbey, The Almonry has served as an ale house, offices, tea rooms and a private home. It was purchased by Evesham Borough Council in 1929 and opened as a heritage centre in 1957. Collections and exhibitions Battle of Sevastopol (Crimean War) in 1855 and later given by Queen Victoria to the town of Evesham. Now kept in the garden of the Almonry. The museum has displays in 12 small rooms. There is a focus on the history of Evesham, with topics including Evesham Abbey, the Battle of Evesham in 1265, local agriculture, Anglo-Saxon burial treasure, 18th-century clothing and the impact of war on Evesham. The collections and displays also cover palaeontology, archaeology and history more broadly. There is also a fine art collection. Operations The museum is owned and operated by Evesham Town Council. It shares the Almonry building with the Evesham Tourism Office. The museum is awarded Full Accreditation status by Arts Council, England. Future plans The Great Big Almonry Project was launched in 2013 to seek funding to achieve three aims: to improve the conservation of the historic building, improve the interpretation of the exhibitions and programmes and to increase the physical accessibility of the museum In 2014 the project passed Round 1 of a Heritage Lottery Fund funding bid and was awarded £43,400 development funding towards submitting a Round 2 bid for £1,355,100.

Biography  Oleszkiewicz as a young man (self-portrait?) He came from an impoverished noble family, his father was a musician. With assistance from a family friend, he became a student at the University of Vilnius in 1797. At first, he studied anatomy and physiology, but switched to drawing and painting, taking classes with Franciszek Smuglewicz and Jan Rustem.Biography @ Žemaitija. He also copied paintings at the homes of wealthy people who knew his family. In 1801, he attracted the attention of Count Aleksander Chodkiewicz (1776–1838), a playwright, chemist and (later) a general, who was also a budding patron of the arts.Short biography of Chodkiewicz @ WIEM. Chodkiewicz provided him with the necessary funds to study abroad. In 1803, he went to Paris and enrolled at the École des Beaux-Arts, where he studied with Jean-Simon Berthélemy and Jacques-Louis David. He returned to Vilnius in 1806 and had great success with several historical paintings at an exhibition there in 1809. After failing to obtain a Professorship at the University, he went to Saint Petersburg. His painting of Tsarina Maria Feodorovna providing for the poor won him the title of \\"Academician\\" from the Imperial Academy of Arts in 1812.Short biography of Oleszkiewicz @ WIEM. He soon became a much sought- after portrait painter, but he also created historical, religious and allegorical works. In regards to the latter, he was a prominent Freemason, eventually becoming part of the upper hierarchy at the lodges in Saint Petersburg and Vilnius, until they were outlawed in 1822. His interests extended to theosophy, mysticism and the paranormal. He was also a vegetarian and an early advocate of animal rights, lived in a house full of cats, and gave most of his large income to the poor, in person.Excerpt about Oleszkiewicz from Adam Mickiewicz: The Life of a Romantic, by Roman Robert Koropeckyj @ Google Books. After predicting what would be the worst flood in Saint Petersburg's history, in 1824, he gained a reputation as a soothsayer, although floods there were certainly not uncommon. Later, he was the inspiration for \\"The Sorcerer\\"; a character who appears in Part III of the poetic drama Dziady by Adam Mickiewicz.

It is native to shallow water in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, especially round the coasts of Britain. Description A colony of Morchellium argus consists of a clump of vase- shaped zooids up to long, each supported by a conical stalk about wide, to which sand adheres. Each zooid has a buccal siphon with eight flaps and a tongue-like process underneath. This siphon opens into a large pharynx through which water is drawn into the interior, but the colony has a single exit siphon through which the water from several zooids is expelled. The zooids are translucent white, pale pink or red and there are four small red spots at the entrance to the pharynx, which distinguishes this tunicate from similar species. Distribution and habitat Morchellium argus is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. It is common round the coasts of Britain, as far north as the Shetland Isles. It is also known from the west of France including Arcachon Bay. It is found at depths down to about mainly in caves, under overhangs and on vertical surfaces, often among foliose algae. Biology Morchellium argus draws in water through its buccal siphon, filters out zooplankton and other food particles and then expels the water. Gas exchange takes place at the same time. Morchellium argus is a hermaphrodite. The gonads are in the body cavity and sperm passes out with the exhalent water. When this sperm is drawn into another individual zooid, internal fertilisation can occur. The early developmental stages take place inside the zooid and the larvae are later liberated into the sea. After a short free-living stage, these attach themselves to a surface, undergo metamorphosis, and start a new colony. Further development is by budding of new zooids. The function of the red spots in the pharynx is unclear.

The first Baron's son, the second Baron, represented Londonderry North in the House of Commons as a Conservative. His grandson, the fourth Baron, was a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for the Alliance Party.

In contrast, a linear or non linear equation system is called inconsistent if there is no set of values for the unknowns that satisfies all of the equations. If a system of equations is inconsistent, then it is possible to manipulate and combine the equations in such a way as to obtain contradictory information, such as 2 = 1, or x3 \\\\+ y3 = 5 and x3 \\\\+ y3 = 6 (which implies 5 = 6). Both types of equation system, consistent and inconsistent, can be any of overdetermined (having more equations than unknowns), underdetermined (having fewer equations than unknowns), or exactly determined. Simple examples =Underdetermined and consistent= The system :x+y+z=3, :x+y+2z=4 has an infinite number of solutions, all of them having z = 1 (as can be seen by subtracting the first equation from the second), and all of them therefore having x+y = 2 for any values of x and y. The nonlinear system :x^2+y^2+z^2=10, :x^2+y^2=5 has an infinitude of solutions, all involving z=\\\\pm \\\\sqrt{5}. Since each of these systems has more than one solution, it is an indeterminate system. =Underdetermined and inconsistent= The system :x+y+z=3, :x+y+z=4 has no solutions, as can be seen by subtracting the first equation from the second to obtain the impossible 0 = 1. The nonlinear system :x^2+y^2+z^2=17, :x^2+y^2+z^2=14 has no solutions, because if one equation is subtracted from the other we obtain the impossible 0 = 3. =Exactly determined and consistent= The system :x+y=3, :x+2y= 5 has exactly one solution: x = 1, y = 2. The nonlinear system :x+y=1, :x^2+y^2=1 has the two solutions (x, y) = (1, 0) and (x, y) = (0, 1), while :x^3+y^3+z^3=10, :x^3+2y^3+z^3=12, :3x^3+5y^3+3z^3=34 has an infinite number of solutions because the third equation is the first equation plus twice the second one and hence contains no independent information; thus any value of z can be chosen and values of x and y can be found to satisfy the first two (and hence the third) equations. =Exactly determined and inconsistent= The system :x+y=3, :4x+4y=10 has no solutions; the inconsistency can be seen by multiplying the first equation by 4 and subtracting the second equation to obtain the impossible 0 = 2. Likewise, :x^3+y^3+z^3=10, :x^3+2y^3+z^3=12, :3x^3+5y^3+3z^3=32 is an inconsistent system because the first equation plus twice the second minus the third contains the contradiction 0 = 2. =Overdetermined and consistent= The system :x+y=3, :x+ 2y= 7, :4x+6y=20 has a solution, x = –1, y = 4, because the first two equations do not contradict each other and the third equation is redundant (since it contains the same information as can be obtained from the first two equations by multiplying each through by 2 and summing them). The system :x+2y=7, :3x+6y=21, :7x+14y=49 has an infinitude of solutions since all three equations give the same information as each other (as can be seen by multiplying through the first equation by either 3 or 7). Any value of y is part of a solution, with the corresponding value of x being 7–2y. The nonlinear system :x^2-1=0, :y^2-1=0, :(x-1)(y-1)=0 has the three solutions (x, y) = (1, –1), (–1, 1), and (1, 1). =Overdetermined and inconsistent= The system :x+y=3, :x+ 2y= 7, :4x+6y=21 is inconsistent because the last equation contradicts the information embedded in the first two, as seen by multiplying each of the first two through by 2 and summing them. The system :x^2+y^2=1, :x^2+2y^2=2, :2x^2+3y^2=4 is inconsistent because the sum of the first two equations contradicts the third one. Criteria for consistency As can be seen from the above examples, consistency versus inconsistency is a different issue from comparing the numbers of equations and unknowns. =Linear systems= A linear system is consistent if and only if its coefficient matrix has the same rank as does its augmented matrix (the coefficient matrix with an extra column added, that column being the column vector of constants). =Nonlinear systems= Category:Equations Category:Algebra ","title":"Consistent and inconsistent equations"},{"id":"45304295","text":"Väinö Jalmar Heusala (16 May 1914 - 17 May 1982) was a Finnish sports shooter.

No. 1563 (Helicopter) Flight RAF No. 1563 (Helicopter) Flight RAF was formed at RAF Akrotiri from elements of No. 103 Squadron RAF (103 Sqn) in 1963, flying Bristol Sycamore HAR.14 helicopters, initially, later flying Westland Whirlwind HAR.10s. 1563 (Helicopter) Flt amalgamated with elements of No. 230 Squadron RAF (230 Sqn) on 19 January 1972, to become No. 84 Squadron RAF (84 Sqn), which is currently (2020) still resident at RAF Akrotiri flying the Bell Griffin HAR.2. No. 1563 (Tactical Support) Flight =British Forces Belize= In 1975, with Guatemala in the grip of a bloody civil war, there was a real fear that Guatemalan forces might invade Belize and at the very least widen their Caribbean coastline. To support the resident British Army garrison, a detachment of four Westland Puma HC.1 helicopters from No. 230 Squadron was sent to Belize international airport at Ladyville in November 1975. There they set about supporting the British Army role of deterring aggression from neighbours of Belize and supporting the jungle training task, as well as providing much needed Search And Rescue cover for the military and civilian population. Aircraft and crews proceeded to be deployed from No. 33 Squadron at RAF Odiham and No. 230 Squadron generally with a ratio of 3:1 with three of the four aircraft, (needs checking), and crews being provided by No. 33 Squadron and the fourth crew from No. 230 Squadron due to their operational/training tempo in the European theater. Thus, under normal manning, there would be three pilots and three crewmen from No. 33 Squadron and a pilot and crewman from No. 230 Squadron. Puma helicopters of 1563 Flt were instrumental in securing diplomatic assurances for the future of Belize, after supporting Harrier aircraft of No. 1417 Flight taking part in air shows at La Aurora International Airport, Guatemala City, for the 69th and 70th anniversaries of the Guatemalan Air Force, in 1990 and 1991. =Iraq= To support the Black Watch battle group, (part of UK 4 Armoured Brigade), in eastern Iraq, 1563 (Tactical Support) Flt was re-formed at Basrah International Airport.

It belongs in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome and the Palearctic realm. Geography The Rodope mountane mixed forests cover the higher parts of the Balkan Mountains, the Rhodope Mountains, Rila, Pirin, Vitosha, Sredna Gora, Ograzhden and Maleshevo, situated almost entirely in Bulgaria, as well as in some adjacent areas in Greece, North Macedonia and Serbia. They span an area of 31,600 km2 and are replaced at lower altitudes by the Balkan mixed forests. Flora The number of species of vascular plants in the ecoregion are estimated at 3,000. The lower areas are covered with mixed deciduous woods, most prominently with European beech, Oriental hornbeam, European hornbeam and several oak species. The higher zones are dominated by coniferous forests — Scots pine, Bosnian pine, Macedonian pine, Bulgarian fir, Silver fir, Norway spruce, etc. The highest altitudes support shrubs, heath and Alpine tundra. Fauna The Rodope montane mixed forests are sanctuary to a number of endangered mammal species, such as brown bears, wolves, European pine martens, European otters, wildcats and chamois. More common large mammals include roe deer, wild boars and foxes. Most of the European birds of prey can be found in the region, including the rare Eastern imperial eagle, cinereous vulture and griffon vulture. Protected areas The Rodope montane mixed forests ecoregion holds a total of three national parks, all of them situated in Bulgaria, and they comprise the Central Balkan National Park, Pirin National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and Rila National Park.

Life Lauck was born into a working-class family a small town in a wine- producing region in central Germany, some 63 km (40 miles) to the west of Leipzig. By the time he left school the war had ended and the region in which he lived had become first the Soviet occupation zone in what remained of Germany and then, formally founded in October 1949, the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic. He undertook a training as a pipe-fitter between 1951 and 1955 in the \\"VEB (People owned business) Metal Production and Rolling Mill\\" at Merseburg. He was also, from 1951 up till 1964 a member of the FDJ, which was in effect the youth wing of East Germany's ruling SED (party). A further period of study at the Engineering Academy for Steel Production and Rolling at Riesa followed between 1955 and 1958, leading to a degree in Steel rolling mill Engineering. Between 1958 and 1963 Lauck worked at the \\"VEB William Florin Steel and rolling mill\\" facility at Hennigsdorf, first as Assistant to the Production Director and then as Head of Production. He undertook further study by correspondence course from 1962 till 1968 with the Freiberg Mining Academy.Freiberg in Saxony where there was (and is) a small Mining Academy is not to be confused with Freyburg (Unstrut) in Saxony-Anhalt where Lauck was born. The two are approximately 160km/100 miles apart. In 1963, now aged 25, Hans-Joachim Lauck joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands) which since its controversial creation in April 1946 had become the ruling party, as part of a return to one-party government within this Soviet sponsored version of Germany. As a party member Lauck continued to work in the country's strategically and industrially important steel production sector. From 1963 till 1969 he was Chief Officer, Department Head and Production Director at the \\"VVB (\\"United people's owned businesses\\") steel production and rolling mill\\" at Berlin. After this he worked as Production Director at the \\"VEB Quality and Carbon Steel Combine Hennigsdorf\\", a short distance outside Berlin. From 1970 till 1979 Lauck was the Director of the Brandenburg Steel production and rolling Mill, and from 1979 till 1986 General Director of the Brandenburg Quality and Carbon Steel Combine. In 1975/76 Lauck was a student at the Party Central Committee's \\"Karl Marx\\" Academy, which adumbrated a more openly political career for him. In 1985 he received an engineering doctorate from the Freiberg Mining Academy. Also during this period he served in the Party Leadership Team in Brandenburg, and was, for a number of years, a municipal councilor in Brandenburg. A move into national government came in July 1986 when Hans-Joachim Lauck was appointed Minister for Heavy Plant and Machinery ConstructionMinister für Schwermaschinen- und Anlagenbau in succession to Rolf Kersten. The country's constitution by now asserted the leading role of The Party, so that in some ways it was the primary task of government ministers simply to carry out party policy, though at the higher levels the same individuals were often in positions of power and influence in both institutions, making the distinction relatively unimportant. There were approximately fifteen government ministers covering departments with areas of responsibility not dissimilar from their western equivalents. Additionally, however, under the New Economic System of Planning and Direction (Neues Ökonomisches System der Planung und Leitung) established (formally) in 1961, there were a further (approximately) fifteen ministers with responsibility for individual industry sectors. Lauck was one of these. In November 1986 he joined the country's Council of Ministers.Neues Deutschland 28 November 1986. On 15 January 1990 he became the Minister for Mechanical Engineering in succession to Karl Grünheid in the government of Hans Modrow, remaining in office till the change of government that came about following the country's first and last free national election in April 1990. He was not one of those who had participated in the election, and during the run up to reunification the government no longer employed fifteen junior ministers with responsibility for individual industry sectors: however, Launck continued to work in the Economics Ministry as a deputy departmental director under the government of Lothar de Maizière, which continued in office till the formal reunification of Germany in October 1990.

One of Recognition Professionals International’s founding Board members, Bob Nelson, together with his publishing company, Workman Publishing, created Employee Appreciation Day as a way of focusing the attention of all employers, in all industries on employee recognition.\\" http://holidayinsights.com/moreholidays/March/empappday.htm Though the holiday is still gaining in adoption in the U.S. and abroad, like Boss's Day, Employee Appreciation Day has become an opportunity for managers, company leadership and HR to remember the importance of appreciating employees. Companies often celebrate by letting employees leave early, offering gifts, events or special recognition for workers. Studies show that recognition and appreciation are growing in importance as drivers of employee happiness and engagement. This has resulted in more and more companies and organizations using the day to thank their employees. Many publications such as Inc. magazine, Forbes, and Boston.com, are writing about the holiday to remind employers to recognize and reward employee effort and to offer tips for building a stronger corporate culture through appreciation.

However, it is not considered to be impaired and wild trout naturally reproduce within it. Course Lewis Run begins in southeastern Ross Township. It flows south- southeast for a few hundred feet before turning southwest. The stream then turns west and enters a valley. It then gradually turns south and flows in a generally southwardly direction for a few miles, flowing in its valley alongside State Route 4029 and entering Hunlock Township. The stream eventually turns southwest. After several tenths of a mile, it crosses State Route 4026 and reaches its confluence with Roaring Brook.

She played Madame Hazard in Mount Parnassus or Fairy World at the Surrey Theatre.L. M. Middleton, 'Mountain , Rosemund (c.1768–1841)', rev. Anne Pimlott Baker, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 4 Feb 2015 By the end of 1784 she was appearing for Tate Wilkinson on his York Circuit. Her family travelled north with her, but the coincidence of surname did not indicate that they were related to Tate. She played Clarissa in Lionel and Clarissa opposite Dorothy Jordan who played Lionel. Wilkinson started a long association with Covent Garden in 1786 which continued until 1798. During this time she married John Mountain in 1787. Her husband was initially a violinist but he rose to lead the Vauxhall Gardens' orchestra until he started to lead the Covent Garden musicians in 1794. By this time \\"Mrs Mountain\\" had returned to the theatre after a relatively brief argument with the Covent Garden management from 1792 to 1793. She was able to take major singing roles in Love in a Village as Lucinda.

Pleasant Military Academy was established in 1814 for the purpose of providing in Ossining, New York a school of the first order, where young men might be prepared for college, or for active business life, and where the influences thrown around the students should be such as to develop courteous and manly men. The academy closed sometime in the 1920s. Founding Money for the establishment of the school was raised by contributions from public spirited men of Westchester County, New York and elsewhere. The first contribution was made on November 13, 1813, and up to August, 1831, the sum of $1,083.81 had been contributed. It would seem, therefore, that almost from the start the school had been self-sustaining. The first name on the list of contributors is that of Daniel D. Tompkins, Governor of the State of New York from 1807 to 1817 and Vice President of the United States from 1817 to 1825. It was characteristic of the man that in the midst of his herculean tasks as defender of the State during the second war with England, he could find time to devote some attention to the little school at Mount Pleasant. It is said of Tompkins that he \\"did more than the Federal Government for the success of the operations on the Canada–US border, pledging his personal and official credit when the New York banks refused to lend money on the security of the U.S. Treasury notes without his endorsement. He advanced the means to maintain the military school at West Point, to continue the recruiting service in Connecticut, and to pay the workmen that were employed in the manufacture of arms at Springfield\\". But he did not overlook the movement for better education in his native county. 19th-Century There is scant record of the conduct of the school from 1814 to 1820, but on March 24 of that year an act was passed in the Legislature of New York, incorporating Mount Pleasant Academy and from that time on have been preserved full and complete records of the school. The worthy aims of the school are quaintly set forth in an advertisement printed in the \\"New York Commercial Advertiser\\" for April 28, 1823, over the signature of General Aaron Ward, Secretary of the Board of Trustees and one of the original incorporators of the Academy. General Ward says in part: \\"In this Seminary the academic year will commence the 1st of May next. The Trustees, therefore, respectfully beg leave to recommend it to the public, as an institution where youth are taught, by easy graduation, from the first rudiments of knowledge to the higher classics, sufficient to qualify them for admission into any of the American colleges, and more particularly for Columbia College, in the City of New York; or prepare them for the various stages of life. The Academy is pleasantly situated on the banks of the Hudson, within 33 miles of the City of New York, in a healthy village, possessing many local advantages, among others a daily communication with the city, either by land or water; good medical advice, and the use of several churches.\\" Even today we need add little to these quaint words except possibly to say that daily communication with the city has been replaced by an hourly train service. But the village boat still leaves its dock in the early morning, returning from the city with the lengthening shadows of evening. In 1824 application was made to the Legislature for financing aid for the Academy and an act was passed on the 17th of November of that year providing a fund which ultimately netted the school about $1,200. On the 3rd day of April, 1827, a new charter was granted to the Academy by the Regents of the University of the State of New York and under that charter the school is directly responsible to the Department of Education of the State and is subject to the supervision of that department. The Principal is responsible to a Board of Trustees. By 1830 the school had outgrown its accommodations and the trustees began to plan for greater things. The old school property was sold and the land on which the school is now located was purchased. Again subscriptions were called for and this time the sum of $3,356.10 was pledged by friends of the school. In all, then, there was raised for the school, by voluntary contributions, $4,439.91, during the ninety-six years of its existence, and there was approved by the Legislature $1,200. All other funds for improvement and development have been derived from the legitimate revenues resulting from the careful and businesslike management of the school throughout its existence of almost a century. This record is unique and is one of which any school might be proud. In 1833 the stone building, now known as Junior Hall, was erected, and it is interesting to know that the money for this building was loaned to the school by the Hon. William Jay, son of Chief Justice Jay, himself, as well, a great jurist, a public spirited citizen and one of the best known and most highly respected men of his day. About this time a further, but unsuccessful, petition for assistance was made to the Legislature in which the following dignified and illuminating language was used: - \\"Your petitioners have, for a number of years past, been assiduously engaged in rearing and maintaining a literary institution that might essentially aid the cause of Literature and Science in our favored country. Under the smiles of Providence, their academy has been rising and its pupils multiplying until the buildings heretofore occupied by the institution have become wholly inadequate to their comfortable accommodation.\\" So the school went on with varying fortune until, with the entrance of Mr. C.F. Maurice as Principal in 1845, it came to its own. Mr. Maurice evidently was a rare man and he gave to the school a distinctive atmosphere that it retains to this day. On March 1, 1860 Mr. Maurice withdrew, but was soon after elected a member of the Board of Trustees where he continued to serve the school faithfully and well for many years. In 1860 Messrs. Benjamin and Phelps were chosen principals, the latter retiring in 1864. In October 1867 we find the names of Stephen Gilman and J. Howe Allen associated with that of Major W.W. Benjamin as principals of the school. Mr. Gilman was graduate of Harvard College, but his connection with Mount Pleasant ended in 1869 and the Associate Principalship of Messrs. Benjamin and Allen began, to continue until the death of the former in 1883. Major Benjamin was a graduate of Norwich University and he proved himself to be an able disciplinarian and a successful man of business. Mr. Allen graduated from Middlebury, was a man of scholarly attainments and of natural aptitude as a teacher. He had, too, the ability to win and hold the confidence of boys. The association, therefore, of these two men was a happy one for the school and under them Mount Pleasant continued to prosper. From 1883 to 1894 Mr. Allen was sole principal, rounding out in 1894 a period of service extending over thirty-two years and covering a most prosperous period of the school's history. From 1894 to 1895 Mr. Elijah Cook was the principal with Mr. Charles F. Brusie, formerly Professor of English in Kenyon College, as Associate. In 1895 Mr. Brusie assumed the principalship, associating with him Mr. A.T. Emory, a former teacher at Mount Pleasant. In 1902 Mr. Emory withdrew and since that time Mr. Brusie has been at the head of the school completing in June, 1914 a service of twenty years at Mount Pleasant Academy. 20th- Century In 1913 Mr. Brusie associated with him Dr. Edward D. Graber who for six years had been principal of the High School at Greenwich, Conn., and under the management of these two gentlemen the school starts out on the second century of its existence. During its hundred years of service Mount Pleasant Academy has kept pace with the advance of education, standing always for that which is permanent and substantial and opposed to the element in the educational world that is every crying for change, evidently thinking that all change must be progress. Mount Pleasant has adhered to the old principle that true education, particularly for the secondary school, is about synonymous with mental development, and, therefore, for a boys' boarding school the question is not so much \\"what?\\" as \\"how\\". In these days Mount Pleasant would probably qualify as a conservative progressive, holding on to the best of yesterday and not too eager to experiment with the possibilities of tomorrow, holding that these experiments belong to the laboratory of the university rather than to the secondary school where boys are trained to be men. In material equipment Mount Pleasant has successfully met the demands of the times, providing all that is necessary to the comfort, safety and happiness of the growing boy, but teaching always simplicity of life and living. Honesty, thoroughness, graciousness, real manliness are the watchwords at Mount Pleasant Academy, and the keynote of its teaching is \\"service\\". What the educational world and the public generally think of Mount Pleasant's past and its outlook into the future can best be judged from the list of colleges and universities that thought it worth their while to be represented at this celebration, by the letters and telegrams received from men of culture and influence and by their expressions of approval printed on these pages.

In the 1830s and 1840s much thought was given to building a railway from central Scotland to join the growing English railway network. The hilly terrain and sparse population of the Southern Uplands made the choice of route contentious. The Caledonian Railway succeeded in opening its line by way of a summit at Beattock in 1847 and 1848. It connected Glasgow and Edinburgh with Carlisle, and there was a branch to connect with another railway to Perth. The approaches to Glasgow were over existing mineral lines, but a superior route was later built. The original route is a principal main line today, subject to the modifications approaching Glasgow, and later improved terminals there and in Edinburgh. The route is electrified and forms the northern section of the West Coast Main Line railway. The general history of the company is described in the article Caledonian Railway and detail of the development of the route is at Caledonian Main Line. History =Coal railways= Primitive railways had been used in connection with mineral extraction from the sixteenth century in Central Europe, but these were not railways as we know them now: they simply allowed the manoeuvring of single wagons loaded with heavy materials within mines or from mines and quarries to another transport medium. For some time the choice was between transport on the back of a pack animal—early roads were rarely stable enough for heavy wheeled vehicles—or on water, either a river or increasingly from the eighteenth century a canal. In the nineteenth century the technology of railways developed rapidly to satisfy the demands of growing cities, such a Glasgow, and industry, particularly the iron industry. In 1812 the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway opened to convey coal from pits in the Kilmarnock area to a harbour at Troon. It was a plateway in which the \\"rails\\" were L-shaped plates; the upstand of the profile guided the wagon wheels, which did not have flanges. In 1826 the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway opened; this was an edge railway in which the wagon wheels had flanges for guidance, and the rails were deeper and stronger: strong enough to support heavy steam locomotives. The engineer for the scheme was Thomas Grainger, assisted by John Miller. The success of the Monkland and Kirkintilloch line, and the discovery of good quality coal and iron deposits, and of a new method of smelting iron ore, encouraged other lines in the west of Scotland, also engineered by Grainger and Miller. The permanent way was cast iron fish- bellied rails on stone block \\"sleepers\\", and the track gauge was 4 ft 6 in (1,372 mm). A number of other railways, particularly in the west of Scotland, followed, notably the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway of 1831, which extended and reconstituted itself as The Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway in 1845, and the Wishaw and Coltness Railway in 1844. Collectively these lines were known as the coal railways. =Linking with English railways= In 1825 the Stockton and Darlington Railway in north-east England had started operating, with enormous success. It now became clear that locomotive railways had potential, and in 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened, the first inter-city railway in the world. Definite plans were being made for what became the London and Birmingham Railway (opened in 1837 - 1838) and the Grand Junction Railway (which progressively opened from 1837). Grainger and Miller were commissioned in 1835 to assess the route of a line linking Glasgow and Kilmarnock and Ayr; this became the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway, and the promoters had the definite intention of somehow linking Carlisle and the English railways. The critical issue was finding a route crossing, or going round, the high ground of the Southern Uplands and the Cheviot Hills and the Pennines. The locomotives of the time were considered unable to ascend steep and lengthy gradients. Grainger and Miller designed a route via Kilmarnock, Mauchline, Sanquhar and Dumfries; its gradients were moderate but it was circuitous; it became known as the Nithsdale route. Lancashire businessmen had been the driving force in many of the English railways, and as their plans already encompassed a network from London to Preston, their thoughts turned to reaching central Scotland. In 1835 the Grand Junction Railway commissioned the young engineer Joseph Locke to propose routes from Glasgow to Carlisle. His report examined two routes: a route following the Annan Water with a summit near Elvanfoot. This became known as the Annandale route. However it involved gradients of 1 in 75 over ten miles—at the time considered impossible—and did not pass near any major population centre. The alternative was a longer route similar to Grainger and Miller's Nithsdale route, with gentler gradients and passing through more populous areas. Locke recommended this, and his opinion was taken as authoritative for the time being.C J A Robertson, The Origins of the Scottish Railway System, 1722 - 1844, John Donald Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh, 1983, Landowners on the Annandale route were disappointed, aware of the prosperity that a railway could bring. The Grand Junction did not immediately act on the report they had asked for: there were difficulties further south in reaching Carlisle. Locke produced a second report, in 1837; he now found that the worst gradient could be moderated, to 1 in 93. Moreover, technical improvements in locomotives meant that the gradient was not such a daunting challenge. The Annandale route had the advantage that Edinburgh could easily be served from it. Others were putting several other routes forward; chief among these was a route following the east coast; it was taken for granted at the time that only one trunk line between central Scotland and England was sustainable, so all the proposals were presumed to be mutually exclusive. Locke revised his survey the following year, finding that the worst gradients could be eased a little, but now money was suddenly hard to come by, and a proposed trunk railway was inopportune. David Ross, The Caledonian—Scotland's Imperial Railway—A History, Stenlake Publishing Ltd, Catrine, 2013, =The Smith-Barlow Commission= Routes to England considered by Smith and BarlowThere was considerable public interest in the formation of a railway to England. Many schemes had been put forward in the press; not all of them were practicable and many were driven by sectional interest; for example the Borders towns were pressing for a route through their area; interests supporting the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway favoured a route that connected with that line, bringing it traffic; promoters in Newcastle wanted a route from Tyneside. In 1839 a public meeting chaired by the Lord Provost of Glasgow decided to review the alternatives; but before the engineers' report could be assessed the Government decided to appoint its own commission, and Professor Peter Barlow of the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, and Colonel Sir Frederick Smith, Inspector General of Railways at the Board of Trade, were appointed to \\"make recommendations on the most effective means of railway communication from London to Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dublin\\". They considered 16 schemes, although several were simply variations of one another; they were surprised that most of the promoters were unable to provide more than the most basic details of their proposals, and they found wild and inexplicable variations in unit costs assumed. Their report was published on 15 March 1841: they repeated the assumption that only one line was required linking Scotland and England. The Annandale route was favoured, but it was qualified: anyone could build such a line provided they gave an undertaking to reach Lancaster, at that time the northern extremity of planned English railways. If this undertaking were not given, an east coast route would have preference. The uncertain conclusion, and the absence of Government money (which some had supposed the Commission would disburse), and a severe renewed tightness of the money market, stalled the whole thing for more than two years. =The East Coast route first= In fact in the following years, the insistence on a single route to England became an irrelevance, and the North British Railway issued a prospectus in August 1843 for a line from Edinburgh to meet the Newcastle and Berwick Railway. =Definite moves at last= On 19 February 1844, a Preliminary Committee, meeting in London, determined to issue a prospectus for a line from Carlisle to Glasgow to Edinburgh; the line would be called the Caledonian Railway Company.The name had been considered before, in the sense of a railway from Lancaster into Scotland. In 1844 the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway had extended to Whifflat (later spelt Whifflet), renaming itself to the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway. At Whifflat it joined the Wishaw and Coltness Railway, and the committee discussed the possibility of running over these lines to get access to Glasgow, and agreement with them was secured. They agreed to change the gauge of their lines to suit the standard gauge of the future Caledonian Railway. By now many other railway schemes in Scotland were under construction. The Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway had started operating in 1842, and the Scottish Central Railway was being actively promoted, as a branch from the E&GR; Perth. The North British Railway, connecting Edinburgh with Berwick- on-Tweed and therefore English east coast locations, was under construction. If the Caledonian did nothing, all the traffic from north of the central belt would go to other railways. Strenuous efforts resulted in agreement with the Scottish Central to form a junction with them near Castlecary (west of Falkirk), and a branch to that point was added to the Caledonian proposals. In fact the branch was complicated: the Caledonian already proposed to run over the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway (GG&CR;) from Whifflat. Another coal railway, the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway (M&KR;) ran alongside the GG&CR; at Gartsherrie, continuing north to the canal basin at Kirkintilloch. Agreement was secured to run over 1,170 yards (1,070 m) of that line, then diverging at Garnqueen to run north-east to Castlecary. The M&KR; was still using the old track gauge, but, now feeling its track to be outdated, it too agreed to convert the gauge to suit the Caledonian. Finally, the Caledonian promoters saw that the Clydesdale Junction Railway was being put forward. It was to connect the Wishaw and Coltness Motherwell and the south side of Glasgow, incorporating and upgrading an earlier horse-operated mineral line, the Polloc and Govan Railway. The CJR would provide a more direct entry into Glasgow than the Garnkirk line, (and it was not certain that the former coal railways would give adequate precedence to express passenger trains over their mineral movements) so this was a useful ally to have. O S Nock, The Caledonian Railway, Ian Allan Limited, London, 1961 =Lord Dalhousie's report= In 1841, Professor Peter Barlow and Sir Frederick Smith had reported on a preferred route for a railway connecting with England; this report had not commanded much compliance. Now in 1844 the Government appointed a commission to recommend a route; once again the presumption was that only one trunk route into England could be supported. The investigation was led by Lord Dalhousie, President of the Board of Trade. It supported the Annandale route, and therefore the Caledonian scheme, and recommended that other lines under consideration should be restricted to local traffic only: the Nithsdale route should terminate at Cumnock, and a proposed Edinburgh to Carlisle scheme (an offshoot of the North British Railway, should stop at Hawick. =An Act= The Caledonian Railway main line in 1849A prospectus for the Caledonian Railway, capital £1,500,000, was issued on 12 April 1845. Six weeks were spent in committee in Parliament, and the efforts were crowned with success: An Act for making a Railway from Carlisle to Edinburgh and Glasgow and the North of Scotland, to be called The Caledonian Railway was passed on 31 July 1845. The share capital was to be £1,800,000. The Caledonian had anticipated that the Scottish Central would work with it in acquiring and upgrading the relevant coal railways, but the SCR now declined those opportunities, and announced on 25 September 1845 that it was planning to merge with the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway. The long gestation period had not been wasted, and construction was able to start immediately. Other new railways were authorised in the same session, in particular the Scottish Central Railway, and the Clydesdale Junction Railway. =A frenzy of acquisitions= Having achieved authorisation to build a long, and expensive main line, the Caledonian did not simply concentrate on completing the construction, but set about a complex set of negotiations designed to spread the area controlled by the company as far as possible. In most cases it did so by guaranteeing the dividend receivable by the other companies' existing shareholders. This simplified the process of gaining control, but committed the Caledonian to large and continuing periodical payments for the future. Parliament approved the acquisition of the CJR by the Caledonian Railway on 18 August 1845. The CJR would give access to quay facilities on the Clyde, and also to the Paisley lines (the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway (GP&GR;) and the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway. On 27 January 1846 a working agreement with the GP&GR; was finalised, and on the same day a lease was agreed with the Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway. Agreement to lease the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway was made on 1 January 1846, and in August the Clydesdale Junction Railway, still under construction, was acquired. The CJR had itself recently acquired the Polloc and Govan Railway. On 1 January 1847 the Wishaw and Coltness Railway was leased. In 1846 the Caledonian was committed to reaching the city of Glasgow over the Garnkirk line, with a terminus inconveniently located at Townhead, at the north-eastern periphery of the city. The Clydesdale Junction gave access to quays on the Clyde, but not to the city centre. The Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway had been authorised, but the location of the Glasgow end of the line is not clear. The CR and the GB&NDR; collaborated in fostering a Glasgow Southern Terminal Railway, which was to build from near Titwood Place, PollokshieldsOn the GB&NDR; route near Strathbungo. to a bridge over the Clyde and a central Glasgow terminus at Dunlop Street, close to the later location of St Enoch station. While the proposal was obviously convenient for travellers, it aroused fierce opposition in the city, and the Admiralty demanded a swing bridge over the Clyde. A foreshortened version of the scheme, reaching only as far as the South Side terminus near Cumberland Street, was authorised on 16 July 1846. Numerous other railway schemes had been proposed in the 1845 and 1846 sessions, many of them with \\"Caledonian\\" in their title although unconnected. A general tightness of money made many of these unable to proceed to Parliament, or if authorised to be constructed, but the CR was anxious to complete its line; the several English railways that were to form the West Coast Route had consolidated under the title the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) and had reached Carlisle on 15 December 1846, adding to the feeling of urgency. Premium payments were offered to the contractors if they could finish the construction early. Adding to the frenzy of alliances, the Scottish Midland Junction Railway now came under notice; it had an authorised line northwards from Perth to Forfar, but having connectivity to several further destinations. After lengthy discussions, its line was agreed to be leased to the Scottish Central Railway by decision of 18 February 1847; the SCR itself was already agreed to be leased to the CR, although this fell through in mid-1847. Later in 1847 leases of the Dundee and Perth Railway and the Dundee and Arbroath Railway were confirmed. =Opening at last= On 1 and 4 September 1847 Captain J L E Simmons, Inspector of Railways at the Board of Trade made an inspection of the line as far as Beattock. There were nine viaducts, 39 overbridges and 37 underbridges, and 11 level crossings. The track was double, with 75 lb/yd rails on cross-sleepers. There had been a slip of the embankment on Solway Moss, near the English border; actually the moss itself had subsided under the weight of the embankment, and \\"by dint, however, of great exertion, [the subsided section] was completely filled up previous to my return on the 4th\\". Simmons approved the opening to passenger trains, subject to the Moss section being watched, and run over slowly.Report, Captain J L RE Simmons to Commissioners of Railways, 6 September 1847 On 9 September the Directors had a trial trip and on the 10th, public operation started, from Carlisle to Beattock. There were three trains each way daily, with onward coach connections for Glasgow and Edinburgh, giving a journey time to and from London of the order of 22 hours. On 14 February 1848 the Directors were able to make a trial trip between Glasgow and Beattock, and the following day a full service started, with through coaches to and from London. The Glasgow terminus was the Townhead station of the Garnkirk line. This opening was followed by opening between Edinburgh and Carstairs on 1 April 1848; passenger trains ran between Edinburgh and Glasgow. =The Scottish Central Railway= The Scottish Central Railway and the Caledonian were physically joined at Greenhill Junction (near Castlecary) on 7 August 1848. The SCR had opened on 22 May 1848 with a junction to the E&GR; at Greenhill. The original plan had been for the Caledonian to lease the SCR but that had fallen through. In the run-up to the day of making the connection, another attempt was made to agree arrangements—the SCR did not have enough engine power to work its line itself—but the SCR wanted more payment than the Caledonian was prepared to pay, and the agreement fell through once again. A compromise temporary arrangement was agreed in early October 1848. With the opening of the Scottish Midland Junction Railway main line on 20 August 1848, a through route from Dundee to London was available. The line was to be leased jointly to the Caledonian and the E&GR.; The Caledonian and the E&GR; had agreed to lease the Scottish Central Railway (which itself held leases of other companies), but Parliamentary authority was required. Now differences opened up between the Caledonian and the E&GR; on the issue, with the outcome that the SCR was informed that the lease would not be taken up. However the Caledonian concluded a working agreement with the SCR, effective from 1849. =Shareholder dissatisfaction= The Company had now taken on a huge number of leases of other companies, and in most cases what appeared to be generous guaranteed rentals had been committed. Many shareholders believed there was little chance of operating income paying off those charges, and when the Directors announced that they had leased the Dundee and Perth and Aberdeen Railway Junction Company there was an explosion of discontent. (The D&P;&ARJ; had been formed when the Dundee and Perth Railway leased the Dundee and Newtyle Railway and the Dundee and Arbroath Railway.) Shareholders passed a vote of no confidence in their directors, but at a Special Meeting at Euston on 10 November the board secured a narrow majority of support. =Working results to 1849= The alarm about financial mismanagement did not go away. A 3% dividend was declared at the end of 1848, while guaranteed dividends to leased companies' shareholders up to 9% were being paid out. It was later asserted plausibly that this was an illegal payment of dividend out of capital. At the shareholders' meeting on 26 February 1849 a large volume of improper shareholdings in other companies was revealed: this was discovered to amount to £492,000 in holdings kept secret from shareholders. By the end of 1849 it was disclosed that the company had expended £1,984,764 on constructing the line, more than £700,000 above the contractors' tenders. A Shareholders' Committee examined the activities of the directors and it was critical of numerous commitments taken on. It accepted that good faith had motivated these dealings, though many of them were probably illegal and also not immediately beneficial to the company in cash terms. However although the Directors were heavily criticised, there was no fundamental change in the board, directors retiring at the expiry of their ordinary terms. Meanwhile, the lease of the Wishaw and Coltness Railway was ratified by parliament on 28 July 1849, and of the Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway on 1 August 1849. =Opening of Buchanan Street and South Side stations= On 1 June 1849 the Clydesdale Junction Railway was completed; it connected the Wishaw and Coltness line at Motherwell (old station) and the new South Side station in Glasgow, alongside the Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway station there (opened on 27 September 1848). Now trains from London used South Side as their Glasgow terminus. Hamilton was linked in to this route from 10 September 1849. On 1 November 1849 Buchanan Street station opened, on an extension of the Garnkirk line. Trains to Edinburgh, Stirling and Carlisle used the new station; the Stirling trains had to reverse at Gartsherrie Junction. The Garnkirk's old Glebe Street (Townhead) station was reduced to goods and mineral duties. =The first lap completed= As 1849 drew to a close, the Caledonian Railway had completed its first task: the railway was open from Glasgow and Edinburgh to Carlisle, with through trains running to and from London. Between Glasgow and Edinburgh a competitive service was run, although the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway completed the journey faster. Carlisle Citadel station was in use, jointly owned with the London and North Western Railway. Through trains ran to Stirling and Perth over the Scottish Central Railway line from Greenhill. =Financial woes= However the company was in extremely poor financial health, due to huge financial commitments taken on by leasing other companies: these arrangements had mostly been made in good faith, but possibly reckless enthusiasm, to secure territory against incursion from rival companies, of which there were many. In most cases the agreements had been to pay a fixed percentage on the capital of the leased company, and this represented an unbearable burden on the Caledonian's income. In other cases some illegalRoss, page 53 dealings in other companies' shares were disclosed when shareholders forced an enquiry. The lease agreement of the Dundee and Perth and Aberdeen Railway Junction was repudiated, on the basis that it was illegal. Some other lease agreements were renegotiated somewhat more favourably. Nonetheless at the end of 1849 a shareholder enquiry estimated that an annual loss of £66,164 (excess of lease charge over revenue) was being incurred on active leased lines. In February 1850 matters came to a head; two bank debentures totally £245,000 were due for repayment, as well as considerable arrears of lease charges to the Wishaw and Coltness and others. There was a clear-out of board members, but the new board faced a daunting challenge; it was hoped to convert the debentures into mortgages, and possibly to merge with the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway. On 1 April 1850 the Aberdeen line was completed and the Caledonian was now part of a through line from London to the Granite City. The Company now tried to stall the agreed merger with the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway, which was itself mired in controversy over financial irregularity. The task for the new board now was to operate the railway and generate some cash income. Passenger train service The 1850 Bradshaw's Timetable shows five trains each way daily (two on Sundays). Two of the weekday trains called at all stations. Most of the trains divided at Carstairs with separate Glasgow and Edinburgh portions, and again at Gartsherrie with separate Perth portions.Bradshaw never explicitly says that there are through coaches as opposed to a connection. The fastest journey from Glasgow Buchanan Street to Carlisle is 3hrs 22mins, but there is a single train shown from South Side (over the Clydesdale Junction line) joining the same train at Motherwell requiring 20 minutes less; the distance is 2 miles less. The same train reached London Euston in 9hrs 50mins from South Side. No passenger train used the Float Junction to Lampits Junction curve in this timetable.Bradshaw's General Steam Navigation and Railway Guide, 3rd mo, (March) 1850, reprinted by Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2012, After 1850 The Caledonian Railway quickly established itself as the dominant route from Central Scotland to England, rivalling the Glasgow and South Western Railway and the North British Railway. It had expended much energy and money on securing alliances with other trunk routes, and its financial performance disappointed shareholders in the subsequent decades. It concentrated on developing the areas it served, and minerals became a particularly important traffic. Rivalry with the G&SWR; and the NBR descended into bitter and often destructive competition to retain dominance in areas it considered its own, and to penetrate areas of other lines. The sparsely populated terrain south of Lanark militated against the construction of branch lines: there were only a short line to Moffat, a Wanlockhead branch, a Dumfries branch, and an ambitious line crossing the Solway Firth to bring mineral trains in without passing through the congested Carlisle area. Both these routes have long closed. Glasgow Central station was opened in 1879, giving a more convenient, and modern, access to the city for the route. With its English partner, the London and North Western Railway, it formed a strong alliance, operating together as the West Coast Main Line, a term used to this day. From 1923 the two companies with others were grouped by the Railways Act 1921, forming the London Midland and Scottish Railway. Many intermediate stations were closed in the 1960s, and in fact outside the central belt, only Lockerbie and Carstairs stations remain open. The first main lines described above remain as important trunk routes, modified in the approaches to Glasgow and the main passenger terminal there and in Edinburgh. The climb to the summit at Beattock continued to be a daunting obstacle until electrification on 22 April 1974, since when the available traction power has diminished the problem.J C Gillham, The Age of the Electric Train, Ian Allan Ltd, London, 1988, Today there is a frequent passenger service and significant freight flows.

The Adoration of the Magi is a c.1617-18 painting by Peter Paul Rubens. It is now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts de LyonInv. A.118. Since it is horizontal rather than vertical it was probably commissioned for a private collection rather than as an altarpiece. Peter C. Sutton suggested that, as Rubens' treatments of this subject in vertical formats were for known ecclesiastical commissions as altarpieces, the horizontal format, which is shared with Rubens' Adoration painted for the Statenkamer of Antwerp's town hall, c. 1608-09, might suggest that the Lyon painting was also a secular commission.Peter C.

Simmons Sr. (September 27, 1901 – August 20, 1994) was an American lacrosse coach who was the head coach of the Syracuse Orangemen men's lacrosse team from 1931 to 1970. Simmons's teams posted more than 250 wins in his career, and he is a member of the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame. As a lacrosse player, he was an All-American in 1924 and a member of Syracuse's 1924 and 1925 national championship-winning teams. Simmons was also a quarterback for the Syracuse football team, and a boxing and football assistant coach at the university for more than 30 years. Early life Simmons was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 27, 1901, according to the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame; The New York Times placed his birth year at 1899 or 1900. Simmons attended Hyde Park High School before attending the University of Chicago. He was expelled from the college after entering at halftime a 1920 game being played by Hyde Park's football team at Lansing, Michigan, in which he scored a touchdown that allowed Hyde Park to gain a tie. The incident made headlines in the local press, and University of Chicago coach Amos Alonzo Stagg said that he had \\"too much school spirit.\\"Pitoniak, pp. 55–56. Simmons then enrolled at Syracuse and played quarterback for the university's football team. In three seasons, the Orangemen went 22–4–3 with him on the team; Simmons was referred to as the \\"Hobo Quarterback\\".Pitoniak, p. 56. Originally, he intended to only play football at Syracuse. However, he took up lacrosse after finding a stick. Simmons was named to the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) All-American Team as a defender in 1924, and played on the 1924 and 1925 Orangemen teams that were named national champions by USILA.Maiorana and Pitoniak, pp. 162, 165. In addition, he began the university's boxing team in 1925,Pitoniak, p. 163. and played baseball and basketball. Coaching career Simmons graduated from Syracuse in 1926.Fisher, p. 135. Post-graduation, he accepted an assistant coaching position for the Syracuse football team; he remained with that program for more than 40 years.Pitoniak, p. 58. In 1931, Simmons was named the head coach of the Orangemen.Pitoniak, p. 71. The first Syracuse team coached by Simmons was 7–4 in the 1931 season, ending the year with a four-game winning streak. The Orangemen had a 6–1–1 record in 1932. The following season, Simmons's Syracuse team played in the first box lacrosse game ever held between college teams, losing to Cornell. The match was part of an intermittent series of amateur indoor lacrosse games set up in the midst of the Great Depression. Simmons organized Rochester, New York-based commercial games of indoor lacrosse to pay for the lacrosse program's expenses, since Syracuse University had stopped its support of sports played in the spring.Fisher, p. 161. By 1934, the Orangemen had improved to 10–2. The team did not win more than seven games in any of the next nine seasons, but did not post more losses than wins until 1942, when the Orangemen went 3–4. During this period, Simmons's 1936 team had the best record, at 7–2. The 1942 team was coached by Simmons only in its first game; he left the team to enter the military and Fred Schermahorn guided the Orangemen in their remaining six games. Simmons joined the United States Navy in April 1942, and was an athletic instructor in Georgia until the war ended. After the 1943–1945 seasons were canceled because of World War II, he returned to coach Syracuse's lacrosse team in 1946. A university publication wrote of the post-war teams that they had \\"good seasons played before small crowds.\\"Galpin, Greene, Wilson and Barck, p. 193. After the Orangemen won 7 of 12 games in 1946, Simmons led the team to 10 wins in 1957 and 11 the following year. In 1949, the Orangemen were a two-point loss to Army away from going undefeated; their 14 wins were tied for the second-most in program history, equaling the total of the 1925 national championship-winning team. Syracuse went 11–2 in 1950, as that squad matched the prior year's team in having seven players selected as All- Americans. Four of his next five teams had six-win seasons, and the 1956 Orangemen were 8–5. The next season, the Orangemen featured four players who were named All-Americans, including Simmons's son, Roy Jr. The squad also featured Jim Brown, who went on to become the National Football League's all- time leading rusher at the time of his retirement. Simmons had played a role in recruiting Brown to Syracuse; after Brown was refused a football scholarship due to his skin color, Simmons provided money that he had left over for lacrosse recruiting, with other money provided by the track coach. According to Syracuse football alumnus Joe Ehrmann, Simmons was \\"one of the most instrumental men in [Brown's] life.\\"Ehrmann and Jordan, p. 54. The team finished with a perfect 10–0 record in 1957, and finished second in the national rankings behind Johns Hopkins. Syracuse's record declined to 6–3 in 1958, and the team's win total was halved the following season. From 1960 to 1965, the Orangemen won 6–7 games each season except for 1961, when they had wins in half of their eight games. After two straight years with more losses than wins, including a 1967 season in which the team had six freshman players ruled ineligible to play, Syracuse improved to 9–4 in 1968, and its 1969 total of 11 wins was the program's highest since 1950. Simmons Sr. left the program in 1970, and Roy Jr. was named his replacement. In his career, Simmons Sr.'s teams had a 253–130–1 record. Nine of his players, not including Roy Jr., have been inducted into the Lacrosse Hall of Fame, and he had 70 All-American players during his tenure.Maiorana and Pitoniak, pp. 162–163. Along with his lacrosse position, Simmons was a coach in multiple other sports at Syracuse. After organizing the school's boxing team in 1925, he became the coach and led the university to the 1936 national championship and 14 championships in the eastern region.Pitoniak, pp. 57–58. Seven boxers coached by Simmons won individual national championships. In recruiting fighters for Syracuse, he traveled to numerous northeastern gyms, and was said to prefer boxers without evident facial damage, as \\"that proved they knew how to dodge a blow.\\" Simmons served as boxing coach until 1955, when Syracuse ended the program. In addition, he became an assistant coach of the football team following his graduation, and remained with the program for 41 seasons. He was a coach on the 1959 team that won a national championship. Simmons became a member of the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1964. In 1994, he suffered a stroke that led to his death at the age of 92. The following year, Syracuse University built a coaches center that was named in his honor. Coaching style To recruit players for the Orangemen, Simmons often chose players from the existing body of students attending Syracuse. He supplemented his rosters with college football players who had finished their senior seasons and had no spring practice sessions. In practices, Simmons frequently had the Orangemen play against local Indian lacrosse teams. He said of Brown's lacrosse play, \\"Big Jim learned a lot from the Indians.\\" See also *List of college men's lacrosse coaches with 250 wins *List of National Lacrosse Hall of Fame members References Bibliography  * * Category:1901 births Category:1994 deaths Category:American men's basketball players Category:Sportspeople from Philadelphia Category:Syracuse Orangemen baseball players Category:Syracuse Orange boxers Category:Syracuse Orange boxing coaches Category:Syracuse Orange football coaches Category:Syracuse Orange football players Category:Syracuse Orange men's basketball players Category:Syracuse Orange men's lacrosse coaches Category:Syracuse Orange men's lacrosse players ","title":"Roy Simmons Sr."},{"id":"45304875","text":"Mao Xiaofeng (; born 1972) is a Chinese banking executive, best known for his tenure as a senior executive of Minsheng Banking Corp.

Career Mao was a child prodigy. Mao went to business school at Hunan University in Changsha and graduated in 1990 at age 18. He became the head of the student association at the university with the title of \\"Chairman\\", earning him the nickname \\"Chairman Mao\\". He then became assistant to the county governor of the Zhijiang Dong Autonomous County. He became deputy party secretary at age 23. While working at the county party organization, Mao earned an MBA from Hunan University, and then a doctorate several years later. In 1999, Mao was transferred to the Communist Youth League headquarters in Beijing, and became a member of its General Office. During his time at the Youth League he earned a Master of Public Administration degree at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.

Ling and Mao attended Hunan University's MBA program at around the same time, and Mao reportedly worked for Ling at the Communist Youth League. The Beijing News also reported that Mao had set up a so-called \\"wives club\\" at the bank, whereby the bank granted positions which \\"offered salaries for no work\\" to the wives of high officials, including Gu Liping, the wife of Ling Jihua, and Yu Lifang, the wife of Su Rong.

Subramaniam and Soobri) was a Tamil revolutionary and freedom fighter during the Indian Independence Movement. Early life Kovai Subri was born in Coimbatore in 1898. He was the fifth child of Parvathi and S.V.R. Krishna Iyer, an advocate in Coimbatore and was named Subramaniam, after the deity at Chennimalai. During his early years, Subri was drawn by the ideals of Gandhiji and decided to quit college to join the Indian Independence Movement. Freedom Struggle At the age of 23, Subri joined the Town Congress Committee in Coimbatore as the secretary in 1921. Shortly afterwards in 1923, he was imprisoned for a year for his participation in the Flag Satyagraha civil disobedience movement in Nagpur. In 1930 he joined the Salt Satyagraha. He was later imprisoned on five more occasions and spent a total of 5 years of his life in prison. He would later go on to start a Khadi centre at Padiyur village in Uthukuli. Gandhiji affectionately referred to Subri as 'The loudspeaker' for his commanding voice as his translator for his public speeches during his tour of the Coimbatore and Nilgiris Districts. Gandhiji in an article in the Young India writes about Subri- \\"young and old, men and women dote on him. The secret is his childlike innocence and his spirit of service. He is a jewel of a young man. I would do anything if only to please Soobri. \\". Noted freedom fighter T. S. Avinashilingam Chettiar regarded Subri as one of his closest associates in the freedom struggle and the background of the movement in Coimbatore district. Muruga Ganam During his years in prison, Subri composed a collection of 426 devotional songs named Muruga Ganam in praise of Lord Muruga. Muruga Ganam was first published in 1980, and a CD was later released by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan in 2011. Political career As a member of the Congress Party, Kovai Subri served as the Municipal Chairman of Coimbatore Municipality from 1938 to 1942. During his tenure, he was instrumental in creating the Gandhi Park in the RS Puram area of the city. He was later elected as the MLA of the Coimbatore City Constituency from 1947 to 1952. Subri later joined the Liberal Swatantra Party when it was launched by Rajaji in 1959. Personal life On 14 November 1926, at the age of 28, Subri married Kamala (Kamalammal), the daughter of A. Natesa Iyer an advocate-cum teacher from Pollachi. Kamala joined Subri in his acts of civil disobedience and was arrested in 1930 along with their six-month-old daughter.

The episode aired on February 8, 2015, on AMC in the United States. The episode was written by series creators Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, and directed by Gilligan. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries. The series mainly takes place in 2002, approximately six years prior to the title character Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) meeting Walter White (Bryan Cranston). In \\"Uno\\", Jimmy McGill (Saul), is a struggling lawyer working at the back of a nail salon. Jonathan Banks also reprises his role as Mike Ehrmantraut, a retired cop working as a parking lot security guard. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics, and it also broke the record for being the most-watched series premiere for a scripted series in U.S. cable history at the time, with 6.9 million viewers.  Plot  = Opening = Saul Goodman, now going by the name \\"Gene\\", is managing a Cinnabon at a shopping mall in Omaha, Nebraska. He has grown a mustache and is balding. He suspects that a customer recognizes him, but this proves to be incorrect. In his apartment that night, Saul watches a VHS tape of his old television advertisements. = Main story = In May 2002, James Morgan \\"Jimmy\\" McGill is a struggling public defender in Albuquerque, New Mexico. After representing three teenagers who broke into a morgue and had sex with a severed head, Jimmy is paid $700 for the defense, which he complains to be too little. Later, he gets a call from a prospective client, to whom he pretends to be his own mild- mannered British secretary. On his way out of the parking lot, Jimmy is stopped by Mike Ehrmantraut, the parking lot attendant, who refuses to let him exit without either a payment or a court-supplied parking sticker. Later that day, Jimmy meets at a diner with the prospective clients, county treasurer Craig Kettleman and his wife, Betsy, who are being investigated for the disappearance of county funds. They are hesitant to hire Jimmy, and when later trying to order them flowers while driving, Jimmy hits a man on a skateboard. The skateboarder's twin brother records the incident on a video camera and threatens to call the police unless Jimmy pays them hush money. Recognizing their ruse, Jimmy refuses to pay and leaves. Afterward, he returns to his \\"office\\" – the boiler room of a Vietnamese beauty salon, where he finds a check for $26,000 from Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM), his brother Chuck's law firm. Jimmy proceeds to tear the check into several pieces and later confronts the partners, accusing them of trying to cheat Chuck out of his rightful share of the partnership. On his way out of the HHM office, he sees the Kettlemans going in, which causes him to become agitated over losing a potentially lucrative client. Jimmy visits Chuck, who has had a mental breakdown and believes he has electromagnetic hypersensitivity. He requires visitors to leave their remote car door-opening keys and cellular phones in his mailbox and ground themselves before entering his house. He has no working lights or refrigerator and works from home by lantern on a manual typewriter. Chuck refuses a buyout and also suggests that Jimmy stop using the name \\"McGill\\" for his personal firm to avoid public confusion with HHM. Jimmy tracks down the two skateboarders, Cal and Lars Lindholm, and suggests a partnership, telling them how he got the nickname \\"Slippin' Jimmy\\" as a young man by faking \\"slip and falls\\" to get easy money. He arranges for one of them to be hit by a car driven by Betsy Kettleman, which will enable him to make another pitch to defend the Kettlemans on the embezzlement charge. Instead of stopping to check Cal's status after hitting him, the motorist just drives off. Cal and Lars give chase, but when the car stops, an elderly Hispanic woman exits. They try to get her to pay and follow her into her house. Jimmy arrives moments later to try and save them, trying to get in by referring to himself accurately but misleadingly as an \\"officer of the court\\", but is pulled into the house at gunpoint by Tuco Salamanca.  Production  Series co-creator Vince Gilligan, who also created predecessor Breaking Bad In July 2012, Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan hinted at a possible spin-off series focusing on Goodman. In April 2013, the series was confirmed to be in development by Gilligan and Gould; the latter wrote the Breaking Bad episode that introduced the character. In a July 2012 interview, Gilligan said he liked \\"the idea of a lawyer show in which the main lawyer will do anything it takes to stay out of a court of law\\" including settling on the courthouse steps. = Filming = The show is filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Breaking Bad was also shot. As filming began on June 2, 2014, concerns were expressed regarding the possible disappointment from the series' turnout, in terms of audience reception. On June 19, 2014, AMC announced it had renewed the series for a second season of 13 episodes to premiere in early 2016, with the first season to consist of 10 episodes, and that the series premiere had been delayed to early 2015. The first teaser trailer debuted on AMC on August 10, 2014, and confirmed its premiere date of February 2015. In the opening scene from the episode, Saul (now hiding his real identity under the Gene Takavic alias), is working at a Nebraska Cinnabon. This scene is set in Omaha, but it was filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, at the Cottonwood Mall. The scene is predominantly shown in black and white, except for a brief moment where a Saul Goodman commercial in color reflects on Gene's glasses.  Cultural references  As Jimmy barges in to a partner's meeting at HHM, he shouts \\"You have meddled with the primal forces of nature, Mr. Hamlin, and I won't have it!\\", paraphrasing a quote from the film Network. As Jimmy exits HHM's offices after arguing with the partners, he shouts \\"You Will Atone!\\" When no one understands the reference, he says \\"It’s Ned Beatty from Network. For Christ’s sake, guys.\\"  Reception  = Critical response = The episode received generally positive reviews and exceeded expectations. Erik Kain of Forbes said of the episode and series: \\"[It] isn't just a spin-off of a popular TV show. So far, it's a terrific TV show on its own merits. It covers familiar ground, but it still manages to be its own unique snowflake.\\" Hank Stuever of The Washington Post graded it a \\"B+\\" and wrote the series \\"is right in line with the tone and style of the original, now-classic series\\" and that it \\"raises more questions in two hours than it will readily answer\\". Stephen Marche of Esquire wrote that the first few episodes were better than Breaking Bad. Kirsten Acuna of Business Insider declared the initial episodes \\"everything you could possibly want from a spinoff television series\\". Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode an 8.7 out of 10, saying \\"Can Saul compete with Walter White? No. But he doesn't have to. Better Call Saul poses one simple, but fascinating question: What happened to Jimmy McGill that forced him to transform himself into the ruthless, hardened, yet entirely entertaining *criminal* lawyer Saul Goodman? The man that we came to know and love on Breaking Bad. I, for one, look forward to watching that story unfold.\\" Michael Star of The New York Post gave the episode a 3 out of 4 rating, saying: Some critics addressed skepticism prior to viewing the episode. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times said \\"It's common to dread a spinoff; some succeed, but plenty disappoint. There is absolutely no need to worry about this prequel to the Breaking Bad canon. Better Call Saul traces in loving, if corrosive, detail how Jimmy McGill, a debt-ridden, ambulance-chasing loser, changed his name to Saul Goodman and became a drug-lord consigliere. Better Call Saul is better than good: It's delightful—in a brutal, darkly comic way, of course.\\" Chris Jancelewicz of HuffPost gave the episode a highly favorable review despite his initial skepticism, saying: \\"It is so good, right from the get-go, that I almost feel ashamed for ever doubting creator/writer Vince Gilligan, his writers, and lead actor Bob Odenkirk (Saul). Better Call Saul is a return to the tried-and-true New Mexico environment, the sweeping shots of wide-sky desert mixed with strip-mall extravagance, the lushness juxtaposed with the dark comedy, which, as it was with Breaking Bad, both jarring and hilarious at the same time. You'll find yourself laughing in spite of yourself.\\" Robert Bianco of USA Today said \\"Face it: When AMC announced it had ordered a prequel to Breaking Bad, odds are many of us saw it as a callow move by a network bereft of new ideas to milk an old one for all it was worth. Well, we were right—but what we failed to factor in were the gifts star Bob Odenkirk and creators Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould would bring to Better Call Saul ... and their ability to transform what looked to be a sow's ear into something pretty much approaching a silk purse.\\" He ultimately gave the episode a 3.5 rating out of 4. One of few negative reviews came from Tony Wong of The Toronto Star, saying \\"It is beautifully and lovingly shot. It is funny and it is dark. But it's a lot to ask Bob Odenkirk to carry the show without help.\\" In her review of the series premiere, Mary McNamara of The Los Angeles Times summarized that \\"the beauty of Saul was his unflappable nature; no matter how dire or dreadful the circumstances, he was able to identify the next logical step and take it. Jimmy McGill doesn't know how to do that yet; Better Call Saul will show us how he learned.\\" = Ratings and accolades = Upon airing, the episode became the highest-rated series premiere for a scripted series in U.S. cable history up to that date, with 6.9 million viewers. The show placed second for the night among U.S. cable networks, behind only its lead-in show The Walking Dead, which as of February 9, 2015, ranks as the second-highest rated entertainment broadcast with adults 18–49 in the U.S., behind The Blacklist episode \\"Luther Braxton\\" which aired after Super Bowl XLIX. Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould won the Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Episodic Drama for this episode.

Written by series co-creator Peter Gould and directed by Michelle MacLaren, \\"Mijo\\" aired on AMC in the United States on February 9, 2015, one night after the series premiere. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries. The title refers to the Spanish term of endearment mijo , a contraction of mi hijo (\\"my son\\"). This episode marks the first appearance of Michael Mando (Nacho Varga). Plot Tuco Salamanca is preparing salsa in his kitchen when his grandmother returns after the run-in with Cal and Lars. Though they accidentally targeted the wrong driver, Cal and Lars follow her home and falsely claim serious injuries from their staged hit- and-run accident. They demand money from Tuco's grandmother and follow her into her house. Tuco sends his grandmother upstairs to her bedroom and then uses her cane to beat Cal and Lars unconscious. He arranges for Ignacio \\"Nacho\\" Varga, No-Doze and Gonzo to come with a van to pick up Cal and Lars. Jimmy McGill arrives searching for Cal and Lars, and Tuco answers the front door and drags him inside at gunpoint. Tuco questions Jimmy, who insists that Cal and Lars did not intentionally target Tuco's grandmother. Tuco allows Jimmy to see Cal and Lars, who are tied up in the basement, but when Jimmy removes the gag from one of them, he immediately implicates Jimmy in the phony hit and run scam. Tuco and his men take Jimmy, Cal and Lars to the desert and continue questioning Jimmy. Thinking quickly, Jimmy tells Tuco he's a lawyer, but when Tuco doesn't believe him and threatens to cut off a finger, Jimmy falsely claims he's an FBI agent. Nacho is suspicious and threatens Jimmy again, so Jimmy goes back to admitting the truth—he is a lawyer who intended to scam the Kettlemans. Nacho convinces Tuco this is the truth and that killing a lawyer would attract unwanted attention. Tuco frees Jimmy, but moves to kill Cal and Lars. Jimmy convinces Tuco to spare their lives and talks him into only breaking one leg each as punishment. After bringing Cal and Lars to a hospital, Jimmy meets a woman for a date at a bar. A customer's snapping breadsticks reminds Jimmy of the broken legs Cal and Lars suffered, so he excuses himself and vomits in the bathroom. An intoxicated Jimmy later arrives at Chuck's house and forgets to leave his cellular phone in the mailbox before collapsing on the couch. Due to Chuck's electromagnetic hypersensitivity, he throws Jimmy's cell phone into the yard. The following morning, Chuck admits to seeing the brothers' hospital bill. Jimmy reassures Chuck that he is not going back to the \\"Slippin' Jimmy\\" cons he used to run. After several days in court, Jimmy returns to his office and sees that he has no messages. One of the beauty salon employees tells him a client has arrived—Nacho. Nacho tells Jimmy he wants to take the $1.6 million stolen by the Kettlemans, for which he will pay Jimmy a finder's fee. Jimmy insists he is a lawyer, not a criminal. Nacho writes his number on one of Jimmy's matchbooks and tells Jimmy to let him know when Jimmy figures out he is \\"in the game\\". Production The episode was written by series co-creator and executive producer Peter Gould, who originally wrote the episode that introduced Saul Goodman in the second season of Breaking Bad. It was directed by Michelle MacLaren, the most prolific director for Breaking Bad, directing 11 episodes and also served as an executive producer. Cultural references During the episode, there is a montage in which Jimmy's routine is revealed: Grabbing his coffee, defending clients, collecting his check, and his ongoing battle with the parking attendant, Mike. During his routine he always looks in the mirror as states, “It’s showtime, folks!” a line from Bob Fosse's All That Jazz. All That Jazz is about a director and choreographer trying to balance out his work and personal life. The use of the particular line “It’s showtime, folks!” emphasizes the concept that Jimmy views this as a performance. Reception Upon moving to its regular Monday slot, the episode received 3.4 million viewers and a 1.6 rating among adults 18–49 in the United States. This equated to a 50 percent drop in viewers, along with a 52 percent decline in the demographic. The episode received positive reviews from critics. Erik Kain of Forbes said that despite hating the long and drawn-out restaurant scene, the overall episode was good. Despite this he felt that he wasn't \\"sitting nearly as close to the edge of my seat [as in Breaking Bad]—but it's entertaining and funny and still beautifully shot, acted, and written.\\" David Segal of The New York Times, in a positive review, noted that his favourite part of the episode \\"is the elaborate, jaunty montage of Jimmy at court, which pays tribute to the elaborate, jaunty montage in Bob Fosse's All That Jazz, complete with the same Vivaldi concerto and \\"It's showtime!\\" catchphrase. Catherine Gee of The Telegraph gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars, saying: Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode a 9 out of 10, saying \\"Better Call Saul hit the ground running with its second episode; setting the stage for a series that is part morality play, part Greek tragedy (replete with a foregone and less than savory conclusion) and part love letter to great performers—whatever walk of life they happen to be on.\\" Richard Vine of The Guardian was also positive in his view. In particular he felt that \\"The best thing to come out of the desert is our introduction to Nacho Varga. Tuco's far more reasonable associate has sized up the situation and tracked Jimmy down to his \\"office\\"\\". The Atlantic named \\"Mijo\\" one of the best television episodes of 2015.

The episode aired on February 16, 2015, on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries.  Plot  = Opening = In a flashback, Chuck meets Jimmy in the Cook County Jail, where Jimmy has been imprisoned for unspecified offenses which risk having him labelled as a sex offender. Chuck warns Jimmy that his life will be ruined if he's convicted, and Jimmy pleads with Chuck to help get the charges dismissed. Chuck agrees to represent Jimmy on the condition that he stop running cons and find legitimate employment. = Main story = Jimmy is anxious about Nacho's plot to extort the Kettlemans. He calls Kim Wexler, a friend at HHM, which represents the Kettlemans. Jimmy indirectly warns Kim about the potential danger to the Kettlemans, but then breaks off the call, insisting that he is \\"no hero.\\" Later that night, Jimmy calls the Kettlemans anonymously and warns them. The Kettlemans look outside and see somebody in a parked van watching them. The next morning, Kim tells Jimmy that something has happened to the Kettlemans. He rushes to their house to find it surrounded by police, and finds out the Kettlemans, including their two children, are missing. Believing that Nacho has kidnapped them, Jimmy tries to call Nacho, but receives only his voicemail greeting. While waiting for Nacho to call back, Jimmy is picked up by the police, who tell him they have arrested Nacho on suspicion of kidnapping the Kettlemans, and he has requested Jimmy as his legal counsel. At the police station, Nacho admits to Jimmy that he performed surveillance on the Kettlemans but denies kidnapping them. Nacho warns Jimmy that if he does not get the charges dropped, Nacho will have him killed. Jimmy is unsuccessful at persuading the police to release Nacho, but convinces Kim to take him to the Kettleman house so he can investigate. Jimmy notices some inconsistencies, such as a missing child's doll, and theorizes that the Kettlemans staged their kidnapping. Jimmy admits to Kim that he warned the Kettlemans about Nacho and probably drove them into hiding. At the courthouse, Jimmy starts a fight with Mike, who subdues him. The police ask Mike to press assault charges against Jimmy so that they can leverage him to testify against Nacho. Mike takes Jimmy's side and refuses to press charges. He suggests that Jimmy's theory about the Kettlemans' disappearance is correct. He recounts a similar case he investigated as a Philadelphia police officer, and tells Jimmy that the Kettlemans are probably hiding somewhere close to home. With the new lead, Jimmy explores the desert near the Kettleman house and finds their campsite. He confronts the Kettlemans, gets into a struggle with them, and inadvertently discovers the stolen money.  Production  The episode was written by co-executive producer Thomas Schnauz, who was also a writer and producer on Breaking Bad. It was directed by Terry McDonough, who directed episodes for Breaking Bad, including the episode that introduced Saul Goodman.  Reception  Upon airing, the episode received 3.23 million American viewers, and an 18-49 rating of 1.6. The episode received positive reviews from critics. Erik Kain of Forbes said that \\"Overall, this was yet another strong entry in the show. Great shots of New Mexico, plenty of humor, and a little bit of mystery all kept this one humming from start to finish.\\" Michael Hogan of The Telegraph gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars, concluding: Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode 8.5 out of 10, saying \\"Better Call Saul continues to settle into itself, as Jimmy McGill's will to do the right thing is tested.\\"\\" Richard Vine of The Guardian also gave a positive review, and was pleased that the episode began to examine Jimmy's relationships with Chuck and Kim, who \\"you really get the sense that she’s fond of him, against her better judgement\\".

Plot  = Opening = In a flashback, Jimmy and Stevie leave a bar. As they enter an alley, Jimmy tells his companion that his name is Saul Goodman. In the alley, they discover a wallet with cash next to a barely conscious drunk man. Stevie takes the cash, and Jimmy takes the man's Rolex watch. Jimmy estimates it to be worth more than the wallet, leading Stevie to trade the found money plus some additional cash of his own in exchange for the watch. After Stevie runs away with the watch, a cheap counterfeit, Jimmy and the \\"unconscious\\" man return to Jimmy's residence to congratulate each other and split the proceeds of their scam. = Main story = Jimmy gives the Kettlemans the option of hiring him as their lawyer, but they refuse. The Kettlemans instead offer Jimmy a bribe if he does not reveal that they stole the $1.6 million, and he accepts. Nacho is released from police custody and accuses Jimmy of warning the Kettlemans, for which Nacho says Jimmy will face \\"consequences\\". Jimmy says he warned the family only for the sake of the children, and that Nacho should be grateful that the warning prevented Nacho from committing kidnapping or murder, for which he probably would have been charged, since he was noticed while conducting surveillance on the Kettleman home. In his office at the nail salon, Jimmy cooks his books to make it look like the bribe he took from the Kettlemans is legitimate payment for his services. He spends the money on a personal makeover and a billboard advertisement which shares obvious similarities with Hamlin Hamlin & McGill. Kim confronts Jimmy over the imitation, and Howard Hamlin sues him for trademark infringement. The court rules in HHM's favor, and Jimmy is ordered to remove the billboard within 48 hours. After failing to persuade any news outlets to cover his predicament as a human interest story, Jimmy hires a freelance media team to record his video plea for sympathy. During filming, the worker removing the billboard slips and falls, and is held up only by his safety harness. Jimmy climbs up and pulls the worker to safety while passersby watch and record, as does his media team. It is revealed that the accident was staged by Jimmy as a publicity stunt, which Howard and Kim see through when they watch it on the television news. The stunt works, and Jimmy acquires numerous new clients. Jimmy visits Chuck and brings him his newspapers, but hides the local one that includes a report on the \\"rescue\\". Chuck congratulates Jimmy on his newfound success, but becomes suspicious when he notices his local paper is missing. Jimmy dismisses it as meaningless, but after he leaves, a suspicious Chuck braves exposure to electricity to run to his neighbor's driveway and steal their newspaper (leaving a $5 bill as payment), which leads to his discovery of Jimmy's scam.  Production  The episode was written by supervising producer Gennifer Hutchison, who was also a writer and producer on Breaking Bad. It was directed by Colin Bucksey, who directed four episodes of Breaking Bad. This is the first episode chronologically in which the name Saul Goodman is used.  Reception  Upon airing, the episode received 2.87 million American viewers, and an 18-49 rating of 1.4. The episode received positive reception from critics.

A Southern Unionist, he commanded the Union Army's First Tennessee Infantry during the Civil War, and saw action at Cumberland Gap, Stones River, and in the Knoxville and Atlanta campaigns. He represented his native Roane County at the pro-Union East Tennessee Convention on the eve of the war in 1861, and at the Nashville convention that reorganized the Tennessee state government toward the end of the war in January 1865. Byrd served one term (1879-1881) in the Tennessee Senate, and unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Party's nomination for governor in 1880. He was a persistent advocate for railroad construction and navigational improvements to the Tennessee River during the two decades following the war. Early life and career Byrd was born in Roane County, the son of Joseph and Ann (Pride) Byrd. The Byrds were one of the more prominent families in the county. Jesse Byrd, Robert's grandfather, established a ferry at Kingston in the 1790s, when Fort Southwest Point was still in operation. Joseph Byrd was a major landowner and county sheriff.Goodspeed's History of Roane County, 1886. Accessed at the Roane County Heritage Commission website, 1 February 2015. Robert K. Byrd fought in the Mexican–American War as a First Lieutenant in Company C of the 4th Tennessee Infantry.Roger D. Hunt, \\"Robert King Byrd,\\" Colonels in Blue- Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee: A Civil War Biographical Dictionary (McFarland, 2013), p. 201. During the 1850s, he engaged in farming, and promoted railroad construction. In 1853, he was appointed to a seven-man commission tasked with fundraising and surveying a route for the proposed South Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky Railroad.\\"Rail Road Meeting,\\" Loudon Free Press, 10 June 1853, p. 2.\\"Meeting of the Directory of the S.C., Tenn. and Ky.

Civil War Although a slaveholder, Byrd, like many East Tennesseans, remained loyal to the Union during the Civil War. He was a member of the Roane County delegation at both the Knoxville and Greeneville sessions of the East Tennessee Convention in mid-1861. At the latter session, he also served as a proxy delegate for Cumberland County, and represented that county on the convention's powerful business committee. While in Greeneville, Byrd made a secret pact with several other convention delegates, including Joseph A. Cooper and Richard M. Edwards, to return to their respective homes and begin raising and drilling military units to provide for the region's defense.Oliver Perry Temple, Mary Boyce Temple (ed.), \\"Robert K. Byrd,\\" Notable Men of Tennessee (Cosmopolitan Press, 1912), pp. 79-81. In August 1861, Byrd's father-in-law, James Lea, became one of several Unionists elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives.Mary C. Bell, , February 2006, Sec. 8, p. 5. Byrd fled to Kentucky in August 1861, and was mustered into the Union Army as a colonel on September 1 of that year, in command of the First Tennessee Volunteer Infantry. This unit was the first Union regiment of the war composed primarily of refugees from East Tennessee. During the first half of 1862, the First Tennessee was involved in numerous skirmishes in the Cumberland Gap area, and was present at the Battle of Mill Springs. In February 1862, Byrd suffered a wound that left him incapacitated for a month. After withdrawing northward with Union forces to the Ohio River in September 1862, the First Tennessee was reassigned to the Army of the Cumberland.Civil War Centennial Commission of Tennessee, \\"1st Tennessee Volunteer Infantry Regiment, USA,\\" Tennessee & the Civil War, Vol. 1. Accessed at TNGenWeb.org, 31 January 2015. Byrd's unit was in Nashville by the time the Battle of Stones River began on December 31, 1862, and helped escort supplies from Nashville to the Union front in Murfreesboro. Toward the end of the battle, Byrd led an attack that drove a force of Confederate soldiers out of a patch of woods near the front lines, and was singled out for distinction by the brigade commander, General James G. Spears. During operations in the aftermath of the battle on January 5, 1863, Byrd led a \\"fearless charge\\" that drove three Confederate regiments from their position along a road outside of Murfreesboro. In May 1863, the First Tennessee was mounted and redesignated the \\"First Tennessee Mounted Infantry,\\" commonly called \\"Byrd's mounted men.\\" In June of that year, the unit joined a raid led by Colonel William P. Sanders that destroyed railroad lines and bridges in the areas around Knoxville. Sanders credited Byrd's knowledge of the area with the raid's success. During the Knoxville Campaign in late 1863, Byrd and his unit were posted in his home town of Kingston. They took part in several skirmishes during the campaign, including one at Mossy Creek in Jefferson County in December 1863. In May 1864, the First Tennessee was dismounted and ordered to the front lines in Georgia. The unit engaged in action near Lost Mountain in June 1864, and along the Chattahoochee River in July of the same year. In August, the unit's three-year period of service ended, and it was ordered to Knoxville to be mustered out. General John Schofield praised the First Tennessee as the \\"first among the patriotic men from East Tennessee to take up arms in defense of the Union,\\" and tendered a \\"soldier's appreciation and regard for soldierly fidelity and gallantry\\" to Byrd and his officers. Byrd and his men fought one final skirmish in Athens, Tennessee, en route to Knoxville, on August 17, 1864. Byrd served as an interim commander of the Third Brigade (Third Division) on two occasions: the first from August to December 17, 1863, and the second from June 17 to August 9, 1864. Postwar endeavors Byrd served on the state executive committee for the Unconditional Unionist party in 1864. In January 1865, he represented Roane County at the convention in Nashville that reorganized the state government. This convention ordered elections to be held in March, and called for an amendment outlawing slavery.Knoxville Whig and Rebel Ventilator, 28 September 1864, p. 2.\\"Union State Convention,\\" Nashville Daily Union, 10 January 1865, p. 2. In August 1865, Byrd ran for the 2nd district seat in Congress.

He studied Law in the Central University of Professional Studies (Spanish: Universidad Central Dominicana de Estudios Profesionales). He is known as a lecturer on topics pertaining history and society, and for developing projects for the restoration of historic buildings in the country. Military career From 2000 to 2003, he served as Commander of the First Dominican Regime of the Presidential Guard, where he excelled at contributing with the educational growth of the country. In 2003, he became Chief of Staff of the Dominican Army.

In September 2009 the Civic Renovation Party is recognized as a political party by the resolution no. 18-2009 with which he is presented as a Presidential candidate. Jorge Radhamés Zorrilla Ozuna participates in the presidential elections of 2012, in the Purple Aliance (Spanish: Alianza Morada), supporting Danilo Medina, who won the presidential election of Dominican Republic in 2012. In 2012 the Progressive Renovator Pact (Spanish: Pacto Progresista Renovador) was signed between members of the Dominican Liberation Party (including Leonel Fernández Reyna President of the Party and of Dominican Republic in that moment, Danilo Medina, and Reinaldo Pared Pérez) and members of the Civic Renovation Party (its President Jorge Radhamés Zorrilla Ozuna and the General Secretary, Franklin White Coplin).

Inclusion of Military Vote in Dominican Republic On June 1, 2015, Jorge Radhamés Zorrilla Ozuna proposed the inclusion of the military vote in the constitutional reform of Dominican Republic, to be effective on the elections of 2016. This reform has as core purpose to create the universal suffrage in the country, defend the vote as a fundamental right, strengthen Dominican democracy, and give Dominican military and policemen the right to vote, as every citizen is entitled to, according to the article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Only 4 countries of the 35 that form the Americas and the Caribbean, including Dominican Republic, Colombia, Honduras, and Guatemala, prohibit military voting rights. For this reason, this proposal will have national transcendence, as it will benefit around 90,000 members of order and security forces in Dominican Republic. As part of this proposal, it is established that the constitutional mandate must prohibit military and policemen to get involved in any political activity, to guarantee that they remain as guarantor of democracy and won´t destabilize the democratic process of the Dominican nation.

Background In 230, the state of Wei constructed a new fortress at Hefei to defend against its rival state of Wu. The fortress is referred to as \\"Xincheng\\" (新城; literally: \\"new city/fortress\\"). The battle In 231, the Wu emperor Sun Quan led an army to attack Xincheng. Man Chong wrote to the Wei emperor Cao Rui to summon soldiers from Yan and Yu provinces to help defend Xincheng. Shortly after the troops arrived, Sun Quan retreated without attacking Xincheng. One of Cao Rui's advisers, Xu Xuan, warned that this was their plan all along and that as soon as the troops were dispersed, Sun Quan would attack again. After about ten days, Sun Quan returned to besiege Xincheng but Man Chong was fully prepared and easily repelled the assault.Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian Shibu vol. 4. Later, Sun Quan realised that he cannot take Xincheng by force, so he decided that since he had so much success with Zhou Fang's false defection at Battle of Shiting, he would try exactly the same thing again. Sun Quan ordered his relative Sun Bu to pretend to defect to Wei in order to lure the Wei-appointed Governor of Yang Province, Wang Ling, into a trap. Sun Quan set soldiers in ambush at Fuling. Sun Bu asked Wang Ling to send soldiers to take him to Wei. Wang Ling, in turn, requested permission from his superiors to do so. One of those superiors was Man Chong, who did not believe that Sun Bu's defection was true. Man Chong sent a letter (on behalf of Wang Ling) to Sun Bu saying that he was very pleased to hear that Sun Bu wanted to defect. He said, however, that he feared that if he sent too few troops, Sun Bu would not be protected and if he sent too many it would attract undue attention. Finally, he urged Sun Bu to think of some way to flee from Sun Quan quietly. At this time, Cao Rui had summoned Man Chong to meet him. Before leaving to meet the Wei emperor, Man Chong ordered his chief clerk not to give Wang Ling soldiers with which to receive Sun Bu. Wang Ling could not obtain a large number of troops and so was able to send only a very small force to Sun Bu. They were ambushed and defeated, but due to Man Chong's foresight, the loss was negligible. and Sun Quan's strategy to eliminate the Wei forces in Hefei failed.Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian Shibu vol. 5.  Aftermath  Man Chong was summoned to the Wei imperial court. This was due to a memorial issued by Wang Ling, who evidently did not get along well with his superior. Wang Ling accused Man Chong of being too old and too fond of wine to be such an important administrator. Cao Rui summoned Man Chong so that he could judge for himself. When he met Man Chong, Cao Rui determined that he was perfectly fit for his work and thus allowed Man Chong to resume his duties at Xincheng.Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian Shibu vol. 4.

The organization was formed in 2011 to organize gun lobby groups to legally oppose some forms gun legislation in Florida. In 2011, the organization successfully supported a bill that allowed out-of-state purchases of long guns. In 2012, they supported a successful bill that allowed honorably discharged veterans to obtain a gun license regardless of age. In 2013, the group opposed a bill that would have required anger management classes for ammunition buyers. In 2014, the group supported a bill that would have allowed citizens to transport unlicensed guns in their vehicles during evacuations. This bill failed to pass. In the same year they successfully lobbied for a bill that allowed legal immunity to people who used a gun for self-defence during a crime. History Florida Carry, Inc. was formed in 2011 in order to better coordinate the activities of some gun rights advocates and to provide a legal entity capable of lobbying the state legislature and file legal challenges in state and federal courts. Legislative activity Florida Carry has actively lobbied the Florida Legislature and Governor on self-defense, firearms, and defensive weapons related topics. =2011 Session= During the 2011 Florida Legislative Session Florida Carry's legislative work focused on the legalization of Open Carry and amending Florida's 1987 Firearms Preemption Statute to create a private right of action against state actors who violate the law. HB 517 and its companion bill, SB 234, initially provided for the licensed Open Carry of firearms, licensed carry of firearms and defensive weapons on college and university campuses, storage of firearms in private vehicles, the out of state purchase of Long Guns, and Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services finger printing services for concealed weapons and firearms license applications. Opposed by the Florida Retail Federation and the Florida Sheriffs Association, the bills passed without the Open Carry and Campus Carry provisions. HB 45 and its companion bill, SB 402, provided for Firearms Preemption law enforceability and expansion of the preemption to include substantially all state and local government agencies of Florida. The amended law provides penalties for government officials who knowingly & willfully violate Florida's Firearms Preemption Statute, allows for the collection of attorney's fees, fines, and damages. HB 45 Passed and became effective October 1, 2011. =2012 Session= In 2012 Florida Carry's lobbying efforts centered on the passage of HB 463 and SB 998. The bills provided for concealed carry licensure of current military service members and honorably discharged veterans to obtain a license to carry regardless of age or duty station. The bill also requires that fingerprint cards be accepted from military police and provost so that service members stationed overseas can complete their applications. The bills passed the Florida House and Senate unanimously. =2013 Session= The group opposed a Florida bill that would have required anger management courses for ammunition buyers. =2014 Session= During the 2014 Florida Legislative Session Florida Carry supported SB 296 in an attempt to create exceptions to criminal penalties for carrying or transporting firearms in public, with or without a license, during mandatory evacuations. Opposed by the Florida Sheriffs Association, the bill failed to pass. Florida Carry also supported changes to Florida's self-defense laws to allow immunity from prosecution or civil action for the threatened use of force in response to a criminal attack, an exception to mandatory minimum sentencing laws in cases of imperfect self-defense with a firearm, expungement of arrest records in cases of lawful self-defense. Despite the opposition of the Florida Sheriffs Association and state prosecutors, HB 89 became law on June 20, 2014.http://legalinsurrection.com/2014/01/florida-warning-shot-bill- advances/ References Category:Gun rights advocacy groups in the United States Category:Non-profit organizations based in Florida Category:Organizations established in 2011 ","title":"Florida Carry"},{"id":"45305735","text":"Full Spectrum is a series of five anthologies of fantasy and science fiction short stories published between 1988 and 1995 by Bantam Spectra.

Critical reception No Clean Singing's reviewer states:\\"Powerful? Yes. Majestic? You bet your ass. One of the best of the year? Top shelf, grade-A, top-10-of-the-year list in the making. Buy this album. You won’t regret it. 'Within the throes of absolution, I shed my humanity.

Altogether, Throes of Absolution is an album that always hints at greatness but never quite reaches it. For every moment that feels measured and well-constructed, there’s another that comes across as superfluous or even uninspiring. However, in those glorious moments where everything lines up so perfectly, this band shows buckets of potential – more so than any new band I’ve heard this year. Mark my words, barring drastic line up changes or a nuclear apocalypse, the next 7 Horns 7 Eyes album will be spectacular. T.S. Elliot of Indie Vision Music wrote:\\"Overall: With Throes of Absolution, every member of 7 Horns 7 Eyes does his part to achieve the honorable, mouthful labeling of “progressive atmospheric technical death metal.” The drums, guitars, bass and death growls create a very distinct atmosphere that makes for a pleasant and refreshing listen. There’s not as much vocal variation as I think the album deserves, but that’s a miniature issue—Throes of Absolution is a musical masterpiece that was worth waiting for.\\" Track listing Credits 7 Horns 7 Eyes * JJ Polachek - vocals * Aaron Smith - rhythm guitar, producer, engineer, mixing, programming * Sean Alf - lead guitar * Brandon Smith - bass guitar * Ryan Wood - drums, percussion Additional musicians * Jeff Loomis - guest guitar solo on track 9 Production * Travis Smith - artwork, design concept * Daniel Zetterstrom - photography References External links *Albums That Will #%*$ Your Face Off In 2012: 7 Horns 7 Eyes - Throes Of Absolution Category:2012 debut albums Category:7 Horns 7 Eyes albums Category:Century Media Records albums ","title":"Throes of Absolution"},{"id":"45305880","title":"Tanduqiao station"},{"id":"45305888","text":"Ilkka A.

History The religious procession of the feast of Nossa Senhora da Guia at the turn of the century A view of the people congregating along the roadway during a popular feast Owing to the abundant sources of water, resulting from large waterfalls, and the extraordinary microclimate, the fajã was permanently inhabited from 1550 to 1560. The micro-climate permitted the cultivation of vineyards and fruits, such as figs, walnuts, oranges, apples, chestnuts and pineapples, including limited production of coffee beans. The small hermitage was constructed around 1550, to satisfy the vows of Father Diogo de Matos da Silveira, who wanted to a religious temple for the small community. In 1625, Barbary coast pirates attacked this part of the coast, resulting in their capture of several of the early inhabitants, who were sent as captives to North Africa. As a result of this incident, a small fort was constructed near the port, but this did not limit future incursions. In 1686, pirates from Salé disembarked, without a shot being fired from the fort. These privateers preceded to demolish the fort and sacked the homes and hermitage, destroying an image of St. John that existed at the site. During the famed Mandado de Deus (Sent by God) earthquake, much of the resident population was lost under landslides (its effects are still visible along the coast). Reconstructed, it was hit again during the 1 January 1980 earthquake resulting in further destruction to the small population. The fajã was used by several noble or rich families as their summer residences. Many of these families, such as the Noronhas, were owners of great properties, produced wine and sealed them in barrels, which were transported to Terceira. The Noronhas produced their wines and sent those barrels to their manorhouse in Villa Maria, then residence of José Pimentel Homem de Noronha (and his father the morgado João Inácio de Bettencourt Noronha), where they bottled and commercially sold their products. Today, the fajã is an important producer of Jaquê wine, in addition to spirits, such as loquat and fig aguardiente. Although an insignificant contributor to the local economy, coffee beans were cultivated in the fajã intermittently. Geography A view of the location of the fajã in the shadow of the steep escarpments of the Volcanic Complex of Topo Fajã of São João is situated on the southern coast of São Jorge, along a strip of land in the shadow of the Topo Volcanic Complex. Although there are seven permanent residents, during the months of August and September, there is an influx of former-residents, in addition to visiting emigrants and tourists, who swell the population of the fajã. Economy It is primarily recognized for its local café and the quality of its handicrafts, including blankets and quilts. Culture The local hermitage, dedicated to the local patron saint (John the Baptist) was constructed in 1550, although its frontispiece suggests a date of 1762 (which refers to a period of restoration). The central spire was only added in 1895, but this iconic facade has made it one of the most photographed religious buildings on the island. As part of its cultural tradition, two major feasts occur annually: the feast of St. John (on 24 June) and the feast dedicated to Nossa Senhora da Guia (on 8 September).

The buildings were sold out of the Catholic church in 1976, and were redeveloped as residential flats in 2005. The main building is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building, while the boundary walls on the west side are Grade II listed. The main building was begun in 1772, as a free hospital for the poor, but funding ran out two years later, and it was completed as a private residence. In the early 19th century, it was bought by a group of Franciscan nuns, who moved from an unsatisfactory site in Winchester. The nuns carried out a number of additions and extensions to the building to make it more suitable for their needs. They moved out of Taunton in 1950 and sold the convent to the Sisters of St. Joseph, who continued to run a school on the site for the next twenty-six years. History Originally, the site was intended to be a hospital; on the first stone, which was laid in September 1772, the engraving describes the building as \\"a general hospital, for the relief of the sick poor.\\" That foundation stone was laid by Frederick North, Lord North, the British Prime Minister at the time. In 1774, the building work stopped when funds ran out, and shortly after it was sold to recover the debts incurred from building it. The building was eventually completed as a personal residence, and came into the hands of James Coles. Upon his death, the house, known as Taunton Lodge, was put up for sale. This was brought to the attention of a group of Franciscan nuns.Trappes-Lomax (1922), pp. 99–103. The nuns had left Bruges in Belgium, and arrived in England in 1794 to avoid persecution during the French Revolution. They initially settled in Winchester, but the buildings they utilised there were not suitable for their permanent use, and in October 1806, they were ordered to look for somewhere else to establish themselves.Trappes-Lomax (1922), pp. 99–100. Mr Knight of Cannington alerted the nuns to the sale of Taunton Lodge, and they raised the £3,150 required to purchase it. They completed the purchase in early May 1807, after some minor quibbles with the Coles family. When the abbess visited the Lodge prior to the purchase, she had identified that it would require £1,000 worth of improvements in addition to the money already spent on its acquisition. The plans included extending the existing building to gain a staircase and some dormitories for the school girls, and the addition of a new wing that would include a chapel, infirmary, four cells, and rooms for the male chaplain and servants. The new building was begun in March 1808, and by June of that year, the entire community had moved from Winchester, despite the work being ongoing. The shell of the new body was completed by the autumn of 1808, but the work was delayed due to a lack of finances as £1,908 had already been spent on altering the old building. This cost did not include the erection of the new wing, thus the constructions costs were already far surpassing the original estimate.Trappes-Lomax (1922), p. 106. Within two years of being built, the roof on the new wing had to be replaced as it had started sinking; the joists \\"were made of bad wood & put in the wrong way\\". It was too close to winter in 1810 for the work to be completed that year, and it had to be left until the following spring. The wing was completed, with replacement roof, by January 1812, at a total cost of just over £2,230.Trappes-Lomax (1922), pp. 107–9. A storm in 1818 damaged the roof in the original building, and on inspection it was found that the whole roof should be replaced; this was completed by September of the same year.Trappes-Lomax (1922), p. 112. St George's Rectory on land donated by the convent in 1858 The convent continued to be significantly expanded over the next twenty years, and in 1858 the Franciscans purchased a plot of land adjacent to the convent for the erection of a church, rectory and school. This was gifted to the local Bishop, and St George's Church was opened on the site two years later. In 1950, the Franciscans sold the convent buildings to the Sisters of St. Joseph of Annecy. The latter had been in Taunton since the 1920s, running St George's School, and upon purchasing the convent, set up St Joseph's Convent School, which catered for boys and girls up to the age of 11, and girls on to 18. That school continued to operate until 1976, when the property was bought by the nearby King's College, who used it as accommodation for their boarding students. In 2005, the building complex was converted to \\"high quality\\" residential flats. =1809 miracle= In March 1809 a miracle was reported as occurring at the convent. It is recorded that one of the nuns, Sister Mary Ann Wood, sustained a deep cut across her arm while opening a sash window. She was attended by a local surgeon, who judged that the muscles, and most of the tendons had been severed. The wound healed over after three weeks, but she continued to suffer sharp pain for four months. During all this time, she was not able to use her hand or arm, and despite attempting a variety of different methods to repair the broken tendons, the doctor eventually declared that she may regain use of her forefinger and thumb, but not the rest of her fingers. By this time, her arm and hand had withered, and Sister Mary Ann decided to make a novena (nine prayers) to Saint Winifred. She began her prayers on 6 August, and placed a piece of moss on her arm; she said that she felt intense pain, and considered removing the moss, but opted not to. The following morning, she awoke, and her hand and arm were returned to full strength. The surgeon who had been tending to her was said to have \\"at first declared the case a miracle; but human respect prevented him from publicly attesting it.\\" The Right Reverend Peter Collingridge, Vicar Apostolic of the Western District, after consulting a Catholic surgeon in London, declared \\"that the cure was supernatural and an evident miracle.\\"Trappes-Lomax (1922), p. 110–11. =1851 case of Augusta Talbot= In 1851, the House of Commons was petitioned by Craven Berkeley, who had previously sat as the member of parliament for Cheltenham. He claimed that his step-daughter, Augusta Talbot, had been forced to join the Franciscan Convent in Taunton as a postulant (the first stage to become a nun), rather than a pupil. Her father had died in 1839 and then her mother, after remarrying, died in 1841, and with the subsequent death of her brother, she was due to inherit £80,000. After the death of her mother, Talbot had been placed in the care of Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury, her father's half-brother. Berkeley alleged that the Shrewsburys first attempted to marry her to François VII de La Rochefoucauld, and then when she refused, placed her at the Taunton convent against her will. The allegation followed that when Talbot became a nun, her inheritance, which was due to her in June 1852, would become property of the convent, or the greater Catholic church. Berkeley also protested that he and his daughter were not allowed to communicate with Talbot, though Thomas Wilde, 1st Baron Truro, the Lord Chancellor, noted that Berkeley had not tried to see Talbot for nine years. Lord Truro contacted Talbot, who stated that she was not a postulant, and she was amenable to his plans to remove her from the convent and place her in the care of a new guardian in London. He duly did so, and rejected Berkeley's petition, upon the basis of his previous lack of contact with Talbot. Architecture The buildings The main building is a symmetrical three-storey house built of red brick, with a yellow brick central range which was added later. The building has a cornice and parapet, and a bowed end which projects to the east. On the south side, there is an additional attic storey. The house retains its original sash windows, and on the first floor some of the windows have wrought-iron balconettes. An addition to the building has been made in the south-west, including an arcade on the ground floor, and a bell tower. Further additions were made to the main building in the 19th century, including a Gothic chapel of red brick with ashlar dressings to the north. There are later buildings on either side of the chapel: to the west is a 19th-century building with a two-storey entrance porch, while a Gothic cloister, comprising two walks with scissor-trussed timber roofs, lies to the east. There is a further extension to the south, which is not part of the Grade II* listing. A summerhouse was added to the grounds, probably alongside the 19th-century additions to the main building. It was constructed of red and white brick, and had a steep slate roof. The east side displayed a crucifix. The building was Grade II listed in July 1975, but has since been demolished. The stone walls around the site are Grade II listed where they are the original \\"high stone rubble wall with brick capping\\"; in other places they have been renovated in newer red brick.

He was born in Burton-on- Trent, Staffordshire and died at Headingley, Leeds, Yorkshire. The son of a brewer, Robinson was educated at Appleby Grammar School near Atherstone in Warwickshire and at St John's College, Cambridge. In his first year at Cambridge University he appears not to have played rugby, but he was chosen for the freshmen's match cricket trial, and scored 11 and 58, batting in the lower-order. But he was not then given any first-team games in that or the subsequent two seasons. From 1892, he played first-team rugby for the Cambridge rugby team regularly and he was awarded a Blue in both 1892 and 1893, playing in the annual Varsity Match against Oxford. He returned to cricket in 1893, finally playing a single first-class game for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against the university side, a ploy sometimes used by Cambridge to try out new players; he scored 15 and 12 not out but still did not earn a call-up to the university side. In 1894, however, he was tried in an early match for the university team as an opening bowler and proceeded to take seven wickets for 93 runs in the first innings he bowled in: these remained his career best bowling figures. He then retained his place as a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm opening bowler to the end of the university season, and appeared in the University Match against Oxford University, thereby becoming a \\"double Blue\\". Robinson appeared in four rugby internationals for England. He played in an 8-0 defeat by Scotland while an undergraduate at Cambridge, and then played against all the other three \\"home\\" international side in 1902, when his club rugby was for Headingley. He did not play any further first-class cricket after leaving Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1894. He became a solicitor and practised at Nottingham and Leeds.

The Ojibwe pronunciation has been written in various spellings such as Bagone-giizhig, Bagwunagijik, Bug-o-nay-ki-shig, Pugonakeshig or Puk-O-Nay-Keshig. Hole-in-the-Day has also been called Hole- in-the-Sky. The name probably refers to a dream in which the guardian spirit was seen through an opening in the sky. Some have speculated that the name refers to an eclipse of the sun, or an opening in an overcast sky through which sunlight is streaming down. Biography In 1847 Hole in the Day (the Younger) succeeded his father, Hole in the Day (the Elder), as head chief of the Mississippi Band of the Ojibwe(Chippewa) of central Minnesota. Like his father, Hole in the Day the Younger was prominent in skirmishes against the Sioux(Dakota), and was prominent in negotiations with the Dakota and with the U.S. government. Hole in the Day the Younger strove to be considered the head chief of all Minnesota Ojibwe. Most white government officials actually did consider him to be head chief in Minnesota. This was due to his ambition to be involved in most, if not all, important negotiations and other dealings between the Minnesota Ojibwe and the US government, and that he presented himself in an articulate and stately manner. However, many of the other Ojibwe leaders in Minnesota did not recognize him as the head chief. Personal life Hole-in-the-Day had several wives. Some accounts number them as many as eightCarl Waldman. Who Was Who in Native American History: Indianas and Non- Indianas From Early Contacts through 1900. New York: Facts On File. 1990. p. 155-155 Other sources number his wives as a total of five.Brainard Dispatch article on Hold-in-the-Day What is agreed on though is that one of his wives was a white woman. He married her on a journey to the eastern United States, where she may have worked as a journalist. She is described as \\"Irish\\" but whether this means she was born in Ireland, or only that this was where her ancestors came from is unclear. Some sources give his named as Joseph Hole-in- the-Day. He was considering becoming a Catholic at the time of his death, but had not been baptized. During the 1862 Dakota War During the Dakota War of 1862 in Minnesota, Hole in the Day the Younger spoke out in favor of joining forces with the Dakota to drive European settlers from Minnesota. His threats to attack and take control of Fort Ripley caused a great amount of tension at the fort. To help encourage Minnesota Ojibwe to join the battle, he spread a false rumor that the federal government was drafting Ojibwe men to become soldiers in the ongoing Civil War. Largely in reaction to this rumor and warlike coaxing by Hole in the Day, a group of Leech Lake Ojibwe burned the Indian Agency in Walker, took prisoners, and marched to Crow Wing. Some other Ojibwe chiefs did not agree with the idea of going to war against the whites and sent Ojibwe fighters to Fort Ripley to help protect the fort against a possible attack from forces incited by Hole in the Day. The Assassination Hole in the Day the Younger was assassinated by gunshot on June 27, 1868 near the Crow Wing Agency by a group of at least twelve Ojibwe men. He was several miles from his home, on his way to argue against the planned removal of the Mississippi Ojibwe to a reservation at White Earth. This was Indian on Indian crime on Indian land, thus at this time white officials had little authority to get involved. Hole in the Day's death was national news, and rumors of its cause were many: personal jealousy, retribution for his claiming to be head chief of the Ojibwe, retaliation for the attacks he fomented in 1862, or retribution for his attempts to keep mixed-blood Ojibwe off the White Earth Reservation. For decades the assassination remained a mystery. The identification of the assassins was known, however no one was ever charged with the murder. In 1911 some of the assassins claimed that they had been hired by a group of mixed-blood traders led by Clement Beaulieu to kill Bagone-giizhig. Hole in the Day was originally given a Christian burial in the Crow Wing Catholic cemetery. In 1957 a white local resident illegally dug in the grave looking for valuable artifacts and discovered that there was no body. It is believed that Hole in the Day's relatives had removed his body and reburied him with traditional Ojibwe ritual in a secret location near White Earth village. Besides Hole in the Day the Elder and Hole in the Day the Younger, there were at least two other prominent Minnesota Ojibwe of the 1800s named Hole in the Day. One Hole-in-the-Day from Red Lake was involved in the Nelson Act of 1889. Another Hole-in-the-Day from Leech Lake played a leading role in 1898 in the nation's last Indian battle, the Battle of Sugar Point.
