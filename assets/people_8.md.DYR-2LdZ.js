In a realigning election, Democrats regained control of the mayor's office for the first time in 28 years; they have not relinquished this position since. The incumbent mayor, John Herron of the Republican Party chose to run for his first full term. Herron had been elevated to the executive office from his position as city council president after Charles H.

Regina Elena had a crew of 742‚Äì764 officers and enlisted men.Gardiner, p. 344Gardiner & Gray, p. 255 As built, the ship was armed with two 40-caliber guns placed in two single gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The ship was also equipped with twelve 45-cal. guns in six twin turrets amidships. Close-range defense against torpedo boats was provided by a battery of sixteen 40-cal. guns. Regina Elena was also equipped with two torpedo tubes placed in the hull below the waterline. Regina Elena was protected with Krupp steel manufactured in Terni. The main belt was thick, and the deck was thick. The conning tower was protected by of armor plating. The main battery guns had thick plating, and the 8-inch gun turrets had thick sides. Service history Regina Elena was laid down at the La Spezia shipyard on 27 March 1901, and was launched on 19 June 1904. After fitting-out work was completed, she was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 11 September 1907. She thereafter served in the Mediterranean Squadron,Brassey 1908, p. 52 and was ready for the annual maneuvers in late September and early October, under the command of Vice Admiral Alfonso di Brocchetti.Brassey 1908, pp. 77‚Äì78 In April 1908, Regina Elena participated in a naval demonstration off Asia Minor in protest of the Ottoman decision to prohibit Italian post offices in Ottoman territory. The ship was at that time commanded by Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi. The ship went to Messina in the aftermath of the 1908 Messina earthquake.Hore, p. 81 Regina Elena remained in the active duty squadron through 1910, by which time her three sisters had been completed, bringing the total number of front-line battleships to six, including the two s.Brassey 1911, p. 56These were all pre- dreadnought battleships, and were thus obsolescent by this period, but Italy's first dreadnought, , did not enter service until 1913. See: Gardiner & Gray, p. 259 Italo-Turkish War Regina Elena at anchor On 29 September 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire in order to seize Libya.Beehler, p. 6 For the duration of the conflict, Regina Elena was assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Squadron along with her three sisters, under the command of Vice Admiral Augusto Aubry. She joined the squadron late, on 5 October.Beehler, p. 9 On 18 October, Regina Elena and her three sisters, along with three cruisers and several destroyers and torpedo boats escorted a convoy that carried half of the 2nd Infantry Division to Benghazi. When the Ottomans refused to surrender the city before the amphibious assault, the Italian fleet opened fire on the Turkish defenders at 08:00, while landing parties from the ships and the Army infantry went ashore.Beehler, p. 27 The Italians quickly forced the Ottomans to withdraw into the city by evening. After a short siege, the Ottoman forces withdrew on 29 October, leaving the city to the Italians.Beehler, pp. 28‚Äì29 By December, Regina Elena and the other ships of the 1st Squadron were dispersed in the ports of Cyrenaica. Regina Elena, , and the armored cruiser were stationed in Benghazi, with Regina Elena recently arriving from Tobruk. While there, they supported the Italian Army as it occupied the city and surrounding area by contributing landing parties and providing fire support to the ground troops.Beehler, p. 47 The gunfire support supplied by Regina Elena contributed to the defeat of a major attack on the city by an Ottoman army on 14‚Äì15 December.Beehler, p. 49 In early 1912, most of the fleet had withdrawn to Italy for repairs and refit, leaving only a small force of cruisers and light craft to patrol the North African coast.Beehler, p. 64 In March 1914, Regina Elena was involved in experiments with wireless telegraphy in Syracuse, Sicily. The tests were conducted by Guglielmo Marconi and were supervised by the Duke of the Abruzzi. World War I Regina Elena at Taranto in May 1915. Italy declared neutrality after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers.Halpern 1995, p. 140 The primary naval opponent for the duration of the war was the Austro-Hungarian Navy; the Naval Chief of Staff, Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, believed the threat from submarines in the confined waters of the Adriatic was too serious to permit an active fleet policy.Halpern 1995, p. 150 He therefore planned a distant blockade with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats conducted raids. The heavy ships of the Italian fleet would be preserved for a potential major battle in the event that the Austro- Hungarian fleet should emerge from its bases.Halpern 1995, pp. 141‚Äì142 As a result, the ship's career during the war was limited. During the war, Regina Elena and her three sisters were assigned to the 2nd Division. They spent much of the war rotating between the bases at Taranto, Brindisi, and Valona, but did not see combat.Halpern 2004, p. 20 On 14‚Äì15 May 1917, three light cruisers of the Austro-Hungarian Navy raided the Otranto Barrage; in the ensuring Battle of the Strait of Otranto, Regina Elena and her sisters raised steam to assist the Allied warships, but the Italian commander refused to permit them to join the battle for fear of risking their loss in the submarine-infested Adriatic.Halpern 1995, p. 156 Under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, Italy was permitted to retain Regina Elena and her three sisters.Washington Naval Treaty, Chapter II: Part I The Italian Navy could have kept the ships in service indefinitely, but they could not be replaced by new battleships under the normal practice of the Treaty system.Gardiner & Gray, p. 254 Nevertheless, she was stricken from the naval register on 16 February 1923 and subsequently broken up for scrap.

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004 characterizes the group of disabilities as Emotional Disturbance (ED). This term is controversial as it is seen by some as excluding or even discriminating students with behavior issues and just focuses on the emotional aspects. Characteristics This group of disabilities are particularly difficult to classify as generalizations occur that may lead to some students who do not fit specific diagnostic criteria, but are still disabled, not determined eligible for special education services. Broadly, the group can be broken down to internal behaviors, external behaviors and low incidence behaviors. Internal behaviors are observed in students who are depressed, withdrawn and anxious. External behaviors are seen in students who are aggressive and act out. Such behavior would be classified as Disruptive Behavioral Disorder (DBD). Low incidence behaviors are behaviors that occur only in particular environmental triggers, such as a specific person or phrase. Note, some students may have only one category, some have mixed.The neuropsychology of social-emotional learning disabilities MB Denckla - Archives of Neurology, 1983 Services Students with an ED often have an early diagnosis among school districts. This is because teachers initiate the referral process among concerns over behavior in class. Often, the DSM-IV is used by a school psychologist, whom may conduct interviews and distribute surveys as part of the social-emotional evaluation. When determined ED the student will receive an Individualized Education Plan. Students can also receive certain supports under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, referred to as a 504 plan. This often includes goals towards appropriate behavior, productive coping strategies and academic skills. Effective services should focus on these, and can mandate an educational assistant for support in regular education classes, access to a resource room for individualized instruction, medication management provided by a mental health professional, as well as individual counseling.Adolescents with Learning Disabilities at Risk? Emotional Well-Being, Depression, Suicide.DD Huntington, WN Bender - Journal of Learning Disabilities, 1993 Students with ED are often considered at-risk for dropping out of school, suicide and criminal activity, as well as also being diagnosed with a learning disability.Learning Self-determination: Lessons from the Literature for Work with Children and Youth with Emotional and Behavioral Disabilities.

Silverwood Aviation INC is the owner of the airport. The national plan of integrated airport system classified it as a general aviation, basic utility airport. The nearest flight service station (FSS) is located at Riverside. As an FSS, the airport provides information and services to aircraft pilots before, during and after flights and provides assistance during emergencies. The airport also has a 16-unit motel with swimming pool, restaurant, bar and additional land for extensions. Mercy Air, a well known med-evac company, has a fixed base at the airport, including permanent medical and flight crews and their maintenance; they have serviced critical care transportation throughout California and Nevada for over 25 years.  History  On August 16, 1960, Marion A. Alley, a Glendora investor, president and board chairman of the new Hesperia Bowl Corporation, and nine others bought the Hesperia Airport for $250,000 (equivalent to $ in ) from Harry Stanford of Hesperia. At the time, they planned to expand and modernize the airport; this included adding a 24-hour fly-in service. Included in the purchase were the bar, restaurant, motel and swimming pool. Named chief pilot instructor and airport manager was Charles Janisse. The new management's intentions were to attract weekend recreationalists, executives and golfers to the desert area.  Accidents  On June 3, 1963, a World War II T-28 single engine trainer plane crashed in a shallow ravine, killing the two star performers at approximately 1:35pm during an airshow. The casualties were the airport manager and pilot, Leonard T. Lewis, 27, and the manager of the airport restaurant, Maitland John McNeill, 36. A Cessna 337 Skymaster crashed, killing the crew of four men on October 3, 1979, minutes after takeoff en route to Torrance Municipal Airport. The wreckage was spotted at 8:30 pm, according to the San Bernardino County Department 3. Three of the victims were from the Rancho Palos Verdes area, and the fourth was from the Westminster area. The National Air Transportation and Safety Board conducted an investigation. On March 7, 2017, a hobby ultralight aircraft crashed near Hesperia Airport at approximately 10 am. The pilot and only occupant was pronounced dead at the scene by the San Bernardino County Fire officials. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) did not investigate this crash, because the aircraft was not registered.  Facilities and aircraft  Hesperia Airport covers an area of at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway: 3/21 is with an asphalt surface. For the 12-month period ending August 17, 2007, the airport had 6,000 general aviation aircraft operations, an average of 16 per day. At that time there were 32 aircraft based at this airport: 29 single-engine, two multi-engine, one helicopter, and one ultralight.

Design A cross-section of a Type VIIC submarine German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. U-450 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two AEG GU 460/8‚Äì27 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to . The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . U-450 was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and a C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty. Service history The submarine was laid down in July 1941 in Danzig, Germany (now Poland). She was launched in July 1942 and commissioned in September that year. During her career with the Kriegsmarine, U-450 never sank any ships. Patrols On 27 May 1943, three days after she was redesignated from a training vessel to a front-line service boat, U-450 set out for her first patrol from Kiel, the home base of the 9th U-boat Flotilla under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Kurt B√∂hme. As the boat surfaced off the coast of Iceland on 6 June, she came under attack from a British B-17 Flying Fortress squadron, which wounded seven men. 16 days later, (with assistance from other boats due to the damage caused by the attack), she arrived at Brest in France. The patrol lasted 27 days, the longest of her career. On 17 October 1943, U-450 left Brest for Toulon. She arrived at the port city 23 days later. On 10 February 1944, ten days after a fire in her engine room had swept one man overboard and forced her to return to base, U-450 left Toulon for the Italian coast, presumably to attack support ships coming to reinforce Allied troops which had just landed at Anzio. Fate In March 1944, exactly one month later, she came under depth charge attack by the British escort destroyers , , and and the American escort destroyer . The submarine sank, at position , but all 51 crew members were rescued by the destroyers and became prisoners of war.

He was a veteran of Spanish Civil War, influenced by anarchism. One of the most prolific revolutionary writers in Latin America during the 1960s and intellectual mentor of Uruguay's revolutionary Movement of National Liberation (Tupamaros). He is most widely known as the author of Strategy of the Urban Guerrilla, which played an important role in the activities of urban guerrillas in Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil. Biography Guillen was born in Guadalajara on March 13, 1913. During the Spanish Civil War he fought against the Francisco Franco's forces, operating within the National Confederation of Labour (CNT), the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI), and the General Union of Workers (UGT). At the end of the war, he was arrested by Franco's forces, condemned to death, and ultimately was sentenced to ten years in prison. He escaped from prison in 1945, fled Spain, and spent three years in France. In 1948, he emigrated to Argentina. During the Per√≥n era, he worked as an editor for Economia y finanzas (\\"Economy and Finance\\"), and his contributions were published under the pseudonym, Jaime de las Heras. Under another pseudonym, that of Fernando Molina, he contributed to the Buenos Aires newspaper El Laborista. His 1957 publication The Agony of Imperialism, resulted in the loss of his job and his barring from employment as a journalist in Argentina. In 1960, he was employed briefly as an economic consultant to the Argentine government. In 1961, he was imprisoned for a few months on the charge that he was a member of the Uturuncos, guerrillas active in northwest Argentina during 1960 and 1961. Following his imprisonment he sought political asylum in Montevideo in 1962 and soon made contact with revolutionary elements in that country. The first edition of Strategy of the Urban Guerrilla was published in 1966. It served as a counter to the rural insurrectionist methods espoused by Che Guevara, although Guillen did agree with Guevara on several key issues and even authored the introduction to the Uruguayan edition of Guevara's Guerrilla Warfare. Guillen continued to publish frequently during this time period. He took a position as a journalist for the Montevideo newspaper Accion, often using the pseudonym of Arapey. Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, he was a constant subject of investigations both by Latin America police and by the CIA. In addition to Argentina and Uruguay, he also lived and worked in Peru and eventually returned to Madrid, Spain, where he taught theories of economic self-management and communal political action. He died on August 1, 1993.

History The school was founded by John Pierrepont in 1708. Pierrepont had made his fortune as a vintner in London and, being unmarried, elected to use his fortune in good works. He restored the chapel in Lucton village and provided a stipend for a minister. In his will, he also provided bequests to The Royal Hospital of St Bartholomew (of which he was a governor) and Mile End Hospital. His generosity is recorded on a funeral cartouche, originally mounted in the chapel in Lucton but now in the dining hall of the school. By Act of Parliament in 1708, Pierrepont established a free school in Lucton, based on the tithes due him from estates and manors such as those in Yarpole, Bircher, Luston and Eyton. The school was founded as a Bluecoat school (although the governors provided for pupils at Lucton the cheaper alternative of brown coats) and the building was erected on land purchased from Pierrepont‚Äôs friend, Sir Herbert Croft of nearby Croft Castle. Pierrepont himself set out detailed rules for the foundation and running of the School, aided by his parish priest at St. Botolph, Aldgate, Rev'd Dr White Kennett (later 16th Bishop of Peterborough.) His school was, he decided, to provide a sound Anglican education, as well as studies in Greek, Latin, reading, writing and arithmetic. The endowment was to provide free education to 50 boys from poorer families, whilst 30 boys from wealthier families would pay up to 10/- per annum. Since 1989, the school has been managed by the Lucton Pierrepont School Educational Trust. Campus The school is housed in a listed Queen Anne building, and a range of Victorian and modern buildings set in about of Herefordshire countryside. It comprises a nursery with about 60 infants (aged 6 months to 4 years), a preparatory school with 72 pupils (aged 5 to 10 years), a middle school with 72 pupils (aged 10‚Äì13 years), a senior school of 92 pupils (aged 13‚Äì16 years) and a sixth form of 56 pupils (aged 16‚Äì19 years). Queen Anne House is the original school house, with quarters for the headteacher, and two large school rooms, now the Queen Anne Dining Room and the assembly hall. The top storey, originally long room style dormitories, has been converted to a sixth form centre, a library and an ICT suite. The building also contains classrooms, the Senior Common Room, offices and sports changing rooms. The Victorian building houses science laboratories, ICT room, classrooms and the Upper Hall, an auditorium with stage, lighting box and green room. The Hereford Block is a prefab housing the middle school, and a DT classroom and workshop. Croft House is home to the school's senior boarders, with younger boarders living in School Cottage. The former Hall Design School has been converted to house the preparatory and nursery schools. Sporting facilities include an indoor swimming pool (opened by British Paralympian swimmers Sascha Kindred and Nyree Lewis, and formally named The Wessex Pool by HRH Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex as part of the school's tercentenary celebrations in 2008) and a large playing field, named The Holland after its donor. The conversion of the former covered playground known as The Acky into an up-to-date, weather-proofed sports hall was completed in the summer of 2013. In 2009, the school developed a new equestrian centre and, in 2015, Lucton purchased an extra to increase the playing field provision. Curriculum Class sizes are small with an average of 14 pupils per class and the syllabus broadly follows the English National Curriculum. In addition to the core curriculum (English language and literature, maths, biology, chemistry and physics) subjects taught include art, business studies, dance, design technology (DT), drama, environmental science, economics, EFL/EAL, ethics, French, geography, German, history, information and communication technology (ICT), Latin, Mandarin, music, psychology, philosophy, Spanish, textiles and theatre studies. All pupils pursue a course of RS to Year 9 and a course in philosophy and ethics to GCSE, with the option to continue that course to 'A' level. Pupils also study PSE up to Year 11, with COPE (Certificate of Personal Effectiveness) available to pupils in the Sixth Form. Pupils are prepared for qualifications at GCSE, IGCSE and 'A' level. Extra curricular activities=Sport The main boys' sports are Rugby football in the autumn term, Association football in the spring and cricket in the summer; the main girls' sports are netball in the autumn and spring terms, and rounders in the summer. Other sports offered include athletics, cross country running, hockey, basketball, badminton, swimming, tennis and the recently introduced lacrosse. The school has promoted aquathlon--a triathlon event without the cycling component--specifically in an open event attended by local primary schools. Primary schools from across the county come together each year to compete for the Lucton School Tercentenary Shield, a cross-country competition for children aged between 7 and 11. Riding lessons are offered for all age groups and for those outside the school, on both the pupils' own mounts and on a community of resident ponies. The centre features an all-weather arena and stabling for 14 horses. Enrichment The school operates an Enrichment Activities programme, where activities on offer include art club, astronomy, board games, bridge club, chess club, conversational English, cookery, debating society, DT club, film club, ICT, knitting and handicrafts, poetry circle, science club and stable management, as well as a range of sporting hobbies. A significant part of these activities is the tutoring and encouragement of younger pupils by their older peers. CCF The school has a Combined Cadet Force (CCF) which was first formed by Headmaster Vernon Pitt in 1917 and is attached to The Rifles Regiment. The Lucton School CCF currently holds the title of the National CCF First Aid Competition winners. Prep school pupils have the benefit of Forest Schools, conducted within the school grounds. Drama and music Each section of the school offers a major dramatic production each year. Recently, the senior school has produced \\"Daisy Pulls It Off\\", \\"Teechers\\" and \\"Hi-de-Hi!\\"; the middle school has offered \\"Toad of Toad Hall\\", \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" and \\"Wyrd Sisters\\"; prep school productions have included \\"Cinderella and Rockerfella\\" and \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\", whilst the nursery produces a traditional nativity play each year. All pupils in years 5 and 6 have free violin or cello lessons, and individual tuition is available on a full range of other instruments, including the harp, guitar, voice and percussion. There is a school orchestra, as well as various instrumental groups and three choirs which perform in concert at the school as well as singing evensong in cathedrals and greater churches. Pupils may study for LAMDA qualifications in \\"Speech and Drama\\", and for music qualifications through the ABRSM Publications and other activities The School produces an annual magazine, The Luctonian, as well as a weekly newsletter, Lucton News. The operation of the school is supported by an active group of parents, staff and other supporters (The Friends of Lucton) and by a growing alumni society, The Old Luctonians' Association.

CD96 is a receptor protein which is expressed on T cells and NK cells and shares sequence similarity with CD226 (also known as DNAM-1). The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is a type I membrane protein. The protein may play a role in the adhesion of activated T and NK cells to their target cells during the late phase of the immune response. It may also function in antigen presentation. Alternative splicing occurs at this locus and two transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified. CD96 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that has three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and is expressed by all resting human and mouse NK cells. CD96 main ligand is CD155.

While the Japanese name of the trio literally translates to \\"Fighting Spirit Three Musketeers\\", in English they are commonly known simply as \\"The Three Musketeers\\".  Careers  Keiji Mutoh, Masahiro Chono, and Shinya Hashimoto were part of the Class of 1984 of the New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) Dojo, which included Akira Nogami and Jyushin Thunder Liger. Hashimoto would be the first to make his debut in September 1984, while Mutoh and Chono faced each other in their debuts a month later. In 1988, while on an excursion in Puerto Rico, the three formed Toukon Sanjushi or The Three Musketeers. They had one match in NJPW as a team together on July 29 against Kengo Kimura, Shiro Koshinaka, and Tatsumi Fujinami, before Mutoh returned to North America for more seasoning. Chono and Hashimoto would remain a tag team for a couple years, with their most notable match against Antonio Inoki and Seiji Sakaguchi in February 1990 at the Tokyo Dome. In 1991, Toukon Sanjushi solidified their status as the next generation of NJPW at the first-ever G1 Climax tournament with Chono winning the tournament after defeating Mutoh in the finals. A year later, the trio would begin to have more success, as Chono won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, and Mutoh, as The Great Muta, won the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. It temporarily left Hashimoto out in the cold, until he won the IWGP Heavyweight Championship from Muta in September 1993. In August 1994, Toukon Sanjushi disbanded as a team, as Chono turned into a villain shortly after the G1 Climax. In the early 2000s, NJPW began promoting the trio of Hiroshi Tanahashi, Katsuyori Shibata and Shinsuke Nakamura as the new Three Musketeers. Between 2001 and 2005, the three would reunite on special occasions, mainly press conferences, occasionally with Mitsuharu Misawa. Tragedy struck the group when Shinya Hashimoto died on July 11, 2005 from a brain aneurysm, at the young age of 40. Hashimoto's death dashed hopes for Hashimoto's return to NJPW and the upcoming Tokon Sanjushi reunion on July 26. Mutoh and Chono were deeply affected by the loss of Hashimoto. In January 2007, after defeating Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima at the first edition of Wrestle Kingdom, Mutoh and Chono paid tribute to Hashimoto by wearing his trademark white headband and exiting the ring to Hashimoto's theme music. In March 2011, Shinya's son Daichi debuted, and Mutoh and Chono served as his first opponents.

He was also a political activist, author, soldier, actor and stage manager. He played a major role in keeping Missouri in the Union at the start of the Civil War. Biography=Europe His family fled from his native city to Lemberg (then in Austrian Galizia, now L'viv in Ukraine), in 1813, due to fighting over Hamburg between allied and French forces.Heinrich B√∂rnstein, Memoiren, vol. 1, 1-22 He studied half-heartedly at the University of Lemberg and then read medical literature in Vienna. He acquired a special hostility to the Roman Catholic Church due to being required to attend Catholic catechism despite being a Protestant. After leaving the university, Boerrnstein joined an Austrian army regiment stationed in Olm√ºtz, Moravia, for five years, before resigning his commission as a cadet and going to Vienna. There he became involved in journalism and theater. He married the Hungarian actress Marie Steltzer (age 15 years) on November 13, 1829. After a period in Vienna, Boernstein went on tour as an actor to cities in the Austrian Empire such as Budapest, Lubjana, Agram [Zagreb], Trieste and Venice, and he served as supervisor of the municipal theaters in St. P√∂lten and Linz. He became both a successful theatrical entrepreneur and a popular actor. In 1841, he and his wife toured the principal cities of Germany with great success. His radical political views enticed him to Paris, and in 1842 he took a German opera company there, which failed to flourish. He was a friend of Franz Liszt, Alexandre Dumas and Giacomo Meyerbeer. He managed an Italian opera company in Paris before starting a \\"translation factory\\" modifying French drama for performance in German. In 1844 and 1845 he published the radical journal Vorw√§rts! Pariser Signale aus Kunst, Wissenschaft, Musik und geselligem Leben [\\"Advance! Paris Signals from Art, Science, Music and Social Life\\"], later Vorw√§rts! Pariser Deutsche Zeitschrift [\\"Advance! Paris German Journal\\"]. It became the chief mouthpiece of Karl Marx and other Paris radicals of the time, including Friedrich Engels, Karl Ludwig Bernays, Arnold Ruge, and Heinrich Heine. French authorities shut Vorw√§rts! down early in 1845, expelling or imprisoning most of those associated with the journal.B√∂rnstein, Memoiren, vol. 1, pp. 332-54; Walter Schmidt, \\"Zur Geschichte des Pariser Vorw√§rts von 1844,\\" in Vorw√§rts! ed. Heinrich B√∂rnstein with L. F. C. Bernays, Arnold Ruge, Heinrich Heine, Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, facsimile reprint (Leipzig, 1975), pp. V-LVII; on B√∂rnstein's later view of Marx, see Steven Rowan in the \\"Introduction\\" to Memoirs of a Nobody, 6-11. Boernstein remained in Paris, recording political events in France for newspapers that could not afford a reporter there. He was assisted by his perennial co-worker Karl Ludwig Bernays. Boernstein wrote articles for Horace Greeley's New-York Tribune (translated into English by Charles Anderson Dana and Bayard Taylor) as well as for German journals in America such as the Deutsche Schnellpost of New York.B√∂rnstein, Memoiren, vol. 1, 383. At the time of the February,1848, Revolution in Paris, he became president of the Soci√©t√© des Democrats Allemands, helping to organize a military unit under Georg Herwegh to aid the revolt in Baden.B√∂rnstein, Memoiren, vol. 1, 402-11. He withdrew from the revolutionary movement when socialists insisted on a right to labor.B√∂rnstein, Memoiren, vol. 1, 420-21. Throughout the 1848 Revolution in Paris he collected pamphlets and newspapers on the streets every day. He gave this collection to the St. Louis Mercantile Library in 1853, where it remains today.Adam Arenson, The Great Heart of the Republic, p. 62 n. 40, citing the papers of the Saint Louis Mercantile Association; B√∂rnstein, Memoiren, vol. 1, p. 418. He departed France in January, 1849, after Louis Napol√©on was inaugurated as President of the Second Republic. United States After landing in New Orleans, Boernstein passed through St. Louis, Missouri, to the Swiss community of Highland, Illinois, where he practiced as a water-cure physician until offered the editorship of the German-language newspaper Anzeiger des Westens [\\"Western Reporter\\"] in St. Louis in March, 1850.Henry Boernstein, Memoirs, 122, 138. He soon became its publisher and proprietor. To promote circulation, he published many prominent European novelists and memoirists of the time as serials, and in 1850 he wrote a sensationalist anti-Jesuit novel, Die Geheimnisse von St. Louis [The Mysteries of St. Louis], translated subsequently into English, French and Czech. It was in the tradition of the \\"urban mystery\\" novels of Eug√®ne Sue (Les myst√®res de Paris, Le juif errant). It had many editions in America and Germany, and it was revived in the 1870s in the context of Bismarck's Kulturkampf with the papacy. Boernstein introduced a sensational journalistic style in his Anzeiger, raising the ire of nativist mobs, led in one case by Ned Buntline.Boernstein, Memoirs, 179-81. The Anzeiger revived the political career of former US Senator Thomas Hart Benton, winning Benton one term in the House of Representatives on behalf of \\"Benton Democracy.\\"Boernstein, Memoirs, 187-91. Boernstein became an early supporter of the newly founded Republican Party, and he dramatized the fact that John Fr√©mont was not on the ballot in Missouri in 1856 by having his followers vote for the Know-Nothing presidential candidate Millard Fillmore \\"under protest,\\"Boernstein, Memoirs, 213. since the nativist position was incidentally in tune with his hostility to Catholicism. Boernstein's freewheeling methods earned him enemies within the German community as well as among English-speakers. In 1857 Die westliche Post was founded as a competitor for support from \\"progressive\\" Germans.Steven Rowan, \\"Introduction\\" to Rowan and Primm, Germans for a Free Missouri, 41-43. At the start of the Civil War, Boernstein's enterprises included a brewery, a hotel, and several saloons. In 1859 he leased the Vari√©t√©s Theater in St. Louis and launched it as an opera house. It closed when Boernstein went off to war in 1861.Boernstein, Memoirs, 247-71. This is documented from the R. G. Dun & Co. Papers, Baker Library, Harvard University Business School. In the months before Abraham Lincoln's inauguration, political tensions in St. Louis deteriorated into armed confrontation, while pro-Southern elements plotted to seize the United States Arsenal. A military force was organized in the Arsenal in April 1861, under federal auspices by Congressman Francis Preston Blair, Jr., and Captain Nathaniel Lyon; Boernstein was elected colonel of the Second Missouri Volunteer Regiment (of four regiments). Before his election as colonel, his company escorted weapons and ammunition by boat from the Arsenal to Alton, Illinois.Boernstein, Memoirs, 287‚Äì91. He participated in the arrest of the Missouri State Militia at Camp Jackson on May 10, 1861, and wrote a letter to Lincoln with a description of the subsequent shooting of civilians under riot conditions.Boernstein, Memoirs, 309-11, report to Lincoln, but not found in the Lincoln Papers. Generally on Camp Jackson, see Wilhelm Kaufmann, The Germans in the American Civil War, 108-16. When Lyon (now a Brigadier General) moved into the interior of Missouri in June, Boernstein commanded the force occupying Jefferson City, the state capital.Boernstein, Memoirs, 323-30. After the expiration of three months' federal service, Boernstein was appointed United States Consul in Bremen, Germany, by President Lincoln, although he returned briefly to St. Louis in 1862 in a vain attempt to save Blair's Congressional seat for the Republican Party.Boernstein, Memoirs, 370‚Äì79. Europe again Boernstein served as US Consul in Bremen throughout the Civil War and was only replaced by President Andrew Johnson in 1866. Boernstein decided to remain in Europe, since the Anzeiger had been unexpectedly closed. In 1869-71 he leased the Theater in der Josefstadt in Vienna and later reviewed scripts of plays for the Stadttheater.B√∂rnstein, Memoiren, vol. 2, 421-29. He worked in Vienna for a while as a photographer. He retired in 1878 to Baden bei Wien to write his memoirs; they were published in the Illinois Staatszeitung of Chicago and as a two volume book in two editions, in 1881 and 1884. A street is named after him in the Strebersdorf district of Vienna. His grave in the Protestant cemetery of Vienna, Matzleinsdorfer Friedhof, was obliterated by authorities in 1941.

The work is inspired by and named after Ali Pasha, the Ottoman lord of Ioannina, Epirus, describing, in heroic style, his life and military campaigns. Background and historical value Although Ali Pasha was Albanian, he used Greek in his courtly dealings, since this was the dominant language in the regions he controlled. Moreover, the use of Greek language in various works of Albanian authors was very common. In accordance to this, the composer of the Alipashiad, who was Ali's personal balladeer, Haxhi Shehreti, composed this work in Greek language, considering it a more prestigious language in which to praise his master. William Leake says that Shehreti had no Greek education and knew only the colloquial Greek of Albania and its borders. The language of the poem, therefore (according to Leake) represents the local vulgar dialect of the Greek language.William M. Leake (1835) Travels in Northern Greece, vol. 1, p. 463. Historically, the Alipashiad contains the unusual feature of being written from the Muslim point of view. Apart from describing Ali's adventures the poem describes Ioannina, which was a center of Greek culture and renaissance that time, as well as the activities of the local mercenaries (Armatoles) and revolutionaries (Klephts) that Ali had to deal with. Text and date The Alipashiad consists of 15,000 lines and was written in installments in the first years of the 19th century, when Ali Pasha was at his height as the powerful and semi-independent ruler of much of Ottoman Greece. The poem is written in a modern demotic Greek language and contains some dialectical interference and foreign expressions. A copy of the poem was found by the British antiquarian and topographer, William Martin Leake, in 1817. In 1835 he published 4,500 lines of the Alipashiad. The entire poem was published by the Greek historian Constantine Sathas in his volume Historical Disquisitions in 1870 (The Alipashiad, of the Turkalbanian Hadji Sehreti).

Established as the Jamiat Ulema-e Islam in 1945, it is the result of a factional split in 1988, F standing for the name of its leader, Fazal-ur-Rehman. JUI-F is as of 2013 Pakistan's 5th largest party, winning 3.2% of the popular vote, or 15 out of 272 general seats in the National Assembly. It is entirely based in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and northern parts of Baluchistan. The JUI-S faction, led by Samiul Haq, is of regional significance in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa but has no representation on the national level. The split of JUI into two factions was due to dissent over the policy of president Zia-ul-Haq of supporting Mujahideen outfits in the Afghanistan war during the 1980s. A more recent faction known as JUI-N, split off JUI-F in 2008, is also unrepresented at the national level. History=Formation The JUI follows the Sunni (deobandi) school. In Pakistan, Deobandis have a presence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, and Balochistan. The JUI traces its roots to Politically active Deobandi who formed the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind (JUH), in 1919 in British India. The JUH was against colonialism and for a united India, opposing the formation of a separate homeland for Indian Muslims. A faction supporting the creation of Pakistan parted ways in 1945 to support the All Indian Muslim League. This faction came to be known as the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI). United JUI JUI's first president, Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, broke away from the party in 1947 to form the Markazi Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (MJUI), which played a key position in the passage of the Objectives Resolution of 1949 that laid down the \\"Islamic\\" foundations of future constitutions in Pakistan. The JUI became more politically active under Maulana Mufti Mahmood (1919‚Äì1980) who assumed its leadership in 1962. Under Mahmood during the 1960s the party \\"developed a strong presence\\" and base of support among the \\"intensely conservative countryside\\" of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Mahmood led the JUI against Ayub Khan's modernization policies. The JUI also participated in the 1970 elections with the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan party and the Barelvi Sunni religious party Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan (JUP). It won seven seats in the National Assembly and nine in the provincial assemblies and became a partner in the NWFP and Balochistan provincial governments.International Crisis Group, Islamic Parties in Pakistan, p.11 Mufti Mahmood was sworn in as NWFP chief minister. Under him the provincial government established a board to bring all laws in conformity with Islam. He resigned in 1973 over Bhutto‚Äôs dismissal of the Balochistan provincial government. Split into JUI-F and JUI-S During the 1980s, the JUI supported some of General Zia ul Haq's policies, including his anti-Soviet Jihad in Afghanistan. Additionally, official patronage and financial support for madrassas during the Zia years allowed the JUI to build thousands of madrassas, especially in the NWFP (now KPK), which were instrumental in the formation of the Taliban. At the same time the JUI was distrustful of Zia's close ties with the Jamaat-e-Islami and joined the anti-Zia and PPP-led Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD). Following the death of Mufti Mehmood Ahmed in 1980s, This dual relationship with Zia's regime eventually led to a split in the party which came to be divided into the JUI-F, headed by Maulana Fazal-ur-Rehman and the JUI-S headed by Samiul Haq, who supported Zia and was a member in his parliament, the Majlis-e-Shura.  JUI-F Gets Renamed as JUI  However, after the assassination of JUI-S chief Maulana Samiul Haq in 2018, activities of his faction gradually died down.Special Correspondent (Daily Jang), \\"Election Commission accepts JUI(F) plea to get renamed as JUI\\", Urdu; (Daily Jang, Rawalpindi, 17 March, 2020)pp12 This lead Moulana Fazal-ur- Rehman to plead before Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for and to get his JUI-F faction renamed as JUI in March, 2019. Madrassas Over the years the JUI-S has maintained that it is more committed to enforcing Sharia in the country than the JUI-F faction. JUI-S influence is largely restricted to a few districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) whereas the JUI-F is predominant in the Pashtun areas of Balochistan and KPK. Both factions of the JUI have a large network of madrassas and mosques that provide the main basis of its religious activism and politics. The two JUIs run over 65 per cent of all madrassas in Pakistan.International Crisis Group, Islamic Parties in Pakistan, p.12 About 30,000 Afghan refugee students from JUI-controlled madrassas (both JUI-F and JUI-S) in Pakistan joined the Taliban movement in Afghanistan. JUI party workers and leaders are mostly products of the madrassa system, although the JUI-F has often fielded candidates from a mainstream educational background. Both JUI factions have backed other India-oriented Deobandi militant groups, particularly the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen and its offshoot, the Jaish-e-Mohammad, with JUI madrassas providing recruits for them. They are closely associated with the Taliban in Afghanistan. The Taliban movement reportedly originated in JUI seminaries. Samiul Haq (of the JUI-S) is the leader of the Darul Uloom Haqqania madrassa in Akora Khattak, from where many of the top leaders of Taliban commanders and leaders, including its supreme leader the Mullah Omar, graduated.International Crisis Group, Islamic Parties in Pakistan, p.13 In contrast to Maulana Samiul Haq and his JUI-S openly supporting Militarism the JUI-F has a policy of not supporting militant activity and of promoting multi party electoral politics. Peace deals The JUI-F has also played a role in brokering peace deals between the military and militants in Pakistan's tribal belt. For instance, in 2004, two JUI-F national parliamentarians from South Waziristan arranged a deal (known as the Shakai agreement) with the Pakistani Taliban leadership and in September 2006 the JUI-F helped broker a similar deal in North Waziristan. These deals have been criticized for legitimizing \\"the status of the local militants as power- brokers\\". JUI-F leader Fazlur Rahman is also reportedly involved in negotiating agreements between the Pakistani Taliban and military and the Afghan Taliban and the U.S. On the political front the JUI-F has been more successful than the JUI-S. Fazlur Rahman, leader of the JUI-F, was appointed as Chairman of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs in the second government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto (1993‚Äì96). History since 2002 The JUI-F was also the largest party in the MMA, winning 41 seats in the National Assembly and 29 of the MMA's 48 seats in NWFP in the 2002 elections. Subsequently, Fazlur Rahman became the Leader of the Opposition in 2004 and retained the post till 2007. The JUI-F was also part of the current ruling PPP coalition but left the government amidst charges of corruption against one of its members, an information technology minister of the federal cabinet. In return for JUI-F support, the PPP-led government appointed Maulana Sherani, a JUI-F senator without any formal academic training in Islamic jurisprudence, as chairman of the Council of Islamic Ideology in 2010. Sherani has frequently spoken out against the government‚Äôs legislative efforts, particularly those related to women. He opposed a proposed bill on domestic violence stating that domestic violence was not a major issue in Pakistan until women's rights groups appeared and \\"created\\" it and that any such legislation hinders the creation of a \\"true Islamic society\\". Currently, even though the JUI-F is no longer a coalition partner, Fazlur Rahman chairs the Kashmir committee and another JUI-F senator, Talha Mahmood Aryan, chairs the standing interior committee of the senate. Both factions of the JUI have frequently come together on a common platform to oppose American drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal areas, viewing it as a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty. For example, following the 2 May 2011 U.S. raid in Abbottabad that led to Osama Bin Laden's killing, the JUI-F and the JUI-S participated in a multi-party conference in Peshawar, condemning the drone strikes and calling on the government to end logistical support to NATO troops in Afghanistan. On the domestic front, members of the JUI-F have been vocal critics of changes in the blasphemy laws. Fazlur Rahman remained silent until his party left the ruling coalition in December 2010, after which he criticized proposals to amend the blasphemy law. The JUI-F has also opposed the passage of a bill aimed at preventing domestic violence with its members vowing to fight it \\"tooth and nail\\" as, according to them, its passage would \\"promote Western culture in the Islamic state.\\" In 2008, a further (minor) split of JUI-F resulted in the formation of a third faction, known as JUI-N (\\"N\\" for Nazryati \\"Ideological\\").

Tallmadge's raid was successful; the garrison was surprised, and many provisions and prisoners were taken. Raid Loyalist refugees from Rhode Island were resettled onto Long Island after the British withdrew their forces from Newport, Rhode Island in 1779. Some of these were established at Manor St. George on the southeastern part of the island (in present-day Shirley, New York). They fortified the property, erecting a stockade high in a roughly triangular shape around the manor house. The stockade was lined with abatis (tree branches with sharpened points facing out) and a deep ditch. Major Benjamin Tallmadge led a force of about 80 men (drawn from his 2nd Continental Light Dragoons) that crossed Long Island Sound in whaleboats from Fairfield, Connecticut on November 21, 1780, landing at present-day Mt. Sinai. Leaving a guard of 20 men with the boats, the remaining men began to march across Long Island that evening, but bad weather forced them to return to the boats. After the weather improved, Tallmadge again set out on the evening of the 22nd, arriving near the property before dawn on the 23rd. Ordering his men to leave their muskets unloaded and with bayonets fixed, Tallmadge divided his force into three, with each unit to attack one of the stockade's sides. Tallmadge's party was not spotted in the early dawn light until it was within of the stockade, and a sentry fired his weapon to raise the alarm. At this point Tallmadge's men rushed the stockade. Tallmadge's unit cut its way through the stockade while the other two units scaled the wall. According to Tallmadge's report the surprise was sufficient: the main house was surrounded and surrendered \\"in less than ten minutes\\". However, some of the Loyalist garrison managed to reach a fortified house that formed part of the stockade. These men surrendered after a brief firefight. Aftermath Tallmadge's force destroyed stores and took captive not just the armed defenders but a number of non-combatants as well. These were then marched across the island, and taken on Tallmadge's boats across to Fairfield. Tallmadge reported that only one of his men was wounded. Of the enemy he claimed that seven were killed and 54 wounded. Participating in the battle was Sgt. Elijah Churchill who would be awarded the first Badge of Military Merit, predecessor to the Purple Heart. The route Tallmadge used to cross the island is now known as the Tallmadge Trail. The Smith Estate and its grounds are now a museum and public park operated by the township of Brookhaven.

The encounter happened off the coast of Somalia and ended with the death of one pirate and the capture of six others. Action The MV Almezaan had already been attacked and captured twice by Somali pirates over the past few years. In both incidents, ransoms were paid and the freighter was released. After the second attack, the operators of the ship hired a security team to protect the vessel from the pirates. While sailing off Somalia towards Mogadishu in the Indian Ocean on early Tuesday, 25 March 2010, the Panama flagged vessel was engaged by pirates on a large whaler and two small skiffs. The pirates advanced towards the ship, firing AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades. As the pirates closed in on their target, the Almezaans security detachment responded. Little is known but the security force of a few men armed with small arms fired on the attacking skiffs which temporarily forced them back. One pirate was killed and one skiff sustained several small caliber bullet holes. The pirates then attacked again but the merchant vessel was apparently able to slip away. After the attack on the freighter, the pirates began to flee. The successful defense of the freighter and the death of a pirate by the security team was the first known engagement of its type to have occurred according to news reports. Almezaans master reported the incident over the radio to the allied naval presence in the region and the Spanish frigate Navarra proceeded to the area after a short cruise. Accounts differ in terms of what happened next, what is known is that the Spaniards sighted the large mother ship and the two skiffs, the Spanish commander then ordered their capture by launching a helicopter. The helicopter approached the vessels and fired a few warning shots. The pirates refused to surrender so a boarding party was dispatched to the pirate skiffs but by the time the Spanish boarding party had reached the pirates, they had already thrown their weapons into the sea and surrendered. The skiffs were captured and contained seven pirates, one of whom was the man the security team had killed. The Spanish also observed several of the gunshots in the side of the skiff. The sailors returned to their frigate and the mother ship was sunk by naval gunfire.La 'Navarra' intercepta dos esquifes y un barco nodriza Spanish MoD release, 23 March 2010 The six living pirates were detained but later released by the Spanish Navy and sent back to Somalia in the remaining skiffs. The pirates were freed due to the crew of Almezaan refusing to testify against their attackers, possibly fearing reprisal.

BASIS Curriculum Schools also own BASIS Independent Schools and BASIS International Schools. BASIS Curriculum Schools are managed by BASIS Educational Group, LLC, a for- profit charter management organization based in Scottsdale, Arizona. BASIS Charter Schools seek to prepare students, in the elementary through high school level, to be competitive globally. This is done through extended homework hours, lecture driven classes, an emphasis on success in standardized tests, like Advanced Placement tests, and an opportunity to graduate early or complete a senior project.  History  The first BASIS Charter School, BASIS Tucson, was founded in Tucson in 1998 by Michael Block and Olga Block, with the goal of educating students at an internationally competitive level. In 2003, BASIS Scottsdale was opened. In 2010, Basis Oro Valley was founded. A year later, Basis opened three schools at once in Chandler, Peoria, and Flagstaff.\\"Basis applies to become K-12 school\\". Arizona Daily Sun, December 09, 2014 MICHELLE McMANIMON Basis continued its expansion by opening another school in Tucson and one in Phoenix proper in fall 2012, along with their first non-Arizona school, located in Washington, D.C. In 2013, Basis opened its tenth and eleventh Arizona campuses in Ahwatukee and Mesa, and the second non-Arizona campus was added in San Antonio, Texas. Basis also began its primary (K-4) program at their Basis Tucson site. In 2014, Basis opened in Prescott, AZ. In 2015, Basis opened its sixteenth Arizona school in Goodyear, AZ. Basis was featured in the documentary film 2 Million Minutes: A 21st Century Solution, which examined differences between the curriculum of charter schools in comparison with that of conventional public schools. In response to the documentary, Newt Gingrich and Al Sharpton visited a Basis campus to deliver speeches on the importance of education in America.* http://www.azfamily.com/news/Scottsdale-school-wins-international- recognition-274832381.html  Locations  There are currently 28 BASIS Schools, including 21 schools located in Arizona, one located in Louisiana, two in Texas, one in Washington, D.C., and one in New York.  Successes  Basis schools have regularly topped U.S. national school rankings, earning the top five spots and more among the U.S. News & World Report Best High Schools 2017 rankings, and earning the number one spot on the list of America's Most Challenging High Schools published by The Washington Post.  Criticisms and controversies  Both Basis schools and their parent organization have been the subject of criticism and controversy. Critics contend that Basis is failing to provide adequate financial transparency and accountability as it uses for-profit management company. Another investigative article in 2010 questioned the founders' salary compared to the teachers and other public school administrators. Other critics take issue with Basis's accelerated curriculum and general educational philosophy. Some argue that Basis focuses too much on standardized testing. Critics also point out that Basis's performance in national ranking systems like the U.S. News & World Report is largely a function of Basis's singular focus on mandatory Advanced Placement (AP) testing, as these ranking systems give great weight to the percentage of students at a school that take the AP tests. Critics also take issue with Basis's attrition rates (senior classes are typically a third to a quarter of the size of the fifth grade class) and argue that Basis achieves good test scores in part by weeding out under-performing students. In 2013, the District of Columbia Public Charter School Board rejected a request from Basis DC to expand, citing concerns about the high number of students who had withdrawn from the school since it opened. Basis schools in Arizona solicit contributions from parents, an unusual practice for publicly funded schools. Basis Scottsdale asks $1,500 per student. Basis teachers make less than the average for public school teachers in the state, although Basis.ed contends that with bonuses, making teacher compensation competitive.

Made of rubber, it was a forerunner to the modern diaphragm and cervical cap.Janet Farrell Brodie, Contraception and Abortion in Nineteenth-Century America (Cornell University Press, 1994), p. 216 online; Andrea Tone, Devices and Desires: A History of Contraceptives in America (MacMillan, 2001), p. 14. An illustration of occlusive pessaries of the womb-veil type may be viewed in Vern L. Bullough, Encyclopedia of Birth Control (ABC-Clio, 2003), p. 206 online. The name was first used by Edward Bliss Foote in 1863 for the device he designed and marketed.Robert J√ºtte, Contraception: A History (Polity Press, 2008, originally published in German 2003), p. 154 online. \\"Womb veil\\" became the most common 19th-century American term for similar devices,Brodie, Contraception and Abortion, p. 212. and continued to be used into the early 20th century. Womb veils were among a \\"range of contraceptive technology of questionable efficacy\\" available to American women of the 19th century,Jeffrey D. Nichols, Prostitution, Polygamy and Power: Salt Lake City, 1847‚Äì1918 (University of Illinois Press, 2002), p. 69 online. forms of which began to be advertised in the 1830s and 1840s.Brodie, Contraception and Abortion, pp. 190 and 212. They could be bought widely through mail-order catalogues; when induced abortion was criminalized during the 1870s, reliance on birth control increased.Esther Katz, \\"The History of Birth Control in the United States,\\" in History of Medicine (Routledge, 1988), vol. 4, pp. 89‚Äì90 online; Andrea Tone, Controlling Reproduction: An American History p. 215 online. Womb veils were touted as a discreet form of contraception, with one catalogue of erotic products from the 1860s promising that they could be \\"used by the female without danger of detection by the male.\\"Donna Dennis, Licentious Gotham: Erotic Publishing and Its Prosecution in Nineteenth-Century New York (Harvard University Press, 2009), pp. 215‚Äì216 online. The use of rubber pessaries for contraception likely arose from the 19th-century practice of correcting a prolapsed uterus with such a device; the condition seems to have been far more frequently diagnosed than its incidence would warrant, and at times may have been a fiction for employing a pessary for birth control.Angus McLaren, \\"Birth Control: The Diaphragm,\\" in Eyewitness to Science (Harvard University Press, 1995), p. 175; Katz, \\"The History of Birth Control in the United States,\\" p. 91. As with the production of condoms for men, the development of vulcanized rubber by Charles Goodyear helped make barrier contraceptives for women more reliable and inexpensive.Patricia Aikens Murphy, Katherine Morgan, and Frances E. Likis, \\"Contraception,\\" in Women's Gynecologic Health (Jones and Bartlett, 2006), p. 177 online; Larry Lankton, Beyond the Boundaries: Life and Landscape at the Lake Superior Copper Mines, 1840‚Äì1875 (Oxford University Press, 1997), p. 160 online; Tone, Devices and Desires, p. 14. Other terms for the contraceptive diaphragm were \\"female preventatives\\", \\"female protectors\\", \\"Victoria's protectors\\", and the \\"French pessary\\" (\\"F.P.\\") or pessaire preventif.Brodie, Contraception and Abortion in Nineteenth-Century America, p. 5. This linguistic variety, some of it euphemistic, makes it difficult to distinguish in the literature among diaphragms, cervical caps, female condoms, and other pessaries; one form of \\"womb veil\\" is described in 1890 as \\"like a ring pessary covered by a membraneous envelope.\\"Brodie, Contraception and Abortion in Nineteenth-Century America, p. 216. Another source in 1895 describes it as \\"a small soft rubber cup surrounded at the brim by a flexible rubber ring about an inch or inch and a quarter in diameter.\\"William Pawson Chunn, \\"The Prevention of Conception. Its Practicability and Justifiability,\\" Hot Spring Medical Journal 4 (1895), p. 83. Social history The Popular Health Movement of the Jacksonian era encouraged the sharing of knowledge about contraception, and contraceptive devices were advertised openly in newspaper ads and in brochures throughout the first half of the 19th century.Adele Clark, Disciplining Reproduction: Modernity, American Life Sciences, and the Problems of Sex (University of California Press, 1998), p. 167 online. Among their proponents was the physician Edward Bliss Foote. Foote introduced his device, the womb veil, in a self-published book entitled Medical Common Sense: > This consists of an India-rubber contrivance which the female easily adjusts > in the vagina before copulation, and which spreads a thin tissue of rubber > before the mouth of the womb so as to prevent the seminal aura from > entering. ‚Ä¶ Conception cannot possibly take place when it is used. The full > enjoyment of the conjugal embrace can be indulged in during coition. The > husband would hardly be likely to know that it was being used, unless told > by the wife. ‚Ä¶ It places conception entirely under the control of the wife, > to whom it naturally belongs; for it is for her to say at what time and > under what circumstances, she will become the mother, and the moral, > religious, and physical instructress of offspring.See also discussion by > Brodie, Contraception and Abortion in Nineteenth-Century America, p. 218. Emma Goldman was among those who promoted the use of \\"womb veils\\" as contraception Foote appears to have been the first to use the term \\"womb veil\\", in introducing his vaginal diaphragm in 1863.Lee L. Bean, Geraldine P. Mineau, and Douglas L. Anderton, Fertility Change on the American Frontier: Adaptation and Innovation (University of California Press, 1990), p. 30 online; Vern L. Bullough, Science in the Bedroom: A History of Sex Research (Basic Books, 1994), p. 106 online. The explicitness of his description is regarded as \\"rather remarkable\\" for its time.Christopher Hoolihan, An Annotated Catalogue of the Edward C. Atwater Collection of American Popular Medicine and Health Reform (University of Rochester Press, 2001), vol. 1, p. 335 online. Foote touted his device as \\"the only reliable means yet discovered for the prevention of conception,\\" and sold it \\"closely sealed\\" through the mail at a cost of $6. Foote may have gotten the idea for his device from an 1838 German treatise on cervical caps, or from acquaintance with the German tradition of midwifery that had been brought to the United States.Brodie, Contraception and Abortion in Nineteenth-Century America, p. 218. Although he mentions his intention to obtain a patent, none is recorded.Michael Sappol, A Traffic of Dead Bodies: Anatomy and Embodied Social Identity in Nineteenth- Century America (Princeton University Press, 2002), p. 369. \\"Succinct, straightforward\\" advertising for birth control devices, as well as for aphrodisiacs and drugs to induce abortion and cure venereal disease, had been common in newspapers of the 1830s and 40s.Brodie, Contraception and Abortion, p. 190. But in 1873, the Comstock laws made it illegal to disseminate information about contraception.Lis Harris, Rules of Engagement: Four Couples and American Marriage Today (Simon & Schuster, 1995), p. 106 online. As Brodie, Contraception and Abortion, pp. 191‚Äì192, notes, even \\"eminently respectable\\" publications were subject to accusations. For an editorial fulmination against advertising various remedies for gonorrhea and impotence, with greater indignation directed at even the possibility of exposure to ads for condoms and womb veils (\\"this literature of sin, a fertile source of immorality\\"), see \\"Death to Quacks,\\" Toledo Medical and Surgical Journal 2 (1878), pp. 415‚Äì416 online. The following year, Foote was arrested and convicted under Comstock.John D'Emilio and Estelle B. Freedman, Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America (University of Chicago Press, 1988, 1997, 2nd ed.), p. 161 online. His pamphlets were seized and destroyed, although his descriptions of the womb veil survive in early editions of his book.Bullough, Science in the Bedroom, p. 106. In subsequent editions, he was required to cut back the section on contraception to focus on douching, usually referred to in the literature of the time as the use of syringes.As in the 1868 edition of Foote's book, p. 381. See Chesler, Woman of Valor, p. 70 online and Hoolihan, An Annotated Catalogue, pp. 335‚Äì337; also Tone, Devices and Desires, p. 62. Retailers were subjected to raids, with womb veils among the contraceptive devices confiscated.Brodie, Contraception and Abortion, p. 235; Tone, Devices and Desires, pp. 29 and 41. In March 1878, Anthony Comstock himself raided a druggist and seized an inventory that included six womb veils; another arrest netted 150. Although contraceptive information in popular media was curtailed, technical and medical journals and textbooks were not subject to this regulation, and physicians continued to discuss both issues and technologies pertaining to birth control.Katz, \\"The History of Birth Control in the United States,\\" p. 91. The early 20th century saw a resurgence of interest in birth control in the United States, due largely to the efforts of Margaret Sanger, Fania Mindell and other social activists. One of the most outspoken advocates for contraception during this time was Emma Goldman, who openly defied the Comstock laws by recommending the womb veil in leaflets she distributed after her lectures.Including Why and How the Poor Should Not Have Many Children; see Linda Gordon, The Moral Property of Women: A History of Birth Control Politics in America (University of Illinois Press, 1974, 2002), p. 148 online, and Ellen Chesler, Woman of Valor: Margaret Sanger and the Birth Control Movement in America (Simon & Schuster, 1992, 2007), p. 88. Efficacy and side effects  The womb veil, described in medical Latin as a type of pessarium occlusivum, was considered by some medical authorities to be effective if fitted and inserted correctly. Post-coital douching was often recommended in conjunction with its use.F.E. Chandler, review of Die Mittel zur Verhuetung der Conception by Jans Ferdy (Heuser, n.d.), in The Medical Times and Register 32 (1896), p. 258 online. Prolonged use of the device was reported on occasion to produce side effects, some of which pointed toward a need for better hygiene.\\"Simple erosions, such as arise from the mechanical irritation of a pessary, or from the pent-up secretions incident to the wearing of a womb-veil, are quickly cured by removing the cause and keeping the parts clean\\": David Tod Gilliam, A Text-book of Practical Gynecology (1916, 5th ed.), p. 237 online. Similar report of \\"gastric disturbance\\" that was relieved by removal of the womb veil, releasing \\"an accumulation of a creamy fluid,\\" verbal reports given 8 February 1887 as published in The American Lancet 11 (1887), p. 177 online. Serious ulcerations were reported among those who wore it too long or without proper care.Kansas Medical Journal, 23 January 1897, p. 47 online. In a report to the New Haven Medical Association, one doctor blamed the womb veil for a woman's nocturnal seizures.Medical society reports, Yale Medical Journal 7 (1900‚Äì1901), pp. 329‚Äì330 online. A gynecologist noted that the rubber womb veil might cause irritation or itching, but reckoned that the \\"opportunity for increased or unlimited intercourse\\" was the proximate cause.William A. Graham, \\"Etiology of Gynecological Disease,\\" Transactions of the Medical Society of the State of North Carolina (1902), p. 235 online. Another physician who promoted contraception as a way to avoid resorting to abortion found that some users had been disappointed in the womb veil; he recommended douching as a more effective means.O.E. Herrick, \\"Abortion and Its Lessons,\\" Michigan Medical News 5 (1882), p. 10 online. One physician found the womb veil to be \\"harmless\\" and likely \\"effectual\\" in some cases, but thought it relied too much on women knowing how to insert it correctly, with the possibility that it might become dislodged during intercourse.Chunn, \\"The Prevention of Conception,\\" p. 83 online. Concerns about displacement of the womb veil, as well as irritation and loss of pleasurable sensation, were also expressed by the author of a 1912 book on human sexuality.Joseph Richardson Parke, Human Sexuality: A Medico-Literary Treatise on the History and Pathology of the Sex Instinct for the Use of Physicians and Jurists (Philadelphia, 1912), p. 176 online. The element of unreliability was recognized in the literature distributed by Emma Goldman.Gordon, The Moral Property of Women, p. 148. Concerns about fit were addressed by offering over-the-counter womb veils labeled by size, though not in a standardized way: \\"big\\" and \\"small,\\" \\"one- size-fits-all,\\" and \\"mothers' size\\" were some of the terms used. Symptoms such as cramping, abdominal pain, ulceration, and urinary tract infections were likely to have been caused by a too-large womb veil. The risk of displacement and consequent pregnancy was increased by a veil too small. By comparison, modern diaphragms require cervical measurement and a prescription from a medical practitioner, and range in size from 50 to 95 millimeters.Tone, Devices and Desires, p. 74. Noting that \\"any preventive will fail if not applied properly,\\" the New York physician and free-love advocateRotter was the author of The Sexes and Love in Freedom and Jealousy, the Foe of Freedom; see ad in Dora Forster's Sex Radicalism: As Seen by an Emancipated Woman of the New Time (Chicago, 1905), pp. 59 and 60 online. Oscar Rotter offered these instructions: > For introduction, the woman is to sit down, so to say, on her heels, with > her legs spread apart, which will bring the womb down as low as possible. > Then taking the womb veil into the right hand with the cavity looking upward > and compressed from side to side, giving it thus the shape of an ellipse, > she has to push it up the vagina as far as it will go. It will then spread > out of its own accord and apply itself closely and firmly to the neck of the > womb.Oscar Rotter, \\"Means of Preventing Conception,\\" The Medical World 15 > (1897), pp. 151‚Äì152 online. Rotter also recommended that the veil be used in conjunction with a spermicide ointment made from muriate of quinine and vaseline.Rotter uses the lowercase form for \\"vaseline.\\" Instructions for removal and hygiene followed. Rotter was an enthusiastic if careful proponent of the womb veil. Writing in 1897, he recommended pessaries made in England as of the highest quality, with those from Germany also satisfactory. The American in his view were the most poorly made, an inferiority he blamed on the restrictive Comstock laws that drove manufacture and sale underground: \\"In England, however, where such goods are openly advertised and sold, competition tends to secure the survival of the fittest, and hence it is better to import them from that country.\\" Until legal prohibitions limiting commercial production and distribution were lessened in the 1920s, reputable companies would manufacture devices for contraception only as a discreet sideline. Small-scale entrepreneurs, not excluding black marketeers, stepped in to produce womb veils among other taboo items intended if not explicitly labeled as birth control.Tone, Devices and Desires, pp. 48‚Äì49. Among those retailers subjected to raids and confiscations was an Irishman arrested in 1881 for selling contraceptives from a one-room shop at 489 Grand Street, New York City; his seized stock included 11 womb veils; see Brodie, Contraception and Abortion, p. 235. For women too poor to buy quality contraception, Rotter also described how to make a homemade device from a rubber ball.Rotter, \\"Means of Preventing Conception,\\" pp. 151‚Äì152. Moral and racialist aspects The Comstock ban on advertising contraceptive devices, which included womb veils, was not intended to protect consumers from false claims of efficacy, but from exposure to indecency. One editorial writer specifically asserted that even if the ads made true statements, the \\"anger and indignation of respectable people\\" at finding such products in their daily newspaper would be grounds to ban them.Unsigned editorial, Saint Paul Medical Journal 3 (1901), p. 687 online. At Foote's trial, Anthony Comstock himself testified that the womb veil was \\"an instrument of death both moral and physical to the youth of the land.\\"Janice Ruth Wood, The Struggle for Free Speech in the United States, 1872‚Äì1915: Edward Bliss Foote, Edward Bond Foote, and Anti-Comstock Operations (Routledge, 2008), p. 67 online. The use of womb veils, like other forms of contraception, was thus subject to moral condemnation. In his Ladies' Guide in Health and Disease, John Harvey Kellogg asserted several legitimate reasons for family planning, but considered womb veils and other technological forms of birth control to be harmful both physically and psychologically, causing women to lose \\"all respect for the sacredness of the maternal function.\\"John Harvey Kellogg, Ladies' Guide in Health and Disease: Girlhood, Maidenhood, Wifehood, Motherhood (Battle Creek, Michigan, 1901), pp. 345‚Äì351, on womb veils p. 349 online. The author of a Hand-book to Obstetrics (1908) opined: > I think there is a growing distaste for the family duties among women ‚Ä¶ that > should be condemned. The efforts of women to equal man in studies, work, > etc., while still claiming their sex privileges, with the dissolution of > club and society life, are leading to a 'race suicide.' This ought not to > be. Woman is anatomically, physiologically, and emotionally evolved for one > sole and single purpose, any departure therefrom being done at the violation > of her best ideals and a misdirection of energy.Rawlins Cadwallader, Hand- > book of Obstetrics (1908), p. 260. The author finds the rhythm method ineffective, since \\"for the female, rut and menstruation are the same.\\" He further disapproves of withdrawal, warning that the latter would lead to \\"nervous collapse\\" and noting that \\"it is infinitely worse than masturbation.\\"Cadwallader, Hand-book of Obstetrics, p. 260. Kellogg had also compared birth control measures to \\"self-abuse\\" (p. 351). The perceived immorality of contraceptive devices was linked to the fear that they might enhance sexual pleasure; like masturbation, the use of womb veils, condoms, and other appliances might \\"heighten the feeling,\\" but \\"there is no contact of the parts, and it is morally pernicious and degrading.\\" Because these devices removed the fear of conception, they were said to foster a \\"positive invitation to illicit intercourse.\\"Cadwallader, Hand-book of Obstetrics, p. 261. Although in general douching was more acceptable,Cadwallader, Hand-book of Obstetrics, p. 261; Herrick, \\"Abortion and Its Lessons,\\" p. 10. even ads for \\"syringes\\" could be condemned as being \\"as hurtful to public morals and children's education as if they advertised condoms and womb veils.\\"John F. Edgar, \\"Correspondence: The Way of the Irregular, of Any School of Practice, Is Full of Chaos and Boomerangs,\\" \\"The Medical Forum: A Monthly Journal Devoted to the Interests of the Medical Profession 2 (1905), p. 329 online. Although birth control was sometimes advocated as a way for the poor to manage their resources better by limiting the size of their family, it could also be promoted for controlling social groups seen as inferior.On race, class, modernity, and urbanization as factors in perceptions of birth control, see Katz, \\"The History of Birth Control in the United States,\\" passim; Tone, Devices and Desires, p. 145ff. More broadly on the subject of eugenics, feminism, and race, see Gordon, The Moral Property of Women, p. 80ff. Observing that a couple \\"swept away by passion\\" might not think to take precautions such as inserting a womb veil, and that \\"the least intelligent\\" such as \\"the rough workman or dull peasant\\" would be most likely not to exercise self-control, one medical writer advocated intrauterine devices that could be left in place \\"if we wish to breed up not down.\\"Robert L. Dickinson, \\"Simple Sterilization of Women by Cautery Stricture at the Intra-Uterine Tubal Openings, Compared with Other Methods,\\" Surgery, Gynecology, and Obstetrics 23 (1916), p. 204 online. Anxieties about \\"race suicide\\"Cadwallader, Hand-book of Obstetrics, p. 260 online. also framed opposition to birth control. The average number of births among white married couples is estimated to have dropped by nearly half between 1800 and 1900.Katz, \\"The History of Birth Control in the United States,\\" p. 82. Womb veils were pointed to in racially charged rhetoric warning that contraception threatened the white, specifically Anglo-Saxon, fertility rate. A Missouri physician blamed gynecology as a medical specialty for teaching \\"young ladies how to avoid conception,\\" claiming that \\"syringes, sponges,Inserted sponges have been used as barrier contraception since antiquity, when they were often saturated with a fluid, commonly vinegar, aimed at creating an environment less hospitable for fertilization. The sponge was one of the first methods of contraception recommended in printed informational tracts, appearing as early as 1797. See Brodie, Contraception and Abortion, p. 212. and womb-veils will exterminate the descendants of the Mayflower.\\"\\"Dr. George W. Dewey of Moberly District, Mo., thus forcibly descants on some of the delusions of the day,\\" The Medical Record 14 August 1886, p. 196 online. An editorial in a 1906 issue of Texas Medical Journal asserted that if all physicians were \\"both civic and Christian gentlemen\\"See also Christian views on contraception. > we should have no criminal abortion cases, no womb veils, no tubes with > buttons to close the os,This phrase may be engimatic to the 21st-century > reader; the os refers to the opening of the uterus, and tubes were part of > the syringe apparatus that was standard for an obstetric medical bag; see > Robert Banres, Lectures on Obstetric Operations (London, 1871), p. 6 online. > The closing of the os here, however, seems to mean a measure taken to > prevent conception; a procedure that sounds similar is described as an > alternative to hysterectomy in The American Journal of the Medical Sciences > (August 1897), pp. 257‚Äì258 online. and the Anglo-Saxon race, instead of > being in a decadent condition, would rise in its birth rate and not leave > the race problem to the Latin-Teutonic and colored race.J.P.

In fact, indications are that black Americans also practiced family planning to a comparable degree in the post-slavery period, and several factors seem to have influenced a desire for smaller families among various demographic groups in the 19th century.Katz, \\"The History of Birth Control in the United States,\\" p. 86 et passim.

Plot In the Italian town of Assisi during World War II, 300 Jews were sheltered and protected by a peasant turned priest, Father Rufino Niccacci. He dressed many of them as monks and nuns, taught them Catholic ritual, and hid them in the monasteries. Others lived in parishioners' homes and, with fake identity cards, found jobs and blended into the community. The town's printing press, which during the day printed posters and greeting cards, at night clandestinely printed false documents that were sent by courier to Jews all over Italy. Not a single refugee was captured in Assisi. No one who participated in the rescue operation ever betrayed it. The operation was aided by the German Commandant of the city, Colonel Valentin M√ºller, a Catholic, who had been persuaded by Father Rufino that he had been sent to the town not only by the German High Command, but also by God, with the mission of protecting the Christian holy places and monasteries. M√ºller appealed to Marshal Kesselring to declare Assisi an open city. When the Allies began approaching the city, one of the Jewish refugees, whose German was so excellent that he had gotten a job with the Wehrmacht, forged a letter from Kesselring declaring Assisi an open city. The colonel never suspected it to be a forgery and immediately ordered all German troops to leave town, thus saving Assisi from destruction. The Author Alexander Ramati, a polish Jew, was one of the first war correspondents to enter Assisi after the Germans had been driven out. Inspired by his meeting with Father Rufino, he set out to tell the story of the Underground from the priest's point of view. In the years after the war, Ramati interviewed Father Rufino. The book was published in 1978. Film Version A film version of the novel was released in 1985, starring Ben Cross as Father Rufino. Alfredo Pea played Giro d'Italia and Tour de France-winning cyclist Gino Bartali, a courier for the underground. Sources Ramati, Alexander. The Assisi Underground. New York: Stein and Day, 1978.

The series was produced by Temple Street Productions in association with Family. It stars Demetrius Joyette and Dylan Everett. This show included guest-stars from other Family Channel shows such as The Latest Buzz. It was announced that the series was renewed for a third season on June 13, 2011. Family announced that the series is not planned for a fourth season.  Plot  Wingin' It is a family series about a friendship. One half of the friendship is Porter Jackson a centuries-old angel-in-training (AIT) who has been sent to Earth to get his angel wings posing as a carefree sixteen-year-old student. The other half is Carl Montclaire, a fifteen-year-old typical high school kid who has been going through a run of bad luck. Little things seem to always be going wrong in Carl's life. For Porter to get his angel wings, he's been given the assignment of making Carl the most popular kid at Bennett High. In season 3, Jane knows that Porter is an angel-in-training and helps him through the various problems he has with his magic.  Cast and characters = Main  *Dylan Everett as Carl Montclaire ‚Äì Porter's task of making Carl Montclaire the most popular student in school looks like a lost cause at first. Carl is not particularly popular and very unlucky. But with Porter's help he becomes more appreciated by winning a basketball tournament, starring in the school play and hosting his own radio show, among other things. Carl is interested in girls and in the first series he has a crush on the beautiful but unintelligent Brittany. But he never has proper feelings for her, whereas in the second series he has a much bigger crush on Jane, who was previously just his best friend, following their kiss in the school play featured in Drama-rama at the end of Season 1. At the end of the second series Carl figures out that Jane prefers Porter, and is very depressed for a while afterwards, when he admits to himself and to Jane that their relationship can't go anywhere. At the end of that episode, a rejected Carl is seen brooding over the future. He then shares a kiss with Denise in the final moments of that episode, and when the season resumes, he has returned to being only friends with Jane and being out with Denise, although that is strictly prohibited. This does not stop them, however, until Mildred Stern, comes down to investigate, after being tipped off by Denise's ex-boyfriend, Lex. In the third season his feelings for Jane return, she reciprocates, and they begin to date. *Demetrius Joyette as Porter Jackson ‚Äì Porter Jackson is a few centuries old AIT that is also a bit of a troublemaker. In heaven he's a very powerful angel with infinite magic coursing through him as told by Dr. Cassabi in one of the episodes. He's naturally popular and a cool guy. Porter boasts that he could make any kid popular, but in Carl Montclaire, it looks like he may have met his match. He himself is a prankster and popular, up above. However, thanks to him Carl's popularity increases, although he has not yet become popular enough for Porter to be granted his angel wings. Despite helping Carl in his attempts to ask out Jane in season 2, it is revealed in Magical Kiss-Tery Tour that he also has affections for Jane, forcing Carl into a difficult decision. When the series resumes, there has thus far been no sign of the Porter-Jane relationship reappearing. In the episode \\"Live and Let Fly\\" Porter becomes a full angel but because he completed his assignment, he was forced to leave Carl. *Wayne Thomas Yorke as Dr. J. Bartholomew Cassabi ‚Äì Posing as Bennett High's guidance counsellor, Dr Cassabi is actually an AIT advisor. He assists Porter and later Denise when things go wrong, which is regular. *Kendra Timmins as Denise Simmons (previously Dennis) ‚Äì Dr. Cassabi's living raccoon puppet who acts as his helper and occasional spy. Dennis was actually a former AIT named Denise who accidentally trapped herself in the raccoon puppet back in the 15th century. Porter manages to release Denise from the raccoon puppet in season 2. Denise quickly becomes Porter's female counterpart ‚Äì like Porter, she is a trouble maker who has a tendency to misuse her magic, and is very good at getting into trouble. Denise is also a good singer. She has affections for Carl which can be noticed throughout the season, although they are only returned at the end of season 2.1. When the season resumes Denise and Carl are dating, although this is complicated by the rules against angel-human relationships. Matt Ficner and Mike Petersen portray Denise as Dennis the raccoon. In the episode, \\"Live and Let Fly\\", Brittany becomes her angel assignment. *Brittany Adams as Jane Casey ‚Äì Jane is the smartest kid in school and not self-conscious about it. She's always looking for a new club to join and leads many of them, including the school newspaper. She is pro-active and not only writes the school play in season one but also picks the cast and eventually stars in it herself. She and Carl have been best friends since kindergarten, and she and Brittany become friends in season 2.1. She is unaware of Carl's true feelings for her in season 2.1, and doesn't know that she is hurting his feelings when she kisses Porter in Magical Kiss-tery Tour. She only finds out afterwards, and feels guilty and slightly depressed about the romantic triangle. However, upon the resumption of the series, the Jane- Porter relationship does not rematerialise, and Carl has also got over his previous feelings for Jane. In the second-season finale she witnesses Porter performing magic, and Porter and Denise reveal to her that they are A.I.T's. She is shown to have developed feelings for Carl in 'Practical Romance'. *Brian Alexander White as Alejandro \\"Alex\\" Horatio P. Rodriguez ‚Äì As Jane and Carl say, the only thing you can say about their Mexican, Swahili-speaking, Unicorn-loving friend is 'he's Alex'. He rarely has a major role in episodes and tends to be there for comedic value only, such as when he is Carl's gag man in 'Montclaire on the Air'. *Sebastian Hearn as Serge Delvecchio ‚Äì Originally a bully to Carl, Serge becomes more like a friend, although he can turn it on and off. He is the best athlete at Bennett High, but he's not exactly the sharpest tool in the box. He speaks as himself in a third person. He is a useful pawn, and shows a slightly more emotional side in 'I Carlie' when he starts crushing on Carl's girl form, Carlie. *Hannah Lochner as Brittany Hanson ‚Äì Brittany is popular for no apparent reason other than that she is beautiful. Although she aspires to be a famous singer, she is untalented in that area and is actually better suited to acting. She and Jane become friends in season 2.1. In the episode, \\"Live and Let Fly\\", she becomes Denise's angel assignment. *Jennifer Robertson as Angela Montclaire ‚Äì As Carl's mom, she can be embarrassing and patronising but cares deeply for her son. *Jamie Bloch as Becky Montclaire ‚Äì As Carl's sister, she claims that her job is to wind up Carl, although as her mum points out in \\"Basket Case\\", she does seem to work overtime.  Recurring  *Steven Morel as Principal Malone ‚Äì Bennett High's fun but fair principal, he is a bit cheesy at times and plays the ukulele, he is also desperate to get a new car. *Jennifer Parsons as Mrs. Lennox ‚Äì Bennett High's flighty English/Drama teacher. She finds out about the AI.Ts in 'School Spirit', but when the timeline was erased she returns to being clueless again. *Matt Baram as Mr. Dolby ‚Äì Bennett High's nerdy and slightly eccentric Science teacher. *Eugene Clark as Coach Heinrich ‚Äì Bennett High's high-strung and competitive Gym teacher. *Denis Akiyama as Mr. Nakamora ‚Äì Bennett High's shifty Math teacher. *Pat McKenna as Mr. Telson ‚Äì Bennett High's eternally angry History teacher who shouts at people for no good reason and apparently \\"Hates everyone equally\\". *Emma Gibbs as Melissa ‚Äì Always looking to be included and always eager to please. She has feelings for Serge and starts dating him in the last episode of Season 3. *Naomi Snieckus as Mildred Stern ‚Äì Heaven's uber strict bureaucrat. *Caitlyn Piotrowski and Katrina Mahoney as The Listern Sisters ‚Äì Bennett High's resident spooky duo. They seldom speak and are a general mystery to the rest of the students; they even creep the angels out. In the episode, \\"Live and Let Fly\\", they are revealed to be angels watching over Porter, and stay after he leaves (presumably to watch over Denise.) Their creepy appearance is revealed to be a disguise, and they are actually pretty in their real state.  Production  The series is produced by Temple Street Productions and BBC Worldwide Sales & Distribution in association with Family Channel. Season One started filming in mid-2009 and ended in late October. A total of 13 twenty-five-minute episodes have been produced for series one.

For example, when a set of v by [S] curves from an enzyme with a ping‚Äìpong mechanism (varying substrate A, fixed substrate B) are plotted in a Lineweaver‚ÄìBurk plot, a set of parallel lines will be produced. The following Michaelis‚ÄìMenten equation relates the initial reaction rate v0 to the substrate concentrations [A] and [B]: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{1}{v_0} &= \\\\frac{ K_M^A}{v_\\\\max {[}A{]}}+\\\\frac{ K_M^B}{v_\\\\max {[}B{]}}+\\\\frac{1}{v_\\\\max} \\\\end{align} The y-intercept of this equation is equal to the following: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mbox{y-intercept} = \\\\frac{ K_M^B}{v_\\\\max {[}B{]}}+\\\\frac{1}{v_\\\\max} \\\\end{align} The y-intercept is determined at several different fixed concentrations of substrate B (and varying substrate A). The y-intercept values are then plotted versus 1/[B] to determine the Michaelis constant for substrate B, K_M^B, as shown in the Figure to the right.The Horseradish Peroxidase/ o-Phenylenediamine (HRP/OPD) System Exhibits a Two-Step Mechanism. M. K. Tiama and T. M. Hamilton, Journal of Undergraduate Chemistry Research, 4, 1 (2005). The slope is equal to K_M^B divided by v_\\\\max and the intercept is equal to 1 over v_\\\\max. Secondary Plot of enzyme system Horseradish Peroxidase and o-Phenylenediamine (with hydrogen peroxide as the second substrate) Secondary plot in inhibition studies A secondary plot may also be used to find a specific inhbition constant, KI. For a competitive enzyme inhibitor, the apparent Michaelis constant is equal to the following: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mbox{apparent } K_m=K_m\\\\times \\\\left(1+\\\\frac{[I]}{K_I}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} The slope of the Lineweaver-Burk plot is therefore equal to: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mbox{slope} =\\\\frac{K_m}{v_\\\\max}\\\\times \\\\left(1+\\\\frac{[I]}{K_I}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} If one creates a secondary plot consisting of the slope values from several Lineweaver-Burk plots of varying inhibitor concentration [I], the competitive inhbition constant may be found. The slope of the secondary plot divided by the intercept is equal to 1/KI. This method allows one to find the KI constant, even when the Michaelis constant and vmax values are not known.

A specialist of hepatotoxicity, he held various administrative position at Universit√© de Montr√©al from 1968 to 1989, receiving the grade of professor emeritus upon his retirement in 1996. Over the course of his career he was president of several scientific society and served in editorial capacity for numerous scientific journals. Amongst many awards, he was the first recipient of the Society of Toxicology's (SOT) Achievement Award, an award granted to a \\"promising young scientist\\". Biography Plaa was born in San Francisco on May 15, 1930, the son of Jean and Lucienne Plaa, who were Basque French immigrants. He graduated from the University of California in 1952 with a bachelor's degree in criminalistics. The previous year he had married his wife, Colleen Neva; the couple would have eight children. After a brief interlude during which he served in Korea with the U.S. Army Reserve, he returned to complete graduate studies. Unable to obtain a stipend, he was offered to reorient toward pharmacology and toxicology, which he did, earning his M.Sc. in 1956 and his Ph.D. in 1958.Although all sources agree about his degrees, they are unclear or conflicting as to which exactly of the components of the USC system (specifically San Francisco or Berkeley) granted them. Plaa went to teach at Tulane University, then the University of Iowa, before in 1968 he was hired by Universit√© de Montr√©al (UdeM) as Chairman of the Department of Pharmacology, a young promising scientist who the previous year had become the first recipient of the newly created Achievement Award of the American Society of Toxicology. At UdeM he would hold a succession of positions in addition to his teaching and research (He remained Chairman of the Department of Pharmacology until 1980.): Vice- Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies (1979-1982) and Vice Dean for research and graduate studies of the Faculty of Medicine (1982-1989).Several sources confuse these two positions and cite a \\"Vice-Dean of Research and Graduate Studies\\" appointment. Such a position never existed at UdeM. From 1990 to his retirement, he was director of the Montreal-based Centre Interuniversitaire de Recherche en Toxicologie. Plaa's appointment did not end with UdeM. He also served as president of the Society of Toxicology of Canada (STC; 1981-1983), then the SOT in 1983-84, as well as the Pharmacological Society of Canada.The Pharmacological Society of Canada was a predecessor of the modern Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics. He sat on a number of scientific committees and was chairman of the IUPHAR's toxicology section. He was editor or associate editor of the Canadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology, Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology, the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, and a member of the editorial board of several more. Amongst the many awards he received are the SOT's Merit Award (the Society's highest), Arnold Lehman, and Education Awards, while from the STC he received the V.E. Henderson Award and the STC Award of Distinction. In 2003, on the occasion of UdeM's 125th anniversary, the institution recognized Dr. Plaa by giving the title of \\"Pioneer\\" of the institution. After his retirement, Plaa spent most of his time at home with his wife, who suffers from multiple sclerosis. He died from cancer on November 11, 2009. Research and legacy Plaa's primary area of research was hepatotoxicity, in which his successes where achieved primarily by the investigation of mechanistic toxicology. His primary contributions were in the areas of cholestasis and toxic potentiation, in particular potentiation by haloalkanes. Although the use of the isolated perfused liver was already well-known, having been first used in the early 19th century, Plaa was the first to use it for the study of hepatotoxicity. A long-time career goal for him was to elaborate methods to determine human hepatotoxicity (and particularly cholestasis-inducing abilities in drugs) from animal tests; although this endeavour was never a success, it led to a much improved understanding of the mechanisms of cholestasis. According to Plaa, much of his mechanisms- and protocols-oriented research was an effect of his original formation in criminalistics. Plaa's scientific career led to the publication of 233 peer-reviewed articles bearing his name, as well as 48 book chapters and literature reviews. He directed over thirty Master's and Ph.D. students, of which two themselves received the SOT Achievement Award, and six served as president of the Society. The UdeM Department of Pharmacology annual internal conference (Journ√©es de la recherche) is named after Dr. Plaa, as is an endowed fund of the SOT.

There are two major types of market entry modes: equity and non-equity. The non-equity modes category includes export and contractual agreements.Peng, W. Mike., (2008) Global Business. Cengage Learning, The equity modes category includes joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiaries.P, W. Mike., (2008) Global Business Cengage Learning, Different entry modes differ in three crucial aspects: * The degree of risk they present. * The control and commitment of resources they require. * The return on investment they promise.McDonald, F.; Burton, F.; Dowling, P. (2002), International Business, Cengage Learning EMEA, Exporting Exporting is the process of selling of goods and services produced in one country to other countries.Yadong, L. (1999), Entry and Cooperative Strategies in International Business Expansion Age, Greenwood Publishing Group, There are two types of exporting: direct and indirect. Direct Exports Direct exports represent the most basic mode of exporting made by a (holding) company, capitalizing on economies of scale in production concentrated in the home country and affording better control over distribution. Direct export works the best if the volumes are small. Large volumes of export may trigger protectionism. The main characteristic of direct exports entry model is that there are no intermediaries. Passive exports represent the treating and filling overseas orders like domestic orders. =Types= ;Sales representatives: Sales representatives represent foreign suppliers/manufacturers in their local markets for an established commission on sales. Provide support services to a manufacturer regarding local advertising, local sales presentations, customs clearance formalities, legal requirements. Manufacturers of highly technical services or products such as production machinery, benefit the most from sales representation. ;Importing distributors: Importing distributors purchase product in their own right and resell it in their local markets to wholesalers, retailers, or both. Importing distributors are a good market entry strategy for products that are carried in inventory, such as toys, appliances, prepared food.Reynolds, F. (2003), Managing Exports: navigating the complex rules, controls, barriers, and laws. Age, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., =Advantages= *Control over a selection of foreign markets and choice of foreign representative company *Good information feedback from target market, developing better relationships with the buyers *Better protection of trademarks, patents, goodwill, and other intangible property *Potentially greater sales, and therefore greater profit, than with indirect exporting.Yoshino, M. Y.; Rang an, U. S. (1995), Strategic alliances: an entrepreneurial approach to globalization, Harvard Business Press =Disadvantages= *Higher start-up costs and higher risks as opposed to indirect exporting *Requires higher investments of time, resources and personnel and also organizational changes *Greater information requirements *Longer time-to-market as opposed to indirect exporting.Foley, J. (1999), The Global Entrepreneur: taking your business international Age, Dearborn. Indirect exports Indirect export is the process of exporting through domestically based export intermediaries. The exporter has no control over its products in the foreign market. =Types= ;Export trading companies (ETCs): These provide support services of the entire export process for one or more suppliers. Attractive to suppliers that are not familiar with exporting as ETCs usually perform all the necessary work: locate overseas trading partners, present the product, quote on specific enquiries, etc. ;Export management companies (EMCs): These are similar to ETCs in the way that they usually export for producers. Unlike ETCs, they rarely take on export credit risks and carry one type of product, not representing competing ones. Usually, EMCs trade on behalf of their suppliers as their export departments.Foley, J. (1999), The Global Entrepreneur: taking your business international Age, Dearborn, ;Export merchants: Export merchants are wholesale companies that buy unpackaged products from suppliers/manufacturers for resale overseas under their own brand names. The advantage of export merchants is promotion. One of the disadvantages for using export merchants result in presence of identical products under different brand names and pricing on the market, meaning that export merchant's activities may hinder manufacturer's exporting efforts. ;Confirming houses: These are intermediate sellers that work for foreign buyers. They receive the product requirements from their clients, negotiate purchases, make delivery, and pay the suppliers/manufacturers. An opportunity here arises in the fact that if the client likes the product it may become a trade representative. A potential disadvantage includes supplier's unawareness and lack of control over what a confirming house does with their product. ;Nonconforming purchasing agents: These are similar to confirming houses with the exception that they do not pay the suppliers directly ‚Äì payments take place between a supplier/manufacturer and a foreign buyer.Salomon, Robert (2006), Learning from Exporting: New Insights, New Perspectives, Edward Elgar Publishing Limited =Advantages= *Fast market access *Concentration of resources towards production *Little or no financial commitment as the clients' exports usually covers most expenses associated with international sales. *Low risk exists for companies who consider their domestic market to be more important and for companies that are still developing their R&D;, marketing, and sales strategies. *Export management is outsourced, alleviating pressure from management team *No direct handle of export processes.Peng, Mike W. (2009), Global Business, Mason: South-Western College Pub =Disadvantages= *Little or no control over distribution, sales, marketing, etc. as opposed to direct exporting *Wrong choice of distributor, and by effect, market, may lead to inadequate market feedback affecting the international success of the company *Potentially lower sales as compared to direct exporting (although low volume can be a key aspect of successfully exporting directly). Export partners that incorrectly select a specific distributor/market may hinder a firm's functional ability.Evans, Rachael (2005), Report on a turnkey project for Apple‚Äôs iPod in Nigeria, Maryland: University of Maryland University College Companies that seriously consider international markets as a crucial part of their success would likely consider direct exporting as the market entry tool. Indirect exporting is preferred by companies who would want to avoid financial risk as a threat to their other goals. Licensing An international licensing agreement allows foreign firms, either exclusively or non-exclusively to manufacture a proprietor's product for a fixed term in a specific market. In this foreign market entry mode, a licensor in the home country makes limited rights or resources available to the licensee in the host country. The rights or resources may include patents, trademarks, managerial skills, technology, and others that can make it possible for the licensee to manufacture and sell in the host country a similar product to the one the licensor has already been producing and selling in the home country without requiring the licensor to open a new operation overseas. The licensor earnings usually take forms of one time payments, technical fees and royalty payments usually calculated as a percentage of sales. As in this mode of entry the transference of knowledge between the parental company and the licensee is strongly present, the decision of making an international license agreement depend on the respect the host government show for intellectual property and on the ability of the licensor to choose the right partners and avoid them to compete in each other market. Licensing is a relatively flexible work agreement that can be customized to fit the needs and interests of both, licensor and licensee. Following are the main advantages and reasons to use an international licensing for expanding internationally: *Obtain extra income for technical know-how and services *Reach new markets not accessible by export from existing facilities *Quickly expand without much risk and large capital investment *Pave the way for future investments in the market *Retain established markets closed by trade restrictions *Political risk is minimized as the licensee is usually 100% locally owned *Is highly attractive for companies that are new in international business. On the other hand, international licensing is a foreign market entry mode that presents some disadvantages and reasons why companies should not use it as: *Lower income than in other entry modes *Loss of control of the licensee manufacture and marketing operations and practices leading to loss of quality *Risk of having the trademark and reputation ruined by an incompetent partner *The foreign partner can also become a competitor by selling its production in places where the parental company is already in. Franchising The franchising system can be defined as: \\"A system in which semi-independent business owners (franchisees) pay fees and royalties to a parent company (franchiser) in return for the right to become identified with its trademark, to sell its products or services, and often to use its business format and system.\\" Franchising is one form of Licensing. Zimmerer, T. W.; Scarborough, N. M. (2008), Essentials of Entrepreneurship and Small Business Management, New Jersey: Pearson Prentice Hall, Compared to licensing, franchising agreements tends to be longer and the franchisor offers a broader package of rights and resources which usually includes: equipment, managerial systems, operation manual, initial trainings, site approval and all the support necessary for the franchisee to run its business in the same way it is done by the franchisor. In addition to that, while a licensing agreement involves things such as intellectual property, trade secrets and others while in franchising it is limited to trademarks and operating know-how of the business.Hoy, F.; Stanworth, J. (2003), Franchising: an international perspective, Routledge Advantages of the international franchising mode: *Low political risk *Low cost *Allows simultaneous expansion into different regions of the world *Well selected partners bring financial investment as well as managerial capabilities to the operation. Disadvantages of franchising to the franchisor:Cavusgil, T.; Knight, G.;Riesenberger, J. (2008), International Business - Strategy, Management and the New Realities, Pearson *Maintaining control over franchisee may be difficult *Conflicts with franchisee are likely, including legal disputes *Preserving franchisor's image in the foreign market may be challenging *Requires monitoring and evaluating performance of franchisees, and providing ongoing assistance *Franchisees may take advantage of acquired knowledge and become competitors in the future  Turnkey projects  A turnkey project refers to a project when clients pay contractors to design and construct new facilities and train personnel. A turnkey project is a way for a foreign company to export its process and technology to other countries by building a plant in that country. Industrial companies that specialize in complex production technologies normally use turnkey projects as an entry strategy.Peng, Mike W. (2009), Global Business, Mason: South-Western College Pub One of the major advantages of turnkey projects is the possibility for a company to establish a plant and earn profits in a foreign country especially in which foreign direct investment opportunities are limited and lack of expertise in a specific area exists. Potential disadvantages of a turnkey project for a company include risk of revealing companies secrets to rivals, and takeover of their plant by the host country. Entering a market with a turnkey project CAN prove that a company has no long-term interest in the country which can become a disadvantage if the country proves to be the main market for the output of the exported process.Evans, Rachael (2005), Report on a turnkey project for Apple‚Äôs iPod in Nigeria, Maryland: University of Maryland University College, http://globalitek.homestead.com/Rachael_- _Turnkey_projects_Nigeria_and_iPod.pdf Wholly owned subsidiaries (WOS) A wholly owned subsidiary includes two types of strategies: Greenfield investment and Acquisitions. Greenfield investment and acquisition include both advantages and disadvantages. To decide which entry modes to use is depending on situations. Greenfield investment is the establishment of a new wholly owned subsidiary. It is often complex and potentially costly, but it is able to provide full control to the firm and has the most potential to provide above average return.Hitt, A. (2009), Strategic Management Competitiveness and Globalization, Nelson Education Ltd, \\"Wholly owned subsidiaries and expatriate staff are preferred in service industries where close contact with end customers and high levels of professional skills, specialized know how, and customization are required.\\"Hitt, A. (2009), Strategic Management Competitiveness and Globalization, Nelson Education Ltd, Greenfield investment is more likely preferred where physical capital intensive plants are planned.Hitt, A. (2009), Strategic Management Competitiveness and Globalization, Nelson Education Ltd, This strategy is attractive if there are no competitors to buy or the transfer competitive advantages that consists of embedded competencies, skills, routines, and culture.Bartett, C.A. (2009), Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross-Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education, Greenfield investment is high risk due to the costs of establishing a new business in a new country.Bartett, C.A. (2009), Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross-Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education, A firm may need to acquire knowledge and expertise of the existing market by third parties, such consultant, competitors, or business partners. This entry strategy takes much more time due to the need of establishing new operations, distribution networks, and the necessity to learn and implement appropriate marketing strategies to compete with rivals in a new market.Bartett, C.A., Ghoshal, S. and Beamish, P. (2008) Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross-Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education Acquisition has become a popular mode of entering foreign markets mainly due to its quick accessHitt, A. (2009), Strategic Management Competitiveness and Globalization, Nelson Education Ltd, Acquisition strategy offers the fastest, and the largest, initial international expansion of any of the alternative. Acquisition has been increasing because it is a way to achieve greater market power. The market share usually is affected by market power. Therefore, many multinational corporations apply acquisitions to achieve their greater market power, which require buying a competitor, a supplier, a distributor, or a business in highly related industry to allow exercise of a core competency and capture competitive advantage in the market.Hitt, A. (2009), Strategic Management Competitiveness and Globalization, Nelson Education Ltd, Acquisition is lower risk than Greenfield investment because of the outcomes of an acquisition can be estimated more easily and accurately.Bartett, C.A. (2009), Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross-Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education, In overall, acquisition is attractive if there are well established firms already in operations or competitors want to enter the region. On the other hand, there are many disadvantages and problems in achieving acquisition success. *Integrating two organizations can be quite difficult due to different organization cultures, control system, and relationships.Hitt, A. (2009), Strategic Management Competitiveness and Globalization, Nelson Education Ltd, Integration is a complex issue, but it is one of the most important things for organizations. *By applying acquisitions, some companies significantly increased their levels of debt which can have negative effects on the firms because high debt may cause bankruptcy.Hitt, A. (2009), Strategic Management Competitiveness and Globalization, Nelson Education Ltd, *Too much diversification may cause problems.Hitt, A. (2009), Strategic Management Competitiveness and Globalization, Nelson Education Ltd, Even when a firm is not too over diversified, a high level of diversification can have a negative effect on the firm in the long-term performance due to a lack of management of diversification. Difference between international strategy and global strategy However, some industries benefit more from globalization than do others, and some nations have a comparative advantage over other nations in certain industries. To create a successful global strategy, managers first must understand the nature of global industries and the dynamics of global competition, international strategy (i.e. internationally scattered subsidiaries act independently and operate as if they were local companies, with minimum coordination from the parent company) and global strategy (leads to a wide variety of business strategies, and a high level of adaptation to the local business environment). Basically there are three key differences between them. Firstly, it relates to the degree of involvement and coordination from the Centre. Moreover, the difference relates to the degree of product standardization and responsiveness to local business environment. The last is that difference has to do with strategy integration and competitive moves. Joint venture There are five common objectives in a joint venture: market entry, risk/reward sharing, technology sharing and joint product development, and conforming to the government regulations. Other benefits include political connections and distribution channel access that may depend on relationships.Foley, J. (1999), The Global Entrepreneur: taking your business international Age, Dearborn, Such alliances often are favourable when: *The partners' strategic goals converge while their competitive goals diverge *The partners' size, market power, and resources are small compared to the Industry leaders *Partners are able to learn from one another while limiting access to their own proprietary skills The key issues to consider in a joint venture are ownership, control, length of agreement, pricing, technology transfer, local firm capabilities and resources, and government intentions. Potential problems include:Foley, J. (1999), The Global Entrepreneur: taking your business international Age, Dearborn, *Conflict over asymmetric new investments *Mistrust over proprietary knowledge *Performance ambiguity - how to split the pie *Lack of parent firm support *Cultural clashes *If, how, and when to terminate the relationship Joint ventures have conflicting pressures to cooperate and compete:Foley, J. (1999), The Global Entrepreneur: taking your business international Age, Dearborn, *Strategic imperative: the partners want to maximize the advantage gained for the joint venture, but they also want to maximize their own competitive position. *The joint venture attempts to develop shared resources, but each firm wants to develop and protect its own proprietary resources. *The joint venture is controlled through negotiations and coordination processes, while each firm would like to have hierarchical control. Strategic alliance strategic alliance is a type of cooperative agreements between different firms, such as shared research, formal joint ventures, or minority equity participation.Bartett, C.A. (2009), Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross-Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education, The modern form of strategic alliances is becoming increasingly popular and has three distinguishing characteristics:Bartett, C.A. (2009), Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross-Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education, #They are frequently between firms in industrialized nations. #The focus is often on creating new products and/or technologies rather than distributing existing ones. #They are often only created for short term duration, non equity based agreement in which companies are separated and are independent. Advantages Some advantages of a strategic alliance include:Bartett, C.A. (2009), Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross-Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education, ;Technology exchange: This is a major objective for many strategic alliances. The reason for this is that many breakthroughs and major technological innovations are based on interdisciplinary and/or inter- industrial advances. Because of this, it is increasingly difficult for a single firm to possess the necessary resources or capabilities to conduct their own effective R&D; efforts. This is also perpetuated by shorter product life cycles and the need for many companies to stay competitive through innovation. Some industries that have become centers for extensive cooperative agreements are: :*Telecommunications :*Electronics :*Pharmaceuticals :*Information technology :*Specialty chemicals ;Global competition: There is a growing perception that global battles between corporations be fought between teams of players aligned in strategic partnerships.Bartett, C.A. (2009), Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross-Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education, Strategic alliances will become key tools for companies if they want to remain competitive in this globalized environment, particularly in industries that have dominant leaders, such as cell phone manufactures, where smaller companies need to ally in order to remain competitive. ;Industry convergence: As industries converge and the traditional lines between different industrial sectors blur, strategic alliances are sometimes the only way to develop the complex skills necessary in the time frame required. Alliances become a way of shaping competition by decreasing competitive intensity, excluding potential entrants, and isolating players, and building complex value chains that can act as barriers.Bartett, C.A. (2009), Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross- Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education, ;Economies of scale and reduction of risk: Pooling resources can contribute greatly to economies of scale, and smaller companies especially can benefit greatly from strategic alliances in terms of cost reduction because of increased economies of scale. In terms on risk reduction, in strategic alliances no one firm bears the full risk, and cost of, a joint activity. This is extremely advantageous to businesses involved in high risk / cost activities such as R&D.; This is also advantageous to smaller organizations which are more affected by risky activities. ;Alliance as an alternative to merger: Some industry sectors have constraints to cross-border mergers and acquisitions, strategic alliances prove to be an excellent alternative to bypass these constraints. Alliances often lead to full-scale integration if restrictions are lifted by one or both countries. Risks of competitive collaboration Some strategic alliances involve many firms that are in fierce competition outside the specific scope of the alliance. This creates the risk that one or both partners will try to use the alliance to create an advantage over the other. The benefits of this alliance may cause unbalance between the parties, there are several factors that may cause this asymmetry:Bartett, C.A. (2009), Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross-Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education, *The partnership may be forged to exchange resources and capabilities such as technology. This may cause one partner to obtain the desired technology and abandon the other partner, effectively appropriating all the benefits of the alliance. *Using investment initiative to erode the other partners competitive position. This is a situation where one partner makes and keeps control of critical resources. This creates the threat that the stronger partner may strip the other of the necessary infrastructure. *Strengths gained by learning from one company can be used against the other. As companies learn from the other, usually by task sharing, their capabilities become strengthened, sometimes this strength exceeds the scope of the venture and a company can use it to gain a competitive advantage against the company they may be working with. *Firms may use alliances to acquire its partner. One firm may target a firm and ally with them to use the knowledge gained and trust built in the alliance to take over the other. Disadvantages # Difficult to find a good partner # Risk of unequal partnership # Loss of control # Relationship management across borders Choosing a Partner for International Strategic Alliances #Strategic compatibility #:The partners need to have the same general goal and understanding in forming a joint venture. The differences in strategy produces more conflicts of interest in the later partnership (Lilley and Willianms, 1991). #Complementary skills and resources #:Another important criterion is that the partners need to contribute more than just money to the venture (Geringer and Michael, 1988). Each partner must contribute some skills and resources that complement for another. #Relative company size #:Different size of companies may cause domination of one firm or unequal agreement, which is not favourable for long- term running (Lilley and Willianms, 1991) #Financial capability #:The partners can generate sufficient financial resources to maintain the venture's efforts, which is also important for long-term partnership (Lilley and Willianms, 1991) Some more like compatibility between operating policies (Lilley and Willianms, 1991), trust and commitment (Lilley and Willianms, 1991), compatible management styles (Geringer and Michael, 1988), mutual dependency (Lilley and Willianms, 1991), communications barriers (Lilley and Willianms, 1991) and avoid anchor partners (Geringer and Michael, 1988) are also important for partner selection but less important than the first four. Political Issues Political issues will be faced mostly by the companies who want to enter a country that with unsustainable political environment (Parboteeah and Cullen, 2011). A political decisions will affect the business environment in a country and affect the profitability of the business in the country (Click, 2005). Organizations with investments in such opaque countries as Zimbabwe, Myanmar, and Vietnam have long-term experiences about how the political risk affects their business behaviors (Harvard Business Review, 2014). The following are the examples of political issues: 1\\\\. The politically jailing of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the business giant, in Russia (Wade, 2005); 2\\\\. The \\"Open-door\\" policy of China (Deng, 2001); 3\\\\. The Ukraine disputed elections resulting in the uncertain president recent years (Harvard Business Review, 2014); 4\\\\. The corrupt legal system in many countries, such as Russia (Samara, 2008) Three different rules of entry mode selection The following introductions were based on the statement of Hollensen: # Na√Øve rule. The decision maker uses the same entry mode for all foreign markets. The companies use this rule as the entry mode selection ignore the differences of individual foreign markets. The performance of this selection could not be calculated, because it highly depends on the luck of the manager. # Pragmatic rule. The decision maker uses a workable entry mode for each foreign market, which means that the manager use different entry modes depend on the time stage or the business stage. For example, as the first step to international business, companies tend to use exporting. # Strategy rules. This approach means that the company systematically compared all of the entry modes and evaluated the value before any choice is made. This approach is common in large firms, because the research requires resources, capital and time. It is rarely to see a small or medium-sized company use this approach. Besides these three rules, managers have their own ways to select entry modes. If the company could not generate a mature market research, the manager tend to choose the entry modes most suitable for the industry or make decisions by intuition. Case analysis of Foreign Direct Investment of Telecommunication Company in Albania Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is an important factor for a country's economic growth especially in its impacts on transmission of technology and developments in management and marketing strategies. FDI takes place when a firm acquires ownership control of a production unit in a foreign country. According to the content there are basically three forms of FDI: establishing new branch, acquiring control share of an existing firm, and participating jointly in a domestic firm. As Albanian economy has changed from a centrally planned to a market oriented one, FDI is seen as an important component of the transition process toward a market-led economic system, since it contributes to the development of a country through multiple channels (Kukeli, et al., 2006; Kukeli, 2007). In their study, a limited number of successful mobile networks entry cases have been selected for deep investigation of entry models in Albania, to find out the most important and efficient determinants of foreign mobile networks entry into Albania's telecommunication market in the future as well. It provides a successful Albanian business experience for the newcomers in mobile telecommunications industry. With its developing market economy, Albania offers many opportunities for investors-property as labour costs are low, the young and educated population is ready to work, and tariffs and other legal restrictions are low in many cases and are being eliminated in some others (Albinvest, 2010). Location of Albania in itself offers a notable trade potential, especially with EU markets, since it shares borders with Greece and Italy. In the last years Albania has entered the free trade agreements with Balkan Countries creating the opportunity for trade throughout the region. As Albanian economy tends to grow, the prospects and opportunities of multinational enterprises (MNEs) to invest in Albania for a long-term period has increased also. However, after the transition to democracy since 1992, the country has taken a long way in terms of economic, political and social life (Ministry of Economy 2004, p. 9-10). Demirel (2008) finds all of these changes to form the strengths of Albania in terms of FDI. In his study Demirel (2008) emphasizes that Albania has one of the most friendly investment environments in the region of the South- Eastern European Countries (SEECs) with her impressive economic performance in the last decade, liberal economic legislation, rapid privatisation process and country specific advantages. By taking into account all of these factors, the aim of this study is to offer a new perspective by the case studies of foreign telecommunications companies, which form the majority of MNEs in this field, by finding the most significant determinants before entering into Albania, with a successful entry strategy and crucial consideration of FDI in Albania. It is crucially important to find the determinants and factors that affect multinational firms when deciding on their entry modes, in order to successfully compete in the Albanian mobile telecoms industry. There are four operators in these industries; two of the leading firms expand rapidly in Albania by utilizing successful and aggressive entry strategies, and the other ones are new entries in Albanian market. Lin (2008) emphasizes that the evaluation of the entry modes‚Äô determinants is better to be applied in some main theories and models such as transaction cost theory, eclectic theory and internationalization model, which serve as theoretical foundation in these kind of studies, where host-country condition, political and economic context, and organization capabilities are important factors and require major consideration.

It first aired on December 31, 1979 (leading into 1980), and last aired December 31, 1995 (leading into 1996). The show was commissioned to replace Guy Lombardo's New Year specials. Though Lombardo had died in 1977, Guy's brother, Victor Lombardo, led the Royal Canadians band for two more New Year specials (1977 and 1978) after that. Happy New Year, America featured coverage of the Times Square Ball in New York City and the party in the ballroom of The Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, both of which were also covered during the Lombardo years. However, the show also featured pre-taped segments from Billy Bob's Texas and Walt Disney World. (Billy Bob's was a location made popular as a result of CBS's hit TV series Dallas.) The show had a different host year after year, unlike its competitor New Year's Rockin' Eve (which was annually hosted by Dick Clark). Andy Williams was the most frequent guest host of the show. Other hosts include Paul Anka, who did the first one, Donny Osmond, Natalie Cole, Gladys Knight (1986‚Äì87; 1988‚Äì89) and Al Jarreau (who substituted for Knight when she was sick in the 1985‚Äì86 show), along with Kermit The Frog. Other people who have covered the countdown from Times Square include Catherine Bach (1979‚Äì80, 1980‚Äì81), Donna Mills, Michelle Lee, Jim Varney (in character as Ernest P. Worrell, 1988‚Äì89), Terry Bradshaw (1990‚Äì91), Brent Musburger (1986‚Äì87)' Christie Brinkley (1987‚Äì88), Natalie Cole and Lily Tomlin (in character as \\"Ernestine the Telephone Lady\\" 1984‚Äì85), having made appearances over the course of the show's run. The show did not air in 1991‚Äì1992. In 1992‚Äì93, CBS aired the Hard Rock Cafe New Year's Special, with Jay Thomas hosting from the CafeHARD ROCK CAFE NEW YORK and Nia Peeples reporting from Times Square. Stars were Keith Richards, Robert Cray, Genesis, Pearl Jam, The B-52s, Bo Diddley, The Kids in the Hall, Judy Tenuta and U2. In 1993‚Äì94, the Late Show with David Letterman New Year's Eve episode aired, with Tom and Roseanne Arnold and Bon Jovi as guests, and a live countdown from Times Square. The event was one of two New Year specials CBS regularly aired at the time; the other was the Cotton Bowl Parade, which CBS aired until 1992. CBS also previously carried coverage of the Tournament of Roses Parade (with Bob Barker as host), but this too has also been discontinued. Paul Shaffer hosted the return of HNYA in 1994‚Äì95. The last one was in 1995‚Äì96 and featured Montel Williams as host. In 1996, Disney pulled out of producing the program (and several other CBS holiday specials) when it bought ABC, and CBS decided to discontinue its New Year's coverage. Since then, reruns of the Late Show have aired in the show's time slot, although a first-run episode, with live coverage of Times Square's countdown to midnight, aired on December 31, 1998. CBS aired a one-off America's Millennium special on December 31, 1999, which was hosted by Will Smith and Dan Rather and featured performances by (amongst others) Trisha Yearwood and the premiere of a short film by Steven Spielberg called The Unfinished Dream.

The book was published under Schocken Books. In 2016 the film (in Hebrew) \\"Sipur Ahava Eretz-Israeli\\" was released, inspired by the monodrama, starring Adi Bielski (as \\"Margalit Dromi\\") and directed by Dan Wolman. In October 2016, the play was translated to Spanish and performed for the first time in Lima, Peru under the name of \\"Una historia de amor israel√≠\\", directed by Gonzalo Tuesta, starring Macla Yamada as Margalit Dromi. The title The original Hebrew name of the play is Sippur Ahava Eretz Israeli (An Eretz Israeli Love Story). Eretz means \\"land\\" or \\"country\\" and the term \\"Eretz-Israel\\" (\\"Land of Israel\\") is the ancient and traditional name used by the Jewish people for their homeland, especially after the loss of sovereignty and replacing the name \\"Judea\\" with \\"Syria Palaestina\\" by the Roman Emperor Hadrian. Therefore, the name of the play implies that the story takes place in the British Mandate of Palestine before the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. Synopsis The story begins in the summer of 1942. Fifteen-year-old Margalit, along with her two friends from Moshav Nahalal, is on her way to the youth seminar in Jerusalem. On the bus she meets Ami, a student at Kaduri Agricultural High School. After Ami gets off the bus, Margalit cannot stop thinking about him. Adi Bielski as Margalit, reading a letter from Ami's mother addressed to her parents. Six months later, Margalit meets Ami again, this time at her Moshav, Nahalal. He's a soldier in the Palmach now. His Jeep has broken down and Margalit invites him to sleep over at her house. He leaves the next morning. A year has passed and Margalit is sent by the Nahalal's culture committee to the Youth Instructors Seminar in Kibbutz Yagur. Outside the dining room, she suddenly spots Ami, with another girl. She fails to avoid them. Ami tells Margalit he has been stationed there by the Palmach and introduces his girlfriend. Margalit seems to be out of luck. In 1945 World War II ends with mixed emotions. Along with the joy of victory, there's also the realization of the catastrophe, the Holocaust. The Tzfonis' relatives in Paris were taken to Auschwitz, and no sign of life is received from the extended family in Russia. The policy of the White Paper resulted in Holocaust survivors fleeing from Europe, being treated as Illegal immigrants. The increasing flood of aliyah generates a need for more schools and kindergartens. So, at 18, Margalit goes to the Seminar for Kindergarten teachers in Tel Aviv. She resides in a shack with two roommates, and works for a family, both as a nanny, and a housecleaner. One day, on the bus to the seminar, Margalit encounters Ami. Again. He tells her, that he has separated from the girl from Yagur, and co founded a new Kibbutz, Beit Keshet in the Lower Galilee. Margalit uses the opportunity and invites him to Yafa Gustin's performance at a club in Giv'atayim. When she alights the bus, immediately after Ami told her he was busy and couldn't join her, his friend Motke asks her out. When she declines the offer, he informs her that Ami has a new girlfriend, a new immigrant from Hungary. Margalit cries her heart out to her roommate, Mikhal, who excitedly mentions that her cousin is a member of Beit Keshet. She comes up with a scheme. She will visit her cousin during the Passover holiday and bring Margalit with, for company. At Beit Keshet, Margalit is happy to hear from Mikhal's cousin, that there are vacant beds in his room, and that his roommate is some guy called Ami Ben-Avraham. Adi Bielski as Margalit\\" putting on her wedding gown. In a Kibbutz, guests take part in the work, and Margalit is sent to work in the kitchen. On her way to the showers, she bumps into Ami and decides to try one last time. She asks him to drive her, on his motorcycle, to a Passover party in Nahalal. Ami agrees. After the party, he tells her that he is finished with his Hungarian immigrant girlfriend, and kisses her for the first time. In Beit Keshet, On the nearby hill under the Carob tree, Ami shows Margalit the surrounding view. Mount Tavor, the mountains of Gil'ad and Mount Hermon. He points at the houses of the local Bedouin tribe and tells her that their leader, Sheikh Abu-Nimer, is a friend of his father and always declares that he is Ami's brother. Under that tree, Ami asks Margalit to marry him. The wedding date is set for Purim. In the meantime, the UN resolution for the partition of Palestine on November 29, 1947, marks the beginning of a civil war between the Arabs and the Jews of Palestine, as the following morning the Arabs attack after a night of Jewish celebrations. The Jews are compelled to travel in armored vehicles, as the roads are mostly under Arab control. It's now 1948 and Margalit has difficulty adapting to the communal life of the Kibbutz, where everything is shared among the members. But Ami makes it very clear. The Kibbutz reflects everything he believes in and he is never going to leave it. Nevertheless, he asks and receives a family room, just for them. As the preparations for the wedding are in progress in Nahalal, back in Beit Keshet, a friend of Ami tells him that the Arabs' cows are grazing in Beit Keshet's fields, up on the hill near the Carob tree. Ami gathers a few of his friends to drive the cows out of the Kibbutz's fields. In Nahalal, when Margalit comes back from work at the kindergarten, she is told that Beit Keshet is under attack. After driving in an armored car, through road barriers, in the pouring rain, she reaches Beit Keshet, only to learn that the cows were just bait. They were sent there by Sheikh Abu-Nimer to lure the Kibbutz's men into an ambush. Seven of Beit- Keshets men were gunned down. It was supposed to be Ami and Margalit's wedding day.

Description The shell size varies between 9 mm and 22 mm The oblong shell is subfusiform. The spire is turreted, conical and pointed. It is composed of seven or eight folded whorls, often tuberculated. The upper edge of each whorl is very slightly compressed, which renders the sutures but little apparent. The body whorl, with neither folds nor tubercles, is as large as all the others together, and striated at the base. The ground color of this shell is whitish, and there are delineated brown undulating or zigzag lines, more or less numerous, which descend from the top to the base of the whorls. Sometimes other bands upon the upper whorls form delicate rhombs. The aperture is rather narrow, attenuated at its lower extremity, and as long as the other whorls united. The columella is smooth, straight and entirely white like the rest of the interior of the aperture. The outer lip is indistinctly crenulated.Kiener (1840).

Funded solely by private donations and fundraising by the Central Indiana Community Foundation (CICF), the sculpture was scheduled to be unveiled on September 22, 2011, the 149th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's initial reading of the Emancipation Proclamation to members of his Cabinet. However, due to an increase of public opposition to the project beginning in September 2010, the future of the statue was discussed in a series of community meetings in 2011. On December 13, 2011 the Central Indiana Community Foundation announced that the project would be temporarily canceled. Design E Pluribus Unum, named after the Latin phrase meaning \\"From many, one,\\" will be a re-contextualized reproduction of the nameless, semi-nude African American male sculpture seated at the base of the west facade of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in downtown Indianapolis. Wilson submitted only one entry to the Indianapolis Cultural Trail committee and the design proposal of E Pluribus Unum was accepted without modification. The replica of the African American figure will be 10 x 12 ft. and created in Indiana limestone. The figure will remain seated but will be tilted forward in an upright position. Additionally, Wilson will substitute of a flag of his own design for the pair of broken manacles lifted upward in the right hand of the formerly enslaved figure. The multicolored flag is a composite of African flags and the African diaspora and was inspired by the designs of African quilts and African fabric. The positioning of the flagpole was inspired by the Marine Corps War Memorial, also known as the Iwo Jima Memorial, in Washington, D.C. Once isolated from the Soldiers' and Soldiers' Monument, the sculpture will sit atop a granite, three-tier pedestal that will stand six feet above the ground. This base is designed to complement the materials and design present in the City-County Building's civic plaza as well as provide seating for visitors. At night, a series of lights will illuminate the sculpture. Like his previous installations, E Pluribus Unum will focus attention on the institutional framing of cultural difference. As an artist, Wilson creates shifts in meaning by manipulating the context of existing objects rather than physically altering the objects themselves. Location The sculpture was planned to be located on the Indianapolis Cultural Trail at the northeast corner of Delaware and Washington streets, near the City-County Building. The site was selected by Wilson for its visibility from all angles on the Cultural Trail and its lack of a visual point of interest. Some opponents of the artwork's location are concerned about the statue's close proximity to the Marion County Jail, pointing to current racial disparities in mass incarceration in the United States. Wilson hopes that the proximity of the proposed location for the artwork to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument will encourage visitors to think about the relationship between the two sculptures. In Wilson's words, \\"I try to bring the invisible into view.\\" One of the sites available on the Cultural Trail was located near the grounds of the Indiana Statehouse at 200 West Washington Street in Indianapolis. However, Wilson decided against placing his artwork among monuments depicting important Hoosiers and events related to the State of Indiana: Background information In his visits to Indianapolis, Wilson found that there was only one, unnamed African American represented in the city's many memorials and sculptures. The formerly enslaved African American figure appears at the base of the Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, a 284 ft. 6 in. commemoration of the American Civil War, the American Revolution, the War of 1812, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Some suggest that with the passage of time the commemorative nature of war memorials has been replaced with a more utilitarian purpose, such as city beautification. Consequently, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument is said to symbolize both the city of Indianapolis and the state of Indiana. While others argue that there is nothing more invisible than monuments, some art historians suggest that art can be utilized as a vehicle for racist ideology. Wilson is known for his practice of \\"mining the museum\\" for objects that he can recontextualize in order to question issues of representation and narrative voice. He spent time in Indianapolis in 1993 when he created a show for the Indianapolis Museum of Art titled \\"The Spiral of Art History.\\" It was at this time that he noticed the abundance of monuments in Indianapolis, which would later inspire his vision for E Pluribus Unum. This is the first time that Wilson has \\"mined\\" a city's monuments in order to create a public artwork. Peace group Detail of the west facade of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument known as the Peace group (ca. 1904) The original figure of E Pluribus Unum, a formerly enslaved African American man, is part of a 250-ton sculpture known as the Peace group, which was designed by Herman Matzen and carved by German sculptor Rudolph Schwarz from fifty five separate blocks of limestone. In the center of the Peace group, a female figure known as both \\"Liberty\\" and \\"Angel of Peace\\" holds a Union shield and a flag wrapped in an olive branch. On the shield are the words E pluribus unum, which offers the sculpture its namesake. For Wilson, however, the phrase references Africa and the Black Diaspora. She is flanked by a blacksmith sitting on an anvil, who represents industry; a sheaf of wheat, which represents agriculture; and a homecoming of soldiers, whose lack of headgear symbolically illustrates the end of the war. At her feet sits the freed African American male figure, whose positioning reflects a common trope in nineteenth-century American sculpture that depicts African Americans kneeling in gratitude while holding broken manacles or discarded whips. These post-Reconstruction era of the United States depictions of formerly enslaved people, often shown with uncertain, upward gazes aimed toward their liberators, minimized African American efforts and sacrifices in obtaining freedom and instead interpreted the Emancipation Proclamation as an act of white benevolence. Indianapolis Cultural Trail E Pluribus Unum was commissioned by the Central Indiana Community Foundation (CICF) to be included on the Indianapolis Cultural Trail: A Legacy of Gene & Marilyn Glick. The Cultural Trail, a $63 million project, is an urban pedestrian and bike path connecting the city's five cultural districts: Indiana Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, Fountain Square, the Wholesale District and the Canal and White River State Park. A total of $2 million has been invested for new public artwork along these cultural districts in Indianapolis. The curatorial advisory committee for the Cultural Trail is composed of representatives from the Indianapolis Museum of Art, Herron School of Art and Design at Indiana University‚ÄìPurdue University Indianapolis, Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art, Indiana State Museum, and other cultural organizations in city. Artist Wilson received a MacArthur Foundation Genius Grant in 1999 and the Larry Aldrich Foundation Award in 2003. He represented the United States at the Biennial Cairo in 1992 and the Venice Biennale in 2003.Rena Bransten Gallery biography Wilson's work examines, questions, and deconstructs the traditional display of art and artifacts in museums. With the use of new text panels, sounds, lighting, and non- traditional pairings of objects, Wilson leads viewers to recognize that changes in context create changes in meaning. Wilson's juxtaposition of evocative objects forces the viewer to question the biases and limitations of cultural institutions and how they have shaped the interpretation of historical truth, artistic value, and the language of display.PBS art:21 biography Wilson describes himself as of \\"African, Native American, European and Amerindian\\" descent. Fabrication In 2009 the African American figure on the Soldiers and Sailors Monument was digitally scanned to create a three- dimensional image. The process of creating a computer model was completed in one evening using a hand-held laser scanning system. The data will be sent to a computer-controlled stone cutting machine for a rough cut of the sculpture in Indiana limestone. This material was chosen for E Pluribus Unum because of its prominence in Indianapolis architecture in the late nineteenth century and to reflect the state's geological heritage. Like the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, many official buildings and monuments in downtown Indianapolis are constructed with Indiana limestone. After the figure is cut from the stone, an artist will refine the sculpture's more detailed areas. Multiple copies of Wilson's flag will be constructed by professional flag makers if needed for replacement. The Brooklyn, New York foundry that fabricated the flagpole for the Marine Corps War Memorial (Iwo Jima Memorial) will be constructing the flagpole for E Pluribus Unum. Public dialogue Wilson often incorporates social dialogue into the development of his artworks. He first considers projects with a connection to the culture and history of a place and then engages in talks with the museum or community that he's working with in order to enhance the work's meaning within that context. In the case of E Pluribus Unum, Wilson encouraged research about the African American experience in Indianapolis and incorporated public outreach in order to educate the community and promote dialogue. A series of public discussions took place in 2009 and 2010, beginning with his first introduction of the project on February 25, 2009. Held at the historic Madame Walker Theatre in the Indiana Avenue district in Indianapolis, Wilson discussed his prior work and unveiled the digital rendering for E Pluribus Unum to a small crowd of local students and community members. The following year Wilson returned to Indianapolis for further public outreach, including an event in April 2010 at Crispus Attucks High School and in August at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. After an increase in public opposition to the proposed artwork in September 2010, an additional meeting was organized on October 19 at the Madame Walker Theatre. It was at this point that the discussion became more controversial in nature and began to attract attention from arts critics on a national level. Wilson explained that promoting discourse in a large city like Indianapolis is much different than in a museum, which is a more finite environment. In earlier community talks in 2009 and early 2010, Wilson and the CICF had had little success in creating an ongoing dialogue. It wasn't until the discussion around the artwork took a more controversial turn that a larger portion of the city began to take notice. Wilson explained, \\"With a city, you realize‚Äîor I have come to realize‚Äîthat as many groups as you speak to there are other groups. You can't ever reach everyone. So I‚Äôm just really thrilled that there‚Äôs engagement and talk about art.\\" Reception=Historical context In the past, others have voiced their opinions of the enslaved figure depicted on the Soldiers and Sailors Monument. Freeman Henry Morris Murray (1859‚Äì1950), an African American art historian who earned his living as a typesetter and as a lecturer, offered an early condemnation of Indianapolis' representation of African Americans in public art. In Emancipation and the Freed in American Sculpture (1916), Murray charges that with the symbolic and figurative overload of the Peace group and its sister composite, the War group on the east facade of the monument, the African American figure appears as an offensive, last-minute addition: Controversy In September 2010, an Indianapolis history teacher wrote an editorial to the Indianapolis Recorder, a historically black newspaper, that sparked the controversy surrounding the sculpture. The editorial stated that the sculpture is not an empowering or uplifting image for the African American community and likened the sculpture to a black lawn jockey. The debate continued on the local Amos Brown radio show, leading it to gain even more attention on local news broadcasts. Due to the escalating debate, the Central Indiana Community Foundation (CICF) organized an additional talk between Wilson and the Indianapolis community on October 19, 2010 at the Madame Walker Theatre. After Wilson presented a slideshow of his previous work, the meeting became heated when a small, organized group began to voice their opposition to the artwork. Opponents rejected Wilson's image of a semi-nude sculpture as reflective of 21st-century African Americans, and the discussion quickly transitioned into deeper issues of institutional racism in the city of Indianapolis rather than focus on Wilson's work. Indianapolis Cultural Trail curator Mindy Taylor Ross stated, \\"It was just one of those situations where there are hundreds of people there and the loudest voices get heard and everyone else gets drowned out.\\" Following the meeting, Wilson told reporters he felt \\"blindsided\\" and \\"saddened\\" by the community response. Yet Wilson underscored the value of hearing viewpoints from the sculpture's opponents: \\"Having dialogue, having the discussion happen, having people tell me what they thought was really a good thing.\\" In an interview with modern art critic Tyler Green, Wilson further elaborated, \\"Everyone in Indianapolis has been great to me and respectful and thrilled with what I do, but even people who are against (E Pluribus Unum) seem to still respect me and my work. They just don‚Äôt like this one.\\" Following the talk at the Madame Walker Theatre, Wilson appeared on the Amos Brown radio show to continue to dialogue with the community. The majority of the callers supported the artwork. Some suggested that the artwork was better suited for a museum, where visitors could choose to see his work, rather than in a permanent public space. Those that disapprove of Wilson's use of the freed slave have shared a number of other suggestions for subject matter, such as a sculpture of Major Taylor or a modern African American family. In defense of E Pluribus Unum Wilson has said, \\"It's part of my practice to use the same image to make that same point rather than to make a new image. I don't believe you forget the old image until you really deal with it.\\" Modern art critic Tyler Green has praised Wilson for not shying from the intense public dialogue, and has described E Pluribus Unum as \\"the smartest, most ambitious public art project currently under consideration in America.\\" In December 2010, Green included the proposed work on the Modern Art Notes year-end top ten list. Current status Progress on E Pluribus Unum was placed on hold in October 2010. At that time $51,000 of Wilson's $325,000 commission for E Pluribus Unum had been paid. In January 2011, the sculpture was awarded $50,000 in project support from the Chicago-based Joyce Foundation. The annual Joyce Foundation grant supports community engagements and the development of dance, music, theater, and visual arts by artists color in major Midwestern United States cities. The grant was to be used to fund part of Wilson's commission as well as public outreach about the artwork. This outreach was to consist of discussions led by local art educators and the Greater Indianapolis Progress Committee's Race and Cultural Relations Leadership Network, with each session limited to 20 participants. The $50,000 grant was to be returned to the Joyce Foundation if the sculpture is not created. In December 2011, the Central Indiana Community Foundation held a press conference to announce cancellation of the project.

She received national recognition in 2009 when, at 105 years old, she travelled to Washington D.C. to attend the inauguration of U.S. President Barack Obama. Biography=Early life Johnson was born Ella Mae Smith on January 13, 1904, in Dallas, Texas. She never met her father, and she became an orphan when her mother died of tuberculosis when she was four years old. She was raised by her neighbors, the Davis family. She was the salutatorian of her high school, Dallas Colored High School. Johnson was able to attend college through several scholarships and a job as a waitress at a YMCA tearoom, enrolling at Fisk University in 1921. As a student, she attended a commencement speech by W. E. B. Du Bois. She received a bachelor's degree in French from Fisk University, though she graduated six months later than expected after participating in a semester boycott of the school led by Du Bois. After graduation, Smith briefly moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, where she worked for the Congregational Church. In 1926, she relocated again to Cleveland, Ohio, to pursue her master's degree in social work at the Western Reserve University‚Äôs School of Applied Social Science, which is now called Case Western Reserve University. Smith was one of just two African American students which were admitted to the school's social work graduate program each year. Personal life She married her first husband, Elmer Cheeks, an electrical engineer with Cleveland Municipal Light, in 1929. The couple had two sons, Jim and Paul Cheeks, during their 12 year marriage, which ended in his death. She later married her second husband, Raymond Johnson, who worked as a probation officer at the Cleveland Municipal Court. She was also widowed from her second marriage. Career Johnson worked for both the Cuyahoga County Department of Welfare and Associated Charities of Cleveland, in a program that merged with the Aid to Dependent Children, an American federal government program. Her job involved finding scholarships for low-income students and distributing financial payments to single mothers. Among the people she helped were Louise Stokes and her young sons, Carl Stokes and Louis Stokes. She retired in 1961 and began travelling, ultimately visiting more than 30 countries, including Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Mexico and Syria. She moved to the Judson at University Circle, an assisted living facility, in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, in 1975. Obama inauguration Johnson gained national attention in 2009, when at the age of 105, she attended the inauguration of President Barack Obama in Washington D.C. Covered in a sleeping bag and heavy clothes to guard against cold temperatures, Johnson attended the inauguration with a ticket provided by Ohio U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown. In several interviews, Johnson said of President Obama, \\"I found him so interesting and brilliant\\" and predicted a future female American president: \\"God wouldn't give African- American men what he wouldn't give to the women.\\" Death and autobiography Johnson died at Judson Park in Cleveland, Ohio, on March 22, 2010, at the age of 106. She was survived by her sons, James Cheeks and Paul Cheeks; a stepson, D. Wright Johnson; five grandchildren and five great-grand children. She was the oldest living African American alumna of Case Western Reserve University at the time. Johnson's autobiography, It Is Well with My Soul: The Extraordinary Life of a 106-Year-Old Woman, which she co-wrote with author Patricia Mulcahy, was published posthumously by Penguin Books. Johnson's 203-page memoir, which was originally scheduled to be released in May 2010, was moved up to a new release date of March 31, 2010, due to her death.

It is of a fawn color or more or less deep brownish red. It contains some white spots, forming a sort of zone beneath the sutures. It presents also several varieties of color, and some specimens are found which are covered with small grayish points. The whitish aperture is delicately shaded with a pale violet, rather small, narrow, terminated by a straight siphonal canal, short, and very slightly effuse at its extremity. The outer lip is thin and sharp. Its internal edge isdenticulated. The columella lip is covered in front by a pointed callosity, which partially conceals the striae of the base of the body whorl and exhibits a row of five or six small guttules.

Founded in 1991 by James Botte and Farrell McGovern in response to a perception that there were no dedicated public venues that featured primarily Canadian speculative fiction writers, editors, and artists. In addition to the focus on Canadian content, it was also an attempt to bring a focus on the book back to Ottawa science fiction and fantasy events.CAN‚Ä¢CON '95/CANVENTION 15 Winter Programming Session backgrounder, W. Paul Valcour. March 2, 1995. It ran from 1992 through 1997, and again in 2001 before taking a hiatus of several years due to financial constraints; it was then relaunched in 2010. Over the years, CAN‚Ä¢CON has had as guests or attendees the cream of Canadian English and French speculative fiction writers and artists (with the notable exceptions of Spider Robinson, Margaret Atwood, and William Gibson). As such, it became a meeting place for Canadian writers and artists and their fans, and provided a natural venue for the national meetings of various related Canadian organizations. This caught the notice of TOR Books' senior editor David Hartwell, who came to CAN‚Ä¢CON and signed deals with many Canadian science fiction and fantasy writers. Of this he said, \\"I did more business at CAN‚Ä¢CON than I did at Worldcon\\". This informal access to large numbers of Canadian writers enabled him to spearhead TOR's Canadian publishing initiative.David Hartwell Programming CAN-CON has had some of the most diverse programming SF conventions have ever had, while retaining a focus on Canada, its writing environment, and uniqueness. It has also hosted events such as book launches, Canvention with its Prix Aurora Awards, the Bor√©al Congress, a private label CAN-CON Wine, Virtual Reality gaming, and Co-Hosting the launch with the National Library of Canada of their exhibition \\"Visions of Other Worlds\\", Hosting Canada Post's Canadian Superhero Stamp Series Unveiling, to name a few of the notable events. The tenth Conference, which took place on September 21‚Äì23 of 2012, focused on introducing emerging and aspiring writers and artists to agents, editors, publishers and fans. The eleventh Conference, which took place at Minto Suites Hotel on October 4‚Äì6, 2013, had the theme of \\"The Cutting Edge\\"; it also hosted Canvention and the 33rd Aurora Awards. The seventeenth and most recent Conference occurred at the Ottawa Sheraton Hotel on October 18-20, 2019.

Life is a unity, and > responsibility is its matchword: for responsibility means obligation, a > bond, one part of life answering to another part, a close-woven texture. - > Puffer Howes, January 18Howes, 1920a As one of the first women to embark on a career in psychology, Ethel Dench Puffer Howes faced obstacles at every turn, from institutionalized sexism at the universities and colleges where she studied and taught, to the challenge of maintaining a family life and career (all too familiar to women even a century later).Scarborough & Furumoto, 1987 She and her female peers nevertheless laid the groundwork for women in psychology today. Though choosing to marry effectively ended her career in academia, she adjusted her expectations and efforts to push the boundaries of socially imposed limitations for women, spending the rest of her life organizing and lobbying for women's interests.Scarborough, 1991 Her attempts to live an ideal life, with the close-woven texture articulated so eloquently in the above quote, were never fulfilled in academia or in the field of psychology in particular, but her accomplishments in the nascent feminist socio-political movement brought that life into reach for future generations of women. Early life Ethel Dench Puffer was born to George and Ella Puffer in Framingham, Massachusetts on October 10, 1872, the eldest child in a family of four daughters.Furumoto, 1992 The Puffers were a shining example of this non- traditional view of women's potential, beginning with Ethel's mother and aunt, who both went to college, and continuing with Ethel and her sisters.Scarborough & Furumoto, 1987 All four Puffer sisters graduated from Smith College, and two went on to complete their education with doctoral degrees.Scarborough, 1991 Ethel completed her undergraduate degree at Smith College in 1891 at age 19, after which she taught high school in Keene, New Hampshire, where she met her future husband, who was a student at that time.Scarborough, 1991 Psychology After teaching high school for a year in Keene, Ethel Puffer returned to Smith College as a mathematics instructor, but soon found herself becoming increasingly interested in the nascent science of psychology. In 1895, she traveled to Germany (like many of her compatriots) to pursue education in the newly formed field, and was met instantaneously with the logistical obstacles set in place to keep women from enrolling in graduate courses. Letters to her mother reveal the persistence Puffer employed to ensure her place at the University of Berlin, which included pursuing meetings with professors, ministers and rectors at their homes on the weekend to request permission to attend classes.Scarborough & Furumoto, 1987 She managed to officially enroll herself, though not before surreptitiously attending her first day of classes without full permission. Her poor living situation, the punitive societal reaction against American women in Berlin, and her lackluster program of study became increasingly disheartening and stressful for Puffer, so when a classmate recommended she pursue her studies under Hugo M√ºnsterberg at the University of Freiburg, she jumped at the opportunity to transfer.Scarborough & Furumoto, 1987 According to the letters Puffer sent to her mother during the academic year of 1896-1897,Scarborough & Furumoto, 1987 she thrived both academically and socially in Freiburg as an adopted member of the M√ºnsterberg family. Her mornings were spent diligently conducting her research with M√ºnsterberg in the family parlor, always in the presence of Mrs. M√ºnsterberg, painting at the other end of the room, as Puffer was quick to point out to her scandalized mother. She took classes at the reportedly dilapidated University building as well, and spent her holidays attending the raucous parties of the Freiburg elite. When the opportunity arose to apply for a prestigious award from the Association of Collegiate Alumnae to fund her dissertation research, M√ºnsterberg encouraged her to do so and wrote her a glowing recommendation, comparing her superior intellectual abilities to Mary Whiton Calkins, the only other prominent female psychologist at that time. Puffer won the award and returned to the U.S. to continue her studies in 1897, following M√ºnsterberg to Harvard where he was to take over the psychology laboratory from William James. Puffer completed her doctoral work in 1898.Scarborough & Furumoto, 1987 Despite the glowing recommendations of eight Harvard professors, attesting to Puffer's academic excellence and completion of the coursework for the degree, she was never granted a Harvard Ph.D.Palmieri, 1995 She waited 3 years after completing her doctoral work and finally wrote letters to the dean of Radcliffe College inquiring whether the college would be willing to confer her the Ph.D., especially considering her prior enrollment in the school, and they obliged.Scarborough & Furumoto, 1987 They also offered the Radcliffe Ph.D. to three other female psychologists who had completed their doctoral studies at Harvard, including Mary Whiton Calkins, who refused on the grounds that she had never been enrolled at Radcliffe and opted to hold out for a Harvard degree that was never conferred (and has not been, to this day, despite continued protests).Scarborough, 1991 Scholarly career Puffer's academic career in the field of psychology lasted for a decade after her doctoral studies concluded, in which she taught at colleges for women, including Wellesley, Smith and Simmons. Puffer also held a concurrent position as a laboratory assistant.Scarborough, 1991 Of note, she was instead listed in the Radcliffe faculty catalogue, for fear of setting a ‚Äúdangerous precedent‚Äù for Harvard if they chose to acknowledge having hired a woman to hold such a position.Hayden, 1982 Puffer published her doctoral research as a book titled The Psychology of Beauty in 1905Scarborough & Furumoto, 1987 and wrote articles in the tradition of her teacher, Hugo M√ºnsterberg, a proponent of extending the audience for psychological research to laypeople outside of the field.Scarborough, 1991 Meanwhile, at Wellesley, she was among a female academic elite who shared her belief that higher education for women was an avenue not only for individual women to find fulfilling purpose in their lives, but also to expand the roles of women in society and overcome institutionalized sexism.Palmieri, 1995 Her position within this social movement shifted dramatically in 1908 when she accepted the marriage proposal of Benjamin Howes who had recently completed his graduate work in civil engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and had become an expert in construction.Scarborough & Furumoto, 1987 Marriage vs. career After marrying Benjamin Howes in August 1908, Ethel Dench Puffer Howes, as she was now known, ran into another major obstacle for women in academia around the start of the 20th century: the staunchly held convention that married women should not be employed, particularly not full- time.Furumoto, 1986 While it is not clear whether she left her position at Wellesley voluntarily or was asked to resign,Palmieri, 1995 she nevertheless continued to seek out academic positions, but found herself stymied by her status as a married woman. For example, the President of Smith College wrote to warn her that news of her engagement had led him to rescind his recommendation of her application to become a faculty member at Barnard College.Furumoto, 1986 For the following few years, Puffer Howes struggled to fit her academic pursuits into her new life as a domestic partner with responsibility for the maintenance of a household, made all the more difficult by frequent relocations necessary for advancing her husband's career. Though Benjamin Howes proved atypical in his willingness to help his wife by cooking and cleaning when she needed time to complete scholarly articles, the pull of her domestic life became ever stronger when the couple had two children, a daughter, Ellen, in 1915, and a son, Benjamin, in 1917. Puffer Howes was in her forties at that time, and the compounded demands on her time and attention from raising the children to fulfilling household and social duties effectively ended her academic career.Scarborough & Furumoto, 1987 Rather than disappear into obscurity as a cautionary tale for would-be mother-scholars, Puffer Howes turned her attention to social activism and began a second career as a prominent feminist organizer.Scarborough, 1991 Feminism Puffer Howes had positioned herself as a leader in the suffrage movement as the Executive Secretary of the National College Equal Suffrage League in 1914 just before her daughter was born.Howes, 1920 During World War I, she also assisted in organizing the Women's Land Army, to substitute women workers in agriculture while the men were away at war.Scarborough, 1991 In the early 1920s, she wrote two articles for The Atlantic Monthly regarding the impossible position women scholars found themselves in upon marrying or having children. In doing so, she gave voice to her disenchantment with the social structure imposed on women by institutions that would not hire wives and mothers, as well as on the utter lack of support for mothers in maintaining professional focus while raising children.Howes, 1922 These articles provided what could be considered a mission statement for the rest of her life's work: > Unmarried women, limited in numbers and in contacts with life, cannot charge > the citadel of professional privilege in sufficient volume and momentum to > carry it. Until all women of ability, in the sense in which it may be said > of all men of ability, are in action, it is probable that few women will > reach the highest, and the avenues will remain obstructed. - Ethel Puffer > Howes, Accepting the Universe In The meaning of progress in the women movement, Puffer Howes proposed that suffrage had not gone far enough in providing women with the tools to lead fulfilling and productive lives, and nothing less than a new social order would do so.Howes, 1929 Shortly thereafter, she wrote articles and collected data through the Women's Home Companion on cooperative community strategies that were being developed to share the burdens of housework and raising children.Friedan, 1981 In running contests such as ‚ÄúThe Most Practical Plan for Cooperative Home Service in Our Town,‚Äù Puffer Howes was able to study the effectiveness of cooperative solutions while simultaneously promoting the idea among the magazine's subscribers,Friedan, 1981 the very housewives Puffer Howes hoped would ‚Äúcharge the citadel of professional privilege‚Äù in concert with the current cohort of women seeking higher education in college and graduate schools. It was the most successful campaign thus far for organizing cooperate services for the benefit of women.Hayden, 1982 In 1923, Puffer Howes became the chair of the committee on Cooperative Home Service for the American Association of University Women. These studies, articles, and organizational positions became the foundation for the Smith College Institute for the Coordination of Women's Interest, which Puffer Howes developed and ran from 1925 to 1931, with a grant she procured from the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial. Through the Institute for the Coordination of Women's Interests, Puffer Howes created a think-tank of experts from a variety of fields whose work had the potential to greatly influence the social structures in place that kept women from professional activities and satisfying careers. These specialists included top researchers in architecture, history, and home economics; as well as career guidance, childcare, and kindergarten and nursery school experts. In 1928, the institute hosted a cooperative kitchen, which provided meals to people in the community, and which became a part of a larger exhibition of a viable community house that was sent to New York to be put on display.Hayden, 1982 The institute was also used to coordinate the Smith College Day and Nursery School cooperative, a cooperative childcare demonstration model.Five College Archives and Manuscript Collection Puffer Howes was in her fifties during the era of the Institute, and her grueling lecture tours and organizational work required her to travel long distances from home every week. She herself had to coordinate her interests through careful planning: balancing motherhood, household responsibilities, and her career.Scarborough & Furumoto, 1987 Despite her best efforts, the Institute was phased out of existence when the Rockefeller Foundation chose not to renew its grant, reportedly because the Institute focused too much on developing practical applications and not enough on research.Scarborough & Furumoto, 1987 Smith College also failed to incorporate the Institute's research and programming into its curriculum, due to the controversial nature of its work, which many of the faculty members did not support, but the college nonetheless provided funding for the final two years in order for Puffer Howes to attempt to complete her research.Scarborough & Furumoto, 1987 On a larger scale, HaydenHayden, 1982 asserted that the insatiable greed of the newly energized manufacturing sector, built up to support the war efforts, played the largest role in dismantling the cooperative system Puffer Howes had begun to establish and encourage among American housewives and female professionals. The Woman's Home Companion itself turned against the cooperative movement as its advertisers pushed personal home appliances as the solution to the domestic demands on housewives.Hayden, 1982 In ‚ÄúThe Second Stage,‚Äù Friedan also correlates the failure of the Smith College Institute for the Coordination of Women's Interest with the Red Scare following World War I, in which labor unions, cooperatives, and feminists in general were held suspect by an unnerved capitalist military‚Äìindustrial complex.Howes, 1920 Last years After the Institute dissolved, the Howes moved to Washington, D.C. in the 1930s, where Benjamin Howes‚Äô expertise in civil engineering secured him appointments to federal housing committees (including an appointment as chief of the U.S. Housing Authority and Public Housing Administration). Ethel Puffer Howes, meanwhile, spent her time in Washington on civic activities. The couple moved to Connecticut to live with their son, Benjamin Howes, in the 1940s, and in 1950, at the age of 78, Ethel Puffer Howes died. Her husband Benjamin's death followed 18 months later.Scarborough, 1991 Published works *Puffer, E. D. (1905) The Psychology of Beauty. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. *Howes, E. P. (1914). Aesthetics.

Statements He is quoted as blaming the Arab silence of Darfur genocide as part of the \\"twin fascisms\\" that dominate the Middle East: Islamism and Pan- Arabism. The former pertains to the rejection of the legitimacy of any non- Muslim group within what is perceived as the Arab's proper domain whereas the latter holds the same view - this time - towards any non-Arab group. According to Bechri, these developments gave rise to a condition where all minorities living within the Arab world are under siege,http://97.74.65.51/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=25965 particularly underscoring the impact of Islamism as \\"the mother of all big lies'. He also lodged strong criticism of the West, noting that the level of freedom found in its societies gave Islamist terror masters ample opportunity to mount an effective propaganda machine. considering all these factors, Bechri stressed that only Arab/Muslim secular forces can effectively undermine Islamism. Persecution Bechri often experienced persecution due to his human rights initiatives in Tunisia. In 2000, for example, he was part of a group, which were assaulted and threatened by police officers in Tunis. Bechri was a coordinator of the National Committee to Defend Moncef Marzouki, who was dismissed from his post due to his human rights activities.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, Tampa Bay Rays and Washington Nationals Career=Minor leagues Venters was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 30th round of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft out of Lake Brantley High School. He began his professional career with the Rookie League GCL Braves in 2004. During the 2004 season, Venters started 8 games and made 11 appearances total, going 1-6 with a 5.74 ERA and 3 saves. In 2005, Venters was promoted to the Class-A Rome Braves. In 23 games (12 starts), Venters had an 8-6 record and a 3.93 ERA. After undergoing Tommy John surgery in late 2005, Venters missed the entire 2006 season. In 2007, Venters was promoted to the Class-A Advanced Myrtle Beach Pelicans. He appeared in 17 games (12 starts), going 3-3 with a 3.39 ERA and 1 save. Venters was demoted all the way down to the Rookie League level to begin the 2008 season where he posted a 4.70 ERA in 4 starts. He was promoted to Class-A Advanced, where he went 1-2 with a 4.08 ERA in 5 games (3 starts). He was then promoted to the Double-A Mississippi Braves, where he finished the season by going 1-0 with a 1.00 ERA in 3 games (2 starts). All together in the 2008 campaign, Venters posted a 3.41 ERA, 1 save, and a 2-2 record in 12 total games combined with the three affiliate levels. Venters started the 2009 season in Double-A, posting a 4-4 record in 12 starts with a 2.76 ERA. He was promoted to the Triple-A Gwinnett Braves, where he finished 4-7 with a 5.62 ERA in 17 starts. Combined with both Minor League levels in 2009, Venters went 8-11 in 29 total starts with a 4.42 combined ERA. After the 2009 season, the Braves added Venters to their 40-man roster with an invitation to spring training. After spring training, Venters started the 2010 season in Triple-A. After 2 games (1 start), Venters went 1-0 with a 1.35 ERA until being called up to the Majors. Atlanta Braves The Braves promoted Venters the major leagues for the first time on April 17, 2010. He made his debut that day against the Colorado Rockies, allowing one hit and no runs over three innings. On July 17, 2010, in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers, Venters was deemed to have intentionally thrown at Brewers first baseman Prince Fielder. He was ejected from the game along with Braves manager Bobby Cox and later suspended four games, a decision which Venters later appealed. Venters' suspension was subsequently overturned. Venters finished the season with a 1.95 ERA, and ranked sixth in the National League, with 79 games pitched.Jonny Venters Statistics and History - Baseball- Reference.com He was named a relief pitcher on Baseball America's 2010 All- Rookie Team. He tied for 8th in the voting for NL Rookie of the Year, behind Ike Davis of the New York Mets.Sanchez falls short in NL Rookie of Year bid  MLB.com: News Venters became a key part of the Braves bullpen during the 2011 season, serving primarily as the set up man for Craig Kimbrel. Along with Kimbrel and Eric O'Flaherty, the three pitchers became known as O'Ventbrel for their dominance over the last three innings of a ballgame. Venters was voted a National League All-Star in 2011, striking out Jacoby Ellsbury as part of a successful two-out effort in the top of the eighth inning. Venters struggled throughout the first half of the 2012 season. During a game against the New York Yankees on June 12, 2012, he allowed Alex Rodriguez's 23rd career grand slam. He was placed on the disabled list on July 5, 2012, due to a sore left elbow. He returned to the bullpen on July 22, 2012, where he pitched two scoreless innings versus the Washington Nationals. Venters finished the 2012 season with a 5-4 record and a 3.32 ERA. Venters opened the 2013 season on the disabled list with left elbow discomfort. Trying to avoid surgery, he was injected with platelet-rich plasma, but he still was not expected to return until at least late May. However, the procedure was unsuccessful, and on May 16, 2013, Venters underwent Tommy John surgery for the second time of his career. This naturally eliminated the remainder of his 2013 season. Venters was placed on the 60-day disabled list on July 4, 2013, to free up a spot on the Braves' 40-man roster as Joey Terdoslavich was promoted from AAA Gwinnett to replace Jordan Schafer on the active roster. After the season, Venters signed a one-year deal with the Braves for the 2014 season, thereby avoiding arbitration. Venters began the 2014 season on the 60-day disabled list while recovering from surgery, enduring many setbacks in the process. On August 28, 2014, Venters learned he had torn his ulnar collateral ligament again and would need a third Tommy John surgery to continue his baseball career. The third procedure was performed in September 2014, and prevented Venters from pitching in 2015. On November 19, 2014, the Braves designated Venters for assignment. He was released two days later. Tampa Bay Rays On March 11, 2015, Venters signed a two-year minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Rays. He did not make an appearance in 2015 as he was still recovering from his third Tommy John surgery. On July 2, 2016, Venters tore his ulnar collateral ligament once again, but due to the way it was torn, he went through a ligament reattachment instead of going through what would have been his fourth Tommy John surgery. Venters signed a minor league deal on March 30, 2017. He once again began the season on the 60-day disabled list and did not make any appearances in the Majors in 2017. He elected free agency on November 6, 2017. In December 2017, Venters rejoined the Rays and was invited to spring training in 2018. On April 25, 2018, the Rays recalled Venters from Triple-A Durham, approximately 2,048 days since his last big league appearance. The same day, Venters finally made his way back into the Majors, pitching against the Baltimore Orioles and getting Chris Davis to ground out on four pitches. Return to Atlanta On July 26, the Rays traded Venters to the Atlanta Braves for an international signing bonus slot. Venters finished the 2018 season with a 5-2 record, a 3.67 ERA, and three saves in fifty games pitched all season. At the end of the 2018 season, Venters received the National League Comeback Player of the Year Award. He agreed to a one-year contract worth $2.25 million for the 2019 season. He was released on May 18, 2019. Washington Nationals On May 29, 2019, Venters signed a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals. His contract was selected on June 25, 2019, and he was called up to the major leagues. Venters made 3 appearances for the Nationals, complying with a 0-1 record and a 5.40 ERA. On August 30, 2019, Venters underwent left shoulder surgery to repair a torn capsule, therefore ending his season. Overall in 2019, combined with both teams he played for, his ERA was 12.38 with 12 relief appearances. At the time of his absence, the Nationals finished the year with a 93-69 record, clinching a wild card spot, and eventually winning the 2019 World Series over the Astros. Personal life Venters is married to Viviana, with whom he has three children. Pitching style Venters primarily throws a sinker, which he throws with exceptional velocity (93‚Äì96 mph). He used that sinker to achieve a near-70% ground ball rate in 2010, leading all qualified MLB pitchers. His superb knuckle curveball is thrown at 85‚Äì88 mph. In 2011, it resulted in an extraordinary whiff rate of 71% (the highest for any pitch by any relief pitcher) and was put in play less than 6% of the time. He also has a four-seam fastball in the mid 90s and a changeup in the upper 80s that he began throwing somewhat frequently in 2012 against right-handed hitters.

He played center and was selected as the captain of the University of Pennsylvania's unbeaten teams of 1904 and 1905. When the Quakers went 12‚Äì0 in 1904, only Swarthmore was able to score against them. Torrey was considered one of the best linemen in 1905 and later won All- American honors. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1971. Biography Torrey was from Montclair, New Jersey, where he attended Montclair High School.[ Bob Torrey], National Football Foundation. Accessed January 9, 2018. \\"High School: Montclair, NJ (Montclair HS)\\" He enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania in 1902 and played four years of varsity football for the Penn Quakers. As a freshman in 1902, he played at the tackle position, but he was moved to end in 1903. He played center and was selected as the captain of Penn's unbeaten teams of 1904 and 1905. He was selected by his teammates as the captain of the 1905 Penn football team and was selected by Walter Camp and Caspar Whitney as a first-team All-American that year. In April 1907, Torrey was hired as the field coach for Penn's football team. After retiring from football, Torrey was a medical doctor and became the head of the medical board at Philadelphia's General Hospital. He died in 1941. The bloodied face photo During an October 7, 1905 game between Swarthmore and Penn, played at Franklin Field, Swarthmore's Tiny Maxwell had his nose broken, his eyes swollen, and nearly shut, and his face dripped with blood. Maxwell reportedly continue to play until near the end of the game, when his face was so bloody and swollen that he could no longer see, yet he never complained of the physical beating. 1905, 18 players died playing college football and 159 were seriously injured. A newspaper photo was taken of face. The photo then found its way to President Theodore Roosevelt. The photograph of Maxwell's face shocked and enraged President Roosevelt into threatening to abolish football, if the colleges themselves did not take steps to eliminate the brutality and reduce injuries. Bob Torrey, was the Penn player opposite of Maxwell that day. Although Torrey can not be personally blamed for Maxwell's injuries, it is no secret that Penn offensive line double and triple-teamed Maxwell, feeling that if they stopped \\"Tiny\\" they could finish the season unbeaten. While several writers and scholars have made exhaustive searches for the photo of Maxwell‚Äôs battered face, none have ever been found. Though the events surrounding the Roosevelt-Maxwell story supposedly occurred in 1905, the story didn't appear until it was mentioned in the second edition of Frank G. Menke's Encyclopedia of Sports published in 1944. Meanwhile, Maxwell died in 1922. The 1960s and 1970s update of the Encyclopedia also continued to run the Maxwell-Roosevelt story. The Maxwell Football Club, formed by sportswriters and athletic officials to honor Maxwell, picked up the story and made it more credible. As a result, it became the official account of 1905 and was enshrined in Jack Falla‚Äôs history of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and at the College Football Hall of Fame. What is absolutely certain is that on October 9, 1905, Teddy Roosevelt held a meeting of football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Though he lectured on eliminating and reducing injuries, he never threatened to ban football or mentioned the Maxwell injury. He also lacked the authority to abolish football. In fact he was actually a fan of the game. The President's sons were also playing football at the college and secondary levels at the time.

He perceives himself as a voyeur, witnessing couples, sumptuous dining rooms, professionals at work and scenes of family life.Frederick Brown: Flaubert: A Life: London: Pimlico: 2007: 111 In the second part, the young author loses his virginity with Marie, a worldly-wise courtesan who recounts her personal story of erotic experience. Initially, she was a virginal sixteen-year-old until she was unwillingly married to an elderly suitor who wanted a younger mistress. In return for her acquiescence, though, she has acquired sexual freedom and experience. However, as the reader later learns, she subsequently becomes a tabula rasa, providing her body for the enjoyment of men, but not her individuality or personality.Frederick Brown: Flaubert: A Life: London: Pimlico: 2000: 112-113 In the concluding section of the novella, the adolescent narrator tries to revisit Marie, but the courtesan and her brothel of residence have vanished. The narrator takes up study toward a legal career, but has already eschewed marriage or professional life. Eventually, he dies.Frederick Brown: Flaubert: A Life: London: Pimlico: 2000: 114 Literary antecedents In his biography of Flaubert, Frederick Brown compares the narrator to other literary adolescents, such as Chateaubriand's Ren√© (1802), Abb√© Pr√©vost's Chevalier des Grieux (1731), Goethe's Werther (1734), Musset's Octave and others, who also fail to become adults due to their inability to reach maturity (psychological), although parents are not mentioned in November, unlike similar contemporary works. Brown concludes that it is a work of authorial adolescence.Frederick Brown: Flaubert: A Life: London: Pimlico: 2007: 115 Marie, in Frederick Brown's interpretation, is understood to be a fictionalised rendition of Eulalie Foucauld, the thirty-five-year-old Toulon innkeeper who provided Flaubert with his own sexual initiation in 1840.Frederick Brown: Flaubert: A Life: London: Pimlico: 2007: 106 NotesReferences *Gustave Flaubert: (edited by Claudine Gothor-Mersch Les Memoires d'un fou, Novembre, Pyrenees-Corse, Voyage en Italie: Paris: Gallimard (Folio): 2001.

ISSN 0891-1851 The design was sold initially by Sunrise Aircraft of Sheridan, Oregon and is currently produced by Thunderbird Aviation of Ray, Michigan. Development The single seat SNS-8 Hiperlight was designed by the Sorrell brothers in 1982 at the request of the US Rotax engine distributor to provide an enclosed cockpit aircraft design to utilize the Rotax 277 engine. The resulting aircraft was a scaled-down version of the very successful Sorrell Hiperbipe aerobatic cabin biplane and with an empty weight of fit the US ultralight category. The series designation of \\"SNS\\" stands for Sorrell Negative Stagger. The aircraft is described as easy to fly, with light control forces and well balanced controls. The aircraft has full-span ailerons on the bottom wing that droop together when the stick is pulled back, giving the same effect as flaps in the landing flare. is sufficient to power the design and it does not require larger engines. Since the Rotax 277 has been out of production for many years engines such as the 2si 460 or Hirth F-33 are often used. Design The aircraft features a welded steel tube forward fuselage, with a detachable aluminium tube aft fuselage. The rear fuselage can be easily removed for transport or storage in ten minutes. The wings are also constructed from aluminium tubes and the whole aircraft is covered in aircraft fabric. The SNS-8 has a maximum pilot weight of . The SNS-8 kit was estimated as taking 200‚Äì300 hours to assemble. Sunrise Aircraft developed the single seat SNS-8 into the SNS-9 two-seater. The SNS-9 is minimally larger with a wingspan of versus the SNS-8's , length increased from to and gross weight increased from to . The SNS-9 uses the Rotax 503 as its standard powerplant and had an optional Wankel engine available.

It currently consists of the 1st Battalion, 148th Infantry Regiment, an infantry battalion of the 37th Infantry Brigade Combat Team located throughout northwest Ohio. The regiment was formed on 15 September 1917 with the redesignation of the 3rd Regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, as part of the 74th Brigade, 37th Infantry Division. Mission The 1-148th Infantry Battalion of the Ohio Army National Guard has the Federal Mission to close with the enemy by means of fire and maneuver in order to destroy or capture them or repel their assault by fire, close combat, and counterattack. The State Mission of the Battalion is to provide units trained and equipped for immediate deployment in support of natural disasters and civil disturbances within the state of Ohio and as an aid to civil authorities for domestic disaster preparedness and emergency response, and aid to civil authorities. Organization The 1st Battalion, 148th Infantry Regiment, Ohio Army National Guard, is part of the 37th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Columbus, Ohio. The 1-148th Infantry Battalion is composed of five assigned units: Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Walbridge, Ohio; Company A, Walbridge, Ohio; Company B, Bowling Green, Ohio; Company C, Tiffin, Ohio; Company D, Sandusky, Ohio; and one attached unit, Company G, 237th Brigade Support Battalion, Lima, Ohio. Most soldiers are on traditional reserve status who serve in the military on a part-time basis, taking time out from their families and civilian jobs to participate one weekend a month as well as two weeks of annual training each year. Since then the 148th Infantry Battalion has been redesignated, deactivated, and reactivated many times. Each of the units that made up the 148th Infantry left a record of distinguished achievements. History The 148th Infantry Regiment has participated in many military actions including: Mexican War, Civil War, Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. World War I and World War II. The 148th Infantry Regiment received the Presidential Unit Citation (Army), Philippine Presidential Unit Citation, and cited in the Order of the Day of the Belgian Army. The 148th Infantry also received the Joint Services Meritorious Unit Award for its participation in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics Detail. Seven individuals in the 148th have distinguished themselves with the Medal of Honor. Formation The 148th Infantry Regiment was designated in June 1846 at Camp Washington, OH, as the 2nd Regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry. The years of the Civil War brought several antecedents of the 148th Infantry, namely the 2nd and the 6th Ohio Volunteer Regiments. The 16th Infantry Regiment was formed in the area of Ohio now being served by the 148th Infantry. 1898 saw the 16th Regiment back on active duty as the 6th Ohio and moving once again to the deep South and within a year was moving by foot, rail and ship to Cienfuegos, Cuba and Trinidad. In the years following, men from the 2nd and 6th Ohio Regiments served in the Philippine insurrection and the Boxer uprising, and in such peacetime service as at Dayton during the catastrophic flood of 1913. 1916 and Pancho Villa The year 1916 brought Pancho Villa's raid on Columbus, New Mexico. On 14 July 1916, the 3rd Infantry, Ohio National Guard, direct predecessor of the 148th Infantry, was mustered into federal service and rushed to duty on the Mexican border at El Paso, Texas. There, the Guardsmen received the training which was soon to be put to its most severe test to date. Several units were never mustered out of service from border duty but were sent directly to camps for additional training. It was on 15 September 1917 that the 3rd Ohio was redesignated the 148th Infantry, 74th Brigade, 37th Infantry Division. 1917 and WWI During World War I, in the front lines at Baccarat and the Pannes, in the Meuse-Argonne and Ypres-Lys offenses at Recicourt and Avocourt, men of the 148th fought in the three strenuous months which were to bring victory to the allied troops. It was the Ypres-Lys campaign that saw the crowning achievement of the 148th. There the Regiment, first of all the allied troops, crossed the Scheldt River in Belgium on 2 November 1918 and maintained the crossing in spite of heavy losses from devastating machine gun and shell fire. It was there, too, that the regimental motto, \\"We'll do it,\\" was inspired. Among the more distinguished members of the 148th was Pvt. Wilk Gunckle, Company M, 148th Infantry, recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross for his extraordinary heroism near Heurne, Belgium on 3 November 1918. According to the postwar attestation by the Adjutant-General, \\"He volunteered and guided ammunition carriers to advanced positions, despite the fact that he was seriously wounded in the face, which made it necessary to hold a bandage in place during the journey to and from the front. After receiving treatment at the first-aid station he returned to his duties.\\"Office of the Adjutant General of the Army, Congressional Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Cross, and the Distinguished Service Medal Issued by the War Department Since April 6, 1917 (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1920), p. 563. With the signing of the Armistice, the 148th stayed on in Europe for several months before it returned to the United States and was demobilized. 1 July 1921 the 148th Infantry was reorganized as such. It was on 27 September 1923 that the 148th Infantry regimental insignia was approved - the first in the United States to receive official War Department sanction. The crest has seventeen (17) silver arrows, banded by a sprig of buckeye on a wreath of blue and gold, which are the regimental colors. The seventeen arrows signify Ohio, which was the seventeenth state to be admitted to the Union. The shield is azure, for infantry, divided by a red fess, bordered by two gold bands with two fleurs-de-lis representing the offensive and defensive actions in which the Regiment participated in France. The lion represents Belgium, where the Regiment engaged in the Ypres-Lys offensive. The red fess, wavy and bordered by the two gold bands, represents the Scheldt River which, of all the allied troops, was crossed first by the 148th Infantry on 2 November 1918. The regimental motto, \\"We'll Do It,\\" inscribed below the shield was inspired during this crossing and became a battle cry that inspired the members of this Regiment to rise above the normal call of duty and to go on to soundly defeat an enemy of superior numbers and to bring about a great victory for the allies. The interwar years The years 1921 to 1940 constituted a period of rebuilding and peacetime service. The 148th was called to duty at Sandusky following a destructive tornado in 1924 and at Cincinnati during the disastrous flood of 1937. The Guard of Honor at the funeral for President Warren G. Harding included men of the 148th. When strikes taxed the efforts of civilian authorities, the 148th was called to help maintain peace and protect property. WWII 15 October 1940 found the 148th Infantry, as part of the 37th Division, back in active federal service and training in the deep South at Camp Shelby. Shortly after its arrival at its training station, the 148th received a large number of selective service personnel and started a long training program designed to make it one of the finest fighting units in the U.S. Army. After 16 months of rigorous training, the unit moved to Indiantown Gap and finished off its pre-embarkation training designed for European service. With the Japanese sweeping to seemingly easy victories against our undermanned Pacific defenses, the 37th was rushed to the Islands to set up a series of island defenses designed to stop the advances and island hopping of the Japanese. The 148th landed at Suva, Fiji Islands, in early June 1942 and immediately set up a long coastal defense on the western part of Viti Levu. This program, coupled with vigorous jungle training, fitted the 148th for its baptism of fire on New Georgia. July 1943 found the 148th under command of Col. Stuart A. Baxter fighting the best Japanese had to offer in the battle for Munda airstrip. It took only one campaign and the veterans of the 148th could be proud of this new fighting unit. Lt. Col. (now Brig. Gen.) Delbert Schultz took the 3rd Battalion on a special mission with a Marine raider force and hit the Japanese at Bairoko Harbor and fought their way through some of the toughest terrain in the Solomon Islands to tie up with the remainder of the 148th in the final push for the airstrip. After but a brief rest unloading ships at Guadacanal, the 148th was again to lead the way for the 37th and follow the 3rd Marine Division into Bougainville. Once the perimeter defenses were set, it was a matter of marking time until the Japanese 6th Division hit. Early March 1944 found them doing just that, making a penetration of the 145th lines near Hill 700. The 2nd Battalion, under the command of Lt. Col. (now Col.) Herbert W. Radcliffe, was ordered to counter-attack and drive the Japanese from the Hill. After a brief but bloody battle, the 2nd Battalion restored the lines. Within a week the 2nd Battalion again was called upon to back up the 129th Infantry in its sector. For their heroic and courageous efforts, three units of the 148th Infantry received the Presidential Unit Citation. January 1945 saw the 148th pushing ashore at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon Island, and heading toward Manila. To the veterans of the 148th, there can be no doubt as to which unit reached Manila first. Along the way such strongholds as Clark Field, Fort Stotensburg and Santa Tomas had to be neutralized. Following the fall of Manila, the 148th pushed on toward Balete Pass and thence onward to Baguio and the fall of the summer capital. Before the 148th could catch their breath they were on the move again, this time up through the Cagayen Valley and moving toward Aparri before the Japanese finally surrendered. Post WWII From September to December 1945, the 148th performed occupational tasks in Luzon before they returned to the United States. Once more a job of reorganization followed the deactivation of the 37th Division back in Ohio. 15 January 1952 found the 148th back in the deep South, this time at Camp Polk, LA. The 148th Regiment was reorganized 1 April 1963 to consist only of the 1st Battalion, 148th Infantry (written 1-148th) an element of the 37th Infantry Division. 11 September 2001 After 11 September 2001, A-D Companies of the 1-148 Infantry activated to federal active duty on 6 October 2001 and shipped to Ft. Knox, KY, for mobilization training and validation. HHC and E Companies soon followed, and activated to federal active duty on 15 October 2001. Prior to moving to Ft. Knox, KY, the battalion headquarters set up shop at Rickenbacker National Guard Base in Columbus, Ohio, from 24 September to 8 October 2001, in order to provide command and control over the mobilization. As of early 2002, the 148th Infantry was standing guard over American federal installations on its home soil, across the Mid-West region of the United States, in support of Operation Noble Eagle. Mission to Kosovo Under the command of Task Force Shield Commander Lieutenant Colonel Gordon L. Ellis. The 1-148th Infantry, Ohio Army National Guard was mobilized in June 2004 for four months of training prior to a six-month deployment to Kosovo as peacekeepers as part of Operation Joint Guardian rotation KFOR-6A. for the assignment on the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo. The soldiers trained for 3 months at Camp Atterbury, IN and then one month at Hohenfels, Bavaria, Germany. The soldiers arrived in Kosovo in August 2004 beginning their mission stationed at Camp Monteith, and Camp Bondsteel, in the MNB-East (Multi National Brigade) sector and returned in February 2005. Hurricane Katrina As part of Task Force Buckeye, under the Command of Lieutenant Colonel Gordon L. Ellis. The 1-148th Infantry, Ohio Army National Guard was mobilized on 30 August 2005 and sent to New Orleans, LA. for Hurricane Katrina relief. The 1-148th IN was assigned to the Super Dome in order to install stability and facilitate the evacuation of all civilians. They returned in late September 2005. Operation Iraqi Freedom  The 1-148th was deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) 2007‚Äì2008. They were mobilized in January 2008 and trained for three months at Fort Hood TX, then they were sent to Camp Arifjan Kuwait and conducted convoy security and escort operations throughout Iraq and Kuwait. They returned in December 2008. Operation Enduring Freedom The 1-148th received notification in May 2010 of a possible deployment to Afghanistan in late 2011. They were mobilized in early 2012 and sent for training at Camp Shelby MS then were deployed to Afghanistan in RC-North in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in January 2012, located primarily at FOB Griffin, COP Qaisar and COP Ghormach. A detachment of two companies were assigned to the NTM-A mission in several bases throughout Afghanistan. During the 148th's deployment, three soldiers were KIA on 4 April 2012 in the city of Maimana, Afghanistan. The 148th returned home in October 2012. The 1-148th was mobilized in 2017 and conducted pre-deployment training at Fort Bliss, TX. The Battalion subsequently deployed for nine months to Jordan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (Spartan Shield). Heraldry=Coat of armsHeraldic description= *Shield: Azure, a fess wavy Gules fimbriated Or, between two fleurs-de-lis in chief and a rampant lion in base of the last. *Crest: From a wreath Or and Azure, a sheaf of seventeen arrows Argent, bound by a sprig of buckeye (aesculus glabra) fructed Proper (two leaves bursting burr). *Motto: WE'LL DO IT =Symbolism= The shield is blue for Infantry divided by a wavy fess of red, bordered by two gold bands, representing the Escaut River in Belgium, which the Regiment, under heavy fire, was the first of the Allied Troops to cross during World War I, costing the lives of many men, but held in the face of concentrated artillery fire and in the face of counterattacks. Two gold fleurs-de-lis, taken from the ancient French Arms denote service in France, the holding of two sectors in that country, the gold lion rampant is taken from the arms of Belgium and denotes service in that country in the Ypres-Lys offensive. At the time of the crossing of the Escaut River, the units attempting the act were just a little doubtful as to how a swift river could be crossed without pontoons. Lieutenant Colonel Marlin, then Major Marlin, reminded them of a certain ceremony that was to be performed on reaching the Rhine, and with the catch phrase \\"We'll Do It,\\" the soldiers fell to work, cut down a tree across the Escaut and crossed, single file, over the tree. =Background= The coat of arms was approved on 21 April 1923.

Me is a documentary film about the United Nations by first-time filmmakers Ami Horowitz and Matthew Groff. It premiered at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam in November 2009.IMDB Release dates The documentary - or \\"docutainment\\" according to Horowitz - which began production in 2006, is a critique that depicts the United Nations as an organization that has drifted from its founding principles to the point where it now \\"enables evil and sows global chaos.\\"\\"Give up the day job\\" on the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam website (November 28, 2010) The film follows Horowitz and Groff as they travel and look to expose the numerous scandals and cases of abuse of the U.N. Through interviews with involved parties and archived footage, they provide a look into events such as a shooting that has gone forgotten, where UN soldiers opened fire on unarmed protestors and the ‚ÄúOil-for-Food‚Äù program. Also featured is evidence of the use of UN funds and equipment to support terrorist activity through complacency or complicity, including video footage of insurgents loading assault rifles and RPGs into a UN vehicle to make an escape. Some scenes of U.N. Me were shot inside the headquarters of the United Nations in New York City.Lee, Matthew Russel. \\"Satiric Film About UN Triggers Question, Who Let Its Makers In?\\" Inner City Press (November 21, 2008) Background Some scenes were filmed inside the headquarters of the United Nations in New York City Horowitz is a former investment banker who has written for the Huffington Post,\\"Ami Horowitz\\" bio on the Huffington Post website the National Review and the Weekly Standard;\\"Our Team\\" on the U.N. Me official website Matthew Groff has been a post-production supervisor and assistant producer. Horowitz cites the idea for the film coming from being upset with the unrest in Rwanda and the lack of involvement from the United Nations. Horowitz told Brian Lamb on C-SPAN that ‚Äúwithin two weeks‚Äù of seeing Moore's film, ‚ÄúI had quit my job [at Lehman Brothers] and started raising money to make the [movie].‚Äù In addition to admiring Michael Moore's documentary style, Horowitz has confessed to being influenced by Sacha Baron Cohen's interviewing technique, and has said that he \\"was so enamored with\\" both Moore's and Baron Cohen's approaches to filmmaking that he \\"hired much of their teams.\\" Writers from The Daily Show, The Onion, and from Michael Moore's films contributed to the documentary. Views Horowitz has said that some people at the UN ‚Äúactively want to move the world in a bad direction‚Äù while others \\"move around in a moral fog\\". As an example of UN bureaucrats' ‚Äúfoggy moral vision‚Äù he cites Kofi Annan's comment, apropos of Rwanda, that ‚Äúthe UN must stay impartial even in the face of genocide.‚Äù In another segment, about the organization's failure to stop the killings in Darfur, Horowitz asks Sudan‚Äôs UN ambassador why his country stones gays after one sexual act but lesbians after four. ‚Äú'No, no, no,' the ambassador corrects him. 'Woman, if she is married, she will be stoned immediately.'‚Äù Reception The film had a limited U.S. release in June 2012, to mixed reviews. Owing to its limited release, the film was unable to recoup its $4 million budget at the box office. Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times called U.N. Me \\"a sassy documentary that suggests the United Nations is doing more harm than good\\", saying \\"Mr. Horowitz, the on-camera gadfly, finds ways to work wit into decidedly unpleasant subject matter.\\" The New York Daily News described U.N. Me as a \\"Michael Moore-style expos√© of the United Nations\\" and singled out a scene in which co-director Horowitz wandered through the halls of the UN building \\"searching for someone actually working at their desk\\". Some critics, however, were not entirely impressed by Horowitz's attempts to emulate Michael Moore's style: \\"Covering a lot of ground in colorful, pacey fashion, the docu is nonetheless somewhat compromised itself by co-director Ami Horowitz's insistence on playing the Michael Moore/Morgan Spurlock role of onscreen provocateur...These japes only do a disservice to the film's many serious allegations.\\" Brian Brooks, the editor of IndieWire, said \\"I have to say, this is one of those rare moments when a film seriously has challenged my personal view\\" and called the movie \\"funny and engaging\\". Matthew Russel Lee of the Inner City Press was shocked to see that Horowitz was able to enter the Security Council. Horowitz has noted that while both conservatives and liberals in the U.S. responded enthusiastically to the film, ‚ÄúEuropeans generally are particularly hostile to the movie‚Äù because they are put off by ‚Äúthe idea of a moral high ground‚Äù and consider ‚Äúpreaching against a particular ideology, for instance radical Islam, is dubious, possibly even racist.‚Äù Awards and honors U.N.

The first underground shaft mine was built in the region in 1874 near Scammon. Prior to that, there was scattered small- scale drift mining and surface mining of coal, but the construction of the first shaft mine ushered in an era which eventually led to as many as 290 significant mines and numerous other small (\\"dinky\\") mines in the two counties. The most active period of mining in the region was 1890-1910, and most of the coal camps were dismantled by the 1930s or 1940s. Mechanized strip mining overtook underground mining in output in 1931, and that combined with competition from eastern coal led to a demise in importance of underground mining in the region. Santa Fe Mining Company A major mining disaster took place November 9, 1888 in shaft 2 of the Santa Fe Mining Company mine near Frontenac, Kansas when 150 miners lost their lives in an explosion. Pittsburg & Midway Coal Company One of the oldest continuously running coal companies in the United States was the Pittsburg & Midway Coal Company, founded in Pittsburg, Kansas in 1885. It lasted under that name even after its move to Denver, Colorado when the Kansas mines closed, until September 2007, when Chevron which owned the company, merged it with its Molycorp Inc. coal mining division to form Chevron Mining, thus ending the Pittsburg corporate name.

The temple was originally located in Potong Pasir from where it was moved three more times before finally coming to the present location, adjacent to Foo Hai Ch'an Buddhist Monastery, in front of Paya Lebar MRT station exit C at Geylang East Avenue 2, Singapore. History Sri Sivan Temple was originally present in Potong Pasir. The Sivalinga was moved to a spot in the lower end of Dhoby Ghaut, then to a site near where MacDonald House stands today, and then on to the Orchard Road site where it used to be until 1983. The temple was rebuilt as a solid structure in the early 1850s at the Orchard Road site under which the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station is located. The Sivalinga was known to be worshiped at this site well before 1850.. In 1898, a further phase of the recorded development of the Sri Sivan Temple began. The reconstruction work took several years to complete. One Mr V Nagappa Chetty and his wife were responsible for this, largely with their own funds and from donations collected from local Hindus. During the Second World War, some of the statues of secondary deities and a part of the temple structure were damaged by shells that landed around it. Towards the end of the war, renovations were made to the temple and a consecration ceremony was held in July 1943. In 1954, the Municipal Commissioners wanted the temple to be setback from the road to widen Orchard Road. After long drawn discussions, a compromise was reached between the Board and the City Council. In consideration of the temple giving up of the front land, the temple was given $50,000 and allowed to be rebuilt at the same site. Plans to rebuild the temple were drawn up in 1957. Local contractors completed the construction works in April 1962 and skilled craftsmen from India carried out the sculptural and ornamental works. The consecration ceremony was held on 9 December 1964. Serangoon premises In 1983, the Government decided to acquire the land on which the temple stood. An MRT station was to be built underground. Therefore, a transit temple was built next to the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple at Serangoon Road while a more suitable and permanent site was being identified. The temple was demolished and all its deities where temporarily shifted to a new site at Serangoon Road. All the god-forms from the Orchard Road Temple were installed in the new site at Serangoon Road which allowed for all daily prayers and festivals celebrated to be continued. Geylang premises Sri Sivan Temple in Geylang The Hindu Endowments Board had intended to make the new temple unique in appearance, features and facilities. The Board and the management committee of the temple consulted well-known temple architects in India. The Board sent a team to study the best of both the North and South Indian Temples. What followed was a unique design with an octagonal structure with a multi-purpose hall and staff quarters. The new temple was built at a cost of $6 million on a 3,000 sq. meter plot at Geylang East. The new site is about four-and-a-half times bigger than the temple's former site at Orchard Road. After ten years of temporary residence at Serangoon Road, the Sri Sivan Temple was consecrated at its present Geylang East site on 30 May 1993. Management Committee An order placing Sri Sivan Temple under the Mohammedan and Hindu Endowments Board (set up in 1907) was gazetted on 18 October 1915. In 1968, the Hindu Endowments Board (HEB) was formed to manage four temples including the Sri Sivan Temple. The Hindu Endowments Board (HEB) under the purview of the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) manages Sri Sivan Temple.

Photograph by Julia Margaret Cameron, 1865. The Lost Leader is an 1845 poem by Robert Browning first published in his book Dramatic Romances and Lyrics. It berates William Wordsworth, for what Browning considered his desertion of the liberal cause, and his lapse from his high idealism. More generally, it is an attack on any liberal leader who has deserted his cause. It is one of Browning's \\"best known, if not actually best, poems\\". Text William Wordsworth, the subject of the poem. Portrait by Benjamin Robert Haydon, 1842. Context From an early age, Browning (b. 1812) had been an admirer of the (early) works of Wordsworth (b. 1770). As observes, Browning had sought to become \\"Wordsworth's radical successor\\", and his attitude towards Wordsworth was \\"a test model of a strong poet's quest for self-definition against an overbearing predecessor\\". The poem's lines \\"We that had loved him so, followed him, honoured him, / ... / Made him our pattern to live and to die!\\" refer to this. However, when he began to perceive Wordsworth sliding into conservative politics and the Church of England, he became increasingly disillusioned. Wordsworth in his early days had been a youthful rebel, defended Paine's Rights of Man and the French Revolution, and been described by Coleridge as a 'semi-atheist', and by himself as a 'patriot of the world'. However, as England went to war against France, the condition in France deteriorated, the Reign of Terror came to be, and Robespierre was executed, Wordsworth became disillusioned, and, following Southey and Coleridge, \\"gave up his revolutionary dreams and settled down to the life of a recluse\\". Browning's poem Sordello, written between 1836 and 1840, was partly aimed as a \\"correction\\" of Wordsworth's politics and poetics, but neither the audience nor Wordsworth saw this; instead the poem acquired a reputation for incomprehensibility, and Browning was called \\"the madman who had foisted the unreadable Sordello upon the world\\". For his part, Wordsworth seems to have thought very little of Browning, and one of the few recorded statements he made about Browning was in a letter written to a friend on the occasion of Browning's wedding in 1846 to Elizabeth Barrett: In 1813 Wordsworth obtained the position of distributor of stamps. This government position was already sufficient to induce Shelley to write a sonnet of mild reprimand, \\"To Wordsworth\\". In 1842 he accepted a civil list pension of ¬£300 from the government, and in 1843 when Southey died, he accepted the position of Poet Laureate. Browning saw this acquiescence to orthodox tradition‚Äîwith its image of Wordsworth literally on his knees in front of the queen‚Äîas his \\"final surrender to the forces of conservatism\\". The poem arose from the resulting hatred and indignation, and was published in November 1845, in Dramatic Romances and Lyrics. The \\"handful of silver\\" is a reference to thirty pieces of silver, a phrase associated with betrayal or selling out. The lines \\"he boasts his quiescence / Still bidding crouch whom the rest bade aspire\\" referred to what Browning saw as one of Wordsworth's worst crimes as the lost leader, that of boasting his acquiescence and instructing the oppressed masses to patiently \\"crouch\\" and bear their burden instead of rising up in revolt. This Wordsworth had done in his 1833 poem called \\"The Warning\\". Wordsworth died five years later, in 1850. Browning later came to slightly regret the poem, and possibly even to see Wordsworth in a positive light again, as he made a few minor revisions, moderating the poem's attack. However, Baker writes that \\"His attack on Wordsworth was not as unfair as some have claimed, and as Browning seems to have feared in later life\\", and Robert Wilson Lynd writes, of Browning's views: Reception The poem was widely anthologised, and recognised for its direct attack. One editor wrote: Another wrote that the verses \\"have more bad feeling than poetry\\". Stephen Fry quotes the poem as an example of the use of dactylic metre to great effect, creating verse with \\"great rhythmic dash and drive\\". The poem is not in pure dactylic tetrameter, but catalectic. There was much discussion on whether the poem was addressed to Wordsworth. In response to queries, Browning always made it clear that the poem was based on Wordsworth, but stopped short of saying that it was directly addressed to Wordsworth himself, instead saying that the portrait was \\"purposely disguised a little, used in short as an artist uses a model, retaining certain characteristic traits, and discarding the rest\\". Thus the poem was on the Lost Leader in the abstract, with Wordsworth being the most prominent concrete example. In one ambivalent letter, he wrote: Literary allusions The Lost Leader was used as the title of a book about Wordsworth by Hugh I'Anson Fausset in 1933. The Lost Leader is the title of a book of poems by Mick Imlah, published in 2008. The poem was parodied by Fun (a Victorian competitor of Punch) when the women of Girton College dissolved their Browning Society and spent the funds on chocolate. The lines began: \\"They just for a handful of chocolate left us / Just for some sweetmeats to put in their throats\\". In one edition of the poem, the first line had been printed as \\"Just for a handle of silver he left us\\", which the proof-reader tried to justify on the grounds that as no one understood Browning, it would be all right. Nigel Birch attacked the Macmillan government with the words \\"Never glad confident morning again\\". The title of Joe Haines's memoir of the final years of Prime Minister Harold Wilson's government, Glimmers of Twilight,J. Haines, Glimmers of Twilight, (2003) frontispiece alludes to the poem. The poem is frequently alluded to by Horace Rumpole.John Mortimer, Rumpole for the Prosecution, Rumpole Redeemed, Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders. The lines \\"We that had loved him so, followed him, honoured him, / ... / Made him our pattern to live and to die!\\" are framed as the deciding quiz bowl question in Nan Willard Kappo's Cheating Lessons, published in 2002. An excerpt of the poem is featured in Cassandra Clare's Clockwork Angel published in 2010. Different approaches to the poem‚Äîpersonal idiosyncratic approaches and those informed by historical context or metrical structure‚Äîare discussed as an introduction to \\"cognitive poetics\\".

This district is named after the large amount of tree (water mill) in the region. This district was created by state decree 641 of 15 December 1938 and designated as the 3rd District in 1063 by state law of 28 January 1944. this district had been explored long limestone for cement production by the National Company of Portland cement in Guaxindiba. Jardim Catarina is considered the largest subdivision and neighborhood of Latin America, despite having a strip of land smaller than other neighborhoods located in Sao Goncalo, received this title due to large amount of 12x30m plots. The neighborhood is situated at sea level and its total area is larger than the municipality from Curitiba. The origin goes back to the Jardin Catherine old Orangery Farm, whose owner was Mr. Julio Pedroso Lima who bought on June 26, 1903 Bank of the Republic of Brazil S / A. This ranch house next door had a large chapel, fifteen houses for settlers on the farm, the mill and Rural School (for children of settlers on the farm). After the death of its owner in 1925, was donated to the school hall. Since 1947, Julio Pedroso Lima Junior, son of the owner of Finance sold a few plots of land to Bishop John Matta, in the town now called Santa Luzia that donated a portion of land for construction of a chapel and elsewhere to increase the area of the school grounds. The houses built on the farm were donated to the residents (settlers and squatters). In 1932, the farm is now run by his nephew Americo Lima. Was subdivided by his grandson Antonio de Lima Barros Filho. Its shares gave rise to existing neighborhoods Orangery, Santa Luzia and Boa Vista Jardim Catarina. Rivers Jardim Catarina is cut by the Alcantara River which has a length of 25 km. The drainage site is currently done by Walloons surrounding neighborhood, which stretches for having committed the narrow flow of water causing frequent floods. With the lack of drainage works in a direct compromise with the existing health facilities. Among other existing gutters in the neighborhood, the Precious Wallonia, the Walloon Cedae Garden and Catherine had their works prioritized by the project because they are considered the most important in solving the problems previously faced by this community. Located in the neighborhood Walloon Garden Catarina has a drainage area of approximately 1.7 km2 pouring their areas in the channel Isaura Santana, who in turn forwards its waters until the Guaxindiba River which flows into Guanabara Bay. The present course of Walloon Garden Catarina extends about 3 km, crossing busy areas of the neighborhood, returning home and lots, making his way is very sinuous, and intercept the BR 101. Already the Walloon CEDAE - drainage area 3.2 km2, developing since the RFFSA until its confluence with the River Alcantara a length of about 2.4 km. Climate The climate in Jardim Catarina is what is seen throughout the city of S√£o Gon√ßalo mild and dry (20 to 35). The neighborhood The neighborhood is located in the municipality of S√£o Gon√ßalo, part of the district water mill, which is the 3rd district of the municipality of Sao Goncalo. The neighborhood is bordered on the north and south and east respectively by Amaral Peixoto Highway (RJ-104) and the channel Gill in 1975 there was an appreciation of the lots, with the emergence of new industry along Route 104. Thus the district has different sections: Jardim Catarina old, new and newest respectively. The development of the settlement has undergone great changes, a major was the opening of the Rio-Niter√≥i Bridge in 1974 and construction of highway BR 101. At the beginning of the 80s, crossed the allotment modifying its internal structure and promoting the occupation of the area north of the old sector. Currently the lots are laid out, with houses in brick, although the residences have satisfactory standards, the district has no infrastructure and urbanization sufficient local demand. The main problem is sewage that has its decaying facilities, and it was great presence of graves in the open as an alternative to collecting systems. Reside in the district unofficially, around 200.00 people economically composed of a small part of an emerging middle class and the other composed entirely of employees, under-employed and freelancers. Most have trained manpower and not specialized in construction (masons, helpers, carpenters, painters, laborers and others), salespeople, mechanics, school teachers who do not exercise the function and the camels. It has been in the neighborhood several micro and small enterprises. Large portion of residents are illiterate and the primary school, some with first- degree and second complete incomplete. With high school portion is very small and not significant if you have a count of students because it is very rare. The local market is quite diverse along major roads (5), can be found all products for the everyday: food, construction materials and so on ... except clothing, which leads the resident moves to Alcantara Niteroi and Rio de Janeiro. Another strong point of the neighborhood is the provision of services. They are many varied. With professional and technical expertise in construction, electricity, cars etc. .. It also has small business mostly informal in various activities, mainly focused on the production and installation of iron gates, roofs, windows etc. ... Professionals related to the automotive sector as the traditional workshop electric automobiles BIGODE located near the bridge of the BR-101.

The rice is made by frying raw short grain rice with onions and spices in butter or ghee and then cooking it in a meat stock. A hard boiled egg which has been deep-fried is also a common addition. The traditional recipe always contains three meat items however modern versions can include just a single meat, such as fish or chicken or as a vegetarian version.

R. Skelton The 17th act of the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf includes Beowulf's fight with a dragon, the third monster he encounters in the epic. On his return from Heorot, where he killed Grendel and Grendel's mother, Beowulf becomes king of the Geats and rules wisely for fifty years until a slave awakens and angers a dragon by stealing a jeweled cup from its lair. When the angry dragon mercilessly burns the Geats' homes and lands, Beowulf decides to fight and kill the monster personally. He and his thanes climb to the dragon's lair where, upon seeing the beast, the thanes flee in terror, leaving only Wiglaf to battle at Beowulf's side. When the dragon wounds Beowulf fatally, Wiglaf slays it. This depiction indicates the growing importance and stabilization of the modern concept of the dragon within European mythology. Beowulf is the first piece of English literature to present a dragon-slayer. Although many motifs common to the Beowulf dragon existed in the Scandinavian and Germanic literature, the Beowulf poet was the first to combine features and present a distinctive fire-breathing dragon. The Beowulf dragon was later copied in literature with similar themes such as J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit (1937), one of the forerunners of modern high fantasy. The dragon fight, occurring at the end of the poem, is foreshadowed in earlier scenes. The fight with the dragon symbolizes Beowulf's stand against evil and destruction, and, as the hero, he knows that failure will bring destruction to his people after many years of peace. The dragon itself acts as a mock \\"gold-king\\"; one who sees attacking Beowulf's kingdom as suitable retribution for the theft of just a single cup.Nitzsche, Jane C. \\"The Structural Unity of Beowulf: The Problem of Grendel's Mother\\". Poetry Criticism, vol. 22. 1999. p. 290. The scene is structured in thirds, ending with the deaths of the dragon and Beowulf. Story After his battles against Grendel's mother and Grendel, Beowulf returns home and becomes king of the Geats. Fifty years pass with Beowulf in charge, when a local dragon is angered when a slave enters its lair and takes a cup from its treasure. The creature attacks the neighboring towns in revenge. Beowulf and a troop of men leave to find the dragon's lair. Beowulf tells his men to stay outside, that this fight is his alone, but the dragon proves too strong and mortally wounds Beowulf. Meanwhile, his kinsman Wiglaf scolds the other members of the troop for not going in to help, before coming to Beowulf's aid. He cuts the dragon in the belly to reduce the flames, and Beowulf deals the fatal blow. In his death-speech, Beowulf nominates Wiglaf as his heir and asks for a monument to be built for him on the shoreline.  Background  Sigurd and Fafnir by Arthur Rackham, from his 1911 illustrations for Richard Wagner's Siegfried and The Twilight of the Gods '' is the oldest extant heroic poem in English and the first to present a dragon slayer. The legend of the dragon-slayer already existed in Norse sagas such as the tale of Sigurd and Fafnir, and the Beowulf poet incorporates motifs and themes common to dragon-lore in the poem. Beowulf is the earliest surviving piece of Anglo- Saxon literature to feature a dragon, and it is possible that the poet had access to similar stories from Germanic legend.Rauer, p.135 Secular Germanic literature and the literature of Christian hagiography featured dragons and dragon fights.Rauer, p. 4 Although the dragons of hagiography were less fierce than the dragon in Beowulf, similarities exist in the stories such as presenting the journey to the dragon's lair, cowering spectators, and the sending of messages relaying the outcome of the fight.Rauer, p. 74 The dragon with his hoard is a common motif in early Germanic literature with the story existing to varying extents in the Norse sagas, but it is most notable in the V√∂lsunga saga and in Beowulf.Evans, pp. 29 Beowulf preserves existing medieval dragon-lore, most notably in the extended digression recounting the Sigurd/Fafnir tale. Nonetheless, comparative contemporary narratives did not have the complexity and distinctive elements written into Beowulf's dragon scene. Beowulf is a hero who previously killed two monsters. The scene includes extended flashbacks to the Geatish-Swedish wars, a detailed description of the dragon and the dragon-hoard, and ends with intricate funerary imagery.Rauer, p.32 Beowulf scholar J. R. R. Tolkien considered the dragon in Beowulf to be one of only two real dragons in northern European literature, writing of it, \\"dragons, real dragons, essential both to the machinery and the ideas of a poem or tale, are actually rare. In northern literature there are only two that are significant ... we have but the dragon of the V√∂lsungs, F√°fnir, and Beowulf's bane.\\"Tolkien, p. 4 Furthermore, Tolkien believes the Beowulf poet emphasizes the monsters Beowulf fights in the poem and claims the dragon is as much of a plot device as anything. Tolkien expands on Beowulf's dragon in his own fiction, which indicates the lasting impact of the Beowulf poem.Evans, pp. 25‚Äì26 Within the plot structure, however, the dragon functions differently in Beowulf than in Tolkien's fiction. The dragon fight ends Beowulf, while Tolkien uses the dragon motif (and the dragon's love for treasure) to trigger a chain of events in The Hobbit.Evans, p. 30 Characterization The Beowulf dragon is the earliest example in literature of the typical European dragon and first incidence of a fire-breathing dragon. The Beowulf dragon is described with Old English terms such as draca (dragon), and wyrm (reptile, or serpent), and as a creature with a venomous bite.Rauer, p. 32, p .63 Also, the Beowulf poet created a dragon with specific traits: a nocturnal, treasure-hoarding, inquisitive, vengeful, fire-breathing creature.Rauer, p. 35 The fire is likely symbolic of the hellfire of the devil, reminiscent of the monster in the Book of Job. In the Septuagint, Job's monster is characterized as a draco, and identified with the devil. Job's dragon would have been accessible to the author of Beowulf, as a Christian symbol of evil, the \\"great monstrous adversary of God, man and beast alike.\\"Rauer, p. 52 A study of German and Norse texts reveals three typical narratives for the dragonslayer: a fight for the treasure, a battle to save the slayer's people, or a fight to free a woman.Evans, p.28 The characteristics of Beowulf's dragon appear to be specific to the poem, and the poet may have melded together dragon motifs to create a dragon with specific traits that weave together the complicated plot of the narrative. Importance The third act of the poem differs from the first two. In Beowulf's two earlier battles, Grendel and Grendel's mother are characterized as descendants of Cain: \\"[Grendel] had long lived in the land of monsters / since the creator cast them out / as the kindred of Cain\\"Alexander, p. 6 and seem to be humanoid: in the poet's rendition they can be seen as giants, trolls, or monsters. The dragon, therefore, is a stark contrast to the other two antagonists.Mellinkoff, Ruth. Cain's monstrous progeny in Beowulf: part I, Noachic tradition Anglo-Saxon England (1979), 8 : 143‚Äì162 Cambridge University Press. Retrieved 2010-05-18 Moreover, the dragon is more overtly destructive. He burns vast amounts of territory and the homes of the Geats: \\"the dragon began to belch out flames / and burn bright homesteads\\".Heaney, p.157Rauer, p. 74‚Äì75 Beowulf's fight with the dragon has been described variously as an act of either altruismClark, 43 or recklessness.Crossley-Holland, p. xiv In contrast with the previous battles, the fight with the dragon occurs in Beowulf's kingdom and ends in defeat, whereas Beowulf fought the other monsters victoriously in a land distant from his home. The dragon fight is foreshadowed with earlier events: Scyld Shefing's funeral and Sigmund's death by dragon, as recounted by a bard in Hrothgar's hall. Beowulf scholar Alexander writes that the dragon fight likely signifies Beowulf's (and by extension, society's) battle against evil.Alexander, pp. xxiv‚Äìxxv The people's fate depend on the outcome of the fight between the hero and the dragon, and, as a hero, Beowulf must knowingly face death.Alexander, pp. xxx‚Äìxxxv Wiglaf is the single warrior to stay and witness the death of the hero. Illustration by J.R. Skelton. Beowulf's eventual death from the dragon presages \\"warfare, death, and darkness\\" for his Geats.Crossley-Holland, p. vii The dragon's hoard symbolizes the vestige of an older society, now lost to wars and famine, left behind by a survivor of that period. His imagined elegy foreshadows Beowulf's death and elegy to come.Crossley-Holland, p. xvi Before he faces the dragon, Beowulf thinks of his past: his childhood and wars the Geats endured during that period, foreshadowing the future. At his death, peace in his lands will end, and his people will again suffer a period of war and hardship.Crossley- Holland, p. xvii An embattled society without \\"social cohesion\\" is represented by the avarice of the \\"dragon jealously guarding its gold hoard\\",Crossley- Holland, p. xix and the elegy for Beowulf becomes an elegy for the entire culture.Crossley-Holland, p. xxvi The dragon's hoard is representative of a people lost and antique, which is juxtaposed against the Geatish people, whose history is new and fleeting.Clark, Handbook, p. 289 As king of his people, Beowulf defends them against the dragon, and when his thanes desert him, the poem shows the disintegration of a \\"heroic society\\" which \\"depends upon the honouring of mutual obligations between lord and thane\\".Alexander, p. xxxvi Wiglaf remains loyal to his king and stays to confront the dragon. The parallel in the story lies with the similarity to Beowulf's hero Sigemund and his companion: Wiglaf is a younger companion to Beowulf and, in his courage, shows himself to be Beowulf's successor.Crossley-Holland, p. xviiiBeowulf and some fictions of the Geatish succession by Frederick M. Biggs. The presence of a companion is seen as a motif in other dragon stories, but the Beowulf poet breaks hagiographic tradition with the hero's suffering (hacking, burning, stabbing) and subsequent death.Raurer, p. 74 Moreover, the dragon is vanquished through Wiglaf's actions: although Beowulf dies fighting the dragon, the dragon dies at the hand of the companion. The dragon battle is structured in thirds: the preparation for the battle, the events prior to the battle, and the battle itself. Wiglaf kills the dragon halfway through the scene, Beowulf's death occurs \\"after two-thirds\\" of the scene,Rauer, p. 31 and the dragon attacks Beowulf three times.Alexander, p. xxv Ultimately, as Tolkien writes in Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics (1936), the death by dragon \\"is the right end for Beowulf,\\" for he claims, \\"a man can but die upon his death-day\\".Tolkien, p. 14 Critical reception=Before Tolkien In 1918, William Witherle Lawrence argued in his article \\"The Dragon and His Lair in Beowulf\\" that the fight between Beowulf and the dragon tends to receive less critical attention than other portions of the poem, commenting that \\"Grendel and his dam have, as it were, become more beloved of the commentators\\". Conversely, Kemp Malone writes in \\"The Kenning in Beowulf\\" that Beowulf's fight with the dragon receives much critical attention, but that commentators fail to note that \\"the dragon was no fighter. Not that it refused to fight when challenged, but that it did not seek out Beowulf or anyone else. It left Beowulf to do the seeking out\\". In his 1935 work Beowulf and the Seventh Century, Ritchie Girvan writes that Beowulf should be seen as having some degree of historical accuracy despite the presence of a dragon in it; he argues that \\"Tales of dragons as well as a belief in dragons survived till recent times, and the popular mind is apt to accept with credulity stories of water-monsters. The stories, moreover, are often attached to real persons and localized precisely in time and place. The habit is so well known that examples are superfluous\\". Raymond Wilson Chambers, in his Beowulf: An Introduction to the Study of the Poem with a Discussion of the Stories of Offa and Finn, says that Beowulfs dragon acts like \\"the typical dragon of Old English proverbial lore\\" because he guards treasure. W. P. Ker criticized the inclusion of Beowulf's fight with the dragon and his subsequent death in the poem, writing \\"It is as if to the end of the Odyssey there had been added some later books telling in full of the old age of Odysseus, far from the sea, and his death at the hands of Telegonus\\". Tolkien, 1936: The Monsters and the Critics In Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics, J. R. R. Tolkien noted that the dragon and Grendel are \\"constantly referred to in language which is meant to recall the powers of darkness which Christian men felt themselves to be encompassed. They are 'inmates of hell', 'adversaries of God', 'offspring of Cain', 'enemies of mankind'....And so Beowulf, for all that he moves in the world of the primitive Heroic Age of the Germans, nevertheless is almost a Christian knight\\". After Tolkien Peter Gainsford noted in the article \\"The Deaths of Beowulf and Odysseus: Narrative Time and Mythological Tale Types\\" that \\"In the twenty-first century Beowulf does not lack for commentators to defend the literary merit of the dragon episode\\". Adrien Bonjour opined in 1953 that the dragon's \\"ultimate significance in the poem\\" remains a \\"mystery\\". Seamus Heaney suggests that Beowulf's attitude towards fighting the dragon reflects his \\"chthonic wisdom refined in the crucible of experience\\", that is there is already a \\"beyond-the-grave aspect\\" to his resoluteness. As Beowulf dies from his fight with the dragon, despite defeating it, James Parker of The Atlantic writes that \\"There is no transcendence in Beowulf, and no redemption [...] kill the dragon‚Äîbut the dragon will get you anyway\\". Joan Acocella states in The New Yorker that \\"unlike Grendel and his mother, [the dragon] is less a monster than a symbol.\\"  Legacy  In From Homer to Harry Potter: A Handbook on Myth and Fantasy, Matthew Dickerson and David O'Hara argue that the Beowulf poet added the figure of the dragon to \\"the pot...that is ladeled out of by most modern fantasy writers\\"; they argued that both numerous works with villainous dragons, as well as literature with benign dragons like the My Father's Dragon books and the Pern series by Anne McCaffrey, were influenced by Beowulfs dragon. Dickerson and O'Hara further elaborated that through its dragon, Beowulf turned the \\"notion of having a monstrous evil (and not mere human foes) as the enemy\\" into \\"a hallmark of modern fantasy\\" present in C. S. Lewis' Narnia books, Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea books, and the Thomas Covenant series by Stephen Donaldson. J. R. R. Tolkien used the dragon story of Beowulf as a template for Smaug of The Hobbit; in each case, the dragon awakens upon the hoard being disturbed by one stealing a chalice and goes into a wrathful rampage until slain by another person.Clark, p. 31 Aia Hussein of the National Endowment for the Humanities has written that the fight between Harry Potter and the Hungarian Horntail in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000) by J. K. Rowling was influenced by the confrontation between the dragon and the title character in Beowulf.

He subsequently left the UFD in October 2007, objecting to the party's decision to join the Presidential Majority supporting President Denis Sassou Nguesso; according to Ngouolali, that decision was made by the leadership without properly consulting the rest of the party. He then formed a new political party, the Action for the Rebirth of Congo (ARC), which he officially launched on 12 January 2008. The ARC initially drew most of its support from the Talanga√Ø section of Brazzaville. It joined an opposition coalition, the Alliance for a New Republic (ANR), in November 2008.Roger Ngomb√©, \\"Deux partis politiques adh√®rent √† l'Alliance pour une nouvelle R√©publique\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 10 November 2008 . In February 2009, together with 17 other opposition leaders, Ngouolali signed an agreement on the creation of a front intended to defeat President Sassou Nguesso in the July 2009 presidential election.Roger Ngomb√©, \\"Dix-huit partis de l'opposition congolaise cr√©ent un front pour conqu√©rir le pouvoir\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 23 February 2009 . Ngouolali was one of 17 individuals who applied to stand as candidates in that election. However, in a ruling on 18 June 2009, the Constitutional Court rejected Ngouolali's candidacy on the grounds that he had provided a post office box number instead of identifying a place of residence. According to the Court, Ngouolali had thus failed to prove his continuous residency in Congo-Brazzaville over the preceding two years, as required by the Constitution. Ngouolali was one of four candidates whose applications were rejected by the Court.\\"D√©cision de la cour constitutionnelle du 18 Juin 2009\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 22 June 2009 . Speaking on 23 June 2009, Ngouolali complained that he did not understand why his candidate application was rejected, noting that he had documentation demonstrating his residency in Brazzaville. According to Ngouolali, an official had told him that, because he lived in an apartment, it would be acceptable for him to list a post office box instead of a street address. Nevertheless, Ngouolali stressed that he respected the Court's decision; his reluctance to criticize the Court stood in contrast to statements from some other opposition leaders, who did not hesitate to denounce the Court's rulings as politically motivated. He expressed his hope that \\"one day, when the sun of freedom, genuine democracy, national unity, and reconciliation truly shine on Congo\\", he could participate in a \\"genuine opposition\\".Thierry Noungou, \\"√âlection pr√©sidentielle : Rigobert Ngouolali explique les raisons du rejet de sa candidature\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 24 June 2009 . Marking the ARC's second anniversary at festivities in Brazzaville on 19 February 2010, Ngouolali said that the elections held under Sassou Nguesso were not genuinely democratic, and he called on his party to work for a return to the kind of democratic elections that were held in the 1990s. He argued that the ARC's strength was not reflected in the official results of the 2008 local elections.Willy Mbossa, \\"L'Action pour la renaissance du Congo c√©l√®bre son deuxi√®me d'anniversaire\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 22 February 2010 . The ARC was included in an opposition coalition, the Front of Congolese Opposition Parties (FPOC), and at FPOC's third national convention, held in Brazzaville on 9-10 April 2011, Ngouolali was elected as President of FPOC. He succeeded Cl√©ment Mierassa at the head of the coalition; its leadership was held on a rotating basis.Parfait Wilfried Douniama, \\"Vie des partis : Rigobert Ngouolali prend les r√™nes du FPOC\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 11 April 2011 .

She consistently appears on the Sunday Times Rich List with an estimated net worth of ¬£45 million, based on family assets she inherited in 1948. Early life and education Lady Juliet was born to Peter Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, Viscount Milton, the only son of the 7th Earl Fitzwilliam, and his wife, Olive Plunket. Through her mother, Juliet is a granddaughter of Benjamin Plunket, Bishop of Meath, and a great-granddaughter of Lord Plunket, Archbishop of Dublin. In 1943, when she was eight, her father inherited the title of Earl Fitzwilliam, and she became Lady Juliet. By this time, her parents' marriage was strained, and there was talk of divorce. In 1948 Earl Fitzwilliam died in a plane crash in France with his lover, Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington, the widow of the heir to the Dukedom of Devonshire and a sister of the future U. S. President John F. Kennedy. As her father's only child, Lady Juliet, still aged only thirteen, inherited his whole unentailed estate and his huge art collection. The following year, she and her mother left Wentworth Woodhouse, and most of its contents were sold.Lady Juliet also owned a large estate in Ireland, Coolattin Park, situated outside the village of Shillelagh in County Wicklow, which had been the seat of the Fitzwilliam family in Ireland since the 17th century. That was sold in 1977, and the famous \\"Tomnafinogue wood\\", one of the largest ancient oak woodlands in the British Isles and part of the former Coolattin Estate, is now under state ownership.The DiCamillo Companion Lady Juliet holds a Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of Oxford. Marriages and family life In 1960, Lady Juliet married Victor Hervey, 6th Marquess of Bristol, twenty years her senior, eighteen days after he inherited his title upon his father's death. He had been divorced the previous year and, in his twenties, had been adjudicated a bankrupt, declared the \\"No.1 Playboy of Mayfair\\", and jailed for jewel robbery. The couple had two children: * Lord Nicholas Hervey (26 November 1961 ‚Äì 26 January 1998) * Lady Ann Hervey (26 February 1965), stillborn The couple separated in 1965 and divorced in 1972.

The N50 is similar to a mean or median of lengths, but has greater weight given to the longer contigs. It is used widely in genome assembly, especially in reference to contig lengths within a draft assembly. There are also the related U50, UL50, UG50, UG50%, N90, NG50, and D50 statistics. To provide a better assessment of assembly output for viral and microbial datasets, a new metric called U50 should be used. The U50 identifies unique, target-specific contigs by using a reference genome as baseline, aiming at circumventing some limitations that are inherent to the N50 metric. The use of the U50 metric allows for a more accurate measure of assembly performance by analyzing only the unique, non-overlapping contigs. Most viral and microbial sequencing have high background noise (i.e., host and other non- targets), which contributes to having a skewed, misrepresented N50 value - this is corrected by U50. Definition=N50 N50 statistic defines assembly quality in terms of contiguity. Given a set of contigs, the N50 is defined as the sequence length of the shortest contig at 50% of the total genome length. It can be thought of as the point of half of the mass of the distribution; the number of bases from all contigs longer than the N50 will be close to the number of bases from all contigs shorter than the N50. For example, consider 9 contigs with the lengths 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,and 10; their sum is 54, half of the sum is 27, and the size of the genome also happens to be 54. 50% of this assembly would be 10 + 9 + 8 = 27 (half the length of the sequence). Thus the N50=8, which is the size of the contig which, along with the larger contigs, contain half of sequence of a particular genome. Note: When comparing N50 values from different assemblies, the assembly sizes must be the same size in order for N50 to be meaningful. N50 can be described as a weighted median statistic such that 50% of the entire assembly is contained in contigs or scaffolds equal to or larger than this value. L50 Given a set of contigs, each with its own length, the L50 count is defined as the smallest number of contigs whose length sum makes up half of genome size. From the example above the L50=3. N90 The N90 statistic is less than or equal to the N50 statistic; it is the length for which the collection of all contigs of that length or longer contains at least 90% of the sum of the lengths of all contigs. NG50 Note that N50 is calculated in the context of the assembly size rather than the genome size. Therefore, comparisons of N50 values derived from assemblies of significantly different lengths are usually not informative, even if for the same genome. To address this, the authors of the Assemblathon competition came up with a new measure called NG50. The NG50 statistic is the same as N50 except that it is 50% of the known or estimated genome size that must be of the NG50 length or longer. This allows for meaningful comparisons between different assemblies. In the typical case that the assembly size is not more than the genome size, the NG50 statistic will not be more than the N50 statistic. D50 The D50 statistic (also termed D50 test) is similar to the N50 statistic in definition though it is generally not used to describe genome assemblies. The D50 statistic is the lowest value d for which the sum of the lengths of the largest d lengths is at least 50% of the sum of all of the lengths. U50 U50 is the length of the smallest contig such that 50% of the sum of all unique, target-specific contigs is contained in contigs of size U50 or larger. UL50 UL50 is the number of contigs whose length sum produces U50. UG50 UG50 is the length of the smallest contig such that 50% of the reference genome is contained in unique, target-specific contigs of size UG50 or larger. UG50% UG50% is the estimated percent coverage length of the UG50 in direct relation to the length of the reference genome. The calculation is (100 √ó (UG50/Length of reference genome). The UG50%, as a percentage-based metric, can be used to compare assembly results from different samples or studies. Examples Consider two fictional, highly simplified genome assemblies, A and B, that are derived from two different species. Assembly A contains six contigs of lengths 80 kbp, 70 kbp, 50 kbp, 40 kbp, 30 kbp, and 20 kbp. The sum size of assembly A is 290 kbp, the N50 contig length is 70 kbp because 80 + 70 is greater than 50% of 290, and the L50 contig count is 2 contigs. The contig lengths of assembly B are the same as those of assembly A except for the presence of two additional contigs with lengths of 10 kbp and 5 kbp. The size of assembly B is 305 kbp, the N50 contig length drops to 50 kbp because 80 + 70 + 50 is greater than 50% of 305, and the L50 contig count is 3 contigs. This example illustrates that one can sometimes increase the N50 length simply by removing some of the shortest contigs or scaffolds from an assembly. If the estimated or known size of the genome from the fictional species A is 500 kbp then the NG50 contig length is 30 kbp because 80 + 70 + 50 + 40 + 30 is greater than 50% of 500. In contrast, if the estimated or known size of the genome from species B is 350 kbp then it has an NG50 contig length of 50 kbp because 80 + 70 + 50 is greater than 50% of 350. Alternate computation N50 can be found mathematically for a list L of positive integers as follows: # Create another list L' , which is identical to L, except that every element n in L has been replaced with n copies of itself. # The median of L' is the N50 of L. (The 10% quantile of L' is the N90 statistic.) For example: If L = (2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 8, 8), then L' consists of six 2's, six 3's, four 4's, and sixteen 8's. That is, L' has twice as many 2s as L; it has three times as many 3s as L; it has four times as many 4s; etc. The median of the 32-element set L' is the average of the 16th smallest element, 4, and 17th smallest element, 8, so the N50 is 6. We can see that the sum of all values in the list L that are smaller than or equal to the N50 of 6 is 16 = 2+2+2+3+3+4 and the sum of all values in the list L that are larger than or equal to 6 is also 16 = 8+8. For comparison with the N50 of 6, note that the mean of the list L is 4 while the median is 3.

The incident involved the Chung Ling High School dragon boat club, where eighteen paddlers took part in dragon boat training at Penang Strait. Strong water currents caused the helmsman to lose control of the dragon boat and collide with a tugboat. The dragon boat then capsized and killed six of the eighteen paddlers, including a teacher and several students. A memorial service was held on the following day in the school. The school flag was flown at half-mast, and funerals were held on the second day following the incident. The school and government subsequently donated the money to the victims' families and survivors. It was later revealed by the Penang Education Department that the school disregarded the safety guidelines for co-curricular activities by not seeking approval and clearance before conducting the training. The training was unscheduled as it occurred upon students' requests to a new teacher already interested in joining the training session. Only three of the eighteen paddlers wore life jackets, and despite the precautions, two of them died at the scene. All paddlers who wore life jackets were unable to swim. Some officials said that the incident location was unsuitable for the water sports due to busy traffic, uncertain weather conditions, strong currents, and debris left by fisherman from boat repair. Penang Forward Sports Club countered that the area was safe for a training session as a trained coach had checked the sea and weather conditions. History On 17 January 2010, the Chung Ling High School dragon boat practice took place in Penang Strait, located off Macallum Street Ghaut, as part of their weekly training in preparation for their upcoming July competition. Eighteen paddlers took part in this activity. Safety measures were not followed, as only three of the eighteen paddlers wore the compulsory life jackets. While training, some rowers, mostly new members, were tired and paused in the middle of the sea. At approximately 9:00 am, the dragon boat capsized after colliding with a tugboat when strong currents caused the helmsman to lose control of the boat. Twelve paddlers were admitted to Penang General Hospital after being rescued by fisherman in two nearby boats or having swum to safety. A 100 person rescue team in sixteen boats consisting of policemen, firemen, marine law enforcement bureau and civil defense officers arrived at the accident area. Two bodies were retrieved: Chin Aik Siang, a teacher, at 11:00 am and Jason Ch'Ng, a student, at 2:50 pm. The remaining bodies, all students, were recovered the following day. Goh Yi Zhang was first discovered at 8:00 am, followed by Brendon Yeoh at 12:10 pm, and Wang Yong Xiang and Cheah Zi Jun, found at 4:25 pm. The search operation, totaling RM 84 million, ended at 5:00 pm. On 18 January 2010, in memory of the deceased, the flag of Chung Ling High School was flown at half-mast and a memorial ceremony was held inside the school. The school Board of Governors, Parent-Teacher Association and Alumni Association donated RM 10,000 to the families of the victims. An additional RM 2,000 was donated to the injured paddlers. The principal of the school declared the incident to be \\"the darkest co-curricular activity incident ever occurs in the school‚Äôs history\\". The funerals for the deceased took place the following day at multiple victims' homes in Penang. Multiple high profile figures, including Muhyiddin Yassin, Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, Lim Guan Eng, Chief Minister of Penang and Datuk Wira Ayub Yakoob, deputy communication for Penang police chief, visited the tragedy site. The Home Ministry then donated RM 3,000 to six of the deceased victims' families in addition to RM 1,000 from Education Ministry. An additional RM 200 from Education Ministry was donated to each survivor of this incident. The school offered psychological counseling to help victims and family members affected by psychological trauma as a result of the tragedy. Controversies According to Shamsir Mohamed, officer of Marine Department (northern region), the Penang Strait was unsuitable for any water sports activity due to busy traffic, unpredictable weather, and strong currents. There are several controversies that occurred before, during and after the incident. The school was found to have disregarded the safety guidelines for co-curricular activities set by Penang Education Department, which required school management to inform security authorities of the activities to ensure that students' safety could be ensured prior to extracurricular outdoor activities. The revelation also found out that the group did not seek approval or get clearance to conduct training session in this area. On 4 November 2010, Penang Forward Sports Club revealed to a parent of a deceased victim that the dragon boat training was unscheduled and conducted due to student requests to a new teacher already interested in joining the training session. Lok Yim Pheng, the secretary-general of the National Union of the Teaching Profession (NUTP), criticized the organizers, coordinators and teachers for developing a reputation of a lack of safety sense, citing another tragedy involving three woman who drowned on a 1Malaysia school camping trip due to collapse of suspension bridge in Perak. Most of the paddlers did not wear life jackets during most of the regular training as they knew how to swim, but three of the paddlers did wear them. Geh Thuan Tek, the secretary of Life Saving Society Malaysia Penang, who was also involved in the search and rescue mission, stated that life jackets would not guarantee that the wearer survive a drowning, especially if worn improperly. One of the victims is believed to have died after their unfastened life vest trapped them underneath the boat. Only one of the victims who wore a life vest survived. Not all of the students who attended the training were able to swim, as attested to by multiple family members. Some officials, especially Shamsir Mohamed, officer of Marine Department (northern region) and Lai Chew Hock, chairman of Penang Dragon Boat Association, voiced concerns about the suitability of the area for water sports. Shamsir cited busy traffic, unpredictable weather, and strong currents for his concerns. Chew Hock claimed the area was unsuitable for any water sports activities due to debris from fishing boats and strong currents. Despite these concerns, the same area was used previously for Penang Pesta Open Dragon Boat Race in December 2009, which garnered criticism from residents of Penang. Concerns were raised when two boats collided during the race. As a result, organizers changed the location for the 2010 edition event to Teluk Bahang Dam. The decision was made following the Chung Ling dragon boat tragedy. The parent of a deceased victim questioned the rationale of conducting the training session during the north-east monsoon season and added that any water sports activity should only be conducted after monsoon season. Lim Choo Hooi, chairman of Penang Forward Sports Club, responded by saying that neither the wave tides nor the monsoon season posed a problem for training sessions. Coaches would need to check sea and weather conditions prior to conducting training sessions. He also said that the tragedy site was protected from tsunamis and strong waves and had been used for training for three years, making it one of the safest stretches of public shoreline.

The videotapes were marketed directly to small, independent toy stores, but did not sell well. However, these three short films would become famous in the 2010s, when \\"You on Kazoo!\\" was uploaded to YouTube, and became a viral meme, thanks to the kazoo scenes, as \\"The Kazoo Kid\\" would later become the official nickname for its star, Brett Ambler. The video was remixed by Mike Diva in February 2016, and sampled by Florian Rehn Olsson in his SoundCloud song \\"dootdoot\\". The first product that brought them attention was the Fuzzy Farm Puzzle, a wooden puzzle with texture. An extensive line of wooden puzzles followed.

It was built by the Munich-Augsburg Railway Company and opened in 1840. It was nationalised in 1846 and extended to Ulm in 1854. The line between Augsburg and Munich is a major traffic axis and part of the Magistrale for Europe from Budapest through Vienna to Paris.  History  The line was built by the Munich-Augsburg Railway Company (German: M√ºnchen-Augsburg Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) and opened in 1839 and 1840. The Munich-Augsburg Railway Company was nationalised on 1 June 1846 and taken over by the Royal Bavarian State Railways (K√∂niglich Bayerische Staats-Eisenbahnen). The line became part of Bavarian Maximilian‚Äôs Railway (Bayerische Maximiliansbahn) and was extended to Ulm on 1 May 1854. After the nationalisation of the line in 1846 a new Augsburg station was built at Rosenauberg along with new rail facilities in nearby Oberhausen. The old stations at the Roten Tor (Red Gate) and in Oberhausen were abandoned. Between 26 June 1965 and 3 October 1965, two pairs of trains per day using Class E 03 locomotives ran at 200 km/h on the line for the 1965 International Transport Exhibition in Munich, taking 26 minutes to complete the run. From May 1968 two trains, \\"Blauer Enzian\\" and \\"Rheinblitz\\", ran on the same route at a scheduled speed of 200 km/h. In 1977 the 42.7 km long section between Lochhausen and Augsburg-Hochzoll, was put into operation with a regular permitted speed of 200 km/h. For the first time in Germany numerous trains could reach this speed in regular commercial operations. Upgrade Freight train passes to new work at Mammendorf, February 2010. New work near Hattenhofen New line being built on sand embankment at Haspelmoor The 43 km section between Augsburg and Olching line was rebuilt to four-tracks between 1998 and 2011 to carry significantly more traffic. One pair of tracks was dedicated to regional services (RB, RE) and goods traffic and the other to (IC/EC) and high-speed traffic (ICE) services. Heavy and more slowly running freight trains no longer obstruct the passage of faster ICEs. The permitted speed on the high-speed tracks is now 230 km/h. Infrastructure for regional trains allows operations at 160 km/h. On the line between Olching and Munich, freight, regional trains, and the Munich S-Bahn have their own tracks. The railway upgrading work was divided into six sections for planning purposes. Work began on the western section between Augsburg and Kissing in February 1998 and the new tracks were brought into service in 2003. A new bridge was built over the Lech in Augsburg in 2002 and in the same year work began on the eastern section between Mering and Olching. Dedication on 10 December 2011 On 6 June 2011, the conversion of the line to four-track operation was completed, but the two high-speed tracks were not yet passable at 230 km/h. On 10 December 2011 the railway was dedicated with a new speed limit of 230 km/h after 13 years of building. =Dates and facts= *Length of the Augsburg‚ÄìMunich line: *Length of the line being upgraded: *Line speed: for ICE traffic; for regional and goods traffic *Completion date: 2011 The upgrading involved: acquisition of 95.3 hectares of land, 43 km of additional railway embankment, 7.5 km of new retaining walls, 116 km of new track and 104 points moved, 52 railway and 19 road bridges reconstructed or adapted, 46 km of noise barriers, nine island platforms and three passing lines adapted or rebuilt In the federal transport investment plan for 2010, federal funding for the project was estimated to be ‚Ç¨556 million for the first stage of development (2006 prices). ‚Ç¨303.5 million had been spent up to 2005. ‚Ç¨215 million of federal funds were to be invested between 2006 and 2010. Beyond this period a shortfall of ‚Ç¨37.6 million had to be made up.  Operations The line between Augsburg and Munich is a major traffic axis and part of the Magistrale (trunk line) for Europe from Budapest through Vienna to Paris. It is used daily by about 300 trains and is one of Germany‚Äôs busiest line with a mixture of goods trains, regional passenger trains and long- distance high-speed trains. Each hour an Intercity-Express train and an InterCity train run from Munich via Ulm to Stuttgart. Additional ICE trains run from Munich to Augsburg, branching to Nuremberg or W√ºrzburg and on to further destinations. A similar service pattern also operates in the reverse direction.

It consisted of foreign soldiers who wished to continue in French service under the restored monarchy. The regiment was raised, named after and commanded by Louis Aloysius, Prince of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Bartenstein, a German prince and Marshal of France. __TOC__ History The Hohenlohe Regiment was established on September 6, 1815. Upon its formation, it was known as L√©gion royale √©trang√®re and was composed of the consolidated elements of eight foreign regiments that had been raised during the Hundred Days, but which had been disbanded following the abdication of Napoleon I.British Troops in Service of France, and the Regimental System.(1855). In Ainsworth, William H. (Ed.), The New Monthly Magazine (p. 378). While foreigners in French service had historically been grouped into specific national units (Swiss, German, Irish etc.) the newly created regiment was a mixed force. The bulk of its rank and file were however from the various German states of the period. In February 1821, it was renamed the R√©giment de Hohenlohe after its founder and then commanding officer Colonel-Prince Louis Aloysius de Hohenlohe.Porch, Douglas (1991).The French Foreign Legion: The Complete History of the Legendary Fighting Force, pp. 3‚Äì5. HarperCollins, New York. The Hohenlohe Regiment participated in the French intervention in Spain of 1823 as part of Colonel- Prince Hohenlohe's 4th Corps of the Arm√©e des Pyr√©n√©es. In 1829, the namesake of the regiment, Colonel Hohenlohe, died. Other than during the French intervention in Spain, the Hohenlohe Regiment's service was largely uneventful as they were primarily used as a garrison force in various provincial towns around France. This was in marked contrast to the service of the other notable foreign regiments of the era: detachments of Swiss Guards had traditionally been stationed at Versailles as part of the Maison du Roi ‚Äî with the bulk of the Regiment of Swiss Guards garrisoned just outside Paris for the purpose of maintaining royal authority in the city. Swiss regiments continued to perform this role under the restored Bourbon kings. With the Swiss troops occupying such a high-profile role enforcing the authority of the Bourbon kings, the Hohenlohe Regiment largely escaped the notice of the Provisional Government during the July Revolution. While their counterparts in the Swiss regiments were disbanded by order of the government on August 14, 1830, the Hohenlohe Regiment, stationed in the port city of Marseille far from the Paris events of July 1830, escaped this immediate fate. This relative isolation did not last for long, as the newly established July Monarchy intended to honor the constitutional prohibition forbidding the use of foreign mercenaries on French soil. As result, on December 12, 1830, the regiment received orders to prepare to be deployed to Greece in the vicinity of Patras to support the Morea Expedition, a French interventionist effort supporting the Greek independence movement. On January 5, 1831, however, the Hohenlohe Regiment received orders to disband from King Louis Phillippe.Jordan, David (2005). The History of the French Foreign Legion: From 1831 to Present, p. 8. Lyons Press, London. . Those members of the regiment who wished to continue to serve in the French army were transferred into the 21st Line Infantry Regiment. Legacy As an infantry regiment composed of foreigners, the Hohenlohe Regiment constituted one of the forebears of the French Foreign Legion. An immediate legacy was passed onto the Foreign Legion in the form of some of the Hohenlohe Regiment's commissioned and non-commissioned officer cadre, who were credited with forming the newly raised Legion into a functional fighting force. In its original form, the Legion's 1st and 2nd Battalions were composed of veterans of the former Swiss regiments and the Hohenlohe Regiment.Lepage, Jean-Denis G. G. (2008). The French Foreign Legion: An Illustrated History. p. 13. MacFarland & Sons, Jefferson. . The distinctive slow-stepping parade march of the modern Foreign Legion is reportedly traceable to that of the Hohenlohe and Swiss regiments prior to 1830.

He served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of New York from 1957 to 1972. Biography John Fearns was born in New York City, and received his early education at Cathedral College in his native city. He attended St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, and continued his studies in Rome at the Pontifical North American College. He earned a Doctor of Sacred Theology degree after completing his studies at the University of the Propaganda and the Pontifical Gregorian University. He was ordained to the priesthood in Rome on February 19, 1922. After his ordination, Fearns returned to the United States and did worked as a curate in New Rochelle, Rye, and St. Clare's School in Mount Hope. He served as a professor of moral theology and canon law at St. Joseph's Seminary from 1930 to 1940. In 1940, he was named to succeed Msgr. Arthur J. Scanlan as rector of St. Joseph's Seminary. He continued to serve as rector until 1956, when he became pastor of St. Francis de Sales Church. On November 4, 1957, Fearns was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of New York and titular bishop of Geras by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following December 10 from Cardinal Francis Spellman, with Archbishop Patrick O'Boyle and Bishop Edward Joseph Maginn serving as co-consecrators, at St. Patrick's Cathedral. At his consecration, he wore the same vestments worn by Cardinal Spellman and Pope Pius XII at their own consecrations. In addition to his role at St. Francis, his duties included administrative affairs, presiding at confirmation and ordination ceremonies, and visitation. Between 1962 and 1965, Fearns attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council. He once declared it would be immoral for any country, including the United States, to conduct nuclear tests in the atmosphere merely as a show of force, saying, \\"The justification of a given test depends on the importance of the new knowledge or practice that the test is expected to supply, balanced against the damage that the test will probably cause.\\" In 1966, he was named to the newly created office of Episcopal Vicar for Orange and Rockland Counties. In an administrative innovation that resulted from the Second Vatican Council, he was one of six bishops appointed to devote more attention to the needs of local churches throughout the Archdiocese.

CajunBot was featured on CNN and on the Discovery Channel science series Robocars. CajunBot's custom AGV software, CBSystem, has artificial intelligence path planning capabilities, as well as visualization and simulation components. The hardware repertoire of CajunBot includes a high grade GPS/INS positioning unit to navigate a designated route while detecting and avoiding obstacles using LIDAR laser-ranging units.  History = Inception and the 2004 Grand Challenge  CajunBot leaves the start chute at the 2004 DARPA Grand Challenge Final Event CajunBot team members at 2004 DARPA Grand Challenge In 2002, DARPA announced the first Grand Challenge: \\"Build a robotic vehicle able to travel unassisted on a predefined path of about 130 miles through the Mojave Desert. The fastest robot to navigate the course in less than 10 hours will take home $1 million.\\" The first competition was scheduled in March 2004. After learning of the Challenge in 2003, a small group of UL Lafayette students and professors joined together to see if they could take on the task of designing a completely autonomous vehicle. \\"GPS Bot\\" was engineered as a proof-of-concept, using a small remote controlled car coupled with a micro controller and GPS sensor. \\"GPS Bot\\" was able to navigate pre-programmed GPS waypoints without any human interaction. Branding themselves as \\"Team CajunBot\\", (UL Lafayette's athletic teams are referred to as the Ragin' Cajuns) the group was able to have the first CajunBot vehicle ready within a few short months. \\"CajunBot\\" was built on a 6-wheeled all-terrain vehicle commonly used for hunting in the swamps and marshlands. Team CajunBot, energized by the tremendous support from the Lafayette community, defied odds and competed successfully in the qualification rounds, earning a place among the 13 teams selected to compete in the finals, out of 106 initial applicants. No team managed to complete the 2004 Grand Challenge course, but DARPA was encouraged by the results. It brought together engineers and inventors and managed to channel their energies into the development of important technologies designed to save American lives on the battlefield.  2005 Grand Challenge  CajunBot at 2005 Grand Challenge National Qualifying Event In 2005 DARPA repeated the Challenge, fielded more than 198 team entries. Team CajunBot, again, successfully passed the qualification rounds and earned a place among 23 teams selected to compete in the finals. In the 2005 Grand Challenge, history was made as Stanford University's vehicle, Stanley, crossed the finish line after making the 132-mile course in 6 hours and 52 minutes. As envisioned by DARPA, the 2004 and 2005 Grand Challenges successfully accelerated development of the core technology behind fully autonomous battlefield vehicles. But the technology was hardly battle ready.  2007 Urban Challenge  DARPA Urban Challenge 2007 opening ceremony Building on the success of previous challenges, DARPA has launched a new competition, dubbed the \\"Urban Challenge\\". The event took place in November 2007, set in Victorville, California. The Urban Challenge required teams \\"to build a robotic vehicle that can operate in urban traffic, finding its own path while also following traffic rules\\". Each team was provided a GPS map of an urban cityscape, simulating military supply missions in an urban setting. Traveling among manned and robotic vehicle traffic, the team vehicles traveled through required points in the mock city. Teams were required to complete the 60-mile course safely in less than six hours. Team CajunBot was a semi-finalist. being eliminated in the final round of cuts due to an unexpected collision with a roadside vehicle. The team's progress leading up to the challenge was documented in the Discovery Science series Robocars.

It is endemic to Shasta County, California, where it is known from a single population in Whiskeytown National Recreation Area near Whiskeytown and it is feared that the species may now be extinct as a result of the 2018 Carr Fire. Its entire population is contained in a complex of three saline mineral springs directly next to Highway 299. Cooper, D. J. and E. C. Wolf. (2007).

The inflorescence is an array of branches a few centimeters long, the lower ones reflexed as the fruit matures. The grass reproduces only by seed, and seed is not produced until the individual is two years old or more. The plants are mostly dormant during warm months when the soil salinity is highest, and the seed germinates during wet seasons when water flow dilutes the salt. The single population of the grass is made up of several thousand individuals, a dominant species of the vegetation in this tiny network of mineral springs.Grass Manual Treatment It grows alongside other halophytes such as saltgrass (Distichlis spicata) and seaside arrowgrass (Triglochin maritima). Endangered status Threats to this already extremely rare grass include polluted surface runoff from the highway which is just steps away from its habitat,California Native Plant Society Rare Plant Profile alterations in the specific moisture, pH, and salinity requirements of the plant season by season, and changes in the sediment amounts entering the habitat by water flow. In this habitat, freshwater is considered a pollutant, because it reduces the salinity too much for the grass to survive; management plans highlight the importance of diverting freshwater away from the springs. Other threats include grazing by black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus), garbage from the road, and random events that could affect the entire population.

It has a metallic green body and at rest it holds its wings away from its body. Its common name is the willow emerald damselfly or the western willow spreadwing. Taxonomy The genus Chalcolestes is separated from Lestes because of differences in their larvae. A closely related species C. parvidens used to be considered a sub-species of C. viridis. C. parvidens occurs in Greece, Bulgaria, Croatia and in Italy; near Rome it flies with C. viridis in the same ponds. There are small morphological differences between the two species both as adults and larvae and analysis of proteins from the two species, by electrophoresis, also supports their separation into two species, but they are hard to tell apart in the field. C. parvidens flies earlier in the year than C. viridis. Distribution and habitat C. viridis is found across southern and central Europe. In the eastern mediterranean it is replaced by C. parvidens with areas of overlap in Italy and the Balkans. C. viridis is found on many mediterranean islands including Corsica, Sicily, Mallorca, Menorca and Ibiza, in the Maghreb in North Africa, Turkey and the Middle East. However many of the old records for C. viridis in the east of its range could be for C. parvidens. It occurs in still or slow flowing water in ditches, ponds, lakes and canals, with overhanging willows, alders or birches, which are used for breeding. Of all the European Lestes it is the species, along with C. parvidens, that will lay eggs in where there is running water. The adults are often found in the bushes which grow over or alongside water. Status in Britain In Britain it was a rare vagrant and is now a new colonist. It is widespread on Jersey. Identification In the field it is not possible to reliably distinguish C. viridis from C. parvidens. Both species are mainly metallic green, like other Lestes damselflies, but larger and darker but they do not have a powder blue pruinescence which is common in other Lestes. The pterostigma is pale brown and outlined in black. The thorax has thin yellow antehumerals and broader yellow stripe above a thin black line on each side; the upper edge of the stripe is irregular. Both C. viridis and C. parvidens have a prominent spur-like marking on the side of the thorax. Male - The abdomen is very long. The lower anal appendages are less than half the length of the upper which are a distinctive pale yellow with black tips. Female - The ovipositor is longer than in Lestes dryas. {  C. viridis male  C. viridis teneral male.  Female } {  C. viridis showing spur-like mark in thorax.  C. viridis female.  C.viridis female. Closeup. } Behaviour Flight period is late from August to October although in the southernmost parts of its range it can occur as early as May and persist until November. Mature males defend vertical territories in marginal shrubs and small trees where they find and mate with females in the normal damselfly manner forming the wheel position. Egg laying occurs with the pair in tandem, the eggs being laid into incisions in the bark of overhanging branches, not into submerged vegetation as is the case in many damselflies. Egg laying can result in distinct oval galls forming in the shrub's bark. The eggs develop rapidly for a few weeks and then enter a diapause state. In this state the eggs development is very slow and it is in this state that the eggs overwinter. The following spring the eggs hatch, the larvae drop into the water and start to develop. Growth is rapid and adults can emerge in a couple of months. After emerging the adults move away from water to mature. In this stage of their life-cycle the immature adults cannot breed. The adults need a period of time for their reproductive organs to develop and this non-breeding period also stops the adults breeding too early in the season. If the females lay eggs early in the year the eggs will develop when it is to warm to for them to enter diapause. They might hatch out before winter and the resultant larva will die when winter temperatures occur. When fully mature the adults return to water and start breeding. {  C. viridis in copula  C. viridis egg laying whilst in tandem. The female, bottom is inserting eggs into the twig.

Hawthorn went on to win their first ever premiership that season. The following year he left football to pursue his love of athletics. As a decathlete, Athorne finished second to John O'Neill in the 1965 Australian Open Track & Field Championships. He went one better in 1966 at Perry Lakes Stadium in Perth and won the decathlon, by just 30 points over South Australian John Hamann.

Germaine Krull: Photographer of Modernity. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1999. . Her nationality has been categorized as German, French, and Dutch, but she spent years in Brazil, Republic of the Congo, Thailand, and India. Described as \\"an especially outspoken example\\" of a group of early 20th-century female photographers who \\"could lead lives free from convention\\", she is best known for photographically-illustrated books such as her 1928 portfolio M√©tal.Rosenblum, Naomi. A History of Women Photographers, 2nd edition. New York: Abbeville Press, 2000. . Biography Krull was born in Posen-Wilda, a district of Posen (then in Germany; now Pozna≈Ñ, Poland), of an affluent German family. In her early years, the family moved around Europe frequently; she did not receive a formal education, but instead received homeschooling from her father, an accomplished engineer and a free thinker (whom some characterized as a \\"ne'er-do-well\\"). Her father let her dress as a boy when she was young, which may have contributed to her ideas about women's roles later in her life.Baker, Kenneth. \\"Germaine Krull's Radical Vision / Photographer's Work Featured at SFMOMA.\\" San Francisco Chronicle, 15 April 2000. Retrieved 4 April 2010. In addition, her father's views on social justice \\"seem to have predisposed her to involvement with radical politics.\\" Between 1915 and 1917 or 1918 she attended the Lehr- und Versuchsanstalt f√ºr Photographie, a photography school in Munich, Germany, at which Frank Eugene's teaching of pictorialism in 1907-1913 had been influential. She opened a studio in Munich in approximately 1918, took portraits of Kurt Eisner and others, and befriended prominent people such as Rainer Maria Rilke, Friedrich Pollock, and Max Horkheimer. Krull was politically active between 1918 and 1921. In 1919 she switched from the Independent Socialist Party of Bavaria to the Communist Party of Germany, and was arrested and imprisoned for assisting a Bolshevik emissary's attempted escape to Austria. She was expelled from Bavaria in 1920 for her Communist activities, and traveled to Russia with lover Samuel Levit. After Levit abandoned her in 1921, Krull was imprisoned as an \\"anti-Bolshevik\\" and expelled from Russia. She lived in Berlin between 1922 and 1925 where she resumed her photographic career. She and Kurt H√ºbschmann (later to be known as Kurt Hutton) worked together in a Berlin studio between 1922 and 1924. Among other photographs Krull produced in Berlin were a series of nudes (recently disparaged by an unimpressed 21st-century critic as \\"almost like satires of lesbian pornography\\"). Having met Dutch filmmaker and communist Joris Ivens in 1923, she moved to Amsterdam in 1925. After Krull returned to Paris in 1926, Ivens and Krull entered into a marriage of convenience between 1927 and 1943 so that Krull could hold a Dutch passport and could have a \\"veneer of married respectability without sacrificing her autonomy.\\"Schoots, Hans. Living Dangerously: a Biography of Joris Ivens. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2000. . In Paris between 1926 and 1928, Krull became friends with Sonia Delaunay, Robert Delaunay, Eli Lotar, Andr√© Malraux, Colette, Jean Cocteau, Andr√© Gide and others; her commercial work consisted of fashion photography, nudes, and portraits. During this period she published the portfolio M√©tal (1928) which concerned \\"the essentially masculine subject of the industrial landscape.\\" Krull shot the portfolio's 64 black-and-white photographs in Paris, Marseille, and Holland during approximately the same period as Ivens was creating his film De Brug (\\"The Bridge\\") in Rotterdam, and the two artists may have influenced each other. The portfolio's subjects range from bridges, buildings (e.g., the Eiffel Tower), and ships to bicycle wheels; it can be read as either a celebration of machines or a criticism of them. Many of the photographs were taken from dramatic angles, and overall the work has been compared to that of L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy and Alexander Rodchenko. In 1999-2004 the portfolio was selected as one of the most important photobooks in history.Fotograf√≠a P√∫blica: Photography in Print 1919-1939\\\\.

By 1928 Krull was considered one of the best photographers in Paris, along with Andr√© Kert√©sz and Man Ray. Between 1928 and 1933, her photographic work consisted primarily of photojournalism, such as her photographs for Vu, a French magazine.; also in the early 1930s,she also made a pioneering study of employment black spots in Britain for Weekly Illustrated (most of her ground- breaking reportage work from this period remains immured in press archives and she has never received the credit which is her due for this work).Ian Jeffrey,text written by.The Photo Book. London: Phaidon, 2000. p.255. Her book √âtudes de Nu (\\"Studies of Nudes\\") published in 1930 is still well-known today. Between 1930 and 1935 she contributed photographs for a number of travel and detective fiction books. In 1935-1940, Krull lived in Monte Carlo where she had a photographic studio.\\"Portrait of Hedonism with Glasses Half Empty.\\" The Gazette (Montreal), 30 December 2006. Among her subjects during this period were buildings (such as casinos and palaces), automobiles, celebrities, and common people. She may have been a member of the Black Star photojournalism agency which had been founded in 1935, but \\"no trace of her work appears in the press with that label.\\" In World War II, she became disenchanted with the Vichy France government, and sought to join the Free French Forces in Africa. Due to her Dutch passport and her need to obtain proper visas, her journey to Africa included over a year (1941‚Äì1942) in Brazil where she photographed the city of Ouro Preto. Between 1942 and 1944 she was in Brazzaville in French Equatorial Africa, after which she spent several months in Algiers and then returned to France. After World War II, she traveled to Southeast Asia as a war correspondent, but by 1946 had become a co-owner of the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, Thailand, a role that she undertook until 1966. She published three books with photographs during this period, and also collaborated with Malraux on a project concerning the sculpture and architecture of Southeast Asia. After retiring from the hotel business in 1966, she briefly lived near Paris, then moved to Northern India and converted to the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism. Her final major photographic project was the publication of a 1968 book Tibetans in India that included a portrait of the Dalai Lama. After a stroke, she moved to a nursing home in Wetzlar, Germany, where she died in 1985.

The place is locally known as Sariya (or Suriya), in Sariya CD Block in Bagodar-Saria subdivision in Giridih district in the Indian state of Jharkhand. Geography Hazaribagh Road or Saria is located at . Bagodar on National Highway 19 (old numbering NH 2) / Grand Trunk Road is and Hazaribagh is from Hazaribagh Road. History With the extension of railways to Barakar in 1856, that town became the railhead for the vast hinterland that lay beyond it. In 1871, Giridih was connected to Madhupur on the Howrah-Delhi main line, through a branch line. Giridih served as the railhead for Hazaribagh and other places in the area till the Grand Chord line was laid. Hazaribagh Road station, along with the Grand Chord, was opened in February 1907 (1906 according to some railway related sources).

Lubaloy possesses many favorable characteristics making it, and other types of brass, a popular choice in manufacturing. It is a source material in many processes including the creation of electrical components and bullet- making. Documented use of brass dates back to early Romans, and is referenced in the King James Bible. There are both positive and negative health effects that are associated with the use of this material. Lubaloy is made from combining 91% copper, 8.5% zinc, and 0.5% tin. Proportional variances are utilized for application specific demands of each desired material component. The range of compositions can vary from around 81 to 95% copper, 3 to 18% zinc, and 0.5 to 2% tin. A common variation of the Lubaloy alloy type in Lubaloy X 425, with a composition of 88% copper, 10% zinc, and 2% tin. Uses This alloy is widely used because it is soft and more malleable than copper or zinc alone. It offers great cold workability and hot formability. The non-ferromagnetic property of brass allows it to be easily separated from other metals. It is tarnish-resistant, and has low friction and spark-less qualities. It is dull yellow and has an appearance similar to that of gold. Brass is a substitutional alloy used for decorations and jewellery. Brass is an excellent electrical and thermal conductor because copper has a simple FCC crystal structure. Silver is the best electrical conductor. Copper can conduct 97% of the amount of electricity that silver can conduct. Common uses include manufacture of rod, wire, sheet, and foil. Lubaloy is a component in such objects as trumpets and cymbals, doorknobs and locks, ammunition, valves, gears, and bearings. It is a common alloy used to make coins. This alloy plays an important role in manufacturing tools for use around explosive gases, and in cryogenics. It is used as a test control metal for protective coatings research. Other items include plates, tubes, pipes, forgings, castings, bushings, washers, terminals, connectors, flexible metal hose, and conductors. In 1922, the Western Cartridge Company introduced a copper-washed bullet jacketing called Lubaloy which stands for lubricating alloy. Lubaloy replaced standard bullet jacketing which had been cupro-nickel coated steel or solid cupro-nickel. The original jacketing was found to be detrimental to firearm performance over time. Lumps of the hot jacketing were deposited near the end of the barrel during firing, eventually creating a hazard or destroying the barrel. The Lubaloy-Palma ammunition jacketing was a breakthrough solution to this persistent dilemma. It was composed of 90% copper, 8% zinc, and 2% tin. Lubaloy can be fabricated using blanking, forming, and drawing processes. The early versions of brass were created by co-smelting mixed ores. The process was called cementation, which involved heating zinc and copper in a closed crucible with charcoal. This dates back to the 7th century BC in Greece. Sometimes the zinc ore was pre-heated to produce metallic zinc which condensed from the hot vapour. This was called speltering. It produced a superior product where the purity can be controlled and modified. This process was noted from around 1000 AD in India. Today full-scale production is more stream-lined; modern smelters and electrolytic refineries are used. Health issues Health concerns surrounding brass stem from lead contamination. Lead is sometimes added to enhance the machinability of brass. It is often present in concentrations around 2%. Thirteen key manufacturers were sued by the California state attorney general on October 1999. Lab tests revealed the average brass key contained more than the acceptable limit of lead. They were required to reduce the lead content to 1.5% after April 2001. By January 1, 2010, the California law states that brass containing less than 0.25% lead must be used for each component that comes into contact with the wetted surface of pipes, plumbing fittings and fixtures. On the other hand, the copper in brass does create a natural germicidal or oligodynamic effect. Brass doorknobs will virtually disinfect themselves within eight hours.

Evolutionary multimodal optimization is a branch of evolutionary computation, which is closely related to machine learning. Wong provides a short survey,Wong, K. C. (2015), Evolutionary Multimodal Optimization: A Short Survey arXiv preprint arXiv:1508.00457 wherein the chapter of ShirShir, O.M. (2012), Niching in Evolutionary Algorithms and the book of PreussPreuss, Mike (2015), Multimodal Optimization by Means of Evolutionary Algorithms cover the topic in more detail.  Motivation  Knowledge of multiple solutions to an optimization task is especially helpful in engineering, when due to physical (and/or cost) constraints, the best results may not always be realizable. In such a scenario, if multiple solutions (locally and/or globally optimal) are known, the implementation can be quickly switched to another solution and still obtain the best possible system performance. Multiple solutions could also be analyzed to discover hidden properties (or relationships) of the underlying optimization problem, which makes them important for obtaining domain knowledge. In addition, the algorithms for multimodal optimization usually not only locate multiple optima in a single run, but also preserve their population diversity, resulting in their global optimization ability on multimodal functions. Moreover, the techniques for multimodal optimization are usually borrowed as diversity maintenance techniques to other problems.Wong, K. C. et al. (2012), Evolutionary multimodal optimization using the principle of locality Information Sciences  Background  Classical techniques of optimization would need multiple restart points and multiple runs in the hope that a different solution may be discovered every run, with no guarantee however. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) due to their population based approach, provide a natural advantage over classical optimization techniques. They maintain a population of possible solutions, which are processed every generation, and if the multiple solutions can be preserved over all these generations, then at termination of the algorithm we will have multiple good solutions, rather than only the best solution. Note that this is against the natural tendency of classical optimization techniques, which will always converge to the best solution, or a sub-optimal solution (in a rugged, ‚Äúbadly behaving‚Äù function). Finding and maintenance of multiple solutions is wherein lies the challenge of using EAs for multi-modal optimization. NichingMahfoud, S. W. (1995), \\"Niching methods for genetic algorithms\\" is a generic term referred to as the technique of finding and preserving multiple stable niches, or favorable parts of the solution space possibly around multiple solutions, so as to prevent convergence to a single solution. The field of Evolutionary algorithms encompasses genetic algorithms (GAs), evolution strategy (ES), differential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and other methods. Attempts have been made to solve multi-modal optimization in all these realms and most, if not all the various methods implement niching in some form or the other.  Multimodal optimization using genetic algorithms/evolution strategies  De Jong's crowding method, Goldberg's sharing function approach, Petrowski's clearing method, restricted mating, maintaining multiple subpopulations are some of the popular approaches that have been proposed by the community. The first two methods are especially well studied, however, they do not perform explicit separation into solutions belonging to different basins of attraction. The application of multimodal optimization within ES was not explicit for many years, and has been explored only recently. A niching framework utilizing derandomized ES was introduced by Shir,Shir, O.M. (2008), \\"Niching in Derandomized Evolution Strategies and its Applications in Quantum Control\\" proposing the CMA-ES as a niching optimizer for the first time. The underpinning of that framework was the selection of a peak individual per subpopulation in each generation, followed by its sampling to produce the consecutive dispersion of search-points. The biological analogy of this machinery is an alpha-male winning all the imposed competitions and dominating thereafter its ecological niche, which then obtains all the sexual resources therein to generate its offspring. Recently, an evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) approach was proposed,Deb, K., Saha, A. (2010) \\"Finding Multiple Solutions for Multimodal Optimization Problems Using a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Approach\\" (GECCO 2010, In press) in which a suitable second objective is added to the originally single objective multimodal optimization problem, so that the multiple solutions form a weak pareto-optimal front. Hence, the multimodal optimization problem can be solved for its multiple solutions using an EMO algorithm. Improving upon their work,Saha, A., Deb, K. (2010) \\"A Bi-criterion Approach to Multimodal Optimization: Self-adaptive Approach \\" (Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2010, Volume 6457/2010, 95‚Äì104) the same authors have made their algorithm self-adaptive, thus eliminating the need for pre-specifying the parameters. An approach that does not use any radius for separating the population into subpopulations (or species) but employs the space topology instead is proposed in.C. Stoean, M. Preuss, R. Stoean, D.

With his business and life partner, the Danish sommelier and chef Henrik Yde-Andersen, he has founded and operates a host of restaurants, mainly in Copenhagen, ranging from the Michelin-starred restaurant Kiin Kiin to gourmet take-aways. Biography Treetawatchaiwong was born in Bangkok's Chinatown, an area centred on Yaowarat Road, into a family of Chinese origins. He studied to become an engineer and first arrived in Denmark as a trainee in 2000, originally with no intentions to stay. Shortly prior to his return to Thailand he applied for some jobs and when he was offered a job at Ericsson. In 2002 he moved on to work for Microsoft as a software engineer. Treetawatchaiwong first met Yde-Andersen, who had just returned from a stay in Bangkok, through mutual friends in 2005. They developed plans to introduce Thai Haute cuisine to the Copenhagen's gourmet restaurant scene, otherwise dominated by a Nordic wave spearheaded by Noma which opened in 2004. As part of their preparations, they visited all Michelin restaurants in Copenhagen as well as Asian top places in London. They first opened the take-away Aroii in N√∏rrebro but shortly after followed their main project, Kiin Kiin, which opened to excellent reviews in 2006 and received a rising star in the 2007 Michelin Guide. The following year Kiin Kiin was awarded a Michelin Star which it has kept since then. In 2008 the duo opened The Ricemarket, an Asian bistrot, on Kultorvet in the city centre. 2009 saw them open a restaurant dedicated to the Cantonese Dim sum tradition which also lend it its name.

Being born on screen during the shows 10th anniversary, Harry has been portrayed by several child actors and by Reid Walker since 2009. In May 2017 Harry left for an exchange program in Japan. Creation and casting In 2001 the shows producers decided to undergo a story that saw Toni Thompson (Laura Hill) give birth prematurely during the soap operas 10th anniversary. After the initial birth scenes,Callum Campbell-Ross was cast in the role due his small size resembling that of a premature baby and due to his family living close to the studio where the soap was filmed. It was decided the role of Harry would be recast in 2006 after Directors struggled to convince 3 year old Campbell-Ross to film \\"naughty boy\\" scenes where he broke a sandcastle. Henry Williams had auditioned for the character of a child patient, but was contacted to see whether he would be interested in playing Harry. In 2009 producers made the decision to recast the role so as to make way for new story directions and characterisation. The pitch was brought up during a meeting with directors and was originally met with hesitation. Reid Walker had previously auditioned for several different roles over several years and had never been called back. In 2009 he was contacted to audition for the recast of Harry. Prior to this, Walker had considered giving up on his acting dream but within one audition, he won the role. He debuted in September 2009 at the age of 9. During his first few years Walker was a minor member of cast, filming 2 scenes a week, but by 2014 he was a \\"senior\\" member and was filming 15 as well as having his own storylines. After having appeared on the show for over 8 years, Walker departed the show as a regular cast member to attend university. He continued to make guest appearances in 2017 and in 2018. Storylines In 2001 Toni Thompson (Laura Hill) fell pregnant but it was not clear who the father was as she had been sleeping with both Adam Heywood (Leighton Cardno) and Chris Warner (Michael Galvin). She gave birth several months prematurely in May 2002 and it was not until Rachel McKenna (Angela Bloomfield) had the babies DNA tested that Chris was revealed as the father. In 2003 Harry went missing and it was soon revealed he had been kidnapped by a mentally unstable Donna Heka (Stephanie Tauevihi). The following year he was kidnapped again, this time by Toni's former flame, Logan King (Peter Muller). In 2004 Harry and Toni were kidnapped by Toni's deranged brother Dominic (Shane Cortese) in an attempt to kill Chris. Harry caused trouble for Chris and Toni the following year, when his tantrums climaxed in him biting Huia Samuels (Nicola Kawana) hand. Toni fled Ferndale in 2007 and took Harry with her but upon their return, the family scraped death in a dramatic car crash. Harry was devastated months later when Toni died and struggled to come to terms with Chris' succession of girlfriends ‚Äì going so far as to force him to break up with Brooke Freeman (Beth Allen). In 2010 Harry struggled to cope with the revelation he had a brother, Phoenix (Geordie Holibar) but grew to love him. He clashed with Chris' girlfriend Rachel McKenna and pressed charges when she lightly slapped him. During Halloween 2013, Harry stopped breathing and lost his heart beat for 45 minutes after drinking a potion made of several garden weeds, including foxglove. However, after Chris used his chief executive officer position at the hospital to register prolonged CPR, Harry survived without brain damage. In early 2015 Harry met Pixie Hannah (Thomasin McKenzie) and after initial clashes, the two began to date. However Pixie was diagnosed with bone cancer and Harry supported her through the following treatment but was devastated when she succumbed to pneumonia shortly after the two had confessed their love. Harry leaves in early 2017 to attend an exchange program in Japan only to then get transferred to Shanghai, China. He then appears in a Skype call with his Dad. Harry would return in October 2017 after it was revealed he had gotten his homestay sister, Zhilan Li pregnant after falling in love with her. Zhilan proceeded to escape to New Zealand to find Harry, but Harry decided not to ask Chris for help after witnessing him paying off Mindy, Frank's ex-wife. He was secretly given allowances by Finn after Chris decided to cut him off financially. In 2018, he returned from Shanghai to attend Finn's wedding, however, Frank sensed that he has been unhappy, as he is very lonely in China because he is still unable to make friends in Shanghai, and unable to adapt to the hectic Chinese lifestyle. It was also suggested that he has prenatal depression. In June, he called Chris, saying that Zhilan has given birth months premature. Chris flew to Shanghai to help with Zhilan's recovery after she lost a lot of blood after she had given birth. On 29 October, Harry returned home in New Zealand with his son, Xun while sneaking out of Zhilan's house. Next day, Zhilan's father tracked him down and threatened to kill. Character development Following the death of Harry's mother Toni Warner (Laura Hill), Hill hoped that the development of the character would be influenced, \\"It would be nice to think there would be floods of tears for months on end but that's not going to happen, is it? I imagine Chris Warner will find someone to fill the empty bed pretty dam quick going on from past form. I think Harry will be sadder for longer. I hope so.\\" The casting of Reid Walker in the role of Harry saw the character develop from a \\"wayward child\\" to a \\"rebellious pre-teen\\". In 2011 Harry was featured in a storyline that saw his fathers girlfriend, Rachel McKenna (Angela Bloomfield) illegally discipline him when she smacked him. Rachel was an inexperienced parent and as such, Bloomfield had to forget her own maternal nature, \\"As a mum, my responses are now automatic. So when I was playing Rachel in this role, I tried to forget about what now comes naturally as a parent ... Rachel eventually breaks, and that's when she smacks him. It all happens pretty quickly and she immediately realises she has crossed a line.\\" Bloomfield was uneasy filming the storyline, \\"It felt really inappropriate ‚Äì even filming the scene!\\" During filming, Walker wore cushions in his pants so that Bloomfield would not be physically hitting him. In 2014 when the character was entering his teenage years, Harry started to move away from his recurring manner and take up his own storylines. Walker enjoyed the transition, \\"It's been nice to move on from minor parts in plotlines to actual stuff that concerns my character ... I've enjoyed the journey. I look forward to wherever the writers take me next.\\" The storyline dealt with his discomfort with Chris after he lied about fathering a daughter, Trinity Kwan (Maya Ruriko Doura). 'Dick pic' storyline Whilst discussing storylines for Harry in 2017, producer Maxine Fleming encouraged writers to storyline a coming of age plot where he lost his virginity. It was decided to incorporate in sexting so as to appear \\"contemporary\\". Galvin was pleased to be given the storyline, \\"I couldn't wait. It was fantastic. We live for these kinds of things. I was so excited about the scene, when it came to do it I didn't want to ruin it.\\" The storyline unfolded with Harry photographing his genitalia for his girlfriend Lily only for it to be synced with the family tablet and for Chris to find it. The cliffhanger of the episode then revolved around Chris confronting Harry with the line \\"Please tell me that is not your penis!\\" Due to the hilarity of the dialogue, the filming of the scene took 3 takes. Fleming explained the decision to include the 'dick pic', \\"It is a comedy story, but like all good comedy there's a truth at the core of it, and it is social commentary, that story. Many teens are doing stuff like this, and many parents are worried about it.\\" The cliffhanger went viral and Fleming expressed apologies to Galvin for the dialogue, \\"I think Michael now is going to have that line shouted at him across the street. ... So I'm sorry about that Michael!\\" Reception Harry has been referred to as the, \\"most annoying character on the show.\\" Walker himself admitted Harry was an annoying character, but stressed that he was not much like his part. Co-star Angela Bloomfield (Rachel McKenna) praised Walker for his acting during the 2011 illegal smacking storyline, \\"Reid did a fantastic job. He really pulled out all his menace to play that part.\\" Harry was voted by fans as the runner up for character they would like to leave the show the most, in the Ferndale Talk Best of 2013 Awards. Television reviewer Chris Philpot stated he hated advertising more than asset sales and Harry Warner combined. Matthew Denton of the University of Auckland student magazine, Craccum, named Harry the most annoying character on Shortland Street, citing that the \\"spoilt whiney kid has been around for ages, causing grief for everyone\\" and expressed annoyance that Chris had saved his life in 2013. The 'dick pic' cliffhanger went massively viral after airing, gaining international attention. In the week following the screening, a clip of the scene received over half a million views. A British journalist referred to it as, \\"the best ending to a soap ever\\" whilst a reporter for The Spinoff referred to it as an \\"iconic moment for New Zealand television\\". Columnist Alex Casey coined it as the New Zealand television moment of 2017 and noted how it had become a meme. Ethan Sills of The New Zealand Herald believed the storyline would be hard to top for the shows 2017 season. American television host Jimmy Kimmel proclaimed on his late-night talk show that, \\"I know a hell of a cliffhanger when I see one\\", before he recreated the scene playing Harry with Alec Baldwin portraying Chris. The line was voted by the New Zealand public as the 2017 quote of the year.

It was completed in 1301 during the rule of the Zakarid dynasty. It was built and completed as an alternative church of the nearby ruined Katoghike Church, a large three-nave basilica dating back to the 5th and 6th centuries.  Architecture  The Holy Mother of God Church is a small cruciform central-plan interior with a rectangular but almost square plan exterior and a second floor. Centered above is a single cylindrical drum and a conical umbrella type dome. The drum is made up of twelve columns with arches that support the weight of the dome. The second floor has a semi-cruciform layout with single small windows to the left and rear fa√ßades, while on the right is a larger window with a single column that stands in the middle. A small inset portal sits in the middle of the front fa√ßade, with the remnants of exterior stone steps that once led to the second floor. The first floor has a single large portal at the front fa√ßade with a semi-circular lintel and decorative columns, while the left, right, and rear fa√ßades each have a small window. The left and right are surrounded by a large intricately carved cross in high-relief. Exceptionally rich decorations cover a large portion of the church. There are beautiful motifs on each side at the second floor level and geometric patterns around the cornices, eaves, and other parts of the walls. Notable is the large cross carved in high relief on the front flanked by the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus and another saint. Below and just above the portal to the second floor are the motifs of a bull and lion. Above the larger window on the right fa√ßade is a motif of a large bird with a geometric rosette on its chest holding a hooved animal in its talons. On the left fa√ßade is a mountain goat, and on the rear is a large cat pouncing upon a goat. Adjacent to the church are the remains of a chapel foundation. Khachkars and graves are nearby.

K. Thakore (), was a poetry teacher and one of the great pioneers of the Pandit yug, the turn of the twentieth century period in Gujarati literature. Known as 'Ballukaka' in his intimate circle, he played a key role in the development of modern Gujarati poetry. Early life The son of a lawyer, Thakore was born on 23 October 1869 in Porbandar, and later moved to Bharuch in Gujarat. After attending school in Bharuch, he went to Rajkot for further education where he became acquainted with Navalram Pandya, a contemporary of Narmad, Mahatma Gandhi and Manishankar Bhatt 'Kant'. While studying at Rajkot, he came under the influence of Christianity. In his later life he also appreciated certain principles of Islam. At age 18, he married Chandramani. He later remarried after the death of his first wife. Education Thakore learned Sanskrit from Manilal Dwivedi, a language in which he also composed poetry. He hoped to study abroad but was unable to do so due to the death of his wife, after which he had to take on the responsibility of raising his children. He graduated with honors from Deccan College in Pune, where he was awarded an Ellis scholarship for his high marks in English. Afterwards he went to Mumbai to sit the Indian Civil Service examinations, and started writing articles for The Times of India to support himself. He later worked as an assistant editor with the Indian Spectator. He subsequently returned to Deccan College to pursue his master's degree in Arts. He was offered the position of assistant editor for the celebrated news weekly Maratha, but he declined the invitation. In 1983, he was awarded a gold medal for his historical essay An account of the first Madhavrao Peshwa. Career Thakore taught history, economics, political science, logic, and ethics at the D. J. Sindh College in Karachi. He remained active throughout his life, even lecturing at Wilson College, Mumbai at the age of 80. He also started his own publishing house at around the same time, hoping to invigorate Gujarati literature. He died shortly after, at the age of 82, in Mumbai. Works Thakore wrote under the pen-names 'Sehni' (Senani or military officer, after his great grandfather Anuprai, who had been an officer in the army of the Scindias) and 'Valkal'. He wrote his first poem in 1886, published in the same year. His first essay on was published in 1891. His sonnet sequence Premo Divas (\\"Day of love\\") and the collection of poems Bhankaar (published in 1917) are major contributions to Gujarati literature. They were followed by Mhara Sonnet (1935). He also wrote books on literary criticism; his first collection of critical essays, Kavitashikshana, was published in 1924, followed by Lyric (1928), Navin Kavita Vishe Vyakhyano (1943), Vividh Vyakhyano and Praveshako. Thakore emphasized very strongly the need of intellection in the meaning of poetry and of flexibility in its metre. As an editor, he compiled a collection of Gujarati poetry, Aapani Kavita Samriddhi, in 1931, with the aim of introducing readers to some of the best poems in Gujarati literature.

With the same aim he started contributing a regular feature to a literary magazine called Prasthan, edited by Ramnarayan V. Pathak, where he selected a poem and discussed it in detail. He also edited Vachak Manimanikya's Ambad Vidyadhar Ras and Vachak Udaybhanu's Vikramcharit Ras. In co-operation with other scholars, he edited a series of six medieval 'Ras' poems called Gurjar Rasavali. As a translator, he produced versions from Sanskrit of Kalidasa's Abhijnan Shakuntalam in 1906, Malvikagnimitra in 1933 and Vikramorvarshiyam in 1958. He adapted a Russian comedy by Valentin Kataev called Quadrature of the circle. He also authored two plays, Ugati Jawani (\\"Rising Youth\\") and Lagnaman Brahmacharya, both published in 1923. A collection of his short stories was published as Darshaniyun in 1924. B.K. Thakoreni Dinki (1969) is a diary work by him. His historical works include Itihas Digdarshan (1928), An account of First Madhavrao Peshwa (1897) and Indian Administration to the Dawn of Responsible Government (1922).

It is a large four-story masonry structure, built out of brick, steel, and concrete, with the oldest portion at the northeast corner of Davenport and Asylum. That portion has fine Beaux Arts styling, with the entrance projecting slightly at the center of a five bay facade. Modern wings extend to the rear and right of the original block. The New Haven Jewish Home was organized in 1914, the second such charity to be founded in the state, after a similar one in Hartford. It was founded by the Sisters of Zion, a local women's group, and operated out of a residence at the present address. It grew rapidly, serving the Jewish population of southern Connecticut and all the way to New York City. The oldest portion of the present building was built in 1921-23, to a design by local architects Brown and Von Beren. It was enlarged in 1950 and again in the mid-1970s, even after calls were made to move out of what had become a significantly crime-ridden neighborhood.

It is rare and unusual for its design, which places the gable end facing the street, rather than to the side as was more typical in the Federal period.

It is a 2-1/2 story wood rame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its street-facing facade is three bays wide, with the main entrance in the rightmost bay. Sash windows occupy the other bays, and are topped by corniced lintels. There is a small Palladian window in the gable end above. The entrance is flanked by pilasters and topped by a half-round transom, and is sheltered by a gabled hood with elongated carved brackets.

The other major buildings are an office building, also dating to the 1880s, and the bottling plant, built in 1916. The brewery plan is representative of the transition of beer production from smaller local breweries to those producing it on a more industrial scale. It had larger above-ground facilities, made possible by advances in refrigeration, and its bottling plant, a recent innovation, was located across a public way (East Pearl Street) to satisfy tax authorities. and The Quinnipiac Brewery was founded in 1882 by two German- Americans, Peter Schleipmann and William Spittler, during the height of development of breweries producing lager beers. The business was economically successful, undergoing several expansions through the mid-1910s, but was shut down with the advent of Prohibition in 1919. During Prohibition, the plant was sold to another business which produced cereal beverages. After Prohibition ended, the plant was acquired by the New Haven Brewing Company, which produced beer for about ten years. The plant stood either vacant or as a warehouse until the late 1970s. It has since been adaptively repurposed to house residences.

Description Amphibalanus improvisus has a smooth white or pale grey conical calcareous shell composed of six fused plates. There is an oval or rhombic opening at the top which is blocked by two hinged plates. Adults usually grow to about in diameter and in width though they are sometimes larger than this and can grow taller when densely packed. The base is characteristically grooved radially. This species can be confused with the striped barnacle (Amphibalanus amphitrite) and in European waters with the northern rock barnacle (Semibalanus balanoides) or the rock barnacle (Balanus crenatus). Distribution Bay barnacles in the Sea of Azov, Ukraine Amphibalanus improvisus has a cosmopolitan distribution and is found in temperate and tropical parts of the Atlantic Ocean, the Arctic Ocean, the Baltic Sea the North Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. It is not known where the species natural range lies but it may have originated in North America. It has colonised many parts of the world's oceans including the Indo- Pacific and Australasia as a biofouling agent on the hulls of ships. It was one of the first recorded introductions to the Baltic Sea, having been found in Sweden and Lithuania in 1844, the Elbe estuary in 1854 and Great Britain in the 1880s. Habitat Amphibalanus improvisus is found, sometimes in vast numbers, down to a depth of about on rocks, man made structures, buoys, ships' hulls, the shells of crabs and molluscs, and certain seaweeds. It has been known to block the water intake pipes of factories and power stations. It is tolerant of both high and low salinity levels and is often found in estuaries and low salinity bays. As an invasive species it competes with native organisms and it is an unwanted coloniser of the shells of cultivated oysters and mussels and aquaculture cages. Biology Live barnacles on a shell with the small hermit crab (Diogenes pugilator) Amphibalanus improvisus is a filter feeder. It extends its six pairs of modified legs called cirri to catch plankton and other organic material floating past. It is a hermaphrodite and sperm is passed into the cavity of a neighbouring barnacle through a long penis. The eggs are fertilised and brooded in the cavity and hatch into nauplius larvae which drift with the currents. After six naupliar stages occupying two to five weeks, these become cyprid larvae and find a suitable surface on which to settle. Here they cement themselves to the substrate and undergo metamorphosis into juveniles. There may be several broods in the year but usually just two in the cooler waters of the Baltic and only one in low salinity environments.

It included volunteers from France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Poland and Yugoslavia, organised into independent sub-units known as \\"troops\\". Units from No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando served in North- West Europe, the Mediterranean, Scandinavia and Burma, mostly in small numbers attached to other military formations. By the end of the war, No. 10 Commando had become the largest commando formation in the British Army. Background Philippe Kieffer in British uniform with French rank depicted, note the toggle rope around the neck \\"Commando\\" units were first created in 1940, by order of the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, as small highly-trained units which would \\"develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast\\".Chappell, p.5 At first they were a small force of volunteers who carried out small raids against enemy-occupied territory,Chappell, p.3 but by 1943 their role had changed into lightly equipped assault infantry specialised in spearheading amphibious landings.Moreman, p.8 The man selected as the overall commander of the force was Admiral Sir Roger Keyes, himself a veteran of the landings at Galipoli and the Zeebrugge raid of the First World War.Chappell, p.6 By March 1941 there were 11 battalion-sized units now called commandos. Each commando would consist of around 390 men in a small headquarters and six \\"troops\\" of three officers and 62 men each.Chappell, p.7 The idea for a foreign commando unit came from a junior French naval officer, Philippe Kieffer, after he heard of the successful Lofoten raid. The idea was eventually put to the then Chief of Combined Operations, Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten who could see the value of a foreign commando unit but insisted it should include volunteers from all the occupied territories.van der Bijl, p.6 It falls under the command of 1st Special Service Brigade. Formation Men from No. 6 Polish Troop on exercise in Scotland 1943. Note the No.10 Commando, Poland and the combined operations badges No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Lister was formed on 2 July 1942. The men of the new commando were all foreigners except for the British headquarters. Headquarters consisted of a British Commanding Officer, second in command, adjutant, intelligence officer and NCO, medical officer and medical orderlies, signals officer and signals section, training officer, quartermaster, administration officer and drivers. The formation of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando meant that by the end of the war it was the largest commando unit in the British Army. Like all British Commandos the men of No. 10 (Inter Allied) Commando went through the six-week intensive commando course at Achnacarry. The course in the Scottish Highlands concentrated on fitness, speed marches, weapons training, map reading, climbing, small boat operations and demolitions both by day and by night.van der Bijl, p.12 In May 1943 the commando moved to Eastbourne on the Sussex coast where they carried out specialist training which unusually for a non parachute unit included parachute training at No.1 Parachute Training School RAF, Ringway near Manchester (over 80% of the Polish troop were parachute qualified) and they also trained in mountain climbing and Arctic warfare.van der Bijl, p.11 At the same time as the move to Eastbourne the commando got a new commanding officer when Lieutenant Colonel Peter Laycock took over command on 15 May.van der Bijl, p.25 No. 1 (French) Troop No. 1 Troop was formed in April 1942 By Philppe Kieffer, from an intake of 40 Frenchmen, who were initially called 1re Compagnie de Fusiliers Marins (1st Company of Naval Rifles). Overtime the Unit grew up to a second troop (see below, Troop 8) and a half Troop (K-GUN). The unit retained its links with the Free French Forces wearing FNFL insignia and headgear.van der Bijl, p.5 Troop 1, Troop 8 and K-Gun were attached to No 4 Commando for Overlord op√©ration and the Netherlands campaign. No. 2 (Dutch) Troop No. 2 Troop consisted of 62 men under command of Captain Mulders. The troop formed in June 1942 was always below establishment and never deployed as a complete independent unit. But the men acted as liaison officers, guides and interpreters during operations Market Garden, Infatuate I and II.van der Bijl, p. 6 After the war, members of No. 2 Dutch troop served in depot speciale troepen (DST) after former in korps speciale troepen (KST) (1945‚Äì1950); after that it formed the Korps Commando Troepen. No. 3 Troop (\\"X\\" Troop)  No. 3 Troop, perhaps better known as \\"X\\" Troop, was possibly the strangest unit in the British Army, since it consisted mostly of personnel who were technically enemy aliens ‚Äì German and Austrian Jews ‚Äì under the command of Captain Bryan Hilton-Jones. However, its first members, in July 1942, were eight men from Czechoslovakia.van der Bijl, p.6. The troop was also known as the \\"English Troop\\", \\"Jewish Troop\\" or \\"British Troop\\", and was officially renamed the \\"Miscellaneous Troop\\" in 1944. Most members of the troop were Jews of German, Austrian or Eastern European origins. Other members were German political refugees, or members of other religious minorities persecuted by the Nazis in Germany.van der Bijl, p.5 At least one member had been imprisoned in Dachau and Buchenwald concentration camps. All members of the troop adopted British names and false personnel histories. A total of 130 men served in X Troop, but they never fought as a complete unit but provided valuable service to other formations as interpreters and interrogators.van der Bijl, pp.17‚Äì8 The troop lost 21 men killed and a further 22 wounded. _The Unknown Warrior_ purports to be the true story of \\"X\\" Troop commando Stephen Rigby, a.k.a. Stefan Rosenberg and ‚ÄúNimrod‚Äù, a German Jew by birth. He is chosen for a secret and dangerous part in the deception plans to persuade the Germans that the D-Day invasion would happen near Calais and not in Normandy. His secret mission saw him dropped in France, pursued by both the Resistance and the Germans, and eventually briefing in person first Rommel and then Hitler before escaping to return to British forces. No. 4 (Belgian) Troop No. 4 Troop was formed on 7 August 1942, by seven officers and 100 men from the 1st Independent Belgian Brigade under the command of Captain Georges Danloy. As Belgium had surrendered in 1940, the Belgian forces serving with the Allies risked facing charges of treason on their return; the charges were only annulled in 1948.van der Bijl, p.8 After the war, the Belgian troop formed the core of the newly created 2nd Commando Battalion . No. 5 (Norwegian) Troop No. 5 Troop was formed in August 1942 under command Captain Rolv Hauge, the men of the troop came from refugees brought back to Britain after commando raids and sailors stranded abroad after the German invasion of Norway. No. 6 (Polish) Troop No. 6 Troop was first formed in August 1942 as the 1st Independent Commando Company. It was integrated into No. 10 Commando in October 1942. Commanded by Captain Smrokowski it comprised seven officers and 84 men. These men were sometimes approached to join personally.van der Bijl, pp.8‚Äì9 No. 7 (Mediterranean) Troop No 7 Troop was formed in May 1943 after a need was identified for Italian speakers. The commander was Captain Coates but difficulties finding Italian speakers in the British Army led to the Special Operations Executive offering Italian-speaking Slovenes from the Royal Yugoslavian Army. The troop only numbered two officers and 20 men and it was renamed No. 7 Yugoslavian Troop. No. 8 (French) Troop No. 8 Troop was formed in 1943 from 45 men of the disbanded 2nd Naval Infantry Battalion which had been stationed in the Lebanon and men who had been interned and released in Spain. The two French troops were combined under command of Kieffer and called the 1er Battaillon de Fusiliers Marins Commandos (\\"1st Naval Rifles Commando Battalion\\"). The troop commander, Captain Charles Trepel, was killed in action with five of his men in a recce on the Dutch coasts on 28 February 1944. Operations The men from No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando were usually attached to other units who used their knowledge of the area of operations and the language to their advantage as interpreters and interrogators. The first action men from the Commando took part in was the Raid on Dieppe (Operation Jubilee) on 19 August 1942.Moreman, p.22 Men from No. 3 (\\"British\\") Troop were tasked with gathering German documents from the town hall and distribute French Francs to the local French resistance. The No. 1 (French) Troop were attached to No.3 and No. 4 Commando, to act as interpreters, gather information, and also to persuade Frenchmen to return with them and enlist in the Free French forces.van der Bijl, p.13 The men attached to No. 4 Commando assisted them in the capture of the Hess gun battery. Most of the men from No. 3 Commando were captured during the landings. The men from No. 10 Commando / No. 3 Troop had one killed and two captured and never heard of again. Among the Frenchmen of No. 10 Commando / No. 7 Troop captured were Sergeant Major Montailleur and Corporal Cesar. Montaillaur was executed under the Commando Order issued by Adolf Hitler, but Cesar managed to persuade the Germans he was a French Canadian and eventually escaped and returned to England. 1943 In early 1943, No. 5 Norwegian Troop worked with No. 12 and No. 14 Commando raiding the Norwegian coast from their base in Lerwick in the Shetland Islands and No. 3 Troop were involved in the Sicily landings (Operation Husky) attached to No. 40 (Royal Marine) Commando and No. 41 (Royal Marine) Commando and later the landings on mainland Italy.van der Bijl, p.14 Starting in July a series of raids were carried out, by men from the two French troops and No. 3 Troop, on the French and Low Countries coastlines. These raids under the code names of Operation Forfar, Operation Hardtack and Operation Tarbrush were for beach reconnaissance, for the purpose of bringing back photographs and examples of mines and obstacles that had been laid.van der Bijl, p.23 In one of these raids Hungarian born Lieutenant George Lane (real name Dyuri L√°nyi) was captured and taken to see Field Marshal Erwin Rommel to be questioned, Lane believed he was not executed under the Commando Order because of his meeting with Rommel. In total 12 men were reported missing during the Hardtack raids and only five were later accounted for. The commando also took over responsibility for small scale parachute operations together with 4 (PARA) Troop, No. 12 Commando in September.van der Bijl, p.24 In November No. 4 Belgian and No. 6 Polish Troops joined the 2nd Special Service Brigade in Italy.van der Bijl, p.19 Notably the Poles captured a German occupied village alone when the 2/6th Battalion Queen's Regiment failed to reach a rendezvous on time.van der Bijl, p.17 Later in the year No. 2 Dutch Troop was sent to the Far East to work with No. 44 (Royal Marine) Commando and No. 5 Commando behind the Japanese lines in the Arakan in Burma. 1944 In January 1944 the Belgian No. 4 Troop and the Yugoslav No. 7 Troop attached to the 2nd Special Service Brigade were sent to the Adriatic to assist the Yugoslav Partisans. Political differences in the Yugoslav troop and hostility from the partisans led to its disbandment. No. 4 Troop then worked with the Vis Motor Gun Boat flotilla boarding enemy shipping. In April 1944, the commando lost No. 6 Polish Troop which was transferred to the II Polish Corps and later took part in the Polish assault on Monte Cassino. By the time of the D-Day landings the commando had lost the Yugoslav, Polish troops and the two French troops were attached to No. 4 Commando in the 1st Special Service Brigade and landed on Sword Beach. No. 3 Troop was divided by sections between the other eight commando units involved in the landings. Commandos engaged in house to house fighting with the Germans at Riva Bella, near Ouistreham The French troops of 185 men in total landed on the left flank of Sword Beach during the second wave, of these only 144 managed to reach the assembly point half a mile inland. Their objective was the Riva Bella Casino in Ouistreham. When they reached the casino the lightly armed French commandos were unable to break into the fortified building and called upon a Sherman tank to assist and soon captured the position.Ford & Gerrard, pp.61‚Äì62 In another sector of the landings Working Corporal Peter Master of No. 3 Troop attached to No. 6 Commando was ordered to walk down the main street of what seemed a deserted village. The intention was to draw fire and identify where the Germans were hiding. By the night of D Day 1st Special Service Brigade, including No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando elements had crossed the River Orne and were dug in guarding the left flank of the 6th Airborne Division.Ford & Gerrard, p.75 For the next three months No. 3 Troop carried out patrols in advance of the British lines. These patrols were not without loss. The troop commander Captain Bryan Hylton-Jones was captured trying to lead resistance fighters through the lines. Some of the men captured would become prisoners of war while others were never heard of again.van der Bijl, p.31 Hylton-Jones was later released from captivity by No. 46 (Royal Marine) Commando when they captured a German field hospital at Pont-l'√âv√™que.Masters, p.261 By the time the Allies reached the River Seine the original 185 French troops, had been reduced to only 40 unwounded. The numbers in the French ranks were quickly filled by men who had started training as a new No. 7 French Troop using the number left vacant when the Yugoslav troop was disbanded.van der Bijl, p.32 In mid-1944 No. 2 Dutch Troop returned to Europe their first mission on the European mainland was Operation Market Garden 17 September 1944. The troop was divided between the three parachute divisions, 12 men were assigned to 1st British Airborne Division, 11 were assigned to 82nd Airborne Division, Five were assigned to 101st Airborne Division and three were assigned to 1st Airborne Corps headquarters. Another five were assigned to 52nd (Lowland) Division, which was to have been flown into the area when Deelen Airport was captured, eventually they ended up in the Staff of 1st British Airborne Corps. The Belgian No. 4 Troop had returned to England in June and were selected to capture the French island of Yeu only to find during a reconnaissance that the Germans had already left. They moved to the European mainland and were attached to the 4th Commando Brigade for the amphibious assault on the island of Walcheren (Operation Infatuate).Conway & Gotovitch, pp.88‚Äì89 The assault on Walcheren saw the largest concentration of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando men since their formation parade in 1943. Under command Lieutenant Colonel Laycock the commando was deployed; Headquarters and a section from No. 3 Troop and No. 2 Dutch Troop with Headquarters 4th Commando Brigade. The French No. 2 and No. 8 troops with a section from No. 2 Dutch Troop with No. 4 Commando. While with No. 41 (Royal Marine) Commando were No. 4 Belgian and No. 5 Norwegian Troops.van der Bilj, p.46 In December the new No. 7 French Troop having completed training joined the other two French Troops still serving with No.4 Commando.van der Bijl, p.49 1945 In January to March the three French troops carried out raids on the island of Schouwen-Duiveland to prevent the Germans using the Island to mount operations against Antwerp. In February the Norwegian High Command requested No. 5 Norwegian Troop take part in the Liberation of Norway. The troop was transferred to the Norwegian Army at the end of April and then flown to Sweden dressed as civilians to join the Free Norwegian Brigade which was ready to cross the border if the German garrison refused to surrender.van der Bijl, pp.57‚Äì58 The next major operation involving men from No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando was the crossing of the River Rhine (Operation Plunder) and then crossing the River Weser. The main commando force was 1st Commando Brigade with men from No. 3 Troop attached.van der Bijl, pp.53‚Äì54 Also in 1945 two new Belgian troops had gone through the commando school and now formed No. 9 and No. 10 Troops. Together with No. 4 Troop they came under command 80th Anti- Aircraft Brigade to provide local security. No. 10 Belgian Troop went onto liberate Neuengamme concentration camp.van der Bijl, p.57 Legacy Memorial to the members of No.3 (Jewish) Troop in Penhelig Park, Aberdyfi. After the Second World War No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando was disbanded on 4 September 1945,van der Bijl, p.58 but many of No 3 Troop continued in sensitive and secret work in the occupation zone, tracking Nazi Resistance groups, war criminals and translating captured documents. At the same time the rest of the Army Commandos were also disbanded and the commando role was taken over by the Royal Marines.Lord & Graham, pp.216‚Äì317 However the present day Parachute Regiment, Special Air Service and Special Boat Service can all trace their origins to the Army Commandos.Otway, pp.31‚Äì32Breuer, pp.46‚Äì47Molinari, p.22 Of the Western nations represented in No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando only Norway did not develop a commando force. The French troops are the predecessors of the Naval commandos. The Dutch Troop are the predecessors of the Korps Commandotroepen, and the Belgian Troops are the predecessors of the Paracommando Brigade.

Legal context Baronies were created after the Norman invasion as subdivisions of counties and were used for administration. Baronies continue to be regarded as officially defined units, but they are no longer used for many administrative purposes. While they have been administratively obsolete since 1898, they continue to be used in land registration and specification such as in planning permissions. In many cases, a barony corresponds to an earlier Gaelic t√∫ath which had submitted to the Crown. The ancestor of the De Barry family in Ireland, Philip de Barry, received from his uncle, Robert Fitz-Stephen, a grant of three cantreds in his own half of the Kingdom of Desmond (\\"the kingdom of Cork\\") viz. Olethan, Muschiri-on-Dunnegan (or Muskerry Donegan) and Killyde (or Killede) by the service of ten knights.Egerton MS., 75 B. M., as quoted in These cantreds became the baronies or hundreds of Oliehan, Oryrry and Ogormliehan respectively. The name \\"Oliehan\\" is an anglicisation of the Gaelic U√≠ Liath√°in which refers to the early medieval kingdom of the U√≠ Liath√°in. This petty kingdom encompassed most of the land in Barrymore and the neighbouring barony of Kinnatalloon. Oryrry is currently known as the Barony of Orrery and Kilmore. The name Killyde survives in \\"Killeady Hills\\", the name of the hill country south of the city of Cork. According to Rev.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Architecture and history St. Luke's Episcopal Church is located northwest of the New Haven Green, at the corner of Whalley Avenue and Sperry Street in the city's Dixwell neighborhood. It is a single-story masonry structure, built out of red bricks with Indiana sandstone trim. It is L-shaped in plan, with the main sanctuary oriented with its long axis perpendicular to Whalley Avenue, covered by a gabled roof. The sides are buttressed, as is the tower that projects at the center of the front facade. A hyphen connects the sanctuary to a 20th-century addition fronting Sperry Avenue to the rear right side. The main entrance is at the center of the tower, set in a round-arch opening, above which is a small ornately surrounded stained glass window. and The congregation of St. Luke's has its origin in one established in 1844, when the African-American membership of the city's Trinity Church on the Green separated to organize it. At first they met in a chapel owned by Trinity, and then they purchased the building of an African-American Baptist congregation in 1852. They began a building drive in 1894 to raise funds for construction of this building, which was completed in 1905.

The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. It has since been converted into residential use. Description and history The former Strouse, Adler factory is located east of downtown New Haven, at the corner of Olive and Court Streets in the city's industrial Wooster Square district. The factory consists of a large number of interconnected brick buildings, ranging in height from one to four stories. The oldest buildings in the complex have Italianate styling typical of mill construction of the 1860s and 1870s, while expansions in the early 20th century exhibit more neo-Classical styling. The overal form is one of a rectangle with several outward projections at the corners, and a central courtyard that has partial infill construction. and The business that became Strouse, Adler was founded in 1861 as J.H. Smith and Company, and was the nation's first manufacturer of corsets. The business was purchased the following year by Isaac Strouse, who took on Max Adler, a local dry goods retailer, as a partner. The company adopted the name Strouse, Adler in 1899 and was incorporated in 1927. The company experienced rapid growth in its early years, moving several times before moving into the older portions of this complex in 1876. It had previously been occupied by the Winchester Shirt Company. The company was in the vanguard of the rise in the popularity of corsets, as well as the rise of New Haven as nation's largest producer of the garment by the 1890s. The company remained financially successful through most of the 20th century, despite a decline in popularity of corsets, by introducing lighter-weight fabrics and materials, and manufacturing other types of foundation garments. It was acquired in 1998 by Sara Lee, and this plant was shuttered.

A grant of ¬£962 was given towards its cost by the Church Building Commission. The land for the church was given by John Woodcock of Springfield Hall; it was originally a chapel of ease. The church was consecrated on 6 June 1841 by Rt Revd John Bird Sumner, Bishop of Chester. In about 1860 the name \\"Catherine\\" was changed to \\"Catharine\\" and this spelling has continued to be used until the present. About the same time it was discovered that the church was built on a geological fault and that, as a result of coal mining in the area, the west end of the church had moved, causing the spire to lean and twist. Repairs were necessary and these were assisted by contributions from local collieries. In 1864 the church acquired full status as a parish church. Architecture St Catharine's is constructed in sandstone from Billinge and has slate roofs; it is in Early English style. Its plan consists of a six-bay nave with north and south aisles constituting one chamber, a south vestry and a short chancel. At the west end is a steeple linked to the nave by a narthex with stair-turrets in the angles. The tower is square and in two stages, with corner buttresses and pinnacles, and a gable at the top of each face. On top of this is an octagonal belfry, again with a gable on each face; this is in turn surmounted by an octagonal spire, with two tiers of lucarnes. In the lower stage of the tower is a west door and in the upper stage are stepped triple-lancet windows with a clock face above them in the gables. The east window is also a stepped triple-lancet. Inside the church are galleries on three sides supported by cast iron columns, with the organ in the west gallery, and box pews. The west end of the church has been partitioned off by a glazed screen. Assessment The church was listed at Grade II on 11 July 1983. The architectural historians Richard Pollard and Nikolaus Pevsner are of the opinion that \\"the steeple is altogether and quite awkwardly too big for the church\\". Brandwood et al. state that St Catharine's interior, with its original plan, box pews and galleries, \\"is the most intact of Sharpe's churches\\". External features The sandstone boundary wall of the churchyard is listed at Grade II, as is the brick-built vicarage that stands to the south of the church. Reconstruction In 2012 St Catharine's was granted funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund to straighten the spire, which would have collapsed had it been neglected. Work began the same year on dismantling, reinforcing and reconstructing the spire.

Plot Divorc√©e Jesse Larson lives in Los Angeles, California with her sixteen-year-old daughter Jade. She owns and operates an Italian catering company entitled Boccone Dolce (Sweet Mouthful). Jade makes the daily runs to local caf√©s in the area, one of which belongs to her mother's live-in boyfriend Billy Stone. Later that evening, Jade and Billy roughhouse with each other in Jesse's bed. Jesse enters the room and dismisses Jade back to her own room, disapproving of Jade's sleepwear. Jesse is further peeved when she finds out Billy was naked the entire time Jade sat next to him in bed. Billy proposes marriage to Jesse though she declines favoring her sense of freedom and waiting for the situation to be right for Jade. The following night, when Jesse is preparing for a dinner date with Billy, Jade asks if she can tag along. Jesse allows her to do so and the trio dine at an upscale restaurant where their Italian waiter Mario recognizes Jesse from formally working at Boccone Dolce. Jesse promptly flirts with him, causing Billy to become jealous and argue with her. When they return home, Jade, obviously displeased from the night's turn of events, heads straight to bed, but not before an intoxicated Jesse stumbles into her bedroom informing her that it's fun to be in love and advises Jade that she should meet more people in order to experience having a boyfriend of her own. The next evening, when Jesse is assisting Jade in straightening her bedroom, she uncovers a carton of cigarettes. When Jade lies about the cigarettes, Jesse threatens her if she doesn't adjust her apparent attitude problem. Jade suddenly experiences a flashback from when she was in the midst of her parents' divorce. Instead of wanting custody, she forces Jade to choose who she wants to live with. Jade realizes her mother never cared about her. Jade uses this as an excuse to run off to her best friend Horizon's home where Billy tackles her onto Horizon's front lawn. Jade insults Billy who slaps her prompting Horizon to run inside. Billy kisses a stunned Jade who seems to reciprocate. Horizon informs Billy her mother phoned the police for hitting Jade. Billy claims that won't be necessary and leads a compliant Jade back to his car. Jesse is initially upset with Billy for disciplining her daughter, but later forgives him (she isn't aware Billy kissed Jade). After a long day spent at the beach, an exhausted Jesse falls asleep when she returns home. Jesse later wakes up to find Billy and Jade watching a film and orders Jade to remove her sheepdog Otis from her bed and continue the movie downstairs. Billy attempts to have sexual intercourse with Jesse, but when she rejects him, he goes downstairs to have sex with Jade, unbeknownst to Jesse. The next morning, Billy reminds a regretful Jade not to tell Jesse in fear she may never forgive them. After Jade quits her job, Billy allows her to work in the stockroom of his caf√© where he apologizes for taking advantage of her and offers a cash bribe if it means not telling her mother. Jesse arrives, surprises Billy and questions Jade about why she isn't at work. Jade tells her she quit before leaving the caf√©. When Jesse confronts her, Jade is about to tell her the truth when Billy intimidates her into silence. Jade evades her mother and a panicked Billy issues Jesse an ultimatum: either she weds him or he will walk out of her life. Jesse accepts which provokes jealousy in Jade. The following morning, Jade visits her father Les and informs him of the sexual encounter with Billy though she doesn't disclose his identity or what his relation is to her. Jade emphasizes that she refuses to press charges due to the fact he has two children (from his previous marriage) whom he cares for. When Jessie is notified, she manages to extract the truth from the hysterical and emotionally confused Jade; it was Billy. The pressure of the situation prompts Jade to suffer from an asthma attack and she is taken to the emergency room. Jade is later sent to live with Les and his wife Denise. When Jade decides to permanently reside with her father, Jesse breaks down crying and comes to the belief she is a horrible mother. Jesse informs Billy of what had transpired and threatens him to stay out of their lives, the engagement is over, and if he ever goes near her or Jade; she will kill him. Several months later, Jade continues to live with Les and Denise in the San Fernando Valley. She took her mother's advice and opened up her 'friendship circle' and has made more friends at her new school than the previous one she attended. Jesse regularly visits her daughter and they walk the beach together. One afternoon, Jade suggests for Jesse to resume her relationship with Billy now that she is no longer around. But Jesse promises Jade there will be no chance of reconciling. The two discuss Denise's belief in reincarnation before Les arrives to pick up Jade. As Jade races to the vehicle she turns around and tells her mother that if there is such an idea of reincarnation she would still like to be her daughter. This brings tears to Jesse's eyes and she announces her love and sacrifice for her daughter. Jesse continues to walk along the shore of the beach with Otis before she turns to stare at the blue expanse hoping for a brighter future and a new beginning.

In April 2010, series production staff staged a protest at the Casualty studios over the dismissal of seven staff members from the show's props department. Media entertainment trade union BECTU claimed that the staff members were dismissed after 11 months and two weeks of service so that the BBC could avoid granting them rights allowed to employees who have worked for the company for a year or longer. Bectu supervisory official Helen Ryan stated: \\"This treatment of individuals would be unacceptable and immoral coming from any employer. However the fact this it is the BBC, a publicly funded and universally respected broadcaster will cause many to view the BBC in a new light.\\" A petition against the decision was circulated, and BECTU representatives urged the dismissed employees to launch a formal appeal against the BBC.

The company, founded in 1943, is headquartered in Zaragoza, Aragon, where its production plant is also located, The company became famous for the production of highly accurate rocket launchers. Instalaza plant in Zaragoza Instalaza's professional experience is widely noted as a supplier of both the Spanish armed forces and countries around the world. Instalaza has had Pedro Moren√©s Eulate, Secretary of State for Defence between 1996 and 2000, Secretary of State Security from 2000 to 2002, Secretary of State for Science and Technology between 2002 and 2004, and currently Minister of Defense, as representative and consultant. As of 2007, Instalaza SA had 140 employees, a covered plant area of , capital worth more than 5 million Euros, and a revenue of 15 million Euros. Cluster munitions ban The company experienced a crisis in 2008 after the ban on cluster bombs enacted by the Convention on Cluster Munitions. In January 2009, Instalaza still had the MAT-120 cluster bomb in its online catalog. Having been outlawed by the Convention on Cluster Munitions, the Government ordered the shutdown of the weapon's production in line with its obligations under international law. After a public outcry highlighted by the media, Instalaza ended production of the MAT-120. However a note on the Instalaza website states that the weapon remains in the catalog as a mark of their technological prowess and states that the weapon is in compliance with Amended Protocol II of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. According to the manufacturer, the weapons produces 0.0% 'hazardous duds' by ensuring that in case the munition was not functioning upon impact, it would attempt to self- destruct in 20 seconds. If this was not possible, self-deactivation would occur after 10 minutes. Critics argue that studies based on the Israeli-made M-85, a different type of cluster munition, have indicated that items of unexploded ordnance, whether or not they are armed, remain a serious hazard to civilian populations. However, this type of hazard does not apply to the MAT-120, as if in the rare instance the self-destruction mechanism fails, in approximately 15 minutes after impact the electrical charge in the capacitor bleeds out, therefore rendering the submunition's electronic fuse system inoperative, making the dud submunition totally inert, unless the capacitor is deliberately recharged from an outside source.\\"Mortars Aim For More Capability\\" by Rubert Pengelley, Jane's IDR 1/1997 page 54note2 - the first MAT-120 mortar bomb' submunition were called \\"Espin\\" by the manufacture and lacked the self-destruction feature, later MAT-120 submunitions with the self- destruction feature were called \\"Braco\\" Amended Protocol II relates to mines, booby traps and other devices and is not relevant to the legal status of cluster munitions. Instalaza may not sell any patents related to the bomb. Subsequently, the company managed to reorient its production and market new technology. As a result, Instalaza SA continues to produce military equipment for several countries around the world. Instalaza in February 2013, presented its product design and production of arms and ammunition, in the Salon of Defense of Abu Dhabi, with great acceptance by buyers assistants, which reaffirms that the defense and security industry, are among the most active of the highest overall growth of Spanish exports between 2011 and 2013. Claimed use of cluster munitions in Libya On 15 April 2011, Human Rights Watch and the New York Times documented use of MAT-120 cluster mortar rounds date-stamped 2007 in Misrata, Libya during sustained use of explosive weapons in populated areas by Gaddafi forces, although the Secretary of State of the USA, Hillary Clinton said she was ‚Äúnot aware‚Äù of the specific use of cluster or other indiscriminate weapons in Misurata .

He served as an officer of the American Neurological Association for twenty years. Hammond was a competitive fencer who competed in the 1912 Olympics, helped found the Amateur Fencers League of America and served as president emeritus of the American Olympic Association. Early life and education Graeme Monroe Hammond was born on February 1, 1858 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of neurologist and Surgeon General of the United States Army Brigadier General William Alexander Hammond. The Hammond family lived in Washington D.C. during the American Civil War. Graeme Hammond later recalled his regular trips as a young boy, accompanying Abraham Lincoln to visit wounded soldiers during the war. \\"I shall never forget the sweetness of the man nor the understandings which he showed in dealings with a little boy... we were play fellows and even the soldiers who accompanied us, I felt, were doing so as much for me as they were for the man who would take me in his great hands and set me beside himself in the carriage.\\" Following the close of the Civil War, the family moved to New York City. Hammond graduated from the Columbia School of Mines in 1877. He then earned a Doctor of Medicine degree from New York University School of Medicine in 1881. On April 27 of the same year, Hammond married Louise Ellsworth with whom he would have four daughters during the 1880s. While teaching at NYU, Hammond continued his education, earning a Bachelor of Laws in 1897. Medical career During his entire professional career, Hammond was a professor of nervous and mental diseases at NYU School of Medicine, serving as the chair in neurology from 1898 to 1920. He became a fellow of the American Psychiatric Association in 1908. He was an officer of the American Neurological Association for more than 20 years, serving as its president from 1911 to 1912. He was also the Treasurer of the New York Neurological Society for thirty years. During World War I, Hammond was commissioned as a Major in the Medical Reserve Corps of the United States Army and stationed at Camp Mills and Camp Upton. As a medical examiner, Hammond determined the mental qualifications of 78,000 individual volunteers and conscripts. He became an expert on the treatment of soldiers traumatized by \\"shell-shock.\\" Advocacy of exercise Hammond was a lifelong advocate of regular physical exercise as a prevention and cure for most diseases, including nervous and mental disorders. According to his colleague, Hammond believed in the \\"principle of a healthy body making a sound mind.\\" Hammond suggested riding a bicycle as a treatment for nervous disorders, in which he included homosexuality. According to the Harvard Gay & Lesbian Review, Hammond thought that homosexuality was caused by \\"nervous exhaustion and that bicycle exercise would restore health and heterosexuality.\\" Hammond supported the enlistment of women as combat soldiers during World War I. He believed that women would make better soldiers than men and that he would prefer to see mixed regiments of men and women. \\"If women could acquire the physical strength and could be disciplined -- (make a note of that) AND COULD BE DISCIPLINED -- they would dominate the earth.\\" Hammond believed that women were \\"the real fighting sex\\" but that the American society \\"mollycoddled\\" women and promoted overindulgent lifestyles in regard to diet and exercise. \\"If women were forced to enjoy the rigorous training entailed by life in a fighting army, this overindulgence would of course be summarily stopped. And at the same time they could be getting regular, outdoor exercise. Nothing could be better for them as individuals and as mothers.\\" Sports Hammond was a competitive fencer who, in 1891, helped found and was the first president of the Amateur Fencers League of America. He won multiple championships in fencing and was the United States champion for foil (1891), √©p√©e (1889, 1891, 1893) and sabre (1893, 1894). At the age of 54, Hammond competed in the individual foil and √©p√©e events at the 1912 Summer Olympics. He was eliminated in the first round of both events, placing fourth in each qualifying pool. Hammond later served as president of the New York Athletic Club and was the president emeritus of the American Olympic Association from 1930 to 1932. Hammond was a roll of honor inductee into the United States Fencing Hall of Fame where he is \\"generally regarded as the father of American fencing.\\" Later life and death Hammond, who both smoked and drank daily, advocated consistent and proper exercise as the key to good health. He continued a daily regimen of running into his 80s and on his birthdays ran four miles on a track \\"just to prove to myself that I am not getting old. And I plan to keep it up as long as I live, which probably won't be much over 110.\\" At the age of 86, Hammond slipped into a coma and died two weeks later, on October 30, 1944. He was survived by two of his four daughters.
