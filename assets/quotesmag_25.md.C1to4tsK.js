After professional stints in Seattle and San Francisco, Kelly moved to Chicago in 1914 where he flourished a banjoist, bandleader, and promoter. In 1915 — before the U.S. prohibition — he founded and operated a Chicago speakeasy called \\"Bert Kelly's Stables,\\" where patrons were introduced to early jazz.  Kelly as a musician = Kelly's band  Early gigs : Kelly's first professional engagement was in Seattle Washington, around 1896. He moved to San Francisco around 1899. San Francisco : In 1914, Kelly was in Art Hickman's band playing tea dances in the Rose Room of the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco. Kelly eventually formed his own band and moved it to Chicago in 1914. Chicago : Kelly's band in Chicago included notable early New Orleans jazz musicians, including Alcide Nunez, Tom Brown, Gussie Mueller, Emile Christian, and Ragbaby Stephens.  Early use of the word \\"jazz\\"  Kelly claimed that his band, Bert Kelly's Jazz Band, was the first to publish the word \\"jazz\\" in 1915. * In 1914, use of the word \\"jass\\" (forerunner to the word \\"jazz\\") was forbidden in mixed company in Chicago. Just before winning the Chicago mayoral election in late 1914, Bill Thompson's first police chief ordered Bert Kelly's Stables — the first \\"joint\\" on Rush Street — to take down a painted banner advertising \\"Jass Music.\\" And, public opinion approved. * In the fall of 1915, Kelly's band had been performing at the College Inn in Chicago. Kelly was directing and playing drums, Wheeler Wadsworth (né Frank Wheeler Wadsworth; 1889–1929) was on saxophone; William Ahearn was on piano, and Sam Baum was on drums. Paraphrasing a 1919 newsprint article by a journalist who chronicled jazz, Walter J. Kingsley (1876–1929), the band played blues, hesitations, and quaint syncopated melodies, and were quite the craze in the night life of Chicago. Thomas Meighan, a movie star, gave a party one night and hired the Kelly band for dance music. The guests included Emmy Wehlen, Julian Eltinge, Jeanne Eagels, and Grace George. Richard Travers filmed it. In a segment showing the musicians, he inserted the caption, \\"The Originators of Jazz.\\" Thereafter, Kelly's band was known as a \\"jazz band.\\" * In a 1973 article, Dick Holbrook, a researcher, refuted Kelly's claim and challenged Kingsley's published account.  Kelly as a jazz club entrepreneur = Chicago  In the early 1920s — during U.S. prohibition — he founded and operated a Chicago speakeasy called \\"Bert Kelly's Stables,\\" located at 431 Rush Street, in Chicago's Tower Town. It rapidly gained regional and national popularity as one of the jazz hotspots of the 1920s. The first house band featured Alcide Nunez, whose featured number \\"Livery Stable Blues\\" inspired the name of the venue. Later artists at Kelly's Stables included Freddie Keppard. The brothers Johnny Dodds and Baby Dodds were featured in the house band after their break from King Oliver's band.  New York  Kelly later opened another jazz club, Kelly's Stables, in New York City, which was prominent on the 52nd Street jazz scene in the 1930s and 1940s.

Further, if an extreme value occurs at two corners, then it must also occur everywhere on the line segment between them. Statement Consider the optimization problem :\\\\min c^T x \\\\text{ subject to } x \\\\in P Where P = {x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n : Ax \\\\leq b}. If P is a bounded polyhedron (and thus a polytope) and x^\\\\ast is an optimal solution to the problem, then x^\\\\ast is either an extreme point (vertex) of P, or lies on a face F \\\\subset P of optimal solutions. Proof Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that x^\\\\ast \\\\in \\\\mathrm{int}(P). Then there exists some \\\\epsilon > 0 such that the ball of radius \\\\epsilon centered at x^\\\\ast is contained in P, that is B_{\\\\epsilon}(x^\\\\ast) \\\\subset P. Therefore, :x^\\\\ast - \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{2} \\\\frac{c}{c} \\\\in P and :c^T\\\\left( x^\\\\ast - \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{2} \\\\frac{c}{c}\\\\right) = c^T x^\\\\ast - \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{2} \\\\frac{c^T c}{c} = c^T x^\\\\ast - \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{2} c < c^T x^\\\\ast. Hence x^\\\\ast is not an optimal solution, a contradiction. Therefore, x^\\\\ast must live on the boundary of P. If x^\\\\ast is not a vertex itself, it must be the convex combination of vertices of P, say x_1, ..., x_t. Then x^\\\\ast = \\\\sum_{i=1}^t \\\\lambda_i x_i with \\\\lambda_i \\\\geq 0 and \\\\sum_{i=1}^t \\\\lambda_i = 1. Observe that :0=c^{T}\\\\left(\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^{t}\\\\lambda_{i}x_{i}\\\\right)-x^{\\\\ast}\\\\right)=c^{T}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^{t}\\\\lambda_{i}(x_{i}-x^{\\\\ast})\\\\right)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{t}\\\\lambda_{i}(c^{T}x_{i}-c^{T}x^{\\\\ast}). Since x^{\\\\ast} is an optimal solution, all terms in the sum are nonnegative. Since the sum is equal to zero, we must have that each individual term is equal to zero. Hence, c^{T}x^{\\\\ast}=c^{T}x_{i} for each x_i, so every x_i is also optimal, and therefore all points on the face whose vertices are x_1, ..., x_t, are optimal solutions.

One of the most famous Macedonian painters, Borislav Traikovski was born on June 15, 1917 in Bitola. Education and career In 1937, he began his studies at the Architecture department of the Technical Faculty in Belgrade, which were interrupted by World War II in 1941, and required his return in Bitola. In the period between 1944 and 1947 he taught arts at a primary school in his home town. In 1951 Borislav Traikovski, Mile Korubin and Risto Lozanovski were the first Macedonians graduates from Academy for fine arts in Belgrade. During his education, Traikovski studied with a number of teachers (Gjorge Andreevic – Kun, Ljubica Sokić, Kosta Hakman, Ivan Tabaković) whose methods often conflicted with his own. After 1951, he returned to his native Bitola and became employed as a professor at the Gymnasium and Teacher's school. While he was a member of the Society of Fine Artists of Macedonia, he spent time on a study trip to Italy in 1954 and Paris in 1961. In 1960, he started working as an associate professor of the Technical Faculty in Skopje; however, he quit after only a few days and returned to Bitola saying: \\"If I had to move and not be able to see the blue skyline of Bitola, I am sure, I would have stopped painting.\\" The academic painter Borislav Traikovski exhibited in many cities in the country and abroad independently or as a part of collective in Bitola, Prilep, Skopje, Struga Belgrade, Zagreb, London, Bradford, Ferara, Paris. Painting Style A large number of his landscapes, still lifes and portraits reflect discernible influences of Rouault and Konjovic. In some of his paintings of his last phase he changed his expressionist style to move into abstraction. Accomplishments Traikovski is one of the founders of the contemporary art in Bitola and Macedonia, one of the founders and first president of Society of fine artists of Bitola, and one of the most significant members of the \\"VDIST\\" group. For his work he has been awarded a number of awards and prizes. He has taken part in numerous group exhibitions, art colonies in Macedonia, Europe etc. His significant work are remembered by the use of alternative art-exhibition spaces such as different factories, streets, public spaces, squares – guided with the idea of \\"art for all\\". His works are part of all permanent museum collections in Macedonia, a number of museums in Europe and can be found in private collections. The jubilee exhibition on the occasion of 40 years of his creation in 1991, represented confirmation of his artistic personality. This exhibition is important for the development of the Macedonian modern painting as a whole. In his honor, since 2006 the Society of Fine Artists of Bitola has inaugurated a yearly prize bearing his name. The prize “Borislav Traikovski” is awarded for the best art work presented at the yearly exhibition of the Society of Artists.

Synthesis Nitroacetic acid can be synthesized by adding cold chloroacetic acid into a cold, slightly alkaline aqueous solution, followed by mixing with aqueous sodium nitrite solution. It is important during this procedure not to make the solution too alkaline and to keep it cold to prevent the formation of sodium glycolate.

All the murderers were commercial art students at the Abhinav Kala Mahavidyalaya, Tilak Road, and were hanged for their crimes on 27 November 1983. The group had acquired a poor reputation on their college campus for robbery and drinking. Timeline=16 January 1976 – Prakash Hegde Prakash was a classmate of killers at Abhinav. His father, Sundar Hegde, ran a small restaurant (Vishwa) behind Abhinav Kala Mahavidyalaya. The group hatched a plot to kidnap Prakash for ransom. On 15 January 1976, the foursome and classmate Suhas Chandak picked up Prakash on a false pretence and took him to Jakkal's tin shed on Karve Road. They forced him to write a note to his father saying that he was leaving home. On the night of 16 January 1976, they gagged him, took him to Peshwe Park, which is just meters from Hotel Vishwa. There they strangled him with a nylon rope, placed his body in an iron barrel, inserted some stones and dumped the barrel into the Park lake. The next day, they sent a ransom note to his father. August 1976 – Kolhapur The gang moved to the city of Kolhapur in August 1976, but were unsuccessful when they targeted the house of a local businessman. 31 October 1976 – Joshi Achyut Joshi, from Vijaynagar colony, was attacked on the night of 31 October. The group forced their way into his house, brandishing knives. Joshi and his wife Usha were the only ones at home. After tying the couple's hands and legs, the four strangled Joshi with nylon rope and suffocated his wife. When the Joshis' teenage son Anand arrived home, they stripped him naked and strangled him with nylon rope. The gang then stole several items, including a mangalsutra, a watch and several thousand rupees. 22 November 1976 – Bafana Yashomati Bafana's bungalow on Shankarseth Road was attacked on the evening of 22 November. However, Bafana and her two servants fought back and the assailants escaped by climbing a barbed-wire fence around the perimeter. 1 December 1976 – Abhyankar On 1 December 1976 at around 8 pm, the group attacked the Smriti bungalow on Bhandarkar Road belonging to the Abhyankars. There were five people in the house: noted Sanskrit scholar Kashinath Shastri Abhyankar (age 88); his wife Indirabai (age 76); their maid Sakubai Wagh (age 60), granddaughter Jui (age 20) and grandson Dhananjay (age 19). The four gained entrance by ringing the doorbell. When Dhananjay opened the door they stuffed his mouth with a ball of cloth, tied his hands and told him to direct them inside the house. The men killed each person by stuffing their mouths with a ball of cloth, tying their hands and legs and then strangling them with a nylon rope. The granddaughter, Jui, was stripped naked and forced to direct them to the valuables in the house before she was killed. 23 March 1977 – Anil Gokhale Anil Gokhale was the younger brother of a college friend, Jayant Gokhale. On the evening of 23 March 1977, Anil was supposed to meet his brother at the Alka Talkies and was offered a ride home by Jakkal on his motorcycle. He was taken to Jakkal's shed, and strangled with a nylon rope. His body was tied to an iron ladder, weighed down with boulders and dumped into the Mula-Mutha river near Bund Garden. Investigation Assistant Commissioner of Police Madhusudan Hulyalkar led the investigation. On the evening of 24 March 1977, the body of Anil Gokhale surfaced near Yerwada. The police team, led by Police Inspector Manikrao Damame, noticed that the nylon ropes used to tie the body to the ladder were fastened in a manner identical to earlier murders. The police had initially thought the murders were a result of botched robberies, but were soon faced with the fact that they were following a group of serial killers. Cases like these were rare at that time in India, and the police began an intensive investigation to prevent additional deaths. When questioned by police, the four men contradicted each other about their movements in the city over the previous week. Satish Gore (a colleague) cracked under questioning, leaking information about Prakash Hegde's murder and the location of his body. The signatures of strangulation with nylon rope and a specific knot also helped police zero in on the culprits. Further confessions were made by another classmate, Suhas Chandak, who was a witness to the Hegde killing. The killers were apprehended on 30 March 1977. Court case Shamrao G. Samant, a senior criminal lawyer who had conducted many successful prosecutions for the state government, was appointed special public prosecutor for the trial. The case began on 15 May 1978 in Pune district, lasting more than four months. On 28 September 1978, they were sentenced to death by Pune Sessions Court Judge Waman Narayan Bapat. Their sentences were confirmed by the Bombay High Court on 6 April 1979, and their special leave petitions against their convictions and sentences were dismissed by the Supreme Court on 17 November 1980. Appeal After both the High Court and Supreme Courts turned down their appeals, the accused approached the President of India for a pardon. The pardon was not granted, and the four were hanged at Yerwada Central Jail on 27 November 1983.

It was active between 1919 and 1926, when it merged with the Slovenian Agrarian Labour Republican Party into the Slovenian Peasant's Party. In the early 1920s, it was the second largest party in Slovenia, after the Slovene People's Party. The party was founded in 1919. It was initially meant as the rural branch of the largely urban Yugoslav Democratic Party. However, it soon became fully independent. The party was mostly supported by wealthy farmers and the rural middle class. In the elections for the Yugoslav constitutional assembly of 1920, it gained 21% of the votes in Slovenia, thus becoming the second largest Slovenian party, after the Slovene People's Party, and it gained 8 of the 38 Slovenian seats in the Yugoslav Parliament. In the municipal elections of 1921, the Independent Agrarian Party maintained approximately the same percentage of votes, and managed to defeat the Slovene People's Party in several districts of southern Slovenia (Lower Carniola and White Carniola) and in the Celje region. In the discussions on the Yugoslav constitution in 1921, the party adopted a rigidly centralist attitude. As the majority of the Slovenian population at the time supported some sort of territorial autonomy for Slovenia, this decision proved very damaging for the party's future success. In the parliamentary elections of 1923, the party suffered a severe defeat, losing more than half of its votes, gaining around 9% of the Slovenian votes, and only 1 MP in the Yugoslav Parliament. In the 1925 elections, the party did not manage to improve its result. After the defeat of 1925, the party gradually shifted its program. It formed an alliance with the left wing Slovenian Agrarian Labour Republican Party of Albin Prepeluh, and adopted a program which was more favourable to Slovenian autonomy within Yugoslavia. In 1926, the two parties merged in the Slovene Peasant Party, which inherited the organization structure of the Independent Agrarian Party, but whose program and ideology was much closer to the left wing agrarianism advocated by Prepeluh's Agrarian Labour Republican Party.

It originally aired on ABC in the United States on February 21, 2010. In the episode, former stripper Robin Gallagher (Julie Benz) interacts with each of the women of Wisteria Lane, drastically affecting their lives. She grows particularly close to Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany), with whom she shares a kiss during a bar outing. The episode was written by David Schladweiler and directed by David Warren. It included the second in a string of guest appearances by Benz, who had recently departed as a regular from the Showtime drama series, Dexter. \\"Lovely\\" introduced an ongoing storyline of Katherine exploring her sexuality, a subplot which was met with enthusiasm by actress Delany. The pairing between Robin and Katherine was the first lesbian relationship in Desperate Housewives. \\"Lovely\\" received generally mixed reviews, with detractors criticizing it for failing to advance the show's plotlines. According to Nielsen ratings, the episode was seen by 10.9 million viewers, and matched the series low rating from the previous episode, \\"The Glamorous Life\\", although the subsequent episode, \\"The Chase\\", drew even poorer ratings. Viewership for \\"Lovely\\" suffered because of competition from the 2010 Winter Olympics. Plot=Back story Desperate Housewives focuses on the lives of several residents on the suburban neighborhood of Wisteria Lane. In recent episodes, Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher) has encouraged a stripper Robin Gallagher (Julie Benz) to quit her job and turn her life around. Susan invited Robin to move into her house until she gets back on her feet. Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) has been admitted to a psychiatric hospital after suffering a mental breakdown stemming from the breakup of her relationship with Mike Delfino (James Denton), who has since married Susan. Orson Hodge (Kyle MacLachlan) has recently learned that his wife, Bree Van de Kamp (Marcia Cross), was having an affair with Susan's ex-husband Karl Mayer (Richard Burgi). Orson has been using a wheelchair since Christmas, as a result of a small passenger plane crash landing into a building he and Karl were inside; Karl died as a result of the accident. Angie (Drea de Matteo) and Nick Bolen (Jeffrey Nordling) recently moved onto Wisteria Lane to escape circumstances that are yet to be fully explained; however, Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Carlos Solis (Ricardo Antonio Chavira) overheard the Bolens arguing about their circumstances, and have grown concerned about their niece Ana (Maiara Walsh) dating the Bolens' son, Danny (Beau Mirchoff). Episode As Robin becomes integrated into Wisteria Lane, she gradually begins to affect the lives of several of her new neighbors. Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman), who is in the middle of celebrating her wedding anniversary with Tom (Doug Savant), grows angry when she learns her son Parker (Joshua Logan Moore) is spying on Robin while she showers next door. Lynette rudely confronts Robin, who tells Lynette that Parker offered her money to have sex with him. Later, Parker tells his parents he is the only one of his friends who have not had sex. Tom assures him it will happen when the time is right, and Lynette apologizes to Robin. Later, Robin learns Bree has had trouble connecting with Orson due to her recent affair. Robin suggests Bree restart their sex life, prompting Bree to later try giving Orson a lap-dance. The dance proves awkward, especially when Bree falls over and Orson runs over her foot with the wheelchair. Bree explains she wants to become intimate with her husband again, and the two share a romantic moment. Meanwhile, Gabrielle and Carlos plot to break up Ana and Danny. Gabrielle arranges for an old photographer friend in New York City to help Ana with her modeling career, but she turns down the offer because of her relationship with Danny. After Robin tells Gabrielle that she gave up a career in ballet for a boy in her youth, only for the boy to break up with her two months later, and that she then got in a car crash ruining her chances of a future in ballet, Gabrielle convinces Robin to tell the story to Ana. Ana breaks up with Danny and leaves for New York, but after Robin realizes she has been used, she speaks to Danny, who secretly leaves town in a taxi to chase after Ana. Susan grows jealous when Robin starts giving Mike massages to ease his sore back. Susan tries to give Mike a massage, but being the klutz that Susan is, ends up putting him in the hospital. Susan confesses her jealousy to Robin, who decides to preserve their friendship by moving out. Robin becomes a roommate to Katherine, who is still feeling depressed after her recent stint in a mental hospital. Robin encourages Katherine to go out to a bar, and the two have a great time. When two men hit on Robin and show no interest in Katherine, Robin shows them up by kissing Katherine on the lips. Katherine initially laughs at the funny moment, but later learns Robin really is a lesbian. Katherine insists she is not interested in women when Robin suggests she explores the possibility, but later it appears that Katherine may be intrigued by the idea. Production Julie Benz (pictured) continued a string of guest appearances in \\"Lovely\\" as former stripper Robin Gallagher. \\"Lovely\\" was written by David Schladweiler and directed by David Warren. It marked the second in a string of at least four guest appearances by actress Julie Benz as Robin Gallagher, a former stripper seeking a new life. Benz joined the show soon after her departure as a regular cast member from the Showtime drama series Dexter, where her character Rita Morgan was killed in the fourth season finale, \\"The Getaway\\". Benz said of her role in Desperate Housewives, \\"I love the show so much, and I am honored to be part of the whole [world] of Wisteria Lane. And to work with all these great, amazing women! I've done a lot of male-dominated movies and television shows, so it's so amazing for me to be a part of a show that is female-dominated.\\" \\"Lovely\\" introduced an ongoing storyline of Katherine Mayfair exploring her sexuality. Actress Dana Delany, who previously played a lesbian character in the Showtime series The L Word, said she felt the subplot was an excellent idea: \\"A lot of the ladies on the set have said, 'Why has this not happened before?' I think everybody wanted to be the one who got to do it.\\" In an interview with E! Online, actress Marcia Cross jokingly said of the kiss scene, \\"I'm a little jealous that I'm not involved. What is going on?\\" Delany said she did not know if the character would become a lesbian permanently, because the story lines change so often in Desperate Housewives, but that series creator Marc Cherry \\"is interested in playing the complexity of that\\". Delany compared Katherine's new realizations to that of actress Meredith Baxter, who realized she was a lesbian late in her life after entering into a relationship with a woman. Delany said she believed her character would be taken by surprise by the new feelings she is experiencing: \\"I think that she’s still so emotionally vulnerable from getting out of the loony bin, and I think she and Robin connect on a kind of wounded, emotional level. And I think if anything, she’s feeling this kind of emotional solace with her, and that draws her to Robin in a physical way, and that’s confusing to her.\\" Delany and Benz were both sick when they filmed their kiss scene. Benz said of the scene, \\"Dana's a great kisser.\\" Delany said more male crew members were present for the filming of the lesbian kiss scene than usual due to the sensuality of the scene. Reception In its original American broadcast on February 21, 2010, \\"Lovely\\" was seen by 10.9 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, which is 20 percent below the season average. Among viewers between ages 18 and 49, it received a 3.7 rating/9 share; a share represents the percentage of households using a television at the time the program is airing. This rating matched the previous episode, \\"The Glamorous Life\\", for the lowest rating for an individual episode of Desperate Housewives in series history. However, it held that distinction only two weeks before \\"The Glamorous Life\\", and the subsequent episode \\"The Chase\\", received even lower ratings. \\"Lovely\\" continued a downward trend in the ratings: \\"The Glamorous Life\\" was seen by 11.82 million viewers, and the previous episode, \\"How About a Friendly Shrink?\\", was seen by 11.2 million viewers and achieved the lowest rating of the series at the time. \\"Lovely\\" suffered in the ratings partially due to competition from the NBC broadcast of the 2010 Winter Olympics. The day \\"Lovely\\" was originally broadcast, the 2010 Winter Olympics drew an average of 24.67 million viewers during the episode's 9 p.m. timeslot. Desperate Housewives was also outperformed by the CBS reality series Undercover Boss which, in its third episode, drew 13.6 million viewers. \\"Lovely\\" received generally mixed reviews. Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times said he was initially skeptical of the Robin and Katherine romance subplot, but said he liked how it was presented. \\"It wasn’t contrived like other girl-on-girl scenes on television that we see. ... I just hate it when it’s used to seem 'edgy' or to sell an episode, and I hope that isn't the case here.\\" Kennedy said the Bree and Orson scenes led to \\"a tender moment\\", but said Susan was annoying and the Lynette plotline was somewhat insulting toward women. Isabelle Carreau of TV Squad said he was surprised Robin's back story was fleshed out so quickly, and speculated it could lead to a permanent role in the series. Carreau said the pairing of Robin and Katherine could be \\"very interesting\\", and that the best part of the episode was the comical conversation between Robin and Karen McCluskey (Kathryn Joosten) at the end. Entertainment Weekly writer Tanner Stransky criticized \\"Lovely\\" for stringing together several uninteresting and unfunny segments rather than advancing existing plotlines or introducing new ones. He was particularly critical of the Susan and Lynette segments, but said the introduction of Katherine's possible lesbianism was \\"intriguing for the moment\\". Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC also criticized the episode for failing to advance the plot, and sarcastically wrote of the Katherine development, \\"Oh, because lesbian storylines have worked so well on this show in the past, except, never.\\" Cooper said the segment involving Robin and Bree was the only one that didn't feel \\"stilted and sad\\".

Constructed in 1815 for a group formed in 1801, it has been named a historic site. Founded as \\"Concord\\", Colerain was the second community to be founded in present-day Belmont County. The founders were Friends who emigrated largely from North Carolina and Virginia to escape slavery.McKelvey, A.T., ed. Centennial History of Belmont County, Ohio, and Representative Citizens. Chicago: Biographical, 1903. The first monthly meeting at Concord was held on December 19, 1801, but in the early years, its locations varied from the vicinity of Wheeling, the nearby Short Creek, and Plainfield in Coshocton County.Wayland, John Walter. Hopewell Friends History, 1734-1934, Frederick County, Virginia. Baltimore: Genealogical, 1975. Until Miami Monthly Meeting was established in 1803, many Friends settling in southwestern Ohio were members at Concord. Other members left around the same time to form a separate monthly meeting, Stillwater, in Warren Township. By the late nineteenth century, this settlement had grown to the point that it had become the permanent meeting place of Ohio Yearly Meeting. Both Concord and Stillwater suffered division in 1828, as the Hicksite controversy saw the secession of individuals following Hicks' new teachings. Concord was particularly deeply involved in spreading innovation in Ohio Yearly Meeting, and the quarterly meeting having oversight of Concord was forced to appoint a committee to visit its other monthly meetings to check the spread of dissension.The Friend: Or, Advocate of Truth 1.4 (1828): Whole Issue. Virtually none of the members remained in communion with Orthodox meetings, and from the Orthodox perspective, the meeting was quickly laid down, i.e. disorganized. Constructed in 1815, the Concord meeting house is a simple brick building with no architectural style; the foundation is stone, and slates cover the roof. The structure is a basic rectangle, with doors on both long and short sides; one window pierces the end, and two shuttered windows (one on either side of the doorway) pierce the front. The end rises to a gable, and a small chimney sits atop the peak of the roof. Transom lights are placed above the entrances, which sit atop small flights of steps that rise from a footpath that runs around the building., Ohio Historical Society, 2009. Accessed 2010-10-22. In 2009, the Concord meeting house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its place in local history and because of its historically significant architecture. It is Colerain Township's only National Register-listed site, and one of twenty- six countywide.

She was designed to counter multiple prospective Ottoman dreadnoughts which had been placed under order by the Ottoman government, since this raised the possibility that the Russian dreadnoughts being built for the Black Sea Fleet could be outclassed. The ship used the same main armament as the preceding , but was larger and more heavily armored. Imperator Nikolai I was launched in 1916, but construction was suspended on 24 October 1917. The Soviets considered completing her in 1923, but later rejected the idea. She was towed to Sevastopol in 1927 and scrapped. Design and development Imperator Nikolai I was designed in response to efforts by the Ottoman Empire to acquire modern dreadnoughts from abroad. By late 1913 it appeared that the Turks would be able to muster three dreadnoughts, two of which were armed with guns, versus the three Russian dreadnoughts of the Imperatritsa Mariya class then building. A modified version of that class would be the quickest to put into service and the preliminary design work began in December of that year, well before she was formally ordered on 12 September 1914. She was a much bigger and more heavily armored ship than the earlier ships, but her guns and machinery were virtually identical to those of the Imperatritsa Mariya class to save time.McLaughlin, pp. 255–57 General characteristics Imperator Nikolai I was considerably larger than the preceding Imperatritsa Mariya class. She was long overall, had a beam of and at full load a draft of . The ship displaced at standard load, over more than 's displacement of , and at full load. High- tensile steel was used throughout the hull with mild steel used only in areas that did not contribute to structural strength. The hull was subdivided by 20 transverse watertight bulkheads. The engine room was divided by two longitudinal bulkheads between frames 95–107 and a centerline bulkhead divided the condenser compartment. The double bottom was deep and she was given an ice-breaking bow, probably in the hopes that she'd be able to operate outside the Black Sea. Frahm anti-rolling tanks were fitted on each side to reduce her rolling motion. She had two electrically driven rudders on the centerline, the main rudder abaft the smaller auxiliary rudder. Imperator Nikolai Is designed metacentric height was .McLaughlin, pp. 257–59 Propulsion The machinery of Imperator Nikolai I differed only in small ways from that of her predecessors. The wing propeller shafts were powered by high pressure ahead and astern turbines, while the inboard shafts were powered by low pressure turbines. They produced a total of . 20 mixed-firing triangular Yarrow water- tube boilers powered the turbines with a working pressure of . The forward group of eight boilers were positioned between the first and second turrets while the aft group of twelve boilers lay between the second and third turrets. Maximum speed was estimated at . The maximum coal capacity was , over more than her predecessor's capacity of , plus an unknown amount of fuel oil.McLaughlin, pp. 229, 262–63 Imperator Nikolai I had four Curtiss-AEG main and two auxiliary turbo generators with each driving two dynamos, one each for alternating current and direct current. Each main generator was rated at 360 kilowatts while the auxiliaries had a capacity of 200 kilowatts each. These powered the complex electrical system that combined alternating current for most equipment with direct current for heavy-load machinery like the turret motors. No diesel generators were provided.McLaughlin, pp. 262–63 Armament Her main armament consisted of a dozen 12-inch Pattern 1907 52-caliber guns mounted in four triple turrets distributed the length of the ship. These guns were identical to those used in the Imperatritsa Mariya-class ships, but the turrets were modified to improve the rate of fire.McLaughlin, p. 260 The guns could be depressed to −5° and elevated to 25°. They could be loaded at any angle between −5° and +15°; their rate of fire was supposed to three rounds per minute up to 15° of elevation. The turrets could elevate at 3–4° per second and traverse at a rate of 3.2° per second. 100 rounds per gun were carried at full load. The guns fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; this provided a maximum range of . The secondary armament consisted of twenty 55-caliber Model 1913 guns mounted in casemates. They were arranged in two groups, six guns per side from the forward turret to the rear funnel and the remaining four clustered around the rear turret. Three guns per side were situated to fire ahead as that was the most likely direction of attack by torpedo boats as anticipated by the Naval General Staff.McLaughlin, p. 261 Their rate of fire ranged from five to eight rounds per minute and they were provided with 245 rounds per gun. They had a maximum range of about with a shell at a muzzle velocity of . The original anti-aircraft armament was going to be four 38-caliber AA guns mounted on the roofs of the fore and aft turrets, but this was changed during construction to four 37-caliber of a new design that never entered service. Four underwater torpedo tubes were also fitted, two on each broadside in compartments between frames 43–46 and frames 113–15. Twelve torpedoes were carried for them. Fire control The rangefinders were originally going to be fitted in the conning tower, but this was changed during construction to mounting them in the forward and aft main gun turrets using periscopes in armored hoods on the turret roofs. These would provide data for the central artillery post to calculate and then transmit to the guns for the gun crew to follow. A new, domestically designed, Erikson mechanical computer was intended to be used. Protection Imperator Nikolai I was much more heavily armored than the Imperatritsa Mariya-class ships, as the weight of armor for the former totaled more than the older ships. Even so, Russian armor factories were unable to roll Krupp cemented armor plates of size greater than , compensating by increasing the thickness of the internal splinter bulkhead. The plates were sized to match the frames to provide support for their joints and they were joined together to better distribute the shock of a shell's impact. The waterline belt had a total height of , of which was above the design waterline and below. Forward, the remaining portion of the waterline was protected by two strakes; the lower of which was initially thick, but thinned to . It extended above the design waterline. The upper strake was 100 mm thick and extended up to the middle deck. Aft, the waterline belt was thick and terminated in a 175-mm transverse bulkhead aft of the steering gear. The aft area between the upper and middle decks was the only unarmored area of the hull and had a transverse bulkhead to protect the rear turret magazine from shells fired from rear bearings. The forward bulkhead was only to serve as a splinter bulkhead as it was screened at all angles by side or deck armor. The upper belt ran from the bow back to the aft turret and was high. For the first time it was made of cemented armor which saved and in comparison to the uncemented plates used on the and Imperatritsa Mariya classes respectively. Behind the side armor was a face- hardened inboard longitudinal splinter bulkhead that was 75 mm thick between the middle and lower decks, but decreased to 25 mm between the middle and upper decks. This sloped away from the edge of the lower deck to the lower edge of the armor belt with a thickness of 75 mm.McLaughlin, pp. 261–62 The main gun turrets had a face and rear 300 mm thick with 200 mm sides and roof. The barbettes were 300 mm thick, but reduced to when behind other armor. The conning tower sides were thick with a 250-mm roof. The funnel uptakes were protected by 75 mm of armor, but reduced to 25 mm between the upper and middle decks. The upper deck was thick, which was intended to activate the fuze of any shell penetrating it before it reached the main armored deck that was thick over the armored citadel. Forward of the citadel the upper deck remained 35 mm thick, but aft the armored decks dropped to the level of the top of the waterline belt (the 35 mm deck) while the 63 mm deck was at the lower edge of the belt. Underwater protection was minimal as there was only watertight bulkhead behind the upwards extension of the double bottom and even this was squeezed out as the hull narrowed towards the end turrets.McLaughlin, p. 262 Construction alt= Construction began on 22 June 1914 by the ONZiV at Nikolayev, after the launch of on 7 June cleared the building slip. However she was not actually laid down until 28 April 1915 with the intention to launch her in October 1915. The normal building schedule was maintained until early 1915 as the Russians believed that the war would be over soon. However, workers were diverted to more important projects and war production began to interfere with deliveries of material beginning shortly afterwards which delayed her launch until on 18 October 1916. Several proposals were evaluated while she was building to modify her in light of the issues demonstrated by the Imperatritsa Mariya-class in service. They proved to trim badly by the bow and were very wet forward. One proposal was made to fit Imperator Nikolai I with a forecastle deck to improve her seaworthiness. This was rejected, as the additional weight from the forecastle and raising the forward barbette would actually worsen her trim forward. However, a proposal to add a bulwark forward was accepted. Work on her continued at a slow rate through the February Revolution of 1917, but the unsettled times disrupted her construction and further delayed her. She was renamed (: Democracy) on 29 April 1917 and she was estimated to be about 60% complete. Industrial unrest and strikes further slowed progress and the provisional government postponed further work on 24 October 1917 until \\"a more favorable time\\".McLaughlin, pp. 258–59 She was captured on 17 March 1918 when Nikolaev was occupied by the Germans and Austrians, but they did nothing with her incomplete hull. On 25 January 1919 she was listed by the Directorate of Ukraine as planned to be completed and included into the navy list by 1920. On 27 January 1919 she was mentioned at Directorate Navy Ministry order at the list for renaming from 1920 – into (: Union of Ukraine).pp.131–133 However none of the short-lived Directorate orders were actually implemented.Українське державотворення: невитребуваний потенціал: Словник-довідник / За ред. О. М. Мироненка. — К., Либідь, 1997 pp.205–206 She remained at Nikolayev throughout the Russian Civil War, of no use to either side. The victorious Soviets finally inspected her in 1923 to see if she was worth completing. Her dilapidated state and obsolescent design caused them to conclude that it was not worth doing and she should be sold for scrap. Efforts were made to sell the hull abroad to raise hard currency, but when these came to nought she was towed to Sevastopol on 28 June 1927 to begin dismantling.McLaughlin, pp. 258, 331 NotesFootnotesBibliography * * External links * Detailed article with drawings and projections Category:World War I battleships of Russia Category:1916 ships ","title":"Russian battleship Imperator Nikolai I (1916)"},{"id":"25844627","text":"Susanville is an unincorporated community in Grant County, Oregon, United States, in the Blue Mountains about two miles up Elk Creek from Galena.

The British forces drove off the defenders and destroyed many buildings and ships. The operation was retaliation for American troops burning the Canadian village of Newark (present day Niagara-on-the-Lake). Background When Brigadier General George McClure of the New York State Militia, commander of the garrison of Fort George, decided to abandon the post on December 10, 1813, he ordered the neighboring village of Newark to be destroyed. Giving the inhabitants only a few hours' notice, he turned them out into the cold winter night and burned all but one of the hundred and fifty or so buildings to the ground.Quimby, p. 355 Lieutenant General Gordon Drummond, the newly appointed Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, was planning an offensive against the American positions on Niagara frontier. In the early hours of December 18, a force under Colonel John Murray captured Fort Niagara by surprise. Another force under Major General Phineas Riall raided the American side of the lower Niagara River, destroying the villages of Lewiston, Youngstown, Manchester, Tuscarora and the small military post and surrounding settlement of Fort Schlosser.Quimby, p. 358 Riall's raid was eventually halted when the Americans set fire to a bridge over the Tonawanda Creek. Drummond and Riall intended further devastation, and Riall's troops returned to the Canadian side of the Niagara and marched south around Niagara Falls, carrying their boats, to launch an attack on the villages of Buffalo and Black Rock. Opposing forces Major General Phineas Riall led a force of British regulars, Canadian militia and First Nation warriors. Major General Riall commanded 370 of the 1st Battalion, 1st Regiment (Royal Scots), 240 of the 1st Battalion, 8th (King's) Regiment, 250 of the 41st Regiment, 55 of the light infantry company of the 2nd Battalion, 89th Regiment, 50 of the grenadier company of the 100th (Prince Regent's County of Dublin) Regiment, 50 Canadian militia and 400 Native Americans allied to the British. In total, the force numbered 1,415 officers and men. Available to the American area commander, Major General Amos Hall of the New York Militia, were 2,011 men, all of them volunteers or militia. Stationed at Buffalo were 129 cavalry under Lieutenant Colonel Seymour Boughton, 433 Ontario County volunteers under Lieutenant Colonel Blakeslee, 136 Buffalo Militia under Lieutenant Colonel Cyrenius Chapin, 97 of the Corps of Canadian Volunteers under Lieutenant Colonel Benajah Mallory, 382 of the Genesse Militia Regiment under Major Adams and 307 Chautauqua Militia under Lieutenant Colonel John McMahon. At Black Rock were 382 of Lieutenant Colonel Warren's and Lieutenant Colonel Churchill's Regiments under Brigadier General Timothy Hopkins, 37 mounted infantry under Captain Ransom, 83 Native Americans under Lieutenant Colonel Erastus Granger and 25 militia artillerymen with a six-pounder gun under Lieutenant Seeley.Cruikshank, p. 93 for units, strengths, commanders and dispositions; Index, pp. iii, iv, x, xi, xv and xvii for the respective Christian names of Boughton, Chapin, Granger, Hopkins, Mallory and McMahon Battle Riall crossed the Niagara around midnight on December 29 and landed with most of his men some downstream of Black Rock in the early hours of December 30. He delegated Lieutenant Colonel John Gordon and the Royal Scots to land at Black Rock itself in order to attack the Americans from a different direction.Cruikshank, p. 71 Major General Amos Hall was first alerted to the British presence when Riall's advance guard, the light infantry company of the 89th Regiment, drove off the American piquet at Conjunckaty Creek (now known as Scajaquada Creek) and captured the bridge and the battery there. Hall sent the militia under Warren and Churchill to reconnoitre. When they ran off at the first enemy fire, Hall dispatched a second force under Adams and Chapin but exactly the same thing happened. Hall now took personal command of the remainder of his force. He ordered a detachment under Lieutenant Colonel Blakeslee to attack the British left and advanced toward Black Rock with the rest of his men.Quimby, p. 359 As dawn broke, Hall directed \\"a very heavy fire of cannon and musketry\\" at Gordon's Royal Scots as they tried to land at Black Rock. Gordon was supported by the fire of a five-gun battery but several of his boats grounded and his regiment took substantial casualties before they could force their way ashore. Riall now advanced with his main body against Hall's center, sending a detachment from his left wing to hit the American right flank. Although the Americans fought with considerable obstinacy, according to Riall, after half an hour of fighting the American right wing broke into a rout. In order to avoid being outflanked, Hall ordered a general retreat.Quimby, pp. 359–60 The British pursued all the way to Buffalo, two miles away. Once in Buffalo, the British and Indians sacked it, burning down all but four of its buildings. The British troops also destroyed the navy yard and three armed schooners (the Chippewa, Ariel, Little Belt) and one sloop (the Trippe). Riall's force then moved on to Black Rock, where once again, all but one building was razed to the ground, before going back over the Niagara to Canada.Quimby, p. 360 Casualties The British casualty return gave 25 British regulars, 3 militiamen and 3 Native Americans killed; 63 regulars, 6 militiamen and 3 Native Americans wounded; and 9 regulars missing: a total of 31 killed, 72 wounded and 9 missing. Of these, 13 killed, 32 wounded and 6 missing were from the Royal Scots, who had endured a heavy cannonade while grounded in their boats. The Americans took 5 prisoners. The official American casualty figures were reported as 50 killed and 52 wounded. The dead included Lieutenant Colonel Boughton.Cruikshank, p. 96 The Ontario Messenger of January 25, 1814, published a list of 67 Americans captured on December 30, 11 of whom were wounded. Lieutenant Colonel Chapin was among the prisoners. Eight pieces of American artillery were captured.Cruikshank, p. 74 Aftermath On January 22, 1814, Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, British Commander-in-Chief in North America, issued a proclamation in which he expressed his regret that \\"the miseries inflicted upon the inhabitants of Newark\\" had necessitated such retaliation.

Location Lungujja is located in Lubaga Division, one of the five administrative divisions of Kampala. It is bordered by Lubya to the north, Mengo to the east, Lubaga to the southeast, Nateete to the south and Busega to the west. This location is approximately , by road, southwest of Kampala's central business district. The coordinates of Lungujja are:0°18'36.0\\"N, 32°32'24.0\\"E (Latitude:0.3100; Longitude:32.5400). Overview Lungujja is primarily a middle-income residential neighborhood, with upscale residencies mixed in with the more modest homes. Kamaanya Road, which runs from Busega to the west to Sentema Road to the east, passes through Lungujja. Mackay College, a private institution of secondary education, is located in Lungujja. During the 2000s, Lungujja has been plagued by an increase in crime, particularly, armed robbery, both random and pre-meditated. Lungujja remains one of the few residential neighborhoods of Kampala City that is yet to experience the rapid unplanned housing development boom common in so many other areas bordering the capital city. This could partly be attributed to minimal land segmentation resulting from old existing landlords not wishing to sub-divide land and sell off to pseudo developers. This has resulted in a relatively low population density in the area compared to other locales within or neighboring the capital city of Kampala. Development of public infrastructure has been rather slow in Lungujja. Only a few roads have been tarmacked. The National Water grid extends through the whole neighborhood. Electricity supply remains as unreliable as with other areas in Kampala. Lungujja can be accessed by road from Kampala city using Sir Albert Cook Road, also known as Namirembe - Nateete Road. Lungujja has been a residence of important individuals in the history of Uganda, they include Abu Mayanja, Katikiro Paulo Kavuma and Michael Kawalya Kagwa.

Dennis was a Reconstruction-era political boss in Alachua County, Florida, best known for his role in throwing the 1876 presidential election to the Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes. A native of Massachusetts, Dennis entered the Union Army as a teenager,New York Times. June 17, 1885 served in Florida during the American Civil War, and settled in Alachua County, where he began to exert political control, largely through his control over recently freed slaves. Between 1868 and 1876, Dennis, known as the \\"Little Giant,\\" controlled the appointments of most county officials, including judges, high sheriffs, and commissioners by dint of the cronyism he enjoyed with Republican governors Harrison Reed, Ossian B. Hart, and Marcellus L. Sterns, who appointed the state's county officials after consulting with local political bosses.Hildreth, Charles H., and Merlin C. Cox. History of Gainesville, Florida 1854–1879. Alachua County Historical Society: Gainesville, 1981, p. 46 Dennis became one of the wealthiest men in the north central Florida by selling his endorsements to the highest bidders and then taking a \\"commission\\" from the monthly salary of each. In order to secure the cooperation of his appointees, he kept a signed letter of resignation from each applicant before he granted the office.Hildreth, Charles H., and Merlin C. Cox. History of Gainesville, Florida 1854–1879. Alachua County Historical Society: Gainesville, 1981, p. 46 Dennis held several political offices in his own right, and was a member of the Florida State Senate from 1870 to 1878. During the election of 1876 he served on the Republican state executive committee. On the evening of August 21, 1876, as Dennis was addressing a meeting of the Hayes-Wheeler Club at the Gainesville Academy, two shots were fired, throwing the meeting into chaos, but causing no other damage. After the meeting came back to order, Dennis blamed the Democrats for the presumed assassination attempt and urged retaliation. The perpetrator was never identified, and the Democrats claimed that the disruption was a Republican ruse meant to arouse the anger of local blacks.Hildreth, Charles H., and Merlin C. Cox. History of Gainesville, Florida 1854–1879. Alachua County Historical Society: Gainesville, 1981, p. 48 The ensuing election brought out the worst in both parties—intimidation of black voters by the Democrats and fraud by the Republicans. The final vote for the county was 1,984 votes for the Republican electors and 1,267 for the Democrats. Although the Democrats did not claim to have carried the county, they did assert that 219 Republican votes had been added to a ballot box from the town of Archer after the polls had closed. In an ironic twist, the outcome of the litigious election was that the Republicans won the presidential race, but the Democrats carried the gubernatorial contest by 195 votes, which cost Dennis most, if not all, of his political power. Two years later, a committee appointed by the Democratic-led United States House of Representatives extracted an admission from Dennis that he had, indeed, stuffed the controversial ballot box from Archer.Hildreth, Charles H., and Merlin C.

During the next three years, he was involved in various investments and civic improvements, and in 1882 presented Gainesville with its first fire engine, which, two years later, was incapable of preventing a blaze from leveling every building on the west side of the Courthouse Square. On the morning of June 14, 1885, Dennis complained to his visiting nephew of feeling unwell. He lost consciousness and died at 5 pm. The report of his death in the Florida Times-Union, reprinted in the New York Times, concluded: \\"The depraving influences or war, its license, violence, and perils no doubt warped somewhat his impulsive, dashing nature, and the corrupting influences of politics completed in him many faults which his best friends could not deny that he possessed.\\" New York Times.

According to the law of Denmark, the patient must be over the age of 18 to decide on an abortion alone; parental consent is required if she is a minor. An abortion can be performed after 12 weeks if the woman's life is in danger and even in cases where the woman has mental health problems. A woman may also be granted an authorization to abort after 12 weeks if certain circumstances are proved to be present (such as poor socioeconomic condition of the woman; risk of birth defects to baby; the pregnancy being the result of rape; mental health risk to mother).http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/population/abortion/Denmark.abo.htm Abortion was first allowed in 1939 by application; if the doctors deemed the pregnancy fell into one of three categories (harmful or fatal to the mother, high risk for birth defects, or a pregnancy borne out of rape), a woman could legally have her pregnancy terminated.The rocky road to abortion on demand A little more than half of the applications received in 1954 and 1955 were accepted; the low acceptance rates were linked to a surge of illegal abortions performed outside the confines of hospitals. An addendum to the 1939 law was passed on 24 March 1970, allowing on-demand abortions only for women under the age of 18 who were deemed \\"ill-equipped for motherhood,\\" and women over the age of 38. The 1973 law is still valid today and nullifies the 1970 law. , the abortion rate was 12.1 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–49 years, which is below average for the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden). The vast majority of Danes support access to legal abortions. In 2007, polls found that 95% supported the right.  Faroe Islands  Abortion on the Faroe Islands is still governed by the Danish law of 1956, which restricts abortions to the aforementioned three circumstances (pregnancy harmful or fatal to the mother, high risk for birth defects, or a pregnancy borne out of rape), as Danish politicians were historically unwilling to impose the Danish abortion law on the more conservative Faroese population. Abortion policy was formally devolved to the Faroese Parliament in 2018. The abortion rate in the Faroe Islands is about one-third the rate in Denmark. Additionally, some Faroese women travel to Denmark to have the procedure done.  Greenland  Abortion in Greenland was legalized on 12 June 1975, under legislation equivalent to the Danish law. The abortion rate in Greenland is among the highest in the world, and about five times higher than in Denmark, with the number of abortions exceeding live births in some years. Despite being treated as a public health concern, the rate remains high.

He served as the secretary-general of the International Astronomical Union from 1964 to 1967. Pecker was the President of the Société astronomique de France (SAF), the French amateur astronomical society, from 1973–1976.List of presidents of the Société astronomique de France He was awarded the Prix Jules Janssen by the French Astronomical Society in 1967. A minor planet (1629 Pecker) is named after him. Pecker was a vocal opponent of astrology and pseudo-science and was the president of the Association française pour l'information scientifique (AFIS), a skeptical organisation which promotes scientific enquiry in the face of quackery and obscurantism. Early life Jean-Claude Pecker was born 10 May 1923, in Reims, to Victor-Noël Pecker and Nelly Catherine née Hermann (a teacher of Philosophy and Literature), in the department of Marne, France. The grandson of Joseph Hermann, rabbi of Valenciennes and later Reims, Pecker was born in his maternal grandparents' house, moving later to Bordeaux. In the summer of 1941 they moved to the Hermann house in Paris because of anti-Jewish restrictions placed on his parents during the Vichy regime. In May 1944 both his parents were transported to Auschwitz where they died, while his grandmother, absent during the raid, was hidden by neighbour Ida Barrett who was later designated by the state of Israel as one of the Righteous Among the Nations for her actions to conceal the old lady until the liberation of Paris. Pecker was interested in astronomy from a young age. He studied at the Lycée Michel de Montaigne de Bordeaux but was forced to go into hiding during the Second World War. After the Liberation of France he attended the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. In October 1946 he joined the Institut d'astrophysique de Paris and studied for the agrégation of physics and chemistry, where he studied under, and had his doctoral thesis judged by Nobel Prize winning physicist Alfred Kastler. He earned his doctorate in May 1950. At the Institut d’Astrophysique he got to know and shared an office with Évry Schatzman with whom he collaborated for many years. Professional career From 1952 to 1955 Pecker was associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Clermont-Ferrand. From early in his career he held many international appointments including fellow of the High Altitude Observatory in Colorado, USA. In 1955 he became astronomer for the Paris Observatory followed by director of the Nice Observatory in 1961. In 1963 Pecker became professor of theoretical astrophysics at the Collège de France in Paris, a position he held until 1988 when he became honorary professor. He was also director of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) Institute of Astrophysics from 1972-1978. His main fields of work within astrophysics were solar and stellar atmospheres and sun-earth interactions. He was also known for questioning the standard big bang theory, positing \\"alternative but partial solutions\\" (a quasi-static model) and was signatory, with 33 other scientists, to an open letter to the scientific community expressing concern over the dominance of the big bang and expansion of the Universe theories. They complained that the tired light theory in particular was generally discounted or ignored by most cosmologists at the time of writing.

The Ambulance Corps was initially formed as a unit only within the Army of the Potomac, due to the effort of several Army officials, notably Dr. Jonathan Letterman, medical director of the Army of the Potomac, and William Hammond, the US Surgeon-General. Until August 1862, the lack of trained ambulance drivers meant that the wounded had to wait a long time to receive medical care. This changed at the Battle of Antietam in September 1862 when his new system allowed the wounded men to be transferred quickly so there could be fewer deaths.

Kim Hoàng painting (Vietnamese: Tranh Kim Hoàng) is a genre of Vietnamese woodcut paintings originated from Kim Hoàng village of Hoài Đức, Hanoi, Vietnam. In the past, Kim Hoang painting was a popular element of the Tết holiday, together with Dong Ho and Hang Trong painting, but this tradition was lost in the middle of the 20th century and today several authentic pictures of Kim Hoang painting are found only in museums or fine art galleries. However, the art of making Kim Hoang painting is still considered a symbol of traditional culture and aesthetic value of Vietnam. Themes and making Gà độc in black- and-white, an example of Kim Hoang painting. Produced in the countryside as Dong Ho painting, pictures of Kim Hoang share many common themes with ones of Dong Ho such as everyday activities, animals and sprititual signs. The distinct feature of Kim Hoang painting is several lines of poem written in form of chữ thảo at the left corner of the painting, the content of those lines along with the illustration help emphasize the meaning of the picture. The popular examples of Kim Hoang painting are Gà độc (Cockerel) and Lợn độc (Pig). The woodcuts of Kim Hoang village are more delicate and detailed than ones of Dong Ho village, they are used to print in sheets of paper which are dyed beforehand with red or yellow colours, the red ones are called giấy hồng điều (scarlet paper) and the yellow ones is giấy vàng tầu (Chinese yellow paper). The colours used in making Kim Hoang painting are obtained from black Chinese ink and other natural materials such as white gypsum, red vermilion and yellow gardenia. To strengthen the durability of the colours, the craftsmen often mixed colour paints with glue extracted from buffalo skin. Like the production of Hang Trong painting, Kim Hoang craftsmen only used the woodblocks to create the black outlines and then drew and coloured details by their own hands. For this reason, pictures of a subject, although outlined by the same woodcut, are slightly different from one to another, thus they become more valuable and attractive to customers. History The origin of Kim Hoang painting was dated back to the 18th century during the reign of the Lê Dynasty. The pictures were made in the Kim Hoàng village, now in Hoai Duc (Hanoi), which was one of the few place where folk paintings were made in Vietnam during the dynastic time, along with Hang Trong, Dong Ho and Sinh village. Kim Hoang painting was well received in the 19th century but the tradition of making pictures gradually declined and ultimately lost in the middle of the 20th century. One of the main factor that led to the extinction of the manufacture was a flood in 1915 which destroyed almost all original woodblocks of the village. Nowadays, authentic Kim Hoang pictures are only found in museums and galleries. Pig paintings Kim Hoàng typical and popular Pig paintings are known as the unique artwork of the Kim Hoang painting series. Painting has religious meaning and good luck, so it is very popular when it comes to the new year. Kim Hoang Picture of the pig brings a bohemian and natural line with a clever combination of colors and highlights on the red paper. Pig paintings own unique beauty, highly symbolic. The artisan shows a liberal drawing that makes the image of a more stylized pig with details replaced by a pattern but still retains its inherent soul. The pig's ears disappear instead of spiraling motifs, the definitive strokes of the pen are extremely impressive. Kim Hoang Painting is different from other people's paintings in that it is a combination of printing, coloring and skillfully drawing to create a flexible but definitive line. This is a line of folk paintings with Vietnamese cultural beauty that needs to be handed down and preserved.

Convergence trades are often referred to as arbitrage, though in careful use arbitrage only refers to trading in the same or identical assets or cash flows, rather than in similar assets.  Examples = On the run/off the run  On the run bonds (the most recently issued) generally trade at a premium over otherwise similar bonds, because they are more liquid—there is a liquidity premium. Once a newer bond is issued, this liquidity premium will generally decrease or disappear. For example, the 30-year US treasury bond generally trades at a premium relative to the 29½-year bond, even though these are otherwise quite similar. Once a few months pass (so the 30-year has aged to a 29½-year and the 29½-year has aged to a 29-year, say), and a new 30-year is issued, the old bonds are now both off-the run and the liquidity premium will in general decrease. Thus, if one had sold the 30-year short, bought the 29½-year, and waits a few months, one profits from the change in the liquidity premium.  Junk Bond/Treasury convergence  Typically junk bonds, given their speculative grade, are undervalued as people avoid them. Therefore the spread over treasuries is more than the risk of default, by buying junk bonds and selling treasuries, to hedge interest rate risk. Often profits can be achieved by buying junk bonds and selling treasuries, unless the junk bond defaults.  Cash and Carry  This is when a trader notices a difference in the price of a futures contract (for delivery in the future) and the underlying asset (purchased immediately). For example, if gold is trading at $1000/oz, and there is a futures contract for $1200/oz, the trader would go long (buy) the gold and short (sell) the futures contract. They would make money as the prices converged together, and the profit would be $200 dollars in this example, as the gold price equaled the futures price. = Reverse = A reverse version of this strategy also exists. This is when a trader believes that the futures contract is undervalued and the underlying asset overvalued. Instead of shorting the futures contract the trader would long this, and short the underlying asset.  Related concepts  Formally, convergence trades refer to trading in similar assets in the expectation that they will converge in value. Arbitrage is a stricter notion, referring to trading in identical assets or cash flows, while relative value is a looser notion, referring to using valuation methods (value investing) to take long-short positions in similar assets without necessarily assuming convergence, and is more associated with equities. For example, in relative value investing one may believe that the stock of one mining company is undervalued relative to some valuation, while another stock is overvalued (relative to this or another valuation), and thus one will expect the undervalued stock to outperform the overvalued stock, even if these are quite different companies.  Risks  The risk of a convergence trade is that the expected convergence does not happen, or that it takes too long, possibly diverging before converging. Price divergence is particularly dangerous because convergence trades are necessarily synthetic, leveraged trades, as they involve a short position. Thus if prices diverge so that the trade temporarily loses money, and the trader is accordingly required to post margin (faces a margin call), the trader may run out of capital (if they run out of cash and cannot borrow more) and go bankrupt even though the trades may be expected to ultimately make money. In effect, convergence traders synthesize a put option on their ability to finance themselves. Prices may diverge during a financial crisis, often termed a \\"flight to quality\\"; these are precisely the times when it is hardest for leveraged investors to raise capital (due to overall capital constraints), and thus they will lack capital precisely when they need it most. Further, if other market participants are aware of the positions, they can engineer such price divergences, driving the convergence trader into bankruptcy – compare short squeeze. As with arbitrage, convergence trading has negative skew in return distributions it produces, resulting from the concave payoff characteristic of most such high-probability low-return strategies. Operators engaging in such trades will usually make consistent but relatively small profits, occasionally offset by significant losses, consuming previous profits earned over a long period of time. The low probability of encountering a loss in such strategies can lead inexperienced traders to underestimate the severity of such a loss, and assume excessive levels of leverage, potentially leading to bankruptcy as in the LTCM case.

As a child, he studied violin and piano. In 1976, he won the first television and radio competition for young performers in Minsk, as a singer. Kagan-Paley continued his violin studies at the Belarusian State Conservatory, and, in 1987, he began singing at the Belarusian Academic Capella. This same year he made his debut as a soprano soloist in Schumann's Requiem with the Leningrad Philharmonic. Two years later, Dr. Irina Antonova, the director of the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow, invited Kagan-Paley to give a recital there, and this resulted in several engagements including The Vienna State Opera, various recordings and television appearances. Slava’s fifth solo recital was recorded live by Melodia at the Astrakhan International Vocal Festival (named in honor of the great Russian singers Barsova and Maksakova) which included music by Caccini, Bach, Handel and songs by Brahms, R. Strauss, and Mahler’s “Kindertotenlieder”. The talents of the young singer were greatly appreciated by Leonard Bernstein who, after meeting him in St. Petersburg in the summer of 1989, planned to arrange joint performances; unfortunately, the Maestro's untimely death put an end to these plans. Kagan-Paley was soon after awarded a grant by the Oppenheimer Charitable Trust, and from 1989 to 1992 he completed the post-diploma vocal training course under Professor David Pollard at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. In 1993 the Opera Course was completed. In the same year Slava attended Masterclasses with Graham Johnson and Geoffrey Parsons . His opera debut, in 1992, as Oberon in Benjamin Britten's “A Midsummer Night's Dream” at the Guildhall was greeted with great public and critical acclaim. Slava’s international career started in 1993 when he performed the role of Joan of Arc in the world premiere of “Arms for the Maid” for the Royal Opera House Garden Venture. Since then, he has traveled extensively giving recitals in Russia, the United States, Europe and the United Kingdom. In Germany, the Czech Republic and Hungary, he sang the role of The Witch in the opera Rapunzel by Lou Harrison, with the Prague Mozart Foundation. He also made guest appearances at the Normandy Music Festival, performing Schubert’s Winterreise, S. Richter’s “December Night’s” Festival with Y. Bashmet, and at the New Seasons’ Festival in St. Petersburg. After Slava’s recital in Tallinn, Estonian TV made a documentary about his life and art. The collaboration with the distinguished Russian pianist, Boris Beresovsky, resulted in a series of concerts and recordings in Russia, Japan and Great Britain. After their recital at Leighton House, London, The Times described Kagan-Paley's voice as \\"a diamond among voices”. Alexander Waugh wrote in London’s Evening Standard “an extraordinary, stunning alto … a sound like nothing else on this earth, a beautiful siren, strong and vital without ever piercing the air. I never heard a human voice quite like it…” In the same year Slava made a second recording, Vivaldi’s Nisi Dominus and Pergolesi’s Stabat Mater with the Vivaldi Orchestra, conducted by S. Bezrodnaya and Y. Bashmet (viola solo) on the Olympia label. 1995-97 Kagan-Paley signed an exclusive recording contract with Victor Entertainment (JVC Japan) and embarked upon his first Japanese concert tour to promote his new album Ave Maria, which sold 250,000 copies in 3 months, and became Number One selling classical CD in Japan. His second CD, Vocalise, won the Japan Grand Prix as “Album of the Year” in 1997 At the end of 1997 Kagan-Paley and Berezovsky made their “extraordinary debut” in the famous Santory Hall in Tokyo. 1999 Slava was invited by Opera de Lyon to sing the role of Masha in the World Premiere of P. Eötvos’ Three Sisters conducted by Kent Nagano, recorded live by Deutsche Grammophon. In the same year, he sang the title role of Tolomeo in Handel’s Tolomeo, King of Egypt at Broomhill Opera (UK). Since 2000 Slava works extensively in Russia, Europe and Japan. Amongst other engagements, he has performed in Gluck’s Orpheus and Eurydice with the Raanana Symphony Orchestra. To date, Slava has completed 10 Japanese tours, and in 2003 he sang the main role of a Japanese Princess in the World Premiere Avi Ben Shabtai’s opera Damascus Drum in Israel. Slava Kagan-Paley’s voice can be heard in many documentaries and commercials, while his interpretation of the Caccini’s Ave Maria was used as the sound track for the movie One More Kiss. Slava has performed in many events including the Emma Chaplin Show in Caesarea as well as many charities, including cancer research ( GB ) , victims of terrorist attacks in Israel and the Paralympics in Tokyo ( Japan ) to name a few. 2005 Vyatcheslav Kagan-Paley celebrated the 10th anniversary of his work in Japan with a tour and appeared in a NHK televised Christmas special with the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. For the last 5 years ( till 2010 ) Slava works extensively, giving recitals in Europe,Japan and a Middle East. Made a new recording for Sony Epic ( Japan ), a debut at Blue Note ( Nagoya ) with a new, predominantly jazz repertoire. Was an invited guest at National Opera in Beijing ( China ). Working on a new recording project with Greg Walsh ( UK ). . The new year of 2011, V.Kagan-Paley has started with a new programme recital at Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts ( Michelangelo Hall ) in Moscow.

Description The Caspian whipsnake is perhaps the largest species of snake in Europe. It typically grows to around in length, though a few may exceed a length of . The record sized specimen was approximately This species is not venomous and is mostly active during the day. The head is joined to the body by a thick neck. Its pupils are round. Nineteen rows of smooth scales can be found at the middle body, though rarely there may be seventeen. Dorsal scales each have two apical pits at the posterior edge. The centre of the scale is lighter in colour than the edges. The dorsal side is grey-brown and features markings which are distinctive in juveniles and young snakes but fade with age. The ventral side is light yellow or white. Taxonomy=Synonyms Since its original description by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789, D. caspius has been known by many names. A list of such synonyms is given below: *Coluber caspius *Coluber acontistes *Coluber thermalis *Coluber jugularis caspius *Hierophis caspius *Dolichophis caspius Nota bene: In a synonymy, names without dashes are new taxa (described as new species). However, names with dashes are just new combinations (moved to a different genus, changed from species to subspecies, etc.). Distribution Caspian whipsnake from Ochakiv, South Ukraine The Caspian whipsnake is found in the Balkan peninsula, parts of Eastern Europe and a small portion of Asia Minor. It may be found in Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, North Macedonia, Serbia, Romania, Croatia, Turkey, Moldova, Montenegro, southern Ukraine, southern Russia, Kazakhstan, and southern Hungary. Results from a survey indicate their habitats may be distributed along low areas near major rivers, such as the Danube and the Olt River. It was previously assumed extinct in Moldavia (eastern Romania, southern Ukraine, and western Moldova), where it was only known from two sites, and not observed since 1937. Three specimens were collected in May 2007 in Galați County, somewhat dispelling this belief. Though it is known to be common in the Dobrudja area, knowledge of its distribution in other areas is poor. It is believed to be very rare in these parts, and may also be highly threatened. National legislation has declared D. caspius to be \\"a species of community interest\\" and thus must be strictly protected. In Hungary, it was formerly thought only to exist in two areas: one near the capital of Budapest, and another near Szársomlyó. However, a recent survey of the region has yielded several previously unknown whipsnake habitats along the River Danube, including sites near Dunaújváros and Dunaföldvár. As in Romania, D. caspius is a protected species in Hungary. Habitat Recently observed specimens of D. caspius were found in grassy, open areas with sparse shrubbery. They have also been found in open, bushy areas, specifically, between the Danube Meadow and Romanian Plain, near Căscioarele. Vine covered areas were found near this habitat as well. At Drăgăneşti Olt, the species was found on a hilly slope. Its habitat also includes rocky riverbanks and swampy areas, as well as gardens and cemeteries. Diet The Caspian whipsnake feeds on small vertebrates. Its diet may include small mammals, lizards, birds, and other snakes. Though not venomous, the Caspian whipsnake is considered \\"ferocious\\" and bites quickly and without warning. Due to its ability to consume rodents which may harm crops, it is valued as natural pest control. Conservation Data on the conservation status of D. caspius in many regions are sparse. Whilst it is known to be common in the Dobrudja area, it may be rare and threatened in other areas. In Drăgăneşti Olt, Romania, road-killed snakes are a \\"common sight\\" to locals. Traffic-related deaths may be a cause of their decline in Romania. One of the recently observed habitats, the Romanian Plain, is known to be heavily affected by agriculture. Habitat loss to agriculture may also be a cause of the species' decline in Romania.

It is a small bioluminescent fish, with two rows of tiny photophores along its body. It is very abundant in the tropical Indo-Pacific where it makes large vertical migrations each day. Description Vinciguerria lucetia is a small fish growing to a maximum length of about . It is an elongated, laterally compressed species with a disproportionately large head which is compressed and conical, with a wide mouth and pointed snout. There are photophores on the head and two lateral rows of pearl-like photophores on the underside of the body. The dorsal fin is short and consists of thirteen to fourteen soft rays. The origin of the anal fin, which consists of fourteen to fifteen soft rays, is below the rear of the dorsal fin. The pectoral fins are set low on the body and the caudal fin is deeply forked. The dorsal surface of this fish is blackish, with a few dark-coloured transverse stripes, and the flanks and belly are silvery. There is a black spot at the tip of the tail. Distribution and habitat Vinciguerria lucetia is found in the equatorial water mass of the western Central Pacific and the Eastern Pacific at depths between about . This fish is one of several that dominate the fauna of the Southern California Bight and which tend to make diel vertical migrations, rising to near the surface to feed at night and descending again to remain quiescent by day. Ecology Vinciguerria lucetia is an epipelagic and mesopelagic species. It is oviparous, the eggs and larvae drifting as part of the plankton. The photophores appear during the course of metamorphosis from larval to juvenile fish; these may be involved in camouflage, species or sexual identification or prey attraction. This fish feed on copepods, krill and sergestid shrimps, crustaceans which also tend to make diel vertical migrations.

When later generations speak of bad men, they are sure to mention him.\\" Qi was one of the most powerful states in China at his accession, if not the most powerful. In 288 BC. King Min took the title of Di of the East (東帝), and his ally King Zhaoxiang of Qin called himself Di of the West (Di was originally the name of the high god of the Shang. It also (or later) had a weaker sense of sacred or divine; the same character was used to mean Emperor in later times.) But so many people objected that both kings were forced to return to the title of \\"king\\" (wáng 王) and there was no Di in China until Qin Shi Huang unified China in 221 BC and gave himself the title of Huang Di, which we translate as Emperor. King Min, like his predecessors, supported scholars in the Jixia Academy and inviting prominent visitors to talk with him. Su Qin was one of his advisors; Lord Mengchang was for a while his chancellor. But \\"all of King Min's assessments were like this [i.e. foolish], which is why his state was destroyed and his person placed in harm's way.\\" King Min had his critics executed, sometimes in cruel ways such as being boiled alive or cut in two at the waist; he gradually alienated the commoners, his own royal clan, and the great ministers. In one story, his physician Wen Zhi (文摯) from the state of Song deliberately made the king angry as the only way to treat his illness; the king boiled Wen Zhi alive. The Biographies of Exemplary Women, compiled about 18 BC by the scholar Liu Xiang, includes in its \\"Accomplished Speakers\\" section a story about the virtuous wife of King Min, \\"The Lump-necked Woman of Qi.\\" She was a mulberry- picker who lived east of the Qi capital. One day when King Min came by, everyone stopped working to look at him except this woman. He sent for her and asked why. She said she was obeying her parents, who had told her to pick mulberries (for feeding to silkworms), not stare at the king. The king was interested and wanted to take her back to the palace. But she said she wanted to be treated like \\"a pure maiden,\\" with a marriage-broker visiting her parents. The king therefore sent a messenger to arrange a betrothal. \\"Her parents were very surprised and wanted to bathe and dress her. The woman said, 'When I saw the king, this is how I looked,'\\" and refused to change. At court, all the ladies laughed at her, but she pointed out that the famous kings of old were frugal and modest and therefore successful. \\"After this, the ladies were all very ashamed. King Min was greatly moved and made the lump-necked woman his queen.\\" He cut down on expenses and became less lavish. \\"In several months, the transformation spread to neighboring states, and all of the feudal lords came to Qi's court. [King Min] then invaded the three Jin [kingdoms], struck terror in Qin and Chu, and set himself up with the title 'emperor.' That King Min was able to accomplish all of this was due to the efforts of the lump-necked woman.\\" The book goes on to say that after she died, King Min and his kingdom were vanquished. In 286 BC, King Min attacked and destroyed Song. King Min attacked Chu and defeated its army. But his own army became exhausted, and Qi was promptly attacked in its turn and lost all the territory it had gained. \\"All blamed the king, saying, 'Who made this plan?' The king said, 'Tian Wen [Lord Mengchang] made it!' and the great ministers thereupon... drove Tian Wen from the state.\\" At the end of his reign, after King Min had angered even his own generals who were defending Qi, his capital city of Linzi was invaded and sacked in 284 BC. by General Yue Yi of Yan, partly at the instigation of King Min's advisor Su Qin. \\"The army of Yan entered the capital...fighting with each other over the great quantity of bronze stored in the treasury.\\" The king fled to Ju, which along with Jimo was one of the only two Qi cities that remained unoccupied.Cambridge History of Ancient China, page 628 All but two cities of Qi were conquered. Even after his defeat, King Min never blamed himself; he agreed with an obsequious advisor who said, \\"Your majesty had the title of Sovereign of the East and in fact controlled the world. You left your state to live in Wey with a manner that expressed complete satisfaction.\\" But the king was then captured, and his former minister, Nao Chi (淖齒), of Chu, confronted the king: \\" 'For hundreds of miles about your districts... garments have been wet with blood.... Did the king know this?' 'I did not.'... 'Can such a person remain unpunished?' cried Nao Chi and executed King Min in the drum-square at Ju.\\" Another account says Nao Chi \\"bound King Min by his joints and suspended him from a beam in the ancestral temple. There the king hung all night and died the next day.\\" He is often cited in literature as a warning example of a ruler who would not listen to good advisors but believed bad ones. \\"This is the reason Qi was defeated on the banks of the Ji River The Ji River and the country of Qi became a wasteland....King Min died as a result of his arrogance over the greatness of Qi.\\" Nao Chi was killed by one of King Min's followers, Wangsun Jia, who with Tian Dan then reconquered the seventy cities of Qi, found Tian Fazhang 田法章, King Min's son, who had \\"cast off his robes of royalty and fled to the house of the king's astrologer where he worked as a gardener\\", and set him on the throne (King Xiang of Qi). Qi never regained its power. However, it survived as a kingdom and was the last independent land to succumb to the unification of China under Qin Shi Huang in 221 BC.

Description Vinciguerria attenuata is a moderately elongate fish with a tapering body growing to a length of about . The eyes are slightly tubular and set close together, giving vision both upwards and sideways. The mouth is large, with a single row of teeth, some long and some short. The dorsal fin has 13 to 15 soft rays and is set in front of a small adipose fin (a small fleshy fin without supporting rays). The pectoral fins have 9 to 10 soft rays, the pelvic fins 6 to 7 and the anal fin 13 to 16. There are photophores (light-producing organs) on the lower half of the head and in rows on the underside of the fish. The dorsal surface of the body is dark, the flanks are silvery and the fins are colourless, without streaks. Distribution and habitat V. attenuata is found in the warmer parts of the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea, and also the Indian Ocean and much of the Pacific Ocean, between about 48°N and 57°S. It is mainly a mesopelagic fish, making short diel vertical migrations, remaining at depths of between about during the day and rising to between at night. Both adults and juveniles are commonly caught between . The pre-metamorphic larvae are found at a similar depth, but during metamorphosis, the larvae descend to between . Ecology The diet of V. attenuata consists of planktonic organisms, particularly crustaceans such as copepods. The sexes are separate and breeding takes place throughout the year, but mostly in spring and summer. Both eggs and larvae form part of the plankton. The larvae undergo metamorphosis when about long and it is at this time that the photophores develop.

People, to a lesser extent, call the area Egypt Bottom. The area encompasses the northwest corner of Belmont County. Morristown and Hendrysburg are on the southern edges of the area, while Holloway and Flushing are on the northern edge of the area. The southern end of Piedmont Lake, the opposite end of the dam in Piedmont, juts into the northern pocket of the area as well.http://www.mwcd.org/places/reservoirs/piedmont-reservoir  Coal mining  Before the area became a sporting destination, it was surface-mined. Egypt Valley was home to some of the largest earth moving machines, most notably the GEM of Egypt, and the less known Mountaineer. The high walls and unique look to the area was the end-result of this mining method. Most coal extraction ceased in the early 1990s. Folklore Aside from the coal mining in the area, Egypt Valley is known for its rich tradition of local folklore. The Salem Cemetery, located in the middle of the area, is home to the grave of Louiza Fox, who was murdered in 1869. Her murderer, Thomas Carr, was the first person hanged in Belmont County.http://www.forgottenoh.com/Egypt/salem.html Louiza Fox was a thirteen-year-old girl working as a servant for Alex Hunter, the owner of a coal mine. Thomas Carr, 22 years old, worked for Hunter at his mine. Fox and Carr began dating. Initially, Fox's parents approved of the couple, and even gave their consent for the two to be engaged. After learning more about Carr's violent past, however, the girl's parents retracted their approval of the engagement. Carr became instantly angry upon hearing this news, and plotted the murder of his fiancée. Carr waited behind a fence on a path that Fox frequently traveled. When the girl went for a walk with her brother, Carr met up with them and sent her brother back home. Carr then slit the throat of his love and stabbed her fourteen times. He then threw her in a ditch and fled the scene. Fox's brother, who watched the entire thing, informed his parents immediately. The family sent out a search party and eventually found Thomas Carr with wounds from his suicide attempt. He attempted to slit his throat and shoot himself in the head, but failed and was taken into custody and nursed back to health.http://www.forgottenoh.com/Egypt/egypt.html Several days after the murder, Carr admitted to killing Fox, along with thirteen other people and laughed at his sentencing, saying “he did not care a damn if it was to be tomorrow.” Louiza was buried in Salem cemetery, where there have been reports of the girl weeping at her grave. She and Carr both are said roam the land of Egypt Valley and also have been seen at the site of Louiza's murder. Hunting and fishing Egypt Valley, a popular regional outdoor destination, offers many small, mainly isolated, strip pit ponds, creeks, and backwaters to explore, hunt, and fish.

It does this through a release valve that is incorporated within the cylinder head that vents the cylinder pressure to the outside atmosphere until the engine has sufficient momentum to overcome it. At that point the valve closes and the ignition is engaged. Motorcycles Early large displacement motorcycles provided riders with a manual control for this when kick starters were used while later models linked them to the kick lever through a cable for automatic operation. Though it only uses electric start, not kick start, the 2012 Ducati 1199 uses a compression release, which is automatically activated at low engine speed by a centrifugal flyweight on each exhaust cam. This reduces the work of cranking the high 12.5:1 compression ratio engine, allowing a smaller battery and smaller starter motor, for a total weight savings of . From the mid-1960s to the late-1970s, engine compression-releases were also used to supplement rear- wheel braking on many two-stroke engine powered motorcycles, primarily those used off-road or for various types of dirt-track racing, such as motocross and flat-tracking. Since two-stroke engines normally lack the compression braking effect of four-stroke engines when the throttle is shut off, the addition of a compression release brake on two-strokes essentially mimicked the four-stroke compression braking effect. Using throttle-off engine compression for at least some braking on both two-stroke and four stroke motorcycles was especially important during that era, since most motorcycles used drum-brakes, which would wear-out much more quickly than modern disc brakes. Diesel engines Small diesel engines may be fitted with compression release valves if they are to be started by hand cranking.

Early life and education  Born in New Orleans, Jackson earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Xavier University of Louisiana in 1982 and a Juris Doctor in 1985 from Southern University Law Center. He also earned a Master of Laws degree in international and comparative law from Georgetown University Law Center in 2000.  Professional career  After graduating from law school in 1985, Jackson took a job as a general attorney for the Los Angeles office of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service. He served in that capacity until 1987, when he moved to Washington, D.C. to serve as an Assistant General Counsel for the INS. In 1988, Jackson left INS and returned to New Orleans, taking a job in the United States Attorney's office for the Eastern District of Louisiana, where he worked first as a Special Assistant United States Attorney and then, from 1990 until 1992, as an Assistant United States Attorney. From 1992 until 1994, Jackson worked in the Executive Office for United States Attorneys in the United States Department of Justice, serving as the Assistant Director for the Evaluation and Review staff. From 1994 until 2002, Jackson worked in the United States Attorney's office for the Middle District of Louisiana, serving as a First Assistant United States Attorney and then in 2001 as an interim United States Attorney for the Middle District of Louisiana. During that tenure, Jackson also was detailed to Washington from 1998 until 1999 to work in the office of the United States Deputy Attorney General, serving as an Associate Deputy Attorney General. From 2002 until 2010, Jackson worked as a partner for Liskow & Lewis, a law firm with offices in New Orleans, Lafayette, and Houston.  Federal judicial service  In January 2009, United States Senator Mary Landrieu approached Jackson and encouraged him to become a United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In April 2009, Landrieu notified Jackson that she was proceeding with recommending the incumbent United States Attorney, Jim Letten, remain in place, but that given Jackson's many years in the federal courts that she believed him to be well-qualified to serve as a district judge. Soon afterward, Landrieu formally recommended that President Barack Obama nominate Jackson to the seat. On October 29, 2009, Obama formally nominated Jackson to fill the vacancy, which was created when Judge Frank Joseph Polozola took senior status in 2007. Jackson's nomination was delayed for months due to a dispute between Landrieu and fellow United States Senator David Vitter, but eventually Vitter approved of the nomination and a hearing was held before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary. The Senate confirmed Jackson on June 15, 2010 in a 96–0 vote. He received his commission the same day. On July 18, 2011, he became Chief Judge of the court, upon the death of Ralph E.

The Texas folk song, \\"John Gardner's Trail Herd\\", described Gardner as a man who \\"would meet you on the square\\" and that he was the \\"biggest cow - thief\\" that ever roamed. Gardner's reputation as an outlaw is controversial, but he had been a Texas Ranger for three years. A neighbor described him as \\"big\\" and \\"hairy\\", and man who was kind and never allowed anyone to run over him. John Gardner died in 1926 from natural causes in El Paso, Texas.

Early life Siva Shankar was born 28 January 1949, to Narayana Sharma and Vijayalakshmi in the Alangayam village, near Vaniyambadi in the North Arcot district (now comes under Vellore district) of Tamil Nadu. He went to the University of Madras, completing his chemistry and post graduations in the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (London), the Indian Institute of Road Transport (Pune) and the Institute of Rail Transport (Delhi). Career In 1978, Balamurugan Swami of Ratnagiri Temple asked Siva Shankar to start his own business. While this had not been Siva Shankar's plan for himself, he decided to follow his Guru's guidance. Between 1978 and 1983, Siva Shankar's business profits increased, and he was employed as a transport fleet owner & contractor, stock distributor, and a documentary commercial producer. He was on the management faculty of A.M. Jain Institute of Management, and was the founder Director of Madras Institute of Transport Technology. As a highly qualified management professional, he was involved with various government committees and the program of study committee of Anna University. He participated in various symposiums and seminars and presented several commendable papers on Management. He was also the President of The Madras Goods transport association, Managing committee member of Andhra Chamber of Commerce, Chartered Secretary of Rotary Club – Anna Nagar, IRTDA (Jakarta), Institute of Transport and Traffic Engineers, and several other organisations. Spiritual Interest Siva Shankar was always interested in religion and spirituality, devoting a large portion of his time travelling to different religious and holy places, visiting temples, meeting renowned saints and religious leaders (ex. Ratnagiri Swami Balamurugan Adimai of Vellore, Kanchi Mahaa Periavaal, Koti Swamy etc.). He has been on yearly pilgrimages to Sabarimala since 1968. In January 1983, after business establishments, Siva Shankar installed a Lord Ayyappa idol in his Chennai bungalow, worshipping him ever since. In May 1983, Kanchi Kamakoti Jayendra Saraswathi Swami visited Siva Shankar's bungalow, performed pooja to the idol, and said, 'This Ayyappa idol here is very powerful. Why don't you construct a temple for Him?' Siva Shankar said that at first, he didn't take the words seriously, but in November 1983, he discussed with Balamurugan Swami the construction of the Ayyappa temple. Balamurugan Swami advised Siva Shankar to construct a temple in the southwest corner of his bungalow. With the guidance of Sambhamoorthy Sivachariar (Head Gurukkal of the Kalikambal temple on Thambu Chetty Street, Chennai), and Swami Ramdas of Thiruverkadu, a temple was constructed and a Kumbabhishekam was done 13–15 December 1983. After the Kumbabhishekam, Siva Shankar visited Sabarimala. It is reported that he had darshan of Lord Ayyappa there on 16 January 1984. Around the same time, in Agastya Ashram at Palghat, Kalasa Abhishekam was done with the chanting of Shyamala Kanaka Sankarshini Maha mantra to Siva Shankar by the priest Nochur Swami. Vidhwan Lakshmanan, an astrologer, gave Ganapathi Mantra Upadesham to Siva Shankar, as per his guru's (Brighu Rishi) command. Spiritual Encounters On 26 January 1984, Siva Shankar was present at an annual Abhishekam for Lord Muruga of Ratnagiri temple, crying continuously for over an hour. Balamurugan Swami then wrote a note to Siva Shankar: “Within this month-end there will be a welcome turning point in your life. God’s blessings”. After reaching Chennai, that same night, (in the early hours, c. 3:30 AM) Siva Shankar reported that Raghavendra Swami of Mantralaya appeared physically before him, giving him a vision of his own dead body, by separating the body from the soul (out-of-body experience). This was the same experience Venkatraman had before he became Bala Ramana Maharishi. This experience is also predicted in the Siva Shankar's Sahadeva Nadi, which says \\"The body and soul were separated and the soul saw the body.” Siva Shankar soon had another experience in which a snake originated from him, stood left of Lord Muruga, and vanished to become a seer with a golden face, saying, \\"For every full moon, Eight Rupees, Eleven Full Moons, Swaminatha Venkateswara, Swaminatha Venkateswara, Swaminatha Venkateswara.\\" This vision indicated that Siva Shankar was to receive Ashta Maha Siddhis (In the language of Siddhas, eight rupees means Ashta Maha Siddhis.) within eleven full moon days, with the mantras of Sadakshara (Swaminatha) and Ashtakshara (Venkateswara). Following this, Siva Shankar went to Thiruvannamalai every full moon, experiencing and receiving various Siddhis as was ordained in his earlier experiences. During the Guru Purnimas in 1984, Siva Shankar was physically blessed by Yogi Ram Surat Kumar, God Child of Thiruvannamalai. Yogi Ram Surat Kumar gave Siva Shankar mantras of Rama and Krishna and blessed him. Ever since, Siva Shankar's interest in the world has declined and he has taken spirituality as his path in life. Having visited almost every temple and sacred worship place in India, featured articles of him chronicle his eleven visits to Mount Kailash and his seventy visits to Sabarimala. His accessibility, care and compassion for those who reach out to him, touch many people. He does not harbor anger or hatred. All he has is love, only love. He does not discriminate based on religion, caste, creed, gender or age. He has summed up Bhagavad Gita in four words: \\"Flow along with life.\\", and to those who ask him how to deal with life's \\"ups and downs\\", he answers \\"I will take care\\". People undergo many pleasant experiences after investing faith in him, proving that he does \\"take care\\". His concept is \\"Aham Brahmasmi Tattavamasi\\" (\\"I am God and so are you\\"). Most so-called problems are fabrications of the mind, which does not understand your innate divinity. Once you know that you are a divine spirit in a human form, you go beyond \\"problems\\". Siva Shankar asserts \\"First be aware of the world you live in, establish yourself here through hard work without compromising on your values and that by itself becomes your worship to the Lord. Arise, awake, work, worship\\". His life is his message. His Satsang talks offer ways we can deal with life. In this world heavily laden with strife, his is a shoulder one can lean on and know comfort. He is also one of the only spiritual teachers that uses email, usually responding within 24 hours (except when on pilgrimages.) Samratchana Ashram Siva Shankar Baba established a [social, cultural, spiritual centre for self-realization, model for universal family] known as Samratchana in Chennai. Samratchana, Sree Ramarajya is a non-profit center which also offers classes for cartoon animation, embroidery, textile painting, typing shorthand, tailoring, foreign languages, music, dance, journalism and screen printing. The center also offers free food from 11a.m. to 4p.m. and computer classes at relatively low cost. Samratchana has two villages, Vengaleri and Alathur, near Thiruporur Tamil Nadu, and provides facilities like free education and medical care. Siva Shankar is the pioneer of Sree Ramarajya, (a secular commune housing 400 families), a Hindu temple, church, mosque, Buddha Vihar, and a Jain temple. He is also the founder of Sushil Hari International Residential School, (located in Sree Ramarajya Kelambakkam), Praveena Hospitals (rendering free medical service to the rural needy and nominally charged services to others), and many free medical camps.

The treaty put an end to the fighting between forces supporting Madero and those of Díaz and thus concluded the initial phase of the Mexican Revolution. The treaty stipulated that Díaz, as well as his vice president Ramón Corral, were to step down by the end of May, and that he was to be replaced by Francisco León de la Barra as interim president and hold presidential elections. Those who had suffered losses due to the revolution would be indemnified, and there would be a general amnesty.Charles C. Cumberland, Mexican Revolution: Genesis Under Madero. Austin: University of Texas Press 1952, p. 150.Katz, Friedrich (1998): The Life and Times of Pancho Villa Stanford University Press, pgs 104–119. Díaz resigned on May 25, and interim president Francisco León de la Barra was the new incumbent. Díaz and his family, his vice president Corral, plus José Yves Limantour and Rosendo Pineda left Mexico for exile.Cumberland, Mexican Revolution p. 150.Gonzales, Michael J. (2002): The Mexican Revolution, 1910–1940 UNM Press, pgs 76, 80–84 Significantly, the treaty did not mention or institute any social reforms that Madero had vaguely promised on previous occasions. It also left the Porfirian state essentially intact. Additionally, Madero supported the unpopular idea that all land disputes were to be settled through the courts, staffed by the old judges, a decision that led to outbreaks of sporadic violence, particularly in rural areas. On June 7, 1911, Madero entered Mexico City. In October 1911 he was elected president, under the banner of the Partido Constitucional Progresista, along with José María Pino Suárez, his new running mate as vice-president. Madero pushed aside Francisco Vázquez Gómez, the vice presidential candidate for the Anti- Reelectionist Party in 1910, as being too moderate.Keen, Benjamin and Haynes, Keith (2008): A History of Latin America: Independence to the Present Cengage Learning, pg 315Mark Wasserman, \\"Francisco Vázquez Gómez\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico, vol. 2, pl 1522. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997. Military developments leading up to the treaty The rebellion against the government of Porfirio Díaz broke out in late 1910, after Díaz had rival Francisco I. Madero imprisoned and had announced his own victory in a falsified election. Madero's earlier vague promises of agrarian reforms had attracted many supporters. He himself escaped from prison and fled to Texas, from where he issued his famous Plan of San Luis Potosí. This manifesto called for an armed uprising against the Porfiriato and establishment of free and democratic elections. As a response to Madero's proclamation, violent clashes began throughout Mexico in November 1910.Navarro, Armando (2009): The Immigration Crisis: Nativism, Armed Vigilantism, and the Rise of the Countervailing Movement AltaMira Press, pgs 47–48 Battle of Ciudad Juárez. Madero is seated in center, Orozco on the far right and Villa is standing on the far left. In the Guerrero district of Chihuahua, Pascual Orozco attacked federal troops and sent dead soldiers' clothing back to Díaz with the message, \\"Ahí te van las hojas, mándame más tamales\\" (\\"Here are the wrappers, send me more tamales.\\")Martin Donell Kohout, \\"Orozco, Pascual, Jr.\\", The Handbook of Texas Online, Texas Historical Association, last accessed 16 June 2010 He then began operations that threatened Ciudad Juárez. Additionally, political support for Madero's rebellion came from Gov. Abraham González, who accepted the Plan of San Luis Potosí. At roughly the same time, agrarian unrest in the state of Morelos turned into a full-blown rebellion under the leadership of the Zapata brothers, Emiliano and Eufemio. Orozco and Villa take Ciudad Juárez Ciudad Juárez lies on the border between Mexico and the United States. Its location played a significant role in the battle for the city and concerns that the US might intervene delayed Madero's and the rebels' attack. Encouraged by the news of the uprisings, Madero crossed the border back into Mexico in February 1911. He was joined by Pancho Villa and Orozco and in April the army began approaching Ciudad Juárez. Orozco and Villa led the way with 500 men each, while Madero followed up with 1,500 riders. The city was besieged by the end of the month, after Madero's army encountered some resistance in the Chihuahuan countryside. Madero asked the commander of the city's garrison to surrender but the latter refused, hoping that the fortifications he had constructed would allow him to defend the city until reinforcements arrived. Concerned also with the possibility that a direct attack on the town would cause artillery shells to cross the border into the United States, which could provoke an outside intervention, and faced with a series of peace proposals from Díaz, Madero hesitated in attacking the city. He in fact ordered his commanders to lift the siege.Scheina, Robert L. (2003): Latin America's Wars: The Age of the Professional Soldier, 1900–2000 Brassey's, pg 15 Orozco, however disregarded the order and, joined by Villa, attacked. After two days of fighting the city fell to the insurrectionists. Madero intervened personally to spare the life of the city's commander, Gen. Navarro, whom both Orozco and Villa wanted executed for his previous killing of rebel POWs. This, coupled with the fact that both leaders were ignored by Madero in his political appointments, outraged and estranged them from him. Zapata in south and central Mexico Emiliano Zapata and his staff together with Gen. Manuel Asúnsolo and revolutionary Gov. Abraham González in Cuernavaca in April 1911. At about the same time that Villa and Orozco were marching on Ciudad Juárez, the Zapatista revolt gathered strength and spread to the states of Puebla, Tlaxcala, Mexico, Michoacán and Guerrero. On April 14 Madero had Emiliano Zapata officially designated as his representative in the region.McLynn, Frank (2002): Villa and Zapata: A History of the Mexican Revolution Carroll & Graf Publishers, pgs 92–95 However, Zapata was worried that if he did not fully control all the major towns in Morelos by the time Madero concluded negotiations with Díaz, the demands of his agrarian movement and the issue of the autonomy of Morelos would be ignored or sidelined. Zapata's first military action was to take the town of Chinameca, where he obtained essential supplies.Krauze, Enrique (1998): Mexico: Biography of Power: a History of Modern Mexico, 1810–1996 Harper Collins, pgs 283–285 Subsequently, Zapata, for political and strategic reasons, decided to attack the city of Cuautla. In order to mislead his opponents, however, he initially attacked and captured the towns of Izúcar de Matamoros (which was subsequently retaken by federal forces) and Chietla. From there he made a wide circle around Cuautla and captured Yautepec and Jonacatepec, where he gathered more supplies, munitions and soldiers. By May, out of all the major urban centers in the region, only Cuautla and the capital of Morelos, Cuernavaca, remained outside his control. Zapata began the attack on Cuautla on May 13 with 4000 troops against 400 elite soldiers of the so-called \\"Golden Fifth\\"; the Fifth Cavalry Regiment of the Federal Army. The battle took almost a week and has been described as \\"six of the most terrible days of battle in the whole Revolution\\". It consisted of house-to-house fighting, hand-to-hand combat and no quarter given by either side. Gen. Victoriano Huerta arrived in nearby Cuernavaca with 600 reinforcements but decided not to come to the relief of Cuautla, as he was afraid that the capital would revolt in his absence. On May 19 the remains of the \\"Golden Fifth\\" pulled out of the town, which was then occupied by Zapata's soldiers. The successful capture of Cuautla made Zapata a hero to ordinary people throughout Mexico and new corridos were written about him. After Zapata's taking of Cuautla the federal government controlled only five states and some urban areas. Porfirio Díaz himself later stated that, while he felt he could defend against Villa and Orozco in Chihuahua, the fall of Cuautla was the event that persuaded him to agree to peace with Madero. Compromise José Yves Limantour, Díaz's advisor who encouraged him to step down from the Presidency. As early as March 1911 Madero's representatives met in New York with Díaz's finance minister, José Yves Limantour, and the Mexican ambassador to the US in order to discuss the possibility of peace between the two sides. Limantour proposed an end to hostilities and offered an amnesty for all revolutionaries, the resignation of the then-vice president Ramón Corral, the replacement of four Díaz cabinet ministers and ten state governors by ones chosen by Madero and the establishment of the principle of \\"no-reelection\\", which would prevent Díaz from seeking yet another term as president (which would have been his ninth). Madero responded positively, although he also stated that any kind of peace deal had to include an immediate resignation by Díaz. Faced with the siege of Ciudad Juárez and the outbreak of rebellion in Morelos, Díaz and members of his cabinet became more willing to negotiate and launched a \\"skillful peace offensive\\" aimed at Madero. This was largely a result of panic among the large landowners associated with the Díaz regime (the hacendados) and the financial elite, which represented a \\"moderate\\" wing within the government. Some among the Porfiristas, in fact, expected that Zapata would soon march on Mexico City itself, unless peace was concluded with Madero. The moderate view within the Díaz government was represented by Jorge Vera Estañol, who in a memo to the minister of foreign affairs wrote that there were two revolutions taking place in Mexico: a political revolution, based mostly in the north whose main aim was to establish free elections and remove Díaz himself from power, and a social revolution whose aim was \\"anarchy\\", which was spreading throughout the countryside. Estañol recommended coming to terms with the first group of revolutionaries by agreeing to the principle of no re-election and a general amnesty, in order to prevent the second group from succeeding. In addition to his fear of \\"anarchy\\", Estañol was also worried that the social revolution would lead to a military intervention by the United States. Estañol's views represented those of the portion of the upper class which was willing to come to terms with at least a portion of the middle class in order to crush the peasant uprisings, as exemplified by those of Zapata, which were erupting throughout Mexico. Limantour, who broadly agreed with Estañol, had the support of the Mexican financiers, who feared the downgrading of Mexican international credit and a general economic crisis as a result of ongoing social unrest, as well as that of the large landowners who were willing to come to terms with Madero if it would put an end to the agrarian uprisings. These social group were in turn opposed by the more reactionary elements within Díaz's government, mostly concentrated in the Federal Army, who thought that the rebels should be dealt with through brute force. This faction was represented by Gen. Victoriano Huerta, who would later carry out an attempted coup d'état against Madero. Likewise, Gen.--and potential successor to Díaz--Bernardo Reyes stated in a letter to Limantour that \\"the repression [against the insurrectionists] should be carried out with the greatest energy, punishing without any pity anyone participating in the armed struggle\\". In the end, however, Díaz dismissed the advice from his generals as \\"Custer-like bluster\\" and chose to seek peace with the moderate wing of the revolution. Limantour had finally managed to persuade him to resign. Porfirio Díaz on horseback in 1910 or 1911. At the same time there was also disagreement among the rebels. The \\"left wing\\" of the revolutionary movement, represented by Zapata and Orozco (Villa, for the time being, tended to support Madero), warned against any possible compromises with Díaz. In the end their suspicions proved correct, as the treaty that was eventually signed neglected issues of social and agrarian land reform that were central to their struggle. Interim president Francisco León de la Barra. Treaty's terms The most significant point of the treaty was that Porfirio Díaz, and his vice president, Ramón Corral, resign and that Francisco León de la Barra, acting as Interim President, organize free elections as soon as possible. Additionally, the treaty stipulated that: #An amnesty for all revolutionaries be declared, with the option for some of them to apply for membership in the rurales.Miller, Robert Ryal (1989): Mexico: A History University of Oklahoma Press, pg 289 #The revolutionary forces were to be demobilized as soon as possible and the federal forces were to be the only army in Mexico. This was in order to appease the army, which had opposed a compromise with Madero. #Madero and his supporters had the right to name 14 provisional state governors and to approve De la Barra's cabinet. #Pensions were to be established for relatives of soldiers who had died fighting the rebels. #Policemen and judges, as well as state legislators, that had been appointed or \\"elected\\" under Díaz were to retain their offices. Implementation and results The treaty was signed on May 21. Díaz resigned accordingly on May 25. Francisco de la Barra became the interim president. Madero entered Mexico City on June 7. Zapata, however, refused to recognize the interim government of de la Barra, and for the time being the fighting in Morelos continued. Madero met with Zapata on several occasions during June. While initially Zapata trusted Madero, with time he became increasingly concerned that the goals of \\"his revolution\\" were not being fulfilled. He was particularly angry that Madero did not plan on carrying out any kind of agrarian reform, or the breakup of large haciendas. Additionally, the press in Mexico City--controlled by the landowners--began referring to Zapata as a bandit and federal generals, such as Huerta, continued attacking his troops under the pretext that Zapata failed to demobilize in violation of the treaty. Sporadic fighting in southern Mexico continued. In November 1911, shortly after Madero's inauguration, Zapata issued the famous Plan of Ayala, in which the Zapatistas denounced Madero and instead recognized Pascual Orozco as the rightful president and leader of the revolution.Joseph, Gilbert Michael and Henderson, Timothy J. (2002): The Mexico Reader: History, Culture, Politics Duke University Press, pgs 339–341 Porfirio Díaz's letter of resignation. Madero also incurred the great displeasure of other revolutionaries, including Pascual Orozco. Madero's first act after the treaty was signed was a gesture of reconciliation with the Díaz regime. As a result of the treaty he was given the right to appoint members of the la Barra cabinet. He chose mostly upper- class Maderistas, including his wife for the post in the treasury. He also maintained the existing federal system by keeping the sitting judges of the Supreme Court, the legislators in federal and state assemblies and the bureaucrats of the various federal agencies. Venustiano Carranza, who was going to become a major revolutionary in his own right and a future president of Mexico, stated that, after the treaty, Madero had \\"deliver[ed] to the reactionaries a dead revolution which will have to be fought over again\\". Díaz, after leaving for exile in France, observed that \\"Madero has unleashed a tiger, let us see if he can control him\\". Orozco, who saw himself as being instrumental in Madero's victory over Díaz, was merely appointed a commander of the rurales in Chihuahua, which increased his resentment.Camin, Héctor Aguilar and Meyer, Lorenzo (1993): In the Shadow of the Mexican Revolution: Contemporary Mexican History, 1910–1989 University of Texas Press, pgs 27–28 When he tried to run for governor of the state, Madero supported his opponent, Abraham González, and eventually pressured Orozco to drop out of the race. When, in the aftermath of the Plan of Ayala, Madero ordered Orozco to lead federal troops to suppress Zapata, Orozco refused. In March 1912 Orozco issued his Plan of Empacadora and formally declared himself in rebellion against Madero.

He is best known as the lead vocalist of the Spanish pop rock band Hombres G. Early and personal life Summers was born in the Chamberí district of Madrid, Spain, to Manuel Summers Rivero, a Spanish film director and screenwriter of English descent, and Consuelo Rodríguez Marquez on 26 February 1964. Summers married Marta Madruga on 18 January 1992 and they're the parents of twins, Daniel and Lucía, born in 2000. Madruga played the role of Summers' girlfriend in the 1987 film Sufre Mamón and it is speculated that she is the subject of such songs as \\"Marta tiene un marcapasos\\". Musical career=The band When David was in his late teens, he and three other friends formed a group by the name of \\"Los Residuos\\". After that project was abandoned, Summers, Dani Mezquita, and Javi Molina formed a second group called \\"La Burguesía Revolucionaria\\". However, the three alone were not successful. Summers then met Rafael Gutierrez in 1982 while they were both conducting business at Television Española (TVE) and the two became friends. Rafa accepted David's invitation to join the rest of the group and they renamed themselves \\"Hombres G\\" after the 1935 James Cagney movie, G Men (which in Spain aired as Contra el imperio del crimen). Summers' songwriting lead and the newly launched label, Producciones Twins, helped the quartet establish a successful music career. The group's early work encompassed a juvenile and goofy nature, which set them apart as a distinct musical act. Releasing seven albums and two movies through the year 1992, the group became one of the most popular Spanish groups of the 1980s – evident by strong sales and a responsive fan community. The group split in 1993 but reconvened in 2002 to tour America and Spain. To this day, Hombres G continue to release new material. Solo career David pursued a solo career after Hombres G broke up in 1993. The only member to remain actively involved in the recording of music, Summers released three studio albums and one live album. The recording of his first album, David Summers (1994) concurred with the death of his father, and for that reason Summers dedicated the album to him. Most of his solo work has been described as romantic, deep and melodious. Summers has composed for the likes of Luz Casal and Presuntos Implicados. In 2017 he released a collaboration with Aleks Syntek with the remake of the single El ataque de las chicas cocodrilo. Discography=As a member of Hombres G * Hombres G (1985) * La cagaste...

South Africa denied the allegations, saying it would \\"at no time authorize and would not authorize attacks on Zambian villages.\\" It also criticised the Security Council for passing condemnations without engaging with the country, \\"We need communication. We do not need exacerbation\\" according to South African representative Pik Botha.

Hobbs credits his sense of audience to his fourteen years of teaching reading and English in southwest Colorado. When he turned to writing, he set his stories mostly in wild places he knew from firsthand experience. Hobbs has said he wants to “take young people into the outdoors and engage their sense of wonder.” Bearstone, his second novel, gained national attention when it took the place of Where the Red Fern Grows as the unabridged novel in Prentice-Hall’s 7th grade literature anthology. Downriver and Far North were selected by the American Library Association for its list of the 100 Best Young Adult Books of the 20th century. As of 2020, all twenty-two of Hobbs’ books are in print, and all the novels are available in unabridged audio editions. Biography William Carl Hobbs grew up in an Air Force family and was raised in Panama, Virginia, Alaska, northern California, southern California, and Texas. He was the middle child of five born to Mary Ann (Rhodes) Hobbs and Gregory J. Hobbs. “During the years we were living in Alaska,” Hobbs has written, “I fell in love with mountains, rivers, fishing, baseball, and books.” He graduated from Stanford University with a B.A. in English in 1969. His M.A. in English from Stanford followed in 1971. He and his wife, Jean, were married in December, 1972. Drawn by the San Juan Mountains to southwestern Colorado, they found teaching jobs in Pagosa Springs. After four years they resettled in the Durango area, where Hobbs taught for ten years at Miller Junior High. Summers he devoted to writing, backpacking, and rowing his whitewater raft through the canyons of the Southwest. Hobbs rowed ten trips down the Grand Canyon. In 1990 he began writing full-time. His professional travels have taken him to 47 states, Canada, and Germany, where six of his novels have been published in the German language.

Ben-Ari gained national fame for his analysis of the Israeli information technology and Information- Security market which have been published widely in the printed and broadcast media, as well as for his active role as the co-founder and spokesman for the Israeli chapter of Mensa.

It has mostly smooth bark, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three, white flowers and cup-shaped, bell-shaped or hemispherical fruit.G.Philips - NSW Herbariumflower budsfruit  Description  Eucalyptus imlayensis is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth bark that is shed in ribbons, curling over near the base. The bark is green when fresh, ageing to orange, brown then grey. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross-section with wings on the corners. Juvenile leaves are mostly arranged in opposite pairs, sessile, elliptic to egg-shaped, long and wide. Adult leaves are quite thick, veiny, lance-shaped or curved, the same glossy green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of three on an unbranched peduncle long, the buds sessile. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical to slightly beaked operculum. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped, bell-shaped or hemispherical capsule long and wide and sessile with a prominent disc and the valves protruding beyond the rim of the fruit.A Field Guide to Eucalypts - Brooker & Kleinig volume 1, page 210 Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus imlayensis was first formally described in 1980 by Michael Crisp and Ian Brooker from a specimen collected on Mount Imlay in 1978 and the description was published in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet imlayensis is from the type location on Mount Imlay. This eucalypt is placed in the subgenus Symphyomyrtus, section Maidenaria, along with E. johnstonii, E. subcrenulata and E. vernicosa. Distribution and habitat The Mount Imlay mallee grows in mossy shrubland dominated by tea tree on a steep quartzite outcrop and is only known from the Mount Imlay National Park. Other nearby species include the rare Imlay boronia, devil's twine, digger's speedwell, Tasmanian flax-lily, rasp fern, spiny-head mat-rush, scented paperbark, common shaggy pea and blotchy mint-bush. The ground layer is dominated by mosses. The soils are poor in nutrient, based from sandstone and conglomerate rocks. (other publication details, included in citation) (NOTE: this is a description of the rocks at the rainforest, 250 metres to the south) Conservation status Eucalyptus imlayensis is listed as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"critically endangered\\" under the New South Wales Government Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. The main threats to the species are its small population size in a single location, damage by gall-forming psyllids and lack of seedling recruitment. Dieback caused by the fungus Phytophthora cinnamomi and habitat modification caused by fire are potential threats. The population of mature trees was estimated to be about 80 in 2007.

Biography He was born in Dooega, Achill Island, in the County Mayo gaeltacht, one of a family of fourteen children. Irish was his first language. Patten emigrated to England as a teenager, working in Blackpool and London. In London he became involved with the Republican Congress, a socialist republican group. In October 1936, after the outbreak of the war in Spain, Patten left England to travel to Spain on his own, before the formation of the International Brigades. Upon his arrival in Madrid, he enlisted in the militia to assist in the defence of the city from insurgent fascist forces during the Siege of Madrid. He was killed at Boadilla del Monte on the night of 16/17 December 1936, the first person from an English-speaking country and the first Irishman of 74 killed in the conflict. Peadar O'Donnell was the one who informed Patten's parents of his death. Years later dedicated his memoir of the war, Salud!, to \\"a young Achill boy\\". A monument was raised to Patten in his native Dooega in 1984, funded by George Harrison, an Irish Republican also from Mayo. A ceremony was held to marked the creation of the momentum. 400 people where in attendance, included surviving members of the Patten family, the then chairman of the Labour Party Senator Michael D Higgins, a former president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions Andy Barr; the general secretary of the Communist Party of Ireland, Jimmy Stewart, and the Northern Ireland Secretary of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers’ Union, Ernie McBride.

The 122 episode TV dramaserial was aired on NTV and the last episode was aired on July 23, 2009. The drama serial has an urban setting of the modern Dhaka, depicting colourful and interesting lifestyles of some families living in Dhaka. This drama stars Abul Hayat, Sohel Khan, Shumon Patowary, Mosharraf Karim, Monira Mithu, Siddiqur Rahman, Sumaiya Shimu, Rafiath Rashid Mithila, Hasan Masood,Mishu Sabbir, Adnan Faruque Hillol, Zillur Rahman, Ishtiak Ahmed Rumel, Marzuk Russell, Maznun Mizan, Nova, Sadia Jahan Prova, Aparna Ghosh, Mozeza Ashraf Monalisa and Srabosti Dutta Tinni Plot Housefull revolves around the lives of two neighbours, both named Ikramul Haq. Barring the name, the duo share nothing in common. One is an architect and another one is a developer. The architect Ikramul Haq (Abul Hayat) is an environmentalist, while the builder Ikramul Haq (Sohel Khan) has no qualms about cutting down trees if they impinge on his work. The other characters in the play are architect Ikramul Haq's elder daughter Shimu (Sumaiya Shimu), who is a student of chemistry. His younger daughter Mithila (Mithila), who is a student of physics while the youngest son Mishu, an urban man who studies in a private university. Also dwelling in his house is his wife, Mithu (Monira Mithu) who is a very aggressive though caring character. His wife also has a brother, Ifti (Mosharraf Karim), living in the house, and also in the same room with the brother of Ikramul Haq himself, called Shumon (Shumon Patowary). Ifti is a nice person, but can be very irritating at times, and he has a tendency of teasing Shumon, who has a concerning weight problem. This is the full family of architect Ikramul Haq, and they live very happily together, besides tolerating some quarrels of the next door neighbours. On the other hand, the builder Ikramul Haq never married, as he holds on to the memories of a woman, Sharmeen (Sharmeen Sheila), he loved and lost. He lives with a nephew of his, and his name is Siddique (Siddiqur Rahman). Siddique is a happy going person who always has a smile on his face and loves his uncle dearly. Another character is Hasan (Hasan Masood). He is madly in love with his girlfriend Faria, and plans to marry to her, and they both agree to it. The only obstacle in the way of their marriage is the gangster brother of Faria, who is totally against any men seeing his sister, until her marriage. The story of Housefull revolves around these characters and families. Many of these characters experience difficult relationships with their friends or love interests, or just life itself. These problems and complications follow as the drama serial progresses, and bring about very comical moments. Characters * Architect Ikramul Haq (Abul Hayat) - Ikramul Haq is a very successful and experienced architect, living the urban city of Dhaka. He is the father of two daughters and one son, Shimu, Mithila and Mishu. All his children have reached passed High School and pursued further studies onto University. Ikramul is a merry man who very much loves his life, including his family dearly. Though a very simple man, he tends to always worry about the threat of earthquakes devastating buildings of Dhaka. He believes the construction of the buildings are not right, and are definitely not earthquake proof. He wants a solution for this problem, but realizes some solutions are very hard to find. Besides his career beliefs, Ikramul is a very practical man who knows how to handle many situations that occur in his family or even out of his family. He is extremely proud of his family and dearly loves his wife and children * Builder Ikramul Haq (Sohel Khan) - Builder Ikramul Haq is the neighbour of Architect Ikramul Haq, and he has also had a reasonably successful career. Ikramul has the tendency to give people a very hard time over very small issues, and the victim of builder Haq is next door neighbours, the Haq family. As he ages he starts to think about his life, as he has not married yet, and what he has achieved. He was in a relationship with a fairly young women, called Sharmeen. He loved her very much but their relationship does not last long, as Sharmeen kept pushing for a marriage, and Ikramul kept stalling and stalling with excuses. As the story progresses, their relationship breaks and Ikramul becomes extremely sad. He lives with his nephew called Siddique, who is always smiling and laughing. Siddique loves his uncle Ikramul and Ikramul also cares and loves his nephew as if he is his son. * Ifti (Mosharraf Karim) - Ifti is the younger brother of Mithu, who is the wife of architect Ikramul Haq. He is therefore the uncle of Shimu, Mithila and Mishu. He arrives in Dhaka in the third episode of the dramaserial, and straight away moves into the house of Ikramul. Ifti is a happy going and funny man, who at times may become irritating to some people. Nevertheless, everyone in the family love him and they do not mind him staying in the house. He lives in the same room as Shumon, the brother of Ikramul Haq, and he tends to tease him quite a lot about his weight, as Shumon is very overweight, bringing about many humorous moments. As the story progresses, Ifti starts to realise that he is the person who has to solve all sorts of problems in the family. And it is somewhat true that problems are dealt by him, and they are done very well, usually. Ifti had interests of going overseas to other countries such as Australia and America. He participates in many tests to achieve the right to go overseas, and also spends a lot of money for these tests. After he fails the 'IELTS' test, which is the compulsory test needed to be done in order to go to Australia, he gives up on the dream to live in Australia. This makes his brother-in-law and his sister furious, because it was from them that Ifti had borrowed money from. In the latter part of the serial, Ifti starts to dream about making a movie, but money, once again is the issue for his dream. * Shumon (Shumon Patowary) - Shumon is the younger brother of architect Haq, and the brother-in-law of Monira. Shumon is a very loved and respected person in the family. He is also a very responsible member of the family, as he also solves many problems and situations in the family. Just like Ifti, Shumon also moved into the house, but it was a long time before Ifti had joined. Though he is quite overweight, he is not very lazy at all. This is because he always loves completing his own chores, such as washing his own clothes, ironing his own clothes, and also getting usual groceries for the family. Shumon has another reason for doing his own work, that is because his sister-in-law, Mithu, has to do all housework by herself, as there is no servant in the house. Unlike Ifti, Shumon has a job at an office, which he regularly attends everyday. Despite his quite busy life, he has a lot time to spend with his family, especially with his two nieces and nephew. * Mithu (Monira Mithu) - Mithu is the wife of architect Haq and the mother of three children. She is the most aggressive member of this family, but also the most caring member of the family. She tends to get upset or angry when something is not right, and also may argue with her kids or even her husband. But although her moody character, she still has time to love and care for her family and kids. Mithu is a housewife, and a very busy one indeed. She never complains about being a housewife, but her complain is the amount of work she has to do. Mithu often pleads to her husband to get a servant to help her in her duties. Ikramul tries, but fails, due to the lack of servants available in Dhaka. The result of Mithu working hard all day is an angry, tempered and aggressive woman. As the story advances, Shimu, the elder daughter, starts to think about and arrange a marriage, Mithu slowly realizes how much she really loves her children, and how she will feel when Shimu, or her other kids, are married into another house. Imagining her house without her children, especially daughters, Mithu starts to devote more time for her children and less time for work. * Siddique (Siddiqur Rahman) - Siddique is the lovable, but at times irritating nephew of builder Haq, and fortunately or unfortunately the neighbour of architect Haq. Siddique lives with his uncle since he left his whole family in his village to stay in Dhaka. Although Siddique sometimes feels sad as he misses his family, he always keeps a smile on his face and enjoys every moment of his life. If he is slapped, insulted or even feeling unhappy, he will still be smiling and laughing. Many of the people living in the apartments of his building find him and his smile irritating. But as the story develops, these same people wonder how it is possible to have a smile on one's face through periods of sadness and unhappiness. Characters such as Mithu, Ifti, Mishu and Shimu realize that it is very difficult to keep a smile on your face every moment, let alone just hard times. These characters later tell Siddique that he is a very brave man and tell him to never ever stop smiling and laughing. The family of architect Haq start to see Siddique as one of their own, and also start to love him just like his uncle loves him. * Mishu Sabbir as Mishu * Sumaiya Shimu as Shimu * Mithila as Mithila * Nova as Koni * Hilol as Niaz * Istiak Ahmed Rumel as Rumel * Hasan Masood as Hasan * Marzuk Russell as Sujon * Zillur Rahman as Hannan * Maznun Mizan as Billal * Tonu as Tonu * Chashi Alam as Chashi * Siddiqur Rahman as Siddique See also *Songsoptok *Bohubrihi *Kothao Keu Nei *Baker bhai *Aaj Robibar *Vober Hat *Doll's House (TV series) *Bishaash ReferencesExternal links * Fan Page of Housefull Category:2000s Bangladeshi television series Category:2009 Bangladeshi television series endings Category:Bangladeshi drama television series Category:Bengali-language television programming in Bangladesh ","title":"House Full (TV series)"},{"id":"25845837","text":"The Estrella Warbirds Museum is an aviation museum dedicated to the restoration and preservation of military aircraft, vehicles, and memorabilia.

The company produced over 100 CDs and cassettes of traditional and contemporary artists from around the world. Nomad and Latitudes were imprint labels.MOTW Music of the World was formed in New York in the early 1980s by Bob Haddad, an amateur ethnomusicologist, teacher and professional musician, who began to record demo tapes for traditional musicians in his apartment. Word began to spread among world music artists who needed recordings to sell at their gigs, and soon, world-class musicians began contacting Bob to ask for his help in producing recordings. During these early years, and before a commercial consciousness of “world music” had developed, Music of the World was the only world music-based cassette music label in the West. Its catalog rapidly expanded to include artists from Africa, India, Asia, and Latin America, and in addition to opening accounts with major retailers across the US, the company began to export its recordings for overseas distribution. In 1989, Haddad and his partner, Martha Lorantos, moved from Brooklyn, NY to Chapel Hill, North Carolina. It was here where the label would see unprecedented growth. In that same year, the first two CDs were released, and over the next ten years, over 90 additional CD titles were produced. The label was distributed in over twenty countries worldwide. The mid-1990s were peak years for the label, and were marked by the commercial success of several recordings, including the award-winning Vintage Beausoleil (Michael Doucet and Beausoleil); The Grammy-nominated Raga Aberi (with L. Shankar, Zakir Hussain and Vikku Vinayakram); and one of the label’s best selling recordings, Talking Spirits, featuring various Native American artists. In addition to the premier Music of the World (MOW) label, two label imprints were born during this period of growth. Nomad Records featured modern world music and world jazz, and Latitudes was a mid-price label featuring single-artist releases and compilations of traditional world music. The label received many awards from independent recording organizations such as NAIRD (AFIM) and NARAS (Grammys). Unlike other world music labels that licensed music tracks and entire recordings form other labels for re-release, Music of the World produced virtually all its own recordings. Bob & Martha coordinated A&R; and worked closely with the artists, and produced the great majority of the albums released on the labels. Other remarkable recordings and roster artists include Glen Velez, the father of modern frame drumming (Handdance; Ramana - USA); Dumisani Maraire (Chaminuka; Shona Spirit [with Ephat Mujuru] - Zimbabwe); Hassan Hakmoun (The Fire Within - Morocco); Badal Roy (Yantra; One in the Pocket - Bangladesh/USA); Tarun Bhattacharya and Bikram Ghosh (Sargam; Kirvani - India); Jalal Zolfonun (Kord Bayat; Mystic Journey - Iran), and many others. In 2000, shortly after the emergence of Napster and during a time of great difficulty for independent record labels, Music of the World was acquired by emusic.com, one of the earliest digital download websites. Today, entire albums and individual tracks from the catalog are available for download through major online sources. Physical copies of many of the Music of the World, Nomad and Latitudes CDs may still be purchased on major internet suppliers.

It would incentivize the research and development of new pharmaceutical products that make substantial reductions in the global burden of disease. The Health Impact Fund is the creation of a team of researchers led by the Yale philosopher Thomas Pogge and the University of Calgary economist Aidan Hollis, and is promoted by the non-profit organization Incentives for Global Health (IGH). Motivation In the current system of development and distribution of medicines, millions of people from developing countries die from diseases because the patented medicines they need are unaffordable or because no medicine exists to cure their ailments. Little pharmaceutical research is devoted to diseases specific to the poor. This is largely because it has been difficult for pharmaceutical companies to profit from research and development directed at products needed by the poor. The cost of pharmaceutical research and development is high and unlikely to be recovered from those in poor countries who cannot afford the medicines. Therefore, \\"the Health Impact Fund would give companies incentives to develop new products targeting the diseases and conditions for which existing systems have failed to produce results, which would especially benefit the poor.\\" S.J. Hoffman, T. Pogge. 2011. “Revitalizing Pharmaceutical Innovation for Global Health,” Health Affairs 30(2):367. doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0103. The allocation of pharmaceutical research and development effort is partly a result of the global patent regime established by the Agreement on Trade- Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Prior to TRIPS, countries were free to not enact intellectual property laws covering medicines, leading to flourishing generic drug industries in countries such as India. Following TRIPS, all World Trade Organization members were required to institute strict, American-style intellectual property rights. As a result, the supply of generic medicines to poor countries has been sharply diminished.Joseph Stiglitz, \\"Scrooge and Intellectual Property Rights,\\" British Medical Journal 333, no. 7582 (2006), pp. 1279. According to Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz, the pharmaceutical patent system needs an \\"alternative\\" that would \\"give large rewards for cures or vaccines for diseases like malaria that affect millions.\\" Design of the Fund The Health Impact Fund is intended to address the problems with an uncomplemented pharmaceutical patent system. The Health Impact Fund uses market forces to create incentives to develop medicines for typically neglected diseases and to distribute these medicines at low prices all over the world.Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), p. 3. Pharmaceutical patent- holders would receive financial rewards by opting to register their new medicines, or new uses of existing medicines, with the Fund. By registering, a patent-holder agrees to distribute its medicine globally at cost and to cooperate in measuring the health impact of that medicine. In return, the firm receives an annual reward based on its measurable contribution to reducing the global burden of disease.Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), ch. 2. In order to achieve distribution at cost, the Health Impact Fund could require generic licensing, tendering, or price controls, depending on the nature of the product. Registrants of new drugs are eligible for reward payments for ten years starting at the date of marketing approval of their product. New uses receive rewards for five years. Following the reward period, registrants agree to allow generic manufacturing of their medicines, in order to prevent price spikes.Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), pp. 13-14. Registrants retain their rights to control follow-on innovation.Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), p. 17. Assessing the health impact of a registered product When assessing the health impact of a registered product, “the Health Impact Fund would essentially estimate the difference between (1) the actual health status of people who consumed the registered product and (2) the estimated health status of those people, had they not had access to the registered product.”Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), p. 9. The standard measure of health impact is the Quality- Adjusted Life Year (QALY). For example, if all registered products were in conjunction estimated to have saved 10 million QALYs, then a registered product that saved 1 million of those QALYS would receive ten percent of the available reward funds for that year.Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), pp. 3-4. The health impact assessment of a registered product would be conducted for each year of its registration with the Health Impact Fund, and payments would be disbursed annually. Funding The Health Impact Fund might be financed by governments, with countries committing a fixed fraction of their gross national income (GNI) to the Health Impact Fund (0.03 percent of a country's GNI is the suggested minimum).Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), pp. 10-11. Alternatively, the Health Impact Fund might also be funded through an international tax on carbon emissions, say, or on disruptive financial speculations. Next step: an innovative pilot As performance measurement is a core component of the Health Impact Fund, it needs to be robust across diverse products, patient demographics, and social and natural environments. Working with leading health care assessment organizations such as The George Institute for International Health, NICE International, the Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen (IQWiG) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the Health Impact Fund would perform evaluations of the health impact of different products in a variety of countries. Such assessments would go beyond pre-approval clinical trials, using epidemiological data from actual usage, practical trials, physician surveys, and patient demographics, as modifiers to the core health impact assessment. IGH aims to pilot the proposed Health Impact Fund mechanism by rewarding a pharmaceutical manufacturer on the basis of measured health impact in a region. This will allow the pay-for- performance approach to be field-tested and refined before it is implemented on a wider scale. Outcomes and Benefits of the Pilot: (1.) Create a comprehensive metric to evaluate the health impact of medicines based on the actual reductions in mortality and morbidity each achieves. (2.) Determine how to apply this metric reliably through a field-test that focuses on a new drug's introduction into a specific area. No attempt has ever been made to measure the health impact of a newly introduced medicine. (3.) Benefit people in the field-test area by giving them access to an important new product at an affordable price and by rewarding the innovator promoting its wide and effective use by those who can benefit from it. This pilot would break new ground by being the first-ever effort to measure the health impact of a newly introduced medicine. IGH is currently exploring opportunities for a potential pilot. Relationship to other proposals The Health Impact Fund can be seen as a development of Advanced Market Commitment, which also incentivizes new research while ensuring access at low prices. Compared to the Advanced Market Commitment, the Health Impact Fund is comprehensive by offering to reward any new drug or vaccine. Moreover, the Health Impact Fund would not guarantee a market: how much an innovator would earn from its registered products would depend on how much health impact it achieves with them as well as on the reward rate, which in turn depends on the aggregate health gains achieved by all registered products. A third way of viewing it is as a supplementary global drug insurance system, in which the copayment made by consumers is equal to the cost of production. The Health Impact Fund staff has prepared a memo setting out their view of the intellectual history of the Health Impact Fund.Health Impact Fund intellectual history memo Reception= Criticisms  When the Health Impact Fund was proposed in 2008, it attracted criticism from Professor Brook Baker and Knowledge Ecology International for not requiring open licensing of registered drugs.Baker criticismKnowledge Ecology International criticism Instead, it allowed drug manufacturers to maintain a monopoly, subject to regulated prices. The proponents modified the proposal in response, suggesting greater flexibility about this aspect of the Health Impact Fund. Brita Pekarsky (2010) has argued that the cost of the Health Impact Fund may be too high, if it is taking money away from other valuable development or health related activities.Brita Pekarsky, “Should Financial Incentives be Used to Differentially Reward ‘Me-Too’ and Innovative Drugs,” Pharmacoeconomics 28.1(2010): 1-17. She does not, however, identify what opportunity cost is relevant. Paul Grootendorst (2009) states that the primary challenge for the Health Impact Fund is the difficulty of measuring health impact accurately.Paul Grootendorst, “How Should We Support Pharmaceutical Innovation?,” Expert. Rev. Pharmacoeconomics Outcomes Res. 2009: 9(4) – 313-320. He notes particularly the problems of trying to attribute health impact to drugs that have long latency periods in their effectiveness (such as vaccines and anti-hypertensives); the problems of consistency across different therapeutic areas; and the technical difficulty of disentangling the effect of the drug from confounding factors. Jorn Sonderholm (2009) argues that there is a lack of evidence that patents create a barrier to access, so that the Health Impact Fund may fail to address a real problem.Jorn Sonderholm, “A Reform Proposal in Need of Reform: A Critique of Thomas Pogge’s Proposal for How to Incentivize Research and Development of Essential Drugs,” Public Health Ethics 0.0 (2009): 1-11. This is due to a misunderstanding about the nature of the Health Impact Fund, which addresses the problem that there are insufficient incentives to invest in vaccines and treatments for diseases that lack effective market demand. Sakiko Fukuda-Parr and Proochista Ariana (2011) criticized the Health Impact Fund on a variety of grounds, including its approach to the distribution of benefits and costs, the impact on generic competition and the role of the Health Impact Fund in strategic negotiations on intellectual property rights,Sakiko Fukuda-Parr and Proochista Ariana, \\"Health Impact Fund – Raising Issues Of Distribution, IP Rights And Alliances,\\" IP-Watch.Org, September 26, 2011. leading to a response from IGH.Response to criticism by Fukuda-Parr and Ariana Afschin Gandjour and Nadja Chernyak state that the Health Impact Fund does not have a rational basis for the underlying willingness to pay per health gain. They propose a system in which the reward for innovative drugs would be based on \\"willingness to pay.\\" Since willingness to pay is quite low in low-income countries, their approach would not address existing global health inequities.

The head coach was Nat Holman, who was one of the game's greatest innovators and playmakers. Unlike today, when colleges recruit players from all over the country, the 1950 CCNY team was composed of \\"kids from the sidewalks of New York City,\\" who had been recruited by Holman's assistant coach Harold \\"Bobby\\" Sand from PSAL schools such as Taft, Clinton, Boys, Erasmus, and Franklin High Schools. Background The \\"Starting 5\\" consisted of two black and three Jewish players. The team is the only team to win both the National Invitation Tournament and the NCAA Tournament in the same year, by defeating Bradley University in the championship game of each tournament. The 1950 City team was also the first NCAA champion to have black players in its starting lineup. The players on the team were Ed Warner, Norm Mager, Irwin Dambrot, Alvin \\"Fats\\" Roth, Ed Roman, Floyd Layne, Herb Cohen, Ron Nadell, Leroy Watkins, Joe Galiber, and Arthur Glass. Students at CCNY, dubbed the poor man's Harvard because of its lofty academic standards, lived and died with every game, raising arena roofs with their unique school cheer: \\"Allagaroo garoo gara, Allagaroo garoo gara, Ee-yah ee-yah, Sis boom bah, Team! Team! Team!\\" NIT tournament commentary CCNY had posted a 17-5 record during the regular season, but had failed to attract any support in the final AP Top 20. The team was made up mostly of sophomores and was the last squad selected to play in Madison Square Garden's famed NIT, which had a 12-team field and was at that time more prestigious than the NCAA tournament. People took notice when the Beavers thrashed defending champion San Francisco 65-46 in the opening round. CCNY then faced 3rd ranked and two-time defending NCAA champion Kentucky and their 7-foot center, Bill Spivey, in the second round. Kentucky was a racially segregated school from the Southeastern Conference, and several Wildcats refused to shake hands with the black and Jewish CCNY players before the game. This incensed the CCNY players, who then proceeded to dismantle the Kentucky team in every aspect of the game. The final score was CCNY 89, Kentucky 50, which was the worst ever defeat for an Adolph Rupp coached team. This win was sweet revenge for the CCNY players, because Rupp was once quoted was as saying that he'd never coach a team with \\"kikes\\" and \\"blacks.\\" After the game, the Kentucky state legislature called for the flag over the capitol to be flown at half-staff. The blowout win over Kentucky was even more impressive due to the fact that Kentucky had won the NCAA tournament in 1948, 1949, and would win the tournament again the following year in 1951. A Cinderella Team had now emerged in the tournament. City College then defeated Duquesne 62-52 in the semi-final round. In the title game, the Beavers squared off against top ranked Bradley, who had All- American Paul Unruh and the 5'8\\" speedster, Gene \\"Squeaky\\" Melchiorre. CCNY came out on top 69-61 to win the tournament. Ed Warner of CCNY was awarded Most Valuable Player honors. NCAA tournament commentary Things were a lot different during the early years of the tournament than they are today. The 1950 NCAA tournament consisted of an Eastern Regional and a Western Regional, with four teams in each region for a total of 8 teams in the tournament. The term \\"Final Four\\" was a misnomer, because the runners-up in each region went to the championship game site to play a consolation game. It wasn't until 1952 that a true Final Four took place in the tournament, when the field had expanded to 16 teams in four brackets. For many years the brackets were assembled strictly by conference champions, geography, and not according to won-lost record, strength of schedule, or Associated Press rank. Until around 1953, teams were invited to play in the NCAA tournament after the NIT tournament had crowned a champion. After CCNY's improbable run to the NIT title, the Beavers were immediately selected to participate in the NCAA tournament. In the first round, City College nipped second ranked Ohio State, 56-55. The Beavers then defeated fifth ranked North Carolina State 78-73 to reach the title game. CCNY again faced top-ranked Bradley and won the tournament, 71-68, to score the only Grand Slam in the history of college basketball. Irwin Dambrot of CCNY was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, and Nat Holman appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show. CCNY's victory was voted the most exciting event in the history of college basketball at Madison Square Garden. None of the players on the City College team went on to fame after 1950. There was one player in the tournament, however, who went down in history as one of the greatest basketball players of all time – Bob Cousy of Holy Cross, who played in an opening round game. Cousy was remembered long after most of the CCNY players had been forgotten. Follow-up commentary CCNY's double-win in 1950 was not without controversy. The players had taken money from gamblers in the point-shaving scandals during the 1948-1949 season and also during some regular-season games in the 1949-1950 season. No games were fixed during the post-season tournaments. Had the scandal come to light before the 1950 tournaments began, CCNY would not have been invited to participate and a different team would have won the championships. There was also a controversial play in the waning moments of the NCAA Championship game. Gene Melchiorre swiped a CCNY pass and raced downcourt for the potential go- ahead basket. Irwin Dambrot and the Bradley star collided under the basket. Dambrot came up with the ball, and threw a perfect pass to Norm Mager who made the layup to seal the victory. Many people though that Dambrot had fouled Melchiorre, but no call was made. Had Dambrot been called for a foul, Bradley could have won the game. The \\"non-call\\" became infamous throughout the country. The championship game of each tournament was played within the friendly confines of Madison Square Garden. Shortly thereafter, the NCAA Committee ruled that no team could compete in both tournaments, so there cannot be another double champion. The Final Four of the NIT has remained at Madison Square Garden (or its successor building of the same name), but the NCAA tournament left after the 1961 season until hosting the East Regional Finals in 2014 in its current location. Since the 1950 NCAA Tournament, the Garden has not hosted the National Finals. For CCNY, there were dark clouds on the horizon following the amazing double victory. The point-shaving scandal sent shock waves throughout college basketball, and most of the City College players were implicated in it. The scandal ended the NBA hopes of the CCNY players, prompted the suspension of the basketball program, and forever tarnished the '49-50 team's legacy. Ed Warner and Alvin Roth played professionally in the Continental Basketball Association. Following the scandal, the school was moved from Division I to Division III and was banned from playing at Madison Square Garden. As a result of these sanctions, the CCNY basketball program was de–emphasized, and the school has never again appeared in either the NCAA or NIT tournaments. In the 74-year history of the NCAA tournament, CCNY was one of the most unlikely champions, and the school has not reach post-season play again. To this day, CCNY is the only NCAA Basketball Championship team that is no longer a member of Division 1. Despite the tragedy that befell CCNY in the aftermath of the point-shaving scandal, the 1950 City team is still the most celebrated college basketball team in the history of New York City. On a positive note, every one of the C.C.N.Y. players involved in the scandal eventually went back to school to earn his degree. In another twist, the NCAA tournament did not have another game at any Madison Square Garden facility from the 1961 tournament until 2014, when its successor, Madison Square Garden IV, hosted the East Regional Finals. This might be related to the point-shaving scandal of 1951 and the existence of gamblers in New York City. In 1996, the Final Four was held outside of New York City at the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. After a hiatus of more than half a century, the Big Dance finally returned to the most famous indoor arena in the United States. Nat Holman stayed on as CCNY coach until 1959, and the school's arena was named \\"Nat Holman Gymnasium.\\" Holman was 98-years-old when he died at the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale, The Bronx, NY, in 1995. RosterProfile of the players Irwin Dambrot was a 6-foot-4, 175-pound All-American forward and the only senior in the starting lineup. His free-throw defeated Ohio State 56-55 in the opening round of the NCAA tournament. He also made a game-saving play at the end of the title game against Bradley to earn MVP honors. After the scandal broke, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges, ended his basketball career, and enrolled at Columbia University Dental School. He served in the U.S. Air Force Dental Corps and then practiced dentistry in Forest Hills, Queens and Manhattan. In 1989, Dambrot went to Kansas City for the 50th anniversary of the NCAA tournament, when all previous MVPs were invited; he met a lot of coaches and was treated royally. In December 2009, a month before his death, Dambrot was on hand in a wheelchair at Madison Square Garden when the Garden cited the double championship as the No. 1 college basketball moment in the game's 75-year history there.http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/college/madison-square-garden- celebrates-75th-anniversary-college-basketball-top-10-moments-article-1.433369 He had been living in Mendham, N.J. and died of Parkinson's disease at age 81 on January 21, 2010 and was interred at Locust Hill Cemetery in Dover, New Jersey. Norm Mager was a 6-foot-5 senior and the top reserve on the team. He joined the Baltimore Bullets after graduating from CCNY, but his professional basketball career ended when the scandal broke. He became an executive with a janitorial supply company, Perfect Building Maintenance, and retired in 2000 as its president. In 2005, Mager died of cancer at age 78 at a hospital in Boynton Beach, Florida. Ed Roman, the team's 6-foot-6-inch center, pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to fix the outcome of games at Madison Square Garden. After serving two years in the Army, Roman earned his undergraduate degree in physical education at Seattle University. He returned to New York to do work at City College and New York University toward a master's degree and a doctorate in psychology. He worked in the city public school's system in Queens. Ed Roman died of leukemia at age 57 in 1988 at the Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. Ed Warner also pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges. He was the only one of the players to go to jail for his crimes when he was sentenced to six months at Rikers Island. He received a prison sentence because he had a record as a juvenile delinquent and was incorrigible and uncontrollable in the courtroom. In the 1960s, he was imprisoned again after pleading guilty to attempting to sell heroin. Warner had worked as a high school basketball referee, but in April 1984 he was partly paralyzed when his automobile was struck from behind in Upper Manhattan. Ed Warner died in Harlem at age 73 in 2002. Floyd Layne became basketball coach at CCNY in the 1970s and 1980s. After he left CCNY, he became the head basketball coach at Prospect Heights High School in Brooklyn. Alvin Roth was 6'4\\", weighed 210 pounds and played guard. He was one of the players arrested in the scandal and agreed to serve in the United States Army for a time in exchange for suspending his jail sentence. After discharge, Roth finished City College business school and became an insurance executive in Westchester County, New York. Leroy Watkins was a 6-foot-7-inch reserve center who was not involved in the scandal, because he had very little playing time. Nat Holman put Watkins in to jump- center for the opening tipoff against Kentucky in the NIT, and he surprisingly outjumped 7-foot Bill Spivey. Watkins died in 2008. Joe Galiber, a substitute player who was not involved in point-shaving, became a state senator and served in this capacity until his death at age 71 in 1995.

It encompasses three historic villages: Upper Gornal, Lower Gornal, and Gornal Wood. Gornal was formerly part of Staffordshire, prior to the creation of the West Midlands in 1974. The three Gornal villagesThe Gornals, Ned Williams, Uralia Press, 2014. were originally a part of the ancient manor of Sedgley until 1894, when the area became part of Sedgley Urban District. In 1966, along with most of the rest of Sedgley, it was merged into the County Borough of Dudley. Since 1974, it has been part of the larger Metropolitan Borough of Dudley. Gornal stone, a variety of limestone, originates in Gornal. Areas=Upper Gornal Situated south of Sedgley on the main A459 road, the area has undergone extensive private and council housing development since the 1920s. It was the target of three bombs by the German Luftwaffe during World War II, though no buildings were damaged and there were no civilian casualties. Upper Gornal formerly had a small cinema, the Jack Darby Picture House, from the early 20th century, but it closed in 1960 due to competition from other nearby theatres. The building now houses a small hardware store. Also of note, the local landmark Pig on the Wall public house was controversially demolished in 2002 to make way for a McDonald's restaurant. Lower Gornal Lower Gornal is located southwest of Upper Gornal, and includes the three schools in the local area – Roberts Primary, Red Hall Primary, and Ellowes Hall Sports College. First built in 1894, the original building of Roberts Primary School was demolished in 2000 following the completion of a new £6million building. Red Hall was formed around 1900 as an infant, junior and secondary school; but the secondary school closed in 1964 when Ellowes Hall opened. Ellowes Hall itself was named after the Ellowes Hall House that previously stood on the site, prior to its demolition in 1964. Gornal Athletic F.C., a football team currently in the Premier Division of the West Midlands (Regional) League, are based in Lower Gornal. =The local legend – 'Pig on the wall'= One, not entirely apocryphal, episode from Lower Gornal's past occurred when Enoch and Eli (Aynock and Ayli in the local dialect – the two fictional characters to which local jokes are usually attributed) \\"put the pig on the wall to watch the band go by\\". Local legend has it, that once, a military band marched through the suburb, and caused such great excitement amongst the residents, that not only did many people flock to see it, but one person even put his pig on the wall to afford the animal a better view. This phrase has long been part of the local idiolect, but its origins still remain obscure.http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/Tales-Old- Gornal/story-20155588-detail/story.htmlhttp://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/Gornal- pig-wall-really-puts- style/story-20135851-detail/story.htmlhttp://www.sedgleymanor.com/historical/pig_on_the_wall.html There was even a hotel in the Upper Gornal area of the town called the \\"Pig on the Wall\\". It was originally called the Bricklayer's Arms and known locally as Hammond's after the long time owners, but took up its new name in 1985. It was however demolished and replaced with a McDonald's restaurant in late 2002.https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2009/11/02/memories-of-the-pig-are- just-off-the-wall/ Gornal Wood Gornal Wood is on the western boundary of the Dudley Metropolitan Borough, and contains a small shopping area, including a library. It is the site of the Crooked House pub, a famous landmark known because of its distinctive appearance as a result of mining subsidence. Gornal Wood Crematorium and Cemetery is also in this area, having opened in 1960. Notable events=2002 earthquake The epicentre of the 2002 Dudley earthquake was located in Gornal Wood. It measured 4.8 on the Richter magnitude scale and could be felt as far away as North Yorkshire. Notable residents Former BBC newsreader Sue Lawley was born in Dudley in 1946 and grew up in Lower Gornal.

September 15, 1685) was a prominent English immigrant to New England, one of the approximately 20,000 immigrants who came as part of the Great Migration. A deacon of the church, among his many public offices he served on the Committee of Colony Assessments in 1640 and as Deputy for Watertown to the General Court of Massachusetts in 1673. He held property in nearby Dedham between 1636 and 1639, although there is no evidence that he ever lived there.Family Memorials: Genealogies of the Families and Descendants of the Early Settlers of Watertown, Massachusetts, Vol. I, Henry Bond, Little, Brown & Company, Boston, 1855 Background and family Hastings and his wife Susan left Ipswich, Suffolk, on The Elizabeth on April 30, 1634.Buckminster, Lydia N.H., The Hastings Memorial, A Genealogical Account of the Descendants of Thomas Hastings of Watertown, Mass. from 1634 to 1864, Boston: Samuel G. Drake Publisher (an undated NEHGS photoduplicate of the 1866 edition), 5. Although his home in England is unknown, the make-up of their ship's company strongly suggests that he was from East Anglia and perhaps from the counties of Suffolk or Norfolk.Thompson, Roger, Mobility & Migration, East Anglian Founders of New England, 1629-1640, Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1994. The only major genealogy to treat the family, The Hastings Memorial (Boston, 1866), states that he was of noble birth by descent from the illustrious family that included the Earl of Huntingdon line. He is not known to have claimed such a connection in his lifetime and there is no record to substantiate this supposed connection and much to argue against it. The surname is generally habitational and may derive from the English town of Hastings, Sussex.Hastings name meaning, Dictionary of American Family Names, Oxford University Press, , Ancestry.com After the death of his first wife in 1650, Hastings married Margaret Cheney of Roxbury and together they had eight children. Remarkably for the day and given such a large brood, they all survived their parents. In 1671, their 19-year-old first son, Thomas, Jr., was accused of fathering a child out of wedlock and the Hastings and Woodward families (who came to America together on the same ship 37 years before) became embroiled in a highly embarrassing paternity suit before the Middlesex County Court. Intimate relations outside of marriage were not simply frowned upon but potentially criminal. The social and political ramifications were foreboding too for Deacon Thomas, who was not only a leader in the church but serving as a selectman, town clerk and town meeting moderator during the controversy.Divided We Stand: Watertown, Massachusetts, 1630-1680, Roger Thompson, University of Massachusetts Press, Amherst, Mass., 2001, While the younger Thomas denied the relationship and asserted another was the father, Susannah Woodward was quite forthright about their alleged liaisons and \\"for all of which miscarriages ... she craved forgiveness.\\"Thompson, Roger, Sex in Middlesex, Popular Mores in a Massachusetts County, 1649-1699, Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1986, 30. Although paternity could not be established, circumstantial evidence and hearsay led to an order that Thomas, Jr., pay for maintenance of the child and his father assumed the financial responsibility. Then, like today, his father's standing in the community brought relative leniency. The younger Thomas married Anna Hawkes a year later after moving 150 miles west to the Connecticut River Valley and settling in the village of Hatfield, Massachusetts.A History of Hatfield, Massachusetts, in Three Parts, Daniel White Wells, Reuben Field Wells, Published by F. C. H. Gibbons, Springfield, Massachusetts, 1910 He became a respected doctor which must have been a relief to his father who was to say later, \\"I have been at great charge to bring him up to be a Scholar and I hope he will live well by his arts and learning.\\" Dr. Thomas practiced medicine for some 40 years and served as town clerk for two decades. His was a frontier practice and as such, he treated many injuries sustained in skirmishes with the Indians and also wrote one of the best contemporary records of the devastating 1704 attack on nearby Deerfield. Legacy In Watertown, Massachusetts, where the American town meeting first took form, Thomas Hastings was repeatedly called to leadership positions inside and outside the church. At one time or another, he held virtually every office to include multiple stints as Selectman, Moderator and Town Clerk. His public service spanned five decades and he was last elected to public office (Selectman) in 1680.Barker, Fred, Watertown Records Comprising The First and Second Books of Town Proceedings with the Land Grants and Possessions also The Proprietor's Book and The First Book and Supplement of Births Deaths and Marriages, Watertown: Historical Society (undated modern NEHGS photoduplication copy of 1894 edition). As a Freeman, he owned property and would have been a devoted Puritan and believer of the Gospel as conveyed in the Geneva Bible. Certainly one of the town's most influential citizens, later historians have called him one of the \\"old war-horses\\"Thompson, Roger, Divided We Stand, Watertown, Massachusetts, 1630-1680, Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2001, 122. of Watertown. Many of the surviving records from his time were written in his hand and often the government meetings were held in his home. The descendants of Thomas & Margaret are numerous and many have risen to positions of great importance or notoriety. Although no marker remains, he almost certainly lies among his many descendants in Watertown's Old Burying Ground (Arlington St. Cemetery). Margaret Hastings survived him by about five years. The old property locations are well established, but no 17th-century Hastings family structures remain.

The small hamlet had an initial population of 11 people. According to Alfred Theodore Andreas's tome History of the State of Kansas (1883), \\"The improvements made by the town company were few a town well was dug, a blacksmith shop erected, a store opened by D. Hubbard, and a few dwelling houses built.\\" On May 8, 1863, a bushwhacker posse led by Dick Yeager stormed through Marion and shot Hubbard in the lungs. He survived the attack, but his house was robbed. (Yeager would serve under William Quantrill a few months later during the infamous Lawrence massacre.) In 1865, the Union Pacific Railway diverted traffic from the Santa Fe trail, causing the town's population to dwindle. In 1881, the small town's name was changed to Globe. The Marion/Globe post office, opened in 1858, closed in 1867, was reestablished in 1870, closed again in 1894, reopened in 1895, and closed permanently in 1900.

Location and Construction Arabellapark behind the Mae West landmark Arabellapark is located in the east of Munich, and is surrounded by 4 major roads. Richard- Strauss-Strasse, part of the Mittlerer Ring (Central Ring), forms the western border, Englschalkinger Strasse the north, Vollmannstrasse the east and Denningerstrasse the south. Arabellapark is connected by line U4 to the Munich U-Bahn network from an underground station of the same name. Above the U-Bahn station is an overground bus station served by numerous local bus lines. The area contains shops, private residences and hotels but is predominantly offices. Arabellapark contains only a few small roads, and therefore the majority of these are reserved only for pedestrians.

Located to the southeast of Paris in Sucy-en-Brie, the fort was part of an outer ring of eighteen major fortifications built in response to improvements in the range and effectiveness of artillery since the construction of the Thiers fortifications of the 1840s. It was built in accordance with improved principles of fortification developed for the Séré de Rivières system. The Fort de Sucy was built between 1879 and 1881 on a location that had been used by the Prussians to bombard the Saint-Maur peninsula in the 1870 war. The site controlled movement on the Route nationale 4 (Paris-Strasbourg) and Route nationale 19 (Paris-Mulhouse). The site also overlooked the Bois Notre-Dame and the Armainvillers Forest. With the advent of improved explosive shells, the fort was modernized with concrete cover almost immediately after it was completed. The roughly rectangular fort has an indented front with the main entrance at the centre, flanked by caponiers in a nine-metre-wide ditch. A central magazine in the barracks could hold 67 tons of gunpowder. The barracks accommodated 372 men, ten officers, and a tank. Modernization was foreseen in 1911, with additional fortifications in concrete, including three shelters and two observation turrets with machine guns. This project was never realized due to a lack of credits. In 1914 the fort contained fourteen guns on the rampart and ten on the caponiers. By 1915 two 75mm anti-aircraft guns were installed. Additional armament was installed in 1935 (Four 105mm Anti Aircraft guns), but the fort saw little action during World War II. The barracks, used as munitions storage, was destroyed on 22 August 1944 by the German army before it left the fort. The abandoned Fort de Sucy was purchased by Sucy-en-Brie in 1970.

April 2006. It is a treatise regarding various vices of the clergy, including sodomy, and the consequent need for reform. Against simony and clerical concubinage Damian wrote on a number of theological and disciplinary issues. He was a determined foe of simony, which some medieval ecclesiastical authors denounced as the most abominable of crimes.Weber, Nicholas. \\"Simony.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 14. New York, New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 31 January 2015. He strongly condemned the purchase of ecclesiastical offices by clergy, but, however, defended the validity of the Sacraments that such clerics administered. In June AD 1055, during the pontificate of Pope Victor II, the Saint attended a synod at Florence, Italy where simony and clerical incontinence were once more condemned. Against various sexual sins In the AD second century, Tertullian wrote that “all other frenzies of lusts which exceed the laws of nature and are impious toward both bodies and the sexes we banish … from all shelter of the Church”.Tertullian, De pudicitia, 4. Early medieval penitential books contained a wide array of different penances for such trespasses. Although various forms of same-sex behaviour were discussed in contemporary handbooks of penance, such as those by Burchard of Worms and Regino of Prüm, according to Paul Halsall, this is the only theological tract which exclusively addresses this theme. Bishops and priests were involved in every kind of immorality, publicly living with concubines or illicit wives, or furtively engaging in homosexual practices, following an example set by the scandalous Pope Benedict IX. \\"For Damian, the issue of homosexuality within the clergy is deeply related to the dignity of the priesthood.\\"Hoffman, Matthew Cullinan. \\"St. Peter Damian’s battle against clerical homosexuality offers useful lessons for today\\", Catholic World Report, September 27, 2018 Damian believed that the profligate and licentious behavior of the clergy undermined ecclesiastical authority and was beginning to provoke outbursts of violence from an outraged laity, which threatened civil order. For Damian, one who practices homosexual sodomy suffers from a fundamental disorientation regarding the natural complementarity of the sexes. \\"“What do you seek in a man, that you are unable to find in yourself...\\" He railed against such practices of solitary masturbation, mutual masturbation, copulation between the thighs, and anal copulation, as subversive disruptions against the moral order occasioned by the madness associated with an excess of lust. He viewed such actions as progressively more unnatural in that they involved another person in shameful acts. He was especially indignant about priests having sexual relationships with adolescent boys. He singles out superiors who, due to excessive and misplaced piety, have been lax in their duty to uphold church discipline. He opposes the ordination of those who engage in homosexual sex and wants those already ordained dismissed from Holy Orders. Those who misuse the sacraments to defile boys are treated with particular contempt. Controversy It caused a great stir and aroused not a little enmity against its author. Pope Leo IX, who had at first praised the work, was persuaded that it was exaggerated. He praised Damian's motivation in advocating chastity and condemning vice, and told him that Damian's own exemplary life did more to teach appropriate conduct than any words. He softened the suggestions for decisive action against offending clerics made by the author and excluded from the ranks of clergy only those who had offended repeatedly and over a long period of time.Thomas P. Doyle: \\"Roman Catholic Clericalism, Religious Duress, and Clergy Sexual Abuse,\\" in Pastoral Psychology, Vol. 51, No 3, January 2003. However, this interpretation is open to dispute as Leo also directed that the penitential be revised to reflect a stricter treatment.

As stated by Roland Leong, \\"McEwen was the smartest of the bunch. When he came up with the Hot Wheels deal using the Snake and Mongoose characters, it shook the world of drag racing big time. He produced a sponsorship package that allowed him and Prudhomme to buy the best equipment, pay expenses, make money and sell their image all over the United States. I hate to admit it but McEwen and Prudhomme showed us the way to the future. They were a lot smarter than most of us who didn't see past the end of the quarter-mile.\\" McEwen had four children: Jamie, Joe, Tom Jr., and Kathleen, and two grandchildren: Christian and Jonathan. Jamie and Joe are deceased. Early career McEwen gained his early experience in a variety of cars, beginning in 1953 with a '53 Oldsmobile at Santa Ana Drags in Irvine. He then went on to race a '54 Olds at Lions Drag Strip in Long Beach. He went from the stock ranks to gas coupes, Altereds, and eventually dragsters and funny cars. Among the cars he drove were the Stone-Woods-Cook '50 Olds fastback, the Bader and Ferrara Cadillac-powered Crosseyed Crosley, Art Chrisman's Hustler II, the Bud Rasner and Gary Slusser Fiat coupe, Dick Rea's Chrysler-powered supercharged gas dragster, and Gene Adams' Albertson Olds. 1960s McEwen continued his relationship with Adams for several years. In 1962, he drove Adams' Shark, which was one of the first dragsters to use a streamlined body with an enclosed parachute pack. This would turn out to be one of McEwen's best known rides. In 1963, McEwen achieved his first major success when he a runner-up finish against Art Malone at the Bakersfield March Meet in California in the Broussard-Garrison-Purcell-Davis car. He also drove Donovan's Donovan Engineering Special, and it was in this car he first raced Prudhomme. McEwen's 1975 funny car McEwen won the race against Prudhomme at Lions Drag Strip on September 12, 1964. He beat overcame Prudhomme's bright- orange edition of the famed Greer-Black-Prudhomme car two outings in a row, inspiring what may be the most famous match-race pairing in the history of drag racing. Later in 1964, McEwen drove Lou Baney's Yeakel Plymouth-sponsored dragster to victory at the 32-car UDRA meet at Fontana Raceway in Fontana. He also took Top Fuel honors at Lions Dragstrip and Pomona Raceway. McEwen's 1980 funny car Because their first contest had received so much attention, two more races between McEwen and Prudhomme were staged at Lions Drag Strip in 1965. McEwen drove the Yeakel Plymouth dragster past Prudhomme and his new ride, the Leong-owned Hawaiian, two rounds to one in the first, then lost in two straight sets in the second. Because McEwen raced only on the West Coast, he and the touring Prudhomme faced each other only once in 1966, at the Winternationals, site of their first national event meeting. There, Prudhomme in the B&M; Torkmaster Special took the win, with a 7.59 e.t. to McEwen's 7.69. They would not meet again for the rest of the decade. McEwen won the 1966 Hot Rod Magazine Championships at Riverside Raceway and then went on to win the 1968 Stardust National Open in Las Vegas. He also recorded the lowest ever elapsed time to date with a blistering 6.64 at the Orange County PDA Meet in 1968. The promoter McEwen also continued to build on his reputation as a colorful promoter. The Plymouth Hemi Cuda he unveiled in 1965 was featured in every major car magazine. He convinced the Southern California Plymouth Dealers Association to support him and displayed the car all over the West Coast. In 1967, McEwen took the same approach with one of drag racing's great one-shot wonders, Ford's Super Mustang. The car stole the show when it made its debut at the Winternationals. =Wildlife Racing= McEwen's strong promotional talent and Prudhomme's success on the strip eventually led the two to form a national touring team, sponsored by the toy company Mattel, and in mid-1969, McEwen and Prudhomme became co-owners of \\"Wildlife Racing.\\" The Mattel Hot Wheels sponsorship deal ran from 1970 through 1972. Wildlife Racing then signed with Care Free Sugarless Gum as a sponsor in 1973. McEwen and Prudhomme dissolved their partnership at the end of the 1973 season. 1970s In 1972, McEwen won his first major event when he dominated the Top Fuel field at the Bakersfield March Meet. A year later, he scored his first NHRA national event victory by topping the quickest Funny Car field in history at the SuperNationals at Ontario Motor Speedway. He went on to win four more national events, including his dramatic U.S. Nationals Funny Car victory over Prudhomme in 1978. The win came only a few days after the death of his son Jamie, who had battled leukemia. Later life McEwen won the AHRA World Finals at Spokane Raceway Park in 1982, the prestigious Big Bud Shootout in 1984, and Top Fuel at the 1991 Summernationals at Englishtown, New Jersey. McEwen solved his Corvette funny car's stability problems by adding tip fences to the rear spoiler.McClurg, p.50 caption.

(BEI) is a 501(c)(3), non-profit organization dedicated to the use of science and education to increase public knowledge of wildlife and habitat conservation and promote sustainable coexistence between people and nature. The organization was founded in 2007 to address unique conservation challenges in Texas, its home state, as well as other locations. Mission The organization's mission is to promote sustainable coexistence between people and nature through scientific communication and public education. Balanced Ecology emphasizes a balanced approach to conservation by promoting collaboration between interest groups such as state and federal agencies, academic institutions, conservation organizations, landowners, and other interested individuals, and by taking into consideration habitat, wildlife and human activities. Balanced Ecology is an all-volunteer organization and all funds are used exclusively for the direct advancement of its mission. History Balanced Ecology was founded in 2007 by Dr. Oranit (Orie) Gilad, a Conservation Ecologist. Dr. Gilad has spent over 15 years working on wildlife related projects around the world. Her work in western Texas with Mountain Lions and Desert Bighorn Sheep has put in focus the unique aspects of wildlife conservation in Texas, a state where 97-98% of all land is privately owned. Dr. Gilad believes that only through a collaborative effort between interested parties and by taking into consideration the needs of landowners as well as wildlife, progress can be made. Projects=Texas mountain lion conservation Scientific studies conducted in Texas on mountain lions show that: #the cats are experiencing low survivorship mainly due to predator control and hunting practices, #a high percentage of female Mountain Lions is being killed, a fact indicating that the population is being harvested at an unsustainable level (more lions are being killed than survive) #due to killing practices, Mountain Lions exhibit a skewed age group (population mainly composed of younger individuals), an unhealthy situation for a wild (or any) animal population. The Texas Mountain Lion Conservation Project is working to accomplish the following goals: #Educating the public regarding the importance of Mountain Lions, their ecology, and their status in Texas #working with private individuals, organizations, and other stakeholders interested in the conservation of Mountain Lions in Texas #achieving a solution where man and cat can coexist by identifying feasible solutions for such coexistence. Texas mountain lion population dynamics The Texas Mountain Lion Population Dynamics project addresses the unique land situation in Texas and works to identify three types of areas. The first type, a source area, is one where mountain lions can be protected; the second area type is a stable area, which mountain lions can use as dispersal routes and their number is kept stable; and the third type of area is a sink area where mountain lions are allowed to be killed (areas such as sheep and goat ranching communities). This source/sink approach has been proven successful to maintaining a healthy and viable mountain lion population. Conserving nature's footprints The Conserving Nature's Footprints outreach project teaches adults, teenagers, and kids how to enjoy the outdoors while minimizing their impact on the environment. The project incorporates classroom-type activities, hands-on experiences and field trips for adults, youth and children allowing individuals and teams to experience nature to its fullest while leaving no trace behind.

Throughout its service the squadron primarily operated night fighters. History=First World War No. 125 Squadron was initially formed at Old Sarum, Wiltshire on 1 February 1918 as a light bomber squadron of the Royal Flying Corps, operating Airco DH.4 and DH.9s. It was planned for the squadron to become operational and deploy to France in September however it was instead disbanded on 1 August 1918, thus never seeing active service in the First World War. Second World War A Boulton-Paul Defiant of No. 125 Squadron under repair at RAF Fairwood Common, Wales in January 1942. No. 125 Squadron was reformed on 16 June 1941 at RAF Colerne equipped with Bolton-Paul Defiant night fighters. The squadron was raised as a result of a war loan raised by the Newfoundland Commission of Government in 1940. After discovering a surplus of revenue, the commission presented the British Government with $500,000 to establish a squadron with the hope that it would be manned by Newfoundlanders. This hope was realised with at least a dozen Newfoundlanders flying with No. 125 Squadron in its early days along with a contingent of English, Scottish, Welsh, Commonwealth and Polish pilots. On 24 September 1941, the squadron moved to RAF Fairwood Common, Wales and became fully operational, with the Defiant proving to be a more than effective night fighter. By February 1942, No. 125 Squadron began to convert over to the twin-engined Bristol Beaufighter, with these becoming operational by 21 April. Defiants and Hawker Hurricanes were also used to supplement the Beaufighters in the squadron's patrols. With an increasing number of Newfoundlanders being found in No. 125 Squadron's ranks, some aircrew began to name their aircraft in recognition of their Newfoundland heritage: St, John's, Corner Brook, Deer Lake and Buchans were some of the names they used. From October to December 1942, the squadron operated a detachment at RAF Sumburgh in the Shetland Islands. No. 125 Squadron moved north to RAF Valley on 14 November 1943 in order to carry out patrols over the Irish Sea. While based here the squadron operated a detachment from RAF Ballyhalbert in Northern Ireland. Despite being a 'Newfoundland' squadron, by November 1943 only 5 of the 30 aircrew were from Newfoundland as well as 45 of the roughly 200 ground crew came from the Dominion. With a conversion to de Havilland Mosquito night fighters in February 1944, No. 125 Squadron moved south to RAF Hurn, Dorset at the end of March. This was in preparation to cover the Operation Overlord landings in Normandy. In April, No. 125 Squadron had their caribou squadron badge officially approved by King George VI. The squadron also participated in intercepting Operation Steinbock raids from January to May 1944. With a bridgehead secured in France and with the commencement of V-1 flying bomb attacks on London, the squadron moved to RAF Middle Wallop in July 1944 to fly night time interceptions. During this time it also flew patrols from RAF Bradwell Bay over the Low Countries. On 18 October 1944, No. 125 Squadron moved to RAF Coltishall, Norfolk. From Coltishall the squadron defended against enemy intruders and Heinkel He-111s carrying flying bombs, as well as undertaking reconnaissance to locate the remainder of German shipping. On 24 April 1945, No. 125 Squadron transferred up to RAF Church Fenton in Yorkshire. Here it saw out the war before disbanding for the second time on 20 November 1945 when its aircraft and personnel were renumbered to No. 264 Squadron. By the end of the war No. 125 Squadron had managed to score 44 victories, 5 probables and 20 damaged. Postwar Gloster Meteor NF.11, much like those that No. 125 Squadron operated in 1955. No. 125 Squadron reformed on 31 March 1955 at RAF Stradishall, Suffolk as a night fighter unit operating Gloster Meteor NF.11s.

History It was founded by Niels Steensen & Jørgen Varming in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1933. The firm specialised in civil, structural and building services engineering. During the 20th century, the practice grew out of Denmark and new offices were established in Australia (Steensen Varming Australia ‐ 1973), United Kingdom (Steensen Varming Mulcahy ‐ 1957) and Ireland (Varming Mulcahy Reilly Associates ‐ 1947). Jorgen Varming was the son of a prominent Danish Architect, Kristoffer Varming, he studied Engineering at the University of Newcastle.Mackenzie D., 2004 Foreword, Rayner Banham The Architecture of the Well-tempered Environment (2nd edition)  Sydney Opera House  Steensen and Varming were chosen by the Danish architect Jørn Utzon as the mechanical consulting engineers for the new Opera House project in Sydney in 1957. The Australian branch of Steensen & Varming Australia (later to be known as Steensen Varming) was led by Vagn Prestmark a partner from the Danish Steensen & Varming firm.9 April 1973 Brisbane Sunday Mail, pp 471973, \\"Vagn Pretmark Steensen & Varming’s Man in Australia\\" Australian refrigeration, air conditioning and heating, vol 27, No 1, pp 44-45 Prestmark established Steensen Varming in Australia in 1957 and the company was permanently established in Australia in 1973. Steensen & Varming was not well known in Australia prior to the Sydney Opera House, it was however well established in Europe with offices in Dublin, Belfast, London, Edinburgh and Copenhagen and employed over 500 people by 1973.1973, \\"Vogn Pretmark Steensen & Varming’s Man in Australia\\" Australian refrigeration, air conditioning and heating, Vol. 27, No. 1 pp 44-45 When Utzon resigned from the Sydney Opera House in 1966, Steensen & Varming continued as the mechanical consultants ultimately delivering the design, documentation, contract administration and detailed site supervision of all mechanical, hydraulic and fire protection services, including the controls/supervisory system. Steensen Varming's most known contribution to the Sydney Opera House, was the design for the water heat pump system. The architects and engineers agreed that constructing a boiler chimney stack or a cooling tower, would not be in keeping with the design of the Opera House, which ruled out the two normal approaches for large-scale air conditioning. Steensen Varming provided the design solution in using a heat pump system, which used water from the harbour as the cooling agent. There were three main considerations which led to the design of the Opera House air conditioning as a heat pump system, the availability of the waters of Sydney harbour as a heat sources and sink, the aesthetics and the savings that could be achieved with a water-to-water heat pump. Three pumps draw water from Circular Quay, the water is filtered to remove debris and then passes through tubes and is discharged into the harbour at the opposite side of the Opera House. Fresh water circulates between the heat exchanger shells and the shells of the condenser and evaporators of three centrifugal chillers / heat pump sets.Goldstein H G 1973, \\"Air Conditioning the Sydney Opera House\\" Australian refrigeration, air conditioning and heating, vol 27, No2 pp 12-19 The design innovation and technical expertise demonstrated in this landmark project subsequently led to the awarding of other projects in Australia to the Steensen Varming practice. The engineering construction of the Sydney Opera House was featured in a National Geographic/BBC production hosted Richard Hammond called Engineering Connections. The programme aired in Australia on 13 March 2010. Part of the documentary featured the seawater heat rejection system originally designed by Steensen Varming and assistance on this documentary was provided by Steensen Varming who acted as technical liaison to the production team.

The violin sonata developed from a simple baroque form with no fixed format to a standardised and complex classical form. Since the romantic age some composers have pushed the boundaries of both the classical format as well as the use of the instruments. The early violin sonata In the earliest violin sonatas a bass instrument and the harpsichord played a simple bass line (continuo) with the harpsichord doubling the bass line and fixed chords while the violin played independently. The music was contrapuntal with no fixed format. Georg Philipp Telemann wrote many such sonatas as did Johann Sebastian Bach. Bach later wrote sonatas with harpsichord obbligato, which freed the keyboard instrument from playing only a bass line accompaniment and allowed in to enhance the part of the soloist. The classical sonata form Beethoven's 'Kreutzer' sonata is frequently performed. Mozart was instrumental in the development of the classical violin sonata of which at least 36 are known. Mozart wrote mostly two movement sonatas, generally a fast movement in sonata form and a second, slower movement in various formats. In his later sonatas he added a third fast movement in various formats. Several of his violin sonatas feature a movement in theme and variation format. Beethoven wrote ten violin sonatas throughout his composing career. His sonatas matured in both style and complexity; the Ninth (Kreutzer) Sonata is a work of extreme contrasts. A rendition typically lasts forty minutes and is very demanding on both players. The modern violin sonata Alfred Schnittke with his polystylistic technique, and Hans Werner Henze are noted modern composers of the violin sonata who have all brought about radical reformation of the classical sonata form as well as new technical demands on the performers.

Using the data, the FCC created a list of counties in each state where out-of-market television stations are significantly viewed by residents who are using antennas. Whether or not they are cable or satellite subscribers was not deemed important in their study. The study also looked at the history of viewership of the original Community Access Television (CATV) installations throughout the country, the predecessor of Cable television. Today's cable television content is more focused on premium channel television programming than the original purpose of picking up local programming from television stations in a specific area. Today With the advancement of digital cable, cable providers such as Comcast and Time Warner Cable (now Spectrum) have begun making headway in removing out-of- market television stations from basic cable lineups. This is done by cable providers to preserve bandwidth on channels 2 to 13, but also to reduce the redundancy of multiple network affiliates, and to fulfill federal mandates to keep in-market local affiliates. Some cable providers, with out-of-market and redundant affiliate stations in the past, have moved the out-of-market stations to digital cable channels 100 and above and in the majority of cases, are not transmitted in high definition to allow in-market affiliates the prestige of carrying the programming as intended by their networks rather than the 4:3 cut seen on standard definition feeds. Many cable providers nationwide are not doing this, since they are removing SV stations entirely from the cable lineup. This has led to some controversy in some parts of the country. The forerunners in the SV stations moving over to digital cable have been on- going since 2005 for several Comcast service areas in New Jersey and Virginia, and a few Time Warner Cable systems in North Carolina. The comments against the removals have mainly occurred in significantly viewed counties that are bordering nearby television markets. Significantly viewed channel preservation and CATV Two examples of the SV channel preservation on digital cable and at the same time, CATV favoring a non-designated DMA is Belvidere, New Jersey along the Delaware River. Phillipsburg, Milford, Frenchtown, and Lambertville, all downstream on the Delaware River, sometimes lean towards this as well. Belvidere used to lean towards the Philadelphia market solely on television reception since it was not able to receive New York City area stations. However, since it is located in Warren County, it is officially part of the New York City television market. When cable providers advanced with premium programming and later digital cable service, the Philadelphia stations disappeared from basic cable tiers but KYW-TV, WCAU, and WTXF-TV were later moved to the digital cable tier.Zap2it TV listings guide for Port Murray, NJ Comcast Cable Guide Redundant affiliates An example of redundant affiliates serving the same area is Harrisonburg, Virginia. The Harrisonburg DMA consists of two Virginia counties and one West Virginia county. Harrisonburg is a fringe area because it is from Washington, D.C.; Richmond, Virginia (whose DMA had formerly included Harrisonburg); and Roanoke, Virginia; and approximately away from Charlottesville, Virginia (a separate media market that was also once part of the Richmond DMA). Comcast's Harrisonburg system carries two ABC affiliates (in-market affiliate WHSV-TV and Richmond station WRIC-TV), four NBC affiliates (WVIR out of Charlottesville, WRC-TV out of Washington, D.C., WSLS out of Roanoke, and WWBT out of Richmond), two CBS affiliates (WUSA out of Washington, D.C. and WTVR out of Richmond), and two Fox affiliates (WHSV's second digital subchannel and WTTG out of Washington, D.C.). The Harrisonburg market has only one station for PBS (in-market member station WVPT); the market's other network affiliates are WHSV's MyNetworkTV-affiliated third digital subchannel and a CW-affiliated subchannel of WVIR. Prior to 2006, many of these stations were on the same basic cable tier but were dropped to preserve bandwidth and eliminate the redundancy of multiple affiliates. All of the stations that were not mentioned in the basic cable tier have since been moved over to digital cable.Zap2it TV listings guide for Harrisonburg, VA Comcast Cable Guide A further example of this is in Toledo, Ohio, which is from a major market (Detroit). Most of Detroit's signals penetrate into the Toledo market and traditionally have been carried on Buckeye Broadband. This is similar in situation to Baltimore (which is close to Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.) and Topeka (which is within range of Kansas City's television stations). A significantly viewed, redundant affiliate may be invaluable to a cable television company in a carriage dispute if it has the same network but different local owners. Controversy An example of controversy over residents is losing a long- time out-of-market affiliate station that occurred in Lumberton, North Carolina. For decades, the city has been reliant for NBC coverage from WECT out of Wilmington, North Carolina. Lumberton has been in and out of different DMAs between the Raleigh, Wilmington, and Florence–Myrtle Beach markets. It is currently in the Florence–Myrtle Beach market since the late 1990s. Parts of the market over-the-air or on cable received a different NBC affiliate, whether it was WIS (Columbia, South Carolina), WECT (Wilmington), WCNC (Charlotte), or WCBD (Charleston, South Carolina). The Florence–Myrtle Beach market received its own NBC affiliate in August 2008, when Raycom Media built and signed on WMBF. On the day WMBF launched, cable providers were required to drop sister stations WECT and WIS from cable systems in the market. Lumberton residents who subscribed to Time Warner Cable protested the move and pushed to get WECT back on the cable channel lineup; by coincidence, WMBF, WECT, and WIS were all owned by Raycom, thus the removal would in effect promote WMBF within the home market over its out-of-market sister stations. This was also in addition to the fact that WMBF's over-the-air signal does not even reach the North Carolina side of the Florence–Myrtle Beach market. On December 1, 2008, WECT returned to Time Warner Cable's Lumberton service area on a digital cable tier.Time Warner Cable Guide for Lumberton, NC See also *Must-carry *Retransmission consent *Satellite Home Viewer Act *Cable television in the United States *Digital cable *Syndex ReferencesExternal links * FCC list of significantly viewed stations * FCC Media Bureau links to significantly viewed list Category:Television in the United States Category:United States communications regulation Category:Broadcast law ","title":"Significantly viewed out-of-market television stations in the United States"},{"id":"25847571","text":"HMCS Beacon Hill was a that served in the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) as an ocean convoy escort during the Second World War. She fought primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic. In 1954 she was converted to a and served until 1957. She was named for Victoria, British Columbia, but because was in service with the Royal Navy, the RCN, in an effort to avoid confusion, chose to honour the city by choosing another name associated with it. Beacon Hill was ordered in October 1941 as part of the 1942-43 River-class building programme. She was laid down 16 July 1943 by Yarrows Ltd. at Esquimalt, British Columbia and launched 6 November later that year. Beacon Hill was commissioned 16 May 1944 at Esquimalt. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin- screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the . The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named after towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at . Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River- class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Service history After working up in Bermuda, Beacon Hill was assigned to Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) EG 26, a Canadian support group that would assist any convoy under attack. During her time with EG 26, she was sporadically detached to Plymouth and Portsmouth commands. EG 26 is among the escort groups deployed to counter snorkel-equipped U-boats in British coastal waters beginning in mid- December 1944. Deploying from Derry, the groups operated in overlapping patrols in the Shetland-Faroes narrows, off Hebrides, in the Irish Sea west of Ireland and in St. George's Channel.Rohwer, pp. 378–9 In March 1945, EG 26 deployed from Portsmouth. From at least 14 March to 20 April, Beacon Hill was the Senior Officer's ship of the group.Rohwer, p. 400 She remained in European waters until May 1945, when she departed for Canada. Intended to be used in the ongoing Pacific campaign, Beacon Hill began her tropicalization refit at Liverpool, Nova Scotia in June. The refit ended in November 1945, and she sailed for Esquimalt. Beacon Hill was paid off at Esquimalt on 6 February 1946 and placed in reserve. Post-war service Beacon Hill was recommissioned in March 1950 as a training ship for cadets. In January 1952, Beacon Hill and deployed on a training cruise to South America along the Pacific coast, making several port visits. In May, , Antigonish and Beacon Hill travelled to Juneau, Alaska and in August, to San Diego on training cruises. She was paid off again in 1954 in preparation for her conversion to a Prestonian-class frigate. Beacon Hill was recommissioned into the RCN with the pennant number FFE 303 on 21 December 1957. During service with the Fourth Canadian Escort Squadron she was fitted with a midship deckhouse to provide classroom and training facilities for officer candidates. Beacon Hill was a member of the Fourth Canadian Escort Squadron based out of Esquimalt, British Columbia. In June 1960 the Fourth Canadian Escort Squadron performed a training tour of the Pacific, with stops at Yokohama, Japan, Midway Atoll and Pearl Harbor. They returned to Canada in August. From January to March 1961, , and Beacon Hill performed a training cruise to the South Pacific, visiting Hawaii, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia and Samoa. She served until 15 September 1967 when she was paid off for the final time. She was sold for scrap and broken up at Sakai, Japan in 1968.

Galbraith singles out Yamada's portrayal of \\"fleeting friendships\\" in this film, pointing out, \\"Yamada's camera lingers on little details, especially the sadness of departing trains and the pain of saying goodbye.\\" He points out that the film is also very funny, with Chishū Ryū performing an especially humorous scene as the Buddhist priest.

Crevolin attended Chaffey High School in Ontario, California but by the 1930s was living in Alhambra where he was the exclusive Chrysler-Plymouth factory dealer for the eastern and northern sectors of Los Angeles. His prosperous automobile business led to investments in various enterprises including water resource companies, real estate, and horse racing. In 1950, Andrew Crevolin was appointed a member of the board of directors of the Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute and would become chairman of its Southern California Chapter's fund drive committee for expansion of the Sister Kenny Memorial Hospital in El Monte, California. Andrew Crevolin was the owner of the San Dimas Land & Water Company in San Dimas, California where he owned a home and had substantial land holdings, some of which he would develop for residential housing. In December 1964 he was appointed a member at large for the First Supervisorial District on the Los Angeles Watershed Board. Divorced in February 1962 from his third wife, Jane Anne, on September 24, 1966, Andrew Crevolin married Tony Award-winning actress Dolores Gray. They made their home at his Oak Ridge Ranch near San Dimas in the East San Gabriel Valley. Thoroughbred racing Andrew Crevolin became involved in the sport of Thoroughbred racing during the mid-1940s. In 1948 his filly, Flying Rhythm, trained by future Hall of Fame inductee Frank Childs, won the Hollywood Oaks. His next good runner was Be Fleet who was trained by George Mayberry. Be Fleet's 1951 wins included the San Juan Capistrano Handicap and a three-length win over the great Citation in the Argonaut Handicap. In 1953, George Mayberry was followed as trainer of Crevolin's horses by another future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Bill Molter. Leading owner Crevolin's next top horse was the multiple-stakes- winning four-year-old Imbros, who set a world record for seven furlongs in winning the 1954 Malibu Sequet Stakes at Santa Anita Park and equaled the world record for eight and a half furlongs in winning the 1954 Californian Stakes at Hollywood Park Racetrack. In addition to setting new track records at Santa Anita and Hollywood Park, Imbros twice equaled the Santa Anita Park track record for six furlongs plus he set two track records for eight and nine furlongs at Bay Meadows Racetrack. That same year, Crevolin and Bill Molter enjoyed even greater success with three-year-old Determine. A very small colt, he was overlooked by most bidders at the 1952 Keeneland Summer Sale and was purchased by Crevolin for just $12,000. Determine most notably won the 1954 Santa Anita Derby and then on May 1 won the most prestigious race in the United States, the Kentucky Derby. On the day that Determine won the Derby, Imbros won the William P. Kyne Handicap, making Crevolin the first person in the United States to ever win two $100,000 races on the same day. In a tape- recorded interview with a reporter from the Blood-Horse magazine that was published on August 14, 1954, Crevolin created a storm in the U.S. racing industry when he said, among other things, that his stable didn't always try to win with its young horses in their first few starts. Following hearings into the matter and an apology from Crevolin, he was suspended in September of that year for conduct detrimental to racing and banned through November 2. The ban meant that his horses missed important races. Crevolin remained in racing for several more years. In 1961, his trainer was Edward A. Neloy, who conditioned Mighty Fair to a win in the Ladies Handicap at New York's Aqueduct Racetrack. Crevolin was living in Pasadena, California at the time of his death in 1992. His son, Robert D. Crevolin (1944–2004), was a member of Del Mar Thoroughbred Club for thirty-five years and owned and raced Thoroughbreds for several years.

The site launched on 9 September 2008 and closed 1 December 2016.\\"A Message From iPredict\\" iPredict's system was a prediction market that allowed members to trade contracts (take 'positions') on whether future events would or would not occur. The contracts had judgement criteria that defined how they would be settled. For example, a contract could be called \\"There will be a National Party Prime Minister after the next General Election\\". Other events included financial predictions, such as \\"The NZX50 Gross Index closes equal or higher on Friday 7 December, than the closing price on Thursday 6 December.\\" iPredict facilitated trades between members, but did not participate in trading itself. Traders could either buy (go long on) contracts, indicating that the event would happen or sell (go short on) contracts, indicating the event would not happen. The trading unit was a contract with a settlement value, typically either $0 or $1 and the contract could trade between these values where 1 percent equals $0.01 in value. If the event specified in a given contract occurred, the contract settled at 100 percent or $1; otherwise, the contract settled at 0 or $0 in value. Thus, the current price of the contract could be imputed as the market's global opinion of the probability that the specified event would occur. Traders could trade both before and during an event. iPredict often had a market maker to provide a two way price at almost all times.  Contracts  iPredict provided a wide variety of contracts including many New Zealand political stocks, elections in other countries including the United States, Australia, Britain, Japan, Germany, Brazil, Italy and Spain. They also provided markets in financial market outcomes, Economic indicators in New Zealand, and other leading international economies. There were also stocks related to International Relations, and Science and Technology. Anyone was free to make a suggestion for a stock in the website's forum.  Fees  iPredict charged a Trading Fee of $0.0050 per share traded (50 cents per 100 shares traded). The Trading Fee was capped at 5% of any trade's gross cash value, and capped at $5 per month per user. There was a 1.75% fee on credit card deposits. Users could also make a manual bank deposit which incurs no fee. There was a withdrawal fee of 4% or $2 (whichever is greater) which is levied on withdrawals, but only if a trader has positive earnings on iPredict. In 2011 iPredict proposed a $2.50 monthly account fee as well as a $2.50 sign up fee, however these plans were abandoned after a negative response from traders. Each trading persona was expected (under the stated rules) to control only one account on iPredict, with limited funds of up to $2,500 per six monthly period able to be deposited in each account.  Legal status and technical problems  Under the New Zealand Gambling Act 1993, only the New Zealand Lotteries Commission and the TAB are permitted to accept bets by internet or phone. However, iPredict is authorised by the New Zealand Securities Commission as an authorised futures dealer, so is therefore lawful. This has been met with opposition from the Problem Gambling Foundation. In 2012 the website was hit by a run of technical problems, causing it to operate at greatly reduced speeds and go offline for a number of days at a time on at least two occasions. This caused problems for iPredict commercially for its deal with Exceltium. By 2014, and during the leadup to the general election, the approximately weekly reports on the status of the political contracts were reported as at a random time by Exceltium, on a pro bono basis. Exceltium is a Wellington-based corporate and public affairs consultancy, majority owned by right-wing political lobbyist, Matthew Hooton. The gaming of iPredict by National Party members was specifically noted by Nicky Hager in his book \\"Dirty Politics\\", which was released in August 2014. http://salient.org.nz/2014/09/ipredict-or-ipromote/.  Closure  On 26 November 2015, iPredict announced it would be winding up its New Zealand operations. According to the company's website, as Associate Minister of Justice Simon Bridges declined an application from iPredict for an exemption to the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act, the prediction market was no longer legally able to operate in its current form. Despite the average net worth of an iPredict trader of $41, iPredict noted that Minister Bridges believed the prediction market posed \\"a legitimate money laundering risk.\\" In a statement, Bridges said anti-money laundering legislation created obligations for businesses to check customers' identities and report suspicious transactions. > \\"The main reason for declining the application was that Predictions Clearing > Limited [iPredict] does not identify its customers, which creates an > opportunity to use the iPredict market to launder illicit funds. The > customers can deposit and withdraw funds from their accounts, including from > overseas. Deposit restrictions apply, but these can be circumvented by > setting up multiple user accounts, as the customers' identities are not > verified.\\" Subsequent to the closure notice date, no new funds or traders were allowed onto the iPredict site, but it continued to operate within the pool of existing accounts and funds still invested, for twelve months. This placed some doubt on its accuracy in predicting the outcomes of political events, for example. On the evening of 30 November 2016, all trading was suspended, and traders were informed through a website notice, the option of withdrawing funds remaining in their account, or donating the funds to Victoria University. iPredict reported exploring the possibility of \\"transferring our prediction activities to be included on PredictIt in the US\\".

Volume 1-2 (Revised Edition) New South Wales University Press. The Sydney metropolitan area is transitional with regions such as the greater west (or the Cumberland Plain) being virtually excluded from this biome since they predominantly contain dry sclerophyll woodlands and thus would have more in common with Mediterranean forests.Earth Resource Analysis PL 1998, Cumberland Plains Woodland: Trial Aerial Photographic interpretation of remnant woodlands, Sydney. Unpublished report prepared for NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service – Sydney Zone. Though pockets of forested areas in Sydney, such as those in The Hills Shire to the north and Sutherland Shire to the south, which are relatively wet and therefore lush, do have regions within them that are part of Eastern Australian temperate forests.Benson D and Howell J 1990, Taken for granted: the bushland of Sydney and its suburbs. Kangaroo Press, Kenthurst, NSW.Young B and Young A 2006, Understanding the Scenery: The Royal National Park with Heathcote National Park. Envirobook, Annandale NSW. Eucalyptus communities meandering the coast in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales are usually wet sclerophyll wet forests, ranging from 30 percent to 70 percent closed canopy cover, with the understorey containing small broadleaved trees, vines, ferns and shrubs. Wet forests are strictly confined in southeastern Queensland. Subtropical rainforest is the most developed community in New South Wales, growing in warm, fecund sites having rainfall higher than 1,300 mm per year. Dry rainforests occur in sites with lower rainfall, ranging from 600 mm to 1,100 mm annual rainfall. Dry rainforest was distributed in southeastern Queensland where it occupied about half a million hectares, though it has now been broadly cleared for agriculture. Warm temperate rainforest is far less diverse than the dry or subtropical region, growing on low-nutrient soils. Mostly found to the southern half of the ecoregion in Sydney (parts of Hornsby Shire and Sutherland Shire), it has transitional elements of Mediterranean vegetation due to abundant of dry sclerophyll plants surrounding it, which are prevalent communities in western Sydney.Floyd, A.G. 1990a. Australian Rainforests in New South Wales. Volume 1. Surrey Beatty & Sons, Chipping Norton, Australia. The rainforest communities of this region exhibit ecological relations to other regions: the cool temperate rainforest is similar to the biome found in Tasmania, the warm temperate rainforest has links to the North Island of New Zealand, and the subtropical and dry regions are also found up north in the Queensland tropical rain forests ecoregion. The Blue Mountains area has over 90 eucalypt taxa, or 13% of the global dispersion.Glanznig, A. 1995.

Biodiversity Series, Paper No.6. Biodiversity Unit, Department of the Environment, Sport, and Territories, Canberra, Australia. Climate These are areas of eucalyptus forest on sandstone plateau, with smaller sections of cliffs, steep gorges with rainforest vegetation and sandy heath on the coasts. The climate is oceanic to the south and humid subtropical to the north. In the central areas of the Blue Mountains, rainfall averages from 1,100 to 1,400 mm annually. Climate in the coastal regions is humid, with excessive rainfall (1200 mm to 1600 mm a year). Rainfall decreases as one moves inland to the New England region with Armidale receiving around 800 mm of rain each year on average. Winters in that city are cold and wet and higher elevations receive snowfall most years.Climate of Australia Further north in the Border Ranges, monthly summer temperatures vary from 21.5C maximum to 19.7C minimum. Corresponding winter temperatures from Mount Tamborine in the Border Ranges vary from 17.8C maximum to 12.3C minimum. Throughout the ecoregion, rainfall is concentrated in the summer. Towards the north of the ecoregion rainfall is lower (750 mm to 1100 mm per year) and more seasonal. Flora Brisbane Water National Park in the Central Coast near Gosford, New South Wales. The dominant forest is peppermint eucalyptus trees, indeed it was the moisture from these trees which was originally thought to cause the blue mist that gave the mountains their name. Shrublands, shrubby woodlands (heaths), and affiliated sandplain vegetation are typical of the region's coastal area. The shrub species include, Epacridaceae, Myrtaceae, Rutaceae, Fabaceae, Proteaceae, and Cyperaceae. The Border Ranges is home to more than 1,200 vascular plants. A variety of eucalyptus trees dominate areas of this large ecoregion, including: in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales (such as in around such as the Northern Tablelands) - tallowwood (Eucalyptus microcorys), blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis), brush box (Lophostemon confertus), flooded gum (Eucalyptus grandis), and Gympie messmate (Eucalyptus cloeziana); southern New South Wales - Sydney blue gum (Eucalyptus saligna), the grey ironbark (Eucalyptus paniculata), and blackbutt; and on the New South Wales coast a stringybark (Eucalyptus eugenioides). Trees in the warm temperate forests include coachwood (Ceratopetalum apetalum), sassafras (Doryphora sassafras), and lillypilly (Acmena smithii) Typical trees in cool temperate forests include, Eucryphia moorei and Antarctic beech.McDonald, W.J.F., and P. Adams. 1995. Border Ranges. Pages 462 – 466 in S. D. Davis, V.H. Heywood and A.C. Hamilton, editors, Centres of plant diversity. Volume 2. Asia, Australasia, and the Pacific. WWF/IUCN, IUCN Publications Unit, Cambridge, UK. There are particularly rich collections of endemic plants in a number of areas: the eucalyptus of the Blue Mountains; the rainforests of Border Ranges area in the McPherson Range including Mount Warning, Nightcap National Park, and Lamington National Park including Binna Burra; and the sand dunes of World Heritage Site Fraser Island and the Great Sandy National Park of southern Queensland. There are well-known areas of rainforest protected as the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia, containing distinct areas of subtropical rainforest in New South Wales, dry rainforest of southern Queensland (although most of this has been cleared for agriculture and pine plantations) and warm temperate rainforest south of Sydney. Finally the coasts are covered with shrubs, heath and other sand dune vegetation.McDonald, W.J.F., and J.A. Elsol, 1984. Moreton Region Vegetation Map series, Summary report for Caloundra, Brisbane, Beenleigh, Murwillumbah sheets. Botany Branch, Queensland Department of Primary Industries. Fauna Local wildlife includes velvet worms and koalas, while the birds of the forest include kookaburra kingfishers, gang-gang cockatoos, crimson rosellas and striated thornbills and a number of threatened birds including red goshawk (Erythrotriorchis radiatus), swift parrot (Lathamus discolor), regent honeyeater (Xanthomyza phrygia), Albert's lyrebird (Menura alberti), and eastern bristlebird (Dasyornis brachypterus). Overall , upwards of 60 reptiles, 65 mammals, and 275 birds have been transcribed in the Blue Mountains. The broad-headed snake and the stuttering frog also exist in the region.Nix H.A. 1993.

Birds and their habitats. Conference Proceedings, Queensland Ornithological Society Inc., Brisbane. Threats and preservation These habitats are vulnerable to ongoing clearance for agriculture and urban development and by fires, while introduced species both weeds and animals, and pollution of water supplies threaten the indigenous wildlife. However, controlled logging of tallowwood, Sydney blue gum, spotted gum, blackbutt, and flooded gum does sustain large areas of these indigenous trees as well as formally protected areas such as those mentioned above and Royal National Park near to Sydney which contains a number of the different habitats described here. Urban areas in this ecoregion include Sydney and Brisbane while resort areas like North Stradbroke Island and Ballina attract visitors to the coast.

Yang is currently deputy chief of the Fourth Hospital of Linyi (Linyi Mental Hospital), in the Shandong province of China. He runs the Internet Addiction Treatment Center at the hospital. According to media reports, families of teenaged patients sent to the hospital paid CNY 5,500 (US$805) per month to be treated using a combination of psychiatric medication and ECT, which Yang dubbed as \\"xingnao\\" (, brain-waking) treatment. He treated 3000 children before the practice was prohibited by the Chinese Ministry of Health. Yang claimed that 96% of his patients had shown signs of improvement, a figure that was questioned by the Chinese media. Since the ban, Yang has used 'low-frequency pulse therapy', a treatment of his own devising alleged by former patients to be more painful than ECT. In 2016, the center claimed to have treated more than 6000 adolescents. Early life Yang was born in June 1962 in the Chinese city of Linyi, Shandong province. He graduated from Yishui Medical School, a vocational school in Yishui, Shandong, with a degree in Clinical Medicine in 1982. Internet addiction treatment Yang was assigned by the state to the Fourth Hospital of Linyi (also known as Linyi Mental Hospital), where he specialized in treating schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. He wrote a series of columns on popular psychology for the local newspaper during his tenure at Linyi Mental Hospital, although his critics alleged the columns were paid advertisements for the hospital. On 29 September 1997, Yang received the honor of becoming a Top 10 Underage Protector in Shandong for his work treating Internet addiction disorder in teenagers. In 2008, Yang became the director of the Internet Addiction Treatment Center, and began to practice electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). In 2009, he was awarded an allowance from the State Council. On 7 May 2009, the China Youth Daily reported that Yang and the treatment center were under investigation. According to Yang, he began to investigate Internet addiction in 1999 when his teenage son began to show \\"addictive behavior\\". Yang began practicing ECT as early as 2006. Initially, Chinese media viewed his work with great enthusiasm, publishing a book called Fighting the Internet Demon (, ) and producing a documentary film by the same name. Yang was awarded the Top Ten Outstanding Citizens for Protecting the Minors of Shandong by the Shandong provincial government in 2007. Yang caused widespread controversy in China when its most viewed television channel, the state-run China Central Television (CCTV), aired a special about Yang's treatment center in July 2008. The program, titled Fighting the Internet Demon: Who Turned Our Geniuses into Beasts, reported positively on Yang's ECT therapy and sharply criticized the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) World of Warcraft, then popular in China and blamed for many teenagers' purported Internet addiction. The program initially caused an uproar in China's World of Warcraft community, a sentiment that later spread to most of China's Internet community. Yang's critics revealed some of his most controversial practices, which led to the mainstream media abandoning their praise of his treatment center. Nevertheless, Yang went on to win a State Council grant for excellence in medical science in February 2009. In May 2009, China Youth Daily, a leading state-run newspaper in China, published a highly negative investigative report on Yang's practices, which received coverage on both the CCTV and other prominent Chinese media, eventually leading to coverage in Science. CCTV-12, in particular, aired a segment featuring a young adult who was drugged by his parents, brought to Yang's clinic and received an hour of ECT. The controversy eventually led to the Chinese Ministry of Health issuing a ban on Yang's use of electroconvulsive therapy. In August, CCTV aired its own investigative report, further questioning the ethics of Yang's treatment center. The report alleged that Yang had received CNY 81 million (US$12.73 million) from his treatment center. Treatment program In the controversial July 2008 CCTV coverage of Yang's treatment center, he claimed that patients with alleged Internet addiction suffered from \\"cognitive and personality disorders\\". Yang promoted electroconvulsive therapy as a means to remedy such disorders. According to an investigative report, Yang's patients ranged from 12刘明银《战网魔》第三章 网络公主的杏花春雨（1） to 30 years of age. Most of them were abducted by their parents or the \\"Special Operations\\", an informal branch of the treatment center that consisted of parents and more senior patients, who were rewarded for their participation in abducting new patients. The parents (even those of adult patients) would then sign a contract with the treatment center placing the patients into foster care by the treatment center. After they were admitted, Yang's patients were allegedly placed into a prison-like environment, where they were forced to reveal all of their online accounts and passwords. Reports also show Yang managing his patients in a military manner, encouraging patients to act as his informants and threatening resisting patients with ECT, which former patients claimed he used solely as a means of torturing them. In addition to electroconvulsive therapy, Yang used psychotropic drugs, including diazepam, paroxetine, and buspirone, without the consent of patients or their parents, claiming that the drugs were \\"dietary supplements\\". The center also had mandatory sessions with psychiatric counselors, where patients were taught obedience to Yang, whom they were forced to call \\"Uncle Yang\\". Yang also warned patients against asking their parents to take them home, another offense punishable by ECT. After his use of electroconvulsive therapy was banned, Yang continues to practice using another therapeutic method he invented, known as \\"low-frequency pulse therapy\\", which is alleged by former patients to be more painful than ECT therapy. Controversies=Unethical treatment controversy Electroconvulsive therapy at Yang's treatment center was performed in \\"Room 13\\" (later renamed the \\"Behavioral Correction Therapy Room\\" after media scrutiny). Yang claimed that ECT therapy \\"is only painful for those with Internet addiction\\" and that the therapeutic machines used \\"lowered electric current\\". Investigative reports questioned whether Yang's use of ECT without anesthesia or muscle relaxants on minors, whose informed consent was not obtained, was in violation of the WHO guidelines on electroconvulsive therapy. Reports further accuse Yang of using the therapy as a means of torture. Although ECT had been regulated in some areas in China, Shandong province did not have regulations regarding the therapy. In response, Yang's supporters claimed that ECT was not the primary form of treatment and that psychiatric counseling was emphasized at the center. Yang stated that admitted patients were shocked only a few times during their treatment. Yang maintained that he was properly licensed in performing ECT, and that his treatment program was fully compliant with Chinese laws and regulations regarding clinical psychology. Reports also state that Yang applied electric shock to patients' hands, a non-indicated usage that is said to produce more pain, as a punitive measure. Safety of therapy In 2009, China Youth Daily publicized the news of a patient who escaped from Yang's treatment center. He jumped from a second-floor window at the treatment center. The report alleged that Yang's ECT therapy triggered cardiac arrhythmia in the escaped patient, questioning the safety of Yang's therapy. Legality of therapy Some commentators called Yang's practice a violation of patients' basic human rights. Critics contend that Yang's abduction of his patients and use of electroconvulsive therapy may have violated Chinese laws on the protection of minors and may have constituted aggravated assault. Critics maintain that Yang's failure to obtain informed consent may also be in violation of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, which China has signed but not ratified. The machine Yang used for ECT treatments is a DX-IIA ECT device, manufactured by a Shanghai pharmaceutical company from 1996 to 2000. The manufacturer warned of impaired cognition as a side effect. Chinese health regulation had stopped the device from being manufactured since 2000, and reports brought into question whether Yang acquired these devices illegally. Clinical trial controversy In 2006, Yang claimed to have invented a formula of Chinese traditional medicine that is effective in treating Internet addiction. Yang applied for a patent for his formula, although the Chinese State Intellectual Property Office has not responded to his application. Yang's patent application claims that he had conducted a clinical trial with 300 patients at his treatment center, and that all 300 patients were \\"completely cured of their addiction by the medication\\". The patients' informed consent was not sought, and minors as young as 14 years of age were involved in the clinical trial. Diagnostic standard Critics have raised questions about Yang diagnostic standard, claiming that he would admit anyone brought to his treatment center. Yang's published \\"diagnostic test\\" is criticized as remarkably lax, as almost any choices on the test will be diagnosed as Internet addiction. In July 2009, celebrity Chinese scholar and anti-pseudoscience crusader Fang Zhouzi published an essay that criticized the notion of Internet addiction and questioned the ethics of electroconvulsive therapy without anesthesia. Government ban In July 2009, the Chinese Ministry of Health issued an official ban on the use of electroconvulsive therapy in treating Internet addiction, citing a lack of evidence as to its effectiveness. However, Yang's treatment center continued to operate after the ban by providing \\"low-frequency-pulse electronic acupuncture\\" instead of ECT; critics protested that Yang's new therapeutic methods were designed to torture patients and called for an end to Yang's practice altogether. The controversy reheats In August 2016, a blog article \\"Yang Yongxin, a devil still at large\\" was posted on WeChat and Sina Weibo, and later made its way into Tencent News. By providing a description of Yang, his therapy, and the government ban, the article re-ignited controversies around Yang, leading to an interview of former patients by China Youth Daily. Justice Online, a news site run by the Supreme People's Procuratorate, also reported on deaths and injuries caused by shocks in Yang- style treatments. However, Linyi's local health commission considers Yang's method legitimate; in addition, Yang claimed \\"governmental support\\" for his center. In October 2016, a proposed draft of Regulation on the Online Protection of Minors which refers to terms on controlling Internet addiction was released for public commenting. In response, Justice Online called for a clear definition of \\"Internet addiction\\" as well as respect for minors' rights. In October 2018, a video showing a patient crying after being treated at the Fourth Hospital of Linyi was posted on Sina Weibo. Public concern about Yang's treatment center's existence reheated. Linyi's local health commission later responded that the individual was \\"an eight-year-old autism patient\\" and noted that the Yang's treatment center has been closed since August 2016. The video was later deleted by the publisher under order of police; the publisher publicly apologized for \\"leading an bad influence to the Fourth Hospital of Linyi\\". According to The Paper, a Chinese news report website, the hospital has removed words describing the center such as \\"网戒中心\\" (disciplinary center). The source also noted the hospital's introduction to Yang said he is good at \\"curing Internet Addiction and personality abnormal, preventing adolescence's dangerous behavior, curing problem family\\", despite the controversies. Dead by Daylight In 2017, the survival horror video game Dead by Daylight added a new downloadable content pack called \\"Spark of Madness\\". It featured a new map (Lery's Memorial Institute) based on Yang's hospital, a new killer who is a doctor with the power to shock survivors, manipulating them mentally, and a new survivor (Feng Min) who is a former e-sports player. It is believed that this character is based on Yang as an earlier character selection poll chose him to be the next character.

Background Bred in the United States, he is a gelded son of multiple Grade I winner Royal Anthem and the unraced mare, Princesa's Passion, who comes from an extended family of stakes winning horses. Racing career Presious Passion's career has included wins in the United Nations Stakes (twice) and the Clement L. Hirsch Turf Championship Stakes and a second-place finish in the 2009 Breeders' Cup Turf. Presious Passion was one of three Eclipse Award finalists for older turf horse in 2009, losing to Gio Ponti (horse). The 2009 Breeders' Cup Turf earned him international respect. He opened up ten lengths and set fractions of 45 flat for the half mile and 1:09 1/5 for three quarters of a mile, unusually fast for a mile and a half race. Defending champion Conduit won the race by half a length. American turf writer Steve Haskin has described this as one of the best losing performances in Breeders' Cup history. Presious Passion is considered exceptional for this style of running. Longer turf races are often won in a final dash in which closing speed is more important than early speed. Presious Passion, however, has become well known for his speed from the gate. According to trainer Mary Hartmann and regular rider Elvis Trujillo, he refuses to rate and they let him run his own race. He often distances himself from the field by up to 20 lengths, as he did in the 2009 United Nations, and then fights in the stretch, either tiring from his early efforts or prevailing. Because of his unpredictable style, he has developed a strong fan base. Hartmann has said, \\"He is not a cheap suitcase. He doesn't fold.\\" Presious Passion competed in the $5 million Dubai Sheema Classic (UAE-I) on March 27 in Dubai, finishing last. Since then, he has failed to return to his 2009 form, losing 3 straight races. Some attributed his 2010 form to the so- called \\"Dubai Bounce\\", the name given to the tendency for American thoroughbreds to regress in form due to the stress of traveling to and from the spring Dubai World Cup championship races at Meydan Racecourse. Others have suggested that he was no longer able to carry his speed as well as in previous years.

Between 1972 and 1993 he and Leo Martin formed a comic duo called Gaston and Leo. Youth Gaston Berghmans was the eldest son in a family with two children. His sister, Paula, is four years younger and has lived in the U.S. since 1959. Berghmans's father was an independent diamond cutter, his mother worked as an assistant in her sister's butcher shop. Early career He performed at the Ancienne Belgique concert hall. He married in 1960; his daughter was born in 1961. Early film career In the late 1950s he also appeared in several films directed by Flemish comic Jan Vanderheyden: * Een zonde waard \\"Worth a sin\\" * Den duivel te slim \\"Too smart for the devil\\" * Hoe zotter hoe liever \\"The crazier the better\\" * De stille genieter \\"The quiet enjoyer\\" They were all successful in Flanders and increased Gaston's reputation and work efforts. Gaston and Leo Gaston first met Leo Martin in 1957 in the Billiard Palace, where the orchestra of Willy Rockin played. Martin played the saxophone and clarinet and Gaston performed sketches with him. In the 1960s Martin got his own orchestra and it became easier to invite Gaston to come perform sketches. Their performances were often comic prologues for Martin's musical moments. These performances were the foundation for what would be later evolve into their double act Gaston and Leo. In 1972 Martin's band broke up and the two men became a successful comedic duo. BRT From 1972 Gaston and Leo also appeared on the state-owned Belgische Radio- en Televisieomroep (BRT) television network, including some New Year's Eve special broadcasts. They also made four films together: The boat to Spain (1982) (director: Willy Vanduren), Thugs (1984) (director: Robbe De Hert), The Panic Sowers (1986) (director: Patrick Lebon) and Gaston en Leo in Hong Kong (1988) (director: Paul Cammermans). VTM They left BRT for commercial broadcaster vtm (Vlaamse Televisie Maatschappij). Both comedians had health problems. Berghmans got cancer and had to walk around with a stoma. Martin got lung cancer and died on 18 March 1993. Six months earlier they had appeared in the VTM show 20 years of Gaston and Leo which was presented by Luc Appermont. After Martin's death Martin's death was a severe blow to Berghmans and his partner was irreplaceable. On the occasion of his 80th birthday on 6 December 2006 VTM aired a program titled Gaston 80. In 2008 he appeared in the movie Christmas in Paris. The film was an artistic disappointment and a commercial flop. In 2005 he finished at No. 459 in the Flemish version of The Greatest Belgian, outside the official nomination list. In 2006 King Albert II awarded Berghmans the title Commander in the Order of the Crown. On 27 March 2009 Gaston Berghmans received the Flemish TV Stars Career Star 2009 during a Flemish Television Academy gala. Film career * Christmas in Paris (2008) * Dief! (1998) ....

They are commonly implemented in imperative programming languages. C-like languages feature two versions (pre- and post-) of each operator with slightly different semantics. In languages syntactically derived from B (including C and its various derivatives), the increment operator is written as \`++\` and the decrement operator is written as \`--\`. Several other languages use inc(x) and dec(x) functions. The increment operator increases, and the decrement operator decreases, the value of its operand by 1. The operand must have an arithmetic or pointer data type, and must refer to a modifiable data object. Pointers values are increased (or decreased) by an amount that makes them point to the next (or previous) element adjacent in memory. In languages that support both versions of the operators: * The pre-increment and pre-decrement operators increment (or decrement) their operand by 1, and the value of the expression is the resulting incremented (or decremented) value. * The post-increment and post- decrement operators increase (or decrease) the value of their operand by 1, but the value of the expression is the operand's value prior to the increment (or decrement) operation. In languages where increment/decrement is not an expression (e.g., Go), only one version is needed (in the case of Go, post operators only). Since the increment/decrement operator modifies its operand, use of such an operand more than once within the same expression can produce undefined results. For example, in expressions such as \`x - ++x\`, it is not clear in what sequence the subtraction and increment operations should be performed. Such expressions generally invoke undefined behavior, and should be avoided. Examples The following C code fragment illustrates the difference between the pre and post increment and decrement operators: int x; int y; // Increment operators // Pre-increment: x is incremented by 1, then y is assigned the value of x x = 1; y = ++x; // x is now 2, y is also 2 // Post- increment: y is assigned the value of x, then x is incremented by 1 x = 1; y = x++; // y is 1, x is now 2 // Decrement operators // Pre-decrement: x is decremented by 1, then y is assigned the value of x x = 1; y = --x; // x is now 0, y is also 0 // Post-decrement: y is assigned the value of x, then x is decremented by 1 x = 1; y = x--; // y is 1, x is now 0 In languages lacking these operators, equivalent results require an extra line of code: # Pre- increment: y = ++x x = 1 x = x + 1 # x is now 2 (can be written as \\"x += 1\\" in Python) y = x # y is also 2 # Post-increment: y = x++ x = 1 y = x # y is 1 x = x + 1 # x is now 2 The post-increment operator is commonly used with array subscripts. For example: // Sum the elements of an array float sum_elements(float arr[], int n) { float sum = 0.0; int i = 0; while (i < n) sum += arr[i++]; // Post-increment of i, which steps // through n elements of the array return sum; } The post-increment operator is also commonly used with pointers: // Copy one array to another void copy_array(float *src, float *dst, int n) { while (n-- > 0) // Loop that counts down from n to zero *dst++ = *src++; // Copies element *(src) to *(dst), // then increments both pointers } Note that these examples also work in other C-like languages, such as C++, Java, and C#. *Increment operator can be demonstrated by an example: #include int main() { int c=2, d=2; printf(\\"%d \\", c++); // this statement displays 2, then c is incremented by 1 to 3. printf(\\"%d\\", ++c); // this statement increments c by 1, then c is displayed. return 0; } **Output: 2 4 Supporting languages The following list, though not complete or all- inclusive, lists some of the major programming languages that support the \`++\`/\`--\` increment/decrement operators. * ABAP * AWK * Bash * C * C++ * C# * CFML * D * Go * Java * JavaScript * Objective-C * GNU Octave * PARI/GP * Perl * PHP * PowerShell * Vala * Vex, a scripting language in the software Houdini * Wolfram Language (Apple's Swift once supported these operators, but support was removed as of version 3.) Pascal, Delphi, Modula-2, and Oberon provide the same functions, but they are called inc(x) and dec(x). History The concept was introduced in the B programming language circa 1969 by Ken Thompson. > Thompson went a step further by inventing the ++ and -- operators, which > increment or decrement; their prefix or postfix position determines whether > the alteration occurs before or after noting the value of the operand.

It is located on the right bank of Betwa River and to the west of Lalitpur hills. It is known for Gupta monuments and for many ancient monuments of Hindu and Jain origins inside and outside the walls of the fort. The Gupta temple dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu, popularly known as the Dashavatara Temple and dated to the 6th-century CE,Alexander Lubotsky (1996), The Iconography of the Viṣṇu Temple at Deogarh and the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa, Ars Orientalis, Vol. 26, The Smithsonian Institution and Department of the History of Art, pp. 65-80 is the earliest known Panchyatana temple in North India. The fort on the hill is dominated by a cluster of Jain temples on its eastern part, the oldest of these dating to the 8th or 9th century. Apart from Jain temples, the wall frescoes of Jain images of \\"iconographic and the stylistic variety\\", are special features of the fort. The three ghats (ghat means \\"flight of stone steps leading to the river\\"), which provide approach to the Betwa river edge from the fort – the Nahar Ghat, the Rajghat and the ghat with the Siddh ki Ghufa (saints cave) – are also of archeological significance. The Deogarh monuments are protected by the Department of Archaeology of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), and managed through its Northern Circle Office located in Agra. ASI maintain an archaeological museum at the Deogarh site, which is noted for its treasured archaeological sculptures.Studies in south Asian culture, p. 7 Etymology \\"Deogarh\\" derives from the Sanskrit Deo and garh, \\"God\\" and \\"fort\\", compounded to mean \\"fort of the Gods\\". This term, \\"House of God\\", is also widely used as a place name for villages in the vicinity of temples within fort-walls throughout India.Titze p.103 Geography Deogarh village, which has an area of , lies on the right bank of the Betwa River, at the point where it joins the reservoir formed by the Rajghat Dam. The village also has two rock cut valleys known as Nahar Ghati (ghati means \\"valley\\") and Raj Ghati on its southern side along the river. The village is at the western end of the Lalitpur hill range, situated south-east from Lalitpur town in Lalitpur district, south of the divisional administrative centre at Jhansi, and 235 km from Gwalior. The nearest railway station is away at Jhaklon. The village has an average elevation of . The fort of Deogarh is in a valley which generally has a gentle slope. The valley is formed by the Betwa River at the western end of the hills of the Vindhya Range. Known earlier as Vetravati (Sanskrit, meaning \\"containing reeds\\"), the Betwa River is a tributary of the Yamuna River, and skirts the fort hill on its southern side. The river, flowing at a bend near the fort, has a rocky bed. It flows in a cascade of deep pools with steep rocky banks of sandstone formations. The fort is located on a precipice of the steep cliff, just above the river on its right bank.Titze pp. 102–103 Demographics According to the 2011 Census, the population of the Deogarh village was 783 spread over 152 households. Hindi and Bundeli are the languages spoken in the area. The distribution of male and female population was 406 and 377 respectively. The village had the presence of 331 Schedule Tribe population (165 male and 166 female) and one male of Schedule Caste. The literacy rate recorded was 377 persons (211 male and 110 female). History Deogarh's strategic location in Northern India on the ancient route to the Deccan Plateau made it a historically important place. It was part of the Bundelkhand region which had trade and cultural links with the Deccan. Its antiquarian, archaeological and epigraphical importance are linked to the Gupta period, the Gurjara- Prathiharas during the 9th century (an inscription dated 862 found on the Shantinath temple attests this), the Chandela rulers in the 11th century, Gonds, the Muslim rulers of Delhi, the Marathas and the British eras.Studies in south Asian culture, pp.31, 62-69 During the Jaina period temples were built in the Nagara style of architecture from 8th to 9th centuries extending to 17th century AD. In the Siddha-ki gufa (cave) near Raj Ghati valley inscriptions dated from 1285 to 1751 have been found. The earliest religious influence in the Deogarh area can be traced to the Gupta period (320-550), (on the basis of an inscription on the Nahar Ghati) known as the \\"golden period\\" of Indian history. This was followed by the Jain period between the 8th and 17th centuries, where innumerable temples have been traced. The Shantinath Temple (right) in the Jain temple complex in 1918 before restoration The present village's history has not been examined at depth, even though many inscriptions have been located in the fort and the valley, relating to various stylistic and palaeographical denominations. Although the dynasties who ruled over the territory are known, who built what is not clear, except for the Jain temples, which were built by the merchant Jain community. More archaeological explorations would therefore be essential, to establish the linkages of building activities with the dynasties who ruled over the territory, considering the enormous amount of Hindu and Jain temple remains and artifacts found here. The earliest history of Deogarh is that of the architectural evolution traced to the ancient Gupta period, which flourished between the 4th and 6th centuries in Northern India. During this period, the arts, science and literature saw aesthetic evolution. It was the period when Brahminical, Buddhist and Jain activities flourished. During this time, sculptural arts peaked and \\"India entered upon the classical phase of sculpture\\". Even though Guptas were Hindu rulers, the cultures of Buddhism and Jainism also flourished during their reign. During this period, Buddhist sculptures were more puritanical with total elimination of nudity in its depictions. However, transparent tight fitting drapery were dictated by moral values and hence, were restrained. Indian temple architecture emerged with figurine sculptures in decorative settings, attaining excellence of form. This is inferred from the large panel of Sheshashayi Vishnu (Hindu god Vishnu reclining on the serpent Shesha) at the Deogarh temple. Monuments The Deogarh monuments can be categorized based on their location at valley and fort temples, which are generally built with sand stones of brick-red colour. The valley temples are mostly Hindu temples from the Gupta period near the Deogarh village. Jain temple complex Pārśva and other tirthankaras from Jainism depicted on a panel in the Shantinath Temple Pārśva and Supārśva The fort temples are dominated by the Jain temples in the eastern part of the hill fort; the Jaina images here are mostly of the \\"iconographic and the stylistic variety\\".The Jain complex was built during 8th to the 17th century and consist of 31 Jain temples housing around 2,000 sculptures which is largest such collection in world.http://www.uptourism.gov.in/pages/top/explore/top-explore-jhansi--- deogarh/jain-temple The Jain temples have a large number of panels depicting scenes from Jain mythology, tirthankara images and votive tablets. The pillars are carved with a thousand Jain figures. All temples are categorized into two distinct periods: the early medieval period and the medieval period. During the Islamic iconoclastic depredations the temples were devastated; this was compounded by the growth of vegetation and neglect of maintenance. The Jain community is managing the temples since 1939 and have done some restoration work.Titze pp.103-105 The extravagance of the intricacies of the Jain sculptures are similar to that of nearby Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh and adjoining areas of Bihar.Titze p.105 Jain sculptures lie scattered on both sides of the path from the gate, on the walls of the fort. A notable pillar seen here is called the Manastambha. The complete image of each of the 24 tirthankaras depicting the emblem of a bird, flower or animal are seen here. Images of Yaksha and Yakshini are also part of such depictions. Thousands of sculptures are seen embedded in the walls surrounding the complex. The large number of idols lying scattered around the fort area is attributed to the fact that this was the sculptors' workshop. Worship at some of the Jain temples are still held regularly. The most famous of the Jain temples in the fort is the Shantinath temple, which was built before 862 AD. This temple committee oversees the protection of the monuments and work to improve the ambience of the entire place. It has been suggested however, that restoration works be carried out on more scientific terms, following guidelines set by UNESCO's World Heritage Sites.Titze p.105-106 Dashavatara temple The \\"Dashavatara Temple\\" or \\"Gupta Temple\\", built in 400-500 AD, is one of the oldest Hindu temple that is still existent until modern era. The temple dedicated to god Vishnu, was first discovered by Captain Charles Strahan. It was given its name by the archaeologist, Cunnigham. Archaeologists have inferred that it is the earliest known Panchayatana temple in North India. It was subsequently renamed by Cunningham as Dashavatara Mandir or Dashavatara Temple (because the temple depicts ten incarnations of Vishnu), and also as Sagar Marh (meaning: the temple by the well). It was the first North Indian temple with a shikhara or tower, although the shikhara is curtailed and part of it has disappeared. The temple has a high plinth and is set with a basement porch. The Dashavatara temple has a \\"compelling presence\\" in spite of its dilapidated condition. Sculpted panels are seen on the terraced basement, with carved figurines of river goddesses Ganga and Yamuna flanking the doorway to the sanctum sanctorum. In addition, on the side walls, three large carved panels of Vaishnava mythology related to Gajendra Moksha, the Nara Narayana Tapasya (austerities), and the Sheshashayi Vishnu (reclining on the serpent), are portrayed. A protective wall made of undressed stone was built around the temple after it was first discovered. However, the idol of the sanctum sanctorum of the temple is missing, believed to have been relocated elsewhere.Studies in south Asian culture, p.29 The ancient treatise Vishnudharmottara Purana describes several temples including a \\"Sarvatobhadra temple\\", which has been identified by archaeologists and Indologists with the Dashavatara Temple.Lubotsky pp. 2–3 Fort The fort on the hill is located a few hundred yards east of Deogarh village. The fort, when originally built, was known as 'Karnali'. Subsequently, it was renamed \\"Kirtigiridurga\\" after it was built in 1057 (samvat 1154) during the reign of Chandela king Kirttivarman. However, some believe that fort was built earlier by the Pratihara rulers of Kannauj in the 9th century, changed hands from the builders to the Chandelas and the Bundelas, before it came under the control of the Scindias of Gwalior.Studies in south Asian culture, p.28 The fort has an external wall for the most part, except in stretches where the steep hill slopes towards the Betwa river. It is also subdivided by many internal walls. A circular structure, the west gate and the east gate (south-east of the Jain temples) are notable monuments. Additionally, there are two gates of entry into the fort, the \\"Hathi Darvaja\\" meaning \\"Elephant gate\\", and \\"Delhi Darvaja\\" which means \\"Delhi gate\\". There are three ghats which provide approach to the Betwa river edge, which have archaeological significance. These are the Nahar Ghat, the Rajghat and the Ghat, with the Siddi ki Ghufa (Saints cave).Studies in south Asian culture, pp.28-29 The Nahar Ghat (\\"nahar\\" means boat) at the east end of the fort, has steep steps that go down from the plateau of the fort to the Betwa river. The ghat is aligned parallel to the wall of the cliff and the river. The \\"Siddhi ki Ghufa\\" (Cave of the Saint), is an archaeological find, located on the cliff wall to the left, along the descent from the Nehar Ghat. While descending via the Rajghat, the cliff wall is to the right. It is a plain cave. The cave depicts, on its right, an image of the goddess Mahishasuramardini. The cliffs above the three ghats are embellished with Gupta sculptures and inscriptions dating from various periods. The Nahar Ghat has about a dozen niches, which house lingas and various deities. From an archaeological perspective, this ghat is considered the richest of the three flights of steps. The Rajghat (Kings steps) also accommodate more than a dozen niches with lingas and statues, but the sculptures are small and in an unfinished state. Matrika statues (seated) are also important archaeological finds at the Nehar Ghat and Rajghat sections, as they establish early sculptural activity in the 6th century. Both these matrika panels are flanked by images of Vinadhara Shiva (Shiva as \\"bearer of the vina\\") and his son Ganesha, though with differences in detailing. The sculpted figurines show large breasts, tiny waists and broad hips. The Varaha temple dated to 7th century is situated in the southeast corner of the fort. It is located on a high jagati or platform. But it is in ruins except for a few architectural fragments such as a door frame and a pillar of an entrance porch. The mainidol has been moved to the sculpture shed here.

The Shrine of Our Lady of Europe () is a Roman Catholic shrine at Campodolcino, Italy. It is devoted to Our Lady of Europe () and is currently the headquarters of the European Ecumenical Centre for Peace. History During the late 1950s, Catholic sectors felt that the Europeist movements would need a Catholic dimension and thought of placing Europe under the protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary. However, they were unaware that such a devotion was already in existence, albeit at a local level, in the British territory of Gibraltar (where the original Shrine devoted to Our Lady still exists to this day) and to a lesser extent in some neighbouring locations in Spain. The movement, supported by the Archbishop of Milan, decided to place a statue in the region of the Italian Alps, which marks the hydrological centre of Europe, since it was the watershed separating the basins of the rivers Rhine, Danube and Po. The monument was blessed by the Archbishop of Milan Giovanni Montini (later Pope Paul VI) on 14 September 1958. Statue A high statue in honour of Our Lady of Europe was erected at above sea level in Motta, a frazione of the comune of Campodolcino on the western slopes of the Valle Spluga to the north of Chiavenna. It is a gilt bronze statue, which was sculptured by Egidio Casagrande taking inspiration from the Shroud of Turin. The statue rests on a circular structure atop a sanctuary with an altar below.

Catherine's effigy in Swansea church has the Gordon and Hay (not Stewart) arms impaled with those of Craddock indicating she was a daughter of Elizabeth Hay, probably her eldest. Catherine was given in marriage by King James IV as his cousin, which she would be either as a daughter of Annabella Stewart by consanguinity or as a daughter of Elizabeth Hay through affinity.

But on a positive note, for some people at least, this might turn out to be one of the most beautiful and romantic albums of all time, if they're deeply in love and listening to this together with or without their object of desire. Perhaps this is exactly the kind of album you'd like to put on when you're with your girlfriend. Turrentine and Hubbard's playing is undeniably beautiful and romantic — and there's something about this album which makes it a bit hard to dislike, perhaps because it'd be all too easy to dismiss it. It's probably also due to the fact that Stanley is always very sincere about what he does; he just wants to play ballads. With cynicism put aside, it's not easy to decide whether this record is a hideous cash-in, cheesy beyond belief, or if it's an unfiltered taste of Stanley's most romantic side.

De Hatsumermolen was built in 1878 by millwright N J Osinga. (Click on \\"Geschiedenis\\" to view.) It drained the Sikma Polder, which formed part of the Hommema State farmstead. Restoration work on the mill began in 1987 and was completed 1990. The mill was officially opened on 23 October 1991 by Pieter van Vollenhoven. Repairs were carried out to the cap in 2003. Description De Hatsumermolen is what the Dutch describe as a \\"grondzeiler\\" . It is a two-storey smock mill on a single-storey base. There is no stage, the sail reaching almost to the ground. The smock and cap covered in weatherboards, which are vertical on the smock. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The sails are Common sails. They have a span of . The sails are carried on a cast-iron windshaft which was cast by Gietijzerij Hardinxveld of Giessendam, Zuid Holland. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 31 cogs. This drives the wallower (16 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the crown wheel, which has 32 cogs drives a gearwheel with 29 cogs on the axle of the wooden Archimedes' screw. The axle of the screw is diameter and the screw is diameter and long. The screw is inclined at 34°. Each revolution of the screw lifts of water.

HSB strengthen the enamel and prevent cracks from propagating through the tooth.Martin, 1994, p. 121 HSB are first observed in early Paleocene mammals, but at this time the HSB occupy only a small portion of the incisor and the angle between the bands is low. By the late Paleocene, HSB is seen to extend throughout the enamel and the bands are located at nearly right angles to each other. Under oblique reflected light HSB can be seen as dark and light strips of variable width. Among Glires, the group containing rodents, lagomorphs, and their primitive relatives, the absence of HSB from the incisors has been considered primitive.Martin, 2004, p. 411 Some early representatives, including Eurymylus, lack HSB, but others, including MatutiniaMartin, 2004, p. 417 and some mimotonids, have double-layered incisor enamel with HSB in the inner portion (portio interna, PI). Other mimotonids have single-layered enamel with HSB. All leporids studied also exhibit this pattern, except for an early Eocene, indeterminate leporid with HSB only in the PI.Martin, 2004, p. 418 Ochotonids also have HSB in the PI only.Martin, 2004, p. 419 In rodents, HSB are usually present in the PI. Three types of HSB can be separated—pauciserial, uniserial, and multiserial. Pauciserial HSB, present in some primitive Paleogene rodents, are usually three to six prisms thick and have inter-prismatic matrix (IPM) surrounding the prisms, which have irregular cross-sections. Uniserial HSB, present in most living rodents, consist of a single layer of prisms. Multiserial HSB, three to seven prisms thick, characterize the living Hystricognathi and the gundis (Ctenodactylidae) and springhares (Pedetes). There are three subtypes on the basis of the orientation of the IPM. In the first, the IPM runs mostly parallel to the HSB, but does not surround it as in pauciserial enamel; in the second, the IPM makes an angle of about 45° with the HSB; and in the third, the two are located at right angles to each other. The last type serves to further strengthen the enamel and is characteristic of the Octodontoidea.Martin, 1994, pp. 121–122 Among carnivorans, the hyenas exhibit specialized HSB, which form a complex, three-dimensional zigzag pattern, a specialization for bone- eating.Barycka, 2007, p. 276 ReferencesLiterature cited *Barycka, E. 2007.

Booklet, Buenos Aires, 2008, p. 65. The robberies done were called \\"expropriations on the bourgeoisie\\". It had its major peak between 1920 and 1935 and some of its most famous practitioners were Buenaventura Durruti, Francisco Ascaso, Severino Di Giovanni, Miguel Arcángel Roscigna, and Lucio Urtubia. It was different from French illegalism because it was not thought of as a way of life but as a way of reaching political ends such as financing revolutionary activities, anarchist propaganda and the release of anarchist prisoners.\\"Se puede ver desde los testimonios de la época que, el accionar de los anarquistas y siguiendo la lógica de sus protagonistas, que la expropiación tenía claramente fines políticos. Existen testimonios de expropiadores y allegados a estos en donde se deja en claro que las condiciones de vida de estos no modificaron luego de las expropiaciones. No se enriquecieron en pocas palabras. Tampoco fue el caso de los grupos que posteriormente, y en otra coyuntura, se abocaron a esta tarea.\\" Anarquismo expropiador en río de la Plata Published by Barricada,from Montevideo  Spain  Los Solidarios (“Solidarity”), also known as Crisol (“Crucible”), was a Spanish anarchist armed-struggle group founded in 1922 or 1923 in Barcelona, as a reply to the 'dirty war' strategy used by the employers and government against trade unions. It was created as a successor to a previous group called Los Justicieros (“The Avenging Ones”), created in Zaragoza. The group was instigated by anarcho-syndicalists, and it set up a network in order to buy and store guns, with which to attack members of the Sindicato Libre, (“Free Trade Union”), an employer-obeying organization. Los Solidarios are considered responsible for bank robberies, such as the Bank of Spain Robbery (September 1923), and for the murder of the Zaragoza cardinal Juan Soldevilla y Romero (1923). After that, and pressured by the Primo de Rivera dictatorship, Buenaventura Durruti, Francisco Ascaso and other members fled to France, and then to Latin America, where they were charged with more robberies. They returned to Europe, settled down in France, and were charged with making an attempt on the life of Alfonso XIII on a visit to Paris, so they had to live clandestinely. They were expelled from France and settled down in Belgium, where they were allowed to stay. With the advent of the Spanish Second Republic (1931), some of the members that had been able to return to Catalonia decided to enter the Federación Anarquista Ibérica (“Iberian Anarchist Federation”), as a group called Nosotros (“Us”), holding more radical points of view than those of the FAI itself. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, the group dissolved as such, but they kept working inside the FAI.  Argentina  The first robbery in Argentina for anarchist political ends was executed by the Russian Germán Boris Wladimirovich in 1919. The purpose was to obtain financing for pamphlets which could explain the situation of the Russian Revolution. The robbery failed and Wladimirovich was arrested along with his collaborator Andrés Babby. Severino Di GiovanniMiguel Arcángel Roscigna and Andrés Vázquez Paredes, who had collaborated with Buenaventura Durruti and Los Solidarios when they were in Argentina, later executed a series of bombings against United States interests in response to the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti. In this campaign, the notorious Italian expropriator Severino Di Giovanni joined in. Roscigna y Vázquez Paredes alongside Antonio Moretti and Vicente Moretti carried out a robbery on the Rawson Hospital of Buenos Aires in October, 1927, where they obtained the amount of 141.000 pesos. According to historian Oswaldo Bayer, Roscigna, with this money they financed the counterfeiting of Argentinian currency. The Moretti brothers and three Catalans recommended by Durruti decided to rob the Cambio Messina in Montevideo, with an outcome of 3 deaths and only 4000 pesos. They ended up being arrested but shortly put in practice a spectacular jailbreak. Di Giovanni started publishing a magazine called Culmine and anarchist propaganda, all of which was financed partly by robberies.Anarquismo en la Argentina Di Giovanni, el expropiador by Federico Millenaar The anarcho- syndicalist publication La Protesta started criticizing Di Giovanni and his group in strong terms, even going so far as accusing him of being a spy and a police agent. Rosigna continued the expropriations but with the purpose of aiding anarchist prisoners.Osvaldo Bayer, Los anarquistas expropiadores y otros ensayos. Booklet, Buenos Aires, 2008, p. 69. This money was used for liberating the anarchists in the Punta Carretas prison. The expropriative anarchists also carried out reprisals against police and state agents who attacked the anarchist movement. Before being arrested Di Giovanni published Anarchia also with \\"expropriations\\". He ended up being executed alongside Paulino Scarfó.  Eastern Europe  Chernoe Znamia Groups such as Rewolucyjni Mściciele (Revolutionary Avengers) and Chernoe Znamia (The Black Banner), active at the beginning of the 20th century, used expropriation as a means to fund their activities.  More recent examples  Lucio Urtubia Lucio Urtubia Jiménez was a Spanish anarchist famous for his practice of expropriative anarchism. At times compared to Robin Hood, Urtubia carried out bank robberies and forgeries throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In the words of Albert Boadella, \\"Lucio is a Quijote that did not fight against wind mills, but against a true giant\\".  References  Bibliography  * Bayer, Osvaldo.

Background In 1990, Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago signed a maritime boundary treaty. The treaty purported to assign to Trinidad and Tobago ocean territory that Barbados claimed as its own. The countries were unable to resolve their dispute for 14 years. In 2004, Barbados elected to force the issue into binding arbitration under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The arbitral tribunal heard the case. Tribunal award The tribunal's award was issued on 11 April 2006. The boundary was set nearly midway between the land of the two island countries.

The most useful and popular methods form a class referred to as \\"quadratic\\" or bilinear time–frequency distributions. A core member of this class is the Wigner–Ville distribution (WVD), as all other TFDs can be written as a smoothed or convolved versions of the WVD. Another popular member of this class is the spectrogram which is the square of the magnitude of the short- time Fourier transform (STFT). The spectrogram has the advantage of being positive and is easy to interpret, but also has disadvantages, like being irreversible, which means that once the spectrogram of a signal is computed, the original signal can't be extracted from the spectrogram.

Noting that a signal can be recovered from a particular distribution under certain conditions, given a certain TFD ρ1(t,f) representing the signal in a joint time–frequency domain, another, different, TFD ρ2(t,f) of the same signal can be obtained to calculate any other distribution, by simple smoothing or filtering; some of these relationships are shown below. A full treatment of the question can be given in Cohen's book. General class If we use the variable ω=2πf, then, borrowing the notations used in the field of quantum mechanics, we can show that time–frequency representation, such as Wigner distribution function (WDF) and other bilinear time–frequency distributions, can be expressed as : C(t,\\\\omega) = \\\\dfrac{1}{4\\\\pi^2}\\\\iiint s^*\\\\left(u-\\\\dfrac{1}{2}\\\\tau\\\\right)s\\\\left(u+\\\\dfrac{1}{2}\\\\tau\\\\right)\\\\phi(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)e^{-j\\\\theta t-j\\\\tau\\\\omega+j\\\\theta u}\\\\, du\\\\,d\\\\tau\\\\,d\\\\theta , (1) where \\\\phi(\\\\theta,\\\\tau) is a two dimensional function called the kernel, which determines the distribution and its properties (for a signal processing terminology and treatment of this question, the reader is referred to the references already cited in the introduction). The kernel of the Wigner distribution function (WDF) is one. However, no particular significance should be attached to that, since it is possible to write the general form so that the kernel of any distribution is one, in which case the kernel of the Wigner distribution function (WDF) would be something else. Characteristic function formulation The characteristic function is the double Fourier transform of the distribution. By inspection of Eq. (1), we can obtain that : C(t,\\\\omega) = \\\\dfrac{1}{4\\\\pi^2}\\\\iint M(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)e^{-j\\\\theta t-j\\\\tau\\\\omega}\\\\, d\\\\theta\\\\,d\\\\tau (2) where : \\\\begin{alignat}{2} M(\\\\theta,\\\\tau) & = \\\\phi(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)\\\\int s^*\\\\left(u-\\\\dfrac{1}{2}\\\\tau\\\\right)s\\\\left(u+\\\\dfrac{1}{2}\\\\tau\\\\right)e^{j\\\\theta u}\\\\,du \\\\ & = \\\\phi(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)A(\\\\theta,\\\\tau) \\\\ \\\\end{alignat} (3) and where A(\\\\theta,\\\\tau) is the symmetrical ambiguity function. The characteristic function may be appropriately called the generalized ambiguity function. Transformation between distributions To obtain that relationship suppose that there are two distributions, C_1 and C_2, with corresponding kernels, \\\\phi_1 and \\\\phi_2. Their characteristic functions are : M_1(\\\\phi,\\\\tau) = \\\\phi_1(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)\\\\int s^*\\\\left(u-\\\\tfrac{\\\\tau}{2}\\\\right)s\\\\left(u+\\\\tfrac{\\\\tau}{2}\\\\right)e^{j\\\\theta u}\\\\, du (4) : M_2(\\\\phi,\\\\tau) = \\\\phi_2(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)\\\\int s^*\\\\left(u-\\\\tfrac{\\\\tau}{2}\\\\right)s\\\\left(u+\\\\tfrac{\\\\tau}{2}\\\\right)e^{j\\\\theta u}\\\\, du (5) Divide one equation by the other to obtain : M_1(\\\\phi,\\\\tau) = \\\\dfrac{\\\\phi_1(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)}{\\\\phi_2(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)}M_2(\\\\phi,\\\\tau) (6) This is an important relationship because it connects the characteristic functions. For the division to be proper the kernel cannot to be zero in a finite region. To obtain the relationship between the distributions take the double Fourier transform of both sides and use Eq. (2) : C_1(t,\\\\omega) = \\\\dfrac{1}{4\\\\pi^2}\\\\iint \\\\dfrac{\\\\phi_1(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)}{\\\\phi_2(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)}M_2(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)e^{-j\\\\theta t-j\\\\tau\\\\omega}\\\\, d\\\\theta\\\\,d\\\\tau (7) Now express M_2 in terms of C_2 to obtain : C_1(t,\\\\omega) = \\\\dfrac{1}{4\\\\pi^2}\\\\iiiint \\\\dfrac{\\\\phi_1(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)}{\\\\phi_2(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)}C_2(t,\\\\omega')e^{j\\\\theta(t'-t)+j\\\\tau(\\\\omega'-\\\\omega)}\\\\, d\\\\theta\\\\,d\\\\tau\\\\,dt'\\\\,d\\\\omega' (8) This relationship can be written as : C_1(t,\\\\omega) = \\\\iint g_{12}(t'-t,\\\\omega'-\\\\omega)C_2(t,\\\\omega')\\\\,dt'\\\\,d\\\\omega' (9) with : g_{12}(t,\\\\omega) = \\\\dfrac{1}{4\\\\pi^2}\\\\iint \\\\dfrac{\\\\phi_1(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)}{\\\\phi_2(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)}e^{j\\\\theta t+j\\\\tau\\\\omega}\\\\, d\\\\theta\\\\, d\\\\tau (10) Relation of the spectrogram to other bilinear representations Now we specialize to the case where one transform from an arbitrary representation to the spectrogram. In Eq. (9), both C_1 to be the spectrogram and C_2 to be arbitrary are set. In addition, to simplify notation, \\\\phi_{SP} = \\\\phi_1, \\\\phi = \\\\phi_2, and g_{SP} = g_{12} are set and written as : C_{SP}(t,\\\\omega) = \\\\iint g_{SP} \\\\left (t'-t,\\\\omega'-\\\\omega \\\\right)C \\\\left (t,\\\\omega' \\\\right )\\\\,dt'\\\\,d\\\\omega' (11) The kernel for the spectrogram with window, h(t), is A_h(-\\\\theta,\\\\tau) and therefore : \\\\begin{align} g_{SP}(t,\\\\omega) & = \\\\dfrac{1}{4\\\\pi^2}\\\\iint \\\\dfrac{A_h(-\\\\theta,\\\\tau)}{\\\\phi(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)}e^{j\\\\theta t+j\\\\tau\\\\omega}\\\\, d\\\\theta\\\\,d\\\\tau \\\\ & = \\\\dfrac{1}{4\\\\pi^2}\\\\iiint \\\\dfrac{1}{\\\\phi(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)}h^*(u-\\\\tfrac{\\\\tau}{2})h(u+\\\\tfrac{\\\\tau}{2})e^{j\\\\theta t+j\\\\tau\\\\omega-j\\\\theta u}\\\\, du\\\\,d\\\\tau\\\\,d\\\\theta \\\\ & = \\\\dfrac{1}{4\\\\pi^2}\\\\iiint h^*(u-\\\\tfrac{\\\\tau}{2})h(u+\\\\tfrac{\\\\tau}{2})\\\\dfrac{\\\\phi(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)}{\\\\phi(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)\\\\phi(-\\\\theta,\\\\tau)}e^{-j\\\\theta t+j\\\\tau\\\\omega+j\\\\theta u}\\\\, du\\\\,d\\\\tau\\\\,d\\\\theta \\\\ \\\\end{align} If we only consider kernels for which \\\\phi(-\\\\theta,\\\\tau)\\\\phi(\\\\theta,\\\\tau) = 1 holds then :g_{SP}(t,\\\\omega) = \\\\dfrac{1}{4\\\\pi^2}\\\\iiint h^*(u-\\\\tfrac{\\\\tau}{2})h(u+\\\\tfrac{\\\\tau}{2}) \\\\phi(\\\\theta,\\\\tau) e^{-j\\\\theta t+j\\\\tau\\\\omega+j\\\\theta u}\\\\, du\\\\,d\\\\tau\\\\,d\\\\theta = C_h(t,-\\\\omega) and therefore : C_{SP}(t,\\\\omega) = \\\\iint C_s(t',\\\\omega')C_h(t'-t,\\\\omega'-\\\\omega)\\\\,dt'\\\\,d\\\\omega' This was shown by Janssen[4]. When \\\\phi(-\\\\theta,\\\\tau)\\\\phi(\\\\theta,\\\\tau) does not equal one, then : C_{SP}(t,\\\\omega) = \\\\iiiint G(t,\\\\omega)C_s(t',\\\\omega')C_h(t+t'-t,-\\\\omega+\\\\omega-\\\\omega')\\\\,dt'\\\\,dt\\\\,d\\\\omega'\\\\,d\\\\omega where : G(t,\\\\omega) = \\\\dfrac{1}{4\\\\pi^2}\\\\iint \\\\dfrac{e^{-j\\\\theta t-j\\\\tau\\\\omega}}{\\\\phi(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)\\\\phi(-\\\\theta,\\\\tau)}\\\\, d\\\\theta\\\\,d\\\\tau References Category:Time–frequency analysis ","title":"Transformation between distributions in time–frequency analysis"},{"id":"25848952","text":"Gurunathanmukadi Sri Ayyappaguru temple is situated on a hill in a beautiful landscape, near the banks of Achankovil River, on the opposite side of Pandalam Sri Valiyakoickal Dharma Sastha temple. The legend of Ayyappaguru temple is intertwined with Pandalam kingdom . The legend says when Sri Manikandan (young Ayyappa) was brought up at Pandalam palace, he learned ‘vidya’ from the guru called Sri Gurunathan who was an incarnations of Sivachaithanya and was a Mahayogi. Sri Gurunathan reached Pandalam as guided by Lord Siva in a dream. With patronage and blessings of Sri Rajasekharan, then king of Pandalam, Sri Gurunathan established a gurukulam (school) on a hill and he became Gurukula Guru. He taught Manikandan various sasstras. Manikandan became an expert in combat art also. Gurunathan became very much pleased in the learning capability of Manikandan and rewarded him with his golden ‘Churika’ . Sri Manikandan cured the inborn deafness and dumbness of the son of Gurunathan as gurudakshina . Thus, Sri Ayyappa revealed his divinity to the world. Sri Gurunathan spent the rest of his life in the gurukulam hills and later entered into ‘holy samadhi’. This holy hill is now known as \\"Gurunathanmukadi\\". Indeed, the hill has become a holy place due to the blessings of Sri Ayyappaguru and also due to the holy foot contact of Sri Ayyappa. In these holy hills there is a temple complex where idols of Sri Ayyappaguru, Sri Ayyappa, Lord Siva, Lord Vishnu, Sri Bhadra, Lord Ganapati, Sri Nagaraja & Nagayakshi are being worshipped according to religious rites. There are daily poojas, special offerings and yearly festivals. There is chirappu festival beginning from vrichikam 1st to Makaravilakku. This festival ends with a religious procession called ‘Varavelpu’ from Kanikkamandapam to the temple, which recall the incident that Guru accompanied Manikandan to the Gurukulam for the first time. This unique procession blended with Bhakti reveals the greatness of Ayyappaguru temple. The temple poojas, offerings and festivals are conducted based on legendary and historical records. There is morning and evening poojas daily under the guidance of temple Thantri Brahmasri Subramanya Narayana Bhattathiri (Thekkedathu Illam, Tiruvalla). Annual ‘Prathishta kalasam’, festival kalasam and Sarpa pooja are performed yearly. Programmes like temple festival, Sapthaham, Parakkezhunnellippu are also conducted regularly. However unluckily we could not, so far, give enough publicity to the legendary importance of this temple complex, so as to attract the devotees from far and wide.

Perhaps his greatest claim to fame is his association with the Holtermann Nugget, the largest gold specimen ever found, long, weighing , in Hill End, near Bathurst, and with an estimated gold content of . Early life Holtermann was born in Hamburg, Germany. He emigrated in 1858 to avoid Prussian military service. He departed Liverpool aboard the ship Salem and reached Melbourne in August after a journey lasting 101 days. Mining After working at a variety of jobs, he teamed up with Ludwig Hugo 'Louis' Beyers. They began prospecting around Hill End, New South Wales. Years of unrewarding labour followed. On 22 February 1868, Holtermann married Harriett Emmett, while Beyers married her sister Mary. In 1871, the Star of Hope Gold Mining Company, in which he and Beyers were among the partners, struck rich veins of gold. On 19 October 1872, the Holtermann Nugget was discovered. Not strictly speaking a nugget, it was a gold specimen, a mass of gold embedded in rock, in this case quartz. Holtermann attempted to buy the specimen from the company, offering £1000 over its estimated value of £12,000 (about AU$1.9 million in 2016 currency, AU$4.8 million on the 2017 gold price), but was turned down, and it was sent away to have the gold extracted. Disheartened, he resigned from the company in February 1873. When the Hill End Borough Council was constituted on 6 August 1873, Holtermann was elected as an Alderman of the first council. In October 1874, Holtermann was elected an Alderman in a special election for the Belmore Ward of the Borough of St Leonards. Later life Bernhardt Holtermann in 1880 He built a large mansion, \\"The Towers\\" in North Sydney, complete with a stained glass window depicting himself and the specimen. Located at a panoramic location near Blue and William streets, he resided there until his death in 1885 and its site is now the Sydney Church of England Grammar School. He invested wisely and kept his wealth, allowing him to take up his true passion of photography. Holtermann was also interested in patent medicine. He was proud of having cured fellow passengers on his 1858 sea voyage to Australia. After he retired from mining, he wrote papers and devised formulae for medicines, and promoted and sold \\"Holtermann's Life Preserving Drops\\". In 1882, on his third try, Holtermann was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for St Leonards, which he served until his death. He died in Sydney, Australia on his birthday, 29 April 1885, of \\"cancer of the stomach, cirrhosis of the liver and dropsy\\", leaving a wife, three sons, and two daughters. Photography The view of Sydney Harbour from 'The Towers' Holtermann financed and possibly participated in Beaufoy Merlin's project to photograph New South Wales and exhibit the results abroad to encourage immigration. The work was taken up after Merlin's death in 1873 by his assistant, Charles Bayliss. In 1875, Holtermann and Bayliss produced the Holtermann panorama, a series of \\"23 albumen silver photographs which join together to form a continuous 978-centimetre view of Sydney Harbour and its suburbs.\\" Some of the photographs, including the panorama, were displayed at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition, where they won a bronze medal. The panorama was also displayed at the 1878 Exposition Universelle Internationale in Paris. Almost seventy years after Holtermann's death, more than 3,000 of the glass negatives created by Merlin and Bayliss were retrieved from a garden shed in the Sydney suburb of Chatswood. The UNESCO-listed collection of negatives, known as The Holtermann Collection, is housed in the State Library of New South Wales and presented in Gulgong Holtermann Museum.

Director and scriptwriter of series for Cuban television, Moya directed his first feature film entitled Mañana (Tomorrow) in 2006, casting Rafael E. Hernández, Enrique Molina, Hugo Reyes, Violeta Rodriguez and Adria Santana. Mañana (Tomorrow) has been presented by the ICAIC (Cuban Institute of Arts and Cinematographic Industry) which registered it as a competition movie in the 2006 Festival of the New Latin American Cinema of Havana. Biography As a multi-faceted artist, Iskander is not only a cinema director, but he’s also a TV director, a scriptwriter and a poet. When Alejandro Moya was a child, his father – one of the most renowned directors of the last 50 years’ Cuban TV - gave him the nickname of \\"Iskander\\", which was actually the Persian name of Alexander the Great. Since then, Alejandro kept it as his artist pseudonym. Always having considered esthetism as the supreme expression of art, Iskander regarded the 7th art as the better way to convey the social dimension of his message. As an independent filmmaker, financially supported by non-etatic funds, Moya directed his first movie in 2006. The film, entitled Mañana (Tomorrow), was produced with a very low budget and with the support of several Cuban artists – such as Silvio Rodríguez, Juan Formell, Ernesto Rancaño, Carlos Guzmán and Kcho - as well as of the own stars of the movie and the ICAIC. Mañana (Tomorrow) can be defined as a critical trip to the interior of a Cuban family that lives with some economic comfort. In other words, the movie features a new artistic but realistic vision of today’s Cuba : its conflicts, its human miseries, its tolerances, its excesses… and Cuban people’s wish of living \\"above the reality\\". The movie was successful, and made Alejandro Moya recognised as one of the merging talents of Cuba cinematography. Alejandro Moya is currently working on his next movie, which theme will center around the Cuban diaspora.

She began a musical career in London in the 1840s but decamped to Australia late in 1849. In 1852, she appeared in Sydney in the first production in Australia of Bellini's opera Norma.A. V. Beedell, Terminal Silence: Sara Flower and the Diva Enigma. Explorations of Voice and the Maternal in Operatic Experience in Colonial Australian History ca. 1850–1865 in 2 vols., Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia, 2000, 2 vols Origins Flower was born in Grays, Essex, an English market town on the River Thames and situated on the edge of the Tilbury marshes. In 1821 it had a population of 742, supporting six public houses.New British Traveller (1784), in Laurie Leeham, 'From Stocks to Docks' Essex Countryside August 1967 pp.53+; William White 1848, History, Gazeteer, & Directory of the County of; Essex; Essex Directory [1823], p. 294. Flower's maternal grandfather, Daniel Granger, had the Rising Sun public house. However, close by, overlooking the Thames, the 18th century Belmont Castle exerted considerable influence upon the social and cultural life of the wider region, more specifically, it was the focus of an influential musical circle of metropolitan status.Alice Diehl 1897, Musical Memories, London; [1897]; The True Story of My Life. An Autobiography [1905], London. Sara's father, William Lewis Flower (c.1800-1847), was recorded in the Essex Directory in 1823 as a draper, grocer, and agent for Phoenix Fire & Life. In 1841, upon the entry of his daughter Sara to the Royal Academy of Music,Royal Academy of Music, Register. She had been admitted, 21 October 1841 upon the recommendation of the Academy's founder, John Fane Lord Burghersh, later 11th earl of Westmoreland, soldier, diplomat and amateur opera composer. he could declare that he had 'no occupation', hence, the status of gentleman. His elder brother, Robert Flower (1779?-1832), was by 1824 foreman of the local brickworks but had been described in the parish records in 1817 as a yeoman, which suggests an earlier lineage of tenant farmers or small proprietors, and also a drop in social status. With the enclosure movement after the Napoleonic Wars, conditions for this socio-economic group were particularly difficult, which probably explains Robert's change of occupation.Essex County Record Office. Grays Parish, baptism records for his many children, almost all of whom pre-deceased him. For conditions for the remnants of the yeomanry - the English tenant farmers of the 1820s and 30s - see William Cobbett for a contemporary account in his Rural Rides of 1830. Her mother, Ruth Flower, was the daughter of Grays publican, Daniel Granger. Nothing more is known of her, except for the possibility that she may have been the prototype in Alice Diehl's first published novel Garden of Eden for the mother of a fictional opera singer whose sad fate she prophetically foretells.The concert pianist Alice Diehl was the author of at least 41 novels. She also wrote two works of autobiography: Musical Memories, London, [1897], and The True Story of My Life. An Autobiography [1905], London. She grew up in the same area, in nearby Averley, granddaughter of the local Doctor, Charles Lewis Vidal (1782-1862), and her autobiographical works show that she and her family were social associates of the Flowers of Grays, either through a local music making circle at Belmont Castle where Diehl's mother was a favourite, or perhaps kinship. The 'Alice Diehl' entry in 'Thurrock Heritage - Factfiles' particularly in relation to the identification of 1882 as the publication date of Diehl's first novel, considered by this source to have been Garden of Eden provides some support for the proposition. [www.thurrock.gov.uk/heritage] The British Library's copy is dated 1907, possibly the Library's accession date. Sara was not the only professional singer in the family. Her elder sister, the soprano Elizabeth Flower, also became a public singer, and both sisters had considerable London and regional concert careers in the 1840s, performing, often as a duo, to much acclaim, especially for Sara, with her startling voice. In 1847, Elizabeth married a prominent lawyer, Timms Augustine Sargood and withdrew from public life. However, in the 1860s at their home in London's Bloomsbury district (Gordon Square), she and her husband were the hosts of quite an elevated musical circle in which Alice Diehl took part and which she recalled in her two autobiographical works already cited. These two musical daughters of William Lewis Flower were frequently confused with the two very talented daughters of political writer Benjamin Flower, Sarah Fuller Flower Adams and Eliza Flower, acclaimed as poet and composer respectively. It was a confusion which followed Sara to the grave and beyond.The Australian Monthly Magazine vol. I, no.1, September 1865 in a short obituary commented, 'We believe she was sister to Eliza Flower, composer of that beautiful English sacred glee — 'Now pray we for our country', and we trust that those who can afford it will see to it that posterity shall not look in vain for the resting place of one who certainly was among the pioneers of opera in Australia.'; in other words that she was the poet Sarah Fuller Flower Adams, who had written the words for the enduring hymn 'Nearer my God to Thee', set to music by her sister Eliza Flower. It is not impossible, considering their similar economic, social, and regional backgrounds, that there may indeed have been a blood connection between the two families although none has ever been established. Education and training From late October 1841, Flower was trained, or at least, 'finished' at the Royal Academy of Music (R.A.M) under Domenico Crivelli(1794–1857), who, via his teacher-father, the singer Gaetano Crivelli (1774–1836),See Grove 1961, vol. 2, p. 536 for these life dates presumably passed on some of the 'secrets' of the 'golden age' of Italian castrati, among which, almost certainly, the exploitation of falsetto, technical skills which probably account for Flower's protean ability to cross the entire range of the operatic singing voice, as in Bellini's Norma, from the dramatic soprano of Norma. through the mezzo of Adalgisa; and, not least, the tenor role of Pollioni. She also performed baritone roles and could delight provincial colonial audiences with her 'remarkable' yodeling songs. Early career Flower first came to public notice, however, within the Psalmody MovementPart of a wider musical/social phenomenon broadly constructed around the philosophical idealism of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi modified, however by the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham. See Rachel Cowgill and Peter Holman Music in the British Provinces 1690-1914 (Ashgate, 2007; Bernarr Rainbow 1970, The Choral Revival in the Anglican Church (1839–1872). (London, Barrie & Jenkins) of the 1830s and 40s in London when, on 4 November 1839, the Musical World noted that Sara and her sister Elizabeth had both appeared at a lecture given at the Hoxton National School Room in inner North London by Charles Henry Purday (1799–1885), engaged, presumably, in order to demonstrate the argument of Purday's lecture, entitled, 'The Proper Object of Music'.The title of the lecture is an echo of the title of the 1824 Quarterly Musical Magazine [QMMR] article on a work of 1807 by Guillaume André Villoteau. following Pestalozzi, extolling music as a pleasure unique in its moral effect; able 'to elevate and ennoble the soul by purifying and strengthening the mind'. (QMMRvol.vi, pp.39-40). Purday himself was a well-known singer, lecturer, editor and composer of popular songs and hymns, also conductor of psalmody to the Scottish Church in Crown Street, Covent Garden, and composer of the popular hymn, 'Lead Kindly Light'. Grove 1961, vol. 6, p. 1022 The Movement in Britain was associated with such names as Sarah Ann Glover, John Hullah and John Curwen. It had strong Independent, or Congregationalist non-conformist religious leanings, and a powerful utilitarian sociology. Flower was also believed to be connected with John Hullah's extraordinarily successful singing classes in London's Exeter Hall,Sydney Morning Herald 'Contributions from Home', No. 18', 18 February 1851, p.4f and possibly with \\"Music for the Million\\", the singing school of Joseph Mainzer (1801–1851).Musical Times 1 October 1844, p. 39. It had been modeled, essentially, along the lines of the very structured monitorial method of Guillaume Louis Bocquillon Wilhem [1781–1842] and his 'Orphéon' choral fests)Wilhem was Musical director-general of music in the municipal schools of Paris. Based upon a plan of 'Mutual Instruction', he developed a huge music education organization (Orphéon) throughout France. (See Grove 1961, vol. 9, pp.298-99) as a means of teaching large masses of often illiterate working people to sight-sing from notation sheets. While it was socially rather than musically motivated, and was largely a non-conformist socio-religious project, it had the effect in the long term of revitalizing musical education in the wider sphere, not least, within the established Anglican Church itself.Bernarr Rainbow 1970, The Choral Revival in the Anglican Church (1839-1872). (London, Barrie & Jenkins) If the Purday/Hullah connections suggest Flower's links with non-conformism and/or the Psalmody Movement, it might also suggest a pathway to a musical career, consistent with parental anxiety about the snares of a more public profile, as a teacher within the Movement rather than as a professional, let alone operatic, soloist. However a post-1847 Flower family memorial plaque on the walls of the Grays parish church of St Peter and St Paul does not suggest any powerful non-conformist link. Nor does her R.A.M. career under the dictatorial rule of its President, John Fane, Lord Burghersh (1784–1859).Later 11th earl of Westmorland; soldier, diplomat and amateur opera composer, generally considered to have been the found of the R.A.M. in 1839. His works, all within the genre of Italian opera, were often rehearsed by R.A.M. students. Flower probably had the perfect alto voice for his project, and probably for her teaching master, Domenico Crivelli. Voice There follows a selection of 19th-century attempts at describing Flower's voice and vocal affect derived from British and Australian newspaper reports of the period: Volume; melody; compass; resonance; sonorousness; simplicity; cultivation; powerful; exquisite; flexible; rich; full; distinct; nervous; rare; delicious; sweet; mellow; liquid; welling; gushing; wonderful; expressive; clear; enchanting; perfect; delightful; wonderful; extraordinary; thrilling; electrifying; melancholy; noble; pure; magnificent; splendid; glorious; astonishing; commanding; great; masterly; force of expression; sensation; harmony; charm; liveliness; ease; heart-pathos; depth of feeling; emotional power; tenderness; a host in itself; divine; beyond praise; heaven; a treasure; the great contralto. When she made her debut in opera in London, 'anonymously', at Drury Lane on 7 January 1843, as an all-but non-singing Felix (Pippo) to Sabilla Novello's Annette (the youngest daughter of music publisher Vincent Novello) in a hybrid Macready production of Rossini's opera La gazza ladra (The Thieving Magpie) 'little more than a melodrama with a few airs interspersed',Musical World 12 January 1843, p. 22 at her first musical entry – a phrase of recitative introducing the duet 'Ebben per mia' with Annette: > 'her notes were so exceedingly full and rich, her articulation so admirable, > rare qualities in an English singer of recitative, that the audience were > literally taken by surprise, and uttered loud and continuous applause, which > was frequently reiterated as the very superior quality of her voice was > exhibited in the course of the duet'.The Times 'Drury Lane Theatre', 9 > January 1843, p.4f. The reviewer described her voice then as 'a mezzo-soprano of singular volume, with some excellent contralto notes, which she touches with firmness'. She was probably not yet 23 at this time. Unusually though, he went beyond his own critical autonomy to call, not upon an actual description of the voice, but upon the reaction (authority) of an audience. It was an audience which cried out spontaneously over a few bars of recitative.Michel Poizat 1992, The Angel's Cry. Beyond the Pleasure Principle in Opera Contemporary London comment associated Flower's voice with that of Marietta Brambilla (1807–1875) as possessing a 'contralto voice of [...] delicious voluptuous quality'.Musical World 22 February 1844 Six years later in Australia, Flower's voice was described as being > like one of those boy-voices that one meets with once in one's life and > remembers for ever after, so clear, so full, and nervous, and of such volume > and compass.Sydney Morning Herald (SMH), 'Parramatta Concert', 8 July 1850, > p. 3a.

History It was built in 1756 by Croatian count Krsto Oršić (1718–1782) on the site of a previous fortress from the Middle Ages and designed in an L-shaped ground plan. From the backyard side, both the wings are open in arcades that follow the line of the corridor, while the outside frontage is quite simple, with rhythmically aligned windows and a few rustic details in the corners. After a large earthquake in the 19th century, a classicist porch with a tympanum and Doric columns was added to the castle. Inside there is a well-preserved chapel with illusionist murals and an illustrated baroque altar. Besides this castle, the Oršić family owned a large number of other castles, palaces and estates in Croatia, among which the most significant were castles Gornja Bistra at Zaprešić, Slavetić at Jastrebarsko, Jurketinec at Varaždin and palaces in Zagreb and Varaždin. The castle was the feudal residence of the Oršić family, until the last members relocated in 1924. A primary school was situated in a part of the castle for some time after that, and a local peasant's cooperative society as well. At the end of the sixties and the beginning of the seventies, the castle was thoroughly renewed and transformed into a Museum of the Peasants' revolt, which deals with a tragic event that occurred in 1573 in this area. Around the castle there is a park with a huge monument dedicated to the Peasants' revolt and to its leader Matija Gubec, made by a prominent Croatian sculptor Antun Augustinčić.

Pre-Revolutionary history  The Marshall House is listed on the National Register of Historical Places for both its place in American history and its architectural significance. Constructed in 1770–1773 as a gambrel-roofed, heavy timbered farmhouse and remodeled in 1867–1868 in the Italianate Style, the Marshall House retains substantial integrity of design and materials. Despite its modifications, the building remains understandable as a rare, extant example of pre-Revolutionary residential architecture. It is one of only two extant “witness” buildings associated with the pivotal Revolutionary Battles of Saratoga that took place in 1777. Pressed into service as a British field hospital, the building became the refuge of the Baroness Frederika Riedesel, whose well known diary chronicles the tribulations, deaths and heroism of other noncombatants, wounded officers, and men who sheltered with her through a six-day artillery bombardment and siege. The pre-Revolutionary history of the property referred to as the Marshall House is incomplete. The building was erected “on lot number one of the tenth allotment in the general division of the Kayderosseras patent, bounded on the south by the north line of the Saratoga patent, containing about ”. The property now comprises . The area, originally called Saratoga, was inhabited by Dutch and English settlers beginning in 1684 who came to advantage themselves of the plentiful water power afforded by the confluence of the Hudson River, the Fish Creek, and the Batten Kill at this point, in addition to being aided by rich soils. There are some indications that the subject house and its surrounding farm served as a collection point for timber and local produce for shipping down river to Albany, to be sold there by the three-man partnership that built it. Known with certainty is that the property soon came into the hands of Peter Lansing, an Albany merchant, whose family were prominent land owners and fellow merchants in the upper Hudson Valley. However, local nineteenth-century accounts hold that the Lansings and others fled south upon the approach of the British army and its Indian allies in the summer of 1777.  The Battles of Saratoga and the Baroness Frederika Riedesel The Marshall House attained its fame for the rôle it played in the events leading to the British surrender following the Battles of Saratoga fought during September–October, 1777. Traveling with the British army was the Baroness Frederika Riedesel, the young wife of Major General Friedrich Adolf Riedesel, commander of the German mercenary troops who formed part of the British army led by Lieutenant General John Burgoyne. During the afternoon of October 10 American batteries emplaced on the east side of the Hudson River opened fire on Riedesel's defenses some fifty rods south of the Marshall House. The baron, seeing the house, urged his wife and their three young children to seek safety in its stone cellar. Baroness Riedesell was soon joined by other women in like circumstances as well as by wounded military personnel. Observing the commotion surrounding the house the Americans mistakenly supposed it to be an enemy headquarters and began firing upon it. As aforesaid, the baroness recounted in her diary the ordeal of those besieged in the house: > “We were at last obliged to resort to the cellar for refuge, and in one > corner of this I remained the whole day, my children sleeping on the earth > with their heads in my lap; and in the same situation I passed a sleepless > night. Eleven [cannon balls] passed through the house, and we could > distinctly hear them roll away. One poor soldier who was lying on a table > for the purpose of having his leg amputated, was struck buy a shot, which > carried away his other; his comrades had left him, and when we went to his > assistance we found him in a corner of the room, into which he had crept, > more dead than alive, scarcely breathing”.Stone, 127 The bombardment resumed the following morning. As their danger continued, the refugees and wounded suffered for want of water, the well having gone dry: > ”At length we found a soldier’s wife who had courage enough to fetch us some > from the river, an office nobody else would undertake, as the Americans shot > at every person who approached it; but, out of respect for her sex, they > never molested her”.Stone, 134 The Baroness Riedesel organized the female refugees (the wives of several British officers) to attend the wounded as best they were able. For her tireless efforts throughout the six day siege the baroness won the affection of all who shared her fate in the Marshall House. On October 16, with British surrender imminent, the noncombatants at last were free to emerge in safety. The following day, October 17, 1777, Burgoyne surrendered to the Americans. As a result of the American victory at Saratoga (present day Schuylerville) the French government threw its support to the American cause assuring success in the War of Independence.  The Marshall House after the American Revolutionary War  Following the Revolution the Marshall House property changed hands. Captain Samuel Bushee, a war veteran and settler from Connecticut, purchased it from Peter Lansing in 1802. Bushee subsequently conveyed the property to his father-in-law, Abraham Marshall, in 1817. Thereafter the property remained in the Marshall family until 1930 when it was purchased by Kenneth and Adelaide Bullard whose descendants remain its owners and inhabitants. After the war, the house was recognized for its dramatic role in the Battles of Saratoga. Though always a private residence the Marshall House has ever been a favorite destination for persons touring the Saratoga battlefields. Cannonballs that struck the house are displayed as are the floor in the northeast room bloodstained from its use as a makeshift hospital, and the capacious stone cellar. Structural features damaged by cannon fire testify to the events that thrust fame upon this two century and more old house. Remaining and still in use from the time of the Battles of Saratoga are the hinges and great lock on the front door and the delicate thumb latch and the wooden door itself in the cellarway.  Architectural significance  The Marshall house is found a mile north of the center of Schuylerville, Town of Saratoga, Saratoga County, New York, It is approached by means of a long, curved and sloping driveway atop a steep rise nineteen rods west of New York highway 32. The site features mature white pine, towering black locust and spruce trees upon a broad lawn. The Hudson River below flows north to south. In its present configuration the Marshall House is a 2-story, single-sloped- roof building, five bays long by three bays wide, oriented with its principal elevation facing east. The original form of the house was as constructed c. 1770 a -story, heavy timbered post-and-beam, gambrel-roofed main block with a recessed, gable-roofed kitchen wing attached to the southwest corner. The entire structure rests upon a fieldstone foundation enclosing a full basement. Until the renovations of the mid-nineteenth century the main block incorporated interior end chimneys; a single chimney for a cooking hearth appears in old pictures showing the small kitchen wing. The original five-bay center-hall plan of the colonial farmhouse was retained when the full second story was added at the time of the Italianate remodeling of 1867–68. The lighter timbers used for the second story improvement were recycled from another building. Simultaneously the original kitchen wing was razed and a new, larger kitchen added at the rear. The building was partially nogged with ballast brick, particularly beneath window openings, sheathed with by rough pine boards covered by narrow clapboard siding. An “L” shaped narrow wrap- around porch featuring a series of decorative arches was added to the first story, primarily oriented eastwards. The original small windows on the east elevation were lengthened floor-to-ceiling and triple-hung (now double-hung). The wide entrance architrave of the original house was retained. The present divided “Dutch” door of the 1930s restoration features the original forged iron hardware and massive lock and key hardware from the first construction. The interior, too, retains many features of the original construction as well as elements reflecting improvements undertaken in the 1840s, 1867–68 and 1931. The center hall contains a staircase with a landing slightly below the second floor; the balustrade and oaken newel remain from the post-civil war remodeling. The library and parlor rooms flank the center hall and a dining room faces south. A “modern” nineteenth century kitchen and two small utility rooms are located in the west wing above a crawl space containing a disused cistern. Above it are two simple bedrooms, probably occupied by servants or farmhands in earlier times. Fireplace hearths were rebuilt in 1931, but with exterior chimneys, upon the footprint of the originals. The mantel in the north (library) room is simple and reflective of Italianate styling. The mantel in the south (parlor) room exhibits dentelle and intricate carving and is believed to be original to the house. The floors downstairs and upstairs are wide native white pine boards secured to the heavy adz-hewn joists below with hand-cut iron nails.  The Apple Cottage  Behind and west of the building that is the chief subject of this article stands a small lodge erected in 1957 called the Apple Cottage (Ringo-an in Japanese). It is remarkable in that it is entirely built using local materials together with orientalia. The roof is Granville slate, its siding is Adirondack white pine board-and-batten, its entry steps are taken from a nearby old Champlain Canal commutation bridge abutment, and its wooden window sash were made locally. Within, the ground floor is paved with Granville flagstones, the second floor with box car siding. Throughout, the interior walls are unstained white pine darkened by the passage of time. An upstairs passageway is walled with Japanese cedar bark. The ceiling in the main room is finished with woven bamboo(sawali) from the Philippine Islands, supported by cherry false rafters. There are fireplaces on each of the two floors built of local “ruckytuck” sandstone. The mantel shelf downstairs is fashioned from white oak; the mantel upstairs of red mahogany from Thailand. The balustrade is composed of cedar poles and mulberry boards. The bedroom ceiling is covered with Korean grass paper. The oriental features recall the present owner's life in the Far East where he for some years represented an American manufacturer. The ground floor houses a kitchen and dining area. From it is accessed a screened porch fronted by a wildflower garden. The second floor features a bright room furnished with a grand piano and music library, at present the studio of Hilary Tann, the well known Welsh-American composer of modern classical music. At the north end is a small bedroom. The east elevation commands a view of the Hudson River and the Green Mountains of Vermont; the west elevation stands above a pond populated by koi (Japanese carp). The north elevation overlooks a Japanese garden with an imaginary pond and tori (stone lantern). To the south there is a lawn where stand a large sycamore, spruce, oak, white cedar and several species of pine trees.

Röskva nominates to the paid positions at the Student Council's Office. History Röskva was founded in February the year 1988 when two movements merged, The organization of left people and Reformists decided that combined they would be a bigger force to compete against Vaka, the organization of democratic students. The first chair of the organization was Þórunn Sveinbjarnardóttir the former Environment minister in the government of Geir Haarde. Röskva first was in the majority in 1992 and kept it until 2002, when Vaka regained its majority. Röskva got the majority again in the spring of 2007 and kept it until the spring of 2009. In 2017, Röskva won the election to the Student Council after eight years in minority, and received 18 of the 27 student councils members, which was at the time the biggest victory in Röskva's history. In 2018, the organization won again and held the majority with 18 members. Röskva's biggest victory came in 2020 where they won 13 of 17 seats available. The organization opposes school admission fees and advocates for general access to university education.

Young for use in treatment of personality disorders and chronic DSM Axis I disorders, such as when patients fail to respond or relapse after having been through other therapies (for example, traditional cognitive behavioral therapy). Schema therapy is an integrative psychotherapy combining theory and techniques from previously existing therapies, including cognitive behavioral therapy, psychoanalytic object relations theory, attachment theory, and Gestalt therapy.; Introduction Four main theoretical concepts in schema therapy are early maladaptive schemas (or simply schemas), coping styles, modes, and basic emotional needs: # In cognitive psychology, a schema is an organized pattern of thought and behavior. It can also be described as a mental structure of preconceived ideas, a framework representing some aspect of the world, or a system of organizing and perceiving new information. In schema therapy, a schema specifically refers to an early maladaptive schema, defined as a pervasive self-defeating or dysfunctional theme or pattern of memories, emotions, and physical sensations, developed during childhood or adolescence and elaborated throughout one's lifetime. Often they have the form of a belief about the self or the world. For instance, a person with an Abandonment schemaFollowing the convention in , the names of schemas and modes are capitalized. They are also italicized in this article for clarity. could be hypersensitive (have an \\"emotional button\\" or \\"trigger\\") about their perceived value to others, which in turn could make them feel sad and panicky in their interpersonal relationships. # Coping styles are a person's behavioral responses to schemas. There are three potential coping styles. In \\"avoidance\\" the person tries to avoid situations that activate the schema. In \\"surrender\\" the person gives into the schema, doesn't try to fight against it, and changes their behavior in expectation that the feared outcome is inevitable. In \\"counterattack\\", also called \\"overcompensation\\", the person puts extra work into not allowing the schema's feared outcome to happen. These maladaptive coping styles (overcompensation, avoidance, or surrender) very often wind up reinforcing the schemas. Continuing the Abandonment example: having imagined a threat of abandonment in a relationship and feeling sad and panicky, a person using an avoidance coping style might then behave in ways to limit the closeness in the relationship to try to protect themself from being abandoned. The resulting loneliness or even actual loss of the relationship could easily reinforce the person's Abandonment schema. Another example can be given for the Defectiveness schema: A person using an avoidance coping style might avoid situations that make them feel defective, or might try to numb the feeling with addictions or distractions. A person using a surrender coping style might tolerate unfair criticism without defending themself. A person using the counterattack/overcompensation coping style might put extra effort into being superhuman. # Modes are mind states that cluster schemas and coping styles into a temporary \\"way of being\\" that a person can shift into occasionally or more frequently. For example, a Vulnerable Child mode might be a state of mind encompassing schemas of Abandonment, Defectiveness, Mistrust/Abuse and a coping style of surrendering (to the schemas). # If a patient's basic emotional needs are not met in childhood, then schemas, coping styles, and modes can develop. Some basic needs that have been identified are: connection, mutuality, reciprocity, flow, and autonomy. For example, a child with unmet needs around connection—perhaps due to parental loss to death, divorce, or addiction—might develop an Abandonment schema. The goal of schema therapy is to help patients meet their basic emotional needs by helping the patient learn how to: * heal schemas by diminishing the intensity of emotional memories comprising the schema and the intensity of bodily sensations, and by changing the cognitive patterns connected to the schema; * replace maladaptive coping styles and responses with adaptive patterns of behavior. Techniques used in schema therapy including limited reparenting and Gestalt therapy psychodrama techniques such as imagery re-scripting and empty chair dialogues. See , below. There is a growing literature of outcome studies on schema therapy, where schema therapy has shown impressive results. See , below. Early maladaptive schemas Early maladaptive schemas are self-defeating, emotional and cognitive patterns established from childhood and repeated throughout life. They may be made up of emotional memories of past hurt, tragedy, fear, abuse, neglect, unmet safety needs, abandonment, or lack of normal human affection in general. Early maladaptive schemas can also include bodily sensations associated with such emotional memories. Early maladaptive schemas can have different levels of severity and pervasiveness: the more severe the schema, the more intense the negative emotion when the schema is triggered and the longer it lasts; the more pervasive the schema, the greater the number of situations that trigger it. Schema domains Schema domains are five broad categories of unmet needs into which are grouped 18 early maladaptive schemas identified by : # Disconnection/Rejection includes 5 schemas: ## Abandonment/Instability ## Mistrust/Abuse ## Emotional Deprivation ## Defectiveness/Shame ## Social Isolation/Alienation # Impaired Autonomy and/or Performance includes 4 schemas: ## Dependence/Incompetence ## Vulnerability to Harm or Illness ## Enmeshment/Undeveloped Self ## Failure # Impaired Limits includes 2 schemas: ## Entitlement/Grandiosity ## Insufficient Self-Control and/or Self-Discipline # Other-Directedness includes 3 schemas: ## Subjugation ## Self-Sacrifice ## Approval-Seeking/Recognition-Seeking # Overvigilance/Inhibition includes 4 schemas: ## Negativity/Pessimism ## Emotional Inhibition ## Unrelenting Standards/Hypercriticalness ## Punitiveness Schema modes Schema modes are momentary mind states which every human being experiences at one time or another. A schema mode consists of a cluster of schemas and coping styles. Life situations that a person finds disturbing or offensive, or arouse bad memories, are referred to as \\"triggers\\" that tend to activate schema modes. In psychologically healthy persons, schema modes are mild, flexible mind states that are easily pacified by the rest of their personality. In patients with personality disorders, schema modes are more severe, rigid mind states that may seem split off from the rest of their personality. Identified schema modes identified 10 schema modes grouped into four categories. The four categories are: Child modes, Dysfunctional Coping modes, Dysfunctional Parent modes, and the Healthy Adult mode. The four Child modes are: Vulnerable Child, Angry Child, Impulsive/Undisciplined Child, and Happy Child. The three Dysfunctional Coping modes are: Compliant Surrenderer, Detached Protector, and Overcompensator. The two Dysfunctional Parent modes are: Punitive Parent and Demanding Parent. * Angry Child is fueled mainly by feelings of victimization or bitterness, leading towards negativity, pessimism, jealousy, and rage. While experiencing this schema mode, a patient may have urges to yell, scream, throw/break things, or possibly even injure themself or harm others. The Angry Child schema mode is enraged, anxious, frustrated, self-doubting, feels unsupported in ideas and vulnerable. * Impulsive Child is the mode where anything goes. Behaviors of the Impulsive Child schema mode may include reckless driving, substance abuse, cutting oneself, suicidal thoughts, gambling, or fits of rage, such as punching a wall when \\"triggered\\" or laying blame of circumstantial difficulties upon innocent people. Unsafe sex, rash decisions to run away from a situation without resolution, tantrums perceived by peers as infantile, and so forth are a mere few of the behaviors which a patient in this schema mode might display. Impulsive Child is the rebellious and careless schema mode. * Detached Protector is based in escape. Patients in Detached Protector schema mode withdraw, dissociate, alienate, or hide in some way. This may be triggered by numerous stress factors or feelings of being overwhelmed. When a patient with insufficient skills is in a situation involving excessive demands, it can trigger a Detached Protector response mode. Stated simply, patients become numb in order to protect themselves from the harm or stress of what they fear is to come, or to protect themselves from fear of the unknown in general. * Abandoned Child is the mode in which a patient may feel defective in some way, thrown aside, unloved, obviously alone, or may be in a \\"me against the world\\" mindset. The patient may feel as though peers, friends, family, and even the entire world have abandoned them. Behaviors of patients in Abandoned Child mode may include (but are not limited to) falling into major depression, pessimism, feeling unwanted, feeling unworthy of love, and perceiving personality traits as irredeemable flaws. Rarely, a patient's self- perceived flaws may be intentionally withheld on the inside; when this occurs, instead of showing one's true self, the patient may appear to others as \\"egotistical\\", \\"attention-seeking\\", selfish, distant, and may exhibit behaviors unlike their true nature. The patient might create a narcissistic alter-ego/persona in order to escape or hide the insecurity from others. Due to fear of rejection, of feeling disconnected from their true self and poor self-image, these patients, who truly desire companionship/affection, may instead end up pushing others away. * Punitive Parent is identified by beliefs of a patient that they should be harshly punished, perhaps due to feeling \\"defective\\", or making a simple mistake. The patient may feel that they should be punished for even existing. Sadness, anger, impatience, and judgment are directed to the patient and from the patient. The Punitive Parent has great difficulty in forgiving themself even under average circumstances in which anyone could fall short of their standards. The Punitive Parent does not wish to allow for human error or imperfection, thus punishment is what this mode seeks. * Healthy Adult is the mode that schema therapy aims to help a patient achieve as the long-lasting state of well-being. The Healthy Adult is comfortable making decisions, is a problem-solver, thinks before acting, is appropriately ambitious, sets limits and boundaries, nurtures self and others, forms healthy relationships, takes on all responsibility, sees things through, and enjoys/partakes in enjoyable adult activities and interests with boundaries enforced, takes care of their physical health, and values themself. In this schema mode the patient focuses on the present day with hope and strives toward the best tomorrow possible. The Healthy Adult forgives the past, no longer sees themself as a victim (but as a survivor), and expresses all emotions in ways which are healthy and cause no harm. Techniques in schema therapy Treatment plans in schema therapy generally encompass three basic classes of techniques: cognitive, experiential, and behavioral (in addition to the basic healing components of the therapeutic relationship). Cognitive strategies expand on standard cognitive behavioral therapy techniques such as listing pros and cons of a schema, testing the validity of a schema, or conducting a dialogue between the \\"schema side\\" and the \\"healthy side\\". Experiential and emotion focused strategies expand on standard Gestalt therapy psychodrama and imagery techniques. Behavioral pattern-breaking strategies expand on standard behavior therapy techniques, such as role playing an interaction and then assigning the interaction as homework. One of the most central techniques in schema therapy is the use of the therapeutic relationship, specifically through a process called \\"limited reparenting\\". Specific techniques often used in schema therapy include flash cards with important therapeutic messages, created in session and used by the patient between sessions, and the schema diary—a template or workbook that is filled out by the patient between sessions and that records the patient's progress in relation to all the theoretical concepts in schema therapy. Schema therapy and psychoanalysis From an integrative psychotherapy perspective, limited reparenting and the experiential techniques, particularly around changing modes, could be seen as actively changing what psychoanalysis has described as object relations. Historically, mainstream psychoanalysis tended to reject active techniques—such as Fritz Perls' Gestalt therapy work or Franz Alexander's \\"corrective emotional experience\\"—but contemporary relational psychoanalysis (led by analysts such as Lewis Aron, and building on the ideas of earlier unorthodox analysts such as Sándor Ferenczi) is more open to active techniques.These historical influences on schema therapy, as well as many other influences, are discussed by David Edwards & Arnoud Arntz in \\"Schema therapy in historical perspective\\", in ; Edwards & Arntz say that \\"the most important influence\\" on Young's development of schema therapy was the work of constructivist psychologists Vittorio Guidano and Giovanni Liotti. It is notable that in a head to head comparison of a psychoanalytic object relations treatment (Otto F. Kernberg's transference focused psychotherapy) and schema therapy, the latter had significantly better outcomes. Outcome studies on schema therapy=Schema therapy vs transference focused psychotherapy outcomes Dutch investigators, including Josephine Giesen-Bloo and Arnoud Arntz (the project leader), compared schema therapy (also known as schema focused therapy or SFT) with transference focused psychotherapy (TFP) in the treatment of borderline personality disorder. 86 patients were recruited from four mental health institutes in the Netherlands. Patients in the study received two sessions per week of SFT or TFP for three years. After three years, full recovery was achieved in 45% of the patients in the SFT condition, and in 24% of those receiving TFP. One year later, the percentage fully recovered increased to 52% in the SFT condition and 29% in the TFP condition, with 70% of the patients in the SFT group achieving \\"clinically significant and relevant improvement\\". Moreover, the dropout rate was only 27% for SFT, compared with 50% for TFP. Patients began to feel and function significantly better after the first year, with improvement occurring more rapidly in the SFT group. There was continuing improvement in subsequent years. Thus investigators concluded that both treatments had positive effects, with schema therapy clearly more successful. Less intensive outpatient, individual schema therapy Dutch investigators, including Marjon Nadort and Arnoud Arntz, assessed the effectiveness of schema therapy in the treatment of borderline personality disorder when utilized in regular mental health care settings. A total of 62 patients were treated in eight mental health centers located in the Netherlands. The treatment was less intensive along a number of dimensions including a shift from twice weekly to once weekly sessions during the second year. Despite this, there was no lessening of effectiveness with recovery rates that were at least as high and similarly low dropout rates. Pilot study of group schema therapy for borderline personality disorder Investigators Joan Farrell, Ida Shaw and Michael Webber at the Indiana University School of Medicine Center for BPD Treatment & Research tested the effectiveness of adding an eight-month, 30-session schema therapy group to treatment-as-usual (TAU) for borderline personality disorder (BPD) with 32 patients. The dropout rate was 0% for those patients who received group schema therapy in addition to TAU and 25% for those who received TAU alone. At the end of treatment, 94% of the patients who received group schema therapy in addition to TAU compared to 16% of the patients receiving TAU alone no longer met BPD diagnostic criteria. The schema therapy group treatment led to significant reductions in symptoms and global improvement in functioning. The large positive treatment effects found in the group schema therapy study suggest that the group modality may augment or catalyze the active ingredients of the treatment for BPD patients. As of 2014, a collaborative randomized controlled trial is under way at 14 sites in six countries to further explore this interaction between groups and schema therapy.

The six treatise are Tattva-, Bhagavat-, Paramatma-, Krishna-, Bhakti-, and Priti-sandarbha. Jiva's Krama-sandarbha commentary on the Bhagavata Purana is often described as the \\"seventh\\" of the six Sandarbhas. The six sandarbhas are sometimes called the Bhagavata-sandarbha, not to be confused with the second treatise titled Bhagavat-sandarbha. The word \\"sandarbha\\" literally means \\"weaving\\" or \\"arranging\\"; the Bhagavata-sandarbha, his main philosophical work, is a thematic arrangement of the Bhagavata Purana, which presents Caitanya Vaishnavism in a systematic and comprehensive way. Gupta places this composition as an early work due to references in latter works such as Radha- krsnarcana-dipika, Krama-sandarbha, Dig-darsini, Durgama-sangamini, and Gopalacampu. Brzezinski dates the composition between Jiva's Madhava-mahotsava in 1555 and published praises of Jiva in 1561. According to Jiva Goswami, Gopala Bhatta Goswami had already done the preliminary work on Sat Sandarbhas but did not complete it. Jiva took the work of Gopala Bhatta and expanded it into six parts, systematically presenting the philosophy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and providing scriptural evidences. Jiva Goswami also wrote an extensive commentary to the first four Sandarbhas called Sarva-saṁvādinī. The Jiva Institute of Dr. Satyanarayana Dasa based in Vrindavan is engaged in what Lucian Wong calls an \\"ambitious Sandarbha translation project\\".  Tattva- sandarbha  Tattva-Sandarbha is a treatise on the various types of evidences (pramanas) used in Vedic philosophy, concluding that shabda (divine sound in the form of the Vedic scriptures) is the highest, and of all the scriptures, the Bhagavata Purana is the highest pointing to the Absolute Truth.

He received the UNESCO prize during the 7th Havana Biennial with the artists' collective DUPP (Desde Una Pragmática Pedagógica). Biography Yoan Capote lives and works in Havana where he studied arts at the Superior Institute of Art from 1991 to 1995. Even if he first specialized in painting, he finally decided to improve his sculpture skills, considering the latter as a way of developing three-dimensional and multi-sensory possibilities. He is already recognized in the Cuban art circles - as a promising artist. His work, known to be “solid”, “irreverent”, “provocative”, and “non-conformist” – according to some art critics – deals principally with interactions between individuals and his psychological experiences. Several of his pieces often merges human organs with inanimate objects, rearranges the human body and reinvents the purpose of everyday life objects: the sculpture Nostalgia, which features an ordinary suitcase unzipped to reveal a wall of bricks, can be seen as a metaphor for nomadism and its limits, the wall of bricks standing for our own impediments we all carry with us wherever we go. Yoan Capote follows the line of many other internationally-known artists, working at the same time with different medias and genres (painting, photography, performance sculptures and installations). One of his works entitled Open Mind 2006 is a labyrinth based on the drawing of the human brain where people can walk. People become metaphors for neurons transmitting information as they walk around the maze. This work inspires reflection on the interrelation among persons, who attempt to coexist with each other.

Adams (December 19, 1847 – after January 1923), commonly known as Yank Adams, was a professional carom billiards player who specialized in finger billiards, in which a player directly manipulates the balls with his or her hands, instead of using an implement such as a cue stick, often by twisting the ball between one's thumb and middle finger. Adams, who was sometimes billed as the \\"Digital Billiard Wonder\\", has been called the \\"greatest of all digit billiards players\\", and the \\"champion digital billiardist of the World.\\" George F. Slosson, a top billiards player of Adams' era, named him the \\"greatest exhibition player who ever lived.\\" Adams' exhibitions drew audiences of 1,000 or more, leaving standing room only, even in small venues. Adams' career began when he found his aptitude for bowling translated to the playing of billiards. One day when he was 25 years old, he picked up some billiard balls and began to \\"bowl\\" on the table and soon discovered he could manipulate the balls with great accuracy in this manner. Largely self-taught, Adams thereafter amassed a large repertoire of finger billiards shots. He engaged a manager and began to give performances, his first was at an engagement in New York City. Later, Adams traveled extensively, giving exhibitions and taking on challengers in cities across the United States and some in Europe. During his travels, Adams performed before the Vanderbilts, the Goulds, three U.S. Presidents, the Prince of Wales in London, and the Comte de Paris in Paris. One of the largest matches ever played of any form of billiards took place at Manhattan's Gilmore's Gardens in 1878. Adams played using his fingers against William Sexton, the reigning cue champion of the world, who used a cue; Adams won the three-day competition in the game of straight rail. Early life Adams was raised in Norwich, Connecticut, which led to him being nicknamed \\"Yank\\" later in life. From a young age, he exhibited the substantial hand strength required for finger billiards. When he was less than a year old, he could hurt his mother with his grip; she gave him chunks of bread to squeeze instead. Adams was large for his age, and in 1863, he disguised his youth, and joined the Eighteenth Connecticut Volunteers, with whom he served for three years, fighting for the Union in the American Civil War. After being discharged, Adams worked as a carpenter from 1872 to 1875, and then became a traveling salesman for the American Sterling-Silver Company. Beginnings in billiards 1887 Yank Adams cigarette card issued by Allen & Ginter Adams finger billiards and exhibition work had its germination in his early bowling interest. By the time he was 17, Adams was an adept bowler; he often gave informal exhibitions of bowling tricks such as \\"cocked hat\\", \\"back frame\\", and letting the head pin remain standing. In a 1913 interview, Adams said that, \\"[i]n those days we rolled what was termed 'skew ball', similar to the put on a cue ball in Billiards.\\" When Adams was 25 he was employed as a traveling salesman for the Derby Silver Company in New York. One day, while he was waiting for customers in a Poughkeepsie hotel, he strolled into a billiard room, took six pool balls over to a billiard table, and commenced to \\"bowl\\". The attention of everyone in the room was attracted by the manner in which Adams made the ball travel. One man asked for the privilege of placing the balls in a certain position for Adams to bowl at; Adams made the shot easily. This started Adams' career as a finger billiard expert. In the next town he traveled to, he hired a table, performed the same stunts with the balls, and added a few new shots. For three months after that Adams practiced various shots each day, and some of the shots he developed during that time became part of his regular exhibition repertoire. When he returned to New York, Adams met with Maurice Daly, then the \\"dean of billiards\\". Daly listened to Adams' story, and said that he was not aware that any startling shots could be accomplished using only the hands. Daly offered Adams a set of four balls, and sat down to watch Adams. After 12 shots, Daly became greatly interested, often asking Adams to repeat shots. At the end of the performance, Daly told Adams that if he ever entertained any idea of entering the billiards field he would give Adams an engagement at his room. Professional career=International success Poster for a March 12, 1889 Yank Adams exhibition in New York City As Adams became more involved with billiards, he gave up his job with the silver company. Adams went to Sexton's billiard parlor in the Bowery and Sexton employed Adams at Miner's Bowery Theatre at $115 a week. Adams sought to employ a manager as was typical of billiards professionals of the time; he was taken on by Billy O'Brien, a well known sports authority and one-time pugilist who managed Dominick McCaffrey later in his career. O'Brien organized an exhibition tour of the United States for Adams. Three months into the tour, Adams reached Chicago, where he played a three-week engagement for Billy Emmett at $500 a week. After leaving the stage, Adams opened at O'Connor's billiard room, at Fourteenth Street and Fourth Avenue, where he played nightly for a year. Adams then resumed traveling, and gave exhibitions in nearly every city in the United States and a large number of cities in Europe. In 1868 Adams appeared before the Prince of Wales in London and the Comte de Paris in Paris. While in London, John Roberts, Jr. offered Adams $300 per week for one year to play afternoon and evening at his Argyle Rooms. After playing for the Comte de Paris, the Frenchmen wanted Adams to state his figures for an indefinite period. Adams also played for three Presidents of the United States; while in New York he was paid $100 per night by the Vanderbilt and Gould families. Bullocks Billiard Guide said that Adams had earned more than $70,000 for exhibition alone over seven years, which was more than the combined earnings of all other listed billiardists. Though champion players with cues sometimes dabbled in finger billiards, it was said even of such greats as Jacob Schaefer, George Slosson, and Eugene Carter that \\"their work, compared with that of the Finger Wonder, is like a novice playing an expert.\\" Public exhibitions Advertisement for comedy play, Billiards, sponsored by Yank Adams and William Sexton. Prior to the performance, Adams and Sexton would play a billiard match for the audience. Adams' first major public exhibition in New York was held on January 31, 1878, at the Union Square Billiard Rooms before a large audience; he performed there nightly for a week. Reporting on the first night of the event, The New York Times wrote: > The intricacy of the various shots he played, as well as the marvelous > accuracy with which they were executed, frequently roused the spectators to > an unusual pitch of enthusiasm.... Many of Adams' shots are entirely new, > never having been attempted before by any billiards expert. Among them may > be mentioned the wonderful \\"bottle\\" shot with which last evening's > exhibition was brought to a close. Two soda-water bottles were placed at the > head of the left-hand rail, about a foot apart, a red ball being placed in > the mouth of each bottle. A white ball was next placed against the right- > hand rail, directly opposite the lower bottle. Everything being in > readiness, Adams then took the remaining white ball in his hand, and > masseing upon the ball in the mouth of the upper bottle, jumped his ball to > the ball in the mouth of the other bottle, whence, falling upon the table it > was carried by a reverse \\"English\\" to the middle of the top rail, whence it > glided with unerring accuracy to the right-hand rail and caromed upon the > first-mentioned white ball, its successful execution being greeted with > great applause. Competitive play and rivalries The Sun: Diagrams of 12 of 13 Yank Adams' finger billiard shots he devised for exhibition. Adams described them as \\"a baker's dozen ways of making one shot\\". Each shot shows a different method of making a straight rail count from the same starting position. =M. Adrian Izar= Prior to Adams' performances, finger billiards had been demonstrated in New York by French player M. Adrien Izar, who had astonished spectators with an exhibition held on September 20, 1875, before which the game was little known in the United States. In France and England, Izar was considered the game's champion player. The night before his 1878 exhibition, Adams received a telegram in which Izar challenged him to play for the championship and named Chicago as the venue for contest. Adams replied that he was unwilling to leave New York at that time, but that he would pay Izar's expenses to travel to New York. Adams later issued the following statement to newspapers: > I have never intended to play a public match in my line, having never > arrogated to myself a superiority above other hand billiard players, > although I have deemed myself the equal of any one living in my line, not > excepting Mons. Izar, by whom continually letters are written, whose > contents have for their purpose a derogation of my skill. That this may be > checked, and summarily, I would state that I am willing to play Mons. Izar a > match game for $500 a side, in New York City, Boston or Chicago, on a 5x10 > table, full size balls and Collender cushion; the championship and gate > money to be awarded the player showing the greatest variety of shots in > connection with accuracy, and in all giving the most interesting exhibition > of finger billiards. =William Sexton= On March 15, 1878, a billiards match of straight rail began that lasted three days at the game The match was between Adams and William Sexton, then the cue champion of the world, at Manhattan's Gilmore's Gardens—the predecessor venue of Madison Square Garden. The match pitted Adams' finger billiards against Sexton using a cue, for a purse of $500. The audience was one of the largest that had ever witnessed a billiards game. The terms of the contest stated that on each day of the match, Adams was required to score 2,000 points, while Sexton needed only 1,000. On the first day of the match, Adams scored 1,110 points using finger billiards. Despite Adams' impressive opening performance, by the third day of the match, Sexton was far in the lead. In Dewey-Defeats-Truman-style, many newspapers reported that Sexton won the tournament, as their reporters left the venue at a time when Sexton had a seemingly indomitable lead and before the match was over. The New York Times, for example, reported that Sexton won the match, though they leavened the result by reporting that despite the prize fund, it was a \\"friendly match\\", geared toward exhibition, and that \\"Adams could undoubtedly have run the game out on three occasions, but preferred to make 'display' shots in place of his usual \\"nurse\\" play, against which a cue player stands no chance whatever.\\" However, with Sexton needed only seven points to win the championship, Adams stepped to the table and ran out, making 1,181 points in a row to win the match. =Louis Shaw= Adams' chief professional rivalry in later years was with Louis Shaw. In 1891 Adams and Shaw disagreed about the format of the finger billiards championship which they would both contest that year. Adams wanted the match to be played for a $500 stake, while Shaw wanted the receipts to be donated to the local firemen's fund. Other accomplishments In 1879, Adams was chosen to be the official referee for the championship Collender Billiard Tournament held at Tammany Hall. It was contested by top players Marice Daly, Albert Garnier, Eugene Carter, A. P. Rudolphe, Randolph Heiser, William Sexton, George F. Slosson, and \\"the Wizard\\", Jacob Schaefer, Sr. at the newly introduced carom billiards discipline called the champion's game, an intermediary game between straight railstraight rail and balkine. In 1889, Adams broke the world record run for successive straight rail points in a match with champion player Jacob Schaefer Sr., in which Adams scored 4,962 counts in a row, which was 2,400 points more than any prior competition high run, albeit with his fingers rather than with a cue. Adams stated in an interview in his later years that his personal high run was 6,900 consecutive straight rail counts. In 1890, Adams returned to Paris after signing a contract with Eugene Carter to play at Carter's billiard academy for thirteen weeks at 1,000 francs (approximately $200) per week. Afterwards, Adams went in London, under the management of M. Farini, to play at the room of John Roberts, Jr. On a previous trip to London in 1887, Roberts offered Adams £60 a week for six months to give exhibitions, but Adams declined, citing a need to superintend his sporting journal. Adams was the editor and proprietor of The Chicago Sporting Journal, and the general manager of the New York Sporting and Theatrical Journal. Through his association with the sporting journals, Adams was an intermediary for the issuance of challenge matches, such as boxing bouts. He held the winning stake and distributed the winnings upon the event's conclusion. Adams owned a number of billiard parlors during his lifetime, including two in Chicago—one named the White Elephant, another called the Academy Billiard Hall, and one on Union Square at 60 East 14th Street in New York City. Adams' business cards, in 1877, said, \\"Yank Adams, champion finger billiardist of the world. Residence immaterial.\\" Later life Brooklyn Daily Eagle Adams continued to give exhibitions and was still able to perform well into his later years. For example, the New Rochelle Pioneer newspaper reported that Adams gave an exhibition on December 21, 1915 at 68 years of age, at Chamberlain's Derby Billiard Academy in New Rochelle, New York, and that he was \\"at his best and made some exceptionally brilliant shots in the presence of 300 lovers of the game. While at the table he kept up a continuous humorous monologue to the great pleasure of his audience.\\" In 1919, when Adans was 71, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported that he gave an exhibition before a large audience at Lawler Brothers Billiard Academy of Brooklyn. In 1923, when Adams was 76, the following newspaper story appeared in The Salt Lake Tribune, telling of his whereabouts: > Perhaps you old fellows, too, thought Yank had passed on, but he turned up > in New York the other day and is now spending his last days in a Bronx flat. > There was a time when Yank Adams was known in every billiard room in > America. He was as much at home in Eddie Graney's room at San Francisco as > at Tom Foley's in Chicago of Maurice Daly's in New York, and he knew all the > billiard players and big and little room keepers from coast to coast.

Adams, known the world over as \\"Yank\\" > Adams, at one time and even now the world's only finger billiardist who can > make all the apparently impossible shots on the table without the aid of a > cue. Adams is 76 years old, and after fifty years of exhibitions all over > the world has retired from active work to live in the Bronx and conduct a > billiard academy of his own at Burnside and Creston avenues in New York with > his business manager for the last ten years, Samuel Polakoff. Yank now lives > at 635 West 136th street In New York. When I told Tom Foley, the daddy of > all the roommkeepers, that Yank Adams was back in the business he laughed > and said: \\"I thought Yank had cashed in. But he's like all those billiard > players. They never die.\\" Style of play The Sun. Adams played only with his fingers, disdaining the cue stick entirely. He was known for his skill at finger billiards and for the quickness of his play. In exhibitions it was sometimes advertised that Adams would attempt to make 100 shots in 100 seconds. He would always begin by \\"feeling out\\" the cushions on the table, as the speed of the tables varied almost nightly, some fast and some slow. Adams would sometimes accept challenge matches at his performances. For example, at an exhibition held in Omaha, Nebraska, on November 20, 1889, Adams played against twenty of the best players in the city. Adams manipulated the balls with his fingers, while his opponents used cues and were given a handicap equivalent to a 1,000 point lead. Adams performed about 80 shots per exhibition. He had a large repertoire of practiced shots—more than 500—affording him the luxury to not having to repeat a single shot during a week-long exhibition. The abundance of shots was unusual, and was described by one sports writer as \\"more extensive than the entire billiard fraternity put together\\". The following description of Adams' shots appeared in an 1891 newspaper article, which highlighted them as, \\"among his difficult feats\\": > Two quart wine bottles are placed at the short end of the table, three feet > apart; a ball is placed on the top of each bottle, and a third ball, six > feet from the bottles in the opposite corner. Adams makes the hand ball jump > from bottle to bottle then to take an English in space, counting on the > third bail, a double shot. > > Fifteen balls are placed in a line, three inches apart. On the last ball is > placed a piece of chalk, while two feet from the other end, at a square > angle, is placed a single ball. Yank drops the hand ball with a Massé twist, > which, after hitting the single ball, describes a semi-circle, taken the > cushion first, then makes a carrom on the fifteen balls, but is played with > such a delicate calculation as barely to reach the last ball; in fact, > freezes against it so gently as not to dislodge the chalk previously placed > thereon. > > A derby hat is placed on the table, under which is a ball. One foot from the > hat are two balls a foot apart, which he carroms on, the hand ball continues > striking the rim of the hat, forces it up, and goes under making the stroke > on the third ball, then returns from under the hat when it rocks the second > time. > > He also stand at the head of the table, throwing the balls with a hundred- > yard force but has them stop eight feet away in such a position as to spell > his name. In an article in the St. Paul Daily Globe, the reporter summed up the events of Adams' exhibition on April 26, 1888: > The great finger billiard exhibition came off last night at the Standard > billiard hall to a packed house, and those who saw Yank Adams handle the > spheres were more than delighted.... Shot after shot were made in lightning > rapidity, spotting the ball, running the whole length of the rail, crossing > over, with two cushions and counting, going under hats and in between them, > cutting the letter S and making the carom, jump shots, masses and hundreds > of others too complicated to put in type. Mr. A.M. Doherty played a game > with the exhibitor, and at twenty-eight points left the balls in a scattered > position, which were gathered at one shot by Mr. Adams, who made fifty shots > in sixty seconds. What seemed his most difficult shot was that of placing > fifteen balls in a line, and a piece of chalk on the last ball. The hand > ball was then dropped a distance of two feet, described a semi-circle, > making a carom on all of the balls and freezing against the last ball. > Adams' finger shots discount Schaeffer, Slosson and J. Carter combined. The public flocked to Adams' exhibitions; often the pool room where he was performing could barely contain the crowd. When Adams performed in Rochester, New York in 1892, the local paper reported that \\"[n]o man in these broad acres can draw the crowd \\"Yank\\" Adams does when an exhibition with the ivories is the card. Last night's crowd was banked up, against the walls, twenty deep in someplaces and many witnessed the exhibition from the table tops and window ledges.\\" ReferencesExternal links Category:American carom billiards players Category:Sportspeople from Norwich, Connecticut Category:Year of death missing Category:19th-century American people Category:Place of death missing Category:1847 births Category:20th-century deaths ","title":"Yank Adams"},{"id":"25849638","text":"Billbergia violacea is a plant species in the genus Billbergia.

He was awarded the Max Planck Medal in 1979 and the Albert Einstein Medal in 1989 for all his work. Biography Fierz's father Hans Eduard Fierz was a chemist with Geigy and later a professor at ETH Zurich, his mother was Linda Fierz-David. Fierz studied at the Realgymnasium in Zurich. In 1931 he began his studies in Göttingen, where he listened to the lectures of such luminaries as Hermann Weyl. In 1933 he returned to Zurich and studied physics at ETH under Wolfgang Pauli and Gregor Wentzel. In 1936 he earned a doctoral degree with his thesis on the infrared catastrophe in quantum electrodynamics. Fierz could not convince Heisenberg of the existence of the divergences. Afterward he went to Werner Heisenberg in Leipzig and in 1936 became an assistant to Wolfgang Pauli in Zurich. For his habilitation degree in 1939 he treated in his thesis relativistic fields with arbitrary spins (with and without mass) and proved the Spin-statistics theorem for free fields. In 1940, Pauli gave a complete proof. For quantum electrodynamics the work was extended. The work on relativistic fields with arbitrary spins was later important in supergravity. In 1940 he became Privatdozent in Basel and 1943 assistant professor. From 1944 to 1959 he was a professor for theoretical physics in Basel. In 1950 he was at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he met Res Jost. In 1959 he led the theoretical physics department at CERN in Geneva for one year and in 1960 he became the successor of his teacher Pauli at ETH. In 1977 he retired there as an emeritus professor. Fierz also worked on gravitational theory but published only one paper on the subject. In 1940 he married Menga Biber; they became acquainted through making music (he played the violin). Their marriage produced two sons.  Publications   * * M. Fierz, ’Spinors’, in Proceedings of the International Conference on Relativistic Theories of Gravitation, London, July 1965, H.

Hatadage (Sinhala: ) is an ancient relic shrine in the city of Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka. It was built by King Nissanka Malla, and had been used to keep the Relic of the tooth of the Buddha. The Hatadage had been built using stone, brick and wood, although only parts of the brick and stone walls now remain. It appears to have been a two-storey structure, but the upper storey has now been destroyed. Three Buddha statues carved out of granite rock are located within a chamber of the shrine.  Location  The Hatadage is located in the ancient city of Polonnaruwa, in the North Central province of Sri Lanka. It is close to the northern edge of the Dalada Maluva there, the quadrangular area which contains some of the oldest and most sacred monuments of the city. Its entrance, which is oriented to the south, directly faces the entrance of the Polonnaruwa Vatadage. The Galpotha stone inscription is near its eastern side, while the Atadage lies to its west.  History and name  The Hatadage was built by King Nissanka Malla (1187–1196), as a shrine to house the Relic of the tooth of the Buddha. Several historical sources including the Rajaveliya, Poojavaliya and the Galpotha inscription itself mention that it was built in sixty hours. Since the Sinhalese word Hata means sixty and Dage means relic shrine, it is possible that the structure was named Hatadage to commemorate this feat. Another theory is that it is so named because it held sixty relics. The tooth relic was presumably kept in the upper storey.  Structure  The three Buddha statues inside the shrine. Centered and taller Buddha statue at the house The shrine is surrounded by a stone wall, long and wide. On its southern side is a doorway decorated with stone carvings, leading to a stone paved terrace. The main entrance to the shrine, which is also decorated with stone carvings and a sandakada pahana, is directly in front of it. Another smaller doorway is placed on the eastern side of the shrine. The shrine has had a wooden superstructure with a tiled roof. However, only the walls now remain. The walls of the shrine are made of brick, and the outer walls are covered with stone plates. The main entrance leads to a small chamber, in length and in width. The base of its walls are decorated with designs of lotus flowers and lions. This chamber contains six stone columns and a staircase that had led to the upper floor. The square shaped main chamber is located to the rear of this outer chamber. Each of its sides are in length and contains four windows. The chamber had contained sixteen stone columns, although only three now remain. At the center of this chamber are three standing Buddha statues carved from granite. These are also partially destroyed. The statue in the middle is in height, while the other two are each.  3D Documentation  A 3D documentation done by the Zamani Project of the Hatadage in Polonnaruwa was carried out in 2019. 3D models, a Panorama tour, plans and images can be view here.

With up to 500,000 visitors a year, it is one of the most popular beaches in the Copenhagen area, although it attracts somewhat fewer Copenhageners since the inauguration of the Amager Beach Park and the Copenhagen Harbour Baths in 2005. Bellevue is a 700-metre-long sandy beach with adjoining lawns. The characteristic blue-striped, almost cartoonish, lifeguard towers and the geometric kiosks were designed by Danish architect and furniture designer Arne Jacobsen in 1932. History In the 1930s, when the right to vacation became legally mandated, Denmark's coastline became the country's most popular holiday destination. Gentofte Municipality made plans to develop a piece of coastline north of Copenhagen into a seaside resort complex combining an existing park designed by the landscape architect C.Th. Sørensen with beach facilities catering to some 15,000 paying visitors a day. Three architects were invited to submit plans for a Bellevue beach complex.\\"Bellevue- Bellavista\\", Momoneco. Retrieved 20 October 2011. The winner was the young architect Arne Jacobsen, who had just opened his office. Characteristic of his approach to architecture and design--he was preoccupied with the concept of Gesamtkunst--Jacobsen designed everything from bathing cabins, lifeguard towers and kiosks to tickets and uniforms for the staff. The complex also included the Bellavista apartment buildings (1934), a restaurant and the Bellevue Theatre (1936), all of which still stand today in the immediate vicinity of the beach. The quest for recreation by the growing masses called for physical as well as social solutions and change. A political initiative provided the pre-requisites for creating a beach at Bellevue. In June 1932 the Bellevue beach was inaugurated by Danish Prime Minister Thorvald Stauning. It immediately became the most popular summer resort in Copenhagen. A direct return tram ticket from the city to Bellevue, including the beach entrance fee, was at the affordable price of 30 øre (less than five cents). In popular culture * In the song Hot, the second track on their debut album Nik & Jay, Danish Hip-Hop/pop duo Nik & Jay describe a drive up the coast from Copenhagen and the amazing sunset from Bellevue. However, situated on an east- facing coast, there is no sunset to be seen at that particular location.

Gameplay Brat is an isometric action puzzle in which the player guides Nathan, the brat of the title, through a series of twelve levels. The isometric landscape scrolls up- screen, imposing a time limit on each level. Whilst Nathan automatically walks forwards at the same rate, if he is diverted he will begin to lag behind. If the screen catches up with him, the player loses one of three lives and must restart the level. Nathan is not controlled directly: the player must place icons onto the level to guide his movement. There are a variety of items that can be collected by Nathan, then later placed by the player to bypass certain obstacles: deadly spring toys can be suppressed with a lead weight, and building blocks can bridge gaps, for example. Reception Brat met with moderate critical success, drawing comparison with Lemmings. Reviewers praised the game's intuitive interface, challenging but achievable puzzles, clear graphical style, and original, addictive gameplay. However, the game was criticised for its unforgiving nature when the player makes slight errors, as was some excessive disk access. CU Amiga found the gameplay to be \\"tedious and long-winded\\", the level restarts too frustrating, and the puzzle elements compared unfavourably with Lemmings.

Some bienes enjoy international protection as World Heritage Sites or Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.  History  In Spain the category of Bien de Interés Cultural dates from 1985 when it replaced the former heritage category of Monumento nacional (national monument) in order to extend protection to a wider range of cultural property. The category has been translated as \\"Cultural Interest Asset\\". Monumentos are now identified as one of the sub-categories of Bien de Interés Cultural.  Sub-categories  Jardín histórico: Royal Botanical Garden, Madrid The movable heritage designated as Bienes de Interes Cultural (\\"Cultural Interest Assets\\") includes archeological artefacts, archives and large works of art. Such protected objects may well be kept in a building which is itself a BIC. *Non- movable heritage is divided into the following classifications: **Monumento (monument) **Conjunto histórico (historical ensemble, group or set) **Jardín histórico (historical garden, e.g. the Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid) **Sitio histórico (literally a historic site, the term is used for cultural landscapes, e.g. Riotinto mines) **Zona arqueológica (archaeological area or zone, e.g. Archaeological Site of Atapuerca) Regional variants This village is recognised as a Conjunto Etnológico. Under the Spanish system regions maintain their own registers of cultural heritage (see Patrimonio histórico español). There have been some differences in approach between autonomous communities. An example is bullfighting (which at a national level is now regulated by the Ministry of Culture). Madrid's regional government considers that bullfighting events should be protected as cultural heritage, whereas in Catalonia a ban on bullfighting came into effect in 2012, although this was later overturned by the Supreme Court.

Although no longer serving with active infantry units, the Type 63 is still in People's Liberation Army service with specialized formations such as mountain infantry units and special forces detachments. The Type 63 was widely used in the PLA until the late 1980s. It was adopted as the successor of the Type 50-5 of 102mm. China has also developed a Type 63 multiple rocket launcher of 130mm. The RPU-14 is a Soviet 140mm MRL of similar design to the Type 63. Description A Type 63 mounted on a pickup truck used by the IRGC The launcher's 12 tubes are arranged in three removable rows of four each, mounted on a single-axle carriage with rubber tires. The Type 63 originally fired an 18.8 kilogram rocket (Type 63-2)JAA, p. 594. with a 1.3 kilogram warhead. Ammunition for the Type 63 was later improved (Type 75 and Type 81 series), although the overall weight of the rocket remained the same. A fixed amount of propellant is contained in the rocket motor. The steel-cased rocket is stabilized with spin imparted by six angled nozzles in its base. Type 63 rockets may be launched without the launcher; improvised firing can employ tubing, rails or even dirt berms. The Type 63 was distributed on the basis of six per infantry regiment, or 18 per infantry division.JAA, p. 593. For airborne and mountain units the lighter Type 63-I was developed. Both the Type 63 and its copies can be mounted on different kinds of armoured and unarmoured vehicles, for example the MT-LB, the Safir, the Mamba, the RG-32 Scout, the GAZ-66 and the M113. Licence versions The Type 63 and its rockets are license-built in several countries including: * Sudan – Taka.MIC page on Small Arms including Taka * Iran – Haseb-1 of D.I.O. with Fajr-1 rocket.Defense Industries Organization 2013 Catalog, Section 3: Rocket Industries Group. * South Africa – RO 107 of Mechem Developments. * North Korea – Type 75. * North Vietnam, Vietnam – H-12. * Turkey – T-107 of MKEK with rockets TR-107 \\"Anadolu\\" and TRB-107.http://www.acig.info/CMS/?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=190&Itemid;=47 * Egypt – RL812/TLC of the Helwan Machinery and Equipment Factory (Factory 999).

During World War II it was a concentration camp. Pre-World War II It originated at Bredtvet farm as a learning home (lærehjem) for young boys, erected 1918 and in use from 1919 to 1923. In 1923 the state took over the property from Det norske lærehjem- og verneforbund. In 1929 it was decided to turn the property into a juvenile center with teaching of labour skills; the green light was given in 1939. This plan did not materialize, as the construction of the facility was halted by war. Concentration camp In 1940, Norway was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany. From 1941 the Nazi collaborationist party Nasjonal Samling used Bredtveit as a political prison. It bore a similarity to Falstad concentration camp, in the original purpose of the facility. People incarcerated at Bredtveit during the war included several professors arrested during the crackdown on the University of Oslo in October 1943: Johan Christian Schreiner, Odd Hassel, Ragnar Frisch, Johannes Andenæs, Carl Jacob Arnholm, Bjørn Føyn, Eiliv Skard, Harald K. Schjelderup and Anatol Heintz. Also, a group of Jewish prisoners that arrived in Oslo after the departure of SS Donau stayed at Bredtveit. They left Bredtveit on 24 February 1943, and were shipped towards Auschwitz on the following day. Personnel in the camp include physician Hans Eng. Post-World War II In 1945, after the war was over, Bredtveit was used as a prison for women who awaited trial for collaboration, as a part of the legal purge in Norway after World War II. Later politician Aaslaug Aasland served as prison director in the initial period. From 1949 it was a general women's prison, which included a facility for forced labour. Forced labour ceased to exist in Norway in 1970, whereupon the prison got the name Bredtveit fengsel og sikringsanstalt. It is one of three women's prisons in Norway, the others being Sandefjord and Ravneberget. It has a capacity of 54 inmates.Official site of the prison Amongst the people incarcerated at Bredtveit after the war included Veronica Orderud and Kristin Kirkemo who were convicted in the Orderud murder case.

Lemuria is the name of a hypothetical \\"lost land\\" variously located in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It is said in Tamil legend to have been civilised for over 20,000 years, with its population speaking Tamil. The concept of Lemuria has been rendered obsolete by modern understanding of plate tectonics. However, it has still been used as a location and inspiration in a wide range of novels, television shows, films and music. Blavatsky, Elliot and Bramwell 1896 map of Lemuria superimposed over the modern continents from Scott-Elliott's The Story of Atlantis and Lost Lemuria. \\"Lemuria\\" entered the lexicon of the occult through the works of Helena Blavatsky, who claimed that the Mahatmas had shown her an ancient, pre-Atlantean Book of Dzyan. Lemuria is mentioned in one of the 1882 Mahatma Letters to A. P. Sinnett.The Mahatma Letters, XXIIIb According to L. Sprague de Camp, Blavatsky's concept of Lemuria was influenced by other contemporaneous writers on the theme of lost continents, notably Ignatius L. Donnelly, American cult leader Thomas Lake Harris and the French writer Louis Jacolliot. Within Blavatsky's complex cosmology, which includes seven \\"Root Races\\", the \\"Third Root Race\\" occupied Lemuria. She describes them as about tall, sexually hermaphroditic, egg-laying, mentally undeveloped and spiritually more pure than the following \\"Root Races\\". Before the coming of the Lemurians, the second \\"Root Race\\" is said to have dwelled in Hyperborea. After the subsequent creation of mammals, Mme Blavatsky revealed to her readers, some Lemurians turned to bestiality. The later theosophical author William Scott-Elliot gave one of the most elaborate accounts of lost continents. The English theosophist received his knowledge from Charles Webster Leadbeater, who reportedly communicated with the Theosophical Masters by \\"astral clairvoyance\\".See also Man: whence, how and whither, a record of clairvoyant investigation#In Lemuria In 1896 he published The Story of Atlantis, followed in 1904 by The Lost Lemuria, in which he included a map of the continent of Lemuria as stretching from the east coast of Africa across the Indian and the Pacific Oceans.The Lost Lemuria, at Sacred Texts.com James Bramwell portrayed Lemuria in his book, Lost Atlantis, as \\"a continent that occupied a large part of what is now the South Pacific Ocean\\".Bramwell, James. Lost Atlantis. (Hollywood: Newcastle, 1974), 193. He described the people of Lemuria in detail and characterized them as one of the \\"root-races of humanity\\". According to Bramwell, Lemurians are the ancestors of the Atlanteans, who survived the period \\"of the general racial decadence which affected the Lemurians in the last stages of their evolution\\". From \\"a select division of\\" the Atlanteans – after their promotion to decadence – Bramwell claims the Aryan race arose. \\"Lemurians, Atlanteans, and Aryans are root-races of humanity\\", according to Bramwell.Bramwell, 195.  Australia  Blavatsky theorised that Australia was a remnant inland region of Lemuria and that Aboriginal Australians and Aboriginal Tasmanians (which she identified as separate groups) were of Lemurian and Lemuro-Atlantean origin, after cross- breeding with animals. Her idea was subsequently developed in pseudo-histories and fiction of the white Australian popular culture of the 1890s and early 1900s, including the writings of nationalist Australian poet Bernard O'Dowd, author Rosa Campbell Praed in My Australian Girlhood, author John David Hennessey in An Australian Bush Track and George Firth Scott's novel The Last Lemurian: A Westralian Romance. Professor Robert Dixon theorises that the popularity of the idea of \\"lost races\\" like Lemurians and Atlanteans reflected the anxieties of colonial Australians, that \\"when Englishness is lost there is nothing to replace it\\". A. L. McCann attributes Praed's use of the Lemuria trope to an \\"attempt to create a lineage for white settlers without having to confront the annihilation of Indigenous people\\" (which Praed's father was involved in). Mount Shasta In 1894, Frederick Spencer Oliver published A Dweller on Two Planets, which claimed that survivors from a sunken continent called Lemuria were living in or on Mount Shasta in northern California. Oliver claimed the Lemurians lived in a complex of tunnels beneath the mountain and occasionally were seen walking the surface dressed in white robes. In 1931 Harvey Spencer Lewis using the pseudonym Wisar Spenle Cerve wrote a book (published by the Rosicrucians) about the hidden Lemurians of Mount Shasta that a bibliography on Mount Shasta described as \\"responsible for the legend's widespread popularity.\\" This belief has since been repeated by Guy Warren Ballard and the followers of the Ascended Masters and the Great White Brotherhood, The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse, Church Universal and Triumphant and Kryon. Kumari Kandam Some Tamil writers such as Devaneya Pavanar have associated Lemuria with Kumari Kandam, a legendary sunken landmass mentioned in the Tamil literature, claiming that it was the cradle of civilization.

Ivory from Genoels- Elderen, with four beasts; the basilisk was sometimes depicted as a bird with a long smooth tail.A clearer image of this depiction by Wenceslas Hollar is here Christ treading on the beasts is a subject found in Late Antique and Early Medieval art, though it is never common. It is a variant of the \\"Christ in Triumph\\" subject of the resurrected Christ,Schiller, I,29 and shows a standing Christ with his feet on animals, often holding a cross-staff which may have a spear-head at the bottom of its shaft, or a staff or spear with a cross-motif on a pennon. Some art historians argue that the subject exists in an even rarer pacific form as \\"Christ recognised by the beasts\\". Iconography The iconography derives from Biblical texts, in particular Psalm 91 (90):13:Psalm 91 in the Hebrew/Protestant numbering, 90 in the Greek/Catholic liturgical sequence - see Psalms#Numbering \\"super aspidem et basiliscum calcabis conculcabis leonem et draconem\\" in the Latin Vulgate, literally \\"The asp and the basilisk you will trample under foot/you will tread on the lion and the dragon\\", translated in the King James Version as: Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet\\".Other modern versions, such as the New International Version have a \\"cobra\\" for the basilisk, which may be closest to the Hebrew \\"pethen\\".Biblelexicon This was interpreted as a reference to Christ defeating and triumphing over Satan. Sometimes two beasts are shown, usually the lion and snake or dragon, and sometimes four, which are normally the lion, dragon, asp (snake) and basilisk (which was depicted with varying characteristics) of the Vulgate. All represented the devil, as explained by Cassiodorus and Bede in their commentaries on Psalm 91.Hilmo, 37 The verse was part of the daily monastic service of compline, and also sung in the Roman liturgy for Good Friday, the day of Christ's Crucifixion.Ó Carragaáin, screen 2, who has other details of liturgical uses of relevant texts. See also Chazelle, 77 The earliest appearance of the subject in a major work is a 6th-century mosaic of Christ, dressed as a general or emperor in military uniform, clean-shaven and with a cross-halo, in the Archbishop's Chapel, Ravenna. One arm holds open a book showing the text of John 14.6: \\"I am the way, and the truth, and the life\\", while the other holds the bottom of a cross resting across Christ's shoulder. Here the subject is thought to refer to the contemporary struggle of the Church against the Arian heresy, which denied the divine nature of Christ; the image asserts the orthodox doctrine.Hilmo, 37, Syndicus, 98; van der Meer, 121, who says \\"The strange mosaic ... has remained unique of its kind\\". A lion and snake are shown. The first depictions show Christ standing frontally, apparently at rest, standing on defeated beasts. From the late Carolingian period, the cross starts to end in a spear-head, which Christ may be shown driving down into a beast (often into the mouth of the serpent) in an energetic pose, using a compositional type more often (and earlier) found in images of the Archangel Michael fighting Satan.Hilmo, 49 In all the depictions mentioned above and below, up to the Errondo relief, Christ is beardless. Later still the beasts more often appear beneath the feet of a seated Christ in Majesty, becoming an occasional feature of this subject. Alternatively the beasts are replaced by a solitary snake trodden on by Christ. The more \\"militant\\" depictions are especially a feature of Anglo-Saxon art, which Meyer Schapiro attributes to \\"the primitive taste of the Anglo-Saxon tribes for imagery of heroic combats with wild beasts and monsters, as in Beowulf and the pagan legends.\\"Schapiro, 153 Notable examples The motif appears in several other works from the Carolingian period onwards, which include:For some further examples, see Schapiro, 153-160 * an ivory relief from Charlemagne's \\"Court School\\" on the detached back cover of the Lorsch Gospels, an illuminated manuscript Gospel book of about 810 (Vatican Museums, with four beasts).Schiller, I,29 * the central panel of the Carolingian ivory book cover of Bodleian Library, MS Douce 176, often known as the \\"Oxford book cover\\"; four beasts.Schapiro, 74 says it is \\"...of about 800 ... a work of the Ada School surely copied from an Early Christian model.\\" See also Schiller, I,29 and fig. 427 * another Carolingian ivory relief, also probably originally a book-cover, from Genoels-Elderen, now in Belgium, either a much more provincial version of Carolingian style, or Northumbrian;Carolingian with Insular influence, as well as similarities with works from Trier and northern France, according to Lasko, 13; Northumbrian according to Hilmo, 42, following John Beckwith's Ivory Carving in Early Medieval England (1972), of which view Lasko was aware from other sources - see his note 32 on p. 260. See also Schapiro, 128. There are four beasts. * the Anglo-Saxon stone Ruthwell Cross, with two matched beasts that have been described as \\"otter-like\\".Haney, 216, for the otters Christ has no cross, and stands with his hands held together in front of him. The image here, which is much the most discussed by scholars, partly because it is badly worn and hard to read, has been denied to be of the subject at all - see below.Schapiro's main thrust. Haney's chapter gives a completely different interpretation of the image. She and Hilmo's chapter 2 discuss the main literature. In particular Hilmo asserts that Fritz Saxl had misread a passage in Eusebius, seeing \\"adoratae\\" (adored) for the rare \\"adortae\\" (attacked), in reference to the beasts - Hilmo, 40 and 45. Here the image represents the divine nature of Christ, matching the slightly smaller image on the other main side of the shaft representing his human nature with Mary Magdalene drying his feet.Hilmo, 45 * the Anglo-Saxon Bewcastle Cross, a very similar depiction to the Ruthwell Cross.Schapiro, p. 152, illustrates the two side by side. * the late Carolingian illustration for Psalm 90 in the Utrecht Psalter shows Christ using the shaft of his cross, not yet a spear, as a weapon against the serpent.Hilmo, 49 * the Stuttgart Psalter, of similar date, below a Temptation, Christ's cross appears to end in a spear-point, which is plunged into the serpent.Hilmo, 49 * the ivory head of an early 11th- century tau cross in the British Museum.British Museum Tau cross. * the Crowland Psalter (Bodleian, MS Douce 296), Anglo-Saxon from the mid-11th century, with spear and two beasts, in what was to be a common pattern for psalters.Shapiro, 155 illustrates two other examples *An end of the shrine of Saint Hadelin, c. 1075, Church of St Martin, Visé; beardless Christ has a foot on each of the necks of two beats.Lasko, 181-183 and plate 196 * the \\"Errondo Tympanum\\" relief, by the Master of Cabestany (1150–1175), now in the Cloisters, New York, showing three figures of Christ (now bearded), each standing on a beast, in a combined scene of the Temptations.Schapiro, 156-57 (illustrated) * tympanum relief of c. 1216 at the church in Strzelno, Poland; two beasts beneath a seated Christ.Abstract of Polish paper *Gothic sculpture on the portal of Amiens Cathedral of standing blessing Christ and two beasts.Image of Amiens sculpture File:Ivory back cover of the Lorsch Gospels, c. 810, Carolingian.jpgIvory cover of the Lorsch Gospels, c. 810 File:Ivory book cover MS Douce 176.jpgThe \\"Oxford book cover\\" of Bodleian MS Douce 176 File:Ruthwell Cross, North Face, Figure of Christ II.jpgThe Ruthwell Cross File:Bewcastle Cross, West Face, John the Baptist, Figure of Christ, and Runes.jpgBewcastle Cross, West Face, John the Baptist, Christ treading on the beasts, and runes Christ recognised by the animals? Anglo-Saxon head of tau cross, 11th century An alternative view of the iconography of the Ruthwell and Bewcastle Crosses sees the panels with Christ as showing a different depiction, even rarer than Christ treading on the beasts, which has been called \\"Christ as Judge recognised by the beasts in the desert\\".The name used by Herren, 236 This hitherto unrecognised subject was first proposed by Fritz Saxl, followed by Meyer Schapiro.Saxl's article is in \\"Further reading\\", Schapiro's article The Religious Meaning of the Ruthwell Cross, originally The Art Bulletin, December 1944, is reprinted in his work cited, as is his later article on the cross. The crucial difference is that in this interpretation the animals do not represent the devil, but actual wildlife encountered by Jesus, specifically in his forty days in the \\"wilderness\\" or desert in between his Baptism and Temptation. Schapiro assembled a good deal of textual material showing tropes of wild beasts submitting to Christ and other Christian figures, especially in the context of the early monasticism of the desert, where the attitude of the challenging local fauna was a live issue. The legend of Saint Jerome and the lion is an enduring example, and later Saint Francis of Assisi renewed the theme. This interpretation has met with considerable acceptance, though the matter cannot be regarded as settled.Herren and Ó Carragaáin accept it; Hilmo sticks to the traditional interpretation. A small number of other examples of the new subject have been advanced, most from before about 1200, though the clearest is in a 14th-century Catalan full-page miniature (BnF, Ms. Lat. 8846) which shows a Temptation of Christ followed by a scene which seems unmistakably to show lions, bears and deer sitting peacefully in pairs as they are blessed by Christ. The inscription round the image on the Ruthwell Cross, for which no direct source is known, reads: \\"IHS XPS iudex aequitatis; bestiae et dracones cognoverunt in deserto salvatorem mundi\\" - \\"Jesus Christ: the judge of righteousness: the beasts and dragons recognised in the desert the saviour of the world\\".Schapiro, 154-160; the Catalan scene is fig. 8 The new interpretation would only apply to the two Anglo-Saxon crosses among the examples mentioned here; works such as the Ravenna mosaic and the Carolingian book-covers are not claimed to show it. Other Anglo-Saxon pieces might represent it, for example, according to Leslie Webster a brooch in Ludlow Museum from the 2nd quarter of the 7th century with two beast heads at the foot of a cross \\"must also represent Creation's adoration of the risen Christ\\"Webster, figure 12, discussed pp. 31-32; see also figure 197, p. 226, a late 11th-century sculpture of Risen Christ with Urnes style decoration, in the church at Jevington, Sussex Schapiro saw the \\"peaceful\\" image as the original version, its composition later turned into the \\"militant\\" version, probably after the Constantinian conversion, but surviving in a small trickle of examples, especially those produced in contexts of monastic asceticism,Schapiro, 158 showing \\"Christ as the ideal monk\\".The title of the section of Herren dealing with the crosses, from p. 236 Variants and related depictions Illustration of David as Victor from the Durham Cassiodorus. Vinica icon of saints Christopher and George By the 8th century, the motif of \\"treading\\" on devilish beasts was transferred to saints. One of the terracotta icons found near Vinica, North Macedonia shows a cynocephalous Saint Christopher and the military saint George as treading on two snakes with human heads, both saints aiming lances at the heads of the snakes. This is the earliest known form of the dragon-slaying motif which by the 10th or 11th century was strongly associated with the military saints Theodore and George. A well-known figure of David in the Durham Cassiodorus (8th century) is shown holding a spear and standing on a snake with a head at each end, a composite figure of the beasts. The book which the miniature illustrates is Cassiodorus's Commentary on the Psalms, which explains that Psalm 90:13 refers to Christ, and elsewhere that David, who is portrayed in the only two surviving miniatures, is a type of Christ. In later Anglo-Saxon manuscripts, such as the Tiberius C. VI Psalter (British Library), the figure standing on a similar beast is Christ.Hilmo, 37-38 A variant depiction may also relate to a different text, Psalm 74:13:- \\"Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters\\" (KJV). This was related by commentators to baptism, and on the wooden doors of Sankt Maria im Kapitol in Cologne (1049), may be referred to in the scene of the Baptism of Christ, where Christ stands on some sort of sea-monster.Schiller, I, 136 & fig. 380, who actually doubts Psalm 74 is referred to. Another possibility, following the commentary of Eusebius, is that the Baptism provoked the devilish beasts to attack Christ, an episode often considered to relate to the Temptation of Christ, which immediately follows the Baptism in the Synoptic Gospels.Hilmo, 40-42 In a Romanesque tympanum of the Adoration of the Magi, at Neuilly-en-Donjon of c. 1130, Christ does not appear, but the Three Magi pick their way to the Virgin and Child along the back of a bull-like dragon, while the Virgin's throne sits on a lion; both animals are lying in profile, facing out of the scenes, and one of Mary's feet rests on the hind-quarters of each beast. Following the imagery of chapter 12 of the Book of Revelation, Bernard of Clairvaux had called Mary the \\"conqueror of dragons\\", and she was long to be shown crushing a snake underfoot, also a reference to her title as the \\"New Eve\\" Schiller, I,108 & fig. 280 NotesReferences=General subject *Chazelle, Celia Martin.

The Tektek Mountains are known for the proliferation of large stone markers and cairns at summit of every height. There are also at least two ancient sites located there: Karahan Tepe and Sumatar Harabesi. Physical geography The Tektek Mountains are located on the northern border of the Urfa-Harran plain, between the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.Newspaper Enterprise Association, 1903, p. 277. Reaching an altitude of , this spur extends southward from the Tur Abdin mountain range about away. The Şebeke Mountains to the west form a chain together with the Tektek and Susuz Mountains. The Viranşehir plain, which covers an area of , lies between the Tektek and Karacadağ Mountains. The mountain range is composed of Eocene and Miocene limestone, its valleys formed in the humid climatic conditions characteristic of the interglacial and post-glacial periods. There is no basalt present. The Tektek Mountains are devoid of woodland, with the exception of an area at the northwest end of the range where pistachio (pistacia khinjuk) trees grow. Inhabitants Villages in the Tektek Mountains are inhabited by semi-nomadic pastoralists and agriculturalists of uncertain origin whose housing is constructed low to the ground, and sometimes within it, using the mud upon which they are situated. Crops can be grown in the spring, but the summer heat drives away most of inhabitants, many of whom graze their livestock elsewhere at that time of the year. Nomadic families from the Karacadağ Mountain come to the Tektek Mountains for the autumn and winter seasons to graze their animals and hunt wild game. Near a hill known as Keçili Tepe, there is a small village of the same name. Ancient sites The two ancient sites located in the Tektek Mountains are Karahan Tepe, some east of Urfa, and Sumatar Harabesi, some from the same. Sumatar Harabesi is an oasis that served as an ancient watering hole for semi-nomadic peoples, as well as a sacred site with baetyls and altars dedicated to the worship of the deity, Sin. Karahan Tepe is a site that was discovered in 1997 and was dated to c. 9500–9000 BC by Bahattin Çelik, a Turkish archaeologist. Covering an area of , it consists of a number of stone T-pillars and high reliefs depicting, among other images, a winding snake and the battered torso of a naked man. There are also polished rock statues of goats, gazelles and rabbits. Specialty products The butter used in Baklavacı Güllüoğlu, baklava made by a company founded by the Güllü brothers in 1871, is made from milk taken from sheep and goats in the Tektek Mountains. The butter is on average five times more expensive than the margarine used by other baklava producers, costing some US$15 per kilo.

Halstead secured some publicity in 2005 when, at the age of 18, he announced that he would launch his own aviation business. Halstead's 2005 business was called AlphaOne Airways. It had a number of false starts. Halstead announced services from Oxford in March 2005 and later the same year from Southampton Airport. AlphaOne Airways never flew a single flight from either airport. In December 2005 and January 2006, a limited flight programme took place between Isle of Man and Edinburgh. The business folded after having carried only 46 passengers. Halstead's personality-based PR had underpinned AlphaOne Airways, but the venture was underfunded. Because AlphaOne did not have the necessary certification to operate flights itself, Halstead arranged for a licensed carrier to fly on his behalf. He followed the same strategy with Varsity Express, but claimed he had a sounder funding base. With the 2010 venture, Martin Halstead stated that Varsity Express had sufficient funds to operate for 18 months without carrying a single passenger. Ten days prior to Varsity's first flight, Halstead also claimed to the media that his nascent airline already employed about 20 people. However, it later emerged that the business had almost no capital. The business was funded by £3,500 of Mr Halstead's own money, and £52,500 that he took from four newly qualified pilots, in respect of specialised 'type training' that they never received. The airline started operations on 1 March 2010 with flight LNQ601 (operated on behalf of Varsity by Linksair) leaving Oxford Airport shortly after 0800 local time, touching down in Edinburgh at 9.42 am. Varsity allowed 90 minutes for the sector, evidently insufficient, as none of the first four Oxford to Edinburgh flights landed before 9.30 am. Demise and Aftermath On the afternoon of 8 March 2010, Varsity Express suspended operations after Links Air, the company which owned the plane leased by Varsity, refused to continue supporting the airline. Thirteen passengers were left stranded because the second leg of their return tickets was not honoured. In media interviews, a Links Air representative cited non-payment of bills by Martin Halstead as the reason for withdrawing from the venture. A number of allegations of dishonesty surrounding the business were reported in The Times newspaper on 14 March 2010. The article reported allegations including that Martin Halstead used a fictitious name to act as commercial director and financial backer of the airline, launched the airline with a business partner who was disqualified from acting as a company director, boasted of fictitious investors, and obtained finance for the business by inducing four newly qualified pilots to pay a total of £52,500 into his personal bank account for training that was never provided. The police are reported to have received complaints against the company and to be investigating these. Mr Halstead admits using a false name to hide his involvement in the company, in an attempt to avoid the effects of damaged credibility resulting from his previous failed ventures, but denies illegality. Destinations For the one week that it operated, Varsity Express linked the following two airports: *United Kingdom **England ***Oxford - London Oxford Airport **Scotland ***Edinburgh - Edinburgh Airport Operator Status Varsity Express did not have an Air Operator's Certificate, so the company's flights were operated by Humberside Airport based Linksair Ltd using a single Jetstream 31 aircraft. Varsity Express (like AlphaOne Airways before it) was thus an extreme example of what transport economists often term a virtual airline. It even outsourced its core flying operations. Because it neither possessed, nor had it applied for, an Air Operator's Certification from the Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom), Varsity Express was never subject to the regulatory scrutiny (with respect to financial backing and the sustainability of the proposed operation) that would have applied to a start- up carrier seeking to secure its own Air Operator's Certificate.

It is registered by Fresenius Medical Care under the trade names Renepho (Belgium) and OsvaRen (a number of other European countries). Clinical use Phosphorus is contained in food with high protein content as well as in processed food. It is absorbed by the small intestine.http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/phosphorus/ Healthy kidneys remove excess phosphorus from the body. One of the consequences of renal failure is inadequate removal of phosphorus resulting in increased serum phosphorus levels. This may worsen the overproduction of parathyroid hormone (hyperparathyroidism), and may lead to renal osteodystrophy, calcification of blood vessels and is associated with cardiovascular mortality (the so-called chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder, CKD-MBD).National Kidney Foundation, Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis, Evaluation, Prevention, and Treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD). Kidney International, Aug. 2009; 42: pp. 1–130. In addition to dialysis therapy and dietary restrictions, a pharmaceutical therapy to lower serum phosphorus levels is recommended. Mechanism of action Calcium acetate/magnesium carbonate is taken orally together with the meal. Calcium acetate and magnesium carbonate compounds bind phosphorus derived from food thereby forming indigestible phosphate salts in the intestine that are subsequently excreted with the faeces. The aim of the therapy is to reach a normal serum phosphorus level, i.e. between 0.81–1.45 mmol/l (2.5–4.5 mg/dl). Side effects Side effects from pharmaceutical therapy such as gastrointestinal disorders, e.g. nausea, constipation or diarrhoea may occur, as well as metabolism and nutritional disorders, e.g. hypercalcaemia or hypermagnesaemia.

Made out of local clays, the pipes had a distinctive orange or brown color, with many being decorated with abstract designs and motifs.Emerson 1999. p. 47. Such pipes are so common that they have been described as being \\"ubiquitous in [the] archaeological sites of Virginia and Maryland\\".Mouer et al 1999. p. 95. Historical archaeologists debate as to which community was responsible for the production of the Chesapeake pipes, with figures like Matthew EmersonEmerson 1999. and Leland FergusonFerguson 1992. purporting that they were manufactured primarily by African American slaves, whilst others, like L. Mouer,Mouer et al 1999. instead argue that the primary producers were Native Americans. Whilst debate continues as to which of these two ethnic groups were the primary producer, it has also been noted that there are examples where Chesapeake pipes were most likely produced by European settlers in the area.Mouer et al 1999. p. 97. Due to the confusion as to which ethnic group was responsible for their manufacture, similarities with a type of North American ceramic earthenware known as colonoware have been made.Ferguson 1992. p. 50. Background In the Chesapeake Bay region during the 17th century, three different ethnic communities coexisted: the English settlers, who were politically, militarily and economically dominant, the African Americans, who were primarily slaves in the service of wealthy English plantation owners, and the Native American groups, who were being increasingly marginalised. Amongst all three of these groups, the smoking of tobacco was common, and all three groups had histories of using clay pipes to smoke the drug. Within 17th-century Chesapeake Bay, there was a significant amount of cooperation and interaction between the members of these different communities, for instance the last pocket of resistance during Bacon's Rebellion of 1676 was recorded as consisting of \\"eighty Negroes and twenty English\\" who were cooperating to oppose the Virginia governorship. It would only be in the 18th century that the concept of firmly dividing society up into ethnic groups became acceptable in the region, when laws preventing inter-ethnic marriage were introduced.Epperson 1999. p. 160. The Native American tribes of the Chesapeake region, who were Algonquian speakers, had made use of a type of \\"relatively small, clay, conical-bowled, obtuse- or right-angled elbow pipe\\" prior to European and African colonization of the area.Mouer et al 1999. p. 101. The first African slaves had been brought to the Chesapeake in the early 17th century, being recorded in Virginia in 1619 and in Maryland in 1634.Emerson 1999. p. 51. The majority of those brought to this area probably came from the coastal and inland states of Western Africa,Curtin 1969. p. 122. but some likely originated from Central Africa, the Congo and Madagascar as well.Curtin 1969. p. 125. Western Africans had been smoking tobacco since it was introduced to the area by European traders in the early 16th century, although it remains unknown how prevalent it had become by the seventeenth.Emerson 1999. p. 52. Some native African pipe-making manufacturers had been set up, for archaeologists have unearthed locally made clay pipes dating from 17th century Ghana and Mali.Emerson 1999. pp. 52-53. Archaeologist Matthew C. Emerson argued that some of those slaves purchased in West Africa and transported to North America brought their own pipe-making techniques with them, highlighting the similarities between certain pipe forms found on the two continents. As evidence, he noted that there were 17th-century pipes found in Mali and other parts of the middle Niger River valley that were \\"nearly identical\\" to the Chesapeake pipes found in North America.Emerson 1999. pp. 52-53. Amongst the English settlers, it is known that there were pipe-makers, with documentary evidence noting of at least two professionals in this field having migrated from Europe to the Chesapeake in the 17th century.Emerson 1999. p. 50. Description Chesapeake pipes were often decorated, with such decorations either encircling the lip of the pipe bowl, covering the middle of the pipe bowl, or extending down the pipe stem. These decorations were produced by incising, stamping or punching into the clay prior to firing it, after which the clay hardened. Various types of decorations were employed in the creation of Chesapeake pipes, including \\"a range of geometric, figural, and zoomorphic motifs as well as abstract geometric designs.\\"Emerson 1999. p. 53. One of the most common ways that Chesapeake pipes were decorated was through the pointillé effect, in which lines of indented dots would be pushed into the clay. This was produced in two ways, the first of which was rouletting, or using a rolling, toothed wheel to produce the desired effect. The other was by using a single, stationary hand-held tool to indent each of the dots into the clay one by one.Emerson 1999. p. 53. Stewart suggested that such punctuations may have been made using shark's teeth.Stewart 1954. p. 04. Another, albeit far rarer, form of decoration employed on certain Chesapeake pipes was cord wrapping, in which a piece of cord or string was wrapped tightly around the clay to leave a patterned indentation.Emerson 1999. p. 54. Motifs or symbols were in many cases stamped or incised into the clay pipe, depicting such things as stars, ships, boats, tobacco plants, hearts, humans, animals and geometric shapes. In some cases, white clay had been used to fill in these shapes, making them stand out far more against the red clay that made up the rest of the pipe. Such traces of white clay are very rare on surviving Chesapeake pipes, as it often washes out when buried in the ground.Emerson 1999. p. 54. An experimental archaeological project undertaken by L.B. Gregory to replicate Chesapeake pipes using Virginia clays showed that such items could be manufactured using a simple homemade mold and low-temperature firing, and that therefore \\"the technology to produce pipe molds was well within the grasp of Native Americans, African Americans, and European Americans in the 17th century.\\"Mouer et al 1999. pp. 97-98. Origins Amongst archaeologists, there has been much argument and counter-argument as to whether Native Americans or African Americans were the primary producers of Chesapeake pipes. Proponents of both sides have tried to trace stylistic antecedents in both Native American and West African pipe making, although as Matthew C. Emerson noted, \\"Examining decorative effects and techniques and identifying them with ethnic groups is a weak approach to identifying people with their art.\\"Emerson 1999. p. 56. The first archaeologist to note the problem of associating specific ethnic groups with Chesapeake pipes was J. C. \\"Pinky\\" Harrington who, in a 1951 article, stated that \\"one of the most intriguing problems [of Jamestown archaeology] is that of the hand-molded pipes… Many are obviously of Indian [i.e. Native American] manufacture, but some have been made by the [European] settlers following Indian styles and techniques.\\"Harrington 1951. p. n.p. Problems arise because no definite manufacturing site for Chesapeake pipes has ever been unearthed in the archaeological record. Emerson noted the many issues that prevent archaeologists finding such evidence, arguing that any metal molds that had been used in their production would have been melted down and recast for use elsewhere, rather than being abandoned and left in the archaeological record. He also argued that the clay used in making the pipes was so abundant around the Chesapeake region that it was problematic to identify specific sites where the pipe-makers had gathered their clay.Emerson 1999. pp. 49-50. Native American argument A number of archaeologists have argued that the Chesapeake pipes were products of members of local Algonquian-speaking Native American tribes such as the Pamunkey. L. Mouer et al noted that there were historical records written by Europeans that described how Natives created their own tobacco pipes, for example the exiled French Huguenot Durand Du Dauphiné, writing in 1686, remarked that Native women living on the Rappahannock River made \\"pots, earthen vases and smoking pipes\\", whilst John Clayton recorded that Natives living in Virginia \\"smoak [sic] in short pipes of their own making having excellent clay\\".Mouer et al 1999. pp. 91-92. African American argument The archaeologist Matthew C. Emerson argued that a study of the decoration on Chesapeake pipes revealed that their producers were of African origin because of similarities that he saw between them and 17th-century West African pipes.

In the 18th century an impressive Italian garden was added with stairs, fountains, water features and an aedicula decorated with frescoes. Around the villa there are interesting rustic elements, such as a representation of an olive press containing a cycle of rococo frescoes from the workshop of Pietro Antonio Magatti, a painter from Varese. At the end of the 17th century the villa experienced one of its most important transformations on the initiative of Gian Angelo Della Porta III on the occasion of his marriage to Isabella, daughter of Count Giorgio Giulini. With the assistance of architect Antonio Maria Porani, he set the main axis of the garden parallel to the side of the house—thus contravening the classic rules under which the principal axis must be aligned with the main room of the house, dividing the garden into two symmetrical parts.

According to his account Hayatullah was a pharmacist, with no association with or knowledge of the Taliban's activities, who was apprehended because he had the same name as a Taliban leader, Hajji Hayatullah. Hayatullah described being held for forty days in \\"the black prison\\", which he believed was near the main prison at Bagram.

He said that, unlike Bagram, each captive was kept in a cell of his own. He described how the lack of natural light meant that the captives didn't know when it was day or night, and so they didn't know when to say their prayers. He said that the International Committee of the Red Cross was not allowed to visit the black prison. Hayatullah also called the black prison\\" \\"Tor Jail\\". Hayatullah told The New York Times that both he and his partner were apprehended, in their shop, shortly after noon. He said they were hooded and bound. He said in addition to being accused of being Haji Hayatullah, the Taliban leader, he was also accused of once allowing members of the Taliban to enter his house, and that he served them a meal. According to Hayatullah, by the time he was sent to Bagram, the captives were still kept in communal cells, with up to twenty captives in each. He said that in Bagram the captives were allowed to talk with one another, and he learned all their stories. He described suicide attempts by other captives. Hayatullah said that representatives of the Red Cross were allowed to visit the captives in Bagram, every 40 days, and that, through them, he was able to get mail to his family, finally telling them where he was. He said that not only had the detention been damaging to his own health, it had a profound effect on his parents' health.

Browning, expanded their financial interests to 17 banks and a building and loan company, later brought under one holding company, First Security Corporation, in June 1928. In 1932, First Security acquired Deseret National Bank, which had been founded in 1871 by Brigham Young. It then moved its headquarters from Ogden to Salt Lake City. In 2000, First Security was absorbed into Wells Fargo. First Security stockholders received 0.355 of a share of Wells Fargo common stock in exchange for each share of First Security common stock.

Close coupled field technology (CCFT) is an air sterilization process that kills 99.999% of microbes, bacteria (including bacterial endospores), viruses, germs, mold spores, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), fungal air contaminants and chemical agents and their associated odors.Pelekani, Liggie. “Equipment News - Airmanager: the new revolutionary air cleaning system”, synfo.com, January 15, 2010. CCFT utilizes small high-voltage coils within a Faraday cage to generate a non-thermal plasma field to destabilize inorganic and organic compounds at the molecular level.Wagner, Siobhan. “AirManager cleans cabin air”, The Engineer, September 21, 2009. As air is passed through this electrostatic field it is converted to ozone which oxidizes airborne contaminants.“New Weapons In The Fight Against Superbugs”, Medical News Today, May 2, 2007 Enclosing the ozone retains its ability to remove contaminants quickly while making it safe for populated environments.Edited by the Laboratorytalk editorial team. “Kill 99.7% of airborne bacteria and viruses”, August 12, 2005. History CCFT was originally invented by David Hallam to remove unpleasant odors from a nursing home where an ailing uncle was a resident.Edited by the Laboratorytalk editorial team. “Kill 99.7% of airborne bacteria and viruses”, August 12, 2005. When the nursing staff noticed a dramatic decrease in the spread of infections, this led Hallam to further investigate CCFT. Hallam went on to develop the AirManager system, which uses a combination of CCFT and high airflow filtration (HAF), which filters any dust, pollen, airborne contaminants and resultant debris from the CCFT process down to 0.1 micrometres.Pelekani, Liggie. “Equipment News - Airmanager: the new revolutionary air cleaning system”, synfo.com, January 15, 2010. CCFT technology is a variation of a class of technologies called non-thermal plasma, which are based on the discharge of high voltage static electricity. Using a variety of configurations, two electrodes are separated by various dielectric insulating materials. A voltage is increasingly applied to one electrode until it exceeds the dielectric capacity of the insulators, whereupon electric discharge occurs. When the electricity is discharged in the presence of air, high energy electrons are formed which react with the chemicals and pathogens in air through a complex series of free radical reactions. As molecular oxygen is always present in air, ozone is always formed as well. The use of small high voltage coils distinguishes this method from other approaches that use different configurations of dual electrodes, such as a wire insulated by glass beads passing through the center of a metal pipe, which serves as the second electrode.

He was a member of the notable Melbourne retailing Myer family. Myer made significant philanthropic and personal contributions to the development of major national institutions, most notably the Howard Florey Laboratories of Experimental Physiology and Medicine, the School of Oriental Studies at the University of Melbourne, the Victorian Arts Centre and the National Library of Australia.Denton, Derek. Kenneth Baillieu Myer 1921–1992 at Australian Academy of Science, 2016 He was also the founding chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.National Library of Australia: Kenneth Baillieu Myer, An Appreciation Early life and Second World War Ken Myer was born in San Francisco, California, United States in 1921, the eldest son of Sidney Myer, who migrated to Australia from Russia in 1899, then moved to the United States to make his fortune. Sidney Myer had divorced his first wife in Reno, Nevada, but this divorce was not recognised under Australian law. His second wife, (later Dame) Merlyn Myer, travelled to San Francisco for the birth of each of her four children to ensure they would be considered legitimate. The family returned to Australia in 1929 and Myer was educated at Geelong Grammar School, where his strengths were in music, the arts, the classics and languages. His father died at an early age in 1934, when Ken was 13 years of age. He was accepted to the University of Oxford but could not attend due to the outbreak of the Second World War. He attended Princeton University for a year, then returned to Australia and served in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Myer was temporarily seconded to the Royal Navy in mid-1943, and rose to the rank of lieutenant. On 15 August 1944, he was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross for his role in an attack by on the Japanese submarine Ro-33 that had torpedoed a merchant ship, Malaita, outside Port Moresby.It's an Honour: DSC (Imperial) He was also mentioned in despatches in 1944. Later he served in the occupation forces in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo. Career In 1948 Myer became a Director of the Myer Emporium, a role he continued until 1985. He was Deputy chairman and managing director 1960–1966, Chairman 1966–1976, and a non-executive Director 1976–1985. He was also a Director of Coles Myer Ltd 1985–89. Together with his siblings, Myer brought the Sidney Myer Music Bowl into existence in 1959. Ken Myer donated it to the people of Victoria and Australia, and it was accepted on their behalf by the then Prime Minister, Robert Menzies. Myer championed the introduction of freeways and shopping malls to Australia, and was instrumental in setting up the Chadstone Shopping Centre in Melbourne. In 1972, Myer surprised and to a degree alienated his family by publicly supporting the Australian Labor Party led by Gough Whitlam during the federal election campaign. Labor won government in December 1972 and Whitlam became Prime Minister. In early 1974, Whitlam offered Ken Myer the opportunity of succeeding Sir Paul Hasluck as Governor-General. He declined, and the post went to Sir John Kerr.Barry Jones, A Thinking Reed, p. 200 Myer's other activities were extensive and varied. He was: * Honorary Secretary of the National Gallery Society of Victoria 1948–53 * President of the Town and Country Planning Association of Victoria 1953–1958 * a member of the Victorian Arts Centre Building Committee 1958–80, and chairman 1965–80 * a member of the Interim Council of the National Library of Australia 1960 (at the personal invitation of the then Australian Prime Minister, Robert Menzies) * a founding member of the statutory Council 1961 * Chairman of the Council 1974–82 * a member of the Australian Universities Commission 1962–65 * a member of the Committee of Economic Inquiry (the first Vernon Committee) 1963–65 * Chairman of the Victorian Arts Centre 1965–89 * a member of the founding Council of the Australian Institute of Urban Studies in 1967 * a member of the interim Council of the Australian National Gallery 1968–71 * a director of the National Retail Merchants Association of the USA 1969–79 * a member of the Australian National Capital Planning Committee 1971–82 * President of the Board of the Howard Florey Institute of Experimental Physiology and Medicine 1971–92 * a member of Australia's first trade mission to China in 1973 * a member of the Committee, chaired by Sir John Crawford, whose unanimous report led to the Australia-Japan Foundation * Chairman of the Victorian Arts Centre Trust from 1980 to 1989 * founding Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation 1983–86. This last was one of his few unsuccessful appointments, and it ended in his sudden resignation mid-term; it was widely seen as a reward by Bob Hawke for Myer's support for Gough Whitlam's election in 1972. Myer successfully fostered new research in organisations such as the Division of Plant Industry of the CSIRO and helped build the Oriental Collection of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. At his death in 1992, he was the greatest collector of Japanese art in Australia.Art Gallery of New South Wales Honours and awards Myer won the International Retailers Award in 1970. On Australia Day 1976 he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC).It’s an Honour: AC In 1989 the Australian Libraries and Information Association gave Myer its Redmond Barry Award, which goes to a lay person not employed in a library who has rendered outstanding service to the promotion of a library and to the promotion of a library and the practice of librarianship. In April 1992 Myer was elected to the Fellowship of the Australian Academy of Science, under the provision for special election of people who are not scientists but have rendered conspicuous service to the cause of science.

In 1955 she founded and directed the Cambridge Language Research Unit (CLRU), which grew from an informal discussion group to a major research centre in computational linguistics in its time. She was a student at Newnham College, Cambridge and read modern languages and then Moral Sciences (as philosophy was then called). The Cambridge Language Research Unit was founded in a small but beautiful building called Adie's Museum which had housed far eastern art: small Buddhist sculptures were built into its walls and carved doors. For a period of twenty years starting in 1953 it was a source of significant research in machine translation, computational linguistics, and quantum physics even though outside the official university structures in Cambridge. It was funded by grants from US agencies (AFOSR, ONR, NSF), UK Government agencies (OSTI) and later, from EU funds in Luxembourg. Its computing facilities were primitive—an ancient ICL 1202 computer---and most of its more serious computation was done either on the Cambridge university machine, in the then Mathematical Laboratory—or by CLRU visitors at sites in the US. One measure of its impact, and from a staff that never exceeded ten people, was that of the Annual Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Association for Computational Linguistics in the US, three have been awarded to CLRU alumni: Martin Kay, Karen Spärck Jones and Yorick Wilks. Margaret Masterman was ahead of her time by some twenty years: many of her beliefs and proposals for language processing by computer have now become part of the common stock of ideas in the artificial intelligence (AI) and machine translation (MT) fields. She was never able to lay adequate claim to them because they were unacceptable when she published them, and so when they were written up later by her students or independently “discovered” by others, there was no trace back to her, especially in these fields where little or nothing over ten years old is ever reread. The core of her beliefs about language processing was that it must reflect the coherence of language, its redundancy as a signal. This idea was a partial inheritance from the old “information theoretic” view of language: for her, it meant that processes analysing language must take into account its repetitive and redundant structures and that a writer goes on saying the same thing again and again in different ways; only if the writer does that can the ambiguities be removed from the signal. This sometimes led her to overemphasise the real and explicit redundancy she would find in rhythmical and repetitive verse and claim, implausibly, that normal English was just like that if only we could see it right. This led in later years to the key role she assigned to rhythm, stress, breathgroupings and the boundaries they impose on text and the processes of understanding. To put it crudely, her claim was that languages are the way they are, at least in part, because they are produced by creatures that breathe at fairly regular intervals. It will be obvious why such claims could not even be entertained while Chomsky's views were preeminent in language studies. However she could never give systematic surface criteria by which the breathgroups and stress patterns were to be identified by surface cues, or could be reduced to other criteria such as syntax or morphology, nor would she become involved in the actual physics of voice patterns. Her views on the importance of semantics in language processing (which, she continued to defend in the high years of Chomskyan syntax between 1951 and 1966) were much influenced by R. H. Richens' views on classification and description by means of a language of semantic primitives with its own syntax. These, along with associated claims about semantic pattern matching onto surface text, were developed in actual programs, from which it might be assumed that she was a straightforward believer in the existence of semantic primitives in some Katzian or Schankian sense. Nothing could be further from the truth: for she was far too much a Wittgensteinian sceptic about the ability of any limited sublanguage or logic to take on the role of the whole language. She always argued that semantic primitives would only make sense if there were empirical criteria for their discovery and a theory that allowed for the fact that they, too, would develop exactly the polysemy of any higher or natural language; and she always emphasised the functional role of primitives in, for example, resolving sense ambiguity and as an interlingua for MT. She hoped that the escape from the problem of the origin of semantic primitives would lie in either empirical classification procedures operating on actual texts (in the way some now speak of deriving primitives by massive connectionist learning), or by having an adequate formal theory of the structure of thesauri, which she believed to make explicit certain underlying structures of the semantic relations in a natural language: a theory such that “primitives” would emerge naturally as the organizing classification of thesauri. For some years, she and colleagues explored lattice theory as the underlying formal structure of such thesauri. Two other concerns that went through her intellectual life owe much to the period when Michael Halliday, as the University Lecturer in Chinese at Cambridge, was a colleague at C.L.R.U. She got from him the idea that syntactic theory was fundamentally semantic or pragmatic, in either its categories and their fundamental definition, or in terms of the role of syntax as an organizing principle for semantic information. She was the first AI researcher to be influenced by Halliday, long before Terry Winograd. Again, she became preoccupied for a considerable period with the nature and function of Chinese ideograms, because she felt they clarified in an empirical way problems that Wittgenstein had wrestled with in his so-called picture-theory- of-truth. This led her to exaggerate the generality of ideogrammatic principles and to seem to hold that English was really rather like Chinese if only seen correctly, with its meaning atoms, highly ambiguous and virtually uninflected. It was a view that found little or no sympathy in the dominant linguistic or computational currents of the time. Her main creation in 1953, one which endured for twenty years, was the Cambridge Language Research Unit, which grew out of an informal discussion group with a very heterogeneous membership interested in language from philosophical and computational points of view. Subsequently, the attempt to build language processing programs which had a sound philosophical basis was a distinctive feature of the Unit's work. This approach to language processing, and the specific form it took in the use of a thesaurus as the main vehicle for semantic operations, will probably come to be seen as the Unit's major contributions to the field as a whole, and it was Margaret who was primarily responsible for them. Her vision of language processing and its possibilities was remarkable at a time when computers were very rudimentary: indeed much of the C.L.R.U.'s work had to be done on the predecessors of computers, namely Hollerith punched card machines. Equally, Margaret's determination in establishing and maintaining the Unit, with the enormous effort in fund raising that this involved, was very striking: the fact that it could continue for decades, and through periods when public support for such work was hard to come by, is a tribute to Margaret's persistence and charm. It is difficult for us now, in these days of artificial intelligence in the ordinary market place, and very powerful personal computers, to realise how hard it was to get the financial resources needed for language-processing research, and the technical resources to do actual experiments. Perhaps the best comment on Margaret's initiative in embarking on language processing research, and specifically on machine translation work, comes from a somewhat unexpected source. Machine translation, after an initial period of high hopes, and some large claims, was cast into outer darkness in 1966 by funding agencies who saw little return for their money. Reviewing twenty five years of artificial intelligence research in his presidential address to the American Association for Artificial Intelligence in 1985, Woody Bledsoe, one of the long-standing leaders of the field, though in areas quite outside language, said of those who attempted machine translation in the fifties and sixties: \\"They may have failed, but they were right to try; we have learned so much from their attempts to do something so difficult\\". What she and C.L.R.U. were trying to do was far ahead of its time. Efforts were made to tackle fundamental problems with the computers of the day that had the capacity of a modern digital wrist watch. Despite every kind of problem, the Unit produced numerous publications on language and related subjects, including information retrieval and automatic classification. For over ten years the Unit's presence was strongly felt in the field, always with an emphasis on basic semantic problems of language understanding. Margaret had no time for those who felt that all that needed doing was syntactic parsing, or that complete parsing was necessary before you did anything else. Now that the semantics of language are regarded as a basic part of its understanding by machine, the ideas of C.L.R.U. seem curiously modern. Margaret's main contribution to the life of CLRU was in the continual intellectual stimulus she gave to its research, and through this to the larger natural language processing community: she had wide ranging concerns, and lateral ideas, which led her, for example, to propose the thesaurus as a means of carrying out many distinct language processing tasks, like indexing and translation. Margaret's emphasis on algorithms, and on testing them, was vital for the development of CLRU's work on language processing; but her ideas were notable, especially for those who worked with her, not just for their Intellectual qualities, but for their sheer joyousness. Serious research stopped at CLRU about 1978 and Margaret tried to restart the CLRU in 1980 with William Williams in the hope that the new breed of micro-computers could be used to develop her algorithms for natural language translation. Margaret walked the 7 miles from Millington Road in Cambridge to Orwell and purchased two North Star Horizon computers from Intelligent Artefacts (see ST Robotics). These were installed with the Forth programming language, written by David Sands and used by various students from the University of Cambridge who programmed Margaret's algorithms into the computers. Margaret's approach to natural language translation at this time was to split a sentence into \\"breath group\\" segments. Since each breath group had a unique meaning it could be translated into the target language and the target sentence reconstructed using the translated breath groups. This contrasted with the predominant language translation techniques of the time, notably Systran which used a dictionary and rule based system still used today. When Margaret died in 1986 William Williams closed down CLRU and its unique library of early MT documents were dumped into a skip, even though two university bodies had offered to give it a home. She was one of cofounders of Lucy Cavendish College and its first Vice-President (1965–1975). She was a great-niece of Lucy Cavendish after whom the college is named. She also was a founder and the major inspiration of the Epiphany Philosophers, a group which shared some membership with the CLRU and was dedicated to the study of the relationship of science and religion and the forms of religious practice. In 1965, Margaret Masterman read the work: \\"The Nature of a Paradigm\\" at the Fourth International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science, in London. She conducted a detailed textual criticism of Thomas S. Kuhn's book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), characterizing the book as \\"at once scientifically perspicuous and philosophically obscure.\\" Masterman praised Kuhn as \\"one of the outstanding philosophers of science of our time\\" and his concept of paradigms as \\"a fundamental idea and a new one in the philosophy of science.\\" She criticised Thomas Kuhn for his vague and inconsistent use of the concept \\"Paradigm,\\" noting that it is used in at least 21 different senses, which can be summarized in three groups: metaparadigms, sociological paradigms, and artefact or construct paradigms. Masterman proposed that Kuhn's critics in the philosophy of science dealt only with metaparadigms and explored the insights and implications of the various conceptions. This criticism was accepted by Thomas Kuhn and was crucial in the shift of the concept \\"Paradigm\\" to \\"Incommensurability\\".

The test uses a partial factorization of N - 1 to prove that an integer N is prime. It produces a primality certificate to be found with less effort than the Lucas primality test, which requires the full factorization of N - 1. Pocklington criterion The basic version of the test relies on the Pocklington theorem (or Pocklington criterion) which is formulated as follows: Let N > 1 be an integer, and suppose there exist numbers and such that Then is prime. Note: Equation () is simply a Fermat primality test. If we find any value of , not divisible by , such that equation () is false, we may immediately conclude that is not prime. (This divisibility condition is not explicitly stated because it is implied by equation ().) For example, let N = 35. With a = 2, we find that a^{N-1} \\\\equiv 9 \\\\pmod{N}. This is enough to prove that is not prime. Proof of this theorem Suppose is not prime. This means there must be a prime , where q \\\\le \\\\sqrt{N} that divides . Since p > \\\\sqrt N - 1 \\\\ge q - 1, p > q - 1, and since is prime, \\\\gcd{(p, q - 1)} = 1. Thus there must exist an integer , a multiplicative inverse of modulo , with the property that and therefore, by Fermat's little theorem This implies : 1 \\\\;\\\\; \\\\equiv a^{N-1}\\\\pmod{q}, by () since q \\\\vert N :: \\\\equiv (a^{N-1})^{u}\\\\equiv a^{u(N-1)} \\\\equiv a^{up((N-1)/p)}\\\\equiv (a^{up})^{(N-1)/p}\\\\pmod{q}, :: \\\\equiv a^{(N-1)/p}\\\\pmod{q}, by () This shows that divides the \\\\gcd() in (), and therefore this \\\\gcd() e 1; a contradiction. Given , if and can be found which satisfy the conditions of the theorem, then is prime. Moreover, the pair (, ) constitute a primality certificate which can be quickly verified to satisfy the conditions of the theorem, confirming as prime. The main difficulty is finding a value of which satisfies (). First, it is usually difficult to find a large prime factor of a large number. Second, for many primes , such a does not exist. For example, N = 17 has no suitable because N - 1 = 2^4, and p = 2 < \\\\sqrt{N}-1, which violates the inequality in (). Given , finding is not nearly as difficult. If is prime, then by Fermat's little theorem, any in the interval 1 \\\\leq a \\\\leq N - 1 will satisfy () (however, the cases a = 1 and a = N - 1 are trivial and will not satisfy ()). This will satisfy () as long as ord() does not divide (N - 1)/p. Thus a randomly chosen in the interval 2 \\\\leq a \\\\leq N - 2 has a good chance of working. If is a generator mod , its order is and so the method is guaranteed to work for this choice. Generalized Pocklington test A generalized version of Pocklington's theorem is more widely applicable because it does not require finding a single large prime factor of also, it allows a different value of to be used for each known prime factor of N-1. Theorem: Factor as , where and are relatively prime, A > \\\\sqrt{N}, the prime factorization of is known, but the factorization of is not necessarily known.

This means that the order of b \\\\pmod{q} is p^e Thus, p^e \\\\vert (q - 1). The same observation holds for each prime power factor p^e of A, which implies A \\\\vert (q - 1). Specifically, this means q > A \\\\ge \\\\sqrt{N}. If were composite, it would necessarily have a prime factor which is less than or equal to \\\\sqrt{N}. It has been shown that there is no such factor, which proves that is prime. The test The Pocklington–Lehmer primality test follows directly from this corollary. To use this corollary, first find enough factors of so the product of those factors exceeds \\\\sqrt{N}. Call this product . Then let be the remaining, unfactored portion of . It does not matter whether is prime. We merely need to verify that no prime that divides also divides , that is, that and are relatively prime. Then, for every prime factor of , find an a_p which fulfills conditions () and () of the corollary. If such a_ps can be found, the Corollary implies that is prime. According to Koblitz, a_p = 2 often works. Example Determine whether : N = 27457 is prime. First, search for small prime factors of N - 1. We quickly find that : N - 1 = 2^6 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot B = 192 \\\\cdot B. We must determine whether A = 192 and B = (N - 1)/A = 143 meet the conditions of the Corollary. A^2 = 36864 > N, so A > \\\\sqrt{N}. Therefore, we have factored enough of N - 1 to apply the Corollary. We must also verify that \\\\gcd{(A, B)} = 1. It does not matter whether is prime (in fact, it is not). Finally, for each prime factor of , use trial and error to find an that satisfies () and (). For p = 2, try a_2 = 2. Raising a_2 to this high power can be done efficiently using binary exponentiation: : a_2^{N - 1} \\\\equiv 2^{27456} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{27457} : \\\\gcd{(a_2^{(N - 1)/2} - 1, N)} = \\\\gcd{(2^{13728} - 1, 27457)} = 27457. So, a_2 = 2 satisfies () but not (). As we are allowed a different for each , try a_2 = 5 instead: : a_2^{N - 1} \\\\equiv 5^{27456} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{27457} : \\\\gcd{(a_2^{(N - 1)/2} - 1, N)} = \\\\gcd{(5^{13728} - 1, 27457)} = 1. So a_2 = 5 satisfies both () and (). For p = 3, the second prime factor of , try a_3 = 2: : a_3^{N - 1} \\\\equiv 2^{27456} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{27457}. : \\\\gcd{(a_3^{(N - 1)/3} - 1, N)} = \\\\gcd{(2^{9152} - 1, 27457)} = 1. a_3 = 2 satisfies both () and (). This completes the proof that N = 27457 is prime. The certificate of primality for N = 27457 would consist of the two (p, a_p) pairs (2, 5) and (3, 2). We have chosen small numbers for this example, but in practice when we start factoring we may get factors that are themselves so large their primality is not obvious. We cannot prove is prime without proving that the factors of are prime as well. In such a case we use the same test recursively on the large factors of , until all of the primes are below a reasonable threshold. In our example, we can say with certainty that 2 and 3 are prime, and thus we have proved our result. The primality certificate is the list of (p, a_p)pairs, which can be quickly checked in the corollary. If our example had included large prime factors, the certificate would be more complicated. It would first consist of our initial round of s which correspond to the 'prime' factors of ; Next, for each factor of where primality was uncertain, we would have more , and so on for factors of these factors until we reach factors of which primality is certain. This can continue for many layers if the initial prime is large, but the important point is that a certificate can be produced, containing at each level the prime to be tested, and the corresponding s, which can easily be verified. Extensions and variants The 1975 paper by Brillhart, Lehmer, and Selfridge gives a proof for what is shown above as the \\"generalized Pocklington theorem\\" as Theorem 4 on page 623. Additional theorems are shown which allow less factoring. This includes their Theorem 3 (a strengthening of an 1878 theorem of Proth): : Let N-1 = mp where is an odd prime such that 2p+1 > \\\\sqrt N. If there exists an for which a^{(N-1)/2} \\\\equiv -1 \\\\pmod{N}, but a^{m/2} ot\\\\equiv -1 \\\\pmod{N}, then is prime. If is large, it is often difficult to factor enough of N - 1 to apply the above corollary. Theorem 5 of the Brillhart, Lehmer, and Selfridge paper allows a primality proof when the factored part has reached only (N/2)^{1/3}. Many additional such theorems are presented that allow one to prove the primality of based on the partial factorization of N - 1 and N + 1.

Aitzema was born in Dokkum to Schelte van Aitzema, a man of noble birth. Mission to Wallenstein In 1630, he was sent by the States-General of the Netherlands to Wallenstein and the Count of Tilly to sign a treaty of mutual neutrality. Even though Wallenstein had been for a long time partial to the idea of friendship with the States, he now declared that he couldn't dismiss the army he had raised. The negotiations with Tilly also were fruitless. Sent to Denmark The same year, Aitzema was sent to Denmark to persuade the King to abolish the new toll he raised in Glückstadt, which weighed especially on the Hamburgers; but this mission also was without success. Sent to Vienna=Goal of neutrality In 1636, he traveled without clear goal but at the behest of his masters to Vienna to persuade the Emperor to keep a strict neutrality, which the States wanted to pledge from their side as well. The Queen of Bohemia also had ordered Aitzema to look after her interests in the Empire. He also had to investigate, at the request of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, whether the Emperor was willing to offer the County of Moers to that prince, and whether he would be granted the right to bequest his properties in the Empire by his final will to both his female as his male heirs. At first, Aitzema seemed to succeed. Neutrality was promised easily. There was also some talk of raising Moers to a principality, which much honoured the prince, even though some people in the United Netherlands felt that he should not have accepted honours from the House of Austria. Plans thwarted But the Spaniards at the Imperial Court succeeded in thwarting those plans. The French Envoy Hercule de Charnacé also wasn't pleased by the Emperor's actions. Some claim that Aitzema's travel had another aim as well besides polling the court of Vienna; whatever may be, during his stay at the Imperial Court, because of the services done by his masters to the Empire, he was made a freiherr of the Empire. This trip and the honours bestowed severely grieved France, even more so because the States had promised at the last treaty to break with Austria. Recalled The States used this to recall Aitzema in 1637, pretending that he needed to defend himself against the accusations raised; but the true reason was to inform the States about the situation at the court. To keep up the appearance of an inquiry, commissaries were appointed to interrogate him. They reported that the negative rumours were spread by a certain Menzelius, Imperial Commissary in Hamburg. The States decided to accept the defense of Aitzema, and to urge him to faithfully remain at his station. He was then sent to the Lower Saxon Circle to urge the members of this kreis to unanimity. The States also used him to get a secret understanding with the Emperor, to reach a separate treaty with Spain; some of them even wanted to position him at the court permanently. Mission to Sweden That same summer, he was sent with a secret mission to the Lord High Chancellor of Sweden Axel Oxenstierna, who resided in Magdeburg. He then fell into disfavor, maybe because he wanted to do more than his duty, maybe because his capabilities created too many enemies, and had to wrestle with the hatred of all since then. The emissionaries of Spain and France fanned the flames in Vienna. The one of Sweden broke his pledge. The French, following all actions of the Swedes, accused him of doing more for the Emperor than for the States. The Prince of Orange, who had, according to some, discussed his own business publicly too soon, considered him the cause of the knowledge of his secrets, and tried to blame the evil of it on him. Issue of Ameland Aitzema, together with Simon van Beaumont and Anthony Oetgens van Waveren, had received the island Ameland as his fief; this cast the suspicion of bribery and caused disrepute for him among the common people. This was brought to his attention by some letters he received in Hamburg: he replied on 26 March 1637 in a letter to the States, writing that he had discovered that some bad rumours about him were being spread, that he had started travelling 19 March to make an oral report, that he had heard, when he was in Oldenburg, that he was said to deserve the death penalty on twenty or thirty accounts, that the least punishment he could expect was being quartered; for which reasons he asked for a right of passage and some delay. The oft discussed case of Ameland was investigated and nothing found that contradicted the honesty of a faithful citizen. The States sent a letter to Hamburg, urging Aitzema to return forthwith to Holland; if he wouldn't comply, the Commissaries were ordered to request the government of Hamburg to arrest Aitzema and to deliver him and his papers to their highnesses. Flight to Prague Aitzema, upon hearing this, fled to Prague, where people also were opposed to him because of his efforts for the neutrality. Because all kings were now against him, he was nowhere safe. The States of Frisia were especially bitter, and authorised the court of justice to start a case against him; however, because no specific complaint was filed, nothing came of this. Aitzema, now wandering, fled from Prague to Vienna, where he died in 1637 after having converted to Roman Catholicism. He was buried in the church of the Dominicans. His numerous capacities, which he often used, were most probably the cause of the resentment people felt towards him. In his youth, he was highly regarded by Hugo de Groot and Cornelis van der Myle, who wrote a letter of recommendation to Daniel Heinsius, who was in Paris in 1617. Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft called him an overqualified man in one of his letters. In 1607, in Helmstad, he had published a few Latin poems and some writings concerning Civilian Law.

The national panel meet three times a year at the RFL's Red Hall headquarters to discuss and debate the following: Changes in the structure of youth rugby; Communications between young rugby league enthusiasts and the RFL; RFL policies which impact on young people. Two nominated members will also sit on the Youth & Junior Forum, a key device used to advance youth rugby league.http://www.midlandsrugbyleague.co.uk/article/rfl-to-form-young- peoples.html Forms of the game Both males and females can play youth and junior rugby league, in fact from under-7 up to the under-11 teams are of mixed gender. The age groups at clubs run from under-7 all the way up to under-18 and at present there are around 500 clubs. There are currently more than 30 community clubs who have developed female sections, with over 600 girls aged between 11 and 16 registered to play for sides at the under-12, under-14 and under-16 age groups. The Rugby Football League uses two modified forms of rugby league created by ARL Development in Australia. Mini league (known as mini footy in Australia) is played by all children up to Year 4 of Primary School. It is designed to provide children with a safe environment, a firm knowledge of the laws of rugby league and a chance to practice the skills such as tackling, passing and common defensive and attacking tactics. Players up to and including Year 6 of Primary School play mod league. Mod league is a bridge between mini league and full contact rugby league. On completion of mod league, players make a move to full international rugby league laws. Tag rugby, touch rugby and rugby league nines are also widely used to introduce young children to the sport of rugby league. English Schools Rugby League English Schools Rugby League was formed in 1967 following talks between the counties of Lancashire and Yorkshire. It was formed to enable the organising and playing of International games, to act as one body for the disbursement of Grant Aid received from the RFL and to act as an organising body to spread the game and to be a forum for committed and expert opinion. Champion Schools The Champion Schools tournament is a national competition for secondary schools. The RFL in partnership with English Schools Rugby League re-launched the Champion Schools Tournament in 2002 and since then it has continued to grow each year. In the 2005/6 academic year over 1,200 teams and 20,000 players competed in the Champion Schools tournament, making it the largest rugby league competition in the world. Eighty percent of participants are new to rugby league. The growth of the Champion Schools tournament led to the creation of the Carnegie Champion Colleges competition for Years 12 and 13. The regionally based competition was introduced in 2008 and started in January.\\"Carnegie Champion Schools\\" , The Rugby Football League, 13 May 2007 Regional leagues and competitions British Amateur Rugby League Association runs the Gilette National Youth League as well as the Yorkshire combination, West Riding Youth League, Hull & District Youth League, North West Counties U15 - U13, North West Counties U8 - U12 and North West Counties Youth.

He was born in 1622, the second son of Sir Greville Verney, 7th Baron Willoughby de Broke (1586–1642) and Catherine Southwell of Compton Verney, Warwickshire. He became head of the Verney family in August 1683 following the early death of his fifteen-year-old great-nephew William Verney, 10th Baron Willoughby de Broke, only male descendant of his elder brother Greville, and moved from his Rutland estate to live at Compton Verney. Richard Verney was High Sheriff of Rutland in 1682 and High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1683. He was elected to Parliament in 1685 as knight of the shire for Warwickshire and knighted on 1 April 1685, when he presented an address of congratulation from his constituents to King James II on his accession to the throne. He was reelected in 1689. In 1694 he formally laid claim to the dormant barony and, following a favourable ruling in the House of Lords, he assumed the title of 11th Baron Willoughby de Broke and 19th Baron Latimer in 1695. He married twice, firstly to Mary Pretyman, daughter of Sir John Pretyman of Leicestershire, and secondly to Frances Dove, daughter of Thomas Dove of Upton, Northamptonshire. By his first wife he had four children (Mary, John, George and Thomas), and by the second wife a daughter (Diana). On his death on 18 July 1711 he was buried in the chapel at Compton Verney and the title passed to his second son George (his eldest son John, MP for Leicestershire, having died childless in 1707).

See adjacent text for details. The International Space Station Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) is a life support system that provides or controls atmospheric pressure, fire detection and suppression, oxygen levels, waste management and water supply. The highest priority for the ECLSS is the ISS atmosphere, but the system also collects, processes, and stores waste and water produced and used by the crew—a process that recycles fluid from the sink, shower, toilet, and condensation from the air. The Elektron system aboard Zvezda and a similar system in Destiny generate oxygen aboard the station. The crew has a backup option in the form of bottled oxygen and Solid Fuel Oxygen Generation (SFOG) canisters. Carbon dioxide is removed from the air by the Russian Vozdukh system in Zvezda, one Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) located in the U.S. Lab module, and one CDRA in the U.S. Node 3 module. Other by-products of human metabolism, such as methane from flatulence and ammonia from sweat, are removed by activated charcoal filters or by the Trace Contaminant Control System (TCCS).  Water recovery systems  The ISS has two water recovery systems. Zvezda contains a water recovery system that processes water vapor from the atmosphere that could be used for drinking in an emergency but is normally fed to the Elektron system to produce oxygen. The American segment has a Water Recovery System installed during STS-126 that can process water vapour collected from the atmosphere and urine into water that is intended for drinking. The Water Recovery System was installed initially in Destiny on a temporary basis in November 2008 and moved into Tranquility (Node 3) in February 2010. The three ECLSS racks on display at the Marshall Space Flight Center ECLSS Test Facility in 2012. From left to right, the Water Recovery System (Rack 1), WRS (Rack 2) and Oxygen Generating System. The Water Recovery System consists of a Urine Processor Assembly and a Water Processor Assembly, housed in two of the three ECLSS racks. The Urine Processor Assembly uses a low pressure vacuum distillation process that uses a centrifuge to compensate for the lack of gravity and thus aid in separating liquids and gasses. The Urine Processor Assembly is designed to handle a load of 9 kg/day, corresponding to the needs of a 6-person crew. Although the design called for recovery of 85% of the water content, subsequent experience with calcium sulfate precipitation (in the free-fall conditions present on the ISS, calcium levels in urine are elevated due to bone density loss) has led to a revised operational level of recovering 70% of the water content. Water from the Urine Processor Assembly and from waste water sources are combined to feed the Water Processor Assembly that filters out gasses and solid materials before passing through filter beds and then a high-temperature catalytic reactor assembly. The water is then tested by onboard sensors and unacceptable water is cycled back through the water processor assembly. The Volatile Removal Assembly flew on STS-89 in January 1998 to demonstrate the Water Processor Assembly's catalytic reactor in microgravity. A Vapour Compression Distillation Flight Experiment flew, but was destroyed, in STS-107. The distillation assembly of the Urine Processor Assembly failed on 21 November 2008, one day after the initial installation. One of the three centrifuge speed sensors was reporting anomalous speeds, and high centrifuge motor current was observed. This was corrected by re-mounting the distillation assembly without several rubber vibration isolators. The distillation assembly failed again on 28 December 2008 due to high motor current and was replaced on 20 March 2009. Ultimately, during post-failure testing, one centrifuge speed sensor was found to be out of alignment and a compressor bearing had failed.  Atmosphere  Several systems are currently used on board the ISS to maintain the spacecraft's atmosphere, which is similar to the Earth's. Normal air pressure on the ISS is 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi); the same as at sea level on Earth. \\"While members of the ISS crew could stay healthy even with the pressure at a lower level, the equipment on the Station is very sensitive to pressure. If the pressure were to drop too far, it could cause problems with the Station equipment.\\".  Air revitalization system  Carbon dioxide and trace contaminants are removed by the Air Revitalization System. This is a NASA rack, placed in Tranquility, designed to provide a Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA), a Trace Contaminant Control Subassembly (TCCS) to remove hazardous trace contamination from the atmosphere and a Major Constituent Analyser (MCA) to monitor nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, hydrogen, and water vapour. The Air Revitalization System was flown to the station aboard STS-128 and was temporarily installed in the Japanese Experiment Module pressurised module. The system was scheduled to be transferred to Tranquility after it arrived and was installed during Space Shuttle Endeavour mission STS-130.  Oxygen generating system  The Oxygen Generating System (OGS) is a NASA rack designed to electrolyse water from the Water Recovery System to produce oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen is delivered to the cabin atmosphere. The unit is installed in the Destiny module. During one of the spacewalks conducted by STS-117 astronauts, a hydrogen vent valve required to begin using the system was installed. The system was delivered in 2006 by STS-121, and became operational on 12 July 2007. From 2001, the US orbital segment had used oxygen in a pressurized storage tank on the Quest airlock module, or from the Russian service module. Prior to the activation of the Sabatier System in October 2010 hydrogen and carbon dioxide extracted from the cabin was vented overboard. In 2011, American news outlet CBS news and news magazine spaceflightnow reported \\"The OGA over the past six months has not been running well because the water that's been fed to it is just slightly too acidic,\\" said station Flight Director Chris Edelen. \\"For the past several months, the station crew has been using oxygen brought up aboard visiting Progress supply ships, a European cargo craft and the Russian Elektron oxygen generator while awaiting delivery of the OGA repair equipment. The OGA, like the Elektron, uses electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. \\"http://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts133/110305fd10/index2.html  Sabatier system  The Sabatier system closes the loop in the ECLSS by combining waste hydrogen from the Oxygen generating system and carbon dioxide from the station atmosphere using the Sabatier reaction and preserving these valuable chemicals. The outputs of this reaction are water, and methane. The water is recycled to reduce the total amount of water that must be carried to the station from Earth, and the methane is vented overboard by the now shared hydrogen vent line installed for the Oxygen generating system.  Elektron  Elektron units in the Zvezda service module. Elektron is a Russian Electrolytic Oxygen Generator, which was also used on Mir. It uses electrolysis to produce oxygen. This process splits water molecules reclaimed from other uses on board the station into oxygen and hydrogen via electrolysis. The oxygen is vented into the cabin and the hydrogen is vented into space. The three Russian Elektron oxygen generators on board the International Space Station have been plagued with problems, frequently forcing the crew to use backup sources (either bottled oxygen or the Vika system discussed below). To support a crew of six, NASA added the oxygen generating system discussed above. In 2004, the Elektron unit shut down due to (initially) unknown causes. Two weeks of troubleshooting resulted in the unit starting up again, then immediately shutting down. The cause was eventually traced to gas bubbles in the unit, which remained non-functional until a Progress resupply mission in October 2004. In 2005 ISS personnel tapped into the oxygen supply of the recently arrived Progress resupply ship, when the Elektron unit failed. In 2006 fumes from a malfunctioning Elektron unit prompted NASA flight engineers to declare a \\"spacecraft emergency\\". A burning smell led the ISS crew to suspect another Elektron fire, but the unit was only \\"very hot\\". A leak of corrosive, odorless potassium hydroxide forced the ISS crew to don gloves and face masks. It has been conjectured that the smell came from overheated rubber seals. The incident occurred shortly after STS-115 left and just before arrival of a resupply mission (including space tourist Anousheh Ansari). The Elektron did not come back online until November 2006, after new valves and cables arrived on the October 2006 Progress resupply vessel. The ERPTC (Electrical Recovery Processing Terminal Current) was inserted into the ISS to prevent harm to the systems.  Vika  The Vika or TGK oxygen generator, also known as Solid Fuel Oxygen Generation (SFOG) when used on the ISS, is a chemical oxygen generator originally developed by Roscosmos for Mir, and it provides an alternate oxygen generating system.Kerry Ellis - International Life Support - Ask Magazine It uses canisters of solid lithium perchlorate, which are burned to create gaseous oxygen. Each canister can supply the oxygen needs of one crewmember for one day.  Vozdukh  Another Russian system, Vozdukh (Russian Воздух, meaning \\"air\\"), removes carbon dioxide from the air based on the use of regenerable absorbers of carbon dioxide gas.\\"In-Flight Carbon Dioxide Exposures and Related Symptoms: Association, Susceptibility, and Operational Implications\\" (see page 6), NASA, June 2010.  Temperature and Humidity Control  Temperature and Humidity Control (THC) is the subsystem of the ISS ECLSS concerned with the maintenance of a steady air temperature and the control of the moisture in the station's air supply. Thermal Control System (TCS) is a component part of the THC system and subdivides into the Active Thermal Control System (ATCS) and Passive Thermal Control System (PTCS). Controlling humidity is possible through lowering or raising the temperature and through adding moisture to the air.  Fire Detection and Suppression  Fire Detection and Suppression (FDS) is the subsystem devoted to identifying that there has been a fire and taking steps to fight it.

Crime in Haiti is investigated by the Haitian police.  Crime by type = Murders in Haiti  Reliable crime statistics for Haiti is difficult to come by.

Thus, for example, the United Nations office on Drugs and Crime UNODC documented 1,033 murders, for a murder rate of 10.2 per 100,000 people, in 2012, and as few as 486 (5.1 per 100,000 people) in 2007.Global Study on Homicide. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2013. In the 22 months after the ouster of President Aristide in 2004, the murder rate for Port-au- Prince reached an all-time high of 219 murders per 100,000 residents.\\"Kolbe: Political and Social Marginalization Behind Increases in Crime\\", Haiti: Relief and Reconstruction Watch, Center for Economic and Policy Research, March 22, 2012. In contrast, an independent study tracking a large number of households in urban areas of Haiti recorded 11 murders among 15690 tracked residents during a 7-month period from August 2011 to February 2012. \\"Haiti’s Urban Crime Wave? Results from Monthly Household Surveys August 2011 – February 2012\\", Rio de Janeiro: Instituto Igarape. Kolbe, Athena R & Muggah, Robert (2012), p.3. Preliminary results of the assessment found: The number of reported homicides across all urban settings increased considerably between November 2011 and February 2012. Half of the reported murders occurred during armed robbery or attempted armed robbery. While Port-au-Prince's overall homicide is low in comparison to other Caribbean cities, this nevertheless represents a rate of 60.9 per 100,000, one of the highest recorded rates since 2004; \\"Haiti’s Urban Crime Wave? Results from Monthly Household Surveys August 2011 – February 2012\\", Rio de Janeiro: Instituto Igarape. Kolbe, Athena R & Muggah, Robert (2012), p.1. All but one of the murders occurred in Port-au- Prince. See {crime in Port-au-Prince}  Sexual violence  Sexual violence in Haiti is a common phenomenon. Being raped is considered shameful in Haitian society, and victims may find themselves abandoned by loved ones or with reduced marriageability. Until 2005, rape was not legally considered a serious crime and a rapist could avoid jail by marrying his victim. Reporting a rape to police in Haiti is a difficult and convoluted process, a factor that contributes to underreporting and difficulty in obtaining accurate statistics about sexual violence. Few rapists face any punishment. A UN Security Council study in 2006 reported 35,000 sexual assaults against women and girls between 2004 and 2006. The UN reported in 2006 that half of the women living in the capital city Port au Prince's slums had been raped. United Nations peacekeepers stationed in Haiti since 2004 have drawn widespread resentment after reports emerged of the soldiers raping Haitian civilians. The 2010 Haitian earthquake caused over a million Haitians to move to refugee camps where conditions are dangerous and poor. A study by a human rights group found that 14% of Haitian households reported having at least one member suffered sexual violence between the January 2010 earthquake and January 2012. In 2012, sexual assaults in Port au Prince were reported at a rate 20 times higher in the camps than elsewhere in Haiti. A 2009 study reported that up to 225,000 Haitian children are forced to work as domestic servants, and are at grave risk of rape at the hands of their captors. The children, known as restaveks, are traded into other households by their families, exchanging the children's labor for upbringing. Two thirds of restaveks are female, and most of them come from very poor families and are given to better-off ones. Restaveks who are young and female are particularly likely to be victimized sexually. Female restaveks are sometimes referred to as \\"la pou sa\\" which translates to \\"there for that\\"—'that' being the sexual pleasure of the males of the family with whom they are staying.  Corruption  Corruption is a severe and widespread problem in all levels of government in Haiti. Although there has been some progress since 2008, when Haiti was rated the world's fourth most corrupt country, there remains much room for improvement. Corruption has always been \\"endemic\\" in Haiti, but \\"became widespread that it bankrupted state finances\\" under the rule of Jean-Claude Duvalier (\\"Baby Doc\\").Philippe Girard, Haiti: The Tumultuous History – From Pearl of the Caribbean to Broken Nation (Parlgrace MacMillan: 2005), p. 112. Under Duvalier's regime (1971–1986), Haiti's transportation network was plundered, and regime elites frequently \\"raided the accounts of state monopolies\\" such as the Régie du Tabac (Tobacco Administration) while failing to pay taxes.Girard, p. 112. Economist Leslie Delatour described Haiti's economy as one in near-shambles Legal experts have cited a lack of judicial integrity in the country. Two experts in public administration, Derick Brinkerhoff and Carmen Halpern, said that government corruption is ingrained in Haitian politics.  Illegal drug trade  The illegal drug trade in Haiti involves trans-shipment of cocaine and marijuana to the United States. It is a major shipment route. The island of Hispaniola, which Haiti shares with the Dominican Republic places Haiti in an ideal location for drug smuggling between Colombia and Puerto Rico. Because Puerto Rico is a Commonwealth of the United States, shipments are generally not subject to further U.S. Customs inspection after reaching the territory. Cocaine is also often smuggled directly to Miami in freighters.Haiti: Drug Trafficking Crossroads U.S. government agencies estimate that 83 metric tons or about eight percent of the cocaine entering the United States in 2006 transited either Haiti or the Dominican Republic.United States Institute of Peace, June 2007, Haiti's Drug Problem Throughout the late 1980s and into the 1990s, leading members of the Haitian military, intelligence and police were involved in the illegal drug trade in Haiti, assisting Colombian drug traffickers smuggling drugs into the United States.Whitney, Kathleen Marie (1996), \\"Sin, Fraph, and the CIA: U.S. Covert Action in Haiti\\", Southwestern Journal of Law and Trade in the Americas, Vol. 3, Issue 2 (1996), pp. 303–332  Kidnapping, robbery  Crimes such as kidnappings, death threats, murders, armed robberies, home break-ins and car-jacking are not uncommon in Haiti. From 2007 to 2016 there was a major decrease in kidnappings of U.S. citizens, but a rise in armed robberies. The incidence of kidnapping in Haiti diminished from its peak in 2006 when 60 U.S. citizens were reported kidnapped to one kidnapping in 2014. Since May 2014, there have been incidents involving travelers arriving in Port-au-Prince who are attacked and robbed after driving away from the airport. The US Embassy is aware of cases involving 64 U.S. citizens, resulting in three fatalities and several injuries. All cases have involved armed robbers by thieves on motorcycles pulling alongside vehicles in congested traffic. U.S. citizens of Haitian descent have accounted for almost all of the victims. Police authorities believe criminals may target travelers arriving on flights from the United States based on advance information gained from local contacts.  By location = Port-au-Prince  A dense slum in Port-au-Prince. A 2012 independent study found that the murder rate in the capital Port-au-Prince was 60.9 murders per 100,000 residents in February 2012. In the 22 months after the end of the President Aristide era in 2004, the murder rate for Port-au-Prince reached a high of 219 murders per 100,000 residents per year. High-crime zones in the Port-au-Prince area include Croix- des-Bouquets, Cite-Soleil, Carrefour, Bel Air, Martissant, the port road (Boulevard La Saline), urban route Nationale#1, the airport road (Boulevard Toussaint L'Ouverture) and its adjoining connectors to the New (\\"American\\") Road via Route Nationale#1. This latter area in particular has been the scene of numerous robberies, carjackings, and murders.\\"Haiti: Country-Specific Information\\". U.S. Department of State (December 4, 2014). Accessed April 12, 2015. . In the Bel Air neighbourhood of Port-au-Prince, the murder rate reached 50 murders per 100,000 residents at the end of 2011, up from 19 murders per 100,000 residents in 2010. \\"Haiti’s Urban Crime Wave? Results from Monthly Household Surveys August 2011 – February 2012\\", Rio de Janeiro: Instituto Igarape. Kolbe, Athena R & Muggah, Robert (2012), p.4.  Crime dynamics  While the Haitian National Police (HNP) and the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) personnel patrol many areas, travel within Port- au-Prince can be particularly challenging and certain areas of the city have more crime. Criminal perpetrators often operate in groups of three to four individuals, and may occasionally be confrontational and gratuitously violent. Criminals sometimes will seriously injure or kill those who resist their attempts to commit crime. In robberies or home invasions, it is not uncommon for the assailants to beat or shoot the victim in order to limit the victim's ability to resist.  Carnival  Holiday periods, especially Christmas and Carnival, often bring a significant increase in criminal activity. Haiti's Carnival season is marked by street celebrations in the days leading up to Ash Wednesday. In recent years, Carnival has been accompanied by civil disturbances, altercations and severe traffic disruptions. People attending Carnival events or simply caught in the resulting celebrations have been injured and killed. Roving musical bands called \\"rah-rahs\\" operate during the period from New Year's Day through Carnival. The potential for injury and the destruction of property during rah-rahs is high. A mob mentality can develop unexpectedly leaving people and cars engulfed and at risk. During Carnival, rah-rahs continuously form without warning; some rah-rahs have identified themselves with political entities, lending further potential for violence.  Haitian police  While the size of the Haitian National Police (HNP) is increasing and its capabilities are improving, it is still understaffed and, under-equipped. As a result, it is unable to respond to all calls for assistance. There are allegations of police complicity in criminal activity. The response and enforcement capabilities of the HNP and the weakness of the judiciary often frustrate victims of crime in Haiti.

The store has been in business since 1974. Overview It is operated by Ray Alvarez and serves an eclectic mix of foods, including egg creams, soft serve ice cream, frozen yogurt, New Orleans style beignets, Belgian fries, and coffee. The store has been featured in several books, films, and television shows. It's also become famous for its annual Birthday Burlesque Extravaganza, an invite-only surprise birthday party held in honor of the proprietor. Alvarez was born on January 1, 1933 in Iran and moved to New York in 1964, where he worked for another decade as a dishwasher in New York until he paid $30,000 for the candy store in 1974. On the notorious night of August 6, 1988, while the police battled protesters in what came to be known as the Tompkins Square Park Riot, Ray's Candy Store remained open, per Ray, \\"because all the combatants were his customers.\\" On the morning of June 19, 1992, anti-crime activist, founder and CEO of the Guardian Angels, and radio talk show host and media personality, Curtis Sliwa, was kidnapped and shot by two gunmen after entering a stolen taxi outside Ray's Candy Store. In early 2010, Ray's Candy Store fell behind on its rent and faced eviction by its landlord. The business was the subject of much press as a result. In a broad show of support, friends, neighbors, customers, and other community members quickly rushed to Ray's aid, hosting various fundraisers and starting a social media campaign meant to boost the beloved business's profile. In July 2011, after a decades-long process, proprietor Ray, who's real name is Asghar Ghahraman, became a naturalized U.S. citizen at a ceremony held at 26 Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan. Years earlier, he had jumped ship from the Iranian Navy, but anxiety about his status as an illegal immigrant led him to adopt a new identity in his new home — as a Puerto Rican named Ray Alvarez. Asghar- turned-Ray eventually received amnesty under President Reagan — but, in a twist of fate, his green card was mailed to the wrong address, and he remained stuck in legal limbo. Without proper documentation, he faced an uphill road to naturalization. With the help of friends who assisted him with paperwork, Ray, 78 at the time, was finally able to qualify to become an American. New York photographer Robert \\"Bob\\" Arihood often staked out a spot in front of Ray's Candy store taking pictures of the comings and going around the store and often portrayed Ray and his store on his blog, Neither more nor less. After Arihood's death in October of 2011, he was temporarily memorialized on the sign of Ray's Candy Store.http://neithermorenorless.blogspot.com/ In August 2015, Ray's Candy Store was selected as the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation's \\"Business of the Month.\\" In November 2016, Ray's Candy Store won \\"Best Restaurant\\" in the East Village in the inaugural Time Out New York Love New York Awards.

Groups of \\"drug pushers, homeless people and young people known as 'skinheads had largely taken over the park. The Alphabet City/East Village neighborhood, in which the park was located, was divided about what, if anything, should be done about it.Koch Suspends Park Curfew Following bloody clash in Tompkins Square, Manuel Perez-Rivas, Newsday, August 8, 1988, NEWS; Pg. 5. The local governing body, Manhattan Community Board 3, recommended, and the New York City Parks Department adopted, a 1 a.m. curfew for the previously 24-hour park, in an attempt to bring it under control. Ray's Candy Store, located across from the entrance to the park, remained open during the riot that ensued. Ray said he stayed open \\"because all the combatants were his customers.\\" Curtis Sliwa murder attempt On the morning of June 19, 1992, anti-crime activist, founder and CEO of the Guardian Angels, and radio talk show host and media personality, Curtis Sliwa, was kidnapped and shot by two gunmen after entering a stolen taxi outside Ray's Candy Store. The taxi picked up Sliwa near his home in the East Village and a gunman hiding in the front passenger seat jumped up and fired several shots, hitting him in the groin and legs. The kidnapping was apparently foiled when Sliwa leapt from the front window of the moving cab and escaped. Sliwa underwent surgery for internal injuries and leg wounds. Federal prosecutors eventually charged John A. Gotti, the son of Gambino crime family leader John Gotti, with the attempted murder, among a raft of other charges. Prosecutors claimed that Gotti was angered by remarks Sliwa had made about his father on his radio program. However, after three attempts to try him, the last on September 20, 2005, three separate juries were unable to agree to convict Gotti on all of the charges brought against him and the charges were dropped. Jurors later told reporters they did believe he had a role in Sliwa's shooting. Prosecutors declined to re-try Gotti and dismissed the charges against him. Sliwa has said he would seek damages in civil court. Michael Yannotti, a Gotti associate, was also charged with shooting Sliwa in the incident but was acquitted. Yannotti, however, was sentenced to 20 years on an unrelated racketeering charge. Still, Manhattan Federal Judge Shira Scheindlin said evidence suggested Yannotti was the shooter.

Gameplay  Fiasco is a role-playing game with no GM, the game being set up before the action starts. The game is for three to five players, and takes between one and three hours, including two acts and an aftermath. The things required to play are: * four ordinary (six sided) dice per player of two different colors * a Fiasco Playset * a copy of the Fiasco Tilt Table and the Fiasco Aftermath Table * pen and paper Set-up The players first select the playset and roll dice (four per player—two light, two dark). The players then go around the table, taking turns to choose a die. Using the value of the die, the player selects a group, or an element of a previously selected group, from a list provided by the playset to establish relationships (one for each adjacent player), needs, objects, and locations. Each pair of adjacent players has a defined relationship and one other element (a need, an object, or a location; that is central to the relationship). After all dice have been used, they are all returned to a central pool to be used as the game progresses. After all dice values have been used, each player will share with each neighbor: * One relationship * One need, object, or location The players then discuss who their characters are, what they are called, and how they relate to each other, and the objects, needs, and locations their characters share. Once this is decided Act One is ready to begin. Act One In Act One, for each player's turn, she or he may choose either to Establish or to Resolve. Should the player choose to Establish, the content of the scene—people, place, conflict—is determined by the player. Doing this allows the player to set up the scene as they wish. However, the resolution of the scene or conflict is determined by the other players, who will choose a light die (a good resolution) or a dark die (a bad resolution) to give to the player in the middle of the scene. The player must accept the resolution, acting out or narrating events accordingly. Alternatively, should the player choose to Resolve, the other players dictate the circumstances of the scene: the characters with whom the player's character will interact, where it happens, and what the conflict within the scene is. Choosing this option gives the player control of the resolution, unlike the Establish option. In Act One, at the conclusion of a player's scene, she or he selects another player and gives that person the Resolution die. After each player has had two scenes, half the dice are exhausted and Act One ends. The Tilt and Act Two Between Act One and Act Two is the \\"Tilt\\"—the incident that is the heart of the story. To determine who selects the Tilt elements, all players roll their dice (if they have any). Same-colored die values are added together and the lower total is subtracted from the greater. The player with the highest total for dark dice and the player with highest total for light dice then roll all unassigned dice. As when setting up the game, these two players each select one group (such as \\"Tragedy\\" or \\"Failure\\") on the Tilt Table using the values from the rolled, unassigned dice. Using the remaining die values, the two players choose an element from the other's chosen group (\\"Death, out of the blue\\" or \\"A tiny mistake leads to ruin\\"), thus establishing the \\"tilt\\" element of the story. After the Tilt has been established, Act Two progresses in the same way as Act One, with each player deciding whether to Establish or Resolve scenes in the same order as Act One. Typically, the selected Tilt elements will come into play immediately, but this is not always the case. In some games, the Tilt elements will not show up until the climax of the story, where they will alter the fates of the characters. Also, along with the new Tilt elements introduced, the biggest difference in Act Two is that instead of giving away the Resolution die, the player keeps it. If there were mostly positive resolutions in Act One, there will, by necessity, be mostly negative resolutions in Act Two. The Aftermath After all the dice are exhausted—each player having had four scenes—everyone rolls the dice they have collected, just like when determining who chooses the Tilt element, and consults the Aftermath table to determine whether their characters has a positive or negative outcome, is dead, or is \\"worse than dead\\". Finally, after a player figures out her or his character's fate, the Aftermath is played out. Going around the table, each player takes a turn to narrate a short scene, formed into a montage, for their character until all players run out of dice. At that point, the game is finished. History and reception Fiasco started as a game called Hat Creek, about the life and death of a town in the American West, with the relationships created as a part of that game becoming the eventual basis for Fiasco. The game itself took 14 months to playtest, and used over 70 playtesters in 13 groups. In November 2008 Jason Morningstar asked for interested playtesters on the story-games forum, and Fiasco was published in December 2009. Reception was initially very positive in the RPG community, with Fiasco winning one Indie RPG award at GenCon 2010 and being runner up in three other categories.RPG Geek profile as well as being shortlisted for an Origins Award. A year later, at GenCon 2011, Fiasco became only the fourth RPG to win the Diana Jones award. Reviews in the mainstream press have generally been positive; its review, Eurogamer called it \\"Criminally good fun\\" and \\"The funniest game I've ever played\\". Wired said, \\"Fiasco is hands down one of the best RPGs I have ever played. ... if you despise collaborative gaming experiences and want very traditional RPG mechanics, Fiasco is going to be a poor fit.\\" and noted that \\"Fiasco can easily venture in to areas that may make certain players uncomfortable and so it’s important for people, especially those unfamiliar with each other, to discuss potential limits and taboo subjects before the start of any game.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald noted that \\"Clearly, this is not a game for everyone.

A decade of warfare produced a military cadre from which Haiti's early leaders emerged. Defeat of the French demonstrated Haiti's considerable strategic stamina and tactical capabilities. The armed forces, who had been united against the French, fragmented into warring regional factions. The military very soon took control of almost every aspect of Haitian life. Officers assumed responsibility for the administration of justice and for municipal management. According to a Haitian diplomat, the country was in its earlier days \\"an immense military camp.\\" Without viable civilian institutions, Haiti was vulnerable to military personalities, who permanently shaped the nation's authoritarian, personalist, and coercive style of governance. Nineteenth century During the latter half of the nineteenth century, the army either failed to protect the central government or directly caused the government's collapse. Rural insurgent movements led by piquets and cacos limited the central government's authority in outlying areas. These groups carried on war into the twentieth century; they were finally put down by the United States Marines in 1919. Prolonged instability weakened the military. By the end of the nineteenth century, Haiti's military had become little more than an undisciplined, ill-fed, and poorly paid militia that shifted its allegiances as battles were won or lost and as new leaders came to power. Between 1806 and 1879, an estimated 69 revolts against existing governments took place; another 20 uprisings, or attempted insurrections, broke out between 1908 and 1915. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Haiti's political problems attracted increasing foreign involvement. France, Germany, and the United States were the major actors; the latter occupied the country in 1915. During the occupation, the United States made an unsuccessful attempt to modernize Haiti's armed forces. The United States Marines disbanded Haiti's army, which consisted of an estimated 9,000 men, including 308 generals. In February 1916, the Haitian Constabulary (Gendarmerie d'Haïti) was formed. United States Marine and United States Navy officers and noncommissioned officers (NCOs) commanded the group. The Gendarmerie attempted to secure public safety, initially by subduing the cacos; to promote development, particularly road construction; and to modernize the military through the introduction of a training structure, a health service, and other improvements. The United States administration of Haiti (1915–34) brought order and resulted in some economic and social development. At the same time, the United States overhauled Haiti's disintegrated military infrastructure. The Gendarmerie became the Garde d'Haïti in 1928; the Garde formed the core of Haiti's armed forces after the United States administration ended. The United States sought to establish a modern, apolitical military force in Haiti. On the surface, it succeeded; the organization, the training, and the equipment of the Garde all represented improvements over the military conditions existing before the occupation. Army politics in the 20th Century Some professionalization of the army continued for a few years after the United States occupation, but Haiti's political structure deteriorated rapidly after 1934, weakening civilmilitary relations and ultimately affecting the character of the armed forces. After the coup of 1946 and after Colonel Paul E. Magloire's election to the presidency in 1950, the army again assumed a political role. This development divided the army internally, and it set the stage for François Duvalier's ascent to power in late 1957 (see Politics and the Military, 1934–57, ch. 6). During the three decades of despotic Duvalier rule, a parallel security force, the VSN emerged. The Duvaliers maintained control of the country through this brutal force, which was independent of the armed forces. Both Duvaliers lacked military experience; still, they managed to neutralize the army's influence through intimidation, bribery, and political maneuvering. The Duvaliers also managed to stave off a number of low-level opposition plots and invasion attempts, mostly during the 1960s. François Duvalier, 1957-71 When François Duvalier came to power in 1957, the armed forces were at their lowest point, professionally, since 1915. Internal tension stemmed from political, generational, and racial divisions within the army command. The leadership of the former Garde d'Haïti, trained by the United States Marines, was aging and was slowly giving way to a younger cadre of Military Academy graduates from the 1940s. Duvalier hastened this process by retiring a group of senior officers and promoting a number of junior officers. Duvalier's establishment of a parallel security apparatus posed the most serious challenge to the crumbling integrity of the armed forces. In late 1958, Duvalier reinstated, and took direct control of, the Presidential Guard (Garde Présidentielle), and he eliminated the Maison Militaire (military household), which had served as the presidential security unit before the Duvalier era. In 1959 the regime began recruiting a civilian militia (Milice Civile), ostensibly as an adjunct to the Presidential Guard. Drawn initially from the capital city's slums and equipped with antiquated small arms found in the basement of the Presidential Palace, the civilian militia, commonly known as the \\"Tonton Macoutes\\", became the VSN after 1962. The VSN's control extended into the countryside, through a system of information, intelligence, and command tied directly to the Presidential Palace. The armed forces yielded political power to the new regime and lost many of their institutionalized features, developed during the previous thirty years. Duvalier closed down the Military Academy in 1961. A professional and elitist institution, the academy represented a potential source of opposition to the regime. Officers who attempted to resist Duvalier forfeited their careers. In 1963 Duvalier expelled the United States military mission, which he had invited to Haiti in 1959, because he believed that military-modernization values imparted by United States instructors could lead to resistance to the government's restructuring of the armed forces. Duvalier succeeded in overpowering the mainstream military establishment, but the process was painful; it required several abrupt attacks. For example, Duvalier eliminated, or exiled, anyone who opposed him. Duvalier's ruthlessness and suspicion caused members of his own security apparatus to turn against him - most notably Clément Barbot, one of the original VSN chiefs. By the mid-1960s, the VSN and the army routinely cooperated on internal security matters, even though the two groups were suspicious of each other. There were occasional lapses in the security apparatus, however. In 1967 several bombs exploded near the palace, and the regime subsequently executed nineteen officers of the Presidential Guard. In 1970 the entire membership of Haiti's small Coast Guard staged an abortive mutiny. The regime referred to the VSN as a militia. This designation masked the organization's role as the Duvalier's front-line security force. The VSN acted as political cadres, secret police, and instruments of terror. In addition, they played a crucial political role for the regime: they countered the influence of the armed forces, historically the nation's foremost institutional power. François Duvalier went farther than any of his predecessors in his efforts to reduce the ability of the military to influence selection of the country's leaders. The VSN's success in keeping the army and the rest of Haitian society in check created what has been described as a VSN- led \\"parabureaucracy.\\" The VSN gained its deadly reputation partially because its members received no salary, even though they worked for the National Palace (Palais National). They made their livings, instead, through extortion and petty crime. Rural members of the VSN, who wore blue denim uniforms, had received some training from the army, while the plainclothed members, with their dark glasses, served as Haiti's criminal-investigation force (see Public Order, this ch.). When Jean-Claude Duvalier (\\"Baby Doc\\") came to power in 1971, the country's security forces became less abusive, but they still used some brutality. During Jean-Claude's regime, the balance between the VSN and the armed forces changed. The new regime sought to realign these competing power bases, if only to ensure control over the nation's security apparatus. Furthermore, JeanClaude 's half-hearted attempt to open Haiti to the outside world and to secure renewed foreign assistance from the United States suggested a need to restrain the abuses of the VSN, which included more than 9,000 members and an informal circle of thousands in early 1986. The creation of the Leopards counterinsurgency unit, with United States' support, provided the regime with a relatively modern tool for responding to internal threats. The Leopards also provided Baby Doc with a new force, the capability and the allegiance of which bridged the gap between the armed forces and the VSN. A reorganization integrated some senior VSN members into the army, effecting a partial merger of Haiti's two security institutions. In 1972 the Military Academy reopened, and a politically well-connected class—the first since 1961—graduated in 1973. The reopening of the academy represented a small step toward reprofessionalizing the military. Some modernization of army equipment was also undertaken during this period. The armed forces entered the 1980s as a mere shadow of the powerful, disciplined, trained institution that had existed forty years earlier. Although the army successfully repelled a number of attempts against the regime, it ultimately failed to prevent Duvalier's fall under pressure from his own populace. With lastminute assistance from the United States, the army's senior leadership provided the political transition required to ease Duvalier out of power in February 1986. A number of senior officers pushed for Duvalier's abdication, despite strong resistance from Jean-Claude and the senior leadership of the VSN. The army was interested in protecting itself from the explosive sociopolitical situation in Haiti in late 1985 and early 1986. Nationalism and concern for the best interests of Haiti exerted only a secondary influence on the officers' actions. The armed forces largely escaped the immediate wrath of a population clearly bent on putting an end to Duvalier rule. Popular violence had erupted in 1984, and it continued into early 1986 in an expanding sequence of local revolts. In its waning days, the regime relied heavily on the VSN and on limited local police capabilities to curb violence. Many Haitians detected the fissures growing in the nation's security apparatus, and some rumors held that the army would move against Duvalier. These rumors, however, proved incorrect; still, Duvalier's inability to contain the widespread rioting through political measures and the VSN's failure to control the unrest placed the military in a pivotal position. Conscious of his precarious hold on power, Duvalier reshuffled the cabinet and the military leadership in the last days of 1985, but to no avail. Reports of brutal excesses by the increasingly desperate VSN further weakened Duvalier's position. The army became discontent with the crumbling regime. In several instances, troops refused to fire on demonstrators, and in a few cases, army personnel turned against the VSN. According to one account, several senior military figures threatened Duvalier and his wife, Michèle Duvalier, at gunpoint. The Post-Duvalier period Jean-Claude Duvalier left behind a hastily constructed interim junta, controlled by the armed forces. Lieutenant General Henri Namphy, army chief of staff, became head of the interim National Council of Government (Conseil Nationale de Gouvernement—CNG). Colonel Williams Regala, the head of the Military Academy; Lieutenant General Prosper Avril of the Presidential Guard; and Colonel Jean-Claude Paul of the regular army were also key figures in the interim government. The CNG officially disbanded the VSN a few days after Duvalier's departure, but it avoided the politically difficult measure of effectively halting the VSN's activities. This nonfeasance prompted angry mobs to murder known members of the VSN and set in motion a cycle of instability from which Haiti had yet to recover in the late 1980s. Despite the popular backlash, some members of the VSN managed to survive by integrating themselves into military circles. The consequences of the army's failure to dismantle the VSN became obvious in the bloody events leading up to the aborted elections of November 1987 (see Background: From Duvalier to Avril, 1957–89, ch. 9). The CNG's attempt to balance demands for, and resistance to, reforms gave way to chaos. By 1987 the armed forces had lost the favorable reputation they had enjoyed a year earlier. Worse, the senior military command appeared to be doing little to stop attacks against the electoral process. The disastrous elections of 1987 and 1988 isolated the Haitian military from the international community, which had grown skeptical about the role of the armed forces. The situation unraveled further in 1988, under the short-lived civilian government of Leslie Manigat (February–June 1988), who was overthrown when he retired the Port-au-Prince police chief and attempted to reshuffle the army command. CNG leader Namphy returned as head of government, with the support of other commanders. In September 1988, another coup (September 1988 Haitian coup d'état) brought Prosper Avril to power. Avril was an experienced officer with a career dating back to the Duvalier era. The armed forces continued to face problems, however, even after Avril came to power. From September 1988 through March 1989, 140 officers reportedly were retired or were fired, some because they were suspected of drug smuggling. Allegations that government officials were involved in drug trafficking became widely known after a United States court indicted Colonel Jean-Claude Paul, then commander of the Dessalines Battalion, on charges of cocaine distribution. Paul's wife had previously been arrested in Miami on cocaine charges. Paul's mysterious death in the fall of 1988 only partially resolved the issue of military involvement in drug trafficking. At about the same time, United States authorities arrested and convicted a former CNG associate of Namphy, Colonel Gary Léon, on drug-trafficking charges. Avril's attempts to purge the government of Duvalierist forces included ousting individuals who had graduated from the Military Academy in 1973. The move reflected additional political rifts within the senior command. Sensing the low stature of the Avril government, segments of the senior command split into warring factions in April 1989. Reports alleged that proDuvalierist elements had helped to provoke dissension within the officer corps. The loyalty of the Presidential Guard and support from many NCOs helped Avril prevail in a week of internecine conflict with the officer corps. The conflict, however, left the military in a state of crisis. Duvalier's collapse initially had enhanced the national standing of the FAd'H. But the group's senior commanders, when thrust by events to the forefront of governance, had reverted to the traditional use of force to carry out a vaguely defined political program. Other actors, such as the Roman Catholic Church or political parties, remained divided in the post–1986 period, and they were therefore generally ineffectual politically (see Interest Groups, ch. 9). The failure of Haiti's civilian leadership to negotiate an alternative political course further reinforced the FAd'H's self-characterization as the decisive agent of Haitian affairs. Beginning in 2011, the Haitian government began the process of the reestablishment of the Haitian army.

When activated, the wing assumed the mission, manpower, equipment, weapons, and facilities of the 6605th Air Base Wing, which had been established on 1 June 1954. Eighth Air Force provided intermediate command and control from its establishment until 1 January 1959, when the 45th Air Division became its assigned headquarters. United States Air Force (USAF) and Army Air Forces personnel had been assigned to Harmon since 1941. It was first operated as a refueling stop on the North Atlantic transport route, later as a fighter-interceptor base assigned to Northeast Air Command. SAC assumed control of base in 1957 and established the 4081st Strategic Wing when facility was upgraded to provide a deployment base for SAC bombers and tankers. The base supported deployed aircraft, with no permanent operational aircraft assigned to the wing, controlling them through the \\"Harmon Task Force.\\" The wing was discontinued in 1966 and its remaining personnel and equipment were transferred to the 4081st Air Base Squadron until the USAF presence at Harmon ended in January 1967 and the base was turned over to the Royal Canadian Air Force.
