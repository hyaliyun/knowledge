It was founded on 4 September 1950 by Ryuichi Tomiya. The company operated five plants, all located in Japan. It was one of the biggest export vehicle manufacturers of the concern. In July 2012 it was merged with two other Toyota subsidiaries operating in Tohoku to form Toyota Motor East Japan. History Central Motors was the operational successor of (Kamata, Tokyo). In 1950, employees of the Kamata Plant were made redundant after it was closed down by Toyota. They founded Central Motors that year and began producing light commercial vehicles for Toyota in 1956. In 1959, Toyota acquired the company and moved the production from Kamata to Sagamihara which would later also become the headquarters base. The company opened various facilities for auto parts production. A new assembly plant and headquarters were built in Ohira, Miyagi. The new facility started production in January 2011 and the Sagamihara plant was closed later that year. On 1 July 2012, three Toyota subcontractors (Central Motors, Toyota Motors Tohoku and Kanto Auto Works) were combined into a single company, with all their manufacturing facilities and assets renamed as Toyota Motor East Japan, Inc. After the merger of the three former companies, the corporate headquarters was established at the former Central Motors site in Miyagi. There were just over 1,500 employees at the Central Motors location. Operations At closing, Central Motors operated the following facilities: *Ohira, Miyagi (headquarters) *Ohira, Miyagi (car assembly plant) *Wakayanagi, Miyagi (auto parts plant) Central Motors mainly manufactured vehicles meant for export to Europe or North America. Special vehicles such as police, fire department vehicles as well as campers were produced by the company. Production also included CKD kits of the Toyota Tundra.

Standing at 3,371 metres, it is the third highest mountain of the Sierra Nevada range and the fifth in the Iberian Peninsula. The impressive north face can be seen from the town of Granada. The name Alcazaba derives from the word fortification. Location The mountain is located between the Mulhacén and Puntal de Vacares mountains, and is one of the most isolated places in the Sierra Nevada. Ascent requires a minimum of one night stay. Alcazaba can be accessed from any direction, but going through the north face is a technical climb. It can also be walked up from the south. There are footpath nets from the villages of Pampaneira, Bubión, Capileira and Trevélez and also from the village of Güéjar Sierra at the north side of the mountain. All the paths start an unusually long distance from the mountain. The shortest walk is about 20 km. The only sources of water are Rio Genil on the north side of the mountain, Rio Poqueira on the south west side of the Mulhacen and there are also tiny rivers on the north side of Puntal de Vacares mountain, at Prado de la Mina. Mountain huts The most used mountain hut is the Poqueira hut at 2500 m altitude, on the western flank of the Mulhacen mountain. Poqueira hut is staffed and places are limited but can be booked in advance. From there, one can continue over the Mulhacen mountain and down to Siete Lagunas, before ascending the Alcazaba. There are also a few routes leading from Laguna Mosca through the west face, but these are physically more demanding than the south face. There is a tiny stone hut on the western side of the mountain. Refugio Campinuela is located roughly in the middle of Trevelez and Alcazaba. There is also a hut at the Cueva Secreta, approached from Güéjar Sierra. Cueva Secreta is actually a long cave providing shelter for more than 20 climbers. Some climbers also prefer the north east route, using a hut near El Real or natural caves at the Prado de la Mina. From here the remains of two volcanoes can be seen. Around Alcazaba and climbing Alcazaba has a steep north face going straight down about 1000 m. There are two paths going through the face in the middle from west to east. These paths may have been used to collect water. Small rivers can be found at the Prado de la Mina. To the east side are three lakes under the name Lagunas de la Calderetas. At the wide top terrain are two peaks at the south side of the mountain. Siete Lagunas (the Seven Lakes) are located between Mulhacen and Alcazaba. During the summer months good hiking boots are needed, because of the walking distances involved and the nature of the terrain in this area. Alcazaba gets usually covered by snow at the beginning of December, therefore crampons and other winter climbing gear such as climbing axes are essential. There are plenty of challenges on this mountain as one can walk, scramble and climb on it. One of the features of these mountains are that they have the longest climbing season in Europe due to their southern latitude. Nights can become very cold, because of the freezing sea winds. There are usually some ibex to be seen.

Aimé Pelletier, writing as Bertrand Vac, developed a literary career while working for over fifty years at the Verdun General Hospital as a surgeon and, in semi-retirement, as a surgical assistant. His literary activities were initially hidden from his medical colleagues. Early life and education Pelletier was born the eighth of ten children to the local surgeon at Saint-Ambroise-de-Kildare, Quebec. The family later relocated to Joliette, Quebec. Pelletier, originally wishing to become an architect, was persuaded to become a doctor by his father. Pelletier graduated from the Laval University medical school in 1939.(Pelletier's obituary at the Union des Écrivaines et Écrivains Québecois states that he graduated from the Université de Montréal medical school, rather than the Université Laval.) Pelletier's obituary at the Union des Écrivaines et Écrivains Québecois. Career Pelletier volunteered for service during the Second World War, and was with the medical corps both during the war and until 1946. He worked in field hospitals behind the front lines in France, particularly during the Battle of Normandy, when he arrived in France as part of the Normandy Invasion.Union des Écrivaines et Écrivains Québecois, Obituary of Bertrand Vac ; www.uneq.qc.ca. Pelletier's nom de plume was developed in France. After the war, Pelletier chose to study surgery in Paris, where his colleagues preferred to call him \\"Bernard\\", rather than \\"Aimé\\". Vac was chosen as his literary surname because it represented the Hindu God of Speech. Pelletier wrote fourteen books during a sixty-year literary career, primarily with publisher Le cercle du livre de France, later known Les Éditions Pierre Tisseyre. He won the Prix du Cercle du livre de France on three occasions. Pelletier is believed to be the first Quebec writer to publish a detective novel (L'assassin dans l'hôpital, 1956).Supplement to the Oxford companion to Canadian history and literature.

Historical overview Seddon Atkinson Ltd had risen to prominence in the UK bus and coach market in the late 1960s with the Pennine 4 front-engined lightweight chassis and then the Gardner-powered Seddon Pennine RU rear-engined bus. In 1970 Leyland announced it was to cease making the Leopard PSU3/3R, which version had a Leyland manual gearbox and the 140 bhp O600H engine. All future Leopard production was to be of models with the larger O680H engine and the Pneumocyclic semi-automatic gearbox. Scottish Bus Group were by this time the only purchaser of the old variant, they stated they would not buy semi- automatic Leopards and regarding the O680H as too thirsty tried to persuade Leyland to fit the Gardner horizontal engine in the Leopard. Leyland (having had less than full value from previous SBG specials) declined. As a result, dismayed by the monopoly position British Leyland now enjoyed, by 1972 Scottish Bus Group had approached Seddon Atkinson; at the same time they were working with Ailsa, the Irvine-based Volvo truck importer, on a new type of double-deck underframe. Collaboration with SBG resulted in rapid development. After one prototype, production commenced with the first example bodied and delivered in October 1973; the last entered service after a run of 527 chassis in 1982. No replacement was produced, thus Seddon's involvement with bus manufacture ended with the Pennine 7. Chassis description The Seddon Pennine 7 featured a ladder-frame chassis with channel-section longitudinals and tubular cross-members, available to either 5.6m wheelbase for 11m bodies or (from 1975) 6m wheelbase for 12m bodies. It was horizontal in elevation but only parallel in plan over the leaf-sprung front and rear axles; the nearside member was in-swept at the front to allow a wider low-entrance area, and the offside member was outswept in the wheelbase to allow ready access to the Gardner engine and its auxiliaries. The frame did not continue aft of the rear axle-mounting, collaboration with SBG's preferred supplier Walter Alexander Coachbuilders meant there was no worry about the body builder providing a strongly cantilevered rear overhang capable of supporting a capacious luggage boot, especially after Alexander's switch back (from 1967–72) to aluminium alloy body framing. Power steering was standard. The prototype (carrying a late body by Seddon's Pennine Coachcraft subsidiary) had a Self-Changing Gears semi-automatic gearbox, but production variants were initially to be fitted with a four-speed ZF synchromesh unit, coach versions having a higher ratio final drive allowing a 76 mph maximum speed, 56 mph being the designed maximum for bus versions, better acceleration and more flexible performance ensuing with the low ratio back axle. Customers It was a chassis commissioned by Scottish Bus Group but only two of its subsidiaries bought the type. Eastern Scottish took 301 (over 57% of production) and Western SMT 213 (over 40%). Most of these were bodied by Alexander but Eastern Scottish took 64 from 1978-81 with Plaxton Supreme III or IV Express bodies, the first ever Plaxton bodies for the SBG. Buses carried the Alexander AY or AYS body and (non- Plaxton) coaches either the AY or AT (Alexander T-Type) body, coaches generally had 49 seats and buses 53, although some of Eastern's touring coaches had 45 reclining seats, generally in the rather bus-like AY body. All of SBG's 11 metre Seddons qualified for New Bus Grant. The Pennine 7 was originally envisaged just as an 11-metre bus or coach, which meant it was suitable for the UK government's New Bus Grant. In 1974, pleased with the initial batch, Eastern Scottish commissioned a longer version to carry the exclusive and luxurious Alexander M-Type coach body. At the time Anglo- Scottish express services were expanding, and whilst previously Western and Eastern Scottish were the only operators to work to London, Alexander (Fife), and Alexander (Northern) were to gain routes from respectively Kirkcaldy (Fife), Aberdeen and Dundee (Northern) to London. Orders for the new (third series) M-type coaches went to three chassis suppliers, Leyland, Seddon and Volvo, previously Western and Eastern Scottish had chosen a special version of the Bristol RE for M-type bodies but coach variants of the RE were axed earlier in 1974, the final 12-metre examples having gone to United Automobile Services earlier that year. Western Scottish chose the Volvo B58-61, built in Sweden but imported to the UK by Ailsa Bus in Western Scottish's operating area, the coaches for the Alexander companies would be Leyland Leopard PSU5/4R (with O680 engines and 5-speed Pneumocyclic transmission). Eastern Scottish chose the new version of the Pennine 7, unlike previous versions the 12-metre Pennine 7 as commissioned by Eastern Scottish had a 6-speed ZF synchromesh gearbox, top speed was alleged to be 87 mph, the same as the 256 bhp Volvos of Western with the same gearbox. As circumstances turned out Eastern Scottish initially took four Leopards in the yellow and black colours of their previous M-types for almost a year before its Seddons were completed, then passing the Leylands on to the Alexander companies. When the Seddons did arrive at the end of 1975 they introduced a new blue and white livery which became standard within SBG for services to London until the mid 1980s. This featured ¾ of a Saltire flag and the single word SCOTTISH on the side. Soon all SBG M-types were painted thus, although at the time every other bus or coach in the Scottish Bus Group ran in the individual operator's own colours contrary to the rigid corporate branding approach of their English and Welsh counterpart. With the Volvo B58, Leyland Leopard and AEC Reliance supplying the premium- coach class, and with Bus and Car of Belgium, DAF and Mercedes-Benz also offering coaches (the former with a right-hand drive version of the Trailways (USA) coach), the Pennine 7 began to attract orders from private operators, all but one with Plaxton Supreme bodies, the first 12m example went to Smith of Wigan late in 1975 with an early Supreme III C50F body. Sworder of Walkern, Hertfordshire had a 57-seater, Young of Rampton, Cambridgeshire and Scotts Greys, Darlington took two 57 seaters. Tally Ho! of Kingsbridge Devon got 53 seaters on 12m coaches, OK Motor Services were the only independent to take a Pennine 7 to bus grant specification an 11m Supreme II Express with 53 seats. The final Seddon Pennine 7 bodied was BNC334Y which carried a mildly restyled 11m Willowbrook 003 coach body seating 42 with a toilet compartment, this went to Johnson of Oldham after Pennine 7 production had ceased, the dealer who had supplied it hoped to attract orders for similar coaches on Dennis Dorchester chassis which did not ensue. The London Borough of Brent bought an 11m express-doored Plaxton Supreme example in 1980 for its school transport fleet. Other than Alexander, Plaxton and Willowbrook the only other body on a new Pennine 7 was by Pennine Coachcraft, this was the prototype, and until their 1979 deliveries (when the two SBG subsidiaries changed their minds on gearboxes) the only one with a Self-Changing Gears transmission. In late 1974 it was completed to full-PSV standards, fitted with 49 semi-coach seats and finished in National Bus Company leaf-green and white bus colours; it was licensed for the first time as UBU72N and sent to Crosville to help them to cover the remedial body and chassis work on the 100 Seddon Pennine RU owned by them, after the rebuilding work was finished it remained with Crosville and was retired after eleven years service, no further Seddons were purchased by NBC. In service A preserved 1979 Eastern Scottish Seddon Pennine 7 (SSX 602V), pictured alongside Albion Viking VK (VMP 8G) at the Scottish Vintage Bus Museum in 2013. Eastern Scottish's variants were used on bus, long- distance express services and tours, and were not generally withdrawn early. Western used its similarly but had always had a shorter-life policy for its vehicles and the first of their Pennine 7s were offered for sale at around the seven year mark, four of its early T-type coaches were converted for wheelchair access, with 24 seats and a central wheelchair lift spreading the type to Central and Midland Scottish. Central Scottish's example is at the Glasgow Vintage Vehicle Trust's Bridgeton garage where restoration has started. When new SBG subsidiaries were established in 1985 and Eastern lost its westernmost garages, Kelvin, Midland, Central, Clydeside and Lowland Scottish inherited Pennine 7s, Kelvin ridding itself of them as early as it could as it attempted standardisation. Not as well known as the Leopard, they sold less quickly on the second-hand market but operators including Stevensons of Uttoxeter and Burton and North Eastern Bus Service of Newcastle standardised on the Seddon for deregulated bus work. The last examples saw out the turn of the century with Allander, Milngavie on school contracts and with Morley, Whittlesey on rural Cambridgeshire services. Problems in operation Drivers, particularly coach drivers, felt the Pennine 7 was over-geared, starting-off smoothly from rest sometimes causing trouble, overheating was another early fault, the radiator was mounted directly in front of the engine in mid-wheelbase and was thus shrouded by the coachwork, and in common with many Gardner-engined vehicles the throttle-pedal was regarded as hard to operate. The power-steering took several modifications and adjustments to work properly. Morley's of Whittlesey found their three astonishingly economical, the high-geared one of the trio (RSD978R) averaging 21 miles per gallon, whilst the two-lower geared examples (NSJ19R & NSJ21R) still achieved 18mpg. In retrospect SBG did not fulfill Seddon's dreams. Leyland offered SBG alone a four-speed ZF manual option on Leopard which was taken between 1974 and 78 by Central, Western Scottish and the Alexander companies. Total Pennine 7 production over a decade was less than a year's Leopard production. From 1980 the six-speed ZF was offered with the Leopard on general sale but SBG were by that time taking the Pneumocyclic. Western and Central Scottish took the later and similar Dennis Dorchester, and they, Clydeside, Lowland, Northern, and Eastern Scottish took Gardner-engined variants of the Leyland Tiger, by the mid-1980s a much weakened Leyland could not refuse SBG's engine preferences.  Survivors  A number of Seddon Pennine 7s have been preserved and are stored at bus museums in Scotland. Among preserved examples one of the Eastern M types survives at the Scottish Vintage Bus Museum. MSF750P is the only Alexander M-Type bodied coach fully restored. Y-type, T-type and Plaxton- bodied examples also survive, some preserved, some in non-psv roles. Only one Pennine 7 is known to have been rebodied, former Western MSJ388P which was purchased by a Lancashire businessman in the late 1980s for conversion into a racing car transporter, the Alexander T-type body proved unsound so the businessman, Andrew Wareing, asked Duple to rebody it, they politely declined, having never bodied the type, so one of Mr Wareing's employees, aided by a friend who worked at Duple, were tasked with building a new body which features a number of Duple 320 components, this vehicle, re-registered 5887AW, has been in use as a car transporter for over 20 years. Former Western Scottish Y Type BSD 857T has been converted into a motorcaravan. On television Two former Eastern Scottish Seddon Pennine 7s featured in the BBC Scotland play Donovan Quick.

She is known for making work concerned with gender, personal narrative and the similarities that bind us together; frequently collaborating with well-known public figures.  Early life and career  Instone was born in 1975 and grew up in East Sussex. She studied English at King's College London and history of art at The Courtauld Institute of Art. She worked as an English teacher and for the advertising agencies WCRS and J. Walter Thompson before becoming an artist in 2005.  Art  Instone's work often uses shared behaviours, emotions, associations and memories – from our to-do lists, to our shoes, to memories of our grandmothers – to hold a mirror to both our individual psyches and our collective unconscious. Themes of intimacy and ritual, memory and the passing of time run through her work and she often appropriates historical stories and images. Her exhibitions are often interactive – thousands of visitors contributed to-do lists to her installation for The Pram in the Hall in 2016, whilst visitors to her magic art caravan in 2018 received readings from ‘The Grandmother’ through her Deck of Archetypes. Participant narratives are an important theme and she uses art as a mechanism for personal revelation. Instone frequently exhibits in found or non-commercial spaces from the House of Commons, to a former brothel and the banks of the River Thames. She has had solo projects with the United Nations, the British Houses of Parliament, the National Trust, the British Medical Association, No 10 Downing Street, the Royal Society of Arts and global organisations including Ernst and Young, Allen & Overy, Rothschild, Herbert Smith, Chanel and Oxfam. Instone has collaborated with numerous public figures including musicians Annie Lennox, Beverley Knight, Alison Goldfrapp and Dame Evelyn Glennie, barristers Baroness Kennedy and Cherie Blair, Secretary of State Baroness Scotland, Scientist Professor Baroness Greenfield, actresses Helen McCrory, Sadie Frost and Emilia Fox, model Elle Macpherson, human rights campaigner Bianca Jagger, artists Sir Peter Blake, Chantal Joffe and Fiona Banner, designers Bella Freud, Alice Temperley, Anya Hindmarch and Nicole Farhi, Lord Chief Justice Baron Woolf, talk show host Amanda de Cadanet, photographer Pattie Boyd, Shadow Attorney General Baroness Shami Chakrabarti, playwright Sir David Hare and producer Emma Freud amongst others.  Exhibitions = 21 21st Century Women, 2008  Instone's first solo show depicted 21 powerful contemporary women in response to the vast quantity of deliberately powerful-looking male portraits she found in the National Portrait Gallery – and the absence of female counterparts. The staggeringly few portraits that were there being wives, mothers and the occasional monarch. Instone addressed the way we consume images of women (and the narrow range of feminine archetypes on offer) and what she perceived as ‘Lady Macbeth Syndrome’, including the demonisation of powerful women in the popular press. The paintings aimed to change the way women are characterised – representing them as influential and unashamedly powerful. Sitters included Annie Lennox The House of the Fallen Woman on the official Annie Lennox Blog (who wrote an accompanying article on being a feminist), Cherie Blair, Baroness Patricia Scotland, Baroness Helena Kennedy, Professor Baroness Susan Greenfield, Fiona Bruce, Dame Evelyn Glennie, Dame Jacqueline Wilson, Anya Hindmarch and Shami Chakrabarti. Chris Hastings from The Telegraph wrote; > “They are among the most well-known women in Britain but the chances are > that you have never seen them like this before….. Alice Instone's (work) > challenges the way women are traditionally portrayed.\\" Movers and shakers > sit for artist in a study of 21st century femininity The works were exhibited at The House of Commons, The Royal Society of Arts and Ernst & Young’s headquarters.  Interview with a Shoe, 2009  Instone's second show was entitled Interview with a Shoe, Fashion meets art for stylish exhibition opening in Northampton Museum and featured a collection of portraits of people through their favourite shoes. The collaboration between the artist and the owners of the shoes revealed the wearer through the pair they chose. Instone found shoes to be extraordinarily emotive and tied up with our values. Many of the shoes came with highly emotional stories or memories (for example the shoes that Annie Lennox wore to the Las Vegas Wedding of Bob Geldof and Paula Yates). Instone also painted the mountains of discarded shoes at the Oxfam Wastesaver Depot and made a number of shoe sculptures exploring the negative messages women are bombarded with in daily life, including the constant pressure to consume and the size 0 debate. The exhibition included the shoes of Annie Lennox, Baron Woolf, Bianca Jagger, Elle Macpherson, Sir Peter Blake Nicole Farhi, Sir David Hare, Cherie Blair, Liz and Terry de Havilland, Laura Bailey, Emma Freud, Pat Cash, Alice Temperley, Joe Corre and Beverley Knight amongst others. Jennie Murray interviewed her about the exhibition for Radio 4 Woman's Hour in May 2009. BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour Interview. The works were exhibited at Northampton Museum, home to the world's largest shoe collection. > \\"We all have a favourite pair of shoes and they often reveal something about > us without us even realising… Alice has a talent for capturing something > quite functional to evoke its charm and make an emotional connection.\\" > \\\\- Elle Macpherson Lorraine as Lucretia Borgia 2010  The House of Fallen Women, 2010  In 2010, Instone's series titled The House of the Fallen Woman opened at The House of St Barnabas in Soho, a former refuge for destitute women. Portraying infamous women from history, the work played on the theme of female notoriety by again using several famous or well-known sitters, including Emilia Fox as Marie Antoinette, Annie and Lola Lennox as Elizabeth I and Helen of Troy, Cherie and Kathryn Blair as Eleanor of Acquitaine and Kathryn Swynford, Alice Temperley as Mata Hari, Emma Freud as Emma Hamilton and Caitlin Moran as Kitty Fisher. The exhibition also included a series of prints of the different words for ‘a female of loose morals’ entitled Slag Spiral, which were also exhibited in a former brothel in Archer Street, Soho. India Knight wrote in The Evening Standard: > \\"The women in these paintings paid the highest prices for their > “transgressions”. We don’t have to, and the very least we can do is raise a > glass to them in all their bad, wild, brave, magnificent glory.\\"  Because a Fire Was In My Head, 2012  Instone’s 2012 solo show explored the role of the female muse in history and art history. The title of the show is a line from a W B Yeats poem. Instone stated that the sexually charged paintings aimed to express the conviction that painting and making marks on a surface can achieve a sense of reality like no other medium. The depiction of a breastfeeding woman in the painting ‘Pax’ prompted Baroness Helena Kennedy QC to write: > \\"I love this painting. Any woman who has breastfed knows the experience of > shooting milk darts with abandon. It makes me laugh that people are so > squeamish about lactating breasts. We are happy to have women’s nakedness > draped over cars and festooning page 3 but the very function for which > breasts primarily exist so often evokes grunts of disapproval or prim > censure. Alice has captured the sensuousness of the whole business. It’s > beautiful.\\" Caitlin Moran wrote in The Times: > \\"Although all the [paintings] are stunning, my favourite reminds me of the > story of the tram crash that injured the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. Impaled > on a massive shard of metal, Kahlo came round to discover that someone on > the tram had been carrying a tin of gold paint, and she was now covered in > it. Gilded like a living human idol. A painful, disturbing and new image of > womanhood.\\" The work was exhibited The Cob Gallery in London. Tell me everything you saw and what you think it means 2017  She Should Have Known Better, 2013  In her 2012 exhibition at the former home of writer Henry James (now owned by the National Trust) Instone drew from James’ heroines and his themes of freedom, transgression and female virtue, to showcase women who broke the rules. The subjects also included contemporary women; moving from James’ Daisy Miller to pop star Hyon Song-wol, former girlfriend of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, reportedly executed by firing squad. Portraits included Helen McCrory as Lilith (Adam's wife before Eve), and a roster of women given a terrible press during their lifetimes paralleled the way women who dare to put their heads above the media parapet are punished in the press today – their appearance mocked, their morals scrutinised and their ambition imbued with sinister qualities. The Observer wrote: > \\"She is a sympathetic mixture of distrait glamour and robust feminism... > Instone is more than a portraitist. She is a casting director.\\" The yellow wallpaper 2016  The Pram in the Hall, 2016  Overwhelmed by her to-do lists after having children, Instone collected the lists of well- known women and laid them out for the public to examine. She also made large, glittering, layered prints of her personal lists – reflecting her state of mind. She then invited the public to bring their own lists and add them to a large-scale installation. Nancy Durrant, Arts Editor of The Times wrote: > \\"It’s such good snooping…. an exhibition by the artist Alice Instone offers > a peek into the day-to-day lives of Cherie Blair, Emma Freud and Shami > Chakrabarti in their own words… Yet she also thinks of them as tiny, candid > portraits, a sort of opposite to the Instagram edit of someone’s life, with > all the tedious, incidental details intact… Instone’s interest in the > imbalance of domestic work… is a continuation of the artists’s long-held > fascination with women and power.\\" Instone was subsequently featured in Jenny Eclair’s Radio 4 programme A List Free Day. The exhibition opened at 1 Cathedral Street, London in conjunction with International Women’s Day 2016. Playing cards with my grandmother, Tate Modern 2018  Playing Cards with My Grandmother, 2018  In Spring 2018, Instone represented visual arts for UN Women and created a magic art caravan that travelled round London as part of her initiative to make art more democratic. The project explored the notion that ‘what we share is more powerful than what divides us’. Taking the card games she played as a child with her grandmother as her starting point, Instone created a card deck of archetypes for the project, drawn from stories around the globe, which offered grandmotherly advice. Visitors were welcomed into a jewel-like, enchanted world to play a game of cards or experience the intimacy, ritual and catharsis of a card reading. Visitors were then invited to record the name and any memories about their grandmother in The Book of Grandmothers. The caravan was stationed outside Canary Wharf Tube in Reuters Plaza, at the top of Carnaby Street and in front of Tate Modern Bankside, overlooking the River Thames.  Instone in Hollywood  In 2015 Instone began as artist in residence at the Hollywood hotel, the Chateau Marmont. Tell Me Everything You Saw And What You Think It Means and the accompanying book, published by Pallas Athene are expected in February 2019.

The colonia's borders are marked by the following streets: Eje 1 Poniente to the south, Avenida Rio Consulado to the north, Lerdo Street and Calzada Vallejo to the east and Avenida de los Insurgentes Norte to the west. This area originally was part of the Tlatelolco dominion and functioned as communal farmland through most of the pre-Hispanic and colonial periods. Its center was the village of San Simon Tolnáhuac. Tolnáhuac comes from Nahuatl and means “in reeds.” Around 1873, some of the farmland around here began to be subdivided and this subdivision called Cuitlahuac Ferrocarrilera. This subdivision was mostly populated by railroad workers who worked at the nearby Nonoalco station. This station was located at what is now the corner of Manuel Gonzalez and Lerdo Street and belonged to the Monte Alto rail company. The main tracks were where San Simon Atlampa Street is now and at that time, divided the zone in half. By 1928, it was still the last independent village just north of the Mexico City's historic center, when it was finally incorporated. In 2008, the borough sponsored the twelfth “Rescue of the Urban Image of the Habitational Units in San Simón Tolnáhuac. The goal of the program is to maintain and repair aspects of large apartment units such as repairs of walls, courtyards, facades, railings and fences as well as maintenance work on lighting and sewer and other projects. That year, the focus was on several units on Jupiter Street. This program is a spinoff of the Rescue of the Urban Image of Green and Recreation Areas. In 2009, the borough announced the construction of a cultural center for the colonia. Schools in the colonia include the Centro de Integracion Infantil Carrusel preschool (private), Francisco Diaz Covarrubias primary school (public), Kinder las Rositas preschool (private), Mi Arco Iris preschool (private), Professor Luis de la Brina primary school (public) and the Tres Culturas primary school (private) .

There is speculation that the event was merely an expensive publicity stunt thrown by Rosmah Mansor to justify her self- styled \\"First Lady of Malaysia\\" title — technically such a title cannot exist as Malaysia is a constitutional monarchy, not a republic. Indeed, as of July 2012, there has been no further talk of hosting another summit. Participation 15 first ladies, six representatives of First Ladies and 21 ministers turned up for the event.

The first five titles were published on 12 January 1970 by Fontana Books, the paperback imprint of William Collins & Co, and the series editor was Frank Kermode who was Professor of Modern English Literature at University College London. The books were very popular with students, who 'bought them by the handful' according to Kermode,Frank Kermode. Not Entitled: A Memoir. London: HarperCollins, 1996, p.224. and they were instantly recognisable by their eye-catching covers, which featured brightly coloured abstract art and sans-serif typography.  Art as book covers  details). The Fontana Modern Masters occupy a unique place in publishing history - not for their contents but their covers, which draw on the following developments in twentieth-century art and literature:James Pardey. 'The Shape of the Century'. Eye Magazine, Winter 2009, pp.6-8.James Pardey. 'Oliver Bevan: In Search of Utopia'. RWA Magazine, Autumn 2012, pp.26-27. * Twentieth- century geometric abstraction, colour-field painting and hard-edge painting. * Op Art, and in particular the work of Victor Vasarely. * The English beatnik Brion Gysin's cut-up technique as popularized by William Burroughs. The cover concept was the brainchild of Fontana's art director John Constable, who had been experimenting with a cover treatment based on cut-ups of The Mud Bath, a key work of British geometric abstraction by the painter David Bomberg. However, a visit to the Grabowski Gallery in London introduced Constable to the work of Oliver Bevan, a graduate of the Royal College of Art in 1964, whose optical and geometric paintings were influenced by Vasarely's Op Art. On seeing Bevan's work, Constable commissioned him to create the covers for the first ten Fontana Modern Masters, which Bevan painted as rectilinear arrangements of tesselating blocks. Each cover was thus a piece of abstract art, but as an incentive for readers to buy all ten books the covers could be arranged to create a larger, composite artwork. The 'set of ten' books appeared in 1970-71 but overran when Joyce was published with the same cover as Guevara: * Camus by Conor Cruise O'Brien, 1970 * Chomsky by John Lyons, 1970 * Fanon by David Caute, 1970 * Guevara by Andrew Sinclair, 1970 * Lévi- Strauss by Edmund Leach, 1970 * Lukács by George Lichtheim, 1970 * Marcuse by Alasdair MacIntyre, 1970 * McLuhan by Jonathan Miller, 1971 * Orwell by Raymond Williams, 1971 * Wittgenstein by David Pears, 1971 * Joyce by John Gross, 1971 A second 'set of ten' featuring a new Bevan cut-up was published in 1971-73 but the inclusion of Joyce in the first 'set of ten' left this second set one book short: * Freud by Richard Wollheim, 1971 * Reich by Charles Rycroft, 1971 * Yeats by Denis Donoghue, 1971 * Gandhi by George Woodcock, 1972 * Lenin by Robert Conquest, 1972 * Mailer by Richard Poirier, 1972 * Russell by A J Ayer, 1972 * Jung by Anthony Storr, 1973 * Lawrence by Frank Kermode, 1973 A third 'set of ten' featuring Bevan's kinetic Pyramid painting began to appear in 1973-74 but Constable left before the set was complete and his replacement, Mike Dempsey, scrapped the set-of-ten incentive after eight books: * Beckett by A Alvarez, 1973 * Einstein by Jeremy Bernstein, 1973 * Laing by Edgar Z.

However, Shovlin also noticed ten forthcoming titles listed on the books' front endpapers which, for reasons unknown, had not been published: * Dostoyevsky by Harold Rosenberg * Fuller by Allan Temko * Jakobson by Thomas A Sebeok * Kipling by Lionel Trilling * Mann by Lionel Trilling * Merleau-Ponty by H P Dreyfus * Needham by George Steiner * Sherrington by Jonathan Miller * Steinberg by John Hollander * Winnicott by Masud Khan (this was published with a different author, as listed in the previous section) Shovlin then set out to paint these 'lost' titles and thus 'complete' the series. To do this he devised a 'Fontana Colour Chart' based on the covers of the published books, and a scoring system that - like his paintings - was deliberately flawed. Given these flaws, and those in Fontana's original series, the absence of any modern masters from the visual arts is notable,Jamie Shovlin. Fontana Modern Masters.

His father, Hans Jacob Terwesten or Zurwesten, was originally from Augsburg while his mother Catharina came from Berlin. They had married in The Hague in 1648, where Hans Jacob worked as a goldsmith. The marriage produced ten children, of whom three sons and two daughters survived. Augustinus was the oldest son. In his father's workshop Augustinus learned the art of engraving, goldsmithing and wax modelling. This was followed by two years of apprenticeship with the history painter Nicolaes Willingh, who became court painter to the Great Elector in Berlin in 1667. Ezaias, the middle son of the family, also worked temporarily in his father's workshop and settled later in Rome as a flower and fruit painter.Michael Lausberg, ‘’Prunkschlösser: Schloss Charlottenburg’’ Ceiling painting with putti and flowers, collaboration with Gaspar Peeter Verbruggen the Younger He initially studied under his 21 years older brother Augustin. He further received training from Willem Doudyns and Daniel Mijtens the Younger. When Augustin moved to Berlin in 1690, he finished several of the works left unfinished by his brother. He also received his own commissions. Venus and Adonis In 1695 he traveled via Berlin to Rome, where his mother and brother Augustinus were living.. He took drawing classes at the Academy of Arts in Berlin for which he received a certificate. In the spring of 1696 he travelled via Leipzig and Neurenberg to Augsburg where to his regret no family members were still living. He then continued on to Florence and Siena to arrive in Rome. Here he produced in 1697 an extensive album of drawings after Antique models. In Rome he became a member of the Bentvueghels, an association of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists working in Rome. It was customary for new members of the Bentvueghels to adopt an appealing nickname, the so-called 'bent name'. Terwesten took the nickname \\"Arend\\", \\"Arents\\" or \\"Aquila\\", meaning \\"eagle\\". He travelled to Berlin to visit his sick mother. He passed via Loreto, Bologna, Venice and Vienna. He stayed one month in Venice and met the Flemish painter Anthoni Schoonjans during his three-month stay in Vienna. He then continued on via Prague to Berlin where he resided in the years 1698/99. In June 1699 he was back in The Hague, where he worked on commissions from important public figures. He was recorded back in Berlin in April 1710 where his brothers Ezaias and Augustinus were active. When the latter died in 1711, he succeeded him as court painter in Berlin, while Ezaias went to Italy, where he married and settled permanently.Ezaias Terwesten at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He also became professor at the Academy of Berlin. He returned to The Hague in 1710. He married that same year Thedora van Rheenen with whom he had five children. Two of them, Augustinus the Younger and Pieter also became painters. His pupils were Herman Diederik Cuipers, Pieter van Cuyck (I), Jan van Gool, Johan Graham, Hendrik van Hulst, Jacob van Nachenius, Andries Storck, as well as his two sons Augustinus the Younger and Pieter. He was active in the drawing academy of The Hague throughout his professional life. He worked until old age. As late as 1751, at the age of 81, he was commissioned to decorate a courtroom and executed it. After two strokes he died in The Hague on 11 June 1757.

When one of the flower painters was without a commission, Terwesten would occasionally paint a simple background motif such as a vase with drapery or playing putti and the specialist would add the flowers and have the finished painting offered for sale. Such a work was signed, if at all, by the flower painter.

Vassilieve (; born in Uglich uyezd, Governorate of Yaroslavl, Russian Empire, died 16 October 1958 in Bayside, New York, USA) was a Russian architect who emigrated to the United States in 1923. Biography Nicholas B. Vassilieve was born on November 26 (8 December) 1875 in the village of Uglich in the Pogorelki county of the Yaroslavl province. His father, a native peasant, later became a member of the merchant class in St. Petersburg. Russia After completing his military service, Vassilieve joined the Institute of Civil Engineers in 1896. Upon graduation in 1901, he received a silver medal \\"for architectural design\\". After the Institute, he entered the Academy of Fine Arts, where he studied in the studio Leon Benois. He graduated from the Academy in 1904. Before the Revolution, he lived and worked in St. Petersburg. In 1906, he entered the Charitable Office of Empress Maria, simultaneously maintaining a private practice. Nicholas Vassilieve's primary activity was working on architectural competitions, of which he won over 90 before the Revolution. He frequently collaborated with fellow architects and former classmates. Vassilieve's outstanding creativity and imagination dominated most of his collaborative work, as his colleagues were left to finesse the plans and determine the structural engineering of the project. Among his most successful alliances was one with his friend and former classmate Alexey Bubyr. Together they designed the Apartment House at 11 Stremianaya Street (доходный дом Угрюмовых), the German theater (Немецкий театр) in Reval (Tallinn) and the Luther House (Вилла-особняк А. Лютера) also in Reval. Amongst the most visible works of Vassilieve remaining in St. Petersburg are the Mosque (Санкт-Петербургская соборная и кафедральная мечеть) on Kronverkski Prospect, 7., The New Passage («Новый Пассаж») at Liteiny Prospect, 57 and the Guards Economic Society Building (Торговый дом Гвардейского экономического общества) at Bolshaya Konyushennaya Street, 21-23. Vassilieve is considered one of the leaders of the \\"Northern Modern\\" architectural movement, that emerged in St. Petersburg around 1900, influenced both by the American architect H.H. Richardson and the Finnish master Eliel Saarinen. In 1910, Nicholas Vassilieve, keeping it with a national trend, moved towards a more \\"neo-classical\\" style. In 1918, he emigrated first to Constantinople, Turkey and then to Belgrade, Serbia before permanently emigrating to the United States in 1923, having entered and won an honorable mention prize in the 1922 Chicago Tribune Tower competition. NYC Upon arrival in the USA his name was changed to Nicholas Vassilieff at Ellis Island and in 1928 to Nicholas B. Vassilieve in his \\"Petition for Naturalization\\". In New York City, he worked for the Beaux-Arts firm of Warren & Wetmore from 1923 to 1931. Later, unemployed due to the Great Depression, he, nevertheless, continued to work on a part-time basis for Shreve, Lamb and Harmon as well as a freelancer for competitions. He entered and won a prize in the 1931 Palace of the Soviets Competition, switching formal idioms once more, now to a radical modernism influenced by Constructivism. In 1936, he joined the New York City Tunnel Authority and in 1938 joined the New York City Planning Commission, where he worked until his retirement at age 77.

Conn was married to Mary O'Donnell, a Princess of the Tirconnell dynasty. It is difficult to determine whether she was a daughter of Manus O'Donnell or his son Sir Hugh O'Donnell, as both have named Mary or Mairéad.

Cars were produced until 1947. The names The first cars were named Corre, but racing successes by a driver called Waldemar Lestienne, who came from an old family with a crest featuring a unicorn, led to the company adopting the name Corre La Licorne. Nevertheless, this was a long name for a small car, and by the 1950s, even in France, the car was generally remembered simply as the Licorne. Beginnings Business began with the production of tricycles and a single-cylinder quadricycle single-cylinder cabriolet using De Dion-Bouton components. Early sales volumes were modest. To give greater prominence to the brand, the company began to participate in competition, and racing victories achieved, in particular in 1903 by the driver Waldemar Lestienne, gave the company valuable recognition. Sales improved and were soon challenging those of longer established brands such as Renault, Peugeot and De Dion-Bouton. Early on the business was afflicted by litigation and after a trial that lasted five years the firm's founder, Jean-Marie Corre, found himself financially ruined and obliged to sell his business, in 1907, to Lestienne Firmin, a skilled financial administrator. It was at this point that the Corre name was changed to Corre-La Licorne. In 1910 the model list included three models: one with a single-cylinder engine, one with twin 1.7-liter and a third model powered by a 4-cylinder. But by eve of World War I in 1914, the range had already been broadened substantially. The 4-cylinder engines were derived from Ballot and Chapuis-Dornier units. With the outbreak of war, the business was moved to new premises in nearby Neuilly. 1918 - 1926 After the war a new model with a 1.2-liter engine was presented. This was a new version of an earlier model dating back to before the war. By the mid-1920s, the Neuilly manufacturer was offering a wider range, and the cars were joined by new commercial vehicle versions and even small buses. In rural areas Corre-La Licorne cars were valued by farmers and small businessmen for their robust simplicity and the ease with which they could be maintained, but their reliability and economy also appealed to urban consumers. By the time of the October 1924 Motor Show, the basic Corre-La Licorne passenger vehicle range extended to four mid-range cars, all with four cylinder engines, as follows: :* 1390cc (8CV) with wheelbase, listed at 20,500 francs :* 1685cc (9CV) with wheelbase, listed at 21,400 francs :* 1614cc ohc (10CV)Fiscal horsepower in France (as in Britain) was still computed according to cylinder diameter and not according to overall engine capacity. The more modern ohc engine would have needed its larger cylinder bore/diameter presumably in order to accommodate overhead valvegear. with wheelbase, listed at 26,500 francs :* 2292c (12CV) with wheelbase, listed at 38,000 francs The prices shown are for a car with a standard body already fitted. In each case the cars were offered with a standard Torpedo-style body designed to seat four or, in the case of the longer 12CV, six people. 1927 - 1939 In 1927, the factory moved again, this time to Courbevoie. The company began to buy in sub-assemblies from Citroën, as part of a dependency relationship that would be extended in the 1930s. In the same year new 5V and 6CV models were introduced. These would remain in production for a decade. 1932, saw more new model introductions in the small/medium category. The cars were focused on the lower end of the market: they were both well finished and relatively affordable, and they met with some success. By 1935, the range also included slightly larger 10CV and 11CV models. The switch to all-steel car bodies at the end of the 1920s transformed the economics of auto-production in western Europe. The heavy steel presses now needed to stamp out the body pressings were hugely expensive. Manufacturers not able to afford to buy presses could subcontract steel body production to specialists in volume car body production, notably, in France, Chausson, but prices charged by such companies were set to recover their own capital investment costs, and further issues arose from the high capital costs of the individual dies, different for each panel shape produced. At the higher end of the French auto-industry Hotchkiss, still cash rich thanks to their lucrative armaments business, simply purchased their own steel press in 1929. Other higher end automakers responded by moving ever further upmarket, providing cars, as before, in bare chassis form to be bodied by traditional “bespoke” coach-builders who still took a more artisanal approach to producing steel panels: at least through the 1930s several French luxury auto-makers were able to survive as low volume producers, dependent for their revenue on a relatively small number of rich customers willing to afford “hand built” cars. In the small and medium car sectors, larger manufacturers such as Peugeot, Renault and Citroën configured their ranges to reduce the variety of models (and different body shapes) produced, and to introduce a level of commonality between the body panels for different models. The idea was to produce a sufficient volumes to permit the capital cost of the presses and dies to be amortized over so many units that the selling prices of the individual vehicles remained attractive to customers. The 1930s was a difficult decade for the French auto-industry, during which even mighty Citroën were driven to bankruptcy, surviving only because they were rescued by their largest creditor. For manufacturers of small or mid-market cars, unable to sell steel bodied cars in the volumes needed to finance the capital cost of the presses and dies needed for stamping out the body panels, the squeeze was still more acute. Respected producers such as Unic and Berliet simply pulled out of passenger car production and reinvented themselves as producers of commercial vehicles. La Licorne, known in the 1920s for producing an unusually wide range of small and mid-market cars, but with less than a 1% share of the French auto-market by the end of the 1920s, confronted the same acute crisis in a different way, entering into a deathly alliance with Citroen. In Autumn 1936 the manufacturer rebodied their 8CV and 11CV models with a body-shell purchased from Citroen. The body in question was that designed for the Citroën 11 Légère. Six months later the Licorne 11CV and 14CV models appeared sharing the body of the Citroën 11 Normale. Six months after that, at the October 1937 Motor Show, Licorne followed the logic of this strategy by launching a version of their Types 316 and 319 badged as the “Licorne Rivoli” sharing not merely the body shells but also the engines of the equivalent Citroen models. Differences remained. The wheelbase on the Licorne car was quote at 10mm (slightly less than a half inch) shorter than that on the Citroen Traction. From the outside, the cooling slats cut into the sides of the bonnet/hood were of a more traditional design on the Licorne which also bore a traditional Licorne grille at the front. More significantly, the Licorne retained a traditional rear-wheel drive configuration while the Citroën, famously, was a pioneer of front-wheel drive. As far as published prices were concerned, The 9CV “Licorne Type LSN-316 Rivoli” was listed, at the Motor show, for 26,500 Francs while the saloon/sedan version of the 9CV “Citroën 7C” was priced at 23,800 Francs. The 11CV “Licorne Type LSN-319 Rivoli” was priced at 28,500 Francs while an equivalent (albeit front-wheel drive) 290mm wheelbase 11CV Citroën 11 Legere was listed at 23,800 Francs. The French auto-industry did not bounce back from the 1929 economic crash with the same vigour as that experienced in Germany and Britain, but in 1938, with approximately 224,000 passenger cars sold, the car market finally matched the level last reached in 1928. For the second tier automakers trying to compete for sales with the market leaders in the small and midsize automobile categories, the news was less encouraging: the 1,972 Licorne cars produced in 1928 had equated to 0.88% of the French auto-market, while the 688 Licorne cars produced in 1938 represented just 0.31% of the market total.http://www.corre- lalicorne.com/serienummers.html 1939 - 1945 During the war, production was limited to a small number of cars of a single model with electric propulsion, using a mechanism devised by Charles Mildé and Louis Kriéger who had been pioneers of electrically powered cars before the First World War. The Licorne 6/8 hp sedan on which the car was based was a conventionally sized small car, so significantly heavier than the cycle cars more usually associated with electric cars in the 1940s. Nevertheless, a range of 90 kilometres (60 miles) and a cruising speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) were quoted. A light van using the same chassis and running gear was also advertised.

After 1945 The company survived the First World War and the Great Depression, but by the end of the Second World War it was firmly on the critical list. The company was not one of the automakers included in the Pons Plan. The Pons Plan reflected government determination to structure the French auto-industry according to priorities determined by politicians and civil servants: exclusion from it created great difficulties in obtaining necessary permissions and materials. The company nevertheless took a stand at the Paris Motor Show in October 1947 and exhibited the Licorne Typ 164 LR. Derived from a pre-war car, this was a 8CV medium-sized (by the standards of that time) two-door saloon resembling a slightly more stylish version of the Renault Juvaquatre and powered by a four- cylinder 1,450 cc engine. The top speed of 90 km/h (56 mph) was considered barely adequate, even in 1947. Beside the saloon was displayed a similarly powered cabriolet model which derived from the Licorne Type 415 of 1939. The models exhibited in 1947 never entered production. In 1950 the business closed. Records indicate that between 1901 and 1949 the company produced 33,962 cars.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006 under the name Strangers Refuge Lodge Number 74, IOOF for its local significance in the themes of entertainment/recreation and social history. It was nominated for being the home of a large and important local fraternal organization, and for serving as a venue for a wide range of other groups and events. The building now houses the New Richland Public Library. History The New Richland IOOF chapter organized as Strangers Refuge Lodge Number 74 in 1880, two years before any other fraternal organization or church was established in the community. They met in a wood-frame building that had been constructed in 1878 before they commissioned the existing hall shortly after the turn of the 20th century. Membership in fraternal societies like the Odd Fellows was the primary source for insurance and welfare benefits in the United States before the 1930s. Many, including Lodge Number 74, provided money and support to sick members as well as death benefits to their widows or orphans. Moreover, they were an important social outlet in small communities. By 1925 membership in Lodge Number 74 had grown from an initial 18 men to 75. Money for these benefits came from membership dues but also from rental fees. The New Richland Odd Fellows Hall was built as an event venue, and was often referred to as the New Richland Opera House. Balls, dances, plays, music performances, high school graduations, and many other events were held there. Church groups and other fraternal organizations rented the hall for their meetings. The hall's days as a major event venue ended in 1918 when part of the building was rented out as a storefront. In 1924 the entire first floor was converted to a general store run by Lebanese immigrant Attalla Abraham. Groups continued to use the second floor for meetings, however. Strangers Refuge Lodge Number 74 continued to meet there until it folded in 1979. The ground floor business stayed in the Abraham family until 1986. The building came under city ownership and shortly after 2006 was renovated into New Richland's public library.

Founded in 1936 by the theatrical theorist, critic, and writer Silvio D'Amico, the academy is the only state school for the training of actors and directors. Funded jointly by the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) and the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, the Academy grants academic degrees equivalent to Bachelor of Arts as well as master's degrees. Its value comes from being the only school in Italy to be recognized by the Prime Minister / Department of Performing Arts and the Ministry of University and Scientific and Technological Research. History In 1936, the academy replaced the former Director Acting school dedicated to Eleonora Duse. D'Amico, a friend of Nobel prize winner Luigi Pirandello and French theatre director Jacques Copeau, was appointed Special Commissioner for the reform of the drama school and led the academy for many years. Since its early foundation, the Academy has distinguished itself as a national reference center for traditional theatrical heritage, as well as through experimentation and research. With the advent of arts and music reform, the Academy became part of the sector level Higher Education in Art and Music (AFAM), established by Law No. 508 of 21 December 1999. Admission Admission to the Academy is determined annually by a public competition announced by the Ministry of Education. The competition is open to Italians and foreigners who have successfully completed high school, and are between the ages of 18 and 25 years. Those who are admitted into the academy must attend it in order to access not only to the teaching program, but also entertainment, experimentation, and seminars carried out before the term starts, from July to September. Academic program The academic year begins in November and ends in June. The coursework is intensive, requiring motivation and commitment. It includes lessons, exercises and testing, ten hours per day, six days a week. The two main courses, directing and acting, have common material such as the interpretation of dramatic text using theoretical, critical, technical and artistic material. The prestige of the Academy includes the participation of important figures in the dramatic arts, who contribute in the lesson program, or in seminars, special courses and meetings. This allows the students of theater and film to make comparison between the teaching and professional work. Academic activities are presented to the public with the production of approximately eight events per year, made with the students, supported by professionals and directed by renowned professionals, including technical staff such as set designers, costume designers, and lighting designers. The Academy provides training in dramatic theater, the opera and the Italian cinema. The program is structured in three stages. After completing the three- year program, students are granted a diploma equivalent to a university degree. Those who complete the first three years and move on to the fourth may be granted a scholarship, the additional year being used for specialization training. Special events Some of the special events, such as the college summer theater that began in 1983 in collaboration with the Fondazione Teatro di Pisa, have last over the years and are considered important points of reference. In recent years, the Academy has developed a strong policy of international relations, participating in many festivals and establishing relations and joint projects with other important European schools such as the Russian Academy of Theatre Arts (GITIS) in Moscow, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, the Institut del Teatre in Barcelona, the Berlin University of the Arts, and the École nationale supérieure des arts et techniques du théâtre (ENSATT) in Lyon. The Academy regularly performs on tour in Europe and other continents. Notable alumni Specializing in the field of drama, with particular attention to the drama of its national heritage, the Academy has played a key role in the Italian film and theater scene and is currently headed by M°Lorenzo Salveti. It has prepared artists such as Margherita Buy, Vittorio Gassman, Luigi Lo Cascio, Anna Magnani, Nino Manfredi, and Monica Vitti. Other former alumni include Antoniano, Manuela Arcuri, Mino Bellei, Carmelo Bene, Dirk van den Berg, Giuliana Berlinguer, Alessio Boni, Alberto Bonucci, Giulio Bosetti, Renato De Carmine, Ennio Fantastichini, Gabriele Ferzetti (expelled), Scilla Gabel, Domiziana Giordano, Roberto Pacini, Michele Placido, Luca Ronconi, Gian Maria Volonté and Lina Wertmüller.

The theoretical studies are of practical use because they predict the fundamental limits of a solar cell, and give guidance on the phenomena that contribute to losses and solar cell efficiency. Band diagram of a solar cell, corresponding to very low current (horizontal Fermi level), very low voltage (metal valence bands at same height), and therefore very low illumination Working explanation # Photons in sunlight hit the solar panel and are absorbed by semi-conducting materials. # Electrons (negatively charged) are knocked loose from their atoms as they are excited. Due to their special structure and the materials in solar cells, the electrons are only allowed to move in a single direction. The electronic structure of the materials is very important for the process to work, and often silicon incorporating small amounts of boron or phosphorus is used in different layers. # An array of solar cells converts solar energy into a usable amount of direct current (DC) electricity. Photogeneration of charge carriers When a photon hits a piece of silicon, one of three things can happen: # The photon can pass straight through the silicon — this (generally) happens for lower energy photons. # The photon can reflect off the surface. # The photon can be absorbed by the silicon if the photon energy is higher than the silicon band gap value. This generates an electron-hole pair and sometimes heat depending on the band structure. Band diagram of a silicon solar cell, corresponding to very low current (horizontal Fermi level), very low voltage (metal valence bands at same height), and therefore very low illumination When a photon is absorbed, its energy is given to an electron in the crystal lattice. Usually this electron is in the valence band. The energy given to the electron by the photon \\"excites\\" it into the conduction band where it is free to move around within the semiconductor. The network of covalent bonds that the electron was previously a part of now has one fewer electron. This is known as a hole. The presence of a missing covalent bond allows the bonded electrons of neighboring atoms to move into the \\"hole,\\" leaving another hole behind, thus propagating holes throughout the lattice. It can be said that photons absorbed in the semiconductor create electron-hole pairs. A photon only needs to have energy greater than that of the band gap in order to excite an electron from the valence band into the conduction band. However, the solar frequency spectrum approximates a black body spectrum at about 5,800 K,NASA Solar System Exploration - Sun: Facts & Figures retrieved 27 April 2011 \\"Effective Temperature ... 5777 K\\" and as such, much of the solar radiation reaching the Earth is composed of photons with energies greater than the band gap of silicon. These higher energy photons will be absorbed by the solar cell, but the difference in energy between these photons and the silicon band gap is converted into heat (via lattice vibrations — called phonons) rather than into usable electrical energy. The photovoltaic effect can also occur when two photons are absorbed simultaneously in a process called two-photon photovoltaic effect. However, high optical intensities are required for this nonlinear process. The p-n junction The most commonly known solar cell is configured as a large-area p-n junction made from silicon. As a simplification, one can imagine bringing a layer of n-type silicon into direct contact with a layer of p-type silicon. In practice, p-n junctions of silicon solar cells are not made in this way, but rather by diffusing an n-type dopant into one side of a p-type wafer (or vice versa). If a piece of p-type silicon is placed in close contact with a piece of n-type silicon, then a diffusion of electrons occurs from the region of high electron concentration (the n-type side of the junction) into the region of low electron concentration (p-type side of the junction). When the electrons diffuse across the p-n junction, they recombine with holes on the p-type side. However (in the absence of an external circuit) this diffusion of carriers does not go on indefinitely because charges build up on either side of the junction and create an electric field. The electric field promotes charge flow, known as drift current, that opposes and eventually balances out the diffusion of electrons and holes. This region where electrons and holes have diffused across the junction is called the depletion region because it contains practically no mobile charge carriers. It is also known as the space charge region, although space charge extends a bit further in both directions than the depletion region. Charge carrier separation There are two causes of charge carrier motion and separation in a solar cell: #drift of carriers, driven by the electric field, with electrons being pushed one way and holes the other way #diffusion of carriers from zones of higher carrier concentration to zones of lower carrier concentration (following a gradient of chemical potential). These two \\"forces\\" may work one against the other at any given point in the cell. For instance, an electron moving through the junction from the p region to the n region (as in the diagram at the beginning of this article) is being pushed by the electric field against the concentration gradient. The same goes for a hole moving in the opposite direction. It is easiest to understand how a current is generated when considering electron-hole pairs that are created in the depletion zone, which is where there is a strong electric field. The electron is pushed by this field toward the n side and the hole toward the p side. (This is opposite to the direction of current in a forward-biased diode, such as a light-emitting diode in operation.) When the pair is created outside the space charge zone, where the electric field is smaller, diffusion also acts to move the carriers, but the junction still plays a role by sweeping any electrons that reach it from the p side to the n side, and by sweeping any holes that reach it from the n side to the p side, thereby creating a concentration gradient outside the space charge zone. In thick solar cells there is very little electric field in the active region outside the space charge zone, so the dominant mode of charge carrier separation is diffusion. In these cells the diffusion length of minority carriers (the length that photo-generated carriers can travel before they recombine) must be large compared to the cell thickness. In thin film cells (such as amorphous silicon), the diffusion length of minority carriers is usually very short due to the existence of defects, and the dominant charge separation is therefore drift, driven by the electrostatic field of the junction, which extends to the whole thickness of the cell. . Once the minority carrier enters the drift region, it is 'swept' across the junction and, at the other side of the junction, becomes a majority carrier. This reverse current is a generation current, fed both thermally and (if present) by the absorption of light. On the other hand, majority carriers are driven into the drift region by diffusion (resulting from the concentration gradient), which leads to the forward current; only the majority carriers with the highest energies (in the so-called Boltzmann tail; cf. Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics) can fully cross the drift region. Therefore, the carrier distribution in the whole device is governed by a dynamic equilibrium between reverse current and forward current. Connection to an external load Ohmic metal-semiconductor contacts are made to both the n-type and p-type sides of the solar cell, and the electrodes connected to an external load. Electrons that are created on the n-type side, or created on the p-type side, \\"collected\\" by the junction and swept onto the n-type side, may travel through the wire, power the load, and continue through the wire until they reach the p-type semiconductor-metal contact. Here, they recombine with a hole that was either created as an electron-hole pair on the p-type side of the solar cell, or a hole that was swept across the junction from the n-type side after being created there. The voltage measured is equal to the difference in the quasi Fermi levels of the majority carriers (electrons in the n-type portion and holes in the p-type portion) at the two terminals. Equivalent circuit of a solar cell The equivalent circuit of a solar cell The schematic symbol of a solar cell To understand the electronic behavior of a solar cell, it is useful to create a model which is electrically equivalent, and is based on discrete ideal electrical components whose behavior is well defined. An ideal solar cell may be modelled by a current source in parallel with a diode; in practice no solar cell is ideal, so a shunt resistance and a series resistance component are added to the model. The resulting equivalent circuit of a solar cell is shown on the left. Also shown, on the right, is the schematic representation of a solar cell for use in circuit diagrams. Characteristic equation From the equivalent circuit it is evident that the current produced by the solar cell is equal to that produced by the current source, minus that which flows through the diode, minus that which flows through the shunt resistor: :I = I_{L} - I_{D} - I_{SH} where *I = output current (ampere) *IL = photogenerated current (ampere) *ID = diode current (ampere) *ISH = shunt current (ampere). The current through these elements is governed by the voltage across them: :V_{j} = V + I R_{S} where *Vj = voltage across both diode and resistor RSH (volt) *V = voltage across the output terminals (volt) *I = output current (ampere) *RS = series resistance (Ω). By the Shockley diode equation, the current diverted through the diode is: :I_{D} = I_{0} \\\\left{\\\\exp\\\\left[\\\\frac{V_{j}}{nV_T}\\\\right] - 1\\\\right}exp represents the exponential function where *I0 = reverse saturation current (ampere) *n = diode ideality factor (1 for an ideal diode) *q = elementary charge *k = Boltzmann's constant *T = absolute temperature *V_T=kT/q, the thermal voltage. At 25 °C, V_T\\\\approx 0.0259 volt. By Ohm's law, the current diverted through the shunt resistor is: :I_{SH} = \\\\frac{V_{j}}{R_{SH}} where *RSH = shunt resistance (Ω). Substituting these into the first equation produces the characteristic equation of a solar cell, which relates solar cell parameters to the output current and voltage: :I = I_{L} - I_{0} \\\\left{\\\\exp\\\\left[\\\\frac{V + I R_{S}}{nV_T}\\\\right] - 1\\\\right} - \\\\frac{V + I R_{S}}{R_{SH}}. An alternative derivation produces an equation similar in appearance, but with V on the left-hand side. The two alternatives are identities; that is, they yield precisely the same results. Since the parameters I0, n, RS, and RSH cannot be measured directly, the most common application of the characteristic equation is nonlinear regression to extract the values of these parameters on the basis of their combined effect on solar cell behavior. When RS is not zero, the above equation does not give the current I directly, but it can then be solved using the Lambert W function: :I=\\\\frac{(I_L+I_0)-V/R_{SH}}{1+R_S/R_{SH}}-\\\\frac{nV_T}{R_S}W\\\\left(\\\\frac{I_0R_S}{nV_T(1+R_S/R_{SH})}\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac V{nV_T}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{R_S}{R_S+R_{SH}}\\\\right)+\\\\frac{(I_L+I_0)R_S}{nV_T(1+R_S/R_{SH})}\\\\right)\\\\right) When an external load is used with the cell, its resistance can simply be added to RS and V set to zero in order to find the current. When RSH is infinite there is a solution for V for any I less than I_L+I_0: :V=nV_T\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{I_L-I}{I_0}+1\\\\right)-IR_S. Otherwise one can solve for V using the Lambert W function: :V=(I_L+I_0)R_{SH}-I(R_S+R_{SH})-nV_TW\\\\left(\\\\frac{I_0R_{SH}}{nV_T}\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{(I_L+I_0-I)R_{SH}}{nV_T}\\\\right)\\\\right) However, when RSH is large it's better to solve the original equation numerically. The general form of the solution is a curve with I decreasing as V increases (see graphs lower down). The slope at small or negative V (where the W function is near zero) approaches -1/(R_S+R_{SH}), whereas the slope at high V approaches -1/R_S. =Open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current= When the cell is operated at open circuit, I = 0 and the voltage across the output terminals is defined as the open-circuit voltage. Assuming the shunt resistance is high enough to neglect the final term of the characteristic equation, the open-circuit voltage VOC is: :V_{OC} \\\\approx \\\\frac{nkT}{q} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{I_L}{I_0} + 1\\\\right). Similarly, when the cell is operated at short circuit, V = 0 and the current I through the terminals is defined as the short-circuit current. It can be shown that for a high-quality solar cell (low RS and I0, and high RSH) the short-circuit current ISC is: :I_{SC} \\\\approx I_L. It is not possible to extract any power from the device when operating at either open circuit or short circuit conditions. =Effect of physical size= The values of IL, I0, RS, and RSH are dependent upon the physical size of the solar cell. In comparing otherwise identical cells, a cell with twice the junction area of another will, in principle, have double the IL and I0 because it has twice the area where photocurrent is generated and across which diode current can flow. By the same argument, it will also have half the RS of the series resistance related to vertical current flow; however, for large-area silicon solar cells, the scaling of the series resistance encountered by lateral current flow is not easily predictable since it will depend crucially on the grid design (it is not clear what \\"otherwise identical\\" means in this respect). Depending on the shunt type, the larger cell may also have half the RSH because it has twice the area where shunts may occur; on the other hand, if shunts occur mainly at the perimeter, then RSH will decrease according to the change in circumference, not area. Since the changes in the currents are the dominating ones and are balancing each other, the open-circuit voltage is practically the same; VOC starts to depend on the cell size only if RSH becomes too low. To account for the dominance of the currents, the characteristic equation is frequently written in terms of current density, or current produced per unit cell area: :J = J_{L} - J_{0} \\\\left{\\\\exp\\\\left[\\\\frac{q(V + J r_{S})}{nkT}\\\\right] - 1\\\\right} - \\\\frac{V + J r_{S}}{r_{SH}} where *J = current density (ampere/cm2) *JL = photogenerated current density (ampere/cm2) *J0 = reverse saturation current density (ampere/cm2) *rS = specific series resistance (Ω-cm2) *rSH = specific shunt resistance (Ω-cm2). This formulation has several advantages. One is that since cell characteristics are referenced to a common cross-sectional area they may be compared for cells of different physical dimensions. While this is of limited benefit in a manufacturing setting, where all cells tend to be the same size, it is useful in research and in comparing cells between manufacturers. Another advantage is that the density equation naturally scales the parameter values to similar orders of magnitude, which can make numerical extraction of them simpler and more accurate even with naive solution methods. There are practical limitations of this formulation. For instance, certain parasitic effects grow in importance as cell sizes shrink and can affect the extracted parameter values. Recombination and contamination of the junction tend to be greatest at the perimeter of the cell, so very small cells may exhibit higher values of J0 or lower values of RSH than larger cells that are otherwise identical. In such cases, comparisons between cells must be made cautiously and with these effects in mind. This approach should only be used for comparing solar cells with comparable layout. For instance, a comparison between primarily quadratical solar cells like typical crystalline silicon solar cells and narrow but long solar cells like typical thin film solar cells can lead to wrong assumptions caused by the different kinds of current paths and therefore the influence of, for instance, a distributed series resistance contribution to rS.A.G.

Macro-architecture of the solar cells could result in different surface areas being placed in any fixed volume - particularly for thin film solar cells and flexible solar cells which may allow for highly convoluted folded structures. If volume is the binding constraint, then efficiency density based on surface area may be of less relevance. =Transparent conducting electrodes= thumbSchematic of charge collection by solar cell electrodes. Light transmits through transparent conducting electrode creating electron hole pairs, which are collected by both the electrodes. Transparent conducting electrodes are essential components of solar cells. It is either a continuous film of indium tin oxide or a conducting wire network, in which wires are charge collectors while voids between wires are transparent for light. An optimum density of wire network is essential for the maximum solar cell performance as higher wire density blocks the light transmittance while lower wire density leads to high recombination losses due to more distance traveled by the charge carriers. =Cell temperature= Effect of temperature on the current- voltage characteristics of a solar cell Temperature affects the characteristic equation in two ways: directly, via T in the exponential term, and indirectly via its effect on I0 (strictly speaking, temperature affects all of the terms, but these two far more significantly than the others). While increasing T reduces the magnitude of the exponent in the characteristic equation, the value of I0 increases exponentially with T. The net effect is to reduce VOC (the open-circuit voltage) linearly with increasing temperature. The magnitude of this reduction is inversely proportional to VOC; that is, cells with higher values of VOC suffer smaller reductions in voltage with increasing temperature. For most crystalline silicon solar cells the change in VOC with temperature is about -0.50%/°C, though the rate for the highest-efficiency crystalline silicon cells is around -0.35%/°C. By way of comparison, the rate for amorphous silicon solar cells is -0.20%/°C to -0.30%/°C, depending on how the cell is made. The amount of photogenerated current IL increases slightly with increasing temperature because of an increase in the number of thermally generated carriers in the cell. This effect is slight, however: about 0.065%/°C for crystalline silicon cells and 0.09% for amorphous silicon cells. The overall effect of temperature on cell efficiency can be computed using these factors in combination with the characteristic equation. However, since the change in voltage is much stronger than the change in current, the overall effect on efficiency tends to be similar to that on voltage. Most crystalline silicon solar cells decline in efficiency by 0.50%/°C and most amorphous cells decline by 0.15-0.25%/°C. The figure above shows I-V curves that might typically be seen for a crystalline silicon solar cell at various temperatures. =Series resistance= Effect of series resistance on the current-voltage characteristics of a solar cell As series resistance increases, the voltage drop between the junction voltage and the terminal voltage becomes greater for the same current. The result is that the current- controlled portion of the I-V curve begins to sag toward the origin, producing a significant decrease in the terminal voltage V and a slight reduction in ISC, the short-circuit current. Very high values of RS will also produce a significant reduction in ISC; in these regimes, series resistance dominates and the behavior of the solar cell resembles that of a resistor. These effects are shown for crystalline silicon solar cells in the I-V curves displayed in the figure to the right. Losses caused by series resistance are in a first approximation given by Ploss=VRsI=I2RS and increase quadratically with (photo-)current. Series resistance losses are therefore most important at high illumination intensities. =Shunt resistance= Effect of shunt resistance on the current–voltage characteristics of a solar cell As shunt resistance decreases, the current diverted through the shunt resistor increases for a given level of junction voltage. The result is that the voltage-controlled portion of the I-V curve begins to sag far from the origin, producing a significant decrease in the terminal current I and a slight reduction in VOC. Very low values of RSH will produce a significant reduction in VOC. Much as in the case of a high series resistance, a badly shunted solar cell will take on operating characteristics similar to those of a resistor. These effects are shown for crystalline silicon solar cells in the I-V curves displayed in the figure to the right. =Reverse saturation current= Effect of reverse saturation current on the current-voltage characteristics of a solar cell If one assumes infinite shunt resistance, the characteristic equation can be solved for VOC: :V_{OC} = \\\\frac{kT}{q} \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{I_{SC}}{I_{0}} + 1\\\\right). Thus, an increase in I0 produces a reduction in VOC proportional to the inverse of the logarithm of the increase. This explains mathematically the reason for the reduction in VOC that accompanies increases in temperature described above. The effect of reverse saturation current on the I-V curve of a crystalline silicon solar cell are shown in the figure to the right. Physically, reverse saturation current is a measure of the \\"leakage\\" of carriers across the p-n junction in reverse bias. This leakage is a result of carrier recombination in the neutral regions on either side of the junction. =Ideality factor= Effect of ideality factor on the current-voltage characteristics of a solar cell The ideality factor (also called the emissivity factor) is a fitting parameter that describes how closely the diode's behavior matches that predicted by theory, which assumes the p-n junction of the diode is an infinite plane and no recombination occurs within the space-charge region. A perfect match to theory is indicated when n = 1. When recombination in the space-charge region dominate other recombination, however, n = 2. The effect of changing ideality factor independently of all other parameters is shown for a crystalline silicon solar cell in the I-V curves displayed in the figure to the right. Most solar cells, which are quite large compared to conventional diodes, well approximate an infinite plane and will usually exhibit near-ideal behavior under Standard Test Condition (n ≈ 1). Under certain operating conditions, however, device operation may be dominated by recombination in the space-charge region. This is characterized by a significant increase in I0 as well as an increase in ideality factor to n ≈ 2. The latter tends to increase solar cell output voltage while the former acts to erode it. The net effect, therefore, is a combination of the increase in voltage shown for increasing n in the figure to the right and the decrease in voltage shown for increasing I0 in the figure above. Typically, I0 is the more significant factor and the result is a reduction in voltage. Sometimes, the ideality factor is observed to be greater than 2, which is generally attributed to the presence of Schottky diode or heterojunction in the solar cell. The presence of a heterojunction offset reduces the collection efficiency of the solar cell and may contribute to low fill-factor.

Motorized vehicles are not allowed on the trails, and night time exploring of the trails is not advised. From 1896-1898 Poplar Grove graveyard moved to the present site, (Innisfail Memorial Cemetery), the excavation and relocation of sites took two years to complete. Wes Browning murder Several unmarked graves were never located, the approximate number is between 7-16 graves. Some of the relatives have expressed their wishes to not disturb the grounds further, and to leave those unmarked sites as is. It is believed the archway pictured is the entrance to the burial grounds. Unexplained to this day is how and why the natural growth of the forest into the arch way. Also unexplained is how the branches on the arch reach towards the heavens and not towards the ground where the unmarked graves lay. Legend has it the bludgeoned body of the orphaned 15-year-old, brutally murdered in the 19th century, lay in one of those unmarked graves. The boy is believed to be Wes Browning whose parents died when he was 5 years old. He then spent the rest of his days living in the basement of the St. Marks church. His murderer was never apprehended. In 1945, another attempt to locate unmarked gravesites was funded by an anonymous donor. Two gravesites were located and relocated to the new site. No other graves were found, and no other attempt has been made to locate and relocate those graves. Town council, in 1957 deemed Napoleon Trails as a protected and sacred area. In the summer of 2006 an old building was discovered just off the trails with its roof in pieces from being smashed open by a tree. There was several blood stains on the floors and walls this was believed to be the site of Wes Browning's old home where his parents may have been murdered, the roof being smashed open was decided not be the cause of any \\"murders\\" in the home due to the age of the tree, the site was later demolished in 2009 to make way for a new highway into the town.

He is the founder of Bahrain Online, a popular online forum and pro-democracy news website, and a member of the research and advocacy group Bahrain Watch.Bahrain Watch 'About Us' page, accessed 13 May 2014 Although he went into hiding in March 2011 to escape the Bahraini Government's crackdown on protesters, he was convicted in absentia for plotting to overthrow the Government, and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Global human rights organizations are unconvinced of Abdulemam's guilt and have voiced opposition to the persistent censorship and obstruction of journalists in the region. In 2013, Abdulemam escaped to the UK where he was swiftly granted political asylum. Life=Bahrain Online Abdulemam started Bahrain Online as an anonymous blog in 1998, but revealed his identity later in 2002. The site rapidly became one of Bahrain's most popular and featured contributions to forums from members of the Bahraini opposition. In late 2002, the government of Bahrain ordered the national internet service provider, Batelco, to block access to the site, which was hosted in the US. Contributors and readers were able to access the site by using censorship circumvention tools. In February 2005, Bahraini authorities raided Abdulemam's home in Jidhafs while Abdulemam was at work. When he learned of the raid, Abdulemam turned himself into authorities to face charges of \\"inciting hatred of the government\\". He and his web team were released after 15 days in custody. 2010 arrest and torture In August 2010, Abdulemam was arrested by Bahraini authorities, accused of \\"spreading false information\\". He was imprisoned from September 4, 2010 until late February 2011. Reporters Without Borders reports that he was denied a lawyer and fired from his work at Gulf Air. His arrest has led to protests from human rights groups across the Arab world. The government of Bahrain accused him in statement released by the state-run Bahrain News Agency of trying to subvert the regime. and he was charged with \\"spreading false information\\" After his release, Abdulemam spoke to Al Jazeera about torture he experienced while in government custody. 2011 disappearance and sentencing in absentia Three weeks after his release from custody on February 23, 2011, Abdulemam went missing. He and 20 other prominent Bahraini opposition figures were tried in front of a military court in June 2011, accused of plotting a coup against the Bahraini government. Abdulemam was sentenced to 15 years in prison, in absentia. Escape from Bahrain On May 10, 2013, it emerged that Abdulemam had escaped from Bahrain. He had gone into hiding shortly after the start of the Government's crackdown on protesters in March 2011 to avoid arrest. Activists, consulting with a member of Denmark's Jaeger Corps hatched a plan to get Abdulemam out of the country. The plan was to have American artist Tyler Ramsey visit Bahrain with an entourage including Elizabeth Chambers and two Abdulemam doppelgangers. Abdulemam was to switch places with a member of Ramsey's entourage in a fast food restaurant at the airport. Ramsey and his entourage would then depart for Cyprus on a chartered jet from a special VIP area at Bahrain Airport, where they would not be subject to security checks or interviews. However, before the plan could be set into motion, Abdulemam escaped Bahrain via the causeway to Saudi Arabia in a car with a hidden compartment. From Saudi Arabia, he traveled by land and sea through Kuwait and Iraq, before departing on flight to London. He was granted asylum in the UK shortly after his arrival.

The church is situated in Leamonsley in the south west area of the city. The church is of Anglican denomination and serves a parish made up of Leamonsley, Sandfields and Lower Sandford Street areas of the city. The church is a fine example of the decorated gothic revival style seen in ecclesiastical architecture during the 19th century. The church is a Grade II* listed building and the Hinckley family tombs at the rear of the church are Grade II listed monuments. On the ceiling of the chancel are some unique pre-raphaelite canvas panels painted by John D. Batten. History The church as built by Johnson Building work on Christ Church began in 1844 and was completed in 1847 when the church was consecrated. The church would be the first new parish church in Lichfield since medieval times. The growing population in the west of the city brought the need to build a new church to serve the community in that area. The ¾ acre site was given in 1844 by Richard Hinckley the owner of Beacon House and its surrounding estate grounds. The site of the church would be approximately 500m south of Beacon House at the edge of the estate grounds and visible to the Hinckley’s from their home. The cost of building the church was provided by Ellen Jane Hinckley, the wife of Richard Hinckley. The church was built with local red sandstone in a decorated gothic revival style under the design of Thomas Johnson of Lichfield. When the church was completed in 1847 in consisted of a chancel, nave and west tower containing a bell cast in 1845 by C. G. Mears of London. In 1887 the church was enlarged to the designs of Matthew Holding of Northampton. North and south transepts and bays were added. The north extension consisted of a Lady Chapel and the south extension provided the church with an organ chamber and choir vestry. These extensions were partly funded by S.L. Seckham (the new owner of Beacon House) and partly by public subscription. The churchyard was enlarged in 1895 and 1929.

These processes include the growth of oxide layers on silicon wafers for the semiconductor industry, originally described by the Deal-Grove model, and for the formation of passivation layers used to improve the light capture ability of crystalline photovoltaic cells. Several methods and technologies can be employed to generate ultra high purity steam, including pyrolysis, bubbling, direct liquid injection and purified steam generation. The level of purity, or the relative lack of contamination, affects the quality of the oxide layer or annealed surface. The method of delivery affects growth rate, uniformity and electrical performance. Oxidation and annealing are common steps in the manufacture of such devices as microelectronics and solar cells. Characteristics In simplest terms, steam is the gaseous state of water where the majority of the gas pressure is created by water molecules. This differs from humidified gas where water vapor is a minor component of the gas mixture. Ideally, steam is 100% H2O molecules. In reality, steam may also contains other molecules such as metals, urea, volatiles, chlorine, particles, microdroplets, and organics. To be considered ultra high purity, steam must not have contaminants above a certain limit. Typical values for semiconductor are at part per billion (ppb) for any specific contaminant by volume. This is an arbitrary definition and is frequently set by the user. Impurities in water are entrained into the steam as it is generated and more may migrate into the steam from process piping materials as it is conducted to the process. These impurities or contaminants can be quite harmful when the steam is an ingredient in industrial manufacturing processes. As microelectronic device size and geometry shrink, the susceptibility to damage from contaminants grows. This requires intervention through the use of filters, selective membranes or other techniques to clean the water or steam before delivery to process. * Metals: Metals can be in the source water or gases and can migrate into the steam from components in the steam generation and delivery path. Metallic systems corrode and impart metallic ions. Stainless steel, for example, can slough off molecules into the steam path. Limiting or eliminating metals from the water, gas and steam delivery paths reduce the risk of metallic contamination but do not affect the presence of metals in the source water and gas. Metal ions degrade electrical performance in semiconductors and metal ions in solar cells can be recombination centers that reduce the efficiency of the photovoltaic device. * Urea: Fertilizers, auto emissions, and human and animal sources contribute to the presence of urea and ammonia. Normally stable at room temperature, Urea has a high conversion rate to Ammonia when boiled. This contaminant is difficult to control, varies with the water supply and has large seasonal fluctuations. Urea is not easily rejected by reverse osmosis membranes. It is non-polar, so not removed by de-ionized water processes, and chemically stable so not easily destroyed by UV sterilization processes.Holmes, R., Spiegelman, J. \\"Urea and Ammonia Removal from De-Ionized Water via Steam Purification\\". Technical White Paper. 2008. Controlling Ammonia levels makes the difference between conformity and uncontrolled variation. For example, \\"T-Topping\\" in lithography is a real danger, resulting from chemically amplified resists. Other structural defects caused by ammonia include incorrectly imprinted line width and short circuits, and ammonia can also deposit on optical surfaces, causing equipment downtime. Residual urea on the wafer surface can react when wafers are processed at higher temperatures leading to the injection of nitrogen atoms into the layer being grown. * Silica: Colloidal silica is typically found in surface waters and has created problems for water treatment because of its stability as an un-ionized compound, making it difficult to remove using ion exchange processes. Particle size is often 1 to 5 nm, but can form chains if concentrations increase. Silica is at the lower end of selectivity for anion resins, creating a scenario where silica breakthrough is one of the first to occur. As a result, silica can be effectively removed only if the ion exchange resins are completely and properly regenerated. * Oxygen: If oxygen makes up part of the process recipe during wet oxidation, it will reduce the water vapor partial pressure, slowing the overall growth rate. Because the oxidation rate of silicon with oxygen molecules to water molecules is almost ten times slower, variability in the oxygen to water vapor pressure can lead to process variability. This is frequently a problem when the operating pressure is kept at ambient pressure. Water vapor pressure is a function of the temperature of the water source while the overall process pressure is a function of atmosphere. As the atmosphere varies the oxygen pressure will increase or decrease relative to the water vapor pressure, leading to changes in the overall oxidation growth rate of the film. * Microdroplets: Water vapor with entrained water microdroplets can cause deformities or irregularities in wafers as the water settles on hot surfaces. Microdroplets are the result of incomplete vaporization of the water source. This is common with boiling and vaporizers where it is difficult to get sufficient heat into the boiling liquid. These microdroplets can cause contamination and problems in uniformity. The boiling action of water creates microdroplets, which act as liquid capsules that entrain particles and molecular contaminants such as ions, organics, and pyrogens. Microdroplets are known to carry particulate and ionic impurities that cannot be carried by pure vapor alone. Furthermore, cold spots occur where microdroplets land leading to non-uniformity and warpage. In order for oxide films to work properly, the film thickness and uniformity are critical.Buomsellek, S., Spiegelman, J. \\"Water Vapor Delivery For Cigse And Other Thin Film Vacuum Processes\\". 35th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference, June, 2010. The role of UHP steam in oxidation Oxidation of silicon is a common and frequent step in the manufacture of integrated circuits (IC). The goal of oxidation is to grow a high quality, uniform oxide layer on a silicon substrate. During oxidation a chemical reaction between the oxidants and the silicon atoms produces a layer of oxide on the silicon surface of the wafer. It is often the first step in wafer fabrication and will be repeated multiple times throughout the fabrication process. Oxidation takes place in an oxidation tube. During the reaction silicon reacts with oxidants to form silicon oxide layers. Typical operating temperature is between 800 °C and 1,200 °C. The oxide growth rate increases with temperature. Growth rate, uniformity and yield are three important characteristics of the oxidation process. The faster the growth rate, the more wafers that can be manufactured in a given time. If the oxidation process is uniform across the tube—both horizontally and vertically—then the process will be complete at the same time across all wafers and the yield will be high. However, if the process is non- uniform, then intervention is required, increasing the process time and potentially reducing yield. In addition, fast growth rate can increase the defect rate, especially if contaminants are present. During the first stage of oxidation, the chemical reaction results from the direct contact between silicon and oxidants at the wafer surface. The reaction is limited by the number of silicon atoms available. For approximately the first 500Å, the oxide grows linearly with time. From that point on, the reaction rate slows down because the silicon dioxide layer covers the silicon atoms. As the silicon dioxide layer grows, it eventually prevents the oxidants from coming in direct contact with the silicon atoms. The second stage begins when approximately 1,000Å of silicon dioxide has been grown on the silicon substrate. At this point, the silicon atoms are no longer exposed to the oxidants and the oxidants begin to diffuse through the silicon dioxide in order to reach the silicon. The oxidation of silicon during this stage occurs at the silicon/silicon dioxide interface. As oxidation continues, the silicon dioxide layer thickens, and the distance the oxidants must travel to reach the silicon increases. The oxide growth rate is limited by the diffusion of the oxidants through silicon dioxide. There are two methods of oxidation: dry oxidation and wet oxidation. During dry oxidation, dry oxygen is introduced into the process tube where it reacts with silicon. Dry oxidation is a slow process that grows films at a rate between 140 and 250 Ǻ/hour. It is typically only used to grow thin oxides (<1000 Å).Salzman, J. \\"Microelectronic Processing Oxidation\\" by J. Salzman. Microelectronics Processing Course Presentation. January 2002. During wet oxidation, water vapor is introduced into the heated oxidation tube. Because water molecules form hydroxyl structures, they diffuse faster in silicon dioxide and the oxide growth rate increases. The wet oxidation growth rate is 1000 to 1200 Ǻ/hour, so wet oxidation is the preferred method to grow thick oxides. The growth rate slows with increasing thickness, according to the Deal-Grove model.Deal, B. E., Grove, A. S. \\"General Relationship for the Thermal Oxidation of Silicon, J. Appl. Phys., 36, 3770 (1965). Water vapor is a key ingredient in the wet oxidation recipe. During a typical process, a furnace containing multiple wafers is flooded with water vapor. The oxygen in the water molecule reacts within the silicon wafer to form silicon dioxide. This is a sacrificial process, where the original substrate is reduced as the oxide forms on its surface. When water vapor pressure is increased, the oxide growth rate is increased. According to the model of Deal and Grove[4], the growth rate of the oxide layer is directly related to the effective diffusion coefficient of the water molecules into the oxide layer and the equilibrium concentration in the immediate area. When a carrier gas is used to deliver water vapor, the carrier gas molecules generate a partial pressure. This partial pressure lowers the partial pressure of water vapor and slows the diffusion of water into the oxide film. The result is lower driving force and slower growth rate. For a given temperature and process pressure, oxide growth rates are fixed if the gas ratio is also constant. However, for a given operating temperature, this growth rate is not maximized until the water vapor pressure is equal to 100% of the operating pressure. While increasing water vapor flow rate seems obvious to improve growth rates, technical difficulties interfere with increasing the actual quantity of delivered water vapor. The role of UHP steam in annealing and passivation Some deposition methods are faster than others, which saves process time but can lead to less dense film. To improve the density and heal the film, annealing can be applied. Annealing and passivation are techniques used to repair atomic defects within the crystal that propagate into the wafer macrostructure, reducing efficiencies in microelectronics and photovoltaic cells. High temperature annealing can increase carrier lifetimes by injecting H into the Si/SiO2 interface. Passivation, or thermal annealing, of the interface limits hole/electron recombination, removes dangling bonds, and reduces vacancies and dislocations at grain boundaries. Annealing typically involves heating the wafer and saturating the chamber with a gas or water vapor that can then be incorporated into the film. Hydrogen is sourced from H2, H+ radicals from plasma, or H20 water vapor. The three common techniques are hydrogen plasma anneal, forming gas anneal, or high temperature steam anneal. Traditional methods used Hydrogen Radical Annealing (HRA), which uses hydrogen gas and microwave energy. Forming Gas Annealing (FGA) uses H2 at 400–500 °C. A new approach is the use of High Temperature Steam Annealing (HSA), which uses water vapor at 250–400 °C. In HSA, water vapor applied in a furnace can improve the density of oxides without the use of hydrogen. The steam readily inserts H and O atoms into the Si/SiO2 interface, and is much faster than FGA and comparable to the HRA process. Without the plasma, the device is subjected to less structural damage and obtains higher effective carrier lifetimes. The process is much simpler than a plasma process, and is both less expensive and safer.Abe, Y. et al. \\"Effect of high temperature steam annealing for SiO2 Passivation\\". Solar Energy Materials & Solar Cells 65 (2001) 607–612. An effective passivation of the rear surface of industrial solar cells is a prerequisite to considerably improve the conversion efficiency.Benick, J., Zimmermann, K., Spiegelman, J., Hermle, M. and Glunz, S. W. \\"Passivation Quality Of Wet Oxides Grown From Purified Steam\\". Presented at the 24th European PV Solar Energy Conference and Exhibition, 21–25 September 2009, Hamburg, Germany. An excellent level of surface passivation on lowly doped p-type surfaces is provided by thermal grown silicon oxides. However, dry thermal oxidation processes require relatively high temperatures (>1000 °C) and, due to the low growth rate, long process times. To decrease both oxidation temperature and process time the dry oxidation process can be replaced by a wet oxidation followed by nitrogen annealing. Best cell performance requires a forming gas anneal after firing. Industrial uses Ultra-high-purity steam is used in key industries including semiconductors, photovoltaics, MEMS and nanotechnology. Water vapor plays an important role in deposition processes, as well as in annealing, release etching and bonding. Water vapor can be the source of oxygen for the generation of oxides as well as a humidifier for dry gases in sputtering, spin-on and ALD processes. In the semiconductor and MEMS industries, Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP) and Diffusion need high flow rates of water vapor for short periods of time. The move to larger wafers and higher throughputs has only increased these flow requirements. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) depends on very small amounts of water vapor for High-K film formation. The technique requires the proper molecule be available and not replaced by competitive species that will disrupt the lattice structure. Temperature control of both the gas and water, as well as level control, affect delivery rate. ALD is increasingly popular for creating thin films for gate dielectrics, capacitor dielectrics and diffusion barriers. Contamination is a high risk in this process because ALD is slower and performed at lower temperatures. Plasma stripping is more effective with water vapor to help lift the film of the wafer surface. Immersion Lithography has been generally accepted as the lithography technology for the next several silicon generations. Impurities in the water such as dissolved gases and ionic salts can change the index of refraction, which directly affects image quality projected onto the wafer. Immersion lithography places a layer of pure water between the projection lens and the wafer. Any contaminant within the water can lead to change in refractive index and a project defect on the wafer. Micro-bubbles in the water can also lead to project defects on the wafer. Water vapor also plays an important role in Carbon NanoTube (CNT) fabrication.Spiegelman, J. \\"Water Vapor and Carbon Nanotubes\\". Technical White Paper, 2009. The technology required to improve CNT growth rate and uniformity faces major hurdles in its transfer from research to production. For repeatable and reliable CNT fabrication, tools are needed to control whether CNTs are single or multi- wall, straight or bent, long or short, and clean or dirty.Deepak, F. L., et al. \\"Improved Synthesis of carbon nanotubes with junctions and of single-wall carbon nanotubes\\" J. Chem. Sci., Vol. 118, No. 1, Jan 2006 pp. 9–114. Water vapor is pivotal to the process. Precise delivery of water vapor will determine what the CNT looks like, what its yield is, and how contamination free the structure is.Hata, K. \\"Water Assisted highly efficient synthesis of Impurity-free single-walled carbon nanotubes\\". November 19, 2004 Vol. 306 Science. Water vapor has been shown to have significant effect on thin film layers in ALD, MOCVD, and sputtering processes for the manufacture of photovoltaics. Such processes are commonly used to generate TCO layers and modify crystal structures via grain size or defect repair. The ability to deliver water vapor free from atmospheric contaminants is critical to film integrity.Spiegelman, J. \\"Silicon Dioxide Layer Key to High Efficiency Crystalline Solar Cells\\". Technical White Paper, 2010. Generation and delivery The ideal water vapor for industrial manufacturing processes is extremely pure, moderate in temperature and free of extra oxygen or water microdroplets. In addition, this water vapor is ideally delivered in a range of flow rates from standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) to standard litre per minute (slm), into vacuum or atmosphere pressure environments for days or weeks at a time. Purity is paramount in avoiding contamination. Purity can be achieved by blending pure gases under high heat or by purifying water vapor as it is generated. In either case, the piping and instrumentation must be carefully chosen to avoid adding metals, particles or other contaminants back into the water vapor. Temperature is important for several reasons. High temperature (in excess of 1100 °C) introduces greater safety issues. It also risks uneven heating in the chamber that can lead to problems with uniformity. If water vapor is generated at very high temperatures, it must be cooled before coming in contact with the furnace and wafers. Variation in temperature across the furnace tube can cause problems in uniformity. Depending on the application, water vapor may be required in very small or rather large increments. Ideally, the water vapor can be regulated to deliver the precise volume to the furnace or to the gas it is humidifying. This precision allows processes to run at optimal efficiency. Similarly, different applications may require the water vapor to be delivered at vacuum or atmosphere pressures. Meeting this requirement allows the process to be most efficient. When growing oxides, increasing the water vapor pressure in the process gas environment will increase the oxidation growth rate. Delivery of water vapor must be highly reliable for a long period of time. It is not unusual for processes to run for days or weeks. If water vapor delivery fails, the wafer may be compromised. As an ingredient in industrial manufacturing processes, the steam must be generated and delivered at a consistent, controllable flow rate and have an extremely low contamination level. Several technologies can be combined to generate, purify and deliver steam. Catalytic and pyrolytic steam Pyrolytic steam is often used to generate oxide thicknesses greater than 1000 Angstom. This steam is generated from the combination at high temperature of hydrogen and oxygen gases. The combustion process occurs either in a stainless steel catalytic oven or on a silicon torch at the entrance to the furnace. The gases combine into water vapor and are delivered directly to process. Because of the explosive risk associated with hydrogen, the process usually delivers an extra 10% oxygen flow. The purity level of pyrolytic steam depends on the purity of the process gases and the process temperature. The torch tip is typically quartz silica, which is known to be consumed over time by the flame, which may generate particulate downstream. Particle generation can also be an issue due to the velocity of high temperature combustion. Within its optimal operating range, torches deliver good purity. Pyrolytic systems can support a middle range of flow but have a difficult time with very low flow rates and low steam to hydrogen ratios when adding water vapor to a carrier gas. Also, thermal management of the heat profile of the furnace and incomplete combustion affect furnace performance. In selective oxidation processes, water vapor is needed with hydrogen and without molecular to oxygen. This allows for the oxidation of specific metals. Torches and catalytic system are not 100% efficient so low levels of oxygen may still enter the processes. 50 ppm oxygen may be sufficient to degrade the selective oxidation process. Present catalytic systems are metallic and are not easily scalable due to thermal buildup in the catalytic combustion cell. They use a metallic catalyst to combustion oxygen and hydrogen to water vapor. To use pyrolytic steam, the facility must install hydrogen and oxygen supply lines or store and dispose of gas cylinders. Cooling water or compressed air to cool the torch must also be managed since combustion of hydrogen can generate temperatures approaching 2200 °C. Under controlled conditions, pyrolytic and catalytic steam technology offers good flow control and accuracy. Bubblers Bubblers are simple devices that add water vapor to a carrier gas stream as the carrier gas bubbles through a water vessel. The quality of this steam added to the carrier gas is a function of the water temperature, carrier gas temperature, height of the liquid head, and pressure of the carrier gas. These devices are safe, easy to use, simple to maintain and low cost. They provide basic purification through single step distillation. However, contaminants and bacteria can rapidly build up if not frequently cleaned out. Bubblers cannot prevent entrainment of dissolved gas, volatile molecular contaminants, and micro-droplets that can carry particulate and ionic molecular contaminants. Process repeatability is limited due to control of process variables as well as thermal droop within the vessel with time. Purity depends chiefly on the quality of the source water, carrier gas and the components in the water and steam path. The water quality becomes a living history of contact with all piping materials as well as gases used for bubbling. The bubbling process is a single stage distillation step that concentrates contaminants in the remaining water in the vessel. These contaminants can be traced to the supply water and the carrier gas as well as the continuous leaching of contaminants from the vessel itself, which is commonly heated. House de-ionized water and secondary chemical filters and degassers are sometimes employed to reduce contaminants. Bubbler are susceptible to inaccurate flow due to the temperature of the gas, liquid, operating pressure, liquid level, and thermal droop. Bubblers also have limited gas flow rates. To increase the delivery rate, the carrier gas flows need to be increased, slowing the diffusion of water vapor to the surface. The water cannot be heated near boiling or uncontrolled flow will result. If the flow rate exceeds a limited velocity, bubbles force the source liquid out of the vessel and into the downstream piping, in turn forcing the use of phase separators, which leads to increased particulate, condensation, and flow instability. Long term use of bubblers typically results in fouling if the water is not frequently changed. The effect of bubbling oxygen through clean water and kept warm by heating and incident IR leads to ideal conditions for growing bacteria. This leads to organic contamination in the film. Vaporizers and direct liquid injection Vaporizers atomize water and then combust the small droplets into molecular water. The heat of vaporization is very high and the ability to the get the energy to the water molecule is limited by the heater transfer rate through the vaporizer plate and the carrier gas that is mixed in with the water vapor. In addition, the water is aggressive and can corrode the vaporizer internal components, leading to long term stability and reliability issues. DLI uses a metallic vaporizer or an additional metal hot plate to convert the liquid to gas. This process works best for mid-range flow rates. At low flow rates there is little control and limited accuracy, while at high flow rates the process is susceptible to bubbles in the liquid, which generate erratic values. DLI offers a low operating cost, good flow control and limited safety issues. DLI can vaporize only limited quantities due to thermal transfer rates, and there is a potential for chemical decomposition. Most critically, it cannot provide any purification of the liquid being vaporized; everything in the liquid is vaporized into the process. With direct liquid injection systems, increasing flow rate leads to incomplete vaporization. This increases micro droplet formation, which increases non-uniformity and ionic contamination on the wafer. Membrane contactors Membrane contactors allow gas transfer between a liquid and gas. They are made with hollow fiber membranes that are porous, allowing simultaneous transfer of the gas into the liquid and the liquid into the gas. These systems are not specific to which gases can permeate so they have no purification capability. Because of the design, the carrier gas can permeate the liquid source. This can be problematic if the carrier gas is pyrophoric or toxic. The porous membranes cannot prevent the penetration of microdroplets across the hollow fiber into the carrier gas. In addition the porous nature requires that operating pressures be carefully managed. This generally requires gas pressure be lower than the water source pressure. This can lead to severe process limits in design. Most hollow fibers are hydrophobic and must be modified to work with hydrophilic molecules. Membrane purification steam Purified steam relies on a combination of filtration, deionized water, controlled steam generation and a selective membrane process to deliver ultra high purity steam to process. The selective membrane process solves many of the challenges for direct delivery of water vapor by changing the way water molecules are converted from liquid to gas phase. A nonporous hydrophilic membrane is used. Only charged species can enter the nano-sized pores of the membrane. Non-polar species and particles are rejected. Because while ions can enter the pores, they cannot leave since they are not volatile. Only volatile polar molecules can enter and exit the membrane pores. The smallest polar molecule is water. Transfer across the membrane is restricted to single and small channel transfer rates. Once molecules cross the wall of the membrane, they are energized and ready to enter the gas phase based solely on the vapor pressure curve that relates to the temperature of the water. Using the membrane as the phase separator prevents water droplets from permeating the membrane and ensures very smooth and consistent flow. ReferencesFurther reading *Deal, B.

Stone tools found at the site have been dated to between 1 and 1.05 million years old, making it one of the earliest sites of human settlement known in Europe.Henry de Lumley, La Grande Histoire des premiers européens, Odile Jacob, Paris, 2010, pg. 131. \\"La grotte du Vallonnet est bien l'un es plus anciens temoins de la presence de l'homme en Europe, dans un contexte stratigraphique bien daté, avec les sites de Pirro Nord, de Barranco Léon, de Fuente Neuva 3 and de la Sima del Elefante...\\" Description The cave of Vallonnet is located on the western slope of Cap Martin, about above the Bay of Menton, at Roquebrune-Cap-Martin in the Alpes-Maritimes Department in France. It opens onto a ravine with a small creek, the Vallonnet, which drops down to the bay. The mountain is a massif of calcite-dolomitic rock formed during the Jurassic period, covered with puddingstone and hardened sands of the Miocene. The porch of the cave is narrow and low, and opens to a corridor in length, followed by a high room. Discovery The cave was discovered in 1958 by 13 year old Marianne Poire, who regularly visited the cave to collect pieces of calcite and one day showed them to René Pascal, an employee of a Monte Carlo casino and an amateur prehistorian. Marianne then led her parents, Pascal and others to the entry of the cave. The first systematic excavations were carried out in 1962.De Lumley, La Grande Histoire des premiers hommes européens, pg. 120. Layers of sediment The excavations found five distinct layers of sediment in the cave: # Layer I was a floor of stalagmites, which could be dated between 1.4 and 1.370 million years BC. Analysis of the pollen found in this layer showed it was located in a forested landscape, where platanes were dominant. # Layer II was composed of beach sand, mixed with seashells and fish bones, dated to a little over 1.05 million years. The types of fish bones found showed that at this time the cave was washed by a tropical or subtropical sea. The pollen found indicated that the landscape had been covered with pine forest, and that the climate at that time was relatively warm, with mild winters. # Layer III was the thickest layer (1.5 metres) composed of sand mixed with stones and rocks from the pudding which hung over the cave. Mixed into this layer were numerous animal bones, either brought there by man or by predatory animals. The pollen indicated a drier climate at that time, dominated by clusters of white oak trees. This layer was dated by magnetostratigraphy; the studies showed that the layer corresponded with the Jaramillo normal event period of direct geomagnetic polarity, between the periods of inverse geomagnetic polarity of Motonori Matuyama. This allowed the archaeologists to date the layer to between 1.050 and 1 million years.De Lumley, La Grande Histoire des premiers hommes européens, pg. 123 # About one million years ago the entry to the cave was emptied by erosion, leaving only the sediments in the deepest part of the interior chamber. The fourth layer, A thick stalagmitic floor, formed over these sediments, and was dated by Electron paramagnetic resonance to between 900,000 and 890,000 years. Pollen showed that the climate of this time was cooler and much wetter than the present climate. # The fifth and highest layer of sediment is composed of different sands from earlier layers of the cave, deposited during the successive wet periods which followed. Animal species Layer III contained the most important finds in the cave; a collection of animal bones, and 11 simple tools used by human visitors. It appears that the cave was used as a dining room by large carnivores, notably the bear, the panther, the saber-tooth tiger, and the large hyena. These brought to the cave the carcasses of herbivores; deer, bison, small bovides, rhinoceros, horses, and boars. When the predators were not in the cave, it was used by humans, who left the tools. The bones of 25 different species of mammals were found in the cave, all characteristic of the lower Pleistocene age. Besides those named above, bones were found of the Eurasian jaguar (Panthera gombaszoegensis), the leopard, (Acinonyx pardinensis) the meridional elephant (Mammuthus meridionalis), and others. Other species were found from the middle Pleistocene period, including an early species of wolf (Canis mosbachensis), an early fox (Alopex praeglacialis), and a cave lynx (Lynx spelaea).De Lumley, pg. 126 Tools About 100 basic tools made by man were found in the cave. Most were made of calcaire (limestone), less often of sandstone, with a small number of tools made of quartz and flint. Percussion, or pounding, tools, were the most frequent. These included chopping tools, of poor quality. None of the tools had been reworked to improve their quality. The middle part of a femur bone of a bison was found which showed sign of being crafted into a pounding tool. While most of the bones in the cave showed that they had been broken by the teeth of predators, a number of bones had marks that showed that they had been broken by these early tools. It appears that the early human visitors to Vallonnet cave used their stone tools to break bones and eat the marrow inside. There were no indications of fire in the cave; fire had apparently not yet been domesticated. It appears that the people who visited the cave were not primarily hunters, but scavengers, who lived on the meat of animals killed by predators. There were also no signs that they lived in the cave.,De Lumley, pg, 130. Comparison with other archaeological sites * Gona, Afar, Ethiopia.

It was built in 1928, making it the oldest ski area in Washington and among the oldest in the U.S. Meany Lodge is maintained and operated by volunteers of The Mountaineers, a non-profit group, and is located in the Wenatchee National Forest near the eastern portal of the Stampede Pass Train Tunnel. Meany Lodge has a PSIA certificated ski school and offers lessons to alpine skiers, cross country skiers, touring skiers, snowshoers, and snowboarders. Lessons are available when booking reservations. Reservations are needed for day and overnight use. Overnight reservations include a bunk and all meals. The lodge capacity is 97 persons.  Snow Sports = Alpine Skiing  Alpine (downhill) skiers and snowboarders have access to 32 downhill runs of which 4 are groomed. Access to the runs are via 3 rope tows. The longest tow Mach is the longest certified rope tow west of the Rockies. The slope has a vertical drop.  Cross Country Skiing  There is approximately one mile of groomed cross-country trails around the lodge with additional groomed trails winding through the surrounding landscape. Historic Stampede Pass, the NWS Weather Station at Stampede Pass, and the Palouse to Cascades State Park Trail are near the lodge.  Ski Touring  two skiers crossing a stream Much like the first skiers to visit the Martin area, ski touring is still practiced. Today's skiers use Randonee, Telemark, and Alpine Touring bindings. Touring gear at Meany is especially common in the weeks before the annual Patrol Race.Patrol Race  Ski Runs = Lane  In 1931 the Lane was constructed by logging the trees off Meany Hill. The logs were used to construct a log cabin tow hut.  Lower Slobbovia (aka South)  In 1954 the Bonneville Power Administration constructed a power line over the south end of Meany property. The cleared area provides excellent skiing. The 1957 relocation of Mach was to gain better access to this slope.  North Slobbovia (aka North)  In 1963, Puget Sound Power & Light, thinking they were on the BPA right-of-way, ran a transmission line up the center of North Slobbovia. In consideration for an easement and Meany volunteers not removing their power line, Puget Sound Power agreed to bury the line and saw the stumps they left flush with the ground. North is accessed by releasing from Mach anywhere above the 3/4 pole.  Henrietta's Meadow  In 1978 the Forest Service logged off Section 34. This ski run was formerly known as Henrietta's Woods.  Rope Tows = Mach  In 1938 Mach was constructed by Jack Hossack. A Fordson tractor pulled skiers 70% of the way up the Lane gaining over a run. The first rope tows constructed in the Northwest were Snoqualmie (January 1, 1938), Mt. Rainier, and Mt. Baker. In 1943, the head pole was moved to the top of the Lane, increasing the vertical gain to . In 1945, the head pole was moved again increasing the vertical gain to . In 1946, Mach powertrain was replaced with a Chevy engine and transmission and a truck rear end. The result was faster and more powerful, so more skiers could be towed. In 1957, the base of the Mach tow was moved lower and the head pole moved higher, increasing the length to and of vertical. In 1986 the control tower was added. In 2013, Mach moved the rope at ; before lift speeds were regulated, it ran at . In 2014, the gas engine powering Mach was replaced with an electric motor.  Super Worm  In 1973 the Worm rope tow was added. It goes halfway up the Lane ( long, high) for beginners. In 1987, with parts donated by Crystal Mountain, the tow was upgraded to long, a faster 20 HP motor that could tow more people. The upgraded tow was christened the Super Worm.  Turtle  Installed in 1987, with parts from Worm and donations from Crystal Mountain. It has a 7.5 HP motor and goes very slow for beginners.  History  In 1915 skiing begin in the PNW when a few Mountaineers started wearing skis to the Snoqualmie Lodge and Paradise instead of snowshoes. For the next two decades, skiing meant ski touring and the epicenter in the Northwest was at the Snoqualmie Lodge. By the early 1920s, skiing was gaining a following. In 1927, the Mountaineers wanted to add a ski hut near Stampede Pass. The scouting committee led by Ernest N. Harris rode the Northern Pacific Railroad to Martin and stayed in railroad shacks/cottages near the Stampede Pass tunnel. The train fare to Martin was as low as $1.80 per round trip. In the summer of 1928, Edmond S. Meany purchased the 54 acre plot for $125 and donated it to the Mountaineers. That fall a cabin was constructed. On Armistice Day 1928, it was dedicated as the Meany Ski Hut. In 1937, at the other end of the Stampede Pass tunnel the Milwaukee Railroad built the Milwaukee Ski Bowl with a 300' vertical rope tow. It too was an immediate success. In 1938 the rope tow Mach was constructed. This transformed Meany from \\"touring only\\" to mostly downhill skiing and doubled the patronage of Meany. That same year, the Northern Pacific Railroad built the Martin Ski Dome across the railroad tracks from the Meany Ski Hut. In 1956, Meany saw its deepest snow yet with at the lodge. The heavy snows crushed the Husky Chalet.  Ski Competitions  In 1929 Meany began ski instruction and on March 10, 1929, held its first annual cross country race. Ellen E. Willis won the women's Meany Ski Hut Trophy and Hans Otto-Giese won the men's. In 1930, club slalom and downhill races were held. In addition, the first annual Patrol Race was held. The Ski Patrol Race was opened to other ski clubs in 1936. In 1941, the last Ski Patrol Race was held the world entered World War II. The annual competition was resurrected in 2014.Patrol Race  Lodge History  In the fall of 1927, a crew of 100 Mountaineers hauled supplies by hand uphill 300 yards from the Martin station. In two months of weekends, the original x ' two-story wood cabin large enough for 50 people was constructed. Tables and benches were also built and a 1,700 pound kitchen range was hauled up with block and tackle. In 1939, a 25' x 30' three-story addition and basement was added. The lodge then had 4 stories: the basement, main floor, and two attic dorm floors. In 1953 the coal-fired kitchen range upon which 25 years of cooks have suffered was replaced with a propane range. In 1970 the basement was expanded with a drying room and another dorm was built.  Transportation  The Sunset Highway wasn't regularly open during the winter so the Northern Pacific Railroad was the primary means of access to Meany lodge. By the late 1930s, Snoqualmie Pass was plowed open more regularly and some skiers would park at the Rustic Inn on the Sunset Highway (present day I-90) and ski the 3 miles to the lodge. In April of 1960, NPRR removed its trains No. 5 and No. 6, discontinuing passenger service to Martin. Meany leased a Bombardier snow tractor, later christened Tomcat, to haul gear and tow skiers the 3 miles from I-90 to Edifus Wreck, a drop off point just below railroad curve. In 1966, the trail above the railroad tracks was widened to permit vehicle access. In 1983, BNSF Railway discontinued the 78-mile line through the Stampede Tunnel but did not abandon the right of way. On December 5, 1996 they resumed regular train service across Stampede Pass. Today, winter access to Meany Lodge is via tracked snow machines (Tomcat and/or snowmobiles) on a scheduled basis or ad hoc via snowshoes or skis.  Electricity  In 1963, a 2.4KV electric line was built from the Martin station. An additional 600' feet of 2.4KV line was installed to connect between the buildings. In 1980 falling trees knocked out power. After restoration, Burlington Northern Railroad advised that their power line (which the lodge used) would be abandoned. In 1981, a new 500' power line was constructed to connect to Puget Sound Energy. Transformers convert the 7200V supply to 240V.

Background In 1830, the Maryland General Assembly passed legislation which authorized only state residents to harvest oysters in its waters. Maryland outlawed dredging, while Virginia continued to allow it until 1879. In 1865, the Maryland General Assembly passed a law that required annual permits for oyster harvesting and this has been described as the start of the Oyster Wars. Clashes After the Civil War, the oyster harvesting industry exploded. In the 1880s, the Chesapeake Bay supplied almost half of the world's supply of oysters. New England fishermen encroached on the Bay after their local oyster beds had been exhausted, which prompted violent clashes with competitors from Maryland and Virginia. Watermen from different counties likewise clashed. Government responses Oyster pirates in 1884. Part of the Library of Congress notation is \\"Ships Julia Hamilton\\" though the drawing features \\"pirate\\" night dredgers. Maryland In 1868, Maryland founded the Maryland Oyster Police Force, nicknamed the Oyster Navy, which was the predecessor of the modern Maryland Natural Resources Police. It was headed by Naval Academy graduate Hunter Davidson and was responsible for enforcing the state's oyster- harvesting laws, but it was an inadequate force to compete with the more heavily armed watermen. Virginia Virginia made its own attempts to fight illegal oystering. In the 1870s, Virginia imposed license fees, seasonal limits, and other measures to prevent over harvesting and preserve the oyster population. However, the cash-strapped commonwealth had limited enforcement capabilities—especially after it sold its three-vessel maritime police fleet at auction.Moore, pp. 367-368. After violence broke out between oyster tongers, individual small boat oystermen using hand held tongs to collect oysters, and more affluent oyster dredgers, Virginia banned oyster dredging in 1879.Moore, p. 368. When armed and organized dredgers, many from Maryland, violated the ban, Virginia Governor William E. Cameron found an opportunity to boost his popularity by taking on the pirates. Cameron personally led an expedition against the illegal dredgers. On February 17, 1882, Cameron's force, consisting of the tugboat Victoria J. Peed and the freighter Louisa, engaged pirates at the mouth of the Rappahannock River.Moore, p. 369. The governor's raid resulted in the successful convictions of 41 dredgers and the forfeiture of seven boats.Moore, p. 370. The raid represented the high point of the governor's term.Moore, p. 371. When Cameron's popularity sank and dredgers returned to the bay, the governor undertook a second expedition. Cameron once again used the Peed but the steamer Pamlico became his flagship.Moore, p. 372. Cameron's second expedition was not very successful. Captured dredgers were acquitted or escaped indictment in court.Moore, p. 373. The opposition press also mocked the governor for failing to capture the Dancing Molly,Moore, p. 374. a sloop run by three women who managed to outrun the governor's ships. The Norfolk Academy of Music lampooned the governor's expedition in an April 1883 comic opera, Driven from the Seas: or, The Pirate Dredger's Doom.Moore, p. 375. In 1884, Cameron established the \\"Board on the Chesapeake and its Tributaries,\\" which led to improved law enforcement and better fishery management.Moore, p. 376. In 1959, the Potomac River Fisheries Commissioner H. C. Byrd ordered the fisheries police disarmed after an officer killed a Virginia waterman who was illegally dredging. The move was credited with bringing an end to the violent conflicts. See also * Governor R. M.

The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a \\"hero\\", who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's \\"Ancient\\", a large structure located within their base. Development of Dota 2 began in 2009 when IceFrog, lead designer of Defense of the Ancients, was hired by Valve to create a modernized remake for them in the Source game engine. It was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux via the digital distribution platform Steam in July 2013, following a Windows-only open beta phase that began two years prior. The game is fully free-to-play with no heroes or any other gameplay element needing to be bought or otherwise unlocked. To maintain it, Valve supports the game as a service, selling loot boxes and a battle pass subscription system called Dota Plus that offer non-gameplay altering virtual goods in return, such as hero cosmetics and audio replacement packs. The game has also been updated with various other features since release, such as a port to the Source 2 engine and support for virtual reality. Dota 2 has a large esports scene, with teams from around the world playing in various professional leagues and tournaments. Valve manages an event format known as the Dota Pro Circuit, which are a series of tournaments that award qualification points for earning direct invitations to The International, the game's premier annual tournament. Internationals feature a crowdfunded prize money system that has seen amounts in upwards of 30 million, making Dota 2 the most lucrative esports game. Media coverage of most tournaments is done by a selection of on- site staff who provide commentary and analysis for the ongoing matches, similar to traditional sporting events. In addition to playing live to audiences in arenas and stadiums, broadcasts of them are also streamed over the internet, and sometimes simulcast on television networks, with peak viewership numbers in the millions. Despite some criticism going towards its steep learning curve and overall complexity, Dota 2 was praised for its rewarding gameplay, production quality, and faithfulness to its predecessor, with many considering it to be one of the greatest video games of all time. It has been one of the most played games on Steam since its release, with over a million concurrent players at its peak. The popularity of the game has led to official merchandise for it being produced, including apparel, accessories, and toys, as well as promotional tie-ins to other games and media. The game also allows for the community to create their own gamemodes, maps, and cosmetics, which are uploaded to the Steam Workshop. Two spinoff games, Artifact and Dota Underlords, were also released by Valve. Dota 2 has also been used in machine learning experiments, with a team of bots known as the OpenAI Five showing the capability to defeat professional players.  Gameplay  A game of Dota 2 in progress, showing the Radiant team inside their base at the beginning of a match Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game in which two teams of five players compete to collectively destroy a large structure defended by the opposing team known as the \\"Ancient\\", whilst defending their own. As in Defense of the Ancients, the game is controlled using standard real-time strategy controls, and is presented on a single map in a three-dimensional isometric perspective. Ten players each control one of the game's 119 playable characters, known as \\"heroes\\", with each having their own design, strengths, and weaknesses. Heroes are divided into two primary roles, known as the core and support. Cores, which are also called carries, begin each match as weak and vulnerable, but are able to become more powerful later in the game, thus becoming able to \\"carry\\" their team to victory. Supports generally lack abilities that deal heavy damage, instead having ones with more functionality and utility that provide assistance for their cores, such as providing healing and other buffs. Players select their hero during a pre-game drafting phase, where they can also discuss potential strategies and hero matchups with their teammates. Heroes are removed from the drafting pool and become unavailable for all other players once one is selected, and can not be changed once the drafting phase is over. All heroes have a basic attack in addition to powerful abilities, which are the primary method of fighting. Each hero has at least four of them, all of which are unique. Heroes begin each game with an experience level of one, only having access to one of their abilities, but are able to level up and become more powerful during the course of the game, up to a maximum level of 30. Whenever a hero gains an experience level, the player is able to unlock another of their abilities or improve one already learned. The most powerful ability for each hero is known as their \\"ultimate\\", which requires them to have an experience level of six in order to use. In order to prevent abilities from being used without consequence, a magic system is featured in the game. Activating an ability costs a hero some of their \\"mana points\\", which slowly regenerates over time. Using an ability will also cause it to enter a cooldown period, in which the ability can not be used again until a timer resets. All heroes have three attributes: strength, intelligence, and agility, which affect health points, mana points, and attack speed, respectively. Each hero has one primary attribute out of the three, which adds to their non-ability basic damage output when increased, among other minor buffs. Heroes also have an ability augmentation system known as the \\"Talent Tree\\", which allow players more choices on how to develop their hero. If a hero runs out of health points and dies, they are removed from active play until a timer counts down to zero, where they are then respawned in their base with only some gold lost. The two teams—known as the Radiant and Dire—occupy fortified bases in opposite corners of the map, which is divided in half by a crossable river and connected by three paths, which are referred to as \\"lanes\\". The lanes are guarded by defensive towers that attack any opposing unit who gets within its line of sight. A small group of weak computer-controlled creatures called \\"creeps\\" travel predefined paths along the lanes and attempt to attack any opposing heroes, creeps, and buildings in their way. Creeps periodically spawn throughout the game in groups from two buildings, called the \\"barracks\\", that exist in each lane and are located within the team's bases. The map is also permanently covered for both teams in fog of war, which prevents a team from seeing the opposing team's heroes and creeps if they are not directly in sight of themselves or an allied unit. The map also features a day-night cycle, with some hero abilities and other game mechanics being altered depending on the time of the cycle. Also present on the map are \\"neutral creeps\\" that are hostile to both teams, and reside in marked locations on the map known as \\"camps\\". Camps are located in the area between the lanes known as the \\"jungle\\", which both sides of the map have. Neutral creeps do not attack unless provoked, and respawn over time if killed. The most powerful neutral creep is named \\"Roshan\\", who is a unique boss that may be defeated by either team to obtain special items, such as one that allows a one-time resurrection if the hero that holds it is killed. Roshan will respawn around ten minutes after being killed, and becomes progressively harder to kill as the match progresses over time. Runes, which are special items that spawn in set positions on the map every few minutes, offer heroes temporary, but powerful power-ups when collected, such as double damage and invisibility. In addition to having abilities becoming stronger during the game, players are able to buy items from set locations on the map called shops that provide their own special abilities. Items are not limited to specific heroes, and can be bought by anyone. In order to obtain an item, players must be able to afford it with gold at shops located on the map, which is primarily obtained by killing enemy heroes, destroying enemy structures, and killing creeps, with the latter being an act called \\"farming\\". Only the hero that lands the killing blow on a creep obtains gold from it, an act called \\"last hitting\\", but all allies receive a share of gold when an enemy hero dies close to them. Players are also able to \\"deny\\" allied units and structures by last hitting them, which then prevents their opponents from getting full experience from them. Gold can not be shared between teammates, with each player having their own independent stash. Players also receive a continuous, but small stream of gold over the course of a match. Multiple game types in the game exist, which mainly alter the way hero selection is handled; examples include \\"All Pick\\", which offer no restrictions on hero selection, \\"All Random\\", which randomly assigns a hero for each player, \\"Captain's Mode\\", where a single player on each team selects heroes for their entire team and is primarily used for professional play, and \\"Turbo\\", an expedited version of All Pick featuring increased gold and experience gain, weaker towers, and faster respawn times. Matches usually last around 30 minutes to an hour, although they can last forever as long as both Ancients remain standing. In Captain's Mode games, an additional \\"GG\\" forfeit feature is available to end games early. Dota 2 also occasionally features limited-time events that present players with alternative game modes that do not follow the game's standard rules. Some of these included the Halloween-themed Diretide event, the Christmas-themed Frostivus event, and the New Bloom Festival, which celebrated the coming of spring. Other special game modes have also been created by Valve, including a ten-versus-ten mode, a Halloween-themed capture point mode \\"Colosseum\\", a combat arena mode \\"Overthrow\\", \\"Siltbreaker\\", a story-driven cooperative campaign mode, and \\"The Underhollow\\", a battle royale mode. The move to the Source 2 engine in 2015 also added the \\"Arcade\\" feature, which allows for community-created game modes, with the more popular ones having dedicated server hosting by Valve. One popular example, known as Dota Auto Chess, had over seven million in-game subscribers by April 2019. Due to its popularity, Valve met with the mod's developers, the Chinese-based Drodo Studio, to discuss directly collaborating on a standalone version. However, the two companies were unable to come to an agreement, with them both stating that it was in their best interest to develop their own separate games. Valve's version, Dota Underlords, was released in February 2020 and continued to use the Dota setting, while Drodo's game, Auto Chess, was developed without using any Dota 2 assets.  Development  Defense of the Ancients, the original mod from Warcraft III that Dota 2 was based on The Dota series began in 2003 with Defense of the Ancients (DotA)—a mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos—created by the pseudonymous designer \\"Eul\\". An expansion pack for Warcraft III, titled The Frozen Throne, was released later that year; a series of Defense of the Ancients clone mods for the new game competed for popularity. DotA: Allstars by Steve Feak was the most successful, and Feak, with his friend Steve Mescon, created the official Defense of the Ancients community website and the holding company DotA-Allstars, LLC. When Feak retired from DotA: Allstars in 2005, a friend, under the pseudonym IceFrog, became its lead designer. By the late 2000s, Defense of the Ancients became one of the most popular mods worldwide, as well as a prominent esports game. IceFrog and Mescon later had a falling out in May 2009, which prompted the former to establish a new community website at playdota.com. Valve's interest in the Dota intellectual property began when several veteran employees, including Team Fortress 2 designer Robin Walker and executive Erik Johnson, became fans of the mod and wanted to build a modern sequel. The company corresponded with IceFrog by email about his long-term plans for the project, and he was subsequently hired to direct a sequel. IceFrog first announced his new position through his blog in October 2009, with Dota 2 being officially announced a year later. Valve adopted the word \\"Dota\\", derived from the original mod's acronym, as the name for its newly acquired franchise. Johnson argued that the word referred to a concept, and was not an acronym. Shortly after the announcement of Dota 2, Valve filed a trademark claim to the Dota name. At Gamescom 2011, company president Gabe Newell explained that the trademark was needed to develop a sequel with the already-identifiable brand. Holding the Dota name to be a community asset, Feak and Mescon filed an opposing trademark for Dota on behalf of DotA-Allstars, LLC (then a subsidiary of Riot Games) in August 2010. Rob Pardo, the executive vice president of Blizzard Entertainment at the time, similarly stated that the Dota name belonged to the mod's community. Blizzard acquired DotA-Allstars, LLC from Riot Games and filed an opposition against Valve in November 2011, citing Blizzard's ownership of both the Warcraft III World Editor and DotA-Allstars, LLC as proper claims to the franchise name. The dispute was settled in May 2012, with Valve retaining commercial rights to the Dota trademark, while allowing non-commercial use of the name by third-parties. In 2017, Valve's ownership of franchise was again challenged, after a 2004 internet forum post from Eul was brought to light by a Chinese company known as uCool, who had released a mobile game in 2014 that used characters from the Dota universe. uCool, who was previously involved in a lawsuit with Blizzard in 2015 for similar reasons, along with another Chinese company, Lilith Games, argued that the forum post invalidated any ownership claims of the intellectual property, stating that the Dota property was an open-source, collective work that could not be copyrighted by anyone in particular. Judge Charles R. Breyer denied uCool's motion for summary dismissal, with Blizzard filing motions to dismiss all claims against uCool and Lilith with prejudice. An early goal of the Dota 2 team was the adaptation of Defense of the Ancients aesthetic style for the Source engine. The Radiant and Dire factions replaced the Sentinel and Scourge from the mod, respectively. Character names, abilities, items and map design from the mod were largely retained, with some changes due to trademarks owned by Blizzard. In the first Q&A; session regarding Dota 2, IceFrog explained that the game would build upon the mod without making significant changes to its core. Valve contracted major contributors from the Defense of the Ancients community, including Eul and artist Kendrick Lim, to assist with the sequel. Additional contributions from sources outside of Valve were also sought regularly for Dota 2, as to continue Defense of the Ancients tradition of community-sourced development. One of the composers of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, Jason Hayes, was hired to collaborate with Tim Larkin to write the original score for the game, which was conducted by Timothy Williams and performed and recorded by the Northwest Sinfonia at Bastyr University. Valve had Half-Life series writer Marc Laidlaw, science fiction author Ted Kosmatka, and Steam support employee Kris Katz write new dialog and background lore for the heroes. Notable voice actors for heroes include Nolan North, Dave Fennoy, Jon St. John, Ellen McLain, Fred Tatasciore, Merle Dandridge, Jen Taylor, and John Patrick Lowrie, among others. The Source engine itself was updated with new features to accommodate Dota 2, such as high-end cloth modeling and improved global lighting. The game features Steam integration, which provides its social component and cloud storage for personal settings. In November 2013, Valve introduced a coaching system that allows experienced players to tutor newer players with in-game tools. As with previous Valve multiplayer games, players are able to spectate live matches of Dota 2 played by others, and local area network (LAN) multiplayer support allows for local competitions. Some of these events may be spectated via the purchase of tickets from the \\"Dota Store\\", which give players in-game access to matches. Ticket fees are apportioned in part to tournament organizers. The game also features an in-game fantasy sports system, which is modeled after traditional fantasy sports and feature professional Dota 2 players and teams. Players are also able to spectate games in virtual reality (VR) with up to 15 others, which was added in an update in July 2016. The update also added a hero showcase mode, which allows players to see all of the heroes and their cosmetics full-size in virtual reality. As part of a plan to develop Dota 2 into a social network, Newell announced in April 2012 that the game would be free-to-play, and that community contributions would be a cornerstone feature. Instead, revenue is generated through the \\"Dota Store\\", which offers for- purchase cosmetic virtual goods, such as custom armor and weapons for their heroes. It was also announced that the full roster of heroes would be available at launch for free. Until the game's official release in 2013, players were able to purchase an early access bundle, which included a digital copy of Dota 2 and several cosmetic items. Included as optional downloadable content (DLC), the Dota 2 Workshop Tools are a set of Source 2 software development kit (SDK) tools that allow content creators to create new hero cosmetics, as well as custom game modes, maps, and bot scripts. Highly rated cosmetics, through the Steam Workshop, are available in the in-game store if they are accepted by Valve. This model was fashioned after Valve's Team Fortress 2, which had earned Workshop designers of cosmetic items of that game over $3.5 million by June 2011. Newell revealed that the average Steam Workshop contributor for Dota 2 and Team Fortess 2 made approximately $15,000 from their creations in 2013. By 2015, sales of Dota 2 virtual goods had earned Valve over $238 million in revenue, according to the digital game market research group SuperData. In 2016, Valve introduced the \\"Custom Game Pass\\" option for creators of custom game modes, which allows them to be funded by way of microtransactions by adding exclusive features, content, and other changes to their game mode for players who buy it. Dota 2 includes a seasonal Elo rating-based matchmaking system, which is measured by a numerical value known as \\"matchmaking rating\\" (MMR) that is tracked separately for core and support roles, and ranked into different tiers. MMR is updated based on if a player won or lost, which will then increase or decrease respectively. The game's servers, known as the \\"Game Coordinator\\", attempts to balance both teams based on each player's MMR, with each team having roughly a 50% chance to win in any given game. Ranked game modes with a separately tracked MMR are also available, which primarily differ from unranked games by making MMR publicly visible, as well as requiring the registration of a phone number to their accounts, which help foster a more competitive environment. To ensure that each player's ranking is up to date and accurate, MMR is recalibrated around every six months. Players with the highest possible medal rank are listed by Valve on an online leaderboard, separated into North American, European, Southeast Asian, and Chinese regions. The game also includes a report system, which allows players to punish player behavior that intentionally provides a negative experience. Players who get reported enough or leave several games before they conclude, a practice known as \\"abandoning\\", are then placed into low priority matchmaking, which remains on a player's account until they win a specific number of games, and only groups them with other players who also have the same punishment. Other features include an improved replay system from Defense of the Ancients, in which a completed game can be downloaded in-client and viewed by anyone at a later time, and the \\"hero builds\\" feature, which provide integrated guides created by the community that highlight to the player on how to play their hero.  Dota 2 Reborn  In June 2015, Valve announced that the entirety of Dota 2 would be ported over to their Source 2 game engine in an update called Dota 2 Reborn. Reborn was first released as an opt-in beta update that same month, and officially replaced the original client in September 2015, making it the first game to use the engine. Reborn included a new user interface framework design, ability for custom game modes created by the community, and the full replacement of the original Source engine with Source 2. Largely attributed to technical difficulties players experienced with the update, the global player base experienced a sharp drop of approximately sixteen percent the month following the release of it. However, after various updates and patches, over a million concurrent players were playing again by the beginning of 2016, with that number being the largest in nearly a year. The move to Source 2 also allowed the use of the Vulkan graphics API, which was released as an optional feature in May 2016, making Dota 2 one of the first games to use it.  Release  Gamescom 2011 in Cologne, where the game was first made playable to the public Dota 2 was first made available to the public at Gamescom in 2011, coinciding with the inaugural International championship, the game's premier esport tournament event. At the event, Valve began sending out closed beta invitations to DotA players and attendees for the Microsoft Windows version of the game. Although the game was originally meant to publicly release in 2012, Valve later scrapped that plan as it would have kept the game in its closed beta state for over a year. Due to that, Valve lifted the non-disclosure agreement and transitioned the game into open beta in September 2011, allowing players to discuss the game and their experiences publicly. Following nearly two years of beta testing, Dota 2 was officially released on Steam for Windows on July 9, 2013, and for OS X and Linux on July 18, 2013. The game did not launch with every hero from Defense of the Ancients. Instead, the missing ones were added in various post-release updates, with the final one, as well as the first Dota 2 original hero, being added in 2016. Two months following the game's release, Newell claimed that updates to Dota 2 generated up to three percent of global internet traffic. In December 2013, the final restrictions against unlimited global access to Dota 2 were lifted after the game's infrastructure and servers were substantially bolstered. In order to abide by the standards set by the economic legislation of specific countries, Valve opted to contract with nationally based developers for publishing. In October 2012, Chinese game publisher Perfect World announced they had received distribution rights for the game in the country. The Chinese client also has a region-specific \\"Low Violence\\" mode, which censors and changes most depictions of blood, gore, and skulls in order for the game to follow censorship policies of the country. In November 2012, a similar publishing deal was made with the South Korea-based game company Nexon to distribute and market the game in the country, as well as in Japan. Three years later, Nexon announced they would no longer be operating servers for Dota 2, with Valve taking over direct distribution and marketing of the game in those regions. In December 2016, Dota 2 was updated to gameplay version 7.00, also known as \\"The New Journey\\" update. Prior to the update, the Dota series had been in version 6.xx for over a decade, marking the first major revision since IceFrog originally took over development of the original mod in the mid 2000s. The New Journey update added and changed numerous features and mechanics of the game, including adding the first original hero not ported over from Defense of the Ancients, a reworked map, a redesigned HUD, a pre-game phase that allows for players to discuss their team strategy, and a \\"Talent Tree\\" ability augmentation system. In April 2017, Valve announced changes to the game's ranked matchmaking system, with the main one requiring the registration of a unique phone number to a player's account in order to play them, an anti-griefing and smurfing practice they had previously implemented in their first-person shooter game, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Further changes to the game's matchmaking were brought in an update in November 2017, where the old numerical MMR system was replaced by a seasonal one based on eight ranked tiers that are recalibrated around every six months, a move that brought the game's ranked system closer to ones used in other competitive games such as Global Offensive, StarCraft, and League of Legends. For most of 2018, Valve decided to handle gameplay balance updates for the game in a different way. Instead of releasing larger updates irregularly throughout the year, smaller ones would be released on a set schedule of every two weeks. Around the same time, the game also introduced the \\"Dota Plus\\" monthly subscription system that replaced the seasonal battle passes that were released to coincide with a Major tournament. In addition to offering everything battle passes previously did, Dota Plus added new features such as a hero-specific achievement system that reward players who complete them with exclusive cosmetics, as well as providing hero and game analytics and statistics gathered from thousands of recent games.  Esports  The largest Dota 2 tournaments often have prize pools totaling millions of dollars. Shown here is The International 2018, a $25 million tournament hosted at the Rogers Arena in Vancouver. To ensure that enough Defense of the Ancients players would take up Dota 2 and to promote the game to a new audience, Valve invited sixteen accomplished Defense of the Ancients esports teams to compete at a Dota 2-specific tournament at Gamescom in August 2011, which later became an annually held event known as The International. From The International 2013 onward, its prize pool began to be crowdfunded through a type of in-game battle pass called the \\"Compendium\\", which raises money from players buying them and connected lootboxes to get exclusive in-game cosmetics and other bonuses offered through them. 25% of all the revenue made from Compendiums go directly to the prize pool, with sales from the 2013 battle pass raising over 2.8 million, which made it the largest prize pool in esports history at the time. Each iteration of The International since then has surpassed the previous one's prize pool, with the most recent one, The International 2019, having one at over $34 million. During its beta phase in the early 2010s, several other esport events would begin hosting Dota 2 events, including the Electronic Sports World Cup, DreamHack, World Cyber Games, and ESL. By the end of 2011, Dota 2 was already one of the highest- paying esport games, second only to StarCraft II. At E3 2013, South Korean company Nexon announced the investment of 2 billion (approximately 1.7 million) into local leagues in the country, which coincided with their distribution partnership with Valve for the game. In February 2015, Valve sponsored Dota 2 Asia Championships was held in Shanghai with a prize pool of over $3 million, raised through compendium sales. Since then, other Dota 2 Asia Championships have taken place, with it being sometimes being referred to as the \\"Chinese International\\". In total, professional Dota 2 tournaments had earned teams and players over $100 million by June 2017, with over half of that being awarded at Internationals, making it the highest earning esport game by a margin of nearly $60 million at the time. From late 2015 until early 2017, Valve sponsored a series of smaller-scale, seasonally held tournaments known as the Dota Major Championships, which all had fixed prize pools of 3 million. Their format was based on the tournament series of the same name that Valve also sponsored for their first-person shooter game, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Including The International 2016 and 2017, which were considered to be the cumulative Major of their respective seasons, the series had five other events, which were the Frankfurt Major, Shanghai Major, Manila Major, Boston Major, and Kiev Major. Following the International 2017, the Majors were replaced with the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC) format due to criticism by teams and fans for Valve's non-transparent and unpredictable nature for handing out International invitations. In the DPC, teams are awarded qualification points for their performance in sponsored tournaments, with the top twelve earning direct invites to that season's International. To avoid conflicting dates with other tournaments, Valve directly manages the scheduling of them. The primary medium for professional Dota 2 coverage is through the video game live streaming platform, Twitch. For most major events, tournament coverage is done by a selection of dedicated esports organizations and personnel who provide on-site commentary, analysis, match predictions, and player interviews surrounding the event in progress, similar to traditional sporting events. Live Dota 2 games and coverage have also been simulcast on television networks around the world, such as ESPN in the United States, BBC Three in the United Kingdom, Sport1 in Germany, TV 2 Zulu in Denmark, Xinwen Lianbo in China, Astro in Malaysia, and TV5 in the Philippines.  Reception  Dota 2 received \\"universal acclaim\\" according to review aggregator Metacritic, and has been cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. In a preview of the game in 2012, Rich McCormick of PC Gamer thought that Dota 2 was \\"an unbelievably deep and complex game that offers the purest sequel to the original Defense of the Ancients. Rewarding like few others, but tough.\\" Adam Biessener, the editor who authored the announcement article for Dota 2 for Game Informer in 2010, praised Valve for maintaining the same mechanics and game balance that made Defense of the Ancients successful nearly a decade prior and Quintin Smith of Eurogamer described Dota 2 as the \\"supreme form of the MOBA which everyone else working in the genre is trying to capture like lightning in a bottle\\". The most frequently praised aspects of the game were its depth, delivery, and overall balance. Chris Thursten of PC Gamer described the gameplay as being \\"deep and rewarding\\". Martin Gaston of GameSpot complimented Valve for the artistic design and delivery of Dota 2, citing the execution of the user interface design, voice acting, and characterization as exceeding those of the game's competitors. Phill Cameron of IGN and James Kozanitis of Hardcore Gamer both praised Dota 2 for its free-to-play business model that was not affected by cosmetic items, with Kozanitis stating that Dota 2 was \\"the only game to do free-to-play right\\". Nick Kolan of IGN also agreed, comparing the game's business model to Valve's Team Fortress 2, which uses a nearly identical system. Post-release additions to the game were also praised, such as the addition of virtual reality (VR) support in 2016. Ben Kuchera of Polygon thought that spectating games in VR was \\"amazing\\", comparing it to being able to watch an American football game on television with the ability to jump onto the field at any time to see the quarterback's point of view. Chris Thursten of PC Gamer agreed, calling the experience \\"incredible\\" and unlike any other esports spectating system that existed prior to it. Sam Machkovech of Ars Technica also praised the addition, believing that the functionality could \\"attract serious attention from gamers and non- gamers alike\\". While the majority of reviewers gave Dota 2 highly positive reviews, a common criticism was that the game maintains a steep learning curve that requires exceptional commitment to overcome. While providing a moderately positive review that praised Valve's product stability, Fredrik Åslund from the Swedish division of Gamereactor described his first match of Dota 2 as one of the most humiliating and inhospitable experiences of his gaming career, citing the learning curve and players' attitudes as unwelcoming. Benjamin Danneberg of GameStar alluded to the learning curve as a \\"learning cliff\\", calling the newcomer's experience to be painful, with the tutorial feature new to the Dota franchise only being partially successful. In a review for the Metro newspaper, Dota 2 was criticized for not compensating for the flaws with the learning curve from Defense of the Ancients, as well as the sometimes hostile community, which is commonly criticized in multiplayer online battle arena games. Peter Bright of Ars Technica also directed criticism at the ability for third-party websites to allow skin gambling and betting on match results, similar to controversies that also existed with Valve's Counter- Strike: Global Offensive. Using Dota 2 as an example, Bright thought that Valve had built gambling elements directly into their games, and had issues with the unregulated practice, which he said was often used by underage players and regions where gambling is illegal. Australian senator Nick Xenophon had similar sentiment, stating that he wanted to introduce legislation in his country to minimize underage access to gambling within video games, including Dota 2. In response to the controversy, Valve and Dota 2 project manager Erik Johnson stated that they would be taking action against the third-party sites as the practice was not allowed by their user agreements or API. Comparisons of Dota 2 to other MOBA games are commonplace, with the mechanics and business model compared to League of Legends and Heroes of the Storm. Contrasting it with League of Legends, T.J. Hafer of PC Gamer called Dota 2 the \\"superior experience\\", stating that he thought the game was \\"all about counterplay\\", with most of the heroes being designed to directly counter another. Hafer also preferred the way the game handled its hero selection pool, with all of them being unlocked right from the start, unlike in League of Legends. Comparing Dota 2 to Heroes of the Storm, Jason Parker of CNET said that while Heroes of the Storm was easier to get into, the complexities and depth of Dota 2 would be appreciated more by those who put in the time to master it. Further comparing it to Heroes of Newerth, players from the professional Dota 2 team OG said that most Heroes of Newerth players were able to transition over easily to the game, due to the strong similarities that both games share. Similar to other highly competitive online games, Dota 2 is often considered to have a hostile and \\"toxic\\" community. In 2019, a report by the Anti-Defamation League found that up to 79% of the game's playerbase had reported being harassed in some way while playing it, which topped their list.  Awards  Following its reveal in 2011, Dota 2 won IGN's People's Choice Award. In December 2012, PC Gamer listed Dota 2 as a nominee for their Game of the Year award, as well as the best esports game of the year. In 2013, Dota 2 won the esport game of the year award from PC Gamer and onGamers. GameTrailers also awarded the game the award for Best PC Game of 2013, with IGN also awarding it the Best PC Strategy & Tactics Game, Best PC Multiplayer Game, and People's Choice Award. Similarly, Game Informer recognized Dota 2 for the categories of Best PC Exclusive, Best Competitive Multiplayer and Best Strategy of 2013. The same year, Dota 2 was nominated for several awards by Destructoid. While the staff selected StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, Dota 2 received the majority of the votes distributed between the nine nominees. Dota 2 was later nominated for the best multiplayer game at the 10th British Academy Games Awards in 2014, but lost to Grand Theft Auto V, and was nominated for Esports Game of the Year at The Game Awards at its events from 2015–2019, while winning the award for best MOBA at the 2015 Global Game Awards. The game was also nominated for the community created \\"Love/Hate Relationship\\" award at the inaugural Steam Awards in 2016. In the late 2010s, the game was nominated for Choice Video Game at the 2017 Teen Choice Awards, for Esports Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards and NAVGTR Awards, and as IGN best spectator game.  Legacy  A fan cosplaying as Juggernaut, one of the game's 119 playable characters A month prior to its official launch, Dota 2 was already the most played game on Steam with a concurrent player count of nearly 330,000, which outweighed the number of players for the rest of platform's top ten most-played games combined. It remained as the most played game by concurrent players on the platform for four years, having a peak of over one million and never dropping below first place for any extended period of time until being surpassed by PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds in 2017. Viewership and followings of professional Dota 2 leagues and tournaments are also popular, with peak viewership numbers of some events reaching upwards in the millions. Some Asian schools and universities, such as the Asia Pacific University of Technology & Innovation in Malaysia, have held courses teaching students the fundamentals and core skills to use for the game. Dota 2 has also been a part of multi-sport events in Asia, such as the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games and Southeast Asian Games. The Aegis of Champions The popularity of Dota 2 led Valve to produce apparel, accessories, figurines, and several other products featuring the heroes and other elements from the game. In addition, Valve secured licensing contracts with third-party producers; the first of these deals concerned a Dota 2 themed SteelSeries mousepad, which was announced alongside the game at Gamescom 2011. In September 2012, Weta Workshop, the prop studio that creates the \\"Aegis of Champions\\" trophy for winners of The International, announced a product line that would include statues, weapons, and armor based on characters and items from the game. In February 2013, the National Entertainment Collectibles Association announced a new toy line featuring hero-themed action figures at the American International Toy Fair. At Gamescom 2015, an HTC Vive virtual reality (VR) tech demo based around the shopkeeper of the game's item shop was showcased, allowing participants to interact with various items and objects from the game in VR. The demo, known as Secret Shop, was later included the following year on The Lab, Valve's virtual reality compilation game. After the conclusion of The International 2015, Valve awarded the Collector's Aegis of Champions, a brass replica of the Aegis of Champions award trophy, to those with compendiums of 1,000 levels or more. Valve awarded the Collector's Aegis again the following year for The International 2016, as well as selling a limited edition Dota 2 themed HTC Vive virtual reality headset during the event. In July 2017, an 18-track official soundtrack was released by Ipecac Recordings, including a version on vinyl. A digital collectible card game based on the universe of Dota 2 and designed by Magic: The Gathering creator Richard Garfield and Valve, Artifact, was released in November 2018. Promotional tie- ins to other video games and media have been added to Dota 2 since release, including custom Half-Life 2, Bastion, Portal, The Stanley Parable, Rick and Morty, Fallout 4, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, and Darkest Dungeon announcer packs, which replace the game's default announcer with ones based on those franchises. In addition to announcer packs, well-known musical artists have written music packs that can replace the game's default soundtrack, such as electronic music artist deadmau5 and Singaporean songwriter JJ Lin. To coincide with the Windows release of Square Enix's Final Fantasy Type-0 HD in August 2015, a bundle containing a custom loading screen, a Moogle ward, and a Chocobo courier were added the same month. In April 2016, Valve announced a cross-promotional workshop contest for Sega's Total War: Warhammer, with the winning entries being included in the game later that year. In 2017, a cosmetic set based on the Companion Cube from the Portal series was released as part of that year's International battle pass for the hero known as \\"Io\\". In December of the same year, the character Amaterasu from Capcom's Ōkami was included as a courier for those who had pre-ordered the PC release of the game. Physical props, based on items from the game, being sold as merchandise at The International 2012 A documentary on the game and its professional scene was produced by Valve and released in March 2014. Known as Free to Play, the film follows three players during their time at the first International in 2011. American basketball player Jeremy Lin, who was a media sensation at the time, had a guest appearance in the film, calling the game \\"a way of life\\". Lin later compared the game and the esports scene in general to basketball and other traditional sporting events, saying that there was not much of a difference between the two, while also comparing various NBA all-stars, such as Stephen Curry, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James, to different heroes in the game. Starting in 2016, Valve began producing an episodic documentary series titled True Sight, a spiritual successor to Free to Play. The first three episodes followed the professional teams Evil Geniuses and Fnatic during the Boston Major tournament in late 2016. More episodes were released over the next few years, focusing on the grand finals of several major tournaments, including the International. Valve have also endorsed cosplay competitions featuring the game's heroes, which take place during downtime at some Dota 2 tournaments and feature prize pools of their own. Creation of Dota 2-themed animations and CGI videos, mostly created by the community with Source Filmmaker, also take place. Similar to the cosplay competitions, Valve holds short film contests every year at The International, with winners of the competition also being awarded prize money. In addition, Valve have created free webcomics featuring some of the heroes, further detailing their background lore. A physical collection of the comics was released as Dota 2: The Comic Collection by Dark Horse Comics in August 2017. Dota 2 has also been used in machine learning experiments, with the American artificial intelligence research company OpenAI curating a system, known as the OpenAI Five, that allows bots to learn how to play the game at a high skill level entirely through trial-and-error algorithms. The bots learn over time by playing against itself hundreds a times a day for months in a system that OpenAI calls \\"reinforcement learning\\", in which they are rewarded for actions such as killing an enemy and destroying towers. Demonstrations of the bots playing against professional players have occurred at some events, such as Dendi, a professional Ukrainian player of the game, losing to one of them in a live 1v1 matchup at The International 2017. A year later, the ability of the bots had increased to work together as a full team of five, known as the OpenAI Five, who then played and won against a team of semi-professional players in a demonstration game in August 2018. Shortly after, OpenAI Five then played two live games against more skilled players at The International 2018. Although the bots lost both games, OpenAI considered it a successful venture by stating that playing against some of the best players in Dota 2 allowed them to analyze and adjust their algorithms for future games.

The colonia’s borders are formed by the following roads: Calzada de San Simon to the south, Jacarandas to the north, Avenida de los Insurgentes Norte to the east and Jacarandas to the west. The official establishment of the colonia occurred in 1910, but there had been named streets and laid out blocks for some time before this. The land here belonged to the El Chopo Ranch before much of it was sold and eventually subdivided. The government order establishing the colonia mandates the conservation of the layout and street names. However, the colonia did not receive its name until 1950, when it was expanded. The area was originally conceived to be residential, but much of it became industrial. Today, much of the area is still industrial, with major facilities such as those belonging to Unilever on Rio Consulado. Area schools include Cecyt Num. 12, Jose Maria Morelos y Pavon technical school (public), Colegio Bilingue Madison primary (private), and Escuela Secundaria y Preparatoria Justo Sierra, Plantel Azahares (middle and high school) (private) . The Tren Suburbano commuter line crosses through the colonia as it connects downtown Mexico City with suburbs to the north of the city. Neighbors both in this colonia and neighboring Colonia Atlampa have complained that the train, built in the 2000s, has brought more crime to an area that already has serious problems of this type. They also claim that the rail line causes traffic jams, especially as the trains go over the speed limit and disregard traffic signals on streets such as Geranio, San Simon, Mimosas and Cipres. Even without the suburban train, traffic is problematic in the colonia. One bad intersection, reported by El Universal newspaper, is Eje 2 Norte and Geranio, where micros (small privately owned busses) routinely ignore traffic signals and police are either non- existent. On a number of other roads, driver frequently take shortcuts over roads going against traffic. Streets such as Oyamel, Abedules and Mimosas have many potholes. The colonia has long had crime problems especially from youths as they leave school for the day. Crimes include vandalism, drug use and sales and the stealing of cars. Residents claim that they have appealed to city and federal authorities for help but with no response. The colonia is home to one major tianguis, or open flea market, which is a cultural heritage from the pre-Hispanic era. It is called El Nopal. While it sells food, clothing and other everyday items, it has also been accused of trafficking in arms and other contraband. The Glorieta de la Raza is located on the extreme northeast of the colonia, and is a large 5-lane traffic circle with the Monumento a la Raza (Monument to the Race) in the center. It is an extremely busy intersection connecting Insurgentes Norte, Vallejo and Circuito Interior arteries. It was originally designed for cars and light trucks but many tractor trailers also use the intersection as well. This and speeding has caused frequent accidents on this circle.

(1990). Who's Who in South African Politics Vol 3. Johannesburg: Ravan Press (Pty) Ltd. Early life Bennett Alexander was the third child of Estelle and Johann Alexander, a labourer in Kimberley, the city where he grew up. He matriculated from the William Pescod High School, Kimberley, in 1975. Following initial employment with the South African government Department of Manpower, until 1981, Alexander served for a year on a Christian youth team which travelled around Zimbabwe and South Africa, before he moved to Johannesburg where he worked as a sale representative \\"Benny (!Khoisan X) Alexander\\". SAHO. Accessed: 10 October 2018 for a pharmaceutical company. Labour activist At this time Alexander helped to form the Black Health and Allied Workers Union of South Africa, serving as a senior shop steward and vice-chairperson of the local shop stewards’ committee. He also chaired the union's national advisory committee. From 1986 he took up full-time employment with the South African Black Municipal and Allied Workers Union, an affiliate of the National Council of Trade Unions (Nactu). Political career In 1989 Alexander became personal aide to Zephania Mothopeng, President of the Pan- Africanist Congress, following his release from Robben Island. He accompanied Mothopeng to the United States and the United Kingdom, April to August 1989, taking in Kenya and Zimbabwe (where the Organisation of African Unity was meeting). On his return later that year Alexander was a founding member and elected as first General Secretary of the Pan-Africanist Movement, a legal front for the PAC. He was elected to the same position at the PAC's first congress after its unbanning in 1990. Alexander used Zeph Mothopeng's memorial service in 1990 to urge PAC supporters to intensify the armed struggle against the Nationalist Government, who had agreed to an initial sit down with the relevant stakeholders at the negotiating table.\\"Armed Struggle Must Be Stepped Up: PAC\\". The Citizen. 30 October 1990. Accessed: 10 October 2018 He had differing views to the African National Congress when it came to structuring policies on land redistribution.

Princeton University Press. Accessed: 10 October 2018 In 1993 he became chief negotiator for the Pan African Congress during South Africa's constitutional dialogue, but Patricia De Lille soon replaced him. Shortly after the 1994 elections Benny Alexander changed his name to Khoisan X as a political statement against South Africa's colonial past. Khoisan X was disturbed by the number of votes the National Party received from the Coloured voters in the Western Cape. This he partly attributed to the historical assimilation of the KhoiKhoi and San communities into the Cape Colony's eurocentric ways of organising society:.Spencer, J (P. 99) \\"The New Colored People: The Mixed-Race Movement in America\\".

Originally a native of France, It's believed Belly arrived in Louisiana in 1774, where he received his first tract of land-for 3,756 acres in the form of a land grant from Spanish colonial government. Pierre also received five more land grants (three from the Spanish government and two from the US government) totalling about 4,898 acres. Pierre had an extensive and successful military career serving as an officer with the Spanish colonial militia and participated in the Galvez expedition against the British in 1779 commanding a force of 120 men. He retired from the militia in 1792, but later took up arms against the British alongside his son-in-law in the defense of New Orleans during the war of 1812. In 1805, Pierre also served as one of the first officials appointed to local government in Iberville Parish, and between 1805 and 1807 he served as a civil judge for the parish.  Early life and career  Pierre Belly was born 17 August 1738 at Mormon, France (now Maurenon) on his family's estate in Eyrans, a small village near Blaye, north of Bordeaux. He was the son of Jean Belly, a textile merchant, who was the son of Jean Belly and Renee Billoneau, and Valerie Goyer de la Rochette, a daughter of Pierre Goyer de la Rochette and Francoise Videau. Valerie's father, Pierre Goyer de la Rochette, was a royal engineer who also resided in Eyrans. Pierre's father founded a textile firm in 1729 in partnership with Pierre de Saint Aigan. Jean, the eldest son, later inherited the family estate. Upon Jean's death in 1753, Valerie and their four minor children, Etienne, Pierre, Jean-Baptiste and Marguerite were left with many debts. Valerie, after many court appearances, received the family estate of Mornon and renounced all claim to the textile business. Pierre (aka Peter) and Pedro, received several large Spanish land grants, the first being 3,756 acres in the then Iberville District, the Baltimore Tract. This land grant lies in what is now known as the White Castle area and encompasses parts of White Castle and Texas plantations. Though primarily a planter, he also supplied lumber to the Spanish colonial government. In 1786, Pierre and business partner Nicholas de Verbois agreed to supply masts and spars to the King of Spain. Later in life Pierre was among the first officials appointed for Iberville Parish and served as a civil judge from 1805 to 1807. In August 1779, Pierre received a shipment of 30 slaves from his agent in Jamaica, including Marie Rose (b 1768 - August 14, 1828). Her arrival in Louisiana on board the ship La Golondrina (The Swallow) marked the beginning of a long relationship with Pierre that lasted nearly 35 years and produced six daughters, Rosalie (b 1785), Marie Marguerite Antoinette (b 1786), Marie Genevieve (b 1788), Marie Francoise Manette (b 1799), Valerie Octavine (b 1802), Heloise Marguerite (b 1808). Pierre and Rose lived as husband and wife using the courts to make their relationship to one another public and official and proclaim their children as their own. Pierre and Rose were able to use these legal means to shape a story about their family insisting the courts recognize them as a lawful family though they were unable to marry because the law forbade marriage between blacks and whites. They affirmed their \\"marriage\\" in legal documents in various ways. In several legal documents involving Rose some were initiated by Pierre and others initiated by Rose, Pierre and Rose gave her name as \\"Rose Belly\\" or \\"commonly called Rose Belly. When Pierre transferred property to Rose and their daughters, he signified their ties to one another, strengthened those bonds through shared ownership, and made those connections official and public before the courts. Rose likely enjoyed considerable independence, she was not dependent on Pierre for her livelihood or the livelihood of her daughters. Through property ownership and the independence it provided her, Rose (like other black women in the region) exercised a civic personality and claimed space for herself.  Death & Legacy  At the time of Pierre’s death in 1814 his holdings were in excess of 8,500 acres (five individual plantations were included). When Pierre died in 1814 he was the wealthiest planter and largest land and slave owner in Iberville Parish. Pierre and Rose were buried on their plantation. The remains were later removed to a large family tomb in the St. Raphael Cemetery at Bayou Goula, Iberville Parish, Louisiana, built in 1860 by Pierre Cyprien Ricard, their grandson, and lying some miles upriver from their original home. The tomb can still be seen today, a bit battered, but nonetheless impressive. Pierre and Rose's love story is famous in the countryside there.

In its retrospective review, AllMusic wrote that the album \\"failed to live up to the promise of the single [\\"Ghosts of Princes in Towers\\"], in most cases trading punky power-pop in favor of more dirge-like hard rock – muddy sound doesn't help matters either.\\" Trouser Press wrote that \\"despite abysmal sound, the band's talent emerges, and Ghosts is an extraordinary album of daring experimental rock/pop\\".

She is best known for her portrait of Tony Blair created using the handwritten names of fallen British soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan, titled Their families have been told. The web page for Wright's portrait of Stephen Fry received 8,000 hits in two hours after being mentioned by Fry on Twitter. Wright has exhibited in numerous art shows worldwide since her career began, including the 2013 London Art Fair. Wright held her first Solo exhibition at London's Woolff Gallery in March 2011. Response from the public Wright's portrait of Blair caused a great deal of controversy from the parents of the soldiers who died. Carol Jones, mother of 31-year-old sergeant John Jones, who was killed whilst serving in Iraq in 2005, said \\"I hate Tony Blair and I hold him responsible for my son’s death, but I don’t want his name put on Tony Blair’s face\\". Ann Probyn, whose son, Daniel, died in Afghanistan, described Annemarie's work as honest. \\"This piece of art seems like an honest and very good idea. Me and my husband blame Tony Blair for sending our boy to his death and this is an imaginative way of holding him to account for that\\". The Blair portrait is part of a growing collection of handwritten images by Annemarie called \\"Scandals – art that rocked the world\\", which also contains a picture of the Twin Towers created using the names of the victims that died in the 9/11 terror attack (which is featured on the 9/11 Memorial Site ) and a picture of Michael Jackson made up of child abuse allegations. Other notable works In 2012, Wright completed an artwork of David Cameron based on public responses to the question, What Do you Think of David Cameron ?. The work was exhibited in Number Nine The Gallery during the Conservative Party Conference 2012, held in October in Birmingham. The work has since been purchased by an unnamed member of the House Of Lords, after being exhibited as part of London Art Fair in 2013.

Life She was the daughter of Andrew Thomson Esq., of Roehampton, a London merchant, and was born in London in 1757 and educated at home. In 1783 she married James Ibbetson at Bushey in Hertfordshire. He was the eldest son the Rev. James Ibbetson, rector of Bushey and Archdeacon of St. Albans. James, junior, was a barrister and amateur antiquary who had been admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1771, but he died in 1790 aged 35 leaving Agnes a widow. Sometime after James's death she moved to Devon where she lived for the rest of her life. She died on 9 February 1823 in Exmouth, aged 66. Her nephew was Charles Poulett Thomson, who was a politician and become the first Governor of Canada, being raised to the peerage as Baron Syndenham. Ibbetson was left with an annuity and comfortable financial circumstances. Work Though isolated from the contemporary scientific community, Ibbetson began publishing her plant physiology in her fifties, and approached her work with an observational and experimental bent. Ibbetson made extensive use of microscopes, plant dissection, and other technology to pursue her studies, and believed that plant functions had mechanical explanations. Between 1809 and 1822 Mrs. Ibbetson contributed more than fifty papers to Nicholson's Journal and the Philosophical Magazine on the microscopic structure and physiology of plants, including such subjects as air-vessels, pollen, perspiration, sleep, winter- buds, grafting, impregnation, germination, and the Jussieuean method. In the botanical department of the British Museum are preserved some specimens of woods and microscopic slides prepared by her, with a manuscript description stating that they represent twenty-four years' work, and illustrating her erroneous belief that buds originate endogenously and force their way outward. Legacy The leguminous genus Ibbetsonia was dedicated to her by John Sims, but is now considered identical with the Cyclopia of Ventenat.

Christy, 162 U.S. 283 (1896),. was the first litigation of aboriginal title in the United States by a tribal plaintiff in the Supreme Court of the United States since Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831). It was the first such litigation by an indigenous plaintiff since Fellows v. Blacksmith (1857) and its companion case of New York ex rel. Cutler v. Dibble (1858). The New York courts held that the 1788 Phelps and Gorham Purchase did not violate the Nonintercourse Act, one of the provisions of which prohibits purchases of Indian lands without the approval of the federal government, and that (even if it did) the Seneca Nation of New York was barred by the state statute of limitations from challenging the transfer of title. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the merits of lower court ruling because of the adequate and independent state grounds doctrine. According to O'Toole and Tureen, \\"Christy is an important case in that it revived the concept that states had special powers to deal with Indian tribes within their borders.\\"Francis J. O'Toole & Thomas N. Tureen, \\"State Power and the Passamaquoddy Tribe: A Gross National Hypocrisy\\"; 23 1, 4 n.12 (1971). Although the case has not been formally overruled, two Supreme Court decisions in the 1970s and 1980s have undone its effect by ruling that there is federal subject-matter jurisdiction for a federal common law cause of action for recovering possession based on the common-law doctrine of aboriginal title. Moreover, the New York courts' interpretation of the Nonintercourse Act is no longer good law. Modern federal courts hold that only Congress can ratify a conveyance of aboriginal title, and only with a clear statement, rather than implicitly. Background James Clark Strong, lawyer for the Seneca Conveyance The land in question, which had been part of the Seneca Nation's traditional territory for centuries before the American Revolution, comprised part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase, a tract of land disputed after the war between claims of New York and Massachusetts. By a December 16, 1786 interstate compact, the states agreed that Massachusetts would retain the proprietary rights and the pre-emption rights, but New York would retain governmental rights.Seneca Nation, 162 U.S. at 284-85 After the adoption of the United States Constitution in 1787, the federal government ratified their compact.Seneca Nation, 162 U.S. at 285 Three private individuals--Robert Troup, Thomas L. Ogden, and Benjamin W. Rogers--obtained the proprietary and preemptive rights from Massachusetts. They executed a treaty of conveyance with the Seneca on August 31, 1826, purchasing 87,000 acres for $48,216. Massachusetts approved the conveyance, but the United States Senate was never consulted and never ratified the treaty, as required for treaties with Native American nations. In 1827, the money was deposited in Ontario Bank in Canandaigua, New York, and in 1855 it was paid to the United States treasury, which began remitting the interest to the Seneca Nation.Seneca Nation, 162 U.S. at 286 Dispute The Seneca Nation could not have brought the lawsuit until 1845, when the New York legislature granted the nation the right to bring suits in courts of law and equity.Act of May 8, 1845, ch. 150, § 1, 1845 N.Y. Laws. The Seneca filed a petition with the Bureau of Indian Affairs on January 5, 1881, requesting restoration and possession of certain lands related to the Phelps and Gorham Purchase. This petition was ignored by the BIA. The Seneca hired the lawyer James Clark Strong to represent them, a \\"prominent lawyer and civic-minded resident of Buffalo.\\" Strong was a former lieutenant colonel in the Union army (brevetted to general after the war). He had a permanent limp from his wounds in the American Civil War. At the law practice of his brother, John C. Strong, he had also represented the Cayuga in a claim against New York state. Procedural history=New York trial court The Seneca brought suit in the Circuit Court of Erie County, New York on October 13, 1885. The Seneca requested the ejectment of Harrison B. Christy from 100 acres of land in the town of Brant, New York (purchased from the Ogden Land Company), known as the \\"mile strip.\\" These lands were formerly part of the Cattaraugus Indian Reservation, as established by the New York Treaty of Big Tree (1797). The Seneca contended that the purchase was invalid because the treaty was not approved by the Senate, as required by the Constitution; therefore it violated the Nonintercourse Act. Christy's \\"answer consisted of a general denial, the plea of the statute of limitations of 20 years, and that the plaintiff had not the legal right, title, capacity, or authority to maintain the action.\\"Seneca Nation, 162 U.S. at 284. New York intermediate appellate court The Seneca claim disputed the Phelps and Gorham Purchase. The General Term of the Fifth Department of the New York Supreme Court heard the intermediate appeal.Seneca Nation of Indians v. Christy, 2 N.Y.S. 546 (Sup. Ct. 1888). Bradley J., writing for himself and Dwight J.J., affirmed. The court considered whether the Indians had properly surrendered the land and whether the consideration had been paid. As to the first question, the court noted that, while \\"in view of the known habits of Indians they may not be supposed to represent their occupation or possession by improvements or inclosures of all or great portions of their lands\\": > [I]n this case the abandonment and surrender were not only practically made, > but have been characterized by such circumstances and by such recognition, > not only by the Indians, but by the government, in such manner as to > determine the situation, and in legal effect to sever the prior relation of > the Indians to the lands from them. The quantity of land covered by the > treaty of conveyance was large.Seneca Nation, 2 N.Y.S. at 549-50. The court cited Johnson v. M'Intosh (1823) for the proposition that: \\"[t]he title of the Indians was possessory, and embraced the right of occupancy only. And when abandoned by them the possession attached itself to the fee of the lands.\\"Seneca Nation, 2 N.Y.S. at 551. As to the second question, the court noted: > The suggestion that the entire amount of the purchase money was not paid, > and that such fact is in the way of supporting the claim to the Indian > title, is not sustained. We are not called upon to consider the effect of > default in payment of any portion of the purchase money. The treaty recites > the payment of it, and as no such question seems ever before to have been > raised, or full payment questioned, either by government or the Indians, it > must at this late day be assumed, until the contrary is quite clearly made > to appear, that the contract in that respect was performed. Finally, the court noted: > The plaintiff not being a corporation, and having no such corporate name, > could not at common law maintain an action. This right, however, was more > than 40 years ago conferred by statute, which, among other things, provides > that the Seneca Nation of Indians may maintain any action of ejectment to > recover the possession of any part of the Allegany and Cattaraugus > reservations unlawfully withheld from them.Seneca Nation, 2 N.Y.S. at 551 > (internal citation omitted). As a result, the intermediate appellate court did not reach the question of whether the statute of limitation applies.Seneca Nation, 2 N.Y.S. at 551 (\\"The further question presented and by counsel discussed is whether the statute of limitations is applicable, and a bar to the plaintiff's right of action. In the view taken the determination of that question is not essential, and for that reason it has no consideration on this review.\\"). New York Court of Appeals New York State Court Chief Justice Charles Andrews held that the conveyances were valid under the Nonintercourse Act, and that the claim was barred by the state statute of limitations. Chief Justice Charles Andrews, writing for a unanimous New York Court of Appeals, affirmed.Seneca Nation of Indians v. Christy, 27 N.E. 275 (N.Y. 1891). ;Validity of the transaction After reviewing the facts, Andrews began by arguing that there were many ways to extinguish aboriginal title. He said: \\"It is material to observe that there was no uniform procedure on the part of the purchasers from Massachusetts in acquiring the Indian title,\\" and gave examples of conveyances he believed to have been implicitly ratified by the federal government.Seneca Nation, 27 N.E. at 277-78. As to the Seneca argument that, after the ratification of the Constitution, only the federal government could extinguish aboriginal title, Andrews noted that: > These claims challenge the title not only of every purchaser and holder of > lands within the boundaries of the grant of August 31, 1826, but also the > title to many millions of acres of lands in this state, held under Indian > treaties made by the state of New York with the Indian tribes within its > borders, or under grants made by Indians to individuals under the authority > of the state, where no treaty had been made between the United States and > the Indian occupants.Seneca Nation, 27 N.E. at 278. Andrews expressed the view that the U.S. states, not the federal government, inherited from Great Britain the sole power to extinguish aboriginal title: > On the Declaration of Independence the colonies became sovereign states. > They were so acknowledged by the treaty of peace of 1783, and Great Britain > by that treaty ‘relinquished all claims to the government, property, and > territorial rights' within the several colonies. It is the received opinion > that the colonies succeeded to the title of the crown to all the ungranted > lands within their respective boundaries, with the exclusive right to > extinguish by purchase the Indian title, and to regulate dealings with the > Indian tribes. ‘There was no territory in the United States,’ said JOHNSON, > J., in Harcourt v. Gaillard, 12 Wheat. 523, ‘that was claimed in any other > right than that of one of the confederated states; therefore there could be > no acquisition of territory made by the United States distinct from or > independent of some one of the United States.’ Andrews rejected the argument that the federal government had acquired Indian lands by treaty out of a legal requirement to do so: > But the dealing by the general government with the Indian tribes through > treaties was resorted to as a convenient mode of regulating Indian affairs, > and not because, as with other nations, it was the only mode, independently > of the arbitrament of war, of dealing with them.Seneca Nation, 27 N.E. at > 279. Andrews relied upon the argument of federal acquiescence: > The practical construction given by the state of New York to the federal > constitution, as shown by the numerous treaties made by it with the Indian > tribes, and the recognition by the federal authority of their validity, is > very strong evidence that the clause in the federal constitution prohibiting > the states from entering into treaties does not preclude a state, having the > preemption right to Indian lands, from dealing with the Indian tribes > directly, for the extinguishment of the Indian title.Seneca Nation, 27 N.E. > at 280. ;Effect of the Nonintercourse Act As to the Nonintercourse Act, Andrews questioned both whether it applied to purchases by a state and whether it applied to purchases within a state.Seneca Nation, 27 N.E. at 280-81. However, Andrews proceed to assume that the Act applied and held that it had not been violated.Seneca Nation, 27 N.E. at 281 (\\"But, assuming that the statute applies to the transaction of August 31, 1826, we are of opinion that the purchase then made was not in violation of the true meaning and effect of the twelfth section.\\"). Andrews proceeded to argue that the treaty requirement of the Act was satisfied by state treaties: > The purchase must be made at a treaty, as in other cases. This insures > publicity, and affords a protection against fraud. But the proviso does not > require that the treaty should be one between the United States and the > tribe from whom the purchase is made, as in the cases coming under the first > clause of the section. It is sufficient if the purchase is made at a treaty > held ‘under the authority of the United States,’ and in the ‘presence and > with the approbation of the commissioner or commissioners of the United > States,’ etc.Seneca Nation, 27 N.E. at 281. Andrews also placed reliance on the fact that later versions of the Act excluded the clause \\"or to any state, whether having the right of pre-emption or not\\" and instead simply prohibited acquisitions by persons. ;Applicability of the statute of limitations Independently, Andrews indicated he would have dismissed the action under the statute of limitations: > We are also of opinion that as the right of the plaintiff to sue was given > by, and is dependent upon, the statute, the statute of limitations is a bar > to the action. By the act of 1845, the actions thereby authorized are to be > brought and maintained ‘in the same time’ as if brought by citizens of the > state. The question is not whether an Indian title can be barred by adverse > possession, or by state statutes of limitation. The point is that the > plaintiff cannot invoke the special remedy given by the statute, without > being bound by the conditions upon which it is given.Seneca Nation, 27 N.E. > at 282 (citations omitted). Andrews emphasized this latter ground because of his desire to prevent any similar lands claims by Indian tribes: > In view of the numerous Indian titles in this state originating in treaties > by the state, or in purchases made with its sanction by individuals, we > prefer to place our judgment on the broader ground, which will remove any > cloud upon the validity of those titles.Seneca Nation, 27 N.E. at 282. Opinion U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Melville Fuller declined to reach the merits because of the doctrine of adequate and independent state grounds. Chief Justice Melville Fuller, for a unanimous Court, dismissed the writ of error, relying on the adequate and independent state grounds for the New York Court of Appeals' decision. After reviewing the facts and the judgment below, he wrote that: > The proper construction of this enabling act, and the time within which an > action might be brought and maintained thereunder, it was the province of > the state courts to determine. > The Seneca Nation availed itself of the act in bringing this action, which > was subject to the provision, as held by the court of appeals, that it could > only be brought and maintained ‘in the same manner and within the same time > as if brought by citizens of this state in relation to their private > individual property and rights.’ Under the circumstances, the fact that the > plaintiff was an Indian tribe cannot make federal questions of the correct > construction of the act and the bar of the statute of limitations. > As it appears that the decision of the court of appeals was rested, in > addition to other grounds, upon a distinct and independent ground, not > involving any federal question, and sufficient in itself to maintain the > judgment, the writ of error falls within the wellsettled rule on that > subject, and cannot be maintained.Seneca Nation, 162 U.S. at 289-90 > (internal citations omitted). Legacy A 19th-century New York Times article claimed that \\"[t]he decision is one of local, state, and national importance alike . . . .\\"\\"The Treaty Upheld: And with it the Title to Lands Acquired from the Indians\\", N.Y. Times, Apr. 24, 1891 In 1998 Prof. Hauptman summed up the case by the following: > The Treaties of 1823 and 1826, although fraudulent at their roots, were > allowed to stand. The legal obstacles to Indian land suits at the time made > it almost impossible to obtain redress until monetary compensation was > awarded the Senecas under the Indian Claims Commission in the late 1960s and > early 1970s. Seneca Nation has never been overruled. But, the effect of the decision was undone by rulings in Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. State v. Oneida County (1974), known as Oneida I, and Oneida County v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. State (1985), known as Oneida II, which held that there is a federal common law cause of action for ejectment based upon aboriginal title for which there is federal subject-matter jurisdiction. Therefore, Indian tribes no longer have to rely on state statutes for a cause of action.

Background \\"The Windows of the World\\" represented a thematic departure for Warwick who had built her career as a romantic balladeer and had passed on the chance to introduce \\"What the World Needs Now is Love\\" (although her stated objection to the last-named was not its theme but rather that it sounded \\"too country\\"). The track was recorded in a 13 April 1967 session produced by Bacharach and David with Bacharach as conductor and arranger. Bacharach and David had scored a number 7 hit in 1965 with Jackie DeShannon's message song hit \\"What the World Needs Now is Love\\" but \\"The Windows of the World\\" was unique in the composers' canon in being a protest song. Inspired by such songs as \\"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\\" and \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\", Hal David wrote lyrics for \\"The Windows of the World\\" which overtly but gently lament U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War (an especial concern to David, who had two young sons, one of them almost of eligible age for the draft). The arrangement for \\"The Windows of the World\\" has a subtle Asian flavor featuring strings plucked in the style of a koto and also finger cymbals the latter evoking the sound of raindrops on a window. Chart performance Released in July 1967, \\"The Windows of the World\\" was not one of Warwick's biggest hits, reaching number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 27 on the R&B; charts. \\"The Windows of the World\\" was also a minor hit on the Easy Listening chart, where it peaked at number 32.

It is assigned to the 53d Test and Evaluation Group at Creech Air Force Base, Nevada, and conducts unmanned aircraft testing. Mission The 556th Test and Evaluation Squadron is the Air Force's first operational test squadron for unmanned aircraft. It provides support to UAS operations worldwide, through force development evaluations, the development of training, tactics and procedures, systems expertise and meeting warfighters' urgent need requests. History The 556th designation was reactivated by Air Combat Command for its current mission due to its lineage and long history of surveillance and intelligence-gathering. World War II The squadron was constituted on 9 June 1942 as the 15th Photographic Mapping Squadron and activated on 20 June at Colorado Springs Army Air Base. Components of the squadron deployed to England for combat training by the Royal Air Force, while the remainder of squadron received aircraft and ground training in Oklahoma. Deployed to Algeria in early December 1942 as part of Operation Torch invasion forces, the squadron became the main source of aerial intelligence for Twelfth Air Force in the North African Campaign. It supported United States Fifth Army in its drive across Algeria and during the Tunisian Campaign during 1942 and 1943. The 15th flew air reconnaissance and mapping missions over Sicily and Southern Italy prior to Allied invasions during 1943. On 6 February 1943, it was redesignated as the 15th Photographic Squadron (Heavy). It was reassigned to Fifteenth Air Force in December 1943, flying numerous long distance reconnaissance flights over the Balkans, Occupied Europe and Germany, photographing targets for later attack by Fifteenth Air Force and Twelfth Air Force bombers. The squadron obtained intelligence about enemy fortifications, armored units, infantry concentrations and other tactical intelligence. These flights were extremely hazardous, being flown without escort and in unarmed aircraft. On 21 January 1944 it became a combat mapping squadron with the same number, but was again renamed the 15th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron on 31 August. After the surrender of Germany, the unit gradually demobilized and was inactivated in Italy on 28 October 1945. = Postwar = On 29 April 1947, the squadron became the 15th Reconnaissance Squadron (Photographic), and was reactivated on 19 May 1947 at Langley Field with the 67th Reconnaissance Group of Tactical Air Command, operating the F-6 Mustang, a photo reconnaissance variant of the famed P-51 Mustang fighter. After transferring to the 10th Reconnaissance Group on 24 July, it moved to Lawson Field on 8 September and to Pope Field on 1 October. Due to funding and manpower shortages, the squadron was inactivated on 3 December, and its equipment and personnel were merged into the senior 15th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron. 556th Reconnaissance Squadron In 1968 the unit was reorganized as the 556th Reconnaissance Squadron, being formed from the equipment and personnel of the :: Assuming personnel and equipment of 6091st Reconnaissance Squadron and placed under the PACAF 347th Tactical Fighter Wing at Yokota Air Base, Japan. The squadron, however operated in a deployed status from Bien Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam. All the drones were carried and started from specially modified GC-130As, MC-130AS and – finally – DC-130A and DC-130E control aircraft, each equipped with systems for carriage, start, control and guidance of drones. The drones were always pre-programmed, but after release their progress was monitored and the drone controller could override the programme manually if necessary. The carrier aircraft had a console for two controller pilots equipped with all the usual flight instruments, which read the data sent to them from the drone. All data about the navigation, planned route, actual flight pad and position of the drone, and the carrier aircraft were fed into a single system which showed them on one display. On their return the drones deployed a parachute and were snared by specially modified CH-3E recovery helicopters. From 1969, first serious encounters with North Vietnamese MiG-17 and MiG-21 interceptors followed. In 1969 alone, North Vietnamese fighters – primarily MiG-21s – were scrambled no less than 540 times in order to intercept drones, claiming to have shot down ten AQM-34s. NVAF MiGs did score 6 kills, and some were scored indirectly by Americans. In May 1970, an AQM-34L photo reconnaissance drone was on a mission over Hanoi area, acting as a manned reconnaissance aircraft. Finishing its photo run, the drone turned toward the Tonkin Gulf where it was to ditch after expending its fuel. Almost everything was going according to plan, down to one detail: the drone was intercepted by an MiG-21. The fighter closed and tried to shoot it down by two K-13/AA-2 Atoll air-to-air missiles. Both malfunctioned however, and the Vietnamese continued the pursuit, trying to down the drone by tackling its wing. By doing so, the NVAF pilot forgot to control his fuel reserves: after the drone fell harmlessly into the sea, his aircraft ran out of fuel. The NVAF pilot ejected while flying back toward the coast. This was the first air-to-air kill scored by an unmanned aircraft in the history of air warfare. In addition to the drone operations, the squadron received significant amounts of intelligence operating an RB-57F Canberra from Yokota, detached from the MAC 9th Weather Reconnaissance Wing at McClellan Air Force Base, California. The RB-57 provided very high altitude intelligence with regards to SA-2 locations for mission planning with the AQM-34 low altitude reconnaissance drones. As part of the drawdown of United States forces from South Vietnam the 556th was officially moved to Yokota Air Base, Japan in 1971, although limited operations continued from Bien Hoa until 30 Jun 1972 when the squadron was inactivated.  Unmanned aircraft test squadron  The 556th was redesignated as a test and evaluation squadron on 16 January 2008, and reactivated on 15 February with 53d Test and Evaluation Group at Creech Air Force Base, Nevada, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Ty Moyers. The squadron was formed using the personnel and equipment of the inactivated Detachment 4 of the 53d Group, and was the first USAF Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) operational test squadron. It was to support UAS operations by providing force development evaluations and developing training, tactics, and procedures for the unmanned aircraft. The 556th received three new General Atomics MQ-1 Predator drones upon activation and was scheduled to receive another MQ-1 by the end of the year and four General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper drones beginning in 2010.

When a P-wave hits an interface (e.g., solid-liquid), it can reflect upwards as an S-wave (also known as a secondary, shear or transverse wave). Other P-wave to S-wave (P-S) conversions can occur, but the down-up conversion is the primary focus. Unlike P-waves, converted shear waves are largely unaffected by fluids. By analyzing the original and converted waves, seismologists obtain additional subsurface information, especially due to (1) differential velocity (VP/VS), (2) asymmetry in the waves' angles of incidence and reflection and (3) amplitude variations. As opposed to analysis of P-wave to P-wave (P-P) reflection, c-wave (P-S) analysis is more complex. C-wave analysis requires at least three times as many measurement channels per station. Variations in reflection depths can cause significant analytic problems. Gathering, mapping, and binning c-wave data is also more difficult than P-P data. However, c-wave analysis can provide additional information needed to create a three-dimensional depth image of rock type, structure, and saturant. For example, changes in VS with respect to VP suggest changing lithology and pore geometry.

It was established in September 2010 following the amalgamation of the two predecessor schools; Verdin High School and Woodford Lodge High School. It is located on the campus of the former Verdin High School on Grange Lane that was established in 1970 and was initially one component of a two-campus school, with history spanning from its original founding as Verdin Technical School in 1895. In September 2013, the Academy moved into a new, £20 million purpose-built school which includes 60 classrooms with flexible learning spaces; a 400-seat theatre in the Performing Arts Centre; Learning Resource Centre; sports facilities; science labs; drama and dance studios; music rehearsal rooms; media suites; art studios; technology workshops; and a Sixth Form Centre (formally). In addition to this, the Academy has spent £1.7 million on ICT.  History  The Winsford Academy was established in September 2010 following the amalgamation of the two predecessor schools; Verdin High School and Woodford Lodge High School. Its history dates back to 1895, overseeing a series of name changes as well as changes to its education and buildings.  Verdin Era: 1895–2008  The Verdin Era spans from 1895 to 2008 and partially to 2010 – all name changes to the school retained the term 'Verdin' from its original founders; The Verdin Family. The school was initially known to residents of Winsford as the 'Tec', but later, the term 'Verdin' had been used to refer to the school, rather than the family which founded it. = Origins = During the 1890s, there was a growing demand for technical education and an attempt was made by William Henry Verdin, of Darnhall Hall in Darnhall, to convert Darnhall School into a science and technical school, but was rejected in 1893. Sir Joseph Verdin, 1st Baronet and his brothers, Robert and William ran a family salt business known as Joseph Verdin & Sons (formerly Joseph and Richard Verdin), co-founded by their father, Joseph and his brother, Richard. They owned six salt plants in various locations throughout Cheshire, employed over 1,000 people and produced approximately 353,000 tons of salt annually; it was the largest salt manufacturer in the United Kingdom by 1881. Having few descendants, they used their wealth to benefit the local community. In 1889, The Verdin Trust was established by Sir Joseph Verdin to compensate people for subsidence caused by brine pumping. However, in 1891 the Brine Pumping (Compensation for Subsidence) Act was introduced to provide compensation for owners of property, thereby rendering the Trust redundant. As a result, Sir Joseph Verdin decided to use the money in other ways which includes the construction and development of the Verdin Technical Schools in Winsford and Northwich – the one in Winsford, known as Verdin Technical School, was a prototype for a second and larger one in Northwich, that eventually opened in 1897 as Verdin Technical Schools & Gymnasium (latterly in use as Cheshire School of Art and Design, which closed in 2012). The location for the Verdin Technical School in Winsford was determined when a site was bought adjacent to the Over Board School near the junction of High Street and Grange Lane. The design of the building was identified via a 'best design' competition that was won by Messrs Woodhouse and Willoughby, Architects, of Manchester. The construction was left to Messrs James Fowles and Sons, of Winsford and the building began with the foundation stone being laid down on 4 August 1894 by William Henry Verdin, Joseph's brother. On 8 August 1895, the building was officially opened by the Duke and Duchess of Westminster. The foundation stone and an inscription marking the opening ceremony can still be seen at the front of the building. = Verdin Technical School: 1895–1906 = The Verdin Technical School opened on 9 September 1895 enrolling 43 students on the first day. It housed four separate, but overlapping institutions, consisting of a day school, evening classes, gymnasium and a laundry. It \\"grew slowly at first before gaining a reputation throughout the years as one of the most enterprising in Cheshire\\".  Woodford Lodge: 1971–2008  Woodford Lodge High School (initially Woodford Lodge County Comprehensive School and Woodford Lodge County High School) was established in 1971 on a 30-acre site in the outskirts of Winsford, when it was a developing town with an increasing population. Its name remained until 2008 and partially to 2010.  Federation: 2008–2010  The former Local Authority, Cheshire County Council undertook an extensive review of educational provision and surplus places during 2007 under the Transforming Learning Communities Programme. The outcome of the review resulted in the decision to Federate Verdin High School and Woodford Lodge High School that was officially completed in January 2008, under the name 'Winsford High School Federation'. The Federation was led and managed by a Principal and a single Governing Body of 21 Governors. Both schools had a site headteacher and senior managers were appointed to the Federation, however, most aspects of provision were managed on one site. The Federation was established in preparation for another proposal, the establishment of an all- through school in Winsford by 2012. The proposal would bring together primary, secondary and special provision in Winsford as one educational establishment with hopes it would be supported by Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme. However, due to central government uncertainties, there has been a delay in the entry of 19 local authorities into the programme, including Cheshire West and Chester Council. As a result, funding has not been available for the all-through proposal. On 19 April 2008, it was announced that Mr Martin Howlett was appointed as Principal of the Winsford High School Federation, and the two site headteachers appointed were Mr Paul Harrington for Verdin High School and Mr John Foreman for Woodford Lodge High School. Both Verdin High School and Woodford Lodge High School retained their names under the Winsford High School Federation when it was established in January 2008, and its uniforms remained the same. However, under the Federation, Verdin High School was known as 'Verdin Site' and Woodford Lodge High School was known as 'Woodford Site'. The Federation had its own logo as well as two identical logos with the site names underneath to represent both schools. The former websites for both schools (\`www.verdin.cheshire.sch.uk\` and \`www.woodford.cheshire.sch.uk\`) became virtual learning environments (VLEs), with a new Federation website (\`www.wsf.cheshire.sch.uk\`) that represented and provided information for both schools respectively. On 3 March 2010, it was announced that the two Federated schools would close to make way for an Academy by as early as September 2010. There would also be a new £20 million school building that will accommodate 1,700 students (1,500 for 11–16 and 200 for post-16) and is expected to be built on a site behind the Verdin Exchange. The site was once earmarked for former Local Authority, Cheshire County Council's original plan of a £73 million all-through school, which was ruled out due to a lack of available central funding. The proposed Academy would initially run from the two existing school sites and Cheshire West and Chester Council are still hoping that \\"the Academy could still be the first stage of an eventual 'all-through education concept', which will include special schools and special needs pupils\\". A six-week public consultation programme on the proposed closure and commence this month. = Proposed academy = On 10 March 2010, the Local Authority, Cheshire West and Chester Council issued a document as the first part of the formal public consultation process and aims to provide as much information as possible on the proposal to close the two Federated schools on 31 August 2010, and replace them with one Academy on 1 September 2010 to serve the Winsford area. It also seeks to gather views from students, parents, staff, governors, the local community and other key stakeholders who are interested in the proposal. The public consultation is designed to make sure that all those involved can see and understand why the proposal is being put forward and have the opportunity to comment on and/or object to the proposal. The consultation will last 6 weeks through March/April 2010, allowing the council to gather as much feedback as possible. During this period, the sponsors will run a separate consultation on the proposed Academy. A key highlight in the proposal shows a decline in student numbers with over 600 empty places at the two Federated schools when combined, and there would be no additional funding to support the other options which have been considered. However, the Academy programme \\"provides significant capital investment for either a new building or adaptation and refurbishment\\". The council is supporting the proposal and have identified a sponsor who would have the appropriate skills and resources to support the Academy in the longer term. The sponsor will be responsible for running the Academy, should the proposal be approved and E-ACT are interested in being the sponsor, having also confirmed it would adopt the Local Authority's admission arrangements, meaning anyone could apply for a place. The proposed Academy would have 1,700 places (1,500 for 11–16 and 200 post-16) and students at the two closing Federated schools would automatically transfer to the new Academy from 1 September 2010, should they wish to do so. The Academy would open utilising the two existing school sites and the Local Authority will work with the sponsor to ensure smooth transition. Pupils that are due to transfer in Year 7 to Verdin or Woodford in September 2010 would be offered a place at the new Academy. If the proposed Academy does not go ahead, the two Federated schools would continue under its Winsford High School Federation and \\"other proposals would have to be developed to deal with the need to improve performance\\". On 21 April 2010, it was announced that the six-week public consultation is due to end today. However, concerns were raised by parents who attended a meeting held by Winsford Town Council on 19 April 2010, that 'inadequate' information was provided by Cheshire West and Chester Council. For example, Lynne Miller, who attended with her daughter – a student at Woodford Lodge, said: \\"We have not been provided with the information as promised. Everyone has a view but without the information how on earth can we respond?\\" The town council supports parents' concerns and are wanting the consultation period to be extended to December. Should the consultation not be extended, a decision will be made in a weeks' time on the proposed Academy. On 28 April 2010, it was announced that the six-week public consultation had come to an end, which was extended by five days. A meeting will be held today by the Cheshire West and Chester Council Executive Committee in Ellesmere Port where the fate will be decided in a vote open to parents and the public. Following on from the previous concerns on the two Federated schools mentioned in the first part of the formal public consultation in March 2010, the council also reported an 'alarming drop' in applications within the town (Winsford) of its two Federated schools, losing approximately a third of its secondary schools' pupils to Northwich and Middlewich. The Sixth Form numbers have also dropped, resulting in the two Federated school's decision to not offer Year 12 study from September this year, regardless of whether the proposed Academy goes ahead or not. Should the vote result in the 'go ahead', a six-week period will follow to allow further representations from parents and other stakeholders before a final decision is made. On 5 May 2010, it was announced that Cheshire West and Chester Council Executive Committee had voted in the 'go ahead', deciding on a 'statutory notice' for the closure of the two Federated schools. A six-week and final phase of consultation will now commence on the proposed Academy. On 3 June 2010, it was announced that a consultation evening was held by E-ACT last week for parents of pupils at Woodford Lodge High School. Representatives from the sponsor were there to provide information on the proposed Academy and addressed concerns to those affected by the proposal. For example, \\"parents and councillors have criticised the way the plans have been carried out after E-ACT was prevented from providing information by regulations governing publicity about anything considered political during the General Election\\". Mr Martin Howlett, Principal of Winsford High School Federation said: \\"there were obviously concerns that were put forward in the public airing but afterwards there was a general feeling of positivity. It's important to remember that we remember people don't always like change\\". A second consultation evening will be held by E-ACT for parents of pupils at Verdin High School on 7 June 2010. The E-ACT consultation ends on 2 July 2010 and a consultation document is available from the two Federated schools, containing information on the proposal and an option to comment via a pre-paid response form. On 5 July 2010, it was announced that following a meeting which was held on 2 July 2010 at Winsford Lifestyle Centre, and after hearing all- party support from Town and Borough Councillors and school Governors, members of Cheshire West and Chester Council Executive Committee have 'unanimously' agreed to the proposed plans to close the two Federated schools on 31 August 2010, subject to the Education Secretary making an agreement for a new Academy on 1 September 2010. Mrs Barbara Coldrick, Vice Chairman of the Federated Board of Governors told the meeting: \\"The Governors agree that the proposed Academy will offer more opportunities for our young people – both now and in the future\\". A preferred site for the Academy has not yet been chosen, however executive members have agreed to work together to examine the two sites in consideration; Verdin High School and Verdin Exchange and will work with local councillors to address potential problems of access and egress. The site must be agreed by 31 August 2010 to allow the Government to decide on an Academy for Winsford in time for the scheduled opening in September 2010. On 4 August 2010, it was announced that the two Federated schools will reopen as The Winsford E-ACT Academy in September 2010, which sees the two school names and its Federation being made redundant. It will operate from the two existing school sites before the proposed plans for a new school building, that would accommodate all students, is complete. Verdin High School is the current favourite site in the bid for the new building, but has raised some concerns among residents in the surrounding areas. However, they have been reassured they 'won't be left in the dark' over plans for the new building. Councillor Charlie Parkinson, of Winsford Town Council, said: \\"certain issues can't be addressed until funding for a new building is secured ... The Government has agreed for certain cosmetic improvements to make the schools look more appealing for the students in September, but this won't affect the money for the new school\\". He addresses the council are 100 per cent behind the new building, but the location of the new build is currently unknown to anyone. He says that \\"until we find out exactly where this school is going to be we can't really make too much of an issue about it\\". = Changes to upcoming academy = On 18 August 2010, it was announced that Andrew Kilpatrick was appointed as interim Principal of The Winsford E-ACT Academy. He addresses that some changes have been made to the two existing school sites to provide an enhanced learning environment and said \\"we have redesigned parts of the school to teach in half year groups, taking about 80 children in one class and splitting them up to work in smaller groups\\". Some of the other changes include provision for the upcoming Year 7's, along with Year 8 and 9 students who will be taught at the former Verdin High School site – newly renamed as Town Site. Whereas, Year 10 and 11 students will be split across both sites, including the former Woodford Lodge High School site – newly renamed as West Site. The Academy will incorporate a 'House System' and will be split into four Houses; each comprising students from all year groups and will encompass an ethos of 'healthy competition' from sports to debating societies, performance groups and music. Another change includes the development of 'inclusion zones' at both sites that will be staffed by trained teachers to manage children who misbehave. On 26 August 2010, it was announced that new uniforms will be provided to Academy students for free and will be ready to collect from the 'Town Site' between 9am to 12pm and 5pm to 7pm on 1, 2 and 3 September 2010. Students will receive a blazer, tie and two pairs of trousers for the boys and either two skirts or two pairs of trousers (or a mixture of each) for the girls. A basic PE kit will also be provided and includes a polo shirt and one pair of black shorts/skort. The four Houses will each have its own colour consisting of blue, red, green, and yellow. Students will represent their House with these colours on their tie and will also be added to their blazer trim for the two types of prefects that are also being introduced. These are: 'Academy Prefects' who will show them on both their cuffs and collars and 'House Prefects' who will show them on their cuffs.  Academy: September 2010–present  Opening = The Winsford E-ACT Academy opened on 6 September 2010 with an Open Day at the 'Town Site', uniting students from the two Federated schools for the first time, wearing their new uniform which was provided by the Academy free of charge. Andrew Kilpatrick, Interim Principal said: \\"We've worked hard to get everything in place to start the new term, with a new look and new uniform\\". He also has high hopes for the Academy, which will specialise in music and mathematics and provide 1,500 places for students aged 11 to 16, with 200 spaces allocated for post-16 students. Michael Gove, Education Secretary, has signed the funding agreement giving education sponsor E-ACT responsibility for the Academy. = New build = On 27 October 2010, it was announced that funding for the new building remains uncertain even though it was promised a £20 million new building following the establishment of the Academy, earmarked for the former Verdin High School site by 2013. The Academy was told they would have to wait until January for a decision but remains optimistic despite the Government's Spending Review announced last week on 20 October 2010, which reduced the spending for new school buildings by 60%. Vicky Atkinson, Deputy Director for Business and Finance at the Academy says \\"obviously, we're still hoping for a rebuild but whatever happens there will be a substantial financial investment. It may be a new building, a 100 per cent refurbishment or a 95 per cent refurbishment, we won't know until January\\". On 23 December 2010, it was announced that plans for the new building will go ahead after securing the funding of £20 million from the Government. Lord Hill, Schools secretary announced that the cash will be available to fund the building on the site of the former Verdin High School. In a letter sent to the Academy's sponsor, E-ACT, said: \\"As you know, we have had to take some tough decisions on spending in order to address the public expenditure deficit. The resources available to us for capital projects are extremely limited. In the light of these constraints, we have decided that the priority for academy expenditure should be determined by the condition of the buildings and the plans for pupil places\\". On 14 January 2011, it was announced that staff and students are celebrating the start of the new term last week after returning to the news that they had received the funding, which was announced just days before Christmas. Andrew Kilpatrick, Interim Principal said the announcement was a \\"huge relief\\". The new building is anticipated to be completed by the end of 2013 however Kilpatrick said: \\"There is no reason to suspect the original timeline, to be in the school by 2013, need to be suspended. Indeed it could be earlier than that. Obviously the new building will be state-of-the-art and with significant regards to eco friendliness and will allow us to use a range of information technologies\\". On 26 March 2011, it was announced that Andrew Taylor-Edwards who has held the post of Vice Principal since September 2010, was appointed as Principal of the Academy, and will replace current Interim Principal, Andrew Kilpatrick, after the Easter break.  Closure of former Woodford Lodge building  On 1 July 2011, marked the final day of education at the West Site (former Woodford Lodge High School building). From September 2011, all Academy students will be educated at the Town Site (former Verdin High School building) for two years before moving into the proposed new building. Andrew-Taylor Edwards, Principal said: \\"It is a poignant moment for all Academy students, staff and parents. School-life is such an important part of all our lives, irrespective of our individual experiences. I still drive past my old Secondary School in Wrexham and every time I do, the memories come flooding back\\". To mark the event, lessons were suspended at lunchtime and both students and staff spent the afternoon on the school fields with food, music, prizes and wall/shirt- signing. The ties of the former Woodford Lodge High School also made a final appearance. On 8 July 2011, a ceremony was held to mark the closure of the West Site which was organised by Jayne Kettle. 180 parents, staff and ex-staff attended, with speeches from Steve Meeks (ex-Head), Martin Fleetwood (ex- Deputy Head) and John Hanley, the first ever appointment to Woodford Lodge over 40 years ago. Andrew Taylor-Edwards, Principal said: \\"Yes, it's sad to say goodbye to the old building but bricks and mortar do not carry the spirit of all that has been nurtured since 1971. That will not go away, it is carried in all who have experienced it. Indeed, as Mr Hanley described it, the old schools of Woodford Lodge High School and Verdin High School are the grandparents of the new' [The] Winsford E-ACT Academy; a young and hungry offspring with a bright future ahead.\\" Performances were held on the day from current Academy students who had started at Woodford Lodge. On 11 August 2011, it was announced that supporters of New Images Youth Centre on Nixon Drive, adjacent to the former Verdin High School, which was saved from closure following its sale and subsequently became part of Verdin in 2003, now run by the youth service provider, Connexions (Cheshire and Warrington), 'fear the worse' on the uncertainty of whether it would remain. It may be demolished when construction of the new building commences, with details which are expected to be released this week. Campaigners have \\"accused Cheshire West and Chester Council of doing nothing to safeguard the future of the centre should the current building stand in the way of Academy plans\\". On 17 August 2011, it was announced that plans for the new building will be revealed next month and will be submitted to the Government in September before a public consultation that will commence in the autumn, where the local community will be able to view artist's impressions of the new building that will be situated on the former Verdin High School site. Partnerships for Schools (PfS); a delivery agent for the Government's capital investment programmes into schools, is expected to receive a feasibility study which is being prepared by Cheshire West and Chester Council in partnership with the Academy and sponsors E-ACT. Subject to planning approval, the construction will start in spring 2012 and is anticipated to be completed by the end of summer 2013. The demolition of the former Verdin building will then begin and should be completed by April 2014. On 13 October 2011, it was announced that as part of the first phase of public consultations, the local community will have the opportunity to learn more about the plans for the new building, share their views, concerns such as increased traffic and parking with many proposals now under consideration by the design team, as well as any questions they may have at a drop-in session, with representatives from the Academy, Cheshire West and Chester Council and the proposed main contractor, Kier. It will be held at the Town Site on 19 October 2011, between 5:30pm and 8pm. A planning application is due to be submitted in December with construction starting in spring 2012; to be completed by the end of summer 2013, along with an anticipation for the whole project to be completed by summer 2014. On 9 November 2011, it was announced a second drop-in session will be held on 16 November 2011 from 6:30pm. It will address the new build project as well as planning for the future of the town, in which Winsford has been selected to pilot neighbourhood planning powers as part of the Government's Localism Bill, through a partnership between Winsford Town Council, Cheshire West and Chester Council and Weaver Valley Partnership Board. It will allow the local community to have a further say in shaping the future of how the land in the town will be developed.  Planning permission  On 12 March 2012, it was announced that the Academy was given planning permission to go-ahead for the £20 million building project, which was given 'unanimous support' from Cheshire West and Chester Council's strategic planning committee on 8 March 2012. The project will commence next month and is anticipated to be completed by September 2013. In addition to the designs of the new build mentioned previously, the sports hall will be five- court and a fitness suite will also be developed that would be open to the local community. The access off Joyce Avenue, the former main entrance of Verdin High School and at present the Academy, which was the biggest problem among residents, will be closed. The access off Grange Lane would become the new main entrance that will allow two-way traffic for staff and visitors and a one-way drop-off 'vehicular loop' or drop-off points; vehicles would exit on Nixon Drive. On the High Street, new pelican crossings will be installed to make it safer for pupils who walk to school. On 14 March 2012, posts marking the corners of where certain parts of the new building will go, were inserted into the ground by Kier building contractors, providing the Academy a \\"first sense of the physical build\\". The Academy took the opportunity to walk down what would be the 'Street' which at present, is the running track. On 16 March 2012, it was announced that Andrew-Taylor Edwards, Principal who has been a teacher at the school since 1999, has shared his excitement over the new build project following the go-ahead, and said: \\"It is great news and confirmation of all the hopes and ambitions we have for pupils, staff, and the community … There has been a lot of talk of about new buildings for young people in Winsford for a number of years now. People can become a little desensitised when they are so used to barriers being put up, but to finally have confirmation for something like this is just so exciting. The kids can't quite believe it. I was looking at the drawings with pupils the other day when one of them asked in such disbelief if we were going to get it.\\" On 28 March 2012, Cheshire West and Chester Council have announced a £2.5 million investment to improve the A54 High Street and Grange Lane traffic signal junction, which is expected to be completed when the new Academy building opens in September 2013. It will include additional crossing facilities and lanes on all approaches to improve the capacity and the flow of traffic. The changes are being made to help support the extra traffic created by the Academy and support future developments in the area.  Closure of former Verdin building  On 16 July 2013, it was announced that around 60 Academy dance students from Year 9 and 10, performed a choreographed flash mob at the front of the former Verdin High School building to mark the end of an era, and to celebrate their move into the new building in September. Laura Wilkinson, Head of Dance discusses the Academy's excitement of the new build and said: \\"We've got a brand new dance studio with sprung floors and a new theatre. It's really going to let us do lots more productions. Dance is one of our most popular subjects at the moment. It's really developed over the last five years. Over 100 students are involved now.\\" The former Verdin building is set to be demolished and landscaped by March 2014.  Completion  On 15 August 2013, it was announced that the Academy's new building is ready for its first school term, with the Sixth Form's intake increasing to 150, having started from scratch two years ago. The official handover was marked complete on 16 August 2013 and will open to students on 9 September 2013. Andrew Taylor- Edwards, Principal said: \\"Kier Construction and Cheshire West and Chester Council have made a potentially stressful process absolutely painless. Great project management from both partners and our own Andrew Duncalf, Debbie Beaumont and Martin Bott. Great to meet the architect today and share his delight at the end product. A small list of snags to work through before the big open…\\" On 9 September 2013, the Academy opened its doors of the new building for its induction day, with 1,100 students inducted. Andrew Taylor- Edwards, Principal said: \\"The building is finally complete because the students are here. It's not just the bricks and mortar that makes a school, it's the students and the staff – the spirit of the school is now here. Today was our induction day and it went brilliantly. It was a day of excitement and celebration\\". = Change of sponsor = On 25 February 2014, it was announced that the Academy is among ten Academies to be handed back to the Government amid concerns over the E-ACT chain's standards. On 27 February 2014, it was confirmed that the Academy is one of ten Academies who will no longer be sponsored by E-ACT. The Department for Education (DfE) is now brokering with other Academy chains to set up the Academy with a new sponsor. On 9 July 2014, it was confirmed that the Academy's new sponsor, with effect from 1 September 2014, will be The Fallibroome Multi-Academy Trust in Macclesfield. E-ACT will cease to be the Academy's sponsor from 31 August 2014. As a result, only minor changes were made with the removal of the word 'E-ACT' from the school name and logo. = Suspend of Sixth Form provision = On 14 January 2015, it was announced that The Winsford Academy has made the 'difficult decision' to suspend Sixth Form provision from September 2016 due to funding cuts and declining pupil numbers, and will revert to being an 11–16 school. Mr Andrew Taylor-Edwards, Principal told the Chester Chronicle that \\"while the proportion of students opting to stay on for Sixth Form study has remained constant, recent cuts to funding have put 'increasing pressure on the financial viability of providing our small post-16 provision'\\". He also said that \\"we have always prided ourselves in our ability to offer a small Sixth Form provision, allowing students an intimate setting where every student is known and where class sizes are small\\". The Academy will not be offering Year 12 study to current Year 11 students from September this year, while remaining fully committed to current Year 12 Sixth Form students who will start their second year of study.  Potential re-establishment  In May 2015, it was announced that the Sixth Form was to be re-established at the earliest opportunity. Concerns were also made that poor prior decisions had resulted in overstaffing and budgetary difficulties. In July 2016, it was announced that a feasibility study has been carried out and the Academy Governors and Sponsor had launched a consultation on the future of the Sixth Form, announcing intentions to re-establish provision in 2019. The last Year 13 students left in 2016 and the governors are already planning on what needs to be done to re-establish Sixth Form provision. The feasibility study report points out that according to Department for Education guidelines, the Academy would need to reapply to open a Sixth Form and would need to meet the criteria for an application, including proving it can recruit and sustain 200 students from the area, offer at least 20 academic A Level subjects and remain financially viable.  Motto  The Winsford Academy's motto is \\"Succeed, Aspire, Learn Together\\" and its acronym makes the word 'SALT', which is based upon the towns mining heritage and The Verdin Family who founded the Verdin Technical School in 1895 that developed into the present Academy. They owned six salt plants in various locations throughout Cheshire and was the largest salt manufacturer in the United Kingdom by 1881.

The leadership group comprises a Principal; two Vice Principals (Curriculum & Standards and Care, Support & Guidance) and seven Assistant Principals (Science & Technology, English, Maths, Achievement & Intervention, Sixth Form, Enrichment & Engagement, Humanities & SMSC). There are 60 teaching staff, including the leadership team.  Pastoral system  The Winsford Academy has a pastoral system which consists of five Year Heads and four Progress Managers. Through the Heads of Year team, students are provided with pastoral care and support with services such as child welfare, attendance support, mentoring and counselling all being available throughout the Academy day. Students also have access to their Coach, Head of Year and Progress Manager. The Progress Managers are responsible for progress tracking, engagement and enrichment, and competition of the House System.  House system  The Winsford Academy has a house system consisting of four 'Houses', which, as a specialism of Performing Arts and a specialist music school, are named after English composers; Britten (Benjamin Britten), Purcell (Henry Purcell), Elgar (Edward Elgar) and Sullivan (Arthur Sullivan). Depending on what House each student is in determines the colour of their tie and blazer trim for prefects. Britten are recognised in blue; Purcell red; Elgar green; and Sullivan yellow. Each House is structured vertically to include coaching groups from all Years 7 to 13. Within each coaching group all pupils belong to the same House. Coaches are placed in the same House as their coaching group. Teachers without coaching responsibilities will also belong to a House team.  Specialist school  Performing Arts is the main specialism of The Winsford Academy, in addition to being a Specialist Music School. The two predecessor schools; Verdin High School had a specialism in Technology that was attained via sponsorship by The Ogden Trust, and Woodford Lodge High School had no specialism.  Sponsor  The Winsford Academy is sponsored by The Fallibroome Multi-Academy Trust in Macclesfield.

It was written and produced by bassist Jim Lea. The song failed to chart in the UK and was the band's last single before disbanding in 1992. In 2007, Lea would release his own solo version of \\"Universe\\" on his debut solo album Therapy. Background After their contract with RCA expired in 1987, Slade decided to take an eighteen-month break. Although the band announced their intentions to record a new album, these plans did not materialise. Later in 1991, the band's former label Polydor approached them with the idea of recording two new singles to promote a new compilation album Wall of Hits. The two singles, \\"Radio Wall of Sound\\" and \\"Universe\\", were soon completed, with \\"Radio Wall of Sound\\" being released in October 1991. The band's first Top 40 hit since 1984, it reached No. 21 in the UK. With the release of Wall of Hits in November, \\"Universe\\" followed in December and attempted to attract the Christmas market. However, it failed to chart in the UK. With the commercial failure of \\"Universe\\", Polydor's option for a new studio album was withdrawn and the band would split up in 1992. Like \\"Radio Wall of Sound\\", \\"Universe\\" was originally a solo recording of Lea's, who had completed much of the song's recording prior to it becoming a Slade song. Lea planned to add strings to the song at Abbey Road, however as the studio was booked, he used a synthesiser to record the strings section at Rich Bitch Studios instead. In a 1992 fan club interview, Holder spoke of the song in relation to \\"Radio Wall of Sound\\", and about its commercial failure: In his 1999 biography Who's Crazee Now?, Holder said: \\"\\"Universe\\" was very orchestral, backed by strings and totally unlike anything we had ever done before as Slade. It bombed [and] was too far from what people expected of us.\\" In a 2000 interview with Mojo, Lea recalled: \\"The last thing that came out was \\"Universe\\" - very big and lush. Towards the end the records were completely my songs. I'd taken control and it didn't feel like a band any more. All the fun had gone out of it, so I started getting into the property business, and took a psychology course at college.\\" Release \\"Universe\\" was released by Polydor Records on 7\\" vinyl and CD in the UK and across Europe. In the UK, the single was also released on 12\\" vinyl and cassette. The first B-side, \\"Red Hot\\", was exclusive to the single and would later appear on the band's 2007 compilation B-Sides. It was written by guitarist Dave Hill and ex-Wizzard keyboardist Bill Hunt. The second B-side was the band's 1973 hit \\"Merry Xmas Everybody\\". On the 12\\" and CD formats of the single, the band's 1977 single \\"Gypsy Roadhog\\" was also included as a third B-side. Promotion A music video was filmed to promote the single, which was directed by William Clark and filmed at a studio in Shepherd's Bush. Rated as one of Slade's most evocative videos, Powell noted in his diary at the time that \\"we go Amadeus on the video\\", in reference to the 1984 American period drama film of the same name. In the UK, the band performed the song on This Morning, Motormouth and Pebble Mill. In the Netherlands, they performed the song for Countdown, however it was never broadcast. The band began promoting the single in Europe in 1992. In February, the band performed the song on the TV show Gottschalk.

It is the second book in The Heroes of Olympus series, preceded by The Lost Hero and followed by The Mark of Athena. The story follows the adventures of amnesiac Percy Jackson, a demigod son of Poseidon, as he meets a camp of Roman demigods and goes to Alaska with his new friends Hazel Levesque and Frank Zhang to free the Greek god of death, Thanatos, and help save the world from Gaea, the earth goddess. The novel is narrated in third-person, switching between the points of view of Percy, Frank, and Hazel. The book received mostly critical acclaim, won the Goodreads Choice Award in 2011, and appeared on several bestseller lists. The Son of Neptune was first published in hardcover on October 4, 2011 by Disney- Hyperion with a cover designed by illustrator John Rocco. After an initial hardcover printing of three million copies, the book has since been released in paperback as well as an audiobook and e-book, and has been translated into 37 languages. Development In an interview by Scholastic with Vikram Sastry for The Lost Hero, Riordan was questioned about the whereabouts of Percy Jackson. The author hinted that the answer would be revealed as Jason's quest progressed. By the end of the book, he said that readers would have a good idea where the second book is going. On May 26, 2011, Riordan released both the cover art and the first chapter for The Son of Neptune confirming that Percy would play a role in the book. On August 8, 2011, Rick Riordan released a video giving more information about the book and its characters. The video includes pictures of a black haired boy with a bow and arrow in his hands who is later revealed to be Frank Zhang, a blonde-haired boy holding a teddy bear later revealed as Octavian, a girl with black hair wearing gold armor and a purple cloak sitting on a throne flanked by a gold and a silver canine creature, both with red eyes, who was revealed on Rick Riordan's blog to be Reyna, and another girl riding a horse named Hazel Levesque. Along with this, two chapters were released prior to the book's launch: one was put on Riordan's website and another read out by Riordan on Percy's birthday, August 18. Plot Nine months after Percy Jackson's defense of Mount Olympus in The Last Olympian, Percy finds himself alone and on the run from monsters in northern California without his memories. With the guidance of Lupa, the wolf- goddess and protector of ancient Rome, he makes his way to Camp Jupiter, the Roman demigod training camp and counterpart to the Greek demigods' Camp Half- Blood. Upon arriving, he is attacked by Gorgons — Stheno and Euryale — and successfully defends a disguised Juno and the camp with the help of the guards on duty. Having been protected by Percy during the attack, Juno announces Percy's arrival with approval, identifying him as a son of Neptune. She tells him privately that he can only regain his memory by learning to be a hero again and successfully surviving the challenges he encounters at camp. He quickly befriends Frank Zhang, son of Mars, and Hazel Levesque, daughter of Pluto. He is introduced to the praetor of the camp, Reyna, and the augur Octavian, who quickly takes a disliking to Percy. Octavian tells Percy that the Book of Prophecies is missing. Being outcasts themselves at Camp Jupiter, Frank and Hazel empathize with Percy's outsider status and consider it their duty to help him adjust and acclimatize quickly to the camp's routines and leadership. But before any of them has a chance to gain their footing, they receive a prophecy from Mars, the Roman god of war, and are ordered to go on a quest to rescue Thanatos, the god of death, from the Giant Alcyoneus, who is hiding deep in Alaska. On their journey, they encounter Phineas, the blind human who helped Jason, leader of the Argonauts on his journey, and befriend a harpy named Ella. They also see the three Cyclopes that Jason Grace, Piper McLean, and Leo Valdez encountered in The Lost Hero. During the trip, the trio learns that the goddess Gaea is awakening from several millennia of slumber with a plan to destroy the gods and the world along with them. Her seven Giant children are being woken, each of whom is matched to fight its counterpart god. Each Giant has the skills to oppose one god and can only be defeated if the gods and the demigods join forces. Percy and his friends manage to defeat the Alaskan Giant and save Camp Jupiter from destruction. During their journey, Hazel and Frank become true heroes who know how to use their powers and have self-confidence. Percy regains his memory on their return to Camp Jupiter and finds an army of monsters (including Stheno, Euryale, and the three Cyclopes) led by Polybotes attacking it. Percy successfully defeats Polybotes with the help of Terminus, his Cyclops half-brother, Tyson and the hellhound Mrs. O'Leary. At the end of the book, the Greek airship, Argo II arrives, setting the stage for The Mark of Athena. Major characters=Viewpoint * Percy Jackson: A demigod son of Poseidon (Neptune), who is the main protagonist in the first Camp Half-Blood series. He and Jason Grace have been swapped, because Hera (Juno in Roman form) has wiped their memories away to unite the two demigod camps. Percy is sent from Camp Half-Blood to Camp Jupiter, Jason's home. He goes on a quest with Frank Zhang, son of Mars, and Hazel Levesque, daughter of Pluto, to save Thanatos, Pluto's lieutenant and the deity of death. He succeeds and at the end of the book leads the Roman camp into battle against Gaea's forces and is made praetor by the campers. His memories are restored at around the middle of the book, as Percy drinks gorgon's blood when he challenges Phineas. * Hazel Levesque: daughter of Pluto and Nico's half-sister. She has been recently resurrected by Nico from her death in 1942 at the age of 13 and lives in Camp Jupiter. She has a crush on Frank Zhang. She is an African American demigod from New Orleans. * Frank Zhang: a son of Mars and a legacy (distant descendant) of Poseidon on his mother's side. A notable ancestor of Frank is Periclymenus, who was given the ability of shapeshifting by his grandfather, Poseidon. It is revealed that the descendants of Periclymenus have inherited this ability, and Frank learns to use it late in the novel. Frank is a Roman demigod at Camp Jupiter, a camp for Roman demigods. Frank has a crush on Hazel, which she reciprocates. He is a Chinese Canadian. Other * Reyna Avila Ramirez-Arellano: daughter of Bellona, the Roman goddess of war, and praetor of Camp Jupiter. It is found that Reyna and her sister Hylla were servants of the witch Circe, whom Annabeth and Percy had killed in The Sea of Monsters.

Release The Son of Neptune was given a first printing of three million copies, the largest for Disney-Hyperion to that point. Upon release, the book ranked No. 1 on The New York Times bestseller list, USA Today bestseller list, and The Wall Street Journal bestseller list. It was the Amazon Best Book of the Month in October 2011. Critical reception The novel was met with mostly positive reviews. Dana Henderson of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called the addition of new characters \\"refreshing and captivating\\" and claimed that it would \\"make the reader to want to keep reading\\". Kimberly Bennion in Deseret News cited it as an \\"emotional roller coaster\\" and would please both old and new fans. However, she thought the characters had flaws. The Hutchinson Leader Kay Johnson wrote that the plot was confusing and the first half was not engaging, but thought Riordan should be given credit for introducing Greek and Roman mythology to a new generation. Kirkus Reviews was positive about the book, thinking that Riordan had \\"regained his traction\\" after \\"spinning his wheels\\" in The Lost Hero.

The 3rd Battalion departed from the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda aboard the troopship Kensington on 13 October, 1905, for Aldershot. Reginald Scoones was educated at Wellington College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was first commissioned into the Royal Fusiliers before joining the Royal Tank Regiment in 1923. In 1928, he was seconded to the Sudan Defence Force and commanded the machine-gun battery. In 1935, back in England, he became the adjutant of the 1st Royal Tank Regiment, and by early 1939 had completed a four-month spell as Staff Captain on the staff of the Mobile Division in Egypt. Second World War At the outbreak of the war, Scoones was working as a brigade major in Cairo before moving to the staff of the Western Desert Force as GSO2 in 1940. In 1941 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire and, after a short period as second in command of the 6th Royal Tank Regiment, was appointed commander of 42nd Royal Tank Regiment, part of 7th Armoured Division fighting in the Western Desert. After a stint first as a GSO1 and then as a Deputy Director of Military Training at the War Office in London, he was sent to India and assigned to command the 254th Indian Tank Brigade on 17 November 1943. The brigade, consisting of M3 Lee tanks and Stuart tanks, was soon in action at the Battle of Imphal, serving under General William Slim and Scoones's brother, Geoffry Scoones, who was commanding the IV Corps. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1945 for his \\"gallant and distinguished services in Burma\\". He was also mentioned in despatches. In July 1945 his substantive rank was raised to colonel. Post-war After the war, Scoones became Deputy Director of Military Training at the War Office.

He is especially famous for his images of Krishna, which were popular throughout North India and were even more influential than the works of Raja Ravi Varma. Several of his paintings of Krishna, Lakshmi, Sarasvati, Ganesha and Shiva were published as posters by S. S. Brijbasi, a firm based in Karachi in pre-independence India (from 1918 until Partition), using chromolithography, and printed in Germany. Murli Manohar, the most recognisable painting of Narottam Narayan and a best-selling image. Narottam Narayan's paintings marked a conscious return to a more traditional style of representation, wherein realism was less paramount than the images' iconic nature and engagement with the viewers. An \\"example par excellence\\" is his painting Murli Manohar (1934), which is reputed to be the best-selling image in the history of the industry. Other famous paintings of his, mass-produced by S. S. Brijbasi, include Shree Satyanarain (of Satyanarayana), Kailash Pati Shankar (of Shiva), depictions of Maharana Pratap and Shivaji, and images having to do with the independence struggle including portraits of Gandhi and Nehru, Mata ka Bandhan Mochan, and, painted after Gandhi's death, Gandhiji ki swargyatra (Gandhi's ascent to heaven). His initial training was at Udaipur. He was an illustrious apprentice of Ghasiram Hardev Sharma (1868–1930), who was himself trained at Jhalawar. It is likely that, as with Ravi Varma, Narottam Narayan's training may have been influenced by landscapes in German and Austrian prints and postcards, via collections at the princely courts at Udaipur and Jhalawar. The Nathdwara painters played a part in the evolution of Mewar painting. Ghasiram was both chief painter and head of photography for the Shrinathji temple in Nathdwara. Narottam Narayan adopted a practice of combining painting and photography in his image-making process, possibly either using photographs as a model or overpainting them. As with other artists of the Nathdwara school, his paintings are characterised by a photographic treatment of figures (especially faces), in the sense that he replicated the tones of black-and-white photography, such as giving a grey tinge to his Murli Manohar. The goal was to make \\"the divine accessible to the devotees as an empathetic presence\\". When his painting was used in 1928 for the first printed reproduction of the Shrinathji image, the artists of Nathdwara boycotted him, as they were opposed to mass reproduction fearing that it would affect their earnings. Eventually, they realised that mass production would bring greater awareness, demand, income, and fame. Narottam Narayan was also an early influence on B. G. Sharma (also from Nathdwara), who later broke away to evolve his own style.

He is the current Bishop of Liverpool and a former Bishop of Hertford in the Church of England Diocese of St Albans. Early life Bayes was born in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, on 2 November 1953. He studied drama at the University of Birmingham before studying for ordination at Queen's College, Edgbaston. Ordained ministry Bayes was ordained in the Church of England, made a deacon at Petertide 1979 (1 July) and as a priest the Petertide following (29 June 1980), both times by Ronnie Bowlby, Bishop of Newcastle, at Newcastle Cathedral. He was an assistant curate at St Paul's Church, Whitley Bay for three years (1979–1982). He then became a university chaplain in west London from 1982 to 1987. Bayes moved to High Wycombe for seven years where he initially as Team Vicar (1987–1990) and then Team Rector (1990–1994) before becoming Team Rector of Totton for nine years (1995–2004). While he was at Totton, Bayes was also the Area Dean of Lyndhurst from 2000. Upon leaving Totton, he joined the Archbishops' Council staff team as National Mission and Evangelism Adviser until his ordination to the episcopacy. He was also an honorary canon at Worcester Cathedral from 2007 until his consecration. Episcopal ministry On 7 July 2010 it was announced that Bayes would succeed Christopher Foster as Bishop of Hertford upon Foster's translation to Portsmouth. Bayes was duly consecrated a Church of England bishop on 21 September 2010 at St Paul's Cathedral and installed at St Albans Cathedral on 25 September 2010. On 7 May 2014 it was announced that Bayes was to become the next (8th) Bishop of Liverpool; his canonical election was confirmed on 23 July 2014. Bayes was installed at Liverpool Cathedral on 15 November 2014. Views Bayes often addresses the evangelical wing of the Church of England, despite dissenting from mainstream evangelical theological convictions. In June 2016 Bayes \\"called for far-reaching change in the church's attitudes to lesbian and gay people and a meaningful welcome to Christians in same-sex relationships\\". He supports the dropping the requirement for gay Christians to be celibate, saying \\"I've learned to respect the experiences of people who want to celebrate and express their sexuality, and be within the church\\". He contributed a chapter to the book Journeys in Grace and Truth: Revisiting Scripture and Sexuality (2016), which aims to show how it is \\"possible to hold a positive view of same-sex relationships while being a biblically rooted evangelical\\". In a tweet in February 2020, Bayes suggests that holding to the traditional teaching of the Church of England on marriage and sexual ethics is a form of hatred. This is despite, as a Bishop of the same church, making a declaration in his ordination and consecration as a Bishop to \\"teach the doctrine of Christ as the Church of England has received it\\" and to \\"refute error\\". Personal life Bayes has been married since 1976 and they have three adult children.

Venezuelan cinema has been characterised from its outset as propaganda, partially state-controlled and state-funded, commercial cinema. The nation has seen a variety of successful films, however, which have reaped several international awards. Still, in terms of quality, it is said that though \\"we can point to specific people who have made great films in Venezuela [and] a couple of great moments in the history of Venezuelan cinema, [...] those have been exceptions\\". In the 21st century, Venezuelan cinema has seen more independence from the government, but has still been described as recently as 2017 to be at least \\"influenced\\" by the state. Film was introduced to the country in 1896, with the first national films screened in 1897. Several films were made in the last few years of the 19th Century, with a lower rate of production until the 1970s. The industry in the country has served political purposes from its early years and Juan Vicente Gómez' governments all the way through to current President Nicolás Maduro, and is also a mass-market entertainment base; sometimes the aims overlap. In the 21st century, attendance grew to a national average that would indicate every citizen visits the cinema once a year, though screenings began to decrease with the ongoing crisis after 2010. Since the mid-2000s and developing in the 2010s, the more successful national films have been LGBT-related as part of the broader wave of Latin American New Maricón Cinema, with several of the country's Oscar submissions being based in LGBT+ narratives.  History = Early years (1890s–1930s)  Teatro Baralt in 1896, where the first Venezuelan films were screened A frame from Un célebre especialista sacando muelas en el gran Hotel Europa, thought be lost for many decades It is said by film writers that during this time, filmmaking was limited to \\"a few pioneering filmmakers [...] who survived by selling propaganda-style documentaries and newsreels to the [Juan Vicente Gómez dictatorship]\\". It is also suggested that Venezuelans as a society were more film consumers than producers in this time, and that artistic films were only produced in the wider context of photography or physical art. The first films shown in Venezuela were released on July 11, 1896 at the Baralt Theatre in Maracaibo. This was, however, not fully known until almost a century later in 1983; cinema scholarship in Venezuela was only developed during its \\"Golden Age\\" in the late 1970s, until which point the \\"official history [...] was limited to amusing stories told by those who were present during the early years.\\" The early exhibition was facilitated by entrepreneur Luis Manuel Méndez, who had travelled to New York City in June 1896 and acquired a Vitascope, as well as licenses to use it for profit in both Venezuela and Colombia. This made Venezuela the second country in Latin America (after Brazil) to receive film screening technology, and the first to use Vitascope. The films shown included The Monroe Doctrine and Umbrella Dance. Six months later in January 1897 the first films to be produced in Venezuela were shown at the same cinema; these were Un célebre especialista sacando muelas en el gran Hotel Europa and Muchachos bañándose en la laguna de Maracaibo. The reception to the introduction of cinema was seemingly \\"cold\\" and \\"indifferent\\". Both these first Venezuelan films, and the credit for bringing Vitascope to Venezuela, have historically been attributed to Manuel Trujillo Durán. Parts of Venezuelan film scholarship have had the tendency to paint Trujillo as the most important film pioneer of the nation; others show that he was simply a photographer who had the ability to operate the Vitascope. On July 15, 1897 the Cinemagraph was first exhibited in Venezuela, by an employee sent by the Lumière Company, in Caracas. After two months, the Frenchman was run out of the country, but may have helped film this year's Venezuelan film productions, Una paliza en el estado Sarría and Carlos Ruiz peleando con un cochero, shown on November 26. After these, there is little evidence of film production for the next 10 years, though multiple different brands of film cameras and projectors were in the country. In total, there appears to have been 51 films, 37 short films and 14 features, made in Venezuela between 1897 and 1936. All were silent films. The first feature, La dama de las Cayenas, was released in 1913 with a runtime of 60 minutes. Narrative films, rather than cinema as novelty, began to be produced in Venezuela in the 1910s, with its pioneers Enrique Zimmerman, director of La Dama de las Cayenas, and Lucas Manzano, who co-created what is considered Venezuela's first narrative film, Don Confusio. It wasn't long after their respective debuts that they began collaboration, with Manzano coming to produce La Dama de las Cayenas. As Manzano's short films had been light comedies, La Dama... was instead a parody film, targeting the Alexandre Dumas story The Lady of the Camellias, that told a torrid love story. Manzano recounted that it was so successful that it persuaded Zimmerman and himself to choose to become filmmakers, \\"peliculeros\\". This was not the only film inspired by literature: Jacobo Capriles and Edgar J. Anzola made La Trepadora, based on a Rómulo Gallegos book as many Latin American films of the century would be, as part of their new production company Triunfo Films, which they had founded in 1923. Soon, film education started in the country, and photographer Amábilis Cordero took correspondence classes to make his first film, Los milagros de la Divina Pastora in 1928; though he could have been the first notable director to have been trained, he still openly thought of himself as a \\"rookie\\". The second production company, Cinematograficos Lara, was founded by Cordero from his profits. Despite these companies existing, Arturo Serrano states that Venezuela \\"did not have a single professional filmmaker\\" and was lagging behind the rest of the world \\"in terms of quality and the use of cinematographic language\\". Serrano compares Venezuela's output to Battleship Potemkin (Eisenstein, 1925) and Intolerance (Griffith, 1916). Whilst the US and Soviet developed technology and identity, and so seem obvious to be leaders in film, Serrano does say that even compared with \\"some of the other countries in Latin America\\" Venezuela was behind, despite receiving film before almost the rest of its continent. From the late 1920s, though, even these amateur artistic films almost ceased in production, the industry falling to the government ministries of Gómez and pseudo-documentary films. Though almost exclusively making informational films, political powers weren't entirely repressive; in 1932 Gómez' nephew Efrain Gómez returned from a trip to the US with technology that would allow sound to be added to film.\\" With the government film agency LCN (Laboratorio Cinematográfico Nacional) having been merged with Maracay Films, Efrain Gómez worked through this company to make La venus de Nácar: Fantasía Aborigen, the first Venezuelan sound film, using only background music. When Gómez died in 1935, the government agencies of production became more chaotic (briefly becoming SCN — the 'S' for 'Servicio') before being shut down in 1938. The Ministry of Public Works would lease the film equipment to private companies at the urging of Tomás Pacanins, though the two companies that received the most support had Pacanins as shareholder. One of these companies used the resources to create Venezuela's first synchronous sound film — one that records the sounds belonging to the recorded actions — in 1938; the accolade belongs to either Taboga or El Rompimiento. Taboga features both speech and live music, and scholars also claim it as the first Venezuelan film with a \\"director to understand the artistic possibilities of cinema as a medium of visual expression\\".  Birth of Venezuelan films (1940s–1960s)  Film poster of La Balandra Isabel llegó esta tarde From the beginning of the 1940s, there was an attitude of commercialism. Producers in Venezuela \\"copied [...] Mexico's mode of film production [and] its narrative and formal patterns\\", to guarantee at least some cinema audience. The film scholar Darlene J. Sadlier comments that \\"profit was the main objective\\" in these decades, but that film producers also aimed to make Venezuelan films relatable for Venezuelan people. Even after the death of President Gómez, into the 1950s, most film profits were made from commercial advertisements and propaganda. These films showcased Venezuelan nationalism, through techniques like landscape shots, folklore-based stories, and film stereotypes to make them publicly palatable. There was also competition with the Mexican film industry in these years, with Venezuelan people enjoying and celebrating the Mexican film output; the Mexican film Allá en el Rancho Grande was screened in Venezuela in 1936, and \\"beat every picture\\", with the Mexican stories and production system being supported in the following decades. It took only two years for Mexican and Argentinian film to overtake Hollywood films in Venezuelan screening numbers. As Venezuela's film industry was being born in the 1940s, there were co-production agreements established, which let Venezuelan actors appear in Mexican films, in a way to create more Latin American stars and help the Venezuelan films blossom with famous actors from both nations. Having Spanish and other Latin American actors in Venezuelan productions also contributed to a \\"'feel' of foreignness\\" that made films more successful in Venezuela. Landmarks of Venezuelan cinema include two Cannes winners from this period: Carlos Hugo Christensen's 1949 film La Balandra Isabel llego esta tarde, the first South American winner at Cannes, taking the Best Cinematography Award at the 1951 Cannes Film Festival, was the culmination of Bolívar Films' efforts to create a real film industry in Venezuela, though it failed; Margot Benacerraf's 1959 documentary Araya, which \\"was hailed as a masterpiece of poetic cinema\\", was entered into the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, where it shared the Cannes International Critics Prize with Alain Resnais' Hiroshima mon amour.Araya, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Accessed online 2009-11-15.  The Golden Age: Development of film identity (1970s–1980s)  In the World Cinema: Critical Approaches anthology, it is said that whilst \\"Venezuelan cinema began sporadically in the 1950s[, it] only emerged as a national-cultural movement in the mid-1970s\\" when it gained state support and auteurs could produce work. International co- productions with Latin America and Spain continued into this era and beyond, and Venezuelan films of this time were counted among the works of New Latin American Cinema. This period is known as Venezuela's Golden Age of cinema, having massive popularity even though it was a time of much social and political upheaval. One of the most famous Venezuelan films, even to date, is the 1976 film Soy un delincuente by Clemente de la Cerda, which won the Special Jury Prize at the 1977 Locarno International Film Festival. Soy un delincuente was one of nine films for which the state gave substantial funding to produce, made in the year after the Venezuelan state began giving financial support to cinema in 1975. The support likely came from increased oil wealth in the early 1970s, and the subsequent 1973 credit incentive policy. At the time of its production the film was the most popular film in the country, and took a decade to be usurped from this position, even though it was only one in a string of films designed to tell social realist stories of struggle in the 1950s and '60s. Equally famous is the 1977 film El Pez que Fuma (Román Chalbaud). In 1981 FONCINE (the Venezuelan Film Fund) was founded, and this year it provided even more funding to produce seventeen feature films. Though a few years later, in 1983 with Viernes Negro, oil prices depreciated and Venezuela entered a depression which prevented such extravagant funding, film production continued; more transnational productions occurred, many more with Spain due to Latin America experiencing poor economic fortune in general, and there was some success in new cinema, as well: Fina Torres' 1985 Oriana won the Caméra d'Or Prize at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival as the best first feature. Film production peaked in 1984-5,:37 with 1986 considered Venezuelan cinema's most successful year by the state, thanks to over 4 million admissions to national films, according to Venezuelanalysis. Venezuelan capital Caracas hosted the Ibero-American Forum on Cinematography Integration in 1989, from which the pan-continental IBERMEDIA was formed; a union which provides regional funding.  Falling production (1990s)  After the political unrest at the start of the 1990s, film production had very little income despite staying relatively strong through Viernes Negro; FONCINE was issued a bailout in 1991 to restart the industry on a smaller scale.:41 In 1993 Venezuelan cinema saw what could have been another boom. FONCINE attempted to promote national filmmaking by more than quintupling their funding. Venezuela also ratified its first National Cinematography Law in 1993. This law aimed to promote filmmaking, but had failings in financial provisions until it was amended in 2005. The film identity of the decade was most significantly marked by a greater world presence and more festival wins in the mid-1990s, like Joseph Novoa's Sicario (1994), which won the Best Feature Film Award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. Spokespersons for national cinema in the Chávez administration said the collapse of the industry was caused by \\"a mixture of economic crisis, neoliberal policies and industry instability\\"; Victor Lucker of the private national distributor Cine Amazonia Films believes that the \\"governments of that period contributed to the decline\\", saying that policies were new and unclear. One documentary released in the 1990s is seen as a key resource in Latin American film history; Alfredo Anzola's El misterio de los ojos escarlata was made using footage recorded by Anzola's father, Edgar J. Anzola, a director in the 1920s and 1930s who never saw much success and moved onto another career; he helped open Radio Caracas. Edgar's unknown history is said to reveal what filmmaking of the period may have been like, as little is known and recorded.  Modern cinema (2000–present)  232x232px 232x232px A few decades after most Western cinemas found their legs, Venezuela found theirs. The 21st century saw an increase in production aligned with other developments introduced to the country. There were more films made, and to a higher standard. Elia Schneider's Punto y Raya (2004), actor Édgar Ramírez' first film, won four international awards, including the Special Jury Prize at the Havana Film Festival. One highly criticised film of the time is Jonathan Jakubowicz's Secuestro Express (2005), distributed internationally by Miramax and then-highest-grossing Venezuelan film, which may criticise organised crime. The social narrative is highly discussed, critics generally agreed that social issues are made apparent but not commented on. The lack of depth in favor of presenting ultra-violence is said to compromise the narrative of the film, with said violence also unpalatable to some, and questionable moral undertones of poverty justifying the actions. Though criticised, the negative presentation of the nation was still present, and this \\"enraged\\" Hugo Chávez enough to publicly threaten Jakubowicz, a filmmaker who became more prominent and celebrated in the years after this. Comparatively, many of the films of 2000–2010 have historical settings, and tackle social issues there, from Román Chalbaud's El Caracazo (2005), which was the most costly Venezuelan film at the time, to Mariana Rondón's 2007 film Postales de Leningrado, which was awarded the Golden Sun Award at the Biarritz International Festival of Latin American Cinema, to 2009's Venezzia, produced by Haik Gazarian, which won about fifteen awards around the world in film festivals and is one of Venezuela's most expensive films overall. In the late 2000s other genres, those seen as neither propaganda nor productive in social criticism, began to make appearances. In 2010, Fina Torres' romance-drama Habana Eva was awarded Best International Feature at the New York International Latino Film Festival. The 2013 horror film La Casa del Fin de los Tiempos became such a success that its director was hired in 2016 to shoot an American remake. =Post-2013= Despite successes in Venezuelan cinema, the Routledge Companion to Latin American Cinema, published in 2017, still makes a distinction between big Latin American film markets in Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil, and the cinema regimes of nations like Cuba and Venezuela. It explains that Venezuela is a particularly obvious case of \\"how state investments, [and] both direct and indirect support, can influence domestic productions carried out ostensibly by private companies\\", suggesting that even in the 2010s Venezuelan film productions have some element of state control and propaganda. Maduro had appointed his son, Nicolás Maduro Guerra, as the head of the Escuela Nacional de Cine shortly after taking power in 2014, with critics challenging the 23-year-old Maduro Guerra's credentials and accusing the president of nepotism. Venezuelan playwright José Tomás Angola is reported to have responded that \\"Maduro's son knows nothing [about cinema] [...] What he does know is how to steal a camera.\\" By 2019, Maduro Guerra no longer held the position, but was being investigated by the United States for allegations of propaganda and censorship. Overall, the 2010s films of Venezuela are much more socially critical of the present than previous mainstream Venezuelan films were, including some which deal with homosexuality and homophobia, and dubbed by El País as \\"hearty revival in Venezuela's movie-making industry\\". Examples of these like Pelo malo (2013), Azul y no tan rosa (2012), and Desde Allá (2015) are among the nation's most well-known and most successful films, winning multiple international awards. Other films from later in the decade take a stance directly against the government, La familia and La Soledad (both 2017) focus on surviving amid the economic crisis, whilst 2018's Chavismo: The Plague of the 21st Century is, as titled, a distasteful look on the government's Chavist ideology. 's El pueblo soy yo analyzes the populism of Hugo Chávez. Jorge Thielen Armand's La Soledad is described by The Economist as \\"the latest in a glut of Venezuelan films telling unflinching, complex stories of life in the troubled Andean nation\\", which also acknowledges that it, and many other films like it, have received state funding; it proposes that the reason is a continuation of Chávez' isolationist policies in an attempt to maintain state control over pictures shown in cinemas. The article then discusses how Venezuela was, in 2017, at a critical tipping point, facing the simultaneous increase in independent Venezuelan filmmaking and mass emigration of directors and cinematographers. In February 2017, Nicolás Maduro announced that there was a dire need to create a biopic of Chávez, to tell a hero's story and to counter the presentation of the dictator by international film and television; Román Chalbaud had begun production on a Chávez trilogy by mid-2018. In July 2017, the Centro Nacional Autónomo de Cinematografía, previously autonomous if supported by the government, was appointed a new chair in the Deputy Culture Minister Aracelis García. Animation Felix Nakamura at the drawing board In the 1970s, a successful animation studio, Antarki, owned by Félix Nakamura, launched in Venezuela. Its success here was expanded across Latin American markets by one of its most famous animators, Benicio Vicente Kou.:417 Román Chalbaud's 1990 Western film Cuchillos de fuego features some stop-motion animation to illustrate a young David. The Centro Nacional Autónomo de Cinematografía has operated initiatives in partnership with other establishments to promote animated filmmaking in Latin America. However, there are few animated films in Venezuela. The 2011 animated short No Stingray Pie for Dinner Tonight took a year to create and is only five minutes long; the director limited its length to maintain consistent quality and described the animating process as hard, with certain limitations imposed on the production. The company 5 pollo C.A. was founded in 2014 and specialises in animation. Up. Carl attaches many helium balloons to his house in order to fly it to Angel Falls, Venezuela, travelling through the Gran Sabana in the film. Though not a national film, the 2009 Disney-Pixar animated feature Up prominently features settings in Venezuela's national parks; the setting was chosen after the director, Pete Docter, was shown a video of the tepui mountains of Canaima National Park. The production spent a lot of time researching the landscape: in 2004, Docter and eleven other Pixar artists spent several days accessing and illustrating Mount Roraima. During the nights there, they examined the native ants, mosquitoes, scorpions, frogs, and snakes; however, many of the real critters were not put into the film, with Docter saying that they would seem too unrealistic for the setting — animals created for the film were said to be challenging to design, having to fit into film realism whilst being both surreal and real enough for the grand environment of the fictional and real tepuis. After visiting Canaima, the animators flew to Kukenán-tepui and climbed to Angel Falls, the film's iconic image. In Venezuelan film, animation techniques can be used to deliver a social message. The 2014 short documentary \\"From the Brink: Venezuela Rising\\" is an American production by VICE, where animation is used to fill in where there is either no live footage or the real images are too sensitive, the film covering an outsider experiencing the 2014 Venezuelan protests; a 2019 viral Storybooth video also uses animation to tell the story of protests in Venezuela, here so used because it was produced in the United States, featuring the Venezuelan emigrant whose story to asylum is being told. Other techniques in recent films include the shadow puppets in 2015 short Valle Cocodrilo. The 2017 animated film Pequeños héroes tells a story of Simón Bolívar and was a South American co-production sponsored by Villa del Cine. It was aimed at children, though described to be slightly out of the field because it is not a typical Hollywood animation; because of the audience, the Argentine director did not want the film to feel nationalistic. The film was seen as a \\"giant step for Latin American animation\\" with its use of motion capture. Depictions of the Bolivarian Revolution and Crisis in Venezuela There are many depictions of the Bolivarian Revolution and its fallout in the Crisis in Venezuela in films, from both national and international filmmakers.:113-122 There is criticism of both those made by the national Villa del Cine for turning stories of revolution into Hollywood narratives, and of several international films for not presenting a complete story.:113-122 Films on the subject receive mixed responses from the Bolivarian government; positive portrayals will be re-run on television and in cinema for decades after release, while those suggesting negatives to the revolution have been banned in the country. LGBT+ cinema Films that deal with homosexuality and homophobia in society have become the industry's main drivers in the 2010s. This reflects an \\"unprecedented\\" ongoing AIDS crisis in the country, with the government removing anti-retroviral drugs from circulation, and a noticeable lack of government discussion compared to other Latin American nations. An Associated Press report wrote in 2015 that the new wave follows the Cuban gay cinema of the 1990s, as well as noting the irony of several of these films receiving state funding, based on the Cinematography Law. Though, David William Foster, a Latin American film scholar at Arizona State University, suggested that the government is happy with funding LGBT+ films because they know Venezuelans prefer to watch foreign films and so can guarantee the \\"gay productions\\" will just be \\"minor pests\\" domestically. Comparatively, a Venezuelan LGBT+ rights lawyer José Manuel Simons assures that the people of Venezuela, as reflected by the topic appearing so much in film, are accepting and ready to move towards LGBT+ equality, saying that the government is resisting and needs to catch up. The wave's beginnings post- Chávez's death have been compared to the rise of Pedro Almodóvar following the death of Franco. Until 2017, the country had one LGBT+ film festival, which had started in 2011: FESTDIVQ (Festival Venezolano de Cine de la Diversidad).:293 An opinion piece by José González Vargas in 2019 discussed his appreciation for the growing collection of LGBT Venezuelan films. He recalls that as he grew up, gay characters were either comic, tragic, or upper-class white Americans. Unhappy with the first two representations and feeling alien to the latter, González notes that though he knew he was gay, he couldn't actually associate with anything that this was supposed to mean. He says that \\"around 2010, something changed\\" and he could see his community and reality reflected onscreen for the first time. Alfredo Castro, who won an award for his role in Desde Allá Famous examples include Rondón's Pelo malo (2013); ostensibly a coming-of-age story, but which even explicitly runs deeper into inherent problems with Venezuelan society. Pelo malo won the Golden Shell at the 2013 San Sebastián International Film Festival, whilst Miguel Ferrari's Azul y no tan rosa (2012), which did receive public funding from a government program, became the first Venezuelan film to win the Goya Award for Best Spanish Language Foreign Film in its 2014 edition; the two films have been described as \\"wakeup calls against intolerance and homophobia in today’s society\\". In 2015, Claudia Pinto's film Desde Allá became the first Venezuelan, and first Latin American, film to win the Golden Lion at the Venice International Film Festival. Pelo malo and Desde Allá both discuss other issues common in Venezuela, namely racism and prostitution; Azul y no tan rosa instead is one of few recent Venezuelan films to be set in a middle- class environment, showing that discrimination and social tensions are still present here. The film trailer for Being Impossible Premiered at the Valladolid International Film Festival and South by Southwest, 2019 film Being Impossible, about a young intersex person, was commended for not ending tragically, with one reviewer adding that this is especially poignant as a Venezuelan film, bringing up the discussion of its societal context with the nation's \\"policy concerns regarding gay and queer rights that have yet to be addressed\\". González Vargas critiques some of the higher-profile Venezuelan films, saying that Azul y no tan rosa still feels foreign because of how easy being openly gay is for the main character at a time when it was still dangerous to be out in the country, comparing it to the injustices in Pelo malo that made it resonate with him. Women in filmmaking Margot Benacerraf in 2012Fina Torres in 2010 In her 1993 article, the American scholar of Venezuelan cinema, Karen Schwartzman, determines that female Venezuelan directors are not a unified group as in other film cultures, and a distinction based on gender is completely arbitrary.:33 Most notably, throughout the industry's history there seems to be no gender discrimination, allowing female filmmakers as many opportunities and as much success as any man.:34-35 Schwartzman also notes how many Venezuelan women filmmakers were not, during her investigations in the early 1990s, in any contact with other women of the same profession; though she adds that this was on the presumption that there were no other female filmmakers, suggesting a mental perception of discrimination.:33 There has been a feminist film collective in Venezuela: Grupo Feminista Miércoles (English: Feminist Group Wednesday), founded in 1978.:36 Schwartzman reports that in Venezuelan film history, there have been 45 female directors with a collective 75 works. The nation has the third- highest percentage of female filmmakers, after Argentina and Brazil, and the number and output of these creators followed national trends through its cinematic history.:33 Schwartzman described the contribution of female filmmakers to the national identity as \\"significant\\".:34 There are films created in the 1910s and 20s by Prudencia Grifell, a Spanish-born actress who formed a production company called Nostra, serving many roles in front of and behind the camera,:42, 49 but in the modern era the first female Venezuelan filmmaker is Margot Benacerraf. Benacerraf made two films, the short Reverón (1952) and the feature Araya (1959); they are considered landmarks, and may be viewed as prototypical of New Latin American Cinema.:34 Araya won some of the nation's earliest international accolades. In 1965, Benacerraf became the director of cultural activities at Museo Bellas Artes, helping to reinvigorate arts in the nation after the civil wars of the early 1960s.:34 However, the 1960s was not particularly fruitful in regards to film in general, with only one known film created by a woman in the decade, an ethnographic film by anthropologist María Mathilde Suárez about the Warao people.:35 Benefitting from the oil boom of the 1970s, a female filmmaker called María Lourdes Carbonell received state funding for three feature films. In all, Lourdes produced seven films between 1970 and 1976, before emigrating to Greece; this achievement in creativity is seen by Schwartzman as remarkable for anyone.:35 Also coming to prominence in the 1970s was Solveig Hoogesteijn, a Swedish immigrant who created films with a lot of national sentiment, including typical coastal settings and featuring magical realism.:35 Women working in short films in the decade include Silvia Manrique, Marilda Vera, Fina Torres, and Ana Cristina Henríquez; Liliane Blaser set up an experimental workshop, creating films focusing on Super 8 film, including Apocalípsis no, ¡urbanismo!, an early look at environmental issues in Caracas.:36 Also in the 1970s, the political film group Cine Urgente was founded by Jacobo Borges; two women who later helped found Grupo Miércoles were members: Josefina Jordán and Franca Donda.:35 These women and Josefina Acevedo made films that were significant politically and culturally at the time, like ¡Sí, Podemos!. Another film, María de la Cruz is considered by Schwartzman to be the first Venezuelan film by women about women, critically looking at the experiences of the titular woman in society.:36 All three were founders of Grupo Miércoles, along with Carmen Luisa Cisneros, Ambretta Marrosu, Vincenzina Marotta, and Giovanna Merola; the group's first major work was an audiovisual presentation, Las alfareras de lomas bajas, in 1980.:36 Torres, Vera, and Hoogesteijin each produced notable works in the 1980s,:37-38 with the newer Haydee Ascanio creating another women's film in 1987, Unas son de amor, looking at controversial abortion issues. Also released this year was what could be considered one of the nation's greatest and most successful films, Hoogesteijin's Macu, The Policeman's Woman, which notably took in more at the Venezuelan box office than films like Superman and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial — Schwartzman writes about how the film creates and disrupts feminists narratives in the story of Macu and her relationship with Ismael.:38 Throughout the 1980s were multiple political short films, with some female directors venturing into animation. In 1989, María Eugenia Martínez created the animated film Febrero, deemed an accurate representation of the Caracazo; in the same year, Haydee Pino made La ventana and Diálogo, looking at female and transvestite sexuality.:40 Despite the downturn, female filmmakers continued to make political short films in the 1990s, with more focus on riots and el Caracazo, like Blaser's Venezuela, 27 de febrero and La otra mirada.:41 Another work of women's film was an experimental documentary produced by the British Channel 4. Mónica Henríquez's Crónicas ginecológicas, based on a book by Elisa Lerner, looks at the changing station of Venezuelan women in the 1930s and 40s.:42 More recently, Gabriela Rodríguez became the first Latin American woman to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards for producing Alfonso Cuarón's Roma.  Facilities  Movie Planet cinema in Maturín The total number of cinema facilities in Venezuela in 2013 was 125; this is slightly up from the previous year, but still almost half of the figure in 2010. The number of total cinema screens, however, was the highest it has been in UNESCO records at 481, due to the steady increase in multiplex facilities. There were 84,493 cinema seats in the country this year, again a record, with the number of seats per screen consistently averaging ~180. Variety stated in 2017 that, whilst cinemas typically rely on concession stands to make a profit, popcorn and hot-dog buns are particularly scarce. The 2017 Venezuelan protests also affected cinemas after four Caracas cinema facilities were tear gassed by the government. However, the article pitted such barriers to cinema profit against the peoples' rising \\"demand for escapist fare\\". The organisation Gran Cine operates free film festivals, with public mobile cinemas across the country, to enable more people to watch films from around the world.  Viewership and economy  Filmgoers at an open-air cinema screening in 2015 In 2013, a total of 286 feature films were screened in Venezuela, a massive decrease from only a few years earlier in 2008, which saw 783 features play. The percentage of these that were national, i.e. Venezuelan-produced, was 21.7%; an increase on 2008's 9.3%, resulting in not much difference in real number. Despite the great reductions in both cinemas and films, the box office admissions in 2013 was 30,069,381; this number follows a steady increase in viewership that hasn't wavered. However, though almost 22% of all films were national, these only saw 2,429,560 admissions, about 8% of the total. The box office gross took leaps in 2013, though this may be attributed to the changes in currency value over only a few years affecting the numbers where it wouldn't in countries with a more stable economy: the 2008 average ticket price was 10 bolívares, and in 2013 it was 47. Below is a chart plotting the box office from 2009–2013 in USD when adjusted for inflation. The attendance frequency also rose to its highest, with every person in Venezuela averaging 1.1 visits. In the following years, according to an article from 2017, the cost of marketing films during periods of hyperinflation particularly prevented exports to the nation, increasing the pirate DVD rates and in some periods decreasing cinema attendance. Despite rising ticket prices and reasonably steady viewership, Venezuelan cinema as an industry still makes a loss. Director Carlos Malavé explained in 2018 that \\"evidently, the Venezuelan cinema does not work\\", that \\"making a standard film in Venezuela [is] a lot of money compared with the return you'll get\\", and that \\"the market doesn't exist\\" for films in the country on the scale it does in others. A similar situation has been present for much of the industry's history, propped up by government funding, since the development of production companies in the 1960s; a Venezuelan film history review explains that most of these fell to idleness after only one film, unable to keep going with the financial losses, blaming this on exhibitioners only being interested in foreign films. Of course, one reason why the loss is so great every year is due to the amount of money put forward by the government projects to support national film; in 2005 Roman Chalbaud received 3 billion bolivares to produce El Caracazo, more than double the entire national box office revenue for a year.  Organizations = Centro Nacional Autónomo de Cinematografía  The Centro Nacional Autónomo de Cinematografía (English: Autonomous National Centre for Filmmaking; CNAC) is the governing body of film public policy in Venezuela. Its primary functions are to promote and support the production and distribution of national film, which it does by awarding financial grants to productions with directors who are Venezuelan citizens or legal residents. In 2017, the government of Nicolás Maduro appointed a new chair to the CNAC, Aracelis García, a government minister.

The film depicts the life of Florence Nightingale and her work with wounded British soldiers during the Crimean War. Plot Illustrating the political complexities the hard-headed nurse had to battle in order to achieve sanitary medical conditions during the Crimean War. Opposed in the uppermost circles of British government because she is \\"merely\\" a woman, Florence Nightingale is championed by the Hon. Sidney Herbert (Michael Wilding), minister of war. Herbert pulls strings to allow Nightingale and her nursing staff access to battlefield hospitals, and in so doing changes the course of medical history.

Honorable mention should be given to Lewthwaite's editing of the war sequences.\\"; while Leonard Maltin also gave the film three out of four stars, noting a \\"Methodical recreation of 19th- century nurse-crusader Florence Nightingale, tastefully enacted by Neagle.\\"; while Variety observed, \\"Anna Neagle adds another portrait to her screen gallery of famous women. Her characterization of Florence Nightingale is a sincerely moving study...Michael Wilding is not too happily cast as Sidney Herbert, War Minister. Within limitations, he makes the best of this part. The strong feature cast includes Felix Aylmer, with an exceptionally good study of Lord Palmerston.

Operations began in 1715, making it the earliest copper mine in New Jersey and one of the oldest in the United States. In 1755, it was the site of the first use of a steam engine assembled in America. Later, starting in 1794, the first steam engine was manufactured in the United States near here. Shortly before and after, but not during, the revolutionary war, the mine was a major copper producer. Even though nothing remains of the mining operations above ground, the collapse of the underground shafts and tunnels caused damage as recently as 1989.https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/01/nyregion/north-arlington-journal- long-forgotten-mine-shafts-come-back-to-haunt-borough.html The mine was also known as the Arlington, Belleville, or Victoria copper mine.  History  Around 1710, Arent Schuyler purchased a large tract of land in New Barbadoes Neck. A few years later, around 1712–1713, a significant deposit of copper ore was discovered on the property. At Arent Schuyler's death, his three sons, Adonijah, John, and Peter, inherited his lands, with John managing the mine. In 1748, flooding in the mine led John Schuyler to order a Newcomen steam engine and pumping equipment from Jonathan Hornblower of Cornwall, England. The equipment arrived in 1753 and was installed by Jonathan's brother Josiah Hornblower. It started operations in 1755 to pump water out of the mine. This Hornblower engine was then used in one of the oldest and deepest, more than , mine shafts in America. It was later called the Victoria shaft and eventually reached a depth of . In 1773, after the engine house burned for the third time, mining ceased and it remained idle during the revolutionary war. After the war was over, mining could resume, but the mines needed to be cleared of water. Instead of buying steam engines from England, the owners set up a foundry and machine shop in nearby Belleville. Here, starting in 1794, the first steam engine was manufactured in the United States.  Production  The earliest production record is a shipment of 110 casks of copper ore sent to Holland in April, 1721. It had to be exported since the colonists were not allowed to refine any native ore. The yield of ore during the 1720s was about . Minor amounts of gold and silver were also produced from the copper ore.  Geology  The mine is located in the shales and sandstones of the Passaic Formation where a Triassic diabase sill has intruded. The primary copper minerals found here were the grayish chalcocite and the bright blue-green chrysocolla. In addition, lesser amounts of malachite, azurite, cuprite, and native copper were present.

Towneley Hall in Burnley, Lancashire, was the family seat until its sale, together with the surrounding park, to the corporation of Burnley in 1901. Towneley Hall is now a Grade I listed building and a large museum within Towneley Park (UK). Early members of the branch of the family at Towneley Hall served as soldiers, some holding positions such as High Sheriff of Lancashire. However they generally retained the Catholic faith meaning that from the mid 16th century they were fined and imprisoned for recusancy and banned from public office until the Roman Catholic Relief Act of 1829. Other branches of the family were based at Hurstwood near Towneley, Royle on the opposite side of Burnley and later Littleton in Surrey, Dutton close to Ribchester, Barnside near Colne, and Carr Hall and Stonedge near Barrowford. The Towneleys of Towneley Hall Sometime between 1195 and 1211, Roger de Lacy made a grant of lands at 'Tunleia', 'Coldcotes' and 'Snodesworth' (Snodworth is south of Langho) to Geoffrey, son of Robert the Dean of Whalley. By 1295 Nicholas de Towneley, thought to be a descendant of Geoffrey, had died and Towneley was shared between his three sisters Agnes, Cecily and Isabel. Cecily was married to John de la Legh, the son of Gilbert, the manager of the local de Lacy cattle farms. The de la Legh family were the largest tenant in Cliviger at the time that it was a possession of Kirkstall Abbey, renting about 40% of the township. And Gilbert had purchased the manor of Hapton in 1303–04, only to have this blocked by Henry de Lacy, and he was forced to wait until 1328 to acquire it. The same year he also purchased Isabel's third of Towneley from her family, the Claytons. John and Cecily had two sons, Gilbert and Richard. While Gilbert would take control at Hapton and also purchase the neighbouring manor of Birtwistle in 1356, Richard would take Towneley. Richard de Towneley (c.1313–1381) Richard de Towneley, also known as Richard de la Legh, was born circa 1323. By 1345 he had married Ellen. In 1351, at the time of the plague known as the Black Death, Richard rented the manor of St Saviour (Stydd) near Ribchester, probably living there for the rest of his life. The same year, along with his brother Gilbert, the Abbot of Whalley and John de Altham, he held the franchise for providing a bailiff for Blackburnshire. In 1353 he was one of two receivers for Lancashire appointed by the 1st Duke of Lancaster, also attending the Parliaments of 1361 and 1371 as a knight of Lancashire. He was Escheator of the County in 1371 and served as the High Sheriff of Lancashire from 1374 to 1377. He died on 16 April 1381, survived by three sons, John, Robert and Henry. John Towneley (1350–1399) Married Isabella de Rishton, probably in 1382. John's uncle Gilbert died without heir, so in addition to two-thirds of Towneley, plus land in Cliviger, in Worsthone, and in Briercliffe, he inherited Hapton and Birtwistle. By 1388 he had acquired the remaining third of Towneley from the descendants of Agnes. Richard Towneley (1387–1455) Married Alice. Man-at-arms at the battle of Agincourt.

The film stars Judy Geeson as a psychologically-fragile woman who, upon relocating to a rural boarding school where her husband has taken a job, finds herself being tormented by a mysterious figure with a prosthetic arm. Peter Cushing and Joan Collins, respectively, also star as the school's mysterious headmaster and his wife. Like many horror films of its era, Fear in the Night has been noted for its usage of female hysteria as a central narrative motif, and was released as a double bill in the United Kingdom with Straight on Till Morning, another Hammer film featuring similar themes. In the United States, the film was released as part of a double bill with Demons of the Mind.  Plot  Peggy (Judy Geeson), an unassuming twenty-two year old caregiver, has recently married Robert Heller (Ralph Bates), and is scheduled to move with him to a secluded boys' boarding school south of London for his work. The night before she is to meet Robert to leave the city, she is attacked in her home by a one- armed man with a prosthetic hand and falls unconscious. Rattled by the attack, she leaves with Robert the following morning to the boarding school, which is run by headmaster Michael Carmichael (Peter Cushing). Robert and Peggy arrive at the school, and settle into their chalet across the road from the main school building. They make plans to meet the Carmichaels for dinner that evening. The next day Robert leaves for work. Peggy explores the empty school; she hears the voices of boys chatting, but finds the classrooms to be mysteriously empty. She encounters the headmaster Michael, who shows her around the building; she leaves him in the school and returns to her cottage. Shortly after entering her house she is again attacked. Robert returns and is very concerned about Peggy's mental state; although Peggy insists that she was attacked, he doesn't believe her. He cancels the dinner appointment with the Carmichaels. Later, Peggy and Robert go for a drive around the sprawling property, where they meet the headmaster's wife, Molly (Joan Collins), who is rabbit hunting. Peggy finds Molly standoffish toward her. That evening, Robert leaves for a meeting in London, and Peggy believes an intruder has come into the chalet; she arms herself with a shotgun. She descends the staircase, and sees Michael entering the front door, and notices that he has a prosthetic arm; panicked, she shoots him, and flees the chalet, but he continues to pursue her. She runs into the school, where she hears a chorus of racket and boys' voices echoing through the halls. Michael corners her in an upstairs dormitory, and she shoots at him again, but he is unresponsive to the gunfire. He approaches her, and she faints. The following day, Robert returns, finding Peggy in a nearly catatonic state inside the school, and a pool of blood in the hallway. Michael is nowhere to be found. He questions her about what happened, but she says she cannot remember. Robert explains to Peggy that he had originally met Michael when he was working in a hospital as a medical student; the boarding school had nearly burned to the ground in an accident years prior, and, devastated, Michael returned to the property, setting up recordings of boys' laughter and classroom lectures over the building's intercoms to recreate the feeling of the school's former glory days. That night, Robert meets with Molly in the school; it is revealed that the two are having an affair, and that Robert married the mentally-fragile Peggy in order to coax her into murdering Michael out of fear for her life. Peggy stumbles in on their meeting, and Robert demands she reveal where Michael's body is. Molly goes to search for him, and shortly after, the sound of bells echoes throughout the school. Robert binds Peggy's arms and brings her into the main hall of the school, where Michael's voice comes over the intercom. He reveals that he was aware of Robert and Molly's plot to have him killed, and that he had loaded the shotgun in the chalet with blanks. Robert loads the shotgun with bullets, and shoots at what he believes to be Michael hiding under a sheet covering a couch. When he lifts the sheet, however, he reveals Molly's dead body, bound and gagged. Robert storms out of the school with Peggy, and attempts to hang her from the tree outside in a staged suicide, but is suddenly grabbed in a strangle grip by Michael. The next morning, two policemen arrive, saying they received a call from Michael. Peggy tells them he's inside the school, and that a new term is beginning. One of the police officers tells her that the school has been shut down for years, until suddenly the sound of a boys' choir begins emanating from the building. In the tree behind the school, Robert's dead body hangs from the noose.

The film had been scheduled to go into production several times: first in autumn 1964, then \\"tentatively\\" in 1965. In 1967 he retitled the film The Claw. It was not until 1971 that the script was altered by Sangster and co-writer Michael Syson and turned into Fear in the Night. Filming locations The film was shot on location in Aldenham, Hertfordshire. The scenes featuring the lakeshore (including the scene where Judy Geeson's character encounters Joan Collins') were shot at Aldenham Country Park around the Aldenham Reservoir. Bhaktivedanta Manor was used for the location of the boys' school. Additional filming took place at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire. Release Fear in the Night was released in the United Kingdom on 9 July 1972, shown as a double bill with Straight on Till Morning, another Hammer film with similar themes. The films were shown in cinemas as a double feature titled \\"Women in Fear.\\" Executive Michael Carreras at Hammer studios conceived the pairing as a marketing tool, stating: \\"My original concept was to have two properties by the same author on a central theme, being made into two films both directed by the same person.\\" The film later premiered as a double bill with the Hammer film Demons of the Mind in the United States on 18 October 1972, in conjunction with the Halloween season. Critical response Time Out called the film \\"one of those neatly constructed but slightly mechanical psycho-thrillers which make you feel as if someone is pushing buttons connected to electrodes in your brain\\", but that \\"Hammer fans will soon recognise the plot as a thinly disguised reworking of A Taste of Fear (sic)\\". Graeme Clark of The Spinning Image retrospectively rated the film 6 out of 10 stars, saying: \\"Fear in the Night did nothing to improve [Hammer Films]'s fortunes, but it received fair reviews and those who did see it found it satisfying, if a shade modest.\\" Dave Sindelar of SciFilm.org praised the film's performances, but criticized elements of its script, saying: \\"Unfortunately, it's at the service of one of the most predictable scripts I've encountered in some time, and this is one of those stories that should be anything but predictable\\", comparing the film to Gaslight (1944) and Diabolique (1955). Popcorn Pictures gave the film a middling review, calling it \\"a brave attempt by Hammer to go in a new direction but ultimately fails because even in 1972, the plot twists weren’t new or original in the slightest. It's entertaining enough if you want to stick it out but it will never be regarded as one of Hammer’s better films.\\" Home media The film was released on VHS in the United States by Thorn EMI home video, later receiving a VHS release through Republic Pictures in 1998. It was released for the first time on DVD in North America on 8 October 2002 by Anchor Bay Entertainment as part of their \\"Hammer Collection\\" series. It was later released in the United Kingdom on DVD by Studio Canal on 15 January 2007. On 30 October 2017, Studio Canal released a Blu-ray edition in the United Kingdom. Scream Factory announced in 2019 that they will be releasing a Blu- ray edition in North America on 27 August 2019. Critical analysis Literary critic John Kenneth Muir has noted Fear in the Night as a mood piece, as well as an example of the gendered fictional representations of \\"damsels in distress,\\" a motif that was recurrent in horror films of the era, including amongst Hammer Studios' films itself— Straight on Till Morning, which Fear in the Night was paired with upon its British theatrical release, contains similar themes of female hysteria. Muir likens the film to the 1971 American horror film Let's Scare Jessica to Death, in which a psychologically-fragile female figure, also displaced in a new and strange environment, is tormented by events and visions which may or may not be occurring in reality. \\"Despite such threadbare material,\\" Muir says, \\"there is an interesting sexual undercurrent to the film.\\" Commenting on the film's establishing cinematography, Muir further states: > Fear in the Night starts with a pan across a field, as leaves blow across > it. We then see the abandoned school that is the film's central setting, and > experience a feeling of isolation and foreboding. Then the soundtrack > broadcasts eerie singsongy young voices lifted in song, as the camera probes > the gym, the dining room, the bunk room... It's a strange tour of a > seemingly haunted or perhaps cursed place, and the (effective) punctuation > of the montage is a view of a hanging corpse. It's an artistic, interesting > way to set the scene for the story proper, but the film never again recovers > from the icy, morbid impression of its opening. David Huckvale, author of Hammer Films' Psychological Thrillers, 1950-1972, compared the film's treatment of flashback and time to Parsifal, and claims that the film operates as a \\"series of essays on nostalgia\\"— \\"The plot of Fear in the Night depends on Peggy's vulnerability caused by [...] trauma, and much of the film's dramatic tension is built upon her anxiety that the past is not over and done with.\\" Huckvale also draws comparisons on the character of Molly Carmichael (Joan Collins) as a catalyst to Peggy's purported hysteria, likening her to the unnamed wife of Maximilian de Winter in Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca. \\"[The character] of Peggy marries a man she knows little about and then finds herself transplanted into a grand house with its own intimidating rituals, but with the major difference that the Rebecca figure is still there in the form of Joan Collins' Molly Carmichael,\\" Huckvale says. \\"Peggy sees the heartless Molly shoot a cute little rabbit. Molly is a brutal, catlike character, and her superficial smile collapses when Peggy and Robert leave.\\" Huckvale's interpretation of the scene between Peggy (Judy Geeson) and Headmaster Carmichael (Peter Cushing), during which he removes her hair-tie, as a metaphor for sexual violation, echoing John David Muir's claim of the film's sexual undercurrents: > Just as the Biblical Samson's hair signified his virility, so too does > Mélisande's hair stand for her sexual allure. Thus, when Carmichael unties > Peggy's hair band, we are intended to interpret the act as a form of > sublimated rape— at least that is the implication at this stage in the plot. > It also gives Sangster an opportunity to reveal Carmichael's prosthetic arm, > which he threateningly clicks into position to hold one end of the ribbon > while he unties the knot with his other hand. Carmichael does indeed seem to > be the man who attacked Peggy in London, but things are never so obvious in > a Sangster script.

United States In its criminal justice section, the American Bar Association has adopted the following standard regarding the need for a factual basis:http://www.abanet.org/crimjust/standards/guiltypleas_blk.html ABA Criminal Justice Section, Standard 14-1.6 :Standard 14-1.6. Determining factual basis of plea ::(a) In accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the court should make such inquiry as may be necessary to satisfy itself that there is a factual basis for the plea. As part of its inquiry, the defendant may be asked to state on the record whether he or she agrees with, or in the case of a nolo contendere plea, does not contest, the factual basis as proffered. ::(b) Whenever a defendant pleads nolo contendere or pleads guilty and simultaneously denies culpability, the court should take special care to make certain that there is a factual basis for the plea. The offer of a defendant to plead guilty should not be refused solely because the defendant refuses to admit culpability. Such a plea may be refused where the court has specific reasons for doing so which are made a matter of record. In the 2008 book Criminal Procedure, author John M. Scheb pointed out that in the United States, a majority of the states have initiated measures to make sure that the plea is entered into of the defendant's own accord, and that it is grounded in a factual basis. Scheb wrote, \\"Most states have adopted similar rules of procedure to ensure that pleas are voluntary and comply with constitutional requirements.\\" He explained that judges have some discretion in determining the voluntary nature of the plea given by the defendant, \\"Rules concerning voluntariness and factual basis generally do not specify any precise method to be followed by the court. Judges employ various methods to determine voluntariness. Often these methods include interrogation of the defendant by the judge and sometimes by the prosecutor and defense counsel.\\" Scheb noted that, \\"The objective is to establish that no improper inducements have been made to secure a plea, that the defendant understands the basic constitutional rights incident to a trial, that these rights are being waived, and that he or she comprehends the consequences of the plea.\\" Scheb discussed the manner in which the court determines the factual basis for the plea, \\"In determining that a factual basis exists for the defendant's plea, judges often have the prosecutor briefly outline available proof to establish a prima facie case of the defendant's guilt. A more extensive inquiry is usually necessary for specific-intent crimes.\\" Scheb emphasized the importance why it is necessary to establish a factual basis for the plea, before it is entered by the defendant: \\"The thoroughness of the court's determination of voluntariness and factual basis becomes important if a defendant later moves to withdraw a plea and enter a plea of not guilty.\\" See also Alford plea References Category:American legal terminology ","title":"Factual basis"},{"id":"29180673","text":"Hygrophila auriculata (Sanskrit: gokaṇṭa,Bangla (বাংলা নাম): kulekhara(কুলেখাড়া)Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary s.v. gokaṇṭa at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/ kokilākṣa)Sanskrit names%95%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B7&dq;=%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B7&hl;=en&ei;=kXK2TPeWAoiucI- kvLAD&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=10&ved;=0CFAQ6AEwCTgK amarakosh, ch - 2, section - forest medicinal plants, verse no. - 104 is a herbaceous, medicinal plant in the acanthus family that grows in marshy places and is native to tropical Asia and Africa.Hygrophila auriculata in Flora of Pakistan, at Efloras.org at http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=5&taxon;_id=242422930 and IUCN Red list of Species at http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/168863/0 In India it is commonly known as kokilaksha or gokulakanta, in Sri Lanka as neeramulli.

Early life and career Flier was born in New York City, and grew up in the Pelham Parkway section of the Bronx. He is the son of Milton R. Flier, a World War II C-47 pilot and businessperson, and Dorothy (Kroll) Flier, who taught junior high school mathematics.https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/brookline- ma/dorothy-flier-6482780 He graduated in 1964 from the Bronx High School of Science, and 1968 from the City College of New York. He was in the first entering class of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in 1968, and graduated in 1972 with the Elster Prize for highest academic standing. After two years of internal medicine residency at Mount Sinai Hospital, he spent four years in the Public Health Service as a clinical associate at the National Institutes of Health, completing training in endocrinology and launching a research career. He moved to Boston in 1978, becoming an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and chief of the Diabetes Unit at Harvard- affiliated Beth Israel Hospital. He subsequently became chief of the hospital's Endocrinology Division, vice chair for research of the Department of Medicine, and eventually the hospital's chief academic officer in 2002, overseeing research and educational affairs. At HMS, he became the George C. Reisman Professor of Medicine, and Harvard faculty dean for Academic Affairs at what became the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Appointment as Dean of Harvard's Faculty of Medicine Flier was appointed dean of the Faculty of Medicine and the Caroline Shields Walker professor of medicine at Harvard in July 2007 by President Drew Faust and assumed the position on September 1, 2007. During his first year as dean, he led an extensive strategic planning process, releasing a report in October 2008. Harvard University and Harvard Medical School suffered financial losses when markets fell in 2008-9. This slowed but did not stop investments in several areas. Notably Flier penned an op-ed as Dean of Harvard Medical School opposing expansion of health insurance in the United States. His term as dean of Harvard Medical School ended in 2016 after nine years. Research contributions While at the Diabetes Branch of NIH, under the mentorship of Jesse Roth, Philip Gorden, and C. Ronald Kahn, Flier discovered the existence of autoantibodies to the insulin receptor as a cause of severe insulin resistance. This discovery elucidated a rare cause of diabetes, advanced the field of membrane receptor biology and provided an important tool for research on insulin action. Flier also played a major role in defining genetic causes of insulin resistance by identifying and characterizing mutations in the insulin receptor gene in a subset of patients with severe insulin resistance. Much of his research has addressed the pathophysiology of obesity. Among his work has been the discovery with Bruce Spiegelman of altered production of adipocyte secreted factors in obesity; investigations into the function of brown adipose tissue through creation of a brown fat deficient transgenic mouse; elucidation of the role of the neuropeptide MCH in energy balance by making an MCH knockout mouse (with his wife, Eleftheria Maratos-Flier); identification of the capacity of adult hypothalamic neurogenesis to occur and influence energy balance; and work with Maratos-Flier to define the role of FGF21 in metabolic regulation. His most extensive work has related to the biology and pathophysiology of leptin. His lab has defined the role of leptin as a key molecule in the physiology of starvation, and has provided evidence for the molecular mechanism of leptin resistance that characterizes and contributes to obesity. Personal life Flier is married to Eleftheria Maratos-Flier. She is an endocrinologist and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and the two have collaborated in several areas of research. They have two daughters. Sarah Flier, a gastroenterologist, is also an instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School.

Magpas Air Ambulance is an emergency medical charity that provides pre-hospital emergency care, in the air or on land, including treatments normally only available in hospital. The charity operates 24/7 from its base in Cambridgeshire and is activated to seriously ill or injured patients in Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire and the East of England – caring for a population of over 10 million. The Magpas Air Ambulance medical team combines the skills of a specialist doctor and critical care paramedic on every shift. They support the NHS ambulance services by providing treatments at the scene of life-threatening emergencies that would otherwise only be available in hospital. They are dispatched by both the East of England Ambulance Service and East Midlands Ambulance Service. History Magpas was founded as the Mid Anglia General Practitioner Accident Service in 1971 by Dr Neville Silverston OBE and Dr Derek Cracknell, who responded to road accidents in their own cars. The origins of the name relate to a close historical and geographical association with Cambridgeshire Constabulary which, until 1974, was known as the Mid-Anglia Constabulary. The service was originally provided by general practitioners from across the mid-Anglia area that was activated by the police and ambulance services to attend serious accidents and provide on- scene care. Magpas provided the training, equipment and governance framework. The organisation became a registered charity in 1972. The charity has been known as Magpas Air Ambulance since acquiring its own helicopter in 2013. Within the first five years that Magpas was operational the road accident fatality rate in mid-Anglia fell by 36%. In 1977, Magpas contributed to the foundation of the British Association for Immediate Care (BASICS) to raise and maintain the standards of care given by doctors responding to medical emergencies. Today BASICS is a recognised authority on pre-hospital immediate care and Magpas remains a member. As NHS paramedics developed so did the charity. It undertook detailed research into its effectiveness and reviewed the way it operated. In 1997, the charity entered a new partnership with Cambridgeshire Constabulary to use the police helicopter for deployment of medical staff and patient transport.[1] In 1999, Magpas Air Ambulance became the first service in the region to provide a night-time helicopter emergency medical service. In 2007, the East Anglian Air Ambulance agreed to provide a helicopter, dubbed Anglia Two, to be based out of RAF Wyton for daytime missions. Although this was withdrawn in 2010, and Magpas Air Ambulance went back to providing the whole service, in conjunction with the police. From 2000 until 2010, the charity developed a network of community first responder schemes across Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire. These local volunteers were trained by Magpas and then responded to medical emergencies such as chest pain and breathing difficulties in their local area. Their role was to treat the patient until the ambulance service arrived. In 2010, the Magpas Air Ambulance first responders were joined with other schemes under the leadership of the East of England Ambulance Trust. In 2010, East Anglian Air Ambulance announced plans for their helicopter service which would no longer rely on Magpas volunteers. In 2012, Magpas Air Ambulance began flying with its own helicopter, having paid to use a police helicopter for the preceding fifteen years. The charity was heavily involved in the creation of Pre-Hospital Emergency Medicine (PHEM), a sub-specialty of emergency medicine and anaesthesia recognised by the General Medical Council. Doctors train with Magpas in giving people facing serious medical emergencies lifesaving procedures and treatments which are not normally available outside of a hospital Magpas was registered with the Healthcare Commission, and was inspected by the Care Quality Commission in March 2014. This looks at the governance and quality assurance of the care provided to ensure it meets national standards. In October 2015, Magpas Air Ambulance announced it would provide a 24-hour service for emergency medical care and advice, although the helicopter is not available at all times. By doing so, it became the first air ambulance charity in the East of England region to offer round-the-clock care.

This project looks to identify lessons from all cases of traumatic injury occurring in Cambridgeshire. This can then be used to improve the quality of care and examine ways to prevent incidents in the first place.

IAPR, Vol. 26. Initial engagement Captain Sayhood was flying his MiG-29B in Iraq on the third day of the war in order to root out and shoot-down Coalition aircraft bombing Iraq. It is claimed that RAF pilots Gary Lennox and Adrian Weeks were flying their Panavia Tornado on a bombing mission at Tallil Airfield in Iraq. Sayhood spotted them and promptly brought them down with an R-60 missile from his MiG's arsenal. Weeks and Lennox were killed in the crash of their aircraft, serial ZA467. However this aircraft is recorded as having crashed on 22 January on a mission to Ar Rutbah. Second engagement Sayhood continued his mission defending Iraqi airspace and came across two F-15Cs piloted by Captains Craig Underhill and Cesar Rodriguez. Underhill and Rodriguez were pursuing another pair of MiG-29s when they spotted Sayhood and his wingman. Sayhood and his wingman promptly engaged the two American aircraft and one of the most intense dogfights of the Gulf War ensued. The two MiGs and F-15s flew straight at each other, each attempting to visually identify their aggressors. Underhill faced Sayhood's wingman, while Sayhood himself faced Rodriguez. Underhill fired an AIM-7 at Sayhood's wingman, hitting him head on and killing him instantly. At the same time, Rodriguez sensed a radar lock by Sayhood, throwing him onto the defensive. Rodriguez dove down to the deck in order to confuse Sayhood's radar with ground clutter, hoping to shake the radar lock on his aircraft. After seeing his wingman killed, Sayhood briefly broke off the attack. Rodriguez and Underhill started heading south for a tanker, when Sayhood approached them from the north. Rodriguez and Underhill turned around to face Sayhood. Underhill got a radar lock on Sayhood with an AIM-7, but didn't fire because he wasn't sure if Sayhood was friendly or not. Sayhood sliced into their formation causing a \\"classic merge\\". Underhill climbed, keeping his lock on Sayhood, while Rodriguez stayed committed to the merge in order to visually identify the aircraft as hostile. As they passed each other, Rodriguez identified it as Iraqi, and each pilot turned left to engage the other. Sayhood was relying on the MiG's better turning radius to get onto Rodriguez's tail. They slowly spiraled towards the ground until Sayhood attempted to pull out using a split-s. Rodriguez didn't follow, and just before Sayhood could pull out, he crashed into the ground.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The historic district covers and stretches from the campus of Palmer College of Chiropractic on the west to the Sacred Heart Cathedral Complex on the east. It is the western half of a neighborhood of the same name. When listed, the district included 12 contributing buildings. It includes Greek Revival, Italianate, and Victorian architecture. The district was covered in a 1982 study of Davenport Multiple Resource Area and/or its 1983 follow-on., (pages 1-30 of PDF document) History Cork Hill itself is the western section of a larger area of Davenport known as the LeClaire Reserve, named after the landowner and city founder Antoine LeClaire. It was a large Yankee-Irish neighborhood on the east side of town. The houses of the Cork Hill District reflect the long history of development of the LeClaire Reserve. The area developed in an unsystematic fashion that resulted in a mixture of architectural forms and styles on every block. with LeClaire himself built his home in the Reserve in 1855 and St. Margaret's Church in 1856. Other prominent families, such as the French's, also moved to the area. The family of industrialists were also patrons of the arts and literature in the city. Alice French, whose pen name was Octave Thanet, was known as the first Iowa author with a national reputation. The Irish started moving to Davenport after the Great Famine in Ireland of the 1840s and 1850s.Svendsen, 1-10 Because large numbers of Irish immigrants settled around St. Margaret's Church, the area became known as Cork Hill. Many of the Irish who located here were laborers who worked for the railroads or in the mills along the Mississippi River. Most of the houses belonging to the Irish families were replaced at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century by larger dwellings. However, because of this early association with the Irish the area surrounding Sacred Heart Cathedral, which replaced St. Margaret's in 1891, continues to be referred to as Cork Hill. Architecture House on Iowa Street The homes built in the Cork Hill District reflect most of the major architectural styles of the 19th century. They are, however, simpler than the homes found in the Hamburg Historic District, the former German neighborhood which is located on the bluff to the west. The contrast shows how the various styles were adapted to suit different income levels and tastes. For the most part, the houses here are two stories tall and frame construction. They are mostly single-family dwellings or were at the time they were built. Double houses were also built in the district and distinguishable by their double entrances. The earliest houses on Cork Hill were built in the Greek Revival style that was popular in early Davenport architecture and continued as the city matured. The Italianate style started to appear in the 1850s, and its use was popularized by LeClaire's house. It was followed by the Queen Anne and Gothic Revival styles. As the 19th century came to a close the Colonial Revival style became more popular, as did the American Craftsman and Victorian styles. A couple of houses were also influenced by the Prairie School. While most of the homes were built as single family structures, there is also a significant number of double houses on Cork Hill.

This area of study may have been touched on in a prior undergraduate degree but not studied in depth, or may never have been formally taught to the student. The degree is less often awarded now than in previous centuries, and is, at the current time, only awarded by two universities in Australia and four universities in Turkey. Australia Although the BLitt was once awarded by many Australian universities, the degree is now only awarded by Flinders University, Monash University as an arts-based degree exclusively for university graduates, and, until recently, the University of Western Australia. The BLitt was once offered by the Australian National University, Deakin University and the University of Melbourne. Brazil A Bachelor of Letters (Bacharelado em Letras) in Brazil typically requires coursework in Literature, Linguistics, and, depending on the institution, Translation Studies. In Brazil, it takes four to five years to complete a bachelor's degree in Letters, and graduates often pursue a career in translation or research. A Bachelor of Letters may differ from a Licentiate degree (Licenciatura em Letras), which focuses on teaching and Applied Linguistics, and thus includes coursework and seminars on pedagogy, as well as classroom practica to prepare graduates to become language instructors. It takes 4–5 years to complete a Licenciate Degree, and students are expected to focus their studies on a foreign language and/or Portuguese. Unlike a bachelor's degree in Letters, a Licenciate Degree allows graduates to teach at public schools in Brazil.  United Kingdom  The degree was awarded by the University of Oxford and a small number of other universities, including the University of Birmingham. It was still available at Oxford in 1977 though it has since been replaced by the more research-based Master of Letters.Examination decrees and regulations (University of Oxford, 1977): \\"Of the Admission of Candidates for the Degree of Bachelor of Letters i.

It reduces pressure on skin, heat loss, and contamination by waste produced by an animal or those it shares living space with.Straw is a commonly used bedding material  Types of bedding  Wood Shavings (pine, cedar, and aspen) are absorbent and have good odor control. Different textures such as fine cut, soft shreds, or thick cut are used for different animals. Wood shavings can be dusty and contain aromatic oils that can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary tract, or skin disorders and other health problems in some animals. Aspen and kiln-dried wood shavings tend to be less dusty, plus the oils are removed. Hemp Bedding is extremely absorbent and thus efficient, has good odor control and minimal dust, and provides more insulation than other bedding materials. Additionally, hemp is naturally pest-repellent and horses are not tempted to eat it. Due to its low dust, hemp bedding is recommended for horses with allergy or respiratory issues. From an environmental consideration, hemp is more sustainable than wood as it requires both less time and human intervention to grow repeatedly. Corncob Bedding contains no aromatic oils or dust. Corncobs are heat dried which makes it very absorbent. When water or urine is absorbed, the corncob will start molding so daily cleaning is needed. If not properly maintained, bacterial infections are likely to occur. Corncobs are cut to little pieces making it easy to ingest. This could be dangerous if ingested by a small animal. Paper Bedding includes either recycled paper or cardboard boxes. Paper bedding is ideal for animals with allergies since it contains no oils and little dust. Unlike corncob bedding, paper bedding has no adverse effects with consumption. Paper is very absorbent, but when saturated with water or urine, a strong odor results. Straw is a soft, dry stalks containing small grains such as barley, oats, rice, rye, and wheat. Straw is easy to handle and available in most agricultural areas. When deciding to use straw, is imperative to make sure that the straw is not palatable. To do this, the seed must be checked to ensure it is not available for consumption. Straw has excellent absorbency and is unlikely to mold. Hay is composed of grasses that have been cut then dried. Although hay is most commonly used for food, it also can be used for the purpose of animal bedding. This may result in an insufficient diet for the animal if it begins eating its bedding. In addition, old hay may give off dust that could result in respiratory problems. A disadvantage of using hay is that it is one of the more expensive beddings. It is quite absorbent but once it is soiled, it begins to decompose quickly producing an unpleasant odor. Because of the moisture, hay will mold quickly and could result in a bacterial infection. Wood Chips are a mixture of bark, sawdust, and post peelings. Agriculturalists use wood chips as a cost efficient bedding. While its cost may be desirable, woodchips provide minimal comfort and absorbency. Wood chips generate mold and mildew, because of its highly damp environment. This causes bacterial growth and potential infection if not changed often. Wood chips are also known to stain the coat of animals from bedding in the moist chips. Sawdust must be kiln‐dried to ensure cleanliness and absorbability. Sawdust ensures quick and easy cleaning, because of the soiled or wet material begins to clump together. Although the cleanup is easier, sawdust is known to create a lot of health problems such as respiratory, urinary tract, mastitis, and skin disorders. Sand is ideal when looking at microbial growth. Sand is the most comfortable bedding because of its natural ability to form to the animals curvature. However, large sand particles can cause abrasions and bruising on an animal. Another downfall is sand is not very absorbent and causes a difficult clean up of soiled materials.  Benefits of Bedding  Many animals benefit from bedding, including livestock, poultry, rodents and reptiles. Bedding, in the simplest context, provides comfort for these animals. When constructed properly, these cushioned structures decrease irritability and rough textures that can cause pain, pressure, and stress on the subject. This also prevents bruising and sores to preserve the physical beauty of the animal. Bedding also creates an environment of moisture retention. Although incapable to prevent all microbial activity, bedding absorbs a substantial amount of moisture within the animal’s living environment. Soaking up excess urine, bedding assists in keeping the cage dry until the next change. A drier cage also promotes ventilation which decreases harmful levels of environmental pathogens. These factors are few of many. With insulation against cold weather and drafts amongst the list, odor control sustains a position as well. Assistance in decreasing and filtering dust to protect against respiratory infections ranks high. Creating an environment conducive for thermoregulation and chemical resistance, along with simple privacy, bedding is ideal for many animal types. All these factors relay a decreases in stress and pain encouraging peaceful resting opportunities that intern increase the overall life, productivity, and well being of the animal.  Maintenance of Bedding  Bedding maintenance is an important part of both human and animal health, cleanliness, and well being. Storage of bedding is important to insure that the bedding does not ruin. The best place to store it is in an environment that is dry and above ground level. Frequent bedding change is important to decrease the amount of bacteria. The most bacterial contaminated area is the front of the stall. This area should receive the most attention when cleaning and changing the bedding. Bedding should not be throughout the stall, it should be clear of the feeding and watering trough. It is recommended that the bedding is more frequently changed when there are a great number of animals, since the bedding will become contaminated faster. It is important to note that weather, frequent bedding maintenance, barn design, ventilation, and stall management influence bacteria levels. When one or several of these things change or are not met the susceptibility of illness significantly increases. These illnesses are potentially deadly to these animals and that is why the maintenance of bedding is so important.

Description The museum was opened to the public in 1980, originally named Iron Mission State Park for the pioneering attempts of Mormon settlers to create an iron industry. The museum name was changed in 2009, as the park grew and expanded around Gronway Parry's collection of horse-drawn vehicles and agricultural implements. Over the years other programs and activities have been added such as pioneer craft demonstrations, rotating art exhibits, interpretive lectures, guided curation tours, and a Junior Curator program. Museum displays include horse-drawn vehicles used from 1850 to 1920 and a collection of pioneer artifacts. An iron industry exhibit features the only known remaining artifact from the original foundry - the town bell. Other items of interest include several historic cabins, a large collection of horse-drawn farm equipment, and a replicated pioneer household. Ruins at Old Iron Town, August 2008 Frontier Homestead also manages the historic ruins of Old Iron Town, an iron foundry west of Cedar City that operated in the mid 19th century. History Lack of iron was a major concern to pioneers who began settling in Utah in 1847. When iron deposits were discovered in southern Utah, Mormon leader Brigham Young called for volunteers to colonize the area. A site near Coal Creek, now Cedar City, was selected in November 1851 for the iron works. Ten months later, the colony completed construction of a small blast furnace and began to operate the iron foundry. Despite its initial success, the 'Iron Mission' faced many difficulties. Financial troubles, floods, heavy freezes and furnace failure took their toll. In addition, a crop shortage threatened starvation. The people persevered in the face of these obstacles, but the foundry was eventually closed in 1858.

Gameplay Mass Destruction is a single-player only game. The player takes control of a tank, which is viewed from an overhead perspective, and undertakes various missions in which the objective is to destroy a specific object in their environment, while avoiding being killed by the enemy forces. The player chooses from three models of tank: one which moves fast but has weak armor, one which moves slow but has heavy armor, and one which is a moderate mix of both assets. The tank has a selection of weapons, some with limited ammunition. The gun turret can be rotated independently of the tank's movement, allowing the player to proceed in one direction while firing in another. In addition to a primary objective, each mission has optional secondary objective which award the player bonus points if completed. Reception While some reviewers described the game as \\"simplistic\\" and \\"mindless\\", most found its stripped-down action enjoyable. The lack of a multiplayer option was widely criticized. GamePro said the missions eventually become somewhat monotonous, but the game is \\"uninhibited destructive fun that's worth at least a shot as a weekend rental.\\" Next Generation similarly stated that \\"MD is a solid, beautiful, and fun game to play, but only if played in short, controlled bursts.\\" James Price of Saturn Power criticized that much less strategy is required to survive missions than in similar games such as Soviet Strike, while Lee Nutter argued in Sega Saturn Magazine that Mass Destruction is intended as a game of achieving high scores rather than simple completion of the campaign. Jeff Gerstmann commented in GameSpot, \\"The mission-based gameplay brings a method to the madness, but one still gets the happy feeling of cruising around aimlessly in a tank and blowing up as many things as possible, friend or foe.\\" Though most reviewers did not compare versions of the game, three of Electronic Gaming Monthlys four reviewers scored the Saturn version higher than the PlayStation version, saying it has much sharper graphics and shorter load times. Next Generation said the Saturn version has better control and animation effects, though they noted it lacks the building transparencies seen in the PlayStation version.

The unusual spores led to the species being named the type species of the now-abandoned genus Astrosporina; recent studies have shown that such a genus could not exist, as the species with the defining traits do not form a monophyletic group. However, it is a part of several clades within the genus Inocybe. I. praetervisa grows on the ground in woodland, favouring beech trees, and is found in Europe, North America and Asia. It is inedible and probably poisonous due to the presence of muscarine. The ingestion of muscarine can lead to SLUDGE syndrome, and could potentially lead to death due to respiratory failure. Taxonomy and naming Inocybe praetervisa was first described by Lucien Quélet in the first volume of Giacomo Bresadola's 1883 publication Fungi tridentini. The species was moved to the genus Astrosporina by Joseph Schröter in 1889, but this was rejected, and the name Astrosporina praetervisa is now considered an obligate synonym.\\"Inocybe praetervisa\\". MycoBank. The International Mycological Association. Accessed 13 October 2010. Astrosporina praetervisa was the type species of the no longer recognised genus.\\"Astrosporina\\". MycoBank. The International Mycological Association. Accessed 23 October 2010. The specific epithet praetervisa comes from the Latin word meaning \\"overlooked\\". Within the genus Inocybe, I. praetervisa has been placed in the subgenus Inocybe. Mycologist Rolf Singer places the species in the section Marginatae; mycologist Thom Kuyper considers Marginatae a supersection, and includes I. praetervisa along with I. abietis, I. calospora and I. godeyi. Phylogenetics has shown that, in addition to the large clade of subgenus Inocybe, I. praetervisa forms a clade with I. calospora, I. lanuginosa and I. leptophylla. The species are similar in that all four have basidiospores with small nodules; it was this feature that defined the genus Astrosporina, with then A. praetervisa as its type species. However, when phylogenetic analysis later concluded that nodulose-spored Inocybe species do not form a monophyletic group, the name Astrosporina was deemed inappropriate at a generic level. But it may be considered useful at a lower level to refer to the clade of the four Inocybe species. Of those four, I. praetervisa is most closely related to I. calospora, with which it forms a smaller and closer clade. A different study also found the close relationship between I. praetervisa and I. calospora; it also named I. teraturgus as a part of the clade containing I. praetervisa, I. calospora, I. lanuginosa and I. leptophylla. Description Inocybe praetervisa has a bell-shaped (later expanding) cap of in diameter, which is a yellowish-brown colour. It is fibrous, and splits from the margin (which curves inwards) to the centre. The stem is from in height, and from thick. It is white, maturing to a pale straw- yellow, and the whole stem is farinaceous, meaning it is covered in particles resembling meal. The stem has a distinct bulb at the base, which is moderately marginate, and lacks a ring. The flesh is white, and discolours to yellowish in the stem. The gills are initially whitish, but later become a clay-brown with toothed, white edges. They are adnexed, meaning they connect to the stem by only part of their depth, and are crowded closely together. Microscopic features Inocybe praetervisa leaves a clay-brown spore print, while the spores themselves are rectangular with a large number of \\"distinct, angular knobs\\". In size, the spores measure between in length by between in width. Inocybe praetervisa has both pleuro- and cheilocystidia which are relatively spindle-shaped with apical encrustation. The cystidia have hyaline or pale yellow walls. Similar species The species can be differentiated from the similar I. cookei by its \\"irregular, lumpy spores\\". It is also similar to I. rimosa, but differs in the presence of a bulb. Another species that can be differentiated by the lack of a bulb is I. numerosigibba. Habitat and distribution Inocybe praetervisa is an ectomycorrhizal species, and is found on the ground in mixed, deciduous or even coniferous woodland. It typically favours beech.Phillips, Roger. \\"Inocybe praetervisa \\" RogersMushrooms.com. Accessed 13 October 2010. Mushrooms grow solitarily or in \\"trooping groups\\" in late summer and throughout autumn, though it is not commonly encountered species. It is found in Europe, Asia and North America. Edibility and toxicity The species has a mild, indistinct taste, and a faint smell of flour. Mycologist Roger Phillips describes its edibility as \\"suspect\\", recommending that it be avoided, and notes that it is possible that the species is poisonous; most species of Inocybe have been shown to contain poisonous chemicals. Mycologist Ian Robert Hall lists the mushroom as containing the poisonous compound muscarine. Consumption of muscarine could lead to a number of physiological effects, including: excess salivation, lacrimation, uncontrollable urination and defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting); this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due to respiratory failure.

The EP is a follow-up companion to her debut album, Animal (2010). Originally, the record was thought to be released as a deluxe edition of Animal titled Animal + Cannibal, but was instead sold and released as both an EP and a deluxe edition of Animal. Kesha worked with a variety of producers and writers such as executive producer Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco, Ammo, Max Martin, Bangladesh and others. Musically, the songs on Cannibal are of the dance-pop genre, with some songs incorporating elements of electro and electropop in their production and beats. Throughout the album, the use of Auto-Tune and vocoders is prominent. Lyrically, the songs on Cannibal speak of ignoring judgement or hate and experiences based on love and heartbreak. Cannibal received generally positive reviews from music critics. However, a common complaint amongst critics was the overuse of Auto-Tune, while the album's production was generally highlighted. The album's lyrics generally polarized music critics; some praised her boldness, while others criticized them as being too raunchy. In the United States, the EP reached a peak of fifteen on the Billboard 200 albums chart, selling 74,000 copies in its first week of release. In Canada, the album achieved similar success, reaching a peak of fourteen on the country's albums chart. Cannibal was certified Platinum in 2018 by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of 1 million copies. Two singles were released from the album. The lead single, \\"We R Who We R\\", was a worldwide success, reaching number one in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, and charting within the top ten in numerous other countries. In the United States, the song became the seventeenth song in the Billboard Hot 100's history to debut at number one. The album's second single, \\"Blow\\", was released on February 8, 2011. The song reached top ten positions in multiple countries, including Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Kesha promoted the EP and her debut album by her first headlining concert tour, entitled the Get Sleazy Tour, in 2011. In January 2020, the title track \\"Cannibal\\" enjoyed a resurgence in popularity due to its use on social media site TikTok. The song went so far as to reach the top forty on the Canadian Hot 100. Background and development Originally believed to only be a re-release of her debut album Animal, Cannibal was instead released both as a deluxe edition of Animal as well as a standalone extended play (EP). The EP has been classified as a follow up \\"nine-song companion\\" record to Animal. Cannibal was originally intended to contain anywhere between four and eight tracks with the final outcome instead consisting of eight tracks, and a remix of her debut album's title track, for a total of nine tracks. Partial recording of the album took place during September 2010, at Conway Studios with Dr. Luke again as the executive producer. Kesha recorded the abundance of Cannibal over a two-week span with a variety of producers Qu1k and more; the short recording period was due to her only being available for a limited amount of time due to prior commitments. During an interview with Billboard conducted by Chris Willman, one of the potential songs for the album was used as an example of how Luke and Kesha collaborated to create a song for this record: \\"There's an unfinished chorus on this new track, in which Gottwald is singing through such distorted Auto-Tune, it's impossible to tell what he's saying-which is deliberate, so he won't unduly influence Ke$ha when she comes up with her own lyrics.\\" Like her debut album, Kesha worked with some previous producers and writers that worked with her on her first album, such as: Dr. Luke, Ammo, Benny Blanco and Max Martin. Unlike her debut album though, Kesha enlisted the help of producer Bangladesh. She explained the reason for enlisting his help was that she wanted to \\"add a tougher edge to her music\\". She said that the message she wanted to put out through this album was to create \\"good, positive, [danceable] music\\". She elaborated, \\"I feel like I'm creating this hopefully very youthful and irreverent movement of the kids, of like adolescence. I feel like the parents don't get it, but the kids get it. And they deserve to have more good, positive music.\\" Composition Musically, the songs on Cannibal are of the dance-pop genre, while some of its songs incorporate elements of electro and electropop in its production and beats. Throughout the album, the use of Auto-Tune and vocoders are prominent. The album's title track, \\"Cannibal\\", makes use of synth and dance driven backings while Kesha sings about maneater tendencies and makes a reference to serial killer, Jeffrey Dahmer. Present throughout the song are snippets of Kesha yodeling. \\"Blow\\" shows a darker side of Kesha with lyrics like: \\"We get what we want/ We do what you don't.\\" The song is more dominantly an electro infused track that uses a synth beat backing. Vocally the song uses snippets of Kesha's yodeling, combined with heavy use of Auto-Tune. \\"Sleazy\\" changes pace from Kesha's normally persistent \\"talk-singing\\" vocal style, to a more rap- driven style. She raps over a thundering bass line and ticking beat backing, while the song speaks of wealthy men hitting on Kesha, trying to buy her attention. The song has been cited for drawing influence from multiple songs including; Gwen Stefani's \\"Hollaback Girl\\" for its \\"swagga\\", Jennifer Lopez's \\"Love Don't Cost a Thing\\" for its \\"attitude\\", as well as combining \\"a touch of Lil Wayne's \\"Milli\\". \\"C U Next Tuesday\\" is a dance-pop song that talks about \\"lost and unrequited love\\" \\"The Harold Song\\" has been cited as the album's power ballad that features a more stripped down vocal style portraying a vulnerable side of Kesha. \\"Grow a Pear\\" is an electropop song with lyrical content that has been compared to Katy Perry's, \\"Ur So Gay\\". The album's lead single, \\"We R Who We R\\", is a dance-pop song that uses a synth-heavy backing. The song incorporates elements of trance pop and electropop it both its production, and beats. Lyrically, the song has been described as a pride anthem, with Kesha noting the song's lyrics were to be taken as \\"a celebration of any sort of quirks or eccentricities.\\" Promotion To promote the album, Kesha made several performances worldwide. Her first televised appearance was in Australia, where she performed \\"We R Who We R\\" for the time on the Australian X Factor on November 14, 2010. Following the performance, Kesha performed the song at the American Music Awards on November 21, 2010, in the United States. Kesha opened the performance with \\"Take It Off\\" before transitioning into \\"We R Who We R\\". \\"Blow\\" and \\"Animal\\" were performed live on May 22, 2011, at the Billboard Music Awards; the performance opened with \\"Animal\\" as Kesha sang suspended over the stage in a structure shaped like a diamond. Midway through the performance she dropped backwards into her crowd of background dancers then transitioned into \\"Blow\\". The performance featured glitter cannons and the dancers wore orange unicorn heads. The album received further promotion from her first headlining world concert tour, entitled the Get Sleazy Tour, which began on February 15, 2011, in Portland, Oregon. Singles Kesha performing second single \\"Blow\\" during the Get Sleazy Tour in 2011 \\"We R Who We R\\" was released as the EP's lead single on October 22, 2010. Kesha said she was affected by the recent teenage suicides, in particular the suicide of Tyler Clementi, a young man who committed suicide after being outed as gay by his roommate. She elaborated, \\"I was really affected [...] having been subject to very public hatred [myself]. I have absolutely no idea how these kids felt. What I'm going through is nothing compared to what they had to go through. Just know things do get better and you need to celebrate who you are.\\" With the release, Kesha stated that she hoped that the song would become an anthem for \\"weirdos\\", and said, \\"Every weird thing about you is beautiful and makes life interesting. Hopefully the song really captures that emotion of celebrating who you are.\\" \\"We R Who We R\\" debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, selling over 280,000 digital copies. With this feat, the song became the seventeenth song in the history of the chart to debut at number one. The song also reached number one in Australia, the United Kingdom and number two in Canada, while charting within the top ten in numerous other countries. \\"Blow\\" was released as the second single, and impacted U.S. radio on February 8, 2011. Critical reception of the song was generally mixed and positive. The song's hook and opening were generally praised but the song's chorus was met with mixed reaction, some critics praised the song for its party anthem vibe, while others called it uninspiring. Commercially, \\"Blow\\" reached the top ten in the United States and Australia, becoming her sixth straight top ten hit in both countries as a solo artist. The song also reached the top ten in New Zealand, and the top twenty in Canada. Other charted songs \\"Sleazy\\" was made available on November 2, 2010 as part of an iTunes exclusive countdown to the release of Cannibal. In Canada, the song entered the Canadian Hot 100 chart on the issue date entitled November 20, 2010 at forty-six. In the same week, \\"Sleazy\\" entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart at fifty-one. On the week of December 31, 2011, \\"Sleazy\\" re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 following the release of its official remix.

On the back of going viral on social network, TikTok, \\"Cannibal\\" re- entered the Canadian Hot 100 and climbed to a peak of 31 on the March 28, 2020 edition of the chart.https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9328390/kesha-cannibal- lyric-videohttps://www.billboard.com/music/kesha/chart-history/CAN/song/673691 The new found viral success also prompted Kesha to release a new lyric video for the song and her own dance collaboration with TikTok personality Charli D'Amelio.https://twitter.com/KeshaRose/status/1232682119954157568 Critical reception Cannibal received generally positive reviews from music critics upon its release. The album holds a score 73 out of 100 based on 11 critical reviews, according to the music review aggregator Metacritic. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic was positive in the review of Cannibal. Erlewine was somewhat critical of the choice to release the EP noting that the only real reason for the release was that Animal had been \\"squeezed dry of hits\\". Although critical of the re-release, Thomas's consensus of the album was positive, writing: \\"aided by the tight focus of an eight-track EP, Cannibal's brevity trumping the scattershot Animal—but what makes them stick is Kesha, a pop star lacking pop star looks and a pop star voice. She's all ravenous id, spitting at strangers and backstabbing friends, humiliating hotties, and laughing at the wreckage in her wake. She is who she is and she offers no apologies.\\" Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented on Kesha's writing of the album noting that her \\"herky-jerky rhymes still sound like they came from the bathroom wall of a reform-school kindergarten\\", not citing that as a negative but instead noting that the album had a \\"sulfurous end-of-days whiff about it\\". Greenblatt ended her review of the album giving it a rating of \\"B+\\" and called \\"Sleazy\\" and \\"Blow\\" the standout tracks on the album. Will Hermes from Rolling Stone noted that Kesha's main pop competitor was Lady Gaga writing, \\"This EP proves Kesha would kick Gaga's ass in a freestyle battle\\" praising her rhyming and production by Dr. Luke calling Kesha the \\"snap queen of clubland.\\" Chad Grischow from IGN met the album with a positive review, giving the album a score of 6.5 out of 10. Grischow was critical of the production of the album and overuse of Auto-Tune writing that there was \\"so much overdubbing and autotune used that most of the songs may as well be sung by a spunky robot\\". He also noted that when Kesha's vocals were stripped down she could actually sing, highlighting the ballads \\"The Harold Song\\" and \\"C U Next Tuesday\\" in the album's review. Grischow ended his review writing, \\"Cannibal proves to be too mired in mindless lyrics and excessive vocal effects to have any lasting appeal.\\" Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine met the album with a mixed to positive review. Cinquemani wrote that Kesha was able to pull off authentic and unapologetic lyrics with ease, noting that this was something her pop-peers could not do. A complaint on the review was that the album was too similar to Animal, noting that she failed to \\"branch out in any significant way\\" and the overuse of processed vocals. Cinquemani ended the review praising the \\"Animal (Billboard Remix)\\" for its \\"promise of something deeper, something beyond Dr. Luke's latest recycled formula.\\" Gary Graff from Billboard wrote \\"Kesha sinks her teeth into some fresh flavors on Cannibal, which will certainly enhance her 'Animal' attraction.\\" Spin magazine's Barry Walters reviewed Cannibal with a mixed outcome giving the album five out of a possible ten stars. Walters criticized the album as a whole stating that it was full of contradictions, noting that on \\"We R Who We R\\" \\"she sends out pride vibes to bullied gays,\\" while on \\"Grow a Pear\\", \\"she emasculates a potential boyfriend.\\" The production of the album was stated as a positive, praising Dr. Luke for his consistent club-pop hooks and ability to \\"render the hypocrisy [of the album] nearly irrelevant.\\" Mesfin Fekadu from The Boston Globe was mixed in his review of the album. Fekadu criticized the album's lyrical depth and use of auto-tune writing that the album was \\"filled with vapid lyrics and battles any T-Pain album for most use of the auto-tune.\\" Kesha's mother, Pebe, was also targeted in the review criticizing her for helping write the album's title track, \\"Cannibal\\" which was called \\"disturbing\\" and \\"sad\\". Commercial performance In the United States, Cannibal debuted on the Billboard 200 chart on the week of December 2, 2010 at number fifteen. The EP sold 74,000 copies in its first week of release. The following week the album dropped twenty-six positions to position forty-one selling an additional 26,200 copies. After being present on the chart for two months the album surpassed 250,000 copies in sales. In December 2018, the album received a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of 1,000,000 units. In Canada, Cannibal entered and peaked at number fourteen on the Canadian Albums Chart.

Retrieved 30 April 2013Connecticut Death Index, 1949-2001 was a violinist of Catalan origin who was playing concerts as a child before he studied at the Barcelona Conservatory. (The Castilian form of his name is Enrique, which he sometimes used on records.) Whilst still in his twenties he was lead violinist at Boston's and Symphony orchestras before becoming the conductor of the Cuban Philharmonic. In the late 1920s Madriguera played in Ben Selvin's studio orchestra at Columbia Records in New York, and served briefly as that company's director of Latin music recording. In 1932 he began his own orchestra at the Biltmore Hotel, which recorded for Columbia until 1934. His music at this period was mostly Anglo-American dance or foxtrot, frequently jazz-inflected, although he had a modest hit with his rhumba rendition of Carioca (1934). By the 1930s he was recording Latin American music almost exclusively. (His composition Adios became a national hit in 1931.) On his radio appearances, the band was billed as \\"Enric Madriguera and His Music of the Americas,\\" and Adios was its theme song. It was said that the ambassadors from all the South American countries declared Madriguera to be the \\"Ambassador of Music to all the Americas\\". Madriguera appeared in a number of \\"musical shorts\\" including \\"Enric Madriguera and his Orchestra\\" (1946) where he performed a number of songs including the orchestra for his vocalist-wife Patricia Gilmore. A review of one of his appearances recorded how he \\"reflected the warmth of our neighbors to the south\\". He died in retirement in Danbury, Connecticut.

It reflects Classical Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. Significance The building was one of many built pursuant to the authority of the Public Buildings Act of 1926. It was designed by a collaboration of architects: Edgar Love and Miller, Martin and Lewis. It is generally believed that Louis Simon, Supervising Architect of the Treasury, exerted a great deal of control over the design.General Services Administration page on the United States Courthouse and Post Office in Huntsville, Alabama. The building was constructed as a post office, courthouse and federal office building. When the Post Office moved out, many of the spaces, especially on the first floor and lobby area, were significantly altered. The building is one of only two in the central business district in the Neo-Classical Revival style. It was listed on the National Register as part of the Downtown Huntsville Multiple Resource Area. Architectural description The structure is a three-story Greek Revival–style building. The building has buff brick walls and is ornamented with a limestone water table and an entablature. The main (south) elevation is visually divided into three bays by a central limestone projecting temple form. The temple form consists of four limestone engaged pilasters with simple Tuscan caps supporting an unenriched entablature. The unenriched entablature continues completely around the building at the 3rd-floor level. The main entry door is in the center of the bay. The west elevation is simpler in detail. Visually it is also divided into three bays, with the center bay being defined by brick engaged pilasters carrying simple Tuscan caps. Both the north and east elevations are buff brick and ornamented with limestone. An unenriched limestone entablature spans the east elevation at the 3rd floor level and wraps around the east and west projecting wings at the north elevation. The north elevation continues to serve as the loading dock area at the 1st floor, though no longer for the postal service. At the 2nd- and 3rd-floor levels the east and west wings project and the recessed area forms a small, light court where the windows of the courtroom are revealed. The original east elevation is somewhat obscured by a buff brick addition at the 1st-floor level. The east elevation repeats the same ornamentation as the west, with the four brick-engaged pilasters with Tuscan caps supporting the unenriched entablature. However, due to the addition, only the tops of the pilasters are visible. It appears that the east elevation was originally identical to the west. The main, original courtroom is located in the center of the 2nd floor. A wood panel wainscot to 4-foot height encircles the room. The wainscot is ornamented with fluted columns at 2-foot intervals, thus the wainscot mirrors the fluted pilasters of the walls and matches the original courtroom furniture. The north and south walls are accented with fluted plaster engaged pilasters. The plaster crown mold is in the form of a band with blue rectangular fields highlighted with gold. Above each pilaster the blue rectangle is larger and contains a scroll design; between the pilasters the rectangles are smaller and have a sheaf design. Perhaps the most striking feature of the courtroom is the mural behind the rostrum. The mural, painted by artist Xavier Gonzales, is Belgian linen on canvas using zinc white, earth and cadmium colors. The setting is characteristic of the environment of Huntsville and includes five figures symbolizing different phases of society. The figures represent youth, scientific agriculture, work, artistic endeavors and motherhood. The mural was commissioned by the Section of Painting and Sculpture and was installed October 27, 1937. Of the 18 restrooms originally in the building, eight are still in nearly original condition. The original restrooms are the public restrooms off the 2nd- and 3rd-floor corridors; the private restroom in the 1st floor, southwest, Judge's Chambers (formerly the Post Master's office); the 2nd-floor Judge's Chambers private restroom; and the restrooms in the Jury and Petit Jury rooms of the 3rd floor. There is a large lobby, the former postal lobby, on the first floor and smaller lobbies on 2nd and 3rd floors. Functional public corridors still exist on the 2nd and 3rd floors; the original first floor corridor has been converted into the court tenant space. The tenant spaces are located on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd floors. On the 1st floor are the newly finished courtroom and another contemporary courtroom, the visiting Judge's Suite and the Clerk of Courts offices. The main courtroom is on the 2nd floor and the tenant space here is given over to a Judge's Suite and library on the west side, and the U.S. Marshall's office and detention cell on the east. The 3rd-floor tenant space at the outside of a single loaded U-shaped corridor contains jury rooms, and other related court offices. Typically, all the tenant spaces have been altered to some degree. The basement still serves primarily as the service, mechanical and storage area of the building, and there are also a few small offices here.

Among the notable championships the dancesport couple bagged are the Gold Medals for Latin 4-Dance and Latin 3-Dance in the 2008 International Millennium Open to the World Competition held in Singapore. Periquet began formal training in Latin Discipline under World and Philippine DanceSport champion Edna Ledesma in 2006, and World 10-Dance DanceSport champion Paul Harris from United Kingdom. Harris is best known as the choreographer of Harry Potter films. At the age of 3, Periquet began formal training in classical ballet under Totoy Oteyza and Inday Gaston Mañosa of Hariraya Dance Company. She also took classical ballet workshops in the US and in Geneva, Switzerland. At the age of 6, she began formal training in tap dance under Rose Borromeo of the Academy of the Performing Arts. Periquet is also technically trained in modern jazz, cheer dance and tap dance.

Anthony image and quoted text, used by Feminists for Life to portray her as \\"anti-choice\\". The quote deals with child custody in estate law rather than abortion. Susan B. Anthony was a leader of the American women's suffrage movement whose position on abortion has been the subject of a modern-day dispute. The dispute has primarily been between anti-abortion activists, who say that Anthony expressed opposition to abortion, and acknowledged authorities in her life and work who say that she did not. Since about 1989, some pro-life feminists have asserted that Anthony was anti-abortion and would support that side of the modern debate over the issue. A prominent supporter of this viewpoint has been Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, a political organization that seeks to end abortion through the electoral process. Others include Cat Clark and Rachel McNair of the Feminists for Life, a feminist and anti-abortion organization. Scholars, especially Ann Dexter Gordon, have disagreed strongly, saying that Anthony showed little interest in the issue of abortion and never expressed opposition to it. Gordon led the Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony Papers project, an academic undertaking to collect and document materials written by those two leaders of the women's rights movement, and she published a six-volume collection of their works. Others on this side of the dispute include Lynn Sherr, author of a biography of Anthony; Harper D. Ward, a researcher associated with the National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House; and Tracy Thomas, a law professor. The dispute largely revolves around statements that are alleged to have been made by Anthony in opposition to abortion. Scholars say these statements either were not made by Anthony, are not about abortion or have been taken out of context. Background Susan B. Anthony and her signature Susan B. Anthony (1820–1906) is known primarily for her leadership in the women's suffrage movement, a cause to which she devoted most of her life. The Nineteenth Amendment, which guarantees the right of women to vote, has been called the Susan B. Anthony Amendment because of her efforts to achieve its passage. She was raised by abolitionist Quaker parents, later attending Unitarian churches and becoming an agnostic. As a young woman she also worked in the temperance movement and as a speaker and organizer for the American Anti-Slavery Society. In 1979 she was honored as the first American woman to be represented on U.S. currency, the Susan B. Anthony dollar. In 1982, the Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony Papers project was initiated at Rutgers University to collect and document all available materials written by Anthony and her co-worker Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Under the leadership of Ann D. Gordon, it gathered some 14,000 documents, more than doubling the sources that previously had been available. Gordon said she noticed in 1989 that some anti-abortion organizations were stating that Susan B. Anthony opposed abortion. Rosemary Bottcher, an anti-abortion activist with Feminists for Life (FFL), wrote in June 1989, \\"The early feminists believed that by enhancing the status of women, they could greatly reduce the incidence of abortion. Susan B. Anthony wrote that 'We must reach the root of the evil...' \\" Two months later, Rachel MacNair, the president of FFL, was quoted saying, \\"Susan B. Anthony didn't think there was a contradiction\\" in the idea of being a feminist who is against abortion rights. FFL, a feminist anti- abortion organization that was founded in the early 1970s, said in its mission statement that it, \\"continues the tradition of early American feminists such as Susan B. Anthony, who opposed abortion.\\" The Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List), which was founded by MacNair in 1992 as a political group with the goal of ending abortion in the United States by supporting pro-life politicians, especially women, described Anthony as \\"an outspoken critic of abortion.\\" Some conservative anti-abortion organizations, such as Concerned Women for America, have made similar statements. Gordon said the belief that Anthony opposed abortion was \\"far-fetched\\", describing it as \\"what historians call an 'invented memory' — history without foundation in the evidence but with modern utility.\\" She and others began to challenge this idea in public forums such as the Washington Post. Anti-abortion leaders such as Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the SBA List, used that newspaper and other forums to support their side of this issue. Arguments A 2006 article by Allison Stevens for Women's eNews said \\"a scholarly disagreement ...is growing into a heated skirmish over the famous suffragist's position on reproductive rights.\\" Stevens said pro-choice activists were \\"outraged over what they say is an unproven claim and concerned that their heroine is being appropriated by a community led by the very people Anthony battled during her lifetime: social conservatives.\\" A week after the Stevens article appeared, author and columnist Stacy Schiff wrote, \\"There is no question that [Anthony] deplored the practice of abortion, as did every one of her colleagues in the suffrage movement\\", but Schiff criticized the practice of using \\"history plucked from both text and time\\" to create \\"Anthony the pro-lifer\\". Schiff said that abortion in the 19th century, unlike today, was a very dangerous and unpredictable procedure. Abortion was more dangerous than childbirth throughout the 19th century. By 1930, medical procedures had improved for both childbirth and abortion but not equally, and induced abortion in the first trimester had become safer than childbirth. In 1973, Roe vs. Wade acknowledged that abortion in the first trimester was safer than childbirth. She concluded, \\"The bottom line is that we cannot possibly know what Anthony would make of today's debate\\" over the abortion issue, because \\"the terms do not translate\\". Gordon and others strongly disagreed with the idea that Anthony opposed abortion. Gordon, who published a six-volume collection of the works of Susan B. Anthony and her co-worker Elizabeth Cady Stanton, wrote that Anthony \\"never voiced an opinion about the sanctity of fetal life ... and she never voiced an opinion about using the power of the state to require that pregnancies be brought to term.\\" Gordon said that, for Anthony, the issue of abortion was \\"a political hot potato\\", one to avoid; it distracted from her main goal of gaining women the vote. Gordon said the suffrage movement in the 19th century held political and social views—\\"secularism, the separation of church and state, and women's self-ownership\\" (women's autonomy)—that do not fit with modern pro-life concerns. In 1999, Ken Burns released a film about the lives of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton called Not for Ourselves Alone. The SBA List objected in a press release to Burns' portrayal of these two women, saying that \\"to document Anthony's and Stanton's important work for women's rights without mentioning their abhorrence of abortion is incredibly unjust, considering how passionate they were on the subject.\\" Gordon responded, \\"It is reasonable to ask, if these nineteenth-century women were passionate and outspoken in their abhorrence of abortion, why did they never do anything about it?\\" Christine Stansell, a professor of history at the University of Chicago and author of a book on the history of feminism, said, \\"neither Anthony nor any other nineteenth-century women’s rights reformer led an anti-abortion movement, proposed or supported laws to criminalize abortion, or saw abortion as a political problem.\\" Gloria Feldt, a former head of Planned Parenthood, said of Anthony that \\"there's absolutely nothing in anything that she ever said or did that would indicate she was anti-abortion.\\" In early 2007, Cat Clark, an editor of FFL's quarterly magazine, acknowledged that Anthony spent little time on the subject of abortion, but cited FFL researcher Mary Krane Derr who said Anthony's \\"stance on abortion\\" was integral to \\"her commitment to undo gender oppression\\". Law professor Tracy Thomas, writing in the Seattle University Law Review, said the \\"strategy of creating a narrative of feminist history against abortion\\"Thomas, Tracy A. (2012). \\"Misappropriating Women's History in the Law and Politics of Abortion\\", Seattle University Law Review, Vol. 36, No. 1 was developed by Feminists for Life in the early 1990s. Thomas published a lengthy analysis of what she considered to be inaccuracies in that narrative, saying, \\"... the narrative is simply not true. Sound bites that have been excised from history are taken out of context to convey a meaning not originally intended.\\" She quoted Annette Ravinsky, a former vice president of the FFL, as saying in published comments, \\"I really wish my former colleagues would stop twisting the words of dead people to make them mean something they don't ... The early leaders of the women's movement were not against women controlling their bodies.\\" Quoted in Thomas, p. 14 In May 2010, Sarah Palin addressed a meeting of the SBA List, saying Anthony was one of her heroes, and that Palin's own opposition to abortion rights was influenced by her \\"feminist foremothers\\". She said \\"Organizations like the Susan B. Anthony List are returning the woman's movement back to its original roots, back to what it was all about in the beginning. You remind us of the earliest leaders of the woman's rights movement: They were pro-life.\\" In response to this, journalist Lynn Sherr, author of Failure is Impossible: Susan B. Anthony in Her Own Words, joined with Gordon to write an opinion piece for The Washington Post. They said: \\"We have read every single word that this very voluble—and endlessly political—woman left behind. Our conclusion: Anthony spent no time on the politics of abortion. It was of no interest to her, despite living in a society (and a family) where women aborted unwanted pregnancies.\\" Sherr and Gordon said that their argument \\"is not over abortion rights. Rather it is about the erosion of accuracy in history and journalism.\\" Women's rights activists Elizabeth Cady Stanton (seated) and Susan B. Anthony SBA List president Marjorie Dannenfelser published her response to Sherr and Gordon, saying that their conclusion \\"that abortion was nowhere on [Anthony's] radar\\" was \\"unfounded on many levels\\". She said that in Anthony's day, \\"abortion wasn't even a hot political issue ...Abortion simply wasn't up for debate at a time when society itself was firmly against the practice.\\" Thomas disputed Dannenfelser's assertion that abortion was not a political issue during that period, and she disputed the idea that society firmly opposed abortion. Thomas cited three academic histories, including a history of abortion by James Mohr, who discussed what he called the doctrine of quickening, the belief that it was legally and morally permissible to terminate pregnancy prior to the perception of fetal movement. Mohr said this belief was almost universal during the first decades of the 1800sMohr, James C. Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy, p. 5. Oxford University Press, 1978. . and was pervasive through the 1870s.Mohr (1979), p. 73 As a result, he said, \\"women believed themselves to be carrying inert non-beings prior to quickening\\",Mohr (1979), p. 6 and if a woman missed her period, an early sign of pregnancy, either she or her doctor could take steps to \\"restore menstrual flow\\".Mohr (1979), p. 4 Mohr said there was a surge in abortions after 1840 and that a study of abortion in New York City published in 1868 concluded that there was approximately one abortion there for every four live births.Mohr (1979), pp. 75, 78–79. Dannenfelser said that while the pro-life cause was not \\"the issue that earned Susan B. Anthony her stripes in American history books, historians would be wrong to conclude that Anthony was agnostic on the issue of abortion.\\" She quoted Anthony's business partner, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, as saying, \\"When we consider that women are treated as property, it is degrading to women that we should treat our children as property to be disposed of as we see fit.\\" Attempts to authenticate this quote, however, have been unsuccessful. After Thomas notified the FFL in 2011 that she could not locate the source for this alleged quote, the FFL acknowledged the problem by saying that, \\"Earlier generations of pro-life feminists informed us that these words were written by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, in a letter tucked into Julia Ward Howe's diary on October 16, 1873,\\" but that they could not locate the letter. The FFL said that Howe's diary entry for that date indicated that she had argued about infanticide with Stanton, who, according to Howe, \\"excused infanticide on the grounds that women did not want to bring moral monsters into the world, and said that these acts were regulated by natural law. I differed from her strongly\\". Thomas added that the disagreement occurred during public discussion at a women's conference in New York City. Thomas said it is a mistake to believe that the views of Anthony and Stanton are compatible with those of the modern anti-abortion movement. She called attention to the case of Hester Vaughn, who was sentenced to hang for killing her newborn child in 1868. An editorial in The Revolution, a newspaper owned by Anthony and co-edited by Stanton, described Vaughn as a \\"poor, ignorant, friendless and forlorn girl who had killed her newborn child because she knew not what else to do with it\\" and said that Vaughn's execution would be \\"a far more horrible infanticide than was the killing of her child.\\"\\"Infanticide\\", The Revolution, August 6, 1868, p. 74 The Revolution launched a campaign in Vaughn's defense, which was conducted largely by the Working Women's Association (WWA), an organization formed in the offices of The Revolution with Anthony's participation.DuBois, Ellen Carol (1978). Feminism and Suffrage: The Emergence of an Independent Women's Movement in America, 1848-1869, pp. 125, 133, 145. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press. . The National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House, located in Anthony's former home in Rochester, New York, expressed concern about the association of Anthony's name with what it considered to be misleading political campaign material produced by the Susan B. Anthony List. In a press release the museum said, \\"The List's assertions about Susan B. Anthony's position on abortion are historically inaccurate.\\" Deborah Hughes, president of the museum, said, \\"People are outraged by their actions, causing harm to Anthony's name and the mission of our Museum.\\" Harper D. Ward, in a research article published by the Susan B. Anthony Museum and House, said, \\"Anthony's long career of public speaking provided many occasions for her to speak about abortion if she chose to do so. The plain fact, however, is that Susan B. Anthony almost never referred to abortion, and when she did, she said nothing to indicate that she wanted it banned by law.\\" Harper D. Ward is identified within the article as \\"the pen name of an independent historical researcher.\\" Quotes Anthony wrote very little about abortion. The few existing quotes that are cited by pro-life organizations have been disputed by Anthony scholars and other commentators who say the quotes are misleading, taken out of context, or misattributed. =\\"Guilty?\\"= Some pro-life groups cite as Anthony's own words an anonymous essay entitled \\"Marriage and Maternity\\" published in 1869 in The Revolution, a newspaper owned for two years by Anthony and edited by fellow women's rights activists Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Parker Pillsbury. The essay is against abortion and the societal problems which cause it, but the author believes any proposed law prohibiting abortion would fail to \\"reach the root of the evil, and destroy it.\\" The cited text includes this admonition against abortion: The piece was signed simply \\"A.\\" Because it was published in The Revolution, Dannenfelser wrote that \\"most logical people would agree, then, that writings signed by 'A.' in a paper that Anthony funded and published were a reflection of her own opinions.\\" Gordon, whose project at Rutgers has examined 14,000 documents related to Stanton and Anthony, said, \\"Susan B. Anthony has become their unwitting antiabortion poster child based largely on an article she did not write ... For the occasional articles Anthony wrote, she signed 'S.B.A.,' just as she signed the postscripts in her vast correspondence. 'Marriage and Maternity' is signed only 'A,' a shorthand Anthony never used.\\" Derr said Anthony was known to sign \\"S.B.A.\\" and was affectionately referred to as \\"Miss A.\\" by others. In support of her opinion that Anthony wrote this article, Dannenfelser said, \\"Anthony published many articles under a simple pseudonym, 'A.'\\" in The Revolution. Ward disputed this, saying, \\"That statement is completely false. There are only eight items in The Revolution that were signed that way, and none of them can reasonably be attributed to Anthony.\\" Ward listed issue and page numbers for over sixty items in The Revolution that were signed \\"S.B.A.\\" or \\"Susan B. Anthony\\" and provided links to scans of articles by \\"A.\\" Ward said that one of the articles by \\"A.\\" disagreed with an editorial in The Revolution, and, in a later issue, the editors addressed its author as \\"Mr. A.\\", making it clear that this \\"A.\\" was not Susan B. Anthony. Ward analyzed the other seven articles by \\"A.\\" and concluded that in all cases their contents do not match Anthony's known beliefs or interests, including two that deal with a technical point of machinery and one that challenged the competence of the U.S. Patent Office. Ward said the fact that the article by \\"A.\\" that disapproves of abortion \\"includes fervently religious language ('... thunder in her ear, \\"Whoso defileth the body defileth the temple of the Holy Ghost!\\"')\\" is a sure sign that it was not written by Anthony, who avoided such religiosity.\\" Ward cited Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Anthony's close friend, who described Anthony as an agnostic. Saying that The Revolution \\"published a large number of articles that were contributed by its readers on a variety of topics, many of whom signed themselves anonymously, often with a single initial,\\" Ward listed a sampling of articles that were signed with single letters in addition to \\"A\\", such as \\"The Working Women's Convention\\" by \\"B\\", \\"Woman as Soldier\\" by \\"C\\", and so on through much of the alphabet. Responding to the equating of Anthony's beliefs with those voiced in The Revolution, Gordon said that people \\"have a hard time wrapping their minds around the fact that The Revolution was a paper of debate—presenting both sides of an issue.\\" Ward emphasized this point by quoting The Revolution's editorial policy on this matter: \\"[T]hose who write for our columns are responsible only for what appears under their own names. Hence if old Abolitionists and Slaveholders, Republicans and Democrats, Presbyterians and Universalists, Saints, Sinners and the Beecher family find themselves side by side in writing up the question of Woman Suffrage, they must pardon each other's differences on all other points.\\"\\"Prospectus of The Revolution for 1870,\\" The Revolution, November 18, 1869, pp. 315-316 Referring to the \\"Marriage and Maternity\\" article, which identifies uncaring husbands as the \\"thrice guilty\\" party, Schiff says \\"what is generally not mentioned [by pro-life organizations] is that the essay argues against an anti-abortion law; its author did not believe legislation would resolve the issue of unwanted pregnancy.\\" Gordon, referring to the article's many scriptural quotes and appeals to God, says that its style does not fit with Anthony's \\"known beliefs\\". Speaking for the FFL, Clark said, \\"Feminists for Life is cautious about the attribution of 'Marriage & Maternity.' In FFL materials, it is simply said to have appeared in Susan B. Anthony's publication, The Revolution.\\" =\\"Sweeter even\\"= Frances Willard, president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, gave a speech on October 4, 1888, in which she described a conversation that included Anthony's reaction to a \\"leading publicist\\" who asked her why she, with such a generous heart, had never been a wife or mother. Willard said that Anthony replied \\"after this fashion\\": These words have been presented by both the SBA List and FFL to indicate Anthony's stance on abortion. Dannenfelser of the SBA List connected these words to abortion in 2010: \\"in case there's still lingering doubt about where Susan B. Anthony's convictions lie, her words to Frances Willard in 1889 speak for themselves\\". Tracy Clark-Flory disagreed, writing on Salon.com that they constitute \\"a statement that can conveniently be taken to mean any number of things.\\" Pro-life feminist Derr contextualized Anthony's words not to abortion but to Anthony's opposition to a law which held that, if a child was unborn at the time of its father's death, custody of the newborn infant could be taken away from the mother if there was a guardian appointed in the father's will. Ward similarly said that Anthony was referring not to abortion here but to laws that enabled the father to \\"will away\\" the children of the family to someone other than their mother after his death. Ward supported this with a quote from Matilda Joslyn Gage, one of Anthony's co- workers, who criticized existing laws by which, \\"the father is assumed to be the sole owner of the children, who can be bound out, willed or given away without the consent or even the knowledge of the mother.\\"Matilda Joslyn Gage, Woman, Church and State, Charles H. Kerr, Chicago, 1893, p. 329 Ward said that in any case these words cannot be characterized as a quote because Willard made it clear that she was not attempting to reproduce exactly what Anthony had said. Ward said that Willard's reconstruction of the conversation is unrealistic because Willard, \\"has Anthony speaking in a sentimental and ingratiating way that is completely unlike the way she actually spoke.\\" After these words were published by Derr in a 1995 book and in FFL's own journal in 1998, they were used in 2000 by FFL in a promotional poster, one of eight produced for college campuses, alongside an assertion that Anthony was \\"another anti-choice fanatic\\", leading the reader to an abortion-related interpretation of them. =Social Purity= Susan B. Anthony \\"Social Purity\\" was the name of an anti-alcohol and pro-suffrage speech given repeatedly by Anthony in the 1870s. After naming alcohol abuse as a major social evil and estimating that there were 600,000 American men who were drunkards, Anthony said that the liquor traffic must be fought with \\"one earnest, energetic, persistent force.\\" She continued with a sentence that mentioned abortion: Later in the speech, Anthony mentioned abortion again: Clark described this speech as one in which Anthony was \\"more explicit\\" about abortion. She said that \\"this speech clearly represents abortion as a symptom of the problems faced by women, especially when subjected 'to the tyranny of men's appetites and passions. Ward said this speech cannot reasonably be interpreted as an indication that Anthony opposed abortion, saying, \\"Listing abortion as one of the consequences of alcohol abuse is not the same as calling for it to be outlawed.\\" Ward said that Anthony also included divorce in that list of consequences and yet later in the speech \\"spoke caustically of those who opposed it, saying, 'We have had quite enough of the sickly sentimentalism which counts the woman a heroine and a saint for remaining the wife of a drunken, immoral husband. =\\"She will rue the day\\"= According to Gordon and Sherr, the only clear reference to abortion in writings known to be Anthony's came in her diary in a passage that was discovered by Gordon. Anthony wrote in 1876 that she visited her brother and learned that her sister-in-law had aborted her pregnancy. \\"Things did not go well\\", say Gordon and Sherr, and her sister-in-law was bedridden. Anthony wrote, \\"Sister Annie in bed — been sick for a month — tampering with herself — & was freed this A.M. what ignorance & lack of self-government the world is filled with.\\"Gordon, Ann D., ed. (2003). The Selected Papers of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony: National Protection for National Citizens, 1873 to 1880, Vol. 3 of 6, p. 213. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press. . Three days later, Anthony wrote, \\"Sister Annie better — but looks very slim — she will rue the day she forces nature\\".Gordon (2003), p. 214 According to Gordon, the phrase \\"tampering with herself\\" refers to \\"inducing an abortion.\\" Gordon and Sherr wrote, \\"Clearly Anthony did not applaud her sister-in-law's action, but the notation is ambiguous. Is it the act of abortion that will be regretted? Or is it being bedridden, the risk taken with one's own life?\\" Moreover, Gordon and Sherr wrote, there is no indication in the quote that Anthony considered abortion a social or political issue rather than a personal one, that she passionately hated it, or that she was active against it. Ward, noting that women who induced their own abortions did so with primitive and dangerous techniques, said this passage, \\"in no way indicates that Anthony was in favor of laws to prohibit medical professionals from providing abortions.\\" =\\"Active Antagonism\\"= In 2016 Dannenfelser wrote an article called \\"'Active Antagonism' on International Women's Day\\" that was published in The Hill, a political newspaper and website. In it, she wrote, \\"Susan B. Anthony, the founding mother of the movement for women's rights, said that abortion filled her with 'indignation, and awakened active antagonism.'\\" Calling this another instance in which \\"Dannenfelser has disregarded the facts\\", Ward responded by saying, \\"Anthony said nothing of the sort. Elizabeth Blackwell wrote those words, which appear on page 30 of her memoirs.\\" Elizabeth Blackwell was the first woman to receive a medical degree in the United States. On page 30 of her memoirs, Blackwell said, \\"The gross perversion and destruction of motherhood by the abortionist filled me with indignation, and awakened active antagonism.\\"Blackwell, Elizabeth (1895). Pioneer Work in Opening the Medical Profession to Women p. 30 Susan B. Anthony Birthplace Museum In August 2006, Carol Crossed, a pro-life feminist and advisory board member of the SBA List, purchased the house in Adams, Massachusetts, where Anthony was born. The house was to be managed by Feminists for Life of America. Crossed transformed the house into the Susan B. Anthony Birthplace Museum, which opened in 2010. The museum's mission includes \\"raising public awareness\\" of Anthony's \\"wide-ranging legacy\\" including her being \\"a pioneering feminist and suffragist as well as a noteworthy figure in the abolitionist, pro-life and temperance movements of the 19th century\\" (emphasis added.) A local newspaper said the \\"she will rue the day\\" quote is displayed in the museum, though none of the others are. Among the exhibits is one on 19th century activism against Restellism, a euphemism for abortion, in reference to Madame Restell, one of many who sold abortifacients in the 19th century. Anthony's newspaper, The Revolution, refused to publish advertisements for abortifacients. According to the local reporter, the display implies that the rejection of advertisements frames Anthony's personal views about abortion, though she \\"never specifically states her position.\\" At its opening, the museum was leafleted by protesters who said the museum's leadership was \\"inferring upon [Anthony] an unproven historical stance.\\" The protesters said that the directors were using the museum to put forward a pro- life agenda. Crossed responded by saying, \\"the pro-life views expressed in Anthony's newspaper, The Revolution, will not be excluded from the exhibition. This vision represented a very small part of Anthony's life, and while it will be presented, it will not be an overwhelming theme of the birthplace. Anthony's own anti-abortion stance is mentioned in just one of the museum's ten exhibits.\\" In popular culture On January 14, 2017, Saturday Night Live broadcast a skit in which Susan B. Anthony, portrayed by Kate McKinnon, says \\"Abortion is murder!\\" On February 15, 2018, the White House issued a Susan B. Anthony Day proclamation, claiming that she was anti-abortion.

The history of the Kilmore carols can be traced from the mid eighteenth century to the present day. They have been sung without a break since they were introduced to the parish by Very Rev. Peter Devereux, who was Parish Priest circa 1751. Some of them were written by Very Rev. William Devereux, P.P., Piercestown, a native of Tacumshane, where he is buried. The remainder were written by Bishop Luke Waddinge of Ferns. In all, there are thirteen carols, eight of which are usually sung during the Christmas period, the first at first Mass on Christmas Day and the last one on Sunday nearest Twelfth Day. The singers consist of six local men and have always included a member of the Devereux family, a tradition that is being continued to the present day.

It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. In 2020 it was included as a contributing property in the Davenport Downtown Commercial Historic District. History The idea behind the City Market was to bring the city's merchants and their goods together in a single location. However, the merchants had to vacate their individual stores in order to occupy a stall in the City Market. To that end the city hired Thomas W. McClelland to build the public market on Fifth Street in 1872. The facility was damaged in a fire in 1873, and some of the walls still show burn marks. The market idea, however, did not last long because there was little interest from merchants. with The west end of the building, whose address is 130 West Fifth Street, became the police station in 1877. By 1886 the east end of the building, 120 W. Fifth Street, was occupied by the Armory Co. B. The Armory moved out by 1892 and that section of the building became the Bridewell House of Detention. When the Scott County Jail opened in 1898 this facility became a women's jail. It was overseen by a police matron and was used to register prostitutes for vice taxation. By 1920 the address, 120 W. Fifth (or 122 W. Fifth Street as it was sometimes listed), was no longer being used. It could be that the east section of the building was torn down at this time. At any rate, the east section no longer exists. Starting in 1925 the police department and the city's ambulance service started sharing the building starting in 1925. Bridewell House of Detention and Patrol Station No. 1 remained until about 1940 and the ambulance service left sometime in the 1940s. The city's Parking Division was also headquartered here. The building was vacant for a number of years. In 2008, Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Mississippi Valley moved into the building. They raised $650,000 to renovate the building and teamed with the Tri-City Building Trades Council who used the renovation as an educational project. Architecture The City Market is a single-story, brick building constructed on a stone foundation. The structure is rectangular in shape and is topped by a gable roof, which faces Main Street. It contains a mixture of Romanesque Revival and Greek Revival elements. The Romanesque may be found in the rounded arches and decorative brickwork on the façade fronting Main Street. It also features brick pilasters and a stepped frieze that organizes the facade into three bays. The north and south elevations are more functional and less decorative. Both elevations contain windows, garage doors, and a pedestrian entrance. Window openings feature segmentally arched headers, stone sills, and double-hung windows with 6/6 light configurations. The pedestrian entrances are similar in form, while the garage doors have flat span lintels, with glass transoms above the door. As mentioned above, the eastern end of the original building has been removed. The corbiestep parapet wall of the roofline and ghost marks indicate the existence of the former space.

Biography = Early years  Sebastián Kindelán was born on 30 December 1757 in Ceuta, Spain. He was the son of Vicente Kindelán Luttrell of Luttrellstown and María Francisca O’Regan. His father was an Irishman who settled in Spain and joined the infantry of the Royal Spanish Army, attaining the positions of Brigadier and military governor of Zamora. His mother came from Barcelona but she probably was of Irish descent. He had a brother, Juan de Kindelán y O’Regan, and a sister, María de la Concepcion Kindelán y O’Regan. Kindelán joined the Spanish Army as a cadet on November 18, 1768. During this time he was a soldier of the infantry regiment of Santiago de Cuba.  Political career  Kindelán assumed the governorship of Santiago de Cuba and all the eastern territory of Cuba on March 28, 1799 during a politically sensitive period of the island's history. In a missive dated February 19, 1804, some of its influential citizens reported to the Spanish Crown the dangerous situation of the island, asserting that Governor Kindelán had encouraged white refugees from the uprisings in Saint-Domingue to settle in Cuba after the French withdrew from the western portion of Hispaniola. They complained that some twenty thousand or more French immigrants had already acquired land in Cuba, and were importing black slaves to work their plantations. The letter accused the governor of irreligion and dishonesty, and condemned him for having licentious habits and setting a bad example for the people. Kindelán rebutted the denunciations vigorously, and defended the French settlers, saying they were peaceful, and had no intention of inciting a revolution such as had occurred in Santo Domingo (Saint- Domingue). In a letter to the authorities in Spain dated 17 May 1804, Kindelán made note of recent attacks on the British colonies by privateers based in Cuba. He later requested a reassignment, and was transferred to East Florida on September 22, 1811. He was promoted to Brigadier of Infantry in December of that year. On 11 June 1812, Kindelán was officially named Royal Governor of Spanish East Florida, being named by the Cádiz Regency. In 1812 rebel groups of Georgians tried to seize Florida, wanting it to be part of the United States. The Seminoles and their black tribal members, some of them enslaved, came to the aid of Spain. Governor Kindelán sent certain leaders of his black militiamen to meet with the Seminole chiefs King Payne and his successor Bowlegs, who allowed some of their warriors to fight alongside the Spanish as a gesture of goodwill. Kindelán expressed his satisfaction when Bowlegs took two hundred of his men to join the Spanish at the St. Johns River, but complained that every time the Seminoles captured a slave, a horse or anything else of value, they left the field to try to secure the catch in their villages, so their utility as fighters was only temporary. Like his predecessors, Gov. Kindelán used black translators, including the free mulatto militiaman, Benjamin Wiggins, and the slave Tony Doctor (Antonio Proctor), whom he described as \\"known to be the best interpreter of Indian languages in the province\\", to promote a Spanish, Black, and Indian alliance. In July 1812, Proctor traveled to the Seminole town of Alachua to meet with the chief King Payne, who called upon several hundred of his warriors to assist the Spanish. Kindelán left the position of Governor of East Florida on 3 June 1815,U.S. States F-K. when he was appointed Attaché to the General Staff of Cuba, but on August 12 that same year he was given the rank of Lieutenant in Havana. Three years later, in 1818, he was elected acting governor of the Second Spanish Colony of Santo Domingo. As governor, he was faced with the problem of the Haitians who wanted to take over that part of the island of Hispaniola. On September 12, 1819, Kindelán was awarded the Grand Cross of San Fernando, third class, for his efforts in Florida in 1813 to stop the American attacks in the colony; he was also a Knight of the Order of Santiago. Kindelán was replaced by Brigadier Pascual Real as colonial governor of Santo Domingo in 1821, prior to the short-lived independence of that colony won by José Núñez de Cáceres and his group. In 1822, as Cabo Subalterno, he was appointed Provisional Captain-General (or Governor) of Cuba to replace former Gov. Nicolás Mahy y Romo. Like his predecessor, Kindelán strove to unite the military and civil power in the office of the Captain-General; this effort aroused antagonism between the Spanish troops and the local militia. Between 1824 and 1826 he served as Field marshal (Mariscal de Campo) of the royal army, and died in Santiago de Cuba on 4 May 1826, with that rank.  Personal life  Kindelán married Ana Manuela Mozo de la Torre Garvey in the Cathedral of Santiago de Cuba on 11 December 1801. The couple had six children: Juan (born in Santiago de Cuba on September 8, 1806), Bárbara, Vicente (1808–1877), Fernando (1808–1889), María (1810–1879) and Mariana (1810–1880).

History A white paper was tabled in the Parliament of Canada on 26 March 1964 by the Minister of National Defence, Paul Hellyer, and the Associate Minister of National Defence, Lucien Cardin. This document outlined a major restructuring of the three separate armed services, describing a reorganization that would include the integration of operations, logistics support, personnel, and administration of the separate branches under a functional command system. The proposal met with strong opposition from personnel in all three services, and resulted in the dismissal of the navy's senior operational commander, Rear Admiral William Landymore, as well as the forced retirements of other senior officers in the nation's military forces. The protests of service personnel and their superiors had no effect, however, and on 1 February 1968, Bill C-243, The Canadian Forces Reorganization Act, was granted Royal Assent, and the Royal Canadian Navy, the Canadian Army, and the Royal Canadian Air Force were combined into one service: the Canadian Armed Forces. The public explanation for the reorganization was that unification would achieve cost savings and provide improved command, control, and integration of the military forces. Hellyer stated on 4 November 1966 that \\"the amalgamation... will provide the flexibility to enable Canada to meet in the most effective manner the military requirements of the future. It will also establish Canada as an unquestionable leader in the field of military organization.\\" However, the serving Liberal ministers of the Crown were accused of not caring for the traditions behind each individual service, especially as the long-standing navy, army, and air force identities were replaced with common army-style ranks and rifle green uniforms. Rather than loyalty to each service, which, as military historian Jack Granatstein put it, was \\"vital for sailors, soldiers, and airmen and women\\" who \\"risk their lives to serve,\\" Hellyer wanted loyalty to the new, all-encompassing Canadian Armed Forces (CAF); this, it was said, caused damage to the esprit de corps for sailors, soldiers, air crew and other personnel. As part of unification, the Royal Canadian Navy, the Canadian Army and the Royal Canadian Air Force were merged and lost their status as separate legal entities. Most of the commands of the former services were eliminated and new unified commands were created. Army personnel and equipment were placed under an entity known as Mobile Command (later renamed Land Force Command). Navy personnel and ships were placed under Maritime Command. Personnel and aircraft of the former Royal Canadian Air Force were divided between Mobile Command, Maritime Command, Air Defence Command, Air Transport Command, and Training Command. In 1975 all aircraft of the Canadian Armed Forces were placed under a new command known as Air Command. Most of the pre-unification corps that had been created in the early 20th century were disbanded or were merged with counterparts in the navy and air force to form the personnel branches of the CF. *The Canadian Forces Medical Service (which had been formed as a joint professional organization in 1959 by the functional integration of the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps, RCN medical branch and RCAF medical branch) became a personnel branch of the new Canadian Forces in 1969, as did the Canadian Forces Dental Service; in the 1990s, both the CFMS and CFDS would combine together administratively as the Canadian Forces Health Services (remaining distinct personnel branches within the greater CFHS). In October 2013 the Medical Branch was renamed the Royal Canadian Medical Service and the Dental Branch was restored to its previous name of Royal Canadian Dental Corps. *Royal Canadian Engineers - became the Canadian Military Engineer Branch, encompassing the five functions of engineering across the three former services: combat engineers from the Army, air field engineers and firefighters from the RCAF, construction engineers from all three services, and mappers and surveyors from Army Survey Establishment. *Royal Canadian Corps of Signals — became the Communications and Electronics Branch *Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps amalgamated with supply and transport services of Royal Canadian Army Service Corps —became the Logistics Branch *Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers — became Land Ordnance Engineering, then Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Branch *Clerical trades of Royal Canadian Army Service Corps, Royal Canadian Army Pay Corps, and Royal Canadian Postal Corps —became the Administration Branch (later merged with the Logistics Branch) *Canadian Provost Corps and Canadian Intelligence Corps — became the Security Branch The move toward unification, as well as other budget and cost-cutting moves during the 1980s and 1990s were opposed by many and is sometimes seen as a fault in the Canadian Forces. Many veterans objected to unification and sometimes referred to branches of the military by their pre-unification titles. In 2013 the traditional designation of \\"Royal\\" was restored to several of the branches listed above. Further changes Over the ensuing decades, restructuring continued, with Communication Command established on 1 September 1970, and Air Defence Command and Air Transport Command disbanded and their assets transferred to a new Air Command on 2 September 1975. The Government of Brian Mulroney (1984-93) took steps which restored more traditional and distinct army, navy and air force uniforms to the Canadian Armed Forces, though the unified structure of the Armed Forces was maintained. For more than thirty years during the Cold War, the CF also maintained two bases in West Germany, under the command of Canadian Forces Europe. These bases were closed in the early 1990s, and Canadian Forces Europe disbanded, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the reunification of Germany. Materiel Command was disbanded during the 1980s, and Communications Command was disbanded during a mid-1990s reorganization, with its units merged into the Defence Information Services Organization (DISO), later renamed Information Management Group (IM Gp). Mobile Command was also renamed at this time, becoming Land Force Command (LFC). On 1 February 2006, the CF added four operational commands to the existing structure: Canada Command (CANCOM), Canadian Expeditionary Force Command (CEFCOM), Canadian Special Operations Forces Command (CANSOFCOM), and Canadian Operational Support Command (CANOSCOM). In 2012 CANCOM, CEFCOM and CANOSCOM were merged into Canadian Joint Operations Command. Name restorations On 16 August 2011 the three environmental commands of the Canadian Armed Forces were renamed to reflect the names of the original historical armed services. Air Command was changed to the Royal Canadian Air Force; Maritime Command was changed to the Royal Canadian Navy; and Land Force Command was changed to the Canadian Army. The government made the changes to align Canada with other key Commonwealth countries whose militaries use the royal designation, and to indicate that it respected Canada's military heritage. The unified command structure of the Canadian Armed Forces was not altered by this change. Unlike the situation prior to 1968 where the services existed as separate legal entities, the current Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force have no separate legal status and, under terms of amendments made to the National Defence Act in 2014, exist as commands within the unified Canadian Armed Forces. Officers' insignia was also changed during this period of name restorations, to match the distinctive insignia worn by the three branches of the pre-unification era. The navy added the executive curl to their gold bars, the army abandoned the CF-style bars for pips and crown insignia, and the air force changed their gold bar insignia to a shade of pearl grey worn before unification.

It is found on the bottom, typically at a depth of . Reaching in length, this species has a thin, nearly circular pectoral fin disc without visible eyes, and a short tail with a single dorsal fin. Its pelvic fins are divided in two, with the anterior portion forming a limb-like appendage; in males the claspers do not extend past the disc margin. A weak swimmer, the blind electric ray likely pushes itself along using its pelvic fins. It is known to feed on polychaete worms, and can defend itself with an electric shock. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not have enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. Taxonomy The trawler Doto collected the first known specimen of the blind electric ray from the Foveaux Strait, during a research cruise in early 1900. The head of the expedition Lake F. Ayson gave the specimen to Augustus Hamilton of the Dominion Museum, who named it Astrape aysoni in his honor. Hamilton published his account of the species in a 1902 volume of the scientific journal Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute. In 1909, Edgar R. Waite created the new genus Typhlonarke for this species. The blind electric ray may also be referred to as the blind legged torpedo or the round electric ray. Distribution and habitat The exact range of the blind electric ray is uncertain owing to confusion with the oval electric ray. The two species are found off the eastern coast of New Zealand, from the East Cape of North Island to the Snares Shelf south of South Island, including the Cook and Foveaux Straits and the Stewart and Chatham Islands. This bottom- dwelling species typically occurs at a depth of , but has been reported from between deep. Description The blind electric ray has a nearly circular pectoral fin disc measuring about 70% of the total length, with rather thin margins. The tiny eyes are not visible externally, being located beneath the surface of the skin; their positions are indicated by small white patches. Following the eyes are oval spiracles with raised, smooth rims. The nostrils are closely spaced, with their outer margins curled to form near-complete tubes, and their inner margins enlarged and fused together into a fleshy, skirt-shaped curtain that almost reaches the mouth. The mouth is small and deeply recessed. The teeth are arranged with a quincunx pattern to form narrow plates limited to the front of the jaws. There are 10-12 tooth rows in either jaw; the innermost teeth have a sharp cusp, while the outermost teeth are worn down and flattened. The five pairs of gill slits are short and curved. The anterior portion of each pelvic fin is modified into a wide, paddle-like appendage. The posterior portion of the pelvic fins merge smoothly with the pectoral fins to form part of the disc; there is a notch where their margins meet the tail. Adult males have relatively small, slightly flattened claspers whose tips do not extend past the disc margin. The single dorsal fin is rectangular in shape with a rounded trailing margin, and originates over the rear of the pelvic fin bases. The short, thick tail bears faint lateral skin folds along either side and terminates in a nearly circular caudal fin slightly longer than tall. The skin is entirely devoid of dermal denticles. This species is uniformly brown above, becoming darker towards the tail, and beige below. The undersides of the pelvic fin appendages are nearly white. Most blind electric rays do not exceed in length. However, there is an old report of a specimen that may have been over long. Biology and ecology With flabby musculature and a reduced tail, the blind electric ray seems to have very limited swimming capability. Instead, it is inferred to \\"walk\\" along the bottom on its mobile pelvic fin appendages. A blind predator that probably feeds via suction, this species is known to consume polychaete worms. Like other electric rays, it has a pair of kidney-shaped electric organs located beside its head, that allow it to generate an electric shock for defense. Each electric organ is made of 180-200 relatively large, fluid-filled hexagonal columns, which essentially act as batteries connected in parallel. A known parasite of this species is the tapeworm Pentaloculum macrocephalum. The blind electric ray is aplacental viviparous, with females bearing litters of up to 11. The newborns measure long. Human interactions The blind electric ray is caught in bottom trawls and may be threatened by commercial fisheries within its range. However, specific data is lacking and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Data Deficient. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the blind electric ray as \\"Not Threatened\\" with the qualifier \\"Data Poor\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

Biography  The son of Sergio Liberovici (musician, Turin, 1930–1991) and Margot Galante Garrone, Andrea Liberovici studied composition, violin and viola at the conservatories of Venice and Turin. He also studied acting at the Scuola del Teatro Stabile in Genoa, and singing with Cathy Berberian at the International Festival in Montalcino in 1980. He recorded his first at the age of fifteen. As a composer and director, he co-founded Teatrodelsuono (theatre of sound) with poet Edoardo Sanguineti (librettist of Luciano Berio) and Ottavia Fusco. Jean- Jacques Nattiez wrote, \\"Andrea Liberovici is a composer of his time. He define himself a modern. [...] We can find in his Frankenstein Cabaret a metaphor of the composer today. [...] he his a tragic musicians, a tragic-postmodern composer who tell about man and woman compared with the absurd and unbearable loneliness in which Internet borders more and more humanity.\\" Over the last decade, in collaboration with artists such as Peter Greenaway, Claudia Cardinale, Aldo Nove, Judith Malina, Vittorio Gassman, Giorgio Albertazzi, Enrico Ghezzi, Ivry Gitlis and Regina Carter, Liberovici has created many projects concerning the relationships between music, poetry, theatre, and technology. Recently, those who have performed his music include Yuri Bashmet, Nouvel Ensemble Moderne (Montreal), Toscanini Orchestra, and Teatro Carlo Felice. His works have also been presented and produced by the Teatro di Roma (Rome), La Fenice (Venice), and Salle Olivier Messiaen (Paris).

Time to depart from the snares of the flesh, with all its guilt, Time now to ruminate how I may find the great son of Mary. Time to seek virtue, to trample upon the will with sorrow, Time to reject vices, and to renounce the Demon. Time to reproach the body, for of its crime it is putrid, Time to rest after we have reached the place wherein we may shed our tears. Time to talk of the last day, to separate from familiar faces, Time to dread the terrors of the tumults of the day of judgment. Time to defy the clayey body, to reduce it to religious rule, Time to barter the transitory things for the country of the King of heaven. Time to defy the ease of the little earthly world of a hundred pleasures, Time to work at prayer, in adoration of the high King of angels. But only a part of one year is wanting of my three score, To remain under holy rule in one place it is time. Those of my own age are not living, who were given to ardent devotion, To desist from the course of great folly, in one place it is time.

The assumption was that the central cause of all famines was a decline in food availability. However this does not explain why only a certain section of the population such as the agricultural laborer was affected by famines while others were insulated from them. Failure of exchange entitlements It has been suggested by Amartya Sen in his book Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation that the causal mechanism for precipitating starvation includes many variables other than just decline of food availability such as the inability of an agricultural laborer to exchange his primary entitlement, i.e. labor for rice, when his employment became erratic or was completely eliminated. According to the proposed theory, famines are due to an inability of a person to exchange his entitlements rather than to food unavailability. This theory is called the failure of exchange entitlements or FEE in short. Lack of democracy Amartya Sen advances the theory that lack of democracy and famines are interrelated; he cites the example of the Bengal famine of 1943, stating that it only occurred because of the lack of democracy in India under British rule. He further argues that the situation was aggravated by the British government's suspension of trade in rice and grains among various Indian provinces.Sen, A. Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation, 1981; Oxford University Press. Olivier Rubin's review of the evidence disagrees with Sen; after examining the cases of post-Independence India, Niger, and Malawi, he finds that \\"democracy is no panacea against famine.\\" Rubin's analysis questions whether democracy and a free press were sufficient to truly avert famine in 1967 and 1972 (the Maharashtra famine involved some 130,000 deaths), and notes that some dynamics of electoral democracy complicate rather than bring about famine relief efforts. Rubin does not address colonial period famines. On the other hand, Andrew Banik's study Starvation and India's democracy affirms Sen's thesis, but indicates that while democracy has been able to prevent famines in India, it has not been sufficient to avoid severe under-nutrition and starvation deaths, which Banik calls a 'silent emergency' in the country.

Teatro Rossini is the name of an opera house in Pesaro, Italy that serves as a venue for the Rossini Opera Festival. Built as the Teatro Nuovo (on the site of the original 1637 Teatro del Sole), it was inaugurated on 10 June 1818 with a performance of Gioacchino Rossini's La gazza ladra conducted by the composer in the town of his birth. It seats 860, with an auditorium designed in the classic horseshoe shape with four tiers of boxes plus the gallery. The theatre took its present name in the composer's honour in 1854. After a 1930 earthquake it required structural renovations. It re-opened in August 1934 with a performance of Guglielmo Tell. In 1966, however, cracks in the walls and decaying woodwork led to its being declared unsafe, and it was closed for 14 years. It re-opened again on 6 April 1980, the same year as the first Rossini Opera Festival took place. Since then it has been the home of the annual festival, which is held in August.

The park is located west of Hurricane and south of Harrisburg. Quail Creek State Park offers camping, boating, swimming, and fishing. The maximum depth of Quail Creek can reach , it is cold enough to sustain the stocked rainbow trout, bullhead catfish, and crappie. Largemouth bass, which are also stocked, and bluegill thrive in the warmer, upper layers of the reservoir. History Quail Creek reservoir was completed in 1985 to provide irrigation and culinary water to the St. George area. Most of the water in the reservoir does not come from Quail Creek, but is diverted from the Virgin River and transported through a buried pipeline. Two dams form the reservoir. The main dam is an earthfill embankment dam. The south dam is a roller- compacted concrete dam, constructed to replace the original earthfill dam that failed in the early hours of New Year's Day 1989. Naming The name came from the considerable population of quail that lived along its upper drainage in the 19th and early 20th century. They did not survive one particularly hard winter. The name of Anthony Quayle who is sometimes supposed to be its namesake is a different spelling and does not have an historical connection to this particular drainage. Misnaming The name Quail Creek has been misplaced on current area maps. The true location was described in the Quail Creek Decree, a judgment declared by the Fifth Judicial District Court of Washington County, Utah, on March 5, 1923, which assigns water from Quail Creek to the areas along its stream. The Decree defines Quail Creek as \\"a natural stream of water which with all its tributaries lies within Washington County, State of Utah; ...said stream rises in the Pine Valley Mountains and flows in a southeasterly direction to a junction with the Virgin River in said county.\\" The Decree describes Quail Creek as \\"a fluctuating stream\\" and states that \\"all of the waters thereof are of such quality that they may be applied to beneficial uses for culinary, domestic and other purposes.\\" The true Quail Creek is fed by numerous tributaries issuing from the southern face of Pine Valley Mountain, and provides agricultural and domestic water to area residents as described in the Quail Creek Decree. Current maps have erroneously applied the label \\"Leeds Creek,\\" but the naming of the creek predates the availability of the name Leeds. The name Leeds Creek was given by 19th century settlers to the manmade ditch they created to bring water from Quail Creek to their farms and community. The canyon that is mistakenly labeled Quail Creek on recent maps is a small, dry canyon which has no tributaries. It is found in a completely different location, does not match the Decree's description, and represents a clerical error. Correct naming is crucial to the many historical facts and rights associated with this drainage. The Quail Creek Decree and its related documents may be viewed by searching the name and accessing it through the Utah Division of Water Rights web site.

Dynamic height is the most appropriate height measure when working with the level of water over a large geographic area, and is used by the Great Lakes Datum in the US and Canada. Dynamic height is constant if one follows the same gravity potential as they move from place to place. Because of variations in gravity, surfaces having a constant difference in dynamic height may be closer or further apart in various places. Dynamic heights are usually chosen so that zero corresponds to the geoid. When optical leveling is done, the path corresponds closely to following a value of dynamic height horizontally, but not to orthometric height for vertical changes measured on the leveling rod. Thus small corrections must be applied to field measurements to obtain either the dynamic height or the orthometric height usually used in engineering. US National Geodetic Survey data sheets give both dynamic and orthometric values. Dynamic height can be computed using the normal gravity at 45 degree latitude and the locations geopotential number.

It is currently held in the Museo del Prado, Madrid, where it was identified as a Bruegel original in 2010. Like much of Bruegel's work it depicts peasant life, in this case a festival known as St. Martin's Day, which involves drinking the first wine of the season. Description of painting The picture depicts a popular festival celebrated on 11 November. Although it is not a religious painting as such, it contains references to Christianity. There is a roadside cross, which the peasants seemingly ignore, and among the many figures is a group which alludes to the legend of St Martin of Tours dividing his cloak to share it with a beggar. This idea of having an important theme relegated to the side of the painting is paralleled in, for example, Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, which also highlights ordinary events. The picture has been dated on stylistic grounds to the 1560s. It is one of several surviving works by this artist executed in glue-size on linen (Tüchlein). By the early twenty-first century, when its owners took it to the Prado for restoration, the painting was not in a good state of conservation . This source describes the painting as a canvas, but the fabric is a finer one than this word implies. The Spanish term lienzo can mean linen as well as canvas. This is not surprising as the fragile medium tends to cause conservation problems. (On the other hand, The Blind Leading the Blind, one of the other Bruegels in this medium, is in relatively good condition). After restoration, the painting was put on public display in the Prado. Provenance The work was identified as a Bruegel in 2010 at the Museo del Prado in Madrid. A study of the surface using X-rays revealed fragments of Bruegel's signature, thereby confirming his authorship. It was subsequently acquired by the Prado for less than its value on the open market. García, Angeles (23 September 2010), Cultura inicia la adquisición por siete millones de una de las obras más importantes de Bruegel 'El Viejo', El País The Wine of Saint Martin's Day matches the description of a painting which was inventoried in the collection of the Gonzaga dukes of Mantua in the early seventeenth century. However, there is some doubt as to whether the painting in Mantua was the painting now in the Prado. It might, for example, have been a related painting now in Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum, which shows the group around St Martin.Believed to be a copy by another member of the Bruegel family, the Vienna painting replicates the Saint Martin scene. () The earliest documentary evidence which definitely relates to the work now in the Prado Museum is an inventory of the collection of a Spanish aristocrat, Luis Francisco de la Cerda, the ninth duke of Medinaceli. The inventory was drawn up after the duke's death in the early eighteenth century: he is assumed to have acquired the painting in Italy around the end of the seventeenth century.The painting’s provenance (Gonzaga (?), Medinaceli), Prado website (www.museodelprado.es) See also *The Prado also has another work by this artist, The Triumph of Death.

Igero bus Igero is a bus manufactured in multiple versions: as a city or intercity midibus or as the Igero Maxi, which is a 10-meter version designed for urban transport, with a passenger capacity of up to 80 people. The design of the bus shows strong resemblance to the bigger Roman 17.280 bus, because the Igero bus is the technical platform on what it is based. There was a strong cooperation between the two manufacturers, based mainly on Roman allowing El Car to use their production facilities. There was a plan for building their own factory but its completion had to be delayed. However the collaboration with Roman ended and the production line was moved to the Romprim factory in Bucharest.Google Maps - ROMPRIM S.A. Bucharest, Romania Igero midibuses operate public transportation in Braşov, Târgu Mureş and in Covasna County. The first Igero bus was built by Igescu in his own garage, in 2004, and was successfully franchised in Romania. The midibus version of the Igero lengths 8.5m and has a seating capacity of either 31 persons in the intercity version or 59 in the city version. They come equipped with MAN EURO 3 turbocharged diesel engines, developing 170 HP. The gearbox is from ZF and the suspensions are pneumatic. Standard features also include ABS/ASR brakes and air conditioning system.

The name of the island derives from the Nahuatl: ōme 'two' and tepētl 'mountain (s),' since it is almost entirely composed of two volcanic cones: Concepción (volcano) and Maderas volcano. Access to the Museum is free to island residents and has an entrance fee of $10 USD for foreign tourists to visit both museums and $6 USD for domestic visitors. The museum requires multilateral support to increase the exhibition area as well as scientific research on many pieces, to enhance information about the articles and to support scientific studies of the important archaeological area. Due to the absence of outside interest, its own privately generated revenue is insufficient for its continued maintenance and operation into the distant future. Museum history The museum has two specific sections in two separate buildings; one is the Nicaraguan Numismatics, and another about pre- Hispanic archaeology of the area. The archaeology exhibition area has six exhibition halls over 200 square meters, a two-storey exhibition, the only one equipped with air conditioning to preserve the archaeological exhibits. The Museum was founded in 2007 by Moises David Ghitis Rivera, a Nicaraguan philanthropist, on his agricultural and cattle farm on the island of Ometepe. It is the only private pre-Hispanic museum in the island of Ometepe, with a collection of more than 1500 archaeological pieces, which are on permanent display.  Pre-Hispanic Archaeology Museum  On the first floor of the Museum is the Ceramic Hall, displaying urns, metates (grindstones) and stone tools. On the second floor of the Museum there is the women representation, the Pottery Hall, varieties and body ornaments room; the 1,500 pieces on display there have been found throughout the island by different farmers, and others were held privately as families heritage which was donated to the Museum. Petroglyphs Petroglyph, El Ceibo Museum, Ometepe, Nicaragua The outer courtyard of the Museum displays 16 petroglyphs specimens, found in the area, 13 of which were found in the Maderas volcano, two on the Museum grounds owned by Moses Ghitis and 1 is of unknown origin. The island has many petroglyphs some dated as early as 300 BCE. Ancient native tomb  Upon entering the museum, in the First Hall, the most striking display is the recreation of a pre-Hispanic tomb; it was found and studied 15 years ago by Ghitis Rivera, 700 meters from the Museum now. During the recovery process, it was mapped identifying location of human remains and the artifacts contained. The pre-Hispanic tomb was reconstructed within the Museum; it contains teeth, bones placed in a ceramic vase, a jade pendant, an animal teeth necklace, an eagle head tripod and a gold shaman, hence it is inferred that the remains belong to a very important person of Ometepe ancestors. The origin of the gold Ometepe article opens an interesting topic of research, regarding its origin, meaning, etc. Oldest pieces of the collection  Flint Spearhead, 5,600 years old, El Ceibo Museum, Ometepe, Nicaragua Flint fish-shaped Ceramic Tripod, 2,800 years old, El Ceibo Museum, Ometepe, Nicaragua Xulo Dog, 2,800 years old, El Ceibo Museum, Ometepe, Nicaragua Spearhead, estimated age of 5600 years.

Other pieces found have distinctive Maya, Inca, and Aztec influences. Square Stone Vessel, El Ceibo Museum, Ometepe, Nicaragua Exhibition halls  The following is a brief description of the various halls and its contents.

History Founded in Ely as coachbuilders in 1868 by John Orviss Vince (1846–1923), they carried on a local business as constructors of all types of horse-drawn vehicles through to the inter-war period, when they began to include early motor-buses (‘Vince’s Golden Queen’) in their trade. At this time the business had passed on into the hands of J. O. Vince’s son Albert Edward Vince (1885–1954), and after the Second World War, on again to Albert Edward’s sons Peter (1915–1987) and Albert (aka ‘Bill’, 1920–2004). During this latter period of 40 years, the business became specialists in ex-government vehicles. The surviving brother ‘Bill’ Vince ceased trading as Vince & Son in the late 1980s. In their final incarnation under Peter and Bill’s direction, Vince & Son maintained links with their origins in the title ‘Vince & Son Motor Engineers and Coachbuilders’. The name 'Vince & Son' was revived in 2010, by descendant Edward Vince, for an art direction and graphic design studio. Personnel J. O. Vince, the original ‘Vince’ in the company name, served a teenage apprenticeship which, as well as coach-crafts and blacksmithing with his father in Downham Market, Norfolk, included assistance with the production of Ely Cathedral’s nave ceiling paintings by its Victorian restorers. Each of the three generations of Vince & Son proprietors maintained the craftsman’s side of the coachbuilder’s art: John Orviss had to be able to build a cart from the ground-up and complete its decoration, his son Albert Edward carried on the complex paint-mixing, varnishing, coach-lining and upholstering skills into the motor age, and his sons Peter and Bill retained this knowledge. Bill Vince sold vintage vehicle parts, for about 13 years, up to 2003.

Empirical scales measure temperature in relation to convenient and stable parameters, such as the freezing and boiling point of water. Absolute temperature is based on thermodynamic principles, using the lowest possible temperature as the zero point and selecting a convenient incremental unit. Definition The zeroth law of thermodynamics describes thermal equilibrium between thermodynamic systems in form of an equivalence relation. Accordingly, all thermal systems may be divided into a quotient set, denoted as M. If the set M has the cardinality of c, then one can construct an injective function ƒ: M → R , by which every thermal system has a parameter associated with it such that when two thermal systems have the same value of that parameter, they are in thermal equilibrium. This parameter is the property of temperature. The specific way of assigning numerical values for temperature is establishing a scale of temperature. In practical terms, a temperature scale is always based on usually a single physical property of a simple thermodynamic system, called a thermometer, that defines a scaling function for mapping the temperature to the measurable thermometric parameter. Such temperature scales that are purely based on measurement are called empirical temperature scales. The second law of thermodynamics provides a fundamental, natural definition of thermodynamic temperature starting with a null point of absolute zero. A scale for thermodynamic temperature is established similarly to the empirical temperature scales, however, needing only one additional fixing point. Empirical scales Empirical scales are based on the measurement of physical parameters that express the property of interest to be measured through some formal, most commonly a simple linear, functional relationship. For the measurement of temperature, the formal definition of thermal equilibrium in terms of the thermodynamic coordinate spaces of thermodynamic systems, expressed in the zeroth law of thermodynamics, provides the framework to measure temperature. All temperature scales, including the modern thermodynamic temperature scale used in the International System of Units, are calibrated according to thermal properties of a particular substance or device. Typically, this is established by fixing two well-defined temperature points and defining temperature increments via a linear function of the response of the thermometric device. For example, both the old Celsius scale and Fahrenheit scale were originally based on the linear expansion of a narrow mercury column within a limited range of temperature, each using different reference points and scale increments. Different empirical scales may not be compatible with each other, except for small regions of temperature overlap. If an alcohol thermometer and a mercury thermometer have same two fixed points, namely the freezing and boiling point of water, their reading will not agree with each other except at the fixed points, as the linear 1:1 relationship of expansion between any two thermometric substances may not be guaranteed. Empirical temperature scales are not reflective of the fundamental, microscopic laws of matter. Temperature is a universal attribute of matter, yet empirical scales map a narrow range onto a scale that is known to have a useful functional form for a particular application. Thus, their range is limited. The working material only exists in a form under certain circumstances, beyond which it no longer can serve as a scale. For example, mercury freezes below 234.32 K, so temperature lower than that cannot be measured in a scale based on mercury. Even ITS-90, which interpolates among different ranges of temperature, has only a range of 0.65 K to approximately 1358 K (−272.5 °C to 1085 °C). Ideal gas scale When pressure approaches zero, all real gas will behave like ideal gas, that is, of a mole of gas relying only on temperature. Therefore, we can design a scale with as its argument. Of course any bijective function will do, but for convenience's sake linear function is the best. Therefore, we define it as : T={1 \\\\over nR}\\\\lim_{p \\\\to 0}{pV}. The ideal gas scale is in some sense a \\"mixed\\" scale. It relies on the universal properties of gas, a big advance from just a particular substance. But still it is empirical since it puts gas at a special position and thus has limited applicability—at some point no gas can exist. One distinguishing characteristic of ideal gas scale, however, is that it precisely equals thermodynamical scale when it is well defined (see below).  International temperature scale of 1990  ITS-90 is designed to represent the thermodynamic temperature scale (referencing absolute zero) as closely as possible throughout its range. Many different thermometer designs are required to cover the entire range. These include helium vapor pressure thermometers, helium gas thermometers, standard platinum resistance thermometers (known as SPRTs, PRTs or Platinum RTDs) and monochromatic radiation thermometers. Although the Kelvin and Celsius scales are defined using absolute zero (0 K) and the triple point of water (273.16 K and 0.01 °C), it is impractical to use this definition at temperatures that are very different from the triple point of water. Accordingly, ITS–90 uses numerous defined points, all of which are based on various thermodynamic equilibrium states of fourteen pure chemical elements and one compound (water). Most of the defined points are based on a phase transition; specifically the melting/freezing point of a pure chemical element. However, the deepest cryogenic points are based exclusively on the vapor pressure/temperature relationship of helium and its isotopes whereas the remainder of its cold points (those less than room temperature) are based on triple points. Examples of other defining points are the triple point of hydrogen (−259.3467 °C) and the freezing point of aluminum (660.323 °C). Thermometers calibrated per ITS–90 use complex mathematical formulas to interpolate between its defined points. ITS–90 specifies rigorous control over variables to ensure reproducibility from lab to lab. For instance, the small effect that atmospheric pressure has upon the various melting points is compensated for (an effect that typically amounts to no more than half a millikelvin across the different altitudes and barometric pressures likely to be encountered). The standard even compensates for the pressure effect due to how deeply the temperature probe is immersed into the sample. ITS–90 also draws a distinction between \\"freezing\\" and \\"melting\\" points. The distinction depends on whether heat is going into (melting) or out of (freezing) the sample when the measurement is made. Only gallium is measured while melting, all the other metals are measured while the samples are freezing. There are often small differences between measurements calibrated per ITS–90 and thermodynamic temperature. For instance, precise measurements show that the boiling point of VSMOW water under one standard atmosphere of pressure is actually 373.1339 K (99.9839 °C) when adhering strictly to the two-point definition of thermodynamic temperature. When calibrated to ITS–90, where one must interpolate between the defining points of gallium and indium, the boiling point of VSMOW water is about 10 mK less, about 99.974 °C. The virtue of ITS–90 is that another lab in another part of the world will measure the very same temperature with ease due to the advantages of a comprehensive international calibration standard featuring many conveniently spaced, reproducible, defining points spanning a wide range of temperatures.  Celsius scale  Celsius (known until 1948 as centigrade) is a temperature scale that is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701-1744), who developed a similar temperature scale two years before his death. The degree Celsius (°C) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval (a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty). From 1744 until 1954, 0 °C was defined as the freezing point of water and 100 °C was defined as the boiling point of water, both at a pressure of one standard atmosphere. Although these defining correlations are commonly taught in schools today, by international agreement, between 1954 and 2019 the unit degree Celsius and the Celsius scale were defined by absolute zero and the triple point of VSMOW (specially prepared water). This definition also precisely related the Celsius scale to the Kelvin scale, which defines the SI base unit of thermodynamic temperature with symbol K. Absolute zero, the lowest temperature possible, is defined as being exactly 0 K and −273.15 °C. Until 19 May 2019, the temperature of the triple point of water was defined as exactly 273.16 K (0.01 °C). This means that a temperature difference of one degree Celsius and that of one kelvin are exactly the same. On 20 May 2019, the kelvin was redefined so that its value is now determined by the definition of the Boltzmann constant rather than being defined by the triple point of VSMOW. This means that the triple point is now a measured value, not a defined value. The newly-defined exact value of the Boltzmann constant was selected so that the measured value of the VSMOW triple point is exactly the same as the older defined value to within the limits of accuracy of contemporary metrology. The degree Celsius remains exactly equal to the kelvin, and 0 K remains exactly −273.15 °C.  Thermodynamic scale  Thermodynamic scale differs from empirical scales in that it is absolute. It is based on the fundamental laws of thermodynamics or statistical mechanics instead of some arbitrary chosen working material. Besides it covers full range of temperature and has simple relation with microscopic quantities like the average kinetic energy of particles (see equipartition theorem). In experiments ITS-90 is used to approximate thermodynamic scale due to simpler realization.  Definition  Lord Kelvin devised the thermodynamic scale based on the efficiency of heat engines as shown below: The efficiency of an engine is the work divided by the heat introduced to the system or : \\\\eta = \\\\frac {w_{cy}}{q_H} = \\\\frac{q_H-q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \\\\frac{q_C}{q_H} \\\\qquad (1), where wcy is the work done per cycle. Thus, the efficiency depends only on qC/qH. Because of Carnot theorem, any reversible heat engine operating between temperatures T1 and T2 must have the same efficiency, meaning, the efficiency is the function of the temperatures only: : \\\\frac{q_C}{q_H} = f(T_H,T_C)\\\\qquad (2). In addition, a reversible heat engine operating between temperatures T1 and T3 must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles, one between T1 and another (intermediate) temperature T2, and the second between T2 and T3. This can only be the case if : f(T_1,T_3) = \\\\frac{q_3}{q_1} = \\\\frac{q_2 q_3} {q_1 q_2} = f(T_1,T_2)f(T_2,T_3). Specializing to the case that T_1 is a fixed reference temperature: the temperature of the triple point of water. Then for any T2 and T3, : f(T_2,T_3) = \\\\frac{f(T_1,T_3)}{f(T_1,T_2)} = \\\\frac{273.16 \\\\cdot f(T_1,T_3)}{273.16 \\\\cdot f(T_1,T_2)}. Therefore, if thermodynamic temperature is defined by : T = 273.16 \\\\cdot f(T_1,T) \\\\, then the function f, viewed as a function of thermodynamic temperature, is : f(T_2,T_3) = \\\\frac{T_3}{T_2}, and the reference temperature T1 has the value 273.16. (Of course any reference temperature and any positive numerical value could be used—the choice here corresponds to the Kelvin scale.)  Equality to ideal gas scale  It follows immediately that : \\\\frac{q_C}{q_H} = f(T_H,T_C) = \\\\frac{T_C}{T_H}.\\\\qquad (3). Substituting Equation 3 back into Equation 1 gives a relationship for the efficiency in terms of temperature: : \\\\eta = 1 - \\\\frac{q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \\\\frac{T_C}{T_H}\\\\qquad (4). This is identical to the efficiency formula for Carnot cycle, which effectively employs the ideal gas scale. This means that the two scales equal numerically at every point.

The mall opened in August 1968, and was the main mall in the Dover area until the Dover Mall opened in 1982, leading to its decline. In the 1990s, the mall was converted into a corporate center. There is now construction on the main area to create a medical center. History Interior of the former mall, April 2019 The Blue Hen Mall opened in the late 1960s, at which time it was the only enclosed mall in Delaware. The opening of the retail hub shifted several businesses away from downtown Dover, including JCPenney, which became an anchor store at the mall. Woolco also anchored the shopping center. This store was shuttered in early 1983. It soon reopened as a Roses variety store. At its height, Blue Hen Mall housed over 50 shops. Sears was interested in relocating to the Blue Hen Mall from downtown Dover, but could not agree with management in where to place the store in the shopping center. As a result, Sears decided to relocate, along with other department stores, to the new Dover Mall which opened in 1982. Following the opening of the Dover Mall, many stores relocated from the Blue Hen Mall, turning it into a dead mall. It was also called by some of the local people as the \\"Blue Hen Chicken Mall.\\" It was mainly used in the late 1980s when the mall was not popular anymore. At this time, the Blue Hen Mall was owned by Jardel Company, Inc. and Penn Mutual. JCPenney relocated to the Dover Mall in 1993 and Roses closed in 1991. In the 1990s, the Blue Hen Mall was converted into the Blue Hen Corporate Center, with the retail space becoming office space. A Bank of America call center and an Aetna office facility served as the anchors of the corporate center. The Bank of America call center eventually closed and Aetna left the Blue Hen Corporate Center in 2009. In 2008, the property was sold by Blue Hen Venture LLC to Pettinaro Enterprises LLC for $17.4 million. Currently, the Blue Hen Corporate Center has several office vacancies. In September 2013 Bayhealth rented the space and relocated all of its information services resources from Kent General Hospital and Milford Memorial Hospital to the former Aetna space. Bayhealth did a complete renovation of the space, including new office furniture, computers and phone systems for its employees and contracting staff. 24x7 helpdesk for the entire hospital system is operated out of this new space as well.

Life  Smet was the son of Robert Smet (d. 1540) and initially studied with John Otho in Ghent (1552–54). He met several students there that like him would eventually make a name for themselves in the world of letters. Barely fifteen, he translated the Gnomae Pythagorae ac Phocylidis and the Batrachomyomachia (then ascribed to Homer) from Classical Greek and the Historia Susannae from Latin and also displayed skill in the Latin poetry. He studied medicine at Leuven, Rostocksee entry of Henrich Smet in Rostock Matrikelportal and Heidelberg and took his doctorate in 1561 in Bologna. He established a medical practice in Antwerp. As a result of his Protestant convictions, he left Antwerp during the tumult of 1567 for Duisburg. He then moved to Lemgo and was the court physician of the Count of Lippe. In 1574 he moved to Heidelberg and became court physician to the Elector Palatine, Frederick III. When Frederick died in 1576, he was succeeded by his Lutheran son Elector Louis VI who removed the Reformed faculty from the University of Heidelberg, Smet briefly practiced medicine in Frankenthal. After 1579 he entered the service of Count Palatine Johann Casimir and began to give medical lectures in the Casimirianum in Neustadt. He returned to the University of Heidelberg with the rest of the medical faculty in 1585 after Johann Casimir became the regent of the Palatinate. Besides medicine, he was interested in philology and poetry. He compiled a dictionary of Latin words, which was so successful that it was frequently reprinted throughout the seventeenth century. Many letters from Smet from the period 1585-93 are preserved in the archive of the University of Heidelberg. Smet married Johanna van den Corput in 1562, sister of the humanist and pastor Hendrik van den Corput. Works * Henrici Smetii (...) Juvenilia sacra regnum judaïcorum.

Born in Hungary but living and working in Canada, Barna produced prominent television shows such as Da Vinci's Inquest and Blue Murder. Biography Barna was born in Hungary and immigrated to Canada with his family in the late 1950s as a result of the Hungarian Uprising. His parents were Holocaust survivors who had been imprisoned in Auschwitz concentration camp. Barna and his parents arrived in Canada at Pier 21 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. As part of a 2006 portrait photography exhibit in which Barna was featured, he stated that his parents \\"had suffered under both fascism and communism, and they said they were looking for a country where politicians retire rather than being executed\\" Barna experimented with stand- up comedy but suffered from stage fright, leading him to embark on a career as a television producer. He told the Toronto Star in 2002, \\"I like it behind the camera. It's safe there.\\" By 2002 Barna's company, a partnership with his wife Laura Alper, was the most prolific producer of English-language TV programs in Canada. Awards Barna has won several industry awards, including multiple Gemini awards for Da Vinci's Inquest as \\"Best Dramatic Series\\" (in each year 1999-2002 and again in 2004).

It was built by the command of Venezuelan dictator Juan Vicente Gómez in 1933 as a present to the city when it was declared the capital of Guárico State. The monument was carved in the hills of Calabozo and moved to San Juan in 1935.

It is named after Hungarian mathematicians János Komlós, Gábor Tusnády, and Péter Major. Theory Let U_1,U_2,\\\\ldots be independent uniform (0,1) random variables. Define a uniform empirical distribution function as :F_{U,n}(t)=\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mathbf{1}_{U_i\\\\leq t},\\\\quad t\\\\in [0,1]. Define a uniform empirical process as :\\\\alpha_{U,n}(t)=\\\\sqrt{n}(F_{U,n}(t)-t),\\\\quad t\\\\in [0,1]. The Donsker theorem (1952) shows that \\\\alpha_{U,n}(t) converges in law to a Brownian bridge B(t). Komlós, Major and Tusnády established a sharp bound for the speed of this weak convergence. :Theorem (KMT, 1975) On a suitable probability space for independent uniform (0,1) r.v. U_1,U_2\\\\ldots the empirical process {\\\\alpha_{U,n}(t), 0\\\\leq t\\\\leq 1} can be approximated by a sequence of Brownian bridges {B_n(t),0\\\\leq t\\\\leq 1} such that ::P\\\\left{\\\\sup_{0\\\\leq t\\\\leq 1}\\\\alpha_{U,n}(t)-B_n(t)>\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}}(a\\\\log n+x)\\\\right}\\\\leq b e^{-cx} :for all positive integers n and all x>0, where a, b, and c are positive constants. Corollary A corollary of that theorem is that for any real iid r.v. X_1,X_2,\\\\ldots, with cdf F(t), it is possible to construct a probability space where independent sequences of empirical processes \\\\alpha_{X,n}(t)=\\\\sqrt{n}(F_{X,n}(t)-F(t)) and Gaussian processes G_{F,n}(t)=B_n(F(t)) exist such that : \\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{n}}{\\\\ln n} \\\\big\\\\ \\\\alpha_{X,n} - G_{F,n} \\\\big\\\\_\\\\infty < \\\\infty, almost surely.

He co- wrote, produced, and mixed the 2014 multi-platinum single \\"All About That Bass\\" by Meghan Trainor which spent eight weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the second best-selling song of 2014 in Australia and the eighth best-selling song in Germany and the UK. The song received two more nominations at the 57th Grammy Awards: Record of the Year and Song of the Year. Early life Born and raised in Baltimore, Kadish began playing guitar at the age of 13. After graduating high school, he attended Berklee College of Music and studied Film Scoring. In 1991, Kadish transferred from Berklee to the University of Maryland, College Park where he designed his own major, Music Management, through the Individual Studies Department. He graduated in 1993 with a B.S. in Music Management. Career Throughout the mid-1990s, Kadish toured the East Coast as a solo, acoustic artist, opening for Hall & Oates, Vertical Horizon, Dave Matthews Band, Jeff Beck, SR-71, Marcy Playground, Everything, and others. In 1998, Kadish signed a development deal with Republic Records as a solo recording artist. He recorded with the producer Steve Addabbo in NYC's Shelter Island Sound but no album was ever released. In 2000, Kadish met record producer Matt Serletic who signed him as his \\"staff-writer\\" to Serletic's co-venture with Warner/Chappell Music. While under the wing of Serletic, Kadish co-wrote \\"Be There For You\\" and \\"Don't Fade Away\\" on Willie Nelson's album The Great Divide. He also co-wrote the songs \\"(There's Gotta Be) More to Life\\" and \\"Stuck\\" for Christian pop singer Stacie Orrico which appeared in the television shows The Simple Life and That's So Raven, as well as the animated film Robots. These two hits have been featured on several compilations which have sold nearly 11 million copies, cumulatively. In 2005, Kadish received an ASCAP Christian Music Award for Stacie Orrico's \\"(There's Gotta Be) More To Life\\" for being one of the most played songs on Christian radio. Also in 2005, Kadish collaborated with singer/songwriter Jason Mraz on his sophomore album, Mr. A-Z, producing and writing both singles (\\"Wordplay\\" and \\"Geek in the Pink\\") For his work on this record, Kadish was nominated for Best Engineered Album at the 48th Grammy Awards in 2005. In 2006, Kadish received the SOCAN award for his No.1 \\"Flawed Design\\" by Stabilo. In 2007, the song also received the SOCAN award for greatest number of plays on Canadian radio in 2006. From 2007 to 2011, Kadish worked on and wrote on records with Gloriana, Miley Cyrus, Meat Loaf and Victoria Justice. In 2012, Kevin co-wrote and produced \\"Crazy For You\\" with Ross Lynch, \\"Rooftops\\" with American Idol winner Kris Allen. In September 2013, Kadish co-wrote \\"All About That Bass\\" with Meghan Trainor. The song became the third best-selling song of 2014, and was also the 14th most-viewed YouTube video ever, with more than 1.7 billion views. However, in September 2015, Kadish claimed to have earned just $5,679 as a result of the song being streamed to 178 million people, telling a meeting arranged by the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary: \\"That's as big a song as a songwriter can have in their career and number one in 78 countries. But you're making $5,600. How do you feed your family?\\" In 2015, Kadish worked with artists such as Garth Brooks, Daniel Powter, Miranda Lambert, O.A.R., A Great Big World, Jennifer Lopez, Fifth Harmony, Steven Tyler (Aerosmith), and others. In 2016, Kadish partnered with producer and songwriter Nathan Chapman (Taylor Swift, Keith Urban, Lady Antebellum, etc.) to form an artist development company, Starts With Music. In 2018, the company's first sign with Brynn Elliot, signed to Atlantic Records, and her first single \\"Might Not Like Me\\" had enormous success at radio. The company has also signed country artist Jake Rose who is currently on tour across the country with various country acts.

Other places where this brand is manufactured include Ukraine, Moldova, Cyprus and the United Arab Emirates. History The name is derived from Jinling, the older name of Nanjing, where the brand was originally developed by the Chinese state-owned Nanjing Tobacco Factory. After the brand died out, the Baltic Tobacco Company re-introduced it in 1997. The packet design resembles the American brand Camel in colour, typeface and layout, but instead of a camel, it features a mouflon. Jin Ling cigarettes are only sold illegally and the brand is the first to be designed explicitly for smuggling. It has been reported by customs officials as the \\"most seized\\" brand in Europe; in 2007, 258 million Jin Ling cigarettes were seized by authorities in EU countries. In 2017, during a bust by the North East Lincolnshire Council Trading Standards officers, a red variant of Jin Ling cigarettes was discovered. Previous Jin Ling cigarettes only had a yellow colour. There are 19 factories in Russia where Jin Ling is produced, but there are also factories in Ukraine and Moldova. Some of these factories may be acting as a franchise, but the Jin Ling brand is also licensed to other manufacturers. Controversy=Feathers, mites and rat droppings in Jin Ling cigarettes In May 2010, the German tabloid Berliner Kurier reported that fake Jin Ling were being made, which were no longer distinguishable from the genuine, and which could include feathers, mites, wood, pesticides, mold spores, rat droppings and other pollutants, because they were manufactured under very poor production conditions. 71 year old woman dies in house fire caused by Jin Ling cigarettes In April 2014 the cigarette was linked to a house fire in Spalding in which a 71-year-old woman, June Buffham, had died. Emma Milligan, a Trading Standards Officer at Lincolnshire County Council, said: \\"Jin Ling cigarettes are so dangerous because they don't go out when not actively being smoked, potentially causing a horrendous house fire, like the case here.\\" See also * Cigarette * Tobacco smoking References Category:Russian cigarette brands Category:Products introduced in 1997 Category:Russian brands ","title":"Jin Ling"},{"id":"29185457","text":"Subhajit Saha is a professional table tennis player from West Bengal, India.

Early life Grignon was born in Sainte-Adèle, Quebec. He was a cousin of writer Germaine Guèvremont.French Canadian Writers: Germaine Guèvremont at Athabasca University Centre for Language and Literature. Career Grignon began working as a journalist in 1916, writing for a number of publications in Quebec, including La Minerve, Le Matin, Le Canada, Le Petit Journal, La Revue populaire, La Renaissance and Bataille. He published his debut novel, Le Secret de Lindbergh, in 1929. His second novel, Un Homme et son péché, was published in 1933. A tale of a man whose greed leads to the death of his wife, the book broke with Quebec's literary conventions of the time by satirizing rather than glorifying life in rural Quebec, and came to be recognized as one of Quebec's early modernist novels. By contrast, Guèvremont's novels in the same period continued to follow Quebec's more traditionalist romans du terroir style. Grignon released the short story collection Le Déserteur et autres récits de la terre in 1934. As well, he wrote literary and political criticism, including Les Vivants et les autres and Ombres et Clameurs. In his work Les Pamphlets de Valdombre, a trenchant satire of the government of Maurice Duplessis,William H. New, The Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada. . Grignon advanced the theory that publisher and literary critic Louis Dantin was the real author of the poetry of Émile Nelligan;Gaëtan Dostie, \\"Nelligan et de Bussières créés par Dantin ?\\". Le Patriote. Republished by the Saint- Jean-Baptiste Society of Montreal, July 22, 2015. although the claim was widely derided and denied by Dantin himself, it was later readvanced by literary historian Yvette Francoli in her 2013 book Le naufragé du Vaisseau d'or. He subsequently wrote a serial radio dramatization of Un Homme et son péché, as well as the television adaptation Les Belles Histoires des pays d'en haut. The novel has also been adapted as a film three times, including 1949's A Man and His Sin and 2002's Séraphin: Heart of Stone (Séraphin: un homme et son péché).\\"Claude-Henri Grignon avait-il tout faux?\\" Le Journal de Montreal, Guy Fournier, 22 December 2015 Grignon later served as mayor of Sainte-Adèle from 1941 to 1951.

Details Burwell Castle was built near the village of Burwell in 1143 by Stephen I of England, on the site of a former Roman villa.Cambridgeshire Extensive Urban Survey: Burwell, pp.15, 23. It was constructed during the civil war of the Anarchy, a long running dispute between the supporters of Stephen, and his Angevin rival, the Empress Matilda. The baron Geoffrey de Mandeville was dispossessed of his castles by Stephen and rose up in revolt immediately afterwards, taking up a position near Ely in the Fens and threatening Cambridge Castle and the route south to London; Burwell Castle was built as part of a chain of castles to protect the region, including fortifications at Lidgate, Rampton, Caxton, Swavesey and possibly Knapwell.Creighton, p.59. Stephen appropriated the village of Burwell, which was constructed on a raised area of land of Roman origin, and proceeded to commence building the castle. It consists of a sub-rectangular mound measuring and surrounded by a rectangular ditch up to wide. Geoffrey de Mandeville attacked Burwell in 1144 when the castle was still unfinished, but during the operation he was hit by a crossbow bolt; he retired to nearby Mildenhall, where he died from the injury.Cambridgeshire Extensive Urban Survey: Burwell, pp.23-4. After Geoffrey's death the castle was never completed, although a stone gatehouse was completed on the site, suggesting a period of further occupation.Cambridgeshire Extensive Urban Survey: Burwell, p.24; Pettifer, p.11. The Abbot of Ramsey built a chapel on the site around 1246, and the site was finally abandoned in the 15th century.Cambridgeshire Extensive Urban Survey: Burwell, p.24. The archaeologist T. C. Lethbridge excavated the site in 1935.Cambridgeshire Extensive Urban Survey: Burwell, p.15. At the time portions of stone walling survived but were later destroyed during testing of a fire hose. The castle site was bought by the Burwell Parish Council in 1983.Malim, p.2 The University of Exeter conducted a geophysical and topographical survey of the castle in the 2010s.

Background  Lady Wu was born in 858, during the reign of Emperor Xuānzong. Her family was from Anguo (安國, in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang). Her father was one Wu Zhongxin (吳仲忻), who had served on the staff of a governor (觀察使, Guanchashi) of Zhexi Circuit (浙西, then-headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu).  Marriage to Qian Liu  It is not known exactly when Lady Wu married Qian Liu — but it must be before his rise to prominence, because it was said that at that time, the people in Wu Zhongxin's household opposed the marriage proposal from Qian on the basis that he did not care for property management. Wu Zhongxin's older brother, however, believed in Qian's talent and agreed to the marriage proposal. It was said that after they became married, Lady Wu organized the household well and was filially pious to his parents. As Qian had an impatient and harsh disposition, she often tried to moderate his temper by her tender advice. She bore 13 of Qian's 38 sons, although the only son that was clearly known to be born by her was his third son Qian Chuanying (錢傳瑛), and his eventual successor Qian Yuanguan was not her son but that of his concubine Lady Chen. However, she was said to be loving to all of his sons, including the ones that she did not bear. For example, when Qian Yuanguan was forced by circumstances to serve as a hostage from Qian Liu to Tian Jun the military governor of Ningguo Circuit (寧國, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui) in 902, she wept bitterly and worried about the dangers that Qian Yuanguan would be in.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. Through Qian Liu's career, initially as a vassal of Tang Dynasty and later as a vassal of Tang's succeeding dynasty Later Liang, Lady Wu also received increasingly honorable titles — Lady of Yan, then Lady of Jin, and finally Lady Zhengde of Wuyue. She often visited Fengguo Temple (奉國寺), and Qian put aside silk for her to be able to donate to monks. However, she pointed out that this was a high expenditure that the state could not afford, and declined it on that basis. She was also accustomed to visit Qian's hometown Yijin Base (衣錦軍, in modern Hangzhou) every spring. Lady Wu died in 919, while Qian Liu was still reigning (and serving as a vassal of the Later Liang emperor Zhu Zhen). She was given the posthumous name of Zhuangmu (\\"victorious and solemn\\").

It sponsors work focusing on international relations, security studies, international migration, human rights and justice, political economy and technology policy. The center was founded in 1951.Donald L.M. Blackmer, The MIT Center for International Studies: The Founding Years 1951–1969 (MIT, 2002). According to its website, CIS aims \\"to support and promote international research and education at MIT\\". History The MIT Center for International Studies was one of several academic research centers founded in the United States after World War II. Its creation was originally funded by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), in order to provide expert analysis on issues pertaining to the Cold War rivalry with the Soviet Union. Prominent social scientists involved with CIS include Lucian Pye, Eugene Skolnikoff, William Kaufmann, Walt Rostow, Ithiel de Sola Pool, Carl Kaysen. Early on, the center specialized in political and economic development, military strategy, and Asia, and many of its faculty (e.g. Rostow and Kaysen) served in high government posts. Daniel Ellsberg was a research fellow at CIS when he released the Pentagon Papers in 1971. Programs The Security Studies Program (SSP), a joint program with the department of political science, was established in the 1970s. Many prominent security specialists in government, think tanks, the military and academia, including Geoffrey Kemp, Daniel Byman, Ken Pollack, and William Durch, undertook their doctoral studies in SSP. Since the early 1990s, it has been associated with the Neorealist school of international relations, led by such theorists as Barry Posen and Stephen Van Evera. The MIT International Science and Technology Initiative (MISTI) is a novel program in applied international studies. MISTI has placed 7,233 students around the globe from 1983 to 2015. In the 2014–2015 academic year, 880+ students participated. 31% of MIT students who graduated in 2015 participated in MISTI at some point during their MIT experience. Of these MISTI students, 27% participated in MISTI more than one time. The center organizes Seminar XXI, a yearly educational program for senior military officers, government and NGO officials, and other leaders in U.S. national security policy. In 2015, the MIT Center for International Studies established the MIT International Policy Lab (IPL), whose mission is “to enhance the impact of MIT research on public policy, in order to best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century.” The Policy Lab will award up to $10,000 to faculty and research staff with principal investigator status who wish to convey their research to policymakers. The center also has programs in international political economy, particularly the MIT Program on Emerging Technologies (POET), a National Science Foundation awardee. Other programs include: *Bustani Middle East Seminar *International Migration and Humanitarian Studies *Persian Gulf Initiative *Program on Emerging Technologies *International Policy Lab * South Asian Politics Several visiting fellows and scholars join the center each year, including outstanding women journalists under the Elizabeth Neuffer Fellowship, and distinguished public servants under the Robert E. Wilhelm Fellowship. Other individuals have spent weeks or months at the center, such as Ranil Wickremasinghe, former prime minister of Sri Lanka; David Miliband, former foreign secretary of the U.K.; and Fatemeh Haghighatjoo, a former reform member of the Majlis of Iran.

He is editor of the Australian sector of Poetry International Web and publishes with The Vagabond Press .  Early life and education  The Main Quadrangle of the University of Sydney Brennan completed his Ph.D. at The University of Sydney in 2001, where he wrote his thesis: The Impossible Gaze: Robert Adamson and the work of negativity . During his time at The University of Sydney, Brennan co-edited the university’s undergraduate literary journal, Hermes , an annual magazine which publishes the works of students at the university. He also began writing a journal for a class taught by Elizabeth Webby who was the editor of the Australian literary magazine Southerly from 1988-1999. Webby asked Brennan to work on Southerly, an opportunity which Brennan has referred to, saying “That was my real start”. While Brennan was living in Paris in 1998, he was inspired by Blanchot’s Chapbooks, which had been published by Fata Morgana , and on his return to The University of Sydney in 1999, Michael Brennan founded and began directing The Vagabond Press, his own independent literary press .  Poetic work, books and awards  Brennan has written six individual collections of poetry to date and two collaborative works, with a style described by David McCooey of Jacket Magazine as “a strange, sometimes surreal, world, to illustrate the possible foreignness of any place, even home” . His first book, titled “The Imageless World” was published in 2003 by Salt Publishing . The collection is described on Google Books as “Dipping between parody and mourning”, and contains three sections: Youth, Excavation Series and Pop Currency . The Imageless World was shortlisted for the NSW Premier’s Award for Poetry and was the winner of the Mary Gilmore Award . In 2004, Brennan won the Marten Bequest Travelling Scholarship, and, funded by the Literature Board of the Australian Council for the Arts, and a Nancy Keesing studio residency at the Cité Internationale des Arts, Paris , he was able to live abroad in both Berlin and Paris. Whilst living abroad, Brennan wrote his second collection and first chapbook: Language Habits (chapbook), and published it in 2006 . Brennan has also co-written two poetry books. Following the release of Language Habits, Brennan collaborated with Akiko Muto, a Japanese artist, to create his second chapbook titled ‘Sky was sky’, which was a dedication to David Brennan who passed away in 1999 . Sky was sky was translated by Yasuhiro Yotsumoto, and published in 2007 . It made a second appearance in his 2008 book Unanimous Night . Brennan’s second collaborative work was an art book: Atopia, which was produced with Kay Orchison, a Sydney-based artist, and also made a reappearance in Unanimous Night . Brennan’s third individual collection, “Unanimous night” was published in 2008 by Salt Publishing, and is a continuation of “The Imageless World”, part two of a triptych of books . The two books are connected through “repeating motifs (which) thread both volumes” (McCooey, D. 2008), and share a similar structure of contents. Unanimous Night was shortlisted for the Victorian Premier’s Award for Poetry and won the William Baylebridge Award. The third book in Brennan’s triptych is titled “Autoethnographic” and was published in 2012 by Giramondo Publishing co., taking place in a dystopian future setting where “there is global warming, social breakdown, closed airports and borders, and so on” . Autoethnographic was the recipient of the Grace Leven Prize for Poetry in 2012 and was shortlisted for the Victorian Premier’s Literary award for poetry in 2014 . In a review by Dr Tamryn Bennett, writer and visual artist, on Autoethnographic, she stated “If pressed to find fault with Autoethnographic, it is that the poignancy Brennan’s observations are, at times, undercut by predictable lineation and prosaic page composition” . Brennan’s fifth individual book is titled “Alibi” and was published in 2015 by his own publishing company, the Vagabond Press . The book Alibi is alternatively available in Japanese, translated by Yasuhiro Yotsumoto, who also translated his Sky was sky chapbook . One of the poems in Alibi, titled “Who is Alibi Wednesday?”, was written as part of the Red Room Company’s 2004 project Toilet Doors Poetry, and was used alongside the work of five other Australian poets, as posters on the back of toilet doors . Another of the poems in the collection Alibi, titled “Alibi at the Start of Summer” was published in the book “The Best Australian Poems 2010” edited by Robert Adamson, the same poet whose work Brennan wrote his Thesis on, and published by Black inc. . Brennan was also featured in Pam Brown’s Fifty-one contemporary poets from Australia: Part 5. The poems featured were \\"After the circus” and “Lost Soldier” from his Language Habits chapbook, and “You Yangs 1” from Best Australian Poems 2010 . Brennan’s poetry was also featured in Lisa Gorton’s Collection of The Best Australian Poems 2013, which was published by Black inc. on the 13th of October, 2013 . In May 2016 Brennan contributed to the Chicago based Poetry Foundation’s monthly poetry collection focused on Australian poets, with his poem ‘There and Then’ . Brennan’s sixth individual book is titled “The Earth Here”, the same name of a poem featured in his Unanimous Night collection . The Earth Here was published by ASM in 2018.

Brennan has taught English literature and cultural studies at Universities in both Australia and Japan . In 2019 he resigned from his role of associate professor and lecturer at Chau University in the faculty of Policy Studies, in order to return to Sydney to focus on writing and publishing with The Vagabond Press .  Editing  Brennan has contributed as an editor to a number of texts, including Absence and Negativity, published by Halstead in 2000, Calyx: 30 Contemporary Australian Poets, published by Paper Bark Press and co-edited by Peter Minter in 2000, and Noel Rowe’s Posthumous collection: A Cool and Shaded Heart: Collected poems, published by Vagabond Press in 2008 .  Poetry International Web  Brennan has also contributed to the Poetry International Website as the Australian editor since 2004, conducting introductions , interviews and criticism . Brennan sees the Australian section of Poetry International Web “as both an online quarterly journal and as an archive of Australian poetry” and attempts to “engage the determination of 'Australia' and 'Australian poetry' in the introduction of each issue” . In regards to the Australian section of Poetry International Web, Michael Brennan has stated “I would like to keep building the site so that it becomes more inclusive, better able to show the sheer breadth of difference available in poetry stemming from Australia” In regards to the international connections made through Poetry International Web, Brennan has said “one of the most exciting aspects of the Poetry International Website, (is) the ability to move beyond the pragmatic boundaries of nation, and support engagements that might otherwise not happen” . Brennan has contributed as a critic for Australian Book Review .  Vagabond Press  Brennan first began publishing with The Vagabond Press in July, 1999. The first titles published by the Vagabond Press were two chapbooks, ‘The Dead’ written by poet David Brooks and ‘Falling Objects’ by Nick Riemer . The chapbooks were the first of the Rare Objects Series, which would grow to include over 100 different collections by 2014. All titles in the series are written by Australian poets. The concept of the Rare Objects Series is that there are only a limited number of copies of each title, with only 100 being published each time. Each copy of each title throughout the series was signed by the author, and given a number from 1-100. The Vagabond Press has stated that the series was based on “a combination of the design values of French press Fata Morgana and Neil Astley's beautiful Poetical Histories series” Brennan has stated that The Vagabond Press “started with $500 and … basically built from there” and that he looks for “shared commitment” in the authors he chooses to publishes, due to the limited resources that The Vagabond Press has to work with . In his interview with Australian Book Review for Publisher of the Month, Brennan stated “Twenty years of unpaid labour followed” the founding of the Vagabond Press . The Vagabond Press has published the work of writers from Australia, France, England and America . Work that Brennan has published with The Vagabond Press includes Kate Lilley’s award winning poetry collection Tilt, which won the Victorian Premier’s Literary Award for Poetry in 2019. In an interview with The University of Sydney, Lilley stated “My publisher, Michael Brennan, started Vagabond Press at this university and has built a wonderful list. I’m immensely grateful to him” . Other Premier’s Literary Award for Poetry winners published by The Vagabond Press include Peter Boyle’s Ghostspeaking, NSW recipient 2017, Bella Li’s Argosy, NSW and Victorian recipient 2018 and Peter Boyle’s Enfolded in the Wings of a Great Darkness, NSW recipient 2020. Whilst the home base for The Vagabond Press is in Marrickville, Sydney, Australia, Brennan spent 15 years publishing abroad in Japan, from 2004-2019 . On Brennan’s return to Sydney he planned to increase the sustainability of The Vagabond Press and “explore new trajectories, such as novellas and essays” . In 2019 The Vagabond Press held open submissions for manuscripts on their website vagabondpress.net .

With the rapid rise of international education more and more students are seeking higher education in foreign countries and many international students now consider overseas study a stepping-stone to permanent residency within a country.Gribble, C. 2008, Policy options for managing international student migration: the sending country’s perspective, Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management, Vol. 30, No. 1, pp. 25-39 The contributions that foreign students make to host nation economies, both culturally and financially has encouraged major players to implement further initiatives to facilitate the arrival and integration of overseas students, including substantial amendments to immigration and visa policies and procedures. Institutions are competing hard to attract international students at a time when immigration policies in leading destinations like the US and the UK are not enabling transition to work visas.  History  During the colonial period, the majority of student flow came from colonies to the world capitals. Imperial governments provided pathways for selected nationals to pursue higher education. The concept of studying abroad was based on the assumption that graduates would return to their homeland to serve colonial administration once they had developed skills and absorbed the values of the colonial rulers.Varghese, N.V. 2008, 'Globalization of higher education and cross-border student mobility', International Institute for Educational Planning, UNESCO The Cold War era had a significant impact on foreign aid and the funding of overseas students. The policy of distributing scientific knowledge and sharing industrial progress with the developing world required the help of higher education institutions. Support for USAID linked the foreign policy mission with support to higher education. Cold war rivals funded study abroad programmes and were in competition to attract students from the developing world. One of the most famous international exchange programmes that facilitates and encourages international student migration is the Fulbright Program. Established in 1946, the Fulbright Program provides grants for students, scholars, teachers and professionals to undertake studies and research. The Fulbright Program was initially funded by using proceeds from the sales of surplus war property and was founded on the principal of promoting \\"international good will through the exchange of students in the fields of education, culture and science\\".U.S. Department of State: Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, Fulbright International Educational Exchange Program, , viewed on 14 October 2010 The Colombo Plan was another program that encouraged the movement of students between countries. The Colombo Plan was established in 1951 with the intention of strengthening economic and social development of the Asia Pacific region. The Colombo Plan has been responsible for sponsoring over 40,000 Asian students to study or train in Australian higher education institutions. Funding is provided by member countries, which includes a mixture of 26 Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth countries.Colombo Plan Organisation, , viewed on 13 October 2010 Since the colonial and Cold War eras, the profile of international students has made a significant shift. The way in which students travel has changed, and the majority of students seeking education abroad are now self-funded.  Financing and cost  The international student market has become an important source of revenue for local economies and many institutions rely heavily on the income brought by cross-border students. Receiving countries could benefit from qualified skilled migrants who make considerable contributions to their new countries. International students are also demanding more \\"value for money\\" as finding job opportunities abroad is becoming more difficult. In most host countries, higher education was tuition fee-free. Until the 1980s, many countries had not any provision for levying fees on domestic and international students. The UK was the first to introduce fees on overseas students; other countries, such as Australia, began to follow suit. The international market for students now accounts for billions of dollars and, subsequently, competition between institutions is fierce. Studying abroad is expensive and in most cases is funded by the individual. In OECD countries there are three patterns to the levying of fees: # In some countries fees for international students are higher than domestic students. This occurs in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the USA. Sweden started levying fees for non-European students from 2011. # Some countries make no distinction between international and domestic student fees. Tuition fees remain the same for foreign and domestic students in France, Greece, Hungary, Italy and Japan. # Countries such as Denmark, Finland and Norway have not begun levying tuition fees from foreign students.  Destination countries  Between 1963 and 2006 the number of students studying in a foreign country increased 9 times. In 2006 there were 2.7 million students studying abroad and there are predictions that the demand for cross-border education will increase to 7.2 million by 2025. OECD countries receive approximately 85% of the world’s foreign students with the majority concentrated in just 6 countries. In 2007, the United States accounted for 21.4% of foreign enrolments, the United Kingdom 12.6%, France 8.8%, Australia 7.6%, Germany 7.4%, and Japan 4.5%.UNESCO Institute of Statistics, 2009, Global Education Digest: Comparing Education Statistics around the world, pp. 45-49 Australia has the highest ratio of international students per head of population in the world by a large margin, with 812,000 international students enrolled in the nation's universities and vocational institutions in 2019.https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/property/booming-student- market-a-valuable-property/news- story/6bb3823260aa3443f0c26909406d089bhttps://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2019/11/australian- universities-double-down-on-international-students/ Accordingly, in 2019, international students represented on average 26.7% of the student bodies of Australian universities. International education therefore represents one of the country's largest exports and has a pronounced influence on the country's demographics, with a significant proportion of international students remaining in Australia after graduation on various skill and employment visas.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-27/temporary-graduate- visa-485-boom/10035390 Europe is also a major destination, with approximately 840,000 international students. However the majority of this figure comes from students moving from one European country to another. East Asia and the Pacific top the list for sending students and accounts for 29% of all international higher education students. (Students from China account for 15% of this total.) North America and Western Europe account for 18%, then Central and East Europe 11%, South and West Asia 9%, Arab States 7% and Sub Saharan Africa 5.8%.  Contributing factors to growth in student migration  There are many factors contributing to the growing numbers of student migration. Many developing countries have an under supply of university places to satisfy demand and as a result students have no other choice but to study abroad. In addition to this it is a common expectation that studying overseas can enhance professional business opportunities. Generally, students seeking cross-border education migrate to countries with more developed education institutions than their own. For example, students in Arab countries migrate to Egypt and Jordan to pursue their studies, and many students from Bangladesh and Nepal travel to India. The flow of students from developing countries to developed countries is often due to the belief that the quality and standards of education offered in OECD countries is superior to what is offered in the country of origin. Higher education has become a major global export commodity with developing countries capitalising on domestic shortages by recruiting foreign students. Subsequently, changes to visa and immigration policies have provided incentives for students to travel abroad and potentially offer a gateway to permanent residency within a host nation. Migration opportunities are one of the major contributions to the growth of student migration. A 2006 survey, undertaken by Australia’s Monash University, produced statistics which showed 75% of Indian students who completed university education in Australia applied for and were granted residency. The author of the research, Michiel Bass suggests that the most influential reason Indian students studied in Australia was not because of academic reputation, but the opportunity to gain permanent residency.Verbik, L., Lasanowski, V. 2007, International Student Mobility: Patterns & Trends, The Observatory on Borderless Higher Education, Association of Commonwealth Universities & Universities UK An important factor contributing to student migration is the desire to study in a language other than the student's first language. For example, a growth in the number of students travelling to study in the UK from Central and Eastern Europe has been partially attributed to the wish \\"to study in a higher education environment where communication is in English\\".https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269872663_Developing_Writing_Skills_for_International_Students_Adopting_a_critical_pragmatic_approach Other factors for the rise in student migration include lowering travel expenses and greater communication technology which has made studying abroad more accessible.  Student visa and immigration policies = United States  The US attracts a large number of foreigners to its workforce each year, however international graduates of US institutions do not automatically have the right to remain in the country for work purposes upon completion of their course. In fact, as part of the student application process, applicants must state that they are not planning to emigrate to the US. Visa and immigration policies in the US are (arguably) significantly less accommodating towards international students and graduates compared to other host countries. The greatest changes to visa regulations occurred after the attacks of September 11, 2001, when the US immediately implemented tougher visa and immigration requirements. Under the Enhanced Border Security and Visas Entry Reform Act (2002) the US introduced a new overseas student tax in order to fund an advanced computer tracking system for visa applications, but also made it more difficult for applicants to transfer between visa categories. However, recently the US Department of State has established a new internship scheme which has been specifically designed for foreign students. Since July 2007, certain international students are eligible to participate in a year-long internship per degree level for practical training as long as they can describe how the experience can enhance their education.  United Kingdom  In 2006, as part of a larger scheme to attract highly skilled labour, the UK government made amendments to the Science and Engineering Graduate Scheme (SEGS) which enabled all international students who have completed a post- graduate degree course (Master’s of PhD starting after 1 May 2006) to remain in the UK and seek employment for up to 12 months regardless of discipline. The Government has also made a special provision for internationally coveted Master of Business Administration (MBA) students, allowing graduates of 50 highly ranked business schools to apply for a three-year extension to their one-year working visa once their studies have been completed. As part of the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP), such students have been eligible to apply for permanent residence since 12 April 2005. The Government further extended opportunities for non EU/EEA students in 2007, which allows all students who have completed degree programmes in the UK the opportunity to stay in the UK for employment purposes. The International Graduates Scheme has been in operation since 1 May 2007. However, in March 2011, the UK Government made an announcement on reforming student visa system, which is getting much stricter The major changes in student immigration policies including tougher requirements for entrance, tightening work entitlements and closing the post- study work route are aimed at ensuring the UK welcomes the best overseas students with expected contribution.  Germany and France  Since January 2005, Germany has issued singular permits for both residence and employment in an effort to attract international students and skilled migrants to the country and facilitate their arrival. Overseas students are also eligible to apply for an extension on their residence permit for up to one year for the purpose of seeking employment which is relevant to their field of study upon completion of their studies. In France, international students have the right to work part-time for up to 19 hours per week whilst studying. Students must, however, have a valid residency permit and be enrolled in an institution which participates in the French social protection system. Upon completion of studies, students are able to accept offers of employment from French firms by applying for temporary employment authorization. It ought to be noted that both Germany and France belongs to the Schengen agreement.  Australia  In addition to Australia's points system, which encourages skilled migration, regulations allow all international students completing an Australian degree to remain in the country for 18 months upon graduating. Students can earn bonus points for skilled work experience and English-language proficiency in addition to those already earned for Australian qualifications, under amendments to the General Skilled Migration Programme (GSM). Previously, international students were exempt from work experience requirements when applying for general skilled migration. Legislation introduced on September 1, 2007 requires authorities to provide 'temporary visas' to enable applicants to earn experience. These changes were made to strengthen links between study, work experience and employment to ensure migrants have the skills that Australian employers are looking for. The main rationale behind these schemes is the desire for Australia to benefit from the skills of foreign graduates. Students no longer have the option to remain in Australia following the completion of a master's degree for the purposes of work. It is now necessary to re-apply under specific sponsorship.  Canada  International students travelling to Canada are not required to apply for a study visa unless the programmes they are enrolled in are longer than 6 months. Acquiring a study permit, does however have significant benefits to students, giving them permission to seek part-time employment on campus and since April 2006, off campus, for up to 20 hours per week whilst they are completing their studies. Under the Post-Graduation Work Permit Programmes, international graduates from Canadian higher education institutions are eligible to apply for employment of up to two years. In 2008, 105 780 study permits applied for from outside Canada were processed, and in 22% of those cases a study permit was refused. Refusal rates varied by region, with 11% of applicants from Europe refused and 35% from Africa and the Middle East refused.Evaluation of the International Student Program: Findings Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada Accessed 27 February 2014  New Zealand  In New Zealand, international students are not required to apply for a student visa if they are studying for a course which is less than three months in duration. Under certain circumstances international students can seek part-time employment for up to 20 hours per week whilst studying (full-time) in a course that at least 6 months in duration. In July 2007, amendments were made to the Skilled Migrant Category which gives students the opportunity to earn bonus points for recognized New Zealand higher education qualifications or for two years of full-time study in the country. In addition, the number of years to require points for work experience in New Zealand will be reduced and international students may be eligible to apply for a work visa for up to two year upon completion of their studies in the country.  Issues that can arise with student migration  The loss of students from sending countries can have a rather detrimental impact on the economy by depleting already scarce resources. Brain drain is the large scale loss of individuals with technical skills or knowledge. Differences in learning cultures is an issue in student migration. This means that the students can have difficulty if the teaching, learning and assessment methods are very different from those in their previous education. For example, some European students studying in Britain have been noted as having little experience of a number of tasks typically expected of British students while many are familiar \\"with only traditional forms of assessment such as examinations\\".

The bank's headquarters were located in central Berlin in a building nicknamed the Red Castle (German: Rotes Schloß). Originally under Jewish ownership, the bank began the process of Aryanization in 1933, which Richard Lenz and Robert Kraus becoming the majority stakeholders.Museums online portal. Founding The Jacquier and Securius Bank was founded on August 11, 1817 by Friedrich Wilhelm Jacquier and John August Securius. Jacquier and Securius had previously worked together at the Huguenot banking firm L. Guillemot and F.W. Jacquier, serving as senior partner and treasurer respectively. Initially, the bank's main clients were small and medium-sized businesses whose money was invested in fixed income securities. Yet by the turn of the century, the bank had diversified by investing in industrial businesses. The golden years (1878-1933)=Three \\"self-made\\" men In 1872, Hermann Frenkel became senior manager of the Berlin Commercial and Exchange Bank, a subsidiary bank under the Jacquier and Securius umbrella. When this offshoot bank was liquidated on July 1, 1878, Frenkel, along with certain other members of staff, was absorbed into Jacquier and Securius. Frenkel rose quickly; at the age of 28, he became one of the bank's three partners. By 1902, he had emerged as the bank's leading figure; Jacquier's involvement had faded as he aged, and Securius had long since ceded his share of the bank's assets to a close friend, Sigismund Samuel. In November 1902, Frenkel bought out his partners with a capital investment equalling some 900,000 German gold marks. Within the next year, Frenkel took on two junior partners - Albert Pinkuss and Eugene Panofsky. Pinkuss, Frenkel's brother-in-law, was a pioneer of German soft-coal mining with an estimated fortune of 8,100,000 marks. Panofsky, on the other hand, started as a cashier at Jacquier and Securius in 1875. He was, however, politically active, and sat on the boards of a number of municipal committees. Impressed with his political clout, \\"Frenkel realised... his value as a potential partner and quickly promoted him.\\" Keeping it in the family Arthur Frenkel, the eldest son of Hermann Frenkel, became a partner in 1918. A year later, together with his father and Eugene Panofsky, his brother Erich and family friend Max Landesmann were admitted as partners. In 1924, Alfred Panofsky assumed his father's position in the bank. After six years of middling success, in December 1925, Arthur Frenkel ceded his profit share to his younger and more talented brother, Erich. The involvement of Friedrich Minoux Friedrich Minoux In 1923 Friedrich Minoux, one of the most enigmatic figures of the Weimar period, invested one million German gold marks to become a partner of Jacquier and Securius in order to secure liquidity for his various business interests. \\"This sum comprised a quarter of the bank's capital.\\" During his time as partner of the bank, Minoux took part in a 150 million German gold mark project to build canals in Constantinople. In addition, a consortium of other banks led by Minoux, Jacquier and Securius secured a \\"majority of stock in cigarette maker August Batscharis. On January 31st 1931, Minoux sold his stake in Jacquier and Securius, yet he retained his offices within the bank's headquarters. Events following Machtergreifung (1933-1938)=Gleichschaltung Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933 precipitated serious political, economic and social changes within Germany. The ensuing process of Gleichschaltung (English: Bringing into line) entailed systematic social and economic discrimination against Germany's Jewish population. However, the need to maintain a sound banking system meant that the partners of Jacquier and Securius were not subject to serious discrimination until the mid-1930s. That said, even the 'reasonable' conditions required by Gleichschaltung were enough to convince Erich Frenkel that he \\"had no future in Germany.\\" ='Aryan' partners= In the summer of 1933, Jacquier and Securius was coerced into taking on a new partner by the incumbent government. Gerhard Ueltzen became the bank's newest partner, though, according to all accounts, he \\"turned out to be not very reliable.\\" Max Landesmann, who had had an interest in the banking house since 1919, was told to leave the company; Alfred Panofsky, the son of former partner Eugene Panofsky, was blocked from management for some months. Furthermore, the Reichsbank demanded that another 'Aryan' partner be integrated into the bank. However, this time the Jewish bankers were allowed to select this new partner themselves. The man chosen was Robert Kraus. The process of Aryanisation (1938) Since the beginning of 1937, the remaining bankers had been trying to sell Jacquier and Securius, but had been unable to do so. Alfred Panofsky's intention had been to liquidate the banking house and emigrate. Finally, a deal was reached with Robert Kraus, one of the current partners, and Richard Lenz. Lenz had prospered hugely in the five years following Hitler's takeover of power. He was a member of the Nazi Party and had used his connections with Friedrich Reinhart, the President of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce and Industry and avid supporter of authoritarian government, to develop Richard Lenz and Co. into a prosperous business. Alfred Panofsky and Co. in Liquidation On March 1, 1938, Richard Lenz and Robert Kraus took over accounts receivable and payable for 3,600,000 Reichmarks (RM) and the name of the formerly Jewish banking house. The bank itself, for all intents and purposes fully Aryanised, changed its name to Alfred Panofsky and Co. in Liquidation. =Operations under Richard Lenz and Robert Kraus= The new Jacquier and Securius desperately needed start-up capital to stay afloat in the short term. This was provided in part by Deutsche Bank which contributed one million RM in a silent investment. Another half a million RM came from the pockets of Richard Lenz, himself. Negotiations on behalf of Deutsche Bank were conducted by Hermann Josef Abs and Eduard Mosler. The state participated through the Reich's Commissioner for lending, Friedrich Ernst. Richard Lenz wasted little time in taking advantage of the situation. Over the next year he bought out five other small Jewish banks under the name of Jacquier and Securius. Unfortunately for Lenz and Kraus, the vast majority of the acquired clients were also Jewish. As Nazi Germany's anti-Semitism continued and grew, even the bank's most wealthy clients faced impoverishment. By 1938, a third of the original equity in Jacquier and Securius had been lost. In 1945, the business was shut down, and Deutsche Bank was repaid through release of equity capital. =Harbouring Jews?= From 1938 onwards, at least five Jewish employees worked for Jacquier and Securius under its 'aryan' ownership. One of them was 'in disguise' until 1943 - well into World War II. This harbouring of Jewish people on Lenz and Kraus' behalf brought with it the significant danger of being pilloried as a sympathizer. Compensation claims Almost immediately after the Second World War ended, legal proceeding between Lenz's heirs and the heirs of the Jewish bankers began. Eventually, in 1964, a settlement was reached where Lenz's heirs paid 35,000 DM in compensation to the various families. After the reunification of East and West Germany, the heirs of Lenz and Kraus fought over a 100,000 DM payment that Kraus made back to the bank in 1941. Far more substantial claims than these are those relating to the private property of the three Jewish banking families. Of particular interest is compensation for the physical estate of Hermann Frenkel, and a pair of paintings (one a Murillo, and one an Adriaen van de Velde) that were said to be stored in the bank's headquarters at Rotes Schloss.

The two women firmly refused the mediation efforts of the conductor of the Paris Opera orchestra Jean-Baptiste Rey who had turned up at the scene of the duel. They eventually got back the pistols he had taken over and laid down on the grass, and would begin the fight. The pistols however had got moist with dew and misfired, whereupon the two ladies decided to bury their differences by throwing their arms around each other's neck.Campardon, pp. 54–55. Mlle Beaumesnil wrote music from time to time and was the third woman to have a composition of hers performed at the Paris Opéra.According to the website Dolmetsch online Beaumesnil was \\"the second woman to have her compositions performed at the Opéra, Paris\\" (). Indeed, the Académie Royale de Musique had previously staged works by at least two other women composers: the tragédie-lyrique Céphale et Procris by Élisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre, in 1694, and the opéra-ballet Les Génies by Mlle Duval in 1736. Anacréon, her first opera, was not accepted and just received a private performance at the Brunoy residence of the Count of Provence in 1781. In 1784, however, she set again to music the librettoWords by Louis Fuzelier. of the third entrée of Colin de Blamont's Les festes grecques et romaines, under the title of Tibulle et Délie, and her composition was successfully given at the Paris Opera to serve as a companion piece for Gluck's Iphigénie en Aulide on 15 March 1784.Cook; Pitou. The acte de ballet had been already premiered at court in February 1784 (Campardon p. 53). In 1792, her two-act opéra comique, Plaire, c'est commander was mounted at the Théâtre Montansier. She died in Paris in 1813.

The Act enabled the British Government to sell shares in Royal Mail to private investors and includes the possible mutualisation of the Post Office. The Act allows private buyers to own up to 90% of Royal Mail, with Royal Mail staff being offered at least 10% of the shares of the company. It enabled the Post Office business to be separated from Royal Mail, to allow it to remain in government ownership or to be mutualised. It provided for the government to take over the assets and liabilities of the Royal Mail pension scheme, which had a considerable deficit. It allowed for the transfer of regulatory responsibility from Postcomm to the communications regulator Ofcom. The Act also wrote into law the requirement for Royal Mail to maintain a six day a week universal service. During its passage through the House of Commons, the government added an amendment to include a guarantee that a silhouette or portrait of The Queen's head would remain on British postage stamps even if the Royal Mail were to be taken into foreign ownership. Following this stage it was considered by the House of Lords, and the government added further amendments to safeguard the universal service.

It is situated on the northern shore of Norton Sound, to the east of Nome also on Norton Sound. It is delimited by the Norton Sound to the south, Hastings Creek on the west, a lagoon on the east and an estuary formed by the Flambeau River and the Eldorado River. From the sea shore, Cape Nome extends inland by about , connected by road with Nome. Etymology Named Tolstoi ( \\"blunt\\" or \\"broad\\") by Mikhail Tebenkov (1833), it was named Sredul (\\"middle\\") on an 1852 Russian Hydrographic Service chart, with Tolstoi added as a synonym. The name Nome, used by Henry Kellett in 1849, first appears on British Admiralty charts after the John Franklin search expeditions. In 1901, Sir William Wharton wrote: \\"The name Cape Nome, which is off the entrance to Norton bay, first appears on our charts from an original of Kellett in 1849. I suppose the town gets its name from the same source, but what that is we have nothing to show.\\" Another interpretation, by the geographer George Davidson, is that a draftsman may have misinterpreted the notation \\"? Name\\" as \\"C. Nome\\". History Cape Nome roadhouse, 1901 Cape Nome is located to the south east of the Bering Strait. The western extension of the North America and the eastern extension of Asia are separated by the waters of the strait. It is reported that a bridge connected the two parts some years back and that the people of the two regions interacted and trading contacts existed during the start of the Christian era. In 1791 and 1861, Commodore Joseph Billings and Otto van Koztebue carried out explorations close to Cape Nome. A trading post was established at St. Michael along a sea route of from Cape Nome and by a land route of . Prior to the discovery of gold at Cape Nome, a mission had been established for a number of years at the cape where one of the Government reindeer herds was maintained. Placer gold was discovered on Snake River in 1898 by a party which started from Golovnin Bay to prospect the gravels of Sinuk River. A rush to the region took place immediately after the news reached the miners about Golovnin Bay, and on October 18, the Cape Nome mining precinct was formed. An Eskimo village with a population of 80 was named in the cape. It was given the name as Ayacheruk in the text while the map spelled it as Aiacheruk. Geography Sketch map of Nome, Alaska region showing the first, second and third beach lines, also creeks and railroad Cape Nome is a blunt, rocky headland on Seward Peninsula. The shore line between Cape Nome and Topkok is marked by large lagoons. West of Cape Nome, the shoreline, as far as Cape Rodney, is almost straight and uninterrupted except for the tidal inlets at the mouths of the larger rivers. Near the coast between Sinuk River and the flat-topped promontory of Cape Nome is a well-marked bench at an altitude of about . The shore line may formerly have extended from the hills west of Cripple River to Cape Nome, and probably formed a broad arc of fairly uniform curvature, like the present beach, but with smaller radius. The elevation of the depression between Cape Nome and Army Peak is . Bed rock is traced northwestward from Cape Nome for a distance of nearly , and in the low rounded hill between Hastings and Saunders creeks has an elevation of . Between this point and the Army Peak schist mass, still farther to the northwest, is an interval of about across a broad, low saddle where no rocks are exposed. The Nome tundra gravels occupy the crescent-shaped lowland extending from Cape Nome to the hills west of Cripple River. The coastal plain or tundra gravel occupies the crescent-shaped area included between the sea and the hills and extending from Cape Nome to Rodney Creek, west of the mouth of Snake River. Lagoons shut off from the sea by sand bars may be seen east of Cape Nome. Demographics Cape Nome first appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as the unincorporated Inuit village of \\"Ayacheruk\\" (with alternative spellings of Ahyoksekawik and Aiacheruk). All 60 residents were Inuit.http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1880a_v1-17.pdf In 1890, it returned as Cape Nome including the native villages of Ahyoksekawik (Ayacheruk) & Kogluk. All 41 residents were native.http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1890a_v8-01.pdf It did not appear again on the census. Geology Heavy mineral sand composed mainly of garnet crystals collected from Cape Nome. The granite formations of the Cape Nome and the greenstone formations which occur in the form of dykes and sills that intrude into the limestone and schist formations of the Nome, are interpreted as an intrusive form of green stone only. However, Cape Nome represents a large geological formation of granites seen in the seaward face of the Cape. It also has intrusions of green stone and porphyritic rocks with feldspar crystals. Allanite, epidote, secondary minerals like chlorite and albite are also discerned. Minor quartz fillings are noticed in feldspar crystals. The Metamorphosis process, which has resulted in the biotite formation attaining a fine grained status that gives the appearance of a banded gneissic structure. The feldspar crystals found in the granite, generally of 1 to.1.5 inches diameter, have intruded into both granitic and gneissic formations. The seaward face of Cape Nome is part of the Nome quadrangle, and is spread over an area of 3.75 square miles (9.7 km2), along a boundary contact zone noted here. Another feature recorded during field on observations is that granite has become the feldspathic schist near the boundary on the northern side of the cape. A microscopic examination of the samples of feldspar intrusions in granite of the Cape have indicated that the large crystals of orthoclase feldspar have principal minerals of quartz, orthoclase, microcline, albite, epidote, and biotite. Establishing the age of the granite formations of Cape Nome and its geological link with the granites of Kigluaik Mountains has not been possible, due to the fact that the intrusions took place over eons. In 1947, a field party of the Geological Survey carried out a brief study of the area to ascertain and confirm the earlier claims (a 1946 tracer study) of finding allanite and also radioactive minerals in the Cape Nome granites. The study was conducted as the Cape Nome area was easily accessible on the Seaward Peninsula. The studies in 1947 did not confirm the presence of allanite or radioactive mineral in the granites.  Archaeological studies Archaeological excavations have been carried out, during 1970–76 seasons, at Cape Nome, which has established that more than one cultural phase existed here. 300 pits were excavated to find the archaeological background to the Late Norton and Early Norton phase of civilization in the cape area, which is interpreted as representing the Pre- Birnirk culture, termed as the Cape Nome Phase.

Bombs were planted in or near various McDonald's restaurant franchises in Taiwan. The bombings – part of an extortion attempt – caused the death of a policeman and injuries to four civilians, including two young children, and resulted in the temporary closure of the entire McDonald's chain in Taiwan. Two people were subsequently convicted of involvement in the bombings, with the bomber themselves being sentenced to life imprisonment. Bombings The first bomb exploded at a restaurant in Taipei on the afternoon of April 28, 1992. A device had been located in the male toilets in the restaurant and the bomb squad were in attendance at the time. The bomb went off as it was either being removed from the restaurant or as an attempt was being made to diffuse it in situ. The resulting explosion killed one bomb squad officer. Later that day another bomb exploded in a telephone booth outside a McDonald's in Kaohsiung in the south of the country. The devices were found to have been triggered by mercury tilt switches. That evening, police found a soft-drink bottle in a Taipei parking lot containing an anonymous letter demanding $240,000 from McDonald's and stating that six bombs would be planted at McDonald's restaurants. Another device was found nearby. On 29 April another bomb detonated in the Taipei suburb of Yonghe. The device had again been found in the men's room and detonated as it was being examined by the restaurant manager, leaving them in a critical condition and hospitalising another employee. Flying glass from the explosion also injured two children. Response At 4pm on Wednesday 29 February, Taiwan McDonald's Corp announced the indefinite closure of all 57 of its restaurants and offered a $480,000 reward for assistance in finding those responsible for the bombings. The firm also said that it was working closely with police to improve security at its restaurants after which they would reopen. A total reward of $880,000 was made available. McDonald's began reopening its restaurants in Taiwan on 3 March. Initially only nine branches reopened. The reopened restaurants featured enhanced security measures including CCTV cameras, metal detectors and searches of patrons by security guards. Convictions On May 16, Chen Hsi- Hsieh, a plumber, and Pan Che-Ming were arrested and charged with murder and extortion by the local prosecutor, who demanded the death penalty for both. Chen was convicted of murder and extortion and sentenced to life in prison by a Taipei District Court on 25 November 1992. His accomplice Pan was sentenced to 15 years and 6 months for providing the explosives and harboring Chen. The presiding judge explained that they had not used the death penalty as they did not believe that Chen and Pan really intended to kill, demonstrated by them leaving a note for police explaining how to defuse the devices.

Background Early in 1978, discussions were commenced on possible electrification of the Blackwater and Goonyella coal networks. This was due to an expected increase in coal traffic across the networks, ageing diesel-electric locomotive fleet and the increase in diesel fuel costs. By early 1983, a decision had been made to electrify the networks and by early 1984 contracts were already starting to be let for the new locomotives and other works for the project. The decision was made to electrify with the 25 kV AC railway electrification system as used in the Brisbane suburban network. This would allow future connection of the Brisbane network with the coal networks via the North Coast line. Electrification project The project was to be carried out in four stages: Stage 1 Electrification of the main line from Gladstone to Rockhampton, including parts of Rockhampton marshalling yard, then west to Blackwater and the coal mines in the area. This was a total of 720 kilometres of track. Stage 2 Electrification of the coal lines south of Dalrymple Bay and Hay Point, then west through the Goonyella system, south-west to Blair Athol and south to Gregory – linking the Goonyella system to the Blackwater system. This was a total of 773 kilometres of track. Stage 3 Electrification of the main western line from Burngrove to Emerald. This would allow electric freight from Rockhampton to Emerald. Stage 4 Electrification of the line from Newlands coal mine to Collinsville and north-east to Abbott Point. This stage never went ahead. In 1986 it was decided to electrify the North Coast line between Brisbane and Gladstone instead and this became known as Stage 4. Locomotive contracts In July 1984 Comeng were awarded a contract for 76 3100/3200 class locomotives. and a Clyde Engineering/ASEA-Walkers Limited joint venture, a contract for 70 3500/3600 class locomotives. 3100/3200 Class 3102 & 3255 on the Goonyella line in 1991 32 class locomotives and the Locotrol wagon situated mid-train on a loaded coal train on the Goonyella line in 1991 3136 in Bicentennial livery on the Goonyella line in 1991 Comeng built two classes of locomotive, the 3100 class were fitted with radio equipment to remotely control other locomotives unlike the 3200 class. Design of the electrical equipment was by General Electric and Hitachi, with the bodies being built and assembled at Comeng's Brisbane factory.Comeng/Hitachi 3100/3200 Class Queensland's Railways Interests Group The first locomotive, 3101 Sir Joh Bjelke-Peterson, was delivered on 26 May 1986. This locomotive underwent extensive testing in the Brisbane area before heading north to the Gladstone area for further testing in conjunction with 3500/3600 class locomotives. Bodies Bodies of these locomotives differed from QR's diesel-electric locomotives which have only one driving cab whereas the electric had driver cab at each end. Each locomotive had an internal walkway connecting each cab. Bodies were the full width with no external walkway. The colour scheme was orange on either end, predominately white sides and green trim. Bogies Bogies for the new locomotives were of Bo-Bo-Bo wheel arrangement. This differed from the diesel-electrics of the day which had Co- Co wheel arrangement. This three bogie, two axle, arrangement gave better weight distribution of the much heavier locomotives as well as better tractive effort and wheel flange wear. Traction motors Traction for the locomotives is from six DC traction motors. Each motor is axle mounted. Power for the traction motors comes from the 25 kV overhead line via the roof mounted pantograph through a step down transformer and through the power control equipment to the traction motors. After the stepping down of the voltage the AC power is converted to DC by a bridge rectifier for use by the traction motors. The power for each motor is rated at 500 kW whereas those of QR's most powerful diesel-electric locomotives were only rated at 275 kW. Control gear Control of the locomotives made extensive use of silicon chip technology. Although some relays were used in the locomotives, extensive use of microprocessor technology was made. One of the stipulations for both contractors was that all locomotives from each contractor must be able to be used in any configuration. This meant that 3100/3200 class locomotives could be on the same train as 3500/3600 class locomotives. Brakes The 3100/3200 class were fitted with Davies & Metcalfe's P85 brake system. The locomotives are also fitted with Cutler-Hammer dynamic braking system. Facilities for train crew There were several improvements over the old diesel locomotives for driver comforts. These included on board toilets, equipment for traincrew preparing a hot meal whilst on board and air- conditioning for improved driver comfort. 3500/3600 Class 3508 and another haul an eastbound coal train on the Blackwater line in 1993. 3524 in November 2008. Walkers Limited built two classes of locomotive: the 3500 class were fitted with radio equipment to remotely control other locomotives unlike the other type, the 3600 class. The first locomotive, 3501 DF Lane, was delivered on 29 May 1986. This locomotive underwent extensive testing in the Brisbane area before heading north to the Gladstone area for further testing in conjunction with 3100/3200 class locomotives.Walkers/ABB 3500/3600 Class Queensland's Railways Interest Group Bodies The external side walls were manufactured from high grade stainless steel unlike the 3100 class that were painted steel. The roof hatches on these locomotives were made from aluminium. The overall colour scheme for the 3500 class matched the 3100 class with orange fronts, green side trims and high polished stainless steel sides. Body length was 19.38 metres Bogies 3500 bogies were again a Bo-Bo-Bo wheel arrangement which achieved a higher tractive effort whilst ensuring better weight distribution and less wheel flange wear. Traction motors As with the 3100's the traction for the locomotives is from six DC traction motors. Each motor is axle mounted. Power for the traction motors comes from the 25 kV overhead line via the roof mounted pantograph through a step down transformer and through the power control equipment to the traction motors. After the stepping down of the voltage the AC power is converted to DC by a rectifier bridge for use by the traction motors. Control gear Control of the locomotives made extensive use of silicon chip technology. Although some relays were used in the locomotives, extensive use of microprocessor technology was made. One of the stipulations for both contractors was that all locomotives from each contractor must be able to be used in any configuration. This meant that 3100/3200 class locomotives could be on the same train as 3500/3600 class locomotives. These locomotives made use of a thyristor control system that had been developed by ASEA for use in their European locomotives. Brakes The 3500/3600 class were fitted with Davies & Metcalfe's P85 brake system. The locomotives are also fitted with Cutler-Hammer dynamic braking system. Facilities for traincrew There were several improvements over the old diesel locomotives for driver comforts. These included on board toilets, equipment for traincrew preparing a hot meal whilst on board and air- conditioning for improved driver comfort. 3300/3400 Class In 1994 the Clyde/Hitachi 3300/3400 classes were introduced. These Bo-Bo-Bo locomotives generate 3000 kW (4020HP). The 3300s are command locos while the 3400s are slave/remote locos.Clyde/Hitachi 3300/3400 Class Queensland's Railways Interest Group 3900 Class 3903 hauling a special train crosses the Nogoa River bridge, east of Emerald in September 1989 Queensland Rail decided that the last thirty 3600 class locomotives would be used on passenger and general freight work and thus were built with gearing allowing for a higher top end speed as the 3900 class.Walkers/ABB 3900 Class Queensland's Railways Interest Group In 2003 a contract was awarded to Downer EDI to rebuild 18 as the 3550 class for coal line operation.QR expands coal business Railway Gazette 1 April 2003 Because these locomotives were designed for freight and not coal traffic a different gear ratio was used. This enabled higher speeds for the freight traffic. Refurbishment of existing rolling stock=3550 Class These locomotives were rebuilt by Downer EDI, Maryborough from 3900 class locomotives for operation on coal lines. 3700 Class 3701 in November 2008 By the late 1990s discussions were underway to find possible solutions to issue of the ageing electric locomotive fleet. After considerable consultation with industry leaders and manufactures, it was decided to rebuild the existing fleet as well as buy new locomotives. The 3100/3200 class were to be completely rebuilt from the ground with only the original bodies being used in the new locomotives.United Group Rail/Siemens 3700 Class Queensland's Railways Interest Group In March 2003, a contract was awarded to Siemens for the rebuilding of three 3200 class locomotives as prototypes for a proposed rebuild of the entire class.Siemens wins QR locomotive contract Rail Express 10 March 2003 The work was undertaken at United Group, Townsville. Deemed a success, it was decided to rebuild the rest of the class at United Group's Townsville and Broadmeadow factories. The weight and dimensions of the 3100 class meant that they had to have components removed at the Jilalan Depot, Mackay before they could be moved by rail to Townsville. These components were used both for spare parts for the rest of the 3100/3200 class and to allow a reduction in weight to comply with mainline track gauge restrictions. At Townsville the locomotives were stripped down to the body shell with all internal components removed. The bodies were then sandblasted and any minor defects were repaired. They were rebuilt with only one cab, with the redundant cab enclosed with steel plating. Bodies were then transported by road to Broadmeadow for rebuilding. There are several major changes to the locomotives. These include now using AC traction motors, distributed power locotrol system instead of Locotrol II, increased weight and increased traction effort. With the increased tractive effort, the number of locomotives on each train has decreased from five to three locomotives on the Goonyella network. This gives a 60% increase in available locomotives to network operations without increasing the number of locomotives in the fleet. Purchase of new locomotives 3811 in November 2008. 3800 class After consultation with the coal industry it was decided that there was not enough locomotive power available for the expected upturn in the coal industry. As a result, it was decided to purchase more locomotives for use on the Goonyella network. German company Siemens Mobility was awarded a contract for 20 3800 class locomotives.Another success in Australia: Siemens locomotives for Queensland Rail Siemens 7 April 2006 In August 2007, the order was increased to 45.New electric locomotives for Queensland Rail Logistics & Material Handling 11 October 20073800 Class Railpage These single ended locomotives were designed and built in Germany.

Lettice Knollys was her eldest sister. Elizabeth married Sir Thomas Leighton of Feckenham in Worcestershire in 1578. He served as Governor of Jersey and Guernsey. She is sometimes mistakenly referred to in documents as \\"Cecilia\\", which was the name of her youngest sister. p. 10 Family and early years Elizabeth Knollys was born on 15 June 1549, the second daughter and one of the 15 children of Sir Francis Knollys and Catherine Carey, the daughter of William Carey and Mary Boleyn. This made Elizabeth the grand-niece of Queen Anne Boleyn, second wife of Henry VIII. She had 11 surviving siblings, the eldest of whom, Lettice Knollys, would later be banished from court after secretly marrying Queen Elizabeth's favourite, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. She was brought up in a staunchly Protestant household at Greys Court at Rotherfield Greys in Oxfordshire and Abbey House at Reading in Berkshire. In 1556, three years after the Catholic Princess Mary Tudor had become queen, Sir Francis Knollys and his wife were compelled to seek refuge in Frankfurt, Germany to escape the relentless Marian persecutions against known Protestants. It is not known if Elizabeth accompanied them as her parents took only five of their children abroad, leaving the others behind in England. Knollys went to court as a Maid of Honour to Queen Elizabeth shortly after the latter ascended the English throne in 1558. Her mother was Chief Lady of the Bedchamber and her sister Lettice was a Maid of the Privy Chamber. Another sister, Anne would later join the royal court. On 5 January 1566, Elizabeth Knollys was appointed a Gentlewoman of the Privy Chamber receiving an annual salary of £33 6s 8d. Marriage Elizabeth Knollys married Sir Thomas Leighton of Feckenham, Worcestershire, son of John Leighton of Wattlesborough in Shropshire and his wife, Joyce Sutton, in 1578. Leighton (who is sometimes called Layton) was a diplomat and soldier, and shared with her father the same strong Puritan beliefs. Following her marriage, Knollys, now styled Lady Leighton, continued to serve Queen Elizabeth in the same capacity as a Gentlewoman of the Privy Chamber, despite her sister Lettice's banishment from court. Her husband held the office of Governor of Jersey and Guernsey in the Channel Islands. Lady Leighton, however, did not spend much time on either island, much preferring life at court. Sir Walter Raleigh was her admirer, and had written her a poem. An unknown artist after George Gower painted her portrait in 1577. It shows her with curled hair; she is wearing a black hat with a feather, and an elaborate, ornamented gown, which are likely indications that she did not share her husband's dour Puritan sympathies. Her black hat was displayed at the National Maritime Museum in an exhibition in 2003 which was curated by noted Tudor historian, David Starkey. Knollys had given Queen Elizabeth a similar black hat as a gift in 1578/9. In turn, Knollys is listed as having been the recipient of many New Year's presents from the Queen. Issue Together Lady Leighton and her husband had three children: * Thomas (born 1584), married Mary Zouche * Elizabeth (died 12 January 1633), married Sherington Talbot, by whom she had issue. * Anne (died July 1628 in childbirth), married Sir John St John, 1st Baronet, by whom she had 13 children in 14 years. Death She died in 1605. On 10 June 1605, her £200 annuity was granted to Elizabeth Howard, Lady Carrick. AncestryIn fiction The character of Lady Penelope Knollys in the children's mystery novels, the Lady Grace Mysteries, is probably based on Lady Elizabeth Knollys. In the books, she is a maid of honour to Queen Elizabeth I and friend to the central character Lady Grace Cavendish. Her fictional father is given as Sir John Knollys and, in 1570, she marries Thomas Penn (rather than Thomas Leighton) at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. Penelope was the name of the real Lady Elizabeth's niece, the daughter of her brother, Sir Thomas Knollys, the Governor of Ostend.

Situated on the banks of the Musi River, the temple was built by the Nanganur Prathama Peetham and is administered by the Endowments Department of the Telangana state. It initially followed the Thenkalai tradition, but later adopted the more specific Vanamamalai sampradayam. Vaikuntha Ekadashi is the major festival celebrated here, attracting lakhs of devotees every year. Etymology During the reign of the Qutb Shahi Dynasty, the area where the temple is currently located was referred to as Shaukar Karvaan (present day Karwan), as the majority of the population who lived back then belonged to the Vaishya and Munnuru Kapu castes. They followed the school of Srivaishnava sampradaya. As Kalyana Vanamamalai Ramanuja Jeeyar, the head of the Vaishnavite Nanganur Prathama Peetham, stayed here for a while and conducted Vishnu worship, the place was later named Jeeyarguda after him. As the local Muslims found it difficult to pronounce Jeeyarguda, the name was altered to Jiyaguda. However, in Sanskrit, the place is still referred to with its previous name. History and architecture The temple is estimated to be more than 400 years old, and is the first in Hyderabad which is established by the Nanganur Prathama Peetham. Due to unavailability of priests who knew the Srivaishnava sampradayam within the Nanganur Peetham, priests from the Vanamamalai Peetham of Srirangam came to Hyderabad for conducting the regular worship. With the help of the devotees, the temple was renovated later. In February 2015, the temple has been exempted by the secretary of the Telangana Endowments Department under section 15 and 29 of the Religious and Charitable Endowments act for a period of three years. The temple is built in an area of two and a half acres following Dravidian style, and is located on the banks of the Musi river. It has a three tier rajagopuram (main temple tower). The central shrine houses a stone image of Ranganatha, a form of Vishnu reclining on a snake bed. There are separate shrines for Lakshmi (worshipped as Ranganayaki) and Andal, apart from Hanuman and Garuda. The dwajasthambam lies behind Garuda's shrine and is made of panchaloha. On the sanctum, images of Vishnu's Dashavatara can be seen. Worship and festivals The temple initially followed the Thenkalai tradition in the regular worship, but later switched to the more specific Vanamamalai sampradayam upon the Vaishnavite seer Chinna Jeeyar recommendation. The temple's affairs are managed by the hereditary temple committee, headed by Srungaram Tiruvengalacharyulu. Seshacharyulu, Rajagopalacharyulu, Badrinath and Srinivasa Ramanuja currently serve as the temple's priests; all of them belong to the Srungaram family who live in the temple's premises. The temple attracts maximum number of its visitors in the Dhanu month. From 2005, the temple has been celebrating Vaikuntha Ekadashi as its major festival, with lakhs of devotees attending the event from various districts. On Bhogi, the temple authorities perform the Kalyanam (marriage) of Andal with Ranganatha. And, on the third day of Makar Sankranti, they conduct the Vishesha Utsavam. During Chaturmas, Sahasranaman Archana and Revathi Nakshatra Abhishekam are performed apart from the regular worship activities.

The film is a comic adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde storyline and the opening credits include \\"with ideas stolen from Robert Louis Stevenson\\". The film has no connection to the Hans Christian Andersen story. The tagline on posters was \\"HE'S A CHANGED MAN AFTER TAKING JEKYLL'S FAMILY REMEDY.\\" Plot Joe Loss and his Orchestra are playing at a dance. Joe Loss then introduces Henrietta Jeckle Old Time Dance Team and her brother Henry Jeckle, who is a rather incompetent last-minute stand-in. They give a display of formation ballroom dancing with their brother Victor (Jon Pertwee) taking over the conducting, but Henry turns it into a disaster, much to his sister's dismay. Henry (Bernard Bresslaw) is a bungling, awkward and socially inept man working in his brother’s pharmacy, which is still named after their great-great-grandfather: \\"Dr Henry Jekyll M.D. - Pharmacy, Estabd. 1812\\". Victor and Henrietta discuss their worries about Henry as he goes to bed with his golliwog. Reginald Bannister comes to woo Henrietta but suggests that Henry should be kept out of the way if they marry. Henry is in the pharmacy lab when his elfin young female friend Snouty appears and accuses him of being a square. Luckily they are both in the rear yard when the lab explodes. The explosion reveals a small metal box containing a scroll. The scroll contains an old formula created by Dr Jekyll in the 19th century which claims to turn \\"a man of timid disposition into a bold, fearless dragon\\". He eagerly mixes the formula, takes one drink, and is transformed into the suave, dashing and self-confident Teddy Hyde, who makes a big impression at the local dance hall and with the ladies. He encounters Victor at the bar but is unrecognised, and belittles Victor by pouring a drink down the front of his trousers. This draws attention to the crooks who own the dance hall. They are initially going to throw him out but he impresses the boss, Dandy, with his bravado and he recruits him for a robbery he has planned. Teddy leaves just as the potion wears off and Henry wakes in his bed with a bad headache, and his only memory of the events of the previous night is that he thinks it was a dream. Later, Henry accidentally drinks the formula again, and Teddy leaves to join up with Dandy for the robbery. When Snouty tells Victor that the person at the dance hall was called Hyde, he immediately understands the connection from the family history and realises something must be done. Meanwhile, Teddy breaks into a house through a rooflight and cracks a safe to steal some very valuable jewels. As he and Dandy leave, they separate to avoid a policeman, but the formula wears off and when Dandy draws up to pick him up he does not recognise him, so Henry is unwittingly left with the jewels. Next morning, when Victor and Snouty see Henry, who again has a bad headache and cannot remember where he was last night, they question him and are shocked to find the jewels still in his pocket. Having decided to return them, Snouty gets into Dandy's office to try to find where the jewels are from, but she is caught by the gang and reveals that Henry plans to return the jewels. With Victor's help, Henry then starts to remember being Hyde and together they try to replace the jewels before they are missed, but they barge in on a special event to show off the jewels, which Henrietta and Reginald are attending. Dandy and a sidekick are also there to make another attempt at getting the jewels. Victor and Henry struggle on the roof due to their fear of heights. Meanwhile, the police and show organisers find the jewels are missing. Victor and Henry eventually get in and find the still-open safe and return the jewels. The police then return and see the jewels and the show continues as intended. Dandy in the audience realises the jewels are back, so he and his accomplice pull guns to steal the jewels. Snouty convinces Henry that he can do anything Hyde can do and he takes on the armed Dandy. Victor has hidden behind Dandy and knocks him out before he can fire on Henry. Later, at a special event at the dance hall in honour of Henry, he and Snouty (in a dress) dance for the first time.

Its label debut was released on February 16, 2010, while its vinyl version, which included the album on 140-gram vinyl and CD, was released on July 13. This is the first album the band has recorded for Nonesuch Records. It was highly successful, reaching the top ten on the Billboard Folk chart and the top of the Bluegrass chart.[ Genuine Negro Jig on the Billboard Bluegrass chart] It was also the last CCD recording to include collaborator and Sankofa Strings co-founder, Sule Greg Wilson. Like most of the Carolina Chocolate Drops' work, the album, a mixture of traditional folk songs, early 20th \\"Race\\" music, and recent pieces, is part of the Chocolate Drops' effort to celebrate the string band music of the Piedmont region of North and South Carolina, and the influence of African-Americans on this music. On NPR, band member Rhiannon Giddens pointed out that \\"it seems that two things get left out of the history books. One, that there was string band music in the Piedmont, period. (And that) black folk was such a huge part of string tradition.” Although the music the Chocolate Drops play is quite eclectic, the band members claim that early 20th-century African American string bands also drew from a wide range of genres in their musical repertoire. In describing the music, Giddens discusses how she was inspired but not bound by the genres in which she works--\\"Tradition is a guide, not a jailer. We play in an older tradition but we are modern musicians.\\" Genuine Negro Jig was well received by critics. Blogcritics writes that \\"our ears are all the better for it\\" and is \\"hoping that this record will not only put the Carolina Chocolate Drops on the map, but will also draw new listeners in to the genres of old country and blues.\\" Engine 145 describes Genuine Negro Jig as \\"an album of feistily complex, yet endearingly soulful songs that have ages of history behind them and a bright future as well.\\" Paste magazine calls the Chocolate Drops \\"the genuine article\\" whose \\"enthusiasm for the tradition is obvious.\\" The Guardian writes that the album is \\"well worth checking out.\\" The album won a 2010 Grammy Award in the best traditional folk album category, and was number 9 in fRoots magazine's top 10 albums of the year.

It was released in the United States in 2007 by Anchor Bay Entertainment under the title \\"Night of the Living Dorks\\". Plot The film begins in Haiti, where a zombie attacks a small family, only to be quickly killed by being set on fire. The zombie's ashes are gathered in an urn, which is promptly stolen and sold before it can be buried. Three months later, Philip Fleischhacker (Tino Mewes) is left to watch his parents' house as they go on a trip in their RV, specifically forbidding him to have any parties, drink, or do drugs. He is then picked up by his two friends Wurst (Manuel Cortez), a party-loving stoner and Konrad (), a nerd who is frequently bullied. The three also give a ride to Philip's neighbor Rebecca (Collien Fernandes), a goth girl who has an unrequited crush on Philip. At school, Philip attempts to ask out a popular girl named Uschi (Nadine Garmann), which prompts her jock boyfriend Wolfe (Hendrik Borgmann) to bully and humiliate Philip and his friends. While in Frau Niedermacher's (Patricia Thielemann) class, Rebecca and her two goth friends Gunther (Oliver Grober) and Frederik (Tom Lass) give a presentation on Voodoo, which is ridiculed by the class, including Wurst and Konrad. When Philip learns that Rebecca knows of a love spell, he asks if she would use it for him so that he could woo Uschi. Though she tells him it will not work, she tells him to meet her and her friends at the cemetery, where she, Gunther, and Frederik planned to perform a ritual. Later that night, Philip, Wurst, and Konrad show up at the cemetery, where they learn that Rebecca and the goths plan to use the ashes of a zombie (specifically the zombie from the beginning of the film), and a chicken from the grocery store, to raise the dead, specifically to raise Kurt Cobain so that he can play music for them. Though the spell is cast, as the urn is being emptied, a gust of wind picks up and covers Philip, Wurst, and Konrad in the zombie's ashes. Disappointed and frustrated, the three leave. While driving home, Wurst loses control of his van while messing with his bong, causing an accident that kills all three boys. The zombie ashes slowly re-animate them. The three wake up in a mortuary, and discover that they are dead, but are somehow still alive all the same. They escape the morgue, and after returning home realize that they have become zombies as a result of the ritual. The next morning the three eat raw steaks before going to school. At school, the boys are bullied again by Wolfe, but quickly discover that because they are now zombies, they no longer feel pain and have tremendous strength. Realizing this, Konrad begins to take revenge on those who bullied him (as he has written down every incident since he started school), while Philip seeks out Rebecca. He initially tries to get her help in fixing his zombie condition, but she mistakenly thinks he remembered her birthday, causing him to promise to spend it with her. Throughout the day Konrad begins to crave raw meat and human flesh, causing him to get in trouble after he bites one of his classmates. At gym class, the boys use their newfound strength and immunity to pain in order to trounce Wolfe and the school rugby team, which earns them the admiration of their whole class. To celebrate their victory, Wurst announces a party at Philip's house, and Uschi publicly declares that she will have sex with Philip. When Rebecca sees this, she storms off, angry and hurt. Konrad sneaks into the office of the gym teacher (Tim Wilde) and takes revenge upon him by eating him. When Philip and Wurst discover this, they scold him and end up ripping of Konrad's ear, which he staples back on. To keep him from eating anyone else, Philip and Wurst chain Konrad to a pipe in the basement. Later on, Uschi and the rest of the school show up at Philip's home and proceed to throw a wild party. Wurst uses his being undead to win numerous bets, particularly drinking competitions, and seduces Frau Niedermacher. Wolfe, eager for revenge for being humiliated by Philip, sneaks in, leaves a stash of drugs in the basement, and calls the police. Konrad consumes all of the drugs and breaks free from his confinement. Philip pleads for Rebecca to come join the party, which she agrees to eventually. She arrives just as Philip and Uschi were about to have sex, causing her to leave, again feeling hurt. Philip attempts to seduce Uschi, but she accidentally pulls off his penis, causing him to quickly run away. With the help of Wurst, he reattaches his penis with a stapler. Uschi catches the two in the middle of this, and assumes Wurst was giving Philip fellatio. She then ridicules and humiliates him, prompting people to start leaving. The police show up and search the house, but find nothing, much to the dismay of Wolfe (who did not realize the drugs he planted were gone) and Philip (who discovered Konrad had escaped). The police find nothing and break up the party finally. Once alone, Konrad bites and kills Wolfe, prompting them to hide his body in the freezer. Desperate for a cure, Philip goes to Rebecca once again. While alone with her, he loses control, attacks her, accidentally burns her spell book, and then runs away in shame. Rebecca then correctly deduces that the ritual she and the other goths performed turned Philip and his friends in to zombies. The next morning, Konrad is gone, but Rebecca arrives and agrees to help them find an antidote. She has Philip and Wurst steal another copy of her spell book from a museum, and then sends them off to gather the necessary ingredients, including holy water and the blood of a virgin. Wurst and Philip gather all except the blood, which Rebecca reluctantly offers. As she prepares the potion, Philip and Wurst scramble to clean up the house, as Philip's parents (Henry Grundler and Sissi Perlinger) call to inform him they're on their way home. En route, they accidentally run over Konrad and take him to the hospital. When Philip's parents arrive at home, Philip and Wurst fail in convincing them that there was no party held there the previous night, but manage to escape and consume the potion, making them human again. Philip, Rebecca, and Wurst rush for the hospital, using Frau Niedermacher's car. At the hospital, the group confront Konrad (who had gone through a large portion of the hospital's blood bank), and give chase in an attempt to get him to drink the potion. While cornering him in an autopsy room, Philip ends up impaled on a knife which Konrad threw at Rebecca, and starts dying for a second time. Overcome with remorse, Konrad saves Philip by turning him into a zombie again using his own blood, and agrees to drink the potion. Wurst accidentally drops the bottle containing it, causing it to break. After tasting the contents of the bottle, however, Wurst realizes it was Frau Niedermacher's special cocktail of \\"moonshine, vodka, and orange juice,\\" and that she in fact had the real potion. Frau Niedermacher then appears with the bottle, and Philip and Konrad become human again. In the final scene, Philip and Rebecca acknowledge their feelings for one another and have sex in Philip's bed after sneaking her into his room. Reception The film received negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gave at the film 20% positives reviews and a note of 4.5/10, based on 5 reviews. Remake In 2007, a remake was announced. Michael Showalter was selected by Warner Independent to direct the film, which was described as Revenge of the Nerds meets Shaun of the Dead . Roy Lee, Doug Davison and Adam F.

As the Spanish protectorate became too dominant, the Prince of Monaco concluded the Treaty of Péronne on 14 September 1641 with King Louis XIII of France... This relationship has been interrupted twice, with the first interruption occurring during the French Revolution. By Decree of the National Convention on October 27, 1793, the Principality of Monaco was integrated into the territory of France until the passing of the Treaty of Paris on May 30, 1814. The second interruption occurred just shortly after as a result of the Second Treaty of Paris (20 November 1815), which made Monaco a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia. This led the Monagasque postal system to become Sardinian from the signing of the Treaty of Stupinigi (taking effect from 1 January 1818) until the signing of the Treaty of Turin on 24 March 1860, again making Monaco a principality of France, and restoring their postal relationship.

Grafiti Pers. (Indonesian) The title of Datuk was agreed upon by local, traditional leaders (Kerapatan Adat Nagari, abbreviated \\"KAN\\"). The title engenders great respect, and is only used for Minangkabau men who have become stakeholders of traditional leaders or penghulu (noblemen) for a particular tribe. When the title is bestowed, it is celebrated with a traditional ceremony (Malewa Gala) and a banquet. Inheritance Unlike other Malay traditions, the title of datuk is inherited according to the matrilineal system. When a datuk dies his title may pass to his brother or nephew, whoever is closest in the maternal line. If there is no maternal relative, it may be given to another tribal member with the agreement of the tribe. If the tribe has expanded and split up into groups in other areas, it may appoint a new datuk by appending one or two words to the previous datuk title; for example, if a datuk name is Datuak Bandaro it may be expanded to Bandaro Putiah or Datuak Bandaro nan Putiah with the agreement of each tribal subgroup. Tradition The social status of a people in Minangkabau society may be seen from its datuk title. The beginning of the oldest titles usually consists of one syllable and is derived from Sanskrit (for example, Datuk Ketemanggungan). Other datuk titles are composed of two (or more) words (for example, Datuk Parpatiah nan Sabatang). After the Islamic influence, the title of datuk is derived from Arabic. Below is a list of major datuk titles in Minangkabau legend and tradition: * Datuk Ketumanggungan * Datuk Parpatiah nan Sabatang * Datuk Bandaro * Datuk Makhudum * Datuk Indomo * Datuk Sinaro See also * Indian honorifics, Indonesian and Malay titles originated from these * Greater India * Indosphere * Barangay * Datu * Maginoo * Ratu * Principalía * Malay styles and titles * Hinduism in the Philippines * History of the Philippines (Before 1521) References Category:Malay culture Category:Minangkabau Category:Titles ","title":"Datuk (Minangkabau)"},{"id":"29188342","text":"Ignaz Czapka was a mayor of Vienna.List of mayors of Vienna  References  Category:Mayors of Vienna Category:1791 births Category:1881 deaths ","title":"Ignaz Czapka"},{"id":"29188356","text":"Radermachera xylocarpa is a species of plant in the family Bignoniaceae.

In September 1791 the Theater auf der Wieden saw the premiere of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's opera The Magic Flute. Emanuel Schikaneder's troupe moved to the Theater an der Wien when it opened in 1801, and the Theater auf der Wieden was converted into apartments. Hörl was appointed to the position of Mayor of Vienna in 1773 by Empress Maria Theresia. In 1780 Emperor Joseph II elevated him to the rank of k.k. Rat (Imperial Advisor) and invited him to participate in his Magistratsreform, which was introduced in 1783 and remained in force until 1850. During this period the municipal administration of Vienna, the Magistrat (with 42 Magistratsräte), was divided into three independent 'Senates', with the mayor as the overall executive leader. The 'Senat in publico-politicis et oeconomicis' was responsible for the municipal administration and finances, the 'Senat in judicialibus criminalibus' oversaw criminal law and the 'Senat in judicialibus civilibus' oversaw civil law. The mayor in person chaired the first of these Senates, the other two were chaired by depute mayors. The Magistratsräte, the depute mayors and the mayor were elected for four years at a time by the Äußerer Rat, a committee of Viennese citizens, and their appointment had to be ratified by the Government. The citizens' committee, originally with 95 members, was for its part elected by the Magistratsräte. With this reform Joseph II in effect incorporated the municipal administration into the centralised system of an absolutist state, thereby successfully preventing the citizens of Vienna from attaining political independence.

It is found throughout the United States, southern Canada and parts of Mexico. 200px 200px Euzophera semifuneralis, American plum borer Euzophera semifuneralis, American plum borer The wingspan is 17–28 mm. Adults are gray with grayish-brown forewings with broad, wavy bands of black and brown markings across the outer third portion. The hindwings are smoky with black marginal lines fringed with white. The head, thorax, legs and abdomen are dusky gray with bright bronze reflections. Adults in the southern part of the range emerge from April through September. They live for 1–3 weeks. The larvae feed on a wide range of plants, including plum, peach, cherry, Chinese plum, pear, mountain-ash, persimmon, apple, white mulberry, sycamore, apricot, walnut, pecan, olive, basswood, poplar, sweetgum, yellow-poplar, ginkgo, elm and oak. Plum and other drupe and pome fruit trees are favoured. However, pecan and sweetgum are sometimes heavily attacked all along the Gulf Coast region. The larvae bore into the bark of their host at scars, wounds, or crevices where bark scales offer concealment and protection. Larval mines are very shallow and irregularly shaped, cave-type burrows between wood and the outer bark. The galleries are usually loosely packed with frass. Larval feeding lasts 30–38 days. Pupation takes place in burrows under the bark in loosely spun silken cocoons partially surrounded by dark excrement pellets. The pupal stage lasts 24–33 days for the overwintering generation but may be completed in as few as 10 days for summer generations. Up to five generations occur annually in central Texas, but only two generations in Virginia, Delaware and Michigan.

Career She began her professional music career at age 42. Originally she performed as René Croan; she released her first album using this name in 1999. That year she also performed at Blues Alley in Washington, D.C. and signed a contract with the St. Louis-based Maxjazz label. She released four albums on the label, the second of which (Vertigo) was awarded a coronet ranking by The Penguin Guide to Jazz, a distinction given to less than 85 other recordings in jazz history. In her work, the singer often combines contrasting songs (\\"Dixie\\" and the anti-lynching \\"Strange Fruit\\" on Vertigo) or combines other works (Ravel's Boléro and Leonard Cohen's \\"Suzanne\\" on Live at Jazz Standard.) René Marie attracted controversy in 2008, when she was invited to sing \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" at a civic event in Denver, and substituted the song's lyrics with those from \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing.\\" This arrangement of the national anthem forms part of the titular suite of Marie's 2011 CD, The Voice of My Beautiful Country (Motéma Music). She specialises in writing her own music, and she comments on the fact that this is not the norm in jazz in one of her songs, \\"This for Joe,\\" after a club manager who got mad at her for singing originals. Her 2011 release, Black Lace Freudian Slip contains only three songs that she did not write, and one of those was written by her son, Michael A. Croan, who performs on the track with her. She also released a number of singles in 2007–2009, focused on homeless issues, \\"This Is Not a Protest Song\\", and the racial problems in Jena, Louisiana, \\"3 Nooses Hanging\\". Besides her purely musical works, she has also written, produced and performed a one- woman show of words and music, Slut Energy Theory – U'Dean, in which she explores the journey from sexual abuse to self-esteem. More recent productions of the show have shortened the title simply to \\"Slut Energy Theory.\\" The soundtrack to this show has been released. Personal life René Marie married at age 18, and was a mother of two children by age 23. When her husband issued an ultimatum after 23 years of marriage for her to stop singing or leave, she chose music over her turbulent marriage.

The team competes in the NCAA Division III and are members of the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. Wisconsin–Whitewater's first football team was fielded in 1889. The team plays its home games at the 13,500 seat Perkins Stadium in Whitewater, Wisconsin. The Warhawks are coached by Kevin Bullis. History The Warhawks compete in the WIAC conference of NCAA Division III football. In the 2005 and 2006 seasons, they finished the year undefeated in regular season play, losing only in the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowls of 2005 and 2006 to the University of Mount Union (then Mount Union College), under former coach and UW-Whitewater alum Bob Berezowitz (UW-Whitewater 1967), who had quarterbacked the UW-Whitewater team as the runner-up in the 1966 National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics playoffs. Following the 2006 season, Berezowitz retired, and alum and former assistant Lance Leipold (UW-Whitewater 1987) was named Warhawk head coach. The Warhawks opened the 2007 with a victory, then suffered their first regular-season defeat since 2004, 26-16 to NCAA Division II's St. Cloud State. The Warhawks followed this up by going undefeated through the remainder of the season. After finishing the regular season with a 9-1 record and a third consecutive 7-0 WIAC record, the UW–Whitewater Warhawks entered the NCAA Division III playoffs for the third consecutive time. The Warhawks won four home playoff games, including a Dec. 8 repeat home victory over Mary Hardin- Baylor 16-7 in the semi-finals, to earn their third straight trip to the NCAA Division III Championship Game, the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl in Salem, Virginia and set up their third championship game against Mount Union College. On Dec. 15, 2007 the Warhawks beat Mount Union 31-21 to win the Division III title and close the 2007 season 14-1. Warhawk running back Justin Beaver won the John Gagliardi Trophy for his performance both on and off the field. The Warhawks entered the 2008 playoffs with one loss after a last-second loss to UW-Stevens Point that ended UW-Whitewater's WIAC win streak at 27 games. Despite having to travel for some of their playoff contests, the Warhawks won four playoff games, earning a spot in the Stagg Bowl after a victory over Mary Hardin- Baylor 39-13. On Dec. 20, 2008 the Warhawks lost to Mount Union 31-26 in their fourth consecutive Stagg Bowl matchup. The Warhawks ran the table in 2009 with a perfect record of 15-0, defeating Mount Union in the Stagg Bowl 38-28 to claim their second national title in three years. The string continued in 2010, including a sixth straight WIAC title, and ending with UW-Whitewater’s third NCAA III championship in four years, with a 31-21 win over Mount Union in the Stagg Bowl to finish 15-0 and run the NCAA (all divisions) leading win streak to 30 games. Once again, in 2011, they ran the regular season undefeated, with a seventh straight WIAC title. They then went on the face Mount Union in the Stagg Bowl for the seventh straight season, and won their third straight title, fourth in five years to finish 15-0 again. They raised their win streak to 45 games, which is just 2 behind Oklahoma's historic Division I streak, and is fourth behind Mount Union's separate 55 and 54 game winning streaks in all of college football. In 2013, the Warhawks faced off with the Purple Raiders of Mount Union in the Stagg Bowl for the eighth time in nine seasons. UW-Whitewater, led by junior quarterback Mitchell Kroening, would go on to win by a final score of 52-14 and secure their fifth National Championship, and fourth undefeated season, under coach Leipold. On December 19, 2014 the Warhawks and Mount Union met again in the Stagg Bowl; the Warhawks won the NCAA DIII Football title over the Raiders, 43-34. This was Leipold's final game as Warhawks head coach, as he had already been announced as the new head coach at Division I FBS school Buffalo. Kevin Bullis was introduced on February 4, 2015 as the 21st head coach of the Warhawks. The former UW-Whitewater assistant had spent eight years as the defensive line coach and run defense coordinator. The Warhawks finished the 2015 season as runner-up in the WIAC behind UW-Oshkosh, who they lost 10-7 on October 10. The Warhawks got revenge against the Titans, beating them 31-29 in the 3rd round of the NCAA DIII Playoffs. The Warhawks would go on to lose the next week 36-6 to the Mount Union Raiders in the NCAA DIII Semifinals. The Warhawks finished the season 12-2. In 2016, the Warhawks won their 35th conference title on the way to a perfect regular season. The season highlight was a come-from-behind 17-14 victory over the UW-Oshkosh Titans. The game set the DIII on-campus attendance record with 17,535 people in attendance. The Warhawks perfect season ended in round 3 of the NCAA DIII playoffs, losing to John Carroll University, the same team who three weeks earlier ended Mount Union's 117 Regular Season win streak, by a score of 31-14. In 2017, the team started the season 0-2 for the first time since 2001. After a WIAC season opening loss to UW-Oshkosh, their record fell to 1-3. The Warhawks then rattled off six- straight victories, giving them a final record of 7-3. The substandard season left the Warhawks out of the playoffs for only the second time since 2005.

It is published by Marvel Comics under the company's Icon imprint.  Synopsis  Simon Pooni, an angry, bitter 12-year- old boy suffering from multiple sclerosis, idolizes superheroes, particularly Superior, a Superman analogue. An alien monkey named Ormon appears at Simon's bedside, informing the boy that of all the people on Earth, he has been granted the honor of being bestowed a single magic wish. Simon is then transformed into Superior. After playing the role of Superior for a week, he learns that Ormon is actually a demon incarnate, and he must sell his soul to the devil in order to remain as Superior. He is given 24 hours to decide, and is returned to his old body. The demon approaches an old bully of Simon, and offers him a similar wish, to become Superior's fictional nemesis, Abraxas; the only caveat is that he must pledge himself to Satan. Simon must then choose whether to become Superior again and save the planet from imminent destruction at the cost of his own soul. To force Simon to choose, Abraxas begins destroying the city. Simon transforms into Superior and fights both Abraxas and Ormon. Although Superior defeats them in battle, Ormon gloats that he still has Simon's soul, until he realizes that Simon (as Superior) is immortal, and that his soul can never be collected. Ormon is dragged back to Hell as punishment for his failure, and Simon reverts to his mortal form. The world honors Superior as a fallen hero, thinking him killed in battle, and Simon returns to his former life, but now at peace with himself.
