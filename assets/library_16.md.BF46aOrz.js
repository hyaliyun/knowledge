In 1909 his former schoolmaster informed him that an organisation (Na Fianna √âireann) was soon to be set up. He told Martin that Countess Markievicz had been to see him and that she had told him to recommend it to his pupils. He encouraged him to attend the first meeting. At the meeting he met Bulmer Hobson and Countess Markievicz for the first time. In August 1915 Martin became director of organisation and recruiting and commandant of the Fianna's Dublin Battalion and held these positions until Easter 1916. From January 1917 to 1920 he was chief of staff of the organisation. Martin was also a member of the Irish Volunteers Executive Council, representing Fianna √âireann. In 1914 Martin was involved in the Kilcoole gun-running and Howth gun-running operations. On Easter Monday, the first day of the rising, he and a group of about 30 Fianna members attacked the Magazine Fort in Phoenix Park. The detachment disarmed the guards and took guns and ammunition. They intended to blow up the fort, which would signal the start of the rising, but the type of explosives inside the fort were not what they expected. The following day Martin was involved in the attempt to occupy Broadstone railway station. As the detachment approached the station Martin was shot and was taken to Richmond Hospital. It was discovered that a bullet had passed through his arm, into his chest and out through his lung and back. After the rising Martin was commandant of a special Fianna √âireann commando, with the purpose of resisting army conscription during World War I.Witness Statement of Seamus Pounch to the Bureau of Military History, 1949.Witness Statement of Garry Holohan to the Bureau of Military History, 1949.Witness Statement of Joseph Reynolds to Bureau of Military History, 1949.

Part of the Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal, c. 645‚Äì635 BC Assyrian sculpture is the sculpture of the ancient Assyrian states, especially the Neo-Assyrian Empire of 911 to 612 BC, which ruled modern Iraq, Syria, and much of Iran. It forms a phase of the art of Mesopotamia, differing in particular because of its much greater use of stone and gypsum alabaster for large sculpture. Much the best- known works are the huge lamassu guarding entrance ways, and Assyrian palace reliefs on thin slabs of alabaster, which were originally painted, at least in part, and fixed on the wall all round the main rooms of palaces. Most of these are in museums in Europe or America, following a hectic period of excavations from 1842 to 1855,Reade, 5‚Äì17; see Larsen in further reading which took Assyrian art from being almost completely unknown to being the subject of several best-selling books, and imitated in political cartoons.Oates, 6‚Äì8; Hoving, 40 The palace reliefs contain scenes in low relief which glorify the king, showing him at war, hunting, and fulfilling other kingly roles. Many works left in situ, or in museums local to their findspots,Reade, 5 have been deliberately destroyed in the recent occupation of the area by ISIS, the pace of destruction reportedly increasing in late 2016, with the Mosul offensive.In November 2016 the situation remains unclear. Browne, Gareth, \\"Isis flattened ancient capital after shipping out its treasures\\" in The Times (London), 19 November 2016 says that the most serious damage to Nimrud was done in late 2016, as the allied forces moved to retake Mosul, where the museum also had an important collection. Other surviving types of art include many cylinder seals,Frankfort, 198‚Äì199 a few rock reliefs, reliefs and statues from temples, bronze relief strips used on large doors,Frankfort, 164‚Äì167 and small quantities of metalwork.Frankfort, 194‚Äì196 A group of sixteen bronze weights shaped as lions with bilingual inscriptions in both cuneiform and Phoenician characters, were discovered at Nimrud.British Museum Collection The Nimrud ivories, an important group of small plaques which decorated furniture, were found in a palace storeroom near reliefs, but they came from around the Mediterranean, with relatively few made locally in an Assyrian style.Frankfort, 313‚Äì315, 319‚Äì322 (and see index); Honour & Fleming, 77; Nimrud ivories press release, British Museum Palace reliefs Detail of genie figure, the palace of Ashurnasirpal II The palace reliefs were fixed to the walls of royal palaces forming continuous strips along the walls of large halls. The style apparently began after about 879 BC, when Ashurnasirpal II moved the capital to Nimrud, near modern Mosul in northern Iraq.Reade, 25 Thereafter, new royal palaces, of which there was typically one per reign, were extensively decorated in this way for the roughly 250 years until the end of the Assyrian Empire.Reade, 56‚Äì60, on the latest reliefs There was subtle stylistic development, but a very large degree of continuity in subjects and treatment.Grove Compositions are arranged on slabs, or orthostats, typically about 7 feet high, using between one and three horizontal registers of images, with scenes generally reading from left to right. The sculptures are often accompanied with inscriptions in cuneiform script, explaining the action or giving the name and extravagant titles of the king.Frankfort, 157 Heads and legs are shown in profile, but torsos in a front or three-quarters view, as in earlier Mesopotamian art.Grove Eyes are also largely shown frontally. Some panels show only a few figures at close to life-size, such scenes usually including the king and other courtiers,Reade, 42‚Äì43 but depictions of military campaigns include dozens of small figures, as well as many animals and attempts at showing landscape settings. Campaigns focus on the progress of the army, including the fording of rivers, and usually culminates in the siege of a city, followed by the surrender and paying of tribute, and the return of the army home. A full and characteristic set shows the campaign leading up to the siege of Lachish in 701; it is the \\"finest\\" from the reign of Sennacherib, from his palace at Nineveh and now in the British Museum.Reade, 56 (quoted), 65‚Äì71 Ernst Gombrich observed that none of the many casualties ever come from the Assyrian side.The Story of Art (in its chronological place; there are too many editions to give a page number) Another famous sequence there shows the Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal, in fact the staged and ritualized killing by King Ashurbanipal of lions already captured and released into an arena, from the North Palace at Nineveh. The realism of the lions has always been praised, and the scenes are often regarded as \\"the supreme masterpieces of Assyrian art\\", although the pathos modern viewers tend to feel was perhaps not part of the Assyrian response.Honour & Fleming, 76‚Äì77; Reade, 72‚Äì79, 73 quoted; Frankfort, 186‚Äì192; Hoving, 40‚Äì41 There are many reliefs of minor supernatural beings, called by such terms as \\"winged genie\\", but the major Assyrian deities are only represented by symbols. The \\"genies\\" often perform a gesture of purification, fertilization or blessing with a bucket and cone; the meaning of this remains unclear.Frankfort, 146‚Äì148, Especially on larger figures, details and patterns on areas such as costumes, hair and beards, tree trunks and leaves, and the like, are very meticulously carved. More important figures are often shown larger than others, and in landscapes more distant elements are shown higher up, but not smaller than, those in the foreground, though some scenes have been interpreted as using scale to indicate distance. Other scenes seem to repeat a figure in a succession of different moments, performing the same action, most famously a charging lion. But these were apparently experiments that remain unusual.Honour & Fleming, 75‚Äì77 The king is often shown in narrative scenes, and also as a large standing figure in a few prominent places, generally attended by winged genies. A composition repeated twice in what is traditionally called the \\"throne-room\\" (though perhaps it was not) of Ashurbanipal's palace at Nimrud shows a \\"Sacred Tree\\" or \\"Tree of Life\\" flanked by two figures of the king, with winged genies using the bucket and cone behind him. Above the tree one of the major gods, perhaps Ashur the chief god, leans out of a winged disc, relatively small in scale. Such scenes are shown elsewhere on the robe of the king, no doubt reflecting embroidery on the real costumes, and the major gods are normally shown in discs or purely as symbols hovering in the air. Elsewhere the tree is often attended to by genies.Reade, 36‚Äì38 Women are relatively rarely shown, and then usually as prisoners or refugees; an exception is a \\"picnic\\" scene showing Ashurbanipal with his queen.Reade, 47; image The many beardless royal attendants can probably be assumed to be eunuchs, who ran much of the administration of the empire, unless they also have the shaved heads and very tall hats of priests.Reade, 43‚Äì44 Kings are often accompanied by several courtiers, the closest to the king probably often being the appointed heir, who was not necessarily the oldest son.42‚Äì43 The enormous scales of the palace schemes allowed narratives to be shown at an unprecedentedly expansive pace, making the sequence of events clear and allowing richly detailed depictions of the activities of large numbers of figures, not to be paralleled until the Roman narrative column reliefs of the Column of Trajan and Column of Marcus Aurelius.Frankfort, 168; Honour & Fleming, 73, 75‚Äì77 File:Sculpted reliefs depicting Ashurbanipal, the last great Assyrian king, hunting lions, gypsum hall relief from the North Palace of Nineveh (Irak), c. 645-635 BC, British Museum (16722131531).jpgDying lion, Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal, North Palace, Nineveh File:Lachish Relief, British Museum.jpgPrisoners and cavalry, Lachish relief File:Sargon II and dignitary.jpgSargon II (right), probably facing his heir Sennacherib, Khorsabad File:2015-12 Deux serviteurs portant un si√®ge et un vase AO 19879.jpgEunuch attendants carry furniture and a bowl Lamassu Pair of lamassu or shedu from Khorsabad, with the five legs of the left one showing. Lamassu were protective minor deities or spirits, the Assyrian version of the \\"human-headed bull\\" figure that had long figured in Mesopotamian mythology and art. Lamassu have wings, a male human head with the elaborate headgear of a divinity, and the elaborately-braided hair and beards shared with royalty. The body is that of either a bull or a lion, the form of the feet being the main difference. Prominent pairs of lamassu were typically placed at entrances in palaces, facing the street and also internal courtyards. They were \\"double-aspect\\" figures on corners, in high relief, a type earlier found in Hittite art. From the front they appear to stand, and from the side, walk, and in earlier versions have five legs, as is apparent when viewed obliquely. Lamassu do not generally appear as large figures in the low-relief schemes running round palace rooms, where winged genie figures are common, but they sometimes appear within narrative reliefs, apparently protecting the Assyrians.Frankfort, 147‚Äì148, 154; Reade, 28-29 The colossal entrance way figures were often followed by a hero grasping a wriggling lion, also colossal and in high relief; these and some genies beside lamassu are generally the only other types of high relief in Assyrian sculpture. The heroes continue the Master of Animals tradition in Mesopotamian art, and may represent Enkidu, a central figure in the ancient Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh. In the palace of Sargon II at Khorsabad, a group of at least seven lamassu and two such heroes with lions surrounded the entrance to the \\"throne room\\", \\"a concentration of figures which produced an overwhelming impression of power\\".Frankfort, 147‚Äì148, 148 quoted; Reade, 29 The arrangement was repeated in Sennacherib's palace at Nineveh, with a total of ten lamassu.Grove Other accompanying figures for colossal lamassu are winged genies with the bucket and cone, thought to be the equipment for a protective or purifying ritual.Reade, 38 Lamassu also appear on cylinder seals. Several examples left in situ in northern Iraq have been destroyed in the 2010s by ISIL when they occupied the area. Colossal lamassu also guarded the start of the large canals built by the Assyrian kings.Reade, 50 In the case of temples, pairs of colossal lions guarding the entrances have been found.Reade, 23-24 (British Museum example illustrated below) Construction Relief fragments from Nimrud, showing the depth of the slabs (probably sawn down in excavation) and scale. The main head belongs to a court eunuch. There are outcrops of the \\"Mosul marble\\" gypsum rock normally used at several places in the Assyrian realm, though not especially close to the capitals. The rock is very soft and slightly soluble in water, and exposed faces degraded, and needed to be cut into before usable stone was reached. There are reliefs showing quarrying for Sennacherib's new palace at Nineveh, though concentrating on the production of large lamassu. Blocks were extracted, using prisoners of war, and sawed into slabs with long iron saws. This may have happened at the palace site, which is certainly where the carving of orthostats was done, after the slabs had been fixed into place as a facing to a mud-brick wall, using lead dowels and clamps, with the bottoms resting on a bed of bitumen.Reade, 25‚Äì26 For some reliefs an \\"attractive fossiliferous limestone\\" is used, as in several rooms in the South-West Palace at Nineveh.Grove In contrast to the orthostats, the lamassu were carved, or at least partly so, at the quarry, no doubt to reduce their enormous weight.Oates, 52 The alabaster stone is soft but not brittle, and very suitable for detailed carving with early Iron Age tools. There can be considerable differences in style, and quality, between adjacent panels, suggesting that different master carvers were allocated these. Probably the master drew or incised the design on the slab before a team of carvers laboriously cut away the background areas and finished carving the figures. Scribes then set out any inscriptions for cutters to follow, after which the slab was polished smooth, and any paint added.Reade, 27 Scribes are shown directing carvers in another relief (on the Balawat Gates) showing the creation of a rock relief; presumably they ensured that the depiction of royal and religious aspects of the subjects was as it should be.Reade, 21 The reliefs only covered the lower parts of the walls of rooms in the palaces, and higher areas were often painted, at least in patterns, and at least sometimes with other figures. Brightly coloured carpets on the floor completed what was probably a striking decor, largely in primary colours. None of these have survived, but we have some door-sills carved with repeated geometric motifs, presumed to imitate the carpets.Reade, 29‚Äì31 After the palaces were abandoned and lost their wooden roofs, the unbaked mud-brick walls gradually collapsed, covering the space in front of the reliefs, and largely protecting them from further damage from the weather. Relatively few traces of paint remain, and these are often on heads and faces ‚Äì hair and beards were black, and at least the whites of eyes white. Possibly metal leaf was used on some elements, such as small scenes shown decorating textiles. Julian Reade concludes that \\"It is nonetheless puzzling that more traces of painting [on sculpture] have not been recorded\\".Reade, 7, 29‚Äì30, 30 quoted Other narrative reliefs Fragment from the Balawat Gates, Baltimore Apart from the alabaster wall reliefs, all found in palaces, other objects carrying relatively large reliefs are bronze strips used to reinforce and decorate large gates. Parts of three sets have survived, all from the 9th century and the relatively minor city of Imgur-Enlil, modern Balawat. The Balawat Gates were all double gates about 20 foot high, with both the front and back sides decorated with eight bronze repouss√© strips, each carrying two registers of narrative reliefs some five inches high. There were presumably equivalents at other Assyrian sites, but at the collapse of the empire the buildings at Balawat caught fire \\"before they had been efficiently looted\\" by the enemy, and remained hidden in the ashes and rubble;Reade, 32, quoted; Frankfort, 164‚Äì167 gypsum slabs were not worth the trouble of looting, unlike bronze. The subjects were similar to the wall reliefs, but on a smaller scale; a typical band is 27 centimetres high, 1.8 metres wide, and only a millimetre thick. British Museum collection database; Frankfort, 164 In stone there are reliefs of a similar size on some stelae, most notably two in rectangular obelisk form, both with stepped tops like ziggurats. These are the early 11th-century White Obelisk of Ashurnasirpal I and the 9th century Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III, both in the British Museum, who also have the fragmentary \\"Broken\\" or \\"Rassam Obelisk\\". Both have reliefs on all four sides in eight and five registers respectively, and long inscriptions describing the events. The Black and Rassam Obelisks were both set up in what seems to have been the central square in the citadel of Nimrud, presumably a very public space, and the White in Nineveh. All record much the same types of scenes as the narrative sections of wall-relief, and the gates. The Black Obelisk concentrates on scenes of the bringing of tribute from conquered kingdoms, including Israel, while the White also has scenes of war, hunting, and religious figures. The White Obelisk, from 1049‚Äì1031, and the \\"Broken Obelisk\\" from 1074‚Äì1056, predate the earliest known wall-reliefs by 160 years or more, but are respectively in worn and fragmentary condition.Reade, 32, 35, 63‚Äì64; Frankfort, 167; White, British Museum page The Black Obelisk is of special interest as the lengthy inscriptions, with names of places and rulers that could be related to other sources, were of importance in the decipherment of cuneiform script.Reade, 12 The Obelisk contains the earliest writing mentioning both the Persian and Jewish peoples, and confirmed some of the events described in the Bible, which in the 19th century was regarded as timely support for texts whose historical accuracy was under increasing attack.Reade, 62‚Äì71 Other, much smaller pieces with helpful inscriptions were a set of sixteen weight measures in the form of lions.British Museum collection database Statues and portrait stelae Detail of statue of Shalmaneser III in Istanbul There are very few large free-standing Assyrian statues and, with one possible exception (below), none have been found of the major divinities in their temples. Possibly others existed; any in precious metals would have been looted as the empire fell. Two statues of kings are similar to the portraits in palace reliefs, though seen frontally. They came from temples, where they showed the king's devotion to the deity. The Statue of Ashurnasirpal II is in the British Museum, and that of Shalmaneser III in Istanbul.Reade, 22‚Äì23 There is a unique female nude statue in the British Museum, missing its extremities, which was found in the temple of Ishtar at Nineveh. The pubic hair is carefully represented. It carries an inscription on the back that King Ashur-bel-kala erected it for the \\"titilation\\" or enjoyment of the people. It might represent Ishtar, goddess of love among other things,British Museum in which case it would be the only known Assyrian statue of a major divinity. All these have standing poses, though seated statues were already known in Mesopotamian art, for example about a dozen statues of Gudea, who ruled Lagash c. 2144 ‚Äì 2124 BC.Frankfort, 93-98 Like other Near-Eastern cultures, the Assyrians erected stelae for various purposes, including marking boundaries. Many just carry inscriptions, but there are some with significant relief sculpture, mostly a large standing portrait of the king of the day, pointing at symbols of the gods, similar in pose to those in palace reliefs, surrounded by a round-topped frame.Reade, 20‚Äì22 Similar figures of kings are shown in rock reliefs, mostly around the edges of the empire. Those shown being made on the Balawat Gates are presumably the ones surviving in poor condition near the Tigris Tunnel. The Assyrians probably took the form from the Hittites; the sites chosen for their 49 recorded reliefs often also make little sense if \\"signalling\\" to the general population was the intent, being high and remote, but often near water. The Neo-Assyrians recorded in other places, including metal reliefs on the Balawat Gates showing them being made, the carving of rock reliefs, and it has been suggested that the main intended audience was the gods, the reliefs and the inscriptions that often accompany them being almost of the nature of a \\"business report\\" submitted by the ruler.Kreppner, throughout; 368 for 49 reliefs A canal system built by the Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib (reigned 704‚Äì681 BC) to supply water to Nineveh was marked by a number of reliefs showing the king with gods.Kreppner, 371; Malko, Helen, \\"Neo-Assyrian Rock Reliefs: Ideology and Landscapes of an Empire\\", Metropolitan Museum, accessed 28 November 2015 Other reliefs at the Tigris tunnel, a cave in modern Turkey believed to be the source of the river Tigris, are \\"almost inaccessible and invisible for humans\\".Kreppner, 374‚Äì375 Probably built by Sennacherib's son Esarhaddon, Shikaft-e Gulgul is a late example in modern Iran, apparently related to a military campaign.Kreppner, 369‚Äì370; Van der Spek, R.J., \\"The Assyrian Royal Rock Inscription from Shikaft-i Gulgul\\", Iranica Antiqua, vol XII, 1977 The Assyrians added to the Commemorative stelae of Nahr el-Kalb in modern Lebanon, where Ramses II, Pharaoh of Egypt, had rather optimistically commemorated the boundary of his empire many centuries earlier; many later rulers added to the collection.Reade, 22; Grove The Assyrian examples were perhaps significant in suggesting the style of the much more ambitious Persian tradition, beginning with the Behistun relief and inscription, made around 500 BC for Darius the Great, on a far grander scale, reflecting and proclaiming the power of the Achaemenid empire.

Even in the 1870s excavators were often only regulated by a regime intended for mining operations, and had to pay a tax based on a proportion of the value of material removed.Reade, 11 The character of the palace reliefs made excavation relatively straightforward, if the right site was chosen. Assyrian palaces were built on high mud-brick platforms. Test trenches were started in various directions, and once one of them had hit sculpture, the trenches had only to follow the lines of the wall, often through a whole suite of rooms. Most trenches could be open to the sky, but at Nimrud, where one palace overlay another, tunnels were necessary in places.Reade, 9‚Äì12 Layard estimated \\"that he had exposed nearly two miles of sculptured walls in Sennacherib's palace alone\\", not to mention the Library of Ashurbanipal he found there.Reade, 14 His excavation practices left a lot to be desired by modern standards; the centres of rooms were not only not excavated, but the material removed from the trench in one room might be deposited in another, compromising later excavations.Oates, 5 Typically the slabs were sawn to roughly a third of their original depth, to save weight in carrying them back to Europe,Cohen & Kangas, 5 which was typically more complicated and difficult than digging them up.Reade, 11, 15-16 Botta Transporting a lamassu down the Tigris by raft, by Austen Henry Layard The first hint of future discoveries came in 1820 when Claudius Rich, British Resident (a sort of local ambassador or consul) in Bagdhad, and an early scholar of the ancient Near East, went to Mosul and the site of ancient Nineveh, where he was told of a large relief panel that had been found and soon broken up. His account was published in 1836; he also brought back two small fragments.Reade, 6; Oates, 1‚Äì2 In 1842 the French consul in Mosul, Paul- √âmile Botta, hired men to dig at Kuyunjik, the largest mound at Nineveh. Little was found until a local farmer suggested they try Khorsabad (ancient Dur-Sharrukin) nearby, where \\"a short trial was dramatically successful\\", as a palace of Sargon II was found a few feet below the surface, with plentiful reliefs, although they had been burned and disintegrated easily.Reade, 7; Oates, 3 Press reports of Botta's finds, from May 1843, interested the French government, who sent him funds and the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles- Lettres sent him Eug√®ne Flandin (1809‚Äì1889), an artist who had already made careful archaeological drawings of Persian antiquities in a long trip beginning in 1839. Botta decided there was no more to find at the site in October 1844, and concentrated on the difficult task of getting his finds back to Paris, where the first large consignments did not arrive until December 1846. Botta left the two huge lamassu now in the British Museum as too large to transport; Henry Rawlinson, by now British Resident in Bagdhad, sawed them into several pieces for transport in 1849.Reade, 7 In 1849 Monument de Ninive was published, a sumptuously illustrated and exemplary monograph in 4 volumes by Botta and Flandin. Layard and Rassam Entrance to the South West Palace at Nineveh during Layard's excavation, 1849‚Äì50 Austen Henry Layard (1817‚Äì1894) was in the early 1840s \\"a roving agent attached to the embassy at Constantinople\\", who had already visited Nimrud in 1840. In 1845 he persuaded Sir Stratford Canning, the ambassador in Constantinople, to personally fund an expedition to excavate there. On his first day digging at Nimrud, with only six workers in November 1845, slabs were found, initially only with inscriptions, but soon with reliefs. He continued to dig until June 1847, with the British government, through the British Museum, taking over the funding from Canning in late 1846, repaying his expenditure. The volume of finds was such that getting them back to Britain was a major task, and many pieces either were reburied, or reached other countries. Layard had recruited the 20-year old Hormuzd Rassam in Mosul, where his brother was British Vice- consul, to handle the pay and supervision of the diggers, and encouraged the development of his career as a diplomat and archaeologist.Reade, 9‚Äì12; Oates, 2‚Äì6 Layard returned to England in June 1847, also taking Rassam, who he had arranged to study at Cambridge. He left a few workers, mainly to keep other diggers off the sites, as the French were digging again. His finds were arriving in London, to great public interest, which he greatly increased by publishing a string of books, especially Nineveh and its Remains in 1849. The mistaken title arose because Henry Rawlinson had at that point become convinced that the Nimrud site was actually the ancient Nineveh, though he changed his mind soon after.Oates, 6‚Äì8; Reade, 12 By October 1849 Layard was back in Mosul, accompanied by the artist Frederick Cooper, and continued to dig until April 1851, after which Rassam took charge of the excavations.Reade, 12‚Äì14 By this stage, thanks to Rawlinson and other linguists working on the tablets and inscriptions brought back and other material, the Assyrian cuneiform was at the least becoming partly understood,Hoving, 40 a task that progressed well over the next decade. Initially Rassam's finds dwindled, in terms of large objects, and the British even agreed to cede the rights to half the Kuyunjik mound to the French, whose new consul, Victor Place, had resumed digging at Khorsabad. The British funds were running out by December 1853, when Rassam hit upon the palace of Ashurbanipal, which was \\"in some respects the finest sculptured palace of all\\", in the new French area of Kuyunjik. Fortunately, Place had not started digging there, and according to Rassam \\"it was an established rule that whenever one discovered a new palace, no one else could meddle with it, and thus,... I had secured it for England\\".Reade, 14‚Äì15 The new palace took until 1855 to clear, being finished by the Assyrian Exploration Fund, established in 1853 to dig for the benefit of British collections.Reade, 14‚Äì15 Lamassu or shedu, a human-headed winged bull, Dur- Sharrukin/Khorsabad.

Work has continued up to the present day, but no new palaces have been found at the capitals, and finds have mostly been isolated pieces, such as Rassam's discovery in 1878 of two of the Balawat Gates. Many of the pieces reburied have been re-excavated, some very quickly by art dealers, and others by the Iraqi government in the 1960s, leaving them on display in situ for visitors, after the sites were configured as museums. These were already damaged in wars in the 1990s,Reade, 16‚Äì17, 16 quoted and have probably been systematically destroyed by Daesh in the 2010s.Iconic Ancient Assyrian Sites Ravaged in ISIS's Last Stand in Iraq, by Kristin Romey, AINA repeating National Geographic Collections As a result of the history of excavations, much the best single collection is in the British Museum, followed by the site museums and other collections in Iraq, which in the 20th century were the largest holdings when taken together,Reade, 5; Grove though after the wars of the 21st century their current holdings are uncertain. The fate of the considerable number of pieces that have been found and then reburied is also uncertain. At the peak of excavations, the volume found was too large for the British and French to manage, and many pieces either were diverted at some point on their journey to Europe, or were given away by the museums. Other pieces were excavated by diggers working for dealers. As a result, there are significant groups of large lamassu corner figures and palace relief panels in Paris, Berlin, New York, and Chicago.Reade, 5; Grove Many other museums have panels, especially a group of college museums in New England, with the museum at Dartmouth College having seven panels.Hood Museum of Art, collection search on \\"Assyrian\\" Altogether there are some 75 pieces in the United States.Hoving, 40 Apart from the British Museum, in the United Kingdom, the Ashmolean Museum has 10 reliefs (2 large, 8 small) Ashmolean pageBristol City Museum and Art Gallery has 3 large reliefs,Bristol page and the National Museum of Scotland (2.4 x 2.2 m),Edinburgh, Assyrian Relief Fact File and Victoria and Albert Museum one relief each.Assyrian Relief at V&A; NotesReferences *Cohen, Ada, Kangas, Stephen E., Assyrian Reliefs from the Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, 2010, University Press of New England, *Frankfort, Henri, The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient, Pelican History of Art, 4th ed 1970, Penguin (now Yale History of Art), *\\"Grove\\": Russell, John M., Section 6. \\"c 1000‚Äì539 BC., (i) Neo-Assyrian.\\" in Dominique Collon, et al. \\"Mesopotamia, ¬ßIII: Sculpture.\\" Grove Art Online, Oxford Art Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 19 November 2016, subscription required *Hugh Honour and John Fleming, A World History of Art, 1st edn. 1982 (many later editions), Macmillan, London, page refs to 1984 Macmillan 1st edn. paperback. *Hoving, Thomas.

Entering service in 1941, the ship took part in the Battle of the Atlantic and the Battle of the Saint Lawrence as a convoy escort. Following the war, the minesweeper was decommissioned and placed in reserve. Reacquired during the Korean War, Mahone was never recommissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy and was instead sold to the Turkish Navy in 1958. Renamed Beylerbeyi, the minesweeper remained in service until 1972 when she was discarded. Design and description A British design, the Bangor-class minesweepers were smaller than the preceding s in British service, but larger than the in Canadian service.Chesneau, p. 64Macpherson and Barrie, p. 167 They came in two versions powered by different engines; those with a diesel engines and those with vertical triple-expansion steam engines. Mahone was of the latter design and was larger than her diesel-engined cousins. Mahone was long overall, had a beam of and a draught of . The minesweeper had a displacement of . She had a complement of 6 officers and 77 enlisted. Mahone had two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The minesweeper could carry a maximum of of fuel oil. Mahone was armed with a single quick-firing (QF) /40 caliber Mk IV gun mounted forward. For anti-aircraft purposes, the minesweeper was equipped with one QF 2-pounder Mark VIII and two single-mounted QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns. As a convoy escort, Mahone was deployed with deployed with 40 depth charges launched from two depth charge throwers and four chutes.Macpherson, p. 19 Operational history=War service The minesweeper was ordered as part of the 1939‚Äì40 construction programme. The ship's keel was laid down on 13 August 1940 by North Vancouver Ship Repairs Ltd. at their yard in North Vancouver, British Columbia. Mahone was launched on 14 November 1940 and commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy at Vancouver on 29 September 1941.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 171 The minesweeper left Esquimalt, British Columbia on 11 November for the East Coast of Canada. Mahone arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia on 11 December and was assigned to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) as a convoy escort. In May 1942, the vessel transferred to Halifax Force, the local escort force operating out of Halifax. The ship remained with the unit until January 1943 when Mahone began a refit on 19 January at Liverpool, Nova Scotia. The refit was completed on 3 April 1943 and Mahone was assigned to Gasp√© Force, the patrol and convoy escort group assigned to protect convoys in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Saint Lawrence River. This transfer was due to increased activity by German U-boats in those bodies of water. In September 1943, Mahone was among the warships deployed as part of the Canadian force to break up Operation Kiebitz, the German plan to breakout prisoner of war U-boat captains from a camp in Canada.Sarty, p. 251 Mahone was among those sent to intercept the U-boat as it entered Chaleur Bay to rescue the prisoners. The submarine sighted the warships before entering the harbour and broke off the attempt before it could be intercepted.Douglas et al., A Blue Water Navy, p. 96 In November 1943 Mahone was reassigned to Halifax Force and then transferred to Sydney Force, the local patrol and escort force operating from Sydney, Nova Scotia. On 29 January 1944, the minesweeper was rammed by the merchant vessel off Louisburg, Nova Scotia. Repairs done at Halifax took four months to complete. After working up in Bermuda, the vessel returned to Halifax in July 1945 and remained in service there until being paid off on 6 November 1945. The vessel was taken to Shelburne, Nova Scotia and laid up there. Postwar service In 1946, Mahone was placed in strategic reserve and taken to Sorel, Quebec. During the Korean War, the vessel was reacquired by the Royal Canadian Navy and given the new hull number FSE 192 and re-designated a coastal escort.Blackman, p. 99 However, the ship never recommissioned and remained in reserve at Sydney until 29 March 1958 when Mahone was formally transferred to the Turkish Navy. The minesweeper was renamed Beylerbeyi and remained in service with the Turkish Navy until being discarded in 1972. The vessel was broken up in Turkey in 1972.

It has rough, hard, fissured \\"ironbark\\", lance-shaped to curved adult leaves that are distinctly paler on the lower surface, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and hemispherical to cup-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus decolor is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has hard, dark grey fissured \\"ironbak\\" on the trunk and larger branches, white to pinkish bark on the thinner branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have narrow lance-shaped leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, distinctly paler on the lower surface, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on a branching inflorescence with the buds in groups of seven on each branch. The groups are on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are spindle-shaped to diamond-shaped, about long and wide with a conical operculum. Flowering occurs from December to March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody hemispherical to cup-shaped capsule long and wide on a pedicel long. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus decolor was first formally described in 1989 by Anthony Bean and Ian Brooker from a specimen that Bean collected on Mount Castletower near Port Curtis. The description was published in the journal Austrobaileya. The specific epithet (decolor) is a Latin word meaning \\"discolored\\" or \\"faded\\", referring to the pale underside of the leaves. Distribution and habitat This eucalypt is only known from a few small populations, mostly in hilly and mountainous country in south-east Queensland. Conservation status Eucalyptus decolor is classed as \\"near threatened\\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992. The main threats to the species are land clearing and inappropriate fire regimes.

The plot area was about and bordered a length of on the Atlantic Ocean. It was one of the largest and most expensive homes in the United States. The neoclassical palace had an area of and its outbuildings an area of . Maison de L'Amiti√© had three outbuildings: a barn and two houses for guests plus a pool and hot tub. Besides the pool there was an outbuilding with two bedrooms and bathroom. A coach house was located next to the entrance gate, and the third outbuilding was located on the edge of a courtyard. The estate also included a tennis house. The home was demolished in 2016. Interior Maison de L'Amiti√© had 18 bedrooms, 22 bathrooms, a ballroom, a media room and an art gallery Behind the door was a room with an area of with large windows offering a view of the ocean. The rooms had 18- to 36-feet high ceilings and were finished with marble and granite. Gold and diamonds were used in the bathrooms. The kitchen had mahogany furniture and stainless steel appliances. Maison de L'Amiti√© also had a garage which fits nearly 50 cars. During a tour of the property in 2007, reporter Jose Lambiet noted shortcuts and flaws, including suspiciously thin, bulletproof hurricane windows and gold fixtures in the bathrooms that were only painted gold. Lambiet said that the property had persistent mold and was difficult to air condition. History The property of Maison de L'Amiti√© was formerly owned by Dun & Bradstreet family member Robert Dun Douglass. It was sold to tycoon Harrison Williams in 1930. Owner Jayne Wrightsman sold the house on May 1, 1985, for $10 million to Les Wexner. Three years later, on May 27, 1988, it was sold to Massachusetts nursing home magnate Abraham \\"Abe\\" D. Gosman for $12,089,500. Gosman built the Maison de L'Amiti√© mansion on the property. On July 30, 1999, the house was put in the name of his wife, Linda C. Gosman. After Abe Gosman filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation in 2003, the property went up for auction in 2004. On January 7, 2005, entrepreneur Donald Trump bought the home for $41.35 million outbidding Jeffrey Epstein. Trump listed the home in early 2006 for $125 million. An employee of Trump Properties in Florida said that Trump had spent $25 million on renovations, while Trump himself claimed to have spent around $3 million renovating the house. In March 2008, after cycling through several real estate brokers, Trump lowered the asking price to $100 million. On July 16, 2008, Trump sold the home to Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev through his County Road Property LLC, for $95 million. At the time it was the most expensive residential property sale to ever occur in the United States. The Rybolovlevs had tried to secure a $25 million discount for the property. Rybolovlev purchased the home with a trust. During divorce proceedings for the Rybolovlevs, Dmitry denied direct or indirect ownership of the house in a 2011 deposition. The house remained empty since the purchase. In 2013, a Palm Beach County appraisal of the house valued it at $59.8 million. Rybolovlev said in 2013 that he wanted to demolish the house. He described it as an opportunity to divide the land into smaller plots. A plan to demolish the residence was approved by the Palm Beach architectural commission in April 2016. The Palm Beach Town Council approved a proposal to subdivide the property into three parcels of around two acres each. One parcel of sold for $34.34 million.

Content In These Memories Won't Last, Stu Campbell describes his experiences from when his grandfather was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. In the webcomic, Campbell recounts how he spent parts of his youth listening to his grandfather's childhood memories and old war stories, before going on to describe how these stories began to fade as his grandfather's condition developed. As the reader scrolls down the page, earlier panels begin to disappear making re-reading the webcomic difficult, mimicking the effects of the disease. Campbell tells mournful anecdotes of his grandfather experiencing severe paranoia and calling him by his cousin's name. The webcomic was created in HTML5 in order to work on web browsers and features a large amount of subtle visual effects. Foggy clouds drift across the screen as the reader scrolls down the page and an atmospheric soundtrack was composed by Lhasa Mencur. A rope twists around the panels of the webcomic, connecting elements of the story. As the grandfather's mind deteriorates, the rope becomes tangled and knotted, ensnaring individual elements of his memory. Some panels and text are crystal clear when these are out of sync, but when the reader scrolls to line them up properly, they get a misty appearance. Scrolling backwards is fruitless, as previous panels become hidden in a white fog. Development Campbell created These Memories Won't Last during his stay at Vienna's Air 15 artist residency. In an interview with CNET, Campbell explained that he had been experimenting with incorporating interactive elements in digital comics for a while at that point, in order to find new ways to invoke a feeling for his story. Campbell's previous works Modern Polaxis, Neomad, and Nawlz were similarly enhanced through digital means. The slowly fading panels of These Memories Won't Last were intended to create a sense of urgency to read the story before time runs out. Campbell wrote his webcomic in part to preserve the memories of his grandfather. Though browser updates have shown to often break the functionalities of the page, Campbell stated that reaching an audience through computers and smart devices was something he deemed important. Campbell said to CNET that he hopes that the story of his grandfather and the digital presentation of his work \\"shows the fragility of memory and makes us question how we choose to preserve it.\\" These Memories Won't Last was published in December 2015. Its soundtrack was designed by Lhasa Mencur, and it was programmed by Vitaliy Shirokiy. Reception These Memories Won't Last was nominated for an Eisner Award in the \\"Digital Comics\\" category in 2016. Caitlin Rosberg of Paste Magazine stated that These Memories Won't Last uses motion and music to \\"ensnare\\" the reader‚Äôs attention and force them to actively engage with the webcomic. Michelle Starr of CNET said that, as a \\"story of fading memories told in a fading medium,\\" These Memories Won't Last is particularly poignant, asking questions of how stories should be preserved and remembered. Minna Sundberg of NPR noted that though Cambell's \\"goofy\\" art style doesn't seem suited for the melancholy plot at first, the latter actually works really well with the over- exaggerated features and fantastical images. Noting the brittle nature of the work, Sundberg described These Memories Won't Last as a \\"fragile gem\\". The Hindu stated in 2018 that the webcomic \\"offer[s] an experience that cannot be reproduced in print,\\" calling it \\"a homage to the unique opportunities offered by technology.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Infinite canvas webcomics Category:2010s webcomics Category:Alzheimer's disease Category:2015 webcomic debuts ","title":"These Memories Won't Last"},{"id":"52169581","text":"This is a list of cricketers who have played first-class, List A or Twenty20 cricket for Rajasthan cricket team.

Description and history The Solomon Goodrich Homestead stands in a rural area of central Georgia, on the west side of US 7 north of its junction with Reynolds Road. The homestead consists of two conjoined structures, one brick and the other framed in timber. The main block is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with a side gable roof and two end chimneys. The main facade is five bays, with a center entrance and windows that are simply framed and topped by brick lintels. Attached to the rear of this block is an older 1-1/2 story wood-frame structure. Its framing consists of ax-hewn timbers. with The house was built by Solomon Goodrich, one of Georgia's early settlers. Its oldest section appears to date to about 1786, not long after Goodrich arrived in the area, and the brick main block was built in the early 19th century, after a brickyard and sawmill had been established in the town. The older portion was thereafter historically used as a summer kitchen, and was probably used in farm-related operations such as the production of butter. The farm property remained in the Goodrich family until 1854, and was for many years owned and operated by the Ballards.

He attended Syracuse University on an art scholarship. After college he served in the Army Air Corps as a weather scout. In 1958 Payne began working for The Charlotte Observer as their first cartoonist. He was their full time cartoonist from 1960‚Äì1971. Publisher Rolfe Neil said Payne \\"Had a loyal following of readers, particularly people interested in local issues and local government.\\" He won the 1967 Sigma Delta Chi Award for a cartoon of President Lyndon B Johnson on a bus holding a crying baby labeled \\"Vietnam War\\" while the bus driver said \\"Dr. King says, would you please move to the back of the bus\\". The cartoon implied that the Vietnam War was secondary to civil rights issues in America. In 1968 Payne won the Pulitzer Prize for a group of ten cartoons that focused on the Vietnam War and Civil Rights Issues. One of Payne's most famous cartoons was the one he drew in 1965 marking the death of Winston Churchill. It showed Churchill in a hat with a big cigar rising above the earth with his right hand forming a \\"V\\" for victory. The Charlotte Observer sold more than 8,000 reprints of the cartoon. After an eleven year stint with the Charlotte Observer Payne went to work at WSOC-TV as an editorial cartoonist. Until 1978 he drew cartoons, wrote and directed documentaries for the station. In 1978 he returned to the Charlotte Observer where he drew four cartoons per week. As he grew older that number decreased to one cartoon a week. His last cartoon was published in 2009. Payne died in 2010 at the age of 91.

It was first published as a novel in 1926, after having been initially serialized in the journal Bangabani. The book is set in British-occupied India. Content The book is about a secret society named Pather Dabi whose goal is to free India from British rule.And Sarat Chandra chattopadhyay played a great role for making a Revolutionary mind in young Indians,which gives an effort to the Indians to free from this Torture by British.Sharat Chandra chattopadhyay helped to create an independent consciousness among the Indians.And he also mentioned that independence is the only way to save Indians and also mentioned that proper relationship is not only family relations but also a relation with anyone who is struggling to save India from the British rule, through the words of his novel.The leader of the organization is Sabyasachi Mallick, who is described as being highly educated, having studied medicine, engineering, and law in Europe and America. Sabyasachi is also endowed with physical strength and courage which enable him to elude British intelligence. His physical feats include swimming across a torrential river, and traversing the Eastern Himalayas on foot. Another major character, Apurba , a member of Pather Dabi, described as a contemptible figure. Emotional and impressionable, Apurba grieves at the colonial rule. He is, however, also weak, timid, and venal. A scene in the book depicts him being humiliated at a railway station by white youth. His obsession with caste purity even during illness and danger is depicted with contempt. Eventually, Apurba becomes a police informer. The main narrative in the book follows Apurba with Sabyasachi appearing unexpectedly, and disappearing as mysteriously. Sabyasachi does not believe in the caste system, and towards the end of the book pleads for the destruction of \\"all that is eternal (sanatan), ancient, and decaying--[in] religion, society, tradition\\" on the ground that these are \\"enemies of the nation.\\" Other important characters in the novel are Sumitra and Bharati, who work alongside men in defiance of the traditional social conventions of the day. Sumitra is described as being beautiful and intelligent, besides being a nationalist. In the book, Sumitra makes an impassioned argument for why it is appropriate for a woman to leave a loveless marriage. According to a review of the book in the Indian Express: Reception *The first edition of the book, comprising 5,000 copies, was sold out within a week. Subsequent to this, the book was banned on 4 January 1921 by British Government after due consultation of the then Advocate General of West Bengal. *Tanika Sarkar, while analyzing the character of Sabyasachi, has observed: \\"Capable, literally of everything, [Sabyasachi] is the first superman in serious Bengali fiction, always a million times larger than life. *It has been suggested that Sabyasachi's usage of various disguises to escape police detection have conspicuous parallels with the modus operandi of Surya Sen. Sarat Chandra and Tagore A correspondence between Sarat Chandra and Rabindranath Tagore took place after the ban imposed on the book. Tagore justified the ban on the book, on the ground that it was a seditious book, while Sarat justified his book on the ground that \\"throughout India, large numbers of people are being imprisoned or externed by the government on flimsy grounds without trial or in flagrant miscarriage of justice.\\" Sarat agreed with Tagore's assessment that the book caused the reader to become disenchanted with the British government, stating that this indeed was his intention in writing it. Film The 1977 film Sabyasachi (film), starring Uttam Kumar, is based on this book. The co starrer were Tarun Kumar, Bikash Roy, Supriya Choudhury.

The title I Am Seven represents a \\"fresh start\\" and serves as his reintroduction. Music structure Seven took part in the songwriting, composing, and record production of all tracks on I Am Seven, a first in his career. Musically, the record encompasses R&B;, pop, dance, and funk. \\"Give It to Me\\" is described as a \\"retro\\" funk song coupled with acoustic brass. Written in midst of his military service, \\"I'm Good\\" is slow-tempo R&B; track. Release and promotion A music video teaser for the song \\"I'm Good\\" was released on July 6, 2016; the full music video was published on the following day. I Am Seven was announced as Seven's third mini-album on the September 29, with a release date of October 14, four years and eight months after his previous release Seven New Mini Album (2012). On October 2, Seven previewed the lead single in Busan at the One Asia K-pop Concert. The music video teaser for \\"Give It to Me\\" was published on October 11. I Am Seven and the music video for \\"Give It to Me\\" were simultaneously released on October 14. Initiating the day prior, Seven began promoting the song by performing it on weekly music chart shows, including Mnet's M Countdown, Korean Broadcasting System's (KBS) Music Bank, Seoul Broadcasting System's (SBS) Inkigayo, SBS MTV's The Show, and MBC Music's Show Champion. Critical reception Writing for TV Daily, Kim Ji-ha commended I Am Seven for its \\"impressive\\" and \\"addictive\\" beats and melodies; Kim Han-gil described the record as being \\"filled with high-quality songs\\", which allowed Seven to create a \\"unique ambience\\". Rating the mini-album two and a half stars out of five, Lee Jong-min of Diffsound described it as a \\"reckless challenge\\" which resulted in a \\"crushing defeat\\". Due to his military scandal, the mini-album received negative sentiments on online music stores, where netizens contributed to the album's low ratings. Commercial performance On the chart dated October 9‚Äì15, 2016, I Am Seven debuted at number eight on the Gaon Album Chart. By the end of the month, the record sold 4,285 copies in South Korea. In Japan, the mini-album debuted at number 245 on the weekly Oricon Albums Chart, selling 226 copies in its first week. It sold an additional 269 copies in its second week, ranking at number 233.

It formerly affected taxation, but the concept of ordinary residence was abolished for the purposes of tax years 2013/14 onwards. Related concepts Indefinite leave to remain and Right of abode are related concepts in immigration law. A person who is a British Citizen is not necessarily an ordinary resident in the UK. The policy relates to the Home Office hostile environment policy. Guidance The official guidance issued to the NHS states: A person is ordinarily resident if they are normally residing in the UK (apart from temporary or occasional absences), and their residence here has been adopted voluntarily and for settled purposes as part of the regular order of their life for the time being, whether for short or long duration. The Guidance on implementing the overseas visitor hospital charging regulations 2015 extends to 131 pages, with a further 12 pages of guidance on Ways in which people can be lawfully resident in the UK. It is intended to assist NHS bodies in carrying out their duties under the regulations to make and recover charges for NHS hospital treatment from chargeable overseas visitors. HM Revenue and Customs issued guidance (booklet HMRC 6) in respect of taxation which included reference to renting, leasing or buying property. This is not mentioned in the NHS guidance. The concept is also embedded in the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) (Scotland) Regulations 1989. Law \\"Ordinarily resident\\" has not been defined by Act of Parliament. It has been developed in caselaw. The leading case is R V. Barnet London Borough Council, Ex parte Nilish Shah, which was decided by the House of Lords in 1982. The case was concerned with the meaning of ‚Äòordinary residence‚Äô as used in the Education Acts. The five appellants were all students who had come to the UK to study. None of them had the right of abode in the United Kingdom. It established these principles: Ordinary residence is established if there is a regular habitual mode of life in a particular place \\"for the time being\\", \\"whether of short or long duration\\", the continuity of which has persisted apart from temporary or occasional absences. The residence must be voluntary and adopted for \\"a settled purpose\\". A person can be ordinarily resident in more than one country at the same time. This is not the case in respect of domicile. Ordinary residence is proven more by evidence of matters capable of objective proof than by evidence as to state of mind. Administration in the NHS In October 2016 it was reported that the government had set a target of recovering ¬£500 million a year from overseas visitors treated in NHS hospitals in England, which had been \\"refined\\" to ¬£346m for 2017-18, according to the National Audit Office. ¬£289m was collected in 2015-16 and ¬£73m in 2012-13. The NAO reported that only 58% of hospital doctors knew some people were chargeable for NHS healthcare at all. According to Joseph Meirion Thomas, a former cancer specialist at the Royal Marsden Hospital failure to enforce the charging regulations is costing the British taxpayer ¬£3 billion a year. =Ireland= In the Republic of Ireland there is a similar concept. People who have lived in the Republic for a minimum of one year or intend to live there for a minimum of one year qualify for help with prescription charges.

The park is along the sandstone and limestone bluffs of the Wapsipinicon River, from which it derives its name. It is one of the oldest state parks in Iowa, and it was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Description The initial for the park was donated by a local citizens group that raised around $23,000 in 1921 to buy the land in order to preserve it and to keep the timber from being logged. The park was dedicated in 1923, making Wapsipinicon one of the first state parks established in Iowa. The park has several archaeological sites where evidence of Pre-Columbian era societies lived. Two historic bridges that cross the river are also part of the park's historic nature, including the Hale Bridge, which was moved here in 2006. The facilities in the park were developed in the 1920s and the 1930s utilizing the Rustic style of architecture. Unlike many state parks in Iowa from this era that had their facilities built by the Civilian Conservation Corps, a public work relief program during the Great Depression, Wapsipinicon's facilities were constructed by prisoners from nearby Anamosa State Penitentiary. They built the shelters, stone arch bridges and the roads. The limestone for the structures was quarried locally, and it took about five years to complete the construction. In the years following the inmates continued to maintain the park. The park's recreational activities include camping, fishing and boating. Trails are provided for hiking, cross country skiing and snowmobiling. There are also a couple of caves to explore, including an ice cave. The park is a terminus for the Northeast State Park Bike Route, which connects it to Pikes Peak State Park and Backbone State Park by way of county highways. Hunting is allowed in season in an adjacent that was acquired in 1990. A nine-hole golf course in the park is maintained by the Wapsipinicon Country Club.

Key features  * Screening data at first level and to identify inconsistencies * More the data is found, more are the chances of fraud level * Data sources are used which include intelligence for smart detection * Prioritising investigations depending upon fraud level. Closed user group (CUG) Presently, Experian maintains a network of 112 financial institutions and 21 life insurer companies as a part of the CUG, that covers 70 per cent of the retail banking applications whose data is verified timely. With increase in these numbers, it can become a more complicated and secured database.  Methodology  There are various criteria based on which information is matched in the loan application from different data sources and inconsistencies after that are identified. The company has some sophisticated analytical solutions which allows it to create an advanced analytical approach, to predict and calculate some authentic score that can help banks lower their losses. A data repository has been created to collect the data of all the past customers in addition to their KYC norms data, on which data mining is performed to filter out the useful minute details and extrapolate the user's data. The solution has some customised rules to analyse different data sources to highlight inconsistencies and discrepancies so that it can match with the known fraud data. The results calculate the level of fraud risk and any application if found suspicious is moved into a special investigation tool to take further action. Under Section 45 of the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act, if three years duration is crossed for any reason to reject an insurance claim then it can not be rejected after that period. So, this repository would help them catch criminals before they breach the obstacles to commit fraud. Data from life insurers reveals that there is about 20 per cent rise year by year in fraudulent claims. A nexus has been identified of fraudulent people who get their claims passed through their relatives in the authorities which pass the claims. Depending on the screening, businesses will be able to identify applications that have high probability of potential fraud.

For over 25 years, she worked on human rights in many contexts, including the United Nations at Geneva and the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. She reported on human trafficking, statelessness, sexual minorities, detention and torture. A fluent Russian speaker, Marjorie covered the Soviet Union from 1978 to 1992. After the breakup of the USSR in December 1991 she dealt with similar issues in Russia, Ukraine and all five Central Asian states. She also spent a year covering the aftermath of Yugoslavia's disintegration, monitoring human rights violations in Bosnia Herzegovina.  Early life and education  Marjorie Farquharson was born in Glasgow on 11 August 1953, one of Nellie Milne and Alexander Farquharson's three children. She studied from 1971 to 1976 at St Andrews University in Fife, Scotland, first visiting Moscow as a student in 1975. The following year she was awarded two prizes by the university ‚Äî the Departmental Prize for Russian and the James Steuart University Prize for Economics ‚Äî and graduated with a first class MA degree in Soviet Political Sciences. (Retrieved 8 March 2019). Life's Work=Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenko: Stagnation in the USSR, 1978-1984 In 1978, Marjorie started working with Amnesty International in London as a researcher on the USSR. She was responsible for building up contacts for information among unofficial and official sources and writing Amnesty International's primary research materials on the region, based on her own assessment of the reliability of the material. A key source of information about human rights violations in the Soviet Union, by reason of its \\"scope, detail and accuracy\\", was A Chronicle of Current Events, an underground bulletin \\"produced regularly in typewritten samizdat form inside the Soviet Union and circulated on the chain-letter principle\\" between April 1968 and August 1983.A Chronicle of Current Events, No 55 (31 December 1979), Amnesty International pdf, p. 138 (back cover). It appeared in English from 1971 onwards, but Amnesty had ceased to publish the translated version of the Chronicle when Marjorie joined the organisation. Over the next six years, she helped oversee the prompt translation and publication of the Chronicle, and made sure that key \\"missing issues\\" from 1976-1977, which documented the emergence of the Helsinki Groups,\\"The Helsinki Groups\\", A Chronicle of Current Events, 43.6 (31 December 1976). and their treatment by the Soviet authorities, also appeared in English, even if at some delay, in January 1979.A Chronicle of Current Events, Nos 43-45, 31 December 1976, 16 March and 25 May 1977. As those whose fate was documented in the Chronicle and those who gathered the information it published came under increasing pressure, Marjorie's determination to make a wider circle of people aware of what was happening in the USSR ‚Äî during d√©tente, after the December 1979 invasion of Afghanistan, following the imposition of martial law in Poland (December 1981) ‚Äî proved wholly justified. The last issue of the Chronicle appeared in Moscow in August 1983.A Chronicle of Current Events, No 64, 30 June 1982. When she returned to Moscow in 1991 she met many of the dissidents and rights activists described in the pages of the Chronicle; later still she would write their obituaries for the British and Scottish press. Gorbachev: glasnost and \\"perestroika\\", 1985-1992 Marjorie saw the opportunity provided by Gorbachev's perestroika. In a memorandum of July 1989, she first proposed an AI outpost in Moscow and offered to go there herself to set it up. ‚Äú[I]n two or three years\\", she warned, \\"the tides of glasnost may well be turning in the USSR.\\"Ian Martin, Address at book launch of Moscow Diary, 5 September 2018. She devised Amnesty International's strategy towards the USSR and helped negotiate the organisation's transition towards dialogue with the authorities after 1985, without compromising Amnesty's own position on human rights. In May 1988 there was a meeting in Paris with Fedor Burlatsky, head of the official Public Commission for International Cooperation on Humanitarian Affairs and Human Rights set up by Gorbachev's Politburo. Shevardnadze's Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Adamishin came to London in January 1989 and during his stay paid what he called \\"a symbolic visit\\" to Amnesty's International Secretariat.Ian Martin, 2018. During these numerous preliminary meetings Marjorie secured agreement to the first official publication by Amnesty International in Russian: When the State Kills, a book about capital punishment, appeared in 1989.When the State Kills: the Death Penalty against Human Rights, edited with a preface by Professor Sophia Kelina, Moscow: Progress publishers, 1989.

In January 1991, Marjorie went to Moscow to set up an Amnesty office, the first time the organisation had a presence anywhere in the Soviet bloc. Within 15 months she managed to acquire, renovate and equip an office in the centre of Moscow and secure the organization's legal status. She promoted the notion of human rights in the press, radio and TV; she built up a wide range of contacts in Moscow, provincial Russia and the other Soviet republics. During the last five months of that visit, from November 1991 onwards, Marjorie wrote and broadcast a weekly programme about human rights on the national Radio Rossiya and organized Russia's first ever conference on the death penalty. Her campaigning there also exposed the continued political abuse of psychiatry. Halfway through this intense period came the attempted August coup d'√©tat and the Soviet Union itself came to an end four months before Marjorie left Moscow. Bosnia, Moscow again, and the Council of Europe, 1993-2001 From 1993 to 1994, Marjorie worked as a Field Advisor to Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the Special Rapporteur on ex-Yugoslavia for the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. She monitored violations of human rights in Bosnia Herzegovina, during both the Bosnian-Croat and the Bosnian-Serb civil wars. She was responsible for providing speeches and documents monitoring the human rights situation based on research in the field (Sarajevo, Kiseljak, Bihac and Zagreb) and liaising with the inter- governmental community. Between 1994 and 1996, Marjorie returned to Moscow as European Community & UK Charities Aid Foundation Director of the TACIS NGO Support Unit. This operated within the framework of the European Union's Democracy Programme to develop Civil Society in the former USSR, helping the new Third Sector in Russia get on its feet. The project gave nearly five hundred NGOs practical training ‚Äî in fundraising; accountancy; project evaluation; media work and coalition building. It also provided original research in Russian on the local and west European non-governmental sectors. The project was graded 'A' by EU evaluators and passed to local ownership in 1996. From 1996 to 2001, Marjorie was Programme Advisor and Head of Sub-Region for the Council of Europe's Human Rights Directorate, and covered the Russian Federation & Ukraine after their accession to the Council of Europe. The programme helped establish human rights institutions; it analysed local laws to assess their compatibility with European human rights standards; it trained legal officials and NGOs to apply these standards directly; and it launched websites and reference books in local languages. As a Council of Europe officer Marjorie worked in over thirty of the constituent Regions of the Russian Federation and helped establish a system of regional ombudsmen for human rights. She also gained consultative status for some Russian NGOs at the Council of Europe. Even before Russia became an eligible party to the European Convention on Human Rights, she began organizing training seminars for Russian lawyers, educating them on litigation before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The programme liaised closely with the political organs of the Council of Europe ‚Äî the Parliamentary Assembly and the Committee of Ministers ‚Äî and with its judicial arm, the European Court of Human Rights. Local partners ranged from the Presidential Administration to NGOs in remote regions. An independent human rights consultant In 2001, Marjorie returned to her native Scotland and began to work as an independent human rights consultant. A year earlier, in an article entitled \\"The Freight and the Groove\\", she recalled and described what had happened to many well-known Soviet dissidents since the break-up of the USSR.\\"The Freight and the Groove\\" (2000). Her job took her all over Russia and to each of the five Central Asian States. She undertook numerous research projects for UNDP, UNHCR Statelessness in Central Asia, United Nations Human Rights Commissioner for Refugees, June 2011. and Amnesty InternationalThe Death Penalty in the Law and Practice of Tajikistan, , 2002, AI Index: EUR 69/008/2002Rough Justice: The Law and Human Rights in the Russian Federation, , 2003, AI Index: EUR 46/054/03 and gave her expert opinion on numerous cases involving asylum seekers in the UK. She was a contributor to Radio Free Europe2001-2003,RFE/RL. Inc and Index on Censorship.Index on Censorship, issue 4, 2005; issue 3, 2006.

Death and legacy  Despite the impact of multiple sclerosis, she campaigned for an independent Scotland within Europe on behalf of the Scottish National Party. In her countries of expertise (the five Central Asian states, Russia, Ukraine, Georgia and the three Baltic states) her style of work and relations with those whose conditions she sought to improve have been described in the following words: > \\"She advised on the funding and evaluation of various projects, travelling > extensively and alone to places with poor living conditions and at > considerable personal risk. Her unassuming and modest demeanour coupled with > her wide knowledge enabled people to trust her.\\" Marjorie Farquharson died in Edinburgh on 13 May 2016. Her Moscow Diary, the record she kept of the months during which she established Amnesty International's Information office in Moscow, was published posthumously in 2018.Marjorie Farquharson, Moscow Diary, Matador, 2018 Marjorie's work at that time, combined with her acute perception and entertaining style of writing, make this a very interesting account: it brings together insights into the politics of human rights and observations of the unusually wide range of people she then encountered. Her love of Russia, its language, culture and people accompanied her throughout her life. She liked reading and translating Russian authors, among them stories by Gogol and Bulgakov,in The Body in the Library: A Literary History of Modern Medicine, ed.by Iain Bamforth, Verso Books, 2003, and some of the prose of Osip Mandelstam\\"The Egyptian Persuasion\\" in Parnassus:Poetry in Review, Vol.33, No.1&No.2;, N.Y., 2013 and Khodasevich.

She was ordained a novice bhikkhuni on 10 February 2002 in Songdhammakalyani Monastery. The ceremony was attended by eight female monks from Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia. It was conducted in Sri Lankan tradition. Upon the ordination she adopted the name of Dhammarakhita Samaneri. The Abbess of the nunnery was Dhammananda Bhikkhuni (Professor Chatsumarn Kabilasinga), who is also the first Theravada bhikkhuni in Thailand. Dhammarakhita graduated with a business degree in Australia. As a lay person she worked as a secretary and translator. Before her ordination in 2002 Dhammarakhita had been a mae chii for nine years. Her ordination was surrounded by controversy and heated discussion in Thai media and politics due to the conservative views surrounding female ordination present in the country. The discussion was, however, less fierce than a year earlier when Dhammananda Bhikkhuni was ordained in Sri Lanka. In 2002 many newspapers supported the decision. Dhammarakhita defended her choice saying: \\"I know that there might be resistance. But I am prepared, knowing that I am doing the right thing.\\" The ordination has not been yet recognised by the Thai Buddhist religious authorities.  Private life  Dhammarakhita has two children.

Description and history The former National Clothespin Factory is located in an industrial area southeast of downtown Montpelier, on the north side of Granite Street between the railroad tracks and the Winooski River. The main building is a three-story wood frame structure, with a flat roof. It is twelve bays wide and two deep, with three asymmetrically placed entrances on the long street-facing facade, and a short tower at the northeast corner. Additions extend the building to the north, and there is a single-story shed-roofed office building between the main factory and the river. with The National Clothespin Company, founded in 1887, was one of two clothespin manufacturers in Montpelier, originally occupying space at One Main Street. It had this facility constructed in 1918, and operated here until 2003. Of a maximum of fifteen clothespin factories in the nation, it was the last to close down, the industry harmed by low-cost foreign competition and the advent of powered clothes dryers.

The lithological Protogine Zone is the boundary between the Sveconorwegian Orogen (in salmon) and the Transscandinavian Igneous Belt (in blue), the Svecofennian Orogen (in light yellow) and the Blekinge Province (in purple). The Protogine Zone is a geological boundary zone in western Sweden. There are two slightly different definitions of the Protogine Zone. In the lithological definition it forms the limit between the gneisses of western Sweden and the relatively underformed eastern granites. As such it makes up the limit of deformation and metamorphism attributed to the Sveconorwegian orogeny. In the tectonic definition it is a zone of strong deformation that follows roughly the same course as the lithological Protogine Zone. In the two definitions of the Protogine Zone it runs from Scania across Lake V√§ttern into the upper course of Klar√§lven and then into Norway. The tectonic Protogine Zone has anastomosing branches and splits south of Lake V√§ttern into various diverging arms. The two westernmost of these arms follow the valleys of the Nissan and Lagan rivers. A more eastern branch is reflected in the alignment of the lakes Rusken, Rymmen and M√∂ckeln. The origin of the Protogine Zone has been traced to the Mesoproterozoic when it was a zone of weakness in the crust. About 1575‚Äì1562 Ma ago the Progine Zone was intruded by mafic magma during the same time spans as Rapakivi granites intruded more easterly domains in Fennoscandia. Later 1224‚Äì1215 and ca. 1204 Ma ago the progine zone was subject to extensional tectonics perhaps being a back-arc basin. The Protogine Zone obtained its final configuration during the Sveconorwegian orogeny 1130‚Äì950 Ma ago.

A skeleton in the Iranian National Museum of Medical Sciences, Tehran A medical museum is an institution that stores and exhibits objects of historical, scientific, artistic, or cultural interest that have a link to medicine or health. Displays often include models, instruments, books and manuscripts, as well as medical images and the technologies used to capture them (such as X-ray machines). Some museums reflect specialized medical areas, such as dentistry, nursing, this history of specific hospitals, and historic pharmacies. Professional organisations of medical museums include the Medical Museums Association, who publish The Watermark (the quarterly publication of the Archivists and Librarians in the History of the Health Sciences), and The London Museums of Health & Medicine. History Many medical museums have links with medical training providers, such as medical schools or colleges, and often their collections were used in medical education. They were often private, \\"granting access only to students and practising physicians\\". The starting point of all considerations on the historical development of modern museums is contained in the solution of two problems; collecting problem and institutionalization problem.  Collecting  A collection is a precondition for the existence of a museum, and the collection and preservation of certain objects is a precondition for the creation of a collection. In this sense, collecting has often been the basis on which significant collections have been formed throughout history. Thus, e.g. collecting a wide variety of objects, from works of art, through scientific instruments, technical inventions to natural rarities, was closely linked to Roman conquests, which ... In addition to collecting rare and marvelous things, collectors also collected medical items, and so many artifacts were found not only in collectors' collections of doctors and pharmacists, but, more or less sporadically, in many offices, churches and even individual homes. This primarily refers to objects that have been attributed to magical, religious and therapeutic properties (relics, bezoars, corals and objects of Narwhal tusk), etc. Collections, which at the beginning of the development of human civilization was religious medicine, as one of the earliest represented forms of healing, in Mesopotamia in ancient Greece, the Roman Empire, etc., the first collectors' collections were formed even before the emergence of Renaissance cabinets of rarity - considered the forerunners of modern museums. Institutionalization Although collecting alone does not always and necessarily lead to its institutionalization, on the basis of current knowledge, studies on presenting the museum's past, these problems are interconnected. Accordingly, the museums of medicine have found out of individuals' preferences for collecting, which has most often been the basis on which significant medical collections have been formed throughout history, and subsequently the medical museums we know today.  First Museums  Similar to Aristotle's Lyceum, similar establishments were established in Alexandria, Pergamon, Syracuse, Sicily, and Rhodes, but of which Alexandria, known as the Museum of Alexandria, reached its greatest glory. Joseph James Chambliss, ed. Philosophy of Education : An Encyclopedia (New York & London: Garland Publishing, Inc .; 1996), 31.  Alexandria Museum  Alexandria, is the city where the empiricist school was founded, which also had its own medical collection One of the first museums to have a medical collection was a library established at Alexandria School of Medicine. Concerning the Library of Alexandria and the Medical Museum, there is doubt as to whether it was a unified institution or not. It is also uncertain whether their founder was Ptolemy I Soter 20 or his son Ptolemy Philadelphia. Also, the literature states that Demetrius of Phaleron, a peripatetic philosopher and disciple of Theophrastus, and perhaps Aristotle, who began to collect books for library from all over the world during the reign of Ptolemy I Soter, played an important role in the founding of the Library. . The idea of forming a library containing universal works is linked to the expansionist policy of Alexander the Great, which was close to the Ptolemies. Alexander believed that the domination of the world required learning about the thinking and languages of different civilizations through the study of their texts. Giovanni Di Pasquale, The Museum of Alexandria: Myth and Model , in From Private to Public: Natural Collections and Museums, ed. Marco Beretta (Sagamore Beach, MA: Science History Publications, 2005), 2. Not only mathematicians, physicists, astronomers, inventors and philosophers, such as Archimedes, Aristarchus of Samos, Euclid and Eratosthenes, have found fame in the Alexandrian Museum throughout history, but also physicians.

Within this Museum, the Alexandria Medical School was created and became famous for its achievements, especially in the field of anatomy and physiology. Heprophy, most likely influenced by the Egyptian tradition of body embalming, was the first physician to investigate the human body through autopsy and vivisection, establishing a scientific method and describing the structure of many organs. The Alexandriks Library was a treasure trove of about 700,000 written rolls (of all the richest human knowledge so far, the richest in the world). The museum in Alexandria was, as an integral part of an academy or university, a meeting place of different cultures, scientific debates and discoveries, a place of learning and \\"concentrating\\" the knowledge of the Hellenistic world, because, as Pomjan says, it was not a museum in today's sense of the word, and therefore \\"no owes its glory to no collection, but rather to its library and the team of scientists who have formed a community within its walls, \\" Pomian, Collectors and Curiosities, 13 though in terms of art collecting There are different opinions in the Alexandrian Museum. Mio rag Jovanovic, Museology and protection of cultural monuments Belgrade: Faculty of Philosophy / Plato, 1992, 19. Jelena Jovanovic Simic, Musealization of the History of Medicine in Serbia - doctoral thesis, University of the Belgrade, 2015. p. 21 When the Muslim army conquered Alexandria in 642, after defeating the Byzantine army at Battle of Heliopolis, the commander asked Caliph Umar what to do with the museum and library, or books. He gave the famous answer: \\"They are either contrary to the Koran, which means that they are heretical, or they agree with him, which means that they are superfluous.\\"  Rarity Cabinets  A rarity cabinet, or Italian studios, originated in the Renaissance cultural milieu and thus established a new model of collecting. As the Renaissance period was crucial for the development of medical sciences, primarily anatomy, which was still based on Galen's second-century teachings, medical subjects in the Renaissance offices were more numerous and varied than in medieval treasuries. In addition to mummified parts of the human body and skeletal remains, there were more and more medical and scientific instruments in the collections. Otherwise, the cabinet of rarities themselves was usually one or more square or rectangular rooms, interconnected, holding art and natural objects that had \\"rare and unusual features\\", with the division of collections into artistic ( and natural rarities (). Jelena Jovanoviƒá Simiƒá, Musealization of the History of Medicine in Serbia - PhD thesis, University of Belgrade, 2015. p. 27-32  Museums in the 19th and early 20th centuries  In the late 19th and early 20th century, a new concept of medical museums was developed, largely influenced by the development of education and industrialization, which, unlike education, had a detrimental effect on the life and health of the working class of the Western world. The industrialization of individual countries, accompanied by the increasing migration of population to large industrial centers, has resulted in the intensive development and consolidation of cities, as well as the increasingly ill, exposed to poor hygienic conditions in factories and workers' settlements. Under the new conditions, a stronger development of museums is occurring as part of the general culture and memory of a people, and among them the first medical museums aimed at the general public, among other things, with the aim of enlightening the population. In medical museums, visitors were required to acquire new knowledge about the structure of the human body, the functioning of organs and organ systems, and information about healthy lifestyles, infectious diseases and their prevention. In order to bring their exhibitions closer to the numerous visitors of different educational levels, interactive museum exhibits were used, using modern technical means of communication with the public - sound conferences with recorded contents, diaries and slides, films, models of the human body and more. Jelena T. Jovanovic Simic Mein Collections and Museums in Serbia: A Historical Review, Classification and Museological Conservation, FLOGISTON Journal of the History of Science No. 23 - 2015. p. 174. Ethical debates High profile medical exhibitions such as Body Worlds and Bodies: The Exhibition, have spurred debate as to the ethics and value of such displays. Historians such as Samuel Alberti have sought to place this \\"tension between education and sensation\\" into a broader historical context of freak shows and anatomy displays. Projects such as Exceptional & Extraordinary have engaged with such controversy and used it as a platform to \\"examine our attitudes towards difference and aim to stimulate debate around the implications of a society that values some lives more than others.\\"  See also  *List of medical museums *Hospital museum References Category:History of medicine ","title":"Medical museum"},{"id":"52170140","text":"Hajime Sakaki (August 28, 1856 ‚Äì February 6, 1897) was a Japanese physician and the first professor of psychiatry in that country. Though he was a proponent of biological psychiatry, Sakaki ran a Tokyo insane asylum and he made early attempts to introduce work therapy for confined psychiatric patients. Using field work and his study of patients in the asylum, Sakaki created a classification and diagnosis system for psychiatric disorders. Sakaki mentored Shuzo Kure, who became Sakaki's successor and ultimately advanced the institutionalization of the mentally ill. Education In the years just before Sakaki entered medicine, it had been common for Japanese medical schools to be staffed entirely by German professors. Japanese students began to travel to Germany for their medical training, and over time many of them returned to Japan to teach at the medical schools. The government of Japan funded Sakaki's psychiatry training in Germany from 1882 to 1886. In Germany, Sakaki was influenced by the lectures of physicians including Erwin B√§lz, Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal and Emanuel Mendel. His study of psychiatry was complemented by work on the histology of the central nervous system. Biological psychiatry was prominent in Europe, and Sakaki came to view mental illness as having organic underpinnings. Career Upon leaving Germany at the end of his training, Sakaki became the director of the Tokyo Public Asylum and the director of psychiatry for the medical school at the University of Tokyo. Though the asylum had been open since 1873, Sakaki was the institution's first physician, so he inherited a facility whose objective had long been to confine the mentally ill rather than to provide any treatment. Besides running the asylum, Sakaki created a system used for the diagnosis and classification of psychiatric illnesses. He used that system to facilitate research work into mental illness. In order to further the work he had done on classification of mental disorders, Sakaki led his psychiatry department and medical students in psychiatric field work in rural Japan. Based on experiences that he had while observing German asylums, Sakaki introduced work responsibilities to the patients in Japanese asylums. However, this work therapy was only assigned to certain patients, and the work opportunities were limited in comparison to later applications of it. Personal life Sakaki's younger brother, Yasuzabur≈ç Sakaki, was also a psychiatrist and was a professor at Kyushu University. The younger Sakaki was friends with Albert Einstein and he had a love for music, having founded the philharmonic orchestra at Kyushu University. Death and legacy Sakaki died unexpectedly in 1897, and one of his field work participants, Shuzo Kure, was selected as Sakaki's successor the next year. Kure also trained in Germany and he used the psychiatric classifications advanced by Emil Kraepelin. Kure also subscribed to Sakaki's beliefs in biological psychiatry even though Kraepelin held that biological psychiatry could not be proven valid. Kure later wrote the first published work in Japan on suicide. Insane asylums proliferated under Kure's influence, as Tokyo had eight of them by 1900. There were also liberal rules supporting the detention of the mentally ill by police officers. Kure was able to advance Sakaki's ideas for work therapy for institutionalized patients.

Life  The bat mitzvah was created to address Judaism's gender imbalance and is the female equivalent of a boy‚Äôs bar mitzvah, signifying entrance into religious majority. Judith, the oldest daughter of Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan (who was the founder of the Reconstructionist branch of Judaism), was the first person to celebrate a Bat Mitzvah publicly in America, which she did on March 18, 1922, aged 12, at her father‚Äôs synagogue the Society for the Advancement of Judaism in New York City.Waskow, Arthur Ocean and Phyllis Ocean Berman. Excerpt from A Time for Every Purpose Under Heaven Farrar, Straus and Giroux, LLC at Judith Kaplan recited the preliminary blessing, read a portion of that week's Torah portion in Hebrew and English, and then intoned the closing blessing. Her bat mitzvah was the first time that a woman led the congregation; as such it represents a significant shift for Judaism in America. Until this time women did not engage in public reading of the Torah and a Jewish girl's transition from child to adult was not reflected in synagogue ceremonies. Reflecting on the ceremony many years later she said: \\"No thunder sounded. No lightning struck.\\" \\"It all passed very peacefully\\". Bat mitzvah ceremonies are now commonplace within the Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist branches of Judaism. At the age of 82, Kaplan had a second bat mitzvah. Various feminist and Jewish leaders, including Betty Friedan, Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Ruth W. Messinger, and Elizabeth Holtzman were present. During her life she was an author, theologian, musicologist and composer. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Columbia University and studied at the Institute of Musical Art, now the Juilliard School. She published a book of children's music, \\"Gateway to Jewish Song,\\" and a number of cantatas on Jewish themes, including the popular \\"What Is Torah,\\" with her husband, Rabbi Ira Eisenstein whom she married in 1934. Her translations of Hebrew songs are now enjoyed by Jewish children throughout the US. She taught music education and the history of Jewish music at the Albert A. List College of Jewish Studies from 1929 to 1954. She taught at School of Sacred Music of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in New York from 1966 to 1979. She died on February 14, 1996, in Silver Spring, Maryland. Her papers are included in the Ira and Judith Kaplan Eisenstein Reconstructionist Archives of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College.

If activated to federal service, the unit is gained by the United States Air Force Air Combat Command.  Mission  It is the mission of the 241st to deploy, operate, and maintain Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS) in support of the state of Missouri, Air National Guard or United States Air Force Requirements. The 241st is one of only ten ANG Air Traffic Control Squadrons located throughout the United States available to deploy worldwide in support of operational forces at host nation or bare base locations and provide basic airfield services and combat airspace support to the Theater Air Operations Center (AOC). DATCALS provide the capability to identify, sequence, and separate aircraft; provide final approach guidance and control instructions to aircraft at deployed locations in all types of weather. DATCALS equipment and personnel can be employed to provide liaison, control tower, Radar Approach Control (RAPCON), precision landing capabilities, and mobile Tactical Air Navigation Aid (TACAN) services or any combination.  Personnel and equipment  AN/TRN-48 TACAN at the 241st Air Traffic Control Squadron headquarters building The 241st ATCS has numerous career fields including: Air Traffic Control, Airfield Systems, Ground Radar Systems, Electrical Power Production, Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC), Logistics Plans, Material Management Administrative, and Personnel. Major equipment utilized by the 241st ATCS includes: the AN/MSN-7, Mobile Tower; the AN/MPN-14K, Mobile RADAR; and the AN/TRN-48, Mobile TACAN.  History = Early years and the Balkans  The 241 Air Traffic Control Flight was given a change of station order in June 1996 from St. Louis to St. Joseph, Missouri. The 241 Air Traffic Control Flight was redesignated as the 241 Air Traffic Control Squadron in October 1996 and was extended federal recognition on 3 June 1997. Between 1994 and 2001, the 241st deployed personnel and Mobile Control Tower (MSN-7) to Quincy, IL. 7 times in support of the World Freefall Convention, the largest sky diving boogey (meet) in the United States. Members of the 241st were activated to Taszar AB, Hungary between the years of 1995 and 1996 in support of the Balkan crisis. This airlift was jointly performed with members from Cheyenne, Hawaii, and Oregon, and was the largest since Berlin. Between 1997 and 1998 members of the unit were activated to Taszar AB, Hungary as part of the 16th Air Expeditionary Wing, 406th EOSS, in support of the Balkan crisis. In 1999, 2 tower controllers were deployed to Balikesir Air Base, Turkey in support of Operation Noble Anvil, 2 Tower Controllers were deployed to Cervia, Italy and 1 Controller to Aviano AB, Italy in support of Operation Allied Force. 1 controller was deployed to Pordenone in support of Operation Allied Force and 3 Tower Controllers were deployed to Bandirma Air Base, Turkey in support of Operation Northern Watch.  Southern Watch and pre-9/11  In January 2000, four Air Traffic Controllers were deployed to Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Southern Watch, AEF 9. The Tower UTC supported the Fly-In for Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas in September 2000 with the intention of providing yearly support. The events of September 11th on the following year, however, would make the World Freefall Convention in August 2001 the last event of that kind the Squadron would support until 2007. In June 2001, the 241st became the last Air Traffic Control Squadron to successfully deploy a complete unit and pass an Operational Readiness Inspection. All other previous ATC Squadrons had performed home station ORIs or were unable to deploy with the RADAR for their inspections.  Enduring Freedom/Iraqi Freedom (2001‚Äì2005) In November 2001, a SMSgt from the 241st was deployed to Whiteman AFB in support of Operation Noble Eagle as a RADAR watch supervisor; he would be recalled back to Rosecrans in two short months later. On 13 January 2002, the 241st was the first Air Traffic Control Unit activated in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The Tower UTC was deployed to Bagram, Afghanistan where they would be directly be involved in Operation Anaconda. Simultaneously, the squadron also deployed 45 (Ops/MXS) members, led by Major Gerald Bramstedt, to Pakistan. Three months later, those members were redeployed to Bagram Afghanistan where they would remain until October of that year. The site was a \\"bare base operation\\" in which the field was handed over directly from special operations controllers and was the first time an MPN14K RADAR was redeployed in the history of the Air Force. Major Bramstedt would receive the Bronze Star for his actions there. MPN14K in Bagram Afghanistan In March 2003, three controllers were deployed to Kirkuk AB, Iraq. MSgt Letitia Whitaker received the Bronze Star for her work there, establishing the first air-control service in northern Iraq and supporting over 4,800 combat sorties, including covert operations, medical evacuations and humanitarian airlifts. She was the first woman in the Missouri Air National Guard to receive this decoration. Also in March 2003, three members were sent to Baghdad, Iraq in support of OIF. They served as part of a team that opened Saddam International Airport to operations again soon after it was captured. 241st Personnel were the first to operate Arrival and Precision Approach services into the newly reopened Baghdad International Airport. On 29 April 2003 CMSgt Neil Eayrs deployed for 90 days to CENTAF (US Air Forces, US Central Command) in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.

Johann Trump, born in Bobenheim in 1789, moved to the nearby village of Kallstadt where his grandson, Friedrich Trump, the grandfather of Donald Trump, was born in 1869.Verein f√ºr Computergenealogie: Vorfahren von Friederich \\"Fritz\\" Trump .Other spelling variants found in Kallstadt include Drumb, Tromb, Tromp, Trum, Trumpff, Dromb. Kate Connolly, Kallstadt, Germany: on the trail of 'the Donald' in the Trump ancestral home , The Guardian, January 29, 2016. (Blair 2001:26) cites Hanns Drumpf, recorded in 1608. This German heritage was long concealed by Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump, who had grown up in a mainly German-speaking environment until he was ten years old;Blair, The Trumps, p. 115. after World War II and until the 1980s, he told people he was of Swedish ancestry. Donald Trump repeated this version in The Art of the Deal (1987) but later said he is \\"proud\\" of his German heritage, and served as grand marshal of the 1999 German-American Steuben Parade in New York City.

During the Klondike Gold Rush, he amassed a fortune by opening a restaurant and hotel in Bennett and later Whitehorse, serving gold seekers on their way to the region; one biographer wrote that the business included a brothel, a portrayal Donald Trump has said was \\"totally false\\".

Heinz, founder of H. J. Heinz Company, whose father also came from Kallstadt. =Elizabeth Christ Trump= Donald Trump's grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, n√©e Christ, was born in 1880 and died on June 6, 1966.

Lippan or mud-washing using materials locally available in the region like mixture of clay and camel dung keeps the interiors of the houses cool. Though the work is limited mainly to the interior walls, it can be found on the outer walls as well. These scintillating murals bring life, gaiety, and beauty to generally harsh life of people of Kutch. Mud and Mirror Work is mainly done by the women of the Rabari community. The women are so experienced in this art form that they usually don‚Äôt draw or trace a pattern before beginning work. Rabari is the pastoral community of Kutch, living in the outskirts of its villages. They dwell in a few clusters of communal or family houses known as Bhungas which are designed and built to take care of their practical needs in the harsh climate of Kutch. This art form has a hoary past as no records are available to trace its origin. Various communities in Kutch do mud-washing in their own distinct style. Artisans of the Muslim community practicing this art form stick to graphic and eye-catching geometric patterns of lippan kaam, as depicting the human or animal form is considered deeply un-Islamic.

The most prominent riddle in the Bible is Samson's riddle: Samson outwitted the Philistines by posing a riddle about the lion and the beehive until they learned the answer from his Philistine bride, costing Samson 30 suits of clothes (Judges 14:5-18).Margalith, Othniel, \\"Samson's Riddle and Samson's Magic Locks\\", Vetus Testamentum 1986; 36, pp. 225-234 (p. 226) https://www.jstor.org/stable/1518382. However, some passages in the Book of Proverbs in which sets of three or four objects are mentioned (e.g. 30:15 et seq.) were likely originally in the form of riddles, while Ezekiel 17:1-10 is also a riddle of sorts.Joseph Jacobs, 'Riddle', in The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from the Earliest Times to the Present Day, ed. by Isidore Singer (New York: Funk & Wagnalls, 1901-1907) In post-Biblical and rabbinic literature Sirach mentions riddles as a popular dinner pastime. The Talmud contains several riddles, such as this one from the end of Kinnim: 'What animal has one voice living and seven voices dead?' ('The ibis, from whose carcass seven different musical instruments are made'). The Aramaic Story of Ahikar contains a long section of proverbial wisdom that in some versions also contains riddles.Archer Taylor, The Literary Riddle before 1600 (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1948), pp. 41-42. Solomon and the Queen of Sheba The Bible describes how the Queen of Sheba tests Solomon with riddles, but without giving any hint as to what they were.I Kings 10:1-13 On this basis, riddles were ascribed to the Queen in later writings. Four riddles are ascribed to her in the tenth- or eleventh-century Midrash Proverbs,Jacob Lassner, Demonizing the Queen of Sheba: Boundaries of Gender and Culture in Postbiblical Judaism and Medieval Islam. University of Chicago Press, 1993, pp. 9-17Christine Goldberg, Turandot's Sisters: A Study of the Folktale AT 851, Garland Folklore Library, 7 (New York: Garland, 1993), p. 24. including the following: 'She said to him: \\"Seven exit and nine enter, two pour and one drinks\\".

The early medieval Aramaic Targum Sheni also contains three riddles posed by the Queen to Solomon. In the Middle Ages Under the influence of Arabic literature in medieval al-Andalus, there was a flourishing of literary Hebrew riddles in verse during the Middle Ages. Dunash ben Labrat (920-990), credited with transposing Arabic metres into Hebrew, composed a number of riddles, firmly rooted, like folk-riddles, in describing everyday, physical objects.Archer Taylor, The Literary Riddle before 1600 (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1948), pp. 33-35, citing Nehemya Aluny, 'Ten Dunash Ben Labrat's Riddles', The Jewish Quarterly Review, New Series, 36 (1945), 141-46. His diwan includes a twenty-line poem comprising ten riddles, one of which runs: Subsequent exponents included Samuel ibn Naghrillah (born 993), the sixth section of whose philosophical verse collection Ben Mishlei (literally 'son of Proverbs', but more idiomatically 'after Proverbs') presents a series of philosophically inclined riddles.Samuel ibn Naghrƒ´la, Ben Mishlei, ed. by Dov Yarden (Jerusalem: Libov School of Graphic Arts, 1982).Sarah J. Pearce, The Andalusi Literary and Intellectual Tradition: The Role of Arabic in Judah Ibn Tibbon's Ethical Will (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2017), pp. 68-69 . The subjects of his riddles generally remained concrete ‚Äî examples include the moon, pen and ink, a boat or fountain ‚Äî but he began to introduce riddles on abstract themes such as God, wisdom, joy, and folly, with a didactic purpose.Aurora Salvatierra, 'La \\"Granada\\" m√°s hermosa: una adivinanza de Yƒïhudah Ha-Levi', Biblio, 47 (1998), 19-36. > :And he said to me: Is there life in death, without a heart? :I answered: > foolishness. :And he continued: Is there death in life, with the body > intact? :I answered: poverty. Frequently, the word representing the solution was integrated into the end- rhyme of the poem, making the solution to the riddle the completion of a verse. Samuel was followed by Moses ibn Ezra (born c. 1055√ó60), Judah Halevi (born c. 1075), Abraham ibn Ezra (born 1089√ó92) and Yehuda Alharizi (born 1165).The 1928-29 edition of the works of Solomon ibn Gabirol (born 1021√ó22) attributes seven riddles to him: . But these have since been reassigned to Dunash ben Labrat: Nehemya Aluny, 'Ten Dunash Ben Labrat's Riddles', The Jewish Quarterly Review, New Series, 36 (1945), 141-46. Judah is noted as the most prolific Hebrew riddler of his time, with a corpus of at least sixty- seven riddles, some of which survive in his own hand, and even in draft form. These are mostly short, monorhyme compositions on concrete subjects such as everyday artefacts, animals and plants, or a name or word.Brody, H.,1894-1930, D√Æw√¢n des Ab√ª-l-Hasan Jehudah ha-Levi.

(The answer is 'hand-mirror'.) However, his riddles also include a piece as long as 36 verses, to be solved both as 'pomegranate' and 'Granada'. Meanwhile, Abraham is noted for maximising the use of riddles as a meditation on knowledge and the divine.Dan Pagis, 'Toward a Theory of the Literary Riddle', in Untying the Knot: On Riddles and Other Enigmatic Modes, ed. by Galit Hasan-Rokem and David Shulman (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), pp. 81-108.Masha Itzhaki, 'The Riddles of Abraham Ibn Ezra', in Abraham Ibn Ezra y su tiempo: actas del Simposio Internacional: Madrid, Tudela, Toledo, 1-8 febrero 1989/Abraham Ibn Ezra and his Age: proceedings of the International Symposium: Madrid, Tudela, Toledo, 1-8 febrero 1989, ed. by Fernando D√≠az Esteban (1990), pp. 163-68, . The Andalusian tradition extended to Italy from the twelfth century, beginning with the work of Yerahmiel Bar Shlomo. Immanuel the Roman wrote riddles, as did Israel Onceneyra.See further Archer Taylor, The Literary Riddle before 1600 (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1948), pp. 35-37. Post-medieval In Hebrew-speaking Spain and Italy during around 1650-1850, a baroque sub-genre of the literary riddle called ·∏•iddat hatsurah vehalo‚Äòez (literally 'riddles of an emblem with foreign-language passages', known in English simply as 'emblem riddles') flourished. The genre was characterised by alluding to words in languages other than Hebrew (lo‚Äòez) in order to provide clues to the solution. For example, one riddle includes the Hebrew phrase Eh ko nistarti ('I am hidden somewhere here'). The first two of these words sound the same as the Italian/Spanish word eco ('echo'), and 'echo' (Hebrew hed) is indeed the solution to the poem. Each riddle would include an 'emblem' (tsurah) near the opening in the form of an allusive picture, poem, or phrase, or a combination of these, after which the riddle proper would commence. Poems in this genre were occasional, composed in celebration of specific high-society events such as weddings and circumcisions. The topic of the riddle would often reflect the occasion and audience (with solutions such as 'wisdom' for a gathering of scholars, or 'love' at a wedding), and the riddle might make use of information about the people at the gathering in ways which would make little sense to a wider audience.Arthur Lesley, 'The Riddles of Dan Pagis', Prooftexts, 11.1 (January 1991), 76-80.

It is part two of the Ava Curzon trilogy and sequel to The Sword of Moses. The novel's premise involves a hunt for an ancient biblical book to stave off a planned apocalypse in the Middle East, and features Dr Ava Curzon, an ex-MI6 archaeologist working at the British Museum.  Plot summary  Ava Curzon has returned from Baghdad to the British Museum, and is recruited by Britain‚Äôs ultra-secretive MI13 intelligence department to assist in recovering the Turin Shroud, which has been stolen by a Russian special forces team. As the chase moves to London, she finds herself on the trail of Oleg Durov, a Russian oligarch, who leads an apocalyptic group of castrati known as the Skoptsy. With the stakes rising, Ava discovers that Durov possesses two of Rasputin‚Äôs personal notebooks, in which the Russian mystic left baffling clues. After a brazen attempt on her life, she infiltrates the headquarters of the mysterious Order of Malta in Rome, where the quest becomes infinitely more dangerous. Following up a hunch, she becomes involved with Mexican gang in London smuggling war-looted antiquities from the Middle East, and finds herself playing a lethal game over an ancient Aramaic artefact like none she has ever seen before. After re- establishing contact with Uri, a Mossad assassin, she solves Rasputin‚Äôs clues, which lead her to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, where she finds an ancient manuscript hidden by a medieval Knight of Saint John. As the net closes in on her, she solves the riddle of the knight‚Äôs manuscript, and is propelled towards the chilling climax, where she must confronts Durov and the Skoptsy at an ancient castle in the south of France. There, she finally comes face to face with the ancient biblical manuscript that has been driving the mystery all along. Finally, in the husk of the ancient Cathar castle of Monts√©gur, where the medieval heretics were burned alive, she has to face Durov, and present him from unleashing his plan of devastation in the Middle East.

Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells contain several subsets. The CD4+/CD8+ ratio in the peripheral blood of healthy adults and mice is about 2:1, and an altered ratio can indicate diseases relating to immunodeficiency or autoimmunity. An inverted CD4+/CD8+ ratio (namely, less than 1/1) indicates an impaired immune system. Obesity and dysregulated lipid metabolism in the liver leads to loss of CD4+, but not CD8+ cells, contributing to the induction of liver cancer.  Decreased ratio with infection  A reduced CD4+/CD8+ ratio is associated with reduced resistance to infection. Patients with tuberculosis show a reduced CD4+/CD8+ ratio. HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells (lowering the CD4+/CD8+ ratio) through a number of mechanisms, including killing of infected CD4+. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is (by one definition) a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per ¬µL. HIV progresses with declining numbers of CD4+ and expanding number of CD8+ cells (especially CD8+ memory cells), resulting in high morbidity and mortality. When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections. Declining CD4+/CD8+ ratio has been found to be a prognostic marker of HIV disease progression.  COVID-19  In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) B cell, natural killer cell, and total lymphocyte counts decline, but both CD4+ and CD8+ cells decline to a far greater extent. Low CD4+ predicted greater likelihood of intensive care unit admission, and CD4+ cell count was the only parameter that predicted length of time for viral RNA clearance.  Decreased ratio with aging  A declining CD4+/CD8+ ratio is associated with ageing, and is an indicator of immunosenescence. Compared to CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells show a greater increase in adipose tissue in obesity and aging, thereby reducing the CD4+/CD8+ ratio. Amplication of numbers of CD8+ cells are required for adipose tissue inflammation and macrophage infiltration, whereas numbers of CD4+ cells are reduced under those conditions. Antibodies against CD8+ T-cells reduces inflammation associated with diet-induced obesity, indicating that CD8+ T-cells are an important cause of the inflammation. CD8+ cell recruitment of macrophages into adipose tissue can initiate a vicious cycle of further recruitment of both cell types. Elderly persons commonly have a CD4+/CD8+ ratio less than one. A study of Swedish elderly found that a CD4+/CD8+ ratio less than one was associated with short-term likelihood of death. Immunological aging is characterized by low proportions of naive CD8+ cells and high numbers of memory CD8+ cells, particularly when cytomegalovirus is present. Exercise can reduce or reverse this effect, when not done at extreme intensity and duration. Both effector helper T cells (Th1 and Th2) and regulatory T cells (Treg) cells have a CD4 surface marker, such that although total CD4+ T cells decrease with age, the relative percent of CD4+ T cells increases. The increase in Treg with age results in suppressed immune response to infection, vaccination, and cancer, without suppressing the chronic inflammation associated with aging.

Hasna Maznavi (born circa 1985) founded The Women‚Äôs Mosque of America, the first women-led Muslim house of worship in the United States. Hasna is also a WGA comedy writer/director committed to changing the way Islam & Muslims are represented in mainstream American media. The Women's Mosque of America is her effort to uplift the entire Muslim community by empowering the women within, and to spark the pathway towards a worldwide women-led Islamic Renaissance ‚Äî one that is shaped by Muslim women‚Äôs voices, participation, leadership, and scholarship. Maznavi had a childhood dream to build a mosque before she died as her sadaqa jariyah (ongoing charity), and she was further inspired by reading the Qur'an in English in entirety and her own study of Islamic history which revealed a rich history of female Muslim religious leadership before she decided to establish her dream mosque with rotating women khateebahs (preachers), which sets a precedent for women's leadership in American Islam.  Background  Maznavi is currently the president of the women's mosque she founded. She is a filmmaker and comedy writer, and she received an MFA in Film and TV Production from University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts and her BAs in Art and Mass Communications from UC Berkeley. Maznavi was 28 years old when she established the first-ever women's mosque in the United States.  The Women's Mosque of America  The Women's Mosque of America was founded by M. Hasna Maznavi at the first public town hall meeting on August 23, 2014. The Women's Mosque of America had precedents in other countries in Muslim-majority nations and elsewhere, but this is the first such space in the United States. Southern California Muslim women meet for Friday prayers on a monthly basis, with some programming during the week. Housed in rented interfaith spaces in downtown Los Angeles, the mosque is led by women. The call to prayer, speeches on Islamic scholarship, Quran classes, and Friday sermon all come from women. The mosque permits men at some activities but is led by women and has discussions and classes dedicated to their concerns. The women's mosque represents the development of the Muslim community in America both internally and externally. American mosques established by new immigrant Muslims were sometimes ill-equipped to accommodate the needs of Muslim women in America, due to cultural interpretations of Islam which were limiting for women and not true to Qur'anic teachings. After the mosque was founded, Maznavi published an article in the Huffington Post to explain the motivation for her work with The Women's Mosque of America. She tried to counter the image that the women's mosque represented a rebellion against both Muslim men and Islamic history. She wrote to clarify that The Women's Mosque of America was a revival of Islamic tradition as taught by Muhammad, and that Muslim men were involved and supportive of her work.

Eppes that is located in Tallahassee, Florida. The bronze sculpture sits in front of the Westcott Building on Florida State University's campus. It was commissioned by FSU president Sandy D'Alemberte to honor one of Florida State University's founders. This monument was created by sculptor Edward Jonas and was unveiled to the public eye on January 24, 2002. The statue is the starting point for Florida State University's Legacy Walk, a campus improvement project that begun in 1989. The Legacy Walk is a completed project that goes through the entire campus, reflecting on the school's history and major successes of its first 150 years. The Legacy Walk includes multiple bronze statues around campus, reflecting the history and pride of the school's students and alumni. The Eppes statue's symbolism dates back to the original formation of the school as a Seminary, remembering Eppes' role as one of the prominent founders of the school to support a higher education in Tallahassee. It currently sits to the right of Westcott Fountain when walking towards the University from College Avenue. Its location at the official entrance of the school makes it one of the most significant Jones statue on campus. History Francis W. Eppes was the grandson of Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson's influence on Eppes was very apparent throughout his life, but no more evident than in Eppes' perseverance to establish an institution in Tallahassee of higher education. Eppes was among the group of men in 1836 who petitioned to Congress for the organization of an institution nearby. The plea failed but Eppes was determined and later appealed to the Florida Legislature. The Legislature passed an act in 1851 that commissioned two institutions in the state. Eppes, as the intendent of Tallahassee, introduced a proposal to the Legislature in 1856 that aimed to establish one of the two institutions in Tallahassee. Through offering a building, thousands of dollars, and annual endowments to the school, Eppes was able to convince Legislature to pass the act. It was approved in 1857, thus marking the founding of the forebear of Florida State University. Francis Eppes was appointed to the Board of Education where he served for eleven years, eight of which he was the president of. The board was in charge of managing the property, regulating finances, appointing teachers, determining their salaries, and establishing their duties. Eppes' constant effort in creating this academy is what lead to the expansion of a great institution, the Florida State University. For that reason, in January 2002, the Eppes statue was unveiled on Florida State's campus, nearly 150 years after the founding of the University. On the plaque next to the monument, Francis W. Eppes is declared as the founder of Florida State University. Creation When designing the statue, Jones thought carefully about the direction Francis Eppes was facing on the bench. Eppes is seated on the bench with his body angled towards the rest of Tallahassee rather than towards the university as a symbol of the criticisms he faced. One of those criticisms was that the original campus location was too far west of town. When it came time to actually carve the statue, Jonas was unsure how to proceed. There were only two known portraits of Eppes in existence, one of which was from when he was five years old. According to Jonas himself, the most difficult part of modeling the statue was attaining Eppes' likeness. Since there were no records of his appearance, the sculptor frequently had to use photographs of his descendants to construct the facial features. He also did extensive research into clothing styles from the 1850s as this sculpture was created until 1999. The final difficulty he faced, unrelated to Eppes' facial appearance, was how to make the statue's eyes look lifelike. Modern controversy In 2016, a proposal to remove the statue of Francis Eppes from its Westcott Fountain location and to remove his last name from one of the school's academic buildings was brought to the Student Government Association (SGA) by the Students for a Democratic Society. Due to Eppes history as a slave owner and other acts of his to support the confederate cause, such as night watches to catch slaves in the streets of colonial Tallahassee, the Students for a Democratic Society felt his presence on campus was in a way \\"honoring slave owners and those that enforced slavery\\". According to the referendum, the Students for a Democratic Society stated: \\"We, the students of Florida State University, do not believe in honoring slave owners and those that enforced slavery. Therefore, we demand President John Thrasher, and the FSU Board of Trustees, remove the Francis Eppes Monument in front of the Westcott Building and rename Eppes Hall to remove Francis Eppes‚Äô name. Do you agree? Yes or No.\\" A Facebook page titled Keep Eppes was created in 2016 to support, and encourage other students for, the keeping of the statue, the anonymous creator's main stance being: \\"Francis Eppes is integral to the founding of the University, and should continue to be honored.\\" Although able to acquire the necessary 500 signatures to bring the referendum to the SGA, on October 19, 2016, the students of Florida State University overwhelmingly defeated the proposal, with 71.7% against and 28.3% for the removal. Turnout was roughly 6,000 out of a student body of more than 40,000 or 15% of the student body. Katherine Draken, president of the Students for a Democratic Society, told the Tallahassee Democrat: \\"This kind of confirms what I already knew ... we have a lot of work to do in building a progressive movement at FSU\\", she said, following the announcement on the vote. \\"SDS is going to continue to fight against the legacy of slavery at FSU, dropping black enrollment and other forms of oppression.\\" See also * Bronze Sculpture * Florida State University * Francis W.

UPC gained an MP in the legislative elections of 1979, Fernando Sagaseta, which was a member of CC.

In adverse weather conditions she finished 11th after 2h 34min and 14sec in a world class field lead by Gladys Cherono. In spring 2018 K√∂nigstein finished 3d at the German Half Marathon Championships. Three weeks later at 29 April 2018 she won her first Gold Medal at the German Marathon Championship, finishing 2nd at the D√ºsseldorf Marathon behind Volha Mazuronak in 2h 32min and 34sec. On her first appearance at European Marathon Championships in Berlin 2018, K√∂nigstein placed 11th, being the most successful German Athlete in this race. In December, K√∂nigstein concluded the season with a Bronze Medal at the SPAR European Cross-Country Championships in Tilburg. She placed 19th and, therefore, as the second-best German runner, although she had suffered a severe respiratory infection shortly before the race. By now, 2018 has been the most successful year in her career.

Her cookbook is the longest-selling compilation of recipes in Singapore and is considered a must- have volume by many cooks. She was inducted into the Singapore Women's Hall of Fame in 2015. Early life Ellice Zuberbuhler was born in 1902 to a racially mixed family. In 1904, she became a boarder at the Methodist Girls' School (MGS), along with her older sister Anne, who passed her Cambridge Examinations in 1915, a year before Ellice passed her own exams at the age of fourteen. In 1917, Zuberbuhler began studying Latin at the Isabella Thoburn College in Lucknow, India, as a merit scholar. After a year of study, she enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts programme, graduating with honours in 1922. Career Upon completion of her degree, Zuberbuhler returned to Singapore and began teaching at MGS that same year. Her instruction included Biblical knowledge, English and history. In 1937, Zuberbuhler became engaged to Dr. James T. N. Handy, a doctor of Ceylonese heritage, after whom Handy Road in Singapore is named. The couple had one daughter, Helen, and Handy returned to teaching. In 1941 during World War II, the school was disrupted for three and a half years and sustained significant damage to its property. In 1945, Handy began serving as principal of the MGS, the first Asian to hold the position, and the following year restarted the secondary classes which had been suspended during the Japanese occupation. Between 1950 and 1952, she designed and spearheaded construction, with the assistance of Nathalie Means, on the new school building. In 1952, she published the first comprehensive cookbook in Singapore, My Favourite Recipes, to raise funds for the MGS. The recipes covered a broad range of cuisines, including chapters on Chinese, European, Indian, Indonesian, and Malayan dishes, and Handy became well known in Malaysia and Singapore. While there had been earlier cookbooks printed by organizations for their membership, these usually were adaptations of European dishes with ingredients locally available in Singapore. Asian dishes were typically passed by word of mouth from mother to daughter. Handy was a home cook, who used Asian methods, like steaming and stir-frying, utensils, locally available produce and included those processes in her book. She encouraged her readers to experiment with the recipes to meet their own families' tastes. On 20 July 1957, Handy was awarded the Order of the British Empire for her work in education. She returned to teaching in 1957, resigning from her post as principal, and retired in 1964. After her retirement, Handy wrote articles for Female, a local women's magazine, mostly about cooking and updated the recipes in her book for subsequent publications. In 1982, Handy's husband died and five years later, Handy moved to Australia to be near her daughter. Death and legacy Handy died on 30 May 1989 in Eastwood, South Australia and was buried at Centennial Park Cemetery, Pasadena, South Australia. Handy's cookbook has gone into eleven editions, the most recent being published in 2012 and is the longest selling cookbook in Singapore. The recipe collection is considered \\"the Bible\\" of local cooks and spawned a wave of others to publish cookbooks. In 2015, Handy was inducted into the Singapore Women's Hall of Fame.

Life and career  Hewat was born on 16 September 1895 in Prestwick, Scotland to Elizabeth Glendinning and the Rev. Kirkwood Hewat, the United Free Church minister at Prestwick. Her education began at the girls' school Wellington School in Ayr and she went on to gain an MA at the University of Edinburgh in history and philosophy. Her first academic position was as assistant lecturer in history at the University of St Andrews. She then moved to the UFC Women's Missionary College in Edinburgh where she taught between 1922 and 1926. In Edinburgh, she was one of the first women to study at New College and became the first woman to graduate BD from the college in 1926, coming top of her class. Hewat believed that in order to fully prepare for missionary work that she should be ordained by the church. This led to a debate on women's ordination during the 1926 United Free Church General Assembly, however, the motion was not passed. Hewat continued to argue for women's equality in the Christian church, writing in 1931, \\"women in the church hold a subordinate position; and women of today ask why ... Of one thing they are certain, and it is this, that it is not Christ who is barring the way.\\" Despite the refusal of ordination, Hewat began her missionary work by joining her sister in China. Once there, she was a teaching missionary and followed her own scholarly interests by researching comparative literature in Hebrew and Confucian Wisdom. Following her time in China, she returned to Edinburgh to work as an unpaid assistant at North Merchiston Church and to complete her PhD at the University of Edinburgh. In 1935, she moved to Mumbai to become Professor of History at Wilson College and remained there until 1956. She was an elder in the United Church of North India. After her return to Scotland, Hewat died on 13 October 1968 in Edinburgh and was buried in Comely Bank Cemetery.  Select bibliography  * Hewat, Elizabeth G.K. 1960.

It is a less invasive technique with the advantages of no ionizing radiation exposure, multiplanarity and high contrast resolution for soft tissue. The term MR enterography and MR enteroclisys are similar, but the first is referred to a MR exam with orally administered enteric contrast media, and the second to a more invasive technique in which enteric contrast media is administered through the fluoroscopy-guided positioned nasojejunal tube. The need for imaging assessment of small bowel diseases comes from the limits of traditional endoscopy in evaluating ileum loops ‚Äì even modern capsule endoscopy is not routinely performed as barely available. Over the past several years assessment of small bowel diseases was performed by Barium follow through, or upper and lower gastrointestinal series, that provided plan film of bowel loop lumen, thanks to the swallowing or instillation of radiopaque agents mixed with water or other neutral contrast media. Gastrointestinal series allow to depict lumen caliber, gross mucosal alterations and wide fistulous tract, but were poorly diagnostic for submucosal or extraluminal features. CT scan instead provides cross sectional and multiplanar images of intraluminal and extra-mucosal, extra-luminal or even extra-enteric features, but costing higher radiation dose. The spread of MR technique has revolutionized the diagnostic imaging of the small bowel loop, restricting CT scan to particular situations, such as emergency or MR contraindications like patients with pacemaker implant, recently implanted vascular/bilious stent or other ferromagnetic prosthesis/devices. It is a safe, multi-planar imaging modality with high soft tissue contrast resolution that does not expose to ionizing radiation, so it is feasible for young patients or when several follow up are required.  Preparation  Cathartic preparation should be performed in order to clean residual stool from bowel loops from to allow a better visualization of mucosal features and an easier luminal distention as well. This type of preparation usually implies a fiber restricted diet and intake of water solution with laxative effect few days before the exam, and abstaining from food intake starting from six hours prior to the study. Use of enteric contrast media is recommended, aiming to distend small bowel loops, and it is administered orally at regular intervals approximately 40 minutes before the study. The type of endo-luminal contrast media varies among negative contrast media, consisting of superparamagnetic agents that evoke low signal both in T1 and T2 weighted images, positive contrast media, represented by paramagnetic agents, that produce high signal on both sequences, or biphasic contrast media, that gives high signal intensity in T2 and low intensity in T1. This latter, that consists of water, methyl cellulose or polyethylene glycol, is the most used, because of the wide availability, low cost, good patient compliance, and good taste. Water enema may be administered as well in order to distend bowel loop (MR-colonography). Intravenous contrast media increases diagnostic capability of enterography MRI. Although it is better tolerated than iodinated contrast media used for CT-scan, the use of gadolinium-based contrast agent should always be preceded by kidney function assessment, in order to reduce the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, and prophylactic protocol in case of previous allergic reactions. Antispasmodic agents may be used to reduce the motion artifacts due to peristalsis.  Protocol  High field MR scanners and the use of multi-channel phased array surface coil are suggested in order to obtain adequately diagnostic images. The patient is placed in prone position, thus provides better separation of bowel loops and reduces breathing movement-artifacts. Although MR enterography protocols may vary among different hospitals/institutions, the main sequences are the following: Axial and coronal balanced Steady State Free precession Axial and coronal Single-shot-FSE with fat saturation Axial and coronal 3D spoiled GE before and after contrast media administration Axial DWI sequences, using at least 2 B-value. Cine loop technique using SSFP sequences  Indications  The most common indication of MR enterography is diagnosis and follow up of inflammatory and neoplastic small bowel disease.  Risks and contraindications  Risks and contraindications are the same of any MR exam.  References  Fidler JL, Guimaraes L, Einstein DM. MR Imaging of the Small Bowel.

She had been teaching in New College since 1979, until her retirement in 2000. Her prominent work includes God and the Web of Creation (1979) and Ambiguity and the Presence of God (1985).  Biography  Born in Dundee, she educated at Harris Academy and Stirling High School. She obtained her BA of English and French with honours at University of St Andrews in 1956, and then taught in Tauranga in New Zealand from 1957 to 1968, before she studied for the ministry at University of Otago, obtaining a BD in 1971, and a DPhil at the University of Oxford in 1975. That year, she was ordained by the Presbytery of Dunedin and started her academic career as a lecturer at the Theological Hall in University of Otago. In 1979, she would return to Scotland to become a lecturer in the Faculty of Divinity at New College, Edinburgh and become a minister of the Church of Scotland. She became the principal of New College in 1996, and worked until her retirement in 2000.  Theology in the God and the Web of Creation  In light of ecological crisis caused by humanity, Page suggests that the problems should be viewed from a Christian perspective to care about the natural world. This concerns God's relationship with the natural world, for how the divine involves in all creatures, influenced by Celtic spirituality that highlights God's engagement with all living, farming and fishing. For Page, a doctrine of creation should be about how God is involved in, and not only about human's action. Humans are considered as the web of likenesses, because humans are in a pattern of interconnection, with both humans and non-humans.The term 'web of likenesses' is from Norman MacCaig's poem. See Norman MacCaig (1985), 'No End, No Beginning', Collected Poems, Chatto and Windus, p. 206. Emphasising the importance of the doctrine of creation, Page urges Christians to re-think the relationship between God, humanity and all the natural world. Thus, with God's immanent action with the world, both human and non-human can be gathered like a web of creation.Page, God and the Web of Creation, xix.

Early life and career Kwok was born in Hong Kong to Chinese parents who practiced Chinese folk religion at home. She converted to Anglican Christianity, when she was a teenager. She started her BA at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, before moving on to do her BD and MTh at Southeast Asia Graduate School of Theology. She gained her ThD from Harvard Divinity School, finishing her doctoral dissertation on \\"Chinese Women and Christianity\\" in 1989, later published through Scholars Press. She is the author of twenty books, including Postcolonial Imagination and Feminist Theology (2005). She has published in the disciplines of feminist theology, postcolonial theology and biblical hermeneutics from her personal perspective of an Asian woman. From 1992 to 2017, she was teaching at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was appointed the William F. Cole Professor of Christian Theology and Spirituality. She has been employed at Candler School of Theology, first as a Distinguished Visiting Professor of Theology for the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 academic years, then from Spring 2020 as the Dean's Professor of Theology. In 2011, she was elected President of the American Academy of Religion, a position she ran for on account of her desire to make more visible the presence of Asian women in theology and academia. She writes, \\"as leaders, we have to bring the tribe along. Those of us who are pioneers have the responsibility of opening the door a little wider for others to come.\\"  Theology  Kwok's work has used as a locus her position and identity as an Asian woman. Writing in feminist theology, postcolonial criticism and biblical hermeneutics, she has maintained as her identity as an Asian woman, incorporating it into her work. She explains: > As Asian Christian women, we have our own story, which is both Asian and > Christian. We can only tell this story by developing a new hermeneutics: a > hermeneutics of double suspicion and reclamation. Because she aims to explore the lives and experiences of marginalized women, she is frequently considered part of the Third World theological movement. Kwok has engaged with postcolonial theory in her work, most prominently in Postcolonial Imagination and Feminist Theology, where she argues against the inadequacies of traditional feminist theology. She states that traditional feminist theory has not sufficiently considered the experiences of non-white women, and the effects of colonialism, neocolonialism and slavery. Her aim is to marry postcolonial theory to feminist theology and she writes for the need to overcome the binary concept of gender, arguing for a more fluid interpretation of gender and the inclusion of queer sexuality. She argues that \\"the most important contribution of postcolonial feminist theology will be to recapitulate the relation of theology and empire through the multiple lenses of gender, race, class, sexuality, religion, and so forth.\\" The aim of her work is to create a theology that more accurately reflects the multiple levels of oppression that women in postcolonial contexts face. Kwok views God as organic, and places the belief in the context of the growing ecological crisis in Asia. She also examines the concept of constructing a Christology using an organic model, referring to the multiple nature references Jesus uses to describe himself and his relationship with believers. Kwok advocates for the incorporation of oral methods within theology, writing \\"we must allow the possibility of doing theology in poems, songs, stories, dances, rituals, and even lullabies.\\" For Kwok, the storytelling tradition within many Asian societies offers a rich resource for innovative ways of doing theology as women engage with biblical stories through drama and the sharing of life experiences.

She served as National President of the Church of Scotland's Women's Guild in the early 1980s, where she led the debate on the issue of the \\"Motherhood of God\\".  Early life and education  Anne Burton was born in Dailly, South Ayrshire on 20 August 1925.Thanksgiving Service for the life of Anne Hepburn [Order of Service]. Motherhood of God Papers, New College Library. (Mrs Hepburn's papers relating to the Motherhood of God Controversy were donated to New College Library in 2016 at her request by her surviving children). Her mother died when she was a child of eighteen months, and she grew up with her blacksmith father, who was also a church elder. She went onto study at Glasgow University, before training as a teacher at Jordanhill. When she graduated, she taught at a small village school in the village of Barr for three years before applying to the Women's Foreign Mission Committee of the Church of Scotland. She was accepted for training at St Colm's College, a Church of Scotland college.  Mission work  In 1950 Anne Burton was sent to Malawi, then called Nyasaland, as headmistress of a mission primary school for girls. She met her future husband, fellow missionary James Lamb (Hamish) Hepburn, first at a Church of Scotland weekend in Galashiels and later on the voyage to Malawi and in August 1954 they married. Their three children Catherine,Catherine Hepburn's obituary, Retrieved 3 November 2016 Margaret and Kenneth were born in Malawi. The political struggles that began in 1959 against the planned Central African Federation resulted in independence for Nyasaland, but an uncertain climate for those who opposed the new regime. In 1964, when on furlough in Scotland, the Hepburns were advised not to return to Malawi.  Life in the Church  Anne Hepburn settled in Kirkcudbright, Dumfries & Galloway, where her husband Hamish became minister. Anne was active in the Women's Guild, serving as National Vice-President from 1972-1975, and she was ordained as an elder of the Church of Scotland in 1974. In 1981, Hepburn became National President of the Women's Guild.  Motherhood of God controversy  In her opening remarks to the 1982 April annual meeting of the Women's Guild, Anne Hepburn decided to use a prayer written by the Rev. Brian Wren which addressed \\"God our Mother\\" (the original typewritten script is now preserved in the New College Library Archives). The prayer caused audible upset, and many letters of complaint followed. Nevertheless this first step was followed by the creation of a study by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland to study the theological implications of the Motherhood of God. But when this group reported back to the General Assembly, the topic was shelved. Nevertheless, the discussion continued around the world.

The company ended up rebuilding the mill in 1880 to near its current state. The last mill built on the complex was built in 1910. The mill ended up under control by the American Thread Company in 1898 due to the merger of the previous ownership of the mill. The mill was closed in 1985 due to the company moving operations to the South.  Current Status  Mill #4 burned down in 1995 due to a fire caused by local children. The wooden swing bridge connecting the mills was closed permanently shortly thereafter. The mills lay dormant until the former grounds started to be purchased for commercial and residential purposes. ArtSpace currently has its Windham apartments located in this complex. The old chimney was demolished between 2012‚Äì2014.  Garden on the Bridge  The Garden on the Bridge is located in the complex of the former mills. It is a stone arch bridge built in 1857, that formerly was used for automobile until the Frog Bridge was opened in 2000. It is currently a pedestrian bridge with flora all over, giving the bridge a natural look. The bridge was temporarily closed until 2006 when it was reopened for its current purpose.  National Register of Historic Places  The complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 30, 2014 along with other historic mills across the section of the state. This makes it the one of 22 on the list in the town of Windham. File:American Thread Co.

The totems are tall and made of layered recycled materials intended to \\"create a surface representing earth, water and sky as a gateway to the Sellwood community\\". They \\"rotate\\" at 90-degree angles. According to the Regional Arts & Culture Council, the project's concept was \\"driven by the power and beauty of the geologic and natural phenomena\\" of the Willamette Valley. It was funded by the City of Portland's art program. The sculptures are owned by the city and maintained by the Regional Arts & Culture Council. History Mikyoung Kim's work was selected by the Regional Arts & Culture Council in 2012. The totems were created by Art & Design Works of Cornelius.

History The purpose of the medal is to honour those who took part in the confrontations with Soviet forces during The Barricades in 1991, part of the struggle for Latvia to regain its independence and put an end to the Soviet occupation. The first medal was awarded in 1996, and the last one in October 2011. An amendment to the law regulating the award of the medal made in 2007 stipulated that no new nominations for the awarding of the medal could take place after 31 December 2008. Thus, the medal is no longer awarded as it is deemed that all those eligible for it have already received it; around 32,000 people have been awarded the medal. Description The medal was given to those who took active part in The Barricades or supported them morally or logistically. It was given in recognition of \\"the courage, selflessness and initiative they demonstrated in January and August 1991, as well as for their contribution in performing organisational and logistic activities.\\" It was awarded by a specially designated board, chaired by the Speaker of the Latvian Parliament (Saeima). It could also be awarded posthumously. The first medals were awarded posthumously to those who had died during the conflict, the very first medal was awarded to Vladimir Gomanoviƒç who was killed on 20 January 1991 by Soviet forces. The medal is a shield- shaped medal surrounded by oak leaves, in diameter. On the obverse, it carries the image of a lion carrying a shield with two crossed keys, and the inscription \\"LR 1991\\". On the reverse, the serial number of the medal and the words Par Latviju (\\"For Latvia\\") are engraved. Its band is a crimson-white- crimson band (similar to the flag of Latvia), wide. Apart from the medal, a smaller pin with the same motif was also given to the recipient. The pin is intended for everyday use.

The film, which uses a stop motion animation based on paper cut-out figures that Lione called \\"papermotion\\", claims to be Italy's first feature-length stop-motion animation film.  Background  After four years in the making for a budget expenditure of ‚Ç¨5 million, the highly original \\"Kate\\" made its debut on April 23, 2004 at the Cartoons on the Bay festival on the Amalfi coast. Kate updates Shakespeare's play, setting it in the 21st century with Kate as a skateboard-riding firebrand, the daughter of a spaghetti magnate, and Petruchio a womanizing \\"Don Giovanni\\" spendthrift who needs Kate's wealth to pay off his debts. The director, Roberto Lione is an award-winning filmmaker, screenwriter, Mod-Art artist and director of photography. \\"Papermotion\\", Lione's technique of stop-motion using folded paper figures, was also used in the 53 Taco & Paco television cartoons that he coproduced with RaiFiction and in 10 theatrical 35mm shorts. Italian film critics have described his approach to film animation in Kate as \\"having a poetical dimension, almost metaphysical which recalls De Chirico and the Surrealists.\\"  Production  For the production of Kate, 200 custom-made bronze armatures were made for the 6 inch tall characters which were painstakingly animated by hand. Ten miniature sets were built, each with up 40 light sources. More than 50 miniature scenes were constructed. Almost a half square mile of colored paper was used and over 230,000 photos were taken, one at a time for every single frame of the film. Each animator averaged 5 seconds of filmed animation a day.  Awards  The film won the prize for best full- length animation at the Chicago International Kinder Film Festival in 2004.  Reception  Kate received several positive reviews: * \\"‚Ä¶last night the audience applauded the lively and amusing Italian version of Kate, very freely inspired by Shakespeare with its allusive subtitle The Taming of the Shrew.\\" *: ‚Äî Nino Marchesano, La Repubblica, 24 April 2004Nino Marchesano, La Repubblica, 24 April 2004 * \\"Kate now becomes a foul-tempered doll in paper and stop motion for the new Italian cartoon version of The Taming of the Shrew, one of the most beautiful of Shakespeare‚Äôs comedies.\\" *: ‚Äî \\"Cartoons on the Bay\\".

It was originally released in September 1975 on Columbia Records, and was among the Firesign Theatre's last Columbia albums, along with In the Next World, You're on Your Own and Forward Into The Past. It was recorded from a live performance at The Bottom Line which contained material adapted or re-used from their 1973 studio album TV or Not TV, plus a few new sketches. Title and cover art The title is taken from a song Philip Proctor and Peter Bergman wrote, which parodies Vice President Thomas R. Marshall's famous quote, \\"What this country needs is a good five- cent cigar\\". The song says what this country needs is \\"a good five-cent joke\\". The album's cover art mimics a cardboard cigar box lid, with a painting of Proctor dressed as a field worker in jean overalls and a straw hat, with Bergman dressed in a suit as the plantation owner. Proctor holds up a wad of cash, while Bergman holds a handful of cigars.

Only one was built. Design and development The all-metal Dornier Do S was intended to replace the Dornier Do R 4 Superwal, a four- engined, 19-passenger flying boat flown four years earlier. Both were high- wing monoplanes but the Do S was bigger (about 7-8%) in both span and weight, and had a significantly improved hull which seated 22 passengers. A large increase in effective wing area, which included sponsons and an auxiliary winglet, decreased the wing loading by about 30% and the landing speed by . The main wing of the Dornier S was in three parts, with a central panel attached to the crew's compartment on top of the main fuselage, and two outer panels. It was rectangular in plan, with a chord of , apart from slightly blunted tips. The wing was built around three duralumin trellis spars, with dural ribs and skin. The inner panel was supported by two vertical struts from the sponsons. On each side the main outer bracing was provided by a single strut from the inner sponson to the central spar of the outer panel, at about half-span. These were assisted by steel flying wires from below, between the forward and rear spars and the sponsons, and from above by a single wire from the raised engine mountings and their cross-bracing auxiliary wing, to the forward spar. High aspect ratio ailerons occupied all the trailing edge of the outer panels, aerodynamically balanced by small auxiliary surfaces mounted forward and well above the hinge line. The lower part of the fuselage followed Dornier's usual practice, with a narrow-V cross-section forward changing to a flat bottom, with a deeper centre region, near the single step and a V-section aft ending with a water rudder. There were two passenger cabins, one seating twelve forward of a lobby accessed by a starboard side door and containing a cloakroom, toilet, library and medicine cabinet. Behind it was a second passenger compartment for ten, with a kitchen aft. At the stern the empennage was conventional, with a fin that had a swept leading edge and blunted top, carrying a rudder which reached down to the top of the fuselage. Its tailplane, with a plan similar to that of the wing, was braced from below by a pair of parallel struts on each side and was adjustable in flight. It carried elevators which were aerodynamically balanced in the same way as the ailerons. The crew were housed in a separate structure above the cabin which also formed the central connection between wing and fuselage. It began well forward of the leading edge and ended just aft of the trailing edge. The pilot's open cockpit near the front had a pair of side-by-side seats with dual controls. Further aft, there were positions for a flight engineer, a navigator and a radio operator, one of whom could act as co-pilot. The Do S was powered by four Hispano-Suiza 12Lbr water-cooled V-12 engines, mounted above the wings in push-pull configuration pairs and driving four-bladed propellers. Each engine in a pair had a radiator occupying half the front of the rectangular section nacelle. Each pair was mounted on two V-struts and two wider-spread inverted V-struts to the forward and central spars. The upper engine mountings were braced together centrally by a narrow-chord structure which acted as an auxiliary wing as well as being part of the main wing bracing structure. With a span of almost , it reached out beyond the engines. Operational history The Do S's first flight was made on 23 September 1931 from the Bodensee. On 16 November 1931 it flew from Friedrichshafen in Germany to Paris for the 12th annual Salon (aero show), landing on the Seine at Suresnes but displayed indoors in Paris. It returned to Friedrichshafen in the new year in a series of short demonstration flights. Despite Dornier's efforts. no orders were placed and only one Do S was built. It was used as a hydrodynamic test vehicle until 1933, when it was transferred at the Ministry of Transport's request to the Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule (DVS) flying school at List auf Sylt. It was lost in the Baltic in 1935.

A sensation occurred in 1939 when it was announced that all the female roles would be played by women. The Archbishop of Colombo banned the performance on the grounds that women acting on the same stage as men would have violated the decorum of the country. Although they were not pleased, the actors gave in to church pressure and used only men. The Passion Play The Promise: The Power of His Love in Fond du Lac, WI.

Gale Virtual Reference Library. She was a leading academic in the field of theater and African-American studies.  Early life  She was born Edeve Thompson in 1932 in Los Angeles, California to Evelyn Preer and Edward Thompson, who were leading silent film actors and vaudevillians in the 1910s and 1920s. Due to the death of her mother later the same year, her father moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, where she was raised. When it came time to attend to high school, Thompson faced the barrier of local racial segregation laws, which practically barred her from enrolling in any school in Indianapolis. Although she was from an Episcopalian family, she chose to enroll at the only private school in the region which accepted black students, Immaculate Conception (St. Mary's) Academy, in Oldenburg, Indiana, (now Oldenburg Academy) run by the Franciscan Sisters of Oldenburg. During her time as a student, Thompson chose to enter the Roman Catholic Church, overcoming the initial opposition of her father. When she graduated from the school in 1950, she made the decision to join the Franciscan sisters who had taught her, and she again faced the opposition of her father, who relented only after she agreed to join a group of students who were to travel to Europe. In the course of this trip, she met Pope Pius XII, who seemed to confirm her decision to enter the convent.  Career  Thompson was received into the novitiate of the Franciscan Sisters that same year. She professed religious vows the following year, upon completing that stage of formation, at which time she received the religious habit of the congregation and the religious name by which she is known. In 1954, after professing perpetual vows as a Franciscan Sister of Oldenburg, she was sent by her superiors to teach at St. Mary's Academy while she worked on getting a bachelor's degree at Marian College (now Marian University). She obtained her degree in 1960, at which time she was assigned to teach at a school run by the congregation in the inner city of Cincinnati, Ohio. While teaching in Cincinnati, Thompson was assigned to spend her summers working on a Master's degree at Xavier University, where she earned a degree in education with a concentration in communications in 1964. She then received permission to work on a doctorate in theater at the University of Michigan, which she received in 1966. While teaching there, she trained notable actors such s Christine Lahti and Gilda Radner. She then began to teach at Marian College, where she served as chairwoman of the Department of Theater and Speech. From 1982, Thompson was an associate professor of African American studies and assistant dean/director for multicultural programs at Fordham University, where she was honored with an honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts in 2002. She retired in 2005, moving to the motherhouse of her congregation in Oldenburg. Thompson has served as a member of the nominating committee for the Tony Awards.

The French military contribution to the allied cause to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi occupation was named Op√©ration Daguet and its ground part was subsequently named Division Daguet. In French \\"Daguet\\" is a young brocket deer. In 1991 the division participated in Operation Desert Storm guarding the left flank of the allied advance. After Iraq surrendered the division's units returned to France and the division itself was disbanded on 30 April 1991.  History  After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 the United States and its allies began to deploy forces to Saudi Arabia to protect the country from a feared Iraqi invasion. As Iraq's dictator Saddam Hussein refused to remove his forces from Kuwait the United Nations Security Council accepted UNSC Resolution 678, which authorized UN member nations in to evict Iraqi forces from Kuwait with force after 15 January 1991. France had already dispatched troops to Saudi Arabia in September 1990 to help deter Iraq from further military adventures, but with war drawing closer, the French contingent was rapidly reinforced all through fall of 1990. Most of the initial units of the Division Daguet were drawn from the 6th Light Armoured Division (France) (6 DLB), but ultimately the division was made up mixed units from 20 regiments with troops and equipment coming from 57 regiments in total. Initially the commander of 6th Light Armoured Division, Major General Jean-Charles Mouscard√®s, commanded Division Daguet, but after a medical emergency on 7 February 1991 he was replaced by Brigadier General Bernard Janvier the next day. Overall commander of French forces in Saudi Arabia and Op√©ration Daguet was General Michel Roquejeoffre, commanding officer of the French Army's Rapid Action Force.. Initially, the French operated independently under national command and control, but coordinated closely with General Schwarzkopf, Commander-in-Chief, United States Central Command, coordinating the non-Arab forces. In January, the Division was placed under the tactical control of the US XVIII Airborne Corps and reinforced for the ground war with the following units from the US Army: 2nd Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division, 18th Field Artillery Brigade, and 27th Engineer Battalion.  Operation Desert Storm  The French operated on the left flank during Op√©ration Daguet (click to enlarge) On 24 February 1991, the ground phase began. Reconnaissance units of Division Daguet advanced into Iraq. Three hours later, the French main body attacked. The initial objective of the division was an airfield inside Iraq at As-Salman. Reinforced by the US 82nd Airborne Division, the French crossed the border unopposed and attacked north. The French then came across elements of the Iraqi 45th Infantry Division. After a brief battle, supported by French Army missile-armed A√©rospatiale Gazelle attack helicopters, they controlled the objective and captured 2,500 prisoners. By the end of the first day Division Daguet had secured its objectives and continued the attack north, securing the highways from Baghdad to southern Iraq.

The episode was written by Corey Reed and directed by David Boyd. The episode focuses on the remaining members of the core group holding together in Alexandria, while mourning the deaths of Glenn and Abraham, but Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and the Saviors show up early at their gates for their first offering. Plot At Alexandria, Michonne (Danai Gurira) takes a hidden sniper rifle and leaves for a field, with a burnt out car, to practice with the weapon. A walker eventually approaches and she misses it several times, and eventually decapitates it with her katana. She finds one of her stray bullets hit a deer, and she carries it back to Alexandria. Meanwhile, Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and his Saviors, including a captive Daryl (Norman Reedus), arrive earlier than expected to collect half of Alexandria's supplies. Rick (Andrew Lincoln) says they have already set out half of their supplies, but Negan retorts that he gets to determine what they take, as they are providing a \\"service\\" to the community. He orders his Saviors to search the homes, taking their beds. Dwight (Austin Amelio) forces Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Spencer (Austin Nichols) to collect Daryl's motorcycle from the nearby woods. While outside of Alexandria, Spencer expresses his concern that Rick is not more accepting of Negan's rule. Rosita recovers a gun and they find Daryl's bike. As they wait, Negan taunts Rick over video footage taken from when Rick's group first arrived in Alexandria, and asks to see his \\"sick girl\\" Maggie. Father Gabriel (Seth Gilliam) appears and asks if Negan would like to pay his respects to her, tricking him into believing Maggie is dead. Their conversation is broken by a gunshot, and they congregate at the community's infirmary. There, Carl (Chandler Riggs) holds a Savior at gunpoint. Negan is impressed by Carl's bravery but forces him to stand down, and then demands to see the armory, as Alexandria seems to have a lot of guns. Olivia (Ann Mahoney) shows Negan around the armory, and he instructs them to turn over all the guns, including those that Rick's group had stolen from one of his outposts. As the Saviors load the guns on their trucks, they find two listed in the inventory missing, and Negan threatens to kill Olivia if they aren't returned. Rick and the other Alexandria survivors search through the homes to find them, and Rick discovers them, along with a stash of food, hidden in Spencer's home. With all the guns collected, the Saviors prepare to leave when Rick sees Michonne hiding in one of the dilapidated houses outside. He begs Negan for a moment, and goes to the house to convince Michonne to turn over the rifle, which was not in the inventory, and the deer for the better good. Appreciative of Rick's effort, Negan warns Rick that if they catch any Alexandrian with a gun, they will kill them. Rick asks if Daryl can stay, but when Negan puts the question to Daryl, he remains obstinately silent. After the Saviors leave, Rick accuses Spencer of hoarding supplies, while Spencer taunts Rick for his failure as a leader. Later, Michonne attempts to encourage Rick to fight. Rick tells her he cannot. He explains that he knows that Judith is not his daughter but that of his friend, but loves her anyway, and similarly with Alexandria, they need to accept Negan's rule to keep living. The following day, while outside Alexandria in the same field, Michonne finds all the mattresses that the Saviors took burned in a pile by the road. At night, Rosita finds and picks up an empty shell casing. She visits Eugene (Josh McDermitt) and requests he make her a bullet for the gun she still has. Reception=Critical reception Jeffrey Dean Morgan received mixed reviews for his performance as Negan in this episode. \\"Service\\" received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 62% with an average rating of 6.94 out of 10, based on 34 reviews. The site's consensus reads: Though the pace is slower than desired, \\"Service\\" systematically sets a foundation for a frightening future while furthering the story of life under Negan's rule. Kelly Lawler of USA Today reviewed the episode, saying, \\"Jeffrey Dean Morgan's villain is still just as boring, just as non-threatening as he was before. An extra-long episode that was basically just the IKEA trip from Hell doesn't really do anything to further his character.\\" Erik Kain of Forbes also reviewed the episode, saying, \\"All told, this was the weakest episode of the season so far by a long shot. I hope the showrunners tighten things up going forward, and give us more action, more intertwined storylines, and less Negan and his endless chatter.\\" Ratings The episode received a 5.4 rating in the key 18-49 demographic with 11.40 million total viewers.

The episode was written by Channing Powell and directed by Darnell Martin. The episode focuses on Maggie (Lauren Cohan) and Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) recovering from their grief, and hope to find safety at the Hilltop before it's too late. Meanwhile, Carl (Chandler Riggs) and Enid (Katelyn Nacon) journey to the same community, as Simon (Steven Ogg) and a crew of Saviors arrive to get their tribute. Plot At the Hilltop community, Maggie (Lauren Cohan) is seen to by Dr. Harlan Carson (R. Keith Harris), who reports she suffered an abruptio placentae, a separation of the placenta from the uterus, but that the baby is fine. At Maggie's request, Sasha takes her to where Glenn and Abraham are buried, and Maggie places Glenn's pocket watch, a gift to him from her father, Hershel, on his grave as a marker. Jesus (Tom Payne) provides flowers for them, while Hilltop's leader Gregory (Xander Berkeley) warns that they must return to Alexandria immediately, despite Maggie's condition. Jesus tries to reason with Gregory but he demands they be gone by morning. Jesus arranges for temporary quarters and apologizes for Gregory, while Sasha asserts she can provide help in exchange for staying at Hilltop. Meanwhile, at Alexandria, Carl (Chandler Riggs) and Michonne (Danai Gurira) refuse to go with Rick (Andrew Lincoln) to scavenge provisions for the Saviors. Carl sees Enid (Katelyn Nacon) leaving Alexandria. Enid learned of Glenn and Abraham's death and wanted to see how Maggie was doing, but he tells her he is not saving her anymore. However, later that day, as Enid is approached by walkers, Carl drives a car over the walkers, saying he \\"felt like a drive\\". The two walk together towards Hilltop. That night, the Hilltop community is awoken by loud music: the gate is open and a car blaring music is drawing walkers inside. The survivors take action to defend themselves, but Gregory is shown standing and watching from his window. Sasha tries to get into the car to cut the power, while Maggie drives a tractor over several walkers and the car itself, silencing it. The next day, Gregory and Jesus discuss what to do about Sasha and Maggie when the Saviors arrive. Jesus goes to hide the two in a closet while Gregory greets Simon (Steven Ogg) and the other Saviors. Gregory tells Simon he got the message loud and clear from the previous night. He opens a closet, pulling out a bottle of scotch from a box as part of their offering to Negan, which Simon accepts, taking the entire box though. As the Saviors are loading their trucks, Carl and Enid arrive. Carl wants to stow aboard the truck to travel to Sanctuary, the Saviors' home, but Enid refuses to go. They share a kiss before he sneaks aboard, while Enid quietly enters Hilltop. Once the Saviors leave his home, Gregory again demands that Maggie and Sasha leave, but Jesus puts his foot down and says he will take over if Gregory does not allow them to stay. Later, Sasha discreetly asks if Jesus can find out where Sanctuary is located. Jesus also sneaks aboard one of the Saviors' trucks as it is leaving, surprised to find Carl there. Maggie and Sasha later discover Enid, who claims she came alone, now wanting to live at Hilltop. Maggie gives Enid a watch that was Glenn‚Äôs, and they pray for their lost loved ones.

In 1912, the year of her nineteenth birthday, she became a member of the Social Democratic Party (\\" Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). Two years later, in July 1914, war broke out. The party leadership concluded what amounted to a political truce for the duration of the war, which provoked vehement dissent among the party membership. In 1917 the party finally broke apart, primarily because of differences over whether to continue voting funds for the war in the Reichstag: Geffke was one of those who chose the anti-war breakaway faction, identified as the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD). In 1918 she was a member of the party regional leadership (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") for Stettin, and during the revolutionary months that followed the end of the war she was a member locally of the Workers' and Soldiers' Soviet (\\"council\\"). When the USPD itself broke apart at the end of 1920 she was part of the leftwing majority that switched to the newly formed Communist Party of Germany, becoming a full-time regional party secretary for Pomerania. Activism and politics in Weimar Germany In March 1921 the party appointed her regional \\"women's secretary\\" for the politically and economically important Lower Rhine and Ruhr districts in the west of the country. Four months later, in July 1921, she was a delegate at the third world congress of the Communist International and the second international Women's Congress, both held in Moscow. Later in 1921, as the result of a by-election in Silesia (at that time part of Prussia), she was elected a member of the Prussian legislative assembly (\\"Preu√üischer Landtag \\"). She remained a member, representing the Communist Party, till 1924. In 1922 Herta Geffke married , a party functionary. The marriage lasted till 1928. As a party moderate at a time when Staliinist extremists were increasingly in the ascendant within the party, she did not stand for re- election to the Landtag in the regional elections of December 1924. Over the next few years, living with her husband, she was employed in a succession of relatively low profile party jobs. Till the end of 1928 she worked for the party leadership in the Berlin district of Neuk√∂lln. After her marriage broke up in 1928 there were further political differences with party comrades and she offered her services to \\"Red Aid\\", the Communist-sponsored international welfare organisation. In this capacity she ran a children's home in Worpswede (north of Bremen) and then another, far to the south, at Elgersburg until it was forced to close through lack of funds. After this she worked as a regional party secretary in the Saar region, an area of Germany with an ambiguous status and still, at this stage, occupied by the French army. She was very soon moved to a job with the regional party leadership (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") in the Ruhr district and during 1931/32, worked as regional secretary for \\"Red Aid\\" in the large Baden-Palatinate region. In 1933 she became a member of the Central Executive of \\"Red Aid\\". Twelve Nazi years The political backdrop was transformed in January 1933 when the Nazi Party took power in Germany and lost little time in converting the country into a one-party dictatorship. Herta Geffke continued to pursue her (now illegal) political activities, working for \\"Red Aid\\" in the Hessen-Frankfurt region from March 1933 and in the Ruhr district further to the north. It was in Essen in the Ruhr district that she was arrested on 11 or 13 September 1933. She was held for the next six months in \\"protective custody\\". On 5 March 1934 the district high court in Hamm sentenced her to a thirty-month jail term for \\"preparing to commit high treason\\" (\\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat\\"). She was then imprisoned successively in the women's prison at (south of Kassel) and at Jauer (west of Breslau). She was released in October 1936, and trained to work in a (men's) barber's shop. During the ensuing Nazi years she worked as a hair dresser in Stettin and as a seamstress. It is reported that she resumed her illegal work for the Communist party, although details of what this involved are sparse. During 1943/44 she was a member of the resistance group around and in the Stettin region. Soviet occupation zone War ended, and with it the Nazi r√©gime, in May 1945. On 3 May 1945 Herta Geffke came into contact with Gustav Sobottka, who had spent the war years in Moscow and was now a leading member of the so- called Ulbricht Group, comprising trusted German exiles hurriedly flown in from Moscow to fill the power vacuum arising from the military defeat in Germany of the Nazi government. Following the meeting with Sobottka, Geffke was mandated to head up the in Stettin-Krekow. This one of several such institutions established in 1945, briefly, in different parts of Germany under the auspices of the Soviet sponsored National Committee for a Free Germany (\\"Nationalkomitee Freies Deutschland\\" / NKFD). She quickly joined Sobottka's \\"Initiative Group\\", becoming a member of the Communist Party regional leadership and secretariat in June 1945. Between June 1945 and March 1946 she was in charge of the regional youth department ( for the newly (and at this point temporarily) created state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. In 1946 she became a member of the executive of the Mecklenburg advisory assembly (\\"Beratenden Versammlung\\"), a precursor of the (1946‚Äì1952) (\\"Landtag\\") of which she was a member between October 1946 and October 1950, serving as a deputy vice- president of the assembly. (Following the abolition of the regional tier of government in 1952, both the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and its \\"Landtag\\" would be abolished for administrative purposes, although both were revived in 1990.) Alongside her role in the regional parliament, she held important party responsibilities. From April 1946 she served as regional women's secretary for the Mecklenburg Party Executive. Following the controversial creation that month of the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) she was one of many thousands who had lost no time in signing their Communist Party membership across to what now evolved into the ruling party for a new kind of one-party dictatorship. From 1947 she became a member of the regional party secretariat for Brandenburg. During 1947/48 she was also a member of the national executive of the politically important Confederation of Antifascists (\\"Bund der Antifaschistinnen und Antifaschisten\\" /BdA). On the national stage within the Soviet occupation zone, from March 1948 till May 1949 Geffke was a member of the People's Council (\\"Deutscher Volksrat\\"), an appointed chamber mandated to develop and endorse the proposed constitution drawn up by the SED (party). In May 1949 the assembly declared itself to be a \\"provisional parliament\\", and following the General election of October 1950 (in which, reassuringly, more than 99% of the electorate endorsed the ruling party's candidate list), it did indeed become the national parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\"). Herta Geffke was never a candidate nor a member of the Volkskammer, however. German Democratic Republic In October 1949 the part of Germany administered since May 1945 as the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic, a separated German state with its political institutions consciously modelled on those of the Soviet Union itself. Under the Leninist system, the state's power was focused not on any parliament or government ministers, but on the ruling party, and within the party (except when a party congress was in session) on the party central committee. Right from the birth of the state in 1949 Herta Geffke was active as an energetic official inside the party central committee. In March 1949 she became a department head in the Central Secretariat if the Party Executive and a member of the newly instituted Central Party Control Commission (\\"Zentrale Parteikontrollkommission\\" / ZPKK), retaining this membership till October 1958. This meant that, working alongside , she was responsible for keeping the party cleansed \\"of enemy and degenerate elements\\" (\\"von feindlichen und entarteten Elementen\\") during the 1950s. A specific investigation which she headed up, and which quickly acquired fame and/or notoriety, was the special ZPKK commission, starting in November 1949, to check out the contacts of party members with the US born spy Noel Field. Between 1954 and 1958 she served as deputy chair of the ZPKK. One source describes her in the role as \\"the archetypal harsh and uncompromising Stalinist functionary\\" (\\"der Prototyp einer bedingungslosen und harten stalinistischen Funktion√§rin\\"). Contemporaries who encountered her during the course of the Noel Field investigations recall interrogation sessions lasting many hours, conducted without signs of any significant emotional engagement. Following the 1956 Party Congress in Moscow, at which Comrade Kruschev's so- called \\"secret\\" speech greatly alarmed the Stalinist traditionalists who controlled East Germany, Herta Geffke and her (party commission) were responsible for a large number of party resolutions and retributive actions that some forty years later (after the changes of 1989/90) would trigger judicial rehabilitation decisions. In October 1958, the year of her sixty- fifth birthday, she was removed from the ZPKK and took on the top job in the personnel department (\\"Kaderabteilung\\") at the party central committee's (Institute for Social Sciences). She held this post till her retirement in June 1962. Herta Geffke died in East Berlin on 29 December 1974.

It offered arts and science programs for women as well as programs, such as drama, for men that were unavailable at Fordham University, which, at that time, only admitted men into its undergraduate programs. While the undergraduate school of Fordham University only admitted men, many of Fordham's graduate schools, such as the School of Education, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Law School, College of Pharmacy and School of Social Service were coeducational. Thomas More College, however, provided women the opportunity to earn an undergraduate liberal arts degree.  History (1964 and beyond)  In 1963, Thomas More College was expected to take in 400 students in its first year with the goal of eventually increasing enrollment to 2,200 students. The report of the Middle States Association in 1950 stated: \\"It would be undesirable to propose that women be admitted to Fordham College because of its long tradition.\\" So, instead of making Fordham co-educational, the University decided instead to establish a women's college with a unique name and name \\"right on the campus where the little bluestockings could sit beside the boys in class without making Fordham College co-educational.\\" At Rose Hill, the all-female school began instruction in 1964.Schroth, SJ, Raymond. Fordham: A History and Memoir. Revised ed. New York: Fordham UP, 2008. Print. Rev. John W. Donohue was the first dean of Thomas More College until 1966. Then, he returned to the School of Education as an associate professor and Dr. Patricia R. Plante became the first woman dean. Sir John Rothenstein, who had directed London's Tate Gallery for 27 years, was a visiting Art Professor at the fine-arts department of Thomas More College in 1967. Dean Barbara Wells was both dean and associate professor of government at Fordham's Thomas More College since 1968. In 1971, she became the deal of faculty at Vassar College. The curriculum at Thomas More College included a semester on \\"The Contemporary American\\" which was an interdisciplinary take on the subject through literature, art, philosophy and theology. From 1964-1965, the curriculum emphasized classical and modern liberal arts as opposed to professional subjects. Also, unlike other primarily women's schools, such as New Rochelle or Barnard, Thomas More did not include more courses and disciplines traditionally associated with women's subjects. In 1967, about 150 women from the Thomas More College petitioned to add a class on birth control to the curriculum. This petition requested three things: \\"That a general education program in birth control include lectures on moral, medical and sociological aspects; that theologians, physicians, sociologists and psychologists serve as lecturers; and that a qualified physician be available in the university infirmary or counseling service to answer any questions they may have on the subject.\\" In response, Dr. Meade, the Vice President and Dean of Students, recommended symposiums about marriage that \\"dealt with the biological, social, psychological and philosophical aspects of marriage. They explained the permanent relation between mature man and mature woman.\\"  Merge with Fordham University  In 1969, the board of trustees was reorganized to include a majority of nonclerical members, which officially made the university an independent institution. The College of Pharmacy closed due to declining enrollment in 1972. Fordham College at Rose Hill merged with Thomas More College in 1974, becoming coeducational.

It is fully open and signed. Between Hornsea and York it forms the eastern end of the Trans Pennine Trail. The section between York and Linton-on-Ouse is part of the Way of the Roses. In 1998 Route 65 between Hull and Middlesbrough was branded The White Rose cycle route. This branding is no longer in use.  Route = Hornsea to Hull  This part of the route runs almost entirely along the dismantled trackbed of the Hull and Hornsea Railway and is known as the Hornsea Rail Trail. The path takes a straight route over the flat Holderness plain and is in length.  Hull to York  Cycle route on former ECML route between Escrick and Naburn Route 65 avoids the Yorkshire Wolds by running along the banks of the Humber Estuary, passing under the Humber Bridge. A very flat route, there is a small climb at Welton. Mainly on quiet country lanes as far as Selby, there are several short traffic-free sections. From Selby to York the route uses the trackbed of the old East Coast Mainline railway, which was bought by Sustrans for ¬£1 and turned into one of its very first traffic-free paths. On a section of this path is a scale model of the Solar System. NCN Route 66 provides an alternative route between Hull and York.  York to Middlesbrough  Following a traffic-free route out of York, the rest of the route is almost entirely on quiet country lanes. North of York, NCN 65 passes Beningbrough Hall. There are two routes here, the path through the National Trust grounds is one-way, so the northbound path is routed around the perimeter. At Easingwold, Route 65 leaves the flat for the first time as it approaches the North York Moors. Running along the foothills there are several short steep climbs/descents. The route climbs over the North Western edge of the North York Moors, passing to the east of Osmotherley. Its high point is reached via a long steep climb up a forestry commission path. The route in Middlesbrough is mainly traffic free. Route 65 forms part of the Way of the Roses Challenge route between York (junction with NCN 658) and Linton-on-Ouse (junction with NCN 688).  Developments  The route through York was improved in April 2019 with the Scarborough Bridge improvements. The steep steps and narrow deck have been replaced by ramps and a 3.7m wide path.  History  The original route north of York consisted of three branches all numbered as Route 65. In 2009 Sustrans introduced 3 digit numbers for shorter local routes and two of the three branches of Route 65 were renumbered. The Thirsk branch became Route 657 and the High Level Option is now Route 656. The Low Level Option remains as Route 65.  Millennium Mileposts  There are over 1,000 Mileposts on the National Cycle Network.

She was a woman in science making large contributions to geology and advancements for women in science. She had a long lasting career at the United States Geological Survey in Washington, D.C. and Denver, Colorado soon becoming well known for her research and important discoveries. Cannon, along with two colleagues at USGS, set up and participated in the first organized unit studying chemicals in the real environment. The team concluded that by analyzing plants in a given area they could determine what metals were present in the soil and earth in that same area. In 1952, Cannon published a paper based on the findings and this paved the way for more research in geology and plants, geobotany. This research developed further into an important association with health issues, including cancer, as well as aided the United States to find uranium deposits during the Cold War. As an author, she has been largely collected by libraries.  Early life and education  Helen L. Cannon was born in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania on April 29, 1911. As a young child, she was encouraged by her father to observe the biodiversity along the Pennsylvanian countryside. This fostered her love for science and life. Cannon enrolled in Cornell University for a degree in applied sciences, graduating in 1932. She remained involved in academics, participating in postgraduate work at Northwestern University before enrolling for a Master's of Science degree from Pittsburgh University. Cannon received her M.S. in geology in 1934 and continued research in academics before joining a staff of geologists working for the Gulf Oil Company in 1935.  Career  In 1932, once Cannon finished her degree in applied science at Cornell University, New York, she continued to further her education by attending other Universities for post graduate work in geology until 1935. She then got her first job in Saginaw, Michigan at Gulf Oil Company. After spending three years with this company Cannon moved again, first to Washington, D.C., then to Denver, Colorado. There she set roots and began her career of more than 40 years at the U.S. Geological Survey. Cannon was the third woman to work for the company and dedicated her entire career to doing research for them. With this company, Cannon formed the first geochemical exploration with colleagues Lyman Huff and Herb Hawkes.  Contributions to geography and geology  During her career as a scientist, Cannon focused on geobotany and the effects of metals on vegetation. Cannon worked on many pieces in these subjects. One of her works was on the method of using indicator plants to determine where uranium deposits might be. Hardier indicator plants that could withstand being in an environment with uranium were used to find out which locations were more likely to contain uranium in the ground. Uranium in an area could also be determined by looking at the chemical make up of certain plants to try to detect certain elements. This helped find new locations of uranium, specifically focusing on the Colorado Plateau. This was done using an indicator plant known as Astragalus pattersoni, which requires trace amounts of selenium to grow. Selenium was an element commonly found in uranium ore deposits making it easy to spot uranium from above ground. Cannon also contributed to geological patterns found in the areas she studied. Her 1952 journal focused on uranium and vanadium and the effects these metals had on the vegetation in the area. This introduced geobotany to the scientific stage.  Death  Cannon died on October 20, 1996 at the age of 93 in her Santa Fe, Mexico home.  Awards and honors  Cannon has received numerous awards and honors in her lifetime, including becoming the first woman in an all men's science group to have a membership. This group was known as American Men in Science and was an important event that other American women and men respected. Cannon also attained memberships in Geological Society of America, Geology and Public Policy Committee, American Association for the Advancement of Science, Association of Exploration Geochemists and the Society of Environmental Geochemistry. In 1970 the United States Department of the Interior Department of the Interior awarded Cannon the Meritorious Service award and five years later she received the topmost award known as the Distinguished Service Award from her continuous work at the Department of the Interior. With Cannon's discoveries relating trace elements affecting health, she became associated with the National Research Council and was given subcommittee chair on the Geochemical Environment in Relation to Health and Disease.

It is inspired by but not based on the 1960 Lake Bodom murders, telling story of a group of Finnish friends, whose decide to go camping by Lake Bodom to do a reconstruction of the 1960 murders, but something goes wrong. Bodom was invited to Cannes for an event organized by the March√© du Film, for which the films were chosen by a joint jury of the organizers of the event (the Cannes Film Market and the Canadian Fronti√®res Film Event).  Plot  Nora, Elias, Atte and Ida, group of friend, go to Lake Bodom to camp to reconstruct the 1960 murders there. Ida has been rejected at school for her nude pictures. Her fascination with Elias is accused of taking pictures. At night at Bodom, with Ida and Atte in the tent, someone grabs them through the tent. Atte goes out, with a mystical figure stabbing him. Nora and Elias run to the scene, but too late. The dying Atte tells them to escape before the killer returns to the tent. The trio tries to escape the car, but Nora's leg twitches, and she asks Elias and Ida to continue. Elias tries to explain to the angry Ida that he has never taken any nude pictures of her. At that moment, a mystical figure stabs Elias from behind, killing him. Nora, who has plotted with Ida all the way to kill Elias and Atte, who ruined Ida's life, is revealed as a stabber. The girls put on protective clothing and throw the boys' bodies into Lake Bodom. The girls plan to escape with their car, but realize that the car keys are in Elias' pocket. Ida desperately dives into the lake to pick up the keys. Nora can see the movement in the woods of the lake. Ida, who has a cold on a car ride, asks Nora if her nude photos really exist. Nora breaks down and reveals that she is in love with Elias, and could not bear to glow this from Elias. At the student party, Nora makes Ida passing out by drinking and took her to bed to sleep. After that, it began to spread the rumor by Nora about Ida‚Äôs nude pictures, which didn‚Äôt really exist. Nora lied to Ida that Elias had taken the pictures. Ida hoped Elias and Atte would die, at which point the duo began planning a boys' killing trip. Ida is shocked to hear the truth and threatens to tell everything, with Nora hitting her in the face with a wrench. Ida gets angry and attacks Nora, who is driving the car. The girls drive into the ditch. An unknown man offers to help the girls and tow them after him. Nora asks Ida for the knife with which she killed Atte, but there is no knife. The girls realize that the man driving the car is a murderer, at which point the tow truck driven by the man begins to accelerate so that the girls car flies to its roof. Ida is injured in a crash and is unable to move. Nora tries to escape, but the man's hound catches Nora. Nora and Ida wake up from the campfire with their heads in potato strands and their mouths clogged. The man throws the girls from his murder tent and kills Nora in front of Ida's eyes. At dawn, Ida wakes up from the yard of her own house in shock. The bodies of Nora and the boys are found and Ida is accused of the murders of her friends, and no one believes the truth told by Ida. The case is widely reported and inspired by new campers arriving at Lake Bodom. But without everyone knowing, the mysterious murderer still lurks all those who have entered the woods.

DuBois on behalf of Norman Thomas for President in 1928. McAlister Coleman (1888 ‚Äì 1950) was an American journalist, author, and political activist on behalf of socialism and organized labor. Coleman gained public notice as a leading liberal critic of the Lusk Committee of the New York State Legislature in 1920. He was subsequently a frequent candidate for public office on the ticket of the Socialist Party of America. Coleman is today best remembered as an early biographer of Eugene V. Debs as well as the author of a 1943 work of social history, Men and Coal. Biography=Early years McAlister Coleman was born July 4, 1888, in New York City.Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole (eds.), \\"McAlister Coleman,\\" in American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 45. His father, John Caldwell Coleman, was a successful attorney and prominent figure in liberal New York Republican Party political circles.\\"McAlister Coleman, Journalist, Author, Ex-Socialist Candidate,\\" Brooklyn Eagle, May 19, 1950, pg. 15. Coleman enrolled at Columbia University in New York City, from which he graduated in 1909. After graduation, he worked as a journalist, first taking a position with the New York Sun. During the course of his work as a New York journalist, Coleman covered the New York garment workers strike of 1909-1910 as well as the catastrophic Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1912. These experiences had a radicalizing effect and not long after the Triangle fire he joined the Socialist Party of America (SPA) and ‚Äî while still working for the Sun ‚Äî Coleman began contributing articles to the SPA's New York daily newspaper, the New York Call. Coleman left the Sun in 1913 and went to work in the field of advertising and public relations, first taking a position with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, before leaving in 1914 to join the Frank Presbrey Advertising Agency. In 1916, Coleman left the Presbrey agency to take a new position as a copywriter for the Berrien Advertising Agency. He would remain at that position until 1922, interrupted only by a stint in the Army Engineers during World War I. Coleman was twice married, marrying the former Elizabeth Bache Gould in April 1916,\\"(McAlister Coleman to Marry),\\" Washington Herald, April 21, 1916, pg. 7. before remarrying Dr. Ruth Fox in 1931. He was the father of two children, a daughter and a son. Political career A tireless propagandist for the socialist cause, Coleman was the author of two Little Blue Books sponsored by the Socialist Party of America in 1931. In 1920, Coleman entered the public eye as a prominent critic of the Lusk Committee of the New York state legislature ‚Äî an investigative agency established in March 1919 which conducted a series of raids on the Russian Soviet Government Bureau (the de facto Soviet embassy), the Rand School of Social Science, and other radical institutions in New York City. Coleman was the editor of a March 1920 report entitled The Truth About the Lusk Committee, which charged that the Lusk Committee and its Assistant Counsel and leading light Archibald E. Stevenson had accomplished little more than aiding the arrest and conviction of Big Jim Larkin and Benjamin Gitlow and two hapless Finnish language newspaper editors and spur on the widely condemned expulsion of five elected Socialist legislators from the New York State Assembly, all the while illegally overspending its legislative appropriation.McAlister Coleman (ed.), The Truth About the Lusk Committee. (Editor.) New York: The Nation Press, March 1920; pp. 3-4. In 1920 Coleman was arrested in Meriden, Connecticut for conducting a series of socialist street meetings without a public permit.\\"No Legal Control Over Free Speech,\\" Boston Post, April 29, 1921, pg. 15. Convicted and levied a nominal $25 fine, Coleman appealed the case all the way to the Connecticut Supreme Court as a test of freedom of speech rights, ultimately seeing his conviction overturned with the finding that state and local ordinances giving public officials control over citizens' permission to speak were unconstitutional. Coleman became assistant editor of The Illinois Miner in 1922, remaining with that publication until 1923. He also was a frequent contributor to a wide array of liberal and radical periodicals, including The New Republic, Labor Age, The Survey, and The Nation. From the early 1920s onward, Coleman was active in the League for Industrial Democracy (LID) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). During the middle 1920s he was active in the Conference for Progressive Political Action (CPPA), a political organization bringing together socialist and non-socialist political figures with a view to starting a new labor party in the United States. Coleman was particularly active as a reporter of the conditions and affairs of American coal miners throughout the 1920s, traveling the country as a corresponding journalist for the labor press and publicly lecturing to mine workers under the auspices of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA).\\"Will Discuss Coal Struggle: McAlister Coleman, New York Journalist, to Address Miners,\\" Decatur [IL] Herald, Jan. 5, 1926, pg. 11. He traveled to West Virginia in 1925 to cover the bitter union organizing campaign there, suffering incarceration along with 200 others after being arrested at one non-union mine.\\"Guarantee of Civil Liberties is Asked,\\" Bluefield [WV] Daily Telegraph, May 19, 1925, pg. 9. Coleman was frequently a candidate for public office. In the fall of 1928 Coleman stood as the nominee of the Socialist Party for United States Senate in New York state.\\"Politicians Yield Ether to Women in Week's Battle,\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Oct. 14, 1928, pg. 65. Coleman also ran as the Socialist nominee in the New York State Senate in 1930, for United State Congress from New York in both 1937 and 1938, and once again running for US Senate, this time from New Jersey, in 1940.Lawrence Kastenbaum (ed.), \\"McAlister Coleman,\\" Political Graveyard.com, www.politicalgraveyard.com/ Coleman was a close political associate of six- time Socialist candidate for President of the United States Norman Thomas. Together with Thomas, Coleman sought move aside the so-called \\"Old Guard\\" of the party by working to develop an alternative Militant faction, youth- oriented and tending towards particularly radical political rhetoric. To this end, Coleman is credited by historian Jack Ross as the author of the first explicit document of the Militant faction's ideas, a 1931 pamphlet called A Militant Program for the Socialist Party of America: Socialism in Our Time.Jack Ross, The Socialist Party of America: A Complete History. Lincoln, NE: Potomac Books, 2015; pg. 310. Later years In the late 1930s, Coleman moved to Newark, New Jersey and took a position working for the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) as its publicity director.\\"CIO Director to Speak at University,\\" Barnard [NY] Bulletin, Feb. 8, 1938, pg. 4. Generally a publicist rather than a scholar or a historian, Coleman was the author of a broad array of pamphlets and magazine articles, but few longer works. One notable exception was his wartime magnum opus on coal miners and coal mining, Men and Coal, published by Farrar and Rinehart in the fall of 1943.\\"Men and Coal, by McAlister Coleman,\\" Kirkus Reviews, Oct. 21, 1943. Coleman provided a sympathetic portrait of the miners and their daily struggle to earn a living in the mining industry, while providing a mixed review of the personality and performance of mine workers' labor leader John L. Lewis, both criticizing him for instability and opportunism while acknowledging his achievements in organizing miners for higher wages and better working conditions. Death and legacy McAlister Coleman died on May 18, 1950, at his home in Manhattan. He was 62 years old at the time of his death. Coleman was eulogized in the contemporary press as the \\"[Socialist] Party's public relations man,\\" having worked tirelessly alongside SPA leader Norman Thomas writing pamphlets and letters to the press in an effort to advance the socialist cause.\\"Battler for Socialism,\\" Bradford [PA] Era, June 23, 1950, pg. 10.

This publication is still highly influential in the making of agricultural policies and procedures in Nebraska and surrounding Great Plains states. It is owned by media company Penton.  History  Founded in 1859 by Robert Wilkinson Furnas the journal was published eight years before the territory of Nebraska would become a state and wrote for \\"the experiences of those who have been cultivating our own soil\\". Over the years since its publication the Nebraska Farmer has always been dedicated to serving the diverse geographic regions of the state. Being an assistance to farmers that plant a wide variety of crops and a leading ranching and cattle region in the county. Robert Furnas worked as the editor for the paper, which was published as monthly, until 1862 when he was called to fight in the American Civil War. With movement ownership and uncertainty of state affairs Nebraska Farmer was discontinued on and off and did not regain the stability of its early years for a few decades. The paper was first reissued as a weekly paper with Abraham Deyo as the editor in 1872. The paper stayed afloat for two years, was closed in 1874, and was then reopened once again in January 1877 by J. C. McBride. This iteration of the paper had a lot of difficulties and in 1898 moved to Omaha and was consolidated into The Cultivator. A paper under the title of Nebraska Farmer would not be published again in the state until in 1905 Samuel Roy McKelvie was offered the position to revive the editorship. The publication plant was moved back to Lincoln, Nebraska and McKelvie began a successful expansion of paper. By focusing on issues like irrigation, unburdening taxes on farmers, or crop rotation the Farmer focused on agriculture and the states politics. Other agricultural journals were consolidated into the Farmer, such as the Twentieth Century Farmer in 1918 and the Nebraska Farm Journal in 1928. McKelvie remained Nebraska Farmer publisher until his death in 1956. The company continued to expand, launching Colorado Rancher and Farmer in 1947 (now part of the Western Farmer-Stockman) and creating the Husker Harvest Days farm show near Grand Island, Nebraska, in 1978. In the late 1960s, Nebraska Farmer was purchased by Harcourt, Brace & World. In 1991, Farm Progress Companies purchased it and other Harcourt Brace farm publications.

She was a geologist who specialized in petroleum exploration, drilling, and refining. Although she did not have many of her own publications, she made many important contributions by editing.  Education  Slamon started her education as a young girl at Columbia Preparatory School in Rochester, New York. She also attended St. Agatha's School in New York City. Although she was originally interested in studying French, with some encouragement from her first geology teacher Howard Meyerhoff, Salmon quickly discovered her passion for geology and adjusted her scholarly goals. She attended Smith College and in 1932 graduated with distinction as an undergraduate in geology. Salmon was elected into Phi Beta Kappa as well as graduating magna cum laude, both high honors for a liberal arts and her science major. In 1942, she earned her Ph.D. in geology at Columbia University.  Career  After receiving her Ph.D., Salmon had difficulty finding work in the geology job market as she was not respected within the geology community because she was a woman; she decided to use her skills in chemistry to work as an analytical and specialized chemist in Brooklyn at the Vacuum Oil Company in the Technical Service Laboratory (1942‚Äì1946). Geology was largely viewed as a male profession at the time, which made it difficult for her to find a job within her desired field. However, she eventually became the managing editor of the Catalog of Foraminifera, which she had previously worked on at the American Museum of Natural History in 1942. Thirteen years later, Salmon joined the American Petroleum Institute Central Abstracting and Indexing Service in New York where she put her language skills to good use. She was required to work from English, French, German, Italian and Russian language sources while she worked as an abstractor for the Drilling and Exploration Bulletin. In 1966 Salmon went on to become the editor of the Refining Bulletin, as well as becoming the editor of an alternate energy sources bulletin. Though she had few published works of her own, Salmon excelled at editing and found satisfaction in her work. Even after her retirement in 1975, including dealing with health issues related to emphysema, Salmon continued to work freelance for the American Petroleum Institute as well as providing services as a translator for the French Bureau de Recherches G√©ologiques et Miniferes.  Catalog of foraminifera  During Salmon's time at the American Museum of Natural History in 1942, she worked as an assistant to Angelina Messina who was a curator of micropaleontology. Together they prepared catalogs of foraminifera, which are tiny organisms that provide vital information to geologists about ancient climates within their fossilized chambers. With Salmon's help, Messina's work was internationally recognized and their 69-volume catalog of foraminifera was used in universities and in every micropaleontological laboratory for large oil companies. Their work classifying the American Museum of Natural History's foraminifera collection continues to be used by paleontologists, geologists, and climate scientists today.  Groups and organizations  Salmon was a prominent member of the Geological Society of America, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists; though she was also a member of many groups outside of her educational and professional field. Salmon believed in equality for all, and was a member in several charities and non-profit organizations, such as the American Civil Liberties Union which aimed at protecting the rights of individuals, The Nature Conservancy which focuses on land and water conservation, and the Society of Sigma Xi, which combines both her passion for science and equality. She was also a member of the National Organization for Women, an American feminist organization.  Publications = A Molluscan Faunule from the Pierre Formation in Eastern Montana  In 1934, Salmon and co-author Horace N. Coryell published a report in The American Museum of Natural History detailing the fossil findings of Theron Wasson, Chief Geologist of the Pure Oil Company. It summarizes the stratigraphy of the Pierre formation south of Glendive, Montana where the fossils were obtained, along with a more detailed lithographic description of the member in which the fossils occur, and especially of the concretions in which they are found. There is also a list of fossils of this faunule, mostly Mollusca and a few new species. The species included in this list consist of eight Gastropoda, ten Caphalopoda, fifteen Pelecypoda (now referred to as Bivalvia, two Scaphopoda (or Tusk shells), and the two new species being ammonoid Cephalopoda, coming to a total of thirty-five species. A discussion of the classification and nomenclature of one of Meek‚Äôs species of Cephalopoda is also included.  Salmon, Eleanor S. ‚ÄúMohawkian Rafinesquinae.‚Äù Journal of Paleontology, vol. 16, no. 5, 1942.  In September 1982, Salmon authored a journal entry, \\"Mohawkian Rafinesquinae\\" into the \\"Journal of Paleontology\\". In this report Salmon, talks about the species of the brachiopod genus, Rafinesquinae, which have been found in the Middle Ordovician (Mohawkian). Salmon talks about how the species differ, in terms of their geography around them, she also lists off how the geology under each species stratigraphic range, differs the structural breakup of the species. Salmon offers many discussions upon her topics giving her personal and professional standpoint. Personal life Salmon remained unmarried, and never had any children of her own. After she died, her funeral was held at Riverside Cemetery in Rochester, New York. Her burial plot can be found in section G of the cemetery.

Located off the Farnborough Road opposite the former West Cavalry Barracks, nearby are the Royal Garrison Church and the Wellington Statue. It was dismantled in the early 1960s. Today the site is the location of the Royal Pavilion Office Park. Origins of the Royal Pavilion The dining room in the Royal Pavilion in 1900 Queen Victoria's sitting room in the Pavilion in 1900 Queen Victoria's boudoir in the Pavilion in 1900 Before the establishment of the 'Camp at Aldershot', the British Army did not have any single permanent camp for training troops on a large scale. Prince Albert realised that the training and resources of the British Army compared unfavourably with some European armies and lobbied for something to be done. In 1852, following the death of The Iron Duke, a group of reformers, which included Prince Albert, forged an alliance that would seek to improve the training of the Army. Consequently, in January 1854 some 25,000 acres of Aldershot Heath were purchased with the view to setting up a permanent military camp in the area. As Queen Victoria and Prince Albert showed a keen interest in the establishment and the development of Aldershot as a garrison town, on 2 April 1854 Prince Albert, accompanied by Lord Hardinge, Major General Sir Frederick Smith and a Lieutenant Nicholson inspected a number of sites in the Aldershot area before selecting a small hill overlooking the Long Valley and Caesar's Camp. Prince Albert instructed Lieutenant Nicholson to ride around the approved site dropping sticks from a bundle of pea sticks to mark the boundaries for the proposed Pavilion.Howard N. Cole, The Story of Aldershot: a History of the Civil and Military Towns, Gale & Polden, Aldershot (1951) p45 In 1855 the Royal Pavilion was built by George Myers, one of the contractors involved in building the nearby Camp, as a temporary residence in the style of a wooden pavilion. Myers is best known as the builder employed by Augustus Pugin to execute the majority of his designs. One of the first buildings to be erected in the new Camp, the Pavilion is recorded as having had \\"graceful timberwork, looking oddly like C20 Scandinavian and an impressive testimony to Prince Albert's modernity\\".Pevsner, Nikolaus, and David LLoyd, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Buildings of England series, London: Penguin books, (1967) Victoria and Albert would often stay at the Pavilion when attending reviews of the Army on the nearby Long Valley.Cole (1980), p45 The design On 10 June 1855 Queen Victoria made her first visit to the Royal Pavilion and, following an inspection of the Camp took refreshments in the Pavilion. Her first stay there was in April 1856 on the occasion of her inspecting 14,000 troops at Aldershot. Queen Victoria \\"was delighted with [the building's] simplicity, the charming views from its windows and its seclusion\\" and she painted some of these views during her visits to Aldershot.Cole (1951), p45 A writer for The Illustrated London News, however, was less enthusiastic, writing of the Pavilion that \\"The design was of three sides of a square - bald, cold and ugly to an extreme. The whole Pavilion is built entirely of wood - not a single brick has been used in its construction.\\"The Queen's Visit to Aldershott - Illustrated London News, 26 April 1856 Its pine wood walls were painted white and the shutters on either side of each window were painted green.Cole (1951), p376 The Pavilion's interior walls and ceilings were made of canvas stretched over a wooden frame and papered over. The building had a breakfast room, drawing room, large dining room with salon and a study for Prince Albert. There were four large bedrooms - one each for Albert and Victoria and two more for important guests.John Walters, Aldershot Review, Jarrolds (1970) p26 The terrace had a small artificial pond with goldfish. With stabling for 40 horses,Walters, p27 the kitchen and servants' quarters were nearby in a detached building at the rear of the Pavilion and on a lower level. The kitchens were connected to the Pavilion by way of an underground passage with a glass roof half way along its length.Cole (1951), p377 Royal residence George V and Queen Mary with members of the Royal Family and senior military figures at the Pavilion in 1921 In 1879 the Royal Pavilion was occupied for a period by the Duke of Connaught after his wedding,Cole (1951), p148 while in March 1903 it was occupied by Edward VII and Queen Alexandra.Cole (1951), p163 George V and Queen Mary were regular visitors early in their reign. When they were staying at the Pavilion in 1914, however, the local police were kept busy preventing Suffragettes from getting into the grounds. The Royal Family did not return to the Pavilion until 1923 to attend one of the famous military tattoos being held nearby. In 1935 it became the residence of Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester near the barracks of the Duke's regiment where the Duke was taking the Army staff course. \\"It was a very simple cabin\\" recalled the Duchess of Gloucester, and \\"the only royal thing about it was my husband's presence\\".Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, The Memoirs of Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester (1981) Later uses The former Guardroom is a listed buildingFormer Guardroom to Royal Pavilion, Aldershot - British Listed Buildings website During World War II the Royal Pavilion came under the control of Aldershot and District Borough Council when it became the officers' mess for the Canadian Army Overseas. From March to June 1944 it was the Headquarters for the 11th Armoured Division, and from November 1944 it became \\"B\\" Mess for the Headquarters Aldershot Division. From January to July 1948 it was the officers' mess for the 2nd Battalion the Royal Tank Regiment, after which from July 1948 to May 1949 it was taken over by the 3rd Battalion the Coldstream Guards. From 1951 the Royal Pavilion had become the officers' mess for 13 Command Workshops REME. After the Pavilion was dismantled the site was used in 1963 to build a Training Centre for the Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps (QARANC) with Princess Margaret laying the foundation stone. Facilities included a drill square, small gym, learning centre, single roomed accommodation, dining hall, kitchens, NAAFI coffee bar and lounge area, QARANC Museum, (now at Keogh Barracks, Ash Vale), a guardroom, courtyard, an officers' mess and accommodation.

The countries highlighted in green are considered to be a part of Central Africa. This image shows part of the rainforest that covers half of Central Africa. This image was taken in Gabon. Central Africa is generally considered to encompass ten countries (Cameroon, south-Chad, Central African Republic (CAR), Equatorial Guinea, Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Burundi, Angola) which amounts to more than six million square kilometers or roughly the size of the United States west of the Mississippi River. Despite its large size, very little archaeological research has been done in the region.  Research  Archaeological research has been scarce in Central Africa. One reason is that half of Central Africa is covered by rainforest. Because of this many archaeologists believed prehistoric occupation was improbable and, if there had been, preservation would be low. Because of the rainforest and the poverty in the area, infrastructure is underdeveloped, which makes traveling to possible sites difficult. Central Africa has also had high outbreaks of deadly diseases such as AIDS and Ebola fever, and has also experienced numerous ‚Äúcoups d‚Äôetat, prolonged civil wars, and even genocide.‚Äù The first archaeological research was completed in the early 1900s. Modern studies began in the 1960s, and more systematic studies were completed from 1980-1990. The most recent research has focused on creating regional chronologies.  Early habitation  Archaeologists questioned if humans could survive only on forest resources before the emergence of agriculture. Research done by Els Cornelissen et al suggests that occupation was possible before agriculture and may have actually been very hospitable. Because of the ecodiversity of the area, the people inhabiting the area would have had access to a variety of resources, making it a more stable environment to live in. The area colored in light purple is the general area where Denbow researched. Evidence of some of the earliest inhabitants was found in 1982 and 1983 by J. Preuss at Bikoro in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Preuss found a number of stone artifacts including projectile points, ‚Äúsegments, cores, flakes, and unmodified waste‚Äù. These artifacts would have been used by hunter-gatherers and are estimated to have been made during the Late Stone Age between 12,000-3,000 years BP. More research in the 1980s found picks, choppers and, hand-axes representative of the Middle Stone Age. Clist argues that these tools could be 40,000 years old, meaning humans have been occupying the area for at least 40,000 years. More recently, James Denbow excavated and dated sites on the Loango Coast between Gabon and Cabinda. He dated sites only as early as approximately 3250 BP- 2050 BP. These 10 sites \\"produced only lithic debris... were very small and contained concentrations of chert flakes and fragments.\\"  Gray Sand  Gray Sand is a pre-ceramic Later Stone Age (LSA) site that is located 10 kilometers north of the mouth of the Kouilou River. This site dates to approximately 3342-2888 BP. This site was a non-ceramic LSA site where archaeologists recovered \\"42 chert and 265 quartzite flakes and fragments [but] no formal stone tools...\\" The quartzite could be locally found but the chert could have only been found approximately 50 kilometers east in the Mayombe Mountains. Chert made up almost 14 percent of lithics found at the site which indicates that people living at Gray Sand had interactions or territories as far as the Mayombe Mountains. Later lithic material, from approximately 2461-2147 BP, was found in the stratigraphy above the LSA lithics which showed a preference for local quartzite.  Transition to Iron Age  The Late Stone age in Central Africa ended approximately 3,500 years ago. By 3500 - 3000 years BP, the climate and the environment had changed as well as the peoples and practices of peoples inhabiting the region. A shift from rainforest to savanna created an opportune environment for farming. Oslisly et al suggest that by approximately 3500 BP the hunter gatherers living in Central Africa were pushed out by agricultural migrants from the north. These early agriculturalists are differentiated by dug garbage pits which differs from waste practices of earlier inhabitants. During the Neolithic phase, 3500‚Äì2000 years BP, ‚Äúnew technologies such as pottery and stone polishing‚Äù developed and were mastered. The presence of stone hoes indicates that the new inhabitants were farming. A debate has emerged as to whether the vegetation change occurring at the time was due to climate change or agricultural practices. Because the vegetation change was contemporaneous with the Bantu Expansion, or \\"the migration of Bantu-speaking farmers across Central Africa,\\" the chronology could be correct.  Akon√©tye  Akon√©tye is a small village in Southern Cameroon where, beginning in 2004, Conny Meister and Manfred Eggert excavated sites. There are two sites, one to the north of the modern city of Akon√©tye, called the northern site, and one to the south of the modern city, called the southern site. At the southern site, Meister and Eggert believe they have found the oldest graves containing iron in Central Africa. = Southern Site = Radiocarbon dates place the excavated pits in the southern site to the ‚Äúfirst half of the first millennium AD.‚Äù At the southern site, Meister and Eggert found what is believed to be the oldest graves containing iron in Central Africa. In feature AKO 05/6 no skeletal material was found, but the ‚Äúcontent as well as the content‚Äôs arrangement suggested that they are graves. This interpretation is supported by the discovery of bone residue during the preparation and conservation of the iron bracelets.‚Äù Feature AKO 05/2, yielded ‚Äúthree almost complete ceramic vessels, several iron bracelets and two socketed iron hoes, both of which [were] decorated.‚Äù No skeletal remains were found at this feature either, however, decomposed bone material was again found. Meister and Eggert also believe that this was a grave. The third and final grave was discovered in feature AKO 05/6. This grave was marked by ‚Äúintentionally deposited, party worked stones‚Äù and inside three pots and iron offerings, including an iron spoon, double- diamond shaped iron objects, were found. Also found were iron bracelets, and an iron axe and hoe.  The Later Iron Age and Historic Period  There is a gap in the archaeological record between the Early Iron Age and the Later Iron Age, from about 1050 - 850 years BP. The time after the Early Iron Age can be broken into ‚Äútwo broad categories based on vessel shape, decoration, and the presence or absence of European trade groups.‚ÄùThe first of the two categories will be referred to as Phase 1 Later Iron Age which dates from approximately 850 - 450 years BP. The second of the two categories will be referred to as Phase 2 Later Iron Age: The Historic Period, which dates from about 450 - 50 years BP.  Phase 1 Later Iron Age  Very few sites could be definitely dated to Phase 1 of the Later Iron Age. Denbow suggests that this could be due to population patterns shifting from ‚Äúdispersed, small settlements during the Early Iron Age to a more centralized pattern in which small villages coalesced into larger towns.‚Äù = Loubanzi = Loubanzi is a large Phase 1 Later Iron Age site that has dated to approximately 535 - 317 years BP, the date was supported by the fact that no European trade goods were found at the site. One possible scenario, suggested by Denbow, is that Loubanzi ‚Äúwas an early ward or precinct on the outskirts of the larger settlement of Bouali (Bwali), the capital of the Loango kingdom described in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.‚Äù Ceramics shaped like chamber pots, as well quartzite and chert, oyster shells and fragments of iron were recovered from the site. An artist's depiction of Bwali. This image may be inaccurate as the artist never visited the city.  Phase 2 Later Iron Age: Historic Period  Very few actual excavations have been done on Phase 2 Later Iron Age Sites, mostly only surface reconnaissance. Indigenous ceramics with woven motifs were found in association with European porcelain and earthenware. Historical records from Peter Van den Broecke, a Dutch cloth trader, and Andrew Battell, ‚Äúa long-term resident of Loango,‚Äù both describe the capital city of Bwali. Van den Broecke described Bwali as ‚Äúlying close to the show and surrounded by a wall.‚Äù Battell describes Bwali as having a ‚Äúroyal compound separated from the rest of the town, a royal court where war and other matters of national import were deliberated, and a great market.‚Äù References Category:African archaeology Category:History of Central Africa ","title":"Archaeology of Central Africa"},{"id":"52172380","text":"The Dan Patch Trainer of the Year Award is an annual award created in 1985 by members of the United States Harness Writers Association (USHWA).

It ended in Portuguese victory and the withdrawal of the Aceh fleet after suffering heavy losses. Background In the beginning of May 1569, a privately owned carrack, escorted by a heavily armed galleon, departed from Goa, bound for south-east Asia. The captain and owner of the carrack was a wealthy man called Mem Lopes Carrasco, while the captain of the galleon was Jo√£o Gago de Andrade, tasked with resupplying and reinforcing the Portuguese garrison in the fortress of Ternate in the Moluccas. Carrasco intended to sail his ship to the Sunda Strait, possibly to buy high-quality pepper and sandalwood, among other highly valuable products made in the region. After passing by the Cape Comorin in the southernmost tip of India and the threat of pirates lessened, the carrack left the galleon's protection and sailed at full speed away from its sight. Upon passing by northwestern Sumatra where the Sultanate of Aceh was located, the wind suddenly dropped, leaving the carrack moving at a very slow pace. Aceh was a staunch enemy of the Portuguese, and frequently harassed the shipping of Malacca and was at that time outfitting an armada with which to attack the city. It was composed of 20 galleys, 20 war junks, and over 200 craft of smaller dimension.Armando de Saturnino Monteiro (1992), Portuguese Sea Battles - Volume III - From Brazil to Japan 1539-1579 pp 315-317 Battle Upon sighting the lone carrack, the fleet immediately sailed forth out of the harbour of Aceh in the carrack's pursuit. According to the 16th century Portuguese historian Diogo do Couto: The battle lasted all day, until the armada retreated by nightfall and dropped anchor in sight of the carrack. The Portuguese took the opportunity to take care of their wounded and make repairs on the ship all throughout the night. By the following morning, the battle resumed, as the armada sailed to board the carrack: Aftermath The armada of Aceh retreated with forty fewer ships \\"and the remaining so severely damaged\\" that the Acehnese called off the attack on Malacca at that time. Jo√£o Gago provided Mem Lopes Carrasco with the materials to build improvised masts so they could proceed to Malacca. He then left the carrack behind, possibly outraged that Carrasco had left him after passing the Cape Comorin. Upon arriving in Malacca however, the Captain of the fortress ordered Gago to immediately sail back and escort them the rest of the away, whereupon the surviving passengers were given a triumphant reception in the city. The carrack was so damaged that Mem Lopes Carrasco gave up on his plans to proceed to the Sunda strait and returned to India as quickly as possible.

A grandson of the Yadava king Mullagi, he carved out a principality in present-day Maharashtra by capturing forts in and around the Konkan region. Around 1175 CE, he grabbed the Yadava throne, supplanting the descendants of his uncle and an usurper. Over the next decade, he ruled as a nominal vassal of the Chalukyas of Kalyani, raiding the Gujarat Chaulukya and Paramara territories. After the fall of the Chalukya power, he declared sovereignty around 1187 CE, and fought with the Hoysala king Ballala II for control of the former Chalukya territory in present-day Karnataka. Around 1189 CE, he defeated Ballala in a battle at Soratur, but two years later, Ballala defeated him decisively.  Rise to power  According to Bhillama's Gadag inscription, he was a son of Karna, and a grandson of the Yadava ruler Mallugi. The 13th century Yadava court poet Hemadri gives a different genealogy for him, but Hemadri's account may be dismissed as unreliable, since he flourished a century after Bhillama. The Yadavas were originally vassals of the Chalukyas of Kalyani. By Mallugi's time, the Chalukya power had weakened, and Mallugi was fighting with the other Chalukya feudatories, such as the Kakatiyas. After Mallugi, his elder son Amara-gangeya and Amara-gangeya's son Amara-mallugi ruled in quick succession. Their rule was followed by Kaliya-Ballala, who was probably an usurper, and whose relation to Mallugi is unknown. Bhillama's father Karna, the younger son of Mallugi, was probably a subordinate officer or a sub-feudatory. During the chaotic period following Mallugi's death, Bhillama created a principality for himself by capturing several forts in the Konkan and surrounding regions. First, he defeated the rulers of Srivardhana and Pratyanta-gada (modern Torna). Next, he defeated and killed the ruler of Mangalaveshtaka (modern Mangalwedha). Around 1175 CE, Bhillama grabbed power at the Yadava capital Sinnar, and ascended the throne.  Northern raids  At the time of Bhillama's ascension, several conflicts were happening in southern Deccan. His nominal overlords ‚Äî the Chalukyas ‚Äî were busy fighting their former feudatories, such as the Hoysalas and the Kalachuris. Bhillama focused his attention towards the northern regions of Lata (southern Gujarat) and Malwa. Mularaja II, the Chaulukya king of Gujarat, was a minor. Vindhyavarman, the Paramara king of Malwa, had recently managed to restore the Paramara power by ousting the Chaulukyas from Malwa. The 1189 CE Mutugi inscription of Bhillama boasts that he caused severe troubles to the Malavas (the Paramaras) and the Gurjaras (the Chaulukyas). This appears to be a reference to his raids in Lata and Malwa regions. His general Jahla is said to have won a battle against the Chaulukyas by introducing a mad elephant in midst of the enemy army. Bhillama's raids in Gujarat and Malwa did not result in any territorial annexations, and he was forced to retreat by the Naddula Chahamana ruler Kelhana. The Mutugi inscription also claims that Bhillama defeated the kings of Anga, Vanga, Nepala and Panchala. However, this claim is not supported by historical evidence, and therefore, appears to be an empty poetic boast.  Conflict with Ballala  Shortly after Bhillama's northern raids, his Chalukya overlord Someshvara IV faced a southern invasion from the Hoysala ruler Ballala. Ballala's attack forced Someshvara to take shelter at Banavasi, with his Kadamba feudatory Kamadeva. When Ballala's army was exhausted in this campaign, Bhillama forced Ballala to retreat, and conquered the former Chalukya capital Kalyani. This conquest probably happened around 1187 CE, when Bhillama first made his claim to an imperial status. According to the later Yadava minister Hemadri, the Hoysala ruler was killed in this battle. It is known that Ballala was not killed in this conflict, so the person mentioned by Hemadri was probably a Hoysala prince responsible for defending Kalyani. According to Hemadri, after this victorious campaign, Bhillama established the Devagiri city, which became the new Yadava capital. After returning to his capital Dvarasamudra, Ballala reorganized his forces, and launched a fresh march to the north. By June 1189, he had conquered Banavasi and Nolambavadi, as attested by inscriptions. In response, Bhillama marched against him with 200,000-strong infantry and 12,000-strong cavalry. The two armies met at Soratur. In this battle, the Hoysalas decisively defeated Bhillama's forces. Their 1192 Anekere inscription states that Ballala manured the region from Soratur to Belvola with dead bodies of the Seuna soldiers. The Yadava general Jaitrapala (alias Jaitrasimha) fled to Lokkigundi (modern Lakkundi), but Ballala captured the fort and killed him. Ballala went on to capture the important forts of Erambara (modern Yellur), Kurrugod, Gutti (modern Gooty), and Hangal. The Yadavas were driven to the north of the Malaprabha and Krishna rivers, which formed the Yadava-Hoysala border for the next two decades.  Death  During the last years of Bhillama's life, his kingdom extended from the Narmada river in the north to the Malaprabha river in the south, and included nearly all of the present-day Maharashtra (except the Shilahara-ruled Konkan) and northern parts of Karnataka. Shortly after Bhillama's defeat against Ballala in 1191 CE, his son Jaitugi succeeded him on the Yadava throne. An 1198 CE Hoysala inscription states that Ballala \\"moistened his sword with the blood of the Pandya king, whetted it on the grindstone of Bhillama's head, and sheathed it in the lotus mouth of Jaitugi\\". The two persons other than Bhillama are known to have been killed by Ballala: Kamadeva, a Pandya ruler of Ucchangi was killed in a battle against the Hoysalas. Jaitugi here refers to Bhillama's general Jaitrapala, who also died fighting the Hoysalas. This has led to speculation that Bhillama also died in a battle against Ballala. However, the earlier 1192 CE Gadag inscriptions of Ballala do not state that Ballala killed Bhillama, although they boast that he killed Bhillama's right hand Jaitrasimha. It is unlikely that Ballala would have failed to boast about his killing of Bhillama, had the Yadava ruler died in a battle. Bhillama most probably died a natural death after suffering a defeat against Ballala. The claim of Ballala \\"whetting his sword on the grindstone of Bhima's head\\" appears to a poetic description by the later Hoysala poets.  Cultural activities  Bhillama patronized the scholar Bhaskara, who was the teacher of Nagarjuna (the author of Yogaratnamala). An 1189-90 CE (1111 Shaka) inscription records a donation by Bhillama and others to the Vitthal Temple, Pandharpur. In this inscription, Bhillama is styled as \\"Chakravartin Yadava\\". An 1191 CE inscription records Bhillama's donations to the Trikuteshvara Shiva temple at Gadag. An 1192 CE inscription records a grant by Ballala to the same temple, which confirms that Bhillama was defeated by Ballala.

Principally located along Main and College Streets between South Winooski and South Williams Streets (between downtown and the UVM campus), the area was one of the city's most exclusive residential areas from the early 19th century to the early 20th century, and includes a diversity of high quality architecture from that period. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The city of Burlington was first permanently settled in 1783, after earlier settlers had been driven from the area by raiding in the American Revolutionary War. Vermont was admitted to the United States as its 14th state in 1791 (after several decades in legal limbo), and it was in that same year that Burlington was chosen as the site of the state college, now the University of Vermont. The town's early economic activity was focused on the waterfront of Lake Champlain, with the downtown area taking shape around the courthouse square on Main Street near Church. Between the courthouse and the college campus developed into a residential area, partly due to the presence of a ravine (since filled in) that was spanned by a poor bridge. Lumber boomed as a business beginning in the 1820s, resulting in the construction of a number of fine Federal and Greek Revival Houses along Main Street, and College Street began to be developed in the 1830s. The area saw further significant development between 1880 and 1910, when a number of high style Victorian and Colonial Revival residences were built. This area also saw some commercial and civic development take place, particular the construction of what is now the Edmunds Middle School. with The historic district encompasses three blocks of Main and College Streets, from the eastern edge of South Winooski Street to the western edge of South Williams Street. It also extends along the west side of South Williams about two-thirds of the way between College and Pearl Streets. This area, about , includes 64 historically significant buildings. Most of these were originally single-family residences, and are finished mainly in wooden clapboards or brick. There are some multiunit apartment houses, and some of the larger mansions have been converted into apartments. One notable example is the Colonial Revival mansion of Joel Gates (381 Main Street), built in 1895 to a design by the architectural firm of Peabody & Stearns. There are two churches, both built in the 1860s, and the district is also home to the Fletcher Free Library.

When it was built in 1874, it overlooked downtown Wabasha. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 for having local significance in the theme of architecture. It was nominated for being one of the largest and most prominent houses of its era in Wabasha. Description Although the Campbell House has a brick veneer, it is a wood frame building on a limestone foundation. It has a somewhat irregular footprint, with three gabled sections that rise two stories and a fourth section that rises one story and has a flat roof. The house's massing, rooflines, window placement, and wide frieze boards suggest Greek Revival architecture, but the segmental-arched windows, bowed shutters, fanlight over the front doors, and centered attic window are more characteristic of Federal architecture. In the house's original configuration, the wings to the northwest and southwest stood just one story, and the latter, a kitchen, was all wood. A major remodeling around the year 1900 raised both wings to two stories. They also received brick cladding, rooflines, and window treatments that were closely matched with the central section. During this remodeling the interior was retrimmed with oak and a grand staircase added. A detached garage at the rear of the property is a more recent addition and is not considered a contributing element to the historic house. History William H. Campbell settled in Wabasha in 1857, though he left temporarily to serve in the American Civil War. Upon his return he gained prosperity as a merchant and agriculturalist, one of the few Wabasha-based merchants to also have extensive farming interests. He served as Wabasha County auditor for many years beginning in 1872, and was also master of the Bear Valley Grange Hall. With assistance from his father-in-law, Campbell had this house constructed in 1874, where it proudly overlooked a downtown that both men had helped establish economically. The Campbell House is an example of some 20 brick residences surviving from the 19th century in Wabasha. All were built by the first two generations of the city's merchant class, forming a distinctive architectural stock that contrasts with the elaborate wood-frame Victorian architecture that characterized most other communities in Minnesota. As time went on the choice of building material appears to have been a matter of local taste rather than accessibility, as Wabasha was not a major brick manufacturer compared to Lake City and Red Wing upriver.

Education and career Beauregard received his undergraduate and doctoral degrees from the University of Montreal in Canada. He later did postdoctoral research at the University of Texas and McGill University's Montreal Neurological Institute. Work While working at the University of Montreal, Beauregard and his graduate student, Vincent Paquette, conducted a study using fMRI to examine the brains of nuns reliving mystical experiences. They found that there was no single spot involved in mediating these experiences, but that instead, multiple brain regions and systems were involved. He has also studied the brain activity of people who are reliving near-death experiences they have previously had. He has said that this research seems to indicate that these experiences have \\"triggered something at a neural level in the brain.\\" He has also written multiple books, including The Spiritual Brain: A Neuroscientist‚Äôs Case for the Existence of the Soul, which he co-authored with Denyse O'Leary and was published in 2007. He also published another book, Brain Wars: The Scientific Battle Over the Existence of the Mind and the Proof That Will Change the Way We Live Our Lives, in 2012.

It was first performed by the percussionist Evelyn Glennie and the Madison Symphony Orchestra under the conductor John DeMain in Madison, Wisconsin, on March 27, 2004. Composition=Background The concerto was completed in 2003. Typical of Rorem's late-period orchestral works, the piece calls for no unpitched percussion instruments, which was stipulated by the composer before he agreed to write the concerto for Evelyn Glennie. Rorem elaborated on this point in the score program notes, remarking, \\"After years of garnishing my orchestral works with every type of gong and drum, I've concluded that non-pitched percussion is superfluous, even in Beethoven. I am morally against all cymbal crashes, and feel that snares and bongos are strictly ornamental.\\" He added, \\"The four elements of music are melody, harmony, counterpoint, and rhythm. Rhythm is the most dispensable.\\" The concerto has a duration of roughly 24 minutes and is cast in seven movements. Instrumentation The work is scored for a solo percussionist and a chamber orchestra comprising flute, oboe, clarinets, horn, trumpet, trombone, and strings. The soloist's percussion battery consists of vibraphone, marimba, glockenspiel, and xylophone. Reception The piece has been praised by music critics. Jeremy Eichler of The New York Times wrote, \\"Each [instrument] has strikingly different sonorities and Mr. Rorem created seven brief and handsome movements, including a deftly skittering scherzo and a vaguely menacing waltz. The work showcased a wide array of timbral and thematic relationships between the soloist and the orchestra, pared down with lean string writing and tart woodwinds.\\" The concerto was also praised by Brett Campbell of The Wall Street Journal, who called it \\"by turns wistful and playful.\\" References Category:Concertos by Ned Rorem Category:2003 compositions Category:Percussion concertos Category:Compositions for chamber orchestra ","title":"Mallet Concerto"},{"id":"52173537","text":"Ernst Weber Drohl (1879-?) was a professional wrestler, strongman performer, and German Abwehr agent during World War 2.

He was released from the District court only to be rearrested under the Emergency Powers Act and confined to prison where he went on hunger strike and was released 8 days later. Arrested finally in 1942 he spent the rest of the war in Mountjoy prison and Athlone internment camp where he was interned with other German spies including Hermann Goertz.

It has rough, dark grey or black \\"ironbark\\" on the trunk and larger branches, smooth white bark on the thinner branches, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and conical, cup-shaped or barrel-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus deccorticans is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has hard, dark grey to black ironbark on the trunk and larger branches, smooth white to greyish or yellow bark on the thinner branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves that are narrow lance- shaped, a lighter colour on the lower surface, long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, the same dull colour on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. The buds are club- shaped to spindle-shaped or diamond-shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum. Flowering has been observed in April, August and September and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody conical, cup-shaped or barrel-shaped capsule long and wide on a pedicel long. Taxonomy and naming Gum-top ironbark was first formally described in 1911 by Frederick Manson Bailey from a specimen collected near Eidsvold by Thomas Lane Bancroft. Bailey gave it the name Eucalyptus siderophloia f. decorticans and published the description in the Queensland Agricultural Journal. In 1921, Joseph Maiden raised the form to species level as Eucalyptus decorticans, publishing the change in his book A Critical Revision of the Genus Eucalyptus. The specific epithet (decorticans) is derived from the Latin word decorticans meaning \\"without bark\\" referring to the peeling bark on the smaller branches. Distribution and habitat Eucalyptus decorticans grows in open forest on hills and hillsides in stony clay soils. It is widespread in southeastern Queensland. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as \\"least concern\\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992.

He played college football for the UCLA Bruins and was drafted by the Falcons in the first round of the 2017 NFL Draft. Early years McKinley attended Kennedy High School in Richmond, California. He played for the Eagles football team. He had 50 tackles and 15 sacks as a junior and 60 tackles and 11 sacks as a senior. He also ran track in high school. College career McKinley originally committed to the University of California, Berkeley but was ruled a non-qualifier and attended Contra Costa College. During his one season at Contra Costa College in 2013, he had 33 tackles and 10 sacks. In September 2014, he transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He played in 10 games that season, making one start, and finished the year with 2.5 sacks. As a junior in 2015, McKinley started 12 of 13 games, recording 35 tackles and 3.5 sacks. As a senior in 2016, he recorded 10 sacks. Professional career McKinley was invited to the NFL Combine as an outside linebacker and completed all the combine drills except for the short shuttle and three-cone drill. He went under surgery to repair a torn labrum and a fracture in his shoulder socket after the combine. His recovery time was expected to take four to six months, making him unable to participate at UCLA's Pro Day. NFL draft experts and analystas projected McKinley to be selected in the first or second round. He was ranked the second best outside linebacker in the draft by NFL analyst Bucky Brooks, the third best outside linebacker by NFLDraftScout.com, the fourth best edge rusher by NFL analyst Mike Mayock, the fifth best edge rusher by Sports Illustrated, and was ranked the fifth best defensive end by ESPN. McKinley was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in the first round (26th overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft. On May 11, the Falcons signed McKinley to a four-year, $10.21 million contract with $7.89 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $5.57 million. He played in all 16 games, recording 20 tackles and six sacks, good for fourth in the league among rookies and second on the team behind Adrian Clayborn. In Week 4 of the 2018 season, against the Cincinnati Bengals, McKinley recorded a career-high three sacks in the 37‚Äì36 loss. He finished the season with 22 combined tackles and a team-high seven sacks. In 2019, McKinley played in 14 games with 13 starts, recording 29 tackles and 3.5 sacks.

The independence struggled against the Portuguese lasted a little over a year, with many battles centered on the Island of Itaparica. Maria Felipa is noted as one of three women who participated in the struggle for Bahia's independence in 1823, the others being the military figure Maria Quit√©ria (1792-1853) and Sister Joana Ang√©lica (1761-1822). Independence struggle The life of Maria Felipa is poorly documented. She was born on Itaparica Island, date unknown, and was a seafood vendor and laborer. She was a freewoman and likely the daughter of an enslaved family of Sudanese descent; by oral tradition, she was a practitioner of capoeira. She led a group of 200 people, primarily women of Afro-Brazilian and of indigenous populations of Tupinamb√°s and Tapuias, in the Battle of Itaparica, January 7‚Äì9, 1823. The provisional government of Bahia recommended that residents of the island evacuate, but Maria Felipa and the resistance group remained, likely because of long-standing conflict, known as the mata- marotos, between the Portuguese and ethnic minorities in Bahia. The resistance group fortified the island by constructed trenches along its broad beaches, sending supplies to the inland Rec√¥ncavo region, and watching the coast by both day and night to prevent the landing of Portuguese troops. Ubaldo Os√≥rio Pimentel records that the Maria Felipa's resistance group set fire to some of the 42 Portuguese vessels anchored in the vicinity of the island to invade the city of Salvador. The group is known to have set fire to the Canhoneira Dez de Fevereiro on October 1, 1922 on the Beach of Manguinhos and the Constitui√ß√£o on October 12, 1922 at Praia do Convento. Maria Felipa and other of the independence fought against Portuguese on land in the same period. They used the peixeira, a knife used in the fishmongering trade; and branches of cansan√ß√£o, any of a number of indigenous species of plants highly poisonous to the skin. Two watchmen of the vessels, Ara√∫jo Mendes and Guimar√£es das Uvas, were seduced by members of Maria Felipa's group; once nude and drunk, the Portuguese were beaten to death. The \\"seduction tactic\\" was similarly carried out in Saubara in the nearby inland city of Santo Amaro. Women in both areas also appeared as souls of the dead using masks and sheets, a tactic which caused the Portuguese to flee and for women fighters to provide relief supplies to Brazilian troops hiding in remote inland areas. Aftermath The activities of the group extended to the day when the flag of Brazil was first raised over the Forte de S√£o Louren√ßo. Maria Felipa, Joana Soaleira, Br√≠gida do Vale, and a woman known as Marcolina occupied the warehouse of the wealthy Portuguese fish merchant Ara√∫jo Mendes.  Resting place  The remains of Maria Felipa are likely located in the Church of Saint Lawrence (). Her place of death and burial are poorly documented, but is known to be at the Povoa√ß√£o de Ponta das Baleias, now the historic center of Itaparica.( Historical documentation Historian Ubaldo Os√≥rio Pimentel, maternal grandfather of the writer Jo√£o Ubaldo Ribeiro, verified through public documents on records that a group of people, mostly women, led by Maria Felipa defended the coast of Itaparica Island against Portuguese repression. In his book A Ilha de Itaparica, published in 1942, historian Ubaldo Os√≥rio Pimentel cites the historical figure of Maria Felipa, which is also mentioned in the historical novel O Sargento Pedro [Sergeant Peter], by Xavier Marques.

He was born in Damascus but lived mainly in Egypt during the 11th century Fatimid Caliphate. He also wrote an historical chronicle of the reign of al-Mustansir Billah. However, the book he is famed for and the only one extant, KitƒÅb mukhtƒÅr al-·∏•ikam wa-ma·∏•ƒÅsin al-kalim (), the \\"Selected Maxims and Aphorisms\\", is a collection of sayings attributed to the ancient sages (mainly Greeks) translated into Arabic. The date of composition given by the author is 1048‚Äì1049. Biography The biographical details we have come from Ibn Abi Usaibia's Uy≈´n ul-AnbƒÅ æ fƒ´ ·π¨abaqƒÅt ul- A·π≠ibbƒÅ æ (, \\"the History of Physicians\\"). According to Usaibia, Ibn Fatik was from a noble family and held the position of \\"emir\\" at the court of the Fatimids in the reign of al-Mustansir Billah. He was a passionate bibliophile, acquired a great collection of books and enjoyed the company of scholars, and above all, he devoted himself to study. He trained in mathematics and astronomy under the philosopher, mathematician and astronomer Ibn al-Haytham (965-1040). He also associated with Ibn al-Amidi and the physician, astrologer, and astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan (988‚Äì1061). When he died, many heads of state attended his funeral. According to this biography, such was his wife's disaffection through want of attention, she threw most of his books into the pool at the center of the house, and so they were lost by drowning. Works KitƒÅb mukhtƒÅr al-·∏•ikam wa-ma·∏•ƒÅsin al-kalim (), the ‚ÄúBook of Selected Maxims and Aphorisms‚Äù, can be described as a collection of biographies of twenty-one \\"sages\\", mainly Greeks (e.g. Seth, (Zedekiah),The Spanish translation has \\"Sedechias\\" in place of Seth here. (See Bocados de Oro) Hermes, Homer, Solon, Pythagoras, Hippocrates, Diogenes, Plato, Aristotle, Galen, Alexander the Great), accompanied by the maxims and sayings attributed to them. The biographies are largely legendary and most attributions highly dubious. Influences His al-Mukhtar was a great success in the centuries that followed, first in the Arab-Muslim world where it provided source material for later scholars, such as for Muhammad al-Shahrastani in his book Kitab al-wa-l-Milal Nihal and Shams al-Din al-Shahrazuri for his Nuzhat al- Arwah.

Primary areas along this coast include the Zanzibar (including the Mafia islands), Lamu, and Kilwa Archipelagos. Although East African societies developed nautical capabilities for themselves, most of the maritime artifacts point to external merchants from Mediterranean cultures like Egypt and Greece, Indian and Chinese from South and East Asia in the early stages, to the great European powers during the Ages of Colonization and Imperialism.  Sea movement  While the use of ocean marine resources dates back to as early as 60 kya in South African sites such as Blombos Cave, and later along the east coast, the record for the use of nautical technologies is less known. Based on dating of LSA sites in Zanzibar Cave on the island of Zanzibar, the use of nautical technology would date at least to the 7th or 8th century AD for the Tanzanian coastal cultures that moved from the mainland to inhabit the island. That date can be pushed back even further by sites discovered in the Mafia Archipelago, sites which suggest colonization during the Early Iron Age, which has been dated to between the 1st and 6th century AD. The exact time of settlement is up for debate though, as studies performed in Kuumbi Cave show. Kuumbi Cave is located near the southeast coast of Zanzibar, based on artifacts dated from the site there is an argument presented that the residents of Zanzibar crossed over a land bridge that existed in the late Pliocene, before the sea level rose around 8000 BC. Archaeologists believe that as coastal areas were easier to reach than inland areas along Eastern Africa, most interactions between cultural groups were longitudinal in nature. This trade started long before the implementation of boats, but was made easier after the fact.Fishing dhow  African vessels  Trade or transport dhow When outside cultures like Rome, India and China encountered the East African coast, they did not come to people foreign to the concept of boat usage, though the scale was much different. While both came in large trading vessels the local Africans relied more on vessels that kept close to the coast which were used more for local trading and fishing than long expeditions. East Africans to this day use a ship style called a dhow which was introduced by the Arabic merchants who came into the region. The dhow is not one particular ship design, but more of a class of ships, with sizes and schematics ranging from the smaller fishing dhow to the much larger shows used for transporting goods and passengers.  Outside contact  East Africa has had a long history of connections to the global marketplace, having been a direct part of the Silk Road and Maritime Indian Cotton and Spice Route as early as the 1st century AD. It has become home to people of many ethnicities, including Arabic merchants and settlers, Indian and Chinese sailors, European merchants and remnants of the European colonial families, and the culture groups that are descended from those who were there to begin with.  Contact with Rome  Roman trade vessels would make the 3,000 nautical mile journey south from the important trade ports of Myos Hormos and Berenice in Egypt to the African trade port of Zanzibar. There exists to this day, what has been classified as a sea journal of a Roman pilot or merchant from the 1st century AD, this journal is called the Periplus Maris Erythraei, and it records the voyage of a Roman trade ship that sailed from the Red Sea south along the African coast to India.  Contact with China and East Asia  In the 1400s AD the East African coast encountered the trading fleets of China, led by Zheng He, the Chinese trader and servant of the Emperor. From geophysical surveying of the coast around Lamu Kenya, archaeologists have discovered what appear to be Chinese porcelain artifacts dating to the 14th century AD, local legend and heritage has it that one or more Chinese vessels were lost in the area.  Contact with Arabia  Today, the East African coast has become almost synonymous with the term \\"Swahili coast\\", the Swahili coast being denoted by peoples of the Swahili culture which is a combination of Arabic language and culture and the language and culture of the native peoples of Africa. Much of the land range is the same, but the Swahili culture extends into the northern coast of Madagascar and into northern Somalia, Djibouti and Eritrea.  Contact with Europe  While European powers were familiar with the goods of Africa's east coast, it was not until their ships were able to get around the southern cape of Africa that their connections to the coast became direct. With the rush for land, resources and power beginning in the late 15th century AD by Europe, encountering the rich coast of East Africa was a goldmine, both figuratively and literally as cities like Mogadishu in Somalia and Sofala in Mozambique being hubs for gold obtained from the interior of the continent. In Ngomeni Kenya, archaeologists discovered 16th century AD shipwreck which, along with certain artifacts found with the ship suggest European origins and Portuguese ownership. The artifacts in question are copper ingots marked with a seal of ownership, the seal being of a trident.  Important ports  * Kilwa Kisiwani - Tanzania * Stone Town (Mje Mkongwe) - Zanzibar, Tanzania * Rhapta - Unknown * Fort Jesus - Mombasa Island, Kenya * Lamu - Lamu Island, Kenya * Shanga - Pate Island, Kenya * Mogadishu - Somalia * Sofala - Mozambique  Underwater sites  While some underwater sites have been identified and are under analysis, little is known about the overall quantity and diversity of the wrecks to be found along the coast. In some cities along the coast, like Kilwa in Tanzania, and Lamu in Kenya, archaeologists have found images of Arabic ships carved into the walls of mosques, which are interpreted as being requests of protection for the ships carved. The most common finds are anchor weights, left at mooring points by ships or the port for the anchorage of vessels. As mentioned above, Chinese goods were identified by geophysical surveys in the Pate Bay, near Lamu. The best cataloged sunken ships by Edward Pollard of the British Institute in Eastern Africa are the three that sunk in the Rufiji Delta during World War 1, the German cruiser SMS K√∂nigsberg and accompanying coal transport Somali, and the British ship the Newbridge, a turret ship which was scuttled to block the SMS K√∂nigsberg from leaving the Delta. Near Fort Jesus on Mombasa Island there lays the wreck of the Santo Ant√≥nio de Tann√°, a Portuguese frigate, sunk in 1697 while fighting the Omani fleet who was attempting capture of the fort.

Set in Los Angeles in 2011, it follows a young man (Andrew Garfield) who sets out on a quest to investigate the sudden disappearance of his neighbour (Riley Keough), only to stumble upon an elusive and dangerous large-scale conspiracy. The film had its world premiere on May 15, 2018, at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d'Or, before being released nationwide in France on August 8. It was released in the United States on April 19, 2019, by A24. Under the Silver Lake polarized critics; although its originality, direction, soundtrack, cinematography, and Garfield's performance were praised, some found the script confusing, too cryptic, and lacking the substance and depth the film was aiming for. Plot Sam is an aimless 33-year-old in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, interested in conspiracy theories and hidden messages in popular culture and uninterested in paying his overdue rent. The public is warned to \\"Beware the Dog Killer\\" who is murdering pets. Sam meets his new neighbor, Sarah, who despite having caught him spying on her, invites him over. The two get high and watch How to Marry a Millionaire, but when her roommates interrupt as they begin to kiss, Sarah suggests Sam leave and they hang out the next day. In the morning, Sam discovers Sarah and her roommates have moved out overnight, and becomes obsessed with learning what happened. Noticing a strange symbol painted on the apartment's wall, Sam trails a woman from the apartment to a series of elite Hollywood parties, encountering the pop band \\"Jesus and the Brides of Dracula\\" and a performance artist working for a prostitution ring of struggling actresses. All seem connected, but Sam struggles to find any meaningful pattern. At his apartment, Sam sees a news report detailing the discovery of billionaire Jefferson Sevence, burned to death in a car with three women. Sam recognizes Sarah's hat at the scene, and a small dog similar to Sarah's found dead. Sam contacts the author of Under the Silver Lake, an underground comic about neighborhood urban legends. He tells Sam that Sarah's disappearance, the Dog Killer, the Owl's Kiss - a naked woman in an owl mask who seduces and kills people in their sleep - and messages in pop culture are part of the same conspiracy and has installed security cameras throughout his house. Later, the police find the author dead in an apparent suicide. Sam enters the house and reviews the security footage, discovering the author was killed by a woman dressed as the Owl's Kiss. Following clues hidden in Jesus and the Brides of Dracula songs, Sam meets the \\"Homeless King\\", who brings him to a bunker underneath Griffith Park leading into a supermarket. With the help of the performance artist and her friends, Sam meets \\"the Songwriter\\", a fabulously wealthy old man who claims to have written most of history's popular songs. When the Songwriter tries to shoot him, Sam bludgeons him to death with a guitar that purportedly belonged to Sam's musical idol, Kurt Cobain. At a party in the Hollywood Hills, Sam meets Jefferson Sevence's daughter Millicent, also running into his now-famous ex- girlfriend and her new boyfriend. Millicent convinces Sam to go swimming in the Silver Lake Reservoir. She gives him a bracelet ‚Äì identical to Sarah's ‚Äì that belonged to her father, and is shot dead by unseen assailants and sinks to the bottom of the lake, mirroring a pose from Sam's favorite issue of Playboy. Sam manages to escape, and combines the bracelet, the author's cereal box prize, and a Legend of Zelda map from the first issue of Nintendo Power to reveal a location absent from web mapping where he finds a man and three women in a small hut. As Sam holds them at gunpoint, the man reveals the truth: throughout history, wealthy men such as himself choose to lock themselves in underground bunkers similar to the one Sam discovered, much like Egyptian Pharaohs, in order for their souls to \\"ascend\\" accompanied by three wives. Sarah and her roommates were Sevence's wives, and their deaths were faked. Their bunker has been sealed, but they can still be contacted via videotelephony. Sam speaks with Sarah, who confirms that she entered the bunker willingly. At peace with her fate, she and Sam share an emotional farewell. Sam begins to pass out as the Homeless King arrives to capture him, angered by finding dog biscuits in his pocket. When Sam tells him that he did not actually have a dog and kept biscuits only as memory of his painful breakup and knowledge that he would never see his girlfriend's dog again, the Homeless King lets him go. Returning home, Sam spends the night with a neighbor whose parrot repeats incomprehensible words. From the balcony, Sam watches as his landlord and a police officer enter his apartment to evict him. They notice one of his walls has been painted with the strange symbol seen earlier, which Sam now knows to be a message from the conspiracy to \\"stay quiet\\". CastProduction In May 2016, David Robert Mitchell was announced to be writing and directing the film with Andrew Garfield and Dakota Johnson starring. Michael De Luca, Adele Romanski, Jake Weiner, and Chris Bender were also announced as producers. In October 2016, Riley Keough replaced Johnson and Topher Grace also joined the cast of the film.

Composer Disasterpeace, who provided the original score for Mitchell's previous film It Follows, returned to write the music. Filming Principal photography began on October 31, 2016. Release In May 2016, A24 acquired U.S distribution rights to the film. The film had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on May 15, 2018. The first country it was released in nationwide was France on August 8, followed by Belgium on August 15. The film was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on June 22, 2018, but on June 4 was pushed back to December 7, 2018. It was then pushed back again to April 19, 2019. Reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 59% based on 150 reviews, with an average rating of 5.83/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Under the Silver Lake hits its stride slightly more often than it stumbles, but it's hard not to admire‚Äîor be drawn in by‚Äîwriter-director David Robert Mitchell's ambition.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 31 critics, and an average user score of 6.5/10, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out gave the film a perfect five rating, calling it \\"Hypnotic, spiraling and deliriously high\\" and stating \\"the ambition of Under the Silver Lake is worth cherishing. It will either evaporate into nothingness or cohere into something you'll want to hug for being so wonderfully weird.\\" Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave a positive review, calling it \\"a bizarre and outrageous drama grounded in the consistency of Garfield's astonishment at every turn... It's fascinating to watch Mitchell grasp for a bigger picture with the wild ambition of his scruffy protagonist.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety gave a positive review, calling it \\"a down-the- rabbit-hole movie, at once gripping and baffling, fueled by erotic passion and dread but also by the code-fixated opacity of conspiracy theory. The movie is impeccably shot and staged, with an insanely lush soundtrack that's like Bernard Herrmann-meets-Angelo-Badalamenti-on-opioids.\\" A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film a B rating, stating \\"Mitchell is taking a big swing with his third feature, trying something not just new but also more unconventional, ambitious, and even potentially off-putting.\\" Emily Yoshida of Vulture stated about the film's message: \\"I kept coming back to the women in this extremely boy-driven movie‚ÄîMitchell suspects that they're all on one big conveyor belt to be chewed up and spit out by Hollywood, or if they're lucky, locked away in the dungeons of the rich and powerful. It's a rather pedestrian imagining for an otherwise admirably cuckoo film‚Äîyou keep hoping for Mitchell to land on something weirder, more radical.\\" Despite praising Garfield's performance and the film's originality, Bilge Ebiri of The Village Voice gave a negative review, stating: \\"If you're going to make a postmodern neo-noir sex- conspiracy... set in Los Angeles, it helps to have some personality, or at least a sense of style... Mitchell has interesting ideas, and his actors seem to be having fun, but that's not enough when the film itself lacks atmosphere, or tension, or emotional engagement.\\" In 2018 The film had positive reactions at the Neuch√¢tel International Fantastic Film Festival in Switzerland where it was awarded with the Denis-De-Rougemont Youth Award. At Sitges Film Festival Under the Silver Lake was awarded with the Special Mention of the Jose Luis Guarner Critics' Award.  Cult following  While not initially a box-office success with audiences, Under the Silver Lake has garnered a cult following with certain sub-sections of the internet. Passionate fans are convinced that there are hidden meta-clues, codes and ciphers sprinkled throughout the film waiting to be discovered. These include references to the mystery surrounding the identity of the dog killer, various different cyphers or codes, geocoding systems, and even analysis of fireworks in the film, connecting the sound pattern they emit to Morse code. In certain scenes in the film there is graffiti that can be seen in the toilets and on a wall and which are coded with the Copiale cipher. The film's cryptography consultant was computer scientist Kevin Knight who in 2011 co-created a program to translate the Copiale cipher.

History  The company was founded in 2008 by a graduate of Mechanics and Mathematics Faculty of Moscow State University, Dmitry Kibkalo and his friend Dmitry Borisov. After university Kibkalo had worked for the press department of the FC Spartak, in the PR-agency IMA-consulting; his last post as an employee was an executive director of producing centre Kolizey Production Center. Business emerged from the idea of a New Year gift: a printed and illustrated version of the board game The Jackal, invented by students and faculty of Moscow State University in the 1970s. Kibkalo hired an illustrator, but the producers refused to make only one piece, so he had ordered 100 copies of the game, having invested about 500 thousand rubles. Kibkalo could not arrange to sell the unused 80 copies at children's shops and bookstores. In November 2008, together with Borisov, he launched an online store. In addition to The Jackal partners presented 20 popular board games and in two months they got back the initial investment. After four months, they expanded the range of games to 100 names and opened a pick-up point near the Belorusskaya metro station. In March 2009 Kibkalo and Borisov invested several hundred thousand rubles of their own funds into the opening of the first store near the Taganskaya metro station. It was followed by franchise stores in St. Petersburg and Kiev. Soon Kibkalo quit the Kolizey and focused on development of Mosigra. In summer 2010, private entrepreneurs under the guarantee and security of the goods in the warehouse, received loans from Absolut Bank and Uniastrum and invested them in new stores. A separate company Magellan concentrated on development of their own games, localization of foreign games and production. The company began to present the news games to the market using this brand name. By the end of 2010, Mosigra had 16 stores, including 10 franchise shops, which originally did not suppose the payment of royalties and lump sum contributions: the condition was to work with a single supplier and organize game rooms. By 2012, the number of stores increased to 70. After that Mosigra revised the franchise terms and refused to expand in regions. According to consulting company Gradient Alpha, by the end of 2013, the company controlled from 12 to 15% of board games in the Russian market. In March 2016 the network included 27 own stores and 41 franchised stores in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, and a turnover of more than 600 million rubles.  Business model  In contrast to logical puzzles and strategic games (for example, Civilization and Catan), which formed the basic stock of special shops at the time when first Mosigra shop opened at Taganka, the company focused on casual games for big companies. Mosigra cooperates with major distributors of foreign manufacturers and Russian publishers of games and produces from 1 to 10 thousand copies of their own games. The company‚Äôs own products (80 games) are distributed through a network of shops, which account for about 50% of turnover. Also at different times they were sold in stores Art. Lebedev Studio, Soyuz, Euroset, Detsky Mir, Republic and Ozon.ru. Originally developed games The Jackal and Danetki are among the best-selling games and are released in about 50,000 copies a year; another 100 thousand copies accounts Opyata, Yorsh, Boom and Crocoparty games. Among the most popular are also Imadjinarium, Alias, Svintus, Monopoly, Mafia, Hive, 7 ate 9, Medved, Do not rock the boat!, Wizard of Emerald City and Chameleon. Also Mosigra licenses its games Nefarious and Mindmaze for the Western market. According to the company about a million boxes of games are sold each year, about half of them ‚Äì from December to February. Mosigra cooperates with the authors of games, invites developers for presentations and signs contracts with the winners of competitions. In most cases, the authors concede rights to the game to the company and get 10% off the wholesale price of the edition. The company also distributes popular party games of other manufacturers. For example, \\"Stupid Casual company\\" sells 70% of Imadjinarium through Mosigra. For corporate customers the company produces limited series of games ‚Äì the original design or popular games with branding. Mosigra released a special board game School of the future supplier for an event by Moscow Government dedicated to state purchases. Another board game became a part of advertising campaign of the series Law of stone jungle, released on TNT channel. A game Favorite game TV channel Friday!, launched together with the channel Friday!, won the award Mediabrand contest as the Best off-air promotional campaign. Game development for corporate clients, among which there are MegaFon and Toyota, have brought Mosigra 130 million rubles of revenue in 2015. Employees of shops work as actors, animators and play board games with each other and visitors. Purchases are tracked through the discount system, which is used for individual stimulating activities. The company's main audience ‚Äì people between 25 and 35 years old.  Game rooms  The only advertising tool of the company ‚Äì temporary game rooms at major events and permanent game rooms located in cafes, restaurants and other spaces in the cities. The company organized entertainment points at the music festivals Nashestvie and Usadba Jazz, Afisha Picnic. In 2012, Mosigra conducted a special game room for disabled people during the day Together Against Hemorrhage.  Owners and management  Kibkalo and Borisov control 43.9% of the company each. Among the owners are the CEO of the company Andrew Sitarskii (1%), Boris Solodukhin (1.2%) and Igor Poleshchuk (10%).

Robinson, see The Power (Robinson novel). For the self-help book, see The Power (self-help book). The Power is a 2016 science fiction novel by the British writer Naomi Alderman. Its central premise is women developing the ability to release electrical jolts from their fingers, thus leading them to become the dominant gender. In June 2017, The Power won the Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction.Kean, Danuta, \\"Baileys prize goes to 'classic of the future' by Naomi Alderman\\", The Guardian, 7 June 2017.Masters, Tim, \\"Baileys Prize: Naomi Alderman wins for 'shocking' sci-fi novel The Power\\", BBC News, 7 June 2017. The book was also named by The New York Times as one of the 10 Best Books of 2017. In December 2017, former U.S. President Barack Obama named The Power as one of his favorite books of 2017. Overview The Power is a book within a book: a manuscript of an imagined history of the tumultuous era during which women across the world developed and shared the power to emit electricity from their hands. The manuscript is submitted by Neil Adam Armon to another author named Naomi, approximately five thousand years after the power emerges and revolution reassembles the world into a matriarchy. This historical fiction chronicles the experiences of Allie, Roxy, Margot, Jocelyn, and Tunde, as they navigate their rapidly changing world.  Plot  In a matriarchal society, a gushing male writer writes to an influential author about his fictional account of how the matriarchy came to be. 5,000 years earlier (in our current time), men dominated society. Then, stories emerge of women who can protect themselves with an electrical power. And more than protection, they can attack, torture, even kill. Roxy is an English teenager whose mother is attacked. She manages to defend herself, injuring one attacker but the other beats her up and kills her mother. Tunde is an aspiring journalist in Nigeria who is attracted to Enuma. Before he can initiate, she zaps him and then kisses him while he is paralyzed. He starts to film women using their emerging power and publishing it online. Margot is a mayor in Wisconsin who discovers her daughter Jocelyn is also developing these powers. Allie is a foster girl who is attacked by her foster father and kills him with her powers before taking refuge in a convent. As the powers emerge across the world, Tunde's reputation allows him unique access to document the turmoil in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. Allie discovers how to use her powers to heal and becomes an influential religious leader, propagating a matriarchal doctrine. Margot develops training camps for the women to use their powers. As women in Moldovia start paramilitary groups, Tatiana, the wife of the president of Moldovia steps in to take over the country. Awadi-Atif develops a rebel army to oppose her. Tunde almost gets raped in India. Margot becomes Governor by using her powers to silence her male counterpart during a debate. A drug called glitter enhances the power of women's skeins, which are the organs responsible for their electrical powers. UrbanDox gains influence as an anti-woman activist. Roxy takes over her father's criminal enterprise. Tatiana begins to behave erratically, leading mass killings of men. Allie kills Tatiana and decides to take the world back to the stone age to reset its growth and structures based on women's powers. The influential author responds to the young male writer telling him it is a worthy book but that he should publish it under a woman's name.

Development history The Power is Alderman's fourth novel and was influenced by her relationship with Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood. The mentorship was arranged through the Rolex mentorship program. In an interview with The Telegraph in 2012, Alderman explained the influence of Atwood's work on her as a novelist before the mentorship as, \\"I‚Äôd been to an Orthodox Jewish primary school where every morning the boys said, ‚ÄòThank you God for not making me a woman.‚Äô If you put that together with The Handmaid's Tale in your head, something will eventually go fizz! Boom!\\" In another interview for The Guardian regarding The Power, Alderman described being inspired by Atwood, saying, \\"The one thing Margaret directly suggested was the idea of a convent.\\" Within the novel, the setting of the convent plays a crucial role during the development of the power of women. Literary significance and reception The book, backed up by critics‚Äô reviews and awards, was broadly regarded as significant work of literature. The Washington Post reviewer Ron Charles praised the novel as \\"one of those essential feminist works that terrifies and illuminates, enrages and encourages.\\" The Power was the winner of the Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction in 2017. The novel was also featured fourth in The 10 Best Books of 2017 list by The New York Times. The Guardian‚Äôs deputy literary editor Justine Jordan praised the book by stating \\"it's also endlessly nuanced and thought-provoking, combining elegantly efficient prose with beautiful meditations on the metaphysics of power, possibility and change.\\" There were some who criticized the novel. The New York Times Book Review contributor Amal El-Mohtar criticized the book for worldbuilding and philosophical inconsistencies. Sequel In December 2016, Alderman confessed that \\"readers of The Power are already asking me if there'll be a sequel ‚Äì there won't be another novel (probably), but there are definitely so many more stories to tell than I had room for in the book.\\" Adaptations=Television The novel is set to be turned into a ten-episode Amazon Prime Video television series. The TV rights to Naomi Alderman's work were acquired by Jane Featherstone in an 11-way auction. Upon this acquisition, Alderman said that \\"I can't wait to expand this story ‚Äì and bring electric women to TV screens around the world.\\" Along with being the series' writer, Alderman will also be a producer. The series intends to portray the characters' storylines from the book, while also exploring the characters' lives beyond the established narrative. The series will be directed and executive produced by Reed Morano,https://deadline.com/2019/02/reed-morano-jane-featherstone-the- power-amazon-1202556710/ director of the first three episodes of the acclaimed series The Handmaid's Tale.

Malpeque was armed with a single quick- firing (QF) /40 caliber Mk IV gun mounted forward. This was later replaced with a 12-pounder () 12 cwt HA gun.Macpherson (1997), p. 19 For anti-aircraft purposes, the minesweeper was equipped with one QF 2-pounder Mark VIII and two single-mounted QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns. The 2-pounder gun was later replaced with a powered twin 20 mm Oerlikon mount. As a convoy escort, Malpeque was deployed with 40 depth charges launched from two depth charge throwers and four chutes. Operational history The minesweeper was ordered as part of the 1939‚Äì40 building programme. The ship's keel was laid down on 24 April 1940 by North Vancouver Ship Repairs Ltd. at their yard in North Vancouver, British Columbia. Malpeque was launched on 5 September 1940 and commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 4 August 1941 at Vancouver.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 172 After commissioning, the minesweeper transferred to the East Coast of Canada, arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 19 October 1941. Malpeque was initially assigned to Sydney Force, the local patrol and escort force operating out of Sydney, Nova Scotia. The vessel transferred to Newfoundland Force, the patrol and escort force operating out of St. John's, Newfoundland. She remained with Newfoundland Force until 19 February 1944, when the minesweeper sailed for Europe as part of Canada's contribution to the invasion of Normandy. Malpeque arrived in March 1944 and was assigned to the 31st Minesweeping Flotilla, an all-Canadian flotilla of minesweepers taking part in the D-Day invasions.Schull, p. 233 During the invasion, Malpeque and her fellow minesweepers swept and marked channels through the German minefields leading into the invasion beaches.Schull, pp. 233‚Äì34 The 31st Minesweeping Flotilla swept channel 3 on 6 June, completing the task unmolested by the Germans.Schull, pp. 270‚Äì273 The minesweeper returned to Canada in April 1945 to undergo a refit at Liverpool, Nova Scotia. After completion of the refit, Malpeque returned to European waters in June rejoining the 31st Minesweeping Flotilla. The flotilla spent the next few months sweeping the English Channel for mines.Douglas et al., A Blue Water Navy, p. 337 The ship remained in European waters until September when Malpeque returned to Canada and was paid off on 9 October 1945. The minesweeper was then placed in reserve at Shelburne, Nova Scotia. In 1946, Malpeque was moved to the strategic reserve at Sorel, Quebec. During the Korean War, the vessel was reacquired by the Royal Canadian Navy, given the new hull number FSE 186 and re-designated a coastal escort.Blackman, p. 99 However, the ship was never recommissioned and was laid up at Sydney until sold for scrap in February 1959 to Marine Industries and broken up at Sorel.Colledge, p. 388 References=NotesCitationsSources   * External links * * Category:Bangor-class minesweepers of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:Ships built in British Columbia Category:Ships of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:1940 ships ","title":"HMCS Malpeque"},{"id":"52173922","text":"Natalya Sharina (born 1957) is the director of the Ukrainian Literature Library in Moscow. She was put under house arrest in 2015 under the charges of inciting ethnic hatred and spreading \\"anti-Russian propaganda\\". In 2016, Sharina was put on trial for disseminating banned literature and embezzling library funds. Ukraine officially protested against the arrest of Sharina, who has been designated a political prisoner by human rights organization Memorial. Human Rights Watch demanded her immediate release. Arrest and charges The Ukrainian Literature Library, located in central Moscow, stocks some 60,000 books mainly in the Ukrainian language. In 2010, the Russian interior ministry‚Äôs anti-extremism department confiscated about 50 books and a case on inciting ethnic hatred was opened. Sharina became the library director in 2011. In October 2015, she was detained on suspicion of inciting ethnic hatred. An investigative committee ordered her arrest after the investigators found books in the library that allegedly disseminated \\"anti-Russian propaganda\\", such as the books of Dmytro Korchynsky, which are banned in Russia. Similar charges had been made against her in 2010, but they turned out to be baseless, and were dropped by the authorities in 2013. But the new case against her claimed that she used library funds to pay for her legal defense in the old case. On 2 November, Sharina was placed under house arrest and banned from speaking directly to journalists. She denied the charges, saying the banned books were \\"planted during the searches,\\" a claim that was repeated by staff members. About half the librarians from the Ukrainian Library were summoned for questioning and at least two employees had their apartments searched by police in early morning raids. Her trial for disseminating banned literature classed as extremist and for embezzling library funds began on 2 November 2016. She pleaded not guilty and said that books had been planted in the library. On 5 June 2017 she was found guilty of inciting hatred to Russians and embezzlement. She received a four-year suspended sentence. Reactions The case was widely covered in Russian state-owned media. NTV television channel ran a short documentary in December 2015 alleging the library carried out the orders of the Ukrainian security services at the behest of the CIA. The Ukrainian foreign ministry issued a note of protest, describing the investigation as \\"not the first attempt of the Kremlin's to put the labels of 'Russophobia' and 'extremism' on everything that's Ukrainian\\". Sharina was designated a political prisoner by Russian human rights organization Memorial. Human Rights Watch called for her immediate release. Amnesty International reacted to Sharina's conviction stating \\"The prosecution has exploited the highly charged anti-Ukrainian atmosphere that is prevalent in Russia at the moment, while the court simply dismissed key evidence for the defense\\".

She is best known for her series about the Five Little Monkeys, starting with her retelling of the classic nursery rhyme \\"Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed.\\" Other notable books include stories set in her home state of Vermont; stories featuring Emma the Desperate Dog, inspired by Christelow's dog Emma (now deceased); and Vote!, a non-fiction work about the voting process. As an author, she has been largely collected by libraries worldwide.  Biography  Eileen Christelow was born in Washington, DC to Allan Christelow, a historian and business executive, and Dorothy (Beal) Christelow, an economist. She grew up there and in New Canaan, Connecticut. Her father's job with the Standard Vacuum Oil Company took the family to Japan for a year, when she was 14 years old, and she spent her freshman year of high school at the American School in Japan, in Tokyo. Christelow completed her high school education at Abbot Academy, and graduated in 1965 from the University of Pennsylvania, where she studied architecture and learned the basic principles of design which would inform her later work in photography, graphic design, and illustration. Christelow met her husband, Ahren Ahrenholz, while living in his native Philadelphia, and they married in 1965. She spent the next six years working as a freelance photographer, photographing architecture, inner-city street life, schools, and the political demonstrations of the 1960s. Her pictures were published in magazines and textbooks. In 1971 the couple moved to Cornwall, England for a year, while Ahrenholz apprenticed to potter Michael Cardew. Their daughter, Heather, was born in Cornwall in March 1972. In 1972 the family returned to the United States, settling in Kensington, California, where Ahrenholz opened Colusa Pottery. In 1981 they moved back east, to Vermont, where Christelow had spent childhood summers on her grandparents‚Äô farm. They currently live in East Dummerston, Vermont, in a house designed and built by Christelow's husband.  Career  Eileen Christelow worked as a freelance photographer and graphic designer before deciding to try her hand at writing and illustrating children's picture books. In between graphic design jobs, and while her young daughter, Heather, was at day care, Christelow worked on book ideas, creating dummies that she sent out to publisher after publisher. A course at the University of California‚Äôs extension program, ‚ÄúWriting for Children,‚Äù taught by former Harper & Row editor Betty Bacon, provided the feedback that Christelow needed to polish two of her book ideas into completed dummies. Bacon also provided an invaluable contact, suggesting that Christelow show her books to Jim Giblin, at Clarion Books. She did so in August 1981, and Giblin bought both books, Henry and the Red Stripes, which was published in 1982, and Mr. Murphy‚Äôs Marvelous Invention, published in 1983. More than 30 books followed, with Giblin continuing as Christelow's editor until his death in 2016. In addition to the Five Little Monkey series, Christelow's books include stories inspired by her dog, Emma, who died in 2013 but lives on in Letters from a Desperate Dog and The Desperate Dog Writes Again. Other stories, including The Five-Dog Night and The Great Pig Escape, were inspired by true stories, and feature the culture and landscape of her native state of Vermont. Non-fiction titles include What Do Authors Do?, What Do Illustrators Do? and Vote! Several of the Monkey books have been translated into Spanish (published in bilingual English/Spanish editions) and Chinese. The Robbery at the Diamond Dog Diner was adapted for the PBS children's series Reading Rainbow in 1988, where it was narrated by actor Peter Falk.

She was the daughter of Tlaca√©lael, a counselor to the Aztec kings and the niece of the Tlatoani warrior Axayacatl. She lived through the height of the Aztec civilization's expansion. Her life and works are an example of gender parallelism in pre-Hispanic Mexico, where women were given the same opportunities enjoyed by men.  Life  There is little information about the life of Macuilxochitzin. The poet was born about 1435 to a prominent family of Aztec nobility through her father Tlaca√©lael, who was a famous politician and served as adviser to the Tlatoanis. She was also the daughter (or the second in command) to the powerful female figure called Cihuacoatl (Woman Snake). She had twelve siblings, each born to a different mother. Tlaca√©lael may also have adopted her from a tribe called Chichimeca after it was destroyed by nomadic incursions, and then given her the name \\"Macuilxochitzin.\\" Her name probably means \\"Madam Five Flower,\\" based on the Aztec, having been born on a 5 Flower day on the Aztec calendar. However, other scholars argue that her name could be derived from the name of a goddess of the arts, songs and dance, once she was already a recognized poet. In addition to poetry, Macuilxochitzin was skilled in embroidery and loom weaving.  Works  According to Miguel Le√≥n Portilla in his book Fifteen Poets of the Aztec World, Macuilxochitzin lived in Mexico-Tenochtitlan during the pinnacle of the Aztec civilization. Portilla states that she lived her life at court and was \\"as wise and as competent as the king.\\" Her poetry was also described as reflective of her insider knowledge of the king and Aztec politics. The majority of her poetic work focused on the battles and confrontations that her father waged during the expansion of the Aztec empire across Mesoamerica. Only one poem that survives from that legacy can be attributed to her authorship and pertains to the decisive actions of a group of Otomi women who, through their prayers, saved the life of T√≠latl, the Otomi captain who had been injured by a Mexica sovereign. This campaign, which was planned by her father, happened during the conquest of Axay√°catl where the indigenous groups, the Matlatzincas and Otomies, had settled in the Toluca Valley in 1476. Most of the poetry, however, extolled the Aztec forces and the leadership of their sovereign.

Rosa was one of the sisters of Juan Pablo Duarte, an activist politician and one of the founding fathers of the Dominican Republic. Following her older brother's steps, Rosa strongly supported the Dominican independent cause by actively participating in secret societies such as La Trinitaria and La Filantr√≥pica.  Biography  Duarte was born in the city of Santo Domingo, more precisely, in a neighborhood called Santa B√°rbara, on June 28, 1820. She was the daughter of Juan Jos√© Duarte Rodr√≠guez and Manuela D√≠ez Jim√©nez. Her elder brother, Juan Pablo Duarte, was considered one of the fathers of the Dominican nation.Educando: Rosa Duarte, mujer independentista Influenced by her brother's ideals, Rosa devoted her life to his patriotic cause, becoming an active member of the political and military, independentist secret society called La Trinitaria. Her contributions towards the Dominican nation are considered by the historian Emilio Rodr√≠guez Demorizi as the \\"New Testament\\" of the Dominican history.Educando: Rosa Duarte Rosa and her group of friends participated in plays performed at a building that used to be an old jail --C√°rcel Vieja--, located next to Borgell√° Palace, in front of Parque Colon. From that strategic place, she and other activists would raise awareness about the independent cause. With these plays, this group of people would collect resources in order to buy ammunition and cover the expenses for the Dominican independent cause. In 1845, Rosa was condemned to leave her homeland and was deported along with her mother and siblings, thus leaving behind her fianc√©e, Tom√°s de la Concha, who was executed in 1855 together with the soldier Antonio Duverge.  Death  On October 26, 1888, Rosa died in Caracas, Venezuela, due to dysentery. Her siblings died two years after she did.  Honors  One of the main streets in Santo Domingo is called Rosa Duarte in her honor. The street goes from Bol√≠var Avenue until 27 de Febrero Avenue.

He established FundsDirect in 1999 and co- founded Absolute Capital Management in 2004. In 2009 he acquired a majority stake in Pinmar, the world's largest yacht painting company, from the Ferretti Group. His wealth has been estimated at ‚Ç¨95m and he has featured on the Irish Independent's Irish Rich List since 2010. Early life and career Ewing, a native of Donegal, was born the Irish seaport of Sligo in 1965 and attended Summerhill College. On leaving school, Ewing worked for his uncle's small engineering business in Letterkenny while studying accountancy at the University of Ulster. He was invited to run the investment arm of an Irish building society, developing its tax planning, financial planning and portfolio management services. This led to an opportunity to partner with Hichens, Harrison & Co, the oldest firm of stockbrokers in the City of London, to acquire IPS Capital Management, the Bristol-based fund management business.  Fund Management  IPS Capital Management was reversed into Farlake, a property company listed on London Stock Exchange's AIM market. Following the reversal, Farlake was repositioned as an asset management company which grew to $1bn assets under management before being sold to Talisman Group in 2000. Ewing carved out from that sale the fund trading business which he had launched in 1999, called FundsDirect, the UK's first online fund supermarket. The platform allowed banks to trade around 36,000 funds across 13 European countries. In 2003 FundsDirect was sold to Egg and The Prudential for ‚Ç¨32m. In 2004, Ewing co-founded Absolute Capital Management and listed 30% of the company on AIM in 2005. The company won several accolades including European Hedge Fund of the Year in 2006. Ewing retired from Absolute Capital in July 2007 to spend more time with his wife and two young daughters. In September 2007 the company's co-founder Florian Homm resigned and the share price collapsed.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2816024/Absolute- Capital-shares-plunge.html In 2016 the US Department of Justice entered a Settlement with Ewing as part of its investigation into Florian Homm, the Chief Investment Officer of Absolute Capital. The settlement acknowledged that Ewing had not undertaken any criminal wrongdoing nor had any knowledge of the alleged stock manipulation scheme that Homm had masterminded and for which Homm was indicted and charged by the US authorities. In July 2017, all charges against Ewing relating to the Homm case were dismissed with prejudice.  Yachting  In 2009, Ewing entered the luxury yacht industry by acquiring the Ferretti Group's 60% stake in Pinmar, the world's largest yacht painting company, and investing in YCO, a yacht chartering company. In September 2012 Ewing launched an online platform for yacht charters called CharterBid.com. Ewing served as Chairman of Pinmar until its merger in September 2015 with Rolling Stock to form a new company, Global Yachting Group, (GYG).  Sport  Ewing was an avid golfer in his youth, participating in the Irish Amateur and British Amateur. He also played rugby for his County and captained the County team in Gaelic football.

He had been intensively involved with the creation of a set of books that would summarize his life and philosophy, and was already overworked, so this new setback precipitated a physical and mental breakdown.

Biography  Daughter of Doctor Pedro Infanz√≥n and Epifan√≠a Canel y Ur√≠a, Eva Agar was born on January 30, 1857 in Coa√±a, Asturias, Spain. When she was three years old her father died in a shipwreck caused by pirates and she moved to Madrid with her mother. When she was fifteen, she began to work as an actress in the theater, where she met Eloy Perillan y Buxo, the director of the satirical magazine La Broma, whom she married that same year. In 1874, the censors exiled her husband for publishing a pamphlet and he left to Bolivia, leaving her as director of the magazine. A year later, Eva traveled to South America to reunite with her husband and collaborate on El Ferrocarril, the magazine that he directed in La Paz. In January 18754, the couple moved to Buenos Aires and founded El Petr√≥leo, where she began to dedicate herself to journalism full-time. In 1876, they decided to move again, this time to Lima, Peru, where they founded Las Noticias and collaborated with various newspapers such as El Comercio and El Per√∫ Ilustrado. It was then that the couple's only child was born, whom they baptized with the same name as his father. Due to the War of the Pacific between Peru and Chile, Eva and her family returned to Spain once again, settling in Barcelona. Nonetheless, Perill√°n ended up moving to Cuba, where he died on March 1, 1889, and Eva moved to the island a short time later. There, she tried to find work in two Cuban newspapers, Diario de la Marina and Uni√≥n Constitucional, but their respective directors refused to hire her. Because of this, in 1891 she founded her own weekly, named La Cotorra, which was characterized by political satire. After spending eight years in Cuba and the Cuban war of Independence ended, Eva returned to Spain, moving back to Madrid. Nonetheless, in 1899, she returned to Buenos Aires, where she began her literary peak, writing three novels, giving a number of conferences and collaborating with various newspapers5. Additionally, she became the owner of a printing press and founded the magazines Kosmos, in 1904 and Vida Espa√±ola, in 19073. On July 15, 1905, she gave a lecture at the gala in the Teatro Espa√±ol, during the festivities for the inauguration of the Hospital of Charity. Jaime Serralta presented the prestigious writer who spoke on \\"Charity\\" and was given a standing ovation. In 1914, Eva began a trip through Latin America, but fell ill upon arriving in Panama, and although she initially decided to go to a clinic in the United States, she ended up returning to Cuba, where she received assistance from her friend Antonio D√≠az Blanco. There she continued her journalism and literary work until 1924 when her health deteriorated and she began to have nervous breakdowns and memory loss.

In 1030, during the joint reign of Salih's sons and successors, Nasr and Thimal, Muqallid was dispatched as an envoy to Byzantine emperor Romanos III and attempted to persuade him to halt his advance against Aleppo.Zakkar 1971, p. 112. Romanos rejected the Mirdasids' offer of tribute and detained Muqallid. Romanos continued his advance but was routed by the Mirdasids at the Battle of Azaz. Muqallid was put in charge of the Aleppo Citadel in June 1038 by Thimal after the latter fled Aleppo in the wake of Nasr's battlefield death at the hands of the Fatimid general Anushtakin al-Dizbari.Zakkar 1971, p. 132. After Aleppo's deputy governor, Khalifa ibn Jabir al-Kilabi, surrendered the city to al- Dizbari's forces on 19 June, Muqallid continued to hold out. When al-Dizbari himself arrived in Aleppo, Muqallid negotiated his surrender with him and was ultimately allowed to safely depart Aleppo, taking with him numerous treasures from the citadel.Bianquis 1993, p. 118. After al-Dizbari died in January 1042, Muqallid and Thimal arrived at Aleppo, the latter already having been appointed governor by Fatimid decree, and were allowed in by the city's inhabitants. The Fatimid governor of Damascus, Nasir al-Dawla ibn Hamdan, launched an offensive against the Mirdasids in 1050 after Muqallid's brother Ja'far killed the Fatimid governor of Hims, Ja'far ibn Kulayd al- Kutami.Bianquis 1993, pp. 118‚Äì119. To prevent the Fatimids from establishing strongholds in the region of Aleppo, Muqallid had the citadels of Hama and Maarrat al-Nu'man dismantled. The Mirdasids' Kilabi forces routed the Fatimids later that year. Muqallid's son Mani' also played a role in Mirdasid politics, in alliance with Mahmud ibn Nasr against his uncle Atiyya ibn Salih.

Its exact location is unknown. with The graves are of those prisoners whose bodies were left unclaimed or were not taken to one of the state's medical colleges. They were buried in common graves that contained up to eight bodies. Tall limestone markers were placed at each grave and contained the prisoner's name and death date. They were moved here when this cemetery was established in 1914. Subsequent graves hold individual bodies, and are marked with shorter limestone markers with the prisoner's name, age, date of death, and sometimes their prison number. They are in three different styles. Two styles are upright stones, one with a triangular top and the other with a rounded top. They were used from 1914 to the 1940s. The third style of stone is a flat, horizontal marker that was used from the 1940s to the present. The cemetery is a triangular piece of land located on Farm No. 1 with the graves arranged in rows at an angle.

With 36 patents filed, Multibeam develops multicolumn e-beam systems and platforms for four major applications: Complementary E-Beam Lithography (CEBL), Direct Electron Writing (DEW), Direct Deposition/Etch (DDE), and E-Beam Inspection (EBI). Applications * Direct Electron Writing (DEW) embeds security information in each IC including chip ID, IP or MAC address, and chip-specific information such as keys used in encryption. Chip ID is used for supply chain traceability and to detect counterfeits. Hardware-embedded encryption keys are used to authenticate software. Chip-specific information written into DEW-bit registers is non- volatile. * Complementary Electron Beam Lithography (CEBL) works with optical lithography to pattern cuts (of lines in \\"lines-and-cuts\\" layout) and holes (i.e., contacts and vias) with no masks. * Direct Deposition/Etch (DDE) can be used in chip fabrication or wafer defect repair. Precursors or reactants are introduced through gas injectors. Activation electrons are directed in accordance with the design layout database to deposit or remove material at precise locations on the substrate. * Multi-column Electron Beam Inspection (EBI) for wafer defect detection and metrology.

She was born on September 26, 1924 according to her biography, but her birth certificate states that she was born October 8 of the same year (the certificate also claims that she was actually born in a house on Ituzaing√≥ Street in Durazno). When she was born, her mother was fifteen years old even though the birth certificate says that she was sixteen. L√°grima never knew her father, but was close with her maternal grandparents. The grandmother, regardless of her poverty, helped her teenage daughter raise a young L√°grima. L√°grima's grandmother came to Uruguay with a group of slaves that escaped from Brazil and came to Uruguay by means of the Yaguar√≥ River. L√°grima would describe her grandmother as a woman who would \\"cut through the bad with scissors\\". When her grandparents moved to Montevideo, they taught different styles of dance to other blacks. Her grandmother would live to be 89 years old. As a child, L√°grima R√≠os lived in extreme poverty. However, in spite of her lack of money and comforts, even in her childhood she knew she wanted to be a dancer. When she was very young, her mother left the city of Durazno and they lived in many different places in the capital city. They moved places often as her mother accepted whatever work she could. While growing up, L√°grima would listen to the music that played on the radios of her neighbors while her mother worked as a housemaid, a cook, and as a laundress. L√°grima would memorize the music and the lyrics and then sing and dance along with the music. L√°grima later related that, at three years old, she fell in love with singing through listening to the records in the houses her mother worked in. L√°grima first worked as a housemaid. The house that she worked in had a radio through which she could listen to the music. She listened to music from every class of people and committed the lyrics to memory. The piano that was in the house dazzled her, and she learned how to tune it and, eventually, how to play. L√°grima later worked as a cook for an ambassador of the United States; through this she became familiar with the blues and other American styles of music that she learned to sing with power and emotion. L√°grima had a son from her first marriage and named him Eduardo. He was Tupamaros militant that spent 30 years in Sweden as an exile.Moreno, Mar√≠a (18 de junio de 2006). ¬´El tango es l√°grima¬ª.

Following the death of Jos√© Piolho, Tereza became the queen of the quilombo, and, under her leadership, the black and indigenous community resisted slavery for two decades, surviving up to 1770, when the quilombo was destroyed by the military forces of Luiz Pinto de Souza Coutinho. The entire population (79 black people and 30 indigenous people) was killed or arrested.  Administration  Queen Tereza led the political, economical and administrative structure of the quilombo, maintaining a defense system with guns traded with white people or redeemed from the nearby villages. The stolen objects used against the black community that used to take refugee there were transformed into work instruments, because they knew how to work with forge. The Quilombo do Guariter√™, besides the parliament and a queen counselor, developed cotton production and owned looms where they produced fabric that was commercialized outside the quilombos.

She was a born in Paysand√∫ on December 14, 1883 and died in Santa Luc√≠a, on April 10, 1940.  Biography  Her father was √Ångel Luisi Pisano, an Italian who brought to America his masonic ideas of liberty. Her mother, Mar√≠a Teresa Josefina Janicki, was a teacher and daughter of exiled Poles living in France. Her parents arrived as newlyweds in Entre R√≠os, Argentina, in 1872, and moved to Paysand√∫, Uruguay, in 1878, before finally settling down in Montevideo in 1887. The Luisi-Janicki clan was a family of workers and educators that developed in an environment of resistance and rebellion, and tended to think more liberally for their time. Their six daughters were educated and several of them attended universities, becoming some of the first professional women in Uruguay. Luisa was an attentive student, studying education in the Instituto Normal de Se√±oritas \\"Mar√≠a Stagnero de Munar,\\" and graduated in 1903. She began her career as an assistant teacher in the Second School of the Third-Grade, and went on to direct the Second-Grade School of Practice and the School of Application. Still quite young, she became a writer for the paper La Raz√≥n of Montevideo. She was part of the Consejo Nacional de Ense√±anza Primaria y Normal from 1925 until her retirement in 1929. She was also a Spanish professor in the Women's Section of Secondary Education and taught literature and oration in the Mar√≠a Stagnero de Munar Institute. Luisa published four poems whilst also dabbling in prose with four other edited works that were mostly dedicated to education. She participated as an official delegate in the Congress of the Child, created in Buenos Aires in 1916, and occupied the position of secretary in the Department of Education of the Second Congress of the Child, held in Montevideo three years later. In her older age, she contracted an irreversible paralysis that confined her to a sedentary lifestyle. Luisa also excelled as a literary critic. She was declared an honorary member of the Association of Primary School Professors of Rio de Janeiro.  Works  Criticism has focused on the classics employed in her verse and the intellectual values expressed in her poetry; she is grouped with the other three Uruguayan women of the modernist movement (modernismo): Mar√≠a Eugenia Vaz Ferreira, Juana de Ibarbourou and Delmira Agustini. Luisa's philosophically inclined poetry and her rigorous critical works quickly reached an international public platform in Buenos Aires and in Barcelona and is studied in Madrid and in Paris. She is discussed by Rafael Cansinos Assens (Verde y Dorado en Las Letras Americanas. Semblanzas e Impesiones Criticas [1926‚Äì1936] Aguilar, Madrid 1947), F.

It had its world premiere at Fantastic Fest in September 2018. The film began streaming on Netflix on 12 October 2018. The story follows a British man as he attempts to rescue his sister from an evil cult on a remote island. The film received generally positive reviews from critics. Plot In 1905, Thomas Richardson travels to a remote Welsh island to rescue his sister, Jennifer, who has been kidnapped and held for ransom by a mysterious cult. Posing as a convert, Thomas encounters the leader, Malcolm Howe, who founded the cult with two other convicts, Frank and Quinn. They claim that the barren island was rendered fertile through blood sacrifice. Thomas discovers Frank's son Jeremy and Quinn's daughter Ffion sneaking home after a tryst. He forces Jeremy to admit that Jennifer was kidnapped for ransom, as the cult does not have the resources to pay for the continuous animal sacrifices needed to maintain the island's fertility. One of the newcomers attempts to assassinate Malcolm, but Thomas intervenes and is wounded. The same night, Malcolm parades Jennifer through the village, claiming she will be killed if her co-conspirator does not come forward. Thomas flees from an old woman who chases him, and escapes to a beach cave covered in markings, indicating the presence of a deity. Malcolm visits a barn where the old woman who is, in fact, the island's deity, is imprisoned in tree roots; he reprimands her for appearing to Thomas before feeding her his blood, causing the vegetation imprisoning her to bloom. He tells Malcolm's daughter Andrea that he was a Christian missionary who was persecuted in Peking during the Boxer Rebellion for introducing Christianity to China, and lost his faith as a result. She takes him to a shack in a wheat field to hide. Ffion reveals to Jeremy that she is pregnant and the pair decide to elope. However, Quinn murders Ffion in a forced abortion. Jeremy stabs Quinn and guards capture him. Quinn frames Jeremy for Ffion's murder and uses a \\"purification\\" ritual to murder him. Quinn calls Malcolm a false prophet and demands that he prove himself by killing Thomas. Frank, enraged by the death of his son, attacks Quinn, allowing Thomas to escape. Frank and Thomas flee and arrive at the barn where The Goddess is being held. Frank enters, intent on killing The Goddess, but is killed by a masked figure, The Grinder, whom Thomas witnesses force-feeding Frank's blood to The Goddess. Sneaking past, he finds Jennifer alive but strung up in a sack. As he releases her, he is knocked unconscious. He finds himself tethered to a meat-grinding table by hooks embedded into his hands and legs. He escapes and kills The Grinder. Quinn reveals to a captive Jennifer and Andrea that he imprisoned The Goddess after he and Malcolm realized her powers. He plans to repeatedly impregnate them and use their offspring as blood sacrifices. The Goddess shows Thomas her history with the cult, and begs him to set her free; he grants her wish by immolating her. The village also catches fire and the villagers flee to boats. Thomas, Andrea, and Jennifer overpower and kill Quinn at the cost of Thomas sustaining stab wounds. He collapses, bidding Jennifer and Andrea farewell as they escape by boat. His faith restored, Thomas is discovered by an injured Malcolm. As he bleeds onto the ground, the vegetation around him grows and infuse within his body, while his eyes turn the same shape and color as the goddess's, signifying his rebirth as the new guardian of the island.

Biography =Early years Lidia M. Mannuzzu was born in Sassari, Sardinia, Italy. She was the daughter of the writer Salvatore Mannuzzu; and she had a sister, Mary. Mannuzzu graduated with honors in Medicine from University of Sassari in 1984, with a thesis on favism. She continued her studies at the Max Planck Institute, at Brunel University in London, and Aachen Medical School in Westphalia. Immediately after graduation and until 1986, she worked as a researcher in the Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, University of Turin, participating in research on cell membrane of platelets and blood cells that have a fundamental role in hemostasis. University of California, Berkeley In 1987, she left Italy to pursue a master's degree in physiology at University of California, Berkeley, receiving her Ph.D. in 1990. During the 1990s, with her colleagues Mario Morrone and Ehud Isacoff, she studied the voltage-gated ion channel in cells. The three researchers developed a new technique to monitor the movement of different amino acids in the ion channel proteins of cell membranes by tagging them with fluorophores. The change of the fluorescence of the amino acid probes after electrical stimulation (and related responses by the involved membrane proteins) provided the first real-time measure of protein motion in the channel‚Äôs voltage sensor. She developed and patented biomedical technologies targeted to the red blood cells processes, and of nervous system cell function. In 2000, as a researcher, she became a professor at Berkeley, continuing to study the workings of synapses. In 2005, she left Berkeley to found Nano Med Technology, a company that studied the use of new drugs for diseases associated with dysfunction of cellular membranes. Many of her studies were published in journals such as PNAS (the official publication of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States), Nature, and Science. Return to Italy Mannuzzu returned to Italy in 2006, with the support of a Ministry of scientific research program for the return of Italian emigrants from abroad. She continued her research work in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Sassari, where she studied the relationship between the diseases of red blood cells and thalassemia. She died on 24 October 2016, from a pulmonary embolism. Patent * Patent n. 5,756,351, 13 January 1997. Biomolecular optical sensors.

History George Napier Birks (24 October 1838 ‚Äì 14 September 1895) and William Hanson Birks (28 December 1841 ‚Äì 5 August 1925) were sons of Dr. George Vause Birks (c. 1815 ‚Äì 31 January 1858), who with his wife and family emigrated from England to South Australia on the Leonidas, arriving at Glenelg, South Australia in December 1853, and settled in Angaston. Dr. Birks begun practising in the town, with his wife and older sons filling prescriptions. Dr. Birks died at 42 years of age, as a result of being thrown from his horse. Mrs Birks then ran a store in Angaston. In 1856 G. N. Birks started working for F. H. Faulding & Co at their chemist's shop at 5 Rundle Street, Adelaide as a trainee. Around 1860 he moved to Kooringa, where he dispensed for the two doctors who were practising there, then around two years later moved to Wallaroo mines, where he opened his first shop in 1861, and for many years served as Justice of the Peace. In 1862 he opened a pharmacy in Kadina, installing his brother William as manager. These two businesses later diversified into stationery and books. He opened a third shop at Moonta with his brother John Napier Birks (30 August 1845 ‚Äì 10 May 1929) as manager. John would in 1879 have his own pharmacy in Port Adelaide, at the corner of St. Vincent Street and Commercial Road, later at 130 William Street Perth. :Meanwhile in 1864 brother Charles Napier Birks (13 February 1844 ‚Äì 29 April 1924), in partnership with David Robin (c. 1835 ‚Äì 24 February 1914) had taken over the softgoods business of G. Shaw at 89 Hindley Street. They would then, in 1871 take over J. Ballantyne & Co.'s store at 38 Rundle Street, so beginning the history of Charles Birks & Co, one of Adelaide's great department stores. The business prospered and in October 1874 the brothers were able to open a stationery and book store \\"G.N. & W.H. Birks\\" at 60 Rundle Street, Adelaide, with William in charge. In August 1888 they moved the stationery shop to premises at 68 Rundle Street. Holden & Birks, 59 Rundle Street became Birks Chemists July 1879, their home for over 120 years Birks chemists 1920 G.N. & W.H. Birks opened a Homoeopathic Chemists shop at 51 Rundle Street in January 1879, and moved to 59 Rundle Street (on the Gawler Place corner) in July the same year. This building was earlier (1871‚Äì1874) the home of retail saddlery and leathergoods business Holden & Birks, a partnership of brother Alfred James Birks (7 June 1840 ‚Äì 7 Dec 1873) and James Alexander Holden, founder of the business that became General Motors Holden. While the two businesses were registered as G.N. & W.H. Birks, George owned the stationer's at No. 60 and William the chemist's at No. 59 (around 1921-1922 renumbered as No. 57, and in 1973 Rundle Street became Rundle Mall). In November 1888 they took over F. J. Eyre's newly opened chemist's shop at 6 Rundle Street, which they renamed \\"Birks Bros.\\", but relinquished it less than two years later. Frederick James Eyre (c. 1862‚Äì1926) established another shop at O'Connell Street, North Adelaide. :George Napier Birks married Helen Rosetta Thomas (30 August 1845 ‚Äì 3 May 1932) on 28 January 1863. She was the second daughter of William Kyffin Thomas. He and his wife joined the second contingent which left Adelaide on the Royal Tar in January 1894 for William Lane's \\"New Australia\\" settlement in Paraguay, along with other members of the Birks family: Alf (1874‚Äì1916), Constance (1877‚Äì1901), Elma (1893‚Äì ), Eric (1890‚Äì1948), Frank (1873‚Äì1953), Fred (1866‚Äì1948) and Grace ( ‚Äì1937), John Napier (1845‚Äì1929), (William) Kyffin (1875‚Äì1938), Walter (1847‚Äì1900) and Win (1882‚Äì1905). George died there; his wife returned to Adelaide. :William Hanson Birks married Adeline Jefferson \\"Ada\\" Raymond (c. 1840 ‚Äì August 1918) of Don River (Tasmania) on 28 August 1863. They had a summer residence in Beaumont; he died in Sydney. In 1906 William sold the business to Percival R. \\"Percy\\" Magarey, son of Dr. Sylvanus Magarey, and took on his younger brother William T. Magarey as an apprentice. The Magareys brought an American drug-store style to the old shop ‚Äî a marble counter with a soda fountain, syrups and ice-cream, high stools and mirrors. It became a popular meeting spot for the smart younger set. In 1922 A. K. Newberry joined and restructured the business as a limited liability company, which immediately purchased the property from J. BakewellPerhaps John Warren Bakewell (1 March 1847 ‚Äì 3 April 1923), son of William Bakewell for ‚Ç§20,000. Donald Magarey, another brother, joined the company, as did Edgar Vincent \\"EV\\" Lawton, who was in 1933 to marry Kathleen Elise, a daughter of W. T. Magarey. Newberry retired in 1953, and was replaced as chairman of directors by Lawton. Birks Chemists manufactured numerous pharmaceutical lines: \\"Marva\\" brand of rheumatism wafers, influenza wafers, chilblain liniment, cough mixture, and rheumatic mixture; \\"Sanovia\\" toothpaste, toilet cream, dentifrice liquid, dentifrice powder, healing ointment, tooth soap, hair tonic, bouquet perfume, bouquet sachets, toilet powder, medical soap, dental suction powder, depilatory powder, sunburn cream and snail killer; \\"Capilloid\\" hair dye and hair restorer, and \\"Acme\\" corn cure. In 1920 Birks Chemists became the subject of a legal controversy when they were convicted of illegally selling an alcoholic beverage, Sedna, a \\"tonic\\" made from port wine fortified with extracts of coca leaf, kola nut and beef. In 1933 Birks Chemists bought the premises at 278a Rundle Street near the East End Market and established a pharmacy there, managed by Edgar Lawton, and in 1947 another shop was opened at 147 St Vincent Street, Port Adelaide, managed by Kenneth Wall.

Design and description A British design, the Bangor-class minesweepers were smaller than the preceding s in British service, but larger than the in Canadian service.Chesneau, p. 64Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 167 They came in two versions powered by different engines; those with a diesel engines and those with vertical triple-expansion steam engines. Quatsino was of the latter design and was larger than her diesel-engined cousins. Quatsino was long overall, had a beam of and a draught of . The minesweeper had a displacement of . She had a complement of 6 officers and 77 enlisted. Quatsino had two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The minesweeper could carry a maximum of of fuel oil. Quatsino was armed with a single quick- firing (QF) /40 caliber Mk IV gun mounted forward.

Together with Mar√≠a Trinidad S√°nchez, Isabel Sosa and Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s Pina, she took part in designing the Dominican flag.  Biography  Concepci√≥n Bona was a daughter of Ignacio Bona P√©rez, one of the signatories of the Manifesto of January 16, 1844, and Juana de Dios Hern√°ndez, who was the eldest daughter of Josefa Brea Hern√°ndez, wife of the patrician Mat√≠as Ram√≥n Mella. She was also niece of a famous citizen Juan Pina, the father of :es:Pedro Alejandro Pina, who was prominent in the national independence movement and co-founder of the La Trinitaria secret society. The Haitian occupation of Santo Domingo began two years before her birth, and she grew up under Haitian rule. When Jean-Pierre Boyer took possession of the Dominican territory in 1822, the result was a political and cultural clash between the two countries, since the cultural base of the Haitians was Franco-African, while that of the Dominican people was Hispanic. For this reason the country was placed under military repression under :es:Ger√≥nimo de Borgell√°, who set about recruiting youths for the military service of the Dominican Republic. Bona grew up in a family fully committed to the patriotic cause that followed the ideas of Juan Pablo Duarte. Young and brave, with her family she unconditionally adopted the Trinitarian ideas. Thus it was that together with her cousin, Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s Pina, Isabel Sosa and Mar√≠a Trinidad S√°nchez, using fine fabrics she made the tricolor flag that was hoisted by the independence supporters in Puerta del Conde on February 27, 1844. This marked the birth of the independent Dominican Republic. According to Dominican historians, it was Bona herself who brought the flag to General Mat√≠as Ram√≥n Mella, founder of the country and the husband of her cousin Josefa Brea Hern√°ndez. Concepci√≥n Bona was aged 19 at the time and her cousin was 16. Bona married Marcos G√≥mez y Carvajal, who was from Ban√≠, on June 2, 1851. The couple had six children: Marcos Antonio, Manuel de Jes√∫s, Elo√≠sa, Rafael Mar√≠a, Jos√© Mar√≠a, and another Jos√© Mar√≠a. Concepci√≥n Bona died on July 2, 1901, in Santo Domingo. Her remains are preserved in the National Pantheon. A metro station in Santo Domingo is named after her.

He is well known for his study of lactic acid-producing bacteria, developing microbiological assays for a number of key nutrients; the discovery of more than half of known vitamins has been attributed to the use of this work. He discovered several B vitamins, including folic acid, and characterized the biochemistry of vitamin B6 (also known as pyrixodal). Early life and education The fourth of five children, Snell was born in 1914 in Salt Lake City, Utah to parents who met while serving as Mormon missionaries. The family moved several times in Wyoming and Utah before settling in Provo, Utah so that the children could attend Brigham Young University. Snell became interested in chemistry during high school and went on to study chemistry at BYU; he also ‚Äì \\"reluctantly\\", as he remembered later ‚Äì studied secondary education as \\"insurance\\" against the unemployment of the Great Depression. After graduation, he received a scholarship to continue his studies at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where he joined the research group of William Harold Peterson and began his long career studying nutrition and metabolism in microorganisms. Snell received his Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1938 and moved to the University of Texas at Austin, where he worked as a postdoctoral fellow with Roger J. Williams. Academic career Snell began his independent research career with an appointment as an assistant professor of chemistry at the University of Texas at Austin in 1941, advancing to associate professor in 1943. He then moved back to his alma mater in 1945, joining the biochemistry faculty of the University of Wisconsin and remaining there until 1951, when he returned to Austin to occupy newly constructed laboratory space. In 1956 he was offered the chairmanship of the biochemistry department at the University of California, Berkeley, and relocated his laboratory there. He served as chair until 1956 and remained in the department until 1976, departing briefly for sabbatical visits to Feodor Lynen's research group in Munich, Germany and later to Osaka University in 1971. After 20 years at Berkeley, Snell again returned to Austin for family reasons and became the chair of the microbiology department there for the following four years. Snell became the Ashbel Smith Professor of Chemistry in 1980 and retired, assuming professor emeritus status, in 1990. During his career Snell served on a number of scientific journal editorial boards, most notably as the editor of the Annual Review of Biochemistry from 1968 to 1983 and of Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications from 1970 to 1985. Research Snell is widely recognized as one of the foremost nutritional biochemists of the 20th century. His early work developing microbiological assays for key nutrients has been credited with facilitating the discovery of at least half of known vitamins due to their ease of use compared to more traditional animal studies. His 1939 publication describing a microbiological assay for riboflavin ‚Äì then one of just two B vitamins known ‚Äì is considered the first widely used such assay. His notable discoveries using these methods include the discovery and naming of folic acid, which Herschel K. Mitchell, Snell, and Roger J. Williams isolated from four tons of processed spinach and demonstrated to be a growth factor for the experimental organism Streptococcus faecalis. A version of Snell's microbiological assay method based on the experimental organism Lactobacillus casei (now known as Lactobacillus rhamnosus) is still used as a method for detecting folates in blood. Snell's interest in isolating and characterizing unknown nutrients and growth factors also led to the serendipitous discovery of useful biochemical tools. While working to characterize the yeast growth factor that would become known as biotin, Snell and coworkers discovered the egg white protein avidin, which binds biotin with extremely high affinity. At the time avidin was noted as a cause of \\"egg white injury\\", a form of biotin deficiency in animals. The rarity and expense of obtaining biotin at the time limited further investigations, but the extremely high avidin-biotin binding affinity was later exploited and is now widely used in molecular biology for purification and molecular detection applications. Snell is perhaps best known for his work on vitamin B6; he and Soviet scientist Alexander E. Braunstein have been cited as the \\"fathers of vitamin B6\\". Snell discovered two novel forms of the substance ‚Äì pyridoxal and pyridoxamine ‚Äì and thus elaborated the underlying biochemistry of enzymes that rely on pyridoxal cofactors for catalysis. In a series of experiments beginning in the 1940s and later conducted with student David Metzler, a general mechanism for the catalytic cycle of pyridoxal- dependent enzymes was discovered. Recalling his own work with pyridoxal, French biophysicist Michel E. Goldberg described Snell as \\"the pope of pyridoxal catalysis\\". Awards and honors Snell received a number of honors during his long career. * Eli Lilly Award in Bacteriology and Immunology (1945) * Member, National Academy of Sciences (1955) * Member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1962) * Fellow, American Institute of Nutrition (1982) * William C. Rose Award (1985) In recognition of his contributions to the study of vitamin B6 biochemistry, the 1999 meeting in a regular series of international symposia on pyridoxal catalysis was dedicated to Snell. Personal life While working at the University of Texas, Snell met his wife Mary, then a senior chemistry major. The couple married in 1941 and had four children, three sons and a daughter. They would return to the Austin, Texas area for family reasons twice during Snell's career. Mary died in 2003 after 62 years of marriage, while Snell died of prostate cancer and congestive heart failure at age 89, only six days after his wife's death. They were survived by three of their four children; one son was killed in action in 1968 during the Vietnam War. The Snells were buried alongside their son in El Cerrito, California.

Farming at the facility did not become a significant enterprise here until the turn of the 20th century. Before then the prisoners maintained a vegetable garden within the walls, and they raised sixty-five hogs. The state bought of land in 1904 for farming operations and built a hog house and a stone barn, both are no longer extant. Minimum security prisoners did the farm work. The historic buildings were built between 1912 and 1939. They are all stone structures built in a simplified Romanesque Revival style. The influence of the style is found in the \\"heavy massing, texture of the stone, and the window, door, and corner treatments.\\" The buildings were built for the following uses: South barn (1912, 1926 addition), barn granary (1915), root cellar (1919), North barn (c. 1919), slaughter house (1921-1922), processing plant (1922), and the seed house, dining hall, cold frame (1939). By 1917, prisoners were farming of state lands and of leased lands. The products produced by the farms increased to include vegetables, animal feed, poultry, eggs, fruit, milk, and milk products for the prison. By 1930, the state had bought most of the land it farmed and operated six prison farms. A barn was converted into a cheese factory in 1931. The full operation continued into the 1970s when the slaughtering operation was discontinued, and the livestock herds were reduced. It also became more economical to buy vegetables rather than grow their own. Agricultural production began to increase again in the 1990s.

He had a varied career including stints as a postmaster, grazier, railway worker, miner, construction worker, hotel keeper and car dealer.  Politics  Longeran won the 1957 Queensland state election (held on 3 August 1957) in Flinders as a member of the Country/National Party, defeating the sitting Labor member Frank Forde (a former Prime Minister of Australia) by one vote. Forde contested the result, arguing that some votes had been wrongly disallowed. The judge of the electoral tribunal declared the election void on 4 March 1958. Longeran was returned at a by-election held on 17 May 1958 in which Longeran defeated Forde by over 400 votes. Longeran served as Government Whip from 1971 to 1972. On 2 August 1972, he was elected Speaker of the Queensland Legislative Assembly against the wishes of the then Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen; Longeran is alleged to have contested the position because he believed that North Queensland was not adequately represented in the Bjelke- Petersen Ministry. Longeran represented Flinders until 1974. On 10 October 1974 he had a heart attack while crossing Alice Street between Parliament House and the former Bellevue Hotel.

Due to the overall tribal movements toward the western direction under pressure of encroaching settlers, the Sioux Nation resisted and came into conflict with other tribes moving west into their traditional territory. The United States negotiated the treaty to try to reduce inter-tribal warfare. The treaty begins by establishing peace between the Sioux and their neighbors: Chippewa, Sac and Fox, and Ioway peoples. The treaty continues by demarcating formal boundaries among each of the tribal groups, often called the \\"Prairie du Chien Line\\". The treaty claimed American sovereignty over the territories. For peoples accustomed to ranging over a wide area, the Prairie du Chien Line served as a hindrance, as it provided that tribes were to hunt only within their acknowledged limits. Due to the vast scope of the Treaty of Prairie du Chien and the fact that not all of the necessary tribes had representatives at its signing, the treaty provided for additional councils to be held the following year in 1826 (see Treaty of Fond du Lac). Along with these additional councils, the Chippewa agreed to additional meetings. The US used the series of Prairie du Chien Lines to serve as the land cession boundaries in later treaties.

In 1941, he was contracted by the occupying Germans to work as a photographer and correspondent for the magazine Signal, a propaganda organ of the German Wehrmacht. His photography was used to support a positive image of the German occupation in France, as well as to encourage French men to volunteer for the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism, a collaborationist French militia serving on the Eastern Front. It is disputed whether or not Zucca's work for the Germans was linked to any ideological sympathies with Nazism, and some have argued he was a right-wing anarchist. Paris newsstand selling copies of Signal magazine, August 1941 In addition to his contributions to Signal, he was one of the few photographers in occupied- Europe with access to Agfacolor film, a rare and expensive piece of color film at the time, thanks to his close relationship with the Germans. He is most well known today for his color photographs of daily life in Paris under German occupation. His son Pierre, (fr) a film director, was born in 1943. Following the liberation, he was placed on trial in October 1944 by the French Provisional Government in the √©puration l√©gale (legal purge), where his journalistic privileges were permanently revoked. The court ruled that no further legal action should be taken against Zucca, largely thanks to the credentials of a resistance member who spoke out on his behalf. With his journalism career in shambles, Zucca assumed the name Andr√© Piernic and settled in the French commune of Dreux, where he opened a small photo boutique, taking wedding and communion photos. He died in 1973. His photo collections were purchased by the Biblioth√®que historique de la ville de Paris in 1986, consisting primarily of his photos of occupied Paris taken during World War II. In 2008, √âditions Gallimard, a major French publishing house, worked with the city of Paris to organize an exhibition of Zucca's wartime photographs. The exhibition attracted a great deal of controversy for its portrayal of a seemingly-carefree, wartime Paris.

The Alliance for Civic Oversight of Supreme Court Justice Nominees approved of Hsu's selection, as did the New Power Party. Subsequently, the Legislative Yuan voted 72-2 for him to assume the post and for Tsai Jeong-duen to be the Vice President. Hsu was inaugurated as the President of the Judicial Yuan on 1 November 2016 in a ceremony attended by Vice President Chen Chien-jen.

Wasaga was armed with a single quick-firing (QF) /40 caliber Mk IV gun mounted forward. This was later replaced with a 12-pounder () 12 cwt HA gun.Macpherson (1997), p. 19 For anti-aircraft purposes, the minesweeper was equipped with one QF 2-pounder Mark VIII and two single-mounted QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns. The 2-pounder gun was later replaced with a powered twin 20 mm Oerlikon mount. As a convoy escort, Wasaga was deployed with 40 depth charges launched from two depth charge throwers and four chutes. Operational history The minesweeper was ordered as part of the 1939‚Äì40 building programme. The ship's keel was laid down on 3 September 1940 by Burrard Dry Dock Co, Ltd. at their yard in Vancouver. Named for a town in Ontario, Wasaga was launched on 23 January 1941 and commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 1 July 1941 at Vancouver.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 176 The ship was sent to the East Coast of Canada following commissioning, arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 10 September 1941. The minesweeper was sent to Bermuda for workups and upon returning to Halifax, was assigned to the local convoy escort and patrol unit, Halifax Force. In March 1942 Wasaga joined Newfoundland Force, the patrol and convoy escort force operating out of St. John's, Newfoundland. In January 1944, Wasaga transferred to Sydney Force, the local escort and patrol force operating out of Sydney, Nova Scotia and remained with them for a month before sailing to Europe in February. Upon arrival at Plymouth in March, Wasaga was assigned to 32nd Minesweeping Flotilla for minesweeping duties associated with the invasion of Normandy. The minesweeper later transferred to the all-Canadian 31st Minesweeping Flotilla. During the invasion, Wasaga and her fellow minesweepers swept and marked channels through the German minefields leading into the invasion beaches in the American sector.Schull, pp. 233‚Äì34 The 31st Minesweeping Flotilla swept channel 3 on 6 June, completing the task unmolested by the Germans.Schull, pp. 270‚Äì73 Wasaga remained with the unit until 30 September 1944, when the minesweeper returned to Canada for a refit at Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Wasaga returned to European waters on 4 February 1945 and rejoined the 31st Minesweeping Flotilla at Plymouth. On 11 April, the minesweeper was damaged in a collision and was forced to withdraw from Allied attacks in the Gironde estuary region.Schull, p. 396 The 31st Minesweeping Flotilla spent the final months of the war sweeping the English Channel.Douglas et al., p. 337 Wasaga returned to Canada in September 1945 and was paid off at Halifax on 6 October 1945.

The work was first performed by the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Leonard Bernstein at Carnegie Hall on April 16, 1959. Composition=Structure The Symphony No. 3 has a duration of roughly 24 minutes and is cast in five movements: #Passacaglia #Allegro molto vivace #Largo #Andante #Allegro molto The movements were not composed in chronological order; Rorem wrote the \\"Allegro molto vivace\\" first, the \\"Pasacaglia\\" second, the \\"Andante\\" third, the \\"Largo\\" fourth, and the \\"Allegro molto\\" last. Rorem called the first movement \\"a slow overture in the grand style.\\" The second movement, which the composer described as \\"a brisk and jazzy dance,\\" had originally been composed as a piece for two pianos eight years prior. Rorem described the third movements as \\"a short, passionate page about somnambulism, full of dynamic contrast, and coming from afar.\\" He called the fourth movement \\"a farewell to France\\" and described the fifth and final movement as a miniature Concerto for Orchestra. Instrumentation The work is scored for a large orchestra consisting of two flutes, piccolo, two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoon, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion, harp, celesta, piano, and strings. Reception Though rarely performed, the symphony has received praise from music critics. Andrew Farach-Colton of Gramophone praised the symphony, writing, \\"The first movement passacaglia is simply gorgeous ‚Äì listen beginning at 3'15\\" to hear how much Rorem gleaned from Ravel ‚Äì and the two adjacent slow movements are also exquisitely coloured. I find the manic, Bernstein-esque scherzo uncharacteristically coarse, though the finale more than makes up for it, providing exhilaration and plenty of orchestral razzle-dazzle without a trace of raucousness.\\" Reviewing a 2000 performance at the Curtis Institute of Music, Allan Kozinn of The New York Times similarly observed, \\"It is in some ways very much of its time, in that it embodies an updated form of Impressionism, filtered through an American urbanity, as well as stretches of jazzy theatricality in the style of Bernstein (who conducted this work's premiere) and even a trace of Copland's faux-Western accent.\\" He added, \\"It may also have been a manifesto of sorts, an assertive declaration that tonality and conventional structures still had something to say at a time when Serialism was ascendant. The work has not been heard very frequently, but today its tonal, eclectic personality is current again: tonality is now acceptable everywhere, and composers 40 years younger than Mr. Rorem (who is a young-looking 76) write music that makes similar allusions.\\" Kozinn also called it \\"a demanding work\\" and wrote, \\"Its dense, outgoing sections require power and assurance, and its more graceful slow movements require delicacy and a fine balance.\\" References Category:Compositions by Ned Rorem Category:1958 compositions Rorem 3 ","title":"Symphony No. 3 (Rorem)"},{"id":"52175696","text":"The Lorenz and Lugerde Ginthner House is a historic house in Wabasha, Minnesota, United States. It was built in 1882 in high Italianate style on a prominent corner lot. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 for having local significance in the theme of architecture. It was nominated for its elaborate Italianate architecture and status as the most intact and detailed example of the brick houses belonging to Wabasha's early merchant class. Description The Ginthner House is a brick building on a limestone foundation. The main section rises two stories, with two sections at the rear dropping to one-and-a-half and one story respectively. All three sections have shallow hip roofs. The front fa√ßade is spanned by an elaborate porch. The tall, rectangular windows are topped with limestone hoods decorated with an incised boss. False gables rise above the roofline on both street fa√ßades. Each is pierced with an oculus windows that permits light into the attic. The cornice is highly detailed with dentils and brackets. In the corners and under the gables the brackets extend farther down onto the walls. A one-story frame structure once protruded from the side of the rear section but has been removed. A kitchen porch and much of the ironwork were reconstructed in the 20th century based on an 1884 engraving of the house. Iron crests on the roof and porch were salvaged from an old hospital building in Menomonie, Wisconsin, and the fence was saved from a local cemetery. A detached garage at the rear of the lot is a modern addition and is not considered a historic asset. History Lorenz Ginthner (who also anglicized his name as \\"Lawrence\\") emigrated from Baden, Germany, in 1852 and settled in Wabasha three years later. He went into business as a tailor and merchant, manufacturing clothing on site as well as selling apparel shipped in by rail. He prospering quickly enough to have his own commercial building constructed in downtown Wabasha in 1867. His business continued to grow, requiring two additional tailors by the time he had this elaborate house built in 1882. The Ginthner House is an example of some 20 brick residences surviving from the 19th century in Wabasha. All were built by the first two generations of the city's merchant class, forming a distinctive architectural stock that contrasts with the elaborate wood-frame Victorian architecture that characterized most other communities in Minnesota. As time went on the choice of building material appears to have been a matter of local taste rather than accessibility, as Wabasha was not a major brick manufacturer compared to Lake City and Red Wing upriver.

His father was a prominent member of the Kiev bar. The family was modestly wealthy and cosmopolitan. Upon graduation from the First Kiev Gymnasium in 1902, Emanuel followed his older brother, Alexander (Shura), to the United States. He received a BA from Columbia University in 1903, and MA from Cornell in 1905, and a PhD from Cornell in 1907. His PhD thesis subject was ‚ÄúRussian Immigration to the U.S.‚Äù (Roughly two million Jews emigrated from Russia between 1880 and 1920; many came to the U.S.) He became a U.S. citizen in the same year. In 1916 he married for a second time, his first marriage, to the sister of the wife of his older brother, Shura, having ended in divorce in 1912. Pearl (Ann) Allen of Luray, Virginia, and Emanuel had two children, Margaret in 1917, and Alexander (Lex) in 1922. Dr. Goldenweiser‚Äôs first position after receiving his doctorate was as a researcher for the U.S. Immigration Commission. In 1910 he was hired as a special agent for the U.S. Census Bureau, and in 1914 he went to the office of farm management in the Department of Agriculture. In 1919, Goldenweiser was hired by the Federal Reserve Bank as an associate statistician. The newly established central bank had only opened for business in mid-November 1914. The Federal Reserve was to be his employer for the rest of his long career. He was appointed assistant director of research and statistics in 1925 and director in 1926. In 1945 he was appointed economic advisor to the Board of Governors from which position he retired in 1946. In his nearly twenty years as the director of research and statistics he had a major influence on the development of U.S. monetary and banking policies, often advising the administration, congress, and the banking community. His special expertise lay in the study of bank reserves and international flows of currency and gold. (Hence, along with his last name, the nickname of ‚ÄúGoldie‚Äù by which he was widely known.) From 1936 to 1945 he served as economic advisor to the Federal Open Market Committee. He created numerous series of economic statistics and developed new techniques to describe and manage the economy. The Glass Steagall bill was passed in 1935, based on testimony provided by Marriner Eccles, governor of the Federal Reserve Board, and Goldenweiser, ‚Äúhis able director of research‚Ä¶.with 15 years of experience with Federal Reserve facts, figures, problems, policies and action during good times and bad,‚Äù as noted in an August 20, 1935 article by Warren Persons. The good and bad times Dr. Persons refer to include the financial aftermath of WWI, the Great Depression, and the unusual capital flows into the U.S. preceding the entry of the U.S. into WWII. Following the war, Goldenweiser continued to have a prominent voice in on-going concerns regarding the great accumulation of gold in the U.S. before and during the war, dealing with inflation as a potential result of the gold accumulation, and the general stabilization of trade and money flows in the aftermath of the war. Goldenweiser fostered economic cooperation between the various agencies of government. In his obituary in The American Statistician, of June‚ÄìJuly, 1953, Woodlief Thomas says that, ‚Äú His contributions to cooperative efforts in coordinating Governmental statistical and economic research were almost continuous, including membership in the Central Statistical Board and other interdepartmental groups.‚Äù He played an active role in the development of the Bretton Woods Agreements and was a delegate to the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, making an important contribution to the establishment of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. He was a member of the International Institute of Statistics and a founding member and active participant in The Round Table, a group of about thirty prominent Washington thinkers who met every three weeks for thirty years. He served as President of the American Statistical Association in 1943 and the American Economic Association in 1946. In the July 1944 issue of The Southern Banker the editor observes that ‚ÄúDr. Goldenweiser for many years has borne the title of director of research and statistics but his voice carries greater weight than the voice of an ordinary statistician. His views in fact constitute the backlog of the board of governors‚Äô economic policies.‚Äù An article published in the June 1945 issue of Nation‚Äôs Business stated that, ‚ÄúMore perhaps than any other single person Dr. E.A. Goldenweiser influences Uncle Sam‚Äôs thinking and action on economic and financial matters.‚Äù Despite his significant influence on economic and financial issues facing the nation, Goldenweiser preferred to remain as inconspicuous as possible, a characteristic noted in a number of the tributes to his achievements in various publications at the time of his retirement. The Washington Post, in the January 13, 1946 issue, says that, ‚ÄúIt is unusual, however, to have contributed so much to public policy and to the minds and works of others over so long a span and retain the anonymity Dr. Goldenweiser has enjoyed‚Ä¶.he has succeeded, for the most part, in staying in the background‚Äîwhich is notable for one who has had a marked influence, who was born with wit and acquired wisdom and who is no shrinking Milquetoast.‚Äù After his retirement from the Federal Reserve, he became a member of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, New Jersey. He left the Institute in 1949 but continued to live in Princeton, consulting on monetary and economic policy to the Committee for Economic Development, among others, and writing, until his death on March 31, 1953. His publications include The Federal Reserve System in Operation, 1925 Jobs, 1945, in the series ‚ÄúPostwar Economic Studies‚Äù Federal Reserve Board Monetary Management in the United States, 1949 American Monetary Policy 1951 Numerous articles in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, the American Economic Review and other publications Many articles, files and other memoranda are in the custody of the Library of Congress under Acs. 10,808 II-39-F, 4-5 References: The American Statistician, June‚ÄìJuly 1953 Volume 7, No.3 ‚ÄúEmanuel A.

His side remained 3 years unbeaten with Taramai playing a key role in the side. This form earned him a trial with NRL side, the Penrith Panthers in 2011. Unfortunately for him, things didn't work out as well as expected in Australia and he returned home to New Zealand in 2012 and turned his attention to rugby sevens. Domestic Sevens career Upon returning to New Zealand in 2012 he began playing sevens rugby with Wellington and was a member of the side which lifted the national title in 2014. Senior career Taramai played one game for during their largely chaotic and ill-fated campaign in 2014. Unable to earn a contract in 2015, he headed north to join up with where he enjoyed a memorable debut season in 2016. He started all 12 matches as Harbour lifted the Mitre 10 Cup Championship and earned promotion to the Premiership ahead of the 2017 season. Super Rugby Taramai's immediate impact at Mitre 10 Cup level with North Harbour saw him swiftly receive attention from Auckland-based Super Rugby franchise, the , and he was named as a member of their squad for the 2017 Super Rugby season. International Taramai represented New Zealand at sevens level between 2014 and 2015, appearing at 4 tournaments in which he played 19 matches and scored 1 try.

Description The Dark Watchers are described as tall, sometimes giant-sized featureless dark silhouettes often adorned with brimmed hats or walking sticks. They are most often reported to be seen in the hours around twilight and dawn. They are said to motionlessly watch travelers from the horizon along the Santa Lucia Mountain Range. According to legend, no one has seen one up close and if someone were to approach them, they disappear. History While sometimes attributed to the Chumash people who historically inhabited the central and southern coastal regions of California, nothing analogous to the legend appears to exist in their mythology. When Spanish Settlers first moved into the area they were said to have witnessed the Dark Watchers whom they dubbed Los Vigilantes Oscuros. The Dark Watchers are most famously given a brief mention in John Steinbeck's \\"Flight\\", included in the 1938 collection of his short stories The Long Valley: Along with this, \\"watchers\\" are also referenced by poet Robinson Jeffers in the titular poem of his 1937 collection Such Counsels You Gave to Me & Other Poems: John Steinbeck's son Thomas Steinbeck would grow up to report having seen The Dark Watchers during his childhood and later along with artist Benjamin Brode collaborate on a book titled In Search of the Dark Watchers, where they go into the history of the legend and interview locals who claim to have seen them, such as famed Big Sur resident Billy Post. According to newspaper archives in the mid-1960s, a Monterery Peninsula local and former high school principal went on a hiking trip in the Santa Lucias when he suddenly spotted a dark figure standing on a rock and surveying the area. When the principal called out to the other hikers, the creature vanished. Explanations Illusions, hallucinations or misinterpretation of natural stimulus brought on by exhaustion or isolation have been proposed by psychologists.Reed, Graham. (1988). The Psychology of Anomalous Experience. Prometheus Books. pp. 44-45. Infrasound, which can be generated by wind, can cause feelings of uneasiness and anxiety in some people and is frequently connected to paranormal sightings. An optical illusion known as the Brocken spectre is a plausible explanation for the legend.Brown, Dave; Mitchell, Ian. (1987). Mountain Days and Bothy Nights. Luath. p. 157. A Brocken spectre, \\"mountain spectre\\" can occur in certain atmospheric conditions when the sun is at a particular angle. The subject's shadow can be cast onto a cloud bank around them, creating the illusion of a large shadowy humanoid figure.Ross, Helen. (1975). Mist, Murk and Visual Perception.

Excavated by Fred Wendorf, Romauld Schild, and Angela Close, Bir Kiseiba, along with Nabta Playa, has some of the earliest evidence for food production, permanent settlement, and more diverse technologies as compared to sites from the Late Pleistocene. Wendorf and associates argue that cattle and pottery were here as early as any other place in Africa, although this assertion has been challenged.  Archaeology  Most of the studies in the Bir Kiseiba region relate to the beginning of the Holocene when there was a wet period from about 11-10,000 BP until 5000 BP. There were two digging seasons at Bir Kiseiba, one in 1979 and the second in 1980. A total of 13 localities were excavated, scattered among four playas in the Bir Kiseiba region. Occupations from throughout the Early Holocene were studied; however, the most emphasis was put on earlier sites occupied before 6500 BP due to limited resources, the locations of many later sites along the margins of the basins, previous studies had already been done at the later sites, and only the earlier sites could provide data related to the appearance of cattle to the Sahara. The earliest known settlements in the area have been radiocarbon dated to between 9800 and 8900 BP. Artifacts from these settlements yielded the remains of cattle and also sherds of pottery with designs distantly related to the Early Khartoum styles. Faunal Remains Many faunal remains were found at each site and include turtles, lizards, frogs, birds, desert hedgehogs, hares, lesser gerbils, striped ground squirrels, elephants, dorcas gazelle, and large bovids that Wendorf and colleagues believed to be domestic cattle. The bovid remains were of particular interest. Taking into account the context in which these remains were found, the remains could be from wild cattle (Bos primigenius), domestic cattle (B. primigenius f. taurus), African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), or a giant buffalo species belonging to the genus Pelorovis. Unfortunately the specimens at Bir Kiseiba were not well preserved enough for comparative analysis. However, by referring to the size of the found remains, it is unlikely that the material comes from giant buffalo. The measurements do suggest that these animals were at least as large as wild cattle, but there is not enough information of the sexual dimorphism in size of these animals. Overall the size range of the bovid remains includes large domestic cattle and smaller wild cattle. Pottery During the Late Neolithic period (ca. 5100-4700 BC), smooth ceramic ware appeared at Bir Kiseiba, some of which was black-topped, similar to the characteristic ware of the early Predynastic period in the Nile Valley. Approximately 300 ceramic sherds were found at the sites at Bir Kiseiba. There were no whole or reconstructable vessels found at any site. The surface colors of the sherds ranged from reds, to dark reds, to yellow-reds, yellow-browns, dark browns, and gray-browns. The core colors varied from reds, red-browns, dark browns, and very dark gray- browns. The colors of the ceramics suggest that they were fired in oxidizing atmospheres. Most of the vessels seem to have been constructed using a coiling technique and many were decorated with various motifs, the most common being the Woven Mat motif. The assemblages found at Bir Kiseiba are very similar to the Middle Neolithic assemblages found at Nabta Playa, and both fall within the Khartoum Horizon Style of ceramics. There were 3 different techniques used to decorate the ceramics: impression, incision, and punctation. Impression was the most common, being used to produce several motifs. The most common motif consists of continuous impressions made with a square or rectangular-toothed comb, or possibly the serrated edge of a shell. This results in a motif that looks similar to basketry and is fittingly called Woven Mat. Settlements There are not enough data to make definitive statements about the early settlements that may have existed in the Bir Kiseiba region; however, Wendorf and colleagues do make some observations. The earliest Holocene settlement sites are currently thought to be temporary camps only occupied in the time after the region's summer rains but before the periods of aridity. This is when there would be enough vegetation available for grazing populations, such as cattle and gazelles. The consistency of cattle bones points toward these small sites being temporary herding camps, where small groups of people would let their cattle graze and possibly hunt the other grazing animals found in the area, such as gazelles and hares.  Controversy  Twenty two cattle bones were found in the Nabta Playa - Bir Kiseiba area. Excavators argue that these bones are from domesticated cattle, basing their claims on the reconstruction of the ecology showing conditions that were too poor to support large animals without human intervention, forming the basis of the Wendorf-Schild Model. Others have countered that an environment capable of sustaining gazelles and hares would have enough vegetation to support large animals like rhino and elephant, thus being able to support wild cattle as well. There is also no known ecological zone that contains only hares and gazelle, which suggests that faunal records of the area are fragmentary and incomplete. Measurements of the bones from Nabta Playa and Bir Kiseiba morphologically have fallen within the range of aurochs. Mitochondrial DNA has also done little to support the Wendorf-Schild Model beyond showing that the wild Bos primigenius could be the primary source for early domesticated cattle.

Managed by record producer Bobby Robinson, the group released a string of regional hits and scored one national R&B; hit with the song \\"Is It a Dream\\" in 1953. Highlighted by the distinctive vocal delivery of Joe Duncan, \\"Is It a Dream\\" became a standard component of several R&B; acts in Harlem and, briefly, the Vocaleers were among the most popular attractions of the city's music scene. History In 1952, the first version of the Vocaleers, featuring Joe Duncan (lead vocals), Herman Dunham (first tenor), William Walker (second tenor), Melvin Walton (baritone) and Teddy Williams (bass), came together after some of the members met each other while playing in a local Davega Stores-sponsored softball league. Originally known as the Rainbows, the group was managed by Jimmy Manning, a former gospel singer who performed with Brook Benton and Howard Lymon Sr. in the Harlemaires. The Rainbows' live appearances were initially limited to school assemblies, but they began receiving exposure at contests arranged at the Apollo Theater with Duncan's song \\"My Love\\". Late in 1952, in a record store on 116th Street, the Rainbows demoed another Duncan original, \\"Be True\\", with the manager accompanying them on ukelele. Impressed by the song, the manager delivered the demo to Bobby Robinson, who signed the Rainbows to a recording contract on Red Robin Records. In December 1952, the group, then known as the Vocaleers, recorded and released \\"Be True\\", paired with \\"Oh Where\\", for their debut single. It became a regional hit in cities such as New York City, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles, characterized by Duncan's unusual vocal delivery, which he explained in an interview: \\"I sing through my nose; I don't do it from the diaphragm.... I have a yo-yo funny voice\\". For a brief while, the group was the most popular act in Harlem; music writer Nelson George compared the Vocaleers' popularity in the district to sport figures Jackie Robinson and Willie Mays. As the single continued to sell well, the Vocaleers gigged at Lloyd's Manor in Newark, but were forced to replace Williams, who suffered from a case of stage fright followed by tuberculosis, with neighborhood friend Lamar Cooper. Awarding them with a new, lucrative five- year contract, Robinson assembled the Vocaleers back into the studio in March 1953 to record six additional songs. Among the set, \\"Is It a Dream\\" and \\"Hurry Home\\" were distributed as the Vocaleers follow-up single, which rose to number four on the Billboard R&B; charts in June. Soon, local doo wop groups incorporated \\"Is It a Dream\\" into their own repertoire, making it a standard of the doo wop music genre, and, with its good fortune, the Vocaleers were packaged in tours alongside other acts. Some of the groups/musicians the Vocaleers performed with include Dinah Washington, the Five Royales, Pigmeat Markham, and Arnett Cobb. Robinson called the group back to the studio to record \\"I Walk Alone\\" and \\"How Soon\\", much to the reluctance of Duncan, who feared the new record would take sales away from \\"Is It a Dream\\". When \\"I Walk Alone\\" was not too commercially successful, the group recorded their fourth single \\"Will You Be True\\" in December 1953, before Dunham announced he was leaving the Vocaleers, possibly over disputes with lead vocal duties. Replaced by Joe Powell, Dunham, adopting the stage name Herman Curtis, joined the Solitaires soon after. However, the Vocaleers did not survive long after Dunham's departure, with Walker and Walton leaving to form the Savoys in July 1954 and Duncan joining the military. Robinson, who still retained rights to the act's name, recorded one song, \\"If Your Heart Aches\\", with unknown session musicians. When Duncan returned from the service in late 1958, he reformed the Vocaleers with most of the original line-up. They recorded tunes for Old Town Records and Vest Records in 1959 and 1960 before disbanding for the last time in 1962. In recognition of their contributions to R&B; music, the Vocaleers were inducted into the UGHA Hall of Fame in April 1996.

Her sister also fled as well. Her mother, while alive, told Phymean how important an education was, despite education being banned during Pol Pot's regime. Noun was then left living alone and had to care for her 2-year-old niece. Noun continued her education while caring for her niece, and struggled to pay for her education. She earned $5 a month copying books at night. She went on to finish high school in 1989. Career and activism  Noun went to go find her sister in a refugee camp, and was offered a job with the UN. She eventually got another job an international NGO, and worked with the UN and said NGO for over 12 years. This changed when she was eating lunch one day and threw out her chicken bones, and some children ran to get them. She started a conversation with them, and they told her that they were poor and could not afford school. According to Noun, \\"I dreamed every night about if I can somehow help all those children that want to go to school just like other kids who have their parent‚Äôs support.\\" In 2002, she quit her job to do just that, and founded the People Improvement Organization (PIO). She sold her house and spent $30,000 of her own funds to found her first school at Phnom Penh's biggest trash dump, which is a source of child labor. At the garbage dump, the children risk their lives every day to pick garbage, and many are buried alive in the garbage pit or run over by garbage trucks. Noun's school lets them be able to get an education, food, healthcare, vocational training, and water. As of 2015, over a thousand children currently go to school there. She eventually wishes to expand PIO to other countries, and continue to support Cambodian children. Honors and awards In 2005, she was named a CNN Hero by CNN.

In 1874, Trask received her appointment to Foochow. In January 1875, the mission asked for US$5,000 to build a hospital and residence for Trask, which was appropriated by the General Executive Committee the following May. The hospital officially opened in 1877. At the close of the second year, Trask reported the number of patients registered as 1,208. After six years, she made a visit to the US in 1880 for a few months, and then returned to China.

Although it covers Yallop's career until that date, it focuses on the Australian summer of 1978-79 when Yallop led the Australian test team to a 5-1 defeat against England and a defeat against Pakistan. In the words of one writer, \\"On the very first page of Lambs To The Slaughter, his 1979 account of his captaincy nightmare, Yallop gallantly announced: \\"I should be bitter, but I am not.\\" He fooled nobody. The subsequent chapter headings - \\"Sacked\\", \\"The First Killing\\", \\"Skinned Alive\\", \\"Slaughtered\\" - gave the game away, hinting at the anger and hurt he must really have felt.\\" The book was written by Melbourne sports journalist Rod Nicholson at the end of the 1978-79 summer, just before Yallop was sacked as Australian captain in favour of Kim Hughes for the 1979 World Cup. In April 1979, a month prior to scheduled publication of the book, extracts of it were published in the Melbourne Herald where \\"Yallop\\" criticized the behavior of Australian fast bowler Rodney Hogg. Hogg became upset at some of the comments and complained. Yallop said he did not write the book, had not read the manuscript yet or given permission for extracts to be published. Yallop wanted the chapter on Hogg rewritten but the publisher, Outback Press, refused, saying the book was being printed and readied for sale in May. Yallop applied for an injunction in the Supreme Court of Victoria to stop the book being published. The parties ultimately settled out of court and publication of the book proceeded, unaltered. The Australian Cricket Board considered taking disciplinary action against Yallop but ultimately decided not to.

The fourteen treaties were all signed in the St. Louis, Missouri area. The land ceded to the United States in the 1804 treaty is shown here in yellow. The Treaty of St. Louis of 1804 was a treaty signed by William Henry Harrison for the United States and representatives of the Sauk and Meskwaki tribes led by Quashquame, signed on November 3, 1804, and proclaimed on February 21, 1805. Despite the name, the treaty was conducted at Portage des Sioux, Missouri, located immediately north of St. Louis, Missouri. In exchange for an annual payment of $1,000 in goods to be delivered to the tribe in St. Louis ($600 for the Sacs and $400 for the Fox), the tribes gave up a swath of land stretching from northeast Missouri through almost all of Illinois north of the Illinois River as well as a large section of southern Wisconsin. This treaty was deeply resented by the Sauk, especially Black Hawk, who felt that Quashquame was not authorized to sign treaties. This treaty led to many Sauk siding with the British during the War of 1812. The specific terms for the boundary were: :The general boundary line between the lands of the United States and of the said Indian tribes shall be as follows, to wit: Beginning at a point on the Missouri river opposite to the mouth of the Gasconade river; thence in a direct course so as to strike the river Jeffreon at the distance of thirty miles from its mouth, and down the said Jeffreon to the Mississippi, thence up the Mississippi to the mouth of the Ouisconsing river and up the same to a point which shall be thirty-six miles in a direct line from the mouth of the said river, thence by a direct line to the point where the Fox river (a branch of the Illinois) leaves the small lake called Sakaegan, thence down the Fox river to the Illinois river, and down the same to the Mississippi. And the said tribes, for and in consideration of the friendship and protection of the United States which is now extended to them, of the goods (to the value of two thousand two hundred and thirty-four dollars and fifty cents) which are now delivered, and of the annuity hereinafter stipulated to be paid, do hereby cede and relinquish forever to the United States, all the lands included within the above-described boundary.Treaty of St. Louis, 1804. Included in this cessation were the historic villages along the Rock River (Illinois), particularly Saukenuk. William Henry Harrison, the representative for the United States, was governor of the Indiana territory and of the District of Louisiana, superintendent of Indian Affairs for the said territory and district. The party of Sauk who signed the treaty, led by Quashquame, were not expecting to negotiate land and did not include important tribal leaders who would ordinarily have been in such negotiations. Black Hawk never recognized the treaty as valid and this led him to side with the British against settlers in the area during the War of 1812. The treaty was upheld again in the Treaties of Portage des Sioux in 1815 at the end of the war. Black Hawk eventually led the Black Hawk War to fight its terms. In his autobiography, Black Hawk recalled: :Quashquame, Pashepaho, Ouchequaka and Hashequarhiqua were sent by the Sacs to St. Louis to try and free a prisoner who had killed an American. The Sac tradition was to see if the Americans would release their friend. They were willing to pay for the person killed, thus covering the blood and satisfying the relations of the murdered man. :Upon return Quashquame and party came up and gave us the following account of their mission: :On our arrival at St. Louis we met our American father and explained to him our business, urging the release of our friend. The American chief told us he wanted land. We agreed to give him some on the west side of the Mississippi, likewise more on the Illinois side opposite Jeffreon. When the business was all arranged we expected to have our friend released to come home with us. About the time we were ready to start our brother was let out of the prison. He started and ran a short distance when he was SHOT DEAD! :This was all they could remember of what had been said and done. It subsequently appeared that they had been drunk the greater part of the time while at St. Louis. :This was all myself and nation knew of the treaty of 1804. It has since been explained to me.

The Treaty of St. Louis of 1816 was treaty signed by Ninian Edwards, William Clark, and Auguste Chouteau for the United States and representatives of the Council of Three Fires (united tribes of Ottawa, Ojibwa, and Potawatomi) residing on the Illinois and Milwaukee rivers, signed on August 24, 1816, and proclaimed on December 30, 1816. Despite the name, the treaty was conducted at Portage des Sioux, Missouri, located immediately north of St. Louis, Missouri. By signing the treaty, the tribes, their chiefs, and their warriors relinquished all right, claim, and title to land previously ceded to the United States by the Sac and Fox tribes on November 3, 1804 (see, Treaty of St. Louis (1804)), In the treaty, the united tribes also ceded a 20-mile strip of land to the United States, which connected Chicago and Lake Michigan with the Illinois River. In 1848, the Illinois and Michigan Canal was built on the ceded land and, in 1900, the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. The specific land given up included: In exchange the tribes were to be paid $1,000 in merchandise over 12 years.Treaty with the Ottawa, 1816 The land was surveyed by John C.

Martin was known for her work as a geological editor, lecturer and cartographer; her surface formation maps of glacial features in Michigan were used by Michigan industries in their mineral resource sector.She was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 1988 for her contributions to geology and her impact on women in science. Martin encouraged women to pursue science careers and wrote articles on the emergence of female educators in the 1930s. She promoted conservation education and helped create a conservation school for teachers in Higgins Lake, Michigan. Martin was a conservation chairperson of the National Council of State Garden Clubs for six years. For her efforts in conservation Martin received awards from U.S. Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare, the Public Health Service, the U.S. Forestry Service, and the American Forestry Association. In 1988 Martin was inducted into Michigan's Women's Hall of Fame.  Personal life  Martin was born in North Dakota in 1889, the daughter of Lawrence Mathew and Mary (Mandeville) Martin. Initially, she attended the University of Michigan to become a writer, but graduated in 1908 with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and geology. Martin then taught geology and physiography at a high school in Battle Creek, Michigan. In 1916, Martin returned to the University of Michigan to attain her master's degree in geology. She would spend most of her life in Michigan. After her retirement in 1958, Martin served as a chairperson in the national council of the State Garden clubs. She established a conservation school for teachers at Higgins Lake. Martin died in 1973.  Years at the University of Michigan  During a survey conducted by the University of Michigan in 1924, Martin said her fondest memories were during: ‚Äúthe old Country Fairs; our Junior Girls Play‚Ä¶ the suspense of the mid-year exams; my first ‚ÄòGrainers‚Äù; the star riot, and how the upstate papers exaggerated it; the dedication of Memorial Hall; the senior law parties; Michigamua, etc.; etc.; etc.... parties.‚Äù In this survey, Martin also expressed great admiration for University President, James B. Angell. She admired Angell‚Äôs affection and his incredible memory. Martin‚Äôs favorite moment with Angell was ‚Äúthe snowy winter morning when President Angell stopped me and called me by name- how did he ever know the name of obscure me.‚Äù  Career  After receiving her master's degree, Martin worked for several oil companies. She then became a state geologist in the Geological Survey Division of the Michigan Department of Conservation. Martin retired on December 1, 1958. Martin's research was focused on the conservation of natural resources in Michigan. Her work includes the compilation of the centennial geological map of Michigan in 1936 and the surface formation map of Michigan in 1955. These maps continue to help industry further mineral resource extraction in the state. Martin also conducted geological surveys of over 13 counties across Michigan.  Women in geology  Martin helped women enter the field of geology, which was historically a male-dominated science. She portrayed a crucial role in the conservation education and wrote of the emergence of female educators in the 1930s.  Awards and honors  Martin was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 1988. Martin was listed in Who's Who and Men in Science.

The Fareed Express (from Lahore to Karachi) was parked at the Landhi station when the Bahauddin Zakaria Express, which was traveling from Multan to Karachi, collided with the Fareed Express from behind, killing 21 people and injuring 65 people. Minister of Railways Khawaja Saad Rafique originally attributed the crash to the engineers of the Bahauddin Zakaria Express for failing to see both yellow and red signals earlier en-route, but Senator Saeed Ghani attributed the crash to a green signal being accidentally activated on the track the Bahauddin Zakaria Express was traveling on. Accident Witnesses described that Zakaria Express from Multan rammed into Fareed Express from Lahore, which was parked there, with the roar of the crash swiftly followed by the screams of people trapped inside. At least two carriages from the trains overturned due to the collision. TV footage showed the trains had suffered heavy damage. The train operation came to a complete halt after the accident. Two bogies of Fareed Express and one bogie of Zakaria Express were completely destroyed due to the collision. Adviser to Sindh Chief Minister on Labour Senator Saeed Ghani said that railway officials gave a green signal to the train coming from behind by mistake, and it went on to hit the train at rest. A factory worker Ajab Gul told to media that he was on his way to work when the accident occurred. ‚ÄúSuddenly another train came speeding in and smashed into the parked train. Drivers ignored signals Federal Minister for Railways Khawaja Saad Rafique pointed to the negligence of the driver and assistant driver of the train coming from behind as possible cause for the incident. He said the drivers were first shown a yellow signal ‚Äî an indication to slow down ‚Äî followed by a red signal, \\"the [standard operating procedure] of which is stop (the train) dead for a minute and then proceed very slowly\\". He said the drivers ignored both signals, which \\"apparently\\" led to the collision. Reactions Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited those injured in the train accident at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre. Zardari said there should be no politics on terrorism and accidents. Bilawal sympathised with families who had lost their loved ones. He also asked for the best medical treatment to be provided to the injured. He added there was not a single emergency centre in Pakistan and it would be the provincial government‚Äôs focus to build one in Sindh. Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah also paid a visit to the injured. Aftermath There were 16 dead bodies and 40 injured people taken to Jinnah Hospital, according to Dr. Seemi Jamali, head of the Emergency Department at Jinnah Hospital. The injured were transferred to Jinnah Hospital, Abbasi Shaheed Hospital and Civil Hospital, where an emergency was declared.
