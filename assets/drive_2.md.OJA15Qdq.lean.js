It is also recognised as the highest representative body of Muslims in the region, especially in Serbia (Sand≈æak), Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Hungary and Bosniak diaspora. The current leader is Husein Kavazoviƒá.  History  The Islamic Community was established in 1882 during the Austrian-Hungarian rule over Bosnia and Herzegovina. After creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the seat of the Islamic Community was moved from Sarajevo to Belgrade but was moved back to Sarajevo in 1936. During the breakup of Yugoslavia, the organized community on Yugoslav level broke up, while the majority of local and regional Muslim communities accepted the historic authority of the Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina . The Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina was initially weak, but with the help from Alija Izetbegoviƒá, Bosnia and Herzegovina's president, as well as key military leaders, it became a pillar of the Bosniak national identity. Under tenure of the Grand Mufti Mustafa Ceriƒá, who held this office from April 1993 until November 2012, the Islamic Community promoted Bosniak culture, politics and identity, with its influence extending beyond the faithful and attracting many who were not practicing Muslims during the socialist period, as well as Bosniaks and other Slavic Muslims living in the region of Sand≈æak and elsewhere.

The Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina has jurisdiction over the entire Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as Croatia through muftiluk of Zagreb, headed by Aziz Hasanoviƒá, Slovenia and Bosniak religious communities and mosques around the world. However, there is a dispute in Serbia over what Islamic Community has jurisdiction over the country, Bosnian or Serbian. Sand≈æak Mufti Muamer Zukorliƒá, who is supported by the ex-Grand Mufti Mustafa Ceriƒá, wants that they remain under the jurisdiction of the Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while Grand Mufti Adem Zilkiƒá wants to expand the jurisdiction of the Islamic Community of Serbia to the entire country. He was supported by the deceased Grand Mufti of Yugoslavia Hamdija Jusufspahiƒá, and later by Hamdija's son Muhamed.http://sandzakpress.net/dinastija-jusufspahica Islamic Community of Montenegro, although not formally under jurisdiction of Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina, recognizes Grand Mufti of Bosnia and Herzegovina as the highest religious and moral authority of Muslims in the region. The highest body of Muslims in Hungary, Hungarian Islamic Council, have expressed willingness to become part of Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina and for Grand Mufti of Bosnia and Herzegovina to act as supreme religious authority for Hungarian Muslims.

The movie was a flop at the box office.http://cinematoday2.itgo.com/Ninaikkatha%20Naalillai.htm The film released on 4 March 2001. Plot Anbu (R. Parthiban) and Arun (Rahman) are bosom buddies with Anbu being indebted to the wealthy Arun for various reasons. Anbu falls in love with Kavitha (Devayani), whose close friend is Kausalya (Kaveri). Arun soon develops a soft corner for Kausalya, whom he had never seen. Her lofty thoughts expressed in her letters to Kavitha had attracted him to her. Kausalya reads his messages to her sent through Kavita's letters and finds herself reciprocating to Arun's feelings. Arun has a near fatal accident and expresses his last wish to see Kavita. Anbu goes to get her, only to find her killed at the hands of the jealous suitor (Prabhukanth). With no way out, Anbu persuades Kavitha to play Kausalya so that his friend's final wish can be fulfilled. However, Arun comes out of the ordeal miraculously alive, and Kavita finds herself trapped in a situation that causes her much heartburn. How the matter is resolved with both the friends trying to play martyr forms the rest of the story. Cast *R.

Review Parthiban depicts impressively the character of the friend who puts friendship above love and suffers the consequences in silence. Devayani brings out the helplessness of the character effectively. Some of Vadivelu's comic escapades can be enjoyed. With the two hero subjects being the order of the day it is not surprising that most of the recently released films, have either a love triangle or friendship & sacrifice as its base. Ninaikkatha Naalillai has both the love triangle and friendship factors weaved in. Neatly crafted in the first half, the film lags a little in the second, and picks up pace in the closing scenes.

To the north, a broad plateau overlooks the valley of the River Axe and separates the region from the Yeovil Scarplands. To the east are the chalk hills of the Dorset Downs and Cranborne Chase, and the coastal strip of the Weymouth Lowlands, and, to the west, the Greensand transitions into the Blackdowns. Lastly, to the south is Lyme Bay on the English Channel where the coastline is characterised by slumped, mobile cliffs, prominent headlands like Golden Cap, and hidden valleys. The major watercourses of the region are the River Brit and the River Char.NCA: 139 Marshwood & Powerstock Vales - Key Facts & Data at www.naturalengland.org.uk. Accessed on 6 Apr 2013.

In the EU there is a producer code regulated by law since 2004. It allows consumers to distinguish free range eggs and organic farming eggs from the industrial caged hen production.  Egg mark contents  An egg mark may contain a number of information parts - in the EU only the producer code is required. Additional information may be printed along with the date of production being the most common to find. Other information may contain the method of production especially in the non-EU world where the numbered levels do not apply. Note that egg labelling is used worldwide but mostly in the form of egg carton labels. In most countries there are legal definitions on the designation of the egg size, production method, packager identification and best-before dates. As there is more space on the carton there has been no tendency to create an egg code that is seen on the stamps used for egg marking.  Producer code  German organic eggs with only the EU egg code The European Union has defined an egg code that consists of * a number indicating the method of production * a two letter code for the country of origin * a registration number indicating the hen laying establishment The egg stamp is required in the EU on all class A eggs unless these are sold directly on the farm.  Method of production  The first number of the egg code defines four methods of hens raising: : 0 = organic egg production : 1 = free-range eggs : 2 = deep litter indoor housing : 3 = cage farming Each raising method has different requirements defined. In the European Union these levels have strict minimum requirements: * caged: this had a requirement of 550 cm¬≤ minimum space per hen. However the EU has banned battery cages by 2012 through an update of EC Directive 1999/74/EC. The new minimum is 750 cm¬≤ in furnished cages. * indoor: the minimum space per hen is increased to 1100 cm¬≤ (or 9 hens per square meter). No cages are allowed and instead the hens may sit on an elevated porch in large barn that has a floor covered with sawdust or better. * free-range: in addition to the barn (with 1100 cm¬≤ indoor space per hen) there must be an outdoor space for the hens with continuous daytime access. There is a minimum of 4 m¬≤ of outdoor space per hen. * organic: the indoor space is increased to 1667 cm¬≤ (or 6 hens per square meter); the available outdoor space has a minimum of 4 m¬≤ with grown pasture for the poultry, and the remaining food must come from organic production. Some countries had banned battery cages before the EU regulation was enacted, for example in Austria by 2009 and in Germany by 2010. A number of countries have later adopted regulations to completely ban cage farming (including the furnished cage option), for example Switzerland, Germany and the UK with a transition period to 2025.  Country code  The country code follows the ISO two- letter country codes (also known from country code top-level domains). This includes { width = \\"100%\\" - valign = \\"top\\"  * AT = Austria * BE = Belgium * BG = Bulgaria * CY = Cyprus * CZ = Czech Republic * DE = Germany * DK = Denmark  * EE = Estonia * ES = Spain * FI = Finland * FR = France * EL = Greece * HR = Croatia * HU = Hungary  * IE = Ireland * IT = Italy * LT = Lithuania * LU = Luxembourg * LV = Latvia * MT = Malta * NL = Netherlands  * PL = Poland * PT = Portugal * RO = Romania * SE = Sweden * SI = Slovenia * SK = Slovakia * UK = United Kingdom }  Registration number  In most countries the registration number starts with a region code where the egg production facilities are situated: * Germany - 01 Schleswig-Holstein, 02 Hamburg, 03 Lower Saxony, 04 Bremen, 05 North Rhine-Westphalia, 06 Hesse, 07 Rhineland-Palatinate, 08 Baden-W√ºrttemberg, 09 Bavaria, 11 Berlin, 12 Brandenburg, 13 Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, 14 Saxony, 15 Saxony-Anhalt, 16 Thuringia * Austria - 1 Burgenland, 2 Carinthia, 3 Lower Austria, 4 Upper Austria, 5 Salzburg, 6 Styria, 7 Tyrol, 8 Vorarlberg, 9 Vienna Note that a producer with multiple barns will have to register each barn separately.  Criticism  Amount of m¬≤ per 13 hens There have been multiple occurrences of the producer code being forged - a common concept is to have multiple barns on the same farm with some having efficient caged hen production and one with an organic egg production code. Eggs are then silently moved to the other barn giving an egg code as if they were from organic production allowing for a higher price on the market. In Lower Saxony (Germany) the state attorney has accused 150 farmers in a year. The mark on organic egg production as level 0 might indicate that there is nothing better than that. However it does not indicate sustainable agriculture where hens are fed from the organic farm alone. Also species-appropriate husbandry would require more space per hen or a lower number of hens per barn (or even have a cock around to calm down quarrels). Instead there are higher organic farming standards (e.g. Demeter or Bioland) that can not be expressed in the established egg code system. The difference in space per animal is limited between levels 1 and 0. Also, egg marking does not say anything about other conditions of hens' raising that have been criticized by animal advocates, like the mass killing of male chicks or the painful trimming of hens' beaks.

It is a form of private placement. A SEDA offers a relatively flexible way of raising capital, allowing companies to further customize their approach to capital and risk management. In a sense, SEDA is similar to a line of credit extended by a lender, except that the financing is done not through debt but through equity. In a SEDA contract, a publicly traded company arranges to raise additional capital by selling new stock without making a public seasoned equity offering. A financial entity agrees to privately purchase a defined maximum of shares to be offered in specified lots (tranches) over a specified period. The purchaser gets the stock at a discount to the current market price (often 5 percent) and the SEDA usually specifies a maximum stock price which the purchaser agrees to pay. If the company finds that it never needs more funds, it can elect not to sell any shares at all, or to sell only a part of the maximum. The timing of sales is under the control of the company, so it can sell when it believes its share price is high. The SEDA allocation increases the number of the company's shares outstanding and its total shareholders' equity, while diluting the equity of the existing shareholders.

He claimed to be able to materialize spirits, produce ectoplasm and levitate objects. Guzyk was endorsed by the psychical researcher Gustav Geley who attended his s√©ances. However, the skeptical investigator Paul Heuz√© and a professional illusionist known as Professor Dicksonn suspected that Geley and other psychical researchers had been duped by trickery. Heuz√© organized five scientists, including the French physicist Paul Langevin to observe Guzyk during his s√©ances. Objects were moved but only in close reach of the medium. They concluded that he had freed one of his legs to perform the phenomena. When tighter controls were introduced, nothing happened.Sofie Lachapelle. (2011).

Plot Kasi (Sathyaraj) is a womanizer leading a carefree life with his friend Chellappa (Vadivelu). Kasi meets Gayathri (Devayani) and mistakes her as a call girl but later realizes her true identity. This creates a bad impression in Gayathri for Kasi. Barath Kalyan is a rich man who falls in love with Gayathri and proposes to marry her. But Gayathri loves Kasi's friend Vishwa (Ranjith). Vishwa is employed with a rich businessman (Devan). Gayathri's brother wants her to marry Barath Kalyan but she does not agree and leaves the home with the hope of marrying Vishwa. Vishwa and Gayathri decide to get married in a register office. Kasi also accompanies them. But Vishwa gets a phone call from his boss and leaves immediately. Vishwa requests to postpone the wedding plan as he has to travel immediately to the US for some work related engagements. Kasi takes Gayathri to his home as she has no one to help. Kasi behaves in a gentle manner with Gayathri and a mutual respect develops between them. Vishwa does not contact Gayathri for a few days and this worries Kasi. It is revealed that Vishwa has plans to ditch Gayathri and marry his boss‚Äô daughter with thoughts of becoming rich. Kasi and Gayathri reach the wedding hall to cancel Vishwa's wedding.

This is a role written for Satyaraj and he is very good at what he does. Devyani too takes her role seriously and has put in a lot of effort. But Ranjith has nothing much to do. Vadivelu makes his presence known, and that too in a double role, but he is a bit irritating at times. The song sequences are eminently avoidable except perhaps the songs where the matinee idol MGR makes a brief appearance, thanks to graphics. There is nothing to write home about the music by Deva, while B. Kannan's camera work is functional. Except for these drawbacks, \\"Ennamma Kannu\\" is quite entertaining and enjoyable.\\" *Balaji Balasubramaniam of thiraipadam.com wrote, \\"The dialogues are sharp at many points and help move the story forward in spite of the familiar situations. Vadivelu also raises some chuckles with a double role (a policeman and a pimp) with lots of in-jokes about cops in other movies. The mix-up scenes are quite funny though not related to the story. The other strength of the movie is Satyaraj. After a really long time, he gets a role he can really sink his teeth into and relishes it. Devayani looks pale throughout but fits the bill as far as the role is concerned. Ranjith is adequate and Sarala gets to again indulge in her favorite activity of thrashing Vadivelu.\\" *Lolluexpress.com wrote, \\"Satyaraj did a OK job in this movie considering his previous movies in which he was irritating. It was nice to see Satyaraj in action. Ranjit was totally irritating. The movie runs with Satyaraj's usual lollu. Another Vadivelu Called \\"Telex Pandian\\" gets introduced as a Police officer and Sarala gets introduced as Vadivelu's wife. It was really funny when Vadivelu calls 'Kovai' Sarala as \\"Simran\\". Its worth only 40/100 that too for Satyaraj and Vadivelu's comedy.\\" *Chennaionline.com wrote, \\"The director has kept his narration fairly interesting most of the time and the film moves at a fast pace.

It is located in Galicia with its southeastern end reaching into the provinces of Zamora and Le√≥n of Castile and Le√≥n. Its highest point is Pena Trevinca at . Another important peak is Cabeza de Manzaneda (1,781 m). In traditional local folklore the forests of the Galician System are said to be inhabited by a variety of elves, fairies, ghosts, the Santa Compa√±a, the Nubeiro and witches (meigas). Geology Geomorphologically the Galician Massif is a northwestern prolongation of the Meseta Central, the inner Iberian plateau and has great affinity with the geology of the Tras os Montes Portuguese region, so that it is considered as a whole under the name 'Galicia-Tr√°s-os-Montes Zone'.Silurian graptolite biostratigraphy of the Galicia - Tras-os-Montes Zone (Spain and Portugal) It is composed of Paleozoic materials (granite) with metamorphic rocks such as gneiss, slate and schist in the center and west, which were subject to Alpine folding. Its eastern end merges with the Cantabrian Mountains.Wes Gibbons & Teresa Moreno, The geology of Spain. Geological Society of London, 2003 The relief of the system, with an average height of , is relatively smooth compared with other Iberian ranges. It is however very complex, having no defined structural alignment owing to the heavy fluvial erosion that has fragmented the terrain. Generally the system includes mountains that are rounded in shape, often topped by small rocky outcrops, as well as horsts, basins and faults, roughly aligned in a N-S direction. Vegetation Since rain is abundant in Galicia, the undisturbed areas of the massif have a soft soil texture and are covered in dense vegetation of temperate deciduous forest where Quercus petraea and Quercus robur oaks predominate.

Afr. (13 June 1884 ‚Äì 5 April 1962) was a Catholic priest who was Vicar Apostolic of the Apostolic Vicariate of Ruanda and then of the Apostolic Vicariate of Kabgayi. Early years Laurent- Fran√ßois D√©primoz was born on 13 June 1884 in Chindrieux, Savoy, France. He was the cousin of Joanny Th√©venoud, Vicar Apostolic of Ouagadougou. Deprimoz attended the college at Rumilly for his secondary education, then at the age of seventeen entered the seminary of the White Fathers at Binson. He took the habit at Maison-Carr√©e on 4 October 1903 and pursued his studies at Carthage, interrupted by military service, until being ordained a priest on 28 June 1908. D√©primoz was first assigned to the mission of Unyaneyembe in the Tabora Region of what is now Tanzania, but could not handle the climate. In 1909 he was transferred to the Buhonga mission, close to Lake Tanganyika, in the healthier mountains of Burundi. On 12 December 1912 the missions of Burundi were detached from the Apostolic Vicariate of Unyanyembe and were joined with those of Rwanda to form the new Apostolic Vicariate of Kivu, with John Joseph Hirth as the first Vicar Apostolic. D√©primoz met L√©on-Paul Classe in 1913 when Classe visited in his role as vicar delegate of the south of the Apostolic Vicariate of Kivu. In October 1915 D√©primoz became a teacher at the Junior Seminary at Kabgayi in Rwanda. On 26 November 1919 he was named Superior of the Junior Seminary. Later career D√©primoz left the country for leave in Europe on 13 September 1921. He returned to Rwanda on 7 September 1922 with L√©on-Paul Classe, who had been named the first Vicar Apostolic of the new Apostolic Vicariate of Ruanda. He was made superior of the junior seminary, and spiritual father of the major seminary. In 1927 he became inspector of schools in Rwanda. On 1 October 1930 he was released from the junior seminary and named the Vicar Delegate of Bishop Classe. On 8 September 1932 he was named Superior of the major \\"intervicarial\\" seminary of Kabgayi. On 9 July 1936 this seminary was officially transferred to Nyakibanda, and D√©primoz was confirmed in his position as rector. He was named Coadjutor Vicar Apostolic in January 1943. Bishop D√©primoz was appointed Titular Bishop of Mathara in Proconsulari and Coadjutor Vicar Apostolic of Ruanda on 12 January 1943. On 19 March 1943 he was ordained at Kabgayi. On 31 January 1945 he succeeded Classe as Vicar Apostolic of Ruanda. He inherited a difficult situation partly caused by missionaries who had been indiscriminate in baptizing people who were drawn to the church during the famine of 1933-35. He made changes to religious teaching practices and gave fresh emphasis to the sanctity of the Sabbath. In 1950, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Catholic Church in Rwanda, he held a synod to discuss completing the restoration of the church in preparation for transferring responsibility to African clergy with the separation of the Apostolic Vicariate of Nyundo. His greatest work was his reorganization of the catechumenate during the Synod of 1950. On 14 February 1952 the Apostolic Vicariate of Ruanda was divided into the Apostolic Vicariate of Kabgayi and Nyundo. D√©primoz was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Kabgayi. The new Vicariate of Nyundo was assigned to Mgr. Aloys Bigirumwami, whom D√©primoz ordained on 1 June 1952 during the feast of the Pentecost. D√©primoz was a strong promoter of the Catholic press, pushing up the circulation of the Kinyamateka, and supporting the launch of the Hobe magazine for young readers in Christmas 1954. D√©primoz became ill, and resigned his duties on 15 April 1955. After a stay in Europe, in 1958 he returned to Rwanda and settled at Astrida (Butare). He died on 5 April 1962.¬® References Citations Sources  Category:1884 births Category:1962 deaths Category:People from Savoie Category:Rwandan Roman Catholic bishops Category:White Fathers priests Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops ","title":"Laurent-Fran√ßois D√©primoz"},{"id":"39031180","text":"Events from the year 1959 in Scotland.

The music was composed by Shamanth. The film was released on 22 March 2013 and centers upon a young man who rethinks his life after his father attempts suicide. The film was filmed in Chennai and Singapore, with most of the filming taking place in Singapore. Plot Mahesh (Mirchi Senthil) is an unemployed man living in Thiruvarur who enjoys hanging out with his friends. His father (Livingston) is unhappy with his son's irresponsible lifestyle and attempts suicide. Mahesh then begins to search for a job, and with the help of his friend Appukutty (Aadukalam Murugadoss), finds a job in Singapore. He meets Janani (Iniya), who is a Singapore citizen, and attempts to marry her in order to obtain citizenship. However, the truth is that Janani is not a Singapore citizen.

Saravana Kumar, who reacted to the review of Udhav Naig from The Hindu said that it was a \\"classic example of how easily things can go wrong in a film, when two producers, who have largely ignored the need to research their subject matter, come together. The review came within hours of the movie was released. However there is no proof for Udhav Naig's statement that the writer has largely ignored the research . The Singapore talent adoption history shows that they are continuously on the lookout for talent from overseas.

Her body has never been found. Ian Simms, a local pub landlord, was charged with and convicted of her murder. The case is a rare example where a murder conviction has been obtained without the presence of a body, and was one of the first in the UK to use DNA fingerprinting. In 2015, Helen McCourt's mother, Marie, began a campaign to change the law regarding the conviction of killers such as Simms, requiring them to reveal the whereabouts of their victim's remains before being considered for parole. The campaign led to the announcement of plans to introduce a \\"Helen's Law\\" in May 2019. On 5 July 2019, David Gauke, the Secretary of State for Justice confirmed the law would be adopted in England and Wales. A Parole Board hearing on 8 November recommended Simms for release, the decision coming before the legislation could be introduced. The McCourt family launched a bid to keep Simms in jail but it was rejected by the High Court in February 2020, and Simms was subsequently released on licence. Background Helen McCourt spoke with her mother Marie by telephone before 4:00 pm on 9 February 1988, shortly before she was due to leave work. She was planning to go out for the evening with her new boyfriend and wanted her tea ready earlier so she had time to wash her hair. Two days before her disappearance, Helen had been involved in a heated argument with a woman in a pub called the George and Dragon (now the Billinge Arms). The landlord was Ian Simms, who was aged 31 at the time and married with two small children. After the argument, Simms had banned Helen from the pub and, according to several customers, had used obscene language about her and said how much he \\"hated\\" her. He had made sexual advances to Helen which she had rejected, and also believed Helen knew about his affair with his 21-year-old mistress and was gossiping about it. Helen alighted from her bus around 5:30 pm and set off on the short journey home, a route that took her past the pub. Within minutes, a man getting off another bus heard a loud scream coming from the pub that was cut short. Helen has never been seen or heard from since that night. Evidence While being questioned by police, Simms came under suspicion when he became extremely nervous. His car was impounded, and forensic scientists found traces of Helen's blood: spots of blood on the rubber sill of the boot and a bloodstain on the boot carpet. In the boot they also found an opal and pearl earring, later identified by Marie as one of a pair Helen had been given for her 21st birthday; she had been wearing the earrings on the day she vanished. Traces of her blood were also found in Simms' flat: on the carpet at the foot of the stairs leading to his apartment, on a bedroom carpet in his flat, on wallpaper in the bedroom, and splashed on wallpaper next to the outside door to Simms' accommodation, where police believe she was first attacked. In March, Helen's handbag, taupe coat, maroon scarf, navy trousers, and green mittens were found on a riverbank in Irlam, about twenty miles away, in a black binliner proved to have been taken from a roll of them in Simms' pub. Fibres from trousers Helen wore for the first time on the morning of her disappearance were found on the stair carpet, landing carpet, and bedroom carpet of Simms' flat, indicating she was dragged upstairs after being attacked by him. A witness working in the pub's restaurant testified she heard dragging noises from above her during the time of the presumed murder. Also found with her clothing was a length of electrical flex. This was similar to other lengths of flex found in Simms' flat, which he used in playing with his two dogs. The flex found at Irlam had dog toothmarks on it that were matched to Simms' dogs; it also had strands of human hair adhering to it that were matched to hairs from Helen's hair rollers. Police believe the flex was used to strangle her. A man also came forward to say that, on the morning after Helen's disappearance, he had discovered a blood-stained towel while walking his dog along the Manchester Ship Canal in Hollins Green, Warrington. He later discovered a second towel along with several items of men's clothing, which also had blood on them; the blood was later identified as coming from Helen. The jumper had the logo for Labatt, a brand of beer popular at the George and Dragon pub. After first denying it, Simms later admitted these were his clothes. Trial At his trial in 1989, Simms denied murdering Helen, claiming that someone must have got into his flat, stolen his clothes and dressed in them, and attacked and murdered her without his knowledge. This person had then used his car to dispose of her body and then left his clothes where they would be found to incriminate him. The jury did not believe him and convicted him of the murder. Simms was one of the first persons to be convicted on DNA evidence without the victim's body having been discovered. In the absence of Helen's body, forensic scientists used a new technique, using blood samples from her parents to compare with the blood found in Simms' apartment, on his clothes and in the boot of his car. The odds were many thousands to one that the blood was not from a child of Helen's parents. In 1999 Simms challenged the findings of the DNA evidence that linked him to the crime, despite improved DNA technology that now suggested the odds against the blood not being Helen's were nine million to one. Simms was given a life sentence with a minimum tariff of sixteen years. He has never revealed where he put Helen's body, which is also one of the reasons that all of his appeals for release have been denied. Despite the evidence Simms has always maintained his innocence. Aftermath Since her daughter's disappearance, Marie McCourt has devoted herself to work for Support after Murder and Manslaughter (SAMM), and still puts pressure on Simms to reveal the location of Helen's body. Marie has been lobbying the department of the Lord Chancellor to have him charged with preventing a burial. Marie also commented, \\"I will never give up my search for Helen and every day I pray that she is found.\\" In July 2008, a marble bench was placed in the grounds of St Mary's church in Billinge to mark Helen's 43rd birthday and to honour her memory. In February 2013, a memorial Mass for Helen was held on the 25th anniversary of her disappearance. On 16 October 2013, police exhumed a grave behind St Aidan's Church in Billinge after receiving a tip-off that Helen's body had been placed inside an open grave ahead of a burial at the church in February 1988. The exhumation showed that Helen's body had not been placed there. Simms has never disclosed the whereabouts of Helen's body. In December 2015, Marie launched a campaign calling for a change in the law that would prevent convicted murderers who refuse to reveal the location of bodies of victims from being released on parole. Simms was allowed out of prison on temporary release in March 2019. At the time Marie McCourt spoke of how she was \\"angry\\" that her daughter's killer had been allowed out of prison. In May 2019, the UK's Ministry of Justice announced plans to change the law regarding parole to place \\"greater consideration on failure to disclose the location of a victim's remains\\". In such cases as that of the murder of Helen McCourt, where a conviction is secured without the presence of a body, Helen's Law would require a person convicted of murder to reveal the location of their victim's remains before being considered for parole. On 5 July 2019, Secretary of State for Justice David Gauke confirmed the law would be adopted in England and Wales. On 21 November 2019, before the law could be adopted, it was reported that a Parole Board review on 8 November had recommended Simms for release, finding that he had \\"met the terms for release\\". The bill to introduce Helen's Law had been in the process of being debated by parliament when parliament was dissolved ahead of the 2019 general election. On discovering that her daughter's killer would be released, Marie McCourt urged the next government to introduce Helen's Law. In February 2020, the McCourt family's bid to keep Simms in jail was refused by the High Court, and Simms was released on licence.

He also served during the Alabama Constitutional Convention of 1861 that preceded the American Civil War. Williamson was killed in 1862, during the Battle of Glendale in Henrico County, Virginia. He was serving as a captain in the 14th Regiment Alabama Infantry. The house has remained the property of Williamson descendants since it was built. It was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on September 12, 1988 and to the National Register of Historic Places on January 5, 1989, due to its architectural significance.

In a racing career which lasted from February 2007 until January 2014 he won two hurdle races and six steeplechases from forty-seven starts. Background Auroras Encore is a bay gelding bred in Ireland by the Mountarmstrong Stud. His sire Second Empire won the Grand Crit√©rium in 1997 and started second favourite for the following year's Epsom Derby. The best of his offspring to date has probably been the Victor Chandler Chase winner Somersby. Auroras Encore was offered for sale at the Tattersalls Ireland sale in September 2003 where he was bought for ‚Ç¨7,000 by Frank Barry. Two years later the gelding was auctioned at Doncaster and was sold for 9,500 guineas to Harvey Smith the husband of the trainer Sue Smith. Auroras Encore then entered the ownership of Alicia Skene and was sent into training with Sue Smith at High Eldwick, near Baildon in West Yorkshire. Racing career Auroras Encore began his racing career in early 2007 when he finished second in National Hunt flat races at Market Rasen and Sedgefield. In the 2007/2008 National Hunt season he ran ten times, recording his first victory in a Novice Hurdle at Sedgefield in December. In April 2008 he recorded his first major victory when winning a handicap hurdle at the Grand National meeting at Aintree Racecourse. Auroras Encore was campaigned in steeplechases in the following season and won three of his nine races. He won novice steeplechases at Sedgefield in December Carlisle in March and Ayr in April. In the 2009/2010 National Hunt season, Auroras Encore was beaten in his first six races before ending the season with a win in a handicap chase at Uttoxeter Racecourse. After two defeats in November 2010, Auroras Encore was off the course for more than a year before returning as a ten-year-old in January 2012. He won a handicap chase at Haydock Park in April and then finished second to Merigo in the Scottish Grand National. Auroras Encore finished no better than fourth in his first five races of the 2012/2013 season before taking part in the Grand National at Aintree on 6 April. Starting at odds of 66/1 he won the race by nine lengths from Cappa Bleu and Teaforthree. His jockey Ryan Mania, 23, was having his first ride in the race. On 20 April Auroras Encore attempted to become the first horse since Red Rum to win the Grand National and the Scottish Grand National. Carrying top weight of 164 pounds he started at odds of 14/1 and was pulled up on the final circuit. Auroras Encore began the next season at Wetherby in December where he finished last of the five finishers in the Rowland Meyrick Chase. On 25 January the gelding finished last, beaten more than sixty lengths, in the Great Yorkshire Chase at Doncaster. After the race, he was found to have sustained a fracture to his right foreleg and was retired from racing.

From the 16th century the abbey suffered due to the destruction associated with the French Wars of Religion and relaxed its discipline, although there were attempts to restore it in the 17th century by the monks of the Congregation of St. Maur. Only three monks remained living in the abbey in 1790. In the following year, the church and the monastic buildings were converted for the use of the parish. Part of the abbey was sold for a stone quarry and the chapter house became a stable. In 1854, a strong earthquake caused further destructions. Prosper M√©rim√©e took charge of its restoration in 1855.

In 1083 Raymond-Arnaud d'Arcizas and Raymond de Vieusac witnessed the gift of the tithes of Azos by Arnaud de Tors. In 1130 Pierre de Silhen and his sons gave the tithes of the church of Silhen to the abbey. In 1157 Arnaud d'Arcizas witnessed the gift made by Gailliarde d'Orout of lands in Uz to the abbey.

Design and development By 1947 Canadian glider pilots urgently needed a new intermediate performance glider for club use and cross-country flying. Concurrently the Loudon Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Toronto proposed that his 4th year students gain experience by building a glider. Waclaw Czerwinski and Beverley S. Shenstone designed a small glider for the students to build, which was completed within two years and flown for the first time on 5 November 1949. Construction of the Loudon was primarily of wood with fabric and plywood skinning, following contemporary standard practice of a shoulder set two piece wing immediately aft of the enclosed cockpit. The fuselage was built up from spruce frames and stringers with plywood covering incorporating the integral fin. The wing consisted of a single cantilever spar with a ply sandwich leading edge torque tube. Made up ribs forming the wing section aft of the spar and all control surface, were fabric covered. Controls were entirely conventional with ailerons near the wing-tips, tailplane with elevators at the base of the fin and a rudder hinged from the rear of the fin. Support on the ground consisted of a large nose skid under the nose extending from the nose back to a semi-recessed mainwheel, aft of the centre of gravity a steel sprung tailskid at the base of the fin and re-inforced wingtips. Flight testing of the Loudon was successful and an experimental type certificate was issued by the Canadian Department of Transport in November 1952, receiving the registration CF-ZBN-X.

Nicknamed the \\"Zambezi Hitman\\", at the time of his death Norgrove had an unbeaten professional record. His death occurred several days after he was taken ill during a boxing match in London, and marked the United Kingdom's first post-match boxing fatality of the 21st century. Norgrove's death reopened the debate as to the safety of boxing as a sport. Life and career Born in Kabwe, Norgrove was the son of a British expatriate who worked for Zambian Railways. The family left Zambia at the end of his father's contract when Norgrove was seven, and moved first to Australia, then later to Manchester in England. In boxing Norgrove competed at light-middleweight level, and entered the sport at a relatively late age. He was known as the \\"Zambesi Hitman\\". As an amateur he participated in white- collar fights before boxing at London's Repton Club in the East End. There he took part in the Amateur Boxing Association's Novice Championship, winning the London title, and competing nationally in 2009. He turned professional in 2010. He was also a contemporary and former sparring partner of the one time European super-middleweight champion James DeGale. Having successfully fought five bouts, he was taking part in his sixth fight (against Tom Bowen) when he was taken ill. It was his first professional fight following a two-year break. On 28 March 2013 he was competing at the historic Ring venue in Blackfriars, which was hosting its first professional boxing event for 73 years. During the fifth round of a six-round fight, referee Jeff Hinds noticed Norgrove acting strangely and stopped the bout. Norgrove subsequently collapsed, and was treated at the scene before being taken to the Royal London Hospital, where he underwent emergency brain surgery for a cerebral haemorrhage. He died nine days later on 6 April following complications. It was the first post-match death in British boxing to occur in the 21st Century, the last being Scottish bantamweight James Murray who died in 1995 from head injuries sustained during a fight in Glasgow. The result of Norgrove's final fight was recorded as \\"no contest\\", meaning he had an unbeaten record at the time of his death. Reaction to death Public interest in boxing had experienced an upsurge since the 2012 Summer Olympics when Britain won five medals in the sport, and the UK Government's funding body, UK Sport had increased the amount of finance allocated to it, but Norgrove's death reopened the debate over its safety. Peter McCabe, chief executive of Headway, a charity that supports people with brain injuries, called for it to be banned. \\"Every time a boxer gets into the ring, there is a significant risk that they may lose their life or sustain a devastating, life-changing brain injury [...] Until this sport is banned, more young lives will be tragically lost.\\" However, Robert Smith, general secretary of the British Boxing Board of Control defended the sport's safety procedures. \\"We are one of the strictest authorities in the world. This is an acute injury, this can happen any time. He had his medicals done, he had his brain scans done. There was nothing there of any concern whatsoever, else he wouldn't have been in the ring.\\" Monica Harris, herself a boxer, and a close friend of Norgrove's announced her intention to quit the sport amid concerns for her own safety. \\"I just don't feel it's right to carry on after this. It [safety] wasn't something I really worried about before. It wasn't an issue. This has just made it real, what we do when we get in the ring. I have a fight on Friday [12 April] which I've been training for since the beginning of the year, and I'm going to make this my last.\\" Errol Johnson, who trained Tom Bowen, Norgrove's opponent in his final fights, said the boxer had been left devastated by the incident and was considering whether to continue in the sport. Writing for The Independent, the sports journalist Steve Bunce expressed incomprehension at the death, but felt it was a tragic accident. \\"In nearly 30 years I have never been as confused by a boxer's death or injury as I am by Norgrove's [...] Norgrove did nothing wrong, the sport did nothing wrong and there is nothing that could have been done to prevent this death. There is no hidden story attached to this tragedy.\\" References External links *Interview with Michael Norgrove on Vimeo Category:1981 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Deaths due to injuries sustained in boxing Category:Deaths from bleeding Category:Light-middleweight boxers Category:People from Kabwe District Category:Sport deaths in England Category:Boxers from Greater London Category:Zambian emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:English male boxers ","title":"Michael Norgrove"},{"id":"39032112","text":"The Christian Reformed Church in Haiti was a mission effort of the Christian Reformed Church in North America and the Christian Reformed Church of the Dominican Republic in 1987.

During the initial study period of 1996-2001, allowing for ABOi heart transplantation reduced infant mortality from 58% to 7%. Graft survival and patient mortality is approximately the same between ABOi and ABOc recipients.Saczkowski, R., Dacey, C., & Bernier, P.-L. (2010).

Furthermore, should the recipient (for example, type B-positive with a type AB-positive graft) require eventual retransplantation, the recipient may be medically capable of receiving a new organ of either blood type.

He was Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of the Wisconsin Territory, and served as County Judge of Iowa County, when it was still organized under the Michigan Territory. Biography Blackstone's parents were born in Connecticut Colony, but relocated to Madison, Madison County, New York, where John Wilford Blakstone was born in 1796. He was educated at public schools in Madison until age 17, when he attended Hamilton College in Oneida County, New York. He graduated in 1819. Three months prior to his graduation, he adventured with a friend by boat up the Allegheny River, onto the Ohio, and then down the Mississippi to Memphis, Tennessee. They took a stash of merchandise with them and visited several towns and camps along the banks of the rivers, trading their goods until they were all exhausted. He returned from Memphis to New York and, on his arrival, began to study law. In 1822 he was admitted to the New York State Bar. Over the next few years, he would study medicine and spend two years in Canada. In 1828, he permanently removed to the west, setting out on another boat up the Allegheny. He arrived first at Shawneetown, Illinois, then resided for a time at Galena, Illinois, then moving, that winter, to Mineral Point, Wisconsin, then in the Michigan Territory, where he would remain for two years, working in the lead mining industry and practicing law. In 1830, after the organization of Iowa County, he was made a county judge. At the time, Iowa County contained all the land in Wisconsin south of the Wisconsin River and west of the river's major bend. In 1832, he volunteered for the Michigan Territory Militia in the Black Hawk War and was made a Lieutenant under Colonel Henry Dodge. After the war, in 1833, he married Catherine Hammond, the widow of Blackstone's former partner James Hammond, at Galena. In the spring of 1835, he purchased a farm near White Oak Springs, where he would reside for the rest of his life. In 1838, after the separation of Iowa Territory from Wisconsin Territory, he would be elected to the 2nd Wisconsin Territorial Legislature as a representative of Iowa County. At the first session of that legislature, during the winter of 1838-39, he was chosen as Speaker. In 1847, his home fell into the newly organized Lafayette County, created from the southern half of what remained of Iowa County. He was a member of the first grand jury of White Oak Springs, in 1847, and, in 1849, was a member of the first County Board of Supervisors. He would remain on the Board of Supervisors as the representative of White Oak Springs through the 1861 session, and served as chairman of the County Board from 1858 through 1860. He died in 1868 and was buried at the family farm. Personal life and family Blackstone is a direct descendant of William Blaxton (Blackstone), one of the first colonists of the Plymouth Colony, and the first English resident at Boston (1623) and Rhode Island (1635). The name \\"Blackstone\\" appears on many landmarks of New England due to his noteworthy ancestor. Blackstone married Mrs. Catherine (or Katharine) Hammond in Galena, Illinois, on April 4, 1833. She had one daughter from her previous marriage. They had seven children together. Their son John W. Blackstone Jr. served in the Wisconsin state legislature and was also a county judge.The Blackstone Family References External links * Category:1796 births Category:1868 deaths Category:People from Madison County, New York Category:People from Lafayette County, Wisconsin Category:Hamilton College (New York) alumni Category:New York (state) lawyers Category:Wisconsin lawyers Category:Michigan Territory officials Category:Members of the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature Category:American people of the Black Hawk War Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"John Wilford Blackstone Sr."},{"id":"39032212","text":"The TICC may be: * Taipei International Convention Center in Taipei, Taiwan * Tanga International Conference Centre in Tanga, Tanzania ","title":"TICC"},{"id":"39032223","text":"Horn Cable TV (HCTV) is a Somali news-based private television channel.

The method is secure provided that the object cannot be copied or physically emulated. Hands-off versus hands-on authentication of objects When authenticating an object, one can distinguish two cases. * Hands-on authentication: The object is fully under the control of the verifier. The verifier can see if the object is of the correct type, size, weight etc.. For example, he can see the difference between a real tooth and a hologram representing the tooth. * Hands-off authentication: The verifier does not have full control. For example, he has line-of-sight but cannot touch the object. In the hands-on scenario, physical unclonable functions (PUFs) of various types can serve as great authentication tokens. Their physical unclonability, combined with the verifier's ability to detect spoofing, makes it exceedingly hard for an attacker to create an object that will pass as a PUF clone. However, hands-on authentication requires that the holder of the PUF relinquishes control of it, which may not be acceptable, especially if there is the risk that the verifier is an impostor. In the hands-off scenario, however, reliable authentication is much more difficult to achieve. It is prudent to assume that the challenge-response behavior of each PUF is known publicly. (An attacker may get hold of a genuine PUF for a while and perform a lot of measurements on it without being discovered.) This is a \\"worst case\\" assumption as customary in security research. It poses no problem in the hands-on case, but in the hands-off case it means that spoofing becomes a real danger. Imagine for instance authentication of an optical PUF through a glass fiber. The attacker does not have the PUF, but he knows everything about it. He receives the challenge (laser light) through the fiber. Instead of scattering the light off a physical object, he does the following: # measure the incoming wave front; # look up the corresponding response in his database; # prepare laser light in the correct response state and send it back to the verifier. This attack is known as \\"digital emulation\\". For a long time spoofing in the hands-off scenario has seemed to be a fundamental problem that cannot be solved. The traditional approach to remote object authentication is to somehow enforce a hands-on environment, e.g. by having a tamper-proof trusted remote device probing the object. Drawbacks of this approach are (a) cost and (b) unknown degree of security in the face of ever more sophisticated attacks. Quantum-physical readout of a PUF  The basic scheme  The problem of spoofing in the hands-off case can be solved using two fundamental information-theoretic properties of quantum physics: # A single quantum in an unknown state cannot be cloned.W.K. Wootters and W.H. Zurek. \\"A single quantum cannot be cloned\\". Nature, 299: 802‚Äì803, 1982 # When a quantum state is measured most of the information it contains is destroyed. Based on these principles, the following scheme was proposed.B. ≈†koriƒá, \\"Quantum Readout of Physical Unclonable Functions\\", International Journal of Quantum Information, 10(1):1250001‚Äì1 ‚Äì 125001‚Äì31, 2012. # Enrollment. The usual PUF enrollment. No quantum physics needed. The enrollment data is considered public. # Challenge. A single quantum (e.g. a photon) is prepared in a random state. It is sent to the PUF. # Response. The quantum interacts with the PUF (e.g. coherent scattering), resulting in a unitary transform of the state. # Verification. The quantum is returned to the verifier. He knows exactly what the response state should be. This knowledge enables him to perform a \\"yes/no\\" verification measurement. Steps 2-4 are repeated multiple times in order to exponentially lower the false accept probability. The crucial point is that the attacker cannot determine what the actual challenge is, because that information is packaged in a \\"fragile\\" quantum state. If he tries to investigate the challenge state by measuring it, he destroys part of the information. Not knowing where exactly to look in his challenge-response database, the attacker cannot reliably produce correct responses. A continuous-variable quantum authentication of PUFs has been also proposed in the literature, which relies on standard wave-front shaping and homodyne detection techniquesGeorgios M. Nikolopoulos and E. Diamanti, \\"Continuous-variable quantum authentication of physical unclonable keys\\", Scientific reports, 2017..  Security assumptions  The scheme is secure only if the following conditions are met, * Physical unclonability of the PUF. * The attacker cannot perform arbitrary unitary transformations on the challenge quantum (i.e. physical emulation of the PUF is supposed to be infeasible). In multiple-scattering optical systems the above requirements can be met in practice. Quantum Readout of PUFs is unconditionally secure against digital emulation, but conditionally against physical cloning and physical emulation.  Special security properties  Quantum readout of PUFs achieves * Hands-off object authentication without trusted hardware at the side of the object. * Authentication of a quantum communication channel without a priori shared secrets and without shared entangled particles. The authentication is based on public information. Imagine Alice and Bob wish to engage in quantum key distribution on an ad hoc basis, i.e. without ever having exchanged data or matter in the past. They both have an enrolled optical PUF. They look up each other's PUF enrollment data from a trusted source. They run quantum key distribution through both optical PUFs; with a slight modification of the protocol, they get quantum key distribution and two-way authentication. The security of their key distribution is unconditional, but the security of the authentication is conditional on the two assumptions mentioned above.  Experimental realization  Quantum readout of speckle-based optical PUFs has been demonstrated in the lab.S.A. Goorden, M. Horstmann, A.P. Mosk, B. ≈†koriƒá, P.W.H. Pinkse, \\"Quantum-Secure Authentication with a Classical Key\\", https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0142S.A. Goorden, M. Horstmann, A.P. Mosk, B. ≈†koriƒá, P.W.H. Pinkse, \\"Quantum-secure authentication of a physical unclonable key\\", http://www.opticsinfobase.org/optica/abstract.cfm?uri=optica-1-6-421 This realization is known under the name Quantum-Secure Authentication.  Security proofs  Security has been proven in the case of Challenge Estimation attacks, in which the attacker tries to determine the challenge as best as he can using measurements. There are proofs for n=1, B. ≈†koriƒá, \\"Quantum Readout of Physical Unclonable Functions\\", http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/369 for quadrature measurements on coherent states B. ≈†koriƒá, A.P. Mosk, P.W.H. Pinkse, \\"Security of Quantum-Readout PUFs against quadrature based challenge estimation attacks\\", http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/084 and for fixed number of quanta n>1. B. ≈†koriƒá, \\"Security analysis of Quantum-Readout PUFs in the case of challenge- estimation attacks\\", http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/479 The result for dimension K and n quanta is that the false acceptance probability in a single round cannot exceed (n+1)/(n+K). The security of the continuous-variable quantum authentication of PUFs against an emulation attack, has been also addressed in the framework of Holevo's bound and Fano's inequality, as well as a man-in- the-middle attack.

The heart of Blackmoor Vale and the Vale of Wardour is the lush, clay vales, mainly given over to pasture, and characterized by an even pattern of straight-sided, hedged fields, scattered woodlands, dense hedgerows and common hedgerow trees. Willows and alders along the banks of its streams and the hanging mists give it an almost wetland feel. Thomas Hardy described it as \\"the beautiful Vale of Blackmoor... in which the fields are never brown and the springs never dry.\\"Hardy, Thomas (1891). Tess of the d'Urbervilles, Harper & Bros, NY., p. 9. There are few villages; instead farmsteads and hamlets dot the landscape. To the east and north the view is interrupted by low limestone hills, and, occasionally, hills like Duncliffe rise dramatically from the plain. The Frome valley in the north is thinly populated, settlements and parks on the valley sides looking down on arable farmland. In the east along the Vale of Wardour, settlement increases and arable farming is also more prevalent here. The region has 5 Special Areas of Conservation: Rooksmoor; Fontmell & Melbury Downs; Holnest; River Avon; Chilmark Quarries; and Cerne & Sydling Downs. The main watercourses are the rivers Stour, Nadder, Cale, Lydden, Frome, Brue and Wylye.

She was the only one of the 15 to survive World War II, and her background as Hitler's food taster was not revealed until a newspaper interview on her 95th birthday in December 2012.Hitler's Food Taster: One Bite Away from Death, Der Spiegel, April 2, 2013. Early life  W√∂lk was born in Wilmersdorf, the inner city locality of Berlin, in 1917. As a young woman W√∂lk says she had refused to join the League of German Girls (Bund Deutscher M√§del or BDM), the girl's version of Hitler Youth, and her father had been condemned for refusing to join the Nazi Party. She was married and worked as a secretary during the beginning of the war, but left her parents' bombed-out Berlin apartment in the winter of 1941, to relocate to her mother- in-law's home in the East Prussian village of Gross-Partsch, now Parcz, Poland. According to W√∂lk, allied bombs had damaged her Berlin apartment, which stood in knee-deep water. Her husband Karl was at war, though having heard nothing from him in two years, she had long since assumed he was dead. In Gross-Partsch, she stayed with his parents in a house with a large garden. Less than three kilometers away was the Wolfsschanze (Wolf's Lair), German leader Adolf Hitler's first Eastern Front military headquarters in World War II. The complex, which would become one of several F√ºhrerhauptquartiere (F√ºhrer Headquarters) located in various parts of occupied Europe, was built for the start of Operation Barbarossa - the invasion of the Soviet Union - in 1941. See e.g. Hitler's food taster  After W√∂lk's arrival in Gross- Partsch, she and 14 other young women were selected by the local mayor and brought to the barracks in nearby Krausendorf (now Kruszewiec, Warmian- Masurian Voivodeship, Poland), where cooks prepared food for the Wolf's Lair in a two-story building. W√∂lk was picked up by a bus daily from her mother-in- law's residence. The tasting took place daily from 11 to 12 o'clock. The service personnel filled platters with vegetables, sauces, noodle dishes and exotic fruits, placing them in a room with a large wooden table, where the food had to be tasted. \\"There was never meat because Hitler was a vegetarian,\\" W√∂lk said in an interview.Hitler's Food Taster Tells Her Story, Newser, April 3, 2013. \\"The food was good ... very good. But we couldn't enjoy it.\\" There were rumors of Allied plans to poison Hitler. After the women confirmed that the food was safe, members of the SS brought it to the main headquarters in crates. After Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg's failed 20 July plot in 1944 in the Wolf's Lair to assassinate Adolf Hitler and remove the Nazi Party from power, the security around the Wolf's Lair was tightened, the food tasters were no longer allowed to stay at home. Instead, they were boarded in a vacant school building nearby. Each morning at 8 AM, W√∂lk was rousted by the SS, who shouted \\"Margot, get up!\\" from beneath her window. By that time, she was only needed if Hitler was actually at the Wolf's Lair, though she says that she never actually saw him. She saw Hitler's German shepherd almost daily: \\"It often played on the open area in front of our office-shack.\\" Later in 1944, when the Soviet Red Army was just a few kilometers away from reaching the Wolf's Lair, a lieutenant took W√∂lk aside and put her on a train to Berlin. After the war ended, W√∂lk met the lieutenant again, and he told her that all of the other 14 food tasters had been killed by Soviet soldiers.Hitlers Vorkosterin, Berliner Zeitung, April 4, 2013. Aftermath  As W√∂lk returned to Berlin, she fell into the hands of the Soviet Army after the end of the Battle of Berlin. For two weeks, they raped her repeatedly, inflicting such injuries that she was never able to bear children. In 1946, she was reunited with her husband Karl; he was marked by years of war and imprisonment, but the married couple lived happily together until his death in 1980. For decades after the war, W√∂lk never talked about what happened in Gross-Partsch; however, the experience came to her often in dreams. It was not until December 2012, on her 95th birthday, when a local Berlin journalist from the newspaper Berliner Zeitung paid her a visit and began asking questions, that she spoke about what she calls the worst years of her life. It was then, she suddenly decided to break her silence. She died in 2014. In popular culture  Two novels, At the Wolf's Table by Rosella PostorinoTasting Food For The F√ºhrer At 'The Wolf's Table', NPR, January 26, 2019. and The Taster by V.S. Alexander, are based on W√∂lk's experiences. This novel is inspired on her life but not all that it mentions is reality; the writer decided to start the book by positioning the main character at Hitler's suicide. Hitler‚Äôs Tasters, a play by Michelle Kholos Brooks is based on these women. A short film released in 2019, called \\"Guest Of Honor\\" by filmmaker Justin Robinson, is based on the events of the survivor Margot W√∂lk. The short film can be found on YouTube and Vimeo.

Contemporary historians‚Äô views toward the Ordinance vary, with someÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÊó©ÊúüÈÜ´ÁôÇ attributing the Ordinance to health segregation, whereas others attribute it to social status segregation.

Background Segregation by health In 1894, the deadly Third Pandemic of Bubonic plague spread from China to Hong Kong, causing 100,000 deaths in Canton alone within two months. Dr. Gomes da Silva, the Principal Medical Officer of Macao, in recording the sanitary condition of the Chinese population, observed that they usually threw house refuse into the street, where it accumulated until such time as the torrential summer rains and the overflow of the Pearl River cleared it away. A study by City University of Hong Kong also attributes the spread of plague to the hygiene and sanitary condition among local population at the time.Early history of medical service in Hong Kong(È¶ôÊ∏ØÊó©ÊúüÈÜ´ÁôÇÊúçÂãô), City University of Hong Kong. Retrieved 8 July 2008 Governor of Hong Kong Sir William Robinson reported to the British Government that \\"the filthy habits of life amongst the 210,000 Chinese who reside here have rendered Hong Kong liable to the invasion and development of the germ of the bubonic plague\\". In the late 1890s, Europeans who resided in the City of Victoria gradually moved to places of higher altitude to evade such living conditions. But as the Chinese population continued to increase in the city, and the Europeans were reaching Victoria Peak thus could not move any higher, the Hong Kong Government decided to reserve the Peak for Europeans and other non-Chinese. The 1904 Government Gazette explained that such reservation of the district was to address such concerns over the health of European people. Between 1894 and 1929, the plague caused 24,000 case of infection in Hong Kong, of which 90% were fatal. In 1929, the plague was eradicated and the law was repealed in 1930. Segregation by social status 20th century Journalisthttps://www.formasiabooks.com/authors/ FormAsia authos Trea Wiltshire, in her book \\"Old Hong Kong\\", believes the Hill District Reservation Ordinance was a law based on social segregation as its goal. At the time one's social status was measured by the altitude of one's residence. One incidental benefit that came with the law included the reservation of the Peak Tram at certain hours of the day. From 8 to 10 am, the tram service was for top officials, first class passengers only, thus guaranteed good commute time. The front seat of the tram was always reserved for the governor, who further accorded its desirable social status by building a summer retreat, the Mountain Lodge. The Peak at the time was referred to by the British as \\"Little England\\".Courtauld, Caroline. Holdsworth, May. The Hong Kong Story. Hong Kong publishing, Oxford university press. . pg 46.

This mechanism harnesses the recoil of the fired round to push the slide rearwards. As the slide moves to the rear, it: a.) ejects the spent cartridge case, b.) compresses the recoil spring, c.) tilts the breech end of the barrel down to receive a new round and d.) cocks the hammer. The slide is then pushed forward by the recoil spring. As the slide moves forward, it: a.) extracts a new round from the magazine and b.) pushes the round into the chamber and c.) tilts the breech end of the barrel up into battery under the action of a cam on the barrel. The tilting action locks the breech to the slide. Since the firearm is single-action only, the hammer cannot be cocked by squeezing the trigger, but must initially be cocked to fire the first round by manually cycling the slide. Since this pistol has an exposed hammer, the hammer can also be manually cocked for a second strike in the event of a misfire.

This is a form of public participation in the examination of patent applications. Procedure Observations by third parties can only be filed after the publication of a European patent application. They must be filed in writing by post or, alternatively, online. The filing of observations by third parties at the EPO is free of charge and, according to the current practice of the EPO, may be anonymous. The observations must state the grounds on which they are based. The grounds must be written in one of the official languages of the EPO, i.e. in English, French or German. The documentary evidences (i.e., the publications, etc.) can be in any language, but the EPO may request a translation from the person filing the observations, if necessary.: \\"Observations by third parties\\" The observations are communicated to the applicant for or proprietor of the patent, who may comment on them. If the observations call into question the patentability of the invention, they must be taken into account in any proceedings pending before a department of the EPO until such proceedings have been terminated, i.e. they must be admitted to the proceedings. The EPO \\"has a duty vis-√†-vis the public not to grant or maintain patents which it is convinced are not legally valid\\".Decision T 156/84 of April 9, 1987, reasons 3.5, first paragraph: \\"(...) the EPO also has a duty vis-√†-vis the public not to grant or maintain patents which it is convinced are not legally valid\\"; , \\"Observations by third parties\\", \\"Introduction\\", last paragraph: \\"Art. 115 EPC helps to ensure that no legally invalid patents are granted or maintained. The public must be able to rely as far as possible on the legal validity of a patent granted by the EPO and the provision is designed to protect this public interest (T 156/84, OJ 1988, 372; T 60/91, OJ 1993, 551; T 1495/09).\\" Status of the person submitting third party observations A person submitting observations during examination or opposition proceedings does not become party to the proceedings. This notably means that, during examination proceedings, such person has no right to attend oral proceedings before the Examining Division, which are not public. This contrasts with the filing of a post-grant opposition, wherein the opponent becomes party to the proceedings, therefore acquiring, notably, the right to be heard before any decision is taken. Prioritization of treatment The EPO announced that, as of July 2014, European patent applications for which \\"substantiated observations are filed by third parties who identify themselves\\" are to receive prioritized treatment. Third-party observations filed during the international phase may also lead to expediting the EPO examination proceedings, but only if the third party \\"has clearly expressed its wish that the next office action in the European phase be expedited\\". Statistics Between 2006 and 2012, the number of third party observations submitted with the EPO roughly doubled. About 35 percent of cases against which third party observations are submitted are later opposed.

There was a fortress on the hill Gradi≈°te, east of the current position of the village. Ottoman period Modriƒç fortress which was located in this village had a great importance during Ottoman rule because of its strategic position on the left bank of the river Black Drim, next to the road between Ohrid and Debar. On the other side of the road was Kod≈æad≈æik (then Svetigrad). At the beginning of the Ottoman rule Modriƒç was probably a little more important than Ko≈æad≈æik. In November 1443 Skanderbeg revolted against the sultan and this fortress became one of Skanderbeg's strongholds. It was also mentioned in the works of Marin Barleti. In 1448, Sultan Murad II besieged the fortress of Svetigrad. The first battle between Skanderbeg's and Ottoman forces during the Siege of Svetigrad (Kod≈æad≈æik) in 1448 was held at Modriƒç fortress. In 1452, Ottoman forces from Ohrid attacked Skanderbeg's rebels but were defeated at Modriƒç where Hamza Kastrioti led Skanderbeg's rebels and Ottoman commander Hamza Pasha, his namesake. According to Pollo and Puto, in 1456 Skanderbeg's nephew George Strez Bal≈°iƒá, who governed the fortress of Modriƒç, sold it to Ottomans. In 1467 this village was recorded in the Ottoman register as a timar of one Sinan who was a dizdar (castellan) of Modriƒç fortress. The fortress was probably destroyed to such extent that it was without garrison while its reconstruction was either impossible or unnecessary. Demography At around 1467, Modriƒç fortress was registered as part of the Ottoman nahiyah Dolgo Brdo (Golo Brdo) and had only 7 households. According to the 2002 census all 25 inhabitants of Modriƒç declared as Macedonians.

Originally constructed as the United States Navy Evarts-class destroyer escort DE-523, she served in the Royal Navy from 1943 to 1945. Construction and transfer The ship was laid down by the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts, on 14 August 1943 as the unnamed U.S. Navy destroyer escort DE-523 and launched on 24 September 1943. The ship was christened by Sara Fischer, the wife of Captain Hugo Fischer, who was the superintendent of the Boston Navy Yard at the time. The United States transferred the ship to the United Kingdom under Lend-Lease on 16 December 1943.

On 26 January 1945, Manners joined the British frigates , , and of the 4th and 5th Escort Groups in a depth-charge attack on the German submarine in the Irish Sea about 20 nautical miles (37 km) from The Skerries, Isle of Man. During the engagement, U-1051 fired an acoustic torpedo which exploded near Manners propellers, breaking her in two; her stern section sank, and four officers and 39 ratings were killed and 15 ratings were wounded.

It is a potential space located between the mylohyoid muscle superiorly, the platysma muscle inferiorly, under the chin in the midline. The space coincides with the anatomic region termed the submental triangle, part of the anterior triangle of the neck. Location and structure Anatomic boundaries The boundaries of the submental space are: * the mylohyoid muscle superiorly * the investing layer of deep cervical fascia (and this in turn is covered by the platysma muscle) inferiorly * the inferior border of the mandible anteriorly * the hyoid bone posteriorly * the anterior bellies of the digastric muscles laterally. Communications The communications of the submental space are: * the submandibular spaces posterolaterally. * the sublingual space superiorly (via erosion through the mylohyoid). Contents Its contents are submental lymph nodes, areolar connective tissue and the anterior jugular veins. Clinical relevance This space may be created by pathology, such as the spread of pus in an infection. Odontogenic infection of the mandibular anterior teeth may erode through the lingual cortical plate of the mandible. If the level at which the infection breaks out of the mandible is below the attachment of the mylohyoid, then it will spread into the submental space. However, it is more usual for odontogenic infections to spread into the submental space via first involving the submandibular space. Cutaneous infections or symphyseal/parasymphyseal mandibular fractures may also give rise to a submental space infection. Signs and symptoms of a severe submental abscess include a firm swelling below the chin and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). Treatment is by surgical incision and drainage, with the incision running transversely in a skin crease behind the chin. Ludwig's angina is a progressive cellulitis involving the submandibular, sublingual and submental spaces bilaterally.

Rising in Tripura, it flows into Bangladesh where it merges with the Feni near the latter's mouth to the Bay of Bengal. The Muhuri is also known as the Little Feni.  Course of the river  The Muhuri rises in the Lushai Hills of Tripura and flows west into Bangladesh which it enters through the Parshuram upazila of Feni district. In Bangladesh, the river separates the Feni and Chittagong districts before flowing out into the Bay of Bengal.  Indo- Bangladesh border  The Muhuri acts as the border between India and Bangladesh in the Tripura-Noakhali sector. However, the frequently changing course of the river prevented the two nations from demarcating the boundary here with India insisting on the 1974 Accord with Bangladesh that calls for demarcation \\"along the mid-stream of the course of Muhuri river at the time of demarcation\\" while Bangladesh insisted on an 1893 map that would result in it gaining an extra 44 acres from India. The Muhurichar Muhurichar river island, a 140-acre island on the river and important for rice cultivation, was a source of tension between the two countries as both laid claim to it and it resulted in skirmishes between the border security agencies of Bangladesh and India on several occasions. In 2011 during the visit of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to Bangladesh, both countries agreed to the demarcation of the land boundary between them. The two parties agreed on the demarcation of the boundary along the Muhuri and also agreed to construct embankments along the river within their borders to stabilise it and to undertake fencing along the 'zero line' in the sector.  Hydrology  The Muhuri has a total basin area of 839 km2 in Tripura which accounts for 8% of the state's total geographical area. It has an annual flow of 76,247,000 cubic metres of water which amounts to 9.6% of Tripura's total river flows. In Bangladesh, the Muhuri basin covers an area of 40,080 hectares spread across the upazilas of Feni Sadar, Sonagazi, Chhagalnaiya and Parshuram in Feni district and the Mirersarai Upazila of Chittagong district with a total irrigable area of a little over 23,000 hectares. The river is known for its wild nature and flash floods and its frequent changes in course. For the most part, the Muhuri has a width of 150 to 200 metres which increases as it nears the sea. As it nears the sea, it comes under the increasing influence of tidal action. The river is quite shallow and navigable by 4 tonne boats for only half the year and it is possible to ford it during the lean season.  Waterworks  The Government of India built an impermeable spur on the river before 1975 to protect the town of Belonia from riverine erosion. The Joint River Commission has since restrained either country from constructing them on the river. The Muhuri Irrigation Project, consisting a closure dam and a 20-vent regulator, was completed by Bangladesh in 1986 to provide irrigation facilities and to check the inflow of saline water into the river from the Bay of Bengal. The Muhuri empties into the Feni at the reservoir formed by the building of the closure dam from where water is taken out through irrigation canals. The project has helped develop inland fisheries, curbed incursion of saline water upriver and kept upstream areas safe from storm surges following cyclones.

One of the smallest horses to win a classic, he won the St Leger on his racecourse debut in September 1792. He won twice in the following season before racing without success in 1794. Background Tartar was a chestnut horse standing 14.1 hands high, foaled in 1789. He was sired by Florizel a successful racehorse whose other offspring included The Derby winners Diomed and Eager as well as the St Leger winner Ninety-three. Tartar was the sixth of eight foals produced by the Duke of Cumberland's mare Ruth. The name Tartar had previously been used for several other horses in the 18th century. The most notable was a Yorkshire-bred racehorse who sired Herod and was therefore the paternal great- grandsire of the St Leger winner who shared his name.http://www.bloodlines.net/TB/Bios2/Tartar.htm Racing career 1792: three-year-old season Until 1913, there was no requirement for British racehorses to have official names, and the horse who later became known as Tartar competed in 1792 as Ld A. Hamilton's ch. c. by Florizel out of Ruth. There is no record of Hamilton's colt competing in public until the autumn of 1792. The St Leger, run over two miles at Doncaster Racecourse on 25 September attracted a field of eight colts and three fillies. Mr Wentworth's colt Ormond, Sir Frank Standish's Kit Carr and an unnamed colt owned by John Hutchinson led the betting at odds of 3/1 with Hamilton's colt starting a 25/1 outsider. Ridden by his trainer, John Mangle, the nameless colt won the classic from the filly Skypeeper with Adonis in third place. 1793: four- year-old season Before the start of the 1793, season the St Leger winner was sold and entered the ownership of Mr L. Jewison. He was still without an official name when he made his first appearance as a four-year-old at Newcastle-under-Lyme Racecourse on 2 July. Jewison's chestnut colt by Florizel contested a ¬£50 race run in a series of four-mile heats with the prize going to the first horse to win twice. He won the first heat from Ruby and Highland Lass, and took the win when both his opponents were withdrawn from the second heat. On the following day Jewison's colt finished third in the first heat of another ¬£50 race, but won the next two heats to win the prize from Virgin and Young Eclipse. On 20 August, Jewison's colt appeared as Tartar for the first and only time in a race at York. This was a \\"give and take\\" race in which horses were given a weight based on their height. Tartar, whose height was given as 14 hands 1 inch, started the 6/4 favourite but was withdrawn after finishing second in the first heat. Tartar's last race recorded race of 1793 was at Boroughbridge Racecourse on 2 October. He finished second, fourth and fifth in three heats of a ¬£50 race won by Alexina. 1794: five-year-old season On 13 June 1794 at Manchester Racecourse, Mr Thompson's five-year- old chestnut horse Toy finished second to Minimus in the first heat of an ¬£80 race. According to the 1794 Racing Calendar, Toy was the horse formerly known as Tartar. Stud career Tartar was sold to Count Vorontsov, then a minister at St. James Court, and was exported to Russia along with the 1794 Derby winner, Daedalus.

Fort Campbell, Kentucky, is located on the border between Tennessee and Kentucky. Its post office is in Kentucky. The neighboring communities are Clarksville in Tennessee and Oak Grove and Hopkinsville in Kentucky.  History  The Fort Campbell Children's Theatre was established in 1970 as part of the Morale Welfare Music and Theatre program. It resided in a World War II building on Indiana Avenue for several years until the building was required for other military purposes. After that, plays were held in the Soldier Show Center, also on Indiana Avenue, as well as the Cabaret Dinner Theatre. The Cabaret Dinner Theatre was first located on Indiana Avenue, and later moved to a larger facility which had been the former recreation hall of the old hospital. The Halloween and Christmas plays were usually held in the larger facility due to their popularity and the additional events held in conjunction with these programs, such as costume contests and visits from Santa. The cast and crew of the plays were children who lived on Fort Campbell and in the surrounding areas. Most were Army family members, although residents of the community were also welcome. Rehearsals and performances were held after school, usually beginning at 4 p.m., and performances were also held at 2 p.m. on weekends. The directors were staff members of the Music and Theatre program, as well as some guest directors. The head of the Music & Theatre Program at Fort Campbell was Lionel Austell, the Post Entertainment Director, who established the Music & Theatre program in 1967.Interview: Austell [Interview, Lionel Austell, Clarksville, TN, October 29, 2012] Robert L. Taylor, a theatre specialist who had previously worked as a director at the Nashville Children's Theatre, organized the Children's Theatre program shortly after joining the staff at Fort Campbell. Taylor also directed plays for adults, which were presented in the Soldier Show Center and in the Cabaret Dinner Theatre.Interview: Taylor {Interview, Robert L. Taylor, Oak Grove, KY, September 14, 1993] The Children's Theatre was active for nearly 16 years, until the dissolution of the Music & Theatre program in 1986. Many of the plays were original adaptations of stories and fairy tales in the public domain, and some were totally original. After the initial launch, Heide Hepler, who was music specialist with the Music & Theatre program, shared management of the Children's Theatre with Taylor. Approximately 8-10 children's plays were presented annually.Interview: Hepler [Interview, Heide Hepler, Clarksvillel, TN, October 29, 2012] Billy St. John,Pioneer Drama a theatre specialist and a published author of plays, gave technical support with set design, costuming, lighting and other advice regarding the Children's Theatre. St. John's duties were primarily in the adult productions of the Soldier Show Center and the Cabaret Dinner Theatre; although an important element of the Children's Theatre, he was not one of the regular directors. Lilo Rogoish, a family member, became costume designer and seamstress for many of the Children's Theatre productions as well as the adult plays held at the other theatres. Upon dissolution of the Music and Theatre program, Rogoish became head costume designer for the theatre program at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, TN.  Productions  Both Hepler and Taylor wrote original plays, adapted plays in public domain, and produced and directed published plays for the Children's Theatre. All acting and technical roles were filled by children and teenagers in the local area, with occasional technical support from adults, often parents and soldiers who were volunteers with the theatre program. Participation as performers, technicians and audience members was open to residents of the surrounding communities as well as the military and their family members residing on- and off-post. This was part of the community relations incentive of the installation. Special costumes were provided from the inventory of the Soldier Show Center, designed and created by staff members and parents, and were often commissioned. Lilo Rogoish,The Leaf-Chronicle a community member and costume designer, often created costumes for the Children's Theatre as well as Soldier Show Center and Cabaret Dinner Theatre productions.Interview: Rogoish {Interview, Lilo Rogoish, Clarksville, TN, October 29, 2012] When the Music and Theatre program closed, Rogoish became head of the costume department of the theatre program at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville. Taylor and Hepler often collaborated on original musicals, including The Witch Who Went West, a Halloween production, and The Toymaker, a Christmas production. The script and lyrics were written by Taylor, with music composed by Hepler. Dr. Charles H. Ball, professor of music education at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, collaborated with the two on the music of The Witch Who Went West and provided a soundtrack to be used with the production.Interview: Ball [Interview, Dr. Charles H. Ball, Knoxville, TN, November 1, 2012] Additional plays adapted by Taylor include Copp√©lia, The Steadfast Tin Soldier, Pinocchio, Swan Lake and Sleeping Beauty. Adaptations written by Hepler include Alice in Wonderland, Through the Looking Glass, Hansel and Gretel and The Pied Piper. Andre La France, a soldier stationed at Fort Campbell, served as guest director for the production of his original play, Princess Tina. Megan Hepler, nine years old, played the title role. The Children's Theatre occasionally sponsored playwriting contests, with the winning entries being produced at the theatre.  Halloween and Christmas plays  Halloween, Christmas, and other special occasion productions were popular at the Children's Theatre. The annual Halloween production, usually directed by Hepler, started with a play that was followed by a costume contest, door prizes and refreshments. The Witch Who Went West, a musical collaboration with book and lyrics by Taylor, music by Hepler and soundtrack by Dr. Ball, was the story of a young witch who became bored with her life and decided to go west to find new adventures. The Christmas production was directed by Taylor. One of the plays was his original, The Toymaker, also a musical collaboration, featured two of Santa's elves whose job it is to make toys for Christmas delivery by using a large Toymaker machine. \\"Junk\\" goes into one side and beautiful toys come out on the other. When the Toymaker breaks just before delivery time, the elves have the dilemma of trying to fix the machine so that everything will be on schedule.  Touring plays  In 1984, the Children's Theatre organized a tour of the Disney children's musical version of Alice in Wonderland to all the elementary schools at Fort Campbell. The soundtrack was pre-recorded by all the children who performed in the play. Parents helped to shuttle the cast members and set pieces from school to school for nearly a week. All cast members were excused from their regular attendance by participating schools in order to participate in the tour. One year the Children's Theatre presented short skits and comedy routines on a portable stage for the annual Fort Campbell Fourth of July Celebration. The popular celebration, open to all residents of the surrounding communities, also included games, static displays, food and a band concert, followed by fireworks. The event was always held at a post parade field.  Closing of the Children's Theatre  The Children's Theatre was a popular venue at Fort Campbell until the termination of the Music & Theatre Program in 1986. After that, plays, including plays for children, were sometimes presented at Dale Wayrynen Recreation Center at Fort Campbell.

The streetcar network had its beginnings with the horsecar era of the Montreal City Passenger Railway in 1861. The initial line was along Rue Notre Dame (Notre Dame St) from Rue du Havre (Harbor St) to Rue McGill (McGill St).  Montreal Street Railway  Powerhouse for the Montreal Street Railway, William Street, Montreal, 1894 The City Passenger Railway became the Montreal Street Railway in 1886. The decision to use electricity instead of horses for propulsion was made in 1892. On September 21 of that same year, \\"The Rocket,\\" Montreal's first electric streetcar made its maiden voyage. By 1894, the remaining horsecar lines had all been converted to accommodate the new electrically powered streetcars. The Montreal Street Railway was known as one of the most innovative and progressive in North America. One of its innovations was the introduction of the \\"Pay As You Enter\\" (P.A.Y.E.) system of fare collection in 1905. Prior to that time, conductors would walk through the car collecting fares meaning many passengers probably rode for free on very crowded cars. The P.A.Y.E. system was adopted worldwide by many other transit companies. The company also designed and built two open sightseeing (another two were built later) cars that were in service until the late 1950s. The designs of those sightseeing cars were sold to transit companies in Quebec City, Calgary and Vancouver, who all built their own versions of the car.  Montreal Park and Island Railway  View of the Montreal Park and Island, circa 1895 The Montreal Park and Island Railway was incorporated by the Legislature of Quebec in 1885Acte incorporant la compagnie de chemin de fer du parc et de l'√Æle de Montr√©al (1885), 48 Vict., c. 74 (Que.). to run railway service in the suburbs of Montreal. They built lines to Lachine, St Laurent and Cartierville, and to Sault-au-R√©collet. The company had an agreement with the Montreal Street Railway Co to allow MP&IR; cars to run through to terminals in Montreal. The company was formed on 1893-12-27 and was eventually consolidated with other companies to form the Montreal Tramways Company in 1911Montreal Park and Island Railway  Montreal Tramways Company  In 1911 a new corporate entity, the Montreal Tramways Company was formed consolidating the city streetcar routes of the Montreal Street Railway and the suburban routes of the Montreal Park & Island Railway and the Montreal Terminal Railway. The Montreal Tramways Company would own and operate the transportation system until the system was taken over by the city-owned Montreal Transportation Commission in 1951.  World War II  Tram on Craig Street East and St. Laurent Boulevard Montreal Tramways conductors training Through the war years (1939 to 1945), Montreal's streetcar system carried huge passenger loads with workers commuting to busy factories supplying the war effort. Every available streetcar was put into service. The company even bought several streetcars from U.S. systems that were converting to buses. Even private automobile owners were taking streetcars as rationing made gasoline and tires difficult to get. Most manufacturing of private automobiles was halted about halfway through the war years so assembly plants could concentrate on military vehicles. The Montreal Tramways Company had its own difficulties in getting material and some maintenance had to be deferred. The heavy wartime traffic and deferred maintenance took its toll. The Montreal Tramways Company faced major challenges at the end of the war. There was much rehabilitation work that had to be done to the track, the overhead trolley wires and the streetcars themselves. There was also much more competition. Manufacturing of automobiles for the civilian market started up again and after the deprivations of the war, many people wanted one. Many former streetcar passengers were now buying their first cars. Streetcar passenger numbers were starting to fall. The much-touted freedom of the automobile encouraged the development of new neighborhoods further from the city centre and not served by the company's streetcars. Traffic congestion was becoming a bigger problem, especially in the narrower streets of the older parts of downtown Montreal. The company's 30-year contract with the city was also coming to an end in 1948. For all of these reasons, the company was reluctant to spend money on expansion and modernization. Instead they would sell their assets to a publicly owned transportation authority.  Montreal Transportation Commission  In 1950, legislation was passed to create the city-owned Montreal Transportation Commission, which would be charged with taking over the assets of the Montreal Tramways Company, which it officially did in June 1951. The Commission decided to convert all streetcar lines to buses within 10 years. To relieve traffic congestion, the newly established Montreal Transportation Commission decided to convert the inner city routes first. Many of Montreal's streetcar routes included running on a portion of Sainte Catherine Street (Rue Sainte-Catherine) downtown. On some downtown sections of this street, there was a headway of 10 seconds or less between streetcars but by the end of August 1956, streetcar service on the street had come to an end. A parade of streetcars and historical equipment was held to commemorate the event. Many of the outlying routes, especially those running on private rights-of-way, lasted the longest. When the last streetcar ran in August 1959, another parade was held to mark the end of the streetcar era in Montreal. The Commission had succeeded in replacing the streetcar system with buses in eight years instead of ten.  End of streetcar service  The city's last streetcars operated on August 30, 1959, after which Montreal was served solely by buses until the Metro or subway opened in October 1966. A small electric trolley bus network consisting of four routes continued operating until April 1966, when two of the routes were converted to diesel buses. The final two trolley bus routes lasted for another two months until June 1966.  Golden Chariot sightseeing cars  In 1905, the Montreal Street Railway constructed two open-topped sightseeing streetcars locally known as Golden Chariots. Seating was arranged in an ascending configuration (like a theatre's tiered seats) toward the rear to provide a commanding view of the sights. Two more vehicles were constructed in the 1920s. All cars are currently preserved in museums. Ostensibly for tourists, they were probably always more popular with Montrealers looking for a breezy ride during the hot and humid summers of Montreal. The cars operated on a counter-clockwise circuit around the three peaks of Mount Royal via Bleury, Park, Laurier, C√¥te Ste. Catherine, Bellingham, Maplewood, Decelles, Queen Mary, a private right- of-way between Queen Mary and C√¥te Saint Luc, Girouard, Sherbrooke, Atwater, St. Luke, Closse, Sainte Catherine, then back to Bleury. A second Golden Chariot route was established in the late 1940s. That followed a counter- clockwise route along Ste. Catherine, Delorimier, Mount Royal Avenue, Park, Laurier, C√¥te Ste. Catherine, Bellingham, Maplewood, Decelles, Queen Mary, C√¥te des Neiges, and back to Ste. Catherine. This second route lasted only a few years being discontinued when streetcar service ended on C√¥te des Neiges in 1955. By 1956, the original and remaining Golden Chariot route had to be adjusted as streetcar trackage was reduced. When streetcar service ended on Sherbrooke and Ste. Catherine at the end of August 1956, cars were rerouted. Instead of turning east from Girouard to Sherbrooke, they continued south on Girouard to Upper Lachine Road, then Saint-Antoine to Bleury and Park. They last ran in regular service in the summer of 1957 although they could still be chartered in the summer of 1958. By then, however, the streetcar track network had shrunk even further. Tramway crossing under construction in 1893. Contrary to popular belief, the Golden Chariots never operated in regular service over Mount Royal, the small high mountain that is the city's namesake. It was found that if passengers stood in some areas of the upper tiers of the Golden Chariots, there was not enough of a safety clearance in the tunnel on that line. Therefore, the Company only used the Golden Chariots on the spectacular mountain right-of-way for occasional charter trips. The Mount Royal streetcar private right-of-way would later become the Camillien Houde Parkway for automobiles. Service was normally provided by the regular cars of the 11-Mountain route from the east, and the 93-Remembrance route from the west. Both routes met at Summit Loop near today's Beaver Lake (Lac des Castors) Pavilion where Remembrance Road and the Camillien Houde Parkway meet. The 93-Remembrance route was one of the shortest in the city, being only about long from its western terminus at Remembrance and C√¥te des Neiges Roads. While the 93-Remembrance route was a relatively straight line to Summit Loop, the 11-Mountain route was far more challenging. The route up the east side of the mountain featured sharp curves, grades as steep as 10 percent and a tunnel. Motormen on this route were specially trained and strict safety procedures were used. The streetcars used on this route were equipped with an auxiliary braking system and powerful handbrakes in addition to their regular equipment. Both the 93-Remembrance and 11-Mountain routes were summer-only services. There were a number of other unique cars on the system especially in the earlier years. The Montreal Street Railway, and later the Montreal Tramways Company, operated a smaller two-axle vehicle used as a rolling stage for the company's employee band. A prison car with no side windows was used to take miscreants between the downtown courthouse and the outlying Bordeaux Prison before roads were improved. The streetcar fleet also included two funeral cars, the second and larger of which saw heavy use during the influenza epidemic of 1918. They were used to carry caskets to the outlying Hawthorndale Cemetery, which was beyond the reach of good roads at the time. The funeral cars only carried caskets with the mourners having to take regular streetcars.  Electric Trolley Buses  Montreal also used trolley buses. Introduced in 1937, they were seen as having some advantages over streetcars. Unlike streetcars, they could load and unload at the curb instead of stopping traffic in the middle of the street. They were still dependent on overhead trolley wires. Their passenger capacity was also less than the larger streetcars. Although all streetcar lines had been converted to buses by 1959, traffic congestion had not improved as hoped. City traffic engineers came up with a plan to turn many major streets into one-way thoroughfares, which would affect several trolley bus routes. Trolley buses by this time had fallen out of favour with transit companies, and new North American equipment was harder to get. Montreal's Brill trolley buses were quickly approaching the end of their economic service lives. As a result of all of these factors, the Commission decided to end trolley bus service in 1966. Two of the four trolley bus routes were converted to diesel buses in April while the last two trolley bus routes were converted to diesel buses in June. Montreal's new subway, the Metro, would open just four months later in October.  Historic Vehicles  Horsecars In the early days, the Montreal City Passenger Railway used horse-drawn sleighs in the winter and horsecars in the summer. In the muddy seasons in between, omnibuses were used. * Larivi√®re - sleighs and omnibuses * John Stephenson Company - horsecars  Electric cars  With the coming of electric cars in 1892, the Montreal Street Railway and later the Montreal Tramways Co began to buy a variety of electric car types. * Single-ended, single-truck cars (SE-ST) from Brownell Car Company which supplied the first electric streetcar to Montreal. * Double-ended, single-truck cars (DE-ST) from J.

And order of Model 664T was purchased from AEC (Associated Equipment Company) and, later, many of the model T-44 and T-44A were purchased from Canadian Car & Foundry.  Future Service  In February 2006, Montreal mayor G√©rald Tremblay suggested the city look into a return of the streetcar into the heart of the city, following a visit to Paris, where new service started in 1992. In early 2012, the STM announced a plan to convert its entire fleet of buses over to all-electric by 2025. Beginning in 2012, all STM bus purchases will be either hybrids or electrics and, starting in 2011, Montreal will begin testing trolley buses (electric buses powered by overhead wires) on some of the city's busiest routes On March 31, 2014, the STM began testing a Chinese BYD prototype all-electric bus on several routes with a plan to have Novabus of St. Eustache, Quebec begin to trial its own version later the same year. The earlier plan to incorporate trolley busses using overhead wires was put on hold for further study References Category:Transport in Montreal Category:Street railways in Canada ","title":"Streetcars in Montreal"},{"id":"39032819","text":"Ankitha Lakshmi is an Indian playback singer.

1863 ‚Äì 7 June 1952) was a Roman Catholic missionary bishop who served as Vicar Apostolic of Uganda from 1897 to 1933. Early years Henri Streicher was born on 29 July 1863 in Wasselonne, France. On 23 September 1887 he was ordained a Priest of the White Fathers (Society of the Missionaries of Africa). For two years he taught Church History and Bible at the Greek Melchite Seminary in Jerusalem. After that he taught Systematic Theology at the White Fathers \\"scholasticate\\" at Carthage for a year. Missionary In 1890 Streicher was appointed to the Apostolic Vicariate of Victoria Nyanza led by Bishop John Joseph Hirth, which he reached in 1891. He was assigned to Buddu in the south of the Buganda kingdom. In 1892 there was a civil war in Uganda, during which the supporters of the Catholics had to move to Buddu. Soon after the fighting ended Streicher established the Villa Maria mission (near Masaka). Victoria Nyanza was divided into three parts in 1894. Hirth took the Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Nyanza, the English Mill Hill Missionaries took the eastern part, called the Apostolic Vicariate of Upper Nile, and Bishop Antonin Guillermain took the western part, called the Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Nyanza. In 1896 Guillermain died of a viral hemorrhagic fever. The next year Streicher, acting as head of the Roman Catholic mission since his death, was appointed his successor. Bishop On 1 February 1897 Streicher was appointed Titular Bishop of Thabraca and Vicar Apostolic of Northern Victoria Nyanza in what is now Uganda. He decided that he would not return to Europe to be consecrated, and was ordained on 15 August 1897 in the small church of Kamoga at Bukumbi (in what is now Tanzania) by Bishop John Joseph Hirth assisted by two priests. He made his headquarters at Villa Maria. His vicariate included all of the south and west of modern Uganda, and included 30,000 baptized Christians when he became Apostolic Vicar. Bishop Guillermain had already begun to evangelize the Nyoro and Toro kingdoms in the west of the country. Streicher began missionary activity in Ankole in 1902, and in Kigezi twenty years later. He was authoritarian, using his diocesan synods to present decisions rather than encouraging debate. The chiefs who had converted to Catholicism moved to Buddu, and treated him as both civil and religious leader, equivalent to a king. Streicher assumed some of the royal trappings in his costume. The chiefs sent their sons to be his pages at his court, and they ensured that their followers were converted by the Ganda catechists. Streicher was a strong believer in education and set up schools throughout his territory. He founded a training college for catechists in 1902. He required that students know the alphabet before being admitted to the catechumenate, and that they were literate before they could be baptized. Until 1916 he resisted allowing English to be used in his schools, thinking that would encourage his students to engage in worldly pursuits. The result was that the Catholics became disadvantaged compared to Protestants in English-administered Uganda. Streicher did allow English in St. Mary's Lubaga, founded in 1906 for the sons of chiefs. He saw Catholic teaching orders as a potential threat to his authority, and did not allow them to enter the diocese until 1924, when the Canadian Brothers of Christian Instruction of Ploermel were permitted to launch St. Mary's College Kisubi and to open other schools. Streicher consider that training indigenous priests was the first priority, more important than conversion of the people. He inherited the seminary at Kisubi, later moved to Bukalasa, near to Villa Maria. In 1911 the senior seminarians moved to Katigondo. In 1913 Streicher ordained the first two African priests of the colonial era. In 1913 and 1914 Streicher headed a commission charged with assembling the testimonials needed to beatify the Uganda Martyrs. World War I seriously affected the mission, with 31 of the 63 priests who could travel being recalled to France, and with subsidies cut off. On 15 Jan 1915 his Vicariate Apostolic was as Vicariate Apostolic of Uganda and he remained at his post until his resignation on 2 June 1933. In May 1920 he assisted at the solemn beatification ceremony of the Uganda Martyrs in Rome. Streicher pushed hard to prepare for the diocese to become autonomous from European assistance, causing resentment from missionaries who felt that more time was needed. Legacy Streicher resigned in 1933 and became Titular Archbishop. By then his vicariate had 303,000 baptized Christians. His mission was separated into the vicariates of Rubaga and Masaka. After resigning he was appointed titular archbishop of Brysis. The future diocese that he left at his retirement was far in advance of any other at that time. In 1939 he assisted Pope Pius XII at the consecration of Joseph Kiw√°nuka in St Peter's, Rome. Kiwanuka, who was the first African bishop since the days of the early church, became Vicar Apostolic of Masaka. Streicher made his home in Ibanda. On 7 June 1952 he received the last rites from Bishop Kiwanuka before his death. He was interred in his church that he had built at Villa Maria. He was described by Cardinal Costantini as \\"the greatest missionary of the twentieth century.\\" Bibliography  References Sources  Category:1863 births Category:1952 deaths Category:Ugandan Roman Catholic bishops Category:White Fathers priests ","title":"Henri Streicher"},{"id":"39032871","text":"Saint Ailill the Second (also called Ailill the Younger, Ailill II, Ailiell, Ailild, Ailid, Alild, Ailillus, Alellus, Alildus, Oilill, Oileal, Oileald, Olildus, Olild, Elias, Eulalius, Helias) b. c.480 - d. 1 July 536, was the Bishop of Armagh, Ireland from 526 to 536.

Haugating served as an assembly for the regions around Vestfold and the area west of Oslofjord. It was located at T√∏nsberg in Vestfold, Norway. Haugating (lokalhistoriewiki.no) Background Although it was not as recognized nationally as the √òreting in Tr√∏ndelag, Haugating did play an important role in the history of Norway as a site for the proclamation of kings. At various times, Harald Gille, Sigurd Magnusson, Magnus Erlingsson and Jon Kuvlung were all proclaimed there to be contenders to the throne of Norway.Haugating (visitnorway) Haugating was seated in T√∏nsberg at Haugar (from the Old Norse word haugr meaning hill or burial mound). During the Civil war era in Norway (between 1130-1240), Tonsberg was one of the area where the Bagler faction and other rebel bands stood strong in the battle against the Birchleg. Several rebel bands hailed their royal subjects from Haugating. A memorial stone was erected on the site during 1954. Haugating (visitoslo.com) Haugar - Vestfold Kunstmuseum (T√∏nsberg kommune) Haugar Vestfold Kunstmuseum Haugar Vestfold Kunstmuseum Haugar Vestfold Art Museum (Haugar Vestfold Kunstmuseum) is located at the site of the former Haugating. The museum opened to the public 1995 and since 2009 has been associated with Vestfold Museum (Vestfoldmuseene). This is an art museum with exhibitions principally featuring Norwegian contemporary art. The museum features works by Odd Nerdrum and Frans Widerberg as well as works by Kjartan Slettemark among others. The museum is associated with Vestfold Museum (Vestfoldmuseene). Haugar Vestfold Art Museum took over the former premises of T√∏nsberg Navigation School (T√∏nsberg Navigasjonsskole). The building was built 1918-1921 and designed by architects Andreas Bjercke and Georg Eliassen. Their design was awarded the Houen Foundation Award in 1925. The building is adorned with twelve caryatid which were created by the sculptor Wilhelm Rasmussen between 1920-1922.

The trial was broadcast live on Libyan state television and was the first public execution under the rule of Muammar Gaddafi. Al-Shuwehdy had returned from America three months earlier where he had been studying, and had begun to protest Gaddafi's regime. While working as an engineer at an airport he joined friends that were campaigning against Gaddafi. The Libyan secret police later seized him at his home; he was executed a few months later. Al-Shuwehdy's family never received his body; mourners later arriving at their house would be physically intimidated. After his death, members of his family also experienced difficulty finding employment or securing places at a university. Circumstances The trial and execution was witnessed in the stadium by thousands of school children and students, who had been specifically bussed in for the occasion. Al-Shuwehdy was alone in the centre of the stadium, with his hands bound behind his back, and wept as he confessed to his crime of joining the \\"stray dogs\\", regime terminology for dissidents, before being sentenced to death. He was accused of plotting to assassinate Gaddafi. The court described him as \\"a terrorist from the Muslim Brotherhood, an agent of America\\". Two young men ran up to the judges and begged them for mercy, and a gallows was produced in the middle of the basketball court. As Al-Shuwehdy kicked and writhed on the gallows, Huda Ben Amer, then a young Gaddafi loyalist, stepped forward, and grabbed his legs, pulling hard on his body until the struggling stopped. Her actions bought her to the attention of Gaddafi, and she was rapidly promoted. She later twice became the mayor of Benghazi and one of Libya's richest and most powerful women. Her intervention during Al-Shuwehdy's execution earned her the nickname \\"Huda the executioner\\". Amer was captured by National Transitional Council forces during the Libyan civil war in September 2011. The previous month Gaddafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound in Tripoli had been raided in an attempted coup planned by the National Front for the Salvation of Libya. Al-Shuwehdy's cousin Magdi was killed in the raid. In the aftermath, 2,000 people were arrested and twelve were publicly hanged in their home towns. Other hangings were later broadcast, and re-broadcast, on Libyan state television. The execution was broadcast live on state television. The film of his trial and execution was rediscovered in 2011 during the Libyan Civil War by Peter Bouckaert, a researcher for Human Rights Watch. Bouckaert was assisted by British photographer Tim Hetherington, it was the last project that Hetheringon was working on at the time of his death. The trial was viewed live on television by many Libyans but had not been seen in full since 1984. The footage of the trial was given to Brouckaert by Shwehdi's brother Ibrahim, who gave four Beta video tapes to be digitized and preserved.

The Venetians tried, with considerable success, to repopulate the country and reinvigorate its agriculture and economy, but were unable to gain the allegiance of the bulk of the population, nor to secure their new possession militarily. As a result, it was lost again to the Ottomans in a brief campaign in June‚ÄìSeptember 1715.  Background  Venice had a long history of interaction with the Morea, dating back to the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade (1203‚Äì1204), when the Republic acquired control of the coastal fortresses of Modon and Coron, Nauplia and Argos. These they held even after the remainder of the peninsula was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1460, but they were lost in the first, second and third Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian Wars. In successive conflicts, the Ottomans pried away the other remaining Venetian overseas possessions, including Cyprus and Crete, the latter after a prolonged struggle that ended in 1669.Davies & Davis (2007), pp. 25‚Äì29 In 1684, following the Ottoman defeat at the second Siege of Vienna, Venice joined the Holy League and declared war on the Ottoman Empire. Under the leadership of Francesco Morosini, who had led the defence of Candia, the capital of Crete, the Venetians took advantage of the Ottoman weakness and rapidly took over the island of Lefkada (Santa Maura) in 1684. In the next year, Morosini landed on the Peloponnese, and within two years, aided by the local Greek population, took control of the peninsula and its fortresses.Vakalopoulos (1973), pp. 15‚Äì23Chasiotis (1975), pp. 19‚Äì27 A subsequent Venetian campaign into eastern Continental Greece succeeded in capturing Athens, but failed before the walls of Chalkis (Negroponte). Thereafter the conflict degenerated into a stalemate, with raids and counter-raids on both sides, until the signature of the Treaty of Karlowitz between the Ottomans and the Holy League, which in Greece left the Morea, Leucas and the island of Aegina in Venetian hands.Vakalopoulos (1973), pp. 23‚Äì35, 39‚Äì42Chasiotis (1975), pp. 27‚Äì36  Organization of the new province   Administration  The administrative division of the \\"Kingdom of the Morea\\" Already in 1688, with their control of the country practically complete, the Venetians appointed Giacomo Corner as the governor-general (provveditore generale) of the Morea to administer their new territory. The task he faced was daunting, as the population had fled from the coming of war: 656 out of 2,115 villages were deserted, almost all the Muslim population had abandoned the peninsula for lands still in Ottoman hands, while even towns like Patras, which numbered 25,000 inhabitants before the war, now had 1,615 left. Apart from the region of Corinthia and the autonomous Mani Peninsula, the Venetians counted only 86,468 inhabitants in 1688, out of an estimated pre-war population of 200,000.Vakalopoulos (1973), pp. 48‚Äì49Vakalopoulos (1975), pp. 206‚Äì207 Other sources, however, like the Englishman Bernard Randolph, who lived in Greece in 1671‚Äì1679, assessed the population of the Morea at the time at 120,000, of which one quarter Muslim and the rest Christian. This is commensurate with the attested demographic decline across the Ottoman Empire in the 17th century, and the demands made by the Ottoman government on the peninsula's resources during the long Cretan War.Topping (2000), p. 32 Under Corner's oversight, a committee of three senators (Jeronimo Renier, Domenico Gritti, Marino Michiel) was sent to the Morea to reorganize the provincial administration, revive local authorities, compile a cadaster and settle land disputes. The peninsula was divided into four provinces:Vakalopoulos (1973), pp. 52‚Äì53Vakalopoulos (1975), p. 207 * Romania, in the northeastern Peloponnese, with capital at Nauplia (Napoli di Romania), and the districts of Argos, Corinth, Tripoli, and Hagios Petros in Tsakonia * Laconia, in the southeast, with capital at Monemvasia (Malvasia), and the districts of Mystras, Vordonia, Kelefa, Passavas and Zarnata * Messenia, in the southwest, with capital at Navarino, and the districts of Modon, Coron, Androusa, Kalamata, Leontari, Karytaina, Fanari, Kyparissia and Navarino * Achaia, in the northwest, with capital at Patras, and the districts of Vostitsa, Kalavryta, Gastouni and Patras Each province and district was headed by a provveditore, who combined civil and military authority, and was aided by a rector (rettore) in charge of justice and a chamberlain (camerlingo) in charge of financial affairs.Setton (1991), p. 398 To the \\"Kingdom of the Morea\\" was also joined the administration of the islands of Kythera (Cerigo) and Antikythera (Cerigotto), off the southeastern coast of the Peloponnese, which had been in Venetian hands since 1204.Davies & Davis (2007), p. 28 = List of the provveditori generali of the Morea = The formal title of the Venetian governor-general of the Morea was Provveditore generale delle Armi (\\"Superintendent-general of the Arms\\"), with his seat in Nauplia.Da Mosto (1940), p. 20 In the first period after the conquest, he was assisted by two provveditori extraordinary. The provveditori generali appointed during the duration of the Kingdom of the Morea are known through their relazioni, the reports they submitted to the Venetian government on their deeds. These were: # Giacomo Corner (1688‚Äì1690) # Tadeo Gradenigo, provveditore estraordinario (1690‚Äì1692) # Antonio Molin, provveditore estraordinario (1692‚Äì1693) # Marin Michiel (1694‚Äì1695) # Agostino Sagredo (1695‚Äì1697) # Paolo Nani (1697) # Francesco Grimani (1698‚Äì1701) # Giacomo da Mosto (1701‚Äì1703) # Antonio Nani (1703‚Äì1705) # Angelo Emo (1705‚Äì1708) # Marco Loredan (1708‚Äì1711) # Antonio Loredan (1711‚Äì1714) # Alessandro Bon (1714‚Äì1715)  Economic and social development The Kingdom of the Morea, shown within Europe in 1700 To restore the province, settlers were encouraged to immigrate from the other Greek lands with the lure of considerable land grants, chiefly from Attica but also from other parts of Central Greece, especially the areas that suffered during the war. 2,000 Cretans, and also Catholic Chians, Venetian citizens from the Ionian Islands and even some Bulgarians answered this call. In addition, mention is made of 1,317 Muslim families that remained behind, converted to Christianity and were given lands or enterprises as concessions. As a result of these policies, the population recovered rapidly: apart from Mani, the Venetian registers record 97,118 inhabitants in 1691, 116,000 a year later and 176,844 by 1700. Due to the relative privileges granted the urban population, the period was also marked by an influx of the agrarian population to the cities.Vakalopoulos (1973), pp. 55‚Äì57Malliaris (2007), pp. 98ff. The Venetians engaged in a concerted effort to revive and improve the country's agriculture and commerce. Thus the settler families were given 60 stremmata each, while the elders of the local communities were allocated 100; new grape cultures were introduced from France and Italy and import tax was levied on foreign wine, laying the foundations for the revival of viticulture and the raisin trade with Western Europe; measures were taken to develop forestry; and the indigenous silk industry was promoted. Trade links established both with the rest of Ottoman Greece as well as with the North African coast, which exported the Morea's main produce, raisins, cereals, cotton, olive oil, leather, silk and wax. As a result, the annual revenue from the province rose steadily, from 61,681 reales in 1684/85 to 274,207 in 1691 and 500,501 in 1710, of which about three-fifths were spent in the Morea itself.Vakalopoulos (1973), pp. 60‚Äì62Vakalopoulos (1975), pp. 208‚Äì209Setton (1991), p. 400 By way of comparison, the total tax revenue due to the Ottoman government from the province before 1684 is estimated at 1,699,000 reales.Vakalopoulos (1973), p. 48 Due to the extensive influx of migrants, the Venetian period was marked by intense social mobility. Although in general both the original inhabitants and the new settlers remained in the social class to which they had belonged originally, the policies of the Venetian authorities with their continual land grants to their supporters‚Äîincluding the hereditary quasi-fiefs known as conteas (\\"countships\\")‚Äîcoupled with the economic upturn, brought about the emergence, for the first time after the disbandment of the Christian sipahis of the Peloponnese in the early 1570s, of a new affluent class of merchants and land-holders, many of whom were from Athens, Chios and the Ionian islands. According to the Greek historian Apostolos Vakalopoulos, here lies the origin of the oligarchy of the kodjabashis, who dominated the peninsula's affairs from the late 18th century until the Greek War of Independence.Vakalopoulos (1973), pp. 62‚Äì63Malliaris (2007), pp. 103‚Äì105 By contrast, for the mass of the peasants, both natives and immigrants, the situation progressively worsened; whether due to debts, transgressions of officials, the exactions of corv√©e or the increasing scarcity of land, many peasants, especially those who had migrated from Central Greece, chose to flee to the Ottoman-held territories across the Gulf of Corinth. They were welcomed by the Ottoman authorities, while the Venetian authorities were forced to institute military patrols to stop them.Malliaris (2007), pp. 105‚Äì107 This demonstrates a deepening gulf in Moreot society: when the Turks returned in 1715, the bulk of the population remained unaffected, and only the better-off such as the contea possessors actively supported Venice, and in many cases abandoned the peninsula for Italy following the Venetian defeat.Malliaris (2007), p. 107 The depredations and turmoil of the war and its aftermath also brought about a rise in banditry across the country. To combat it, the Venetian authorities raised a provincial gendarmerie, the meidani, but also armed the villagers and formed local militias, echoing the armatolik system of the Ottomans. Despite their successes in this regard, the Venetians, like the Turks before and after them, were unable to completely eradicate banditry, since the Maniots and other mountain dwellers, secure in their inaccessible strongholds, continued to defy Venetian law and raid the lowlands.Vakalopoulos (1973), pp. 58‚Äì59  Church affairs  The Venetians left the local Greek Orthodox Church largely to its own devices to avoid alienating the population, but regarded it with distrust due to its dependency on the Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople, under the close supervision of the Sultan. The Venetians tried to limit the Patriarch's influence, reducing the revenue he received from the province and insisting that the Moreot bishops be elected by their dioceses and not appointed by the Patriarch, but they largely failed to sever the ties of the local Orthodox Church (whose de facto leader at the time became the Metropolitan of Patras) with the Patriarchate.Vakalopoulos (1973), pp. 50‚Äì51Vakalopoulos (1975), p. 209 The Venetians showed more vigour in their efforts to re-establish the Catholic Church in the country, with conversions of mosques to Catholic churches as well as the construction of new ones, and the establishment of monks from various religious orders across the peninsula. Among the most notable events was the foundation of a Mechitarist Armenian monastery in Modon in 1708, which after 1715 was transferred to San Lazzaro degli Armeni in Venice. The centre of the Catholic Church in the Morea was the Latin Archbishopric of Corinth.Vakalopoulos (1973), pp. 50, 51  Security  Venetian Lion of Saint Mark and halberds from the time of the \\"Kingdom of the Morea\\" in the National Historical Museum, Athens. Despite the Treaty of Karlowitz, the Ottomans were unreconciled to the loss of the Morea, and already in 1702 there were rumours of impending war, with troops and supplies sent to the Ottoman provinces adjoining the Morea.Setton (1991), pp. 412ff. The Republic was well aware of the Ottoman intentions, and from the beginning of its rule in the Morea, its officials toured the fortresses to ascertain their state and their capacity to resist. However, the Venetians' position was hampered by problems of supplies and morale, as well as the extreme lack of troops available: even while the war was ongoing, in 1690, the Venetian forces in southern Greece numbered only 4,683 men, both mercenaries from Western Europe and local Greeks (recruited along the lines of the Venetian cernide system);Vakalopoulos (1973), pp. 59‚Äì60 while in 1702, the garrison at Corinth, which covered the main invasion route from the mainland, numbered only 2,045 infantry and barely a thousand cavalry.Setton (1991), p. 418 Although a detailed survey in 1698 found serious deficiencies in all the fortresses of the Morea, little seems to have been done to address them.Setton (1991), p. 399 Almost the only major work undertaken by the Venetians during their rule in the Morea was the new citadel for Nauplia, on the height of Palamidi overlooking the city, whose construction began under the supervision of Morosini during the Morean War. In the event, however, the defences of the city held out only for a few days against the determined Ottoman attacks in 1715.Setton (1991), pp. 339, 430‚Äì431  Ottoman reconquest  Following their victory in the Russo-Turkish War of 1710‚Äì1711, and citing various Venetian transgressions against Ottoman shipping as an excuse, the Ottomans declared war on 9 December 1714. A large army, reportedly 70,000 men under the command of Grand Vizier Silahdar Damat Ali Pasha, left Constantinople for the Morea, which it entered in late June. The Venetian forces, barely 5,000 strong under the provveditore generale Alessandro Bon and the captain-general Geronimo Delphino, were scattered among the various fortresses and unable to impede the Ottoman advance. The Acrocorinth citadel, the key to the peninsula, surrendered after only five days of bombardment, followed by the capitulation of Aegina and Argos. The Ottomans then proceeded to Nauplia, which was captured and ransacked after the fortress of Palamidi was stormed on 20 July. Its fall sealed the fate of the Morea, and the Maniots and other local inhabitants swiftly declared their allegiance to the Ottomans. The Venetians abandoned Navarino and Coron, hoping to hold out in Modon, but the rebellion of the Greek and mercenary soldiers allowed the Ottomans to take possession of the fortress with ease. With the capture of the Castle of the Morea on 16 August and the surrender of Monemvasia on 7 September and Kythera, the occupation of the \\"Kingdom of the Morea\\" was complete.Chasiotis (1975), pp. 39‚Äì43Setton (1991), pp. 426‚Äì432Vakalopoulos (1973), pp. 76‚Äì78 Kythera returned to Venetian rule in 1718, with the Treaty of Passarowitz, but the Morea remained under Ottoman control for another century, until the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821.Davies & Davis (2007), p. 29  References   Sources     Further reading   Pinzelli, Eric (2000) \\"Les forteresses de Mor√©e, projets de restaurations et de d√©mant√®lements durant la seconde p√©riode v√©nitienne (1687-1715)\\" Thesaurismata 30, Venice, p. 379-427. * Category:Ottoman Greece Morea Morea Category:States and territories established in 1688 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1715 Category:History of the Peloponnese Category:1688 establishments in the Republic of Venice Category:1715 disestablishments in the Republic of Venice ","title":"Kingdom of the Morea"},{"id":"39033157","text":"John Hedges or Hodges (by 1503 ‚Äì 12 January 1562), of Malmesbury, Wiltshire, was an English politician.

He was celebrated by later Sunni hadith scholars as the \\"imam of his time\\" and the \\"amir al-mu'minin in hadith\\". Biography Al- Daraqutni was born in c. 918 CE/306 AH in the Dar al-Qutn () quarter of Baghdad, whence he got his nisba. His studies were initially largely restricted to his native Iraq, where he frequented Wasit, Basra and Kufa. His teachers in his period included the son of Abu Dawood, Abu al-Qasim al-Baghawi and Ibn Mujahid, from whom he learned the different recitations of the Quran. Later in life, he travelled to Syria and Egypt; while in the latter, he enjoyed the patronage of the Ikhishid vizier Jafar bin al-Fadl for assisting him with compiling his own hadith collection. His students included the hadith scholars Abu Nu'aym al-Isfahani and Al-Hakim al-Nishapuri. Al-Daraqutni was a committed follower of the Shafi‚Äòi school, studying jurisprudence under the Shafi'ite scholar Abu Sa'id al-Istakhri. He was also an adherent of traditionalist school of Sunni doctrine and opposed the use of Kalam. In fact, Al-Dhahabi recorded that he hated it.Brown, Jonathan AC. \\"CRITICISM OF THE PROTO-HADITH CANON: AL-DƒÄRAQU·π¨Nƒ™'S ADJUSTMENT OF THE\\" ·π¢A·∏§ƒ™·∏§AYN\\".\\" Journal of Islamic Studies 15.1 (2004): 1-37. He wrote a treatise against Mu øtazilite Amr ibn Ubayd on the subject of anthropomorphism in relation to God and compiled a series of hadith collections in defence of the traditionalist interpretation of God's attributes. He died in 995 CE/385 AH and was buried in the Bab al- Dayr cemetery in Baghdad, near the grave of Maruf Karkhi.  Works  Several of al-Daraqutni's extant works have been published:  General hadith works  *al-Sunan, his primary hadith collection. *Kitab al-du'afa wa-l-matrukin, an alphabetically-ordered list of 632 hadith transmitters considered to be da'if or rejected. *al-'Ilal al-warida fi al-ahadith *al-Mukhtalif wa-l mu'talif fi asma al-rijal, a list of hadith transmitters who names are similar in spelling but differ in pronunciation.  Works on Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim  Al-Daraqutni wrote a series of commentaries, addendums and analyses of narrations contained within Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim. *Dhikr asma' al-tabi'in wa-man ba'dahum mimman sahhat riwayatuhuu min al- thiqat 'ind Muhammad ibn Isma'il al-Bukhari *Dhikr asma' al-tabi'in wa-man ba'dahum mimman sahhat riwayatuhu 'ind Muslim *al-Ilzamat ala sahiay al- Bukhari, a compilation of 109 narrations whose chains of narration, according to al-Daraqutni, satisfy the requirements for inclusion in Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim. *Asma al-sahaba allati ittafaqa fiha al-Bukhari wa-Muslim wa-ma infarada bihi kull minhuma *Kitab al-tatabbu' *Kitab fi dhikr riwayat al-sahihayn = Kitab al-tattabu = In his Kitab al-tatabbu', al-Daraqutni reviews 217 narrations within the two collections which he deems to be flawed using both isnad and matn criticism. Reasons given include the isnad not meeting the requirements for inclusion in the collections, and the commentary of the hadith's transmitters being inadvertently merged with its matn. Jonathan A. C. Brown cautions that the work is an adjustment to the two collections rather than an attack on their overall integrity.

Later years  During the last days of the empire, Sebeg, together with her clan, took refuge in Tang China. Emperor Xuanzong of Tang greeted her and threw a banquet for her. She was given the title of princess, and was appointed the ruler of her people. According to the New Book of Tang, Xuanzong sent flour to her clan during the harvest season.Ta≈üaƒüƒ±l p. 376 According to Russian historian Lev Gumilyov (1912‚Äì1992), she saved her people but not her nation.Gumilev p. 442 Accusations Turkish journalist Ahmet Akyol asserts that Buyruk Chor was not responsible for Bilge Khaghan‚Äôs death. Probably Sebeg poisoned her husband because Bilge Khagan had planned to sign a treaty of commerce with Tang China and, as was the custom, he would marry a Chinese princess after signing the treaty. Baumer claims that Sebeg usurped power and shared it with her lover. Liu Mao-Tsai suggested that Sebeg had Yollig poisoned and put the minor Tengri on the throne so that she could be regent and that she kept the death of Yollig secret from the Chinese which explains the variations in death dates.

Her parents, Richard (Patrick Fabian) and Madeline, tell Kayla and Will that they will fix the sign, but Kayla has to work at the dog kennel every day after school to pay for Will's sled. She agrees, and she and Will argue about her presence at the kennel. During the argument, Will blatantly tells Kayla that even though she has won many medals, her board technique is rusty and she was only on the Swift team because her dad owned the resort and supplied the team with money. After school, while working at the kennel, she receives a voice mail from Sebastian that she is kicked off the team because of her misconduct. Furious, she marches up to Nick, and he reveals that him and the others knew about her dismissal from the team but wouldn't do or say anything about it. When Kayla presses further, Nick explains that she can't win Fire and Ice, due to her faulty riding. The next day, when Will arrives, he is with his friends, Dink (Carlon Jeffery) and Sam (Andrew Caldwell). While Will is lecturing Sam on his poor snowboarding, Kayla realizes that Will truly does know what he is doing. Later, Will and his friends leave, leaving Kayla in charge. After she locks one of the dogs, Donald, in his cage, Kayla gives another a bath. Donald mischievously unlocks the cage and lets the other dogs out. She discovers their escape and chases them through town. Later, she talks to Nick again, and he decides that they should break-up, saying that she is distracting him from the competition. When Kayla returns to the kennel with the dogs, she pleads to be fired, but Andrea refuses. Back at home, her friends Pia and Lindsay try to comfort her and bring themselves to watch the viral video and see how Will got injured. Kayla asks Will to train her for Fire and Ice so she can really know snowboarding and work on her technique. She also offers to remodel the kennel to bring in more customers. Will denies that he still loves snowboarding and refuses to coach her. Infuriated, Kayla keeps trying to talk reason into him. He blatantly replies that she does not have a team to compete with, and so there would be no point in teaching her anyway. Kayla sees his old teammates and decided that they could be a team together. Kayla then notices the really famous shredder, Skye Sailor (Kiersey Clemons), and realizes the Swifts have replaced her with Skye. She tries to reason with Will again, telling him not only have the Swifts replaced her, but they beat Will too and he hasn't snowboarded since. Will then agrees to train them. At school, she tells her friends that Will is going to coach her and introduces them to Sam and Dink. She sees Nick and is incredulous when he silently 'what-ups' her. Later, Skye spots Kayla and offers to give her an autograph. Realizing this was the girl she replaced, she decides to make the autograph to 'Kayla, Everyone's favorite Daddy's girl.' Angrily, Kayla remarks that she will be the winner of Fire and Ice. Will and Kayla start serious training. Kayla isn't doing great at first, but she is later showing steady improvement and also working on the makeover for the dog kennel. At one point, Nick sees Kayla and Will together and he doesn't seem happy about it. Will's mom is blown away at the makeover once it is finished. She notes that Will and Kayla make a great team. While Will is preoccupied, she thanks Kayla for bringing back \\"the old Will.\\" After getting fro-yo, Kayla notices Tyson's Peak and comments on its scary appearance. Will concludes that riding down the mountain is impossible, while Kayla argues that nothing is impossible. Kayla asks what their chances of winning Fire and Ice were, and Will tells her that although it was shaky, they are starting to look like a real threat. Kayla ventures even further, voicing her thoughts that Will should join their team, and she makes him promise to at least think about it. The next morning, Kayla hears that her mother talked to Will's mom about her input at the kennel and her determination to become better at snowboarding, thus enlisting Will. She then hears her dad's comment that he doesn't want to see her fail and that she has no chance of winning against the Swifts. Kayla reminds herself that nothing is impossible. Later, Kayla asks Will to teach her the Cloud 9, but they argue when Will says she is not ready. Will uses the mountain as an example, saying you need to have no fear going down it. He ventures to say that Kayla is not yet at that point. Determined to prove a point, Kayla takes a helicopter ride to the top of Tyson's peak and bravely snowboards down the mountain, unaware that she is being recorded on TV from the helicopter and broadcast live on television. But on the way down, she falls off a drop when the snow ledge breaks, which causes an avalanche, which buries her under the snow though by then, she has boarded all the way down Tyson's Peak. Will and Donald run to find her and eventually rescue her. Kayla admits that she boarded down the peak just to impress Will, so he would be willing to teach her the Cloud 9. In school, Kayla finds out that Skye is already Nick's girl, and she tricks Will into holding her hand to even up the score. Later, Dink and Sam learn that Will has joined the team. Will finally agrees to teach Kayla the Cloud 9 and shows her how to do the first part. While she attempts the Cloud 9, Nick and Skye sees. Nick seems sympathetic when she falls and Skye notices. After a few failed attempts at the Cloud 9, Kayla leaves to refuel. Nick arrives and tells Will there's a strong chance Kayla will be injured doing the Cloud 9 just as Will was, and it would be Will's fault. Afterwards, Kayla makes a few more attempts. Now into the night, Skye is watching her when Sebastian sees her attempts. Panicked, he asks Skye what she was doing and Skye said the Cloud 9. He doesn't believe that she can pull it off but Skye counters him, saying not to count her out. Mad, he tells Skye that she told him she could beat Kayla. Skye counters commenting that he lied because he had said she was a pampered princess with no talent. She goes on about how much better Kayla's doing, saying \\"That girl can ride\\". When Kayla wants to do another attempt, Will says she was hesitating and that he can't risk her getting hurt. He accuses her that it is really just about winning Nick back. Kayla says she has had enough with people who don't believe in her. Will comes up and kisses her. When Kayla heads home, Sebastian comes up and tells her that he wants her back on the team and she says yes, just because he saw her as a new improved weapon for the Swifts. At the Fire and Ice competition, Kayla arrives wearing a Swift Team jacket, making the Hot Doggers (Will & Kayla's team) think she gave up on them. Kayla reveals she was only pulling a trick and was only wearing it to return the equipment she was instructed to give back earlier, making it clear that she has officially dumped the Swift team for what they did, and the Hot Doggers is where she belongs, despite warnings of regret from Sebastian. When Fire and Ice begins, Will starts out very well, with Nick close behind. In Run 2, Nick starts to show power and wins the Men's title, making Kayla the only chance the Hot Doggers have left against the Swift team. Kayla does pretty good in Run 1, but Skye does horrible. Skye pulled off a routine in Run 2 and Kayla can only beat her with at least an almost perfect score. Right before her round in Run 2, Richard apologizes to Kayla for not believing in her and hopes that she will win. Sebastian sees this and considers it a distraction from winning. Nick protests that a parent supporting their kid is not a bad thing. Nick then tells Kayla that he followed his father's orders to crash the sled in order to give his father an excuse to kick Kayla off the team as Sebastian before did not believe in her. Nick tells his father that this was his dream, not Nick's. Kayla and Will are both unsure if she will be able to perform the Cloud 9, but after what Nick told her, she is furious at Sebastian and even more determined than to beat the Swifts and decides she will do it. With an awesome performance, she successfully lands the Cloud 9, scoring a perfect 10 points from all the judges, winning her first \\"real\\" trophy, and making the Hot Doggers overall winners of Fire and Ice. Everyone applauds her, including Sebastian, who now regrets his decision to dump her from his team. Cast * Dove Cameron as Kayla Morgan * Luke Benward as Will Cloud * Mike C.

She made her debut in April 1995, working for Gaea Japan, where she became one half of the inaugural AAAW Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions. After becoming a two-time winner of the High Spurt 600 Tournament, Kato's career came to a halt following multiple injuries. After being sidelined for five years, Kato returned to the ring in October 2006, following the folding of Gaea Japan, and found a new home in the Oz Academy promotion, where she is a former two-time Oz Academy Openweight Champion and a four-time Oz Academy Tag Team Champion. Kato has also wrestled in the US for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and in Mexico for Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA). Professional wrestling career Gaea Japan (1994‚Äì2005) Kato had an excessive sports history in her childhood, practising track and field and volleyball in elementary school, handball in junior high school and javelin in high school, before deciding to follow her childhood dream and, despite her father's objections, took part in a professional wrestling audition held by Chigusa Nagayo. After passing the audition, Kato began training with Nagayo in October 1994. She made her debut on April 15, 1995, facing fellow debutante Meiko Satomura at the first ever event held by Nagayo's Gaea Japan promotion. Just before the debut match, Kato's father, whom Nagayo had managed to convince to support his daughter's dream of becoming a professional wrestler, died in a traffic accident. On November 2, 1996, Kato and Satomura became the inaugural AAAW Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions. Through Gaea Japan's working relationship with World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Kato made her American debut on November 29, 1996, in Wheeling, West Virginia, losing to Kaoru in a WCW Women's Championship tournament match. Kato returned to WCW in April 1997 to take part in a tournament to determine the inaugural WCW Women's Cruiserweight Champion, losing to Malia Hosaka in her semifinal match. On December 27, 1997, Kato won the High Spurt 600 Tournament, defeating Chikayo Nagashima in the finals. After a sixteen-month reign, Kato and Satomura lost the AAAW Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship to Chikayo Nagashima and Sugar Sato on March 29, 1998. After winning the High Spurt 600 Tournament for a second time in 1999, Kato began suffering from various injuries which sidelined her from late 1999 to July 2000 and again from February 2001 to 2006. During the time, Kato kept making non-wrestling appearances for Gaea Japan, including getting attacked and having her hair cut by the villainous D-Fix stable in late 2002. When Gaea Japan went out of business in 2005, Kato was uncertain whether she would ever wrestle again. Oz Academy (2006‚Äìpresent) Kato in July 2010 Kato finally returned to the ring at an independent event produced by Chigusa Nagayo on October 1, 2006. Kato then began working regularly for the Oz Academy promotion, which featured many other former Gaea Japan wrestlers. On May 25, 2008, Kato made her Mexican debut for Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA), taking part in a five-way elimination Reina de Reinas Tournament match, from which she was eliminated by Martha Villalobos. The following July, Kato and Chikayo Nagashima made it to the finals of a tournament to determine the inaugural Oz Academy Tag Team Champions, before losing to Carlos Amano and Dynamite Kansai. Kato and Nagashima eventually won the title from Aja Kong and Hiroyo Matsumoto on February 22, 2009. During the next eighteen months, Kato and Nagashima won the title two more times, becoming three-time champions together. Kato won the title for the fourth time on January 15, 2012, this time teaming with Aja Kong. After a seven-month reign, they lost the title to Akino and Ayumi Kurihara. On January 12, 2014, Kato received a shot at the Oz Academy Openweight Championship, but was defeated by the defending champion, Akino. The following June, Kato underwent a shoulder surgery, which would sideline her for an estimated six months. She returned to the ring on January 11, 2015. On February 8, Kato formed a new stable with Akino, Kagetsu and Kaho Kobayashi, which was on April 15 named \\"Mission K4\\" (MK4). On August 23, Kato won the first singles title of her twenty-year career, when she defeated Hiroyo Matsumoto in a Last Woman Standing match to win the vacant Oz Academy Openweight Championship. On October 10, Kato returned to the United States, when she made her debut for Shimmer Women Athletes, taking part in their two- day tenth anniversary weekend. After four successful title defenses, Kato was stripped of the Oz Academy Openweight Championship on April 24, 2016, when her defense against Hiroyo Matsumoto ended in a no contest. On July 18, Kato defeated Mayumi Ozaki to regain the vacant Oz Academy Openweight Championship. On November 13 at Oz Academy's 20th anniversary event, Kato lost the Oz Academy Openweight Championship to Hiroyo Matsumoto in her second defense.

He was a key figure in the talks that led to the end of the Bosnian war with the Dayton Accords, and the formation of the Federation during the Bosnian War. Early life Kom≈°iƒá was born into a Roman Catholic Bosnian Croat family in the village Borina by Kiseljak, Bosnia and Herzegovina. When he was born, in 1948, the country was part of Yugoslavia. Bosnian War At the beginning of the war in 1992, Kom≈°iƒá served temporarily as the Ministry of Defense as a volunteer and joined a humanitarian organization in Kiseljak. Kom≈°iƒá joined the Party of Democratic Reform political party in March 1991, leaving it after co-founding the Croatian Peasant Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 12 April 1993 with a group of Croat intellectuals, shortly before the escalation of war in Central Bosnia. This party created an alternative Croat policy in Bosnia and Herzegovina, opting for preservation of unified Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and coexistence of Croats with other nations in the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In November 1993 he became a member of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina Presidency based on the result of 1990 elections. He was a key figure in the formation of the Federation during the Bosnian War and the talks that led to the end of the Bosnian war with the Dayton Accords. Kom≈°iƒá has claimed that the nationalist Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HDZ BiH), the largest political party of Bosnian Croats derived from the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), founded by Croatian leader Franjo Tuƒëman, made its way into Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1990 through the parish system of the Catholic Church in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Kom≈°iƒá contends that the Bosnian Catholic bishops and clergy made it possible for the HDZ to obtain electoral victory in Bosnia-Herzegovina, even though it was clear that the party's goal was the dismemberment of the republic, and its integration into neighboring Croatia. Politics Kom≈°iƒá led his political party the Croatian Peasants' Party for two years until October 1995, leaving the party the following year when he finished in second place in the 1996 election. He joined the Social Democratic Party following the loss. After another lost election in 2002, Kom≈°iƒá joined the Social Democratic Union. He was the chairman of the House of Peoples of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina between 2000 and 2002. Between 2006 and 2010 he was a representative in the House of Representatives of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2010, he was named dean of the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Sarajevo. Kom≈°iƒá has squabbled with Bosnian Serb nationalist politician Milorad Dodik on several occasions. When Dodik said that no politicians from the Republika Srpska (RS) entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina would participate in the then- upcoming centennial commemorations of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by Serb Gavrilo Princip, and that the commemorations were only going to be used as a ploy to incite hate against Serbs, Kom≈°iƒá responded by saying that Dodik has no say in what goes on in Sarajevo, and that he hoped that soon, Dodik wouldn't have any say in what goes on in RS either. The French Embassy in Sarajevo dismissed the remarks made by Dodik about the planned events, saying the commemorations for meant to send a message of peace. Dodik is believed to have been behind the September 2014 installation of a giant unauthorized cross on the hill Zlati≈°te on Mount Trebeviƒá overlooking Sarajevo. Kom≈°iƒá accused him of installing the cross to improve his dropping political rating amongst Serbs in Republika Srpska before the upcoming election. Kom≈°iƒá verbally condemned the installation of the cross. He urged Sarajevans to not respond to the \\"clear provocation that is part of the election campaign.\\" Mayor of Sarajevo (2013‚Äì2017) Kom≈°iƒá joined the 2013 JMBG protests in Sarajevo, saying ‚ÄúI am here also on behalf of over 1,500 Sarajevo babies who can‚Äôt get travel documents.‚Äù During the protests and riots throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina in February 2014, Kom≈°iƒá said that demolition of government buildings was not the answer. He stated that while he was aware that people had been brought to the social edge, he urged the public to clearly state their demands in a peaceful manner. When Pope Francis visited Bosnia and Herzegovina on 6 June 2015, Mayor Kom≈°iƒá awarded him the Keys to the City of Sarajevo award. Following the trial and guilty verdict of Serb war criminal Radovan Karad≈æiƒá on 24 March 2016, Mayor Kom≈°iƒá stated that while it is important that the judgement confirmed Karad≈æiƒá's direct responsibility for years of terror on Bosnia and Herzegovina, he is not satisfied with the 40-year sentence, saying Karad≈æiƒá should have received the maximum due to the severity of the crimes. Kom≈°iƒá wonders why the Tribunal decided to limit the genocide charge to Srebrenica only, as \\"Karad≈æiƒá was responsible for atrocities across the country.\\" He added, \\"If we take only Sarajevo into account, it would be more than enough for life imprisonment.\\" Kom≈°iƒá has stressed his desire for his country to move past the violent events of the 20th century and \\"into the new era\\".

The related term show code refers to the practice of a medical response that is medically futile, but is attempted for the benefit of the patient's family and loved ones. However, the terms are often used interchangeably. The practices are banned in some jurisdictions. Background During a patient cardiac arrest in a hospital or other medical facility, staff may be notified via a code blue alert. A medical response team, based on the institution's practices and policies, attends to the emergency. The team will perform life saving measures, including CPR, in order to re-establish both cardiac and pulmonary function. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation may be withheld in some circumstances. One is if the patient has a do not resuscitate (\\"no code\\") order, such as in a living will. Another is if the patient, family member, individual with power of attorney privileges over the patient, or other surrogate decision maker for the patient, makes such a request of the medical staff. Surrogate decision makers are considered in a hierarchy: legal guardians with health care authority, individual with power of attorney for health decisions, spouse, adult children, parents, and adult siblings. A third situation is one in which the medical staff deems that CPR will be of no clinical benefit to the patient. This includes, among other cases: a patient in severe septic shock and/or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome whose organ damage cannot be contained and reversed any longer, one who has had an acute stroke that has irreversibly damaged vital brain functions needed for life beyond repair (i.e., in the brain stem), or who has advanced and incurable metastatic cancer, and one with severe pneumonia which is no longer treatable with assisted ventilation methods and medication, which all have very little or no realistic probability of success. There is also a low probability of success for patients with severe hypotension that resulted from shock or severe illness or injury, and has not responded to treatment (and which was not induced), severe cases of acute or chronic kidney failure or end stage kidney disease (where dialysis and other renal replacement therapies either are no longer working or were not adequate, and where a transplant either cannot be found or is not an option), end-stage AIDS and its accompanying severe opportunistic illnesses (which are not responding to antiretroviral and drug therapy and/or the white blood cell count is too low), or those who are older than about 70 and/or homebound (where they and/or their guardians, instead of a DNR order, have authorized such half measures and the law permits it). A patient may request, in an advance directive, to prohibit certain responses, including intubation, chest compression, electrical defibrillation, or ACLS. This is referred to as a partial code or partial resuscitation and such resuscitation \\"commonly violates the ethical obligation of nonmalfeasance\\". It is regarded as medically unsound because partial interventions are \\"often highly traumatic and consistently inefficacious\\". Ethics The practice is \\"controversial from an ethical point of view\\", as it represents a violation of a patient's trust and right \\"to be involved in inpatient clinical decisions\\". In a position paper, the American Nurses Association states that \\"slow codes are not ethical\\". Policy and legislation Some medical services centres have instituted policy banning the practice. In 1987, New York became the first state in the United States to effectively end the practice by enacting legislation to require medical staff to honour a patient's refusal of cardiopulmonary resuscitation or a do not resuscitate order, and to grant civil and criminal immunity to those who do so or those who perform CPR without knowledge of the order.

Johnson-Sirleaf is Africa's first female president. Synopsis The film opens with journalist Siatta Scott Johnson's narration over Johnson-Sirleaf's inauguration on 16 January 2006. Among the distinguished guests in attendance are the then first lady of the USA Laura Bush, secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, and South African president Thabo Mbeki. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is the first ever freely elected female head of state in Africa. Momentarily archive footage is shown of events in Liberia during the 14 year civil war‚Äîscenes of public executions, child soldiers and maimed victims‚Äìscenes reoccurring briefly throughout the documentary. Then the president's cabinet is shown, Sirleaf appoints women in high administrative posts dubbed ‚Äúthe Iron Ladies‚Äù; Beatrice Munah Sieh is appointed the national chief of police, Antoinette Sayeh is appointed the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Commerce too are women. Johnson- Sirleaf discloses the disadvantaged position of Liberia, having inherited weak institutions as a result of the civil war for instance; the ministry of finance is systematically corrupt and only has a very small budget, and the police lack basic resources such as weapons. Concerning corruption, Johnson- Sirleaf intends to have zero tolerance. External footage of the legacy of former president Charles Taylor‚Äôs civil war is shown. Johnson-Sirleaf laments that Taylor loyalists are a constant threat to the stability of Liberia. Siatta Scott Johnson investigates public opinion with regard to the two governments and finds a divided sentiment between the people. In her efforts to make inclusive decisions, Johnson-Sirleaf meets with former rebel leaders and other opposition leaders at state of the nation meetings. In spite of her efforts towards inclusiveness Edwin Snowe, who was elected spokesperson for the House of Representatives on the same day Johnson-Sirleaf took office, is seen as an outspoken critic of the president, relentlessly seeking political allies to call for the president‚Äôs impeachment. Antoinette Sayeh travels to Washington DC to speak at the World Bank Headquarters on Liberian‚Äôs outstanding debt, $3.7 billion owned to creditors such as the IMF, The World Bank and the USA, the latter being the oldest bilateral partner due to their historical ties. The debt is a deterrent to the country‚Äôs ability to raise new financing from multi-lateral institutions. Back in Liberia Johnson-Sirleaf personally responds to angry mobs of workers and reformed soldiers, including Armed Forces of Liberia soldiers who were forced out of work due to the peace agreement, demanding higher salaries and pensions respectively by speaking candidly on the government‚Äôs limitations, instead of making the typical empty political promises. Towards the end of her first year as president and influx of Chinese investment is made explicit, the film shows a montage of infra- structures built by the Chinese, the new partnership is marked by an official visit form president Hu Jintao. Meanwhile Condoleezza Rice representing the USA at the Liberia partners‚Äô forum 2007, announces a cancellation of the $391 million debt. This becomes the most important achievement of Johnson-Sirleaf‚Äôs first year in office. The film concludes on a positive note, with Johnson- Sirleaf‚Äôs voice commentary over images of her waving at the crowd during open presidencies, juxtaposed with images of women chanting and cheering for the president. Historical context Historically, in the 1980s Johnson-Sirleaf challenged the military regime of dictator Samuel Doe. She sent $10 000 to Charles Taylor to support the infamous warlord‚Äôs rebellion, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL). Her support of Taylor was tactic, Taylor claimed his aim was to invade Monrovia to remove Samuel Doe from office and avenge the death of hundreds of people from the Gio and Mano ethnic groups. In a turn of events it became apparent that Taylor wanted to take over Liberia, consequently this split the NPFL into three different factions; forces supporting Taylor, forces supporting Price Yormi and forces loyal to Doe. Charles Taylor was responsible for a civil war more destructive than Samuel Doe‚Äôs regime ever was. Although Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf has since apologized for her ‚Äúmisjudgment‚Äù and said that ‚Äúwhen the true nature of Mr. Taylor‚Äôs intentions became known, there was no more impassioned critic or strong opponent to him in a democratic process‚Äù. Doe was later killed on September 9, 1990 by Johnson‚Äôs forces. Afterwards, no particular rebel group was strong enough to fill the political vacuum. The bloody conflict raged until 1996, when the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) brokered a peace accord and set elections for 1997. Taylor won the elections with 75% of the vote. Despite this temporary peace, civil war broke out again as opposition groups began to fight to oust Taylor from government. Liberia‚Äôs second civil war ended in 2003 with Taylor‚Äôs indictment by a UN-backed court and subsequent exile to Nigeria. At the end of 14 years of civil war, roughly three quarters of the population lives on less than $1 a day, and as much as 85% of the Liberian population is unemployed, this is the situation that Johson-Sirleaf‚Äôs government inherited. Reviews The film received generally positive reviews, with the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes showing 56% positive and a rating of 3.5/5 from 232 reviews. Richard Propes of the Independent Critic felt that ‚Äú'Iron Ladies of Liberia' is an insider's portrait of the president...that is both its strength and its greatest weakness. While 'Iron Ladies of Liberia' was made with Sirleaf Johnson's cooperation, it often feels like an intentionally drawn portrait meant to show her in the most positive light possible.‚Äù Probes concludes that ‚Äú'Iron Ladies of Liberia' does feel, at times, out of balance. While the filmmaker, an acknowledged acquaintance of the president, essentially plays observer for Sirleaf Johnson's first year of leadership, what it lacks is a more holistic look at Sirleaf Johnson and the nation she's leading.‚Äù Angus Wolfe Murray of Eye for Film offers a review with different point of view: It‚Äôs OK that it doesn‚Äôt cover all the problems, because it shows the ones Ellen has to deal with: endemic corruption, a demobilized army on strike, chaos and disorder in the streets, the manipulations of the old political elite, still hanging on to power with their embezzled riches. It doesn‚Äôt show the fishermen in dugout canoes, paddling over high waves to brave the ocean, or the plight of over half a million returning refugees [‚Ä¶] it doesn‚Äôt need to. Liberia is too much for most people to grasp‚Ä¶. It tells you enough about the problems to get you thinking. The consensus at whydemocracy.net parallels this sentiment in that ‚Äúrebuilding a nation after 14 years of civil war is not easy. The people are longing to for change but the government can only deliver after going through the hurdles of the international bureaucracy[‚Ä¶]. The movie teaches the viewer to appreciate not only the hard work of Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf but of new governments everywhere‚Äù. Scholar and activist Obioma Nneaemeka identifies an emerging feminist engagement particular to African countries that is evident in this film. Nneameka names this specific form of feminism as ‚Äúnego-feminism‚Äù where the prefix, nego, signifies negotiation and the elimination of unyielding self-righteousness, or ‚Äúno ego.‚Äù In this respect, this feminist engagement is deeply rooted in humility without seeming docile. Nnaemeka explains that this feminist practice ‚Äúknows when, where, and how to detonate patriarchal land mines; it also knows when, where, and how to go around negotiate with or negotiate around patriarchy in different contexts.‚Äù To that end, nego-feminism is fundamental to Johnson-Sirleaf political manoeuvres. Film critic Astride Charles commends the documentary for ‚Äúrejuvenat[ing the]discussion about international monetary policy and the way in which Africa‚Äôs societal and economic problems are framed. Instead of myopically focusing on abject poverty within Africa, the film probes some reasons why African nations do not prosper from their own natural resources.‚Äù Further Charles notes that the film ‚Äúalso gives an extensive insight into leadership and gender dynamics within African countries. Through the tangibility of a documentary, it conveys promise for African countries under neo-colonial conditions.‚Äù Accolades *The Iron Ladies of Liberia was named the best feature film by a woman director at the 15th annual African Diaspora Film Festival.

The Georgian Orthodox Church had the 300 Aragvians and those who fought and died in the battle canonized as martyrs in 2008.  History  The 300 Aragvians were part of the contingent raised from the highland districts on the Aragvi river which saw action under Prince Royal Vakhtang of Georgia, on the approaches of the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, on 11 September 1795. The heavy fighting, unfolding in the fields of Krtsanisi and continuing in the streets of Tbilisi, saw the defeat of the aging and hopelessly outnumbered Georgian king Heraclius II at the hands of the Persian army led by Agha Muhammad Khan, and the sack of the capital. According to the Georgian accounts, the Aragvians had pledged themselves to fight to the death and stayed true to their oath. Most of them were killed, fighting the last stand at Tbilisi and giving Heraclius a means of retreat.  Memory  Monument to the 300 Aragvians in Tbilisi. The 300 Aragvian soldiers were first eulogized in his history by Prince Royal Teimuraz, himself a teenage participant of the 1795 events. The leading figures of the Georgian literature of the 19th and 20th centuries, such as Grigol Orbeliani, Ilia Chavchavadze, Iakob Gogebashvili, Vazha-Pshavela, Galaktion Tabidze, and Lado Asatiani, paid tribute to their memory and helped establish their standing as national heroes. A monument to the 300 Aragvians, authored by A. Bakradze, was erected in 1959 at the place where remnants of the graves of those who died in 1795 were unearthed. A nearby park and a bridge over the Mtkvari bear the name of the 300 Aragvians and a Tbilisi Metro station opened in 1967 was also named in their honor. On 27 June 2008, the Holy Synod of the Georgian Orthodox Church presided by Catholicos-Patriarch Ilia II canonized the \\"300 Aragvians, clergy, and laymen perished in the battle of Krtsanisi of 1795\\" as \\"holy martyrs\\", setting 11 September (NS: 24 September) as the day of their commemoration.

Inspired by the earlier Lehigh & Susquehanna Turnpike, the two toll roads connected Philadelphia and New Jersey (Delaware & Lehigh Valley communities) to Lake Erie at Buffalo, New York via the toll bridge across the Susquehanna River between Berwick and Nescopeck‚Äîthe northern terminus of the Lausanne-Nescopeck Turnpike. After the War of 1812, much of Berwick's post war growth and industrial development was because it was one of the first towns with foundries, mills and smithies that could be regularly supplied by the new wonder fuel, Anthracite coming from across the river via the Nescopeck river port from the modest mines at Jeddo, Pennsylvania. Between Nescopeck and Lausanne Landing, the Lehigh & Susquehanna Turnpike passed through the future Beaver Meadows settlement near the Jeddo works (& lands) that were the predecessor to, and inspiration of the industrial pioneers of the Beaver Meadow Railroad and Coal Company. Along its route passing through Columbia County, Luzerne County, Sullivan County, and Bradford Counties. Via the Lausanne-Nescopeck Turnpike across the river, the turnpike offered a road connecting to the Lehigh River and Lehigh Valley, and after 1818, the Lehigh Canal connecting communities serviced by the road to Allentown, Bethlehem, Easton, and via the Delaware River or Delaware Canal Bristol and Philadelphia. The turnpike was established in 1807 and completed in 1825 and provided the shortest route between Elmira and Berwick. Traffic along it mostly ceased in 1907, during the era when auto-clubs had pressed state and local governments to connect American cities and towns by a system of paved roads, in response to the explosion of interest in owning and driving \\"horseless carriages\\"‚Äîearly automobiles and motor trucks (Lorries). Tolls along the turnpike ranged from $0.03 to $0.20. The turnpike was commonly used for lime, iron, salt, and plaster (gypsum) mineral transportation by pack mule trains, and, later, wagons. After the 1826 passage of the initial Main Line of Public Works legislation created the Pennsylvania Canal System, Berwick and at several other places, the Turnpike also connected to the Pennsylvania Canal system. History The first portion of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike authorized on March 19, 1804. Starting on March 20, 1806, it was legally permitted to build turnpikes in Pennsylvania. Six people from Philadelphia and six from Lycoming County were appointed as commissioners for the company. In 1807, the company President, Managers and Company of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike Road was formed for the purpose of building a turnpike from Berwick, Pennsylvania to Elmira, New York. The state of Pennsylvania donated 400 acres to the turnpike. Construction of the turnpike started in Berwick in 1808. From here it proceeded north, reaching Loyalsock Creek in 1808, and the Painter Den property in 1809. Work on the turnpike ceased during the War of 1812 but recommenced in 1816. The turnpike reached Towanda in 1818, Bradford County in 1823, and its northern terminus in 1825. Soon after the turnpike was started, Andrew Shiner (1757-1844) was contracted to improve the turnpike, and by 1810, the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike was the first road in good condition for wagons in its part of Pennsylvania. The Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike was built by men who lived in shanties, moving along the road as it was built. Both the people who built the turnpike and those who first settled along it between 1820 and 1825 were predominantly Germans from southern Pennsylvania. However between 1840 and 1845, the area near the turnpike began to be settled by people of Irish ancestry as well. Starting in 1827, the Berwick and Towanda Turnpike Company ran stagecoaches along the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike. The stagecoaches changed every 12 miles except for the part of the turnpike that went over Red Rock Mountain. The stagecoaches left Berwick twice a day. The turnpike was closed in 1845 and changed to a public road. Starting in 1847, the road was largely succeeded by Pennsylvania Route 487, which runs near the turnpike in Rickets Glen State Park, and U.S. Route 220. From 1852 to 1907 the turnpike was a county road. Except for rare traffic from jeeps and 4-wheel drive vehicles, the turnpike has not been used since 1907. A portion of the road was referred to as \\"useless, inconvenient and burdensome\\". The turnpike is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Route The Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike started in Berwick and went north over Jonestown Mountain (Knob Mountain) to Jonestown on Huntington Creek. From there it went through Fairmount Township and Huntington Township in Luzerne County. From there, the turnpike followed a meandering and difficult route up Red Rock Mountain and passed near Ganoga Lake. It then went through Sullivan County to the community of Lopez near Loyalsock Creek. An area of the road in Sullivan County was referred to as the \\"Devil's mile\\" due to its poor condition. Upon reaching the border of Bradford County, the turnpike went over Huckleberry Mountain to Monroeton, Towanda, and Elmira. At Elmira, it connected with a plank road running from east to west. The Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike served as an extension to the Susquehanna and Lehigh Turnpike, whose terminus was at Nescopeck Falls. The turnpike was part of a larger network of turnpikes that formed a path from Philadelphia to Seneca Lake and beyond to Lake Ontario and Niagara. The Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike was always rough and muddy and contained potholes during the summer. In the winter the turnpike was icy partially due to beavers flooding the area near the turnpike. Both conditions often caused vehicles on the turnpike to become stuck. A common remedy to this was to create a corduroy road consisting of logs laid perpendicularly to the rails below them. The turnpike was also not wide enough for two vehicles, thus rendering collisions common. Additionally, at least initially, some parts of the turnpike were too steep for horses to travel up, though the turnpikes of the day often had multiple paths some of which shortened the road traveled for foot traffic, and those with longer ascents and descents along a slanted traverse for horse and pack animal traffic‚Äîwith still others, widened and improved to allow wagon traffic enabling raw materials and produce deliveries to trail heads. Financial information Tolls along the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike were less expensive for vehicles with one horse than those with two horses. Other animals carried along the turnpike were charged on a case-by-case basis depending on the type of animal. For instance, in 1807 the toll for 20 sheep was $0.04, the toll for 20 hogs was $0.06, and the toll for 20 cows was $0.12. The toll for a person riding a horse or mule was $0.03. The toll for a two- wheeled vehicle with a single horse was $0.06 and with two horses the toll was $0.08. The toll for a four-wheeled vehicle with two horses was $0.12 and for four horses it was $0.20. Tollgates were built along the turnpike to hold its revenue until the company's stock was retired. One of the tollgates was called Watson Place and was most likely located near Ganoga Lake. In 1807 the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike made $1339.07. Initially $60,000 of stock in the form of 600 shares was created for the company. Stock in the company that owned the turnpike was sold at $100 per share. 10% of this stock was payable at the time of the purchase and the rest came in installments. The Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike received a moderate amount of use, especially during the spring, when the Susquehanna River was commonly used as a method of travel to New York. Economic role While the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided some financial aid in the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, stockholders in the turnpike's company also received great expense. The turnpike did not pay off its investors. Despite this, it did improve the lives of the people near it. In 1822, the Committee on Roads, Bridges and Inland Navigation of the Senate stated that \\"The [Susquehanna and Tioga] Turnpike will afford facilities for traveling and transportation unequaled, as to extent, in the United States.\\" A primary use of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike was to move livestock from northern Pennsylvania to the more densely populated areas along the Susquehanna River. It was also used to move lime and iron northwards and to move plaster and salt southwards. Early travelers on the turnpike also included loggers. Historically mail was delivered every three days along the turnpike. Historically the turnpike gave some importance to the community of Jonestown. It also provided employment for many people and brought settlers into Columbia and Sullivan Counties. See also * Susquehanna and Lehigh Turnpike and Road Company was incorporated 1804.

She was born into a family who had left Russia for Serbia during the revolution. As a student at a Russian religious school under Metropolitan Anastasius, she spent years studying religion and maintaining the altar. Ilovaiskaya-Alberti's spiritual father in those years was the prominent Orthodox theologian priest Georgy Florovsky. With his blessing, she married the Italian diplomat Edgardo Georgie Alberti. She moved back to Russia in 1991. Biography For several years, she and her husband participated in broadcasts on \\"Radio Freedom\\" and she also became a close associate of Alexandr Solzhenitsyn. She developed close friendships with a number of leading intellectuals and religious figures, including Academician Andrei Sakharov, Alain Besan√ßon, Pope John Paul II, Malcolm Pearson, Baroness Caroline (Caroline) Cox, Vladimir Pribylovsky, Georgy Chistyakov and Natalia Solzhenitsyn. During the last twenty years of her life, Ilovaiskaya-Alberti was Chief Editor of the newspaper \\"Russian Thought\\". Prior to the fall of the Soviet Union, Russian Thought garnered a broad readership throughout the world and especially in Russia. It dealt with world events and Russian life, particularly focusing on political, social, religious and cultural aspects. The newspaper gained a following among a number of the world's leading politicians, sociologists, religious leaders, and social scientists. It was in articles in Russian Thought that Ilovaiskaya- Alberti coined the phrase \\"new Russian\\", ascribing to it the phrase's current meaning. The phrase was created as a play on nouveau riche - nuvoryus (fr. Nouveau riche - \\"new rich\\", Nouveau Russe - \\"new Russian\\"). One of Ilovaiskaya-Alberti's goals in the latter years of her life was to increase the readership of the Russian Thought newspaper in Russia itself. In June 1999, at the first International Congress of the Russian Press, Russian Thought was given by the President of Russia an award for principled reporting. Ilovaiskaya-Alberti founded the \\"Radio Blagovest\\" and \\"Christian Church and Social Channel\\"-\\"Radio Sofia\\" radio programs, which she used to conduct daily broadcasts. She viewed her primary goal as the assessment of world events in the light of the Christian faith. She was Orthodox by baptism and upbringing, but more later converted herself to Catholicism and receive a Catholic funeral. Ilovaiskaya-Alberti was also Vice President of the World Association of Russian Press (1999). She was buried in Bevagna (200 km from Rome), in the town cemetery, next to her husband and her son.

He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford that June, three months after becoming baronet, but he would have only been able to spend a few months at most in his studies, as he embarked in October of the following year on a tour of Europe with his cousin and tutor the Reverend Zacchaeus Isham. Though it was not uncommon for the young English gentry of the time to tour the continent for several months as part of their education, Sir Thomas and Zacchaeus stayed a full two and a half years, a large part of their time spent in Italy collecting art works.Isham (1875), p. 2‚Äì16.Brainard (1938), p. 55‚Äì57 & 61. Returning to Lamport, Sir Thomas contracted to marry Mary van de Bempde, the daughter of a Dutch merchant, but he died of smallpox in London on 26 July 1681 before his marriage could take place.Burdon (1960), p. 1‚Äì25.Isham (1969). He was buried several days later on 9 August in Lamport, and succeeded in the baronetcy by his younger brother Sir Justinian Isham, who became the 4th baronet. Diary Sir Thomas is remembered mainly for a diary that he wrote in Latin from 1671 to 1673 at the command of his father. It is made up largely of one-sentence entries, with occasional longer anecdotes of local newsworthy events, as relayed to the boy by visitors. His diary is noteworthy in that it provides a glimpse of the everyday life of a teenage member of the English gentry, as played out in a country estate.Brainard (1938), p. 57-60. His diary first became widely available in 1875 when it was first published, but the most readily available edition is a 1971 publication of a translation by Norman Marlow with annotations by the 12th baronet Sir Gyles Isham.Isham (1875), Marlow and Isham (1971). A portrait of Sir Thomas Isham painted about 1675 by Sir Peter Lely, about the time Thomas became baronet, hangs at Lamport Hall, and there is a reduced copy of Lely's work by Mary Beale.

The establishment of the organisation was announced on 8 January 2013. According to the Syriac Military Council, the goal of the organisation is to stand up for the national rights of and to protect Assyrians in Syria. It operates mostly in the densely populated Assyrian areas of Al-Hasakah Governorate, and is affiliated to the Syriac Union Party. On 16 December 2013, the Syriac Military Council announced the foundation of a new Military Academy named \\"Martyr Abgar\\". On December 24, the MFS released photographs showing its members in control of the Assyrian village of Ghardukah, located south of Qahtaniyah (Tirbespiy√™/Qabre Hewore). The village church had been completely destroyed by Jabhat al-Nusra, which occupied the hamlet before being expelled in mid-October during an operation launched by the People's Protection Units (YPG), in which MFS members may have participated. The Syriac Military Council established an all-female military and police unit called the Bethnahrain Women's Protection Forces in September 2015. History  Tell Brak & Tel Hamis operations (2013‚Äì14)  The MFS was a part of a YPG-led offensive against Jabhat al-Nusra and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which began on 26 December 2013 in the Tel Hamis area. The YPG and MFS were unable to hold Tell Brak and failed to capture Tel Hamis, and the offensive was called off in early January. Tell Brak was captured on February 23 in a pre-dawn raid by the YPG and the Syriac Military Council. June 2014 Syria‚ÄìIraq border offensive MFS, along with YPG forces, participated in an offensive along the Syria-Iraq border. The joint forces managed to drive out Islamic State forces after the jihadist group had taken control of Mosul and most of Nineveh Governorate during the Northern Iraq offensive. The operation led to the full control of Til-Ko√ßar.  August 2014 Sinjar offensive  The MFS, along with YPG forces and other allies, participated in an offensive against the Islamic State in the district of Sinjar in Iraq's province of Nineveh, to rescue 35,000 Yazidis in the Sinjar Mountains after the Sinjar massacre.  Khabur Valley operations (2015‚Äì16)  Syriac Military Council fighters near Tell Tamer, February 2015 Islamic State launched a series of attacks in late February 2015 against Christian villages in the northeastern Hassakeh province located in the Khabur River valley, with the ultimate goal of capturing the strategic town of Tel Tamer under control of the YPG and MFS. In early March 2015 units of the Syriac Military Council and the YPG were involved in heavy clashes in the region, notably around the villages of Tel Nasri and Tel Mghas. On 15 March 2015, the Council reported it was in control of Tel Mghas. On 11 October 2015, the Syriac Military Council became one of the founding groups in the Syrian Democratic Forces. On 31 October, the SDF launched an offensive southwards along the Khabur River. The SDF, which includes the participation of the YPG, YPJ, MFS, al-Sanadid Forces, the Liberation Brigade, and the Army of Revolutionaries, captured the town of al-Hawl on 13 November. After the capture of al-Hawl, the SDF aimed to capture the town of al-Shaddadi further south. On 16 February 2016, the Shaddadi offensive was launched by the SDF, which resulted in the SDF capture of the town and hundreds of other villages. During the offensive, ISIL released 42 Assyrian hostages they abducted in February 2015. Raqqa (2016‚Äì17) The Syriac Military Council along with the Bethnahrin Women's Protection Forces took part in the SDF's campaign to capture Raqqa from ISIL, declaring that \\"the fight against terrorism is the fight for existence of our Syriac‚ÄìAssyrian people and we cannot rest until this fight is won.\\" As of January 2017, 6 MFS fighters were killed during the Raqqa campaign. On 22 January 2017, the European Syriac Union in Brussels requested the United States and its Trump administration to provide more support for the Assyrian and Kurdish components of the Syrian Democratic Forces. The US reportedly favoured the Arab components in the SDF. On 3 April, the MFS and the HSNB reaffirmed the request for more support from the US. In late 2017, the MFS forces under Abjer Abjer participated in the offensive to eliminate the last ISIL strongholds in Deir ez-Zor Governorate.  2018  On 20 January 2018, Kino Gabriel, the spokesman for the Syria Military Council was also made the spokesman for the SDF; he was succeeded as spokesman for MFS by Abgar David. The MFS also announced their intention to fight alongside the YPG/YPJ against the Turkish military operation in Afrin in early 2018, sending troops from al-Hasakah Governorate to Afrin. The MFS fighters who were still involved in the offensive against ISIL remained in Deir ez-Zor, however, \\"because our war with ISIS didn‚Äôt end\\". On 7 February 2018 a smaller contingent of MFS fighters arrived in Afrin.  2019  The MFS fought in the Battle of Baghuz Fawqani, the last phase of the Deir ez-Zor campaign against ISIL. Syriac-Assyrian Military Council On 6 July 2019, the MFS and Khabour Guards announced the formation of the Syriac-Assyrian Military Council () in order to unify the Assyrian-Syriac military organizations within the Khabour region. The declaration said the military council would work within the political ideals of the Syriac Union Party and the Syrian Democratic Council.

Background For Bulger's article \\"The Devil and Ginger Baker\\" in Rolling Stone magazine, Bulger lived with Baker in South Africa where Baker had spent the previous decade living in seclusion. The article and the numerous hours of interviews Bulger captured on film became the premise for the film, and in the spring of 2010, Bulger returned to South Africa with a small film crew to finish making the film. It premiered at the 2012 South by Southwest Film Festival and won the Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary. The title is a reference to a sign outside his South African compound, and also indicative of Baker's combative personality displayed in the film. Reception Rotten Tomatoes gave the documentary film an approval rating of 98% based on 48 reviews; the average rating is 7.8/10. The consensus reads, \\"Free of the hagiographic overtones that dog many documentary profiles, Beware of Mr. Baker presents a clear-eyed, thoroughly gripping look at one of rock's greatest ‚Äì and most personally problematic ‚Äì musicians.\\" The film won several awards and was nominated for the 'Grierson Award' at the 2012 London Film Festival. Baker said of the film himself, \\"Some of it is very good and some of it is very annoying.\\" He elaborated that he was frustrated with the inclusion of some of the people on the film but was pleased to see Eric Clapton and Charlie Watts had taken part.

Professional wrestling style and persona  When beginning her wrestling career, and in fact, for the vast majority of it, Martinez's character, Bayley, was depicted a \\"hugger\\" coming out with multiple inflatable skydancers during her entrances as well as hugging many fans (particularly younger children) in attendance In the ring, Martinez (as Bayley) utilizes her finisher of the belly-to-belly suplex calling it the Bayley-to-Belly Suplex. Since her heel turn, however, she has started using an old finisher from her Indies days. The move is known as a arm trap headlock driver on her opponents in WWE, but it was called the Rose Plant when she was in the Indie scene. For the first time in her career, she started with depicting a hypocritical persona, as she acted like nothing had changed, with her entrance music and in-ring gear remaining intact, despite developing villainous traits and underhanded tactics. On October 4, Bayley debuted a new look, having cut her ponytail off, destroying her inflatable tube men, and using profanity against the fans in her post-match promo. She now calls herself a role model for little girls around the world.

It has a rail tunnel called Parsik tunnel. It is one of the longest and oldest tunnels in India and Asia.  History  Parsik Hill derives its name from the Parsi settlers who escaped from forced conversion to Christianity by the Portuguese. When Portuguese established their rule in Bassien (now Vasai), they asked the Parsi population to convert. Parsis asked them time to think it over thus buying time to escape to the hills near Kalyan, a jurisdiction outside the control of the Portuguese. Parsis only returned to Bassien after British established their rule. Geography The hill has wide ridge that runs north and south, paralleling the railway lines. The hill is approximately 15 square kilometres area of reserved forests, crossing into sections of both Thane and the north side of Navi Mumbai, where quarrying has removed the trees from the hill. In 1985, the highest peak rose to . Also on the top of hill stands the official residence of the Mayor of Navi Mumbai. Parsik's steep, scrub grassland hills have featured in some Bollywood movies. Ecological factors Due to the impact of quarrying and illegal housing, there is concern about the extent to which the reserved forest will remain in years to come. An ecological activist comments: \\"The hill has a huge potential for eco-tourism, given that it runs through the municipal limits of Thane and Navi Mumbai and is about 30 minutes from Mumbai. Besides trekking trails, there is also a rock-climbing centre in Mumbra.\\" The ecological balances is also being unsettled by the number of people building and living in shanties in the forest, which could result in reduction or disappearance of species of flora and fauna, including more than 100 bird species. Uses Parsik Tunnel The famous Parsik tunnel on - mainline lies in this hill. This tunnel is between and . Double Broad gauge track electrified passes through this tunnel. This reduced the distance between Thane and Diva to from formal . This tunnel is in length. This tunnel is one of the oldest tunnel in Asia. Recreational area It has been a favorite area for hikers and, since the 1960s, for rock climbers. Courses began to be conducted at Parsik Hills, having had a reputation as \\"some of the most interesting and convenient area for rock climbing\\", from the 1960s to 1980s by Darjeeling Sherpa instructors. One of the noted instructors was Nawang Gombu. Rock climbers can complete advanced climbs in one half to one day. The area, most enjoyable in the winter or monsoon season, must be accessed by cutting through groups of illegal shanties, or hutments, that occupy the hill. Quarrying The area is losing its recreational appeal. About 9% of the top of the hill has been leveled due to quarrying, which is contracted to continue until about 2017.

About 100 unauthorized temples have also been built on the hill. Chief Conservator of the Forests, R K Pole, stated that there are periodic campaigns to remove the shanties in accordance with high court orders, but the net result is that there is little effort, whether through \\"lack of administrative will and indulgence from political parties\\", to properly protect the forest land.

They are landraces consisting of working strains of dog, and some of them are the types from which the modern German Shepherd Dog was developed as a standardised breed. The landraces are not recognised by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale, but some have their own standards which are for working ability, not appearance traits.  History  Before the 1890s, any dog used for herding and protecting sheep in Germany was referred to as a \\"German shepherd dog\\". The dogs were bred solely for their working ability, with little effort to standardise a particular appearance or create a defined breed of dog. In 1899 a new formal breed was established by the Society for the German Shepherd Dog. This was selected from among the working shepherd dogs, and became the modern German Shepherd Dog breed. Many German herdsmen continued to breed their dogs for working ability rather than to the new breed standard, and their remaining non-standardised working dogs were called ' (plural with '), literally 'old-German shepherd-dog'. Under the Verein f√ºr Deutsche Sch√§ferhunde (Society for the German Shepherd Dog), the long-haired variant of the German Shepherd Dog for a long time was not accepted. This changed in 2009.Die wichtigsten Beschl√ºsse der Bundesversammlung vom 6.-7. Juni in Kassel. In: SV-Zeitung. Juli 2009. S. 437‚Äì438. Since 2010, the long-haired type has been accepted.FCI-Standard N¬∞166 - German Shepherd Dog (Microsoft Word .doc format). \\"Double coat & long and harsher outer coat\\" So shepherds, farmers, and other owners of the threatened landraces who were attempting to standardise their varieties renamed the ' ('old German shepherd dogs') umbrella term to ' ('old German herding dogs', literally 'old-German herd-dogs'). Other old landraces herding dogs, used for cattle rather than sheep, and which are not ancestors of the modern German Shepherd (including \\"'\\"-coated dogs,, cow-dogs), were also encompassed within the generic category '.  Appearance  Another east- or central-German yellow-cheek, in 1920 Today's old German herding dogs differ scarcely from the landraces of the 19th and the early 20th century. Their breed standards (when they exist) require that the animal has to be capable of herding sheep and cattle but seldom prescribe physical appearance, though it is forbidden by these registries to cross-breed them with dogs of other breeds. It is unclear to what extent these standardisation efforts are having an effect. In 2008, the German Society for the Conservation of Old and Endangered Livestock Breeds (GEH) listed these varieties as \\"extremely vulnerable\\" to extinction. ('Harz fox') ('sheep-poodle') The named landraces for which breed standards have been created are divided into sub-groups, first after the livestock they herd, in cow dogs and sheep dogs; second by region (into south-German, or east- and central-German), and more finely by coat type and other features. Most of these have no name in English; approximate translations are shown (note that German capitalises all nouns, but no adjectives, even when derived from proper nouns): *Kuhhunde, 'cow-dogs' **Westerw√§lder (referring to the Westerwald mountains) **Siegerl√§nder (referring to the Siegerland region) *Schafhunde, 'sheep-dogs' **s√ºddeutscher Typ, 'south-German type' ***s√ºddeutsche Gelbbacke, 'south-German yellow-cheek' ‚Äì black and tan ***s√ºddeutscher Schwarzer, 'south- German black' ***Tiger, 'tiger[-patterned]' ‚Äì merle-colored coat; common in south Germany, rarer elsewhere **ost- mitteldeutscher Typ, 'east- or central- German type' ***ost- bzw. mitteldeutsche Gelbbacke, 'east- or central-German yellow-cheek' ***ost- bzw. mitteldeutscher Schwarzer, 'east- or central-German black' ***ost- bzw. mitteldeutscher Fuchs, 'east- or central-German fox[-coloured]' ‚Äì reddish) ****harzer Fuchs, 'Harz fox' ‚Äì reddish sheep-dogs from the HarzBeschreibung der Altdeutschen H√ºtehunde durch die Interessengemeinschaft Altdeutsche H√ºtehunde) **zotthaariger Typ [scraggy type] ‚Äì long and raw-coated dogs similar to the Old English Sheepdog or Briard breeds ***Strobel [lit.

Some of them became part of the modern German Shepherd Dog breed, while others became extinct in the course of time. The ('Pomeranian sheep-dog') and the ('herding spitz') were also counted among Old German herding dogs. They became extinct in the second half of the 20th century. The Pomeranian landrace was used to strengthen the Great Pyrenees, the Polish Tatra Sheepdog, the Kuvasz and similar now-standardised breeds. It is assumed that the last of the herding spitz landrace, which were mostly white and medium-sized,in 1951 were stated 57 centimetres at the withers and a weight of 23 kg for male dogs. became part of the foundation stock of the White Shepherd breed.

She was introduced in the 2004 action game Ninja Gaiden, where she is a demon/human hybrid who serves as a supporting non-playable character and an ally of the protagonist Ryu Hayabusa. Rachel is playable in Ninja Gaiden Sigma and Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 (including their Plus ports for the PlayStation Vita), as well as in Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate, Dead or Alive 5 Last Round, and Dead or Alive 6, and as a guest character in Musou Orochi 2 Special and Warriors Orochi 3 Hyper. The character has been mostly well received, especially noted for her sex appeal. Appearances In 2004's Ninja Gaiden, Rachel is a fiend hunter whom the game's protagonist Ryu Hayabusa meets in the Holy Vigoor Empire, where she is on a mission to destroy the fiends, as well as find her missing sister, Alma, who has become a Greater Fiend. Soon after they first meet, she is captured but soon saved by Ryu. After the battle, she stays with Ayane to recover from her ordeal. She later leaves to search for Alma and follows Doku's spirit through the torn fabric of space and time. She then fights Ishtaros and Nicchae. Despite her best efforts, she is defeated and held captive again. Doku plans to use Rachel as a sacrifice for Alma's awakening. After Ryu wins, Doku is about to kill Rachel, but Alma rush in to protect her sister, taking the fatal blow, and dies in Rachel's arms. Rachel helps Ryu escape the Underworld and witnesses the battle between him and Murai. The remake Ninja Gaiden Sigma tells some the events from her perspective and shows how her actions affected the main plot. Rachel returns in Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2. In her own chapter, after Ryu and the CIA agent Sonia left Manhattan, Marbus takes over with the disappearance of the Statue of Liberty, resulting in a Fiend infestation. Rachel appears and braves through the hellish night slaying Fiends until she confronts Marbus atop a skyscraper. Rachel defeated Marbus, taking off his other horn and killing him. Rachel made her first fighting game appearance in Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate and Dead or Alive 5 Last Round, and returned to the series in Dead or Alive 6 as a post-release downloadable content character. She also appears in the crowd- fighting games Musou Orochi 2 Special and Warriors Orochi 3 (including in the game's duel mode), and in the smart phone action card game Hyakuman-nin no Ninja Gaiden. „Äå100‰∏á‰∫∫„ÅÆNINJA GAIDEN„ÄçÁîªÈù¢ÂÜôÁúü„Å®ÂÖ±„Å´„Ç≤„Éº„É†„ÅÆÊµÅ„Çå„ÇÑ„Éê„Éà„É´„Ç∑„Çπ„ÉÜ„É†„Çí„ÉÅ„Çß„ÉÉ„ÇØ, 4Gamer.net, 2012/09/12.

Design, gameplay and promotion Momiji's models at Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 E3 2009 exposition Team Ninja's Yosuke Hayashi said that when they \\"were designing new features for Ninja Gaiden Sigma based on feedback from users, the number one request was - make Rachel playable!\\" This happened even despite the original director and Team Ninja's first boss Tomonobu Itagaki's stance against making Rachel, and the female characters in general, playable in Ninja Gaiden, which was carried into Ninja Gaiden Black and the original Ninja Gaiden II. He also said in 2007: \\"Obviously, we love the character Rachel, and within the Ninja Gaiden world she plays a really important part, and I'm glad that she's as popular as she is.\\" In 2009, Yosuke called her \\"a very important part of Team Ninja's games, now and in the future.\\" Dead or Alive 6 director and producer Yohei Shimbori said he is \\"personally keen\\" to include Rachel as DLC in this game. Eventually, Rachel was announced to be part of Season 3 Pass DLC. Regarding the process of turning Rachel into a playable character for Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Hayashi (who directed the game), stated: \\"As you know our goal with [Ryu] Hayabusa is to make the coolest action game character. So what we're saying now is that if Hayabusa is the coolest male action-game character, and the best-controlling, fastest action-game character, then let's make Rachel the best female action-game character. As you know, there are other action games coming out for PS3 with female lead characters, but I can guarantee you that Rachel is going to kick their asses. We've tweaked everything so that she plays differently than Hayabusa, but is still fast and controllable and feels‚ÄîI don't have a better way to put it‚Äîfemale. Her actions aren't as calculated and aren't as efficient as Hayabusa's. She has a certain elegance to her that's explicitly female, and so just going in there and playing with her and seeing how she controls, it's obvious that we're going to have a really great character on our hands.\\" A female motion capture actor was employed to create the character's movement.Ninja Gaiden Sigma Preview for PS3 from 1UP.com (article unavailable, mirrored here ). Sigma 2 animation director Sosuke Wakamatsu said they wanted Rachel to be \\"sexy and powerful\\". In Ninja Gaiden Sigma, she is playable for about 20% of the game in her own extra missions, including one in the demo version of the game, Rachel is controlled in a similar way as Ryu but has different attacks and animations and wields the Great Hammer, a powerful weapon designed to eliminate fiends. She can also use a grappling weapon resembling Scorpion's projectile and Link's hookshot, and use sorcery to create a powerful shockwave. The player is able to customize the character's defensive and offensive capabilities by swapping her earrings, which works in similar way as with Ryu's amulets. The game also allows the player to change Rachel's unlockable hairstyles, including long- and short-haired brunette options. Downloadable content (DLC) for Sigma includes a set of survival mode missions called \\"Rachel Master\\" and coming with an additional hairstyle. Her addition was the most publicized new feature in the game. In Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus, Rachel gains several alternate costumes, such as a business suit. In Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, she is also a playable character, wearing the same \\"S&M-style; leather outfit\\" as she did in the original version of the first game as well as some new alternate costumes available via DLC and in Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus, including one as part of GameStop's pre-order bonuses.

Reception GamesRadar's Ben Schroder predicted that \\"buxom femme fatale Rachel\\" would be \\"perhaps the biggest selling point\\" of Ninja Gaiden Sigma and the website's Mikel Reparaz described her as one of defining characters of the post-2004 Ninja Gaiden games. Eurogamer's Rob Fahey opined that Rachel's mission in Sigma were so interesting that they addition is \\"arguably the biggest headline feature after the graphical upgrades.\\" Gavin Ogden of Computer and Video Games (CVG) also agreed with this sentiment, calling her \\"one of the biggest draws to Sigma for those who hammered the Xbox version to death,\\" including himself, and praising Rachel for her gameplay traits; CVG's very positive (9/10) review stated that in the headline the \\"sweet\\" addition of Rachel \\"brought sexy back to the hardest ninja game ever.\\" In a similarly rave (also 9/10) review by GameSpot, Kevin VanOrd wrote \\"the biggest addition is that Rachel is a new playable character. She's a badass buxom babe who (...) may be top-heavy, but she still manages a good number of terrific moves.\\" In their review, PSU.com too stated that \\"the biggest addition in Sigma is the ability to play as Rachel herself,\\" adding that \\"despite the gameplay with Rachel being a tad stark, watching her gracefully end an enemy‚Äôs life is more than satisfying.\\" Less impressed with Rachel, but not the game overall (a nearly-perfect review score of 9.3), Chris Roper of IGN opined her levels were \\"a decent addition, but they're not fantastic\\" as \\"she's not as fun as Ryu;\\" reviewing Sigma Plus, IGN's Jack DeVries likewise called her \\"a fun, though less exciting, foil to Ryu.\\" Rachel has been often regarded as one of the sexiest female characters in video games. As such, she topped the countdown of \\"gamer babes\\" by GameTrailers in 2007, ranked third on the list of top \\"video game chicks\\" by ActionTrip that same year,Uros \\"Vader\\" Pavlovic, AT's Top 10 Video Game Chicks , ActionVault, September 7, 2007. and was included among the top nine \\"video game vixens\\" by Maxim in 2009.

It was first proposed by Sir Chhotu Ram, a rural leader and politician in pre- independence India as a form of peasant-alliance. The theory was later used by Charan Singh in the 1970s as a part of his Kisan-Politics to break the monopoly of Indian National Congress in Uttar Pradesh. He subscribed to this theory that Ahirs, Jats, Gurjars and Rajputs are of the same social and racial group, the Kshatriya. Aims and objectives The backward castes are prosperous throughout the state of Uttar Pradesh and constitute the mid-strata of the village social structure. Their social conditions largely correspond to their economic position, better than the Scheduled Castes and nearer to the higher castes. AJGAR emerged to gain political power in the state. Political outcome In Western Uttar Pradesh, the wealth and power of AJGAR alliance increased during the Green Revolution period, but the AJGAR formula failed to gain widespread support. However, later in 1989, the leader V. P. Singh used the AJGAR cluster successfully to conjoin the Other Backward Classes and Rajputs.

Originally constructed as the United States Navy Evarts-class destroyer escort DE-524, she served in the Royal Navy from 1943 to 1946. Construction and transfer The ship was laid down as the unnamed U.S. Navy destroyer escort DE-524 by the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts, on 14 August 1943 and launched on 24 September 1943. The United States transferred the ship to the United Kingdom under Lend-Lease on 23 December 1943. Service history The ship was commissioned into service in the Royal Navy as HMS Mounsey (K569) under the command of Lieutenant Frank Alexander John Andrew, RN, on 24 December 1943, the day after her transfer. She served on escort duty, protecting convoys in the North Atlantic Ocean as well as Arctic convoys carrying equipment and supplies to the Soviet Union. She also operated in support of the Allied invasion of Normandy in the summer of 1944. On 2 November 1944, Mounsey was escorting Convoy RA-61 in the Barents Sea outbound from the Soviet Union when the German submarine U-295 damaged her with a G7es - known to the Allies as \\"GNAT\\" - acoustic torpedo, forcing her to return to the Kola Inlet for temporary repairs. Once those repairs were complete, she departed the Soviet Union with Convoy RA-62 and returned to the United Kingdom for permanent repairs,uboat.net Ships hit by U-boats: HMS Mounsey (K 569) after which she returned to service. At 2300 hours on 10 May 1945, just after the end of World War II, Mounsey accepted the surrender of the German submarine U-1023, which held the distinction of being the last German submarine to sink an Allied warship during the war, off Land's End. The submarine later made a well- publicised tour of British ports. Early in 1946, Mounsey steamed to the United States, arriving at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 7 February 1946. The Royal Navy returned her to the U.S. Navy there on either 25 or 27 February 1946 (sources vary). Disposal Mounsey officially was declared not essential to the defense of the United States on 6 March 1946, and the U.S. Navy struck her from its Naval Vessel Register on 28 March 1946. She was sold to the North American Smelting Company of Philadelphia on 8 November 1948 for scrapping, which was completed on 9 November 1948.

Despite being immersed in the literary sphere for many years, Picasso did not produce any writing himself until the age of 53. In 1935 he ceased painting, drawing and sculpting, and committed himself to the art of poetry; which in turn was briefly abandoned to focus upon singing. Although he soon resumed work in his previous fields, Picasso continued in his literary endeavours and wrote hundreds of poems, concluding with The Burial of the Count of Orgaz in 1959. Involvement with literature Guillaume Albert Apollinaire calligram Arriving in Paris at the dawn of the 20th century, Picasso soon met and associated with a variety of modernist writers. Poet and artist Max Jacob was one of the first friends Picasso made in Paris, and it was Jacob who helped the young artist learn French. Jacob let a poverty-stricken Picasso share his room (and bed) for a period before Picasso moved to Le Bateau-Lavoir. Through Max Jacob, Picasso met one of the most popular members of the Parisian artistic community; writer, poet, novelist, and art critic Guillaume Apollinaire, who encouraged the new-wave of artists to \\"innovate violently!\\" Picasso was the focus of Apollinaire's first important works of art criticism‚Äîhis 1905 pieces on Picasso also provided the artist with his earliest major coverage in the French press‚Äîand Picasso highly treasured Apollinaire's gift of the original manuscript of his outrageous pornographic novel Les Onze Mille Verges, published in 1907. American art collector and writer of experimental novels, poetry and plays, Gertrude Stein was the artist's first patron. Picasso attended gatherings at Stein's Paris home, with regular guests including high-profile writers such as James Joyce, Ernest Hemingway, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Andr√© Salmon was another poet, art critic and writer associated with Picasso. Salmon organized the 1916 exhibition where Les Demoiselles d'Avignon was first shown. The artist also collaborated with poet Pierre Reverdy, with whom he later produced a book of poems Le Chant des Morts (The Song of the Dead), a response to the barbarity of war; novelist and poet Blaise Cendrars; and Jean Cocteau, who wrote the scenario of the Parade ballet for which Picasso designed sets and costumes. Photographer Brassa√Ø, who was well acquainted with Picasso, said that no one ever witnessed the artist with a book in his hand. Some who knew him said that the artist read after dark, though critic and author John Golding speculates it is more likely that Picasso \\"absorbed information listening to the conversation of his writer friends and other intellectuals.\\" Picasso was heavily involved with the production of literary works; over the course of his career, he illustrated around fifty books and provided maybe a hundred more with dust jackets, frontispieces and vignettes. Works 1935‚Äì1959 Early works In 1935 Picasso's wife Olga Khokhlova left him. In the autumn he left Paris for the relative isolation of le Ch√¢teau de Boisgeloup in Gisors. According to friend and biographer Roland Penrose, at first, Picasso did not divulge what he was jotting down in the little note-books which he hid when anyone entered the room. Some of Picasso's first poetical explorations involved the application of coloured blobs to represent objects. He soon gave up this approach and focused upon words; his early attempts feature a strong use of visual images and used an idiosyncratic system of dashes of differing lengths to break the text. Picasso quickly abandoned punctuation altogether, explaining to Braque: > \\"Punctuation is a cache-sexe which hides the private parts of literature.\\" In a 1935 letter to her son, Picasso's mother said: \\"They tell me that you write. I can believe anything of you. If one day they tell me that you say mass, I shall believe it just the same.\\" That same year Andr√© Breton wrote about Picasso's poetry for the French artistic and literary journal Cahiers d'Art, wherein Breton exclaimed that: \\"Whole pages appear in bright variegated hues like a parrots' feathers.\\" Penrose describes how \\"..words have been applied as a painter uses colour from his brush.\\" > listen in your childhood to the hour that white in the blue memory borders > white in her very blue eyes and piece of indigo of sky of silver the white > white traverse cobalt the white paper that the blue ink tears out blueish > its ultramarine descends that white enjoys blue repose agitated in the dark > green wall green that writes its pleasure pale green rain that swims yellow > green... > -Excerpt from early Picasso poem Over a six-week period in the spring of 1936, Picasso sent a series of letters to his \\"closest confidant and devoted friend\\", poet and artist Jaime Sabart√©s. Penrose notes that \\"such frequent letter-writing was so unusual as to be disquieting, and a certain sign of restlessness.\\" On 23 April Picasso wrote to Sabart√©s, announcing that \\"from this evening, I am giving up painting, sculpture, engraving, and poetry so as to consecrate myself entirely to singing.\\" Four days later, however, Picasso wrote \\"I continue to work in spite of singing and all.\\" As with his paintings, Picasso's poetry can be read and interpreted in numerous ways. The majority of his poems are untitled, and apart from the occasional mention of time and place, solely the dates are given. Sabart√©s recalled how: \\"Speaking about his writings, he always tells me that what he wants is not to tell stories or to describe sensations, but to produce them with the sound of the words; not to use them as a means of expression but to let them speak for themselves as he does sometimes with colours..\\" Dream and Lie of Franco The Dream and Lie of Franco is presented in a format similar to the popular Spanish strip cartoons of the period known as aleluyas. It has been called a \\"unique fusion of words and visual imagery\\". Art historian Patricia Failing notes that Picasso, who had until this point never made any overtly political work, produced a work \\"specifically for propagandistic and fundraising purposes.\\" The Dream and Lie of Franco was intended to be sold as a series of postcards to raise funds for the Spanish Republican cause. One of the panels portrays Franco as a \\"jackbooted phallus\\", waving a sword and a flag; another depicts the dictator eating a dead horse. Other images conjured by the prose and etchings prefigure the artist's iconic Guernica ‚Äì of the final four scenes in the print, three are directly linked to Picasso's Guernica studiesThe Metropolitan Museum of Art: Dream and Lie of Franco, 1937 ‚Äì the work concluding with animals, people, and possessions in absolute disarray. :::silver bells & cockle shells & guts braided in a row :::a pinky in erection not a grape & not a fig.. :::casket on shoulders crammed with sausages & mouths :::rage that contorts the drawing of a shadow that lashes teeth :::nailed into sand the horse ripped open top to bottom in the sun.. :::cries of children cries of women cries of birds cries of flowers cries of wood and stone cries of bricks :::cries of furniture of beds of chairs of curtains of casseroles of cats and papers cries of smells that claw themselves :::of smoke that gnaws the neck of cries that boil in cauldron :::and the rain of birds that floods the sea that eats into the bone and breaks the teeth biting :::the cotton that the sun wipes on its plate that bourse and bank hide in the footprint left imbedded in the rock. :::Excerpts from Dream and Lie of Franco (1937) Golding suggests that: \\"perhaps more than any other work by Picasso, The Dream and Lie of Franco breaks down, as the Surrealists so passionately longed to, distinctions between thought, writing and visual imagery.\\" However, in his review of the etchings for The Spectator in October 1937, art historian Anthony Blunt complained that the work could not \\"reach more than the limited coterie of aesthetes.\\" Plays Picasso wrote two \\"surrealist\\" plays, Desire Caught by the Tail in the winter of 1941, followed by Les Quatre Petites Filles (The Four Little Girls) which was published in 1949. In 1952 Picasso wrote a second version of The Four Little Girls using the same title.Picasso, P., Rubin, W. S., & Fluegel, J. (1980). Pablo Picasso, a retrospective. New York: Museum of Modern Art. . P. 384. The works employ a stream of consciousness narrative style, and some critics believe that Picasso never meant for the plays to be staged, only read. Desire Caught by the Tail was first performed as a reading. Jean-Paul Sartre, Valentine Hugo and Simone de Beauvoir starred alongside Picasso, while Albert Camus directed. It was restaged in 1984 (with David Hockney acting) by the Guggenheim Museum. The Burial of the Count of Orgaz Named after a painting by El Greco, and originally published in a run of 263 copies, Picasso worked on El Entierro del Condo de Orgaz or The Burial of the Count of Orgaz from January 1957 to August 1959. Like most of Picasso's literary output, the work defies easy categorization. The text (written in coloured chalk or pencil) does not describe the scenes depicted in the engravings. Poet and friend Raphael Alberti wrote the preface for the book, stating that, \\"here is the inventor.. ..of great entangled poetry ‚Äì Pablo plants a sketch on the surface of a page and it grows into a whole population.\\" The Burial of the Count of Orgaz is the result of the Picasso's reminiscences and reflections on his homeland of Andalusia. Earthy characters appear throughout, with names like \\"Don Rat\\" and \\"Don Bloodsausage\\". > there did finally arrive the card announcing the festivities on monday night > and next morning at dawn there were fires and worms up every ass hole and > sugar palms appeared in every window -Excerpt from The Burial of the Count > of Orgaz (1959) The work has been described as \\"among the finest expressions of unpunctuated prose that have evolved from the literary avant garde.\\" Picasso's thoughts :::my grandmother's big balls :::are shining midst the thistles :::and where the young girls roam :::the grindstones whet their whistles :::‚Äî23 February 1955, for Don Jaime Sabart√©s on his saint's day :::..but what silence is louder than death says the cunt to the cunt :::while scratching the front of his anus in an elegant manner :::‚ÄîExcerpt from poem of 13 October XXXVI Besides evocations of colour, sound, smell and taste; Picasso's literary works display a certain amount of fascination with sexual and scatological behaviour. Bizarre sentences appear regularly throughout, for instance: \\"the smell of bread crusts marinating in urine\\", \\"stripped of his pants eating his bag of fries of turd\\" \\"the cardinal of cock and the archbishop of gash\\" In his study of unconscious factors in the creative process, James W. Hamilton states that some of Picasso's prose reveals \\"concerns with oral deprivation and immense cannibalistic rage towards the breast..\\" Prominent dealer and art gallery owner Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler was one of the first supporters of Pablo Picasso and the early cubists. In 1959 he recalled how: \\"Picasso, after reading from a sketchbook containing poems in Spanish, says to me: 'Poetry ‚Äì but everything you find in these poems one can also find in my paintings. So many painters today have forgotten poetry in their paintings ‚Äì and it's the most important thing: poetry.'\\" \\"Poems? There are stacks of poems lying here. When I began to write them I wanted to prepare myself a palette of words, as if I were dealing with colours. All these words were weighted, filtered and appraised. I don't put much stock in spontaneous expressions of the unconscious..\\" The artist reportedly said \\"that long after his death his writing would gain recognition and encyclopedias would say: 'Picasso, Pablo Ruiz ‚Äì Spanish poet who dabbled in painting, drawing and sculpture.'\\" Criticism Portrait of Gertrude Stein, 1906, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. In a 1935 letter to a friend Stein stated: \\"He writes poetry, very beautiful poetry, the sonnets of Michelangelo.\\" Later, however, upon meeting with the artist at a gallery, Stein's attitude had apparently changed: \\"..ah I said catching him by the lapels of his coat and shaking him.. ..'it is all right you are doing this to get rid of everything that has been too much for you all right all right go on doing it but don't go on trying to make me tell you it is poetry' and I shook him again.\\" Stein's partner, Alice B. Toklas wrote in May 1949: \\"The trouble with Picasso was that he allowed himself to be flattered into believing he was a poet too.\\" Writer Michel Leiris compared the artist's literary output to Joyce's Finnegans Wake, stating that Picasso was: \\"..an insatiable player with words. [Both Joyce and Picasso] displayed an equal capacity to promote language as a real thing.. ..and to use it with as much dazzling liberty.\\" Influence California Poet Laureate Juan Felipe Herrera was inspired to write about his youth by Picasso's Trozo de Piel or Hunk of Skin (written in Cannes on 9 January 1959), the resulting work appearing in Herrera's 1998 collection of English and Spanish poems Laughing Out Loud, I Fly.

Intervals were described in 1970 by F. E. Allen and J. Cocke. Interval graphs are integral to some algorithms used in compilers, specifically data flow analyses. The following algorithm finds all the intervals in a graph consisting of vertices N and the entry vertex n0, and with the functions \`pred(n)\` and \`succ(n)\` which return the list of predecessors and successors of a given node n, respectively.

Each interval can in turn be replaced with a single node, while all edges between nodes in different intervals in the original graph become edges between their corresponding nodes in the new graph. This new graph is called an interval derived graph. The process of creating derived graphs can be repeated until the resulting graph can't be reduced further. If the final graph consists of a single node, then the original graph is said to be reducible. References * cites the notion to two papers: F. E.

Paul Wonnacott was also the author of two textbooks, and served as a member of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George H.W. Bush from 1991 until January of 1993. Biography He was born in London, Ontario, in 1933, son of Gordon Wonnacott and Muriel Johnston Wonnacott. He received his B.A. in Honors History from the University of Western Ontario in 1955, and his Ph.D. in Economics from Princeton University in 1959. He was on the economics faculty of Columbia University as an instructor and then assistant professor from 1958 to 1962. He was an associate professor and then professor at the University of Maryland (1962-92). From 1994 until 2000, he was the Alan Holmes Professor at Middlebury College. He was a fellow at the Brookings Institution (1957-58), where he wrote his thesis on the Canadian experience with exchange-rate flexibility in the 1950s, which was later published as The Canadian Dollar. University of Toronto Press, 2nd. ed., 1965.. He was on the research staff of the Canadian Royal Commission on Banking and Finance (1962). His major service for the U.S. Government was on the Council of Economic Advisers where he was a senior staff economist (1968-70), working primarily on international finance. The International Monetary Fund system of pegged-but-flexible exchange rates was under severe strain, and he studied the possibility of greater exchange rate flexibility. He returned to the Council as a member, 1991-93. He also served briefly with the Federal Reserve, the State Department, and the U.S. Treasury. U.S.-Canadian Free Trade When Free Trade Between The United States And Canada: The Potential Economic Effects appeared, it attracted considerable attention in the Canadian press, including major articles in the Financial Post, the Toronto Star, and the Globe and Mail. The Globe‚Äôs coverage‚Äîtaking up most of a page (Sept. 25, 1967, p. 26)‚Äîincluded a report by Bruce MacDonald, who referred to the Wonnacott study as ‚ÄúA book that undertakes the broadest, most intensive economic study of the issue that has repeatedly divided Canada since it became a nation 100 years ago.‚Äù He noted that the past controversy ‚Äúhas usually been waged in political terms that bore little or no relation to economic facts.‚Äù The Wonnacott study is an ‚Äúeffort to fill this vacuum.‚Äù This study contributed to major changes in Canadian attitudes toward free trade with the United States in the two decades prior to the negotiation of the free trade pact. These changes were reflected in a study by the Economic Council of Canada, Looking Outward (1975),Ottawa: Queen's Printer, 1975. which ‚Äúbuilt upon the work of economists such as the Wonnacott brothers, John Young, Ted English, Harry Johnson, and others who had long contended that the small Canadian Economy could not afford to isolate itself from the world economy by maintaining high barriers to imports.‚ÄùMichael Hart, with Bill Dymond and Colin Robertson, Decision at Midnight; Inside the Canada-US Free Trade Negotiations.

Textbooks During the 1960s and 1970s, widely accepted Keynesian theory was under vigorous attack from Milton Friedman and other monetarists. Intermediate textbooks at that time were heavily Keynesian, although a few were written from the monetarist (classical) viewpoint. Each side often presented the opposing view as a straw man, to ease its demolition. In his intermediate macroeconomics text, which first appeared in 1974,Paul Wonnacott, Macroeconomics. Homewood, Ill.:Richard D. Irwin, 1974. Third ed., 1984.

In 1886, she established a winery in St. Helena, selling it in 1894. Its name changed to Lombarda Cellars and is now Freemark Abbey Winery. Early life Tychson was born in 1855, into a wealthy family from Pennsylvania. John Marlin (d. 1878) and Eliza (n√©e Bower; 1823-1860), her parents, had also lived in Astoria, Oregon; Tychson was one of 8 children. She grew up in Philadelphia before the family moved to San Lorenzo. At the age of 8, her mother died and her father remarried Eliza's sister. Tychson's father and aunt were influential from a young age in her development as an independent, young women. Career Freemark Abbey Winery today Following the death of her sister Catherine in 1874, she married the Danish farmer, John C. Tychson. Their first child, Annette, was born in 1878. In 1879, the young family moved to Denmark, where John took care of some affairs, before returning to the United States. They moved to the Napa Valley in northern California, where they purchased a 147 acres of land just north of St. Helena from William James Sayward, a sea captain. They planted the vineyards in 1881, establishing Tychson Cellars five years later. She lost her tuberculosis- afflicted husband to suicide at the Newland House Hotel in Oakland, leaving her to look after two children and the estate. According to an 1890 report by the California Board of State Viticultural Commissioners, the Tychson Winery cultivated Zinfandel, Riesling and Burgundy; it also noted that the estate had expanded to 65 acres of wine grapes, of which 55 acres were in bearing. In 1893, Tychson lost some 10% of her grapes to the parasite phylloxera. As a result, she sold the winery in the following year to foreman Nels Larson; Larson sold it to Anton Forni in 1898, who renamed it Lombarda Cellars after the region of Italy that he hailed from, a name it retained until it went out of business. Tychson, who never remarried, bought a white house opposite the vineyard. She was described as \\"an intrepid Victorian widow who could often be spotted riding\\". She died in 1939. Upon her death, the estate was sold to Charles Freeman, Mark Foster, and Abbey Ahern, giving it its name \\"Freemark Abbey\\". Tychson was remembered in a Napa County Historical Society temporary exhibition at the site, ‚ÄúHarvesting History,‚Äù which documented the early viticulture of the Napa Valley.

Biography Jim Mees was born in Mahopac, New York on August 10, 1955. He became friends with designer Vera Neumann, whom he later credited as being the inspiration behind his design career. He first met her at the age of 12 and later gained a job with her, drawing images which were turned into designs for clothing. He gained a bachelor's degree in theatre and lighting design from Carnegie Mellon University in 1977. During his final year, he was selected by the Seattle Repertory Theater to work on George Abbott's final Broadway production Music Is. After graduation, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in design. In 1982, he gained his first job on a television series with the CBS series Gloria. He went on to work with a dozen more television series including three Star Trek series, The Next Generation, Voyager and Enterprise. Patrick Stewart said of Mees' 14 years working on the Star Trek franchise, \\"He made you feel hopeful about the future because you could see that good taste was still present in features of design 400 years from now and hadn't been completely overwhelmed by technology.\\" Mees complained of Ronald D. Moore writing scenes in which characters would pull open wall panels on the Enterprise: because the Enterprise was a stage set instead of a real ship, anything shown behind a panel would have to be designed and built separately. As a result of these complaints, these removable panels were subsequently referred to in scripts as \\"Mees panels\\".

Devotional art before the Reformation included books and images commissioned in the Netherlands. Before the Reformation in the mid-sixteenth century the interiors of Scottish churches were often elaborate and colourful, with sacrament houses and monumental effigies. Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll as a result of Reformation iconoclasm, with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings. In about 1500 the Scottish monarchy turned to the recording of royal likenesses in panel portraits. More impressive are the works or artists imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands. The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century, but it flourished after the Reformation. James VI employed Flemish artists Arnold Bronckorst and Adrian Vanson, who have left behind a visual record of the king and major figures at the court. The first significant native artist was George Jamesone, who was succeeded by a series of portrait painters as the fashion moved down the social scale to lairds and burgesses. The loss of ecclesiastical patronage that resulted from the Reformation created a crisis for native craftsmen and artists, who turned to secular patrons. One result of this was the flourishing of Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings and walls. Other forms of domestic decoration included tapestries and stone and wood carving. In the first half of the eighteenth century there was an increasing professionalisation and organisation of art. Large numbers of artists took the grand tour to Italy. The Academy of St. Luke was founded as a society for artists in 1729. It included among its members Allan Ramsay, who emerged as one of the most important British artists of the era. Devotional art A page from the Hours of James IV of Scotland Devotional art acquired from the Netherlands in the later fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries included the images of St Catherine and St John brought to Dunkeld; Hugo van Der Goes's altarpiece for the Trinity College Church in Edinburgh, commissioned by James III, and the work after which the Flemish Master of James IV of Scotland is named. There are also a relatively large number of elaborate devotional books from the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, usually produced in the Netherlands and France for Scottish patrons. These include the prayer book commissioned by Robert Blackadder, Bishop of Glasgow, between 1484 and 1492 and the Flemish illustrated book of hours, known as the Hours of James IV of Scotland, given by James IV to Margaret Tudor after 1503 and described by D. H. Caldwell as \\"perhaps the finest medieval manuscript to have been commissioned for Scottish use\\".D. H. Caldwell, ed., Angels, Nobles and Unicorns: Art and Patronage in Medieval Scotland (Edinburgh: National Museum of Scotland, 1982), p. 84. Before the Reformation in the mid-sixteenth century the interiors of Scottish churches were often elaborate and colourful. Particularly in the north-east of the country there were highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Kinkell from 1524 and Deskford from 1541.I. D. Whyte and K. A. Whyte, The Changing Scottish Landscape, 1500‚Äì1800 (London: Taylor & Francis, 1991), , p. 117. Monumental effigies in churches were usually fully coloured and gilded and dedicated to members of the clergy, knights and their wives. In contrast to England, where the fashion for stone-carved monuments gave way to monumental brasses, in Scotland they continued to be produced until the end of the Medieval period.R. Brydall, The Monumental Effigies of Scotland: from the Thirteenth to the Fifteenth Century (Kessinger Publishing, 1895, rpt. 2010) .K. Stevenson, Chivalry and Knighthood in Scotland, 1424‚Äì1513 (Boydell Press, 2006), , pp. 125‚Äì8. These include the very elaborate Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas and the tomb built for Alexander McLeod (d. 1528) at Rodel in Harris. Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll as a result of Reformation iconoclasm, with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings. The only significant surviving pre- Reformation stained glass in Scotland is a window of four roundels in the St. Magdalen Chapel of Cowgate, Edinburgh, completed in 1544.T. W. West, Discovering Scottish Architecture (Botley: Osprey, 1985), , p. 55. Wood carving can be seen at King's College, Aberdeen and Dunblane Cathedral. In the West Highlands, where there had been a hereditary caste of monumental sculptors, the uncertainty and loss of patronage caused by the rejection of monuments in the Reformation meant that they moved into another branches of the Gaelic learned orders or took up other occupations. The lack of transfer of carving skills is noticeable in the decline in quality when gravestones were next commissioned from the start of the seventeenth century.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488‚Äì1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 131. According to N. Prior, the nature of the Scottish Reformation may have had wider effects, limiting the creation of a culture of public display and meaning that art was channelled into more austere forms of expression with an emphasis on private and domestic restraint.N. Prior, Museums and Modernity: Art Galleries and the Making of Modern Culture (Berg, 2002), , p. 102. Portraiture James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray by Hans Eworth Around 1500, about the same time as in England, Scottish monarchs turned to the recording of royal likenesses in panel portraits, painted in oils on wood, perhaps as a form of political expression. In 1502 James IV paid for delivery of portraits of the Tudor household, probably by the \\"Inglishe payntour\\" named \\"Mynours,\\" who stayed in Scotland to paint the king and his new bride Margaret Tudor the following year.R. Tittler, \\"Portrait, politics and society\\", in R. Tittler and N. Jones, eds, A Companion to Tudor Britain (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2008), , p. 449. \\"Mynours\\" was Maynard Wewyck, a Flemish painter who usually worked for Henry VII in London.M. Belozerskaya, Rethinking the Renaissance, Burgundian Arts Across Europe (Cambridge 2002), , p. 159: J. W. Clark, 'Notes on the tomb of Margaret Beaufort,' Proceedings Cambridge Antiquarian Society, 45 (1883), pp. 267‚Äì8. As in England, the monarchy may have had model portraits of royalty used for copies and reproductions, but the versions of native royal portraits that survive are generally crude by continental standards.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 57‚Äì9. Much more impressive are the works or artists imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands, generally considered the centre of painting in the Northern Renaissance. The products of these connections included a fine portrait of William Elphinstone.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 127‚Äì9. It is one of the earliest representations of a Scottish subject to survive and was probably painted by a Scots artist using Flemish techniques.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488‚Äì1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , pp. 55‚Äì6. The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century. In his majority James V was probably more concerned with architectural expressions of royal identity. Mary Queen of Scots had been brought up in the French court, where she was drawn and painted by major European artists, but she did not commission any adult portraits, with the exception of the joint portrait with her second husband Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. This may have reflected an historic Scottish pattern, where heraldic display or an elaborate tomb were considered more important than a portrait. Portraiture began to flourish after the Reformation.R. Tittler, \\"Portrait, politics and society\\", in R. Tittler and N. Jones, eds, A Companion to Tudor Britain (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2008), , pp. 455‚Äì6. There were anonymously painted portraits of important individuals, including minatures of James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell and his wife Jean Gordon (1556). Artists from the Low Countries remained important. Hans Eworth, who had been court painter to Mary I of England, painted a number of Scottish subjects in the 1560s. He painted James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray in 1561 and two years later he painted a joint portrait of the young Darnley and his brother Charles Stuart.E. K. Waterhouse, Painting in Britain: 1530 to 1790 (Yale University Press, 5th edn., 1994), , p. 32. Lord Seton, Master of the Royal Household commissioned two portraits in the Netherlands in the 1570s, one of himself and one a family portrait. A specific type of Scottish picture is the \\"vendetta portrait\\", designed to keep alive the memory of an atrocity. Examples include the Darlney memorial portrait, which shows the young James IV kneeling at his murdered father's tomb and the lifesize portrait of the corpse of The Bonnie Early of Moray vividly showing the wounds received by James Stewart, 2nd Earl of Moray when he was killed by George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly in 1592.E. K. Waterhouse, Painting in Britain: 1530 to 1790 (Yale University Press, 5th edn., 1994), , pp. 48‚Äì9. The Bonnie Earl of Moray, anonymous \\"vendetta portrait\\" of the murdered James Stewart, 2nd Earl of Moray, 1592 (1591 Old Style) Self portrait by John Baptist Medina (c. 1698) There was an attempt to produce a series of portraits of Scottish kings in panel portraits, probably for the royal entry of the fifteen-year-old James VI in 1579, which are Medieval in form. In James VI's personal reign, Renaissance forms of portraiture began to dominate. He employed two Flemish artists, Arnold Bronckorst in the early 1580s and Adrian Vanson from around 1584 to 1602, who have left us a visual record of the king and major figures at the court. However, the Union of Crowns in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London. The result has been seen as a shift \\"from crown to castle\\", as the nobility and local lairds became the major sources of patronage.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , p. 193. By the seventeenth century the fashion for portraiture had spread down the social order to lairds such as Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and John Napier of Merchiston. The first significant native artist was George Jamesone of Aberdeen (1589/90-1644), who, having trained in the Netherlands, became one of the most successful portrait painters of the reign of Charles I. He trained the Baroque artist John Michael Wright (1617‚Äì94), who painted both Scottish and English subjects.A. Thomas, The Renaissance, in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , pp. 198‚Äì9. The Flemish-Spanish painter John Baptist Medina (1659‚Äì1710) came to Scotland in 1693 and became the leading Scottish portrait painter of his generation.M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , p. 136. Among his best known works are a group of about 30 oval bust-lengths, including a self- portrait, in Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh. He trained his son, also John, and William Aikman (1682‚Äì1731), who became the leading portrait painter of the next generation.E. K. Waterhouse, Painting in Britain, 1530 to 1790 (London: Penguin, 4th Edn, 1978), pp. 150‚Äì1. Aikman migrated to London in 1723, and from this point until the late eighteenth century, most Scottish painters of note followed him. Domestic decoration Painted ceiling from Rossend Castle, Burntisland The loss of ecclesiastical patronage that resulted from the Reformation, created a crisis for native craftsmen and artists, who turned to secular patrons. One result of this was the flourishing of Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings and walls, with large numbers of private houses of burgesses, lairds and lords gaining often highly detailed and coloured patterns and scenes, of which over a hundred examples are known to have existed. These were undertaken by unnamed Scottish artists using continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism, with elements that call on heraldry, piety, classical myths and allegory. The earliest surviving example is at the Hamilton palace of Kinneil, West Lothian, decorated in the 1550s for the then regent the James Hamilton, Earl of Arran.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488‚Äì1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 290. Other examples include the ceiling at Prestongrange House, undertaken in 1581 for Mark Kerr, Commendator of Newbattle, and the long gallery at Pinkie House, painted for Alexander Seton, Earl of Dunfermline in 1621. Records also indicate that Scottish palaces were adorned by rich tapestries, like those that depicted scenes from the Iliad and Odyssey set up for James IV at Holyrood.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), , p. 14. Some of this was undertaken by exclusive professional embroiders, but needlework was part of female education at all levels of society. Some of these tapestries were produced by noble ladies, such as the bed valances made by Katherine Ruthven for her marriage in 1551 to Campbell of Glenorchy. These are the oldest surviving examples of Scottish produced embroidery. They display the couple's initials, arms and the story of Adam and Eve. A carpet designed to cover a table may be connected to the marriage of Katherine Oliphant, which has her initials, arms, biblical verses and (perhaps as a pun on her name) an elephant. Much of the needle work of the sixteenth century has been attributed, probably erroneously, to Mary, Queen of Scots. It is thought that she did contribute to the Oxburgh Hangings while imprisoned in England.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488‚Äì1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 178. King James V in one of the Stirling Heads Although tradition of stone and wood carving in churches largely ended at the Reformation, it continued in royal palaces, the great houses of the nobility and even the humbler homes of lairds and burgesses.J. Warrack, Domestic Life in Scotland, 1488‚Äì1688: A Sketch of the Development of Furniture and Household Usage (1930, Forgotton books, reprint, 2012), pp. 76‚Äì82. The intricate lid of the fourteenth-century Bute mazer, carved from a single piece of whale bone, was probably created in the early sixteenth century.H. Fothringham, Scottish Gold and Silver Work (London: Pelican, 2nd edn., 1999), , p. 54. At Stirling Castle, stone carvings on the royal palace from the reign of James V are taken from German patterns,C. McKean, The Scottish Chateau (Sutton, 2nd edn., 2004), , p. 90. and, like the surviving carved oak portrait roundels from the King's Presence Chamber, known as the Stirling Heads, they include contemporary, biblical and classical figures.J. Dunbar, The Stirling Heads (London: RCAHMS/HMSO, 1975), , p. 21. These, and the elaborate Renaissance fountain at Linlithgow Palace (c. 1538.), suggest that there was a workshop with an established connected with the court in the early sixteenth century. James V and his successors employed a versatile French craftsman and wood carver, Andrew Mansioun, who settled in Edinburgh and trained apprentices.Michael Pearce, 'A French Furniture Maker and the 'Courtly Style' in Sixteenth-Century Scotland', Regional Furniture, 32 (2018), pp. 129-30. Some of the finest domestic wood carving is in the Beaton panels made for Arbroath AbbeyH. Scott, ed., Scotland: A Concise Cultural History (Mainstream, 1993), , p. 208. and at Huntly Castle, rebuilt for George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly in the early seventeenth century, which focused on heraldic images. Their \\"popish\\" overtones led to them being damaged by an occupying Covenanter army in 1640.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), , p. 46. From the seventeenth century, as domestic architecture for the nobility was increasingly for comfort, rather than fortification, there was elaborate use of carving in carved pediments, fireplaces, heraldic arms and classical motifs. Plasterwork also began to be used, often depicting flowers and cherubs.T. W. West, Discovering Scottish Architecture (Botley: Osprey, 1985), , p. 68. Richly carved decoration on ordinary houses was common in the period. There is also the heraldic carving, such as the royal arms at Holyrood Palace, designed by the Dutch painter Jacob de Wet in 1677. The tradition of carving also survived in work like the carved stone panels in the garden of Edzell Castle (c. 1600), the now lost carving done for Edinburgh and Glasgow universities in the seventeenth-century and in the many elaborate sundials of the seventeenth century, like those at Newbattle. Professionalisation of art capriccio by James Nories senior (1684‚Äì1757), credited with originating the tradition of landscape painting in Scotland Allan Ramsay The growing importance of royal art can be seen in the post of Painter and Limner, created in 1702 for George Ogilvie. The duties included drawing pictures of the Monarch's person, his successors and members of the royal family, for the decoration of royal houses and palaces. However, from 1723 to 1823 the office was a sinecure held by members of the Abercrombie family, not necessarily connected with artistic ability.The Laws of Scotland: Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, vol. 7 \\"The Crown\\", para 847. Many painters of the early part of the eighteenth century remained largely artisans, like the members of the Norie family, James (1684‚Äì1757) and his sons, Robert and the younger James, who painted the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were capriccios or pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes.I. Baudino, \\"Aesthetics and Mapping the British Identity in Painting\\", in A. M√ºller and I. Karremann, ed., Mediating Identities in Eighteenth-Century England: Public Negotiations, Literary Discourses, Topography (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2011), , p. 153. They tutored artists and have been credited with the inception of the tradition of Scottish landscape painting that would come to fruition from the late eighteenth century.E. K. Waterhouse, Painting in Britain, 1530 to 1790 (London: Penguin, 4th Edn, 1978), p. 293. Italy became an important point of reference for Scottish artists, with many taking the Grand Tour there to paint, sample the art and learn from Italian masters.J. Wormald, Scotland: A History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), . In 1729 there was an attempt to found a school of painting in Edinburgh as the Academy of St. Luke, named after the Renaissance Accademia di San Luca in Rome. Its president was George Marshall, a painter of still lives and portraits, and its treasurer was the engraver Richard Cooper. Other members included Cooper's student Robert Strange, the two younger Nories, the portrait painters John Alexander (c. 1690-c. 1733) and Allan Ramsay (1713‚Äì84).A. Smart, The Life and Art of Allan Ramsay (London: Taylor & Francis, 1951), p. 11. The success of the group was limited by its associations with Jacobitism, with Strange printing bank notes for the rebels.J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , p. 311. Alexander was a great grandson of George Jamesone. He studied in London and Rome, returning to Edinburgh about 1720 where he painted the Baroque The Rape of Proserpine, for the roof of a staircase at Gordon Castle and numerous portraits.E. K. Waterhouse, Painting in Britain: 1530 to 1790 (Yale University Press, 5th edn., 1994), , p. 330. Ramsay emerged as the most distinguished alumni of the academy. He studied in Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh. There he established himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility, before moving to London in 1757.\\"Allan Ramsey\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, retrieved 7 May 2012. He made occasional return visits to Edinburgh to undertake commissions for the nobility and gentry.

Early life Cass was born in Yorkshire in 1817. He received his education at the Royal Mathematical School, in Christ's Hospital school in London, UK. New Zealand He left England in 1841 on the Prince Rupert to take up survey work for the New Zealand Company, but the ship was wrecked at the Cape of Good Hope and Cass lost most of his gear. He continued his journey on the Antilla and arrived in Auckland, New Zealand, in December 1841. He helped with the survey of parts of Auckland, and then surveyed Kororareka, before laying out roads in Northland. He returned to Auckland and surveyed North Shore, and then went back to the Bay of Islands. He was laid off by the New Zealand Company towards the end of 1844 as part of their downsizing. Cass was then employed at sea and became chief mate on the brig Victoria. He was back in Northland for the Battle of Kororareka on 11 March 1845, and participated in action against Te Rauparaha in the following year. He also transported robbers to Wellington who had ambushed the Greenwood brothers of Purau. Cass returned to England in 1847 to obtain compensation for his dismissal as a surveyor. He was hired by the Canterbury Association and was made one of the assistant surveyors of Joseph Thomas. Together with Charles Torlesse, they sailed on the Bernicia to Nelson, and from there to Wellington. They reached Lyttelton Harbour on 15 December 1848. Cass undertook trigonometrical survey in the Christchurch, Lincoln and Ellesmere districts. When Thomas was sacked in January 1851 by the agent of the Canterbury Association, John Robert Godley, he became chief surveyor and held that role until his retirement in early 1867. Political career and community involvement Cass contributed much to the public life in early Canterbury. He stood for election in the Town of Christchurch electorate for the first Provincial Council on 3 September 1853. Five candidates contested the three positions, and Cass received the highest number of votes at 77. The two other successful candidates were Samuel Bealey and Richard Packer (74 and 71 votes, respectively). Charles Fooks (a brother-in- law of Guise and Joseph Brittan) and Edward Dobson were defeated (at 51 and 21 votes, respectively). Cass resigned on 12 February 1855, and Fooks was elected unopposed to the vacancy. The Canterbury Provincial Council had an Executive Council (comparable to today's cabinet), and those appointed to it were not necessarily elected members at the time. After William Hamilton resigned from the Executive Council in mid-June 1857, Canterbury's Superintendent James FitzGerald made two appointments on 29 June of that year: Cass and Richard Harman. After FitzGerald resigned in September 1857, William Sefton Moorhouse succeeded him as Superintendent in the following month, and Cass remained on the Executive Council. The elections for the second Provincial Council were held in November 1857, where six candidates stood for four positions in the Town of Christchurch electorate. Cass came fourth with 96 votes, only one vote ahead of the fifth candidate; the other successful candidates were Richard Packer (165 votes), Charles Wellington Bishop (160 votes), and Charles Fooks (152 votes). In July 1860, Cass resigned both from the Executive Council and his council membership due to ill health. He was re-appointed to the Executive Council on 10 November 1863 by the third Superintendent, Samuel Bealey, during his leadership crisis, but most of his executive (including Cass) resigned on 4 December 1863. Bealey was succeeded by Moorhouse in May 1866, and Cass was appointed to the Executive Council on 8 June 1866. Cass remained on the executive until 14 December 1866. Immediately after his departure, the Provincial Council discussed an honorarium for Cass, who had signalled his intention to retire as chief surveyor due to his chronic asthma. The Cass Pension Bill 1867 was assented to by the Superintendent in mid-January of that year, which gave Cass an annual honorarium of ¬£250. Cass went to England in 1867 and became immigration agent for the Canterbury Province, succeeding Crosbie Ward who had died in London in November 1867. Cass returned to New Zealand in the following year. He was secretary for the Canterbury Jockey Club. Family and death tramping route, which follows the Cass River On 18 September 1854, Cass married Mary Williams at St Michael and All Angels. She had arrived on the Randolph with her husband, David Theodore Williams. They looked after the Deans property in Riccarton while John Deans was back in England, but Williams died in March 1852. Mary Cass died on 24 September 1886 aged 70; she had children from her first marriage, but not from her second. After his wife's death, Cass lived with his step-son, Charles Hood Williams, until his death. Cass was confined to the house, and later to his room, due to his poor health, which was mostly caused by asthma. He was visited by Dr Thomas Hocken in 1894 for an interview, and at the time, Cass was bedridden, deaf, and repeated himself much. Cass died on 17 April 1895, and was buried next to his wife at Barbadoes Street Cemetery. Commemoration There are several geographic features in Canterbury named after Cass. The settlement of Cass is located in the Selwyn District in the Southern Alps. The Cass railway station, which for many years was the railhead whilst the Midland Line was under construction and during which the township had a population of 800, was painted in 1936 by Rita Angus; it is \\"one of New Zealand's best-loved works of art\\". The nearby Cass River was named by Julius von Haast. Cass Bay in Lyttelton Harbour and Cass Peak in the Port Hills () above Governors Bay are also named for Cass. Cass Street in the Christchurch suburb of Sydenham was formerly part of Carlyle Street, but was renamed in honour of Cass in about 1950. Cass Street in Temuka also commemorates Cass. In the early days of Sumner, the prominent rock on its beach was called Cass Rock. It was renamed Cave Rock, after the cave that is accessible during low tide, in the mid-1860s.

They were made of nearly all diecast parts. Only the wheels and tires were not metal. The box is labeled with the model provided. Note, however, that the Panhard & Levasseur on the box was the car seen on all RAMI boxes. RAMI by J.M.K. was a French company that made diecast collector vehicles mostly of classic French automobiles in 1:43 scale. The cars in the line-up represented actual vehicles in the Automobile Museum of the Ch√¢teau de Rochetaill√©e sur Sa√¥ne (Rixon 2005, p. 72). The models were made in Lure, France, from 1958 to 1969. The Acronym RAMI was an acronym for \\"les R√©trospectives Automobiles MIiniatures\\" (in English, Automobile Miniatures in Retrospect). The acronym was seen on packaging without the periods between the letters of the acronym, but on some of the vehicle bases with the punctuation. J.M.K. was a further acronym that stood for the three founding members of the company: M. Jarry, Henri Malartre and M. Koch. Though the models were often known simply as RAMI, the full name of the company was RAMI by J.M.K. Museum models This was the first RAMI model, of the taxi used to haul troops in World War I. The Renault Marne taxi was notable for being cast down the middle of the vehicle in two halves. No other RAMI models were made this way. Sometime around 1957, the decision was made to make ‚Äì in miniature ‚Äì automobiles housed in the Automobile Museum Malartre of Rochetaill√©e sur Sa√¥ne in eastern France. This was the real auto collection of Henri Malartre who also started RAMI. The concept was similar to Dugu Miniautotoys in Italy made for the Carlo Biscaretti di Ruffia Automobile Museum in Turin, from 1961 to about 1975, or Cursor Models which produced models in Stuttgart seen in the Daimler-Benz Museum from 1969 to about 1980. The first prototype RAMI vehicles were made in wood in 1958 in Villeurbanne, next to Lyon, by a Monsieur Rivoire. Production models were made in Lure of the department Haute Sa√¥ne about 175 miles northeast of Lyon, near the border with Switzerland and Germany. The founders of RAMI cars were M. Jarry who had previously worked for model maker Quiralu; H. Malartre, who had worked in the auto parts business and had collected classic vehicles; and M. Koch, who had worked previously in a weaving factory. Model details Though Johnson says models were produced up to 1980 (Johnson 1998, pp 196‚Äì197), in all, 39 different models were produced between 1958 and 1969. Many models were of veteran 'brass' era vehicles. In fact, 33 were of vehicles made before 1920. Two of the vehicles were steam (1878 Amedee Bollee and the 1892 Scotte steam wagon with large boilers) and one electric (the irresistible 1898 Hautier Taxi), 34 are representations of French vehicles with two American Fords, a Packard, and a Mercedes. RAMI 1900 Hautier Electric Taxi. Note driver's position in traditional carriage location upward to the rear. Note front entry and opening doors to the front of the vehicle. The Hautier Taxi is particularly interesting as a vehicle that is mainly a horse carriage with an electric motor. The driver sits in a makeshift seat up and behind the cab, almost in a 'stagecoach' position. Some kind of crude steering mechanism went down then to the rear wheels. To enter, one stepped up onto the front of the vehicle and entered directly forward through two opening doors ‚Äì which open on the model. RAMI models were made of diecast zamac metal alloy ‚Äì only wheels and tires were plastic (Rixon 2005, p. 72). Some early models, like the Marne Taxi are made in diecast halves joining down the middle of the car ‚Äì this faux pas was avoided on most other models. Seats and thin fenders were diecast metal on R.A.M.I. models, which is a bit rare as many diecast manufacturers of early brass era vehicles (like French Minialuxe) often use plastic. Plastic is easier to work with for 'spidery' parts such as wheel spokes, thin fenders, steering tillers, and long gearshift and brake levers (Sinclair 1979, p. 391). Occasionally, a dab of glue can be spied at the base of a lever or a tiller (Rixon 2005, p. 72). RAMI tops, even those purportedly of cloth were diecast in metal as well. Thus models were heavy, especially if one was used to handling plastic Minialuxe vehicles (Gibson 1971, 23). Early diecast collector Cecil Gibson noted the delightful features of RAMI models as early as 1971, pointing out the company's unique selection (from museum vehicles), delicate details (like spare tires and long brake and tiller levers) and whimsical features (as in 'mother-in-law' seats and parasol tops which do not cover the passengers; see Gibson 1971, pp. 20‚Äì21). Neither did RAMI shy away from odd body shapes ‚Äì whether late 1800s boilers, curved boat-tails, spare wheel covers on roofs, or the varied folds and waves of landaulet covering material (in plastic or diecast metal; see Gibson 1971, pp. 24‚Äì25, 28‚Äì29). Models often had combinations of vibrant colors, and appear much more striking in person than in photographs. Lineup This 1899 Gobron-Brillie Double Phaeton was model No 11 made by RAMI by J.M.K. The original car used a unique engine with two opposed pistons within each cylinder; engine compartment was under the rear seat. This model is a year newer than the 1898 model in the Malartre museum. Models began to be introduced in 1958 at a rate of two to four a year until production ceased in 1969. In order of year the following were the RAMI models: * 1958: 1905‚Äì1916 Renault de la Marne Taxi type AG, 1900 De dion Bouton, 1902 Motobloc tonneau, 1911 Lion Peugeot Double-pha√©ton VC3, 1900 De Dion-Bouton Cab, and the 1923‚Äì1925 Citroen 5CV 2 seater roadster. * 1959: 1927‚Äì1930 Bugatti 35 C race car, 1925 Citroen 10 Cv B10 sedan, and the 1906 Sizaire et Naudin 1 cylinder race car. * 1960: 1895 Rochet Schneider with parasol and the 1934 Hispano-Suiza J12 coup√© de ville. * 1961: 1899 Gobron- Brillie double pha√©ton (spelled Brill√©e on the box) and a year newer than the 1898 model shown in the museum. Also the 1897 Gautier Wehrl√© cabriolet. * 1962: 1912 Packard landaulet and the 1898‚Äì1901 Peugeot coup√© 21. * 1963: 1908 Ford Model T roadster and 1907 Ford Model T four-seater. * 1964: 1908 Panhard & Levassor \\"La marquise\\", Panhard & Levassor tonneau ballon, 1898 Hautier Electric Taxi, 1904 Delaunay Belleville double-pha√©ton and the 1902 Georges Richard tonneau. * 1965: 1892 Scott steamwagon, 1901 Renault tonneau, 1911 Lorraine Dietrich, 1895 Panhard & Levassor tonneau, and the 1904 Delahaye pha√©ton. * 1966: 1898 Audibert et Lavirotte, 1911 L√©on Boll√©e four-door sedan, 1912 Spa 25/30 HP race car, and the 1878 Am√©d√©e Boll√©e \\"La Mancelle\\" steam wagon. * 1967: 1901 Luc Court, 1908 Brazier landaulet, 1910 Berliet sedan, and the 1903 Mieussiet cabriolet. * 1968: 1902 De Dion-Bouton race car, 1898 Lacroix de La ville three-wheeler, and the 1932 Delage roadster. * 1969: 1927 Mercedes Benz SSK. Packaging The majority of RAMI vehicles appeared in red boxes with a cream white 'illustration' section portraying the 1895 Panhard & Levassor open car on two sides. This illustration did not vary, box to box, so what was seen on the box was inside only with the Panhard & Levassor model. Above the Panhard illustration were the letters \\"RAMI\\" in white without punctuation. Boxes did, however, come in a few different sizes depending on the size of the model ‚Äì some were more squarish and others more rectangular. The opposed sides from the illustration were stamped with the name and year of the individual model (Rixon 2005, p. 72). The end flaps likewise had the name of the particular model. Though some lists show the models numbered in order of release, neither boxes nor model bases carry numbers of any kind. They do say \\"1:43\\" scale. A few of the later offerings were available in clear plastic display cases. End of RAMI Koch died in 1967 and Jarry retired about the same time. This left Malartre in charge, apparently slowing production. No new models were produced after 1969. The 1927 Mercedes-Benz SSK was the last RAMI model. References * Dintoys.com 2012.

(2011); Clinical Neuroscience: Psychopathoogy and the Brain, Oxford University Press, New York,2 ed., PG 229. Some researchers suspect that variations in the volume of specific brain structures can be observed in children that have OCD (Lambert, K.G; Kinsley, C.H., 2011). It has not been determined if delayed- maturation of this frontal circuitry contributes to the development of OCD or if OCD is the ailment that inhibits normal growth of structures in the frontal striatal, frontal cortex, or striatum. However, the use of neuroimaging has equipped researchers with evidence of some brain structures that are consistently less adequate and less matured in patients diagnosed with OCD in comparison to brains without OCD. More specifically, structures such as the caudate nucleus, volumes of gray matter, white matter, and the cingulate have been identified as being less developed in people with OCD in comparison to individuals that do not have OCD (Lambert, K.G.; Kinsley, C.H.). However, the cortex volume of the operculum (brain) is larger and OCD patients are also reported to have larger temporal lobe volumes; which has been identified in some women patients with OCD (Jenike, M.; Breiter, H.; at el, 1996). Further research is needed to determine the effect of these structural size differences on the onset and degree of OCD and the maturation of specific brain structures.  History   Origins of obsessive-compulsive disorder  The first record of obsessive-compulsive disorder dates back to the 14th century in Europe. It was believed that people who had OCD were possessed by the devil, and treatment included a series of performed exorcisms. In the 1910s, Sigmund Freud, a neurologist from Austria described Obsessive Compulsive Disorder to a case of touching phobia.[5] This phobia is said to start in early childhood and happens when a person has a strong desire to touch. However, the opposite can also develop where the person develops what is called external prohibition. This happens when someone has the fear of a form of touching sensation. There are some circumstances where this disorder can be delayed. The earliest signs of OCD can start showing up in as little as six months. The brain becomes even more hyperactive around 54 months, and it is easier to notice obsessive-compulsive behavior at this time. Although there is no exact date as to when OCD begins to develop in later stages of life; different environments or events in a person‚Äôs life can quickly become the catalyst to the development of this disorder.  Origins of obsessive- compulsive disorder and neuroimaging  Research for psychiatric neuroimaging began in 1994 at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston, by Dr. Scott Rauch. The group was developed into an entire program in 2003. They discovered close collaborations between several other different disorders and the brain stem. Since the research first began, there has been a significant amount of development in regards to OCD. Studies done, via neuroimaging, show that the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder involve abnormal functioning along specific frontal-sub-cortical brain circuits. The use of fMRI imaging to predict and follow individual‚Äôs responses is a new approach. The goal is to be able to increase the understanding of the neurology of OCD. This specific study focuses on OCD patients with different refractory time. The timeline for the type of scan is a total of about three and a half months. These individuals undergo fMRI scanning one day prior to starting treatment, plus an additional four days following the treatment. The results of this test show the baseline brain pattern compared to the first scan they took. The first scan provides data about the activation in the frontal-striatal neural circuit, which is the area involving OCD. The difference in the brain patterns depict information regarding biological mechanisms, which underlie heterogeneity in OCD.http://www.ocdhistory.net/20thcentury/freud.html Over time, this fMRI testing is indicated to lead to a more accurate diagnosis of the illness as well as a better understanding of the symptoms. With the knowledge of the red-flag indicators for OCD, children with the disease may be able to detect it more efficiently early on in life. The fMRI, neuroimaging technique, is the most preferable way to scan today due to accuracy. A fMRI does not expose an individual to radiation and is a safe option in most cases.http://www.ocdhistory.net/ The combination of innovative psychopharmacology with neuroimaging technology has the potential to result in a dominant and comprehensive approach for individuals with OCD.  Supporting experiments   Van de Heuval et al, 2009  The primary suggestion for the delayed-maturation theory of OCD was conducted in the Netherlands and inspired by the research of Van de Heuvel. In this study, researchers used 55 non-medicated patients with OCD and 50 age matched controls to study the relationship between symptom dimensions and specific neuroanatomical structures. It was concluded that the \\"specific neuroanatomical structures are associated with specific symptom dimensions\\". The symptoms of obsessive- compulsive behavior are associated with specific regions within the brain, and patients with similar symptoms are likely to have similar regions of the brain that are comprised due to OCD.  Rosenberg and Keshavan, 1998  Another experiment, supporting delayed-maturation theory of obsessive compulsive disorder, was conducted by Rosenberg and Keshavan in 1998.Valeo, T., (April 18, 2011), Experimental Radiation Treatment for OCD Hits a Snag, The DANA Foundation. http://www.dana.org/news/features/detail.aspx?id=31716. retrieved April 2, 2013. This research used voxel-based morphometry to investigate the development of the cingulate structure in a group children's brains, ranging 2-7 in age, observed to be OCD.Weg, A., (Aug. 2009), Treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder With Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,.Retrieved April 9, 2013.https://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=8238662&page;=1#.UWyV2bXlYTY This technique enabled researchers to identify a correlation between age and cingulate volume by comparing a group of control patients to a group of children that have been diagnosed with OCD. Children that do not have OCD were found to demonstrate a correlation between age and cingulate volume growth, whereas, children exhibiting traits of OCD did not display a significant correlation between age and cingulate volume. The Rosenberg and Keshavan experiment concluded that OCD patients do not exhibit a correlation of age and cingulate volume comparable to the control group of patients that did not have OCD.Snider, L.A, Swedo, S.E., (2003), Childhood-Onset Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Tic Disorders: Case Report and Literature Review, Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology,13,1, pp. S81-S88. http://intramural.nimh.nih.gov/pdn/pubs/pub-1.pdf  Lisa A. Snider, M.D. and Susan E. Swedo, M.D., 2003  Childhood-Onset Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Tic Disorders was another experiment that supported the delayed-maturation theory regarding OCD. It was conducted by Snider and Swedo in 2003. Research included the diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder, associated with streptococcal infection, also known as PANDAS. Thus, requiring a prospectively determined association between group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, GABHS, and obsessive-compulsive disorder or tic disorder. Screening for a GABHS infection imposes a significant burden on both patient and clinician. To heighten the index of suspicion for PANDAS, it would be useful to know if parent-reported upper respiratory infection, URI, is associated with PANDAS symptoms or associated characteristics. Eighty-three consecutive, clinically referred patients aged 6 to 17 years with a primary diagnosis of OCD and their primary caregivers were asked about. URI signs and symptoms at the time of OCD onset, PANDAS symptoms, OCD and tic symptoms, comorbidity, and putative PANDAS risk factors. Specific inquiry regarding URI symptoms proved more informative than general inquiry. In the URI present versus URI absent group, more patients experienced a sudden rather than insidious onset of symptoms. Additionally, more patients with a URI plus sudden onset exhibited a comorbid tic disorder.Neuroimaging and frontal- subcortical circuitry in obsessive-compulsive disorder. http://www.massgeneral.org/psychiatry/research/neuroimaging_history.aspxObsessive- Compulsive Disorder Research http://www.lpch.org/clinicalSpecialtiesServices/COE/BrainBehavior/Psychiatry/ocdResearch.html  Neuroimaging indications  The use of neuroimaging has made it possible for researchers to monitor and compare structural and functional differences of brains exhibiting OCD symptoms in comparison to brains that do not have OCD and to measure specific structure's neural activity. The MRI scanning techniques have identified smaller levels of white matter volume in women with OCD in comparison to control patients that do not have OCD. The use of positron emission tomographic scan, better known as the PET scan, has enabled researchers to observe structures of the OFC, anterior cingular cortex, and the striatum for evidence of abnormal neural activity. In relationship to delayed-maturation theory of obsessive compulsive disorder, PET scans have consistently observed the caudate nucleus, cingulate volume, and volumes of both gray matter and white matter to be less consistent in patients with OCD in comparison to patients that do not have OCD. In brief, the use of neuroimaging supports delayed-maturation theory of obsessive compulsive disorder by providing researchers with concrete proof of decreased neural activity in patients with OCD in comparison to age-related patients, specifically children, without OCD.  Treatment For OCD   Cognitive behavioral therapy  Cognitive behavioral therapy, which involves exposure and response prevention (ERP), is the psychosocial treatment of choice for obsessive‚Äêcompulsive disorder. Despite this, ERP is not widely used by mental health practitioners. ERP means a person would repeatedly approach or is \\"exposed to\\" the very thing/object that makes that individual anxious or uncomfortable. Afterwards, the individual would attempt to stop oneself from engaging in behaviors that are designed to lower that anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT, in contrast to traditional psychotherapy or \\"talk\\" therapy, is shorter in duration and focuses not so much on early life experiences or unconscious processes, but rather on \\"here and now\\" problems, and on the education and coaching of clients as they learn new ways of thinking and behaving in order to solve those problems. OCD or anxiety- producing intrusive thoughts or images, are normally followed by compulsions, or by behaviors that the individual does on purpose to lower anxiety. This is displayed by the forming thoughts such as \\"that thing is dirty or contaminated\\". Thereafter, the compulsion would be to avoid touching that certain object or thing, and it can also lead to excessive washing if the individual has touched it. The role ERP has in this matter would be to purposely have the individual touch \\"contaminated\\" things on purpose and have exposure to it. During ERP, with repeated \\"exposure trials\\", the person then \\"learns\\" to let go of the fear through a process called desensitization. In hopes of exposing the individual repeatedly to feared thoughts, things or situations over and over, it would become less of a bother or fear and essentially the individual would get accustomed to it. As this process is initially a scary process to OCD patients, they are either exposed gradually or quickly, in order to be able to handle their obsessive-compulsive behaviors allowing them to feel control of it.  Serotonin reuptake inhibitors  Drug treatment of OCD may be assumed to affect a proposed functional imbalance between the frontal lobes and other parts of the brain. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SRI, especially potent ones given at high doses over long periods of time, are often effective in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, a large percentage of patients do not respond to treatment with the SRI, and those who do respond often do not fully remit, which should be the standard goal of treatment in OCD. If a patient has been treated for several months and has not yet responded to treatment with several types of SRI medication, the physician should perform a careful assessment of resistant and/or residual clinical symptoms. Any comorbid conditions to determine which next-step treatment would be the most appropriate. One strategy for patients who have not responded to treatment with a SRI is to switch them to aserotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.  Gamma ray surgery  The Gamma Ray surgery was developed from the knife experiment. It is a form of brain surgery that uses radiation to destroy spots of tissue in the brain, while giving significant relief to some people with disabling obsessive- compulsive disorder. The gamma knife directs more than 200 thin beams of gamma radiation at different angles toward a single point in a person's brain. While each beam delivers a trivial amount of radiation, the spot where they converge receives enough energy to destroy that tissue, making the gamma knife a precision tool for attacking small tumors, malformed blood vessels, and other brain disorders without opening the skull. Unfortunately, the surgical team with the most experience performing this technique has called a temporary halt to it until long-term side effects that have appeared recently can be studied.

These laws range from protecting clean water and air, to preventing the release of toxic substances and chemicals into the environment: the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, National Environmental Policy Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Hydraulic fracturing: background The process of hydraulic fracturing Hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, is a process used to extract oil and natural gas. The process to extract oil and natural gas begins with thousands of gallons of water, mixed with a slurry of chemicals, some of which are undisclosed. This liquid mixture is then forced into well casings under high pressure, and then is horizontally injected into bedrock to create cracks or fissures. The forced change in geologic structure allows gas molecules to escape, therefore allowing the natural gas to be harvested. Hydraulic fracturing has changed the energy scene as a result of many technological advances. Fracking uses both historically-known vertical and horizontal drilling techniques which are used in tandem to extract oil and gas. This process can occur at depths over 10,000 feet deep. The primary product of hydraulic fracturing is natural gas which consists mostly of methane. Clean Air Act Congress passed the 1970 Clean Air Act to ensure that the general public was protected from harmful levels of criteria pollutants, established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The six regulated criteria pollutants include: particulate matter, lead, ozone, NOx, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. All pollutant levels are calculated by associated health risks that would harm the most sensitive subgroup of people, which are considered to be inner city children. Any major pollution sources must abide by the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), by using the \\"Maximum Achievable Control Technology\\" (MACT) specified for their industry. In 1977 and 1990, Congress amended the law to create provisions related to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration clauses as well as create programs related to controlling and preventing acid rain, respectively. However, under the act, major sources of hazardous air pollutants are required to obtain a \\"Title V\\" permit to ensure that the minimum standards are in place under the regulations, while area sources are not. Most oil and gas production sites are not required to obtain a Title V permit because their emissions threshold is just slightly below the categorical statutory definition. In addition to not having to obtain a Title V permit, the oil and gas exploration and production wells are exempt from the \\"Aggregation Rule\\" within the definition of \\"major source\\" as defined under the act, essentially to be unregulated under this federal statute.EPA (2012). \\"National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Oil and Natural Gas Production Facilities.\\" Code of Federal Regulations, Clean Water Act The Clean Water Act is a result of the 1972 amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, which was passed to ultimately eliminate pollution discharge into any body of water in the United States.United States. Clean Water Act (CWA), et seq. Pub.L. 92-500. Approved October 18, 1972. One of the major mechanisms for implementing this statute was to create a permitting process for all discharging methods that involved dumping pollutants into streams, lakes, rivers, wetlands, or creeks. The National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting requirements apply to all phases of the petroleum industry. Petroleum industry waste, including frac flowback and produced water, cannot be discharged to the waters of the United States, except under an NPDES or equivalent state permit. In 1987, Congress amended the Act,Water Quality Act of 1987, Pub.L. 100-4, February 4, 1987. requiring the EPA to develop a permitting program for storm water runoff,CWA 402(p), . but the exploration, production, and processing of oil and gas was exempt. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded the exemption to include exemptions for runoff from gas and oil construction activities which include \\"oil and gas exploration, production, process, or treatment operations and transmission facilities.\\" In 2006 EPA promulgated regulations that would not require oil and gas facilities to obtain storm water runoff permits, if the runoff is \\"composed entirely of storm water\\",United States. Code of Federal Regulations, which is defined as composed of \\"precipitation runoff\\" and \\"not contaminated by contact with or that has not come into contact with, any overburden, raw material, intermediate products, finished product, byproduct or waste products located on the site of such operations.\\" Any discharges containing other than precipitation runoff, such as petroleum or produced wastewater are still subject to criminal prosecution under the Clean Water Act.US Attorney's Office, Southern District of Ohio, Monroe County company owner pleads guilty to discharging wastewater into a tributary of the Little Muskingum River, 12 Feb. 2013. EPA's 2006 rule was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA, 526 F.3d 591, 596, 607-08 (2008). Safe Drinking Water Act In 1974, the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) was passed to protect the quality of U.S. public drinking water and aims to protect above and below ground water sources that are or could potentially be used for human consumption.United States. Safe Drinking Water Act, et seq. Pub.L. 93-523. Approved December 16, 1974. Section C of the SDWA requires the EPA to establish minimum regulations for state Underground Injection Control Programs. Under part C, Section 1421 of the SDWA, underground injection is \\"the subsurface emplacement of fluids by well injection.\\" The oil and gas industry makes extensive use of Class II injection wells, which are regulated under the SDWA. There are currently about 144,000 such wells with permits issued to SDWA standards. Most Class II injector wells are for enhanced oil recovery, such as waterfloods. About 20 percent of Class II wells are used in waste disposal, to dispose of produced water, usually brine, into deep formations below the base of fresh water.Underground Injection Control, accessed 4 February 2015. From the time of the passage of the 1974 SDWA, EPA declined to require Class II UIC permits for hydraulic fracturing. The agency maintained that it was not required to do so, because underground injection was not the \\"principal function\\" of the wells. The EPA also cited the \\"endangerment clause\\" in SWDA section 1421(b)(2), which directs the EPA to establish regulations which: \\"‚Ä¶ are essential to assure that underground sources of drinking water will not be endangered by such injection.\\" The agency stated that it did not consider hydraulic fracturing to be an endangerment to underground drinking water sources.Adam Vann and others, Hydraulic Fracturing: Selected Legal Issues, US Library of Congress, Congressional Research Service, 26 Sept. 2014., p.1-2. The policy was overturned in 1997 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which ruled that \\"hydraulic fracturing activities constitute underground injection according to Section C of the SDWA. This required the EPA and state underground injection control programs to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA. The EPA responded with a study of potential and actual impacts of hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane wells on drinking water. The draft report was issued for public comment in 2002, and the final report was published in 2004.US EPA, Evaluation of impacts to underground sources of drinking water by hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane reservoirs, June 2004. Section 7.4 of the report \\"concluded that the injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids into coalbed methane wells poses little or no threat to USDWs and does not justify additional study at this time.\\" The exception was for frac fluids containing diesel fuel, which the EPA concluded could pose a threat. The conclusions of the EPA report were incorporated into law the following year, by two amendments of the SDWA contained in the 2005 Energy Policy Act. The amendments added two exclusions to the definition of underground injection: \\"\\"(i) the underground injection of natural gas for purposes of storage; and (ii) the underground injection of fluids or propping agents (other than diesel fuels) pursuant to hydraulic fracturing operations related to oil, gas, or geothermal production activities. United States. Energy Policy Act of 2005. Pub. L. 109‚Äì58. . Approved August 8, 2005. This provision became known to its critics as the \\"Halliburton loophole\\" named after the oil services firm Halliburton. National Environmental Policy Act The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 requires federal agencies to conduct an environmental assessment for all major actions potentially affecting the environment. If the assessment determines that the federal action may significantly alter the environment, then an environmental impact statement (EIS) is required.United States. National Environmental Policy Act. et seq. Pub.L. 91-190. Approved January 1, 1970. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 created a rebuttable presumption that certain oil and gas related activities authorized by the U.S. Department of the Interior in managing public lands, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture in managing National Forest System lands are subject to a \\"categorical exclusion\\" under NEPA, and do not require an EIS, unless it can be demonstrated that they pose a risk to the environment, Congress specified five circumstances for which there would be such a rebuttable presumption that an additional EIS is not required: Other than for the exclusions listed above, federal agencies are required by NEPA to do Environmental Impact Statements to evaluate any oil and gas activities which have the potential to seriously affect the environment. Such EIS's are routinely done for specific areas by the U.S. Forest Service,U.S. Forest Service, EIS, Pike and San Isabel national forests, accessed 8 December 2014. the Bureau of Land Management,U.S. Bureau of Land Management, Oil and gas strategy , accessed 8 Dec. 2014 and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Arctic Ocean EIS, accessed 8 Dec. 2014. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976 was passed \\"to protect human health and the environment from the potential hazards of waste disposal, to conserve energy and natural resources, to reduce the amount of waste generated, and to ensure that wastes are managed in an environmentally sound manner.\\" Subtitle C of RCRA gives the EPA the authority to regulate the generation, transport, treatment, storage and disposal of all deemed hazardous waste. In December 1978, the EPA issued its proposed RCRA regulations. For RCRA Subtitle C (hazardous waste management), the EPA defined six categories of \\"special wastes,\\" which were generated in high volumes and were believed to be less hazardous than the other wastes for which RCRA Subtitle C was designed. Among the special wastes were included cement kiln dust, fly ash, mining wastes, and wastes from oil, gas, and geothermal exploration and production. The oil, gas, and geothermal wastes included drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with oil and natural gas exploration, development, or production. The EPA proposed that regulation of special wastes under Subtitle C, be deferred until further study.US EPA, Special wastes, 15 Nov. 2012. Prior to the completion of the EPA's regulatory determination, Congress enacted the Solid Waste Disposal Act in 1980 which exempted oil field wastes under section C of RCRA unless the EPA determined that the waste was hazardous. Each of the six special waste categories was the subject of separate EPA study. In July 1988, the EPA finished its study of oil, gas, and geothermal production wastes, in which it concluded that they did not warrant regulation under RCRA Subtitle C, but noted that they would continue to be regulated under Subtitle D (solid waste disposal). The EPA's decision was based on its determinations that oil, gas, and geothermal production was already regulated by the states, that Subtitle C did not have the regulatory flexibility to deal effectively with the wastes, and that the permitting requirements of Subtitle C would impose unreasonable delays on oil, gas, and geothermal extraction. However, the EPA report identified regulatory gaps for oil and gas wastes, for which it recommended additional rules under existing EPA regulatory authority, under RCRA Subtitle D, the Clean Water Act, and the Safe Water Drinking Act.EPA, Regulatory Determination for Oil and Gas and Geothermal Exploration, Development and Production Wastes, 6 July 1988. Federal regulation of the storage of petroleum was established by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.US EPA, Summary of the Oil pollution Act, accessed 8 Dec. 2014. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act The Emergency Planning and Community Right- to-Know Act, or EPCRA was passed by Congress in 1986 to help communities plan for emergencies that involve hazardous substance spills or releases. The Act requires federal, state, local governments and Indian tribes to inform the public of hazardous and toxic chemicals being used or stored at facilities, their use, and any release into the environment. The provisions of the EPCRA include emergency planning (Sections 301-303), and emergency release notification (Section 304). The Toxics Release Inventory Reporting (Section 313) of \\"EPCRA requires the EPA and States to collect data on releases and transfers of listed toxic chemicals.\\" The facilities required to report releases and transfers under section 313 are those in certain industries on a Standard Industrial Classification list determined by the EPA. The EPA has steadily expanded the law's coverage by adding new industrial classifications to the list. As of 2014, the oil and gas industry has not been added to the list, and is therefore exempt from the EPCRA Section 313. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (Superfund) The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as Superfund was enacted in 1980 to clean up sites where toxic or hazardous substances have been dumped into the environment. The law can be retroactively implemented, and all potentially polluting parties can be held responsible for the costs. As of March 26, 2015, there have been a total of 1,709 Superfund sites, of which 386 (23%) have been remediated.US EPA, [massachusetts institute of technology National Priorities List], accessed 5 Apr. 2015. Under Section 9601(14) of CERCLA, hazardous waste definitions exclude crude petroleum, including crude oil, natural gas liquids, and any of their component fractions. Included in the exemption are refined petroleum products, such as gasoline and diesel fuel, insofar as their content of naturally occurring petroleum compounds. If any spills that would be otherwise classified under the Superfund contain only petroleum compounds, they are exempt from the cleanup process associated with CERCLA.US EPA, Specific Substances Excluded Under the CERCLA Petroleum Exemption, 4 Nov. 2014. The petroleum exemption does not extend to hazardous contaminants such as PCBs or pesticides, which are sometimes mixed with petroleum product. \\"Moreover, if the petroleum product and an added hazardous substance are so commingled that, as a practical matter, they cannot be separated, then the entire oil spill is subject to CERCLA response authority.\\" As of 1987, there were at least 153 CERCLA Superfund sites that included waste oil.US EPA, Scope of the CERCLA Petroleum Exclusion Under Sections lOl(14) and 104(a)(2). 31 July 1987, p.3, 11. Despite the petroleum exemption, the EPA has exercised its power under CERCLA to intervene where it considers oil and gas operations to pose \\"imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare.\\" Citing its CERCLA authority, the EPA has investigated instances of groundwater pollution it believed were related to oil and gas wells, including those at Pavillion, Wyoming, Dimock, Pennsylvania, and a Marcellus shale gas well in Bradford County, Pennsylvania.Government Accountability Office, Unconventional Oil and Gas Development, Sept. 2012, p.176-178. Congress addressed petroleum contamination in the 1986 Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, which authorized the EPA to enforce the environmental cleanup of petroleum hydrocarbons released from underground storage tanks. The act also established the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund, to fund cleanup of petroleum hydrocarbon released from underground storage tanks at places such as gasoline stations.US EPA, What is the history of the underground storage tank program?, accessed 21 Jan. 2015. Sites contaminated by petroleum from leaking underground storage tanks are much more widespread and numerous than CERCLA Superfund sites. The EPA notes that nearly every community has petroleum contamination beneath present or former gasoline stations.US EPAS, UST Program 30th Anniversary, 6 Nov. 2014. As of September 2014, the federally financed but mostly state-run leaking underground storage tank program has found 521,271 petroleum releases from underground storage tanks at 205,000 facilities, 86% of which have been remediated. In fiscal year 2014, 6,847 new leaking tanks were discovered.US EPA, Semiannual Report of UST Performance Measures, Fiscal Year 2014, Nov. 2014. The program is financed by a federal 0.1-cent tax on petroleum products.US EPA, Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund, 6 Mar. 2015.  Debates Surrounding Regulatory Exemptions  There have been many debates surrounding the regulatory exemptions for hydraulic fracturing. It has been noted that if not for the exemption for hydraulic fracturing in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 or the RCRA exemption that exempts oil and gas waste from being designated as a hazardous waste, underground injection would have included fracking operations, and the EPA would have had the power to further regulate it as well as enforcing disclosure requirements. The oil and gas industry supports the idea that states should control the regulatory specificities of fracking. Some contend that these exemptions are carefully analyzed. A 2004 EPA study concluded that fracking injection in coalbed methane wells \\"posed little or no threat to drinking water;\\" the study has since been contraverted. and some still contend that there is a lack of funded studies to show a large scale degree of fracking fluid polluted groundwater. Many oil and gas companies contend that the regulations currently in place are sufficient. The June 2015 draft report of an ongoing U.S. Environmental Protection Agency study on fracking effects on drinking water listed a number of mechanisms by which fracking can degrade drinking water.

Idris may be used as a proof assistant, but it is designed to be a general-purpose programming language similar to Haskell. The Idris type system is similar to Agda's, and proofs are similar to Coq's, including tactics (theorem proving functions/procedures) via elaborator reflection. Compared to Agda and Coq, Idris prioritizes management of side effects and support for embedded domain- specific languages. Idris compiles to C (relying on a custom copying garbage collector using Cheney's algorithm) and JavaScript (both browser- and Node.js- based). There are third-party code generators for other platforms, including JVM, CIL, and LLVM. Idris is named after a singing dragon from the 1970s UK children's television program Ivor the Engine. Features Idris combines a number of features from relatively mainstream functional programming languages with features borrowed from proof assistants. Functional programming The syntax of Idris shows many similarities with that of Haskell. A hello world program in Idris might look like this: module Main main : IO () main = putStrLn \\"Hello, World!\\" The only differences between this program and its Haskell equivalent are the single (instead of double) colon in the type signature of the main function, and the omission of the word \\"where\\" in the module declaration. Inductive and parametric data types Idris supports inductively-defined data types and parametric polymorphism. Such types can be defined both in traditional \\"Haskell98\\"-like syntax: data Tree a = Node (Tree a) (Tree a)  Leaf a or in the more general GADT-like syntax: data Tree : Type -> Type where Node : Tree a -> Tree a -> Tree a Leaf : a -> Tree a Dependent types With dependent types, it is possible for values to appear in the types; in effect, any value-level computation can be performed during typechecking. The following defines a type of lists whose lengths are known before the program runs, traditionally called vectors: data Vect : Nat -> Type -> Type where Nil : Vect 0 a (::) : (x : a) -> (xs : Vect n a) -> Vect (n + 1) a This type can be used as follows: total append : Vect n a -> Vect m a -> Vect (n + m) a append Nil ys = ys append (x :: xs) ys = x :: append xs ys The functions append a vector of m elements of type a to a vector of n elements of type a. Since the precise types of the input vectors depend on a value, it is possible to be certain at compile-time that the resulting vector will have exactly (n + m) elements of type a. The word \\"total\\" invokes the totality checker which will report an error if the function doesn't cover all possible cases or cannot be (automatically) proven not to enter an infinite loop. Another common example is pairwise addition of two vectors that are parameterized over their length: total pairAdd : Num a => Vect n a -> Vect n a -> Vect n a pairAdd Nil Nil = Nil pairAdd (x :: xs) (y :: ys) = x + y :: pairAdd xs ys Num a signifies that the type a belongs to the type class Num. Note that this function still typechecks successfully as total, even though there is no case matching Nil in one vector and a number in the other. Since both vectors are ensured by the type system to have exactly the same length, we can be sure at compile time that this case will not occur. Hence it does not need to be mentioned for the function to be total. Proof assistant features Dependent types are powerful enough to encode most properties of programs, and an Idris program can prove invariants at compile-time. This makes Idris into a proof assistant. There are two standard ways of interacting with proof assistants: by writing a series of tactic invocations (Coq style), or by interactively elaborating a proof term (Epigram/Agda style). Idris supports both modes of interaction, although the set of available tactics is not yet as useful as that of Coq. Code generation Because Idris contains a proof assistant, Idris programs can be written to pass proofs around. If treated na√Øvely, such proofs remain around at runtime. Idris aims to avoid this pitfall by aggressively erasing unused terms. By default, Idris generates native code through C. The other officially supported backend generates JavaScript. Idris 2 Idris 2 is a new self-hosted version of the language which deeply integrates a linear type system, based on quantitative type theory. It currently compiles to Scheme. The latest version is 0.2.1, released on August 16, 2020.

Flamm (1899‚Äì1998) was an American radio pioneer. He worked for the Shubert Brothers and for such stars as Al Jolson and Milton Berle.New York Times, obituary, 21 February 1998 He owned numerous radio stations beginning with New York City‚Äôs WMCA, and is credited with founding ABSIE (American Broadcasting Station in Europe), the precursor of the Voice of America. Early life Flamm was born in Pittsburgh but attended New York City schools.  Career in broadcasting  From a young age, Flamm was very active in the New York cultural scene. He produced plays and published a book of poems (1926). When radio station WMCA began operating in February 1925, Flamm produced much of the on-air content. Flamm is listed as the owner of WMCA from 1926. During the embryonic age of radio broadcasting, Flamm and WMCA were involved in many pioneering activities and controversies. WMCA was one of the nation‚Äôs leading radio broadcasting stations. In December 1940, well-connected investors forced Donald Flamm to sell WMCA to industrialist Edward J. Noble for $850,000, which was about $400,000 less than its market value and the offer Flamm had previously refused from the president‚Äôs son, Elliott Roosevelt. Noble told Flamm that he would get his station ‚Äúno matter what‚Äù or his Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license would be taken away. Noble had just left office as Undersecretary of Commerce. He was a friend of top White House aide Thomas Corcoran, and the purchase was handled by former FCC chief counsel William Dempsey, who shared offices with Corcoran. Later investigation showed that Flamm had succeeded in reaching President Franklin D. Roosevelt‚Äôs attention and that the president‚Äôs aide, General Edwin Watson had asked the FCC to intervene; however, Thomas Corcoran had then countermanded Watson‚Äôs order.United States. Congress.

Study and Investigation of the Federal Communications Commission: Investigation of radio station WMCA and miscellaneous matters, July 25Dec. 16, 1944 Flamm disputed the transaction and filed suit against Noble. The sale resulted in a Congressional investigation, an FCC investigation, and lawsuits that reached the New York Supreme Court by 1949. Flamm was eventually paid a settlement but did not get WMCA back. Noble had sold the station in 1943 to Nathan Straus, former Federal Housing Authority administrator, for $1,250,000 in order to found the ‚ÄúBlue Network,‚Äù which became the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). The Congressional investigation of the FCC absolved Noble, but drew a blistering dissent from the Republican minority. In 1944, lawyer John J. Sirica resigned as chief counsel to the Select Committee in protest of the handling of the case.House Select Committee to Investigate the Federal Communications Commission, Final Report and Minority Report Donald Flamm was then offered a broadcasting job at the Office of War Information, operating radio stations for the U.S. troops in Europe. This network, called ABSIE or the American Broadcast Station in Europe, is regarded as the forerunner of the Voice of America, which is why Flamm is sometimes mentioned as the founder of VOA. After the WMCA lawsuits, Flamm went back into private broadcasting and at various times owned a number of radio stations. In 1960, he purchased WMMM-AM Westport, Connecticut, which expanded with FM station WDJF (his initials) in 1970. He also owned WPAT and WPAT-FM in Paterson, New Jersey at one time. He sold the Westport stations in the 1980s.WMMM ‚Äì The History of Westport Conn Radio, including History of WMMM, Flamm Biography Donald Flamm was very prominent in Jewish circles.

It lives in the cold waters off Antarctica and is known for having transparent haemoglobin-free blood. C. rastrospinosus live in the Southern Ocean up to a depth of 1 km.They are most commonly found on the seabed at 200-400 m. They range from the South Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands to the Antarctic Peninsula . They grow up to and average . The adults feed on krill and other fish. Larvae are 17 mm long when they hatch, and grow by about 2 mm a week. The larval stage lasts for up to 18 months during which they feed mainly on krill. They become sexually mature at four years, and normally live up to about eight years, but sometimes as long as twelve. In the Antarctic autumn, adult C. rastrospinosus migrate to shallow waters to spawn at a depth of 200‚Äì300 m. The eggs are scattered and hatch six months later around April. Blood colour Haemoglobin gives oxygenated blood its red colour. Unlike other vertebrates, fish of the Antarctic icefish family (Channichthyidae) do not use haemoglobin to transport oxygen around their bodies; instead, the small amount of oxygen that simply dissolves in blood plasma is utilized. In 2011 Tokyo Sea Life Park claimed that C. rastrospinosus has totally transparent blood \\"like clear water\\", after dissecting a specimen. In 1954, Ruud noted that Chaenocephalus aceratus, another member of this family, had almost transparent blood, in contrast to the yellowish blood of other members. C. aceratus and C. rastrospinosus both fail to express the major adult Œ±-globin, Œ±1, due to the same 5' truncation of the gene, and have lost the Œ≤-globin gene entirely. Zhao et al. propose that an ancestral channichthyid fish lost expression of both genes through a single mutation. Antarctic icefish also have very few erythrocytes. It is believed they benefit from loss of reliance on haemoglobin-containing erythrocytes for oxygen transport by having less viscous, more easily pumped blood. They compensate for this loss by having lower metabolic rates, larger gills, scaleless skin that can contribute more to gas exchange, wider capillaries and significantly increased blood volume and cardiac output. Captive specimens Tokyo Sea Life Park holds the only captive fish. A male and female pair were donated along with other species by fishermen of the Fukuei-maru krill trawler as part of a programme to collect bycatch for the park. In January 2013 the female spawned, and by 7 May the first egg hatched with about 20 more larva in the following two weeks. Previously, live specimens have been held for scientific research elsewhere.

The station ceased operations on Halloween in 1999 after the Friendship House ceased operations, several years before the Digital television transition in the United States. Channel 58 would not be reissued; it would later be allocated to WJET-TV/Erie, Pennsylvania as a temporary digital channel prior to the transition, after which it (along with all stations between 52 and 69) would be removed from the television spectrum.

She married Sir Arthur Dyke Acland, 13th Baronet on 14 June 1873, with whom she later had two sons and a daughter. Role in the Co-operative Women's Guild Alice's husband was an advocate for educational opportunities for working-class men. She traveled with him on speaking tours which led to her own involvement in providing more opportunities for working-class women. She noted the value of The Cooperative Movement and its potential to provide opportunities for women, as women held purchasing power for their households. Acland began writing articles about women's lives for Cooperative News. On 6 January 1883, Cooperative News editor Samuel Bamford created the column Women's Corner and appointed Acland as editor. Her first appeal set in motion women's role in the Cooperative movement, stating: Her column's popularity led to coordination of the Women's League for the Spread of Co-operation, soon after renamed the Co-operative Women's Guild. Formation of a central board and meeting space for women was proposed in a letter to Women's Corner from \\"M.L. Woolwich\\", a pseudonym of Mary Lawrenson who became a co-founder of the Guild. The Guild was formally inaugurated in June 1883. Acland served as General Secretary of the guild in 1883, but resigned from the position due to ill-health. She served as President from 1884‚Äì1886, again resigning due to further health problems.

Comparison of parallel passages within the Bible is a major area of Biblical scholarship. The Bible frequently describes the same event from different points of view in different canonical books yielding a more complete picture of the event than a single passage on the subject does. Some of the biblical passages describe an area of biblical study in an up close context whereas other passages provide information on the bigger picture surrounding the subject at hand. The Bible also provides partial information on some subjects in a given passage then adds additional information in other biblical passages. The technique of comparing Scripture with Scripture is important for determining correct biblical doctrine. Formulating a doctrine on a single Scripture and ignoring the other Scriptures on the subject can lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, comparisons of and with their parallel passages and lead scholars to conclude that the phrases Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses and Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James in the Mark readings refer to the same two women.

The great superiority in numbers being on the French side the battle ended in a victory for France, with the Dutch army suffering heavy losses. Among the casualties was Prince Frederick, who was wounded in the shoulder at Wervik, an injury from which he never fully recovered. The combat occurred during the Flanders Campaign of the War of the First Coalition. Menen is a city in Belgium located on the French border about west of Brussels. After his victory in the Battle of Hondschoote, the French commander Jean Nicolas Houchard decided to fall on the Dutch forces defending Menen. About 27,000 French troops advanced on Menen from two directions - northward from Lille toward Menen and eastward along the north bank of the Leie (Lys) River toward Wervik and Menen. The Dutch defenders held their own on the 12th. However, on the 13th the French won a significant victory, forcing the Dutch to withdraw to Deinze. Two days later, the French were beaten by Beaulieu in the Battle of Courtrai and abandoned Menen. Despite his recent successes, Houchard was charged with treason and executed. Background In the Summer of 1793 the Coalition forces had split, with the British army besieging Dunkirk under the Duke of York, and the Austrians under the Prince of Coburg investing Le Quesnoy. The States Army under the Hereditary Prince was left to guard a long line along the Leie (Lys) river, centered on Wervik and Menen (Menin), protecting the lines of communication between two allied armies, for which task it was overextended. The Dutch commander therefore repeatedly asked for reinforcements from his Allies, but these requests were denied. After the Battle of Hondschoote on 6-8 September 1793 the British were forced to raise the Siege of Dunkirk, and to fall back upon Veurne (Furnes), thereby exposing the Dutch right flank, which was in danger of being turned at Ypres. The British retreat did not turn into a rout, because Houchard did not pursue them energetically enough, according to later French military commentators. Instead of following in the direction of Veurne he turned sharply right on 10 September, following a plan that Lazare Carnot, the member of the Committee of Public Safety who had special responsibility for the conduct of the war, had laid down in a letter of 5 September. The plan had as objective the relief of Le Quesnoy which was still holding out at this time. Houchard was therefore to march on Tournai and take that fortress. But to that end he had to take care of the Dutch troops around Menen (as they would otherwise threaten his left flank near Tournai). The Dutch troops had retreated from Ypres, as this was considered indefensible for lack of provisions, and toward Menen and Halluin, where they concentrated. A further retreat toward Kortijk was contemplated and set in motion on 10 September, but on the way the Hereditary Prince was informed that Coburg had succeeded in forcing the capitulation of Le Quesnoy, and therefore was able to detach a force of 14,000 Austrians under Beaulieu to reinforce the Dutch along the Leie. This convinced the Dutch commander to remain in position. Houchard knew the Dutch dispositions, which were as follows. On the right flank, the Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt occupied Wervik and Comines. In the center the Hereditary Prince held Menen itself with 6,000 men with 4 battalions under Wartensleben pushed forward into Roncq and Halluin. On the left flank the Prussians of Von Geusau and Reitzenstein occupied Tourcoing and Lannoy. Houchard ordered Antoine Anne Lecourt de B√©ru to Bailleul to meet up with Joseph de H√©douville who marched there with his troops from Houthem by way of Poperinge. Pierre Marie Joseph Salomon Dumesny was already there on 11 September.Foucart; pp. 206-207 The three French generals lost valuable time at Bailleul in preparation, but their presence remained hidden from the Dutch. This was also evidenced by the narrative of De Bas, representing the Dutch perspective, who reported the French attack as a complete surprise. In the morning of 12 September, two columns of French troops under Dumesny and H√©douville finally left Bailleul for Menen, marching along the left bank of the Leie. At Bailleul, Dumesny's division counted 10,000 troops and H√©douville's division numbered 6,500 men, including foot chasseurs led by Claude-Sylvestre Colaud. These troops advanced east along the north bank of the Leie toward Wervik, forming the left prong of the French attack. Meanwhile, B√©ru's division with 10,000 to 11,000 soldiers moved north from the camps near Lille, forming the right prong. The Lille division was split into a left column under Jacques MacDonald, a center column led by B√©ru and a right column under Pierre Dupont. The battle The evening of 12 September strong French detachments had already reached the woods around Bousbecque and Roncq (where they surprised an outpost of the Dutch regiment-\\"Van Brakel,\\" with a loss 40 men), while Beaulieu arrived at the Leie with six squadrons of cavalry and six battalions of infantry (not the hoped-for 14,000, but still about 8,000 men). Here the Hereditary Prince personally welcomed him and led him across the Leie to a camp near Wevelgem, where the Austrians stayed overnight. Meanwhile, Dutch troops forced the French vanguard, advancing in two columns toward Menen and Halluin, back near Halluin. In these skirmishes the Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt was severely wounded. Early the next morning, 13 September, Houchard started a three-pronged attack by launching columns under generals H√©douville, B√©ru, and Dumesny toward the DutchHere, as elsewhere, \\"Dutch\\" should be read as \\"in Dutch service\\" as most of the troops of the States Army were foreign professional soldiers. positions. Informed about the attack, the Hereditary Prince asked Beaulieu personally to send reinforcements to the Dutch, who were already pressed by the French assault. Beaulieu refused, pleading that his troops had not yet had breakfast, and therefore could not be ready to march before 9 or 10 AM. He also informed the Prince that he had orders to support the British and not the Dutch. However, he detached four squadrons of cavalry (about 400 men) under general Kray to support Prince Frederick at Wervik, who with 5,000 Dutch troops was holding off a French attack of the division-H√©douville that had started at 5 AM. The village had changed hands twice already,During which attacks the repr√©sentant en mission Chasles had placed himself at the head of one of the French battalions and had his leg broken by an exploding shell for his trouble; Cf. Foucart, p. 137 before the French managed to occupy it in force, and drove the Dutch back with sustained artillery fire. Map by Daniel de la Feuille of Flanders - the battlefield is in the middle of the triangle \\"Ipres\\"-Tournai-Courtrai (click for higher resolution and zoom) When general Kray arrived at Wervik, he assured Prince Frederick that Beaulieu's main force would follow, and convinced the inexperienced Dutchman that it was safe to start a counterattack. The young Prince set himself at the head of the Dutch Guards, and supported by the Swiss regiment-De Gumo√´ns (in Dutch service) and two grenadier battalions, flanked by Dutch and Austrian cavalry, attacked a French battery head on. The Austrian cavalry troops were hit by heavy grapeshot, and in confusion rode down the Dutch infantry, which also broke. At this crucial moment Prince Frederick was hit in the shoulder by a musket ball, and fell through loss of blood unconscious off his horse. Only with difficulty was he evacuated to a Dutch field ambulance. This loss of the Dutch commander prompted so much confusion on the Allied side that a general retreat started, led by Frederick's second-in-command major-general Count Golowkin.The prince recalled after he had regained consciousness that he had ordered Golowkin to retreat. Noblesse oblige. Cf. De Bas, p. 209 The retreat was bravely covered by the Swiss, who held off pursuing French cavalry, but in the rearguard action the battalion of major Hohenlohe was destroyed with great loss of life. Meanwhile, the Hereditary Prince led the Dutch defense at Halluin with six battalions, under command of Count Wartensleben, against two strong French columns of the division-B√©ru, that vastly outnumbered the Dutch, and had 17 heavy artillery pieces, which did great execution among the Dutch. The Dutch troops fought on in the vain hope that Beaulieu would send reinforcements. Around 11 AM the Dutch had to give way, as a third French column threatened to turn their flank. French troops under general Dumonceau managed to reach the fortified,Menen had been one of the fortresses granted to the Dutch Republic in the Barrier Treaty of 1715 in the territory of the Austrian Netherlands to guard against French invasion. That treaty had been abrogated by the Austrian emperor Leopold II in 1785. Cf. . Leopold thereafter dismantled the fortifications, so the town was no longer a formidable military installation. Cf. but lightly defended, town of Menen, thereby splitting the Dutch forces.According to Foucart, H√©douville missed a chance to destroy the corps of the Hereditary Prince, because he failed to capture a vital bridge over the Leie in time; Cf. Foucart, p. 137 When he heard this, general Golowkin, who had intended to occupy the town, decided to retreat further in the direction of Roeselare. This forced the Hereditary Prince, still near Menen, to give up his defence also, and to retreat in the direction of Kortrijk (Courtrai). In the evening he made a stand in a good position near Wevelgem. Dutch cavalry, and a Prussian corps under Von Reitzenstein that had observed the battle with interest near Gheluvelt, but not engaged in it, managed to break through the French lines and retreat to the vicinity of Ypres.Baron Jomini is less severe on Beaulieu than De Bas, asserting that Beaulieu could not avoid leaving the Dutch in the lurch. However, though his account on the whole tallies with the narrative De Bas gives, he has crucial facts wrong like his apparent ignorance of the indisposition of Prince Frederick during the retreat of his troops to Roeselaere; Cf. Jomini, pp. 62-65 The next day the Hereditary Prince started the Dutch troops on an orderly strategic retreat (and therefore not in disarray, as some sourcesSee e.g. claim without any basis) toward Ghent. On the way he met Beaulieu, who had the temerity to ask for some Dutch troops to cover Kortrijk. The Prince refused in a huff. According to De Bas the Hereditary Prince was much appreciated by the Dutch authorities (especially his father, the stadtholder and Captain-General of the States Army) for his decision to extricate the Dutch troops from Wervik and Menen, and retreat all the way to Ghent, thereby avoiding the destruction of the mobile army. If only he had done so sooner, as he intended on 10 September, instead of accepting battle against overwhelming odds. But then he reasonably assumed that Beaulieu's main force would join him in the battle. If this had happened the two forces would have been more evenly matched in numbers. The Dutch losses were 97 officers and 1394 non-commissioned officers and men (of which 18 officers and 131 other ranks killed), 164 horses and 40 guns. The French had 600 casualties. Historian Ramsay Weston Phipps gave Dutch losses as 88 officers and 3,000 rank and file, including 1,200 men and 40 guns captured.Phipps (2010), p. 241 Digby Smith stated Dutch losses as 3,100 men and 40 guns out of a total of 13,000 infantry and 1,800 cavalry, while the French lost 1,500 men. Aftermath Ironically, after the battle the city of Menen was occupied by troops of the L√©gion franche √©trang√®re (Batavian Legion), a brigade formed by exiled Dutch Patriots and commanded by lieutenant-colonel Daendels. Three days later Houchard met Beaulieu and was defeated by the well-rested Austrians at the Battle of Courtrai (1793), and the Dutch revolutionaries were chased out of Menen again, but they returned in October with the division Souham, where they distinguished themselves at the recapture of the city on the 25th. The Dutch States Army remained at Ghent for the remainder of 1793. Prince Frederick had a difficult recovery from his wound; it never healed satisfactorily and may have contributed to his premature death in 1799. The British and Hanoverians reoccupied the Leie-line in late September, but were again driven from Wervik and Menen by Dumesny and Jacques MacDonald in October.Powell gives a vivid eye witness report of actions on 23 October in Powell, Thomas (1968), The Diary of Lieutenant Thomas Powell, 14th Foot, 1793‚Äì1795, London: The White Rose (Journal). However, the 1793 Campaign season was ended by the battles of Cysoing and Marchiennes, and the French had to retreat from these positions.

L√©on Livinhac as the first vicar Apostolic. When Livinhac became Superior General of the Society of White Fathers in October 1889, John Joseph Hirth was appointed his successor. A civil war broke out in Buganda in 1892, during which the Catholic camp was totally defeated. The war pitted supporters of the French Catholic missions against supporters of the British missions in Buganda, backed by a small force of Sudanese soldiers under Captain Frederick Lugard of the Indian Army. Lugard's maxim gun proved decisive. Hirth and the White Fathers moved to the Bukoba kingdoms of Kiziba and Bugabo in 1892 with about fifty Baganda Christian converts. In December 1892 they founded a mission at Kashozi, in what is now the extreme north of Tanzania. Victoria Nyanza was divided into three autonomous missions by a decree of 6 July 1894.

Research areas Schellenberg's work has centered around developing a comprehensive account of the epistemological and phenomenological role of perception. Her view shows how the epistemic force of experience is grounded in employing perceptual capacities that we possess by virtue of being perceivers Schellenberg has also developed an account of the nature of perceptual content that suggests a new way to understand singular modes of presentation, arguing that perceptual experience is at root both relational and representational. In addition to her main areas of interest, Schellenberg has also written papers on topics such as inferential semantics, the philosophy of Gottlob Frege, and imagination.

It was founded in order to promote Congregationalism and was also an important voice in support of abolitionism and women's suffrage. In 1924 it moved to Boston, Massachusetts. Publication history Beginnings From its founding in 1848 until 1861 The Independent was edited by a team of three prominent Congregational ministers: Joseph Parrish Thompson, Richard Salter Storrs, and Leonard Bacon. Primary editor of The Independent in the 20th Century, Hamilton Holt. It was published and financed by a group of New York businessmen led by Henry C. Bowen of the silk wholesaling firm Bowen & McNamee. The editorial policy was strongly antislavery, which hurt the magazine's circulation initially, but it improved through the 1850s to reach 35,000 by the beginning of the American Civil War. In 1861 Harriet Beecher Stowe's brother Henry Ward Beecher, who had been a regular contributor to the magazine, became its editor. His assistant editor was Theodore Tilton, who succeeded Beecher as editor in February 1863 and remained in the position until 1870. During Tilton's tenure, The Independent took up the cause of women's suffrage. It also published poetry and literary contributions by authors including Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Emma Lazarus, John Greenleaf Whittier and James Russell Lowell. It reached its highest circulation of 75,000 in 1870, the year in which Tilton retired as editor. Trends Tilton was succeeded by Henry C. Bowen, who continued as both editor and publisher until his death in 1896, when William Hayes Ward became editor. Thereafter the magazine devoted less attention to religious affairs, and contained more political coverage and illustrations. This trend continued under the editorship of Hamilton Holt (Bowen's grandson), a strong proponent of the League to Enforce Peace and later the League of Nations. During the second decade of the twentieth century The Independent absorbed three other magazines: The Chautauquan (1914), Harper's Weekly (1916), and Countryside (1917). A printers' strike in 1919 was damaging to the magazine, which struggled with rising costs and changed hands several times during the 1920s. In 1924 its last owners moved it to Boston but it remained unsuccessful. In 1928 The Independent was merged with The Outlook to form The Outlook and Independent. New Beginning On Oct. 16, 2019, Keith Girard, Editor and Publisher and owner of TheImproper Network LLC was awarded a trademark USPTO for \\"The New York Independent\\" by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), leading the way for the re-launch of The Independent as an online publication The New York Independent.

Biography  Webb was the daughter of the manager of the Battersea and Wandsworth Cooperative Society. Her father worked his way up from poverty through the cooperative movement and she was raised middle-class. This upbringing brought question to the class in which she identified as she referred to herself as ‚Äúa working-woman.‚Äù Webb joined the Women's Co- operative Guild in 1883. In the 1890s, Her interest lay in women's waged labor and led her to become involved with the Women's Industrial Council (WIC). Webb was WIC's general secretary from 1895 to 1902. She was elected to the Southern Section of the Central Board of the Cooperative Union in 1895. She served as a trusted lieutenant to Margaret Llewelyn Davies during her tenure as general secretary of the Co-operative Women's Guild from 1889 to 1911. She also edited the Guild's ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù feature in the ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs Corner,‚Äù writing about women workers and their unions and organizations such as the Women's Industrial Council and Lady Dilke's Women's Trade Union League. She believed once women workers were unionized, wages would increase and that cooperators should collaborate with trade unionists to organize workers. She considered the guildsman to have a special role in this project because as shoppers, women could influence factory conditions and management by not buying sweatshop labor and influencing stores not to sell products made by sweatshops. The result, would be that sweat shop owners would be put out of business. She agreed with J.T.W.

Background Born in Hove, East Sussex, Pannett started painting at three, and wanted to be a professional artist by seventeen. She trained at Brighton College of Art in the 1920s under Louis Ginnett, and received her first artistic commission at eighteen to draw local Sussex characters for the Sussex County Magazine. Pannett maintained a studio in Hove and was elected a member of the Society of Graphic Artists in 1934. She was a professional artist until her marriage in 1938. Pannett married Major Rick Pannett who had been injured in the First World War when he was shot in the mouth. The bullet had pierced his cheek and missed all his bones. Pannett gave up painting after the birth of her children. Suffering from depression, it was alleviated when she resumed painting. In 1949 the family moved to Croydon where she built a studio in her garage. The Pannett family later moved to Angmering in Sussex in 1964. Noted portraits Among her subjects were Field-Marshal Montgomery, film director Jean Cocteau, athlete Chris Chataway, Louis Armstrong and Leonard Bernstein. Pannett was a keen cricketer and drew such cricketers as Maurice Tate and Bob Wyatt. Pannett preferred to paint men rather than women, describing men as she found them \\"less troublesome as sitters...They never ask me not to put in their double chin or to leave out their wrinkles.\\" Before the televised proceedings of the House of Commons Pannett was employed by the Illustrated London News from 1957 to 1964 to sketch the events of the House. Sitting in the gallery of the Commons Pannett drew such historically significant events as Winston Churchill's last appearance in the house in 1964. Pannett later formally drew several other British Prime Ministers, including Alec Douglas-Home, who told her that he had \\"the biggest head in London\\" and could never find a hat to fit him. Later Prime Ministers painted by Pannett included Edward Heath, James Callaghan and Margaret Thatcher. For several years around 1960, Pannett supplied the Radio Times with drawings of musicians and other figures being broadcast on BBC radio. In February 1963, she was commissioned by The Illustrated London News to do several sketches of C. S. Lewis. She painted Queen Elizabeth II in 1989 for the Chartered Insurance Institute. Pannett had previously drawn Princes Andrew and Edward. Upon seeing the portrait Prince Philip commissioned a pastel drawing from her of the Queen for the 25th anniversary of the Independence of Malta. Recognition Due to her failing eyesight her last major portrait was of General Sir John Wilsey. She was appointed an MBE in 1993, and was a member of the Pastel Society and a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and an Honorary Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers, who awarded her their gold medal in 1995. At the time of her death in 2005 she was the oldest living artist to have work in the National Portrait Gallery's collection. Her husband had died in 1980, she was survived by her two children, who are both artists. Her autobiography, My Colourful Life was published in 2006.

She is the daughter of Carol Peletier, who is fiercely protective of her, as is Carl Grimes, with whom she becomes close friends during the zombie outbreak. She becomes a major focal point in both media, despite her limited involvement in many of the central conflicts faced by the other characters. In the comics, Sophia is a member of the Atlanta refugee camp and becomes close friends with Carl, with whom she spends most her time - eventually becoming his girlfriend. Later, after her mother's suicide, she begins viewing Maggie and Glenn as her parents while remaining close to Carl. Sophia chooses to break up with Carl because of the overrun world around them and their conflicting personalities, although they still remain close friends and Carl is shown to be extremely protective of her. Sophia also becomes a resident of the Alexandria Safe-Zone and later the Hilltop Colony. She is the comic's longest surviving female character. In the television series, Sophia is abused by her father Ed, as is Carol. After Ed's death and the departure from the Atlanta camp, Sophia goes missing near the Greene farm and her rescue becomes the driving force of the first half of season 2. Appearances Comic book series Sophia is introduced in issue #2 at the initial camp established by survivors of the outbreak on the outskirts of the city of Atlanta, now overrun by walkers. She is seen playing with Carl Grimes and a pair of twins named Billy and Ben, and witnesses Carl and his mother Lori reunite with his father, Rick. With the group under Rick's guidance following Shane's death, they arrive at an abandoned, gated community named Wiltshire Estates. The group begins to settle there, and Sophia, her mother Carol, and the rest of the group briefly enjoy living in houses and sleeping in beds (as opposed to Dale's crowded RV in which the group had spent the entire winter). However, the group soon discovers that, upon closer examination, the area is actually itself overrun; the death of Ben and Billy's mother Donna occurs as a result. They are briefly welcomed on to the farm of Hershel Greene, after Carl is shot by his neighbor Otis and taken there to be operated on. Following Carl's recovery, the group leaves Hershel's property and again presses their luck on the road. After spending a good deal of time traveling, the group comes upon an abandoned prison, which they clear of walkers and subsequently settle into. Sophia moved into a cell with Carol and her lover Tyreese, whom the group had rescued a while before discovering Wiltshire Estates. One day, while Sophia is playing cards with Carl, she asks him a question about his card and then if he would like to be her boyfriend. He rejects her offer, and the two continue on playing. When a newcomer named Michonne arrives at the prison, she begins to develop feelings for Tyreese, which Carol notices with great discomfort. Soon, they engage in sexual intercourse, as Carol sadly discovers from a distance. Because of this, Sophia receives very little attention from her mother, and is subsequently traumatized when she attempts suicide directly in front of her. Carol's downward spiral ultimately reaches a breaking point, which causes her to attempt suicide once again. She approaches and begins talking to a walker another newcomer named Alice had been using for research, and then steps closer and allows it to bite her. She is put down by Andrea, and later buried in the prison-yard, where Sophia mourns her mother's loss. Sophia remains in a catatonic state for a long time afterward. As life becomes increasingly dangerous for the group, Andrea and Dale break away from the group, taking Sophia, Ben, Billy, Hershel's daughter Maggie and Glenn along with them. Following this decision, a rival community named Woodbury, which wants to take the prison for themselves, storms an attack on the group and successfully kills everyone except Rick, Carl and Michonne. The three of them return to Hershel's farm to discover the rest of the group living there. While reunited, Sophia refers to Maggie as her \\"mother\\" to Carl, much to his confusion. A group of survivors soon shows up on the farm, one of them claiming to be a scientist who knows how he can stop the outbreak and is on his way to Washington, D.C. to develop the cure. This sends the group on the road again. On the way, the scientist, Eugine, is revealed to have been lying about knowing a cure (having only made it up so that he would be protected). They are met by a man named Aaron, who claims he can take them to a safe community in Alexandria, nearby Washington, D.C. Rick trusts him, and soon they are all allowed to live in the Alexandria Safe-Zone. Sophia shares a house with Glenn, Maggie and Andrea. She adjusts well to her new environment, and even participates in a Halloween event put on by the community's leader, Douglas Monroe. During this time she also begins to call Glenn her father; however, when she overcomes her fears established by the world outside, she admits to him and Maggie that she knows they aren't her real parents, and also begins to acknowledge Carol's previous existence. After a man who calls himself \\"Jesus\\" arrives and proposes organizing a trade with the Alexandria Safe-Zone with his thriving community on a hilltop, the group heads up there, only to be stopped by a group of hostile people who refer to themselves as \\"The Saviors\\" and their leader, Negan. Since Rick's group had killed so many of his men (albeit, in self-defense), Negan demands a sacrifice of one of their people. He ultimately chooses Glenn, and brutally beats him to death with his baseball bat which he calls \\"Lucille\\". He tells them they have one week to give him half their supplies or risk repeating the tragedy that has just unfolded. Devastated, Maggie repeatedly punches Rick in the face for not doing anything; this prompts Carl to point his gun at her so she would stop, which in turn caused Sophia to lash out at him and bite his arm. Carl walks up to Sophia later on, and apologizes for her \\"dad's\\" death. She begins to believe it is somehow her fault that everyone in her family dies, but Carl assures her that that's \\"just the way it is\\" now. Glenn's body is buried at the Hilltop Colony, where he and Maggie had previously discussed moving to with Sophia and their soon-to-be-born child. Sophia gives Carl a tearful goodbye and hugs him, and she and Maggie ultimately do move to the Hilltop Colony while the others return to the Alexandria Safe-Zone. She later expresses displeasure with the idea of remaining at the Hilltop Colony long-term to Maggie; however, this seems to change after she befriends the (currently unnamed) son of Hilltop resident Brianna (a new friend of Maggie's). Some time later, Maggie becomes the de facto leader of the Hilltop Colony (having apparently overthrown the previous leader, Gregory). She brings the majority of the people from the Hilltop to Alexandria, including many children (Sophia being among them), only to learn that much of Alexandria has been destroyed in an attack by the Saviors. Sophia is still alive and well to date at the Hilltop Colony, and is also the only remaining survivor of the Atlanta group, besides Rick and Carl. , there she became more independent learning how to fight in battle & in self- defense. After Rick's death, she becomes Carl's wife and begins a family with him.The Walking Dead #193 Television series Sophia Peletier, along with her mother Carol and her father Ed, are staying at the camp formed by a relatively large group of survivors outside of Atlanta. As it was revealed in a flashback in the season two episode \\"Chupacabra\\", Ed brought Carol and Sophia with him while moving toward a \\"safe zone\\" on the outskirts of the city. They meet up with Shane Walsh, Lori Grimes and her son Carl, whom Sophia quickly becomes close friends with. The six of them decide to make it together, and stumble upon the camp set up by Dale Horvath. She and Carl befriend two children named Louis and Eliza, the son and daughter of a man known as Morales and his wife Miranda. =Season 1= Sophia is first introduced in the episode \\"Tell It to the Frogs\\", where it is revealed that Ed abuses Carol, slapping her across the face for not coming with him right away. For this he is beaten savagely by Shane, who promises to beat him to death if he lays his hand on Carol, Sophia or anyone else in the camp. In the next episode, \\"Vatos\\", Ed's injuries are revealed to have confined him to his tent, and so during dinner he implored Sophia to stay with him and keep him company. However, Carol stood her ground, and said that Sophia wanted to join everyone else. Towards the end of the episode, a herd of walkers leads to the deaths of Ed and Amy, another survivor, and several unnamed people before all the walkers are killed. In the episode \\"Wildfire\\", Rick Grimes decides to lead the group away from the current site and travel to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) because of its assumed security and to possibly find a cure for Jim, a survivor who had been bitten when the camp was attacked. Morales announces that his family will be leaving the group to find family in Alabama. Sophia is saddened by Eliza's leaving, and Eliza gives Sophia her doll to remember her by. Sophia and Carol appear to have become more enthusiastic and open members of the group following Ed's death. They travel with the rest of the group to the CDC. In the first-season finale \\"TS-19\\", the sole remaining CDC worker Dr. Edwin Jenner reluctantly agrees to let them all in. While there, Sophia and the others are briefly introduced to the many luxuries the CDC has to offer, such as delicious food, hot showers and a recreation room full of games and toys she and Carl can play with. However, it is soon revealed that Jenner had locked them inside the CDC, which was going to self-destruct when a timer ran out. Sophia immediately begins to cry, and Carol pleads with Jenner to let them all go, saying that Sophia doesn't deserve to die in such a manner. After pleas from all of the group (minus two survivors, Jacqui, and Amy's sister Andrea), he finally lets them go with just minutes to spare. Ultimately, Sophia, Carol and everyone except for Jacqui (who stayed behind with Jenner) make it out alive. =Season 2= In the premiere, \\"What Lies Ahead\\", the group is stopped on a vehicle-jammed highway, where they stop to loot abandoned cars for supplies and new clothes. In the process, a massive herd of walkers forces the group to take cover underneath the cars. Sophia is separated from Carol, and is discovered by two walkers. She runs away from them, with Eliza's doll in her arms. Rick runs after her and carries her to a safe spot in the nearby woods so he could go and kill the walkers. He does so successfully, but when he comes back, Sophia is nowhere to be found. Carol is beyond devastated, and Carl is very concerned as well. The group goes on a search for her, but find no trace of her. They come upon a church, and while there, Carol stops and prays to the figure of a crucified Jesus. She says that even though she prayed for Ed's death for abusing her and \\"looking\\" at Sophia, her punishment shouldn't be Sophia's death. This implies that Ed had a history of sexual temptations towards his daughter, and may have even acted upon them before. The group keeps searching for Sophia but is unsuccessful. In the episode \\"Cherokee Rose\\", Carl's injuries ultimately lead the whole group onto Hershel Greene's farm, where they settle. They continue their search, but still nothing seems to turn up. In the episode \\"Chupacabra\\", the only thing that comes to light is Sophia's doll, which had been discovered by a member of the group named Daryl Dixon. Daryl goes on several searches for Sophia, being one of the most devoted members of the group in looking towards recovering her. He and Carol bond greatly because of his efforts. In the mid-season finale \\"Pretty Much Dead Already\\", Glenn tells the group that he discovered that Hershel has been keeping a group of walkers, consisting largely of his family and neighbors, in his barn, as he had believed them to be sick but nonetheless curable patients. Shane goes against Rick's orders, opens the barn, and (along with the rest of the group) shoots all the walkers that stumble out. Just as things seem to be over and done with, one more walker stumbles out of the barn - Sophia, who had been bitten while in the woods. (She had then been found by Otis, who put her zombified form in the barn before his death.) Knowing what must be done, Rick steps forward and shoots her, putting her out of her misery. In the mid-season premiere \\"Nebraska\\", she is buried in a funeral ceremony, alongside Hershel's second wife Annette and stepson Shawn (who were also kept in his barn as walkers). Carol does not attend the funeral because her daughter \\"died a long time ago\\". Development and reception Gina McIntyre of the Los Angeles Times referred to the second season premiere \\"What Lies Ahead\\" as \\"thrilling\\" and \\"heart-wrenching\\", citing Sophia's disappearance and the shooting of Carl. Derek Boeckelmann of Daily Nexus commended the suspenseful sequences of the episode, stating that \\"the show wisely puts both Carl and Sophia, the youngest survivors, on the edge of peril many times\\" in the episode. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club felt that Sophia's disappearance was contrived. Paste Josh Jackson felt that the side- plot of the continued hunt for Sophia takes a backseat to the events with Rick's family at the farmhouse in \\"Bloodletting\\". HitFix's Alan Sepinwall commented in his review of \\"Save the Last One\\" that with all the time spent lingering around that traffic jam and looking for Sophia, \\"the show and its characters seem to be heading nowhere fast\\". Mark Maurer of The Star-Ledger opined that the search for Sophia had gone on long enough, and that the next episode would be the appropriate time to bring her back. Nate Rawlings of Time commented on the situation with the still-lost Sophia that the show \\"really knows how to drag out a situation, doesn‚Äôt it?\\" Time journalist Nate Rawlings complained in his review of \\"Cherokee Rose\\" that Sophia had been \\"missing for a month now in what has become an incredibly dragged out subplot\\". Andrew Conrad of The Baltimore Sun pondered: \\"And when are they going to wrap up this whole Sophia thing? I'm ready for them either to find her as a little zombie girl and do the thing that must be done, have a joyous reunion, or just let that whole subplot die. But please, stop dragging it out!\\" Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club commented on Sophia's predicament: \\"At this point, her being gone has turned into one of those jokes that goes on so long that it stops being funny, then keeps going, and at some point may actually start being funny--or interesting--again.\\" Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly commented that if Sophia turns out to be a zombie, \\"we're all going to laugh, and laugh, and cry, and laugh\\". Nick Venable of Cinema Blend found himself \\"aghast\\" that the plotline regarding the search for Sophia was still considered worthy of returning to: \\"What little sympathy I had for Carol‚Äôs character has been replaced with an eternal yawn. If Sophia returns in a way that resembles anything normal without fanfare, I‚Äôm seeking out a real little girl named Sophia, and I‚Äôm going to punch her in the face.\\" Despite being initially surprised about her character's being killed off in \\"Pretty Much Dead Already\\", actress Madison Lintz concluded that she understood its aftermath for the show. Lintz affirmed that portraying a walker was a welcoming experience for her, and stated that she was \\"going to look back on and say that was amazing.\\" Lintz learned of Sophia's fate \\"about a month before we shot it, which was good, because sometimes they just let you find things out from reading the script, so that was fortunate. [Executive producer] Gale Ann Hurd actually called and told us. I was sad because I wouldn't be able to see everybody every day after that, but it turned out really well. I didn't really know it was going to be that big a deal, though.\\"Fangoria: MADISON LINTZ TALKS ‚ÄúWALKING DEAD‚ÄôS‚Äù SOPHIA AND ‚ÄúAFTER‚Äù Robert Kirkman felt that killing Sophia would add more dimension to the show, as well as add more flexibility to its storyline progression. \\"When a good idea comes up, you have to go with it,\\" he articulated. \\"Sophia is a character who is still alive in the comic book series and who has contributed quite a bit to the overall narrative and informed a lot of story lines for a lot of different characters. Having Carol [...] survive her daughter as opposed to the other way around as it is in the comics is going to lead to interesting but different stories.\\" Janet Turley of The Huffington Post asserted that the episode's concluding scene involving Sophia's death was \\"fiction not afraid to provoke\\", while Eric Goldman of IGN described it as an \\"absolutely horrific scenario\\". CNN's Henry Hanks opined that the sequence \\"left [them] with a final scene that we'll be talking about until then.\\" New York Starlee Kine asserted that it contained cinematic qualities, and felt that the scene was \\"satisfying, sad, and fun\\". She wrote: \\"It was everything you've ever wanted this show to be. Zombies plus no dialogue, such a winning combination! And how great was it that Sophia was dead instead of impossibly alive somewhere, holed up with Merle or Morgan or those warmhearted gang members in Atlanta. And because she was granted more screen time than she ever was when she was alive, we were finally able to care about the loss of her short, young life.\\" Jen Chaney of The Washington Post echoed synonymous sentiments; \\"Really, the final moments of the last episode before the AMC series' December/January hiatus played like a fireworks finale on the Fourth of July, assuming your Fourth of July celebrations typically involve zombies and a pile of corpses.\\" Time journalist Nate Rawlings concluded that it was the perfect resolution for what he called \\"television's slowest subplot\\". Gina McIntyre of Los Angeles Times felt that the concluding sequence was the most eventful moment of the episode, and stated that it was difficult to watch. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly affirmed that the scene reestablished The Walking Dead to full form, as well as redeemed the season's \\"general gutlessness thus far.\\" HitFix's Alan Sepinwall reflected similar thoughts, and observed that it was effective enough to keep the viewers chattering until the succeeding episode. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club summated: \\"The Sophia reveal is a punch in the gut, because narrative fiction teaches us the longer someone stays missing, the better the chance they'll turn up alive; otherwise, where would the drama be? By using the little girl in this way, the show transforms what should've been anti-climax into a reinvention of an entire storyline. It's not enough to make the bad parts of the earlier episodes great, but it does show that the writers had more on their mind than stalling.\\" Mark Maurer of The Star-Ledger felt that albeit predictable, the segment was \\"well executed\\". Josh Wigler of MTV said that the storyline ended in \\"a much darker way than anyone could have imagined.\\" Los Angeles Times Gina McIntyre notes in her review of \\"Nebraska\\" that the episode opens with \\"Rick and the others paralyzed by the realization that Sophia is not only beyond saving, but that she's been nearby the whole time\\". HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall describes how the opening scene, \\"picking up seconds after Rick put a bullet through the thing that used to be Sophia, was great: the emotion felt every bit as palpable as it was at the end of November\\". However, he stated that although the show made him \\"feel the weight of Sophia's loss in that moment where she walked out of the barn in November, once things went quieter, she went back to being a non-entity. (When Glenn lamented that they had lost others, but, \\"This was Sophia,\\" I wondered if perhaps he was speaking of an alternate version of the show where Carol and Sophia were the main characters and Carl was only relevant as Sophia's occasional playmate.)\\" The Atlantic Scott Meslow commented: \\"It's clear from \\"Nebraska\\" that The Walking Dead was banking on us caring about Sophia's death - a tall order, since she'd had nothing but quiet, unmemorable screen time before her disappearance, and kept our heroes from leaving the farm to do something more interesting after. But if the show's viewers aren't mourning Sophia's death, its characters are, with reactions ranging from striking (Daryl's impotent, barely contained rage) to melodramatic (Carol sobbing and ripping up Cherokee roses, in a none-too-subtle callback to an earlier episode).\\" References Category:The Walking Dead characters Category:Characters created by Robert Kirkman Category:Comics characters introduced in 2003 Category:Child characters in comics Category:Child characters in television Category:Fictional child deaths Category:Fictional adoptees Category:Fictional zombies and revenants Category:Fictional victims of child abuse Category:American female characters in television ","title":"Sophia Peletier"},{"id":"39035923","text":"Duxbury is an unincorporated community in Wilma Township, Pine County, Minnesota, United States.

February 19, 2013  Career profile  Workhorse, 1998 \\"Like many university students, Gill sought out a new setting for an opportunity to grow as an art student. 'I studied sculpture at Mount Allison University because I had grown up in Ottawa and needed to be in a new environment,' he says. 'I had no idea what to expect from a BFA program, but I knew that being creative excited me. I ended up majoring in sculpture and printmaking because they were both mediums that relied heavily on materials and processes: often it was not about what you ended up with, but how you got there that mattered most. I liked troubleshooting and figuring out how things could be put together. The qualities of materials fascinated me.'\\"Canadian Art Magazine Online. Will Gill, Multidisciplinary Artist . February 2, 2012 Lighthouse, 2003 After an inspirational journey around the Avalon Peninsula in 1996, Will Gill decided to move to St. John's, Newfoundland, where he was soon offered an opportunity to work as an apprentice at the bronze casting foundry located at the Boreal Sculpture Park and Garden Foundry, run by sculptor Luben Boykov and environmentalist John Evans. \\"'There was something about the people and place when I came here that seemed just perfect for the way I am, the way I like to live,' he says. 'The temperament of the people, the generosity and so on. And it was that that made me think right away: this is it. I fell in love right away.'\\"Keating, David. Off the Cape. The Scope, September 10, 2009, p.19 He has lived in St. John's ever since. Because of his apprenticeship, and later his work as a technician at the foundry, Gill's early sculptural works often incorporated elements of cast bronze, along with wood and other natural materials. \\"It is informed by contrasts and juxtapositions, the most obvious being the dichotomy between nature and culture, but he also plays with that of the traumatic and the monotonous, the exuberant and the upsetting and, of course, the man-made and the natural.\\"Longchamps, Denis. Juxtaposing the artworks of William Gill . Espace Sculpture Magazine #61, Fall 2002, pp.40-4 Line of Green Stars (1998) exemplifies these characteristics. \\"Interestingly, Gill never cuts a tree for his sculptures; instead, he recycles and reclaims fallen trees and dead wood that he finds in the forest or salvages from building demolition sites. An example of such recycling is the wood coming from the infamous Mount Cashel orphanage ground. The main building was levelled four years ago, many years after the scandal of sexual and physical child-abuses by Christian Brothers. Trees were also cut down to put up a supermarket. The maple the artist recovered from the site is found in his work titled Workhorse (1998), permanently installed at the Boreal Sculpture Park in St. John's. Hanging from the maple beam are some 500 rectangular pieces of birch on bronze rods. While the birch and bronze elements reflect each other by their similarity in size and shape, these two parts of the sculpture present opposing qualities. The marks left by the chainsaw stand as witness of the artist's intentions while conferring roughness, solidity, and strength to the piece. In contrast, the mirror image hung on bronze rods that is animated when the wind blows is delicate and lyrical in feeling.\\" Black Water, 2012 Gill has a particular fascination with large scale works of art. In 2001, Gill attended the prestigious Vermont Studio Center where he was an artist-in- residence in sculpture. While there he created Automated Butterfly Catching Unit (2001), a large sculptural work, now in the collection of the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, previously exhibited at The Rooms provincial gallery. The site-specific work Lighthouse (2003), constructed in the woods at the MacLaren Art Centre in Barrie, Ontario, is 18 feet in height. \\"In this work Gill created a protection device usually situated on the physical boundaries of water and land. Traditionally a lighthouse's purpose is to warn of nature's destructive force - to protect people from danger; Gill's lighthouse is intended to do the opposite. His creation can be perceived as a warning sign to protect the old trees, a natural heritage, against industrialization, as well as suggesting a historical link connecting Simcoe County's past, its present, and its future\\".Longchamps, Denis.

'I found that perseverance was the most important thing after graduating. Finding ways to keep making work, and to be around other creative people, is vital as an artist.'\\" As well as producing works of art, Gill has also been a member of the jury committee for the St John's Municipal Art Procurement Program, the Newfoundland and Labrador Arts and Letters Awards, as well as the Canada Council for the Arts Project Grants Program.

Her great-grandson, Sir John Leveson (1555‚Äì1615), was instrumental in putting down the Essex rebellion of 8 February 1601, and her great-grandson William Leveson (d.1621) acted as trustee for the original shareholders of the Globe Theatre.

Richard died in 1491, and Thomas in 1492, both leaving young children..

After the marriage the family lived in the parish of St Stephen Coleman Street,. and Bradbury embarked on a public career which he appears to have avoided during his bachelorhood. He was elected to Parliament in 1495, served as warden of the Mercers in 1496, and was one of the Sheriffs of London in 1498. In 1502 he was Master of the Mercers' Company, and an alderman of the City of London.

Within a year of Thomas Bradbury's death his widow had purchased the necessary lands, and had agreed to give the Mercers' Company her mansion in Catte Street to use as their Company Hall in return for their agreement to act as trustees.; . In 1511 the Mercers held their annual banquet at her mansion at her request, noting that it would be more 'chargeable' than was usually the case, because of the 'Company of Gentilwemen that she myndeth to have'.. This innovation of having wives present at the Mercers' annual banquet persisted for some years, at least until 1525.. ;Saffron Walden In 1513 Lady Bradbury, her brother John Leche, vicar of Saffron Walden, and her son, James Bodley, were involved in obtaining a form of self-government for the town of Saffron Walden through the founding of the Guild of the Holy Trinity,; . and Lady Bradbury also contributed funds towards reparations of the town's church.;. After the death of her brother, the vicar, in 1521 Lady Bradbury carried out a project which he had long contemplated, the setting up of a grammar school in the town. Within a year of his death Lady Bradbury had found a schoolmaster, whose salary she paid herself until she had arranged, by 1525, for the endowment of the school.; . One of the school's students in the early 1560s was the writer Gabriel Harvey; in Have with You to Saffron-Walden (1596), the satirist Thomas Nashe claimed that while there Harvey was known as a 'desperate stabber with penknives'..It has been said that the Tudor statesman Sir Thomas Smith was educated at the school, but according to Smith's biographer, Mary Dewar, the claim is unsupported; Smith did, however, cause the school to become a royal foundation in the reign of King Edward VI; ; ; . During her widowhood, Lady Bradbury doubled the inheritance from Thomas Bradbury which had been her jointure, purchasing the properties in Middlesex which endowed her chantry as well as several manors, including Willingale Spain, which partly supported her school in Saffron Walden,. and Black Notley.. She made her last will on 2 March 1530, and died near the end of that month. She was buried beside her second husband.. The perpetual chantry founded by Dame Joan was dissolved under Edward VI, but some of the properties still remain with the Mercers' Company and are known as \\"Lady Bradbury's Estate in Covent Garden\\"..Covent Garden, The Mercers Company Retrieved 7 April 2013.

Prini's \\"Camping [Amsterdam] approached the concept of a nomadic home which touched on Arte Povera's concerns on nature and culture.

She was the head coach of the 2000 and 2004 Olympic teams and of the 1994, 1996, 1999, and 2003 World Championship teams for Women's artistic gymnastics. She is the owner of Hill's Gymnastics Training Center (Hill's Angels) in Gaithersburg, Maryland Biography Hill was born in Silver Spring, Maryland and attended Montgomery Blair High School. She did gymnastics as a child and a teen, however she has described herself as a \\"low level\\" gymnast who was \\"not good at it.\\" She went to the University of Maryland where she walked on to the gymnastics team. She intended to major in physical education, with the goal of coaching gymnastics. However, she dropped out months before graduation due to the requirement that she spend eight weeks as a student-teacher. In 1981, at age 21, she bought a gym in Wheaton, Maryland. She moved the gym to Gaithersburg, Maryland in 1991. Coaching After opening her gym in 1981, Kelli's mother ran the gym's office for her while she coached. Because she had no formal training in coaching gymnastics, she learned how to coach by \\"trial and error\\". She coached Dominique Dawes to three consecutive Olympic games; Barcelona in 1992, Atlanta in 1996, and Sydney in 2000. In 2000 both Dominique Dawes and teammate Elise Ray competed and won a team bronze medal*. In 2004, Hill's gymnast Courtney Kupets scored highest in the Olympic trials, and traveled to Athens where she won bronze on uneven bars and contributed scores on bars and floor to the team's 2nd place finish. Hill's gymnast Corrie Lothrop was an alternate on the 2008 Olympic team, but did not compete. *Originally, China won the bronze medal for the team all-around competition. In 2010, the Chinese gymnasts were stripped of their medals following an investigation which revealed that the Chinese team had falsified documents to allow the underage Dong Fangxiao to compete. Dominique Dawes Kelli Hill was Dominique's only coach for the duration of her gymnastics career. At age 6, she joined Hill's Angels a year after it was founded. Recognizing her natural abilities immediately, Kelli encouraged her to come to the gym as often as possible. By age 10, Dominique was competing as an elite gymnast. When the gym moved to its new location in 1991, Dominique moved into Kelli's home in order to be closer to the gym. Dominique later attended The University of Maryland and continued to see her old coach on a regular basis. Both have described their relationship as close, and Dominique consistently praises the way Hill trained her. I wouldn't be where I am without her support and guidance,\\" Dawes said of Hill. \\"I didn't get here on my own. In my 18 years in the sport, she did a very good job protecting me from everything that was going on outside of gymnastics. She made me focus on the things I had control of and everything else was just put aside in a stack -- everything from how the judges felt about me to the temperature of the gym. She was very big on instilling that lesson\\" At the 1993 World Championships, Dominique was in first place in the all around competition, but slipped on her final vault, bursting into tears. A famous moment in gymnastics, Kelli encouraged her to be proud of her performance, telling her: \\"It's okay, you gave it a good shot. When did you ever think you would be in that position? You have to be happy with yourself. Come on. Be happy. Stand up and wave.\\" Dominique was given a standing ovation from the crowd for doing so.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGwfZn6zN3Y Notable Achievements Hill coached a National team member every year from 1989-2011, except for in 2006. She had at least one gymnast on every Olympic team, or as an alternate, from 1992 to 2008. She was named as the USA Gymnastics coach of the year in 1991, 1993, 2000 and 2003, and the U.S. Elite Coaches Association coach of the year in 1991, 1993, 1996, 2000 and 2003. She was inducted into the gymnastics hall of fame in 2005. Personal life Hill has two children, Ryan, 30, and Jason, 28, and lives in Gaithersburg, Maryland. She enjoys cooking and baking, gardening, and doing needlepoint.

Background O'Halloran was the youngest son of Sylvester O'Halloran, born in county Limerick, Ireland. On 22 February 1781 he was appointed midshipman on board the East India Company's sloop of war Swallow, and in July that year obtained an infantry cadetship; was made ensign in the Bengal army on 9 May 1782 and lieutenant on 6 January 1785. In 1790 he married, and on 7 January 1796 became captain. Indian Service From June 1796 to October 1802 he was adjutant and quartermaster at Midnap√∫r, and was attached to the public works department. On the abolition of his office he rejoined his corps, the late 18th Bengal native infantry. In September 1803 he accompanied a force of all arms which crossed the Jumna for the subjugation of Bundelkund, and on 12 October defeated fifteen thousand Marathas at Kopsah. His gallantry at the sieges of Bursaar and Jeswarree in January 1804 led to his appointment to supervise the operation irregular force of two thousand men, under Shaik Kurub Ali, in the interior of Bundelkund. On 15 May he attacked and defeated, after a determined resistance, Raja RƒÅm and ten thousand Bondeelas entrenched among the rocks and hills of M√†hƒÅbƒÅ. On 1 July he commanded two brigades of irregulars in another attack on Raja RƒÅm and a force of sixteen thousand Bondeelas and Naghas on the fortified hills of Thanah and Purswarree. Subsequently, he served at the siege of Saitpur, and in December attacked and stormed several other towns and forts. In January 1805 he captured the forts of Niagacre and Dowra, in Pinwarree, His services were noticed by the Marquis Wellesley. On 1 November 1805 he was appointed commissary of supplies by Lord Lake, and, on the breaking up of the army on 1 June 1806, rejoined his regiment, and on 25 April 1808 attained the rank of major. He commanded the attack on the strongly fortified hill of Rogoulee, in Bundelkund, on 22 January 1809. Colonel Gabriel Martindell, who commanded in Bundelkund, made O'Halloran his military secretary; and his conduct at the head of the first battalion 18th native infantry at the siege of the fortress of Adjeghur was specially noticed. He became lieutenant-colonel on 4 June 1814, served in the campaigns against the Nepaulese in 1815 and 1816, in the first campaign covering the district of Tirhoot, in the second at the siege of Hurreehurpur, and afterwards commanded his battalion in Cuttack during the disturbances there. For his services he was made C.B. In August 1818 he was sent to join the first battalion 20th native infantry in the Straits Settlements, and on arrival there was appointed commandant of the 25th Bengal native infantry. In January 1825 he was appointed brigadier at Barrackpore. Before leaving he received the thanks of the government of the Straits Settlements for his zeal and marked ability, and received the unusual honour of a salute of eleven guns on his embarkation. In December 1828 he became a brigadier-general, and was appointed to the Saugor division of the army. He became colonel of a regiment on 4 June 1829. With the expiration of his five years' period of staff service, on 23 December 1833, ended his active military career of fifty-three years, during which he had never taken any furlough or leave to Europe. Knighthood O'Halloran landed in England in May 1834. In February 1835 he received his knighthood at the hands of King William IV, who observed that the distinction was well earned by his long meritorious and gallant services, and by his consecration of his eight sons to the service of his country. O'Halloran became a major-general on 10 Jan. 1837. He was made KCB in 1837, and GCB in 1841. He became a member of the Royal Asiatic Society of London in 1836, was chosen an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1838, and received the freedom of his native city of Limerick on 25 February the same year. He died at his residence in Connaught Terrace, Hyde Park, London, on 3 November 1843, from the effects of a street accident, causing fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone. He was buried in the catacombs at Kensal Green cemetery, immediately beneath the chapel. A memorial tablet was placed in the wall of the south cloister. O'Halloran married, in 1790, Frances, daughter of Colonel Nicholas Bayly, M.P., of Redhill, Surrey, late of the 1st foot-guards, and brother of the first Earl of Uxbridge, by whom he had a large family. His sons included Thomas Shuldham O'Halloran and William Littlejohn O'Halloran.

SR 277 runs entirely through Washington County, although one of the two county extensions runs through both Washington and Jackson Counties, Most, if not all of the road is a two-lane undivided highway. Between its termini, SR 277 intersects with no state roads other than former ones, and shares a concurrency with at least one of those county roads. A sizeable portion of the road runs in close proximity to the east side of Holmes Creek. Route description State Road 277 begins at State Road 79 in Vernon, both of which were undergoing a major reconstruction project in the early 2010s that led to the relocation of the south end of SR 277 onto Court Avenue near the vicinity of Church Street. A connecting road between Court Avenue and Roche Avenue in the vicinity of Church Street brought the new section into the old one. Before SR 277 even leaves \\"downtown\\" Vernon, it serves as the western terminus of County Road 278 (Pioneer Road), on the corner of the Vernon Elementary School, and which is across from Calvary Hill Pentecostal Church. County Road 278 is a county road that leads towards Wausau, and the unfinished development known as Gilberts Mill. As with much of the Florida panhandle, the surroundings along SR 277 are primarily rural and agricultural, but is still part of the city, as evidenced by where it passes by Vernon Fire Department. On the northeastern edge of the city limits are a series of dairy farms and a dirt road named Bruner Dairy Road which runs east. After crossing a power line right-of-way, the road intersects a local paved street running northwest named Culpepper Lane, a street which leads to the Big Pine Lake Boat Launch park on Holmes Creek. Later it encounters another dirt road along the east side running toward the southwest named Owens Community Road Following a curve towards the north, the road encounters a much smaller small private dirt road and dead end street named Dottie West Road, one of two such roads named for the former country musician. The surrounding farmland ends temporarily just south of a culvert over a creek, replaced by forestland. One unnamed dirt road and dead-end street runs west of the road within this patch of forest, but farms return once again. In this area, the road serves as the northern terminus of County Road 278A (Bonnett Pond Road), and then a bridge over Hard Labor Creek. After passing by a pair of intersections of short local dirt roads close with one another, including the second Dottie West Road, the route encounters a more important intersection with the west end of CR 276A(Clayton Road), which also includes an unmarked western extension of Clayton Road that becomes a dirt road before terminating at SR 79. Continuing north of Clayton Road, a few farm tracts remain and then forestland returns as it skirts the Holmes Creek Tract, curving more north once again, where it intersects Coon Hollow Road and later Hartzog Road, two otherwise unimportant dirt road that both lead to a local airport called Hartzog Field.Hartzog Field Airport; FD94 (AirNav.com) After this however, the road does encounter a much more important road on the opposite side, specifically the southwest end of the County Road 280 concurrency at Douglas Ferry Road. SR 277/CR 280 curves more towards the east near the Shiloh Baptist Church. and generally remains at this trajectory as it approaches the northwest end of CR 276, a bi-county road that leads to State Road 276 in Marianna, then makes a more northerly curve towards the embankment for a bridge over Interstate 10 with no access between either of the two roads. From there, it spends its remaining mileage in a community named Hulaw, which is west of Chipley. The route encounters five different local streets, some dirt and others paved, but then gains turn lanes as it encounters the northeast end of CR 280 concurrency at Brickyard Road, which runs through southern Chipley and ends at an unmarked local road (Sewell Farms Road) east of the city. After passing the Limestone Cemetery, the road then curves straight north and the next moderate intersection is the northwest end of CR 273(South Boulevard), a de facto extension of State Road 273. State Road 277 terminates at U.S 90 in Hulaw, across from a former gas station along the north side of that road. However, the next intersection to the east of this terminus is one of two county extensions of CR 277 (See below). Major intersections Related routes State Road 277 has two county extensions, neither of which are suffixed or special routes. Both routes exist within Washington County, but one of them extends north into Jackson County. Southern County Road 277 County Road 277 is a county extension of SR 277 known as Fanning Branch Road. The route begins at Holmes Valley Road which is an unmarked dirt road on both sides of the southern terminus. The next intersection at the corner of a local church is Reno Road, which is paved and also leads to Holmes Valley Road which itself is paved east of that point. Both official and homemade signs warn motorists, especially truckers of dangerous curves ahead, but those curves are short lived. The rest of the road becomes straight north and south once again. The route officially ends at State Road 79 but continues in a hidden concurrency along SR 79 to its upgraded route in Vernon. Northern County Road 277 The second County Road 277 is a county suffixed alternate of SR 277 that extends into northwestern Jackson County. The route begins at US 90 east of the eastern terminus of SR 277 as Griffin Road west of the Chipley border. This intersection is shared with a local street named Kirkland Road, and has a local building supply warehouse on the northwest corner. Along the way, the road crosses a used irrigation creek and a Frito-Lay distribution warehouse then has an at-grade crossing with CSX P&A; Subdivision. Griffin Road ends at Old Bonifay Road(CR 166), but CR 277 turns west and joins the route in a short concurrency. CRs 166/277 make a reverse curve to the north and back to the west again over a bridge over Alligator Creek, a tributary of Holmes Creek, then CR 277 turns north again at Cope Road, while CR 166 continues west towards the Washington-Holmes County Line where it becomes an unmarked road leading to the city that bears its name. After the intersections of Enfinger Road and Wolf Bay Road, CR 277 curves to the northwest and then the name changes from Cope Road to Earlston Road. The route crosses the Washington- Jackson County Line at Searcy Road. The first intersection within the county just so happens to be the western terminus of County Road 164(Lovewood Road), across from a dairy farm. The road then makes a left curve into some woods and intersects a dirt road to the east named Gum Creek Road just before crossing the bridge of the creek that bears that name. After the bridge. it begins to curve more toward the north again, although it still maintains a northwest trajectory even as Earlston Road is on the verge of ending, where CR 277 is about to turn to the right in a concurrency with County Road 162, which despite being named \\"Tri-County Road\\" only runs through Holmes and Jackson Counties. CRs 162/277 runs straight north at first, but then curves more toward the northeast at the intersections of Christy Lane and Hickshill Road. Just after the road turns straight east, CR 277 turns north onto Piano Road, while CR 162 continues towards Jacob City and Greenwood. As with State Road 277, CR 277 remains along the east side of Holmes Creek, winding through farmlands and small forests of northwestern Jackson County. For some unexplained reason, many maps (including those published by FDOT) incorrectly show CR 277 along Piano Road having connecting spur routes onto side roads, many of which cross bridges over Holmes Creek and entering Holmes County, like Reddick Mill Road and Spruce Road while others are little more than dead end dirt roads such as Triangle Drive. In reality no such spurs exist because the route stays strictly along Piano Road. County Road 277 terminates at State Road 77 just south of Graceville.

The company orchestrated early water concession in Kuala Lumpur. Ismail's ties to Selangor politicians enabled him to facilitate public-private partnerships and influence the decision to employ a three-stage water treatment scheme in the region. Puncak Niaga is the parent company of SYABAS. In October 2015 both companies were taken over by the Selangor state government. In 2018 Syarikat Pengeluar Air Sungai Selangor (SPLASH) filed a suit against SYABAS, claiming RM 4.22 billion in outstanding receivables. According to the chairman of the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), Tan Gim Tuan, since the government took over, Syabas had reported massive annual losses every year. He further claimed that the suit could bankrupt the whole state.

In 1991 he wrote a book on the Roza Bal shrine in Srinagar, which, according to the teaching of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1899), founder of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama'at, is the tomb not of a Buddhist or Muslim holy man, but of Jesus of Nazareth. Pappas notes that the Yuzasaf (or Budasaf) traditions associated with the tomb are interpreted by Ahmadis to read that the Yuzasaf tradition is also about Jesus and not Buddha.Paul C.

However Pappas concludes the scholarship of the Ahmadi claims is questionable (page 97), that passages from various texts have been collected and presented inaccurately and out of context in order to prove that Jesus traveled to Kashmir (page 100). Therefore, the thesis rests only on eastern legends which for the most part are not reliable, not only because they were written long after the facts, but also because their stories of \\"Yuzasaf\\" are different and in contradiction and therefore it is almost impossible to identify \\"Yuz Asaf\\" with Jesus (page 115).

The Hubble Space Telescope has a similar detector. Photon counting is a technique in which individual photons are counted using a single-photon detector (SPD). In contrast to a normal photodetector, which generates an analog signal proportional to the photon flux, a single-photon detector emits a pulse of signal every time a photon is detected. The total number of pulses (but not their amplitude) is counted, giving an integer number of photons detected per measurement period. The counting efficiency is determined by the quantum efficiency and any electronic losses that are present in the system. Many photodetectors can be configured to detect individual photons, each with relative advantages and disadvantages. Common types include photomultipliers, geiger counters, single-photon avalanche diodes, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, transition edge sensors, and scintillation counters. Charge-coupled devices can also sometimes be used. Advantages and disadvantages Photon counting eliminates gain noise, where the proportionality constant between analog signal out and number of photons varies randomly. Thus, the excess noise factor of a photon-counting detector is unity, and the achievable signal-to-noise ratio for a fixed number of photons will usually be higher than if the same detector were operated without photon counting. Photon counting can improve temporal resolution. In a conventional detector, multiple arriving photons generate overlapping impulse responses, limiting temporal resolution to approximately the fall time of the detector. However, if it is known that a single photon was detected, the center of the impulse response can be evaluated to precisely determine the arrival time of the photon. Using time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), temporal resolution of less than 25 ps has been demonstrated using detectors with a fall time more than 20 times longer. Single-photon detectors are typically limited to detecting one single photon at a time and may require a \\"dead time\\" between detection events to reset. If additional photons arrive during this interval, they may not be detected. Therefore, the maximum light intensity that can be accurately counted is typically very low. Images or measurements composed of low numbers of photons intrinsically have low signal to noise ratio due to shot noise caused by the randomly varying numbers of emitted photons. This effect is less pronounced in conventional detectors which can concurrently detect large numbers of photons, mitigating shot noise. Applications Single-photon detection is useful in many fields including fiber-optic communication, quantum information science, quantum encryption, medical imaging, light detection and ranging, DNA sequencing, astrophysics, and materials science. Medicine In radiology, one of the major disadvantages of X-ray imaging modalities is the negative effects of ionising radiation. Although the risk from small exposures (as used in most medical imaging) is thought to be very small, the radiation protection principle of \\"as low as reasonably practicable\\" (ALARP) is always applied. One way of reducing exposures is to make X-ray detectors as efficient as possible, so that lower doses can be used for the same diagnostic image quality. Photon counting detectors could help, due to their ability to reject noise more easily, and other advantages compared to conventional integrating (summing) detectors. Photon-counting mammography was introduced commercially in 2003. Although such systems are not widespread, there is some evidence of their ability to produce comparable images at approximately 40% lower dose to the patient than other digital mammography systems with flat panel detectors. The technology was subsequently developed to discriminate between photon energies, so-called spectral imaging, with the possibility to further improve image quality, and to distinguish between different tissue types. Photon-counting computed tomography is another key area of interest, which is rapidly evolving and is at the verge of being feasible for routine clinical use. Fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy Time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) precisely records the arrival times of individual photons, enabling measurement of picosecond time-scale differences in the arrival times of photons generated by fluorescent, phosphorescence or other chemical processes that emit light, providing additional molecular information about samples. The use of TCSPC enables relatively slow detectors to measure extremely minute time differences that would be obscured by overlapping impulse responses if multiple photons were incident concurrently. LIDAR Some pulse LIDAR systems operate in single photon counting mode using TCSPC to achieve higher resolution. Measured quantities The number of photons observed per unit time is the photon flux. The photon flux per unit area is the photon irradiance if the photons are incident on a surface, or photon exitance if the emission of photons from a broad-area source is being considered. The flux per unit solid angle is the photon intensity. The flux per unit source area per unit solid angle is photon radiance. SI units for these quantities are summarized in the table below.

Council City and Solomon River Railroad is an abandoned railroad in the U.S. state of Alaska. Its name refers to Solomon River and the city of Council in the Nome Census Area. The railway operated from 1903 to 1907. The remains of the railroad at Mile 31 of the Nome-Council Highway, comprising three locomotives, two flat cars and a boiler, were listed as an historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Western Alaska Construction Company Organized under the laws of New Jersey, the Western Alaska Construction Co., with a capital stock of $1,000,000, organized for the purpose of constructing the Council City & Solomon River R. R. and extensions. The company was composed principally Chicago businessmen. The company offices were in Chicago, with fiscal agents In New York City. Its officers were: * John R. Bowman, president * J. Warren Dickson, vice-president and general manager * William F. Krohmer, treasurer * Jacob A. Freund, secretary Its stockholders were J. A. Freund, Samuel P. Herron, William F. Krohmer, John Ryeerson Bowman, and J. Warren Dickson. History The railroad was among the important enterprises inaugurated in the summer of 1903. Before the close of the season, about of standard-gage track had been laid. The Western Alaska Construction Co. asserted that the mouth of the Solomon River, the starting point of their road, was the only point on the south coast of the Seward Peninsula which had a sheltered harbor convenient for the loading and unloading of freight and the protection of it in all types of weather. They proposed to locate the tidewater terminus here, and build the railroad northward and westward, penetrating the most important gold fields of Alaska, the Cape Nome fields. Running from Solomon City, the Council City & Solomon River R. R. was to skirt the Solomon river, passing hundreds of mining camps, en route to Council City, the first terminus of the road. According to the report of the Chief of the Bureau of Statistics at Washington, Council City is the general distributing point of the Upper Niukluk basin. From Solomon City to Council City the distance is approximately 50 miles; from that point the railroad was projected to connect all the principal mineral producing areas and centres of population and mining, including the line to Grantley Harbor, Port Clarence, Good Hope bay, and Nome, thus \\"gridironing\\" the peninsula. Initial cost estimates were from $8,000 to $12,000 per mile. The company's surveys were executed by engineers who were official surveyors of the United States government, Paul Heinze, chief engineer, and Hermann Heinze, assistant engineer. The company's rights of way included 100 feet on each side of the centre line of their tracks, with 40 acres as terminal station grounds at each end of the road; plus 20 acres for station grounds for each 10 miles of track. This acreage totaled 13,000 acres. The route described in the articles of incorporation was from a point near the mouth of Solomon River adjacent to Solomon City to a point adjacent to Council City. The company filed two maps of its preliminary line from Council City along Fox River, right branch Solomon River to Solomon City, 50.79 miles (filed February, 1903); and one from Nome City to Wheeler, 20 miles (filed June, 1904); also one map of definite location from point on Norton Sound near Dickson up Solomon River, 20 miles (filed January 3, 1905). New map of same line filed December 20, 1906.

In 2016, the reservoir was renamed Tajik Sea (Tajik: –ë–∞“≥—Ä–∏ –¢–æ“∑–∏–∫) by the country's parliament. The reservoir lies in the western part of the Fergana Valley on the Syr Darya river. The provincial capital of Khujand lies about 15 km west of the dam. It is also a Ramsar site. Description The reservoir created by the Kayrakkum Dam has a surface area of 523 km2; its length is 56 km and maximum width 15 km. Its maximum depth near the dam at its western end is 25 m; the average depth is 8 m. At the other end, the head of the reservoir is silted up for a distance of 10‚Äì15 km, a consequence of the construction of the Toktogul hydroelectric power station upstream on the Naryn River in Kyrgyzstan. By 2009, the reservoir lost an estimated one-third of its full volume to silt. Silted areas are characterised by multiple small lakes and shallows, with tugay vegetation of tamarisk, oleaster, poplar thickets and reed beds, supporting many thousands of wintering waterfowl, waders and birds of prey. The climate of the region is continental and semi-arid.  Construction  The construction of the Kayrakkum Dam for irrigation and hydroelectricity generation purposes began in the Kayrakkum steppe in July 1951. Starting in 1954, about 2,400 families or an estimated 12,000 people were resettled from some 20 villages located in the reservoir area.

Part of the Southern Military District, the army traces its heritage back to the Soviet Red Army's 49th Army, formed in 1941 after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in World War II. The 49th Army served through the entire war and was disbanded postwar in the summer of 1945.  History   Red Army  On 6 August 1941, a Stavka directive ordered the formation of the 49th Army. One day later the army was formed as part of the Reserve Front, based on the 35th Rifle Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Ivan Zakharkin. The army initially comprised 194th Mountain Rifle Division, 220th, 248th, 298th Rifle Divisions, the 4th People's Militia Division, 396th Corps Artillery Regiment, and other units. By 17 August 1941 the army was deployed in the rear of the Western Front, concentrated in the Dorogobuzh area with the task of manning the reserve defensive line of the front. On 1 October, the army was transferred to the direct subordination of Stavka and renamed the \\"49th Reserve Army,\\" but was moved back to the Reserve Front on 7 October. The Rzhev salient, between 1941 and 1942 On 12 October 1941, the 49th Army was placed on the Mozhaisk defense line in the Kaluga area, after giving up its sector to the 32nd Army. The Mozhaisk line was credited for slowing down the German approach toward Moscow.The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition (1970‚Äì1979). A day later, the army was transferred to the Western Front and saw its first combat in the Mozhaisk-Maloyaroslavets Defensive Operation, which lasted until 30 October. In fierce fighting from 14 to 20 November, the 49th Army was able to weaken the advancing German XIII Army Corps, finally stopping it in early December on the line west of Serpukhov and Sukhodol, 20 kilometers southeast of Aleksin. During the Soviet counteroffensive at Moscow, the army fought in the Tula Offensive between 6 and 16 December, and the Kaluga Offensive between 17 December and 5 January 1942. On 8 January, the 49th Army began fighting in the Rzhev-Vyazma Strategic Offensive, which aimed to eliminate the heavily fortified Rzhev salient, which threatened Moscow. On 5 March, troops of the army recaptured Yukhnov, and by 20 April reached the Ugra and the Ressa Rivers, both west of Yukhnov. The 49th Army held the same positions until March 1943. Between 2 and 31 March 1943, the army fought in the RzhevVyazma Offensive, which attempted to stop Operation B√ºffel, the German phased withdrawal from the Rzhev salient. In June, Lieutenant General Ivan Grishin, who would command the army until the end of the war, took command. From 7 August to 2 October, the 49th Army participated in the Smolensk Operation, advancing towards Spas-Demensk, Stodolishche, and Khislavichi in its first phase, the Spas-Demensk Offensive. Operating in conjunction with the 33rd Army, the army recaptured Spas-Demensk on 13 August. Overcoming fierce German resistance, the army reached the line of Tsirkovschina and Zimtsy. Resuming the attack in the Yelnia-Dorogobuzh Offensive on 28 August, the army advanced through the forests south of Yelnya and crossed the Desna River and the Sozh River. On 28 September the army recaptured Mstsislaw, and in early October reached the Pronya River in the Drybin Raion, 35 kilometers north of Chavusy, where it went on the defensive. 49th Army troops during the liberation of Mogilev, 28 June 1944 From 24 April 1944 to the end of the war, the 49th Army was subordinated to the 2nd Belorussian Front. From late June, the army fought in Operation Bagration, the Soviet strategic offensive in Belorussia and eastern Poland. During the Mogilev Offensive from 23 to 28 June, the 49th broke through German lines, crossed the Basya River, the Rasta River, and the Dnieper before storming Mogilev alongside the 50th Army on 28 June. Subsequently, the army fought in the Minsk Offensive between 29 June and 4 July. At the beginning of the second half of July, the army was regrouped southwest of Navahrudak. During the Belostock Offensive between 5 and 27 July, the 49th Army helped break stubborn German resistance between Grodno and Svislach. On 24 July, the army captured Sok√≥≈Çka, and by the end of 27 July reached the area north and west of the city. During August and early September the army fought in the Lublin‚ÄìBrest Offensive, and by 15 September reached the Narew in the ≈Åom≈ºa area, where it transitioned to defense. From 13 January to 25 April 1945, the 49th Army fought in the East Prussian Offensive. Between 10 February and 4 April, it participated in the East Pomeranian Offensive. The army captured Czersk on 21 February and Berent on 8 March. The army continued its advance towards Danzig, which was taken on 30 March alongside the 2nd Shock Army, the 65th Army, and the 70th Army. The army's last operation was the Berlin Offensive, from 16 April to 8 May, during which it advanced in the main shock group of the front. At the end of the war, the 49th Army reached the Elbe in the Ludwigslust area, where it met troops of the British Second Army. It ended the war as part of the 2nd Belorussian Front, with the 42nd Rifle Division being among its units.Robert G. Poirier and Albert Z. Conner, The Red Army Order of Battle in the Great Patriotic War, Novato: Presidio Press, 1985. . The army became part of the Group of Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany when it was formed on 9 June, with headquarters at Wittenburg. Between July and August 1945, the army was relocated to Gorky Oblast and disbanded there in August. Its headquarters was used to form the headquarters of the Gorky Military District.  Russian Ground Forces  In 1990, there were three army corps in the North Caucasus Military District. Among them was the 12th Army Corps at Krasnodar, commanding the 9th Motor Rifle Division. 12th Army Corps had been formed by redesignation of 12th Rifle Corps in 1957. In May 1992, the 12th Army Corps became the 49th Army.Andrew Duncan, 'Russian Forces in Decline ‚Äì Part 4', Jane's Intelligence Review, December 1996 49th Army was then later redesignated 67th Army Corps on 1 October 1994. After the 2008 Russian military reforms, 49th Army was formed in 2010 as part of the Southern Military District, headquartered at Stavropol. Its headquarters was established in the former Stavropol Institute of Communications of the Strategic Rocket Forces. Major General Sergey Kuralenko was appointed commander by a decree of January 9, 2011, with Major General Viktor Astapov as first deputy commander. According to warfare.ru, 49th Army (listed at Stavropol/Maikop) had under control in late 2011 the 4th Guards and 7th Military Bases (South Ossetia and Abkhazia) and the 8th (former Taman Guards Motor Rifle Division), 33rd and 34th separate Mountain Motor Rifle Brigades (Borzoi, Chechnya, Maikop, and Storozhevaya-2), as well as the 66th Communications Brigade.

During the Bosnian War she was an inmate at the Bosnian Serb-run Omarska camp in Prijedor, Bosnia and Herzegovina where she and other women at the camp were raped, beaten, and tortured. After the camp's closure in August 1992 due to press coverage, she became an activist for victims of rape and is credited with helping in the recognition of wartime rape as a war crime under international law. She is a member of the Women's Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Early life Nusreta Sivac was born on 18 February 1951 in Prijedor, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia where she finished high school and then studied law. She worked as a judge from 1978 until 1992 when the Bosnian War broke out. Bosnian War In April 1992, she was told by Bosnian Serb soldiers that she was no longer employed at the Prijedor Municipality Court. Bosniaks and Croats in Prijedor were forced to wear white armbands and had to hang white flags by their houses' windows. They had their houses looted and burned while they were transported to the Keraterm, Omarska, and Trnopolje concentration camps. Two months after the Bosnian Serb-formed Army of Republika Srpska took control of Prijedor, she was requested to appear at the local police station under the pretense that it was for questioning; however upon arrival she and 25 other women were taken to the Omarska camp. She was amongst 36 other women and 3,500 men that were imprisoned there. For three months, she and other women at the camp were raped, beaten, and tortured. She recalled that \\"the worst were the nights for women, because the guards would come to the rooms and take us somewhere in the camp and rape. That happened on a regular basis.\\" During her time there she had to remove blood from the interrogation room. She noted that \\"we would see them on the grass in front of the 'white house' [...] where the worst torture was committed. The killed men would be placed in the trucks and they would be taken somewhere. In Omarska, persons were dying mostly of torture.\\" In early August 1992, the camp was visited by the Red Cross and members of the European press coverage, and it was closed immediately after. Five women did not survive the camp. Sivac stated that \\"four of them were later found in a mass grave and one is still missing.\\" No memorial exists for the camp's victims while schools in Prijedor had commemorated the opening day of the nearby Trnopolje camp. Since then 56 mass graves and corpses in 357 different locations in the Prijedor region have been discovered. Activism That year Sivac escaped to neighboring Croatia where she and fellow inmate Jadranka Cigelj started to gather testimonies from hundreds of rape victims. She also joined the Women's Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina headquartered in Zagreb. In June 1995, they helped in preparing the first indictment of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The accumulated evidence unearthed the severity of wartime rape and is considered by the United Nations (UN) as a large \\"turning point\\" in helping recognize it as a war crime. She went on to personally testify at the ICTY and helped imprison the man who repeatedly raped her at Omarska. She also testified in many other cases including in that of Radovan Karad≈æiƒá, Bosnian Serb president of Republika Srpska. 30 individuals were convicted by the ICTY for rape with another 30 cases in progress as of March 2013. In 1997, she and Cigelj were featured in Calling the Ghosts: A Story About Rape, War and Women, an Emmy-award-winning documentary film by Mandy Jacobson and Karmen Jelincic that detailed their experience at Omarska camp. The film's premiere was sponsored by Amnesty International, the Coalition for International Justice, the Center for Human Rights and Humanitarian law, and the Bosnian branch of Women for Women International. Nusreta Sivac speaking at the 2006 Omarska camp commemoration In 1999, Sivac returned to Prijedor. In 2000, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered $745 million in compensation from Karad≈æiƒá to Sivac, Cigelj, and nine other women. In the summer of 2002, Sivac reclaimed and repurchased the apartment that she had been forced out of during the war. It had been occupied and her possessions there looted by a former colleague. After her return, the word \\"Omarska\\" was repeatedly painted by her apartment. Sivac was unable to regain the job she had prior to the war. In 2003, Sivac and over 100 other survivors and relatives of victims of the Omarska camp held a commemoration ceremony for the first time. In 2005, she was among 1,000 women that were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. In 2008, she supported the possibility of a regional court for war crimes, saying that \\"there are some obstacles that truly should be eliminated because constitutions of the states in the region do not allow for extradition, etc. The local judiciary should be trained more, more numerous, of course, should have more executives and judges.\\" In 2012, she commented on the denial of crimes in Prijedor: \\"Current Serb authorities in Prijedor are constantly trying to erase the part of history between 1992 and 1995 and ensure that it isn't written about or spoken about. That hurts us the most. That part of history belongs to us, the citizens of Prijedor, and we can never forget nor are we allowed to because of the civilians who were killed here.\\" She said that she carries \\"emotions, emotions and sadness for all those friends of mine who are no longer here and were killed just because they had different names. It is incomprehensible that in Prijedor, the town where we lived together, that that kind of crime could occur.\\" See also * Rape in the Bosnian War Notes References    External links  Category:1951 births Category:Bosniaks of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina Muslims Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina activists Category:Living people Category:People from Prijedor Category:Sexual abuse victim advocates ","title":"Nusreta Sivac"},{"id":"39037085","text":"\\"The Surprise Party\\" is the twenty fifth episode of the American television series Smash. It was written by Julie Rottenberg and Elisa Zuritsky and directed by S.J. Clarkson. The episode premiered on NBC on April 6, 2013, the tenth episode of Season 2. With Liza Minnelli in town, Tom plans a surprise for Ivy in an attempt to find a balance between their work life and their friendship. Relations between Karen, Jimmy, and Derek explode just as Hit List's rehearsal process nears its close. While Richard asks Eileen to spend less time at work and more time with him, Julia finds herself also pulled away from Bombshell by an unlikely source. Plot Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee) and Jimmy Collin (Jeremy Jordan) rehearse a Hit List number called \\"Original\\" with the Hit List ensemble. Later Karen tells Jimmy she is uncomfortable with his request to keep their relationship a secret while they keep making out in the wardrobe closet. After talking it over with her roommate Ana Vargas (Krysta Rodriguez), she tells Jimmy they are done unless their relationship is public. Derek Wills (Jack Davenport) happens upon Karen working through her script on set and has been drinking a little, and ends up hinting to Karen that he's interested in her. She tells him she's in a relationship with Jimmy and that she's sorry about the timing. During a rehearsal, Derek, stewing that Jimmy and Karen are together, explodes at Jimmy's dialogue performance and things nearly come to blows between them and they end up revealing that Derek told Jimmy to stay away from Karen. Karen gets mad at both of them and tells them not to control her and stalks out. Later, Jimmy comes to Karen's apartment steps late at night and apologizes. He asks for another chance and promises they can be public. Karen gives in and goes with him for a drink, but is concerned when she finds a bag of drugs in Jimmy's coat that he gave her to wear. Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) is still mad at Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) for bringing her mother on board and clashes with him during Bombshell technical rehearsals. He laments to Julia Houston (Debra Messing) that this directing stuff is hard when everyone hates him. Ivy is invited out by best friend Sam Strickland (Leslie Odom, Jr.) and the Bombshell cast for her birthday, but keeps it from Tom. Tom tries to make up with Ivy by calling Liza Minnelli (playing herself) to meet him and Ivy for dinner. Ivy is overwhelmed to see Liza and Tom and Liza sing \\"A Love Letter From the Times\\" to Ivy that he wrote. Eileen Rand (Anjelica Huston), who Tom told about Liza, and Agnes (Daphne Rubin-Vega), Bombshell's publicist, arrange for the press to take pictures of Ivy and Tom with Liza to get press for Bombshell. Theater critic Michael Riedel (playing himself) also shows up. Ivy is put out by this and gets mad at Tom about it. Tom finds Ivy later at her birthday party to return some keys she left with him and is sad that he wasn't invited to the party. They partially make up, but Ivy tells him that they can't be good friends while he's her director. We hear but don't see Ivy singing \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\" over a montage of the various characters. Ivy's the last one at the party, a little bit drunk, when Derek walks in and gives her a present and wishes her happy birthday. Julia is still helping Scott Nichols (Jesse L. Martin) with Hit List, particularly in how to enlarge The Diva's part. They meet with Kyle Bishop (Andy Mientus), one half of the Hit List team and Julia gets him to storyboard the musical and helps him figure out how to improve The Diva role. They decide to make The Diva (being played by Ana) a bigger presence in the musical, especially in the second half, which will come at the expense of Karen's part. While Kyle is momentarily doing something else, Julia and Scott talk about the old days and Scott tells her he had a thing for her but she was married so he kept quiet. Later, the three present their Diva idea to Derek, who is still a little ticked about his fight with Karen and Jimmy; he loves the idea and doesn't seem bothered that Karen's part will be lessened. Scott asks Julia to continue as a consultant for Hit List. She agrees and tells him if he's still interested in her, he doesn't have to be quiet about it. Richard Francis (Jamey Sheridan) and Eileen go out to dinner (the same place where Tom and Ivy meet up with Liza) and he's a little upset that she did some work with the paparazzi when it was supposed to be just the two of them. Later, he tells her that in his previous marriage, his wife didn't work and he got used to that, so Eileen as a working woman is something new to which he has to get accustomed. Eileen tells him she still has some baggage from her previous relationship, so they agree to take it slow. Production There were three songs featured in the episode, two originals and one cover (\\"Bittersweet Symphony\\" by The Verve). For the originals, the show's in-house songwriters Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman wrote \\"A Love Letter From the Times\\", while Pasek and Paul wrote \\"Original\\" (per the episode's credits). All three songs were released as singles for sale from iTunes and Amazon.com's MP3 store. Critical reception Sara Brady of Television Without Pity gave the episode a C rating.

Description Eremophila mackinlayi is sometimes a spreading shrub, other times erect, growing to a height of . Its leaves and branches are covered with a thick layer of yellow to grey branched hairs but lack the glandular hairs present on the foliage of E. strongylphylla and the simple hairs of E. hygrophana. The leaves have a stalk about long and a blade that is mostly long, wide, egg- shaped to lance-shaped, sometimes wavy, with an obvious mid-vein on the lower surface. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a hairy stalk which is up to long and, unlike those of E. hygrophana, are densely clustered near the ends of the branches. There are 5 hairy, narrow triangular to lance-shaped sepals which are long. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is deep lilac-coloured to purple on the outside, white without spots inside. The outside of the tube and petal lobes is covered with branched hairs, the inside of the lobes is glabrous and the inside of the tube is densely woolly. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from May to October and the fruits which follow are oval or bottle-shaped, with a dense covering of woolly hairs and are long.Meekatharra E. mackinlayi subsp. spathulata flower detail Taxonomy and naming Eremophila mackinlayi was first formally described in 1864 by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. The specific epithet (mackinlayi) honours the explorer John McKinlay. Eremophila strongylophylla is regarded as a synonym of E. mackinlayi at the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families but is still treated as a species in its own right by the Western Australian Herbarium Two subspecies are currently recognised: *E.mackinlayi F.Muell. subsp. mackinlayi has leaves which are elliptic, egg-shaped or almost circular and which are scattered along the branches; *E. mackinlayi subsp. spathulata Chinnock has leaves that are spoon-shaped, or egg-shaped with the narrow end towards the base, and which are clustered at the ends of the branches. Distribution and habitat Subspecies mackinlayi occurs in near-coastal areas between Shark Bay and Carnarvon in the Carnarvon and Murchison biogeographic regions. It grows in calcareous and sandy soils, often in mulga woodland. Subspecies spathulata occurs between Leonora, Wooleen and Mullewa in the Carnarvon, Murchison and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. It usually grows in red-brown loam near drainage channels in mulga woodland. Conservation status Both subspecies are classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture The felt-like leaves of this eremophila as well as its massed display of blue flowers on the end of its branches are attractive features. It can be grown from cuttings but grafting is the preferred option if the plant is to be grown in southern Australia, to help reduce fungal infection causing dieback in winter. It grows best in well- drained soil when grown on its own roots, in full sun or partial shade and in an area with good air flow. It only needs occasional watering during long droughts and is moderately frost hardy.

It manufactures and sells products both under its own labels and privately for other companies, and is an FDA registered cGMP facility. The company was founded in 1880 as the Sheffield Dentifrice Company by Washington Sheffield, the inventor of modern toothpaste.  History  Dr. Sheffield's tooth powder, a predecessor to toothpaste Sheffield was a respected dentist and dental surgeon of his time. In the mid 1870s, he thought of a new tooth cleaning product in a cream form as a replacement for the tooth powders common at the time. He made his own dental cream in his office, added mint extracts to it so as to improve the flavor, and used it on his patients who expressed their liking for it. After establishing his company in 1880, with the help of his son, he constructed a manufacturing plant on his property to produce a mouthwash he had previously invented as well as the new toothpaste (which was then called ‚ÄúDr. Sheffield‚Äôs Cr√®me Angelique Dentifrice‚Äù). Dr. Sheffield's Cr√®me Angelique Dentifrice The first advertisement published for Dr. Sheffield‚Äôs Cr√®me Angelique Dentifrice (the first commercial toothpaste) toothpaste appeared in the New London Telegram on March 12, 1881. In 1986, the company was purchased by the Faria family, who continue to operate in New London, Connecticut. In 2016, Sheffield began distribution in China of its Dr. Sheffield's brand toothpaste.  Overseas competition  In 2007, the company reported that it was being undercut by low-cost, counterfeit toothpaste products from China, which were increasingly coming under fire for being tainted with poisonous chemicals. They lobbied Connecticut's state business advocate, Rob Simmons, to ask for increased regulatory oversight into the Chinese and Indonesian imports due to reports of the products being tainted with diethylene glycol, a poisonous substance typically used in antifreeze. The imports were being manufactured with the cheaper, but incorrect, ingredients as a way to illegally undercut the price. Company President Thomas Faria reported that the toothpaste imports were being offered at a cost to retailers of 9 cents a tube, and that he couldn't even purchase the correct ingredients to make his product at that price.

It is a small shrub with distinctive round leaves, yellowish new growth and purple flowers which are white inside. It is similar to Eremophila mackinlayi and Eremophila hygrophana but distinguished from them by characteristics including leaf shape, and the type of hairs on its leaves and branches. Description Eremophila strongylophylla is a rounded shrub with many branches growing to a height of between with its branches and leaves covered with a layer of fine, yellowish to grey hairs and glandular hairs. The branches are rough due to raised leaf bases. The leaves are arranged alternately, well spaced along the branches and have a flattened stalk that is long. The leaf blade is egg-shaped, spoon- shaped or almost round, mostly long, wide and has a wavy surface. The flowers are usually borne singly in leaf axils on a hairy stalk which is usually long. There are 5 narrow-triangular, green sepals which are mostly long. The outside surface of the sepals has similar yellowish hairs to those on the leaves while the inside surface has mostly glandular hairs. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is purple on the outside and white with purple spots inside the tube. The outer surface of the petal tube is hairy but the inner surface of the lobes is glabrous while the inside of the tube is filled with long, woolly hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs between April and October and the fruit which follow are oval to conical in shape, long and thickly covered with branched white hairs. Taxonomy and naming Eremophila strongylophylla was first formally described by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1876 and the description was published in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. The specific epithet is derived from the ancient Greek words strongylos (œÉœÑœÅŒøŒ≥Œ≥œçŒªŒøœÇ), \\"round\\" and phyllon (œÜœçŒªŒªŒøŒΩ), \\"leaf\\",Backer, C.A. (1936).

Distribution and habitat This eremophila occurs in areas between the Overlander Roadhouse and Carnarvon in the Carnarvon, Gascoyne, Murchison and Pilbara biogeographic regions. It grows in red, sandy soil near watercourses and along drainage lines. Conservation This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture The most attractive forms of E. strogylophylla are those with gold tips on the new leaves but all are small shrubs with lilac-coloured to purple flowers over an extended period. It can be propagated by cuttings but plants grown on their own roots have a tendency to sucker. If this characteristic is not desirable, grafting onto Myoporum rootstock is preferred. The plant will grow in most soils in a sunny or part- shaded position and only requires the occasional watering during a long drought. It can tolerate light frosts but a heavy frost may cause damage that can be pruned away after winter, rejuvenating the shrub.

Description A stock model can be of any size, height, gender, or ethnicity, depending upon what the stock photographer is looking to capture. Examples include a woman walking her dog, a man going to work, and a grandmother baking cookies. Stock modeling photos can be bought and sold through many sites that sells stock photos. In recent years stock modeling is at an all-time high due in part of media projects on the internet for businesses, home, work, school and leisure.

The species was first described from a series of isolated fossil seeds in chert. History and classification Taxus masonii has been identified from a single location in the Clarno Formation, the Clarno nut beds, type locality for both the formation and the species. The nut beds are approximately east of the unincorporated community of Clarno, Oregon, and currently considered to be middle Eocene in age, based on averaging zircon fission track radiometric dating which yielded an age of 43.6 and 43.7 ¬± 10 million years ago and Argon‚Äìargon dating radiometric dating which yielded a 36.38 ¬± 1.31 to 46.8 ¬± 3.36 mya date. The average of the dates resulted in an age range of 45 to 43 mya. The beds are composed of silica and calcium carbonate cemented tuffaceous sandstones, siltstones, and conglomerates which preserve either a lake delta environment, or alternatively periodic floods and volcanic mudflows preserved with hot spring activity. The species was described from a series of type specimens, the holotype specimen USNM355474, which is currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections of the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. and fourteen paratype specimens. Four of the paratypes are also in the National Museum collections, while nine are in the University of Florida collections, and the remaining specimen is part of the University of California Museum of Paleontology. The fossils were part of approximately 20,000 specimens collected from 1942 to 1989 by Thomas Bones, Alonzo W. Hancock, R. A. Scott, Steven R. Manchester, and a number of high school students. The Taxus masonii specimens were studied by paleobotanist Steven R. Manchester of the University of Florida. He published his 1994 type description for T. masonii in the Journal Palaeontographica Americana. The specific epithet masonii was chosen in honor of the botanist Herbert L. Mason, for his work with western North American fossil conifers. Description The seeds of Taxus masonii are rounded and bilaterally symmetrical with a pointed tip. The seeds have an overall length ranging between and a width between . The seeds are identified as from a Taxus species by the exterior morphology and by the structure of the vascular supply system. The overall cross section shape is lensoid, with a truncate base where an aril would have attached, a keeled apex, and a pair of vascular scars near the base. The vascular supply consists of two vascular strands that extend from the vascular scars near the base along the seeds upper and lower surfaces to points approximately one third of the way towards the apex. The strands then pass into the seed cavity.

It is created in an Art Nouveau (Modern) style by use of allegorical painting genre during Golden phase. The painting measures 178 by 198 centimeters and is now housed at the Leopold Museum in Vienna.  Description  This is one of Klimt‚Äôs central themes, central also to his time and to his contemporaries among them Edvard Munch and Egon Schiele. Klimt makes of it a modern dance of death, but unlike Schiele, he introduces a note of hope and reconciliation, instead of feeling threatened by the figure of death, his human beings seem to disregard it. The imagination of the artist is focused no longer on physical union, but rather on the expectation that precedes it. Perhaps this new found serenity is rooted in Klimt‚Äôs own awareness of aging and closeness to death. But before the moment came when he chose to depict nothing more than moments of intense pleasure or miraculous beauty and youth.

She was a daughter of Heraclius II, the penultimate king of Kartli and Kakheti, the wife of Prince Vakhtang Orbeliani, and mother of the Georgian literati, Alexander and Vakhtang Orbeliani.  Biography  Tekle was born in 1776 in the family of Heraclius II and his third wife Darejan Dadiani. The king's favorite daughter, Tekle was nicknamed by Heraclius a \\"tomboy\\" (·Éó·Éî·Éô·Éö·Éî-·Éë·Éò·É≠·Éò) for her forceful character. Unlike most of her siblings, Tekle avoided the deportation of the Georgian royal family effected by the Russian Empire following its annexation of Georgia in 1801. She was made Lady of the Russian Order of St. Catherine (Lesser Cross). The fate of Tekle's family reflected the ambiguous situation the Georgian nobility found themselves with the arrival of the Russian rule. Her husband, Prince Orbeliani, was killed fighting in the Russian ranks against the Georgian rebels in Kakheti in 1812, while Tekle, like her sisters, Mariam and Ketevan, wrote poems imbued with elegy and laments for the lost Georgian kingdom. Among a handful of surviving poems is a reaction to her sister's despair, \\"In Response to Princess Ketevan\\" (·Éû·Éê·É°·É£·ÉÆ·Éê·Éì ·É•·Éî·Éó·Éî·Éï·Éê·Éú ·Éë·Éê·É¢·Éù·Éú·Éò·É®·Éï·Éò·Éö·É°). In 1832 Tekle's family in Tiflis became the meeting place of the Georgian nobles and intellectuals disaffected with the Russian overlordship. A planned coup aimed at restoring an independent Georgian monarchy was betrayed and the plotters were rounded up by the police. Tekle shared exile with her sons in Kaluga, where she lived from 11 October 1834 to 6 May 1835. She was, thereafter, allowed to return to Tiflis, where she died in 1846. She was buried at the Cathedral of the Living Pillar in Mtskheta.

SFGate, April 22, 2011. History George Leigh, a Toronto attorney met Norman Laurila, an employee of Toronto's Glad Day Bookshop in 1976. Leigh was impressed enough with Laurila's knowledge of LGBT literature and business acumen that in 1978 he suggested they look at opening a specialty bookstore in the USA. Several cities were considered - Atlanta, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles but Laurila quickly narrowed it down to Los Angeles as the best bet for a new startup. It was felt that the Los Angeles gay and lesbian community both needed and was able to support a specialty gay and lesbian bookstore. Leigh and Laurila formed an equal partnership were Leigh provided 75% of the startup costs and Laurila providing the rest with the understanding that Laurila would move to Los Angeles and manage the store. Laurila and his then- partner Richard Labont√© relocated to Los Angeles to open the book store. At the time, Labont√© was a journalist for the Ottawa Citizen. Leigh remained in Ontario, where he was a corporate lawyer for Texaco's Canadian division. The name of the bookstore came from the title of the novel A Different Light by science fiction author Elizabeth Lynn, suggested by Labont√©. Laurila's close friend from Toronto, Gordon Montador, decided to take a year off work to write his first novel in Los Angeles and was instrumental in helping set up A Different Light. His ideas and enthusiasm were infectious and help make the first year very successful. The first A Different Light Bookstore opened at 4014 Santa Monica Blvd. in Los Angeles' Silver Lake neighborhood in October 1979, followed by a branch in New York City's Greenwich Village in 1983 and a branch in San Francisco's Castro (489 Castro St.) district in 1985. In May 1990, a second Los Angeles store opened at 8853 Santa Monica Blvd. in West Hollywood,\\"George Leigh; Co-Founder of Gay Bookstore Chain\\". Los Angeles Times, January 16, 1998. and the New York City store moved from its original location on 548 Hudson Street to 151 19th Street in Chelsea, Manhattan.\\"COPING; A Small Bookstore Under Big Pressure\\". The New York Times, May 23, 1999. Supplanted by the West Hollywood store, the original store in Silver Lake closed in 1992. For 22 years the store were immensely successful and influential. By the time ADL moved to Chelsea in New York City, it was hosting over 300 author events a year in its 3 stores. Each store became a serious part of the local LGBT community and fostered the careers of many LGBT authors. At its zenith, it employed over 80 people. Apex At its height, the chain was one of the most influential LGBT booksellers in the United States, serving as a cultural hub and social center for LGBT people. It hosted events including author readings, art shows, reading groups, writing conferences, art exhibitions and panel discussions. In the mid 1970s, mass market publisher Avon was the largest publisher of gay and lesbian books including Patricia Nell Warren's best selling novel The Front Runner. A significant part of A Different Light bookstore's first inventory was from Avon Book's backlist. The Silverlake bookstore was located in the Sunset Junction area of Los Angeles where the Santa Monica and Sunset Boulevard met at Sanborn Avenue. Laurila and Leigh had to choose between either West Hollywood or Silverlake, both areas home to a large populations of gays and lesbians. At that time West Hollywood was not incorporated as a separate city. The decision was made to open the store in Silverlake where many gay men had purchased homes, and in anticipation of the gentrification of the Silverlake area as had happened in The Castro district of San Francisco. The building rented for the bookstore was originally intended to house and repair Red Car system trolleys. The space had been minimally upgraded to allow for renting to retail businesses. With an unusual slanting front facade, high ceilings and mock-Tudor appearance, the store appeared to have occupied its space for decades. At the end of the first year, A Different Light expanded it to the next storefront by opening up wall in between the two locations, more than doubling the floor space. The store fixtures were built by a master carpenter who was a friend of Laurila's. With high ceilings and ample display space above the shelving, the bookstore worked with local artists and photographers to display artwork on a rotating basis. Gay and lesbian authors made A Different Light bookstore part of their book signing tours, including Quentin Crisp, Ned Rorem, Judy Grahn, Katherine Forrest, Armistead Maupin, Christopher Isherwood and his partner Don Bacardi, David Hockney Mark Thompson, Michael Nava, Joseph Hansen, Paul Monette, William Burroughs, Edmund White and hundreds of others. The first author to have a signing was local author John Rechy, best known for his classic gay novel City of Night. Rechy appeared several times at the store, and he was coincidentally the last author to do a book signing at the original store before it closed. On February 18, 1984, bookstore employee Ann Bradley initiated the first reading of ‚ÄúThe Lesbian Writers Series‚Äù.\\"Gathering Celebrates Literary Series for Lesbian Writers\\". Los Angeles Times, March 29, 2004. Later playwright and store employee James Carroll Pickett would launch ‚ÄúThe Gay Writers Series‚Äù and hosted the monthly readings from 1987 to 1990. In New York, bookstore employee Emanuel Xavier introduced spoken word poetry to the community with his \\"Realness & Rhythms\\" monthly readings. Decline and closure The former location in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco Leigh unexpectedly died in 1998 in West Hollywood while on vacation. The original Mission Statement from 1979 had a primary goal of getting LGBT literature as widely available as possible. ADL was instrumental in making that happen. By the mid-90s most serious independent bookstores had LGBT sections with Barnes & Noble stores throughout the country entering the market and offering substantial discounts. Amazon was next. They too heavily discounted LGBT books. The 3 ADL stores were in high rent cities and could not afford to match their prices. Laurila sold the 3 stores in 2000 to Bill Barker and Stanley Newman,\\"Bookstore On Gay Life Is a Victim Of Tolerance\\". The New York Times, March 19, 2001. who closed the New York City store in 2001, citing Manhattan's high rent and retained the two stores in California. Following several years of increased financial difficulty amid extreme competition with online book sellers, Barker and Newman closed the West Hollywood store in 2009,\\"A Different Light going dark\\". Los Angeles Times, February 25, 2009. and the Castro branch in 2011. The chain's closure was part of a spate of LGBT bookstore closings in the United States early in the 21st century, including New York's Oscar Wilde Bookshop and Washington, D.C.'s Lambda Rising.\\"A Different Light Goes Out\\". Publishers Weekly, April 18, 2011. Laurila now works for New York City's Museum of Modern Art as their book manager, and Labont√© continues to work as an editor of LGBT literary anthologies for Cleis Press and Arsenal Pulp Press.

Administratively it is part of the town of Setouchi in Kagoshima Prefecture. Much of the island is within the borders of the Amami Gunt≈ç Quasi-National Park. Geography Kakeromajima is a rugged island southeast of Amami ≈åshima, from which it is separated by a narrow strait. The island has an area of , but a coastline approximately . The highest point is above sea level. The coast of the island is surrounded by a coral reef. The climate of Kakeromajima is classified as a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfa) with very warm summers and mild winters. The rainy season lasts from May through September. The island is subject to frequent typhoons. History It is uncertain when Kakeromajima was first settled. The island came under the control of the Satsuma Domain in 1609 and its incorporation into the official holdings of that domain was recognized by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1624. After the Meiji Restoration it was incorporated into ≈åsumi Province and later became part of Kagoshima Prefecture. During World War II, the island was fortified and garrisoned by the Japanese military, and served as an occasional anchorage for ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy and in the final stages of the war, as a base for Shinyo-class suicide motorboats. Anti-aircraft batteries on Kakeromajima shot down 18 Allied aircraft attempting to bomb neighboring Amami-Oshima. Following World War II, although with the other Amami Islands, Kakeromajima was occupied by the United States until 1953, at which time it reverted to the control of Japan. Transportation Kakeromajima is connected to Amami-Oshima by frequent ferry services. There are 30 small hamlets on the island, but no main settlement.

Karunanidhi as Prince  Production  Gulebakavali is the second Tamil film to be based on the story of the same name from the Arabic folklore collection One Thousand and One Nights, following a 1935 film. The film also involved a fight sequence between lead actor M. G. Ramachandran and a tiger. Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass, who wrote the film's script, also wrote the film's dialogues and the song's lyrics.  Soundtrack  The film's music was composed by the duo Viswanathan‚ÄìRamamoorthy while the lyrics were written by Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass. The song \\"Mayakkum Maalai\\" was composed in the Carnatic raga named Bageshri, being one of the earliest film songs to do so. It was originally composed by K. V. Mahadevan for T. R. Ramanna's previous film Koondukkili (1954). As that film was getting delayed and the song was yet to be filmed, Ramanna instead used it in Gulebakavali, with Jikki and A. M. Rajah as the singers. Viswanathan and Ramamoorthy were credited as the composers instead of Mahadevan. The lyrics for this song was penned by Vindhan.  Reception  Gulebakavali was released on 29 July 1955. Randor Guy praised the film for its \\"well-orchestrated fight sequences\\", the \\"interesting storyline and T. R. Rajakumari providing the glamour quotient (she was then 33)\\", and concluded that the film would be \\"Remembered for the excellent onscreen narration by Ramanna\\".  Namesake  The 2018 film Gulaebaghavali was named after this film, but with a different spelling. To connect these two films, director Kalyaan devised a \\"special flashback sequence\\".

Her father was an administrator at the old San Agust√≠n sugar mill. Olinta attended grammar school in her home town but finished her grammar education in Remedios. In the 1940s, Olinta decided to study language and literary studies at the University of Havana School of Philosophy and Letters. Olinta went on to study Librarianship in Havana and graduated in 1953. Career beginnings Olinta completed her degree but was not able to find paid work as a librarian so she decided to volunteer under the tutelage of renowned Argentinian librarian Carlos Victor Penna who was living in Havana at this time. Penna was a specialist librarian at the UNESCO Regional Office for the Western Hemisphere. With the help of her colleagues Olinta established one of Cuba's first libraries that provided services to school children at Elementary School #2 in the Marianao district. Olinta participated in revolutionary activities against the regime of then dictator Fulgencio Batista. Her participation in the revolution lead to her arrest and imprisonment in 1955. Librarianship in revolutionary Cuba In 1959, Morales began working to develop the Marianao Municipal Library. By 1962 she had been appointed to the directorship of the Department of School Libraries at the Ministry of Education which allowed her to expand many services to the newly developed school library in Cuba. She created new administrative, scientific, and technological policies that had a lasting impact on students in the professional field of Library Science. Olinta went on to teach classes in librarianship at her alma mater, the University of Havana, until 1965. In 1972, Olinta was selected to the executive board of the Institute for the Documentation of Scientific and Technical Information at the Cuban Academy of Sciences. While there her work helped to establish modern information services in Cuba with the introduction of techniques like data processing, programming languages, text publication, and international exchange between libraries. In 1976, Olinta became the head of the Librarian Division of the Ministry of Culture, she decided to implement a system-wide approach to help improve Cuba's libraries through scientific methodology, reforming administrative structures, processing efforts, and library services. The emphasis on the use of \\"mini-libraries\\" helped to create greater access for the people. She encouraged professional participation through sponsorship of meetings, conferences, and workshops. She also introduced and initiated a braille literacy campaign through the development of specialized services and facilities for the blind and visually impaired in public libraries throughout the country. Her concept of ten cultural institutions in every municipality helped to place libraries as the most important and basic core of these institutions. She also served as the director of the Jos√© Mart√≠ National Library from 1976-77. During this time she established a strong international professional network to exchange ideas and personnel with other libraries. Later life In the 1980s Olinta devoted herself to establishing and promoting the Cuban Association of Librarians to which she became the first president. She organized and oversaw the first delegation of Cuban librarians to an IFLA conference in 1980, hosted by the Philippines in Manila. She died in 1999. Awards In her life she was awarded the Bachiller & Morales Medal by the Cuban Association of Librarians, the Cuban Culture Award by the Ministry of Culture, and the Order of Alejo Carpentier in 1983. Since 2005, the Cuban Association of Librarians has given a national award named in her honor recognizing librarians with an outstanding contribution to school libraries.
