Unveiled in 1917, it incorporates a granite Celtic cross and the granite structures surrounding a mass grave for 73 people killed by the Faversham explosion on 2 April 1916, and a nearby freestanding stone which records the names of another 35 who were buried elsewhere. The memorial became a Grade II listed building in 1989, and was upgraded to Grade II* in March 2016 just before the centenary of the explosion. Background The first gunpowder factory in England was established at Faversham in the 16th century. The Faversham explosives industry remained important at the time of the First World War, when the Explosives Loading Company established factory number 7 on the salt marsh at Uplees nearby, to make TNT charges for shells and mines. Despite many safety measures to prevent sparks, a fire broke out on Sunday 2 April 1916 at Building 833, a wooden shed which contained 15 tons of TNT and 150 tons of ammonium nitrate. The cause of the fire remains unclear: an initial report delivered on 17 April, just two weeks later, attributed it to sparks from a fault at a nearby boiler house setting light to empty linen sacks used to transport explosives which had been piled up against the shed. This attribution was later upheld in the official report by a committee headed by the Minister of Munitions, David Lloyd George. Workers and firemen desperately fought to put out the fire, and to remove the explosives from the vicinity, but to little avail: there were three large explosions at about 2:20pm, excavating a large crater some across and deep. A worse disaster was averted: several thousand tons of TNT stored elsewhere on the site did not explode. At least 108 men and boys were killed - none of the plant's female workers were present at the weekend - the youngest aged 17 and 18 and the oldest in their 60s. The dead included all of the factory's fire brigade, 20 workers from the neighbouring Cotton Powder Company who came to assist, and six soldiers from the 4th Battalion, The Buffs (East Kent Regiment), that formed the site's military guard. Many of the remains could not be identified, and another seven people were recorded missing. Almost 100 others were injured. The detonation broke windows in Southend, away across the Thames Estuary, and it was heard over away, with reports from Norwich and France. The disaster remained relatively unknown due to wartime press censorship. Many bodies were buried together at Love Lane cemetery in Faversham on Thursday 6 April 1917, at a service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury Randall Davidson, with further burials on 7 and 8 April. In all, 73 were interred in the mass grave, but only 34 could be identified, with the others recorded as \\"male person unknown\\". The families of another 35 victims elected to bury their bodies elsewhere. The factory was quickly rebuilt and returned to production. Memorial The mass grave is a long rectangular block about orientated north‚Äìsouth, surrounded by a low granite kerb punctuated by low capped piers, with urns on pillars to either side of steps at each end. In the centre of the block is a free-standing granite Celtic cross standing on three steps, about high, with an inscription \\"SACRED TO THE / MEMORY OF THE MEN / WHO DIED IN THE SERVICE OF THEIR / COUNTRY 2ND. APRIL 1916. // ‚ÄòFATHER IN THY GRACIOUS KEEPING / LEAVE NOW THY SERVANTS SLEEPING.‚Äô \\". The quotation is taken from the 1870 hymn \\"Now the labourer's task is o'er\\" by John Ellerton. The names of the buried are listed in lead lettering along the edge of the kerb wall. A separate stone nearby lists the names of 35 victims who were buried elsewhere. The memorial was paid for by the Explosives Loading Company, which also undertook to maintain it. It was unveiled and dedicated the Archbishop of Canterbury Randall Davidson on 27 September 1917. It became a Grade II listed building in 1989, and was upgraded to Grade II* in March 2016.

It commemorates the workers who died in accidents at National Shell Filling Factory, Chilwell during the First World War, particularly the large explosion on 1 July 1918. The large free-standing pyramidal monument, enclosed by chains carried on shell casings, was unveiled in 1919 and became a Grade II listed building in 1987. Background Munitions production in the UK expanded considerably after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, but production failed to keep pace with the demand, with shortages leading to a Shell Scandal in 1915. The Munitions of War Act 1915 gave the government the power to establish different types of National Factories. National Filling Factory No 6 was established in Chilwell, Nottinghamshire, as a filling factory, where empty shell casings that were manufactured elsewhere could be filled with explosives. It opened in February 1916, to fill high explosive shells of or larger calibres, with amatol, usually made on site by mixing one part TNT to four parts ammonium nitrate. The factory was under the oversight and management of Godfrey Chetwynd, 8th Viscount Chetwynd, who introduced special features to improve efficiency and safety: by 1916 it was filling 130,000 shells with 900 tons of amatol each week. In its first two years of operations, there were several small isolated explosions at the factory that killed one or two people each. A massive explosion occurred on the evening of 1 July 1918 when 8 tons of explosives were detonated, destroyed the Mixing House, the Mixing House Extension, the TNT Mill, the TNT Stores, and other buildings. The blast affecting buildings up to away. The explosion killed 134 people, accounting for more than half of the 218 fatalities at in National Filling Factories during the First World War. The dead including 25 women, and all of the workers in the Mixing House and TNT Mill, but only 32 of the bodies could be identified. Another 250 people were injured. Fires caused by the explosion were brought under control within half an hour, preventing another 15 tons of TNT exploding. Despite the widespread damage, rapid repairs allowed the factory to continue its shell filling work the next day. Mass grave market at St Mary's Church, Attenborough The dead were buried in mass graves at the parish church in Attenborough. A Home Office committee published its report into the explosion on 7 August, and the police investigated suspicions of sabotage. Neither conclusively identified the cause of the explosion. For their acts of bravery during the incident, twelve workers were awarded the British Empire Medal, and the works manager Arthur Hilary Bristowe, who tipped burning TNT from conveyor belt trays in the TNT Mill, received the Edward Medal. The site later became a Royal Army Ordnance Corps Depot, and it is still within the restricted area of Chetwynd Barracks.

It commemorates all those killed at the factory in addition to the 134 killed in July 1918. It was built by the factory's workmen, under the supervision of the factory's construction manager, Mr SA Kay. The structure comprises a large concrete truncated square pyramid, standing on three steps and topped by a short obelisk. Around the top step are mounted shell casings joined by chains, all painted white, with an opening to the road at the front. It is surrounded on three sides by a low wall and hedge. Ashlar panels on the faces of the pyramid bear inscriptions with a dedication and names. The front panel facing the road bears Lord Chetwynd's monogram, and the main dedicatory inscription: \\"ERECTED / TO THE MEMORY OF THOSE / MEN AND WOMEN / WHO LOST THEIR LIVES BY EXPLOSIONS / AT THE NATIONAL SHELL FILLING FACTORY / CHILWELL / 1916 TO 1918\\" and then statistical details of the factory's output \\"PRINCIPAL HISTORICAL FACTS / OF THE FACTORY / FIRST SOD TURNED 13TH SEPTEMBER 1915 / FIRST SHELL FILLED 8TH JANUARY 1916 / NUMBER OF SHELLS FILLED / WITHIN ONE YEAR OF / CUTTING THE FIRST SOD / 1,200,000 / TOTAL SHELLS FILLED / 19,359,000 / REPRESENTING 50.8% OF THE TOTAL / OUTPUT OF HIGH EXPLOSIVE SHELL / BOTH LYDDITE AND AMATOL 60PD TO 15INCH / PRODUCED IN GREAT BRITAIN DURING THE WAR / TOTAL TONNAGE OF EXPLOSIVE USED / 121,360 TONS / TOTAL WEIGHT OF FILLED SHELL / 1,100,000 TONS\\".

Born in Melbourne, she has worked in various Aboriginal communities and today works in Sydney, Australia. Her work has focused on social, political, and environmental issues. Her posters about Aboriginal rights and Aboriginal life appear in major gallery collections in Australia.  Biography  Marie was born in Melbourne, Australia, in September 1953. She grew up on Air Force bases in Darwin, Australia, at Richmond near Sydney, and at HMAS Albatross, a naval base on the South Coast of New South Wales. During the 1960s her family lived in the Philippines until they returned to Sydney. In 1976, McMahon joined the Earthworks Poster Collective at the Tin Sheds Art Workshop, University of Sydney. While working there she contributed to a catalogue of posters that ‚Äúwere sometimes didactic and often provocative‚Äù. Recruited with other screen printers by the Aboriginal Arts Board, in 1980 she went to the Northern Territory to work at Tiwi Designs. Later in the 1980s Marie worked as a designer at Redback Graphix in Wollongong and Sydney, where she produced well-known posters related to health issues for Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.  Her Works  As a printer she has produced etchings, linocuts, lithographs, and screen prints. Among her many well-known posters are ‚ÄòYou are on Aboriginal land‚Äô and the Australian Government‚Äôs health promotion ‚ÄòBeat the grog‚Äô and ‚ÄòCondoman‚Äô AIDS awareness campaign, developed in collaboration with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workers. In 1976, Marie began working at The Tin Sheds Workshop at the University of Sydney, where a number of feminists were putting out posters related to feminist issues. In 2015, the Sydney University Gallery held an exhibition titled Girls in the Tin Shed; Marie had several works in the exhibition. In the 1970s, posters proliferated as inexpensive ways to express ideas through art. When asked about that period McMahon said the women artists \\"saw themselves as outsiders to the mainstream art establishment, inspired by acts like the Sex Pistols and the Clash.\\" Marie also produced prints at the Australian Print Workshop in Fitzroy, Victoria and so was included in a major exhibition Place Made: Australian Print Workshop held in early 2004 at the National Gallery of Australia (NGA). When the NGA acquired many prints from the Workshop, they acquired more than 90 of McMahon‚Äôs prints. From 1988 to 1996, McMahon worked in the Tiwi Islands while living at Batchelor, south of Darwin. From 2000 to 2001 at she lived Gunbalanya, Arnhem Land, where she produced a series of collages interpreting the landscapes around her. From 2009‚Äì2010, her works have dealt with political conflict in Indochina and Cambodia.  Women‚Äôs Domestic Needlework Group  In 1976 McMahon and artist Frances (Budden) Phoenix initiated The Women's Domestic Needlework Group (WDNG) Their aim was to reclaim the creative, but historically undervalued, practices of embroidery, knitting, crochet, lace making and needlework. The most significant of their four exhibitions was the D‚ÄôOyley exhibition at Watters Gallery in Sydney in 1979. The exhibition, focusing on women‚Äôs ‚Äòfancywork‚Äô featured more than 700 handmade doilies that were collected from various thrift shops. The exhibition was sponsored the Crafts Board of the Australia Council.

During the latter conflict, she conducted operations in support of the Japanese invasion of the Philippines, the Battle of Midway, the Guadalcanal campaign, and the Battle of the Eastern Solomons. She was sunk in 1942. After she was renumbered I-123 in 1938, the number I-23 was assigned to a later submarine which also served during World War II. Design I-123 and her three sister ships ‚Äî I-21 (later renumbered ), I-22 (later renumbered ), and I-24 (later renumbered ) ‚Äî were the Imperial Japanese Navy's only submarine minelayers.Boyd and Yoshida, p. 18. They were known in Japan by the type name , commonly shortened to . The Kiraisen-type design was based on that of the Imperial German Navy minelaying submarine , a Type UB III submarine which was the largest of seven German submarines transferred to Japan as a war reparation after World War I and served in the Imperial Japanese Navy as O-6 from 1920 to 1921. Like UB-125, the Kiraisen-type submarines had two diesel engines producing a combined , could carry 42 mines, and had four torpedo tubes and a single deck gun ‚Äî a gun on the Japanese submarines in contrast to a gun on UB-125. Compared to the German submarine, they were larger ‚Äî longer, and displacing 220 more tons on the surface and 300 more tons submerged ‚Äî and had a longer range both on the surface ‚Äî farther at ‚Äî and submerged ‚Äî farther at . They were slower than UB-125 both surfaced and submerged, carried two fewer torpedoes, and had could dive to only compared to for UB-125. Construction and commissioning Built by Kawasaki at Kobe, Japan, I-123 was ordered with the name Submarine No. 50, but by the time her keel was laid on 12 June 1925 she had been renamed I-23. She was launched on 19 March 1927 and was completed and commissioned on 28 April 1928. Service history=Early service Upon commissioning, I-23 was assigned to the Yokosuka Naval District. After her sister ship I-24 suffered damage to her main ballast tanks while I-23 and I-24 were conducting deep diving trials on 25 May 1935, I-23 was decommissioned on 25 November 1935 to have her main ballast tanks reinforced. She was recommissioned after the work was completed, but in 1936 all four submarines of her class had their designed diving depth limited to . Second Sino-Japanese War On 7 July 1937 the first day of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident took place, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War. In September 1937, Submarine Division 9, consisting of I-23 and her sister ship I-24, moved to a base at Tsingtao, China, and began operations in northern Chinese waters as part of a Japanese blockade of China.Boyd and Yoshida, p. 54. In December 1937, the light cruiser arrived at Tsingtao to serve as flagship of Submarine Squadron 3, which consisted of Submarine Division 13 (made up of I-21 and I-22) as well as Submarine Division 9 (I-23 and I-24). I-23 was renumbered I-123 on 1 June 1938, freeing up her previous number for the new submarine , whose keel was laid that year. In an effort to reduce international tensions over the conflict in China, Japan withdrew its submarines from Chinese waters in December 1938, and I-123 returned to Japan. 1939‚Äì1941 In mid-1940, I-123 and all three of her sister ships ‚Äî which, like her, had been renumbered on 1 June 1938, I-21 becoming I-121, I-22 becoming I-122, and I-24 becoming I-124 ‚Äî underwent conversion into submarine tankers. Retaining their minelaying and torpedo capabilities, they were modified so that each of them could carry 15 tons of aviation gasoline with which to refuel flying boats, allowing the flying boats to extend their range during reconnaissance and bombing missions by meeting the submarines in harbors and lagoons for more fuel. By 1 May 1941, I-123 was based at Kure and her division, Submarine Division 9, was subordinated to Submarine Squadron 6, which in turn reported to the 6th Fleet. She became the flagship of Submarine Division 9 on 2 August 1941. By November 1941, as the Imperial Japanese Navy began to deploy in preparation for the impending conflict in the Pacific, Submarine Squadron 3 was part of the 3rd Fleet, and during that month I-123 moved from Japan to Samah on Hainan Island in China. World War IIFirst war patrol= On 1 December 1941, I-123 departed Samah along with I-124 to begin what would become her first war patrol. Attached to the Philippines Seizure Force, the two submarines proceeded to the Philippines to support the impending Japanese invasion there. While at sea, I-123 received the message \\"Climb Mount Niitaka 1208\\" () from the Combined Fleet on 2 December 1941, indicating that war with the Allies would commence on 8 December 1941 Japan time (7 December 1941 on the other side of the International Date Line in Hawaii, where the war would begin with Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor). At 04:20 on 6 December 1941, I-123 suffered a foreplane failure that prevented her from submerging for the remainder of her patrol. She nonetheless laid forty Type 88 Mark 1 mines in Balabac Strait on 7 December 1941, then proceeded to Cam Ranh Bay in Japanese-occupied French Indochina for repairs. The crippled submarine was still en route when World War II began in East Asia on 8 December 1941, but she arrived safely at Cam Ranh Bay on 9 December 1941, completing her first war patrol. It is possible that the minefield I-123 laid in Balabac Strait sank the United States Navy submarine on 13 August 1944. =Second war patrol= With her foreplanes again functional, I-123 set out from Cam Ranh Bay on 15 December 1941 to begin her second war patrol, bound for the Java Sea. At 20:53 on 18 December 1941 she unsuccessfully attacked an Allied transport in the Celebes Sea. On 22 December 1941, she reported sighting two aircraft carriers in the Java Sea. She laid mines off the northern entrance to the harbor at Surabaya, Java, between 02:46 and 05:26 on 23 December 1941. Reassigned along with I-121, I-122, and I-124 to Submarine Group A on 26 December 1941, I-123 concluded her patrol on 31 December 1941 with her arrival at newly captured Davao on Mindanao in the Philippines, where she met I-121, I-124, and the submarine tender . =Third war patrol= I-123 departed Davao on 10 January 1942 to begin her third war patrol, bound for the Beagle Gulf-Van Diemen Gulf area off the northern coast of Australia. She arrived off the western entrance of Clarence Strait off Australia's Northern Territory on 18 January 1942. She was in the Beagle Gulf west of Darwin, Australia, on the morning of 20 January 1942 when she sighted the U.S. Navy oiler heading toward Darwin escorted by the destroyers and . Misidentifying Trinity as a transport, I-123 fired four Type 89 torpedoes at Trinity at after 05:20. The sound man aboard I-123 reported hearing one torpedo hit Trinity, but in fact all four torpedoes missed, although Trinity sighted three of them and reported the attack. Alden conducted a brief depth charge attack at 05:41 before losing sound contact on I-123, which escaped unscathed. That evening after 20:46, I-123 laid 30 mines in Dundas Strait off Cape Don on the Northern Territory's Cobourg Peninsula. She then returned to Davao, ending her patrol with her arrival there on 3 February 1942. =Fourth war patrol= After replenishment and repairs by Ch≈çgei, I-123 put to sea from Davao on 19 February 1942 to begin her fourth war patrol, tasked with laying mines in Torres Strait between New Guinea and Australia. She arrived in her patrol area there on 25 February 1942, replacing I-122, which had departed the area to meet Ch≈çgei for replenishment at Staring Bay on the coast of Celebes. That night, I-123 laid 40 mines west of Booby Island. Her patrol otherwise was uneventful, and it ended with her arrival at Staring Bay, where she paused from 9 to 14 March 1942 before proceeding to Yokosuka. Arriving there on 25 March 1942, she began an overhaul and repairs. =Midway operation= With her overhaul complete, I-123 departed Yokosuka bound for Kwajalein on 7 May 1942, deploying to participate in Operation MI, the planned Japanese invasion of Midway Atoll. She stopped at Kwajalein from 17 to 19 May 1942, then got back underway to support a preliminary phase of the Midway operation, Operation K-2, which called for I-121 and I-123 to refuel two Kawanishi H8K (Allied reporting name \\"Emily\\") flying boats at the French Frigate Shoals in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands so that the two aircraft could conduct a reconnaissance flight over Pearl Harbor, while I-122 patrolled south of Pearl Harbor to rescue the crews of the aircraft if they were shot down and the submarine operated east of the French Frigate Shoals to provide a radio beacon for the planes. The aircraft were scheduled to arrive at the French Frigate Shoals on 30 May 1942 and make their Pearl Harbor flight on 31 May.\\"Midway: The Approach\\", pacificeagles.com, November 26, 2017. When I-123 arrived off the French Frigate Shoals on 29 May 1942, however, she found the U.S. Navy seaplane tenders and already operating flying boats there. She radioed her news of this sighting after she surfaced that night, and the reconnaissance flight was postponed for a day. When I-123 again observed the French Frigate Shoals on 31 May, she found the American ships still there and noted U.S. Navy flying boats landing in the lagoon, and this news resulted in the Japanese concluding that the U.S. Navy was using the atoll as a base. The Japanese decided to cancel the reconnaissance flights entirely. With their supporting mission for the aircraft cancelled, I-121, I-122, and I-123 took patrol stations on 4 June 1942 in support of the scheduled invasion of Midway. The Battle of Midway began that day, and it ended on 7 June 1942 in a decisive Japanese defeat. The Japanese cancelled the invasion of Midway. I-123 concluded her patrol with her arrival at Kwajalein in company with I-121 and I-122 on 25 June 1942. She later returned to Japan, arriving at Yokosuka. =Fifth war patrol= During I-123‚Ä≤s stay at Yokosuka, Submarine Division 13 was resubordinated to Submarine Squadron 7 in the 8th Fleet on 14 July 1942. On 26 July 1942, she departed Yokosuka to take up her new duties, arriving at Truk on 2 August 1942. While I-123 was at Truk, the Guadalcanal campaign began on 7 August 1942 with U.S. amphibious landings on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, Florida Island, Gavutu, and Tanambogo in the southeastern Solomon Islands. That day, she departed Truk to begin her fifth war patrol, with orders to operate off Indispensable Strait in the Solomon Islands. After she put to sea, however, she received orders diverting her to conduct a reconnaissance of Lungga Roads off the northern coast of Guadalcanal. On 11 August 1942, she arrived off Lungga Point on Guadalcanal's northern coast. She surfaced after 11:00 on 12 August 1942 off Lungga Point and bombarded United States Marine Corps positions on Guadalcanal, firing 14 rounds from her deck gun. The Marines returned fire, but I-123 submerged with no damage. Later that day, she received orders to contact Imperial Japanese Army troops at Taivu Point, further east along Guadalcanal's north coast. She attempted to contact them on 16 August 1942, but did not find the troops. On 24 August 1942, as the two-day Battle of the Eastern Solomons began, I-123 received orders to contact an Imperial Japanese Army coastwatcher unit on the coast of Florida Island. After she failed to find the coastwatchers, she received new orders to patrol east of Savo Island. =Loss= In her new patrol area, I-123 was forced to submerge by an Allied seaplane at 01:25 on 29 August 1942. She reported the encounter in a message she transmitted at 03:12. The Japanese never heard from her again. At 08:05 the destroyer minelayer , steaming to Guadalcanal as a part of U.S. Navy Task Unit 62.2.4, sighted the conning tower of I-123 as she submerged east of Savo Island. Using a magnetic anomaly detector to track I-123, Gamble conducted several depth charge attacks against her between 08:44 and 11:47. After the last attack, Gamble passed through a large oil slick and her crew observed a large air bubble breaking the surface. Gamble later recovered broken deck planking from the water. It marked the end of I-123, sunk at . The Japanese submarine , patrolling to the west of I-123, reported hearing a number of explosions coming from I-123‚Ä≤s location at the time of Gamble‚Ä≤s attack. On 1 September 1942, the Imperial Japanese Navy officially declared I-123 to be presumed lost with all 71 hands off Guadalcanal. She was stricken from the Navy list on 5 October 1942.

Rugged Island is a popular destination for kayaking, sailing, camping, and guided hikes to the abandoned fort on its shores in the summer. History The island was largely uninhabited until 1942. During World War II, the United States Army built a pair of forts, Fort McGilvray on Caines Head, and Fort Bulkley on the southern tip of Rugged Island. A jeep access road from Mary's Bay to the fort, searchlights, fire control stations, a large gun battery, and a radar installation were also constructed. At its peak, Fort Bulkley was home to 80 men.

First entering service in 1976, it has undergone a number of different upgrades and improvements over time which are denoted by different \\"marks\\" such as the LAV II, LAV III etc. It continues to form the backbone of the Canadian Army's combat vehicle fleet. The LAV series of vehicles exist in a number of different variants and are used in a number of different roles such as Armoured Fighting Vehicles, Infantry Fighting Vehicles, Armoured Engineer Vehicles, Command Posts, Ambulances, Repair and Recovery vehicles, etc. LAV I The Armoured Vehicle General Purpose (AVGP) project led to the procurement of the first generation of the Light Armoured Vehicle (LAV I) vehicle and predominantly consisted of three variants ordered by the Canadian military in the 1970s entering service in 1974. The AVGP variants were the Cougar armoured fighting vehicle, the Grizzly Armoured Personnel Carrier, and the Husky Armoured Recovery Vehicle which were all based on the six-wheeled version of the Swiss MOWAG Piranha I. The Canadian Army retired all AVGP variants beginning in 2005. However, a number of the retired vehicles were transferred to other militaries and police forces, where they continue to serve. The AVGP had propellers and trim vanes for amphibious use, like the eight-wheeled Bison, which was the vehicle family's immediate successor. The Canadian Army's LAV III, the United States Marine Corps' LAV-25, and the US Army's Stryker are other variants of the LAV family and directly evolved from the Canadian designs. History Cougar swimming Cougar The AVGP variants were introduced into Canadian service in the late 1970s. Intended for use only in Canada, they were pressed into service for several United Nations missions, including UNPROFOR and the mission to Somalia. One Grizzly was captured by Serb forces in the late 1990s, despite it being present on a peace keeping mission. The Cougar was used for training in Canada as an armoured fighting vehicle and informally labelled a \\"tank trainer\\". During the 1980s and 1990s, it was used by armoured units as a fire support vehicle, for those units not equipped with the Leopard tank. The squadrons equipped with the Cougar in those regiments were humorously referred to as the \\"boat squadron\\" as opposed to the reconnaissance squadrons, which were equipped with the Lynx, and later the Coyote (another AVGP successor). The Grizzly was used as an armoured personnel carrier in regular force infantry battalions not equipped with the M113 APC, and also by reserve units. The majority of vehicles had their marine propulsion systems removed. Under the Wheeled LAV Life Extension project, the Canadian Forces planned to convert Grizzly and Husky vehicles to support variants, such as Command Post and Mobile Repair Team Vehicle. However, the project was cancelled in 2005, and the vehicles retired. In May 2007, the Edmonton Police Service accepted the donation of a disarmed Grizzly from the Canadian Army. In March 2010, the Canadian Army donated two disarmed Cougar AVGPs to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia for use by the Emergency Response Team. They were retrofitted to transport ERT assault teams into hazardous areas where transport in unarmoured vehicles would not be safe. In April 2014, the department of National Defence donated a Cougar AVGP to the Windsor Police Service in Windsor, Ontario. =Use in Africa= In June 2005, the Canadian government announced plans to loan 105 AVGPs (100 Grizzlys and 5 Huskys) to African peacekeepers in the Darfur region of Sudan. The AVGP was considered sufficiently modern to be useful in this low-intensity conflict. Canada planned to arrange for civilian contractors to maintain these vehicles. As the vehicles contained some U.S.-manufactured or licensed parts, U.S. permission would be required to loan the vehicles. Initially, the vehicles were to be shipped without their Cadillac-Gage turrets. The vehicles arrived in Senegal in the late summer of 2005. The Sudanese government required various kinds of assurances before they would allow peacekeepers to use the vehicles in Sudan. On November 18, 2005 the vehicles started arriving in Sudan, in white livery, with their turrets.https://web.archive.org/web/20190320081240/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/armoured- vehicles-approved-for-sudan/article22506799/ The loan of vehicles for peace- keeping service in Sudan was originally for one year. However, the loan was extended, and transferred from the African Union to the United Nations. According to Amnesty International, the soldiers who used the loaned vehicles served in Sudan for too short a term to be properly trained and become experienced. One of the vehicles was destroyed by a rocket-propelled grenade. A second vehicle was damaged when it rammed a more heavily armed, but unarmoured Technical vehicle. =Use in Uruguay= In 2008, the Uruguayan Army bought 44 surplus Cougars from the Canadian Army. They were rebuilt without the turret by the Chilean MOWAG-Piranha builder FAMAE, as they will act as armoured personnel carriers for the UN deployment in the Republic of Congo (MONUC), and domestically. In 2009, Uruguay bought 98 Grizzlys and 5 Huskys that were on loan with the AMIS/UNAMID mission in Darfur. It's reported in the vehicles were placed under modernization under a contract with FAMAE since 2011 by installing new engines and gearboxes, as well as preventive maintenance to keep them in good condition.

They were initially purchased and intended for operation by the Canadian Forces Primary Reserve, but were rapidly appropriated by the regular force of the Canadian Army. It was procured in two main variants, the Coyote armoured fighting vehicle and the Bison armoured utility vehicle which filled a number of roles. LAV II Coyote The Light Armoured Vehicle II (LAV II) Coyote has been in service from 1996 and was acquired for use in the light reconnaissance (scout) role, although was also initially used as an armoured fighting vehicle in the role of medium tank trainer within armoured squadrons in the same way as the AVGP it replaced. In service since 1996, the Coyote is a later generation of the LAV-25 and is of the same family and similar generation as the Bison APC and the Australian ASLAV. =Armament= The Coyotes mount a 25√ó137mm M242 Bushmaster chain gun and two 7.62√ó51mm NATO C6 general purpose machine guns. One of the machine guns is mounted coaxial to the main gun while the other is pintle-mounted in front of the crew commander's hatch. The main gun is equipped with dual ammunition feeds that allow for separate weapons effects, selectable by the gunner/crew commander; the standard load is a belt of armour-piercing sabot rounds and a belt of HE-T explosive/fragmentation rounds. The main gun and coax machine gun are 2-axis stabilized. The turret is equipped with a laser rangefinder, but no ballistic computer; elevation and lead corrections are applied manually by the gunner using multi-stadia reticules in the day, thermal, and image intensification sights. The turret is also equipped with grenade dischargers that can be loaded with smoke and fragmentation grenades. =Mobility= The Coyote is powered by a Detroit Diesel 6V53T engine developing , and can reach speeds of (on road). The Coyote has a maximum road range of . It uses a larger wheel than initially used on the Bison and AVGP (these vehicles were later retrofitted with this wheel). Compared to the later LAV-III family of vehicles, the Coyote is smaller, uses smaller wheels and tires, has a \\"sharp\\" rather than \\"rounded\\" nose profile, and has a smaller, oval driver's hatch. Like the LAV-III, the Coyote can be fitted with additional ceramic bolt-on armour panels for increased protection. The Coyote can be transported on a Hercules C-130 plane but the turret needs first to be removed. =Sub-variants= 12e R√©giment blind√© du Canada Coyotes come in three variants: Command, Mast, and Remote. The Mast and Remote variants have a sophisticated suite of electronic surveillance equipment including radar, video, and infrared surveillance night vision devices. The mast variant has this equipment mounted on a 10-metre telescoping mast that can be extended to raise the surveillance suite out from behind cover. The remote variant of the Coyote has its surveillance suite mounted on two short tripods, which crew can deploy remotely using a 200-metre spool of cable. When first purchased, the Coyote was designated for service with both the Regular Force and Reserve Force, with the Mast variants earmarked for the Regular units and the Remotes designated for the Reserves. Shortly after taking delivery of the vehicles, but before they were assigned to the Reserve units, all Coyotes were reassigned to the Regular Force. =Service history= Since the introduction of the Coyote to the Canadian Armed Forces, the vehicle has served national interest domestically and abroad. The Coyote served during the United Nations/ NATO missions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Kosovo, and in Afghanistan. Domestically, it has been deployed during \\"Operation Grizzly\\" to Kananaskis to secure the 28th G8 summit, the 36th G8 summit, and the G-20 Toronto summit,Barr, Colonel David.\\"The Kananaskis G8 Summit: A Case Study in Interagency Cooperation.\\" journal.forces.gc.ca, 14 July 2008. Retrieved: 5 June 2010.Barr, Colonel David. \\"Mosquitoes could be Huntsville weapon against protesters\\" thestar.com, 22 June 2010. Retrieved: 23 June 2010. in addition to a number of domestic emergency response incidents. The Coyote is currently being retired and is being replaced by a mix of TAPV and LAV VI armoured vehicles. LAV II Bison The LAV II Bison is an armoured vehicle based on the 8x8 LAV-25 platform and was originally designed as an armoured personnel carrier. Entering service in 1990, it was used mainly as an armoured utility vehicle having a number of different sub-variants throughout its years of service. =Design= By starting with a basic LAV-25, the Bison design process took only 7 days. The Bison differs from the baseline LAV-25 by raising the height of the roof, removing the turret ring, placing a commander's cupola behind the driver, and incorporating a rail mount system in the cargo/passenger compartment to quickly change mission specific equipment. The driver is seated in the front-left of the crew compartment. The commander has a slightly raised position directly behind the driver with access to his own hatch and mounted machine gun. The engine is to the right of the crew compartment. The Canadian Forces began upgrading the Bison between 2002 and 2008. The upgrades include improved engine power, new torsion bars, fittings for add-on armour, air conditioning, and the VRS respirator system for NBC defence. =Sub-variants= The Bison's rail mount system allows it to be adapted to a variety of roles without any major modifications. Bisons used by the Canadian Forces have been adapted for use as armoured personnel carriers (original configuration - mostly replaced in this role by the LAV III), 81mm mortar carriers, ambulances (32), Mobile Repair Team (MRT) vehicles (32), Armoured recovery vehicles (32), electronic warfare vehicles (25), and NBC reconnaissance vehicles (4). =Current operators= Map of Bison operators in blue * Australian Army - 97 (See ASLAV Type II) * Canadian Army - 199 (being phased out and replaced by LAV VI variants) * US National Guard - 12 LAV III The LAV III, an infantry fighting vehicle variant originally named the Kodiak by the Canadian Army, is the third generation of the Light Armoured Vehicle (LAV) family of armoured vehicles and first entered service in 1999. It was developed in Canada from the LAV II and Bison variants and is the primary mechanized infantry vehicle of the New Zealand Army and formerly of the Canadian Army. It also forms the basis of the Stryker vehicle used by the US Army and other operators. Development By July 1991, the Canadian Armed Forces had identified the need to replace their aging fleet of 1960s and 1970s era armoured personnel carriers. As a result, $2.8 billion was earmarked for the Multi-Role Combat Vehicle (MRCV) project by the sitting Conservative government. The mandate of the MRCV project was to provide a series of vehicles based on a common chassis which would replace the M113 armored personnel carrier, Lynx reconnaissance vehicle, Grizzly armoured personnel carrier, and Bison armoured personnel carrier. The project was, however, deemed unaffordable and cancelled by March 1992. By 1994, after the Liberal Party had returned to government, the army was still in need of new vehicles. As a result, the army embarked on the Light Armoured Vehicle Project, which would adapt parts of the MRCV Project, and be implemented incrementally to spread out the costs. Also, the requirement to replace the Bisons was dropped. The first phase of the project saw the selection of the Coyote Reconnaissance Vehicle to replace the Lynx. On August 16, 1995, it was announced that General Motors Diesel Division (later renamed GM Defense, and subsequently purchased by General Dynamics Land Systems of London, Ontario) had been awarded the contract to produce the LAV III which would replace the Grizzly and a large portion of the M113 armoured personnel carriers. The LAV III would incorporate the turret and weapon system used with the Coyote (which was produced at the same location). DesignMobility= Canadian infantry dismounting from a LAV III at CFB Gagetown The LAV III is powered by a Caterpillar 3126 diesel engine developing and can reach speeds above 100 kilometres per hour. The vehicle is fitted with 8x8 drive and also equipped with a central tire inflation system, which allows it to adjust to different terrain, including off-road. The LAV III is fitted with a modern anti-locking brake system (ABS). Unlike earlier versions of the LAV, the LAV III does not have amphibious capabilities. Tekapo Military Camp The LAV III faces the same concerns that most other wheeled military vehicles face. Like all wheeled armoured vehicles, the LAV III's ground pressure is inherently higher than a tracked vehicle with a comparable weight. This is because tires will have less surface area in contact with the ground when compared to a tracked vehicle. Higher ground pressure results in an increased likelihood of sinking into soft terrain such as mud, snow and sand, leading to the vehicle becoming stuck. The lower ground pressure and improved traction offered by tracked vehicles also gives them an advantage over vehicles like the LAV III when it comes to managing slopes, trenches, and other obstacles. The LAV III can somewhat compensate for these effects by deflating its tires slightly, meaning that the surface area in contact with the ground increases, and the ground pressure is slightly lowered. A Canadian LAV-III during exercise TRIDENT JUNCTURE However, wheels offer several advantages over tracked vehicles, including lower maintenance for both the vehicle and road infrastructure, quieter movement for improved stealth, greater speed over good terrain, and higher ground clearance. Wheeled vehicle crews are also more likely to survive mine or IED attacks than the crew of a similarly armoured tracked vehicle. The LAV III's turret gives the vehicle a higher centre of gravity than the vehicle was initially designed for. This has led to concerns that the vehicle is more likely to roll over on uneven terrain. While there have been several recorded rollovers (about 16), the most common cause was found to be unstable terrain, specifically road shoulders unexpectedly giving away beneath the vehicle. The weight balance of the LAV III is taken into consideration during driver training, largely mitigating the chances of a rollover. It is considered one of the safest and most well-rounded vehicles of its kind in the world. =Protection= Nanuk Remotely Controlled Weapon The basic armour of the LAV III, covering the Standardization Agreement STANAG 4569 level III, which provides all-round protection against 7.62√ó51mm NATO small calibre rounds. A ceramic appliqu√© armour (MEXAS) can be added, which protects against 14.5√ó114mm heavy calibre rounds from 500 meters. In December 2008 the Government of Canada awarded EODC Engineering, Developing and Licensing Inc. C$81.5 million worth of contracts to provide for add-on-armour kits, modules and spares for its LAV III wheeled armoured personnel carriers. This armour kit is intended to provide increased protection against improvised explosive devices (IED), explosively formed penetrators and 30 mm caliber armour piercing rounds.http://www.3-4cav.asn.au/canada_up_armouring_its_lav_111.pdf The LAV III can be also fitted with cage armour, which provides protection against shaped charges. The LAV III is fitted with a nuclear, biological, chemical (NBC) filtration system accompanied with a GID-3 chemical detector and AN/VDR-2 radiation detector systems. The LAV III was designed to produce a very low and very compact structure to minimize radar and IR-signatures. The LAV III also uses heat-absorbing filters to provide temporary protection against thermal imaging (TIS), image intensifiers and infrared cameras (IR). General Dynamics is in the process of integrating the LAV III with an active protection systemGeneral Dynamics Developing LAV III with Fully Integrated Active Protection System ‚Äì Deagel.com, May 29, 2013 based on the Israeli Trophy system.US-Israeli Team To Demo APS for Canada ‚Äì Defensenews.com, October 15, 2013. The majority of Canadian casualties in Afghanistan have occurred during a patrol aboard a LAV III. This can be explained by the fact that the LAV III is the most commonly used Canadian armoured personnel carrier in theatre, and simply represents a normal association between use and likelihood to encounter a mine or improvised explosive device. The LAV III offers comparable or better protection than most other infantry carriers used in Afghanistan. In an effort to improve protection as a result of experiences in Afghanistan, future LAV III upgrades will likely include improved mine and IED protection. =Armament= The LAV III is fitted with a two-man turret, armed with the M242 Bushmaster 25 mm caliber chain gun and a coaxial 7.62-mm machine gun. One more 5.56 mm or 7.62 mm machine guns is positioned on top of the turret. The LAV III also has eight 76-mm grenade launchers in two clusters of four launchers positioned on each side of the turret. The grenade launchers are intended for smoke grenades. In 2009, a number of LAV III's were modified with a Nanuk remotely controlled weapon station (RCWS) to provide better protection and to increase the chances of survival of the crew against improvised explosive devices and anti-tank mine threats on the battlefield. =Sights= The LAV III is equipped with a daytime optical Thermal Imaging System (TIS) and Generation III Image Intensification (II). The LAV III is equipped with a Tactical Navigation System (TacNav) to assist in navigation and target location tasks. The LAV III is equipped with an LCD monitor directly connected to the vehicle's external cameras, providing real-time images of the battlefield for the passengers. Service history A NZLAV The LAV III and related versions have been used in the following: *United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) *United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) *United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) *United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) *War in Afghanistan (ISAF) *Napier shootings *Operation Lotus *Response to the 2011 Christchurch earthquake *Colombian armed conflict New Zealand The New Zealand armed forces purchased 105 LAV of which 102 were standard vehicles and 3 were redesigned for recovery. In May 2009, two NZLAVs were deployed to support police during the Napier shootings. They protected specialist police while retrieving the body of a deceased police officer from outside the offender's residence. In November 2009, it was announced that three NZLAVs would be deployed to assist NZSAS operations in Afghanistan and they were up-armoured. In 2011, these three LAVs were moved to Bamyan to support the provincial reconstruction team there as they were no longer needed in Kabul due to reduced SAS numbers. Five additional LAVs were also flown to Bamyan. One has since been damaged by a roadside bomb. In May 2012, the New Zealand government announced that it may leave all these LAVs behind in Afghanistan for use by local forces when the New Zealand forces leave in 2013. As of November 2013, all of these deployed LAVs had been returned to New Zealand.

LAV VI The LAV VI is the fourth generation of the Light Armoured Vehicle (LAV) family of armoured vehicles based on the LAV III first entering service in 2013. The Canadian Army plans to replace its entire LAV fleet of various LAV II and LAV III variants with the LAV VI. The vehicle is being acquired in two main variants: a fighting vehicle equipped with the 25mm cannon seen on the LAV II and LAV III, and a support variant labelled the Armoured Combat Support Vehicle (ACSV). History In July 2009, the Canadian Department of National Defence announced that $5 billion would be spent to enhance, replace and repair the army's armoured vehicles. Part of the spending would be used to replace and repair damaged LAV III's due to wear and tear from operations in Afghanistan. As much as 33 percent of the army's light armoured vehicles were out of service. Furthermore, the LAV III's will be upgraded with improved protection and automotive components. The Canadian Armed Forces has lost over 34 vehicles and 359 were damaged during the mission in Afghanistan. The Canadian army has lost 13 LAVs and more than 159 were damaged by roadside bombs or enemy fire. Of the $5 billion announced, approximately 20% of it will be used to upgrade LAV III models. The upgrade will extend the LAV III life span to 2035. The remaining $4 billion is to be spent on a \\"new family of land combat vehicles\\". The Department of National Defence considered the purchase of vehicles meant to accompany the Leopard 2 and to sustain the LAV III into combat. The CV90, the Puma (IFV) and the V√©hicule blind√© de combat d'infanterie were the most likely candidates for the role. A contract of 108 with an option for up to 30 more was considered, but a combination of budget cuts and upgrades to the existing fleet of LAV IIIs have led the Canadian Army to cancel its order for 108 CV90s. On October 21, 2011, the Canadian government announced a $1.1 billion contract to General Dynamics Land Systems to upgrade 550 LAV III combat vehicles. The government said the upgrade is needed to improve protection against mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), which have been the cause of a number of Canadian deaths in Afghanistan. The improvements will also extend the service of the vehicles up to 2035 and will boost troop mobility. The upgrades include a new and more powerful engine, increased armour protection, steering and brake systems. The turret hatches on the LAV III would be made larger and improved fire control, thermal, day and low-light sights, and data displays. The weight of the vehicle would increase from to . The first of 66 upgraded LAV IIIs was delivered on February 1, 2013.Canadian army receives first of 66 upgraded LAV III vehicles ‚Äì Armyrecognition.com, February 1, 2013 The success of the upgrade program and budget pressures led to the cancellation of the Close Combat Vehicle replacement program later that year. In September 2012, the original contract valued to at $1.064 billion to upgrade the 550 LAV III's variants, an infantry section carrier, a command post, an observation post and an engineer vehicle to the LAV VI configuration, was modified. This included an additional $151 million to upgrade 66 LAV III's to the LAV VI with a LAV Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (LRSS) fitted. On February 10, 2017, General Dynamics Land Systems ‚Äì Canada of London, Ontario, was awarded a $404 million order to work on 141 LAV Operational Requirement Integration Task (LORIT) vehicles. This contract will upgrade the remaining LAV III fleet in the Canadian Army to the LAV VI configuration. This brings the Canadian Army's Light Armoured Vehicle III Upgrade (LAVUP) program to a total cost of $1.8 billion. Final completion and delivery of the Canadian Army's Light Armoured Vehicle III Upgrade (LAVUP) to upgrade the LAV III to the LAV VI is expected to be completed by December 2019. On August 16, 2019, the Government of Canada announced its intention to purchase up to 360 Armoured Combat Support Vehicles (ACSVs), and that negotiations with General Dynamics Land Systems Canada had entered the final stages. Based heavily on the LAV 6.0/VI platform, the ACSVs will replace the Bison LAV and the M113 Tracked LAV fleets of the Canadian Armed Forces. On September 5, 2019, Public Services and Procurement Canada on behalf of the Department of National Defence awarded General Dynamics Land Systems Canada a CAD$2 Billion contract for 360 ACSVs, initial spare parts, manuals, training, and various vehicle add-on kits. The various add-on kits incorporated in the procurement include: add-on armour, mine blast & enhanced crew protection, laser warning systems, side protection and remote weapons station kits. The Department of National Defence stated that by procuring similar combat support vehicles in the CAF fleet offers the advantages of reduced training and sustainment costs, in addition to the availability of standard spare parts to fix vehicles quickly during critical operations. The vehicles are expected to support a wide range of operations, including domestic disaster relief and overseas peacekeeping missions. Subsequently, the ACSV will be available in eight variants to provide services such as: ambulances, vehicle recovery, engineering, mobile repair, electronic warfare, troop-carrying, and mobile command posts. Delivery of the first set of vehicles is expected in late 2020, with the last vehicles being delivered in 2025. On May 25, 2020, Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace announced that they had signed a contract worth NOK500 Million (CAD$73.6 Million) with General Dynamics Land Systems - Canada for delivery of the newest generation of Protector Remote Weapons Stations (or RWS) to the Canadian Army. The Protector RWS is to be equipped on Canada's fleet of ACSVs. It was subsequently announced on June 1, 2020, that delivery of the first ACSVs was still on schedule for late 2020 and would not be delayed in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Geographical indications reviewed and recommended by the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO) and published in the Trademarks Journal can be disputed through this process. Similar to oppositions, an objection must be based on at least one of the grounds set out in the Trademarks Act, and it must be filed during the two-month period after the geographical indication first appeared in the Trademarks Journal. Objections are also heard and decided by the Trademarks Opposition Board, an administrative body within CIPO. Legal framework The Trademarks Act and Trademarks Regulations govern objection proceedings in Canada. The legislation identifies the two parties in objection proceedings‚Äîthe responsible authority and the objector. The responsible authority is the entity (e.g., individual, company, country) that requests protection for a geographical indication, and they must have an adequate interest and connection with the geographical indication in order to make a request. Protection can only be sought for geographical indications related to wine, spirits, agricultural products, and food. Meanwhile, the objector is any interested party that may be impacted by a decision to protect the geographical indication in question. In addition, the Trademarks Act sets out the permissible grounds for objection, procedural rules and protections, service requirements, and the timeframe and content requirements for pleadings filed by the responsible authority and objector. The Trademarks Regulations furnish additional information about timeframes and requirements for correspondence, documents, service, evidence, statements, cross-examination, written representations, hearings, and the payment of fees. Grounds for objection The Trademarks Act provides seven available grounds upon which an objection can be based. An objector can assert that, when the geographical indication was published in the Trademarks Journal, it was not actually a geographical indication, it was the same as a popular name for the product in a language that was popular in Canada, and/or it was not protected in the product's home country (unless that country is Canada). Specifically in relation to a geographical indication for an agricultural product or food, an objector can claim that it was confusing with a trademark that was registered, pending, or previously used in Canada and not yet abandoned at the time that the geographical indication was published in the Trademarks Journal. An objection can also be raised about a translation of a geographical indication. An objector can assert that, when the translation was published in the Trademarks Journal, it was not an accurate translation of the geographical indication, and/or it was confusing with a trademark that was registered, pending, or previously used in Canada and not yet abandoned. Specifically in relation to a translation for an agricultural product or food, an objector can claim that it was the same as a popular name for the product in a language that was popular in Canada at the time that the geographical indication was published in the Trademarks Journal. Procedure Before a geographical indication is published in the Trademarks Journal, the responsible authority submits a request to protect the geographical indication and the request is reviewed by CIPO. If the geographical indication satisfies the requirements set out in the Trademarks Act, a recommendation is made to the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry to publish the geographical indication in the Trademarks Journal. Any interested party has two months from the date that the geographical indication first appeared in the Journal to initiate objection proceedings. These proceedings usually involve pleadings, evidence and arguments. All documents must be properly served in the manner and timeframes set out in the Trademarks Act and Trademarks Regulations. Pleadings Proceedings begin when an interested party files a statement of objection against a geographical indication in order to prevent it from receiving protection. The interested party must file an objection during the two-month period after the publication of the geographical indication in the Trademarks Journal, unless a request is made and accepted for a time extension. The statement of objection is required to specify at least one of the grounds set out in the Trademarks Act. In response, the responsible authority must file a counter statement which indicates that they will be contesting the objection. The responsible authority can also request an interlocutory ruling to dismiss the objection (in whole or in part), but this can only be done before a counter statement is filed. If the responsible authority does not take any action, the geographical indication will not receive protection unless a request is made and accepted for a time extension. Evidence Both the interested party (objector) and the responsible authority are required to submit evidence. The objector and responsible authority can also file a statement that they will not be submitting any evidence. If the responsible authority does not take any action at all (either filing evidence or submitting a statement), the geographical indication will not receive protection; likewise, if the objector does not take any action at all (either filing evidence or submitting a statement), the objection will be deemed withdrawn. After both the objector and responsible authority file their evidence, the objector is allowed to respond with additional evidence. Both the responsible authority and objector are also permitted to request cross- examination of the other party's evidence and witnesses. Arguments Both the objector and responsible authority can submit written arguments and/or request to provide oral arguments at a hearing. The objector and responsible authority can also file a statement that they will not be making any arguments. Decision and appeal Once the proceeding is complete, the Trademarks Opposition Board (TMOB, acting on behalf of the Registrar of Trademarks) makes a decision and provides written reasons. The Board can either accept or reject the objection (completely or partially). Decisions of the TMOB can be appealed to the Federal Court of Canada.

Description  This asteroid was first observed by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) space telescope which was placed into Low Earth Orbit in 2009. The asteroid's observation by WISE occurred on 18 August 2017, when it was less than 1 AU from Earth and had a solar elongation of 92¬∞. The accuracy of the WISE data has been both challenged and reaffirmed in published scientific papers. There are wide variations in the absolute magnitude cataloged by various sources such as the Sentry List and the Minor Planet Center, leading to an estimated mean diameter for the asteroid of . These variations in absolute magnitude are in addition to the uncertainty in the size estimate caused by the uncertainty in the albedo which is generally assumed to be 0.14, but typically vary from 0.05 to 0.25 for a body of carbonaceous and stony composition, respectively. ' is an Aten asteroid, meaning that it is an Earth-crossing asteroid that has an orbit smaller than the orbit of the Earth. It has become a lost asteroid, as it has not been seen since 2017. With an observation arc of only 0.46 days, the object has a poorly determined orbit. This is indicated by an uncertainty parameter or condition code of 9 (orbit uncertainty estimate is 0‚àí9, with 0 being good, and 9 being highly uncertain).  Close encounters  As a near-Earth object and a potentially hazardous asteroid ‚Äì meaning that it has an orbit that can make close approaches to the Earth and large enough to cause significant regional damage in the event of impact ‚Äì it is in both the Risk List of the European Space Agency (ESA) - Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and in the Sentry List of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) ‚Äì Center for Near Earth Object Studies. According to the Sentry List, of the possible close encounters with Earth in the foreseeable future, an encounter on 20 February 2024 has the highest Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale value. According to the Near Earth Objects Dynamic Site, of the possible close encounters with Earth in the foreseeable future, an encounter on 31 July 2024 is the most likely. This encounter has a minimum possible distance of zero, meaning that an impact onto Earth is possible.

It was built by Daniel de S√£o Francisco, a Franciscan friar born in Penafiel, Portugal. He arrived in Brazil, initially in Pernambuco, early in the 17th century. He became a friar in the Franciscan convent at Olinda, and moved to Salvador in 1630 during the Dutch occupation of Brazil. Daniel de S√£o Francisco taught theology in Salvador for many years, and was then chosen to negotiate the separation of the Brazilian Franciscan convents from those in Portugal. He negotiated first with the Portuguese crown, then with the Pope in 1647; the first Brazilian Franciscan province was established in 1657. A cornerstone of the church dates to 1654, and construction was financed by both the Franciscans and donors in Bahia. Its design likely influence the Convent and Church of Saint Antony in Iguape, Cachoeira, which was completed by 1680.

It was the first successful junior football competition in Melbourne, and was in existence from 1883 until 1932. For most of its history it was a competition of independent junior level clubs, before it eventually transitioned to become the second eighteens competition for the senior Victorian Football Association. History During the 1870s in Victoria, junior football ‚Äì which was the term used at the time for open age football of a lower standard than senior football, rather than for under age football ‚Äì was mostly administered on an ad hoc basis. A couple of short-lived junior associations had been attempted, but none were successful until the Victorian Junior Football Association was established in April 1883. Clubs represented at the inaugural meeting were Star of Carlton, South Yarra, South Park, Footscray, Brunswick, Emerald-hill, Albion, Richmond, Fortrose, Waverley and North Park. The VFJA, in addition to serving as an administrative body for junior football, ran the junior premiership. At its peak in the early 1890s when it was the only top junior football competition, more than twenty-five clubs competed, and from 1892 until 1894 the competition ran in two divisions to manage its numbers. The establishment of other junior football competitions ‚Äì including the Victorian Second-Rate (1890), Third-Rate (1892) and Fourth-Rate (1893) Junior Football Associations and the Metropolitan Junior Football Association (1892) ‚Äì saw numbers in the VJFA premiership decline rapidly through the 1890s, and by 1899 only seven clubs competed in the VJFA. Eight to twelve teams typically contested the premiership thereafter. The competition typically featured smaller clubs from districts already represented in senior football, or the top clubs from other districts. Four successful VJFA clubs from growing districts ‚Äì West Melbourne, Preston, Northcote and Yarraville ‚Äì ultimately went on to play senior football in the Victorian Football Association. In 1905, John Wren donated a silver shield to serve as a semi-perpetual trophy for the VJFA premiers; like many trophies of the era, it was held temporarily by the reigning premiers, then won permanently by the first team to win it three times. A total of five Wren Shields were awarded during the trophy's history. Strong rivalries resulted in some rough and controversial finals. Two notable finals were played out between Yarraville and Port Melbourne Railway United in the early 1910s. In 1910, with Railway leading by ten points in the final quarter, the primary ball (provided by Yarraville) burst, and was found to have been stabbed with a pen-knife by a spectator; the back-up ball (provided by Railway) could not be inflated because the pump could not be found ‚Äì and Yarraville lodged a protest, which was quickly dismissed, arguing that it should be awarded the game by virtue of Railway not having provided a ready-to-use ball. Yarraville won the replay, but Railway won a challenge final which was condemned for its violence. Then in 1912, Railway originally won the final by three points, but Yarraville successfully protested one of Railway's second quarter goals on the grounds of goal umpire error, and the match was reversed to a three-point Yarraville victory; as minor premier, Railway still had the right to challenge for the premiership, but refused as its own act of protest, forfeiting the premiership to Yarraville and almost being kicked out the association as a result. The VJFA eventually transitioned to become the VFA Second Eighteens during the 1920s. This began in 1924, when the competition expanded from twelve teams to eighteen in two divisions ‚Äì one division set aside for clubs who played on the same grounds as their senior VFA counterparts, and one for clubs with their own grounds. All Melbourne- based senior VFA clubs were required to affiliate with a junior team in the VJFA, and an agreement was put in place to lift some restrictions on in-season player movements between the senior or junior clubs, making the affiliated junior clubs functionally closer to seconds teams. In 1926, after the 1924 player transfer agreement ended, the VFA moved to convert its affiliated junior clubs into genuine second eighteens controlled by the senior clubs; and, starting from 1928, all other clubs were excluded and the VFJA served wholly as a VFA seconds competition, with free player interchanges between senior and junior level permitted until 1 August each year. The VFJA can be considered to have ceased to exist, replaced by the VFA Second Eighteens, starting from the 1928 season; however, the VJFA name and the Wren Shield as a premiership trophy were both retained until the end of 1932. It was only at this point that competition was formally renamed the VFA Second Eighteens and the Wren Shield was discontinued. The VFA Second Eighteens and its successors, continued to operate until the end of the 2017 season.

The yeshiva later moved to Kamyenyets, then part of Poland, and currently in Belarus, and is therefore often referred to as the Kaminetz Yeshiva or simply Kaminetz. The yeshiva was famously led by Rabbi Boruch Ber Leibowitz. Early Years= Founding  Originally, Slabodka boasted the famous Knesses Yisrael yeshiva, founded by Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel in 1882. However, in 1897, controversy broke out in the yeshiva, as many of the students were opposed to the yeshiva strong focus on mussar (Jewish ethics), as opposed to only studying Talmud. The yeshiva therefore split into two, with the one against mussar going under the name Knesses Beis Yitzchok (named for the previous rabbi of Kaunas, Rabbi Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor). The rav of Slabodka, Rabbi Moshe Danishevsky, served as rosh yeshiva. Rabbi Moshe Mordechai Epstein, the rosh yeshiva of Knesses Yisrael, served alongside Rabbi Danishevsky in the town's beis din (Torah court). Despite the friction between the two yeshivos at the time of their division, the cooperation between the two rosh yeshivas thawed the ice. Rabbi Chaim Rabinowitz also served as rosh yeshiva. However, a controversy between pro- and anti-Zionists in the yeshiva, and Rabbi Rabinowitz left the yeshiva. Rabbi Baruch Ber Leibowitz, a student of Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik and formerly a rosh yeshiva in Halusk, was appointed as rosh yeshiva.  Rabbi Baruch Ber Leibowitz  Despite the fact that Knesses Beis Yitzchak was not a mussar yeshiva, Rabbi Baruch Ber himself was uncomfortable being labeled as an opponent to mussar. His son-in-law, Rabbi Reuven Grozovsky, who taught in the yeshiva, was a student of the Knesses Yisrael yeshiva in Slabodka, and Rabbi Leibowitz said that only Knesses Yisrael could've produced such a fine personality. Both of his sons-in-law, Rabbi Grozovsky and Rabbi Yaakov Moshe Berstein, taught in the yeshiva.  World War I  When World War I broke out in 1914, the yeshiva fled Slabodka for Minsk, and when the war reached there as well, the yeshiva moved further east, settling in Kremenchug in Ukraine, also under Russian Rule, in 1917; Rabbi Leibowitz was with the yeshiva throughout its travels. However, war was rampant in Kremenchug also, with fighting between Ukrainian nationalists and the Russians, as well as between the Red and White armies, and in the yeshiva moved again in 1921, this time to Vilna, a bustling city in Lithuania with a large Jewish population, where they remained for five years. In Vilna, the action of the big city served as a disturbance, and Rabbi Leibowitz moved the yeshiva to Kaminetz, a city in the Second Polish Republic.  Golden Years  The yeshiva was welcomed by the Kaminetz Jewish community; the community marched out to greet them, clad in holiday attire, with an orchestra leading the way. Rabbi Leibowitz was seated on an fancy chair, upholstered in velvet, and lifted into the air. The procession then walked with the yeshiva until they reached the yeshiva's new building. A festive meal was then had. The yeshiva grew exponentially in their new home, with as many as 350-400 students (generally in their late twenties, although a few students were in their thirties), with another 50 in the mechina (a preparatory school for younger students), and seven men in the kollel. Students flocked to the yeshiva from all over the continent, as well as from Palestine and America. The growth of the yeshiva led to a lack of space in their building, and so Mr. Gershon Galin, a Kaminetz native who had emigrated to the United States, took upon himself to erect a new building, and took the first step by purchasing a piece of land and being the first one to donate towards the building fund. In 1932, the building's foundation was laid. On the eighth day Chanukah in 1937, the dedication of the new building was celebrated, in the presence of rabbis from throughout the region.  World War II = Exile to Lithuania  Modern photo of Rasein in Lithuania In early September 1939, the German Army invaded Kaminetz. They told the local residents that they did not plan to stay for long, as they had signed the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, which stated that the Soviet Union would get the eastern half of Poland, and treated them decently. The yeshiva stayed in Kaminetz during the German occupation, and had prayed regularly during the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana. The Germans left the city, leaving behind only a small headquarters, at the time that the Russians were supposed to come. However, the Russians didn't come right away, and local gentile anti-Semites took advantage of the anarchy to attack Jews and loot their properties. Ironically, the Jews went to the local Nazi headquarters and requested that their soldiers return to protect them until the Soviets arrived. The Russians arrived on the day before Yom Kippur. Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzensky, the rabbi of Vilna as well as gadol hador (leader of the generation), sent a message to all of the yeshivos under Russian rule that they should escape to Vilna; the Russians had taken the city from Poland and were going to give it back to Lithuania (which it had previously been part of). Therefore, many yeshivos escaped and crowded into Vilna. In the Kaminetz Yeshiva, many of the foreign and Polish students returned home, leaving only half of the yeshiva, approximately 160 students, in the yeshiva, and together they fled to Vilna. In Vilna, local Jews arranged for the yeshiva to study in the Lokishok Bais Medrash and families offered to take in refugees for lodging. The Lithuanian prime minister, who treated the Jews well, decided that having fifteen thousand refugees crowded into the capital city was unsustainable and he therefore ordered the yeshivos to disperse to the nearby towns. The Kaminetz Yeshiva settled in Rasein, where the classes continued as usual. Rabbi Leibowitz passed away then in 1939.  Dispersion  Despite their temporary safety, the students understood that they were in the center of a war-zone and tried all they could to leave the country, but all their attempts went in vain. About a year and half later, the Russians reassumed control of Lithuania; when they discovered that the yeshiva students in the countryside were attempting to leave for America, they made plans to send the yeshivos to Siberian labor camps, farther away from the border, as they were worried about anti-communists being so close to the front, lest they join forces with the Nazis and fight against the Soviet Union. Russian soldiers had seized Jewish homes, and the hosts warned the yeshiva students of their plan of relocation. Many went into hiding, while many went along with the plan; the ones who stayed behind in Lithuania ended up getting killed by the Nazis three days later. The students that were deported did not end up going to Siberia, rather to the remote Komi Republic in Russian Asia. They ended up getting split into four groups. The first was dropped off in the village of Zeschart; there were fifteen Kaminetz students in the group. The second group was dropped off in Aykany; the third group, consisting of forty people, in Syktivkar; and the fourth group was left 150 kilometres from the capital city. Among the fourth group was Rabbi Naftali Leibowitz, the yeshiva's mashgiach.  Legacy  Yeshiva Toras Emes Kaminetz was founded in Brooklyn in 1934. Rabbi Moshe Bernstein, son-in-law of Rabbi Boruch Ber Leibowitz and a rebbi (Torah teacher) in the yeshiva in Europe, together with Rabbi Yaakov Moshe Leibowitz, son of Rabbi Baruch Ber, reestablished the yeshiva in Jerusalem in 1945. Notable teachers there were Rabbi Moshe Aharon Stern (he) and Rabbi Chaim Shlomo Leibowitz (he). Rabbi Yitzchok Scheiner is the current rosh yeshiva.

Biography  X√≥n Riquiac studied history at the University of San Carlos of Guatemala and received a master's degree in the history of science from the Pontifical Catholic University of S√£o Paulo. She has served as a representative of Guatemala's indigenous peoples at various international events. Xon Riquiac was featured as one of fifty Guatemalan women \\"writing history\\" profiled in the book Entre Chapinas (2020).  Activism and research  Described as a \\"Mayan feminist,\\" X√≥n Riquiac researches contemporary Guatemalan culture from an intersectional, anti- capitalist, feminist point of view. Her 2004 thesis was titled \\"The Maya as a Political Identity in Indigenous Women,\\" and this has remained a key research interest. X√≥n Riquiac has stressed the importance of clothing to Mayan communities, particularly how traditional designs are both preserved and modernized; she posits that these garments provide a stable sense of identity, especially for women. X√≥n Riquiac wears huipil and corte (a traditional skirt). Her interest in contemporary textiles has also led her to become an art critic for contemporary art related to indigenous textiles and weaving, such as the work of Tz‚Äôutujil artist Antonio Pichill√°. She has also participated in art exhibitions. X√≥n Riquiac has written about the damage of \\"othering\\" and stereotyping in contemporary Guatemalan culture that persist despite the promises of respect for indigenous persons established in the Peace Accords of 1996; she argues that indigenous women suffer the most because they have limited educational and economic opportunities. Another of her research interests is the complex relationship between the state, dominant cultural groups and norms, and indigenous culture and beliefs. Reporting on a 2014 conflict in which a Tz‚Äôutijil/K‚Äôiche‚Äô community wanted to remove a Haredi Jewish community from San Juan la Laguna, X√≥n Riquiac argues that government actions and accusations of racism, antisemitism, and religious intolerance, failed to take into account the specific circumstances of this conflict, perpetuated racist, anti-indigenous stereotypes, and privileged the rights of the Haredi community over those of the indigenous community. Her historical report on the Lenca was submitted as evidence in the trial about the construction of the Agua Zarca dam, in which she also served as an expert witness. X√≥n Riquiac challenges perceived notions of empiricism in anthropology, which traditionally situated outsiders as more knowledgeable and scientific observers than members of the culture under observation. She also studies the academic field of indigenous studies itself.  Tourism  X√≥n Riquiac has established \\"El Proyecto Tux Cocina Gourmet de Origen,\\" an ethical tourism program, academic research project, and restaurant that promotes pre- Hispanic, pre-industrial Mayan food. In a 2020 interview, she said, \\"Our goal is to strengthen indigenous epistemology through [recognizing] the science of indigenous women [in food preparation] and both their oppression and resistance in domestic spaces.\\"Mar√≠a Jacinta X√≥n Riquiac, interview with Miguel A.

Biography  Gyrdymova was born on 1 June 1998 in Yekaterinburg. From childhood, Gyrdymova enjoyed writing poetry and published her work on the site Stihi.ru as a teenager. In 2014, she entered tenth grade at the Specialized Educational and Scientific Center of the Ural Federal University. In 2016, she enrolled in correspondence courses in film production at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography in Moscow. She chose the school because of her love of classic cinema. Since September 2016, Gyrdymova has continued her studies, and her first internship was at the ETV channel in her native Yekaterinburg, where she released joint projects with the poet Alexandra Aksyonova. She then worked for some time as a producer at ETV.  Musical career  VK Fest 2018 in Saint Petersburg Monetochka performing at A2 in Saint Petersburg At the end of 2015, Gyrdymova uploaded her first album, Psychedelic Cloud-Rap (), to the social network VKontakte under the pseudonym Monetochka. She recorded the songs at home on a synthesizer. Soon after, she began uploading videos of her live performances to YouTube. On 22 January 2016, she officially released Psychedelic Cloud Rap. The album was posted in one of the popular social network communities and quickly went viral. By the end of February, she had over 20,000 followers on her VKontakte page and received offers to give concerts and interviews. In January 2017, Monetochka released the video for the song \\"Ushla k realistu\\" (). On 1 June 2017 the video for the song \\"Childfree\\" (), recorded with Noize MC, was released. The song and video became the subject of a scandal. The Moscow lawyer Sergei Afanasyev wrote to the prosecutor's office to check \\"Childfree\\" for legal violations, claiming that the lyrics promoted teen suicide. In 2017, Monetochka began to collaborate with the alternative R&B; musician and producer Viktor \\"BTsKh\\" Isaev. Their first collaboration, the single \\"Poslednyaya diskoteka\\" (), was released on 31 October 2017. On 25 May 2018, Monetochka released her first studio album, Coloring for Adults (), produced by Isaev. According to the press release, Coloring for Adults marked a new sound for Monetochka, \\"containing musical references to the 1980s and 1990s, contemporary club music, music from cartoons, and even folklore.\\" The album contains multiple references to the late Soviet rock musician Viktor Tsoi, including a musical quote from the Kino song \\"Khochu peremen!\\" () and lyrics mentioning a \\"weary Tsoi\\". On 28 May 2018, Monetochka performed the song \\"Kazhdyi raz\\" () on the late-night talk show Evening Urgant. In his introduction, the host, Ivan Urgant, said that some critics considered Monetochka's new album \\"one of the major Russian-language albums of this year.\\" On 1 June 2018, a concert presentation of the new album took place in Moscow. On 2 October 2020, Monetochka released the studio album Arts and Crafts ().  Critical reception  In a review of Psychedelic Cloud Rap on the InterMedia website, the music critic Alexei Mazhaev wrote that \\"in Liza's music, stiob is combined with sanity on the verge of cynicism\\", and \\"excellent command of words, a sense of language and accurate orientation in the signs of the times are seasoned with charming naivety.\\" According to music journalist Alexander Gorbachev (Meduza), despite the fact that Monetochka started off as an Internet meme, she did not share the formulaic path of short-lived celebrity. Comparing the singer's songs from Psychedelic Cloud Rap to the new songs of Coloring for Adults, Gorbachev notes that \\"the toylike childishness of Monetochka‚Äôs early music has grown into something far more complex in this album.\\" The poet Vera Polozkova spoke about Monetochka's success in the following way: ‚ÄúThis is absolutely a child telling you about what is happening around you, with such irreconcilability which you would never have dared to use yourself.\\" Maria Engstr√∂m claims that \\"Monetochka‚Äôs album [Coloring for Adults] today is the only intelligible manifesto of the aesthetics of Putin‚Äôs fourth term in office.\\" The singer Zemfira called Monetochka's lyrics \\"excellent\\", but said she considered the singer's voice \\"repulsive\\". Boris Barabanov named \\"Kazhdyi raz\\" one of the 16 top songs of 2018 and wrote that by releasing Coloring for Adults, Monetochka \\"managed to break the framework of the independent scene and break into the mainstream.\\"  Charts  In December 2016, Monetochka's track \\"Gosha Rubchinskiy\\" () was ranked 11th in The Flow's \\"50 Best Tracks of 2016.\\" In January 2017, Psychedelic Cloud Rap was ranked 6th in The Flow's \\"33 Best Russian Albums of 2016\\".

It used to rule over Buton island and parts of Southeast Sulawesi province. It was a constitutional monarchy with its own written constitution and law, complete with bodies acting as a legislature, a system of judiciary, and executive power.  Early History  The islands that comprised the sultanate's territory were called \\"Liwuto Pataanguna\\", meaning Four Islands. People from the Buton Islands were called \\"tukang besi\\", literally meaning blacksmith.http://www.geocities.ws/konferensinasionalsejarah/ali_hadara_dinamika_sejarah_pelayaran_tradisional_orang_buton_kepulauan_tukang_besi.pdf There are several versions of how people there were named this way, one from an oral story of a Dutch man who arrived on the islands and was surprised to find almost everyone using iron tools, hence he named it Toekang Besi Eilanden. Another version suggests that it was from another kingdom within the region named the kingdom of Tukabessi. The Islands of Buton were mentioned in Nagarakretagama and palapa oath, suggesting that the islands were once under the influence of Majapahit. The kingdom was established around the 1300s by a queen named Waa Kaa Kaa. Most of the time before the kingdom converted to Islam, the rulers were female. The first king that converted to Islam was King Murhun, later renamed Sultan Murhum Kaimuddin Khalifatul after his conversion. The Kingdom of Buton officially converted to Islam under his reign with help of a scholar from Johor Sultanate.  Constitutional Monarchy  Unlike other kingdoms and sultanates in the region, the Sultanate of Buton was a constitutional monarchy. The constitution was written and named Murtabat Tujuh. This constitution was formalized by Sultan LaElangi (1597-1631) and did not change much until sultanate was abolished.  Legacy  During the 16th century, the city of Baubau had heavy fortifications which today is the Buton Palace Fortress, a popular tourist attraction in the region.

His courtesy title was Saemon-no-j≈ç. Biography Sakai Tadazumi was the fifth son of Sakai Tadaaki, the 5th daimy≈ç of Sh≈çnai. When his elder brother, the 10th daimy≈ç of Sh≈çnai Sakai Tadatomo died with heir, he was named successor posthumously in 1862 and his position was officially confirmed by the shogunate in 1863. A couple of months later, he was appointed the commander of the Shinch≈çgumi and elite paramilitary force of R≈çshigumi who were created to provide extra security for the city of Edo. In 1864, Tagawa and Yuri districts in Dewa Province were added to his domains, raising his kokudaka by 27,000 koku to 170,000 koku. However, in 1867 growing dissatisfaction over high taxation and a severe crop failure led to widespread rioting and unrest in Sh≈çnai Domain. Tadazumi remained in Edo, largely leaving affairs of the domain to his kar≈ç and other retainers. He led the Shinch≈çgumi in an arson attack which burned the Edo residence of Satsuma Domain at the end of 1866. In 1868, during the Boshin War, Sh≈çnai Domain became a key member of the pro-Tokugawa ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei. In the early stages of the conflict, Sh≈çnai forces won several key military engagements against Akita Domain and Shinj≈ç Domain; however, towards the end of the year it became clear to Tadazumi that the pro- Tokugawa cause was ultimately doomed. Although the domain had not suffered any military defeat, he surrendered to the Meiji government at the end of the year. Accused by the new government of treason, Tadazumi was forced into retirement in favor of his adopted son, and the domain was reduced to 120,000 koku. In 1869 he was pardoned, and in 1870 was sent to Satsuma for military training, returning to a post in the Ministry of the Army in 1871. In 1872, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army and was sent to Germany for training in April of that year. He returned to Japan in June 1879. In 1880, Sakai Masamichi retired, and Tadazumi resumed the position of chieftain of the Tsuruoka Sakai clan. He returned to Tsuruoka in 1881. In 1884, he became a Count (hakushaku) in the new kazoku peerage.  References  Papinot, Edmond. (1906) Dictionnaire d'histoire et de g√©ographie du japon.

Demographics Bunjwah is an economically underdeveloped area consisting of 2,798 households and a total population of 15,899‚Äî8,205 males and 7,694 females. Location Bunjwah is located from its district headquarters, Kishtwar. It borders Saroor, Nagseni Padhyarna, the Padder of Kishtwar district, Chilly, Bhalessa, Bhatyas, and Challer of Doda district, while one of its boundaries runs along Himachal Pradesh's road towards Chamba located in Bunjwah tehsil. Route The route to Bunjwah from its nearest airport in Jammu goes through Batote via the National Highway 144, the Chenani-Nashri Tunnel, and the National Highway 244. This Batote‚ÄîKishtwar road leads to Thathri, which is away from Kishtwar. To reach Bunjwah, it is necessary to leave the National Highway by a link road towards Thathri-Donadi where a route forks off to Bunjwah.  Economy  The region remains neglected by the state government and the district administration. The ‚ÄúBunjwah‚Äù area further suffers from underdevelopment and the effects of being denied basic rights and status in the Indian constitution. Most families lack the basic skills and training necessary to advance their agricultural development. Demand for sub division status As of 2020, demand for separate Bunjwah sub division status increased with the arguments of negligence by the present district administration.  Education  While over 50 primary schools were built in the district, there is only one secondary school in the region, and the education is not affordable for many residents.

His first exhibit at the Salon came in 1869, with a series of genre scenes and portraits. By the 1880s, he had abandoned those subjects and was devoting himself entirely to landscapes.

While working there, he became a close friend of Fran√ßois Nardi, another French artist of Italian ancestry, who encouraged him to use the original form of his family name. He benefitted from several major government purchases, in 1880, 1891 and 1913.

Education and legal career Lee earned a bachelor's and master's degree in law at National Taiwan University. He practiced law as a lawyer, district attorney and judge. Political career Lee was first elected to the Legislative Yuan in December 1989 as a supplemental legislator from Kaohsiung. Shortly after taking office, he joined 25 others in signing the instrument of appeal for Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 261, which ruled on the extended tenure of the First Legislative Yuan, a legislative body first elected in 1948, when the government of the Republic of China still maintained control over mainland China. Following an October 1992 demonstration led by the Action Alliance for One Taiwan, One China, it was noted by Taiwan Communiqu√© that Lee Ching-hsiung and fellow Democratic Progressive Party legislators Hung Chi-chang, Lu Hsiu- yi, Tai Chen-yao, and Tien Tsai-ting questioned premier Hau Pei-tsun about the One China, One Taiwan concept and discussed a purported rift between Hau and president Lee Teng-hui. Lee was ranked ninth on a list of ten outstanding legislators compiled by the Taipei Society in December 1992, shortly before all members of the First Legislative Yuan were to leave office. In his reelection bid that same month, Lee was again nominated by the Democratic Progressive Party. He received the most votes of any candidate in his district, Kaohsiung North. During the 1995 election cycle, Lee was voted out of office. Lee returned to the Legislative Yuan in 1996 by winning his old seat, this time on behalf of the Taiwan Independence Party. In his time on the Fourth Legislative Yuan, Lee was a member of the legislative defense committee. In a legislative capacity, Lee visited defense minister Tang Fei to discuss Tang's willingness to remain on the Executive Yuan after president Chen Shui-bian took office, questioned Tang Yao-ming about the military equipment budget, and jointly proposed revisions to the Criminal Prosecution Law alongside Chiu Tai-san and . During a session of the Legislative Yuan that began in September 2000, Lee contested an internal election to lead its judiciary committee. After leaving the Legislative Yuan, Lee accepted a nomination from the Chen Shui-bian presidential administration to serve on the Examination Yuan. A legislative confirmation hearing was held in June 2002, and Lee was installed within the Examination Yuan as a minister without portfolio in September 2002. While a member of the Examination Yuan, Lee commented on pensions and interest rates for public sector employees, and advocated for the grading system used to evaluate public servants to become stricter. Political stances and commentary Lee advocated for a balance of power between government branches and cautioned against abuses of power, such as legislative immunity. He has also discussed balances of power within the judiciary. Lee was supportive of amendments to the discussed in 2001 to limit the role of judges and give more powers to prosecutors. However, he opposed a legislative resolution that required prosecutors general to attend legislative interpellation session, because individual lawmakers could influence the judiciary if legislative questioning turned to specific cases. A number of editorials written by Lee have been published in the Taipei Times. His columns have included electoral analysis of the 2000 presidential election as well as the 2001 local and legislative elections and its resulting minority government. His editorials have also addressed national security, cross-strait relations, and electoral reform.

Early life and education Bradshaw was born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee. During her childhood, her family was active in raising awareness of pollution leaking from the Memphis Defense Depot, a contaminated military base in a largely African American neighborhood of Memphis that became a Superfund site in 1992. Her parents organized a \\"concerned citizen committee\\" regarding the site because residents believed it was causing local health problems. In addition to her activist parents, Bradshaw was influenced by her uncle John DeBerry, who was for many years a Democratic member of the Tennessee House of Representatives. Bradshaw earned a Bachelor of Liberal Studies in journalism and communication studies from the University of Memphis.  Career  She is the environmental justice chair of the Sierra Club's Tennessee chapter. According to the Chattanooga Times Free Press, \\"She has worked with community advocacy groups, environmental organizations and unions, including the Mid-South Peace and Justice Center, the AFL‚ÄìCIO, the Sierra Club and Tennesseans for Fair Taxation.\\" 2020 U.S. Senate election In 2020, Tennessee will elect a replacement for U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican who has announced his intention to retire. Bradshaw announced her candidacy for in the Democratic primary in October, 2019, telling the Nashville Scene, \\"What's going on in the Senate is that socially and economically, they don't represent what the constituents of Tennessee look like. The majority of Senate members are millionaires, and I'm a working-class single mother. There are other working-class people across Tennessee, and sometimes when those policies come down, they have unintended consequences that hurt working people.\\" Bradshaw told the Tri-State Defender that \\"we are leading with environmental justice principles.\\" She told other reporters (WPLN News) \\"People of color, Black people, brown people, indigenous people and poor white people are not experiencing the same set of laws as everybody else when it comes to the environment. In addition to environmental issues, her platform endorses Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. She also supports universal background checks for gun purchases, keeping the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals in force, and overturning Citizens United v. FEC. In the Democratic primary, Bradshaw was one of five candidates, including DSCC-supported Army-veteran James Mackler. Mackler's campaign had raised $2.1 million, while Bradshaw's funding as of March was less than $10,000. By the end of the primary campaign, Bradshaw had raised $24,000. The general expectation was that Mackler would easily win against a divided field with four other candidates. On August 6, Bradshaw won, with 35.5% of the votes, while Mackler came third with 23.8%. Bradshaw's decisive primary win was unexpected: according to the Associated Press \\"an astonishing upset victory over the Democratic establishment‚Äôs choice\\" that \\"has drawn national attention.\\" Bradshaw's win was the first successful challenge to any DSCC- backed candidate since 2010. Prior to Bradshaw's win of the 2020 primary for U.S. Senate, neither Tennessee Democrats nor Tennessee Republicans had ever chosen a Black woman as their candidate for statewide office. She will face Republican nominee Bill Hagerty in the November 3, 2020 general election. Republicans hold both of Tennessee's Senate seats, as they have since 1994. Bradshaw has pledged to visit every one of Tennessee's 95 counties to campaign for the general election. In the weeks since the primary, Bradshaw has raised an additional $270,000.

She was briefly the president of the Republic of Crato, which was set up in revolt against the Brazilian government. Within 8 days she was captured and tortured by the monarchy, making her the first political prisoner in the history of Brazil. Biography De Alencar was born on February 11, 1760 in Exu, Pernambuco, then a rural part of Pernambuco, and as a teenager she moved to Crato (then a village) in Cear√°. There she married the Portuguese trader Jos√© Gon√ßalves do Santos, and the two established properties where they profited from the work of enslaved people. De Alencar was an important figure during the Pernambucan revolt, based in Crato. She was the head of the provisional government that was established by the revolutionaries, serving as the president of the Republic of Crato for 8 days. However, she was quickly captured, and was held and tortured in the fortress Fortaleza de Nossa Senhora da Assun√ß√£o. This made her the first political prisoner in the history of Brazil. De Alencar survived the 70-day Pernambucan revolt and her capture by the authorities, but she was repeatedly forced to flee from political persecution, until she died in 1832 in Fronteiras, Piau√≠.

It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades. This remote mountain is situated north- northeast of Mazama, on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. Big Craggy has two subsidiary peaks, North Peak (8,205-ft), and West Craggy (8,366-ft), the latter set on the Pasayten Wilderness boundary. The nearest higher peak is Monument Peak, to the west-northwest. Big Craggy Peak ranks 61st on Washington's highest 100 peaks, and 62nd on the \\"Bulger List\\". Precipitation runoff from Big Craggy drains into Eightmile Creek which is a tributary of the Chewuch River. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Due to the history of San Marino and its cultural ties to Italy, San Marino has a similar rank structure to that of Italian Armed Forces. The rank insignia worn vary depending on whether the alta uniforme (high uniform), uniforme di ordinanza (ordinance uniform), or uniforme da campo (field uniform) is worn. The alta uniforme distinguishes rank by a series of chevrons and knots on the lower sleeves. The uniforme di ordinanza distinguishes ranks using inverted chevrons on the epaulets of enlisted ranks, and using a series of Tre Penne and towers with battlements for officers. Officers in the uniforme di ordinanza also have a separate set of rank insignia displayed on their lower sleeves, made up of a series of bars and either one, two or three towers for junior, senior, and general officers respectively. General officers also have Greca in their rank insignia similar to their Italian counterparts. The uniforme da campo displays the same insignia as the epaulets of the uniforme di ordinanza worn on either rank slides or patches. Officers Officers of all Corps follow the same rank titles, with differences in the colors of the rank insignia worn dependent on the Corps. { style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\\" - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" rowspan=1(Sleeve insignia)  colspan=4 No equivalent  colspan=2 50px  colspan=2 No equivalent  colspan=2 50px  colspan=2 50px  colspan=2 50px  colspan=2 50px  colspan=2 50px  colspan=3 50px  colspan=3 50px  colspan=12 Unknown -  rowspan=1(Parade Sleeve insignia)  colspan=10No equivalent  colspan=2colspan=2colspan=2colspan=2 50px  colspan=3 50px  colspan=3 50px  colspan=12 Unknown -  rowspan=1(Sleeve insignia)  colspan=8No equivalent  colspan=2 50px  colspan=2 50px  colspan=2 50px  colspan=2 50px  colspan=2 50px  colspan=3 50px  colspan=3 50px  colspan=12 Unknown -  rowspan=1(Parade Sleeve insignia)  colspan=8No equivalent  colspan=2colspan=2colspan=2colspan=2colspan=2 50px  colspan=3 50px  colspan=3 50px  colspan=12 Unknown -  rowspan=1(Parade Sleeve insignia)  colspan=18 No equivalent  colspan=1 50px  colspan=2 50px  colspan=3 50px  colspan=12 Unknown } Enlisted The enlisted ranks follow a standard format of a OR-1, OR-3, OR-5, and OR-6, with OR-2 being present in most but not all of the corps and OR-9 only being present in the corps that are involved in policing duties. { style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font- size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\\" -   rowspan=1(Parade Sleeve insignia)  colspan=6 style=\\"vertical-align: middle\\"  N/A  colspan=4 No equivalent  colspan=6 50px  colspan=6 50px  colspan=4 No equivalent  colspan=2 50px  colspan=6 50px  colspan=2 50px -  rowspan=1(Sleeve insignia)  colspan=6 style=\\"vertical-align: middle\\"  N/A  colspan=4 No equivalent  colspan=6 50px  colspan=6 50px  colspan=4 No equivalent  colspan=2 50px  colspan=6 50px  colspan=2 50px -  rowspan=1(Parade Sleeve insignia)  colspan=6 style=\\"vertical-align: middle\\"  N/A  colspan=4 No equivalent  colspan=6 50px  colspan=6 50px  colspan=4 No equivalent  colspan=2 50px  colspan=6 50px  colspan=2 50px -  rowspan=1(Parade Sleeve insignia)  colspan=10 No equivalent  colspan=6 50px  colspan=6 50px  colspan=4 No equivalent  colspan=2 50px  colspan=6 50px  colspan=2 50px } References San Marino ","title":"Military ranks of San Marino"},{"id":"64776079","text":"California Water Service Group is an American public utility company providing drinking water and wastewater services.

Playing career  Elimimian played cornerback at Hawaii from 2000 to 2004. He received offers from bigger schools such as Oregon State and Washington State but suffered a severe knee injury his senior year of high school, and the two schools withdrew. He received the final scholarship Hawaii had in 2000 highly due to the fact that his high school football coach was a former Hawaii standout and had contacted then-associate head coach George Lumpkin. In his senior season, Elimimian earned first team all-WAC honors, one of eight Hawaii players to do so.  Professional career  After college, Elimimian went undrafted in the 2005 NFL Draft and signed with the San Diego Chargers in 2005. He also spent one offseason with the Chicago Bears in 2006 before spending the regular season with the Amsterdam Admirals in 2006. He was then selected by Admirals again in the 13th round of the draft in 2007 and spent the season with them.  Coaching career  After his playing career ended, Elimimian worked as the defensive coordinator at his alma mater Crenshaw High School from 2007 to 2009. Elimimian got his first college coaching job in 2010 when he was hired as a graduate assistant on his old college coach June Jones' staff. He then moved over to accept a graduate assistant position at Washington State in 2012, working specifically with the defensive backs. Elimimian was named the defensive coordinator and linebackers coach at Simon Fraser in 2014, working under Jacques Chapdelaine. He also interviewed for the vacant head coaching job in 2014 after Chapdelaine resigned after one season to pursue other opportunities.  Hawaii  Elimimian was hired as the secondary coach at his alma mater Hawaii in 2015. He served as the defensive play-caller for the team's match-up against Louisiana‚ÄìMonroe after defensive coordinator Tom Mason was reassigned to an administrative role. He was retained by newly hired head coach and former Warrior teammate Nick Rolovich in 2016, and changed from secondary coach to coaching exclusively cornerbacks in 2018 following the hire of Corey Batoon. Following Rolovich's departure from Hawaii in 2020, Elimimian was retained by new head coach Todd Graham and was also given the title of recruiting coordinator.  Personal life  Born in Calabar, Nigeria and raised in Los Angeles, Elimimian is the son of a retired professor. His brother Solomon is a linebacker who also played at Hawaii and currently plays for the Saskatchewan Roughriders and was first pure defensive player to win the CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award and the first player to win three different CFL awards.

It serves Vernazza, which is one of the five towns of the Cinque Terre. History The station was inaugurated on 24 October 1874, at the same time as the ‚Äì line. Freight operations commenced on 15 September 1913 with the opening of a short siding on the mountain side. A double-track line was opened between and on 15 January 1962, including a new station at Vernazza,Service order no 11 of 1962 which was located to the east of the old station between the Riolo and Vernazza tunnels. Due to the lack of available space, the new infrastructure was built partly in the open air on the site of the goods siding on the mountain side of the line and partly in enlarged sections of both the pre-existing Riolo tunnel and the new Monterosso‚ÄìRuvano tunnel. The new arrangement made it possible to build a passenger building and a small freight yard, which was of great importance given the lack of road links that characterise the town. In June and July 2011, the station was also served by the Treni del Mare (\\"trains of the sea\\") managed by the private company Arenaways, which became bankrupt shortly afterwards. A devastating flood buried part of the town of Vernazza on 25 October 2011. The presence of the station, once freed from mud and debris, contributed significantly to the logistics of the rescue teams which were able to begin the long work of restoring the town from it.

Based in Sydney, she started her own art school. Perry actively exhibited her paintings and prints from 1925 to 1955 and is partly credited with introducing and promoting the new relief print technique using linoleum in the 1920s.  Biography  Perry (1891‚Äì1973) was born in Beechworth, Victoria. Her parents were Richard Hall Perry, solicitor, and Eliza Elizabeth (n√©e Reardon). After her father's death in 1896, her mother remarried and the family moved to New Zealand. Perry returned to Melbourne in 1914 to attend the National Gallery of Victoria Art School where she was a student of Bernard Hall and Frederick McCubbin. In 1921, Perry was awarded the National Gallery of Victoria Travelling Scholarship and spent four years in London at the Royal Academy. In London she met and was influenced by Charles Sims, Gerald Kelly and Ernest Jackson who she credited with teaching her \\"all she knew about art\\". She also exhibited in Paris at the Salon des Artistes Francais, returning to Australia in 1925. Perry started using the recently invented linoleum to create relief prints in the mid-1920s. Wooden blocks were not easy to cut and required a printing press. She was enthusiastic about the medium and used it in her work and taught classes. She was attracted by the distinctive black lines and simplified forms which appealed to her interest in modernism. She used the method in her many depictions of the coastal environment and the harbour. Along with Thea Proctor and Margaret Preston, she can be credited with promoting linocuts. As early as 1930, Perry was commended as a 'clever artist' by The Bulletin magazine for her portraits of poet Mary Gilmore and art critic and co-owner of the Macquarie Galleries Basil Burdett, which she had submitted to the annual Society of Artists exhibition. It was noted she was on the staff of the Julian Ashton Art School and was a member of the Society of Artists. In the early 1930s, Perry established the Adelaide Perry School of Drawing and Painting at 12 Bridge Street, Sydney. She was teaching part-time at the Presbyterian Ladies College, Croydon after being recommended by Roy de Maitre and was exhibiting at the Macquarie Galleries. In 1934 Perry exhibited \\"portraits of quality\\" alongside leading women artists of the decade in an exhibition of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters. In 1936 Perry acquired the lease to a penthouse in Lower Pitt Street, Sydney and stylishly converted the space into a teaching studio as well as her own accommodation. Perry was a founding member of the Australian Academy of Art in 1937 and in 1940 at their Third Annual Exhibition, her portrait of \\"Diana\\" was appreciated by the artist and sometime art critic Arthur Murch as having a \\"subtle quality\\". He also commented on the changing face of Australian art mentioning young artists who had returned from overseas such as Jean Bellette, as well as established artists in Australia such as W A Dargie, Margaret Preston, Eric Wilson, and Roy de Maistre. In the war years, Perry found opportunities to exhibit with a wide range of artists with established reputations at the Macquarie Galleries including Julian Ashton, Donald Friend, William Dobell, Roland Wakelin, Lloyd Rees, Thea Proctor, and Arthur Fleischmann. In 1944, Perry she showed her drawings at the Macquarie Galleries alongside Thea Proctor, Daryl Lindsay, Arthur Murch, James Cook and Douglas Dundas. After the war, Perry started teaching art full-time at Presbyterian Ladies College, and stayed there until she retired in 1962. Perry continued to participate in the conservative Society of Artists annual exhibitions. In 1954, Elizabeth Young, a writer for the Adelaide Advertiser, made the observation that there was an \\"unusually comprehensive cross-section of art\\" and that \\"young artists\\" were exhibiting \\"boisterous canvases\\" influenced by expressionist and abstract painters of the European School. However, there were more established artists such as Arthur Murch, Lloyd Rees, Margaret Preston, Roy Wakelin and Perry who \\"had come up with quiet, sober and considered work that still had punch in it\\". In 1955 she again exhibited with the Society of Artists with John Passmore, Nora Heyson, and Lloyd Rees. From this time there is little evidence that Perry created much in the way of new work. However, she had made her mark as a printmaker and painter, and in future years her work would be included in a few important survey exhibitions. In 1984, Perry's oil paintings were included in the exhibition Private Collection:The Post-Impressionist Mood in Australian Painting held at the Nolan Gallery, Lanyon, ACT. In 1986, Perry's linocuts were included in the exhibition Australian Printmakers: 1773‚Äì1986 at the National Gallery of Australia. In a 1995 art review of the \\"extensive\\" and \\"comprehensive\\" exhibition of the works by Adelaide Perry and her students, Overlooked But Not Forgotten, at the Drill Hall Gallery at the Australian National University, Sasha Grishin, of the Canberra Times stated that although Perry had never been \\"a major figure in the Australian art scene\\", it is possible Perry's career may have been affected by the Depression and held back by the need to have an income. Grishin does identify her early work, the simple relief prints, \\"as using the medium to its full potential\\" and they compared favourably to her contemporaries such as Margaret Preston, Thea Proctor, Ethel Spowers and Vera Blackburn, the latter whom she taught at her Sydney art school. Grishin sums up Perry as having had \\"a significant impact on the Sydney art scene\\".  Recognition  1995: The retrospective exhibition Overlooked But Not Forgotten, works by Adelaide Perry and her students, was held at the Drill Hall Gallery, Australian National University. 2001: Adelaide Perry Gallery established by Presbyterian Ladies College, Croydon, NSW to \\"broaden students‚Äô experience and knowledge of art, design and curatorial practice\\". 2006: Adelaide Perry Drawing Prize was established.

This is the fourth annual survey to report enrollment above 96%. India has maintained an average enrolment ratio of 95% for students in this age group from year 2007 to 2014. As an outcome the number of students in the age group 6-14 who are not enrolled in school has come down to 2.8% in the year academic year 2018 (ASER 2018). Another report from 2013 stated that there were 229 million students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural schools of India, from Class I to XII, representing an increase of 23 lakh students over 2002 total enrolment, and a 19% increase in girl's enrolment.Enrollment in schools rises 14% to 23 crore The Times of India (22 January 2013) While quantitatively India is inching closer to universal education, the quality of its education has been questioned particularly in its government run school system.While more than 95 percent of children attend primary school, just 40 percent of Indian adolescents attend secondary school (Grades 9-12). Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $2 billion to education in India. Some of the reasons for the poor quality include absence of around 25% of teachers every day.Sharath Jeevan & James Townsend, Teachers: A Solution to Education Reform in India Stanford Social Innovation Review (17 July 2013) States of India have introduced tests and education assessment system to identify and improve such schools.B.P. Khandelwal, Examinations and test systems at school level in India UNESCO, pages 100-114 School children reading books in government primary school library, in Goa The primary education in India is divided into two parts, namely Lower Primary (Class I-IV) and Upper Primary (Middle school, Class V-VIII). The Indian government lays emphasis on primary education ( Class I-VIII ) also referred to as elementary education, to children aged 6 to 14 years old.Blackwell, 93‚Äì94 Because education laws are given by the states, duration of primary school visit alters between the Indian states. The Indian government has also banned child labour in order to ensure that the children do not enter unsafe working conditions. However, both free education and the ban on child labour are difficult to enforce due to economic disparity and social conditions. 80% of all recognised schools at the elementary stage are government run or supported, making it the largest provider of education in the country. However, due to a shortage of resources and lack of political will, this system suffers from massive gaps including high pupil to teacher ratios, shortage of infrastructure and poor levels of teacher training. Figures released by the Indian government in 2011 show that there were 5,816,673 elementary school teachers in India. there were 2,127,000 secondary school teachers in India. Education has also been made free for children for 6 to 14 years of age or up to class VIII under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009. The National Sample Survey Organisation and the National Family Health Survey collected data in India on the percentage of children completing primary school which are reported to be only 36.8% and 37.7% respectively. On 21 February 2005, the Prime Minister of India said that he was pained to note that \\"only 47 out of 100 children enrolled in class I reach class VIII, putting the dropout rate at 52.78 percent.\\" It is estimated that at least 35 million, and possibly as many as 60 million, children aged 6‚Äì14 years are not in school. Nutrition The World Bank estimates that India is one of the highest ranking countries in the world for the number of children suffering from malnutrition. The prevalence of underweight children in India is among the highest in the world, and is nearly double that of Sub Saharan Africa with dire consequences for mobility, mortality, productivity and economic growth. On the Global Hunger Index India is on place 67 among the 80 nations having the worst hunger situation which is worse than nations such as North Korea or Sudan. 25% of all hungry people worldwide live in India. Since 1990 there has been some improvements for children but the proportion of hungry in the population has increased. In India 44% of children under the age of 5 are underweight. 72% of infants and 52% of married women have anaemia. Research has conclusively shown that malnutrition during pregnancy causes the child to have increased risk of future diseases, physical retardation, and reduced cognitive abilities.Superpower? 230 million Indians go hungry daily, Subodh Varma, 15 Jan 2012, The Times of India, Socio-economic status When it comes to child malnutrition, children in low-income families are more malnourished than those in high-income families.PDS system in India which account for distribution of wheat and rice only,by which the proteins are insufficient by these cereals which leads to malnutrition also. Some cultural beliefs that may lead to malnutrition is religion. Among these is the influence of religions, especially in India are restricted from consuming meat. Also, other Indians are strictly vegan, which means, they do not consume any sort of animal product, including dairy and eggs. This is a serious problem when inadequate protein is consumed because 56% of poor Indian household consume cereal to consume protein. It is observed that the type of protein that cereal contains does not parallel to the proteins that animal product contain (Gulati, 2012).Gulati, A., Ganesh-Kumar, A., Shreedhar, G., & Nandakumar, T. (2012). Agriculture and malnutrition in India. Food And Nutrition Bulletin, 33(1), 74‚Äì86 This phenomenon is most prevalent in the rural areas of India where more malnutrition exists on an absolute level. Whether children are of the appropriate weight and height is highly dependent on the socio-economic status of the population. Children of families with lower socio-economic standing are faced with sub-optimal growth. While children in similar communities have shown to share similar levels of nutrition, child nutrition is also differential from family to family depending on the mother's characteristic, household ethnicity and place of residence. It is expected that with improvements in socio-economic welfare, child nutrition will also improve. The rates of malnutrition are exceptionally high among adolescent girls and pregnant and lactating women in India, with repercussions for children's health. Midday Meal Nutrition Scheme The Midday Meal Scheme is a school meal programme of the Government of India designed to improve the nutritional status of school-age children nationwide, by supplying free lunches on working days for children in primary and upper primary classes in government, government aided, local body, Education Guarantee Scheme, and alternative innovative education centres, Madarsa and Maqtabs supported under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, and National Child Labour Project schools run by the ministry of labour. Serving 120,000,000 children in over 1,265,000 schools and Education Guarantee Scheme centres, it is the largest such programme in the world. Child labour Child labour in India In 2011 the national census of India found the total number of child labourers, aged 5‚Äì14, to be at 10.1 million, out of the total of 259.64 million children in that age group.Age Data C13 Table (India/States/UTs ), Final Population - 2011 Census of India The child labour problem is not unique to India; worldwide, about 217 million children work, many full-time. As per the Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986, amended in 2016 (\\"CLPR Act\\"), a \\"Child\\" is defined as any person below the age of 14, and the CLPR Act prohibits employment of a Child in any employment including as a domestic help. It is a cognizable criminal offence to employ a Child for any work. Children between age of 14 and 18 are defined as \\"Adolescent\\" and the law allows Adolescent to be employed except in the listed hazardous occupation and processes which include mining, inflammable substance and explosives related work and any other hazardous process as per the Factories Act, 1948. In 2001, an estimated 1% of all child workers, or about 120,000 children in India were in a hazardous job. Notably, the Constitution of India prohibits child labour in hazardous industries (but not in non-hazardous industries) as a Fundamental Right under Article 24. UNICEF estimates that India with its larger population, has the highest number of labourers in the world under 14 years of age, while sub-Saharan African countries have the highest percentage of children who are deployed as child labourers. The International Labour Organization estimates that agriculture, at 60 percent, is the largest employer of child labour in the world, while the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates 70% of child labour is deployed in agriculture and related activities. Outside of agriculture, child labour is observed in almost all informal sectors of the Indian economy. Companies including Gap, Primark, Monsanto have been criticised for child labour in their products. The companies claim they have strict policies against selling products made by underage children for their own profit, but there are many links in a supply chain making it difficult to oversee them all. In 2011, after three years of Primark's effort, BBC acknowledged that its award-winning investigative journalism report of Indian child labour use by Primark was a fake. The BBC apologised to Primark, to Indian suppliers and all its viewers. Another company that has come under much scrutiny was Nike. Nike was under pressure to speak up about alleged sweatshops that harbored children that the company was exploiting to make their sneakers. Since then Nike has come out with a separate web page that specifically points out where they get their products from and where their products are manufactured. In December 2014, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor and India figured among 74 countries where a significant incidence of critical working conditions has been observed. Unlike any other country, 23 goods were attributed to India, the majority of which are produced by child labour in the manufacturing sector. In addition to the constitutional prohibition of hazardous child labour, various laws in India, such as the Juvenile Justice (care and protection) of Children Act-2000, and the Child Labour (Prohibition and Abolition) Act-1986 provide a basis in law to identify, prosecute and stop child labour in India. Street children A street child in New Delhi. India has an estimated one hundred thousand or more street children in each of the following cities: New Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai. Mainly because of family conflict, they come to live on the streets and take on the full responsibilities of caring for themselves, including working to provide for and protecting themselves. Though street children do sometimes band together for greater security, they are often exploited by employers and the police. Their many vulnerabilities require specific legislation and attention from the government and other organisations to improve their condition. Child marriage Child Marriage India by SDRC Child marriage in India, according to the Indian law, is a marriage where either the woman is below the age of 18 or the man is below the age of 21. Most child marriages involve underage women, many of whom are in poor socio-economic conditions. Child marriages are prevalent in India. Estimates vary widely between sources as to the extent and scale of child marriages. The International Center for Research on Women-UNICEF publications have estimated India's child marriage rate to be 47% from a sample surveys of 1998, while the United Nations reports it to be 30% in 2005. The Census of India has counted and reported married women by age, with proportion of females in child marriage falling in each 10 year census period since 1981. In its 2001 census report, India stated zero married girls below the age of 10, 1.4 million married girls out of 59.2 million girls aged 10‚Äì14, and 11.3 million married girls out of 46.3 million girls aged 15‚Äì19..Table C-2 Marital Status by Age and Sex Subtable C0402, India Total Females Married by Age Group, 2001 Census of India, Government of India (2009) Times of India reported that 'since 2001, child marriage rates in India have fallen by 46% between 2005 and 2009.K. Sinha Nearly 50% fall in brides married below 18 The Times of India (February 10, 2012)Jharkhand is the state with highest child marriage rates in India (14.1%), while Kerala is the only state where child marriage rates have increased in recent years.R Gopakumar, Child marriages high in Kerala Deccan Herald (June 19, 2013) Jammu and Kashmir was reported to be the only state with lowest child marriage cases at 0.4% in 2009. Rural rates of child marriages were three times higher than urban India rates in 2009. Child marriage was outlawed in 1929, under Indian law. However, in the British colonial times, the legal minimum age of marriage was set at 14 for girls and 18 for boys. Under protests from Muslim organizations in the undivided British India, a personal law Shariat Act was passed in 1937 that allowed child marriages with consent from girl's guardian.Hilary Amster, Child marriage in India University of San Francisco (2009) After independence and adoption of Indian constitution in 1950, the child marriage act has undergone several revisions. The minimum legal age for marriage, since 1978, has been 18 for women and 21 for men. The child marriage prevention laws have been challenged in Indian courts, with some Muslim Indian organizations seeking no minimum age and that the age matter be left to their personal law.M.G. Radhakrishnan and J. Binduraj, In a league of their own India Today (July 5, 2013)Muzaffar Ali Sajjad And Ors. vs State Of Andhra Pradesh on 9 November, 2001 Andhra Pradesh High Court, India Child marriage is an active political subject as well as a subject of continuing cases under review in the highest courts of India. Several states of India have introduced incentives to delay marriages. For example, the state of Haryana introduced the so-called Apni Beti, Apna Dhan program in 1994, which translates to \\"My daughter, My wealth\\". It is a conditional cash transfer program dedicated to delaying young marriages by providing a government paid bond in her name, payable to her parents, in the amount of , after her 18th birthday if she is not married. Child marriage has been traditionally prevalent in India but is not so continued in Modern India to this day. Historically, child brides would live with their parents until they reached puberty. In the past, child widows were condemned to a life of great agony, shaved heads, living in isolation, and being shunned by society. Although child marriage was outlawed in 1860, it is still a common practice. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929 is the relevant legislation in the country. According to UNICEF's \\"State of the World‚Äôs Children-2009\\" report, 47% of India's women aged 20‚Äì24 were married before the legal age of 18, rising to 56% in rural areas. The report also showed that 40% of the world's child marriages occur in India. Sexual abuse=Laws Child sexual abuse laws in India have been enacted as part of the child protection policies of India. The Parliament of India passed the 'Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences Bill, 2011' regarding child sexual abuse on 22 May 2012 into an ActThe Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 Kerala Medico- legal Society website. The rules formulated by the government in accordance with the law have also been notified on the November 2012 and the law has become ready for implementation.Law for Protecting Children from Sexual Offences There have been many calls for more stringent laws. Child trafficking India has one of the largest population of children in the world - Census data from 2011 shows that India has a population of 472 million children below the age of eighteen. Protection of children by the state is guaranteed to Indian citizens by an expansive reading of Article 21 of the Indian constitution, and also mandated given India's status as signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. India has a very high volume of child trafficking. As many as one child disappears every eight minutes, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. In some cases, children are taken from their homes to be bought and sold in the market. In other cases, children are tricked into the hands of traffickers by being presented an opportunity for a job, when in reality, upon arrival they become enslaved. In India, there are many children trafficked for various reasons such as labor, begging, and sexual exploitation. Because of the nature of this crime; it is hard to track; and due to the poor enforcement of laws, it is difficult to prevent.Harlan, Emily K. \\"It Happens in the Dark: Examining Current Obstacles to Identifying and Rehabilitating Child Sex-Trafficking Victims in India and the United States.\\" University of Colorado Law Review, vol. 83, 01 July 2012, p. 1113. Due to the nature of this crime, it is only possible to have estimates of figures regarding the issue. India is a prime area for child trafficking to occur, as many of those trafficked are from, travel through or destined to go to India. Though most of the trafficking occurs within the country, there is also a significant number of children trafficked from Nepal and Bangladesh. There are many different causes that lead to child trafficking, with the primary reasons being poverty, weak law enforcement, and a lack of good quality public education. The traffickers that take advantage of children can be from another area in India, or could even know the child personally. Children who return home after being trafficked often face shame in their communities, rather than being welcomed home., Chopra, Geeta. Child Rights in India.

Examples  Let H be the hypergraph with vertex set V = {A,B; a,b} and edge set: > E = { {A,a}, {B,b}, {A,b}, {B,a} } The widths of H are: * w(H) = 2, since E is pinned e.g. by the set { {A,a}, {B,b} }, and cannot be pinned by any smaller set. * mw(H) = 1, since every matching can be pinned by a single edge. There are two matchings: {{A,a}, {B,b}} is pinned e.g. by { {A,b} }, and { {A,b}, {B,a} } is pinned e.g. by { {A, a} }.  Characterizations  The disjointness graph of H, denoted D(H), is a graph where each edge in H is a vertex in D(H), and every two disjoint edges in H are adjacent in D(H). The matchings in H correspond to the cliques in D(H). Meshulam characterized the widths of a hypergraph H in terms of the properties of D(H). For any positive integer r: * w(H) > r if and only if D(H) satisfies a property called P(r,‚àû), which means that every set of r vertices in D(H) have a common neighbor. This is because w(H) > r iff H has no pinning- set of size r, iff for every subset of r edges of H there is an edge that is not pinned by it, iff every subset of r edges of H has a common neighbor in D(H). * mw(H) > r if and only if D(H) satisfies a property called P(r,0), which means that every set of r vertices in D(H) have a common neighbor, and in addition, there is a clique C in D(H) which contains a common neighbor of every such set. The line graph of H, denoted L(H), is a graph where each edge in H is a vertex in L(H), and every two intersecting edges in H are adjacent in L(H). The matchings in H correspond to the independent sets in L(H). Since L(H) is the complement of D(H), the above characterization can be translated to L(H): * w(H) > r if and only if for every set of r vertices in L(H) there is a vertex not adjacent to any of them. * mw(H) > r if and only if for every set of r vertices in L(H) there is a vertex not adjacent to any of them, and in addition, there is an independent set I in L(H) which contains a vertex not adjacent to any such set. The domination number of a graph G, denoted Œ≥(G), is the smallest size of a vertex set that dominates all vertices of G. The width of a hypergraph equals the domination number or its line-graph: w(H) = Œ≥(L(H)). This is because the edges of E are the vertices of L(H): every subset of E that pins E in H corresponds to a vertex set in L(H) that dominates all L(H). The independence domination number of a graph G, denoted iŒ≥(G), is the maximum, over all independent sets A of G, of the smallest set dominating A. The matching width of a hypergraph equals the independence domination number or its line-graph: mw(H) = iŒ≥(L(H)). This is because every matching M in H corresponds to an independent set IM in L(H), and every subset of E that pins M in H corresponds to a set that dominates IM in L(H).

The book explores the homoeroticism of both literal and figurative acts of human cannibalism that occurred during slavery in the United States. Woodard examines the sexual nature of documented instances of flesh-eating, and details the various manners of consumption whereby black Americans were metaphorically or actually eaten. In the book, Woodard defines consumption as a range of parasitic practices, including institutionalized hunger, seasoning rituals, and sexual modes of consumption. The Delectable Negro draws on Works Progress Administration interviews, advertisements for runaway slaves, and slave narratives. The book includes textual analyses of the works of Harriet Jacobs and Frederick Douglass as well as an examination of the treatment of Nat Turner, whose flesh was turned into \\"medicinal\\" grease. Woodard died in 2008 and never saw The Delectable Negro published. It won the 2015 Lambda Literary Award for LGBT Studies. Overview The Delectable Negro explores the homoeroticism of literal and metaphorical acts of human cannibalism coincident with slavery in the United States. Woodard writes that the consumption of black men by white male slaveowners was a \\"natural by-product of their physical, emotional, and spiritual hunger\\" for the black man. Woodard argues that homoeroticism was also part of how black Americans experienced their own consumption and not a unidirectional phenomenon, as it \\"emanated from black men toward white men and toward each other.\\" The book approaches the concept of consumption literally, with documented cases of cannibalism, and figuratively, as a spiritual and societal phenomenon. Woodard defines consumption as a spectrum of practices, including sexual modes of consumption, flesh-seasoning rituals, institutionalized hunger, and soul harvesting. Woodard argues that cultural aspects of U.S. plantations were \\"based in parasitism and a dynamic of human consumption,\\" building on Orlando Patterson's notion of slavery as a parasitic institution in Slavery and Social Death: A Comparative Study. Woodard identifies practices such as the systemic starvation of slaves as parasitic relationships that use black bodies to fuel the construction of whiteness. Contents A 19th-century wood engraving of the capture of Nat Turner, whose body, Woodard argues, is continuously consumed, both literally and metaphorically. Woodard draws on a wide range of critical methodologies and texts, including Works Progress Administration interviews, advertisements for runaway slaves, and slave narratives. He writes that when black Americans described instances of cannibalism, they \\"tried to understand why and how they had become so delectable, so erotically appetizing, to a nation and white populace that, at least rhetorically, denied and despised their humanity.\\" Woodard begins The Delectable Negro at the intersection of the transatlantic slave trade and the consumptive appetites of white people. While white cannibalism was widely reported in accounts of African slaves from the 16th century up through the 19th, previous scholarship largely dismissed the accounts as superstition or \\"unfounded indigenous terrors.\\" Woodard validates black accounts, offering evidence of punishment rituals, including an instance of a slaveholder forcing slaves to eat the broiled ear of a member of their community. Woodard writes how in the autobiography The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, Equiano's recurring fears of being cannibalized by the Europeans who captured him were intertwined with his homoerotic attachments to white men. Woodard then examines a series of historical incidents where the slaveowners' culture of honor is bolstered by the consumption and sexualized brutalization of slaves. The third and fourth chapters of The Delectable Negro include close textual analyses of the works of Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs. Woodard writes that Douglass described slavery \\"more than anyone else has, as a cannibalistic institution\\" and suggests that Douglass may have been raped while he was a slave. Turning his focus to Jacobs' Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Woodard argues for a \\"more fluid conception of gender and black consumption.\\" He offers an original interpretation of Jacobs' character of Luke, arguing that the variance and fluidity of Luke's desires and gender enables him \\"to survive within a culture of consumption.\\" Woodard also explores white women's roles inside \\"economies of power, sexuality, and gender consumption.\\" The final chapters of The Delectable Negro trace the notions of consumption to the modern era. Woodard approaches the historical figure of Nat Turner, whose flesh was rendered into \\"medicinal\\" grease, through William Styron's fictionalized 1967 novel The Confessions of Nat Turner. Woodard addresses black intellectual critiques of the book and James Baldwin's defense of it. He links the heteronormativity and anxiety around homoeroticism evident within 1960s black radical movements to the legacy of the rape of black men during slavery. Woodard locates the black male interior as a site of both hunger and violation. In describing the \\"suppressed history and politics of the black, male orifice,\\" Woodard writes how the mouth and anus should be decoupled from sexual practice and instead be used to theorize black interiority. The Delectable Negro reviews 20th-century representations of the black male erotic interior, including the chain gang oral sex scene from Toni Morrison's novel Beloved. Woodard also outlines a genealogy of the uses of black bodies as figures for a \\"politics of interiority.\\" Posthumous publication The author, Vincent Maurice Woodard (1971‚Äì2008), received his PhD from the University of Texas at Austin. He was a poet and an English professor at the University of Colorado Boulder. His first draft of The Delectable Negro, in 2005, was entitled Recovering the Black Male Womb: Slavery, Homoeroticism and Nineteenth-Century Racial Uplift. At a 2006 American Studies Association conference, Woodard delivered the paper \\"Blood Magic and Sorcery in the State Formation Archive\\", laying out the key terminology he would use in The Delectable Negro. Woodard never saw the book published, having died in 2008. Following posthumous editing by Justin A. Joyce and Dwight A. McBride, The Delectable Negro was published by New York University Press in 2014. The book's foreword is by E. Patrick Johnson. Reception In a Journal of Gender Studies book review, Rachel van Duyvenbode called The Delectable Negro a tour de force, writing that it would appeal to those \\"interested in the intersections of sexuality, language, and gender identities.\\" Christopher Lloyd wrote in American Studies that the book as an \\"interruption into critical theory alone is itself worth celebrating.\\" Carla Peterson called The Delectable Negro a \\"bold and brilliant book.\\" Reviewer Justin Rogers-Cooper writes that Woodard develops \\"a 'transhistorical' approach as a lens to excavate the homoeroticism of slave life.\\" The Delectable Negro won the 2015 Lambda Literary Award for LGBT Studies.

He also served as Minister of Finance from March 15 to August 15, 1980. Education and early career Neijhorst studied economics at the University of Amsterdam and the School of Economics in Rotterdam, eventually receiving his drs. in economics from the Catholic University of Tilburg in 1972. During his studies, he was active in the Nationalist Student Movement, an organisation of Surinamese students in the Netherlands. Cabinet When Henk Chin A Sen became Prime Minister after the 1980 Sergeants' Coup, he chose Neijhorst as his Finance Minister. Neijhorst at the time had been serving as the economic director of the National Development Bank. After the serving Minister of Economic Planning was dismissed in June, Neijhorst took over that position as well. However, when President Ferrier was forced by the military to resign in August, Neijhorst voluntarily resigned from the Cabinet soon after. He was the basis for a fictional Finance Minister in 's 1981 novel Afrekening in Paramaribo (Settling in Paramaribo). After his resignation, Neijhorst became a member of the Committee for Netherlands-Suriname Cooperation. He also joined the Surinaams Postspaarbank (Surinamese Postal Savings Bank) as a director. In March 1982, Neijhorst was jointly appointed as Prime Minister and acting Finance Minister to succeed Chin A Sen. He was part of the four-member Policy Centre, a governing body whose other members were Foreign Minister , Military Council Chairman Desi Bouterse, and Military Council Vice-Chairman Roy Horb. In theory, the Policy Centre would provide a buffer between the National Military Council and the civilian Cabinet of Ministers. However, Neijhorst and the rest of the Cabinet chose to resign after the National Military Council unilaterally decided to eliminate opposition leaders. In 1991, Neijhorst became an economic advisor to the Venetiaan government. Later career Neijhorst contributed photographs of 1960's sports teams to The First Surinamese Sports Encyclopaedia (1893-1988). He also edited a 1998 volume of articles by . In honor of Humphrey Mijnals' eightieth birthday (2010), Neijhorst published a tribute brochure in cooperation with the Surinamese Football Association. Neijhorst drew attention to Mijnals' pioneering records: one of the first foreign players in Brazilian football and the first nonwhite captain of USV Elinkwijk.

P√§daste manor is the only remaining manor house on Muhu island. It was established as a manorial estate in the village of P√§daste in the 16th century. The first owners were the Baltic German family von Knorring. Later it has been the property of several different members of the Baltic nobility. The estate was a profitable agricultural centre during especially the 18th century, with large rye fields, an orchard, sheep pastures, hayfields and birch forests. The manor house itself was originally constructed in wood. At least one of families that owned the estate did not ever live at the manor, and therefore little interest was for a long time given to the embellishment of the estate. In 1875 however the presently visible main building was erected. Apart from the main building, the estate also preserves many of the outbuildings, dating from approximately the same time.

The Temple of Solomon is depicted as a Gothic building under construction. Miniature from an illuminated manuscript of Josephus's Antiquities of the Jews ( AD) made for John, Duke of Berry. The construction of cathedrals in the Gothic style was the most ambitious, expensive, and technically demanding building work of the Late Middle Ages. Cathedrals, the mother churches of bishops' dioceses and built at their episcopal sees, were built in the architectural style of Gothic architecture throughout Western Christianity from the late 11th century until the Renaissance, particularly in Western Europe and the Crusader States. Cathedral-building required high-level sponsorship, substantial funding, often over decades, a large number of highly skilled workers, and solutions to unprecedented and very complex technical problems. Completion of a new cathedral usually took at least half a century, and many took much longer, involving generations of architects and workers. Since construction could take so long and was so expensive, portions of many cathedrals were built in several successive styles, and many were left unfinished.  Motivation  The 11th to 13th century brought unprecedented population growth and prosperity to northern Europe, particularly to the large cities, and particularly to those cities on trading routes. The old Romanesque cathedrals were too small for the population, and city leaders wanted visible symbols of their new wealth and prestige. The frequent fires in old cathedrals were also a frequent reason for constructing a new building, as at Chartres Cathedral, Rouen Cathedral, Bourges Cathedral, and numerous others.  Finance  A window at Bourges Cathedral showing carpenters, barrel makers and wheelwrights (lower panels) the windows' likely sponsors Bishops, like Maurice de Sully of Notre-Dame de Paris, usually contributed a substantial sum. Wealthy parishioners were invited to give a percentage of their income or estate in exchange for the right to be buried under the floor of the cathedral. In 1263 Pope Urban IV offered Papal indulgences, or the forgiveness of sins for one year, to wealthy donors who made large contributions. For less wealthy church members, contributions in kind, such as a few days' labour,the use of their of oxen for transportation, or donations of materials were welcomed. The sacred relics of saints kept by the cathedral were displayed to attract pilgrims, who were invited to make donations. Sometimes the relics were taken in a procession to other towns to raise money. The guilds of the various professions in the town, such as the bakers, fur merchants and drapers, frequently made donations, and in exchange small panels of the stained glass windows in the new cathedral windows illustrated their activities.  Master Builders  Tombstone of Hugues Libergier, Master Mason of Reims Cathedral, depicts him in the robes of a doctor of theology The key figure in the construction of a cathedral was the Master Builder or Master Mason, who was the architect in charge of all aspects of the construction. One example was Gautier de Varinfroy, Master Builder of √âvreux Cathedral. His contract, signed in 1253 with the Master of the Cathedral and Chapter of √âvreux, paid him fifty pounds a year. He was required to live in √âvreux, and to never be absent from the construction site for more than two months. Master Masons were members of a particularly influential guild, the Corporation of Masons, the best-organized and most secretive of the medieval guilds. The names of the Master Masons of Early Gothic architecture are sometimes unknown, but later Master Masons, such as Godwin Gretysd, builder of Westminster Abbey for King Edward the Confessor, and Pierre de Montreuil, who worked on Notre-Dame de Paris and the Abbey of Saint-Denis, became very prominent. Eudes de Montreuil, the Master Mason for Louis IX of France, advised him on all architectural matters, and accompanied the king on his disastrous Seventh Crusade. The profession was frequently passed from father to son. The most famous family of cathedral-builders was that of Peter Parler, born in 1325, who worked on Prague Cathedral, and was followed in his position by his son and grandson. The Parlers' work influenced European cathedrals as far away as Spain. Master Masons frequently travelled to see other projects, and consulted with one another on technical issues. They also became wealthy. While the salary of an average mason or carpenter was the equivalent of twelve pounds a year, the Master Mason William Wynford received the equivalent of three thousand pounds a year. The Master Mason was responsible for all aspects of the building site, including preparing the plans, selecting the materials, coordinating the work of the craftsmen, and paying the labourers. He also needed a substantial knowledge of Christian theology, as he had to consult regularly with the bishop and canons about the religious functions of the building. The epitaph of the Master Mason Pierre de Montreuil of Notre-Dame de Paris described him appropriately as a \\"doctor of stones\\". The tomb of Hugues Libergier, Master Mason of Reims Cathedral, also depicts him in the robes of a Doctor of theology.  Plans  Master Masons usually first made a model of the building, either of papier-m√¢ch√©, wood, plaster or stone, to explain the building to the bishop and canons. When the plan was approved,it was very difficult to make multiple large scale drawings, because parchment was expensive and usually scrubbed off and reused, and printing on a large scale was not yet possible. The plans for certain parts were sometimes drawn or inscribed in full scale on the floor in the crypt or other portion of the worksite, where they could be easily consulted. The original plans of Prague Cathedral were rediscovered in the 19th century and were used to complete the building. Materials Building a cathedral required enormous quantities of stone, as well as timber for the scaffolding and iron for reinforcement. Stone Sometimes stone from earlier buildings was recycled, as at Beauvais Cathedral, but usually new stone had to be quarried, and in most cases the quarries were a considerable distance from the cathedral site. In a few cases, such as Lyon and Chartres cathedrals, the quarries were owned by the cathedral. In other cases, such as Tours Cathedral and Amiens Cathedral, the builders purchased the rights to extract all the stone needed from a quarry for certain period of time. The stones were usually extracted and roughly trimmed at the quarry, and then taken by road, or preferably shipped, to the building site. For some early English cathedrals, some stone was shipped from Normandy, whose quarries produced an exceptionally fine pale-coloured stone ‚Äì Caen stone. The preferred building stone in the √éle-de-France was limestone. As soon as they were cut, the stones gradually developed a coating of calcination, which protected them. The stone was carved at the quarry so the calcination could develop. then shipped to the building site. When the facade of Notre-Dame de Paris was cleaned of soot and grime in the 1960s, the original white colour was exposed. On land, stones were often moved by oxen; some shipments required as many as twenty teams of two oxen each. The oxen were particularly important in the construction of Laon Cathedral, moving the all stones to the top of a steep hill. They were honoured for their work by statues of sixteen oxen placed on the towers of the cathedral. Each stone at the construction site carried three mason's marks, placed on the side which would not be visible in the finished cathedral. The first indicated its quarry of origin; the second indicated the position of the stone and the direction it should face; and the third was the signature mark of the stone carver, so the Master Mason could evaluate the quality. These marks allowed modern historians to trace the work of individual stone carvers from cathedral to cathedral. Wood An enormous amount of wood was consumed in Gothic construction for scaffolding, platforms, hoists, beams and other uses. They particularly consumed durable hard woods such as oak and walnut. This led to a shortage of these trees, and eventually led to the practice of using softer pine for scaffolds, and reusing old scaffolding from worksite to worksite. Iron A large amount of iron was also used in early Gothic for the reinforcement of walls, windows and vaults. Because the iron rusted and deteriorated, causing walls to fail, it was gradually replaced by other more durable forms of support, such as flying buttresses. The most visible use of iron was to reinforce the glass of rose windows and other large stained glass windows, making possible their enormous size (fourteen metres in diameter at Strasbourg Cathedral) and their intricate designs. Standardization As the period advanced, the materials gradually became more standardized, and certain parts, such as columns and cornices and building blocks, could be produced in series for use at multiple sites. Full- size templates were used to make complex structures such as vaults or the pieces of ribbed columns, which could be reused at different sites. The result of these efforts was a remarkable degree of precision. The stone pillars of the triforium of the apse of Chartres Cathedral have a maximum variation of plus or minus 19 millimetres. Excess materials and stone chips were not wasted. Instead of building walls of solid stone, walls were often built with two smooth stone faces filled in the interior with stone rubble. Construction site Cathedrals were traditionally built from east to west. If the new building was replacing an older cathedral, the choir at the east end of the old cathedral was demolished first, to begin construction of the new building, while the nave to the west was left standing for religious services. Once the new choir was completed and sanctified, the rest of the old cathedral was gradually torn down. The walls and pillars, timber scaffolding and roof were built first. Once the roof was in place, and the walls were reinforced with buttresses, the construction of the vaults could begin. One of the most complex steps was the construction of the rib vaults, which covered the nave and choir. Their slender ribs directed the weight of the vaults to thin columns leading down to the large support pillars below. The first step in the construction of a vault was the construction of a wooden scaffold up to the level of the top of the supporting columns. Next, a precise wooden frame was constructed on top of the scaffold in the exact shape of the ribs. The stone segments of the ribs were then carefully laid into the frame and cemented. When the ribs were all in the place, the keystone was placed at the apex where they converged. Once the keystone was in place, the ribs could stand alone, Workers then filled in the compartments between the ribs with a thin layer of small fitted pieces of brick or stone. The framework was removed. Once the compartments were finished, their interior surface, visible from below, was plastered and then painted, and the vault was complete.

This included the hewers who cut the stone, the posers who set the stones in place; and layers who cemented the pieces together. These craftsmen worked alongside the carpenters who built the complex scaffolds and models. Work continued six days a week, from sunrise until sundown, except Sundays and religious holidays. The stones were finished at the site and put into place, following the drawings by the Master Mason displayed in his workshop on the site, or sometimes inscribed on the floor of the cathedral itself. Some of these plans can still be seen on the floor of Lyon Cathedral. Since the Gothic cathedrals were the tallest buildings built in Europe since the Roman Empire, new technologies were needed to lift the stones up to the highest levels. A variety of cranes were developed. These included the treadmill crane, a type of hoist powered by one or more men walking inside a large treadmill (). The wheel varied in size from 2.5 metres to 8 metres, and allowed a single man to hoist a weight of up to 600 kilograms. During the winter, the construction on the site was usually shut down. To prevent the rain or snow from damaging the unfinished masonry, it was usually covered with fertilizer. Only the sculptors and stone-cutters, in their workshops, were able to continue work.

They were managed by foremen who reported to the Master Mason. The foremen used tools such as the compass to measure and enlarge the plans to full size. and levels using lead in glass tubes to assure and the blocks were level, The stone dressers used similar tools to make sure the surfaces were flat and the edges were at precise right angles. Their tools were frequently shown in the medieval miniature drawings of the period (see gallery).

Many Gothic cathedrals, like Notre-Dame de Paris and Chartres, were built on the sites of Romanesque cathedrals, and often used the same foundations and crypt. In Romanesque times the crypt was used to keep sacred relics, and often had its own chapels and, as in the 11th century crypt of the first Chartres Cathedral, a deep well. The Romanesque crypt of Chartres Cathedral was greatly enlarged in the 11th century; it is U-shaped and 230 metres long. It survived the fire in the 12th century which destroyed the Romanesque cathedral, and was used as the foundation for the new Gothic cathedral. The walls of the crypt chapels were painted with Gothic murals. The names of the Master Masons were frequently inscribed on the walls of cathedral crypts.

They grew larger and larger over the course of the Gothic period, until the filled the entire walls beneath the vaults. In the early Gothic period the windows were relatively small, and the glass was thick and densely coloured, giving the light a mysterious quality which contrasted strongly with the dark interiors. In the later period, the builders installed much larger windows, and frequently used grey-or white coloured glass, or grisaille, which made the interior much brighter. The windows themselves were made by two different groups of craftsmen, usually at different locations. The coloured glass was made at workshops located near forests, because an enormous amount of firewood was needed to melt the glass. The molten glass was coloured with metal oxides, and then blown into a bubble, which was cut and flattened into small sheets. The glass sheets were then transferred to the workshop of the window-maker, usually close to the cathedral site. There a full-size precise drawing of the window was made on a large table, with the colours indicated. The craftsmen cracked off off small pieces of coloured glass to fill in the design. When it was complete, the pieces of glass were fit into slots of thin lead strips, and then the strips were soldered together. The faces and other details were painted onto the glass in vitreous enamel colours, which were fired in a kiln to fuse the paint to the glass. The sections were and fixed into the stone mullions of the window. and reinforced with iron bars. In the later Gothic periods the windows were larger and were painted with more sophisticated techniques. They were sometimes covered with a thin layer of coloured glass, and this layer was carefully scratched to achieve finer shading, giving the images greater realism. This was called flashed glass. Gradually the windows came more and more to resemble paintings, but lost some of the vivid contrast and richness of color of early Gothic glass.

Its purpose was to illustrate the personages, stories and messages of the Bible to the ordinary church-goers, of whom the great majority were illiterate. Figurative sculpture was common on the tympana of Romanesque churches, but in Gothic architecture it gradually spread across the entire facade and the transepts, and even the interior of the facade. The sculptors did not select the subject matter of their work. Church doctrine specified that the themes would be specified by the church fathers, not the artists. Nonetheless, the Gothic artists over time began to add figures with increasingly realistic features and expressive faces, and gradually the statues became more lifelike and separate from the walls. An early innovative feature used by Gothic sculptors was the statue-column. At Saint-Denis, twenty statues of the apostles supported the central portal, literally portraying them as \\"pillars of the church.\\" The originals were destroyed during the French Revolution, and only fragments remain. The idea was quickly adapted for the west porch of Chartres Cathedral (about 1145), possibly by the same sculptors. Traces of paint on sculpture of the portals shows that they were originally painted in bright colours, each colour having a particular theological significance. This effect is now recreated today at Amiens with the use of coloured light.

The highly- individualized faces on facade of Amiens Cathedral  Towers and bells  Towers were an important feature of a Gothic cathedral; they symbolized the aspiration toward heaven. The traditional Gothic arrangement, following Saint- Denis near Paris, was two towers of equal size on the west facade, flanking a porch with three portals. In Normandy and England, a central tower was often added over the meeting point of the transept and the main body of the church, as at Salisbury Cathedral. Since the towers were usually built last, sometimes long after other parts of the building, they were often built entirely or partly in different styles. The south tower of Chartres Cathedral is in large part still the originally Romanesque tower, built in the 1140s. The north tower, built at the same time, was struck by lightning and was rebuilt in the 16th century in the Flamboyant style. Towers had had the practical purpose of serving as watch towers, and, more important, housing bells which chimed the hour, and rang to celebrate important events, when the King was in attendance, or for funerals and periods of mourning. Notre-Dame de Paris was originally equipped with ten bells, eight in the north tower and two, the largest, in the south tower. The principal bell, or bourdon, called Emmanuel, was installed in the north tower in the 15th century, and is still in place. It required the strength of eleven men, pulling on ropes from a chamber below, to ring that single bell.

They were popular in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries until the genre became merged with the short story in the nineteenth century. Distinguishing contes from other literary genres is notoriously difficult due to the various meanings of the French term ' that span folktales, fairy tales, short stories, oral tales, and fables. Definition Conte comes from the French word , \\"to relate\\". The French term conte encompasses a wide range of narrative forms that are not limited to written accounts. No clear English equivalent for conte exists in English as it includes folktales, fairy tales, short stories, oral tales, and to lesser extent fables. This makes conte notoriously difficult to define precisely. A conte is generally longer than a short story but shorter than a novel. In this sense, contes can be called novellas. Contes are contrasted with short stories not only in length but subject matter. Whereas short stories () are about recent (\\"novel\\") events, contes tend to be either fairy tales or philosophical stories. , too, could be oral. Contes are often adventure stories, characterized by fantasy, wit, and satire. It may have moral or philosophical underpinnings, but is generally not interested in psychological depth or circumstantial detail. They may be profound, but not \\"weighty\\". These generic characteristics also contribute to their short length. Contes can be either in prose or verse. History Reading of Voltaire's L'Orphelin de la Chine in the salon of Marie Th√©r√®se Rodet Geoffrin Contes were popular in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The distinction between contes and short stories was largely obsolete by the nineteenth century when the genres became merged. Reflective of this, the English term \\"short story\\" was coined in 1884 by Brander Matthews. Famous examples of contes include Contes et nouvelles en vers by Jean de La Fontaine, Histoires ou contes du temps pass√© by Charles Perrault, and ' by Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, the last of which spawned a subgenre called conte cruel. Voltaire is said to have invented the genre of , also practiced by Denis Diderot. However, according to Edmund Gosse, \\"those brilliant stories\\" by Voltaire ‚Äì Candide, Zadig, L'Ing√©nu, ', and The White Bull ‚Äì \\"are not, in the modern sense, at all. The longer of these are , the shorter , not one has the anecdotical unity required by a .\\" While it is possible that Voltaire drew inspiration to his contes from an oral source, namely his performances to Louise B√©n√©dicte de Bourbon early in his career, he only published contes after his exile. Francophone contes also exist outside of France. For instance, Lafcadio Hearn incorporated creole contes in his works.

He became the first player in the Open Era to win from two sets down in a US Open final, the first male player to win from two sets down at the US Open since Pancho Gonzales came back to defeat Ted Schroeder in 1949 and the first at any major event since Gast√≥n Gaudio defeated Guillermo Coria in the 2004 French Open final. Both players served for the championship in the final set (Zverev at 5‚Äì3 and Thiem at 6‚Äì5), but both were broken at 30. This was the first time in history that the US Open final was decided by a fifth set tie-break, 50 years after it was introduced in 1970. Thiem's victory made him the first Austrian player to win a Grand Slam singles title since Thomas Muster at the 1995 French Open, the first male player born in the 1990s to win a Grand Slam singles title and the first new Grand Slam tournament singles champion since Marin ƒåiliƒá won the 2014 tournament. The gap between ƒåiliƒá and Thiem's titles was the longest between two new Grand Slam singles champions in the history of men's tennis, surpassing the previous longest gap between Juan Mart√≠n del Potro and Andy Murray respectively at the 2009 and 2012 editions of the US Open. Coincidentally, all four players would win their respective titles at the same major. This was also the first time in history that four consecutive Grand Slam singles finals were decided in the fifth set. Zverev became the youngest male finalist at a major championship since Novak Djokovic at the 2010 US Open. Rafael Nadal was the defending champion, but chose not to participate due to safety concerns related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the short amount of time between the US Open and the rescheduled European clay season. This marked the first time since the 1999 US Open that both Nadal and Roger Federer were absent from a Grand Slam tournament. There were no qualifiers this year. The ATP rankings valid on August 3 (being the rankings from March 16) were used to determine the main- draw entry list. World No. 1 Djokovic was disqualified from the tournament during his fourth-round match against Pablo Carre√±o Busta. After being broken to trail 6‚Äì5 in the first set, Djokovic hit a ball towards the baseline before the commencement of the following game. This ball accidentally hit a lineswoman in the throat. Djokovic's unbeaten 26‚Äì0 2020 season, as well as his 29-match winning streak (extending back to the 2019 Davis Cup Finals), ended as a result. This confirmed that someone born after the 1980s would win a men's singles Grand Slam tournament and Djokovic became the first player to be defaulted from such a tournament since Stefan Koubek at the 2000 French Open. Koubek threw his racket and hit a ballboy during his second-round match against Attila S√°volt, following three previous warnings for coaching and unsportsmanlike conduct. Djokovic's ejection from the tournament ensured there would be a guaranteed first-time Grand Slam finalist in the top half of the draw. His disqualification also meant this would be the first Grand Slam tournament since the 2004 French Open to not feature either Djokovic, Federer or Nadal in the semifinals, the first tournament since the 2003 Wimbledon Championships in which none of the quarterfinalists had previously won a Grand Slam tournament and the first Grand Slam men's singles tournament not to have been won by Djokovic, Federer or Nadal since Stan Wawrinka defeated Djokovic in the 2016 US Open final.List of Open Era Grand Slam men's singles finals This also guaranteed a maiden Grand Slam champion in men's singles for the first time since the 2014 tournament, when ƒåiliƒá defeated fellow first-time finalist Kei Nishikori in straight sets.

Thus, the exact arrival dates of many early Virginia colonists in the Muster Roll of 1625 and other documents are uncertain. Incomplete and inaccurate Virginia Company records also make it harder to determine arrival dates or correct other errors concerning early colonists. * Kolb, Avery E.

First Supply mission  William Spence came to Virginia in the First Supply mission to Jamestown in 1608. He is sometimes shown in modern printed lists of passengers as both a \\"gentleman\\" and a \\"labourer,\\" not only a double listing, but in seemingly inconsistent categories.If Spence were a \\"labourer,\\" and thus most likely an indentured servant, he served the period of his indenture, perhaps working as a farmer, and then became a landowner. On the other hand, in the names of those arriving at Jamestown in the First Supply voyage in Captain John Smith's The General History, Book 3, Chapter 4, as reprinted in Haile at page 252, Spence is only listed as a \\"gentleman.\\"A footnote added by editor Edward Wright Haile to the chapter \\"A True Discourse\\" by Ralph Hamor in Haile, Edward Wright, ed. Jamestown Narratives: Eyewitness Accounts of the Virginia Colony: The First Decade: 1607-1617. Champlain, VA: RoundHouse, 1998. , p. 814 states that \\"In his General History, Captain John Smith wrote \\"from all those farmers, whereof the first was William Spence, an honest, valiant and industrious man, and hath continued from 1607 to this present [1624].\\" The 1607 date given in Haile's quote from a Smith writing about Spence is inconsistent with the arrival of Spence in the First Supply mission in 1608 as shown by Haile in his excerpts from Smith's The General History at page 252 of Jamestown Narratives. It would coincide with any source which stated that William Spencer, rather than William Spence, arrived at Jamestown in 1607 on the Susan Constant, but not with usual accounts of either Spence's or Spencer's arrivals and not with online Susan Constant passenger lists which include neither name. Martha McCartney states, with citations, at McCartney, 2007, p. 661 that Spence arrived in the First Supply mission and at p. 662 that Spencer arrived in the \\"Sarah or Susan Constant.\\" The Susan Constant has occasionally been referred to erroneously as the \\"Sarah Constant\\", as noted in Grizzard, Frank E. and Dennis Boyd Smith.

Sarah versus Susan. The William and Mary Quarterly 16, No. 4, 1936. pages 515-21. Also, the phrase \\"Sarah or\\" from McCartney may not require the interpretation that it is referencing different names for the Susan Constant since a ship named the Sara(h) arrived at Jamestown in August 1611 with the returning Sir Thomas Gates (governor).

Farmer, Landowner  Martha McCartney supports John Smith's statement that Spence \\"reportedly\\" was the first farmer to work his own land on Jamestown Island. She also states that in 1618 Spence offered to employ workers of the late governor, Sir Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, after West had died at sea while returning to the colony from England in summer 1618.McCartney, 2007, 661, 735. West's subordinate, Captain Edward Brewster, to whom Spence made the offer, was prevented from taking custody of his goods by Deputy Governor Samuel Argall, who misappropriated West's laborers and artisans to work on his own projects.McCartney, 2007, pp. 157, 661, 735.

Later life  In 1619, as a \\"tobacco taster\\", Spence evaluated the quality of tobacco by sampling portions of the tobacco crop. Because of his early arrival at Jamestown and continued residence there, Spence was considered an \\"Ancient planter\\", which was simply a descriptive term. Ancient planters were early Virginia colonists who arrived when the colony was managed by the Virginia Company of London. They received land grants if they stayed in the colony for at least three years. Under the terms of the \\"Instructions to Governor Yeardley\\" issued by the London Company in 1618, these colonists received the first land grants in Virginia.Because the surviving historical records are incomplete, and sometimes demonstrably inaccurate, it is not possible to compile a definitive list of Ancient Planters. Kolb, Avery E. Early Passengers to Virginia: When Did They Really Arrive?, The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 88, No. 4, Oct. 1980. pp 401-414. Kolb, pp. 403-406, reconciled many of the records and determined the most likely dates of many arrivals by finding spelling errors, transcription errors, unclear handwriting, imprecise records of ship departure and arrival dates, years recorded or remembered differently due to the continued use by some of the Julian calendar in which the year began on March 25, dual arrivals of persons who arrived, returned to England and then arrived again not long afterward (e.g. Sir Thomas Gates), confused passengers because of their long journeys and their sometimes delayed debarkation dates as well as imprecise questions about arrival or journeys that may have been asked of the colonists by the recorders of records such as the 1625 muster. These questions may have led to imprecise answers related to what was happening in England prior to departures and inexact dates or arrival, according to Kolb. In January 1619, William Spence along with John Fowler received a patent for 300 acres in Archer's Hope, a few miles from Jamestown.The abstract of a patent of 500 acres in Archer's Hope to Lucy Webster, Judith Webster and Jane Webster states that the property included 300 acres patented to William Spence and John Fowler in January 1619.

Since Spence continued to live at Jamestown Island, McCartney surmises that he placed indentured servants on the property along with his partner, John Fowler, who lived there. Fowler and four others, not including Spence or his wife, were killed in the Indian massacre of 1622 at Spence's house at Archer's Hope.Price, David A.

Spence had been in England in early 1622 and he returned on the James, which departed for Jamestown on July 21, 1622. The February 16, 1624 census of the Virginia colony's inhabitants listed William Spence, his wife and his young daughter Sara(h), but Spence and his wife were shown on the list as \\"lost.\\" They were also shown on a 1624 list of persons who had died since February 1623.Lists of the Livinge & the Dead in Virginia 1623 Transcribed from ‚ÄúColonial Records of Virginia‚Äù, R.F.

Spence's daughter, Sara Spence, 4 years old, was entrusted to a 20-year old widow, Mrs. Susan Bush, as guardian, at Elizabeth City, Virginia. On August 14, 1624, the General Court ordered John Johnson, who had property on Jamestown Island and at Archer's Hope, to put a roof on the house and repair the fence of Ensign William Spence, Johnson's recently deceased neighbor.McCartney, 2007, pp. 425, 661. After 3 months, the court also ordered Sara Spence's \\"guardians\\" to have her property at Archer's Hope surveyed. On May 16, 1625, Sara Spence's guardians, including the Reverend George Keith as well as Susan Bush, were ordered to appear before the General Court.McCartney, 2007, p. 178. In October 1625, having still not had the property surveyed, the guardians were told by the court that they would be fined if they did not have the land surveyed. Susan Bush placed the Spence property in the hands of a tenant, Thomas Farley, on November 21, 1625. Sara Spence died by April 3, 1627 when the court ordered the Reverend George Keith of Elizabeth City to inventory her estate.McCartney, 2007, p. 662. Susan Bush also may have died by this date since she was not included in the order pertaining to the Spence property.  Death  Records of the exact date and manner of the deaths of William Spence and his wife have not been found.The approximate date of William Spence's death shows conclusively that William Spencer who served in the House of Burgesses representing Mulberry Island in 1632/33 was a different person.

She was the one who welcomed the King of the Dwabens called Nana Kwaku Boateng and his army. A civil war broke out between the Ashantis and the Dwabens in 1832, six years after the battle of Akatamansu. In 1824, during her regime, she also provided refuge for the Kotokus who had also assisted Abuakwa in some wars against the Ashantis. During her reign, part of the Juabens revolted against the Ashantis. Nana Kwaku Boateng was the leader of the rebels who was their chief. They were forced to leave Juaben in Ashanti for the south.  History of Akyem Abuakwa  The first King and Founder of Akyem Abuakwa was Nana Kunutunkununku I after the collapse of Adansi Kingdom and they broke away from the Kingdom. A number of Kings took accession to the throne.  Legacies  It was claimed she was a woman who was the 24th Okyenhene to occupy the paramount stool. She was compared to Nana Yaa Asantewaa. Nana Dokua was both a heroine and a warrior as she fought 99 times against the Ashantis, protecting the Akyems from the attacks of the Ashantis. She is remembered for her feats in songs.

Formally controlled by the Roman Empire, York had been taken over by the Anglo-Saxons and had become the capital of the Kingdom of Northumbria. In 866 this kingdom was in the middle of a civil war with √Ülla and Osberht both claiming the crown. The Vikings led by Ubba and Ivar were able to take the city with little trouble. In the spring of 867 √Ülla and Osberht would put unite in an attempt to push the Vikings out of York. Despite the Northumbrians making it inside the walls, the battle ended with a slaughter of Northumbrians, and the deaths of both √Ülla and Osberht. Following their victory the Vikings would initially set up a puppet king named Ecgberht, before later creating the Kingdom of J√≥rv√≠k centered on York.  Background = York  The Multangular tower, part of York's Roman wall Known as Eoferwic, York was taken over by the Anglo-Saxons after the Roman Empire left in the 5th century. The city would become the capital of the Kingdom of Northumbria, serving the needs of both the king and the Archbishop of York. By 867 the ancient Roman walls still stood, but were crumbling and in disrepair, proving to be little defence against the attacking Northumbrians.  Viking invasion  Viking raids against Britain had been occurring since the 8th century, but it was not until the 860s that Viking armies were formed with the intention of conquering lands. In 865 the Great Heathen Army landed in East Anglia and started the invasion that would lead to the creation of Danelaw. Led by Ubba and Ivar (who may be the same historical figure as √çmar) the Vikings first took York on 1 November 866. Ivar's apparent motive was to avenge the death of his father, Ragnar Lodbrok. The Kingdom of Northumbria was in the middle of a civil war after √Ülla had driven out the previous king Osberht by force. The Vikings had little trouble taking York, but failed to capture √Ülla.  Battle  In the spring of 867 √Ülla and Osberht put aside their differences and united in an attempt to push the invaders out of Northumbria, leading to the battle of York on the 21 March. The battle started well for the Northumbrian forces, who were able to break through the city's defences. It was at this point that the experience of the Viking warriors was able to show through, as the narrow streets nullified any advantage of numbers the Northumbrians may have had. The battle ended with a slaughter of the Northumbrian army, and the death of both √Ülla and Osberht. A somewhat different account stated that the Vikings were caught under the walls of York, between their attackers and York's Northumbrian garrison. However, the Danes rallied and the battle turned into a massacre of the Northumbrians and the killing of both of their kings. Norse tradition holds that the victorious Ivar and Ubba were brothers and that they captured √Ülla and subsequently blood eagled him. In contrast, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle simply states \\"both kings were slain on the spot\\".  Aftermath  Kingdom of Jorvik, shown next to Danelaw In York, Viking leaders established a puppet king named Ecgberht. This situation would remain until 872, when a revolt drove Ecgberht into exile in Mercia. Halfdan Ragnarsson of the Vikings ended the revolt in 876 and directly occupied York and the rest of Deira (south-east Northumbria), partitioning it among his followers. In time, this would lead to the creation of the Kingdom of J√≥rv√≠k, which existed under Viking control until 910, when it was taken by the Anglo-Saxons. The kingdom would be reoccupied by the Vikings on several occasions until 954, from when it was subjected to the rule of Wessex. No future attempt would be made to re-establish the Kingdom of Northumbria. Before the area was integrated into Wessex, the surviving Anglo- Saxon lords would rule Northumberland north of the river Tees from Bamburgh.

Trained as a nurse in London, she began a career as a historian after noticing no history about Ayrshire whitework embroidery in books following an exhibition at the Signet Library which she visited. Swain's research on the subject resulted in the publication of several books, she held two exhibitions, and wrote about embroidery, household textiles and tapestries in museum journals, magazines and newspapers. She was awarded an honourary Master of Arts degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1981. A pencil portrait of Swain was made by Elizabeth Blackadder and a collection of papers and objects related to her career are stored at National Museums Scotland. Early life Swain was born on 13 May 1909, in Parbold, Lancashire, England. She was the oldest of five children of the iron and steel merchant John Swain and his wife, Isabella, Hart. Both of Swain's parents died by the time she turned 17. She was taught embroidery by her Irish grandmother. In 1929, unable to obtain a university education because of family circumstances, she ventured to London to train as a nurse at St Bartholomew's Hospital, because it was one of a few professions to offer an instant salary and more education at that time. Swain remembered her time at the hospital from 1930 to 1937 fondly despite the strict discipline from the matron she worked under. She authored Pre-Reformation Nurses in England in 1933, which won her the American Nutting Dock prize, and wrote Some Medieval Nurses in England for Nursing Times in the same year. Swain went to art history lectures by David Talbot Rice at the University of Edinburgh. Career In 1947, Swain moved to Scotland as the inaugural Edinburgh International Festival commenced. It was there at an exhibition at the Signet Library that she became aware of Ayrshire whitework embroidery and noticed there was no history about it in books. Swain researched the topic, which was compiled into the 1955 small book, The Flowerers, the story of Ayrshire White Needlework. The book was critically acclaimed and she received encouragement to publish everything she had researched. Swain documented old family bills and papers and brought them to scholarly attention in her work. She wrote A Devotional Miscellany in the mid-1960s, and held two exhibitions called Needlework from Scottish Country Houses and Clothes from Scottish Houses at The Merchants Hall, Edinburgh in 1966 and 1969, respectively. In 1970, her second book, Historical Needlework: A Study of Influences in Scotland and Northern England, was published following travelling across Scotland with Victoria Wemyss. Swain's third book, The Needlework of Mary Queen of Scots, was published in 1973. She was sought to catalogue the embroideries and tapestries of the Holyrood Palace, Edinburgh by the individuals tasked with upgrading the Palace's displays at the in the mid-1970s. Swain believed this was an area of collections that had been neglected in previous years. In 1980, her fourth book, Figures on Fabric: Embroidery Design Sources and Their Application, was published. She authored the book \\"for herself\\" because it was an area she had a great interest in. This was followed by Swain's fifth book, Ayrshire and Other Whitework, in 1982. In 1986, Scottish Embroidery, Medieval to Modern, was published, followed by a contribution to Upholstery in Britain and America from the 17th Century to World War I the following year. Swain wrote Tapestries and Textiles at the Palace of Holyrood House in 1988 followed by Embroidered Stuart Pictures in 1990 and Embroidered Georgian Pictures in 1994. The final book came after a suggestion from Glasgow School of Art embroider Kathleen Whyte and it brought all of Swain's interests in embroidery. Outside of embroidery, she worked as a social worker for the disadvantaged and disturbed on a volunteer basis from 1954 to 1974.

This Act was construed as one with the Electricity (Supply) Acts 1882 to 1919, and was cited as the Electricity (Supply) Acts 1882 to 1922. It established the powers of electricity authorities to borrow money for the construction and operation of electricity generating and transmission systems; it amended some Sections of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1919 relating to electricity districts and joint electricity authorities; it empowered electricity authorities to provide a supply to railway companies; and established methods of reclaiming expenses of various statutory bodies.  Background  The Electricity (Supply) Act 1919Electricity (Supply) Act 1919 It had provided for the establishment of the Electricity Commissioners (Sections 1‚Äì3), and their duty to determine Electricity Districts (Section 5). The Act also provided for the establishment of joint electricity authorities (Section 8). The Electricity Commissioners had started work in January 1920 and had identified fifteen electricity districts across the country. However, the establishment of joint electricity authorities (JEAs) was problematic. JEAs were set up on a voluntary basis, and they were largely supported by local authority electricity undertakings. But power companies thought that the JEAs would take over their functions and therefore opposed their establishment. One of the intentions of the 1922 Act was therefore to allow the JEAs to have appropriate financial powers and to protect the interests of the power companies. Following the enactment of the 1919 Act there were several wider issues that affected the efficient operation of the British electricity supply industry. During the passage of the Electricity (Supply) Bill through Parliament in 1919, the Conservatives had opposed the bill's proposals for the formation of district electricity boards with their compulsory purchase powers to take over generation and to provide interconnections. Members of the Conservative Party were suspicious of ‚Äòschemes which smacked of nationalisation‚Äô, and more widely opposed state intervention in industrial affairs, the powers of compulsion of the Electricity Commissioners were curtailed. The period from 1919 to 1926 has been characterised as ‚Äòthe diagnosis of failure‚Äô of the British electricity supply industry. The Electricity Commissioners admitted that their activities had met with only limited success, as they had been involved in interminable rounds of public inquiries. Lack of powers of compulsion and municipal pride had militated again cooperation between local authority undertakings. There were also concerns about the dominance of power companies and larger local authorities. While the 1922 Act dealt with some of these issues, the problems of integration and cooperation were addressed later by the Electricity (Supply) Act 1926.  Provisions of the Act  The Electricity (Supply) Act 1922 received Royal Assent on 4 August 1922. The Act comprised 31 sections as follows. * Section 1 gave joint electricity authorities (JEAs) the power to borrow money for purchasing plant, undertaking works or as working capital. * Section 2 allowed JEAs or local authorities to establish a sinking fund for new works. * Section 3 gave the Electricity Commissioners the authority to authorise JEAs to issue stock. * Section 4 gave JEAs the power to issue stock to discharge the purchase price of generating plant or transmission lines. * Section 5 empowered undertakings to give financial assistance to a JEA or other body. * Section 6 empowered undertakings to lease undertakings to JEAs. * Section 7 allowed the Electricity Commissioners to cover their expenses by charging JEAs or power companies. * Section 8 allowed methods of payment of purchase price payable to local authorities. * Section 9 permitted JEAs to use transmission lines. * Section 10 allowed JEAs to dispose of works not required. * Section 11 allowed JEAs or undertakers to continue way-leaves. * Section 12 allowed undertakings to continue to operate generating stations after transfer to a JEA. * Section 13 set conditions for restrictions to take a supply of electricity. * Section 14 allowed Electricity Commissioners to suspend powers of purchase of undertakings. * Section 15 permitted the wider exercise of powers and duties. * Section 16 limited the power of JEAs over power companies. * Section 17 allowed the Electricity Commissioners to limit the supply area of power companies. * Section 18 set limits on prices charged. * Section 19 amended Section 5 of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1919, concerning the determination of electricity districts. * Section 20 amended Section 6 of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1919, concerning the establishment of joint electricity authorities. * Section 21 amended Section 16 of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1919. * Section 22 defined methods of charging and revision of prices. * Section 23 made provision for standby supplies of electricity. * Section 24 made provision for supplies to be given to railway companies. * Section 25 allowed persons not being undertakings to supply electricity. * Section 26 allowed payment of debentures. * Section 27 provided for the winding up of companies. * Section 28 detailed the expenses of the London County Council. * Section 29 provided for payment to Scottish local authorities. * Section 30 applied the Act to Scotland. * Section 31 Construction and extent.  Operation of the Act  The 1922 Act resulted in the establishment of JEAs, however only four were constituted, namely: * North Wales & South Cheshire JEA, formed 1923 * London and Home Counties JEA, formed 1925 * West Midlands JEA, formed 1925 * North West Midlands JEA, formed 1928.  Later acts  The Electricity (Supply) Act 1926 (16 & 17 Geo. 5. c. 51) established the Central Electricity Board. The Electricity Act 1947 (10 & 11 Geo. 6, c. 54), nationalised the UK electricity supply industry. The Electricity Commissioners, the power companies, and the joint electricity authorities were abolished. The Ownership of electricity generation and transmission facilities was vested in the British Electricity Authority.

History In the mid-16th century, the Company of Merchant Adventurers of York owned a house on Marketshire, a street which was becoming known as Pavement. They let out the house to Christopher Herbert, a merchant who later became Lord Mayor of York. He purchased the property in 1557, and later passed it on to his son, Thomas, who acquired properties including one neighbouring to the rear, facing onto Lady Peckett's Yard. In 1606, Thomas' grandson was born in the house. He later became Sir Thomas Herbert, 1st Baronet, and the house is now named after him. After the older Thomas' death, in 1614, the property passed to another merchant, John Jaques, who is believed to have rebuilt the house facing onto Pavement. John Jacques then passed the property onto his son, Roger, who sold it in 1647. In 1648, the new owner of the properties demolished the northern end of the house facing onto Lady Peckett's Yard, and constructed a new block, linking the two houses, with a main entrance and staircase. This entrance, and the whole of Lady Peckett's Yard, were accessed through a passage, under the west end of the Pavement part of the house. In the 1660s, a further block was added to the south of the existing house, linking to another mid-16th century house, further down Lady Peckett's Yard. Early in the 19th-century, the easternmost part of the house was demolished, and replaced by the Golden Fleece pub. In 1869, an extension was added to the southernmost section of the house. This rearmost section is now a separate property, listed at Grade II*. Around this time, a single- storey extension was added in front of the entrance on Lady Peckett's Yard, and the facade on Pavement was renovated. By the 1920s, the house was in use as a drapers' shop, with a warehouse to the rear. It had become dilapidated, and the Victorian external plastering with fake stonework had fallen out of favour. Francis W. B. Yorke restored the property, for use by an insurance company. He exposed the timber framing, and added new external decoration, windows and finials based on surviving examples. Internally, he discovered small sections of wall paintings and paintings on beams in the main hall, and he restored paneling in the first floor parlour, in part by using paneling from the second floor. In more recent years, the ground floor has again be used as a shop. For many years, it was operated by Jones the Bootmaker. Since 2019, it has been occupied by York Gin. Architecture Facade facing Lady Peckett's Yard The part of the house facing Pavement has three main stories, plus cellars and attics. The ground floor is open and does not retain any original features, and it extends into the link building. The first floor is one large parlour, and contains a highly ornate fireplace. Its facade is timber framed, with the floors jettied out, while to the side, it is built of brick. The section facing onto Lady Peckett's Yard is all timber framed, but with the ground floor largely rebuilt in brick. Internally, each floor is now open and without original features.

The site is a scheduled ancient monument that comprises a group of six burial cairns. Two of the cairns, Mid Gleniron I and Mid Gleniron II are chambered cairns of the Clyde tradition. These are of historic importance because of their multi-stage construction which provides evidence for the development of Clyde cairns at the beginning of the Neolithic period.  Mid Gleniron I & II  The chamber cairns, Mid Gleniron I & II, were excavated by Corcoran between 1963 and 1966. These excavations revealed a multi-period construction. Mid Gleniron I was revealed to have been originally two separate, small (5m diameter) rectangular cairns, each with entrances into single chambers. These cairns were set in the same direction, with their cambers aligned. Thomas notes the close positioning of these two cairns implies that it was anticipated that they would be incorporated into a larger construction. At a later date, these cairns were modified and subsumed into a large trapezoidal cairn. A third chamber was added as well as a forecourt, typical of Clyde cairns. The facade marking out the forecourt was made of standing stones measuring over eight meters across. Mid Gleniron II also apparently began as a set of two smaller cairns. Like at Mid Gleniron I, this site was transformed into a large trapezoidal cairn with forecourt. However, here only one of the cairns was subsumed and altered by the new monument. The forecourt led into a new chamber which was blocked centuries later in the early Bronze Age. Historic Environment Scotland's Statement of National Importance for the site notes its potentially international significance for shedding light on \\"the sequence and development of funerary and ritual architecture during the Neolithic and early Bronze Age.\\" Excavation at Droughdool Mote between 1999-2002 revealed a round cairn at the top of the mound, similar in construction to Mid Gleniron A.

When a group of bandits were tyrannizing the farmers in the area and disappeared into hiding every time after their raids, the young man had the idea of playing to be part of the group. In this way, he found out that their hiding place was in a cave within the mountain, and the bandits were taken and hanged.Reynir Ingibjartsson: 25 G√∂ngulei√∞ir √° Reykjanesskaga.

History When the U.S. Army arrived in Iceland during World War II, a jeep track was built up onto the mountain, which is still existing. Where today are located some transmitters from the telephone company S√≠mi and from Icelandic National Television R√öV, the U.S. Army had installed some radar stations,Reynir Ingibjartsson: 25 G√∂ngulei√∞ir √° Reykjanesskaga.

Geography The mountain is situated near the tip of Reykjanes peninsula between Svartsengi Power Station with the Blue Lagoon and the town of Grindav√≠k at road 43 (to the east), whereas another road, route 426, goes round it from Grindav√≠k to Svartsengi on its western side. Geology √ûorbj√∂rn originates from subglacial eruptions during a cold spell in the Pleistocene. It is located within the area of the Reykjanes volcanic system and enclosed by Holocene lava fields. In addition, a visible tectonic graben runs over the top of the mountain. G.B.M. Pedersen ,P.

Harpenden 2002, p.14 or Svartsengi volcanic system, depending on author. Pleistocene volcanoes on Reykjanes peninsula Pleistocene volcanism on the Reykjanes peninsula is represented esp. by bigger edifices, i.e. shield volcanoes and subglacially formed ridge volcanoes or tuyas. When analyzing aerial photographs of shield volcanoes and glaciovolcanic edifices, it becomes clear that the latter have much steeper slopes than the shields. On Reykjanes, all kinds of subglacial volcanoes are to be found, tindars, also called subglacial mounds, originating in fissure eruptions under glaciers, flat-topped tuyas (see Geitahl√≠√∞), complex tuyas and even conical tuyas (Keilir). Tindars/subglacial mounds/hyaloclastic ridges originate from subglacial fissure eruptions which never saw the light of day. Only after the Pleistocene glaciers were gone and the sea level down, these mountains now can be researched. Whereas the magma of tuyas has more pressure, viscosity or volume so that in the end the edifice which builds up first subglacially in a lake of its own meltwater, pushes in the end through the water and ice to built up some tephra and/or lava layers on top as well as lava deltas at its slopes.Edwards, B.R., Gudmundsson, M.T., Russell, J.K., 2015. Glaciovolcanism. In: Sigurdsson, H., Houghton, B., Rymer, H., Stix, J., McNutt, S. (Eds.), The Encyclopedia of Volcanoes, pp. 377‚Äì393. Formation of the tuya √ûorbj√∂rn It also built up in an melt water lake so that Pedersen etal. define it ‚Äúis a pillow-dominated flat-topped tuya without a lava cap‚Äù. H. Bj√∂rnsson explains that though the mountain is crossed by many faults and a graben, so that it looks like a complex formation, it has its origin in a single eruption. Haukur Bj√∂rnsson: Myndun √ûorbjarnarfells. BS ritger√∞. Lei√∞beinandi √Årmann H√∂skuldsson. Jar√∞v√≠sindadeild H√°sk√≥li √çslands 2015 (in Icelandic, abstract also in English) The pillows are formed and cooled in two stages: First the lava touches water and cooles down very fast, in a second step after some pillow layers have formed, the melt water lake or water (it the eruption is underwater in the sea or a lake) cooles it down further. On the other hand, it only depends on the magma pressure if the eruption turns explosive and forms hyaloclastite or not. In the top region of √ûorbj√∂rn, there is also a rather eroded crater, but probably because of the erosion, no trace of subaerial lavas has been found. The tuya is slightly elongated in the direction of the volcanic fissure systems of Reykjanes, i.e. southwest to northeast.See maps, eg. in: Reynir Ingibjartsson: 25 G√∂ngulei√∞ir √° Reykjanesskaga.

Reykjav√≠k , p. 71 Earthquakes and uplift in the region in 2020 (ongoing at time of writing) As is often the case on Reykjanes peninsula, an episode of different earthquake series and uplift, i.e. probable intrusions, is going on in the region since some months. The activity stops in between and so takes up after. In January 2020, the instruments of IMO (the Icelandic Met Office, in Icelandic: Ve√∞urstofa √çslands) and other volcano monitoring stations showed a rather fast uplift around and esp. to the west of √ûorbj√∂rn. It stopped after some time and then started again. Together with repeated earthquake series in the region, but also at the tip of Reykjanes peninsula (Gunnuhver, Sudurnes Geothermal Power Station) as well as under Fagradalsfjall which probably is part of Kr√Ωsuv√≠k volcanic system, but sometimes also seen as an independent volcanic system, more uplift and earthquakes were measured.

Early life Lowe was born on 4 October 1880 in Panmure, Victoria. His father was born in Lancashire, England, and worked as a schoolteacher until being pensioned off due to blindness. Lowe attended the University of Melbourne where he was the \\"model of the able poor student\\", graduating Bachelor of Arts in 1900, Master of Arts in 1902 and Bachelor of Laws in 1904. He was admitted to the Victorian Bar in 1905. Judicial career Lowe was appointed to the Supreme Court of Victoria in January 1927, with the encouragement of his friend Owen Dixon. He notably presided over the trial of the accused Pyjama Girl murderer in 1944 and the murder trial of John Bryan Kerr in 1951, where his decision was upheld on appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. He also presided over \\"four major commissions of inquiry\\" ‚Äì the 1940 inquiry into the Canberra air disaster, the 1942 inquiry into the Bombing of Darwin, the 1943 federal royal commission into Eddie Ward's \\"Brisbane Line\\" allegations, and the 1949‚Äì1950 Victorian royal commission into the Communist Party of Australia. In the latter, communist activist Ralph Gibson concluded that \\"contrary to our fears and to the Government's hopes, displayed a certain genuine interest in Communist theory and a certain respect for evidence\\". Lowe retired from the court in 1964 after a record 37 years, presiding over his final trial in 1962. Other activities Lowe served as chancellor of the University of Melbourne from 1941 to 1954, in place of John Latham.

Plot Alec Bailey, an electrical engineer, has been struggling after the death of his parents and twin brother, Charlie. He finds himself sleeping around, gambling his money away, with a failing business, and drowned in debt, when suddenly his banker tells him that a man is offering to pay all his debt. Suspicious at first, Alec soon realizes this is true; his estranged uncle, Raymond Heacock, offers to pay his ¬£88,000 debt in exchange for Alec moving out of England to Nova Scotia, Canada for a whole year. Although not thrilled by the idea, Russian debt collectors are after him, and after hiding from them in a church where the Priest tells him this opportunity might be God's way of giving him a second chance, he decides to accept his uncle's offer. Two days later, he moves to his uncle's house in Nova Scotia. His first day in town, Alec meets Cecilia, who says she knows his uncle. She offers to help him out by placing an ad on the local newspaper to bring him some business. His first days in town don't go so well: he meets Father Malloy, who invites him to church, so he tells him he's Buddhist to get out of going; he meets Officer Tom, who gives him a citation and makes it clear he dislikes Alec's uncle; and the ad on the newspaper, which was supposed to state \\"The Healer, I can fix anything\\" is printed as \\"The Healer, I can fix anyone.\\" Suddenly, because of the newspaper ad, people start showing up at his house asking him to heal their ailments. Alec is frustrated at the confusion and at not getting any electrical engineering business. Needing money, he starts working with Cecilia, who is a veterinarian. Strangely, one by one, each of the people that came to him to be healed, were actually getting cured, even though Alec refused to see them and told them he was an engineer, not a doctor. The strangest incident, however, came when Father Malloy had a heart attack and died in front of Alec, but minutes later came back to life. Officer Tom misunderstands the situation, arresting Alec for the murder of Father Malloy, until Father Malloy clears up the misunderstanding revealing he is in fact alive. Father Malloy then talks to Alec, telling him that he believes he has a God-given gift to heal people. Alec has had enough of people thinking he can heal them; he goes back to his uncle's house to pack his bags planning to leave. While packing, he finds a key for the basement with a note. In the basement, he finds pictures of his ancestors and an empty frame labeled with his name. His uncle explains that their family has a secret gift to heal that skips a generation. He tells Alec he must accept the gift before midnight or he will lose it forever. Overwhelmed, Alec does not accept the gift, later having to explain his decision to the entire town. The town, however, is understanding and simply thanks him for the miracles he got to perform. Although he didn't accept the gift, his uncle is a man of his word and will pay his debt if Alec remains in town the whole year, so he discards his plan to leave. A few days later, a family arrives from out of town begging him to heal their daughter, Abigail (Abigail is based on a real person), from cancer. Alec explains he can't help, but agrees to pretend to try to heal her, after Abigail begs him to, for the sake of her parents. Abigail spends the whole weekend with Alec and Cecilia, and they quickly bond. Alec also makes up with Officer Tom, after he reveals that Abigail is his niece. After that weekend, Alec is particularly moved, revealing that Charlie, his twin brother, had died of cancer. He goes back to his uncle and tells him he regrets not accepting the gift. Alec goes to church, angrily asking God for the gift back and to not let Abigail die. The film ends some time later, when Alec and Cecilia speak to Abigail on the phone, who tells them that the cancer has gone away and she is in remission. Upon hearing the good news Alec and Cecilia kiss. Knowing that Alec got the gift back, his uncle heads back to England, and they make up before he departs. The last scene is a shot of the basement, showing the frame labeled Alec Bailey, Raymond Heacock now displays a picture of him.

Freight operations were introduced in Manarola on 15 September 1913. Double track between Manarola and was opened in 1920 and extended on 14 November 1933 as far as the Gaggiola tunnel and between Riomaggiore and Corniglia on 31 May 1959. In 1959, a new passenger building and a loading area for goods were built, as well as a pedestrian tunnel to connect with the town. On 1 December 1949, the station became an assuntoria (a station operated by an agent under contract). It is currently operated as an unstaffed halt. In June and July 2011, the station was also served by the Treni del Mare (\\"trains of the sea\\") managed by the private company Arenaways, which became bankrupt shortly afterwards.  Buildings and infrastructure  The station has two platforms; platform 1 is used mainly by trains to La Spezia and platform 2 by trains to Genoa. A pedestrian path in the tunnel, running parallel to the track, gives access to the nearby station. A second pedestrian path to Riomaggiore, but built in the open when the line was built, is a well-known tourist destination and now called the Via dell'Amore (\\"the Way of Love\\"\\"), although it has been closed for some years due to a landslide.

The Skaar laboratory focuses on nutritional immunity which studies that aspect of the innate immune response to infectious diseases. They have studied (i) nutrient acquisition by bacterial pathogens, (ii) how vertebrate immune proteins sequester nutrients during the pathogenesis of infection and cancer, (iii) competition for nutrients between pathogens and the healthy microbiome, and (iv) the impact of diet on infection. His research has resulted in approximately 200 published research articles.  Research  In order for bacterial pathogens to cause disease, they must obtain nutrients inside their vertebrate hosts. The primary nutrients that are limiting to the growth of bacteria inside vertebrates are metals, because vertebrates have developed numerous metal chelation systems that serve as a host defense against microbial infection. This is one of the aspects of the general concept called nutritional immunity. The Skaar laboratory is interested in identifying the host and bacterial factors that are involved in this competition for metal during the host-pathogen interaction. In particular, they focus on diseases caused by the human pathogens Staphylococcus aureus , Bacillus anthracis (Anthrax), i, and Clostridioides difficile The long term goal of the research is to develop novel therapies to treat microbial diseases.

If children are found alone at the edge of the ice, the Qallupilluit is said to stuff them into its amautik (similar to a parka), before drowning them in the icy water.

History The area occupied by Pavement was outside the Roman city walls, but fairly central within the Mediaeval walls of York. During the Anglo-Saxon and Viking eras, it was at the heart of the commercial area of Jorvik. The location of one of York's two early markets, the road was known as Marketshire, a name first recorded in 1086, and shared with the city ward in which it was located. It was alternatively known as Ousegate, which remains the name of its western continuation. By the Middle Ages, its market days were Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, and the central part of the street was roughly its present width - far wider than most city streets of the time. From 1329, the street was increasingly known as \\"Pavement\\", which is likely to indicate that it was one of the first roads in the city to be paved. As a major open space in the city, it was popular site for public gatherings, it contained a ring for bull baiting, and was also the location where Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland was executed. The market continued to thrive, and a market cross was erected in 1671. By the 18th-century, the market was short of space, and sections of the road were widened: shops in front of St Crux were demolished in 1769, followed by the chancel and part of the churchyard of All Saints, in 1782. The market cross was demolished in 1813. In 1836, Parliament Street was laid out, leading to the demolition of many buildings on the north side of the street, St Crux was demolished in 1887, and then in 1912, Piccadilly was extended to reach Pavement on the south side, resulting in more demolitions. Finally, in the 1950s, Stonebow was constructed as an eastern continuation of the street. Layout and architecture At the western end of the street, Parliament Street runs to the north and Piccadilly to the south, while to the west it splits into High Ousegate and Coppergate. Between those last two streets lies the church of All Saints, Pavement. Several historic buildings lie on the southern side of the street. Sir Thomas Herbert's House is the sole survivor of the large merchants' houses which once lined the street, but the 4, 6, and 10 Pavement, the Golden Fleece pub, 18, 20 and 22 Pavement, 24 Pavement, 26 and 28 Pavement, and 30 Pavement, are all listed buildings. At the eastern end of the street, Stonebow continues to the east, Fossgate runs south, and Whip-Ma-Whop-Ma-Gate runs north. The only historic building surviving on the north side is the parish room of St Crux Church, with the modern Marks and Spencer store dominating. The Shambles lead north off Pavement, while the small Lady Peckett's Yard leads of its southern side.

The bust is one of the Townley Marbles collected by Charles Townley (1737‚Äì1805) and sold by his heir Peregrine Edward Towneley at a reduced price to the British Museum in 1805. Unlike most busts of Hadrian and other emperors, it shows him in heroic nudity. The bust was found in Rome and is carved from Greek marble.Treasures of the World's Cultures exhibition information on the bust Description and history The Townley bust is comparable with a bronze head of Hadrian in the Louvre. The type is characterized by an elaborate hairstyle of thick curls combed forwards. Both the marble bust and the bronze head have features similar to the marble head of Constantine the Great () found on Stonegate, a street in York above the ancient via praetoria thoroughfare of the castra at Eboracum, garrison of the VI Victrix Roman legion from Hadrian's reign. It is likely that the York and Louvre heads were images of Hadrian contemporary with the Townley bust, with the York example having been re-carved with the image of Constantine wearing a corona civica after the Battle of the Milvian Bridge. The Townley bust, like other genuine statues of Hadrian, portrays his distinctively creased earlobes. It has been suggested from these that Hadrian suffered from, and eventually died from, coronary artery disease. Charles Townley acquired the bust for ¬£105 in March 1795 from Barwell Brown, the son of the antiquary and art dealer Lyde Browne, together with a veiled statue head of Adonis. He paid ¬£168 for the pair, including transport from Livorno, in March the following year, as well as ¬£8/6 (5%) interest on the delay. Townley annotated his copy of the work of Ennio Quirino Visconti listing the portraits of Hadrian, indicating that he was in possession of this example. At the British Museum's exhibition on Hadrian: Empire and Conflict in 2008, the bust was included in one of two galleries of busts representing distinct phases in Hadrian's life, one earlier and dominated by the women of the Nerva‚ÄìTrajan dynasty, the later without female portraits. In the exhibition the Townley bust appeared in the earlier group, arranged together with busts of Hadrian's Vibia Sabina, mother-in-law Salonia Matidia, and grandmother-in-law Ulpia Marciana alongside busts of Marciana's brother, Hadrian's predecessor emperor Trajan () and his own wife Plotina. Trajan and Hadrian were provincial Romans from Italica in Hispania Baetica on the Iberian Peninsula. The exhibition layout alluded to the rumour that Plotina had arranged Hadrian's rise to power. The bust has since been displayed alongside a bust of Antinous, Hadrian's lover from Bithynia, an arrangement commented on by Janina Ramirez in the 2020 BBC Four documentary Museums in Quarantine. Unlike Hadrian, sculptures of Antinous are more often than not nude.

Designed by Mariano Benlliure, it consists of a sculptural ensemble dedicated to Antonio Maura.  History and description  The monument was funded by popular subscription, and the design was awarded to Mariano Benlliure. The standing bronze statue of Antonio Maura, depicted in oratorical attitude, tops off the stone pedestal. Placed below Maura, an allegory of Truth made of white marble completes the ensemble. Truth is depicted pointing at a cartouche reading (\\"Antonio Maura equaled thought with [his] life\\"), adapted from a verse from Ep√≠stola moral a Fabio.; The monument was unveiled at its location in the Pla√ßa del Mercat on 13 December 1929, on occasion of the 4th anniversary of the death of Maura. The statue was toppled and damaged on 11 November 2014 by the fall of a nearby ficus. After undergoing a restoration process, the statue returned to the Pla√ßa del Mercat a year later.

It was the seat of the Sakai clan, a fudai daimy≈ç clan who ruled over Sh≈çnai Domain, Dewa Province in the T≈çhoku region of northern Japan under the Tokugawa shogunate. Location The castle is located in the center of Tsuruoka city in the southern portion of the Sh≈çnai plain between the Mogami River and the Sea of Japan. The area was a major commercial center and was located in a large rice growing area, with riverine connections to inland portions of Dewa Province, and the kitamaebune coastal trading network. It was also junction for roads from Echigo province with the Yamagata plain and Shinj≈ç basin.  History  Tsurugaoka Castle was originally called Daih≈çji Castle, and was built the seat of the Daih≈çji clan in 13th century. The Daih≈çji were retainers of the Kamakura shogunate who came to the Sh≈çnai region as a local governor, and became a regional warlord after the start of the Muromachi period. However, by the Sengoku period, the clan had been severely weakened by internal disputes and relocated their residence to the more secure Oura Castle in mountains five kilometers to the north. From 1570 Daih≈çji Yoshiyuki (1551-1583) began an aggressive campaign to recover lost territories with the assistance of the Honj≈ç clan, who were retainers of the Uesugi. However, after the Honj≈ç withdrew their support, he was assassinated by one of his retainers and the Daih≈çji territory was soon overrun by Mogami Yoshiaki. The Mogami were defeated at the Battle of J≈´gorigahara in 1588 and the territory was conquered by the Uesugi; however, the Uesugi lost it back to the Mogami after the Battle of Sekigahara and the formation of the Tokugawa shogunate. Mogami Yoshiaki renovated the castle and renamed it Tsurugaoka Castle with the intent to use it as his retirement home in 1603. After his death, the Tokugawa shogunate dispossessed the Mogami clan of its holdings and transferred the Sakai clan to become daimyo of Sh≈çnai. The Sakai were descendants of Sakai Tadatsugu (1527-1596), a retainer of Tokugawa Ieyasu. The castle was further expanded under their tenure, which lasted until the Meiji restoration of 1868. Structure The defenses of Tsurugaoka Castle consisted of three concentric square-shaped enclosures surrounding clay ramparts and wet moats. As with other castles in the T≈çhoku region, although the castle makes extensive use of earthworks, stone walls were only used for the inner bailey. The central area is about 200 meters square, with a complex main gate at the southeast corner. The castle never had a tenshu, but a two- story yagura in the northwest corner was a substitute. Other corners of the central enclosure were guarded by single-story yagura, and a large palace for the lord covered much of the central area. The second bailey is a narrow area wholly surrounding central area, with a two-story yagura at southeast corner and three gates. The third bailey was much larger, covering the area between two rivers east and west of the castle, and containing residences of high- ranking retainers and the han school. After the Meiji restoration, the castle was abolished and all its buildings were demolished. The third bailey was sold and subsequently covered by the urban expansion of Tsuruoka city, but the moats and clay walls of central and secondary area have kept much of their shape, and these areas contain a Shinto shrine, the Sh≈çnai Shrine, and park. Tsuruoka Park has been selected as one of the \\"100 Cherry Blossom Spots in Japan\\". The han school has also survived as part of the Chid≈ç Museum, and is a National Historic Site. The castle was listed as one of the Continued Top 100 Japanese Castles in 2017. Bibliography   Mizoguchi, Akihiro: Tsurugaoka-jo in: Miura, Masayuki (Hrsg.): Shiro to jinya. Tokoku-hen.

The flight was part of the Vande Bharat Mission to repatriate Indian nationals stranded due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The flight crew aborted two landing attempts because of heavy rain and tailwind. On the third landing attempt, the aircraft touched down on runway 10, but skidded off the end of the tabletop runway and fell into a slope, killing 19 passengers and both pilots. The four cabin crew members and 165 passengers survived, of whom over 100 were injured.  Background = Airport  Calicut International Airport, in Karipur, Kozhikode, is one of the most dangerous airports in India according to India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The DGCA designated Calicut Airport as a \\"critical airfield\\", which means that only the captain (and not the first officer) can perform takeoffs and landings there. The Airports Authority of India says that the airport is licensed for use in all weather conditions under instrument flight rules, but that the pilots operating flights to and from Calicut Airport (both day and night) should have sufficient flying hours to handle the dangerous conditions. Captain Mohan Ranganathan, a member of a safety advisory committee of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, said in 2011 that Calicut Airport is \\"unsafe\\". He recommended that Calicut Airport not be used for landing during wet weather. He observed that the airport had a tabletop runway with a down-slope and had inadequate \\"buffer zones\\", referring to the runway end safety areas at both ends of the runway. Instead of the recommended safety area, it had only . The width of runway 10 is only half of minimum width that existing regulations require. Calicut Airport also lacked an engineered materials arrestor system, which could have prevented the accident. Calicut Airport's management ignored several warnings about the dangerous conditions at Calicut Airport. Many international airlines stopped landing wide-body aircraft at Calicut because of the dangerous conditions. Conditions at Calicut Airport were investigated in 2019, following a tailstrike during the landing of Air India Express plane. The investigation revealed several safety hazards, including multiple cracks in the runways, pools of stagnant water, and excessive rubber deposits. In July 2019, the DGCA issued a show-cause notice to the director of Calicut Airport because of these hazards. According to Yeshwant Shenoy, a lawyer fighting to make airports safe in India, the DGCA should have put restrictions on conditions when airlines could land or take off. He filed a Public Interest Litigation in the Kerala High Court after the crash, to shut down operations of Calicut airport as it is non-compliant with air regulations.  Aircraft and crew  The accident involved a Boeing 737-800 with a short-field performance package, registered as VT-AXH, manufacturer's serial number 36323 and line number 2108. The aircraft that first flew on 15 November 2006, was operated by Air India Express, and had a tail livery with 'India Gate' on the left and 'Gateway of India' on the right. The crew consisted of Captain Deepak Sathe, first officer Akhilesh Kumar; and four flight attendants. Sathe had landed successfully at Calicut airport at least 27 times, including more than ten times in 2020. He had 10,000 hours of flying experience on the Boeing 737, including 6,662 as commander. The chief minister of Maharashtra, Uddhav Thackeray, announced a state funeral for Sathe.  Flight  The aircraft departed stand E6 and took off from runway 30R at Dubai International Airport on 7 August 2020, at 14:14 GST (7 August 2020, 10:14 UTC) and was scheduled to arrive at Calicut International Airport in Kozhikode, Kerala, at 19:40 IST (7 August 2020, 14:10 UTC), covering a distance of . It was a repatriation flight, for people who had been stranded abroad due to the COVID-19 pandemic, under the Vande Bharat Mission.  Crash  The aircraft reached the airport on schedule. The approach was for runway 28, but two landings were aborted due to tailwind and the aircraft circled, waiting for clearance, before making a landing on runway 10. At around 19:37 IST (14:07 UTC), they were given clearance to land on runway 10. Due to the monsoon and floods in Kerala at the time, inclement weather conditions reduced visibility at the time of landing to . Runway 28 was in use and in the first landing attempt, the pilot could not sight the runway and requested for runway 10. On the second attempt on runway 10, the aircraft touched down near taxiway C, which is approximately beyond runway threshold. The aircraft failed to stop before the end of the tabletop runway and plunged into a gorge, splitting the fuselage into two sections upon impact. The accident site was around from the airport terminal. No post-crash fire was reported. It was suggested the crew shut off the engines on landing, which may have saved lives by preventing a fire. According to a CISF officer, the aircraft did not slide into the gorge. It took off from the cliff and then collapsed. The accident was similar to Air India Express Flight 812 which also overran the runway 10 years earlier at Mangalore International Airport killing 158 people on board.  Victims  A total of 184 passengers, four cabin crew and two cockpit crew were on board, all Indian. Twenty-one people died in the crash (including both pilots) and more than 100 people were injured. {class=\\"wikitable collapsible\\" style=\\"text- align: center;\\" +List of fatalities - ! scope=col Type of victims ! scope=col Total on board ! scope=col Survivors ! scope=col Fatalities - !scope=row Passengers  184  165  19 - !scope=row Pilots  2  0  2 - !scope=row Cabin crew  4  4  0 - !scope=row Total  190  169  21 }  Aftermath = Rescue and response  Following the incident, local people from the surrounding Karipur village rushed to the crash site to rescue trapped victims from the aircraft, followed by 40 Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel who were guarding the perimeter of airport, quick reaction team and Chief Airport Security Officer. Family members of the CISF personnel living nearby also joined. Police and firefighters were also deployed for the initial rescue operations. All passengers were evacuated in about three hours and taken to various hospitals in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts. Emergency response team, GO Team and special assistance team of Air India (officially known as 'Angels of Air India') from Kochi, Mumbai and Delhi were sent to the accident site. Three CISF officers were awarded with Director General commendation disc for their rescue efforts after the mishap. The accident is predicted to cost the insurers and their reinsurers , that includes aircraft or hull and liability for third party and passengers. It is around 90 per cent of the insured value and Air India will recover this amount since the aircraft has been totally damaged. The insurer is an Indian insurance consortium led by New India Assurance. Claim settlement survey has already started. The airline has engaged a USA-based firm Kenyon International to recover the baggage. It will be working with Angels of Air India.  COVID-19 infection  Two passengers on the flight who survived tested positive for COVID-19 after arriving at a hospital after the accident. To check the spread among other passengers and rescue personnel, Central Industrial Security Force and Kerala Health Department asked their personnel and other passengers who were on the flight to undertake testing and quarantine. A week later, 24 officers involved in the rescue operation, tested positive. The airport is located in Kondotty municipality, which was listed as a containment zone.  Film  A Malayalam film on the plane crash, named \\"Calicut Express\\" was announced on 19 August 2020.  Investigation  The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) and Flight Safety Departments are investigating the accident. The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered the next day and sent to Delhi for analysis. Boeing is likely to send its investigation team to examine debris of the aircraft for defects and assist the probe. The United States' National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has also sent a member to assist the AAIB. The AAIB team in Kozhikode is probing the incident with the assistance of Airports Authority of India officials, air traffic control, ground staff, CISF, the fire team and the rescue team. It has found evidence of waterlogging of the runway at the time of landing. It is also checking whether ATC was aware of waterlogging and whether the pilots adhered to rules. The preliminary investigation report was expected to be ready in a week after the accident. Another five-member committee was setup by AAIB on 13 August, to investigate the incident. It will be headed by Captain S.S. Chahar, former designated examiner on Boeing 737 Next Generation. The final report will be submitted in five months. The committee will also provide recommendations to avoid such accidents in future. Initial findings suggest that at the time of landing, the tailwind was around . The aircraft was at at an altitude of approximately above the surface of runway 10, which is not considered ideal for short finals during poor weather conditions. The throttle was found to be in a fully forward position (takeoff or go-around position) and the spoilers were retracted from the position of the speed brake lever, which indicates that the pilots might have tried for a go-around. The tailwind, rubber deposits and wet runway affecting the braking performance of the aircraft are thought to be contributory factors to the accident. Civil Aviation Minister, Hardeep Puri, in a press conference at Kozhikode on 8 August, said that there had been sufficient fuel on board for the aircraft to have flown to a diversion airport. The possibility of pilot error, as a cause of the accident, was suggested by DGCA's Arun Kumar.  Compensation  The Government of India and Kerala, each announced an interim relief of compensation for the families of the deceased above the age of 12 years, for below the age of 12 years, for seriously injured and for those who sustained minor injuries. It was also announced that the medical expenses of the injured would be borne by the state government.

The game uses blockchain technology based on Ethereum and was developed in 2018 by Nicolas Julia and Adrien Montfort.  Concept  Players, as managers, compose virtual teams of five soccer players, from blockchain cards on the Sorare platform. Teams are ranked based, on the performance of their players on the real-world soccer pitch, and attributed points. Cards vary in power and experience and can generate bonus points. Every week, when a real-world soccer team is playing a game, the teams with the most points are rewarded with new cards. Managers can buy and sell their cards to other managers on the Sorare platform, with market prices varying continuously, often driven by the performance of players on the real- world pitch. Some of the cards are licensed digital collectibles (rare, super- rare and unique cards). The use of blockchain technology means that Sorare's cards are limited edition digital collectibles that gamers can freely trade and use.  Development  Sorare operates on Ethereum's underlying blockchain network to secure the ownership and distribution of cards. The supply of cards is limited and cards cannot be altered, duplicated, or deleted. Each player card is represented as a non-fungible token (NFT) using the ERC-721 token standard on Ethereum. Each player card is unique and is owned personally by the gamer, validated through the blockchain, allowing its value to appreciate or depreciate based on the market. The licensing partnerships Sorare signs with leagues, such as the K League and clubs such as Atl√©tico Madrid, allows the Sorare cards to have the official branding with the season's player photos and player names. Sorare announced its first licensing partnership with the Belgian Jupiler Pro League in October 2018. In May 2019, shortly after the launch of the beta of the game, the company announced a pre-seed round of EUR 550k including the technology entrepreneur Xavier Niel. In February 2020, they announced a partnership with Juventus Turin to tokenize Cristiano Ronaldo on Ethereum. Ronaldo's 2019-2020 Unique blockchain card holds the record for a card issued by Sorare (over 18 ETH). Sorare raised Ã∞Ã∞ÃØUSD 4 million in July 2020 with German football World Cup champion Andr√© Sch√ºrrle, among others. As of July 2020, Sorare has signed official licensing agreements with over 75 football clubs around the world. Clubs As of 29 September, 100 clubs are present in the game in total. This marks an increase of over 50 additional club sides compared with that in March. A total of 30 clubs from Major League Soccer are without license.

It overlooks the southernmost end of the Thames River as well as the Long Island Sound, and the islands of Fisher's Island and Long Island can be seen from the beach. Ocean Beach Park contains within its boundaries a large sugar-sand beach, boardwalk, mini golf, kiddie rides, waterslides, olympic-size swimming pool, cafeteria, ice cream stand, nature trail, banquet halls, arcade, and often has live music performances during the summer season, specifically on its center boardwalk stage. Firework displays happen often during the summer, typically accompanied by a live tribute band.  History  Ocean Beach Park was founded in 1940 by the New London City Council in the aftermath of the 1938 New England Hurricane. After the hurricane left the Ocean Beach property devastated by intrusive sands and ruined homes, the City Council determined that the best use of the property would be to use it as a public beach park. After many years of operation, the beach eventually found itself a highly visited beach and park, with roughly 500,000 visitors annually. Much of the draw of Ocean Beach comes down to its large beachfront and calmer waters, which are safe for children to swim in and visit. In recent years, the beach has been operated by companies contracted by the City of New London, firstly the Boston Culinary Group, then Centerplate, and finally Sodexo-Centerplate. These companies have handled the renovations and daily operations at Ocean Beach since the early 2000s. Since these companies have been in charge of the park, several major renovations have occurred, including a major overhaul of the park's three banquet rooms, named The Port 'n Starboard, The Nautilus (named after the USS Nautilus, of which there is a large painting inside), and The Pilot House. In addition to the banquet halls, the park has also had an entirely new Boardwalk laid down during 2009. This is the third boardwalk to exist on location at Ocean Beach. Ocean Beach Hurricane Damage, 1938 The park sustained heavy damages twice in its history from two major hurricanes to impact the area - firstly the Hurricane of 1938, and secondly Hurricane Sandy. These two storms caused massive amounts of damage specifically to the creek area of the park, in which sand from the winds of the storm filled the bottom of the nearby Alewife Cove. One of the most known structures to ever be present at Ocean Beach was the Clocktower. The Clocktower stood at the center of the Boardwalk from the park's creation until the late 1990s, when it was removed as it was considered too dangerous to be near beach goers. There has been a recent effort to restore the historic clocktower, and the New London City Council voted in 2018 to accept donations regarding the reconstruction of the clocktower at Ocean Beach. As of the summer of 2020, no progress has been made on the actual construction of any such structure. View of Ocean Beach Park from the water. The clocktower can be seen at center. Despite the park's increasing popularity, there has always been a push to redevelop and remove Ocean Beach and utilize the valuable real- estate for condominium complexes. Prior to the tenure of the current manager, Dave Sugrue, it was apparent that the beach may have been redeveloped. Many of the main park facilities had been condemned by the City of New London as unsafe to work in or inhabit, and there was no clear direction for the park. Despite the looming demise of the park, there remained an active community sect that demanded the restoration and revival of Ocean Beach. A push from the community, new management, and the formation of Save Ocean Beach, a group of community volunteers, kept the park alive. Save Ocean Beach continues to work to improve Ocean Beach as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. The Organization organizes bake sales, fundraisers, and sells custom-designed boards that can be placed in memorial of a loved one on the boardwalk itself. In addition to Dave Sugrue, the other most notable park manager throughout its history was undoubtedly Anthony \\"Tony\\" Pero. Pero was commonly known as \\"Mr. Ocean Beach\\" to locals, and played a very important role in the restoration and continuation of the park through much of the twentieth century. His tenure at Ocean Beach spanned over forty years. His role and legacy at Ocean Beach will continue to play an important role at the park, as the boardwalk is named \\"The Anthony Pero Boardwalk\\". It is a well known fact that Ocean Beach Park was modeled after Jones Beach on Long Island in the state of New York.

Its first squad plays in the Hoofdklasse since 2020. The club was established on 28 October 1928 as TOGB, a Dutch abbreviation for Tot Ons Genoegen Berkel (English translation: To our delight Berkel). Former players include Roland Bergkamp, Dwight Eli and Tim Vincken. History TOGB was founded on 28 October 1928 on grounds behind the Roman Catholic church of Berkel en Rodenrijs. Originally established to quell Sunday afternoon boredom, due to the fact that there was not much to do in the village, young men had looked for entertainment in the nearby Rotterdam - which was not always appreciated in the largely Catholic town. At that time, it was considered a sin to visit dance pavillions or a cinema. However, around that time, football fans started to make their voices heard, as the results of Rotterdam clubs such as Feyenoord, Sparta and Xerxes were followed closely. TOGB would go on to see an increase in membership through the next years, as football became more popular in the area. The first matches were played in an orchard in Berkel, where the ball became deflated within a few weeks because the sport was played on klompen (whole foot clogs). Eventually, the club began playing football where the Sterrenwijk is now. Through the years, its Catholic heritage became a hallmark of the club, with large families with a Catholic background making their mark on TOGB. These included the Olsthoorn brothers and the Vermeulen family. TOGB spent most of its existence in the lower tiers of Dutch football, and reached the Hoofdklasse in 2020; the first club of Lansingerland Municipality to reach the fifth tier of Dutch football ever.

Between 1777 and 1785 he lodged with Jane Hogarth in Leicester Fields. Engaged by West to copy pictures at Windsor, Livesay moved there about 1790, and gave lessons in drawing to some of the royal children. In 1796 he was appointed drawing- master to the Royal Naval Academy at Portsmouth, and lived in Portsea. On an address card which he issued at that time he described himself as \\"Portrait, Landscape, and Marine Painter, Drawing-Master to the Royal Academy, Portsmouth, 61 Hanover Street, Portsea.\\" Livesay died at Southsea in 1826. Works Livesay executed for Jane Hogarth a series of facsimiles of drawings by William Hogarth, her late husband, among them seven illustrating the well- known Tour, published in 1782. While at Windsor he painted portraits of young Etonians, generally small whole-lengths, and a picture by him of Eton Boys going to Montem is in the possession of Eton College, to which it was presented by the Duke of Newcastle in 1891.

History The area of North Street lay within the civilian settlement of Roman Eboracum. A 2nd-century retaining river wall has been excavated, while evidence of craft working from the 9th- to the 11th- centuries has also been excavated. The road was first recorded in about 1090, as Nordstreta, and by the 13th-century, this had become North Street. Starting from the southern end of Ouse Bridge, then the only bridge in the city, it ran north along the south bank of the River Ouse, then turned sharply west, to run parallel to Micklegate. This western section of the street was known for its tanneries, and known as Tanner Row, which is now regarded as a separate street. The remaining section of North Street became known for its warehouses and yards, on the riverside. In the early 1700s, a steam flour mill was established on the street, while in 1788, a private staith was built for better access to the river. Around this time, some larger houses were built on the west side of the street, including in 1776 that of the architect Peter Atkinson. The road later became known for its builders' merchants, with the most important being William Stead, founded in 1802. By the early 20th- century, it was a mixed residential and shopping street. Lying next to the river, the street has frequently suffered floods. The first recorded flood was in 1263, and the most recent serious flood was in 1931. Regular floods combined with the local industry to make the street an undesirable location to live, by the early 19th-century, the street had become one of the poorest in the city. By the 1960s, the street remained rundown. Most of the buildings on the river side of the street were demolished, some dating back to the 17th- century, and were be replaced by the Viking Hotel and a riverside walk. Some historic buildings across the street were restored. Layout and architecture View up North Street, from Micklegate The road runs north from the junction of Micklegate, Skeldergate and Bridge Street. Initially, it is separated from the river by mostly modern buildings, then by the North Street Gardens, which contain a memorial to John Snow, who was born in a house on the street. Buildings on the inland side of the street include Mill House, a former grain mill which is now the headquarters for the police in York, the Whippet Inn pub, the church of All Saints, North Street, and listed buildings at Church Cottages, as well as 33, 35 and 37, and 39 North Street. Next to the church once lay a small building, built in 1900, which was sometimes described as the smallest house in England. However, it was built as a store and was never used as a house. The street now ends at the junction with Tanner Row, and its continuation is named Wellington Row. This road is strongly associated with North Street, to the extent that the tower where it meets York City Walls has become known as \\"North Street Postern Tower\\".

Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources V√≠ctor Manuel Toledo was appointed Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources on May 27, 2019, after the resignation of Josefa Gonz√°lez Blanco Ort√≠z Mena on May 27, 2019. Gonz√°lez Blanco Ort√≠z Mena resigned after a scandal wherein she caused a delay on a flight of Aerom√©xico Toledo Manzur came under fire in August 2020 when an audio of a March 2020 meeting wherein he criticized A MLO and his government of the Fourth Transformation became public. He had earlier criticized the environmental impact of the Mayan Train, a major infrastructure and economic development project in the south of the country. He is said to have major differences with V√≠ctor Villalobos, Secretary of Agriculture and Rural Development (SADER)in questions of agribusiness, and with Alfonso Romo, AMLO's Chief of Staff, whom Toledo Manzur has accused of \\"blocking\\" environmental and alternative energy projects. Greenpeace Mexico expressed its support for Toledo Manzur, while Javier Villareal G√°mez of the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM) called for his resignation. Despite calls for Toledo Manzur's resignation, AMLO on August 6 expressed his support. Toledo resigned because of health reasons on September 2, 2020 and will return to his academic work. He was replaced by Mar√≠a Luisa Albores Gonz√°lez, formerly Secretary of Welfare. Political positions Toledo is known for his pro-human rights, pro-ecology, and pro-consumer views and his opposition to big business. No sooner had he been sworn in at SEMARNAT than he took the side of Germ√°n Mart√≠nez C√°zares, Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) in his fight for workers' rights as opposed to the needs of the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SCHP). In December 2019 he pushed for a ban on Glyphosate-based herbicides. In June 2020 he came out in favor of nationalizing Mexico's lithium mines in Sonora, the largest in the world. He is an ally of Undersecretary of Prevention and Health Promotion, Hugo L√≥pez-Gatell Ram√≠rez in his opposition to sugary drinks and junk food. He has been a critic of the Maya Train on both human rights and environmental grounds, although he is not an outright opponent. He has supported the construction of the refinery in Dos Bocas, Veracruz sighting the need for energy independence. He supports the construction of the General Felipe √Ångeles International Airport in Santa Luc√≠a, State of Mexico. Victor Toledo's greatest controversy came after the release of a March 2020 audio recording in which he criticized AMLO's administration for a lack of direction. He criticized the Secretariat of Agriculture and Rural Development for its support of agribusiness, the Secretariat of the Interior for its support of construction of a brewery in an area susceptible to drought, and Alfonso Romo's general opposition to environmental concerns. AMLO announced his support for a ban on glyphosate- based herbicides on September 2, 2020, the same day that Toledo resigned from his position at SEMARNAT. Toledo's opposition to the use of glyphosates was the main reason he was pushed out of his post, and the government has had to provide protection since Toledo's home was attacked by pesticide advocates. Personal life V√≠ctor Manuel Toledo Manzur was born in Mexico City on October 18, 1945. After his 2019 appointment at the head of SEMARNAT, Toledo announced on Twitter that he is gay.

Early life and education Edgar Pick was born in Lugoj, Romania. After baccalaureate at the Coriolan Brediceanu High School in Lugoj, he enrolled at the Victor Babe»ô University of Medicine and Pharmacy. He completed his medical studies at the Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, graduating with an M.D. in 1965. He was a postdoctoral fellow in Experimental Pathology at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, from 1965-1967, training with Joseph D. Feldman. In 1967 he joined the laboratory of John L.Turk, who was the world leader of cell- mediated immunity studies. He received a Ph.D. from the University of London in 1970. While in London, Edgar Pick focused on the study of soluble products made by antigen-stimulated T lymphocytes, known as lymphokines and later, known as a form of cytokines, characterizing molecules known as \\"skin reactive factor\\" and \\"migration inhibitory factor\\". With John Turk, he published one of the first reviews on lymphokines. Career and research In October 1970, Edgar Pick was appointed Senior Lecturer of Immunology in the Department of Human Microbiology (now, Clinical Microbiology and Immunology), the Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University and rose to Professor in 1979. His research was now centered on the role of T cell-derived lymphokines in enhancing innate immunity by augmenting the capacity of phagocytes to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), in response to pathogenic microorganisms. He was the co-editor of the first book on lymphokines and the editor of the 15 volumes of the series Lymphokines. Pick is best known for his fundamental studies on the enzyme complex responsible for the generation of the primary ROS, superoxide, by phagocytes, known as the NADPH oxidase. He described with Yael Bromberg a novel method to activate the NADPH oxidase derived from resting phagocytes by unsaturated fatty acids and anionic amphiphiles,Bromberg, Y., and Pick, E. Activation of NADPH-dependent superoxide production in a cell-free system by sodium dodecyl sulfate. J. Biol. Chem. 260: 13539-13545, 1985. EID: 2-s2.0-0022340824 known as the \\"cell- free system\\". This approach represented a major paradigm shift and led to the discovery that phagocytes contain, in addition to the membrane component directly responsible for superoxide production (known as gp91phox or Nox2), cytosolic components, responsible for the formation of the active NADPH oxidase complex. This also led to the identification of previously unknown causes for an inherited disease, characterized by the inability of phagocytes to produce ROS, known as Chronic Granulomatous Disease, resulting in repeated infections. Edgar Pick (with D. Sha‚Äôag and T. Kroizman) had a leading role in the identification and characterization of the ‚Äúcytosolic components‚Äù of the NADPH oxidase and is best known for the finding (with A. Abo and A.W. Segal) that the small GTPase Rac is an essential participant in the activation of the NADPH oxidase.Abo, A., and Pick, E. Purification and characterization of a third cytosolic component of the superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase of macrophages. J. Biol. Chem. 266: 23577-23585, 1991. EID: 2-s2.0-0026325723 This discovery had wide-ranging implications for the understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of diseases caused by excessive production of ROS and for new applications of statin drugs. His other major contribution (with G. Joseph and I. Dahan) was introducing \\"peptide walking\\", as a method to identify functionally important regions in individual NADPH oxidase components and as a path to the discovery of peptide-based drugs for the treatment of diseases caused by excessive generation of ROS. Edgar Pick is also known for the pioneering design (with Y. Berdichevsky and A. Mizrahi) of the tripartite chimeras (\\"trimeras\\"), in which functionally important segments of the NADPH oxidase activating cytosolic components are fused in a single molecule and for studies (with E. Bechor and A. Zahavi) on the mechanism of interaction of p67phox with Nox2. Edgar Pick was the Incumbent of the Roberts-Guthman Chair in Immunopharmacology (1988-2008), Director of the J. F. Cohheim ‚Äì Minerva Center for Cellular and Molecular Phagocyte Research(1994-2008), Head of Sackler Institute of Molecular Medicine (1997-1998), and Head of Kodez Institute of Host Defense against Infectious Diseases (1999-2008).Julius Friedrich Cohnheim Minerva Center for Cellular and Molecular Phagocyte Research He is a member of the American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, American Association of Immunologists, Society for Leukocyte Biology, American Association for the Advancement of Science, and Israel Immunological Society.

Life  Botn in G≈Çog√≥w, Silesia, Weisbach came from a family of soldiers.Fred K. Prieberg: Handbuch Deutsche Musiker 1933-1945. CD-ROM- Lexikon, Kiel 2004, . Already from the age of seven he received piano as well as violin lessons and appeared as a pupil in various chamber music concerts. After his Abitur he studied violin at the Academic Academy of Music in Berlin, first with Joseph Joachim and Andreas Moser, then piano with Ernst Rudorff and Georg von Petersenn and finally conducting with Robert Hausmann. In addition, he took courses in philosophy and musicology. In 1908 Weisbach moved to Munich, where he worked as a trainee Kapellmeister at the court theatre there, now the Bavarian State Opera under Felix Mottl, and at the same time attended further lectures at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen. Three years later, he moved to Frankfurt, where he worked as a pianist and chamber musician at his own concert events and for the and was the second conductor of the \\"R√ºhlsche Oratorienverein\\". After a short episode in Worms, where he took over the direction of the Konzertgesellschaft in 1913, and in Wiesbaden as well as a break due to the war, he was elected municipal music director of the Philharmonisches Orchester in Hagen/Westphalia in 1919, where he conducted the world premiere of Paul Graener's Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (op. 72) with K√§the Heinemann as soloist in 1926. In Hagen, Weisbach was instrumental in the completion of the half-finished and damaged Stadthalle and of the first Hagen Music Festival in 1923. In addition to these activities, he directed the Barmen concert company from 1924. Finally in 1926, after several successful performances as a guest conductor, he was appointed to succeed Georg Schn√©evoigt as municipal general music director in D√ºsseldorf. His first major appearance with the and a demanding programme at the opening ceremony of the Great \\"Ausstellung f√ºr Gesundheitspflege, soziale F√ºrsorge und Leibes√ºbungen\\" (Exhibition for Health Care, Social Welfare and Physical Exercise) (GeSoLei) was a highly acclaimed success. In the following years he conducted the Lower Rhenish Music Festival as well as numerous premieres and first performances such as the Missa Symphonica for mixed choir, solos, orchestra and organ op. 36 and the Requiem by Lothar Windsperger, the Marianische Antiphon for solos, choir, organ and orchestra by Wolfgang Fortner and Die Weihe der Nacht by himself as premieres as well as Le Roi David by Arthur Honegger, the Stabat mater op. 53 by Karol Szymanowski and Hymnus by . With a last concert on 8/9 February 1933, Weisbach ended his activities in D√ºsseldorf and moved to Leipzig, where he took over the direction of the Leipzig Radio Symphony Orchestra, now the MDR Leipzig Radio Symphony Orchestra, until 1939. He then moved to Vienna during the war years. Here Weisbach conducted the Vienna Symphony until 1944, an orchestra in which there had been a disproportionately large number of party members and candidates for party membership since the Nazi seizure of power. Among other things, he was responsible for the so- called Kraft durch Freude oncerts, for appearances on Reichsrundfunk and for the performance of the major Vienna concert series, before the orchestra - already considerably reduced in personnel due to conscripts for military service - was closed down in August 1944. After he had undergone denazification proceedings - he had been a member of the NSDAP since 1937 - he was finally appointed municipal music director in Wuppertal in 1947, where his career ended. Throughout his life, Weisbach was considered an internationally renowned connoisseur and interpreter of the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, which he performed many times (among others with the London Symphony Orchestra). In recognition of his life's work and for his years of musical development in Hagen and Wuppertal, Hans Weisbach was awarded the and the Great Cross of Merit in 1955.

Background Ana Maria Lowndes Marques Vicente was born in Lisbon on 8 February 1943. She was the daughter of the English writer and journalist Susan Lowndes Marques and the Portuguese journalist Luiz de Oliveira Marques. On her mother's side she was a member of a distinguished line of authors and feminists. One great-grandmother was Bessie Rayner Parkes, a prominent British feminist and champion of women's suffrage. Another was Louise Swanton Belloc, a French writer and translator known for introducing important works of English literature to France and for promoting women's education. Her grandmother, Marie Belloc Lowndes, was a well-known writer of crime novels and biographies, best known for her novel, The Lodger, based on Jack the Ripper, which sold over a million copies and was made into a film by Alfred Hitchcock in 1926. Her great uncle was the poet and novelist Hilaire Belloc. Early life Vicente as born at the English hospital in Lisbon. She lived in Lisbon until 1947 when her parents moved to Monte Estoril. For a time, she attended Portuguese-language primary schools before transferring to the English-language St. Julian's School, at which her mother would become a member of the Board of Governors and her brother, Paulo Lowndes Marques, would serve as Chairman of the Annual General Meeting. She also had a younger sister, Antonia Marques Leit√£o. In her youth she was a member of Catholic Action and, being classified as a Portuguese member of the school, had to join the Mocidade Portuguesa Feminina, a youth movement established by the right-wing Estado Novo government. She also spent two years at a Catholic boarding school in England that had been one of those founded by the nun, Mary Ward (15851645), to provide an education to poor children. Vicente graduated from university with a degree in Religion, which qualified her to teach religion, and subsequently obtained a degree in Modern Languages and Portuguese and English Literature from the University of Lisbon. She was a founder-member of the Pragma Cooperative, a Catholic organization opposed to the Estado Novo, and in April 1967 was arrested by the PIDE (International and State Defence Police) and held for three days in Caxias prison near Lisbon. Pragma was subsequently dissolved. Working life Vicente was married to Ant√≥nio Pedro Vicente and was the mother of two children. Initially, she worked as a teacher and translator. After the Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974, which saw the overthrow of the Estado Novo, she became a civil servant, working in the offices of Maria de Lourdes Pintassilgo, Portugal's only female prime minister and a woman who, like Vicente, had a strong Catholic faith. She also worked for Leonor Beleza, who served as Minister of Health. Vicente was executive secretary of the Portuguese National Program to Combat Drugs, known as Project VIDA. She also worked at the Comiss√£o para a Igualdade e para os Direitos das Mulheres (Commission for Equality and for Women's Rights), of which she was the Director from 1992 to 1996. On a personal level, Vicente was involved with the international movement We are Church, which she was responsible for introducing to Portugal in 1997, together with Maria Jo√£o Sande Lemos. She carried out consultancy assignments on reproductive health in Portuguese-speaking African countries, together with Purifica√ß√£o Ara√∫jo, on behalf of the United Nations Population Fund. Vicente stopped working professionally in 1998, but continued to be active as a writer, authoring fifteen books on issues of gender, history, biography, and works for children. She also worked with several non-governmental organizations, including CID, a body that aimed to support Children, the Elderly and the Disabled in institutions. She was a member of the Citizenship Education Forum and a founding member of Novo Futuro, which provides residential homes for children between 5 and 21. She was also a member of Amnesty International and the Portuguese Association of Women's Studies. Ana Vicente died at her home in Estoril on 19 April 2015, at the age of 72, of cancer.

It is the first cinematographic adaptation of this tale. Review and link to watch the film: Plot The film is composed of seven scenes introduced by intertitles: 1\\\\. Open sesame! While gathering wood in the forest, Ali Baba, accompanied by his donkey, surprises a gang of thieves carrying their loot. He hides and overhears the magic spell that gives access to the cave where they pile up their treasures. 2\\\\. The thieves' treasure Once the thieves are gone, he enters the lair, takes a few bags of gold coins and runs back home. 3\\\\. Rich at last! Ali Baba comes back to his house where his wife is expecting him. She is overjoyed when she sees the gold. Cassim, Ali's brother, arrives at that moment and Ali Baba tells him how he got the gold. Cassim dashes off to the cave. 4\\\\. Cassim is discovered and executed In the cave Cassim is awed by the accumulated treasures but he suddenly hears the 40 thieves coming back. He hides behind a treasure chest while the thieves are celebrating their latest plunder with dancing girls but he is soon discovered. He pleads for his life, revealing that Ali Baba had given him the magic spell but the chief cuts off his head. 5\\\\. Brigands discovered by the maid Forty jars of oil are delivered in the courtyard of Ali Baba's new mansion. Ali Baba thanks the oil merchant and invites him to dinner. A maid enters and sees that thieves are hidden in the jars. She takes a jar of boiling oil and pours it into the forty jars. 6\\\\. The fake oil merchant In the dining room of Ali Baba's mansion, Ali Baba enters and sits down with his wife and the oil merchant (in fact the chief of the thieves). Dancing girls entertain the guests. Suddenly the maid enters and stabs the fake oil merchant in the heart. 7\\\\.

History  Children's Cancer Research Fund was founded by Diana and Norm Hageboeck in 1981 after their daughter died of leukemia. The organization officially registered as a 501(c)(3) charitable non-profit in February 1998. In 2013, the Zach Sobiech Osteosarcoma Fund was established to designate funding specifically for osteosarcoma research. It's administered by Children's Cancer Research Fund and donations fund research at the University of Minnesota. The fund honors Zach Sobiech, a musician who died of osteosarcoma in May 2013 at age 18. In 2020, Daniel Gumnit was hired as the Chief Executive Officer, replacing former CEO John Hallberg.  Events  The first fundraising event, \\"Dawn of a Dream\\", honored the Hageboeck's daughter, Katie, who died of leukemia. Since 1981, the Dawn of a Dream fundraiser has raised over $22 million for Children's Cancer Research Fund. In December of 2013, 5,000 people gathered in the rotunda at Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota as part of the first \\"Clouds Choir\\", an annual event that raises money for the Zach Sobiech Osteosarcoma Research Fund. During the event, participants pay tribute to Zach Sobiech while singing his hit song \\"Clouds\\". In 2019, 6,000 people attended the event, along with celebrities from the upcoming Clouds (2020 film): Justin Baldoni, Neve Campbell, Tom Everett Scott, Sabrina Carpenter, Madison Iseman and Fin Argus. In 2015, Great Cycle Challenge USA was launched to support Children's Cancer Research Fund. The event encourages participants to set a goal for riding their bike over the course of a month and to ask their family and friends to support them as they ride their bike to raise awareness for cancer research. Over the history of Great Cycle Challenge USA, more than 230,000 people have participated from all 50 states, raising more than $24 million for Children's Cancer Research Fund.  Research  Since its inception, Children's Cancer Research Fund has invested over $186 million to research and support programs. In 2014, money raised through the Zach Sobiech Osteosarcoma Fund helped support breakthrough research. With funding support from Children's Cancer Research Fund, the osteosarcoma research team at the University of Minnesota discovered Semaphorin-4D (SEMA4D), a gene associated with the cause of osteosarcoma.

She used several pseudonyms over the course of her career, including Angela Cypher for some of her lighter verse and Elijah Hay for poems she wrote as part of the Spectrist hoax. Family and Education Marjorie Allen was born in Moline, Illinois to Minnie Florence (Stephens) Allen, whose father was president of the Moline Plow Company, and Frank Gates Allen, a well-to-do businessman. She graduated from Smith College in 1906 and then returned to her hometown. In 1910, she married Otto Seiffert, and they had two children, son Allen and daughter Helen. She added her husband's family name of Seiffert to her own name. Career Seiffert began writing verse around 1915, with encouragement from her friend and fellow poet Arthur Davison Ficke. Over the course of her career, she published dozens of poems in The New Yorker, Others: A Magazine of the New Verse, Poetry, and other magazines. In 1919 she won Poetry's Levinson Prize for the best American poem of the year. By the early 1930s, she began to have trouble getting her work published. Around this time, she created a pseudonym, 'Angela Cypher', under which she wrote a form of light verse that gave her latitude for barbed observations about women's lives. She chose the name Cypher in part because it was a near homophone with her own last name. The Cypher poems were a hit with the editors of The New Yorker, which published around a dozen of them in the 1930s. Her work has since been anthologized in such volumes as William Roetzhelm's Giant Book of Poetry (2006). Her papers are held by the University of Colorado at Boulder Libraries. They include some unpublished short stories written under yet another pseudonym, 'Lucy Lockett'. Spectrism In 1916, Athur Davison Ficke and the poet Witter Bynner published Spectra: New Poems under the pseudonyms ‚ÄòAnne Knish‚Äô (Ficke) and ‚ÄòEmanuel Morgan‚Äô (Bynner) . They claimed these poems as experiments in a new style of poetry that they dubbed the Spectric School of Poetry, informally known as Spectrism. Their actual intent was to challenge the reigning aesthetic of Imagism by creating a fake poetry movement that the experts would take seriously. The sometimes nonsensical poems received a mixed reaction, and there was extensive speculation on the true authorship of the poetry. In the fall of 1916, a third Spectrist poet emerged, 'Elijah Hay', who was actually Seiffert writing under a pseudonym. She had been invited in on the hoax by Bynner and Ficke, who felt they needed to broaden the circle of poets producing in the Spectrist style. Under the male pseudonym, Seiffert wove satirical observations about women's lives into many of her Spectrist poems. It has been observed that her poems added \\"diversity and ingenuity\\" to the range of Spectric poetry. An entire issue of Others magazine was devoted to Spectrist poetry, including work by Hay/Seiffert such as the poem \\"Night\\". Spectrism came to an end in 1918 when Bynner confessed to being Morgan. In the aftermath, a number of critics who had earlier preferred Hay's verse to that of Morgan and Knish reversed their opinions on discovering the poet was a woman, and Hay/Seiffert's role in the Specra affair has generally been diminished in subsequent accounts.

He is considered a gifted author of Myanmar literature in the 20th century. He has written many historical fictions using his creative talent of writing with different views on history, novels based on the life of the Buddha, and a few contemporary novels. Lingadipa Chitthu is one of his prominent works, regarded as a popular classic in Myanmar. He made a number of literary speeches at different literary events home and abroad. Since 1999, he has served as an external examiner and advisor of the National University of Arts and Culture, Yangon and fellow of the university too. Life and career=Youth Chit Oo Nyo was born Kyaw Swar on 30 December 1947 in Mandalay, Myanmar, the oldest of the seven children, to parents U Shwe Daung Nyo and Daw Sein Yin. Called Kyaw Kyaw when young, he grew up with stories told by his grandma, Daw Aye Kyin, a headmistress at a primary school. When he learnt reading at school, he visited the school library and read story books. That was how he loved reading. He got a scholarship after 7th grade. When his grandparents asked him what he wanted, his reply was to buy the whole series of novels called \\"Detective U San Shar\\". Not only did they buy the novel series but also they then bought 12 volumes of \\"His Philosophy\\" by Sagaing U Phoe Thin. He once said in an interview that the love and passion for literature rooted in him thanks to the guidance and support of his family and the people around him and he became a civilized man. The works of Bhamaw Tin Aung, Mya Than Tint are said to have influenced him in his early life. He spent his young life studying at several schools in Mandalay. In 1962 he went to Mandalay University and moved to Yangon University to study Philosophy, which he graduated with honours of three subjects in 1968. Then he continued to study to earn a Master's degree. CareerAcademic career= He at first chose an academic career as a tutor serving at Workers' college (Yangon), Sittwe college and the Yangon Co-operative Central school from 1969 until 1974. Then he gave up his academic job and earned his living as a scriptwriter and director for Sandar Oo theatrical group, a traditional and cultural performance troupe. =Literary career= In 1977 he earned for a living as a writer. From 1983 to 1988 he worked as an editor for Thabin magazine (a theater magazine). From 1999 to 2000 he was an editor-in-chief at Shwepyitan Journal. A short story 'Yangon Downtown', for the first time, appeared in the October issue of Moewai magazine is the piece with which he is said to become an author. Later his works of novels, articles and translations appear in Moe Wai and Shumawa literary magazines. In the mid-1970s, he could write his debut and smash hit novel 'Lingadipa Chitthu' (Beloved of Lanka) (). The novel is a different version of the Ramayana epic, where he plotted the storyline in which he, unlike the original version, depicted Ravana as the protagonist. Afterwards he wrote many novels with historical background of Bagan, Innwa, Taunggoo, Hanthawaddy and Konbaung eras. Apart from the historical novels, he has also written many novels based on the life of the Buddha and several contemporary novels. He has been one of the few writers who deliver most literary speeches both at home and abroad like a few Asian countries for the Myanmar audience. In recent years, he participated in up to about 200 literary events by giving talks in a year. He established a publishing house named 'Lingadipa'. = Theatrical career = Shwe Daung Nyo, Chit Oo Nyo's father, was one of noted theatrical (or) stage performers and acted as a tutor for traditional male-dance when the school of arts and culture was first opened in 1952. Young Chit Oo Nyo did not learn from his father how to write dramas, play musical instruments systemically but he got familiar with the dialogues, songs, verses used in the field of the theatrical performance when time went by. He said that his father did teach him 'Baby Phoe Sein dance', a type of dance for a boy. Chan Tha, a prominent stage performer, said, \\"Chit Oo Nyo is, no doubt, interested in performing arts and his style of dancing implies that he is really crazy about Ramayana dance. His body and hand movements are as well much attractive.\\" He contributed to Myanmar traditional theatrical field by writing stage dramas, editing Thabin magazine (a theater magazine) from 1983 to 1988, scriptwriting and directing in a theatrical group. =Film career= Not only have some of his novels been adapted into films but also he has been acting as a scriptwriter and/or shooting manager for many films in the film industry. In the academy-award winning film Thu Kyun Ma Khan Bi (Never shall we be enslaved!) released in 1997, he did the screenplay of the film and was assigned as an art director and production designer as well. He was chose as one the scriptwriters for the upcoming film 'Aung San' that is expected to be screened in late 2020. Wu yue chuan qi or Musical Legend, the joint drama TV series between China and Myanmar, is based on a historical story of Pyu Era and the original script was written by Chit Oo Nyo. Lingadipa Chithu Lingadipa Chithu is the most well-known historical novel ever written by him and was first published in 1977. The novel is based on the Ramayana epic story, where Rama is the protagonist. From a different perspective on the main epic story, he wrote a novel of his own, where Ravana (Dassagiri) is the hero and protagonist of the novel. He also depicted Ravana as a dynamic and pitiable character. Chit Oo Nyo was only 29 when he wrote the book. The book was republished three times until 2015. The novel has been translated into English. Influences As a young person, Chit Oo Nyo read and admired many works by notable authors such as Sagaing U Phoe Thin, Mya Than Tint, Bhamaw Tin Aung and Thakhin Mya Than. And when he wrote historical fictions, he had to study many chronicles and essays by historians like Than Tun. Being a graduate in philosophy, he said his favorite subjects were the philosophy of history and aesthetics, which equally influenced his works very much. Honours In 2017, 'the Southeast Asian Writers Award' was bestowed on him. Strange to say, he has not got any Myanmar National Literature Award yet.

The nomination came nearly a month after WTO released a 125-page report stating that Saudi Arabia breached international law, as it was distributing pirated content via its pay-per-view service, beoutQ. On 17 August, 19 human rights organizations urged the member countries of WTO to reject Saudi Arabia‚Äôs nominee for the Director General‚Äôs post. The appeal stated that being a high- ranking official of Saudi government, Tuwaijri remained silent of the Kingdom‚Äôs repressive records and was complicit in the country‚Äôs human rights violations. On 7 October 2020, it was reported that Al-Tuwaijri failed to secure enough support to win the bid to become WTO‚Äôs Director General.

Water profile The hot mineral water emerges from the spring at 133¬∞F/56¬∞C, at the foot of granite cliffs called \\"Hell's Gates\\". It flows into half-a-dozen collecting pools at the edge of Crystal River, the largest of which is 20 feet in diameter by 2 feet deep. The primitive soaking pools are made from river stones, and are maintained between seasons by volunteers. Cold river water can be mixed with hot water by rearranging the rocks surrounding the soaking pools. History Local Native Americans originally used the springs for generations. The springs are named for Daniel Penny, a local hotelier who ran a historical bathhouse and small hotel and bathhouse near the Avalance Creek railroad line stop. In the 1960's skinny dippers began using the springs which the locals objected to, in protest they bulldozed the bathhouse. The spring was restored in the early 1990s, after the land was acquired by Pitkin County. During the COVID-19 crisis, the springs were closed and policed due to mass gatherings of bathers of over 10 individuals.

Background The United Kingdom has a long history of legislation designed to regulate rivers and their associated fisheries, and four issues have been consistently addressed in these laws. The issues are obstructions preventing the movement of fish along rivers, close times and seasons to ensure populations of fish continue to flourish, irregular netting, and the administrative structures necessary to implement any legislation. The first known edict was part of the Magna Carta in 1215, which included a clause concerning the removal of weirs from the River Thames and River Medway, to benefit both navigation and fisheries. In 1278, Edward I legislated that there should be a gap in weirs on the rivers Eden, Esk and Derwent, through which \\"a sow and her five little pigs can enter\\", and Edward IV made explicit provision for fisheries in 1432. Edward I's Statute of Westminster dating from 1285 enshrined the need for a close season during which salmon could not be removed from rivers, while Elizabeth I introduced a minimum size for caught salmon, which was set at . Edward III was the monarch who first introduced the concept of 'authorised' nets. The Statute of Westminster made provision for overseers to regulate fisheries, and Edward III allowed Justices of the Peace to employ under-conservators to police the rivers, but in reality there was little administrative support for ensuring the regulations were met until the passing of the Salmon Fishery Act 1865. Although formal recording of fish stocks prior to the 19th century was extremely patchy, there was a general perception that at the onset of the Industrial Revolution fish stocks were depleting, as a result of obstructions built across rivers, and over-zealous netting of fish is some rivers and estuaries. This led to the convening of a Parliamentary Select Committee in 1825, to consider the salmon fisheries of the United Kingdom. Its remit was to report on the state of the fisheries, and the legislation that affected them. They produced two reports, the first of which contained 13 recommendations. These included a national close season, and weekly close times; making the taking or selling of salmon or trout during the close season an offence; a requirement that mill owners should erect and maintain gratings where water was taken from a river; guarding against the release of toxic substances into watercourses; a prohibition on the use of lights to catch salmon; and the regulation of the size of mesh that could be used in nets. They further recommended that salmon fisheries should be able to appoint and pay water bailiffs, with rights of access; that the conviction of offenders should be relatively easy; and that all of their recommendations should be enshrined in a law covering England and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. The second report dealt with obstructions, which was more sensitive, given that most of the structures were servicing the manufacturing industry, which wielded a lot of power. No action was taken to address any of the issues raised by the Select Committee, and it was another 35 years before further progress was made. A Royal Commission was set up in 1860, with a remit ...to enquire into the Salmon Fisheries of England and Wales, with the view of increasing the supply of a valuable article of food for the benefit of the public... It found that the reasons for the decline of the fisheries were similar to those listed in 1825, notably, obstructions which prevented fish moving up and down the rivers, the use of fixed engines, pollution, illegal fishing, the defective regulation of close seasons, the lack of a management system for the rivers and fisheries, and a general confusion about what the law allowed. It made specific mention of the pollution of rivers cause by water emanating from mines, industrial effluent, and sewage. It also highlighted the need for a body to arbitrate between the antagonistic needs of industry and fisheries, but did not suggest what that should look like. This time, some action was taken, and the Salmon Fisheries Act 1861 addressed most of the issues, with the Home Office given responsibility for fisheries. Thirty-three previous Acts of Parliament were repealed, in order to remove uncertainty and confusion about what the legal position was, but no provision was made to create or fund local management of the fisheries. The major recommendations of the Royal Commission were gradually implemented by a series of supplementary Acts. The first was the Salmon Fishery Act 1865, which allowed Boards of Conservators to be set up, with powers to manage rivers or river systems as defined by the Secretary of State. The Boards could also represent fishery interests, and the first steps towards funding were provided by the introduction of fishing licences. The Salmon Fishery Act 1873 gave additional powers to Fishery Boards and altered the way they were constituted. The Freshwater Fisheries Act 1878 extended the concept of Fishery Boards to coarse fisheries, where rivers contained trout or char, but not salmon. Similarly, licences were required to catch these two types of fish, but not for other freshwater fish, and a close season for freshwater fish was introduced, lasting from 15 March to 15 June. The Freshwater Fisheries Act 1884 further extended the reach of Fishery Boards, to cover rivers that only contained freshwater fish, but no game fish, and allowed them to pass byelaws covering the size of freshwater fish that could be taken, and the methods by which they could be caught. Licence fees for freshwater fishing were introduced by the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1907. The 1923 Act By 1923, the situation was similar to that which had been addressed by the 1861 Act, in that fishery legislation was covered by that Act and 18 more which had been passed subsequently. The Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1923 therefore sought to remove confusion by consolidating all of the fishery legislation into a single Act. It again altered the constitution of Fishery Boards, allowing representatives from county councils and rod licence-holders to be appointed as members, in addition to those who were already represented on the Boards. It also harmonised the law in respect of game fish such as salmon and trout, and other freshwater fish. When the bill was presented to Parliament, Sir Robert Sanders, the Minister for Agriculture, described the changes that it would bring in very colourful language. > One more difference this Bill makes in the law. It is a step in the > direction of democracy among fish. Formerly, law gave precedence to the > aristocratic fish like the salmon and the trout. Now, also it takes care of > the bourgeois carp or the plebian roach or any other humble citizen of the > river, even a member of the criminal classes like the pike, and it does not > insult them by calling them 'coarse fish', a name by which they are often > known; it speaks of them here as 'freshwater fish', and for the first time > their rights are recognised. They get some of the protection that was > formerly lavished only on their smart and fashionable compatriots.

The brickworks, founded by Atlanta mayor James W. English in 1878, is notable for its extensive use of convict lease labor, wherein hundreds of African American convicts worked in conditions similar to those experienced during antebellum slavery. It is speculated that some workers who died at the brickworks were buried on its grounds. The brickworks was discussed in Douglas A. Blackmon's Pulitzer Prize- winning book Slavery by Another Name, released in 2008. The property ceased to be an active brickworks in 2011.  History  The brickworks company was founded in 1878 and located on the east bank of the Chattahoochee River in northwest Atlanta. From the company's founding, it employed convicts via the convict lease system. By 1886, James W. English would become the company's majority shareholder. Following this, English restructured another company he owned, Penitentiary Company No. 3, and was able to re-lease the convicts leased to that company to the Chattahoochee Brick Company. That same year, the Bureau of Labor issued a report that the brickmaking industry in Georgia, which had previously employed \\"about 600 hands\\", had been greatly impacted by convict leasing, with 30% of the state's brick production relying on convict leasing and many brickmakers saying they had to use the system to stay competitive with Chattahoochee Brick Company. By the 1890s, Chattahoochee Brick Company managed over 1,200 leased convicts, with about 150 working at the brickworks and the rest leased to other companies throughout the state. At the peak of the company's production, the site averaged about 175 workers per month, with an output of about 200,000 bricks per day. According to writer and journalist Douglas A. Blackmon, hundreds of millions of bricks produced at the brickworks are still in use in structures today. In 1908, the government of Georgia outlawed the convict lease system, with the official end to the system occurring on March 31 of the next year. While company officials were initially concerned that the company would shut down due to the increased cost of labor, the plant continued producing bricks. However, the year after the convict lease system ended, the company reported a near-50% drop in annual brick production, with a significant increase in production costs as well. The Chattahoochee Brick Company would continue to operate at this site until the 1970s or 1980s, when it closed and another brickworks company began to operate at the site. In 2011, the site was razed. In 2008, Blackmon released the book Slavery by Another Name, which discussed the convict lease system in the Southern United States and talked about the Chattahoochee Brick Company in this regard. The book was later adapted to a PBS documentary of the same name. Speaking of the site, Blackmon stated ‚ÄúThis is not just a factory where people were treated badly. It‚Äôs a place where people were worked to death and buried in unmarked graves.‚Äù Both Blackmon and others speculate that workers who died working at the brickworks were probably buried on the site. The site was described in a 2018 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution as \\"the Black Auschwitz of Georgia.\\" Following the brickworks closing in 2011, the nonprofit group The Trust for Public Land attempted to buy the land and convert it to a public park, but this did not come to fruition. In 2016, South Carolina-based Lincoln Energy Solutions attempted to buy the property and build a shipping facility, though this generated controversy among preservationists.

It was located in Chicago, Illinois at 5009 South Hermitage Avenue. Built in 1913, Sts. Cyril and Methodius served a Bohemian congregation for decades until archdiocesan budget cuts in 1990 led to the church being closed.  History  A view of Sts. Cyril and Methodius from across the street.  Founding  Sts. Cyril and Methodius Church was built in 1913 in order to serve a Bohemian congregation.  Decline  When Reverend Charles J. Kouba arrived at Sts. Cyril and Methodius in 1971 as its new pastor, the parish consisted of 900 families, and five masses were offered on weekends. By 1990, the parish had been reduced to 150 families, and the weekend masses, which were condensed into only two services, saw an average of about 100 attendees. During the week of January 14‚Äì20 in 1990, the congregation contributed only $543 to the collection basket, which was barely enough to pay the church building's $2,000 monthly utility bills. = Closure = In 1990, the Archdiocese of Chicago closed multiple parishes as part of a controversial budget cut that attempted to reduce the archdiocesan debt. During a meeting on Saturday, January 20, 1990, Reverend Kouba, long-time parish pastor for almost 19 years, told a group of 35 parishioners that the church would close on June 30 of the same year. After the church closed, Kouba became an associate pastor at the nearby St. Joseph Church, which, along with Holy Cross, Immaculate Heart of Mary, and Saint Michael Archangel, is and remains one of the four churches in the neighborhood.  Architecture  The architect Joseph Molitor, himself a Bohemian-born American, designed Sts. Cyril and Methodius in the Renaissance Revival style. The building was originally constructed in 1913, and the church grounds included a convent. Due to the changes ushered in by the Second Vatican Council, the interior of the church building saw several renovations and a simpler design. Marlite (plastic wall paneling made to resemble marble in appearance) was used to simplify the walls, though the building retained its original stained glass windows, which were created by the Munich Studio in Chicago.

History Until the 19th-century, what is now Parliament Street was covered with buildings, facing onto Pavement, Jubbergate, and St Sampson's Square. The markets in Pavement and St Sampson's Square had become increasingly crowded, and after considering the possibilities of enlarging them, or establishing a new market on various potential sites, the city corporation decided to construct a broad street linking the two, which would become a new marketplace. In 1833, the city obtained an Act of Parliament permitting the setting up of a new market, and held a competition for the best design. The surveyors Pickersgill and Oates took the ¬£30 top prize. In February 1834, the city began demolishing the buildings on the site, and from 1835 to 1840 laid out the new road, which was named \\"Parliament Street\\", constructing large buildings on each site of the street. These are mostly of four stories, and were built with shops on the ground floor, and living quarters above. All the buildings have since been converted to have offices above, and some blocks have been entirely rebuilt. The Parliament Street Market opened in 1836, running every day, but with Saturday as the principal market day. It was the city's main market until 1955, when it completed a move to what is now the Shambles Market. In 1989, a competition was held to redesign the street, and this led to it being largely pedestrianised, with a single carriageway on one side. A variety of High Street shops now line the street, including a large branch of Marks and Spencers, and it is also used to host a variety of festivals and temporary markets. Layout and architecture The northern end of the street is at St Sampson's Square, and it runs south to the junction of Pavement, Piccadilly, High Ousegate and Coppergate. In the middle, the surviving part of Jubbergate leads east to the Shambles Market, while Market Street leads off to the west. The York City and County Bank was one of the grandest original buildings on the street, but was demolished in 1971. Most of the buildings on the street are listed: the Barclays Bank, built in 1901, 8 and 9 Parliament Street, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, and 19 to 21 Parliament Street on the west side, and 22, 23 and 24, 29 and 30, 31 and 32, 33, 34, 35 and 36, 37, 38, 39, 44, and 45 and 46 Parliament Street on the east side. A fountain was located in the middle of the street, but it was removed in 2018 after it was deemed to be beyond repair.

C&O; Canal) that operated in the United States along the Potomac River from the 1830s through 1923. They are located at towpath mile-marker 22.7 adjacent to Seneca Creek, in Montgomery County, Maryland. The lock is sometimes identified as Seneca because of the Seneca Aqueduct that carried the canal over the creek to the lift lock. The name Riley comes from John C. Riley, who was lock keeper from 1892 until the canal closed permanently in 1924. The lock, lock house, and aqueduct attached to the lock were built in the early 1830s. Construction of Aqueduct 1 and other aqueducts further upriver took longer than other downriver portions of the canal, causing the first phase of canal operation to be between Georgetown and Lock 23\\\\. Construction of the entire canal was completed in 1850, and connected Hagerstown in Western Maryland with Georgetown on the Potomac River. The canal was necessary because portions of the Potomac River upstream from Georgetown were not navigable. Today, Riley's Lock is part of Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. The site is the only place on the canal that has a lift lock connected to an aqueduct. Picnic tables, restrooms, parking, and a canoe ramp are on site. Ruins of the Seneca Stone Cutting Mill are less than away. The lock and surrounding area are known as excellent places for bird watching, and the 40-acre (16 ha) Dierssen Waterfowl Sanctuary is about away. Background alt=rocky waterfallalt=picture of a boat on a canalGround was broken for construction of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (a.k.a. C&O; Canal) on July 4, 1828. One of the early plans was for the canal to be a way to connect the Chesapeake Bay with the Ohio River‚Äîhence the name Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. The canal has several types of locks, including 74 lift locks necessary to handle a 608-foot (185 m) difference in elevation between the two ends of the canal‚Äîan average of about 8 feet (2.4 m) per lock. The canal also has 11 aqueducts, and the Seneca Aqueduct at the Lock 24 location is the first aqueduct when traveling up the canal. From Georgetown to Harpers Ferry (includes Lock 24, Riley's Lock), the canal is wide at the surface, and at the bottom. Including walls, lift locks are long and wide‚Äîusable lockage was closer to long and wide. Some canal boats could carry over 110 tons (99.79 metric tons) of coal. Portions of the canal (close to Georgetown) began operating in the early 1830s, and construction ended in 1850 without reaching the intended Ohio River termination. Upon completion, the canal ran from Georgetown to Cumberland, Maryland. The canal was necessary since portions of the Potomac River, especially at Great Falls, could not serve for reliable navigation because the river can be shallow and rocky as well as subject to low water and floods. The canal opened the region to important markets and lowered shipping costs. By 1859, about 83 canal boats per week were transporting coal, grain, flour, and farm products to Washington and Georgetown. Tonnage peaked in 1871 as coal trade increased. The canal faced competition from other modes of transportation, especially the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O; Railroad). Starting in Baltimore and adding line westward, the B&O; Railroad eventually reached the Ohio River and beyond, while the C&O; Canal never went beyond Cumberland in Western Maryland. An economic depression during the mid-1870s, and major floods in 1877 and 1886, put a financial strain on the C&O; Canal Company. In 1889, another flood produced an estimated $1 million () in damages and caused the company to enter bankruptcy. Operations stopped for about two years. Court-appointed trustees recommended by the B&O; Railroad took over receivership of the canal and began operating it under court supervision, but canal use never recovered to the peak years of the 1870s. The C&O; Canal closed for the season in November 1923. Severe flooding in 1924 prevented the canal from opening in the spring, and the resulting damage from the floods prevented it from opening during the entire year. The flood damage, combined with continued competition from railroads and trucks, caused the shutdown to be permanent. In 1938, the canal was sold to the United States government, and the canal was proclaimed a national monument in 1961. History alt=old mapalt=old boat in aqueduct over creekWork on Lock 24 began in March 1829 and was completed March 1832 at a cost of $8,886.88 (). The lock was made from Seneca Creek Red Sandstone boated down the Potomac River from the Seneca Quarry. Construction of the lock house began in November 1829, and was finished April 1830 at a cost of $1,066.25 (). By June 1832, a 22-mile (35 km) section of the canal was operating between Georgetown and Lock 23. The Seneca Aqueduct, Aqueduct No. 1, was completed April 1832 at a cost of $24,340.25 (). The next two aqueducts upriver, No. 2 and No. 3, were completed in May 1833 and February 1834, respectively. It was not until 1833 that a dam at Harpers Ferry was completed and enabled the canal to operate above Lock 23. Riley's Lock is unique because it has a combination of an aqueduct and lift lock. The Seneca Aqueduct carries canal boats over Seneca Creek directly to the lift lock. Some C&O; Canal records remain, allowing some of the lock keepers to be identified. Charles H. Shanks was listed as lock keeper on July 1, 1839. He was still listed as lock keeper on May 31, 1842. John Wells was lock keeper on May 31, 1845, and was still lock keeper at the end of 1850. Charles Wood is listed as Lock 24 tender circa 1865. An 1865 map of Montgomery County, Maryland, confirms Wood as the lock keeper by showing \\"Chas. Wood L.K.\\" (lock keeper) at a point on the canal near Seneca Creek. The map also shows a \\"J.W. Darby's\\" near the creek and canal, and John Darby and Son (Upton) were known to have a lease for a nearby warehouse granted in 1871. Civil war At the beginning of the American Civil War, Union Army leadership realized that the Potomac River area near Locks 23 and 24 was a possible crossing point for a Confederate invasion that could include Washington. The small community of Darnestown, less than north of Lock 24, became occupied during 1861 by 18,000 Union troops. About half way between Lock 24 and Darnestown, General Nathaniel P. Banks kept his headquarters at the Samuel Thomas Macgruder farm where the Potomac River could be observed from high ground. On June 27, 1863, 5,000 cavalry troops under the command of Confederate General Jeb Stuart crossed the Potomac River near Lock 24\\\\. Intent on disrupting Union supply lines, they seized the canal between Locks 23 and 24, and damaged lock gates, drained water from the canal, and burnt canal boats. From there, they advanced to Rockville, Maryland, before rejoining General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia in the Battle of Gettysburg. Riley family alt=aqueduct over creek and lock housealt=gravestoneWilliam H. Riley came to America from Ireland around 1849, and found work at the Seneca quarry. By 1880 he was working on the C&O; Canal, as was his oldest son, John C. Riley. John married in 1890 and began working at the same quarry where his father worked years earlier. During 1892, the quarry shut down, but John was able to replace William Benson as lock tender for Lock 24. The family lived in the lock house until 1905 when a young daughter drowned in the canal. After the tragedy, John's wife Roberta and the children moved up the hill (at River Road) while John stayed at the lock house. Family members would visit the lock house daily, but at night time were always back to the safety of the house on the hill. Riley would sometimes rent the extra lock house rooms to campers. In November after the canal closed for the season, he would live with the family at the house on the hill until the canal reopened in March. The canal was closed permanently in 1924, but Riley continued working near the lock. The 1930 U.S. Census lists Riley as a canal watchman, and the family had a boat rental business that lasted until the 1940s. At the age of 69, John Riley died suddenly at his home on April 11, 1931, and was buried at the Darnestown Presbyterian Church cemetery. Today, Lock 24 is known as Riley's Lock in honor of John Riley and the Riley family, and the road that leads to the lock is named Rileys Lock Road (without the apostrophe). Today alt=canal lock and lock houseRiley's Lock and lock house are part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. Congress authorized the establishment of the park, and acquisition of adjacent land, in 1971. A Riley‚Äôs Lockhouse History Program is run by local Girl Scouts through a special permit from the park. On weekends in the spring and fall, Girl Scouts give tours of the lock house during the afternoons. Riley's Lock is also part of the Seneca Historic District listed in the National Register of Historic Places along with the Seneca Stone Cutting Mill, Seneca Quarry, and other nearby places. The ruins of the Seneca Stone Cutting Mill are only west of the lock. The Maryland Ornithological Society lists the lock as one of the top birdwatching places in Montgomery County, with over 200 species sited. In addition, the 40‚Äìacre (16 ha) Dierssen Waterfowl Sanctuary is not far away at towpath marker 20.0. Although considered part of the tiny community of Seneca, the lock now has a Poolesville address and is found on the edge of the Travilah census-designated place by taking Rileys Lock Road off of Montgomery County's River Road.

Exercise Ardent was a massive military exercise carried out by the Royal Air Force (RAF) over the United Kingdom in 1952. It pitted Bomber Command against a combined defensive force from Fighter Command, Fleet Air Arm, several squadrons of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and additional units from the USAF and various European NATO allies. Additionally, various British Army and Territorial Army anti-aircraft forces were included, along with the Royal Observer Corps and their RAF liaisons. Over 200,000 members of the various armed forces were involved in total, with around 1,300 aircraft flying over 7,500 sorties. It was the largest air exercise held since World War II, besting even the multinational Operation Sky Shield of the early 1960s. The exercise ran in several phases from 3 to 12 October. In most raids, Avro Lincoln and Boeing Washington bombers formed the majority of the attacking force, simulating Soviet Tupolev Tu-4 bombers, while English Electric Canberras and de Havilland Mosquitos were used in a variety of supporting roles during the mock attacks. In some of the operations, fighters from continental bases were used to simulate additional attackers. Defending forces included Gloster Meteor and de Havilland Vampire day and night fighters, RCAF Canadair Sabres and USAF F-86s. The outcome was not encouraging. At night, interception rates were no better than they had been during the war in spite of the dramatic performance improvements of the fighters. Worryingly, it was repeatedly found that once the bombers crossed the coastline they became difficult to track and could roam around the countryside without problem. Matters were much better by day, when the fighters could hunt down the bombers on their own after being given initial information about the approach directions. Even then, the Canberra proved extremely difficult to intercept, and those few interceptions that did occur were entirely by luck. The main issue causing these problems was the speed of the ground controlled interception system that tracked the bombers and vectored the fighters. This was accomplished as it had been during the war, with dozens of WAAFs moving wooden markers around large maps. This led to demands to upgrade the ROTOR radar network with the installation of the AMES Type 80 radars that performed all of these operations from a single large radar display. By the mid-1950s, the Type 80s had replaced the earlier Chain Home and AMES Type 7 of ROTOR, greatly improving interception capability. Preparing for Ardent The first major post-war UK air exercise was carried out in 1950 as Exercise Emperor. At the time, the defensive system was largely identical to its state at the end of World War II, with Chain Home radars operating for early warning and, in theory at least, AMES Type 7 radars providing detailed tracking, especially at night. ROTOR intended to greatly improve its effectiveness by networking the system together with extensive telecommunications systems and updated plotting, but this was in its infancy and would not be available in its complete form for several more years. Day fighters were a mix of jet and piston powered, while night fighters consisted entirely of late-model de Havilland Mosquitos. By the time of Ardent, jet powered fighters of greatly improved capability had entirely replaced piston fighters for day service, and a new generation of jet-powered night fighters had been introduced as well. Additionally, a number of war-era radars had been replaced with microwave-frequency systems that were immune to radar jamming. The single experimental Green Garlic radar was also available for Ardent, the first example of what became the AMES Type 80, offering well over double the range of existing radars and complete 360 degree coverage. Together, these changes represented a significant improvement in defensive capability. Major events=3/4 October Ardent opened on the night of 3 October with two groups of eight Avro Lincoln bombers each simulating mine-dropping raids on the Firth of Forth and the shipping channel in Great Yarmouth. These raids were countered by Meteor NF.11s. This was followed by a larger group of about 70 bombers, both Lincolns and Boeing Washingtons, simulating simultaneous radar-guided night bombing raids on Glasgow, Grangemouth and Edinburgh. Night fighters were hampered by poor weather at their bases, leaving the bombers largely unmolested. Still flying by dawn of the 4th, the bombers continued on to attack Liverpool. This was aided by two Mosquitos carrying jammers that approached from the south in order to draw off the fighters. This attempt did not work, instead it indicated that there were aircraft approaching Liverpool and aided the radar operators who were now highly focused on their displays and noticed the main force of bombers immediately as it entered range. This allowed a total of 120 interceptions to be carried out. During the day, a separate force of nine English Electric Canberras attacked Birmingham. According to Bomber Command records, two of these were successfully intercepted, while Fighter Command only records one interception made by a pair of the brand-new de Havilland Venoms from the test group at the Central Fighter Establishment at RAF West Raynham. In the morning, a group of USAF Boeing B-50s attacked London while RAF fighters flying from European airfields simulating fighter-bombers attacked Fighter Command airfields in the easternmost parts of England. 4/5 October The second day of Ardent included a mass raid by 70 aircraft simulating an attack on Glasgow and then continuing on to drop live ammunition on the Redesdale tank range southwest of Berwick-upon-Tweed. During the second half of the attack, Lincolns and Mosquitos dropped target markers while the two Mosquito jammer aircraft operated nearby. This time a \\"highly confused situation\\" developed in the plotting rooms, and a number of fighters were sent after a non-existent raid, so only 40 interceptions were carried out against the main force. The bombers went on to make a mock raid on York while most of the fighters had to return to their bases to refuel after being sent off on the wild goose chase. During the day on the 5th, a group of USAF Republic F-84 Thunderjets and RAF Vampires attacked airfields while B-50s attacked Glasgow, Liverpool and London. The raid on London resulted in \\"all the Meteors from Biggin Hill took part in the defence ‚Äî quite in the best Battle of Britain style.\\" Meanwhile, 100 paratroopers were dropped by Handley Page Hastings aircraft from Transport Command simulating an attack on RAF Patrington while Royal Netherlands Air Force F-84s made a low-level attack on Fighter Command headquarters at RAF Bentley Priory. The later raid was met by Meteors and Canadian Sabres. Sortie rates during this initial phase of Ardent included an average of 450 attacks during the day and another 200 at night, rates that were comparable to those during the Battle of Britain. 9 October The second major phase of Ardent opened on the night of 9 October, consisting of seven large bomber formations attacking various cities. The raids were timed so that many of them would arrive in the Sheffield area at the same time so they would overwhelm the controllers on the ground. Mosquitos and Lincolns with very high frequency jammers attacked the radio systems used to guide the fighters. On top of this, Canberras made a high-speed attack on Bristol while Belgian Air Force Mosquito NF.30 night fighters performed intruder missions over RAF night fighter airfields. 11/12 October The final missions of Ardent started on 11 October, with Canberras flying high-level day attacks on Glasgow, Carlisle, Liverpool and Cardiff. At night, the Lincolns and Washingtons flew simulated atomic bomb attacks against Bristol, Birmingham and London, approaching across a wide front while the Canberras attacked performed a high-level raid on London. The next day, 120 of the Lincolns and Washingtons, with jammers aiding, performed attacks on the fighter airfields at West Raynham and Coltishall in the east, and West Malling and Tangmere in the south. While fighters were tied up with these raids, a single Washington performed a low- level attack on the Tilbury Docks and a single Canberra attacked the Ford plant in Dagenham. Other Canberras flew high-level day strikes against Liverpool and Bristol. To top it off, another paratroop landing was performed against RAF Neatishead joined by USAF B-50s, F-84s of the Belgian, Dutch, French and US air forces, and Fleet Air Arm attacks against Royal Navy ships. Outcomes=Bomber Command conclusions The English Electric Canberra was immune to interception at night, and was only intercepted by day when fighters just happened to fly near them. Bomber Command suggested that the defence was largely useless against jet-powered bombers. Bomber Command was critical of the exercise, mostly due to the unrealistic limits placed on their operations. In particular, the aircraft were mostly banned from flying at altitudes between 3,000 and 11,000 feet, and the Canberras were limited to only 35,000 feet so the fighters could reach them. Had they been allowed to operate at their most effective altitudes, they would have likely never been intercepted. The interceptions of Canberras invariably occurred when a fighter just happened to spot them and were then ordered to attack after reporting the sighting. They noted that the \\"percentage of lethal attacks was probably extremely small,\\" and that the night fighters had \\"absolutely no success\\" against them. They concluded that the \\"salient points which emerged from the day and night operations of the Canberras was their complete immunity by night and large measure of immunity, at operational height, by day.\\" The use of Lincolns and Washingtons, both considered obsolete by this time, was another issue for Bomber Command. In the second daytime raid, every single bomber reported having been intercepted. They concluded that it would be \\"extremely difficult for Bomber Command to devise any tactics which would reduce these losses within acceptable limits.\\" At night, these aircraft did much better. Notably, the \\"use of a broad front and low-density raid again embarrassed the defence‚Ä¶ these obsolete medium bombers wandered all over the country for hours on end with almost complete immunity from fighter attack once the coast had been crossed.\\" They also noted that the Washingtons suffered more nighttime interceptions than the Lincolns, which they concluded was largely due to their much larger radar cross section, and the lack of flame dampers on the engines - unlike the Lincolns, they had not been designed as night bombers. Overall, however, the exercise demonstrated what they already assumed; the older bombers were no match for the new generation of fighters, and that the successful defensive operations against these aircraft would be \\"highly misleading\\" in terms of indicating whether Fighter Command could be effective. They noted that \\"Despite the improvements to the defence organization, and in particular the use of jet fighters, the interception rate showed no improvement over that achieved by the former Mosquito fighters. The total number of interceptions made by fighters was larger but this was simply because there were more fighters.\\" They noted that the low performance might be due to the limited endurance of the jets, which limited them to about two interceptions per sortie, while the Mosquitos were known to make many interceptions in a single mission. Ultimately the main learning opportunity for Bomber Command was the effective use of jamming. In particular, they learned that the trick to use against jet-powered aircraft was not to attempt to draw the fighters away from the bombers, as had been the case in WWII, because the jet fighters could quickly catch the bombers when they appeared. Instead, the jammers should be used to draw the fighters into the air in advance of the bomber's arrival, timing it so the fighters would run out of fuel and return to base just as the bombers appeared. Fighter Command conclusions Fighter Command published a series of reports on Ardent that put a somewhat more positive spin on the events, but ultimately also identified a number of major issues. On the topic of the Canberras, they noted that \\"Out of 23 interception attempts under GCI control only 11 resulted in sightings. The majority of the failures were due to late scramble action. The exercise showed that speedier control action is absolutely essential if interceptions are to be effected before the bombers attack their targets.\\" A notable outcome was the fact that all of the day fighters had roughly the same success rate against the Canberras, around 50 to 60%. This was true of both the swept-wing Sabres as well as the older generation straight-wing Meteors. The only aircraft to produce a notably worse showing were the Vampires, but this was accounted for by noting that these aircraft were based \\"outside the Metropolitan and Eastern Sectors where the bulk of the simulated jet bomber activity took place\\" and were thus flying greater distances. In contrast, their conclusions on the night fighters were decidedly less impressive. \\"There has been no sensible change in the effectiveness per fighter sortie due largely to the shortcomings of the control, and the slow bomber speeds masking the effects of the higher performance of the night fighters.\\" They also noted that the entire system was largely incapable of dealing with shallow penetrations into the mainland, with those under suffering little. This demanded more early warning time. Report to Churchill Winston Churchill had been invited to watch the operations, in keeping with his role as No 615 Squadron's honorary Air commodore. Unable to attend, he instead had Secretary of State for Air William Sidney, 1st Viscount De L'Isle attend in his place and make a report of his own. Sidney's report was similar to that of Bomber Command. He suggested that the system as implemented would be adequate to deal with Soviet piston bombers, but that \\"Against jet bombers of the Canberra type, which now form part of the Russian bomber force the present defences are much less effective, and until the improvements listed above are well advanced we are very vulnerable.\\" He noted that the system as a whole \\"showed a welcome improvement in the efficiency of the air defences; the interception rate against conventional bombers was most impressive. It has, however, emphasised once again the need to press ahead with current developments.\\" This included the upgrading of almost every aspect of the system; new fighters like the Hawker Hunter and Supermarine Swift by day and Gloster Javelin at night, air- to-air missiles to improve their deadliness, the fully operational command and control system envisioned by ROTOR and various radio and radar countermeasures. \\"All these matters are in hand but on present form it will be 1955 before we can hope to see the full results.\\" His conclusions, however, were somewhat different: \\"The problem of an adequate interception and kill rate is largely one of numbers. We shall never have enough modern fighters to get a sufficiently high rate, when atom bombs are included in the attack, unless we can do something to reduce the attack at its source ‚Äî i.e. the bases in Russia. This task, for which the smaller atom bomb is specially suitable, is among the first priority for the bomber force, of which the development must proceed in step with the fighter defences.\\" ROTOR upgrades Ardent took place before the new Type 80 radars had started installations, and so the ROTOR network controlling the operation had its mix of the original Chain Home and other wartime radars. The single experimental Type 80, still known as Green Garlic at the time, was used in the operation. According to Fighter Command, \\"the trial set at TEE gave outstanding results during the exercize.\\" The problems with interception plotting being carried out manually had long been understood to be a significant issue. Plans were underway to replace this system when the new radars were installed. A new system developed by the TRE took the intermediate signal being set to the radar station's displays, the \\"video\\" signal, and encoded that into a amplitude modulated signal on a microwave relay. This allowed the image from the radar screen to be sent to a remote location, where it could be combined with similar feeds from other stations and thereby allow the ROTOR operations rooms to have a single unified view of the complete battle without having any manual plotting. While there were high hopes for the combined displays, it ultimately was never used in this form due to improvements in the radars themselves. The first production model Type 80 Mark I started installation in 1953 and was handed over to an operational squadron in 1955. During the period from Ardent to the Mark I systems going into service, magnetron design was improving rapidly. An upgraded magnetron was used in the newer Type 80 Mark III, giving it over double the power of the original Mark I. This so greatly increased their effective range, up to against a large bomber like the Tu-4, that a single Mark III site could control the airspace formerly assigned to several different radars. In areas where more coverage was needed, the remote radars were to be netted to one of the Mark III's set up as a Master Radar Station (MRS). The original ROTOR network of 60 radars was cut in half, with a small number of MRS handling both the early warning task and ground controlled interception directly from their screens. Many of the centralized ROTOR operations rooms, only recently completed, were sold off. One outcome of Ardent that did direct effect the Type 80 was the realization that the lack of coverage over northern Scotland allowed the bombers to escape detection and then roam freely along the west. This was particularly problematic for the Navy, who were concerned that long-range bombers could use this route to lay mines in the western ports. As a result, a new seventh air defence sector was added in Inverness, with additional radars in the Shetland Islands and in Northern Ireland.

It displays striking similarities with the Monastery of Guadalupe, both sharing the same Gothic‚ÄìMud√©jar style. The attached cloister was built by 1469. A number of chapels, either in gothic or Renaissance style, were built in the 15th and 16th centuries. The works in the fa√ßade ended in 1783. It endured a sacking during the French invasion in the context of the Peninsular War. The temple lost the status of collegiate church in 1851.

The company originally manufactured furniture since the 1980s, and established itself as a rifle stock manufacturer in 2011 during the financial crisis. In 2015, GRS Riflestocks was awarded as the company of the year by Innovation Norway.GRS Riflestocks blei √Örets gr√ºnder ‚Äì NRK Vestland  History  The company was started in 1983 as a furniture factory under the name Grod√•s M√∏bler AS by Anne-Lise and Oddvin Haugen.About GRS Riflestocks In the beginning the furniture was manufactured in their own house, but in 1985 the production was moved to their own factory premises. During the 1990s, much of the manufacturing was automated using CNC- machines. During the 2000s, their two sons H√•vard and Oscar Haugen took over the company. During the 2008 financial crisis the company struggled, and it was decided that the company wanted to start manufacturing rifle stocks to gain access to a new market. In 2011, GRS launched their first rifle stocks. As of 2020, the company has over 20 employees, and is represented by distributors in over 45 countries.  Rifle stock models  A Savage bolt action rifle with a GRS stock used for long range shooting. In 2011, GRS launched its first ergonomic laminate stock. Different laminate stock models includes Hunter, Sporter, Hybrid, Varmint and Decima, which have some minor differences in regards to length and shape. All laminate stocks have an adjustable cheekrest and length of pull which GRS calls \\"speed lock\\". GRS laminate stocks have been offered with inlets for many different firearm models, as well as in blanks for other models which require inletting by a gunsmith. Inletted stocks have for instance been provided for the Tikka T3 model. In 2014, the Bolthorn aluminium chassis was launched.GRS Introduces New Aluminum Chassis System ¬´ Daily Bulletin It was delivered with options for the SIG Sauer 200 STR/SSG 3000, Remington 700 (Short Action and Long Action), Howa 1500 (Short Action and Long Action), and Tikka T3. Bolthorn uses the same speed lock system as the laminate models. Additionally, the Bolthorn stock has an adjustable pistol grip and uses AICS-magazines. In 2016, the Bifrost composite stock was launched. The stock is reinforced with glass fiber, and features the speed lock system. In 2018, the Berserk composite stock was launched. It uses a different composite and a new type of stock adjustment called SpeedLock 2. In 2019, the Ragnarok and Warg stocks were launched. Ragnarok is a chassis for Blaser R8 and Blaser R93, while Warg is a hybrid stock which fits several other bolt action models. Both stocks feature M-LOK compatible handguards.

Oposa is a marine conservationist and co-founder of NGO Save Philippine Seas (SPS), an organization that aims to protect coastal and marine environments through education and community-based projects. She helped create the first shark sanctuary in the Philippines and helped designate the thresher shark as a nationally protected species. Oposa aims to combat what she believes are the biggest barriers to marine conservation: lack of coordination between local interest groups and a lack of public education around marine issues.  Early life and education  Oposa had an interest in sea life early on and was exposed to environmental issues through her father's work as one of the Philippines' first environmental lawyers. Oposa began her education in the arts and graduated college with a degree in English Studies. But as she learned more about the marine illegal wildlife trade in the Philippines, she moved into conservation work. In 2014, she received the Chevening scholarship from the British government, which she used to earn her MSc in Conservation Science from Imperial College London in 2015. In 2017, she became a Global Fellow for Marine Conservation at the Duke University Marine Laboratory in North Carolina, United States.

Biography  The Storrs brothers were born into a hardscrabble farming family in Mansfield, Connecticut. Their parents were Royal Storrs, Jr., and Eunice Freeman, both of Mansfield. The Storrs brothers traced their paternity back to Samuel Storrs, who emigrated to the United States in 1663 from Nottinghamshire. He lived in Barnstable, Massachusetts and then moved to Mansfield, Connecticut, where he died in April 1719. They were distant cousins of Connecticut judge and politician Zalmon Storrs. The brothers attended country school but never went to college. Charles Storrs became a school teacher at age 18, hired a substitute to work on his father's farm, and started himself out in business. He spent three years selling Mansfield-made silk to wholesale merchants, worked on commission for a manufacturing firm in Hartford from 1845 to 1850, and moved to Brooklyn in May 1850. He became a partner in his firm in July 1853, taking over the firm in 1854 and paying off its liabilities. In December 1854, he started a commission-based mercantile firm called the Storrs Brothers, associating with his brothers Augustus and Royal Otis (1815‚Äì1888). Royal dropped out after a year or so, but Charles and Augustus continued to work together. Charles served as head of the firm for 25 years, from 1854 to 1879, and accumulated a substantial fortune. Charles was a friend of Horace Greeley, accompanying Greeley on a 1871 trip to Texas and serving as executor of Greeley's will. Retired in 1879, Charles was endorsed by the Brooklyn Eagle and the Brooklyn Times as a candidate for mayor of Brooklyn. In his authorized biography, Charles was described as genial, energetic, and sincere, with a passion for collecting books, art, and friends. Less is known about the elder brother, Augustus Storrs. In 1839, Augustus opened a store in the Gurleyville village of Mansfield. He moved to Hartford in 1846 and to Brooklyn in 1851. Augustus went into business with Charles in New York City, but whereas Charles remained in Brooklyn except to travel, in 1875 Augustus bought the family homestead from Royal Otis and developed a stock farm of more than 800 acres, raising thoroughbred cattle and horses. He spent his summers in Mansfield and actively supervised the family's 800-acre farm. Augustus was a friend of Henry Ward Beecher and attended Beecher's Plymouth Church from 1858 onward, serving as treasurer, trustee, and president. Augustus was accounted a practical, meticulous, and unobtrusive person and successful gentleman farmer.  Storrs Agricultural School  \\"Having experienced the intellectual privations that are too commonly incident to farm-life,\\" the Storrs brothers in December 1880 offered to donate land and money to the State of Connecticut to found an agricultural school in their hometown of Mansfield. Augustus donated 170 acres and several buildings, while Charles donated $6000 and 800 books from his personal library. Included in the land grant was UConn's first substantial structure, Edwin Whitney Hall, site of a Civil War orphanage which Storrs had previously purchased from Whitney's widow for $5000. The gift was accepted and Storrs Agricultural School established by act of the Connecticut General Assembly on April 21, 1881. Augustus Storrs initially imposed restrictions on his deed of gift, insisting that the State of Connecticut pay him $12,000 in the event that it decided to relocate the school and sell off the land within twenty years. He also sought to bar the state from using the land for any purpose but an educational institution, explicitly ruling out use for an insane asylum, poorhouse, or reformatory. Amid mounting threats from the legislature to move the school elsewhere, Storrs agreed to convey the land without restrictions. As part of his April 1886 agreement with the state, Augustus went to court to clear the title at his own expense. These conflicts and uncertainty caused the fate of the school to hang in the balance for the first years of its existence. Augustus continued to aid the school until his death, remitting $30 in water rent in 1889 to buy library books and surrendering two acres of his garden in 1890 to enable a dormitory to be built. UConn's Augustus Storrs Hall was built in 1906 and was the first brick building on campus. It initially served as a men‚Äôs dormitory. Renovated to house offices and classrooms in 1952, Storrs Hall was home to the university's nursing school as of 2018. UConn's main campus lies in the village of Storrs along Connecticut Route 195, a stretch of which is named Storrs Road.  Family  Charles Storrs married Maryett M. Cook (1824‚Äì1889) of Coventry, Connecticut on July 4, 1844. The couple had one daughter, Sarah, born December 12, 1845. Sarah married David Choate Proctor of Peoria, Illinois, in 1869. Augustus Storrs married Antoinette Charlotte Abbe (1816‚Äì1888) of Windham, Connecticut in September 1839. The couple had two daughters, Harriet Fitch (1844‚Äì1887) and Marie Antoinette. The latter daughter married Benjamin Eyrie Valentine II of Mansfield and had five daughters: Antoinette, Ethel, Elizabeth, Marguerite and Hattie. Both brothers, their wives, children, and other relatives are interred in Storrs Cemetery, in a large family plot at the crest of a hill overlooking UConn's campus. In 1864, Charles Storrs had deeded the cemetery grounds to the township on the condition that the intervening trees be kept down so that the spire of the Storrs Congregational Church be always visible from the plot.

Primarily based out of Oklahoma, the gang has also has members in federal custody, as well as in several states across the country. The UAB modeled itself after the principles and ideologies of the original Aryan Brotherhood prison gang, but despite the similar name, the Universal Aryan Brotherhood has no connection to said gang. It is also unrelated to the United Aryan Brotherhood (also based in Oklahoma). Background The Universal Aryan Brotherhood are one of the many white supremacist prison gangs across the United States. Much like the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas and the Soldiers of Aryan Culture, the UAB operates both inside and outside of prison walls. Members of the UAB identify themselves through distinctive criminal tattoos, as well as red and black clothing The gang's particular insignia consists of a dual set of sig runes adopted from the infamous Schutzstaffel, which is also used by many other unrelated white power groups and neo-Nazi organizations. An additional expression used by the Universal Aryan Brotherhood is the numerical code \\"2112\\" (also written as \\"21-12\\"), referencing the 21st letter of the alphabet, 'u' for 'universal', in combination with the first and second letters of the alphabet (1, 2) which each correspond to 'a' and 'b' for 'Aryan' and 'Brotherhood'. Likewise, some UAB members sport tattoos of the letters \\"T.T.B.B.E\\", an acronym for the phrase \\"Till The Bitter Bloody End\\". Another acronymic slogan used by the gang is \\"U.F.F.U.\\" - meaning \\"Universal Forever, Forever Universal\\". Two distinct subsets of the UAB exist: UAB 21 WoodGrain and the UAB Universal Family. Organization and structure Membership is exclusive to white prisoners. Members, who often refer to themselves as \\"Universal Soldiers\\", adhere to militaristic rules. Universal Aryan Brotherhood‚Äôs top echelon, known as the Main Council, directs gang activities and controls sub-councils in smaller prisons. Most of the Main Council members are imprisoned inside the maximum-security Oklahoma State Penitentiary-McAlester. The UAB recruits by offering protection to white inmates in return for joining the gang. In order to be considered for UAB membership, a prisoner is required to be sponsored by a fully initiated member. That said sponsoring UAB member would then be responsible for conducting a background investigation of the prospect as a way of ensuring that he was not a sex offender, a law enforcement cooperator, or otherwise undesirable for gang membership. According to the United States Department of Justice, the gang uses cell phones that have been smuggled inside Oklahoma prisons to orchestrate criminal activities on the outside. Criminal activities The Universal Aryan Brotherhood has been involved in numerous violent crimes ranging from kidnapping to murder. Like many similar white supremacist gangs, its primary source of income is through the production and distribution of drugs - primarily, methamphetamine, but also oxycodone and marijuana. Additional activities include: carjackings, assaults, armed robberies and murders. Kidnappings In an effort to expand UAB‚Äôs power and operations throughout Oklahoma, a series of multiple kidnappings were ordered and commenced. These kidnappings were also used as a way to further the gang's illegal activities and as a intimidation tactic against rivals. Murder of Sufeng He In 2011, Chinese-American University of Tulsa student Sufeng He was shot and killed in an attempted carjacking by UAB member Billy Joe Hammons following a police pursuit from a subsequent crime spree that Hammons had engaged in. After Sufeng He was gunned down, Hammons exchanged gunfire with local police and was fatally shot. Torture and murder of Jared Langworthy On December 7th of 2019, UAB member Jared Langworthy was bashed with baseball bats, tortured, and thrown in a pond by a total of seven fellow gang members - allegedly over the destruction of an air conditioning unit that occurred during a fight with his girlfriend. Langworthy's gang tattoo was forcibly burned of his shoulder during the attack. Due to the severity of the beating, the inflicted injuries ended up being fatal. Additional killings *On May of 2012, UAB prospect Grant Curry beat former motorcycle gang member and admitted drug trafficker Anthony Mollman to death for cooperating with law enforcement. The murder was caught on a surveillance videotape and depicts a total of seven inmates helping carry out the crime. *According to a RICO indictment, James Mask was assaulted by a Universal Aryan Brotherhood member on orders from the UAB main council. The assault resulted in Mask's death. *In 2005, African-American inmate Donald Jones was stabbed to death at Cimarron Correctional Facility by Johnny R. Jameson along with an additional member of the Universal Aryan Brotherhood. The attack was commenced in retaliation against black inmates for the death of another UAB member, Adam Lippert. *Acting on orders from the UAB main council, Blake Ford was beaten to death on July 29, 2009. *Sometime around September of 2015, two members of the rival Irish Mob, a notorious Irish-American organized crime group, were killed by Universal Aryan Brotherhood members in part of an ongoing war between both gangs.

Disruption of blood flow leads to the development of pressure in the tissue, which can cause pain and disease. Various factors can interfere with blood circulation but all of them start at the smallest blood vessels, namely, capillaries or the capillary net. Microcirculation of blood in the tissues of all internal organs is the same. Hence, chronic internal diseases in different organs of the body have the same root, namely the impairment of microcirculation. It creates focal pressure in the affected tissue. Thus, the physical factor is responsible for the development of chronic internal disease. A disease is a condition that disrupts the normal functioning of the body, and an internal disease refers to a problem that develops in an organ or area of the body, causing pain and dysfunction, then becoming chronic, thus leading to disability and death. The Origin of Internal Diseases explains a range of pathophysiologic changes in the tissue of the organ or area of the body that leads to the development of pain or disease. A literature search reveals a publication by Dr Simon Allen in the medical journal: Diseases, which states that pain and chronic internal disease have the same root ‚Äì specifically, a pathological activity of capillaries.Allen S 2017 The Vascular Factor Plays the Main Role in the Cause of Pain in Men with Chronic Prostatitis and Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome: The Results of Clinical Trial on Thermobalancing Therapy. Diseases, 5(4), 25; doi:10.3390/diseases5040025 Background According to the National Health Interview Survey of the National Center for Health Statistics, a chronic disease is defined as a condition lasting 3 months or longer.MedicineNet 2016 Definition of Chronic Disease [updated 5/13/2016; cited 2016 5/30/2016]. Available from: http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33490 Goodman RA, et al described a few meanings of chronic problems. McKenna and Collins determined that chronic conditions are characterized by uncertain etiology, multiple risk factors, and a long latency period. The World Health Organization demarcated chronic diseases as having long duration and generally slow progression and the Florida Department of Health stated that chronic diseases have a long course of illness which rarely resolves spontaneously, and they are generally not cured by medication or prevented by vaccine.Goodman RA, Posner SF et al 2013 Defining and Measuring Chronic Conditions: Imperatives for Research, Policy, Program, and Practice. Prev Chronic Dis; 10:120239. This uncertainty in etiology leads to the absence of effective therapy, therefore a variety of personal, social, and health care resource strategies are used in patients with chronic health problems.Ridgeway JL, Egginton JS, Tiedje K et al 2014 Factors that lessen the burden of treatment in complex patients with chronic conditions: a qualitative study, Patient Prefer Adherence, 19;8:339-51 Many studies confirm that disturbance of blood circulation in the affected organ leads to ischemia of the tissue, causing its dysfunction and disease.Vlodaver Z 2017 Pathology of Ischemic Heart Disease.

Prostate. 79:5:536-543. doi: 10.1002/pros.23759 The understanding of the causes of chronic illness would lead to its effective prevention and treatment. Publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals by Dr Simon Allen, which are focused on the etiology and pathophysiology of chronic prostate diseases, explain step by step that the physical factor is responsible for chronic disease due to spontaneous angiogenesis in response to ischemia in the tissue of the affected organ.Allen S 2016 Use of thermobalancing therapy in ageing male with benign prostatic hyperplasia with a focus on etiology and pathophysiology, Aging Male, 2016,1-5, http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13685538.2016.1247151Aghajanyan IG 2016 Positive Response to Thermobalancing Therapy Enabled by Therapeutic Device in Men with Non-Malignant Prostate Diseases: BPH and Chronic Prostatitis, Diseases, 4, 18. doi:10.3390/diseases4020018Allen S 2019 The cause of chronic prostatitis and prostate enlargement is a change in the vascular level and requires similar treatment: innovative Thermobalancing therapy, IJMAS, 2019, vol. 9, no. 2, pp. 290-293. http://innovativejournal.in/index.php/ijmhs/article/view/2453 Pathophysiology All tissues of the body receive nutrients and warmth in the same way, i.e. through the blood vessels forming the capillary net that covers the whole body.Anatomy and Physiology by Rice University, 131 20.1 Structure and function of blood vessels, https://opentextbc.ca/anatomyandphysiology/chapter/20-1-structure-and- function-of-blood-vessels These capillaries are the same in all organs of the body (in the brain, heart, liver, kidneys, prostate, etc.). The development of a pathological activity of capillaries in these organs can lead to their chronic internal disease. Two functions of small blood vessels, which are not controlled by the central nervous system, are termed by physiologists as constriction of capillaries and spontaneous expansion of capillaries.Baldwin AL 2000 A brief history of capillaries and some examples of their apparently strange behaviour, Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology, vol. 27. no. 10, 821‚Äì825 Dr Allen concludes that these pathophysiological capillary functions are responsible for the development of the pathological activity of capillaries.Hansen-Smith FM 2000 Capillary network patterning during angiogenesis, Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology, vol. 27. no. 10, pp. 830‚Äì835 First, the constriction of capillaries occurs in response to different triggers, such as infection, cold, excessive elements in blood, pain, stress, and others. * It creates the micro-focus of hypothermia in the affected tissue. * When the initial trigger and constriction of capillaries repeats again and again, the focus of hypothermia becomes a trigger itself, irritating the affected tissue. The second function responsible for the development of the pathological activity of capillaries is the spontaneous expansion of a capillary net. * It occurs in order to improve blood circulation in this affected tissue. * The nervous system does not regulate the spontaneous expansion of capillaries, so the expansion can continue and continue. The expanded capillaries form extra tissue that creates pressure in this area. Gradually, this pressure inside the organ, i.e. a physical factor, leads to its malfunction. The conclusion is that the pressure resulting from spontaneous angiogenesis in response to focal hypothermia is responsible for the origin and development of chronic internal disease. Thermobalancing treatment The findings of an underlying cause of chronic internal conditions have led to the development of a therapy that can stabilise the temperature in the affected organ locally, and thus treat the reason for the problem, not just the symptoms. It is called Thermobalancing therapy. The wearable therapeutic Dr Allen‚Äôs Device has been designed as a non-invasive treatment implement of this therapy. An article published in the International Journal of Quality Innovation, titled Thermobalancing therapy and Dr. Allen's Device for the first time employs body energy to treat chronic prostatic diseases effectively, explores that a stable normal body temperature in the affected organ facilitates blood flow in the tissue, helping to alleviate the problem.Allen S 2020 Innovative Thermobalancing therapy and Dr Allen's device for the first time employ body energy to treat chronic prostatic disease effectively, International Journal of Quality Innovation, 6, 2; https://jqualityinnovation.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40887-020-00035-0 ReferencesExternal links  Category:Medical diagnosis ","title":"Origin of Chronic Diseases"},{"id":"64780635","text":"A fire alarm is an alarm that warns people about a fire.

She moved to South Bend, Indiana for her graduate studies, where she earned a master's degree. She moved to Creighton University, Omaha, Nebraska for a bachelor's degree in nursing. After graduating, Walker worked as a nurse in the University of Nebraska Medical Center. When her husband's career forced her to move to New Haven, Connecticut, she became a visiting nurse. In this capacity she witnessed first hand how important it was for diabetic patients to be able to manage their own health.v She held various hospital positions in Connecticut, including at the Yale School of Nursing, before starting her doctoral research. In 1988 Walker completed her PhD at the Catholic University of America.  Research and career  After earning her doctorate Walker joined the State University of New York as an Associate Professor of Nursing. She moved to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1990, where she was eventually promoted to Professor in 2004. Her research considered evidence- based approaches to improve the self-management of diabetes. She has shown that regular telephone counselling can serve as a high impact, low cost tool to lower blood sugar in adults with uncontrolled diabetes. Unfortunately, printed self management tools are not sufficient to improve the control of diabetes. In 2016 Walker was awarded a multi-million dollar grant from the National Science Foundation to launch a centre that focussed on transnational diabetes research. The centre has a particular focus on the health of people from low-income communities and marginalised ethnic groups. Whilst Walker initially focused on diabetes control in New York City, she soon shifted her focus to global health, with a particular focus on Uganda. Walker worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to implement the Power Up for Health lifestyle intervention programme which looked to prevent diabetes in high-risk individuals. The programme was offered in recreation centres across New York City and delivered by multi-lingual lifestyle coaches. Over the sixteen week intervention, participants reported weight loss of ~ 5%, as well as improvement in healthy eating and fewer depressive symptoms.  Awards and honours  Walker was elected President of the American Diabetes Association in 1999. She was awarded the Creighton University Alumni Merit Award in 2002.

The Town Hall and Jail was completed in 1700s; construction of sobrados of wealthy families followed soon after. The Sobrado at No. 2 is included as a part of the Historic Center of Cachoeira. Structure The Sobrado at No. 2 Rua Ana Nery has an irregular floor plan, a result of the limited size of small corner plot in an urban setting. It is constructed of self-supporting mixed masonry walls of stone and brick. Internal partitions of the house are of wood. The sobrado has a four doors that opens to the square with four windows above, and two doors that open to Rua Ana Nery with three windows above. The windows on the upper floor are rectangular with latticed shutters and elaborate iron balconets. The elaborate portals and windows of the sobrado, have straight lintels and mortar borders, are in contrast to the adjacent House at No. 4, which has a simple door and a single sash window on the ground floor. The ground floor the Sobrado at No. 2 has an irregular, trapezoidal plan and consists of four large rooms on the ground floor and six smaller rooms on the upper floor. A small corridor leads to the stairs from a door on Rua Ana Nery. The upper floor has a flat, wooden ceiling; the front corner room has a coffered ceiling. The sobrado, like many others of the colonial period, has a small attic, or 'mezanino'. It probably served both as a bedroom for women family members, and as a room to use during the frequent flooding of the Paragua√ßu River. Protected status The House at No. 2 Rua Ana Nery was listed as a protected historic site by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1943 under inscription number 245. Access The sobrado functions as a municipal government building. The tourist office on the ground floor is open to the public and may be visited.

Murders and aftermath  At one point Valenzuela had been living in a house assigned to Rosa Rivas with her and her five children. The owners of the house eventually evicted them due to Valenzuela's reputation as an illiterate drunk. On August 20, 1960 Valenzuela was waiting for Rivas in the ranch they had built for a home. He wanted her to bring him money from her widow's pension so that he could continue his drinking with it. When she returned without the money he flew into a rage and killed her with a scythe. He then killed each of her children and fled. After being arrested and imprisoned Valenzuela repented, became literate, became a stronger Catholic, and learned the trade of guitar-making. His eventual execution by firing squad was considered controversial as it went against the concept of rehabilitation, of which Valenzuela was considered a prime example. The film El Chacal de Nahueltoro (1969) was based on Valenzuela's story and is considered by some to be the best Chilean film ever made.

Nkadimeng was awarded the Order of Luthuli in 2003 by President Thabo Mbeki and Isitwalandwe in 2019 by President Cyril Ramaphosa. Background and career John Kgwana Nkadimeng was born in June 1927 Sekhukhuneland in the rural eastern Transvaal Province (now called Limpopo Province in South Africa). After completing primary school he worked as a domestic worker in Germiston (Gauteng Province) where he remained for about a year. He returned home in 1945 and in 1946 was employed in a hat factory in Johannesburg. He again returned to Sekhukhuniland and early in 1947 went back to Johannesburg to work in a tobacco factory. Whilst employed in the tobacco factory, Nkadimeng joined the African Tobacco Workers' Union, becoming a shop steward in 1949. Following a strike in 1950, he lost his job. During the 1952 Defiance Campaign he was arrested and detained for a month. He was charged with conspiracy and attempting to overthrow the state by violence, but the charges were dropped and he was released. Political life Nkadimeng subsequently became a full-time organiser for the Transvaal Council of Non-European Trade Unions. Whilst he was working for the Council, it joined the South African Congress of Trade Unions (SACTU), which was formed in March 1955. Nkadimeng served on SACTU's 19-person executive committee and in October was requested to work full-time for the Transvaal Iron, Steel and Metal Workers' Union, which SACTU regarded as covering a strategic industry. Nkadimeng joined the African National Congress (ANC) in 1950 through the influence of his close friend, Flag Boshielo. He was appointed to the ANC national executive committee in December 1955 at its congress in Bloemfontein, and in 1956 he was one of 156 Congress activists accused of treason. He remained a defendant throughout the lengthy trial until his acquittal in 1961. During the trial, Nkadimeng moved from the Jeppe men's hostel to live in Alexandra Township where he remained until 1961. During this time he and his wife struggled to maintain their family and lived in very difficult circumstances. On 4 May 1961, Nkadimeng, who had retained strong connections with his people in Sekhukhuneland and had been refused permission to visit his mother there, was arrested for entering the proclaimed area without a permit. He was detained until 1 July, convicted and fined ¬£25. Nkadimeng assisted the Human rights Welfare Committee, established to make contact with banished people throughout South Africa and to find those banished after the Sekhukhune trial in the late 1950s. On 24 June 1963 Nkadimeng was detained as a suspected saboteur and held at Fordsburg police station under 90-day legislation. He was charged with others who had attempted to leave the country and it was Nkadimeng's belief that this was an attempt to obtain information from him regarding the whereabouts of Walter Sisulu. He was later detained at Erasmia where, despite the fact that it was winter, he was held in freezing conditions and denied a coat or blankets. Nkadimeng refused to speak to a visiting magistrate, maintaining that he had an insulting manner, so the chief magistrate of Pretoria came to see him in detention. Nkadimeng remembers that when he was put in the sun to warm up, his frozen skin began to crack. He was then moved to prison in Pretoria. Sabotage charges against Nkadimeng were dropped but he was charged with furthering the aims of an unlawful organisation. He was convicted in May 1964, served his sentence at a prison in the Orange Free State and was released in 1966. Whilst in detention in Fordsburg in 1963, Nkadimeng was issued with a banning order, which remained in effect when he came out of prison. He was restricted to the area of Orlando West, Johannesburg. He remained under banning orders until he fled the country on 24 July 1976; a month after the Soweto uprising began. Nkadimeng went to Swaziland where he worked for the ANC for two years. He moved to Mozambique where he was chairman of the senior structure of the ANC in the country. He rejoined the ANC national executive committee and served as chairman of its political committee until he became general secretary of SACTU on 17 August 1983. He continued to serve on the ANC's political and military council. As SACTU's general secretary, Nkadimeng propagated the formation of one central federation of trade unions in South Africa, and called on unions to unite in the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU). When the South African Communist Party was relaunched as a legal body on 29 July 1990, it was announced that Nkadimeng was a member of its central committee, and he was also named as part of the party's 22-person interim leadership group. He was appointed South African Ambassador to the People's Republic of Cuba in August 1995 by Nelson Mandela. In 2019 the ANC bestowed an Isithwalandwe/Seaparankwe award upon Nkadimeng for his role in fighting apartheid. Prior to this, in 2013, the Government of South Africa conferred the Order of Luthuli in Gold on Nkadimeng for dedicating his adult life to the struggle for liberation, workers‚Äô rights and for the formation of a united federation of trade unions. Death He died on 6 August 2020 and he was given a special state funeral on 14 August 2020 and he was buried at Westpark Cemetery.

Life Pierre Leroy was born in 1909. He obtained a doctorate in law, and joined the territorial service of the Belgian Congo in 1938. Leroy became interested in the neolithic megaliths in the Uele River basin, and later wrote a book on the subject. Some thought they were natural formations, but Leroy thought they must be man-made and deserved the attention of the prehistorian or protohistorian. Leroy was interested in the paving at Api, which had been badly damaged during excavations in 1936 and 1940 by Jeanne Tercafs, who moved central stones and dug trenches, then left the wrecked site to the mercy of the weather. Leroy saw similarities to structures of Ancient Egypt, and hypothesized that there could be a connection. He thought the pavement could have been the base for a massive religious structure, probably a tomb. Leroy was governor of the Orientale Province from 22 December 1958 to 11 June 1960, when the Congo Republic became independent. On 12 January 1960 Patrice Lumumba was sentenced to six months imprisonment. Pierre Leroy, with the agreement of the governor-general and the governor of Katanga, had him transferred the next day to Buluo prison in Jadotville, Katanga. On 25 January the Belgian government ordered Lumumba's release so he could participate in a round table discussion in Brussels of the independence process. In 1961, with an unstable situation, the Belgian teachers who had remained in the Congo went on strike to demand open return tickets so they could return to Belgium at any time if conditions got worse. Leroy was sent to Luluabourg to evaluate the situation of Belgians there, including 90 teachers and 50 former colonial administrators who were providing advice to their successors. Leroy was critical of the administrators but positive about the teachers, whom he saw as important in the context of the Cold War in counteracting the influence of Eastern Europeans there. He wrote, \\"Our teachers exert a tremendous influence on the country‚Äôs evolution by educating the next generation of leaders.\\" The Belgian government should remember that the teachers were \\"the greatest means of pressure in our possession.\\" Leroy died in 1985. Publications Leroy wrote a five-volume autobiography of his life in the Congo, with 100 copies printed by himself and given to his parents and friends.

History  Following the 1812 Constitution, the first deputation should have convened on 14 August 1813, although there are no records of meetings for such period neither for the Trienio Liberal. Following the 1833 division of Spain and the ensuing 1835 decree on the creation of provincial deputations, the provincial deputation of Toledo was definitely installed on 3 January 1836. Santiago Villa, from Torrijos, became the first president of the provincial corporation. The provincial deputation opened its current headquarters in 1899.  Structure  The composition of its deliberative assembly or plenary (pleno) is indirectly determined on the basis of its election by the elected municipal councillors of all ayuntamientos. The partisan distribution of the plenary is determined as per the D'Hondt apportionment of the results of the sum of municipal elections in each one of the judicial districts (as of 2019: Toledo, Talavera de la Reina, Torrijos, Quintanar de la Orden, Orgaz and Oca√±a). The president of the deputation is elected by the plenary from among its members at the constitutive session of the provincial corporation that follows the constitutive session of the municipal corporations (the ayuntamientos).

He was originally played by Greg O'Meara from his first appearance on 8 September 1994. Shane was introduced along with his parents and two younger brothers. His first stint in the show ends with him going to prison after committing a string of robberies, before escaping and trying to convince his brother Stonefish Rebecchi (Anthony Engelman) to hide him. Shane's exit scenes aired on 25 July 1995. The character was reintroduced 22 years later on 17 April 2017, with actor Nicholas Coghlan cast in the role. He was introduced along with his wife Dipi Rebecchi (Sharon Johal) and daughters Yashvi Rebecchi (Olivia Junkeer) and Kirsha Rebecchi (Vani Dhir), as part of a big expansion of the Rebecchi family. Executive producer Jason Herbison called Shane \\"one of the great untapped characters from Neighbours history\\". Shane's fictional backstory details his rehabilitation from prison and subsequent move to Bourke, where he raised his family. Coghlan used his own personal experiences as \\"a bad boy\\" to help him with the role and he believed Shane had matured since his first stint. Shane is also portrayed as being calmer, fun loving and protective. He returns to Erinsborough to support his brother Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) through his marital issues, and is accompanied by his sister-in-law Mishti Sharma (Scarlet Vas), with whom he has a close friendship. The new Rebecchis were given immediate links with the show's characters, as Shane rents Number 32 Ramsay Street and takes over the lease of Harold's Caf√©. Writers scripted a feud between Shane and neighbour Gary Canning (Damien Richardson), which begins when Gary loses Shane a potential investor. Gary later attacks Dipi, before befriending her, leading to jealousy from Shane. Writers later established a friendship between Shane and his younger co-worker Roxy Willis (Zima Anderson), after she confides in him about being a donor match for David Tanaka (Takaya Honda). Anderson thought the friendship was unexpected and called it \\"an odd match\\", but said that Shane allows Roxy to be herself. The friendship is soon tested when Roxy kisses Shane and then tells Dipi. Johal said her character feels betrayed by Shane and that the kiss caused a breach of trust within Shane and Dipi's marriage. In 2020, the character was used to portray the problems of drug addiction. Shane takes amphetamines to help him keep up with his university coursework and cope with everyday life, as he suffers from low self-esteem. Coghlan was glad of the chance to take on a larger, more serious storyline. Roxy also becomes involved and Coghlan said Shane abuses their friendship, calling his actions towards her brutal and cruel. Storylines=1994‚Äì1995 Shortly after leaving prison, Shane is reunited with his brother Stonefish Rebecchi (Anthony Engelman). After noticing a poster for a pool competition at The Waterhole, Shane decides to enter. He meets Julie Martin (Julie Mullins) and buys her several drinks, before joining Rick Alessi (Dan Falzon) and Sam Kratz (Richard Grieve) at the table. During the contest, Shane distracts Sam and his friend bumps the table causing him to sink his shot, giving Shane the win. Sam's grandmother, Marlene Kratz (Moya O'Sullivan) refuses to pay out due to the cheating and a brawl ensues. Shane's family buy and move into 32 Ramsay Street, Shane begins stealing from the neighbours. When Shane gives a stranded Marlene and Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy) a ride to an art market, Helen notices a few stolen goods in the back of his van. Shane then panics and drives off, leaving the women stranded once more. He is eventually arrested and the family move out of Number 32. While he is on bail, Shane is asked by his younger brother Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) to take himself, Billy Kennedy (Jesse Spencer), and Justin Devine (Nick Jones) on a joyride in Karl Kennedy's (Alan Fletcher) car. Shane breaks the taillight while reversing, but is able to fix it. The following week, Shane is sentenced to six months imprisonment for burglary. Several months later, Shane escapes from prison and asks Stonie to hide him at Number 32, where he is lodging with Malcolm Kennedy (Benjamin McNair) and Danni Stark (Eliza Szonert). Stonie reluctantly agrees, but is annoyed when Shane spends the money he gives him on cigarettes. After being convinced to give himself up, Shane is eventually arrested and sent back to prison. 2017‚Äì Shane returns to Erinsborough 22 years later, having been sent by his mother to check up on Toadie, who is going through marital problems. Shane and Toadie reunite on Ramsay Street, and Shane meets his niece Nell Rebecchi (Scarlett Anderson) for the first time. At an Easter picnic, Shane tells Toadie that he saw Toadie's estranged wife Sonya Rebecchi (Eve Morey) kissing Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) earlier that day. Shane rents Number 32 and buys the lease for Harold's Caf√©, before his wife Dipi Rebecchi (Sharon Johal) and their two daughters Yashvi Rebecchi (Olivia Junkeer) and Kirsha Rebecchi (Vani Dhir) arrive. Shane and his sister-in-law Mishti Sharma (Scarlet Vas) share several secretive conversations, making Dipi suspicious. Shane admits that he accepted a loan from Mishti, as he lost a lot of money working on a solar-powered lawnmower. Dipi later learns that Shane had to stop Mishti from going after the person responsible for her fianc√©'s death with her police service weapon. Dipi realises Mishti gave Shane the loan on the condition that he kept it from her. Shane reassures Dipi of his love by writing and performing a bush ballad for her. Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson) finds an investor who wants to manufacture the lawnmower. Shane bonds with Karl when they join the Livability Committee. After Karl is removed as head of the committee, Shane is chosen in his place, but he is also asked to step down when he loses control of the lawnmower during a demonstration. Shane accuses Karl of sabotaging the lawnmower and they fight. After Kirsha suffers hearing loss in an accident with some fireworks, Shane admits that he feels like he has failed as a parent. Shane and Yashvi help Kirsha to learn Auslan, and Shane invents a device that allows her to feel vibrations from music. When he pushes Kirsha out of the path of Jimmy Williams's (Darcy Tadich) bike, Shane suffers a dislocated thumb and a torn tendon in his hand. Shane arranges a meeting with entrepreneur Levi Jansen (Sam Allen) about his urine-powered generator, but when Levi cancels their meeting and leaves town, Shane gets drunk. He soon learns that it was Gary Canning (Damien Richardson) fault that Levi left and confronts him in the street. Shane kicks over some bins and snaps Gary's fishing rod, forcing Mishti to arrest him. Shane later acts on some poor business advice from Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano), and he loses Levi as a potential investor. Dipi accuses Leo of sabotaging the deal when he offers to take a generator for his backpackers hostel. Shane takes adult education classes in an effort to get his Year 12 certificate. Sheila Canning (Colette Mann) accuses Shane of cheating when he comes top in a biology test, but he insists that while he considered it, he did not cheat. Sheila offers Shane a job at The Waterhole as a barman, as he needs the money to hire a physiotherapist for his hand. The Rebecchis are chosen as the Face of Lassiters Hotel and take part in a photoshoot for a promotional poster campaign. Shane decides to promote his new urine-to-water generator at Dipi's fundraiser for her musical Flapper, without telling anyone. When he admits the water they have been drinking was previously urine, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) pulls his $5000 investment. Shane later offers Toadie his support when Toadie leans he has fathered another child with Andrea Somers (Madeleine West). When the Face of Lassiters posters are vandalised, Marisa Taylor (Shannon Barker) is presumed to have done it, as she previously racially abused Yashvi. Kirsha admits to Shane that she is responsible, as she hoped the family would be let go from the campaign, so she would not be bullied. Kirsha later tells Shane that Marisa is blackmailing her and he angrily confronts Marisa, who records him and posts the footage online, leading to the family being dropped from the campaign. Lassiters also pulls its financial support of Dipi's musical. Dipi struggles to forgive Shane, until he arranges for himself, Kirsha, Yashvi, Toadie and Sheila to put on a private performance of the musical in their back yard. Shane and Dipi are concerned when Mishti decides to have an arranged marriage, and Shane tries to keep Dipi from intervening. After Shane ridicules Clive Gibbons (Geoff Paine) about needing Dipi's performance-enhancing tea to help him with his erectile problems, Clive informs Shane that Dipi has secretly been giving him the tea for years, which leads to Shane feeling embarrassed and inadequate. Shane hires Chloe Brennan (April Rose Pengilly) through her escort business to talk, after he sees Levi Jansen is a client of her's, but Dipi believes Shane is paying for sex and confronts them in the street. Back home, Shane questions whether he is enough for Dipi and points out that his inventions never seem to go anywhere. He also tells her that she looks at him differently since they left Bourke. Dipi says that she is proud of him for pursuing what he loves, but Shane is unconvinced. Amy's partner Dr. Rob Carson (Christopher Farrell) promotes Shane's recycled- urine water on his social media, and Shane begins selling bottles at The Wellness Centre. When Elly Conway (Jodi Anasta) falls ill, she initially blames the water and Gary tells Shane that he never should have trusted him. Elly soon learns from Aaron that she has food poisoning and she apologises to Shane. Gary also apologises for losing his temper and they shake hands. During a promotional event for the water, Rob sprays the audience with urine after learning Amy is now dating Gary, however, Shane is glad of the publicity. After Mishti gets engaged, she chooses to relocate to Sydney and at her farewell party, she thanks Shane and Dipi for taking care of her and supporting her. Shane gets a high enough ATAR result that allows him to pursue an engineering degree at the university. Dipi is hospitalised after being attacked by Gary, who mistook her for someone else. She suffers a severe allergic reaction during a scan and goes into cardiac arrest, but soon recovers. Shane takes out his anger on Sheila and throws her out of Dipi's hospital room. Days later, Shane finds Gary in his house bonding with Dipi over recipes and physically man-handles Gary out the door and into the street. After Yashvi and Kirsha are held hostage by Raymond Renshaw (Frank Magree), Dipi struggles in the aftermath and she spends more time with Gary. Yashvi fears they are having an affair and Shane confronts Gary, before he and Dipi agree to communicate better and be more supportive of one another. Shortly before Sonya dies from ovarian cancer, she enlists Shane's help to visit Andrea. She later confides in him that Andrea believes Toadie's former wife Dee Bliss (Madeleine West) is still alive, as a man she met in Hobart mistook her for Dee. Shane later tells Dipi this information and they decide not to tell Toadie, until he returns from a trip to the United States with the children. After their house is sold, Shane and his family move in with Toadie. Shane and Dipi talk to Mark Brennan about Andrea, and he advises them to contact her, but she refuses to see them. Toadie asks Shane and Dipi to move out when they pack up Sonya's belongings, but he changes his mind as he needs their support. Shane later realises Toadie has not been to the garden nursery since Sonya's death, and organises a small gathering of Toadie's friends to help him move forward. Mark informs Shane that he has located Andrea and Shane visits her by himself, where she tells him about the man who recognised her as a woman named Karen. Believing that this could be Dee, Shane asks Andrea for her help and brings her back to Erinsborough. He also asks Mark to continue investigating Andrea's claims, and it later emerges that Dee is alive and Andrea is trying to con Toadie again. She is arrested when Dee turns up in Erinsborough. Shane sees Yashvi on a date with Ned Willis (Ben Hall) and cross-examines them. Ned later tells Shane that he plans on taking things slowly with Yashvi. Shane and Dipi realise Dee is in love with Toadie and ask her to take a step back for his and Nell and Hugo sake. When Dee avoids Toadie completely, Shane and Dipi have to tell Toadie what they said to Dee. Shane and Yashvi's relationship becomes strained when she forgets a father-daughter date to spend time with Ned. She attempts to move out and Dipi bribes her with a car. They later learn from Ned that Yashvi was never going to move in with him, and Shane explains to Dipi that he does not like the person Yashvi is becoming, which she overhears. When Yashvi fails an English essay, Shane blames Ned for distracting her and asks him to break up with her. However, Yashvi tells him that she was unable to concentrate because she overheared him. They soon reconcile their differences. New Erinsborough High student Mackenzie Hargreaves (Georgie Stone) shows an interest in Shane and Yashvi suspects that she might be Shane's daughter, after finding a photo of him and Mackenzie's mother. Mackenzie soon reveals that she has asked Shane to help find her father Grant Hargreaves (Paul Mercurio), and that she and Yashvi used to know each other in primary school, but Mackenzie was known as Michael and has since transitioned. Shane defends Mackenzie when Ollie Sudekis (Ellmir Asipi) makes transphobic comments towards her by grabbing the boy and pushing him up against a wall. Ollie's mother decides not to take the matter further after learning what her son said. Shane becomes invested in finding Mackenzie's father, and soon gets a lead. He also realises that he played a part in their estrangement and explains to Mackenzie that her father told him about her feminine belongings and he encouraged Grant to get rid of them, which resulted in Grant burning them. Mackenzie feels betrayed and Yashvi tells him that she is ashamed of him. Grant soon contacts Shane and comes to Erinsborough to meet Mackenzie, but when he admits that Mackenzie is and always will be his son, Shane admonishes him for being narrow-minded. When Grant leaves town, Shane takes his place in the father-daughter dance at the school formal. Toadie and Shane fall out when Toadie helps Kirsha with a scholarship application to a school in Sydney. When Kirsha is accepted into the school, Dipi initially refuses to let her go, but Shane realises that it will be good for Kirsha. Once she leaves, Dipi turns on Shane and Toadie and blames them for Kirsha leaving. Shane later tries to get in between Dipi and Gary's friendship, having notices their closeness. Shane's co-worker Roxy Willis (Zima Anderson) confides in him about being a donor match for David Tanaka (Takaya Honda) and he provides her with advice and support. Dipi becomes concerned about their friendship, especially when Shane drops everything to help a drunken Roxy, but he assures her that they are just co- workers. When he notices Sheila has put himself and Roxy on different shifts, Shane accuses Dipi of interfering, but Sheila admits that she changed the rosters. When Shane fills in for another co-worker, Roxy kisses him at the end of their shift. He quickly leaves, and later says that he plans on telling Dipi what happened, but Roxy begs him not to. Roxy eventually tells Dipi about the kiss, causing tension between Shane and Dipi, who moves in with the Cannings. Karl provides Shane with unwanted updates about Dipi and Gary, and later tells him that he saw Dipi kiss Gary. Shane confront his wife, but they both realise that neither of them wanted to hurt the other and reconcile. Following Gary's death, Shane struggles to support a grieving Dipi. He is later offered an accelerated degree program at Eden Hills University, and the Rebecchis take in Mackenzie when her aunt moves out of town. Shane contacts Grant upon Mackenzie's 18 birthday and learns that he has had a workplace accident. Grant comes to Erinsborough to legal advice from Toadie and Shane admits to Dipi that he loaned Grant some money, which causes tension between them. Shane also clashes with Ned, who has quit his job to focus more on his art and took a small loan from Dipi. Shane becomes stressed with his university assignments and work, leading him to take amphetamines. His behaviour changes and he is noticeably tired. Roxy learns about Shane's addiction when she finds some of his drugs in The Waterhole bathroom. He admits that he felt wiped out by his university course and needed a way to stay up all night. Roxy urges him to tell Dipi, but he refuses. He later decides to go cold turkey, but he struggles with withdrawal symptoms and Roxy tries to help him with mindfulness techniques. Shane begins taking drugs again and angrily insults Roxy when she finds them in his bag. He also misses a romantic dinner with Dipi to buy more pills from his study partner River Hanlon (Andrew Coshan). When Roxy attempts to throw his pills down the sink, Shane physically grabs her arm and wrestles the bag off her. Roxy cries out and Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan) intervenes and demands an explanation. Shane is unable to say anything and Kyle tells Dipi what happened, which causes her to think that Shane has been suffering with depression. She and Toadie stage an intervention and urge Shane to get help, so he tells them that he will go and stay with Stonie in Colac. Toadie later learns what has been happening from Roxy and he finds Shane hiding out in a shed in Bourke. He brings him home, where Shane tries to get through his wedding anniversary dinner with Dipi, but eventually tells her he is a drug addict. He explains that he started using Richie Amblin's (Lachlan Millar) ADHD medication, before River offered him something stronger. Yashvi is forced to take Shane to the police station for questioning, while Dipi arranges for him to go to rehab. Shane ends up leaving rehab early and tries to work on his beating his addiction himself. Development=Early history Shane was originally played by Greg O'Meara. He was introduced as a member of the newly created Rebecchi family, which consisted of his younger brothers Stonefish Rebecchi (Anthony Engelman), Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney), and their parents Angie Rebecchi (Lesley Baker) and Kevin \\"Big Kev\\" Rebecchi (Don Bridges). The character's first stint ends with him going to prison for a series of robberies, before he escapes and returns to Erinsborough, where he asks Stonie to hide him at Number 32. Despite Shane's pressure, Stonie is reluctant to abuse his housemates' trust. Shane eventually returns to prison, after turning himself in at Stonie's request, as it was \\"the right thing to do.\\" Reintroduction On 27 March 2017, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy reported that Shane was being reintroduced to Neighbours after 22 years, with actor Nicholas Coghlan cast in the role. Coghlan told a writer for Woman's Day that he was honoured to join the Neighbours cast and become a member of the Rebecchi family. He later explained that as he grew up in the same area where the show is filmed, he felt that securing the role was \\"a sort of homecoming\\" for him. He also admitted to surprising himself with how much he knew about his character's family history. Coghlan filmed his first scenes at Pin Oak Court, the outdoor location for Ramsay Street, where Shane meets up with Toadie and his young daughter Nell Rebecchi (Scarlett Anderson). Coghlan said he \\"hit the ground running, it was really fast and furious.\\" Coghlan made his debut as Shane during the episode broadcast on 17 April 2017. Shane's wife Dipi Rebecchi (Sharon Johal) and daughters Yashvi Rebecchi (Olivia Junkeer) and Kirsha Rebecchi (Vani Dhir) were also introduced alongside him, as part of \\"a major expansion\\" of the Rebecchi family. Of bringing back Shane, the show's executive producer Jason Herbison stated \\"Shane Rebecchi is one of the great untapped characters from Neighbours history. I'm delighted to welcome him back to Ramsay Street along with his beautiful wife, two children and sister-in- law, it's a great new chapter of the Rebecchi family.\\" The new Rebecchis are an Indian-Australian family. Herbison said that he and the other produces felt it was important that the family \\"reflect the cultural diversity of the community and our audience.\\" The commissioning editor for the show's UK broadcaster Channel 5, Greg Barnett added that \\"It's great to be expanding the Rebecchi family further. There'll be drama and intrigue from the moment they arrive.\\" =Characterisation= The character was given a backstory explaining his time away from Erinsborough. It states that after Shane was rehabilitated and released from prison, he decided to move to Bourke, as he was too ashamed and proud to ask his family for support. While selling farming machinery, Shane met and married waitress Dipi, and they had three children together. Shane is an inventor and he enjoys working on his latest projects in his shed. He is also passionate about bush poetry, which he likes to perform after having a few drinks. Coghlan explained that Shane has worked hard to turn his life around, and he now wants to be a good brother to Toadie. Coghlan used his own personal experiences as \\"a bad boy\\" to help him with the role, commenting \\"I always seem to get myself into silly situations, thankfully never to the degree that Shane has been caught up in!\\" Coghlan thought Shane had grown up and matured since his early days on the show, and said he was calmer and no longer desperate. Coghlan also called his character \\"pretty fun loving\\", and protective of his family, who he puts \\"at the heart of everything he does\\". Coghlan added \\"There's something in Shane that worries that he's not good enough as his brother Toadie is a successful lawyer; he feels as if he hasn't reached his full potential.\\" Like the other members of his family, Shane has a fish nickname ‚Äì Pufferfish. He is often styled in flannelette shirts and a stockman hat. In July 2020, Coghlan called for the introduction of Shane and Dipi's son Jay Rebecchi, who has often been mentioned by his on- screen family. Coghlan explained that Jay is Shane and Dipi's middle child and he is away at a Sydney boarding school. Coghlan thought Jay's introduction would be good for his character, saying \\"I think a bright, young, male energy would be really good in that house. Shane is dominated by the women in the family. Someone who can bring out the silliness and 'House of Trouser' in Shane and his little brother, Toadie. That would be pretty fun.\\" He added that Jay could also bring an element of comedy to the Rebecchi family and tap into their playful nature. =Early storylines= Coghlan told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap that Shane comes back to Erinsborough to support Toadie during his \\"time of need\\", following his marriage breakdown. He uses the opportunity to avoid some financial problems back home in Bourke. Lesley Baker reprised her role as Toadie and Shane's mother Angie, as it emerges that she sent Shane to check up on Toadie. Coghlan explained that while Shane wants to be supportive towards his brother, he makes some mistakes such as telling Toadie that he saw his estranged wife Sonya Rebecchi (Eve Morey) kissing Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor). Shane is accompanied to Erinsborough by his sister-in-law Mishti Sharma (Scarlet Vas), who helps him organise a potential move to the town. Coghlan told Ellis that Shane and Mishti have a close friendship and they share some serious confidences. Writers gave Shane and his family immediate links with the show's other characters, as Shane rents Number 32 Ramsay Street for his family and takes over the lease of local business, Harold's Caf√©. His wife and daughters then arrive to the news that they are moving to Erinsborough. Coghlan commented that Shane wants his family to fit in. Another early storyline for the character focused on his invention of a solar-powered lawnmower and attempts to sell it to investors, which Kilkelly noted was \\"trickier than planned.\\" The plot also involves Shane's family, who ask Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson) to help market the lawnmower. He comes up several ideas on how to make it more marketable, including naming it Rolli. During a test run at Lassiters Lake, the lawnmower is accidentally driven into the lake, which leaves Shane in \\"a total slump\\" and feeling like a failure. He tells Dipi that he wants to give up on his hobby, as he has already invested too much time and money in it. Feud with Gary Canning During a \\"downward spiral\\", Shane ends up fighting with neighbour Gary Canning (Damien Richardson), which starts a feud between them. Shane is \\"feeling useless\\" after sustaining a hand injury while protecting Kirsha from being hit by a bike, but he hopes a meeting with entrepreneur Levi Jansen (Sam Allen) will result in Levi investing in his latest invention. However, he is left \\"mystified and somewhat miffed\\" when Levi cancels and the resulting low self- esteem leads him to get drunk. When Shane learns that it is Gary's fault for Levi's departure, he angrily confronts him in the street. Vas said that Shane goes around \\"kicking bins, yelling and threatening Gary\\", forcing her character to arrest him and causing a rift in the family. Vas told an Inside Soap columnist \\"Shane is clearly in the wrong on this occasion, and if Mishti didn't do her job properly, it would be very obvious to her superiors.\\" Vas also said that Dipi is \\"fuming\\" about the arrest and believes Mishti should have gone easy on Shane, as he is family. But Vas pointed out that Mishti's job is to protect the public and she has to be a police officer first, and a sister second. The second instance of the characters clashing occurs after Gary accidentally attacks Dipi on New Year's Eve, leaving her hospitalised. The men have another \\"Ramsay Street showdown\\" when Shane finds Gary apologising to and bonding with Dipi in his house. Shane \\"unleashes his anger\\" at Gary and physically manhandles him outside and throws him into the street. Some viewers believed that the friendship between Dipi and Gary would lead to an affair storyline for them, but Johal dismissed the theory saying that they were not well matched. The storyline was revisited in 2019, as Shane becomes jealous over Dipi and Gary's friendship. Things between Shane and Dipi are strained by Kirsha's departure for a Sydney school and his decision to help Toadie with a lawsuit against Lassiters, which could affect Dipi's business. Dipi \\"seeks solace\\" in Gary, who is going through a break up, and they spend a lot of time together. Shane catches them when he attempts to apologise and he \\"begins to resent their closeness\\" when Dipi helps Gary out at his restaurant, The 82. Shane then decides that he will \\"cause some chaos\\" in their friendship. Friendship with Roxy Willis Writers formed a friendship between Shane and his co-worker Roxy Willis (Zima Anderson), after she confides in him about being a match for David Tanaka (Takaya Honda), who needs a kidney donor. Shane advises Roxy that she needs to make a quick decision about whether to become a donor or not, as David does not have much time. Anderson said that Roxy hopes Shane will \\"give her some guidance because she does respect him, love him and love to work with him\\". When asked if Roxy could lead Shane astray, Anderson told Inside Soap's Alice Penwill that Roxy's excitement often leads her to do \\"some crazy things\\", so there was a chance that she and Shane would \\"get up to mischief\\" as he has fun with her. Anderson described the relationship between the two characters as \\"a great little friendship\\", and thought it was interesting as it was unexpected. She felt that she and Coghlan shared a similar bond to their characters and said that he was easy to work with and always there for her. Anderson later said that Roxy and Shane were \\"an odd match\\", but he allows her to be herself and he feels comfortable enough to be himself around her. The close friendship between the pair leads Roxy to kiss Shane, affecting his marriage. The development comes after Roxy and Shane's boss Sheila Canning (Colette Mann) attempts to keep them apart at work, having noticed their bond. However, her plans fails when the pair are left to work alone one night, which leads to Roxy kissing Shane. Shane is taken by surprise and he pulls away, before leaving. He later tells Roxy that he wants to confess everything to Dipi, but Roxy asks Shane to keep it to himself, as she does not want to be known as a \\"homewrecker\\". Anderson thought that Roxy was a little hurt by Shane wanting to tell Dipi. She continued \\"The last thing she wants is to upset anyone. As long as Shane's happy, though, that's all that Roxy cares about.\\" Dipi learns of the kiss from Roxy and moves in with the Cannings, leaving Shane wondering if he will be able to win back his wife. Johal said that the kiss had caused \\"a breach of trust\\" in Shane and Dipi's marriage, and pointed out that Shane has history of not telling Dipi things up front. She continued \\"Dipi feels betrayed by the person she loves most in the world. By Shane not telling her about it himself, she was put in a situation where she ended up being humiliated publicly.\\" As scenes showing Gary supporting Dipi aired, Alice Penwill of Inside Soap speculated that Shane might have something to worry about. But Johal told her that despite the grief Shane gave her over their friendship, Dipi truly sees Gary as a platonic friend; he just understands how she is feeling. Johal also said that Shane and Dipi's marriage is not \\"dire\\", but Dipi is concerned about their difficulties in communicating. She called them \\"an incredibly strong couple\\" who had lost their way. The characters' marriage comes under further strain when Dipi kisses Gary. She is \\"mortified\\" by her actions and vows to tell Shane straight away, but their neighbour Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), having witnessed the kiss, gets there first. Drug addiction Producers used the character to portray the social issue of drug addiction, as part of a larger storyline surrounding drug dealing in Erinsborough. Georgie Stone, who portrays Mackenzie Hargreaves, teased the storyline in a July 2020 interview, saying \\"Shane is starting to go through a very difficult time because of uni and he is so stressed and taking it out on the people around him ‚Äì and because Mackenzie is at home recovering, she seems to be in the frontline of his outbursts.\\" Shane's behaviour is the result of buying and taking \\"illicit pills\\" to help him keep up with his university coursework. He panics when Yashvi, who is a new police constable, conducts a search at the local high school, following reports of dealing. Coghlan told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap that hearing Yashvi has been working on the drug dealing case gives Shane \\"the frights\\" and it is a small wake up call to what he has been doing. Coghlan pointed out that like most addicts, he feels that he has his drug taking under control. Shane struggles to hide his drug use from Dipi, but she starts to notice that he has not been acting like himself. Coghlan was excited to receive the storyline, telling Radio Times' Johnathon Hughes that it was \\"something big and meaty to get my teeth into\\". He later explained to Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Shane had not had an \\"'A-storyline' or story arc\\" since his introduction, and the majority of his plots had been on the fun side. Coghlan felt the serious nature of the storyline had tested him. He told Kilkelly \\"It's probably the first time I've really been put through my acting paces in a real sense. So it's good. It's been a long time coming, I suppose, but it's been really good to stretch the muscles.\\" The actor also told Kilkelly that the storyline appears to resolve quite quickly, but it is only the beginning of a longer term arc. He commented that there is \\"a lot of trauma to be explored in this storyline, on lots of different characters.\\" Coghlan believed the plot tapped into the character's past, saying \\"Because of Shane's criminal past in his backstory there's always been a darkness that needed to be revealed at some point. Maybe this is just the beginning!\\" Coghlan told Hughes that stress over his studies was the main reason Shane started using drugs, as well as difficulty coping with everyday life. In addition to those issues, Coghlan also felt that plans for Shane and Dipi's 20th wedding anniversary contributed to Shane's notion that he is a failure, and stated that Shane has \\"a warped sense of masculine pride\\". Coghlan later explained that his character suffers from low self-esteem, and he feels worthless and like \\"he hasn't amounted to much in his life\\". He also worries about being judged by people, but especially his wife. Getting his degree would mean that he has been successful at something. He added \\"The course that he's taking is an accelerated programme ‚Äì it's three years compressed into one or something like that! So the pressure is great and he's not coping.\\" The actor confirmed that Shane initially took ADHD medication, before moving onto amphetamines to help him stay awake. Describing Shane's mindset about the drugs, Coghlan explained \\"This is typical impulsive behaviour from Shane, he has no concept of consequences and acts out based on a current need. He thought it wouldn't do much harm and he'd deal with the fallout later.\\" Roxy also becomes involved in the storyline, after she finds a bag of drugs in men's bathroom at The Waterhole and Shane admits that they belong to him. Roxy demands that Shane gets clean or she will tell Dipi, so Shane decides to go cold turkey in a hotel room. When asked how Shane gets Roxy to keep his secret, Coghlan replied that like any good addict, he bargains with her and tells her about his plan to go cold turkey. Coghlan called it \\"a complicated exchange\\", and believed that Shane was abusing his friendship with Roxy, as he knows she trusts him. He continued, \\"Their dynamic is reversed, Shane is now the wrongdoer, he is the child and Roxy is the adult!\\" Coghlan praised the scenes for being an \\"interesting progression of the relationship\\" and for continuing the exploration of the characters. He also said that things would get worse as Shane continues to manipulate Roxy, calling Shane's actions \\"fairly brutal\\" and \\"incredibly cruel\\" as he attempts to stop her from revealing his secret. Coghlan doubted if Shane could come back from what happens. Shane is overwhelmed by the withdrawal effects, so he \\"doesn't try very hard\\" despite Roxy's help. Coghlan told Ellis that Shane also has some underlying psychological issues that he has to address. He added that Shane is so keen on keeping his addiction from Dipi that he does not consider his friendship with Roxy might be an issue with her. In an interview with Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly, Coghlan was hopeful that Shane and Dipi would be able to work things out, but warned that it would be difficult and \\"a long road ahead for them as a couple, regardless of what's happening.\\" Reception The character's earlier appearance and storylines led a writer for Inside Soap to brand him a \\"dodgy\\" character, while a columnist for Women's Day dubbed him \\"notorious\\". They also commented that the other Ramsay Street residents \\"should be on high alert\\" due to his reputation. Radio Times writer Johnathon Hughes said Shane and his family's introduction hailed \\"a whole new era for Neighbours' classic Rebecchi clan\\". The character's arrival also led to a reporter for the Liverpool Echo to comment that \\"he's about to make a very big splash indeed.\\" Critics thought the character's reappearance was good for Toadie. Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap wrote \\"Shane's support is exactly what Toadie needs right now, so the arrival of even more Rebecchis can only be good news for him.\\" Shane's arrival was also chosen as of \\"The best bits of April\\" in the Inside Soap Yearbook 2018. Calling him one of the month's \\"great additions to soapland\\", a writer stated \\"There was finally something for Toadie to smile about, when his big brother Shane rocked up on Ramsay Street!\\" Ben Fenlon of the Daily Express observed that Shane's solar- powered lawnmower \\"continued to provide light relief for viewers\\" amongst the dramatic storylines. An Evening Chronicle reporter thought Shane's urine-to- water converter \\"has plenty of potential\\", but they warned \\"launching it at the same time as Dipi's investor lunch for Flapper! The Musical is probably not the best of ideas.\\" Shane's anger towards Gary led Fenlon's colleague Charlie Milward to brand him \\"hot-headed\\". Bridget McManus of The Sydney Morning Herald called Shane Mackenzie's \\"biggest Erinsborough champion\\", as she reviewed their scenes together. Alex Davies noted fans of the show were \\"captivated\\" by Shane and Roxy's \\"will-they-won't-they romance\\", and he found that viewers hoped the pair would take things further. As scenes of Dipi kissing Gary aired, Katie Baillie of the Metro observed that Shane and Dipi's \\"marriage appears to be doomed. If it's not Shane kissing the Neighbours, it's Dipi.\\" Radio Times' Johnathon Hughes said drug addiction was \\"a shocking new storyline\\" for the \\"lovable dad\\".

It is extinct, and has not been seen since 1897. Taxonomy and description Ornithologist Robert Ridgway initially described the Guadalupe wren as a species in its own right, Thryomanes brevicauda. Its closest relative may be the mainland Bewick's wren subspecies T. b. correctus, which the Guadalupe wren closely resembled. Indeed, brevicauda mainly differed from correctus in its narrower tail bars, smaller size, shorter tail, and longer bill. Biology The diet of the Guadalupe wren remains poorly known. One collected specimen had two insects, and another contained an insect and some pine seeds. Guadalupe wrens likely foraged in the scrub habitat on the island. Their nest has never been found, nor have any eggs. The subspecies was a reclusive yet active one, quickly moving about among dense branches from fallen trees. Extinction The Guadalupe wren was last seen alive in 1897 by researcher Henry Kaeding. Though the reason for its extinction is not clear, introduced species likely led to the bird's decline. Goats introduced to Guadalupe preferentially fed upon the sagebrush plants relied on as foraging habitat by the wrens, and introduced cats may have fed upon them. It is also possible that specimen collection may have also played a role in the extinction. The last known individuals were encountered in Monterey pines on the northern ridge of Guadalupe.

It is based on a short story written by Colombian novelist Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez in 1976 and published in 1992 as part of his collection of short stories titled Doce Cuentos Peregrinos (Strange Pilgrims). The plot follows the title character, a German governess hired to look after two unruly boys whose parents have taken a six-week vacation. By day, Miss Forbes runs the household with oppressive discipline but at night she displays a behavior more troubling than the one shown by the children who resist her authority.Schwartz, Latin American Films, p. 261  Plot  Eduardo and his wife are a well to do couple staying in a summer seaside house in Yucatan. They are spending part of the summer months there with their two unruly children: Mauricio and Sandro who are nine and eight years old. The household is completed with the superstitious indigenous cook and a local young fisherman who serves as the children underwater swimming instructor. As the couple leaves for six weeks to take a cruise from Miami, the mother hires Mrs. Forbes, a German governess, to take care of the children while the parents are away. Mrs. Forbes arrives by boat after a long trip and she is immediately instructed by the mother to impose \\"law and order\\" in the house and to treat the undisciplined and rude children severely in an attempt to improve their ways. Once in charge, Mrs. Forbes treats the children with formality, displaying an authoritarian and repressive temperament. She subjects the children to iron discipline, fueling a deaf resentment in them. Mauricio, the oldest brother, is more pliable, but Bruno, the youngest takes more time to follow Mrs. Forbes commands. Spying on her at night, the brothers discover that she walks around the house drinking alcohol, eating sweets, and reading loud strange passages in German. From her arrival, Mrs. Forbes is smitten with Aquiles, the hunky young scuba instructor who spends a great deal of time around the house playing with the children and at sea with them while wearing very little. Eating up by a burning desire for Aquiles, Mrs. Forbes sets her yes on seducing him. She tells him the mythological story of the impossible love between his namesake, the Greek warrior Achilles, and Penthesilea, Queen of the Amazons, who loved each other in spite of being enemies. Although well put together, Mrs. Forbes is at least 15 years his senior, and Achilles is repelled by her advances. Only after much insistence, Aquiles accepts her invitation to go to town for drinks one night. There, she opens up to him. She strips her soul and exposes her true self. She hates order and restrain and rather would like to be free, drink, live a love. She actually does not believe in what she has been imposing on the children. Aquiles remains indifferent. It is Achilles who hides a secret. He is always reluctant to anyone, even the children who are close to him, to go near his seaside rustic cabin. The following night, Mrs. Forbes plunges into the ocean and arrives swimming to Aquiles's house. She enters secretly only to find Aquiles naked in the company of a male lover. Before leaving undiscovered, Mrs. Forbes sets the house on fire with the two men inside. By the next morning over breakfast, Mrs. Forbes receives a letter that shakes her, but its content remains unrevealed. Afterward, when she gives the orders of the day to the children they have had enough of her and disobey. Reaching her breaking point, Mrs. Forbes also gives on them. They can do whatever they want. All along since Miss Forbes forced the two boys to eat moray, the same fish that they were terrified of when it was nailed to the door of the house, the children have planned to killer her poisoning her tequila. The idea came from Sandro, the more resolute of the two boys. Mauricio warns him that they could end up on the electric chair, but Sandro is determined. First, there is not electric chair in Mexico and secondly, he would make sure nobody would find out. The brothers poison the tequila and the next morning, waking up late and not seeing Mrs. Forbers around, they believe that their plan has been a success. The children cheerfully celebrate their regain freedom going scuba diving on their own. At their return, the beach house is in turmoil. Mrs. Forbers has been killed, stabbed many times. Mauricio and Sandro manage to avoid the police who guard the crime scene and enter the governess's bedroom. They see her lying death surrounded by blood with multiple stabs and cuts instead of the poisoned tequila the boys planned her to drink. In death, Mrs. Forbes face has an expression of unsettling serenity. She seems to be happy at last.

Garc√≠a M√°rquez wrote the outlines of the scripts and the making of them was given to directors from Ibero-America. The films were grouped under the name Amores Dificiles (Difficult Loves) (1987/88) and are formed by:Milagro en Roma (Colombia, directed by Lisandro Duque Naranjo, Yo soy el que t√∫ buscas (Spain, directed by Jaime Ch√°varri; Un domingo feliz (Venezuela, directed by Olegario Becerra); Cartas del parque (Cuba, directed by Tom√°s Guti√©rrez Alea); F√°bula de la bella palomera (Brasil, directed by Ruy Guerra); and the Mexican film, El verano de la se√±ora Forbes directed by Jaime Humberto Hermosillo). The films were intended for television, but shot in 35 millimeters so that they could have theathrical release.Schwartz, Latin American Films, p. 262 The Summer of Miss Forbes was a film adaptation of El verano feliz de la se√±ora Forbes, (Miss Forbes's Summer of Happiness), a short story written by Colombian novelist Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez in 1976 and published in 1992 as part of his collection of short stories titled Doce Cuentos Peregrinos (Strange Pilgrims). The focus of the short story and the film are dissimilar. While the original short story takes the point of view of the narrator, one of the boys, the film centers on the governess and the apparent duality of her personality. The character of Aquiles, the handsome fisherman, was further developed and took an important role in the film as the love interest of Mrs. Forbes. In the original tale, which takes place in Italy instead of Yucatan, Achilles was named Orestes. The change of name allowed to introduce the parallel story of the Greek hero and Penthisela as narrated by Mrs. Forbes. The reasons behind Mrs Forbes assassination remain unexplained in the short story while the film shows an underwater dream-like sequence in which Aquiles, who was seen throughout the film with a knife attached to one of his legs, uses it to stab the governess.

Most of the line was originally constructed during 1850‚Äì1860 by the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, with a small portion in the center opened in 1880 as the Charlottesville and Rapidan Railroad. The line is mainly used for freight service, but Amtrak's Crescent and Cardinal passenger services use all or part the line, and the Virginia Railway Express Manassas Line commuter service uses the northernmost portion of the line.  Route  It begins at the AF Tower in Alexandria where it splits from the CSX Transportation RF&P; Subdivision. It connects to the B-Line near Manassas. At Orange the Buckingham Branch Railroad's Washington Subdivision splits and forms a loop which crosses the Washington District again at Charlottesville. It crosses the CSX James River Subdivision, and then ends at Lynchburg, becoming the NS Danville District. Significant bridges along the route occur at the Rappahannock, Rapidan, South Fork Rivanna, Tye, and James Rivers. The Rivermont Tunnel is immediately adjacent to the James River crossing.  History  The Orange and Alexandria Railroad (highlighted) in 1852. The Washington District follows these two segments plus an additional bypass line connecting them that was built in 1880. The line was originally constructed by the Orange and Alexandria Railroad. The portion north of Orange was constructed during 1850‚Äì1854. The extension south to Lynchburg was completed in 1860, with a short section in between that was part of the Virginia Central Railroad. After the Civil War, the company came under the control of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. After series of mergers, by 1881 the line was part of the Virginia Midland Railway, which in 1886 was leased to the Richmond and Danville Railroad. Both were merged into the Southern Railway in 1894, forming part of its main line. The Southern Railway later acquired the Charlottesville and Rapidan Railroad, which had opened in 1880, bypassing the former Virginia Central Railroad segment (which is now the Buckingham Branch Railroad's Washington Subdivision). The Southern Railway merged into Norfolk Southern in 1982.  Service  The line is part of Norfolk Southern's Piedmont Division. It is mainly used for freight service. As of 1999, major customers included a Pepco generating plant in Alexandria and a Cargill grain elevator in Culpeper. Amtrak's Crescent uses the entire line as part of its New York City-to-New Orleans service, and the Cardinal uses the portion from Alexandria to Orange as part of its New York City-to-Chicago service. In addition, the Virginia Railway Express Manassas Line uses the northernmost portion of the line from Alexandria to the Broad Run station just past Manassas.

It was released as the second track of side three of his double album Blonde on Blonde on 20 June 1966. The song was written by Dylan, and produced by Bob Johnston. It was recorded at Columbia Music Row Studios, Nashville on 9 March 1966. As of August 2020, Dylan has never played the song live in concert, and it is the only track from Blonde on Blonde not to have been played by him in tour rehearsals. Background and recording In October 1965, Dylan recorded two versions of a song called \\"Medicine Sunday\\" in New York with Robbie Robertson, Garth Hudson, Rick Danko, and Richard Manuel of The Band, both versions consisting of one verse and chorus, and neither lasting more than a minute. Several months later, on 9 March 1966 between 9:00 pm and midnight, four versions of \\"Temporary Like Achilles\\" were recorded by Dylan and a band. \\"Temporary Like Achilles\\" finishes with the lines \\"You know I want your lovin‚Äô/Honey, but you‚Äôre so hard\\", a reworking of \\"I know you want my lovin‚Äô/Mama, but you're so hard\\" from \\"Medicine Sunday.\\" Take 4 was released on Blonde on Blonde, and Take 3 was later released on The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965‚Äì1966. The song is described as a \\"slow, smoky blues\\" by Gill. It seems to be narrated by someone who has been rejected by a woman who is now with another person. In 1987, lyrics for \\"Temporary Like Achilles\\", handwritten by Dylan, were sold at auction for $7,577. They were bought from a collector by the Minnesota Historical Society in 1988. Lyrical interpretation Classics scholar Owen Ewald has suggested that the song is inspired by the Iliad, and Thomas Strunk, noting that Dylan was a member of the Latin club at High School also believes that the classical poetry influenced Dylan, borrowing from the song in the title of his paper \\"Achilles in the Alleyway: Bob Dylan and Classical Poetry and Myth.\\" Dylan mentioned The Odyssey, and specifically Odysseus' trip to see Achilles in the underworld, in his Nobel Prize in Literature acceptance speech. Geoff Ward says that \\"the layered ironies of 'Temporary Like Achilles' or 'Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again' mock both the authenticity cult of folk music, and the waftings of the incoming hippie generation, in one swoop.\\" Critical reception The album Blonde on Blonde was positively received by critics. Craig McGregor in The Sydney Morning Herald praised the song as \\"entirely successful, uniquely and unmistakably Dylanish, a gentle and moving love song.\\" An opposing view was expressed by Norman Jopling in Record Mirror, who said in his review of the album that \\"One of the worst tracks on the set is 'Temporary Like Achilles' .... There's some good Fats Domino styled piano for the intro, but the pleading, almost whining lyric is not very special.\\" The piano on the track, by Hargus \\"Pig\\" Robbins, has been praised by Margotin and Guedson and by Gill, who calls it \\"beautifully evocative,\\" Personnel Credits adapted from the Bob Dylan All the Songs: The Story Behind Every Track book.

He himself was enslaved by the Vikings (possibly handed over by his Irish enemiesFintan Birchler: Der Heilige Fintan: ein Muster der Christlichen Vollkommenheit, 1793, p.30) and taken to the Orkney Islands, but was able to escape to Scotland. There he stayed with a bishop for two years, and became a clergyman.Fintan Birchler: Der Heilige Fintan: ein Muster der Christlichen Vollkommenheit, 1793, p.50-53 In 845 he made a pilgrimage through the Frankish Empire to Rome. From there he went to the monastery of Farfa where he lived as a monk for some time, then via Rhaetia to Swabia, or to the landgraviate of Klettgau, where he entered the service of the Alemannic nobleman Wolvene. Wolvene persuaded him after a few years to join his monastery in Rheinau as a monk, which he did in 851. From the year 856 he lived there walled in as an incluse until his death. His bones are kept in the Rheinau monastery church in the reliquary in the Fintan altar.

Designed by Steffen Thomas, the statue was unveiled in 1949 and depicts Georgia Governor Eugene Talmadge. The statue has been the subject of recent controversy given Talmadge's white supremacist and racist views.  History  Born in 1884, Eugene Talmadge served multiple terms as Governor of Georgia during the 1930s and 1940s. We was first elected to that position in 1932 and in total was elected governor a total of four times. He died in 1946 after his fourth election before taking office. He is noted for several scandals that occurred both during and after his governorships, including the Cocking affair during his third term, the Moore's Ford lynchings during his campaign in the 1946 Georgia gubernatorial election, and the three Governors controversy that occurred shortly after his death in 1946. Talmadge was also a segregationist, and during his 1946 campaign he made restoring the Georgia Democratic Party's white primary (which had recently been ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States) a key campaign issue. In 1949, Eugene's son Herman Talmadge, who had briefly served as governor during the Three Governors controversy, pushed for the installation of a statue honoring his deceased father. Steffen Thomas sculpted the statue from his studio in nearby Stone Mountain, Georgia. While initially wanting to depict Talmadge with shirt sleeves and his thumbs hooked under his suspenders, the Talmadge family felt that that would be an \\"undignified\\" image of him. The statue was unveiled on the grounds of the Georgia State Capitol by his grandsons on September 23, 1949, on what would have been Eugene's 65th birthday. The statue's right hand features six fingers, an inconsistency from the real Talmadge. Since the 2010s, Talmadge's reputation as governor has come under more scrutiny, with multiple publications criticizing the statue's placement at the Georgia State Capitol. Following the removal of a statue honoring Thomas E. Watson from the capitol grounds, publications including The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the Washington Monthly criticized Talmadge and the statue, with the latter calling him a \\"reactionary demagogue\\" and the former calling him one of several racist figures honored on the capitol grounds, which included a statue of John Brown Gordon. Further criticism of the statue appeared following the Unite the Right rally in 2017.

R√©giment d'Armagnac (Regiment of Armagnac) was an infantry regiment of the French Royal Army which served during some of the major campaigns of the War of the First Coalition until being disbanded in 1794 as a result of the reorganisation of the army the previous year. The regiment's successor, the 6√©me R√©giment d'Infanterie would see service during the Napoleonic Wars, Conquest of Algeria, June Rebellion, Franco-Prussian War, First World War, Second World War, and Algerian War before disbanding shortly after the later.  Formation  When Louis XV reviewed the French Royal Army after the end of the disastrous Seven Years' War, he insisted all regiments be equipped and organised the same way. As a result, all infantry regiments of more than two battalions, with some notable exceptions, were divided. The 1st and 3rd battalions disbanded and reformed the old regiment while the 2nd and 4th battalions formed a new provincial regiment and granted a number of precedence just below the former.Susane, Volume I, pp. 306‚Äì307, 338, 365, 398, 400, 403. Uniform of the R√©giment d'Armagnac under the 1776 uniform regulations, as shown in Digby Smith's Uniforms of the American War of Independence. One example of a regiment selected to split was the R√©giment de Navarre, which itself had just disbanded and reformed the same day to form a new Navarre regiment. The 2nd and 4th battalions of that regiment then separated to form the new R√©giment d'Armagnac, named after the historic province part of the modern departments of Gers, Landes, and Lot-et-Garonne.Susane, Volume III, pp. 84‚Äì91. On formation, the regiment adopted the following uniforms published on 21 May 1776: White jacket, black tricorne with white trim and a bourbon white bow tie, sky blue facings, sky blue lapels, aurora collars, sky blue cuffs, and white buttons.Lienhart & Humbert, pp. 37, 41, 43.Smith, Uniforms of the American War of Independence, pp. 174‚Äì181, 232.  Anglo-French War = Caribbean  On formation, the Armagnac regiment was already prepared for the upcoming Anglo-French War with the 2nd battalion based in Guadeloupe. The 1st battalion had gone to Calais in June 1776, it then passed from there to Dinan and Saint-Servan in October, in September 1777 to Brest, and there on 9 October embarked for the West Indies and colonies. On 18 December 1778, the two battalions joined together for the first time and took part in the terrible Capture of St. Lucia, where Captain de Villers was killed, Lieutenant Colonel Feydeau de Saint-Christophe, Lieutenant de Servilange, and Second Lieutenant des Ecure s were wounded. = Siege of Savannah = Towards the later end of 1779, the Continental forces were eager to re-take Savannah, Georgia, which was a launch point for many of the British raids in the area. In communication with the Continental Commander, Southern Department/Army Benjamin Lincoln a large raid was to be conducted against the city. As the Jean-Baptiste Charles, Comte d'Estaing arrived with his squadron, a small French ground force joined them. This force consisted of personnel many infantry and colonial regiments, along with a small detachment of artillery. As the squadron neared the city, it was required to stay away due to the local naval batteries and possible heavy artillery, therefore most of the troops disembarked some 5 miles away and marched to join their new American allies.Savas & Dameron, p. 14. On 15 September the first trenches were dug, and on 24 September they vigorously repulsed an attempted exit by the British. On 9 October they were again attacked, but after a fierce battle, Lieutenants Molard and Nairne de Stanlay were killed, and the French were repulsed and force to re-embark for the West Indies again. Captains Voulan, Grilli√®res, and Bonnier had been seriously wounded also during the course of the short siege.  South Indies  After its terrible expedition to Georgia, in 1780, part of the regiment boarded ships of the squadron of Lieutenant G√©n√©ral des Arm√©es Navales Luc du Bou√´xic, Comte de Guichen, which had orders to immediately set sail for the West Indies. On 17 April to the leeward of Martinique, the fleet met a force under Admiral George Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney, which led to the Battle of Martinique, and ended in a French victory. The squadron then saw two inconclusive actions on 15 May and 19 May 1780, with the battalion still acting as marines. In mid 1780, the squadron was ordered back to France, but the battalion disembarked in Martinique and remained there on garrison duties.Hannay, p. 686. In 1781, 150 grenadiers and chasseurs embarked on 8 May on with the squadron of the Comte de Grasse, and took part in the successful Invasion of Tobago. Captains Tarragon and Ristainy stood out during the invasion especially. = Battle of the Saintes = French and British ships during the Battle of the Saintes, where a detachment of the Armagnac regiment served as marines. In 1782, an important turn of events unfolded, and a detachment embarked from the first days of the year with Armand, Comte de Kersaint's squadron during the recapture of the Dutch colonies of Demerara (1 February) and Essequibo (5 December). A second detachment under the Comte de Grasse fought during the imfamous Battle of the Saintes of Dominica. Lieutenant La Brosse and Colour-Bearer Dumarchais were wounded on the Languedoc; the Second-Lieutenant Tenneguy on La Couronne, and Captain d'Aymard de Vill√© was very seriously wounded on the Diad√®me. = Sainte-Christophe = The main part of the regiment contributed to the French Invasion of Saint Christophe, where among those brilliantly cited, included Colonel de Livarot, Lieutenant Colonel Feydcau, Captains Tarragon and de Grilli√®res, Lieutenants Dumont, des Ecures, Charpy, and Descressonni√®res.  Hudson Bay  During the summer of 1782, the renowned French Admiral Jean-Fran√ßois de Galaup, Comte de Lap√©rouse was preparing a secret, and daring expedition into the heart of British Canada. This small expedition consisted of a ship of the line (74 gun Sceptre), 2 frigates (36 gun ships l'Astr√©e and the Engageante), along with some 250 elite men from the R√©giment d'Armagnac and Auxerrois regiments, along with 40 gunners of the R√©giment de Metz (artillery). Fortunately, the expedition arrived in the Hudson bay on 17 July 17, but scarcely had it entered the bay when it was surrounded by ice. The expedition eventually arrived inland on 8 August in-front of the Prince of Wales Fort. in 1782. The fort was manned by only 39 (non-military) men at the time, and the fort's Governor, Samuel Hearne, recognised the numerical and military imbalance and surrendered without a single shot being fired. The French partially destroyed the fort, but its mostly-intact ruins survive to this day. After capturing the Prince of Wales Fort, the expedition re-embarked bound for York Factory, the capital of the Hudson's Bay Company in the area. On 21 August they disembarked yet again, and after suffering incredibly from fatigue it approached the fort and walked through the gates, which were left open and caused from 2 million pounds of damage (equivalent to almost 179 Million in today's currency). On 1 September the expedition re-embarked and remained in the area under the Peace of Paris in 1783, when the forts were handed back to the British.  Revolution  Grenadier of the R√©giment de Navarre and Fusilier of the R√©giment d'Armagnac in 1789 following the 1779 uniform regulations, just before the French Revolution. After making a name for itself during the wars in the Colonies, the Armagnac regiment returned to France with an overwhelming sense of pride. On 21 July 1783, they landed in the Lorient, and immediately sent to Thionville to re-train, re-equip and recruit back to its full establishment. Because the regiment had been overseas when the 21 February 1779 ordnance was issued, it didn't gain its new uniforms until it landed back in France in 1793. This new ordnance grouped most of the line regiments into 10 \\"classes\\" of six regiments each. The exceptions were the Royal regiments, Regiments of the Princes, and the R√©giment de Picardie. Each class was divided further into two \\"divisions\\", each of three regiments. In the case of the Armagnac regiment, it was part of the 1st series and 2nd division, and uniformed as follows; white jacket, sky blue facings, sky blue lapels, white cuffs, and white buttons.Smith, Uniforms of the Napleonic Wars, pp. 42‚Äì46. They then went to Saarlouis in October 1785, which it left after a few days to move to Saint-L√¥ and Valognes, where it remained for another two years. On 1 January 1788 they arrived in Lille and formed part of the Saint-Omer camp in September. In June 1789, as the Storming of the Bastille and beginning of the French Revolution occurred, the regiment moved as far of Soissons to help restore order in Paris before it was stopped, and didn't move until May 1790, it was sent to Cond√©. In October, it moved to Givet and spent the winter there before moving in 1791 to Longwy to assist in the new fortifications being built there. It was here, on 1 April 1791 the regiment was renamed as the 6√©me R√©giment d'Infanterie de Ligne (Armagnac), although unofficially the Armagnac title remained until its disbandment in 1794. Following the French Revolution, the provisional regulations of 1 April 1791 grouped all regiments minus the foreign regiments into the same uniform category, and the uniform became; white jacket, black facings,black lapels, black cuffs, black trimmed epaulettes, and a black bicorne with the bourbon cockade and white plume.  War of the First Coalition  On 1 May 1792, the regiment arrived back in Thionville, but only stayed for a short time, for as the War of the First Coalition broke out, the regiment moved to Metz and detached its grenadiers from the 1st battalion to join the new Army of the Ardennes Arm√©e des Ardennes.  1st Battalion  The grenadiers of the 1st battalion, now in the Arm√©e des Ardennes, took part in on 23 May during the Battle of Hamptinne, Battle of Florenne, and Battle of Saint-Aubin. After the retreat of the Prussians, the whole of the 1st battalion passed to the Army of the North Arm√©e du Nord and contributed to the decisive Siege of Lille. It then served during the Flanders campaign and the Battle of Neerwinden. In April 1793, the regiment entered the garrison at Cond√©-sur-l'Escaut, where it was captured following preceding Siege of Cond√© on 13 July. The regiment was eventually exchanged in 1795, where it then joined the Home Army Arm√©e du Home where the discussion of a new constitution began in Paris leading to insurrection. Under the new constitution, all royalist lineages and attachments were lost, though the 1st battalion was able to escape being amalgamated as the 11√©me Demi- Brigade only existed on paper. The next year, in 1796, the 1st battalion was finally disbanded when it amalgamated as part of the second round of amalgamations with the 183rd Demi-Brigade, 4th Lot-et-Garonne Volunteers, 6th and 9th Volunteers of the Reserves, 1st Battalion of Manche Volunteers and 4th Battalion of Meuse Volunteers to form the 28√©me Demi-Brigade de Deuxi√®me Formation. This demi-brigade would eventually reform the old 28th Infantry, the R√©giment de Maine.  2nd Battalion  When the 1st battalion joined the Arm√©e du Nord, the 2nd battalion was left in Metz in 1792, but joined in the Defence of Thionville, where Lieutenant Colonel Berthaut was seriously wounded by a bomb on 6 September. = Palatinate Campaign = The battalion also contributed to General Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine's Army of the Rhine Arm√©e du Rhin and its conquest of the Palatinate and was garrisoned in Mainz after this successful campaign. After the admirable Defence of the City later that year, the battalion joined remained in the city until the capitulation of the garrison the next year. The Prussians carelessly paroled the garrison on the promise not to fight against the Coalition armies for one year. It was noted that the terms did not prevent the troops from being used to fight the Vendeans, so the parolees were hurried west. These 14,000 well-disciplined soldiers became the unofficially named Army of Mayence under Jean-Baptiste Annibal Aubert du Bayet. They were soon fighting with the Army of the Coasts of Brest under Jean Baptiste Camille Canclaux near Nantes.Phipps, pp. 20‚Äì22. The battalion remained in the area until the end of the year when it was transferred to the Vend√©e as the Vend√©e Insurrection began to explode. Burning of Granville, Manche, the battle which took place is widely considered the first step in the fall of the Vend√©e Revolt. = War in the Vend√©e = The battalion arrived in Nancy on 4 August after being transferred from the Rhine, and joined the new Army of the West Arm√©e du l'Oest under Fran√ßois S√©verin Marceau. On 23 August the battalion arrived in Saumur and immediately sent in pursuit of the Vendeans who had just crossed over the right bank of the Loire. The regiment then found itself involved in the Battle of Granville, Battle of Pontorson, Battle of Entrames, and Battle of Dol, where it distinguished itself during these actions over its volunteer counterparts. On 12 December the regiment was involved in the Battle of Le Mans and the L√©gion Germanique couldn't hold the town, but soon reinforced by the Armagnac and Aunis regiments. Eventually, on 2 January 1794 the battalion took part in the decisive Battle of Machecoul where the Army of Charette Arm√©e de Charette was almost completely destroyed and the vend√©ens put into a complete route by the republicans. The battalion would continue the pursuit and hunt for the remnants of the Charette army until on 22 April 1792 it amalgamated with the 9th and 12th Manche Volunteer Battalions to form the 12√©me Demi-Brigade. Eventually in 1796, the 12th Demi-Brigade amalgamated, as part of the second round of amalgamations, with the 1st and 2nd battalions of the 32nd Infantry (Bassigny), depots of the 1st and 2nd battalions of the 37th Infantry (Mar√©cchal de Turenne), 1st battalion of the 82nd Infantry (Saintonge), and 1st Battalion of the Seine Inferieure Volunteers to form the 81st Demi-Brigade de Deuxi√®me Formaiton. This demi-brigade would eventually, in 1803, reform the old 81st Infantry Regiment, formerly the R√©giment de Conti.  Garrison Battalion  On formation of the Armagnac regiment, there was a Bataillon de Marmande, which formed the garrison of the Armagnac Province. This garrison battalion was composed of militia, and organised into five companies, with its grenadier company separating in 1778 to join the R√©giment des Grenadiers Royaux de la Guyenne.Susane, Volume VII, pp. 280, 292, 302‚Äì306.  Further Lineage  As part of the second round of amalgamations in 1796, the 6√©me Demi-Brigade de Deuxi√®me Formation was formed through the amalgamation of the following (in English titles); 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 6th Demi-Brigade, 196th Demi-Brigade, part of the 3rd Paris Battalion of Second Formation, 7th and 10th (Battalion of the Museum) Paris Battalions of Second Formation, 4th Battalion of Volunteers of the Sarthe, and 3rd Battalion of Volunteers of the Eure-et-Loir. In 1803, this demi-brigade was transformed into the 6√©me R√©giment d'Infanterie de Ligne, and took over the lineage of the old Armagnac regiment. In 1814, after the first Bourbon Restoration, the regiment was transformed into the 78√©me L√©gion de Tarn, and in 1820 transformed into the 57th Infantry Regiment. On that same date, the 6th Infantry reformed from the old 12√©me L√©gion de Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne, and the lineage continued.  Uniforms  Regimental uniforms throughout the regiments' history included: File:Armagnac 6RI 1776.pngFusiliers' uniform following the 1776 regulations, issued just after formation of the regiment. File:Armagnac 6RI 1779.pngRegimental uniform following the 1779 regulations, which for the regiment weren't implemented until 1783 due to its dislocation in the Americas. The green plume and epaulette indicates this is a chassuer. File:6RI Armagnac1791.pngRegimental uniform following the Provisional Regulations of 1 April 1791, the bearskin cap, red plume, and red epaulettes indicate this is a Sergeant of the grenadier company.  Colours  A typical regiment consisted of (until 1791) two colours; Regimental Colours Drapeau d'Ordonnance and the Colonel's Colours Drapeau de Colonel, which the later normally consisted of the bourbon flag (pure white) with a light grey trimmed cross imposed throughout. The Armagnac being from a historic province with strong ties to the monarchy were able to maintain their own distinctive colonel's colours. Their colours were the normal bourbon white cross, but with golden Fleur-de- lis (golden lilles) throughout the cross. File:R√©g d Armagnac Col.pngColonel's colours showing its distinctive golden lilles throughout the light grey outlined cross. These colours were maintained until 1792 when the colonel's colours of all regiments were banished, and made-way for regimental and battalion colours respectively.
