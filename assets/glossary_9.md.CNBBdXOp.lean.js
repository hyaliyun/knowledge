The Islands is the collective name for the set of large islands south of Cape Cod in the southeast corner of the U.S. state of Massachusetts: Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard, the Elizabeth Islands, and a small number of minor islands. The Islands are the location of numerous beach resorts, celebrity second homes, and preserved buildings dating back to the whaling era. Geography Nantucket Island (together with the two smaller islands of Tuckernuck and Muskeget) constitutes the town of Nantucket; the Elizabeth Islands constitute the town of Gosnold; and Martha's Vineyard contains the towns of Edgartown, Oak Bluffs, Tisbury (including Vineyard Haven), West Tisbury, Chilmark, and Aquinnah. They are separated from Cape Cod by Nantucket Sound and Vineyard Sound, and from the South Coast by Buzzards Bay. History The disputed territory of the Islands came under absolute British control following the English acquisition of the former Dutch colony of New Amsterdam. The Islands were established as Dukes County, New York in 1683, and then in 1691 they were transferred from New York to Massachusetts and then separated into two counties: Nantucket County (consisting of Nantucket alone) and Dukes County, containing all the other islands. Originally the home of indigenous Wampanoag, the area was otherwise inhabited by only a few landlords and seafaring families until a brief golden era when local population and wealth grew immensely as a result of the Islands being the home of many commercial whalers and their crews, due to demand for blubber for use in oil lamps. The whale oil market became obsolete following the development of modern petroleum extraction, with dire consequences for local sailors and merchants, until the area was discovered as a summer colony, first by wealthy visitors from mainland New England and later from around the country and beyond. Much of the isolated rural culture of the Islands has been preserved from new construction, partly because they can be easily accessed only by ferry or aircraft due to their separation from the rest of the state by Vineyard Sound and Nantucket Sound. Although the arrival of large numbers of people as well as new homes, retailers, and restaurants has led to rising costs for many long-time residents, the unique local lifestyle is still visible in part by an occasionally emerging secession movement of variable strength. Attractions Attractions on the Islands include Flying Horses Carousel, Cape Poge Wildlife Refuge, Polly Hill Arboretum, and Troubled Shores supplemented by ample opportunities for cycling, equestrianism, fishing, sailing, and some of the finest whale watching in the world. People associated with the Islands The Islands have been a part of the lives of many noted personalities, including Mary Morrill, Mayhew Folger, Lucretia Mott, Rowland Hussey Macy, Walter Cronkite, William Styron, William Labov, Ted Kennedy, David McCullough, and Carly Simon.

The UCO holds Recognised Qualification (RQ) status from the statutory regulatory body for osteopathy in the UK, the General Osteopathic Council. The institution was granted degree awarding powers in October 2015, It was given University College status in September 2017 from the UK Privy Council and it is an exempt charity. History UCO Main Building 2018 Clinic building, 2010 UCO was founded as the BSO in 1915 by John Martin Littlejohn, an Osteopath himself, but was not incorporated until 1917 due to the First World War. Littlejohn died in 1947 and the school's direction was shaped by several people including Clem Middleton and Margot Gore. The school received charity status in 1963. In 1984 HRH Princess Anne, The Princess Royal became the institution's Patron and is currently the Chancellor. The UCO is dedicated to educating osteopaths, treating patients and pursuing osteopathic research. The University College of Osteopathy has a range of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes available to full or part-time students. The UCO also offers an Access to Higher Education Diploma (Osteopathic Sciences & Health Care) programme. This is a one-year further education course leading to a nationally recognised award. It is designed specifically for students over the age of 18 who wish to become osteopaths or to study a related healthcare discipline at degree level with little or no academic qualifications beyond GCSE level. There is also an Introduction to Osteopathic Sciences course, which is designed for potential M.Ost students who have proven academic achievement but who lack a solid grounding in the sciences. The UCO also offers postgraduate programmes. Examples include a Professional Doctorate in Osteopathy, an MSc in Osteopathy and a Postgraduate Certificate in Research Methods. It also provides an ongoing programme of continuous professional development courses. Clinics UCO students gain experience of contact with patients from the beginning of their studies. In the last two years of their M.Ost degree course, they gain practical experience by treating members of the public at the UCO's clinical centre under the supervision of tutors who are fully qualified, practising osteopaths. The UCO's clinical centre is at 98-118 Southwark Bridge Road, London SE1 0BQ. It is currently Europe's largest osteopathic clinical centre, offering over 40,000 patient appointments per year. It houses the UCO's general clinic, as well as special clinics for expectant mothers, children, people with sports injuries and people with HIV/AIDS. The UCO also has a portfolio of award-winning community outreach osteopathy clinics, which further the UCO's mission to make osteopathy available to groups of the community who might not otherwise be able to access it. These give students an even wider experience of patient contact, and provide osteopathic care to groups including older people in their home settings, homeless people, people with HIV/AIDS and children with social, emotional and behavioural problems.

Biography Born in Edinburgh, Masson came from a distinguished family of academics and thinkers. His father, Sir Irvine Masson, was a Professor of Chemistry at Durham and Vice-Chancellor at Sheffield, his grandfather, Sir David O. Masson, emigrated to Australia and became Professor of Chemistry at Melbourne while his great-grandfather David M. Masson was Professor of English Literature at Edinburgh, wrote a biography of John Milton and was a friend of Thomas Carlyle and John Stuart Mill. It was no great surprise, therefore, when Masson himself began a career in higher education. Following his graduation from Merton College, Oxford, with a degree in English language and literature he took on the post of assistant librarian at the University of Leeds in 1938. Except for a stint in the Royal Army Medical Corps during the Second World War from 1940‚Äì46, Masson remained a librarian for the rest of his working life. Following his demobilisation he took on the role of curator of special collections at Liverpool and married his wife, Olive Newton, in 1950 before returning to Leeds in 1956 to become curator of the Brotherton collection, an assemblage of (mostly) English literature including many rare books and manuscripts bequeathed to the University by Lord Brotherton of Wakefield on his death in 1930. It was during his 23 years at Leeds that he wrote his most well known short stories. Traveller's Rest, published in 1965 in New Worlds magazine, introduced Masson to his audience; a study in the uselessness of war focusing on a soldier's perceptions of reality in combat, perhaps influenced by his own experiences twenty years earlier. Six more stories followed, including A Two-Timer, the tale of a 17th-century man's revulsion at the modern, 20th-century world he finds himself in, before Masson ended his relationship with New Worlds. These seven stories were collected as The Caltraps of Time in 1968. Just three more short stories followed after 1968. These were included in the 2003 re-issue of Caltraps.... Masson also wrote several articles on the functions and effects of phonetic sound-patterning in poetry between 1951 and 1991. Masson retired in 1979 but continued to live in the city of Leeds with his wife. The couple had a daughter and three grandchildren. He died in Leeds on 27 February 2007.

He played college football at the University of Washington, and was drafted in the second round of the 1983 NFL Draft by the Cincinnati Bengals. Early years In 1978, Horton graduated early from Mount Tahoma High School in Tacoma, Washington, where he was a prep All-American. In 1999, he was named to the second-team defense of the Washington High-School Football Team Of The Century by the Seattle Times newspaper. College career Horton accepted a football scholarship from the University of Washington, where he played as a cornerback and special teams from 1980 to 1982 after a redshirt year. As a sophomore, he started 9 games. As a junior, he was a first-team All-Pac 10 selection and honorable-mention All-American. In his last year he started 9 games, missing 3 contests with an ankle injury (was replaced by Vince Newsome). He finished as a three-year starter with 10 career interceptions, 22 passes defensed, including 14 (school record) in 1981 and played in two Rose Bowls. He was also one of the top punt returners in the nation. Professional career=Cincinnati Bengals Horton was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the second round (53rd overall) of the 1983 NFL Draft. He also was selected by the Los Angeles Express in the third round (25th overall) of the 1983 USFL Draft. He earned the job as a starting cornerback by the second game of the season (5 starts) and finished with a franchise rookie record of 5 interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown. The next year, he was named the regular starter at right cornerback after the retirement of Ken Riley, posting 66 tackles and 3 interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown. In 1986, he was passed on the depth chart by rookie Lewis Billups and was moved to the nickel back role, making 55 tackles and one interception. The next year he started 8 games, while replacing an injured Louis Breeden, tallying 53 tackles. In 1988, he was moved to safety and played mainly nickel back. He recorded 26 tackles, 3 interceptions and one sack. In Super Bowl XXIII, after being up 13‚Äì6 over the San Francisco 49ers at the beginning of the fourth quarter, driving from the Bengals 10-yard line, quarterback Joe Montana threw a pass towards Billups that he dropped in the end zone. On the next play, the 49ers scored a touchdown, tying the game at 13. Towards the game's conclusion, Montana threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to John Taylor who was being covered by Horton, for a 20‚Äì16 lead with 34 seconds left and the eventual championship. He also was the team's punt returner during the game. Dallas Cowboys On March 14, 1989, the Dallas Cowboys signed Horton as a Plan B free agent with the intention of playing him at safety. He was named the starting free safety, helping anchor the secondary and calling the defensive signals. He collected 116 tackles (second on the team), 8 passes defensed (second on the team), 2 forced fumbles (led the team), one interception and one sack. In 1990, he sprained his left knee in the fourth game against the New York Giants, that forced him to miss one contest and slowed him the rest of the season. He posted 69 tackles, 6 passes defensed, one interception and 4 fumble recoveries. In 1991, he finished third on the team in tackles (105), recorded 8 passes defensed, one interception and scored in back-to-back games: a fumble return in a 21-16 win against the New York Giants and a 65-yard interception return in a 20-17 win over the Green Bay Packers. He became the first player in franchise history to score a defensive touchdown in back-to-back games and the third player (Jim Ridlon, 1964 and Larry Cole, 1968) ever to have 2 defensive touchdowns in the same season. In 1992, he started the first 7 games before tearing his right ACL (he chose not to have surgery) and missing 4 games. He was replaced with James Washington who took over the starting job. He still was able to be part of the championship team in Super Bowl XXVII. Horton was released on June 1, 1993, with the Cowboys looking to give more opportunities to Washington and Darren Woodson. He finished his career with 19 interceptions, 11 fumble recoveries, 3 sacks and 5 defensive touchdowns. Coaching career Horton began his coaching career in 1994 as a defensive assistant with the Washington Redskins. He was hired by Norv Turner, who knew him from Dallas where Turner was an Offensive Coordinator. Horton was the defensive backs coach for the Bengals (1997-01) and Detroit Lions (2002-03). He was the assistant defensive backs coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 2004-2006 before being promoted to defensive backs coach in 2007. On February 9, 2011, Horton was named defensive coordinator for the Arizona Cardinals. In 2013, Arizona head coach Ken Whisenhunt was fired, though Horton was initially retained and considered for promotion to head coach. On January 17, 2013, Horton was passed over for the promotion in favor of his former fellow assistant at Pittsburgh Bruce Arians, leading to his prompt departure from Arizona. On January 18, 2013, Horton was hired as the defensive coordinator of the Cleveland Browns. On January 18, 2014, Horton agreed to become the defensive coordinator of the Tennessee Titans. Browns coach Hue Jackson hired Ray Horton to be the Browns defensive coordinator going into the 2016 season. After a single season, Horton was fired by the Browns on January 7, 2017. He was hired as the Redskins' defensive backs coach on January 24, 2019.

A doctor and hospital administrator, Bynoe was, so far, the only woman to have been governor of one of the British Dependencies, Hilda Bynoe was the first woman Governor of a Commonwealth of Nations country, becoming Governor of Grenada, Cariacou and Petit Martinique. She spent most of her adult life as a teacher and doctor of medicine in Trinidad and Tobago.  Early life and career  Born in Crochu, Grenada, West Indies, Bynoe was educated at the village school, where her father, Thomas Joseph Gibbs, was headmaster and where her mother, sister and aunts had at one time or the other been teachers, and at St. Joseph's Convent, the island's only Roman Catholic Secondary School for girls. The first few years of adulthood were spent as a teacher at the Convent of St. Joseph in San Fernando, Trinidad, and later at Bishop Anstey High School in Port of Spain, Trinidad, as a science student. In 1944 she left for Europe to study Medicine and graduated from the University of London's Royal Free Hospital, then the London School of Medicine for Women, in 1951.  Governor of Grenada  In June 1968, she was appointed Governor of Grenada, the first woman governor in the British Commonwealth and the first Grenada native to occupy the post. She was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in 1969. In January 1974, following demonstrations calling for her resignation, Bynoe made a speech over the radio calling for public support. The Prime Minister, Eric Gairy, advised the Queen to dismiss Bynoe, accusing Bynoe of attempting to undermine the Premier's authority to recommend the appointment and dismissal of governors. Gainey then requested permission to retire from the Queen, which was granted. Personal life While still a student, she met and married Peter Cecil Alexander Bynoe, a Trinidadian RAF Officer; they had two sons, Roland and Michael. The Bynoe family returned to the West Indies in 1953 and Hilda Bynoe served in Guyana and Trinidad for the next fifteen years. In 1990, she retired to continue her writing and to assist in the care of her granddaughters Olukemi and Nandi. She continued as Patroness of several organizations, including the Caribbean College of Family Physicians, the John Hayes Memorial Kidney Foundation and the Caribbean Women‚Äôs Association.

History Grantham College was previously known as the Grantham College for Further Education. In the early 1970s there were advanced proposals by Kesteven County Council (based in Sleaford) to abolish the eleven-plus selection system in the Grantham area and use Grantham College as the only sixth form in the town. Mary Large, the Chairman of the Kesteven Education Committee, said that more young people preferred to go to college rather than stay in a school sixth form because of the 'more adult atmosphere'. In 1973 the Education Secretary, Margaret Thatcher, had to approve the plan, which involved converting her former school, Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School, into a mixed comprehensive. It was not approved. In April 1974 control of the college passed from Kesteven to Lincolnshire County Council in Lincoln. Later, in 1979, it became Grantham College of Further Education. In the early 1990s control passed to the Further Education Funding Council for England, then to the East Midlands Learning and Skills Council based at Leicester. Also in the early 1990s the college name was shortened to Grantham College, and became an Associate College of Nottingham Trent University. It is now an Associate College of the University of Bedfordshire, and Bishop Grosseteste University College, and through these it offers HND, HNC, and Foundation degree courses. The college was never officially a fully developed sixth form college, although used for that purpose; in 2008 a purpose-built sixth form college opened in Grantham at the Walton Girls High School. From September 2010 the College provided for equestrian courses at The Paddocks Equestrian Centre at Hough-on-the-Hill, a village to the north of Grantham. Structure Grantham College's Elsham House building was built by Richard Hornsby & Sons in the 1860s. The college has 77 residential places in Sedgwick Hall and Sedgwick Mews halls of residence. A satellite to Grantham College is Sleaford College, in the nearby town of Sleaford. Grantham College is accessed via the A1 and East Coast Main Line, and the A52 from the east. However, most college usage is by those who live in close proximity. Similar education is available further north from Grantham, at Lincoln College's sites in Lincoln and Newark-on-Trent, and to east at Boston College in Boston. The other nearby Lincolnshire towns of Spalding and Bourne do not have FE colleges. Notable alumni * Beverley Allitt - Serial killer nurse. * W.

Each institution is then able to recruit staff from among the pool of candidates selected by EPSO. On average, EPSO receives around 60,000-70,000 applications a year with around 1,500-2,000 candidates recruited by the European Union institutions. Selection policy=Open Competitions The selection of staff is based on a system of open competitions. They are organised by EPSO for permanent positions as career civil servants, and for a limited number of fixed term contracts in accordance with the Staff Regulations of the EU institutions, on the basis of harmonised criteria. EPSO cannot consider any application or CV submitted outside the framework of an official competition or selection procedure. The details of an open competition are set out in a Notice of Competition, which is published in the Official Journal of the European Union and made available on the EPSO website. The Notice includes information on the selection criteria, the job profile and duties involved, the number of places on the reserve list, the qualifications and experience required, and the format of the tests at each stage of the selection process. To reach a wider range of candidates in the Member States, additional information about open competitions may be published in the national press, specialised press or electronic media. EPSO also participates in recruitment fairs for graduates in the Member States. The schedule of current and planned competitions is available on the EU Careers/EPSO Website. Selection Criteria The eligibility requirements for EPSO selection procedures vary depending on the profile sought. In general, EU citizenship and thorough knowledge of an EU language plus satisfactory knowledge of a second official EU language are required. Profiles sought The majority of EU staff is made up of permanent civil servants, who are selected through a series of competitive examinations, commonly known as an open competition, which are organised by EPSO. However, many senior staff are recruited from outside the EU civil service. The EU institutions also employ staff on a temporary basis and these are also selected by means of tests organised by EPSO. The staff of the EU institutions fall into one of the following categories: Permanent officials Permanent staff is divided into three categories: administrators (AD), assistants (AST) and assistants-secretaries (AST-SC) EU Staff Regulations, retrieved 10.02.2015 The work at the EU Institutions covers a huge range of areas and types of work. Graduate level administrators' work include formulating and negotiating draft EU laws, managing EU-wide programmes, or administering aid projects in the developing world. Equally, employees might also be participating in a specific scientific research programme, or for example, drafting the decision of the European Court of Justice or the European Ombudsman. Assistants and Assistants-Secretaries contribute to implementing policies in various areas of EU activities or are responsible for secretarial and clerical work and ensuring the efficient operation of an administrative unit. They also play an important role in the internal management of the Institutions, notably in budgetary and financial affairs, HR, IT or librarianship. Contract agents EPSO also organises the selection of contract agents, who are employed for a temporary period with an initial contract running for a maximum of three to six years, depending on the type of the contract. Contract agents are recruited, for example, to do manual or administrative support‚Äìservice tasks or provide additional capacity in specialised fields where officials with the required skills are not available. Temporary agents EPSO does not organise the selection of temporary agents. The institutions' vacancy notices and employee profiles are published on the EPSO Website and sent to the Permanent Representations of the Member States. Temporary agents may be employed to perform a range of highly specialised or temporary tasks for a maximum period of six years. Career opportunities The European Civil Service offers a range of career opportunities throughout the European Union institutions. The majority of graduate opportunities are in administration and management, giving staff the opportunity to work in a variety of policy areas throughout their career. Each Notice of Competition provides a detailed description of the expected job content and qualifications or experience sought. A job may involve participating in the EU legislative processes such as drafting a new legislation to tackle climate change, shaping EU's Energy policy, interpreting and applying EU law, analysing European markets to ensure free and fair competition, participating in operations providing humanitarian aid or monitoring the application of the Lisbon strategy to achieve the growth of the European knowledge based economy. Scientists and researchers form an important base for developing the EU's research and technological development policy. As in any international and multicultural organisation, the support tasks of Human Resources, Financial Management, IT and linguists are very challenging and important for the working of the institutions. There are 24 official languages in the European Union; and so a variety of career opportunities are available to linguists (translators, interpreters, as well as lawyer-linguists (legal translators)), for example, interpreting the President of the European Parliament, the Commission and allowing the citizens to read EU legislation, Court decisions and the European Parliament or the European Council debates in their mother tongue around the European Union. Assistants may become administrators through an internal certification process and take on more responsibilities. Selection process The selection procedures were reformed in 2010. The structure of each competition and the types of tests are described in detail in the Notice of Competition. After each stage in the competition, only the highest scoring candidates (usually a pre-determined number in the Notice) who have achieved a pass mark are admitted to the next stage. When a competition is published, EU citizens are invited to apply electronically by creating their own EPSO account directly on the EPSO website. All communication with candidates is done electronically through their EPSO account. EPSO normally organises pre-selection tests in specialised test centres worldwide; therefore, candidates may select their preferred testing location at the time of online registration. The assessment phase is usually held in Brussels or Luxembourg. A Selection Board, made up of representatives of the institutions and staff representatives, is responsible for approving the content of the questions and evaluating candidates at written and oral stages of the competition. EPSO ensures that its selection procedures are fair and effective. In particular EPSO applies a policy of equal opportunities throughout the selection process. EPSO also ensures that applicants' personal data are processed in compliance with the rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data (Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000). Stages of the competition The selection procedure for permanent officials normally begins with Computer Based Testing (CBT) that comprises multiple-choice tests assessing candidates' knowledge of the European Union, and numerical, verbal and abstract reasoning skills and situational judgement. Depending on the profile sought, intermediary tests can be organised, such as translation tests, e-tray, Talent Screener (an in depth analysis of the candidates' files based on a series of specific questions)... In the assessment centre, there is normally a case study, oral presentation, group exercise and a competency based interview. EPSO does not organise courses to prepare for the different stages of the competitions but candidates can follow the courses from companies where they have the chance to simulate the different tests. For contract agents, the pre-selection stage is similar to that of the open competitions for permanent staff and consist of verbal, numerical and abstract reasoning. In addition, candidates may be asked to sit a third test to ascertain their specific competences relevant to the profile of the competition. Recruitment Recruitment is the sole responsibility of each individual institution. EPSO's task is to deliver and manage the reserve lists of qualified successful candidates. At the end of the selection process the highest-scoring candidates are placed on a reserve list for consideration by the institutions for specific vacancies. These reserve lists are published in the EPSO website and are normally valid for one to three years, with the possibility of extension. Language regime In its judgment of September 24, 2015 (joined cases T‚Äë124/13 and T‚Äë191/13), the Court found EPSO‚Äôs linguistic regime objectionable on the two grounds raised by the Italian and Spanish governments. Firstly, it held that it was unacceptable for EPSO not to communicate with candidates in languages other than the three working languages. In essence, the Court expects EPSO to ensure that candidates are able to submit their application in any of the 24 Official EU Languages and any EPSO correspondence with applicants must also be in the language they chose for their application. Secondly, the Court also annulled the requirement to choose English, French or German as the second language of the selection (essentially the language of the Assessment Centre phase). This again has been viewed as discrimination on the basis of language. For generalist competitions, each candidate must indicate at least two official languages of the European Union (minimum level required: at least one language at level B2 or higher and one language at level C1 or higher). The languages for the tests will be selected based on the candidates‚Äô choices, taking into account the interests of the recruiting services and the Institutions. In the second phase of application candidates have to indicate the two languages for the tests (chosen only from the languages previously declared during the first application phase): * Language 1: language of the verbal, numerical and abstract reasoning tests ‚Äì this can be any of the 24 EU languages for which the candidate had declared the required level (B2 level or above). This must be different from Language 2 * Language 2: language for the other tests (professional skills tests, e-tray and other assessment phase tests) and the application form during the second phase - this must be one of the five languages most frequently declared by all candidates that will be communicated to shortly after the closure of the first registration period. This language must be different from Language 1. In order to include a maximum of applicants having one of the five vehicular languages allowed for above, candidates are invited to declare all official EU languages of which they have knowledge, including their main language. EPSO will then consolidate all application forms validated by the first deadline in order to rank the languages declared at B2 level or higher in descending order and compare these with the needs of the services to ensure an appropriate fit. The 5 languages in which the situational judgment test, e-tray and the assessment centre will take place (language 2) will be determined on this basis by EPSO acting as Appointing Authority. Equality of treatment EPSO applies an equal opportunities policy and accepts applications without distinction on grounds of sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation. EPSO applies a policy of anonymity as a guarantee of equal treatment for candidates and its selection procedures are organised, to the greatest extent possible, to ensure equal treatment. The testing methods and test items are regularly assessed in terms of gender equality. The Institutions do not organise personnel selection competitions specifically for persons with a disability. However, EPSO takes all reasonable measures that facilitate participation by persons with a disability in competitions on an equal basis with the other candidates. In practical terms, EPSO proactively seeks information from candidates on the nature of their disability and proactively adapts the administration of the tests to their needs. Facilities and variety of test administration options provided to disabled candidates include the tests in Braille, on paper, with extra time, and/or are being assessed in special facilities, and where appropriate, an individual invigilator is assigned to the candidate. Criticisms The human resources policy of the EU institutions has been subject to much criticism. While there is a popular image of EU staff as over- paid, new employees may find this image hard to square with their own experience. Firstly, salaries and other benefits have been much reduced following a 2004 package of staff reforms; while salaries are relatively attractive to staff coming from new member states, the same cannot be said for many EU10 member state employees. This situation is aggravated by the EU refusal to recognise more than a minimal level of work experience earned outside the institutions, a particularly malign policy given that the average age of entry for AD5 ('graduate-level') staff in the Commission is 34 years old (2009 Commission Human Resources Report). Secondly, promotion prospects for administrators are extremely poor; the Commission's own statistics reveal that an average career progression from AD5 to AD14 (Director level) takes 35‚Äì40 years, obviously unattainable for the average entrant who joins at 34 years old. It is not unusual to find staff in their 40s and 50s performing tasks that new graduates would carry out in more dynamic organisations. Management experience in the institutions is hard to gain, and further frustrates the possibilities for EU officials to attain senior management positions. As EPSO only manages recruitment for the institutions it cannot be held responsible for staff career prospects. Instead, the challenge for EPSO is to improve the administration of open competitions ‚Äì at present, a bafflingly random way of sifting through thousands of applications to place on a list of 'qualified candidates' (rather than, say, for specific vacancies). Successful laureates have no legal guarantee of recruitment, indeed many wait years on the reserve lists without ever being offered a position. EPSO has shortened the average length of the concours from around 15 months to between 5‚Äì9 months. On 15 June, the Civil Service Tribunal of the European Union issued its ruling in case F-35/08, Pachtitis/Commission, which principally concerned the authority of the European Personnel Selection Office to set pre- selection tests.Important message to candidates of open competition EPSO/AD/177/10 on the F-35/08, Pachtitis/Commission case The cornerstone of the case was an interpretation of Annex III of the Staff Regulations, which led the Tribunal to conclude that only the Selection Board, and not EPSO, has the power to determine the content of questions for pre-selection test. Since the ruling pre-selection tests are organised under the responsibility of the Selection Board. Following the decision EPSO arranged a new competition for the approximately 36000 candidates who were excluded from the open competition EPSO/AD/177/10.

It has rough, fibrous bark on all or most of its trunk, smooth bark above, mostly lance- shaped adult leaves, elongated flower buds in groups of eleven or more, yellowish flowers and cylindrical to cup-shaped fruit. It is widely cultivated and produces one of the hardest and strongest timbers in the world.flower budsfruittrunk bark  Description  Eucalyptus cornuta is a tree that typically grows to a height of with a crown wide, sometimes a mallee to , and forms a lignotuber. New stems may fork out from the trunk or the lignotuber or multiple main stems may replace a single trunk in older specimens. It has rough, fibrous, brown to almost black bark on all or part of its trunk, smooth greyish bark above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped to more or less round leaves long, wide and paler on the lower surface. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same glossy green on both sides, usually lance- shaped, mostly long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of eleven or more on a rounded to flattened, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds usually sessile. Mature buds are elongated, long and wide with a horn-shaped operculum between four and seven times as long as the floral cup. Flowering occurs between January and May or from July to November and the flowers are yellowish green. The fruit is a woody cylindrical to cup- shaped capsule long and wide with the seeds released through slits between the valves.  Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus cornuta was first formally described in 1800 by Jacques Labillardi√®re. Labillardi√®re collected the type specimen from granite outcrops on Observatory Island west of Esperance on 13 December 1792 during the Bruni d'Entrecasteaux expedition. The description was published in his book Relation du Voyage √† la Recherche de la P√©rouse. The specific epithet (cornuta) is a Latin word meaning ‚Äúhorned‚Äù or \\"bearing horns\\", referring to the operculum of the buds. The names in the Nyungar language of southwest Australia are mo, yandil, yeit or yate. Yate is well established as a common name for this widely grown tree, and several other western species of eucalypt are so named: bushy yate E. lehmannii, flat topped yate E. occidentalis, river yate E. macrandra, and warty yate E. megacornuta. Distribution and habitat Yate occurs in an area southeast of Busselton to Cape Arid and the islands of the Recherche Archipelago. The species often occurs in isolated stands. In more arid regions near Esperance, it is often at granite outcrops, on deeper and wetter soil at cavities on the rock or the apron beneath the rockface. The species is found in a large mallee form at coastal areas, or as tall stands in areas of high rainfall and fertile soil of valleys, especially the inland region from Manjimup to the Porongurups. Vigorous early growth and the potential in its lignotuber allow it to generate new stems after fire or as new opportunities emerge in the canopy or surroundings. The form is similar to the mallee habit of smaller eucalypts in drier regions and its habit is comparable to limestone marlock, E. decipiens, which occurs to the north and east. In favourable habitat a single trunk may attain great height and it is able to compete in tall forests of jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) and marri (Corymbia calophylla) or any other species except the karri giants in Eucalyptus diversicolor forest. Uses=Use in horticulture The tree is sold commercially for use as an ornamental, shade or wildlife habitat. It will tolerate drought, moderate frost, a range of soils and in coastal areas. While it may obtain great height in its natural habitat, the species is successfully planted as a medium or small tree for shade and windbreaks, and as street trees or for highway verges. Well known as a cultivated tree throughout Australia, E. cornuta has also been introduced to California. Ferdinand von Mueller sent seed of the species to Lucknow, where the sapling grew to a height of eight to ten feet within a year and, unlike eucalypts tested, tolerated tropical rain; his 1879 report also noted the successful introduction to Melbourne. Other uses This eucalypt produces one of the hardest and strongest timbers in the world and was formerly used for wheel spokes and the shafts of horse-drawn vehicles but most trees of commercial value were logged a long time ago.

Set in an inn, the film addresses the state of the drunken mind with light heartedness. Synopsis The film begins in the interior bedroom of an inn. There enters a traveler, slightly intoxicated, accompanied by a porter, who carries his baggage. The traveler takes off his hat, his coat and his shoes. The servant places these things upon a clothes- rack in such a way that they resemble the outlines of the back of an old codger. The servant withdraws. A comedic scene follows when the drunken chap tries to light his pipe from a candlestick. The candlestick rises in the air, and the flame is put out by a portrait placed in a frame on the wall. The guest lights the candle, and he tries to light his pipe again. A second time the candlestick rises up, and the personage in the picture having become animated swallows candle and candlestick. The fellow jumps backward, bumps up against the clothes-rack. Taking his clothes for an intruder he kicks at them. The boots become animated, and kick him in return. The fellow, enraged, throws himself upon the clothes-rack, which he imagines to be a person, struggles with it and rolls upon the floor, entangled among all his clothes. He restores everything to its former place, but his boots began to dance about the room. The poor drunk man chases after them, but the boots ascend the wall and disappear in the ceiling. Tired he goes to bed. Immediately the bed begins to dance wildly about the room, then falls upon him, burying him among the covers, mattress and the pieces of the bed. He extricates himself in a rage, restores everything to order again, but just as he attempts to get into bed he finds himself suddenly thrown under it. He crawls out of bed and spies the Moon through the casement window. Believing that he has discovered an enemy he strikes the window with a broom, and the window bursts into pieces. The moon reappears on the dial of a clock; then suddenly it assumes the face of a grinning clown. The drunken fellow starts back; he stumbles against a valise. With a kick he sends the valise into the air, where it assumes the form of a demon, whom the fellow tries to catch. The furniture, washbowl, and pitcher break into pieces. Awakened by the mid-night disturbances, the hotel manager and all the guests, enter the room. Stormy explanations follow, and a battle ensues. The people follow one another, leaping through windows, pictures and mirrors. The proprietor is hit on the head by a board laden with all sorts of objects, and a large portrait falls upon his head. Finally at the moment when the drunken fellow is on the point of being seized, he disappears through a casement and takes refuge on the roof, to the astonishment of all. Production The Inn Where No Man Rests is an expanded version of an earlier M√©li√®s film, The Bewitched Inn (1897). The Moon and a manic chase, as featured in the film, are both common motifs in M√©li√®s's work. As usual for his films, the chase here is circular, within a single set; however, M√©li√®s did eventually try the linear, multi-scene chase format of his contemporaries (such as Ferdinand Zecca and Lucien Nonguet) in his film A Desperate Crime. M√©li√®s himself plays the traveler in the film. The table and pendulum are animated using stage machinery; other objects are pulled or suspended using wire, and additional effects are worked using substitution splices. The Inn Where No Man Rests was sold by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 465‚Äì469 in its catalogues.

It was a single-engine, mid-wing, cantilever monoplane of stressed-skin construction with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage and a long transparent cockpit canopy. The type had significance in being the first Japanese aircraft to be powered by a modern two-row radial engine. During the war, it was known by the Allies by the name Ann. Design and development The Ki-30 was developed in response to a May 1936 Imperial Japanese Army specification to replace the Kawasaki Ki-3 light bomber with a completely indigenously designed and built aircraft. Mitsubishi and Kawasaki were requested to build two prototypes each by December 1936. The specification called for a top speed of at 3,000 m (9,840 ft); normal operating altitude from 2,000 m (6,560 ft) to 4,000 m (13,130 ft), the ability to climb to 3,000 m (9,840 ft) within eight minutes and an engine to be selected from the Mitsubishi Ha-6 radial, Nakajima Ha-5 radial, or Kawasaki Ha-9-IIb liquid-cooled inline engines, a normal bomb load of and a maximum of , one forward-firing machine gun and one flexible rearward-firing machine gun, the ability to perform 60¬∞ dives for dive bombing, and a loaded weight less than . The first Mitsubishi prototype flew on 28 February 1937 powered by a Mitsubishi Ha-6 radial. Originally, designed with a retractable main landing gear, wind tunnel tests indicated that the gain in speed was minimal due to the landing gear's extra weight and complexity and a fixed arrangement with \\"spatted\\" main wheels was chosen instead. The wing was mounted at a point above the line of the aircraft's belly in order to fully enclose the bomb bay within the fuselage. The pilot sat just above the leading edge of the wing, and the rear-gunner/radio-operator just behind the wing trailing edge, in a long \\"greenhouse\\" canopy which gave both crewmen excellent all-around vision. The Ha-6 engine drove a three-blade variable-pitch propeller. A second prototype, fitted with the slightly more powerful Nakajima Ha-5 engine, was completed the same month. Although two months behind schedule and overweight, both prototypes met or exceeded every other requirement. The second prototype's top speed of at 4,000 m (13,130 ft) led the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force to place an order for 16 service trials machines. These were delivered in January 1938 and the result of the trials was that the Army ordered the Ki-30 into production in March under the designation Army Type 97 Light bomber. Mitsubishi built 618 production machines through April 1940, and the 1st Army Air Arsenal (Tachikawa Dai-Ichi Rikugun Kokusho) built 68 more by the time production ceased in September 1941.

The Ki-30s were first used in combat in Second Sino-Japanese War from spring 1938. It proved to be reliable in rough field operations, and highly effective while operating with fighter escort. This success continued in the early stages of the Pacific War, and the Ki-30s participated extensively in operations in the Philippines. However, once unescorted Ki-30s met Allied fighters, losses mounted rapidly and the type was soon withdrawn to second-line duties. By the end of 1942, most Ki-30s were relegated to a training role. Many aircraft were expended in kamikaze attacks towards the end of the war. From late 1940, the Ki-30 was in service with the Royal Thai Air Force, and saw combat in January 1941 against the French in French Indochina in the French-Thai War. 24 aircraft were delivered, and were nicknamed Nagoya by the crews.Garlicki, Jaros≈Çaw (2001).

History=Foundation and early years The Liberal Party (Partito Liberale) was founded in 1997 by former members of the Italian Liberal Party (PLI) and, mostly, of the Union of the Centre (UdC), as well as some former Republicans. Most of its leading figures were also members of Forza Italia (FI): Stefano De Luca, Carlo Scognamiglio, Egidio Sterpa, Ernesto Caccavale, Luigi Caligaris and Guglielmo Castagnetti.LIBERALI: STERPA PRESIDENTE, DE LUCA SEGRETARIO DEL PARTITOhttp://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1998/marzo/22/Milano_rinasce_Pli_Atteso_anche_co_7_9803222988.shtml Scognamiglio was a former President of the Senate, while de Luca, Caccavale and Caligaris were serving MEPs. In December 2004 the party was merged with other liberal groups and, as result, its name was changed to Italian Liberal Party, along with the claim of being the successor of the historical PLI, disbanded in 1994. At that point the party was completely enfranchised from FI and the centre-right House of Freedoms coalition. Enlargement and splits In June 2007, during its congress, the PLI reaffirmed its autonomy and de Luca was unanimously re-elected secretary; additionally, some leading former Liberals joined (or re-joined) the party: Carlo Scognamiglio (PLD), Luigi Compagna (UDC) and Luciano Magnalb√≤ (AN). Since that time PLI is for the first time represented in a Regional Council by Antonietta Brancati, regional deputy of Lazio, previously member of Italy of Values. For the 2008 general election Liberals tried to form an electoral pact with the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats,La Segreteria Nazionale del PLI comunica quanto segue  Comunicati Stampa  Partito Liberale Italiano but finally chose to run as a stand-alone list. In February 2009 the PLI held another congress. Arturo Diaconale, supported by Angelo Caniglia and a group of Liberal Reformers (including Marco Taradash, Emilia Rossi, Carlo Monaco and Pietro Milio) and other newcomers, presented his candidacy for party secretary in opposition to de Luca, who was supported by the old guard and by Paolo Guzzanti, a dissenting member of Forza Italia and former Socialist. De Luca was re-elected party secretary with the support of 73% of the delegates, Guzzanti was appointed deputy secretary and Scognamiglio president.http://www.informazione.it/a/EB87B450-E0E0-43E9-92E6-AA8FB07FD534/Pli- De-Luca-rieletto-segretario-Nazionale-del- Partitohttp://iovotopli.wordpress.com/2009/02/23/stefano-de-luca-rieletto- segretario-nazionale-del-pli/ In December 2010 Guzzanti left the party over personal problems with de Luca and became briefly engaged with the New Pole for Italy (NPI). In March 2011 the party was joined by two former secretaries of the late PLI, Alfredo Biondi and Renato Altissimo, and by a senator coming from The People of Freedom (PdL), Enrico Musso, who was soon appointed deputy secretary. Through Musso the party re-joined the NPI.

From centre to centre- right In April 2014 the PLI joined the European Choice list for the European Parliament election.http://www.partitoliberale.it/il-pli-con-alde/ This decision, strongly supported by de Luca, prompted Guzzanti to leave the party and stand as candidate for Forza Italia, and eventually de Luca to step down as secretary.http://www.partitoliberale.it/il-mio-saluto-ai-liberali- italiani/http://www.partitoliberale.it/consiglio-nazionale-del-12-04-2014/ The following October, during a congress, the party elected a new leadership, notably including Giancarlo Morandi as secretary, de Luca president and Daniele Toto, a former deputy of the PdL and Future and Freedom (FLI), coordinator.http://www.partitoliberale.it/10480/comunicati/10480.htmlhttp://www.agenparl.com/?p=101031 The day after, Carla Martino, long-time president and honorary president of the party, died.http://www.partitoliberale.it/10490/comunicati/carla-i- liberali-non-ti-dimenticheranno.html Subsequently, in November, Ivan Catalano, a dissident deputy of the Five Star Movement, joined the PLI, marking its return to Parliament.http://www.partitoliberale.it/10757/comunicati/lon-ivan- catalano-ha-aderito-al- pli.htmlhttp://www.ilvelino.it/it/article/2014/11/20/camera-i-catalano- aderisco-a-componente-pli-per-portare-idee-liberali-in- parlamento/3210927b-ff6f-4be6-aa6c-fd01cba729f8/http://www.radioradicale.it/scheda/427027/il- partito-liberale-italiano-ritorna-in-parlamento-intervista-a-ivan-catalano- vicepresidente-della-commiss A few months later, in March 2015, Catalano was expelled from the party for having joined the parliamentary group of Civic Choice.http://www.partitoliberale.it/11528/comunicati/lon-catalano-non-e-piu- un-deputato-del-pli.htmlhttp://www.formiche.net/2015/04/03/il-pli-espelle- catalano-passato-scelta-civica-facchettin-fvg-chiede-il-bastone- comando/http://www.formiche.net/2015/04/03/il-pli-espelle-catalano-passato- scelta-civica-facchettin-fvg-chiede-il-bastone-comando/ In the 2016 municipal election the PLI, which supported Giorgia Meloni (Brothers of Italy, FdI) for mayor, obtained 0.9% of the vote.http://www.repubblica.it/static/speciale/2016/elezioni/comunali/roma.html?refresh_cens In December 2016 Cinzia Bonfrisco (ex-PSI/FI/PdL/FI/CR) joined the PLI, giving it representation in the Senate.http://www.partitoliberale.it/13515/comunicati/liberali-ritornano-al- senato.htmlhttp://www.partitoliberale.it/13566/attivita-del-pli/direzione- nazionale-la-senatrice-bonfrisco-si-iscrive-al-pli.html In May 2017 the party's congress re-elected Morandi and de Luca as secretary and president, respectively.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are artificial neural networks that more closely mimic natural neural networks. In addition to neuronal and synaptic state, SNNs incorporate the concept of time into their operating model. The idea is that neurons in the SNN do not transmit information at each propagation cycle (as it happens with typical multi-layer perceptron networks), but rather transmit information only when a membrane potential ‚Äì an intrinsic quality of the neuron related to its membrane electrical charge ‚Äì reaches a specific value, called the threshold. When the membrane potential reaches the threshold, the neuron fires, and generates a signal that travels to other neurons which, in turn, increase or decrease their potentials in response to this signal. A neuron model that fires at the moment of threshold crossing is also called a spiking neuron model. The most prominent spiking neuron model is the leaky integrate-and-fire model. In the integrate-and-fire model, the momentary activation level (modeled as a differential equation) is normally considered to be the neuron's state, with incoming spikes pushing this value higher or lower, until the state eventually either decays or - if the firing threshold is reached - the neuron fires. After firing the state variable is reset to a lower value. Various decoding methods exist for interpreting the outgoing spike train as a real-value number, relying on either the frequency of spikes (rate-code), the time-to- first-spike after stimulation, or the interval between spikes. History Pulsed neuron model Artificial synapses based on FTJsMulti-layer artificial neural networks are usually fully connected, receiving input from every neuron in the previous layer and signalling every neuron in the subsequent layer. Although these networks have achieved breakthroughs in many fields, they are biologically inaccurate and do not mimic the operation mechanism of neurons in the brain of a living thing. The biologically-inspired Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model of a spiking neuron was proposed in 1952. This model describes how action potentials are initiated and propagated. Communication between neurons, which requires the exchange of chemical neurotransmitters in the synaptic gap, is described in various models, such as the integrate-and-fire model, FitzHugh‚ÄìNagumo model (1961‚Äì1962), and Hindmarsh‚ÄìRose model (1984). The leaky integrate-and-fire model (or a derivative) is commonly used as it is easier to compute than the Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model. On July 2019 at the DARPA Electronics Resurgence Initiative summit, Intel unveiled an 8-million-neuron neuromorphic system comprising 64 Loihi research chips.https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech- talk/robotics/artificial-intelligence/intels-neuromorphic-system- hits-8-million-neurons-100-million-coming-by-2020.amp.html Intel‚Äôs Neuromorphic System Hits 8 Million Neurons, 100 Million Coming by 2020  Underpinnings  From the information theory perspective, the problem is to explain how information is encoded and decoded by a series of trains of pulses, i.e. action potentials. Thus, a fundamental question of neuroscience is to determine whether neurons communicate by a rate or temporal code. Temporal coding suggests that a single spiking neuron can replace hundreds of hidden units on a sigmoidal neural net. A spiking neural network considers temporal information. The idea is that not all neurons are activated in every iteration of propagation (as is the case in a typical multilayer perceptron network), but only when its membrane potential reaches a certain value. When a neuron is activated, it produces a signal that is passed to connected neurons, raising or lowering their membrane potential. In a spiking neural network, the neuron's current state is defined as its level of activation (modeled as a differential equation). An input pulse causes the current state value to rise for a period of time and then gradually decline. Encoding schemes have been constructed to interpret these output pulse sequences as a number, taking into account both pulse frequency and pulse interval. A neural network model based on pulse generation time can be established accurately. Spike coding is adopted in this new neural network. Using the exact time of pulse occurrence, a neural network can employ more information and offer stronger computing power. Pulse-coupled neural networks (PCNN) are often confused with SNNs. A PCNN can be seen as a kind of SNN. The SNN approach uses a binary output (signal/no signal) instead of the continuous output of traditional ANNs. Further, pulse trainings are not easily interpretable. But pulse training increases the ability to process spatiotemporal data (or real-world sensory data). Space refers to the fact that neurons connect only to nearby neurons so that they can process input blocks separately (similar to CNN using filters). Time refers to the fact that pulse training occurs over time so that the information lost in binary coding can be retrieved from the time information. This avoids the additional complexity of a recurrent neural network (RNN). It turns out that impulse neurons are more powerful computational units than traditional artificial neurons. SNN is theoretically more powerful than second-generation networks, however SNN training issues and hardware requirements limit their use. Although unsupervised biological learning methods are available, such as Hebbian learning and STDP, no effective supervised training method is suitable for SNN that can provide better performance than second-generation networks. Spike based activation of SNNs is not differentiable thus making it hard to develop gradient descent based training methods to perform error backpropagation, though a few recent algorithms such as NormAD and multilayer NormAD have demonstrated good training performance through suitable approximation of the gradient of spike based activation. SNNs have much larger computational costs for simulating realistic neural models than traditional ANNs. Applications SNNs can in principle apply to the same applications as traditional ANNs. In addition, SNNs can model the central nervous system of biological organisms, such as an insect seeking food without prior knowledge of the environment. Due to their relative realism, they can be used to study the operation of biological neural circuits. Starting with a hypothesis about the topology of a biological neuronal circuit and its function, recordings of this circuit can be compared to the output of the corresponding SNN, evaluating the plausibility of the hypothesis. However, there is a lack of effective training mechanisms for SNNs, which can be inhibitory for some applications, including computer vision tasks. As of 2019 SNNs lag ANNs in terms of accuracy, but the gap is decreasing, and has vanished on some tasks. Software A diverse range of application software can simulate SNNs. This software can be classified according to its uses:  SNN simulation  Unsupervised learning with ferroelectric synapses These simulate complex neural models with a high level of detail and accuracy.

Experimental systems based on ferroelectric tunnel junctions have been used to show that STDP can be harnessed from heterogeneous polarization switching. Through combined scanning probe imaging, electrical transport and atomic-scale molecular dynamics, conductance variations can be modelled by nucleation-dominated reversal of domains. Simulations show that arrays of ferroelectric nanosynapses can autonomously learn to recognize patterns in a predictable way, opening the path towards unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning with ferroelectric synapses *Brainchip's Akida NSoC has effectively 1.2 million neurons and 10 billion synapses, representing orders of magnitude better efficiency than other neural processing devices on the market. *Neurogrid is a board that can simulate spiking neural networks directly in hardware.

It provides custom digital chips, each with eighteen cores and a shared local 128 Mbyte RAM, with a total of over 1,000,000 cores.https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/silicon-brains/ Neuromorphic Computing A single chip can simulate 16,000 neurons with eight million plastic synapses running in real time. *TrueNorth is a processor that contains 5.4 billion transistors that consumes only 70 milliwatts; most processors in personal computers contain about 1.4 billion transistors and require 35 watts or more. IBM refers to the design principle behind TrueNorth as neuromorphic computing. Its primary purpose is pattern recognition. While critics say the chip isn't powerful enough, its supporters point out that this is only the first generation, and the capabilities of improved iterations will become clear. (IBM)Markoff, John, A new chip functions like a brain, IBM says, New York Times, August 8, 2014, p.B1 * Dynamic Neuromorphic Asynchronous Processor (DYNAP) combines slow, low-power, inhomogeneous sub-threshold analog circuits, and fast programmable digital circuits. It supports reconfigurable, general-purpose, real-time neural networks of spiking neurons. This allows the implementation of real-time spike-based neural processing architecturesSchrauwen B, Campenhout JV (2004) Improving spikeprop: enhancements to an error-backpropagation rule for spiking neural networks. In: Proceedings of 15th ProRISC Workshop, Veldhoven, the Netherlands in which memory and computation are co-localized. It solves the von Neumann bottleneck problem and enables real-time multiplexed communication of spiking events for realising massive networks. Recurrent networks, feed-forward networks, convolutional networks, attractor networks, echo-state networks, deep networks, and sensor fusion networks are a few of the possibilities. Core Top- Level Microarchitecture * Loihi is a 14-nm Intel chip that offers 128 cores and 130,000 neurons on a 60-mm package. It integrates a wide range of features, such as hierarchical connectivity, dendritic compartments, synaptic delays and programmable synaptic learning rules. Running a spiking convolutional form of the Locally Competitive Algorithm, Loihi can solve LASSO optimization problems with over three orders of magnitude superior energy- delay product compared to conventional solvers running on a CPU isoprocess/voltage/area. A 64 Loihi research system offers 8-million-neuron neuromorphic system. Loihi is about 1,000 times as fast as a CPU and 10,000 times as energy efficient. * BrainScaleS is based on physical emulations of neuron, synapse and plasticity models with digital connectivity, running up to ten thousand times faster than real time. It was developed by the European Human Brain Project. https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/silicon-brains/ Neuromorphic Computing The BrainScaleS system contains 20 8-inch silicon wafers in 180 nm process technology. Each wafer incorporates 50 x 106 plastic synapses and 200,000 biologically realistic neurons. The system does not execute pre-programmed code but evolves according to the physical properties of the electronic devices, running at up to 10 thousand times faster than real time.  Benchmarks  Classification capabilities of spiking networks trained according to unsupervised learning methods have been tested on the common benchmark datasets, such as, Iris, Wisconsin Breast Cancer or Statlog Landsat dataset.Newman et al. 1998Bohte et al. 2002aBelatreche et al. 2003 Various approaches to information encoding and network design have been used. For example, a 2-layer feedforward network for data clustering and classification. Based on the idea proposed in Hopfield (1995) the authors implemented models of local receptive fields combining the properties of radial basis functions (RBF) and spiking neurons to convert input signals (classified data) having a floating-point representation into a spiking representation.Bohte, et. al.

Nicolaas Zannekin was a rich farmer from Lampernisse. During the early 14th century AD, Zannekin served as leader of the revolt in coastal Flanders against the oppressive tax policy of the Count of Flanders Louis of Nevers. Zannekin and his men captured the towns of Nieuwpoort, Veurne, Ypres and Kortrijk. In Kortrijk, Zannekin was able to capture the Count himself. In 1325 attempts to capture Gent and Oudenaarde failed. The King of France, Charles IV of France intervened whereupon Louis was released from captivity in February 1326 and the Peace of Arques was sealed. In 1328 hostilities erupted again and the Count fled to France. Louis was able to convince the new king Philip VI of France to come to his aid and Zannekin and his followers were decisively defeated by the French royal army in the Battle of Cassel (1328), where Zannekin himself was killed.

The year 2008 was designated \\"European Year of Intercultural Dialogue\\" (EYID) by the European Parliament and the Member States of the European Union. It aimed to draw the attention of people in Europe to the importance of dialogue within diversity and between diverse cultures. Definitions There is no single and universally accepted meaning of \\"Intercultural dialogue\\". Indeed when the European Commission launched EYID by asking 27,000 EU citizens what they thought the phrase meant, by far the most common response (36%) was total puzzlement.Summary of Flash Eurobarometer December 2007 However, a forum organised by the Council of Europe in November 2006 suggested the following: * \\"an open and respectful exchange of views between individuals and groups belonging to different cultures that leads to a deeper understanding of the other's world perception\\".Discussion paper based on the Forum Other definitions or usages have been closer to concepts such as inter-religious dialogue e.g., Pope Benedict XVI speaking to Ambassadors from countries with a Muslim majority Rome 25 September 2006 and often to active citizenship learning.e.g. the Vermont Intercultural Dialogue and Encounters Initiative In a number of countries the phrase refers to dialogue between indigenous people and immigrant peoples,cf, for example, the description of intercultural dialogue in Germany and it can also be used as a metaphor for forms of contact between countries which are not based on military power.cf, for example, the BBC report of Iranian President Khatami's speech at the UNESCO forum on Dialogue between Civilisations, October 1999 The text adopted by the European Union on EYIDDecision No 1983/2006/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008) does not use any specific definition, but it underlines the role of intercultural dialogue in: *respect for cultural diversity in the complex societies of today *the role of dialogue and greater mutual understanding in developing equal opportunities for all *supporting the EU's commitment to solidarity and social justice *enabling the EU to forge partnerships with other countries and make its voice better heard in the world. Antecedents=European years EYID has a number of antecedents in the European Union's policies. There have been a number of \\"European Years\\", beginning in 1983 with the European Year of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and the Craft Industry. Recent and planned European Years include: * 1983 - European Year of SMEs and the Craft Industry * 1984 - European Year for a People's Europe * 1985 - European Year of Music * 1986 - European Year of Road Safety * 1987 - European Year of the Environment * 1988 - European Year of Cinema and Television * 1989 - European Year of Information on Cancer * 1990 - European Year of Tourism * 1992 - European Year of Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work * 1993 - European Year of the Elderly and of Solidarity between Generations * 1994 - European Year of Nutrition and Health * 1995 - European Year of Road Safety and Young Drivers * 1996 - European Year of Lifelong Learning * 1997 - European Year against Racism and Xenophobia * 1998 - European Year of Local and Regional Democracy * 1999 - European Year of Action to Combat Violence Against Women * 2001 - European Year of Languages * 2003 - European Year of People with Disabilities * 2004 - European Year of Education through Sport * 2005 - European Year of Citizenship through Education * 2006 - European Year of Workers' Mobility * 2007 - European Year of Equal Opportunities for All * 2008 - European Year of Intercultural Dialogue * 2009 - European Year of Creativity and Innovation * 2010 - European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusionhttp://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/1905&format;=HTML&aged;=0&language;=EN&guiLanguage;=en * 2011 - European Year of Volunteeringhttp://europa.eu/volunteering/en/home2 * 2012 - European Year for Active Ageinghttp://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&catId;=89&newsId;=860 * 2013 - European Year of Citizenshttp://ec.europa.eu/citizenship/european-year- of-citizens-2013/index_en.htm * 2015 - European Year for Development http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32014D0472 * 2018 - European Year of Cultural Heritage No further European Years have yet been announced, although Commissioner J√°n Figeƒæ, who originally proposed EYID, has reflected publicly about the possibility of designating 2009 as a European Year linking Education, Culture, and Creativity.see press release following the Education, Youth and Culture Council of Ministers of the EU of 16 February 2007, under any other business (page 10) A full list of European Years is maintained by the European Parliament . It will be seen that many of these years, particularly the more recent ones, are in the educational and social fields. In general they have been designated and run directly by the European Union and its Member States; however, some (such as 2005) have been designated and run by the Council of Europe and others (such as the 2001 European Year of Languages) were joint operations between the two bodies. European Activities Many of the activities of the European Union both contribute to the development of intercultural dialogue and, conversely, require it. Activities such as the promotion of educational and training exchangessee, for example, the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013 or the ERASMUS programme enable young people and academics/teachers/trainers to move around the European Union and require them to operate in cultures and living circumstances different from those they know best. They thus require an openness to learn from (or at least, to survive in) another culture, and they help people develop the capacities that encourage this. Similarly, the fundamental freedoms of the European Union are built on the idea that people, goods, services and capital should be able to move around the Union freely; their realisation by individuals and companies both requires and encourages intercultural dialogue. The purpose of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue The purpose of European Years generally has become similar to that of EYID: *\\"to contribute to giving expression and a high profile to a sustained process of intercultural dialogue which will continue beyond that year\\" (Article 1 of the Decision establishing the Year) European Years generally respond to a perceived need to promote an issue in the public eye; to support relevant public organisations and NGOs in their work; and to provide limited resources for some trans-national work at European level. Recent Years have concentrated more on raising the profile of the issue concerned, less on funding projects through dedicated budgets; they have rather sought to make their issue a funding priority in existing programmes (such as the Lifelong Learning programme cited above, whose Call for projectsfull text includes this priority at different points: see for example sections 1.1.3 and 4.2.4). This system avoids the need to dedicate specific budgets to the European year, or enables them to be spent on projects with higher visibility.see, for example, the project list of the European Year of Education through Sport Dedicated budgets for recent European Years have been around ‚Ç¨12 million between the Year itself and the preceding (preparatory) year. For this particular European Year, Commissioner J√°n Figeƒæ has suggested three specific objectives: *\\"raising the awareness of European citizens and of those living in the Union; *developing social and personal habits that will equip us for a more open and complex cultural environment; *finally, intercultural dialogue is linked to a more political goal: creating a sense of European citizenship\\".Speech at the \\"Soul for Europe\\" Conference, Berlin, 17 November 2006 Actions expected ... The legislation designating the year calls for the following types of activity:see article 3 of the Decision *activities at European, national and regional levels promoting Intercultural Dialogue and the various objectives of the Year. These should be connected to civic education and to learning to appreciate others and their differences the legal text refers to \\"A limited number of emblematic actions on a European scale aimed at raising awareness, particularly among young people\\"; *information and promotion campaigns, particularly in connection with NGOs, and focussing on young people and children *surveys and studies to evaluate the Year and to prepare for its long-term follow-up. ... at European level In response to this mandate, the European Commission held a three- month consultation (or \\"Call for ideas\\"Call for ideas; outcome) about what the Year should entail. This was followed by a Conference and Exhibition on the European Year and on the future of Intercultural Dialoguesurvey of conference/exhibition at to help identify good practice. It is now considering how these outcomes should be put into practice. ... at National level The legislation requires the EU Member States to nominate a national coordination body \\"responsible for organising that Member State's participation in the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue\\" (see article 4). This should have been done within one month of the adoption of the legal decision at European level (i.e., by 18 January 2007); but not all Member States have so far done so and the European Commission has not yet published the list of those bodies so far nominated. Ambassadors The European Commission appointed fifteen \\"Ambassadors of the Year\\" in the run-up to EYID. Like \\"intercultural dialogue\\" itself, the role of these ambassadors is somewhat vague, though they are expected to be \\"committed to, and share, the aims of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (EYID) 2008\\" and \\"lend their support to making the Year a success.\\"EYID's ambassadors This vagueness has landed at least one of the ambassadors in hot water with the Commission. When Marija ≈†erifoviƒá appeared to lend her support to the Serbian Radical Party, which favours closer cooperation with Russia rather than the EU, the Commission threatened to remove her from the unpaid ambassadorial post. A spokesman justified the threat by stating that Ms ≈†erifovic's \\"political affiliation and activities in no way express the political position of the EU in the context of the Serbian presidential elections which are a matter for the people of Serbia\\".EU Observer interview, January 2008 The threat has not been carried out, perhaps because the Commission listened to its spokesman and decided that Serbian elections are indeed \\"a matter for the people of Serbia\\". The fifteen international intercultural Ambassadors of the Year of Intercultural Dialogue come from all over the world (but mostly France and Belgium) and include intercultural luminaries of the calibre of Charles Aznavour, Abd al Malik, the Dardenne brothers and Marjane Satrapi. These internationally renowned figures are supported by a hundred or so nationally famous national intercultural Ambassadors of the Year of Intercultural Dialogue, who have been appointed by twenty of the twenty-seven member states according to varied and somewhat opaque criteria. Their role is, if possible, even more vague than that of the international Ambassadors of the Year.

He is the Cultural Space Liaison for the City of Seattle. He is also well known as the founder of Consolidated Works, a contemporary arts center in Seattle. Richter has been producing alternative contemporary art, performance, film and music since his graduation from Northwestern University in 1990. In 1992, he formed the seminal Rm 608, a gallery for visual and performing arts, in an abandoned storefront on Seattle's Capitol Hill. The \\"small but influential\\" (The Stranger) organization served as the launching point for local talents such as David Schmader, the Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players, Kia Sian, and Kristen Kosmas, and over the course of its two-year lifespan presented over 200 world-premiere works of theater and performance art, several of which received continued runs off-Broadway in New York City. On its closing in 1994 (the organization's lifespan was built into its structure, and the closing was anticipated) Richter was quoted in The Seattle Weekly as saying, \\"Organizations should end, in the same way that performances end, so that the audience can clap, go home, and think about what it meant.\\" In 1994, he was hired as the Theater Editor of The Stranger, the alternative newsweekly in Seattle. While there, he expanded his interest in writing and published investigative journalism (according to the paper's website, one undercover report earned him personal bodyguard protection following death threats made by the group investigated) and feature-length articles that were reprinted in alternative newsweeklies around the country. He was also published in an American Heritage college geography textbook. He left the newspaper in 1997 but continues to publish sporadically, most recently writing on the issue of nonprofit reform in America. In 1998, he formed Consolidated Works, a contemporary arts center in Seattle, housed in a renovated warehouse in Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood. Art in America called ConWorks (as it was known for short) \\"the most dazzling\\" alternative arts space in the Northwest. Over the course of seven years as its executive director, he grew the organization into one of the region's most prestigious arts presenters, working with teams of curators and producers to fill the facility's theater, cinema, visual art gallery, music hall, lecture stage, and bar. The center flourished, reportedly thanks to Richter's \\"legendary fundraising skills\\" and \\"internationally renowned programming\\" (Seattle Post-Intelligencer). In 2002 he was one of twelve individuals invited under the auspices of the Rockefeller Foundation to contribute as founding members of the National Arts and Technology Network. In 2003 he received the Seattle Mayor's Arts Award on behalf of ConWorks, and also in 2003 was one of 12 recipients nationally of the Safeco Insurance Rudy Award for leadership in the nonprofit sector. A profile of the Seattle arts scene in Art in America referred to Richter as \\"an arts visionary.\\" A profile in The Stranger referred to him as \\"freakishly ambitious.\\" He was fired from Consolidated Works by the organization's board of directors on February 5, 2005, a move that sparked controversy and divided many in the local arts scene. The reasons for the firing were never made public. The organization continued without Richter for nearly two years following the firing, but announced its dissolution in December 2006, after losing its mammoth facility to rising costs nearly six months prior. In 2005, Richter formed a new company, xom, which (according to Richter) stands for \\"hug and kiss, matt.\\" Under the auspices of the new company, Richter designed and created original furniture, lectured on the state of the arts, consulted to arts organizations, and produces independent arts events. He continues his long-running association with the 14/48 festival, the self-described \\"world‚Äôs quickest theater festival,\\" a semiannual speed-theater marathon formerly held at Consolidated Works. In September 2006, Richter (in collaboration with 18 chefs from around the country) created Dinner Theater, an avant-garde performance art dinner theater presented at On the Boards in Seattle.

An alliance of 22 southern states, the G20 (led by India, People's Republic of China and Brazil), resisted demands from the North for agreements on the so-called \\"Singapore issues\\", on competition policy and on public procurement in trade talks. Instead, they called for an end to agricultural subsidies within the EU and the US. The talks broke down without progress, although trade facilitation, one of the Singapore issues, re-emerged with the support from both developed and developing countries in later Doha trade round discussion. *December 2003 - WTO rules that duties imposed by the US on imported steel are illegal. US President George W. Bush repeals the tariffs to avoid a trade war with the EU. *August 2004 - Geneva talks achieve a framework agreement on the Doha round. Developed countries will lower agricultural subsidies, and in exchange the developing countries will lower tariff barriers to manufactured goods. *March 2005 - Upholding a complaint from Brazil, WTO rules that US subsidies to its cotton farmers are illegal. *May 2005 - Paris talks aimed at finalizing issues for agreement before the December 2005 Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong are hung over technical issues. The group of five (U.S., Australia, the EU, Brazil and India) fail to agree over chicken, beef and rice. France continues to protest restrictions on subsidies to farmers. Oxfam accuses the EU of delaying tactics which threaten to scupper the Doha round. *May 2005 - The WTO agrees to start membership talks with Iran. *September 2005 - Frenchman Pascal Lamy takes over as WTO director- general.

In 1977 it was released as a single in Argentina on the RCA label. Production When asked \\"how did [ABBA] manage to make such a ridiculous and quite banal song [as Dum Dum Diddle] come alive\\", Bj√∂rn Again founder Rod Leissle said \\"I think ABBA had a special quality about them. They could put ridiculous lyrics into a song, and because they were fundamentally great songwriters they could make it work. A line like 'Dum Dum Diddle, to be your fiddle' doesn't really make a great deal of sense, but it still works because it's something you can sing along to and enjoy\\". Composition Dum Dum Diddle is a folk-inspired pop song. The song has Lasse Wellander's acoustic guitar in the verses. Benny plays piano during the breaks between the girl's \\"woh-woh\\" vocals. The song has a fiddle-style refrain (simulated by a synthesiser), which serves as its hook. It contains a \\"stream of strong melodies and instrumentation\\". The lead vocals shared by Agnetha F√§ltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. Synopsis The song is about a woman who quietly longs for the affections of a sad, lonely man who derives his only pleasure from constantly playing and practicing on his violin. The Guardian described it as \\"a song about a woman who feels sexually threatened by her partner's violin\\". Critical reception Abba's Abba Gold suggests that ABBA criticised the song, though add that the writers of the book like it. Abba - Uncensored on the Record said the \\"unfortunately titled song...seemed like a reversion to Eurovision-style thinking\\". The complete New Zealand music charts, 1966-2006 describes the song as \\"rather silly but fun\\". Bright Lights Dark Shadows: The Real Story of Abba implied that Eagle was more lyrically ambitious than \\"the 'dum dum diddles' of ABBA's earlier work\\". The Los Angeles Times described the song as \\"cheery nonsense\\". The Scotsman implied that Dum Dum Diddle was a bad song by saying \\"LIFE ‚Äì to quote Toni Collette in Muriel's Wedding ‚Äì can be \\"as good as an Abba song\\" but the clunky transfer of Mamma Mia! from stage to screen proves that it can be just as awful as 'Dum Dum Diddle' too\\".

Domestic pig, lamb, calf, ox, chicken, goose, and cod livers are widely available from butchers and supermarkets while stingray and burbot livers are common in some European countries. Animal livers are rich in iron, copper, the B vitamins and preformed vitamin A. It is unsure if daily consumption of liver can be harmful, as no conclusive research has been done on the toxicity of preformed vitamin A from food. A single serving of beef liver exceeds the tolerable upper intake level of vitamin A. 100 g cod liver contains 5 mg of vitamin A and 100 ¬µg of vitamin D.N√§hrstoffe und Vitamine in Dorschleber Deutsches Ern√§hrungsberatungs- und -informationsnetz  Etymology  From Middle English liver, from Old English lifer, from Proto-Germanic *libr≈ç, from Proto- Indo-European *leyp- ‚Äúto smear, smudge, stick‚Äù, from Proto-Indo-European *ley- ‚Äúto be slimy, be sticky, glide‚Äù.

In the Romance languages, the anatomical word for \\"liver\\" (French foie, Spanish h√≠gado, etc.) derives not from the Latin anatomical term, jecur, but from the culinary term ficatum, literally \\"stuffed with figs,\\" referring to the livers of geese that had been fattened on figs (foie gras).  Preparation  Liver can be baked, boiled, broiled, fried, stir-fried, or eaten raw (asbeh nayeh or sawda naye in Lebanese cuisine, liver sashimi). In many preparations, pieces of liver are combined with pieces of meat or kidneys, like in the various forms of Middle Eastern mixed grill (e.g. meurav Yerushalmi). Spreads or p√¢t√©s made from liver have various names, including liver p√¢t√©, p√¢t√© de foie gras, chopped liver, liverwurst, and Braunschweiger. A traditional South African delicacy, namely skilpadjies, is made of minced lamb's liver wrapped in netvet (caul fat), and grilled over an open fire.  Fish liver  Some fish livers are valued as food, especially the stingray liver. It is used to prepare delicacies, such as poached skate liver on toast in England, as well as the beignets de foie de raie and foie de raie en croute in French cuisine. Cod liver (usually tinned in its oil and served seasoned) is a popular spread for bread or toast in several European countries. In Russia, it is served with potatoes. Cod liver oil is commonly used as a dietary supplement. Liver of burbot is eaten in Finland: it is common for fish vendors and supermarket fish aisles to sell these fish with liver and roe sacks still attached. These parts are often eaten boiled or added to burbot soup. Burbot and its liver are a traditional winter food.https://www.meillakotona.fi/artikkelit/kalakoulu-made  Poisoning  Very high doses of vitamin A have the potential to be toxic and can cause hypervitaminosis A, a dangerous disorder. There have been several anecdotal reports and a few scientific studies of vitamin A poisoning due to the consumption of the livers of polar bears, walruses, bearded seals, moose, and huskies. The livers of these animals can contain very high levels of vitamin A.The Phoca barbata listed on pages 167‚Äì168 of the previous reference is now known as Erignathus barbatus The Inuit will not eat the liver of polar bears or bearded seals. It has been estimated that consumption of 500 grams of polar bear liver would result in a toxic dose for a human. Russian sailor Alexander Konrad, who accompanied explorer Valerian Albanov in a tragic ordeal over the Arctic ice in 1912, wrote about the awful effects of consuming polar bear liver.Valerian Albanov. In the Land of White Death. Appendix; A. Konrad's notes. Also, in 1913, Antarctic explorers on the Far Eastern Party Douglas Mawson and Xavier Mertz were believed to have been poisoned, the latter fatally, from eating husky liver, though this has been contested recently. Vitamin A poisoning is less likely from consuming oil-based vitamin A products and liver than from consuming water-based and solid preparations. Mercury content in some species can also be an issue; in 2012 the Government of Nunavut warned pregnant women to avoid eating ringed seal liver due to elevated levels of mercury.Study says ringed seal liver dangerous for pregnant women The neurotoxin in the liver of the pufferfish (which is consumed in Japanese cuisine as fugu, tightly regulated by Japanese law) contains the highest concentration of the tetrodotoxin, which characterizes the species.

Life He lived in Narbo (modern Narbonne). Tonantius Ferreolus was a witness when Sidonius Apollinaris, then bishop of Clermont, between 461 and 467, sent a letter to his friend, Donidius, describing a visit he made, a \\"most delightful time in the most beautiful country in the company of Tonantius Ferreolus (the elder) and Apollinaris, the most charming hosts in the world\\". Tonantius was on the estates of his father when Sidonius Apollinaris visited between 461 and 467. As Sidonius relates, \\"at Prusianum, as the other (estate) is called, (the young) Tonantius and his brothers turned out of their beds for us because we could not be always dragging our gear about: they are surely the elect among the nobles of our own age\\". He is known to be a friend and relative of Sidonius Apollinaris. He was the son of Tonantius Ferreolus and Papianilla. Papianilla is generally regarded as belonging to the Arvernian family of the Aviti, though in a generation senior to Sidonius' wife of the same name.Mathison, 1979, p. 79. The younger Tonantius' wife was an Industria living at Narbonne, born ca 450 to 460, married after 475, believed to have been daughter of Flavius Probus,Settipani, 2002, p. 13. Gallo-Roman Senator, and his wife Eulalia, cousin-german (first cousin) of Sidonius Apollinaris.Mathison, 1979, p. 274. He was regarded as a senator even after the fall of the empire as was customary in Visigothic and Merovingian Gaul because his family had held the highest grades senatorial rank during the empire.Martindale, 1980, p. 466. No church offices are known for the younger Tonantius Ferreolus and he held no known positions under the Visigothic kings in the period leading up to the Battle of Vouille unless he continued in his father's position of Rector Galliarum. He may also have been appointed Defensor Pedensis (Royal official in the city of Pedena, now in Croatia) by Ostrogothic King Theodoric in 511. He had several siblings whose names are not preserved. There is some argument as to whether Ferreolus of Narbo referred to as husband of Industria and father of Firminus is Tonantius Ferreolus or a brother.Mathison, 1979, p. 114. Narbo was within the realm of the Visigoths and Tonantius Ferreolus almost certainly remained loyal to Euric and Alaric II prior to the Battle of Vouille. His involvement in that Battle is not known. Following the collapse of the Kingdom of Alaric, Southern Gaul including Narbo was briefly under the control of the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy. However, subsequent to the fall of the Burgundian Kingdom in the early 530's, the Austrasian Franks under Theodoric quickly took control of Burgundy and Provence as far as the Mediterranean and along the coast from at least Uzes on the west to the Italian border on the east leaving Narbo, except for one or two brief incursions, in Visigothic hands. The familial control of the See of Uzes, within whose borders much of the property of the Ferreolan villa of Prusianum was included, began during the time of Tonantius Ferreolus. Although Tonantius Ferreolus was not noted for any particular political or ecclesiastic initiative, his survival and that of his familia and properties following the loss of Gaul, first by the Roman Empire, and then the Visigoths, was to have important repercussions for the durability of Gallo Roman political identity, autonomy, laws and customs during the Merovingian and subsequent eras. What is known of Tonantius Ferreolus' descendants from that time is derived either from the history of the see of Uzes or from those few noblemen in the family such as Ferreolus, father of Ansbert and Agilulf, who apparently relocated out of the Visigothic Kingdom or were taken as hostages, (cf Gregory of Tours' relative Attalus Thorpe's Translation of Gregory of Tours, History of the Franks, 1977, p. 175.) to the heartland of the Austrasian Kingdom in the vicinity of Metz and Trier. Since Ferreolus' grandfather, Tonantius Ferreolus the Elder was Prefect of Gaul (451) and possessed consular ancestors including the two Syagrii during the reign of Theodosius,Mathisen, 1979, p. 78. Tonantius Ferreolus' Austrasia bound son Ferreolus would have possessed sufficient standing in the eyes of the Franks to marry a Frankish princess of a minor house. At the time Ferreolus will have been relocating to Austrasia from Narbo, or more likely Frankish Provence, his second cousin Parthenius, Patrician of Provence in 542 (Austrasian Governor - typically a Gallo-Roman. The title was concurrent with the title of Rector of Provence) and Tax Collector at Trier by 548 was in a position to have interceded for him.Thorpe's translation of Gregory of Tours, History of the Franks, 1977, p.191. By his wife he had the following issue: * Ferreolus, Senator of Narbonne, father of the Gallo-Roman Senator Ansbertus. Settipani here cites Paul the Deacon in his work on the Bishops of Metz where Agilulf, Bishop of Metz, brother of Ansbert and uncle of Arnoald Bishop of Metz, was referred to as the \\"son of a senator\\".Settipani, 2000, p. 221 Metz was in the Kingdom of Austrasia and Austrasia controlled Provence which included Uzes. Although Tonantius Ferreolus who was attested at Narbo likely took the side of the Goths before the death of Alaric II, by the mid 6th century his family had clearly relocated to within Frankish territory which began west of Uzes and extended Eastward. N√Æmes, just to the south and a little west of Uzes was in Visigothic hands until the Arab capture in the 8th century. Settipani, based on his reading of Paul the Deacon and the fact that the name Ferreolus was associated with the name Ansbert in two Autun Bishops in a Burgundian see that was regarded as both being hereditary and having ties with the Syagrii- Ferreoli, was persuaded apparently to accept the slightly confused 9th century account stating that the senator in question was a \\"Ferreolus.\\" Settipani suggests this Ferreolus tentatively as a son of Tonantius Ferreolus and Industria. Settipani further suggests that this son married to a daughter of Frankish Ripuarian Royal house which had survived through the clemency of Theoderic of Austrasia who was thought to have been a son of Clovis' 1st wife, an unattested daughter of Sigebert, the penultimate Ripuarian Frankish king. Kelley had come to the same or a similar conclusion in 1947 NEGHR, 1947 but it appears from those who cite him that the original idea was that Ansbertus was a son of Tonantius Ferreolus and not a grandson. * Firminus, Bishop of Uz√®s in 507 (ca 490 - 538, 551 or October 11, 553); Feast Day October 11.Mathisen, 1979, p. 56.Settipani, 1991, p. 198.

Youth and schoolboy success Neal attended primary school in Glasheen Boys' School. Later, he won three Munster Schools Senior soccer titles with his secondary school Col√°iste an Spioraid Naoimh, in Bishopstown, County Cork. He also received two Munster Youth Cup winners medals with Wilton for his part in a very successful team. Following this success, Horgan represented his college and his country at the World University Games. He signed for Cork City and competed with Alan Carey for the right fullback position. Cork City Under manager Pat Dolan, Horgan played at right fullback for Cork City before fracturing his leg in April 2004 during a Munster derby against Waterford United, ruling him out of the club's UEFA Inter-Toto Cup campaign. (The then under-21 level prospect, and future club captain, Cillian Lordan deputised for Horgan in his absence). Horgan recovered ahead of schedule to reclaim his place as the season came to a close. Horgan played a role in Cork City's League of Ireland winning campaign in 2005, and completed a Law degree in 2006. Because of his birth on American soil Neal is eligible to work without visa issues in the USA. During the following Winter off-season (January 2007) Neal investigated the possibility of combining his football and law experience in the US, participating in a pre-season camp in Mexico with Colorado Rapids before choosing instead to return to Cork City for the start of the 2007 campaign. Neal announced his retirement from professional football after the 2009 season, to further his studies in Law, but then signed for non-professional side Douglas Hall and in June 2010 signed a new contract with Cork City.

As a result, statistical tests performed on the data are rendered invalid. Pseudoreplication was originally defined in 1984 by Stuart H. Hurlbert as a special case of inadequate specification of random factors where both random and fixed factors are present. The problem of inadequate specification arises when treatments are assigned to units that are subsampled and the treatment F-ratio in an analysis of variance (ANOVA) table is formed with respect to the residual mean square rather than with respect to the among unit mean square. The F-ratio relative to the within unit mean square is vulnerable to the confounding of treatment and unit effects, especially when experimental unit number is small (e.g. four tank units, two tanks treated, two not treated, several subsamples per tank). The problem is eliminated by forming the F-ratio relative to the correct mean square in the ANOVA table (tank by treatment MS in the example above), where this is possible. The problem is addressed by the use of mixed models. Hurlbert reported \\"pseudoreplication\\" in 48% of the studies he examined, that used inferential statistics. Several studies examining scientific papers published up to 2016 similarly found about half of the papers were suspected of pseudoreplication. When time and resources limit the number of experimental units, and unit effects cannot be eliminated statistically by testing over the unit variance, it is important to use other sources of information to evaluate the degree to which an F-ratio is confounded by unit effects. Replication Replication increases the precision of an estimate, while randomization addresses the broader applicability of a sample to a population. Replication must be appropriate: replication at the experimental unit level must be considered, in addition to replication within units. Hypothesis testing Statistical tests (e.g. t-test and the related ANOVA family of tests) rely on appropriate replication to estimate statistical significance. Tests based on the t and F distributions assume homogeneous, normal, and independent errors. Correlated errors can lead to false precision and p-values that are too small. Types Hurlbert (1984) defined four types of pseudoreplication. *Simple pseudoreplication (Figure 5a in Hurlbert 1984) occurs when there is one experimental unit per treatment. Inferential statistics cannot separate variability due to treatment from variability due to experimental units when there is only one measurement per unit. *Temporal pseudoreplication (Figure 5c in Hurlbert 1984) occurs when experimental units differ enough in time that temporal effects among units are likely, and treatment effects are correlated with temporal effects. Inferential statistics cannot separate variability due to treatment from variability due to experimental units when there is only one measurement per unit. *Sacrificial pseudoreplication (Figure 5b in Hurlbert 1984) occurs when means within a treatment are used in an analysis, and these means are tested over the within unit variance. In Figure 5b the erroneous F-ratio will have 1 df in the numerator (treatment) mean square and 4 df in the denominator mean square(2-1 = 1 df for each experimental unit). The correct F-ratio will have 1 df in the numerator (treatment) and 2 df in the denominator (2-1 = 1 df for each treatment). The correct F-ratio controls for effects of experimental units but with 2 df in the denominator it will have little power to detect treatment differences. *Implicit pseudoreplication occurs when standard errors (or confidence limits) are estimated within experimental units. As with other sources of pseudoreplication, treatment effects cannot be statistically separated from effects due to variation among experimental units.

Born Mabel Balcombe Emmerton in Raveloe, South Yarra, Victoria in 1890, her best-known service was as president of the Queen Victoria Hospital from 1923‚Äì1970, where she presided over the addition of three new wings within ten years.  Early life and marriage  Born on 15 June 1890, Brookes was the only child of a Melbourne lawyer H. Emmerton and his wife. After being withdrawn from kindergarten by her mother in order to avoid 'developing a bad accent', Mabel described her childhood as a lonely one; she was educated by her father and a series of governesses. While recuperating from an illness in The Briars in Mornington, she heard from her grandmother, Emma Balcome, of her Balcombe ancestors who lived in The Briars in Saint Helena at the time of the exile of Napoleon. She developed a fascination with Saint Helena and Napoleon's exile there. Another ancestor, Sir William Doveton, was a member of the council of Saint Helena when Napoleon was there. When Mabel was 14, a young man allegedly told her mother that Mabel was 'dull, plain and reads too much', prompting a dramatic change in her parents' approach to her upbringing. After being presented at the Edwardian court in London, at 18 Mabel was engaged to Norman Brookes, a tennis player, who was the first Australian to win Wimbledon. They married in St Paul's Anglican Cathedral, Melbourne, on 19 April 1911. In 1914, with a baby daughter, she accompanied Brookes on his tennis trips to Europe and the USA. Whilst in the USA Norman Brookes and Tony Wilding won the Davis Cup, which Mabel supposedly used as a rose bowl. World War I and II During World War I, in 1915, she joined her husband in Cairo where he was working as commissioner for the Australian Branch of the British Red Cross. Along with other officer's wives she tended to sick and wounded servicemen, as well as assisting in the establishment of a rest home for nurses. Her experiences in Egypt left a deep impression on her, inspiring her war novels Broken Idols (Melville and Mullin, 1917) and Old Desires (Australasian Authors Agency, 1922) which were largely set in Egypt, and sparking a lifelong engagement on matters of public health. On her husband's posting to Mesopotamia, she returned to Melbourne in 1917. In 1918 she served on the committee of the Royal Children's Hospital, then became president of the Children's Frankston Orthopaedic Hospital, the Anglican Babies' Home and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. She was an original member and a divisional officer of the Girl Guides' Association executive committee, foundation president of the Institute of Almoners and of the Animal Welfare League. She was also a member of the Australian Red Cross Society's federal executive and president of the Ladies' Swimming Association. During World War II the Brookes family vacated their home Kurneh to allow it to be used by the Red Cross as a convalescent home for returned soldiers. The Brookes family moved to their other property, Elm Tree House, and entertained Australian and American officers, including future American president Lyndon B. Johnson (during an official state visit to Australia in 1967, Johnson would take time out to visit Mabel at Elm Tree House, attracting a crowd of hundreds to gather outside the house). Mabel Brookes was commandant of the Australian Women's Air Training Corps, and took on shift-work at the Maribyrnong Munitions Factory filling cartridges. Other war-work included establishing Air Force House and organizing, at the request of the minister for the army, an annexe for servicewomen at the Queen Victoria Hospital.  Presidency of Queen Victoria Hospital  From 1923 to 1970, Mabel served as president for the Queen Victoria Hospital. By all accounts she was a fierce and capable advocate on behalf of the hospital, and oversaw the addition of three new wings, one of which was named after her in appreciation of her decades of service. She fought hard to get suitable accommodation for the hospital, describing 10am on 17 December 1946 as the proudest hour of her life when the last patient was moved from the old hospital on Little Lonsdale Street to the new building on the corner of Lonsdale and Swanston Streets. \\"It was when I realised that the women of Melbourne had finally and decisively won their 55-year-old battle for a large hospital completely staffed by women... It was a fight by women against prejudice, suspicion and intolerance of women,\\" she was quoted in The Argus as saying, \\"There's no finer feeling than winning the supposedly hopeless battle.\\" Political career Brookes attempted a political career by standing twice for parliament, but was unsuccessful. She stood for the Division of Flinders in the 1943 federal election as a Woman for Canberra candidate and in the 1952 state election for the seat of Toorak for the Electoral Reform League. She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1933 and elevated to Dame of the order (DBE) in 1955 for services to hospitals and charity. Her lifelong fascination with Saint Helena and Napoleon led her to purchase The Briars, the pavilion where Napoleon had stayed, in 1959, and donate it to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The French Government appointed her as Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur in 1960 in acknowledgement of her gift. She published St Helena Story, an account of Napoleon's exile and his relationship with the Balcombes, in 1960. In 1967, Monash University conferred an honorary LL.D. for her services to the Queen Victoria Hospital, of which she was President. It had by that time become a Monash University teaching hospital. Dame Mabel Brookes published her memoirs in 1974 in which she recounted events in her life, including meeting many notable and historic people of the time. She died at South Yarra on 30 April 1975, aged 84, survived by two of her three daughters. Writing career Brookes was a published novelist and memoirist. She wrote the following works:  Novels  * Broken Idols. Melbourne: Melville and Mullin, 1917. * On the Knees of the Gods. Melbourne: Melville and Mullin, 1918.

Wood was born in Chorley, Lancashire and attended Barrow Grammar School, also in Lancashire, before studying at the University of Oxford and the Royal College of Music. In 1919 he was appointed Director of Music at Tonbridge School in Kent, returning to Oxford in 1924 to teach at Exeter College. During this period he composed several choral-orchestral works including Forty Singing Seamen (1925), Master Mariners (1927) and The Ballad of Hampstead Heath (1927). He went to Australia in 1930 and spent over two years travelling across the country. This prompted him to write his book Cobbers (1934) which the Australian Dictionary of Biography describes as \\"still the most perceptive and captivating characterization of Australia and its people ever written by a visitor\\". He continued to compose and wrote several other books, including an autobiography, True Thomas (1936), before his death of a heart attack in 1950.

This is part of the detailed algebraic discussion of the rotation group SO(3). Formulation The association of a spinor with a 2√ó2 complex Hermitian matrix was formulated by √âlie Cartan. In detail, given a vector x = (x1, x2, x3) of real (or complex) numbers, one can associate the complex matrix :\\\\vec{x} \\\\rightarrow X \\\\ =\\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix}x_3&x;_1-ix_2\\\\x_1+ix_2&-x_3\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right). In physics, this is often written as a dot product X\\\\equiv {\\\\bf \\\\sigma}.{\\\\bf x} , where {\\\\bf \\\\sigma}\\\\equiv (\\\\sigma_1, \\\\sigma_2, \\\\sigma_3) is the vector form of Pauli matrices. Matrices of this form have the following properties, which relate them intrinsically to the geometry of 3-space: * det X = ‚Äì (length x)2, where \\"det\\" denotes the determinant. * X 2 = (length x)2I, where I is the identity matrix. * \\\\frac{1}{2}(XY+YX)=({\\\\mathbf x}\\\\cdot{\\\\mathbf y})I * \\\\frac{1}{2}(XY-YX)=iZ where Z is the matrix associated to the cross product z = x √ó y. * If u is a unit vector, then ‚àíUXU is the matrix associated to the vector obtained from x by reflection in the plane orthogonal to u. * It is an elementary fact from linear algebra that any rotation in 3-space factors as a composition of two reflections. (Similarly, any orientation reversing orthogonal transformation is either a reflection or the product of three reflections.) Thus if R is a rotation which decomposes as the reflection in the plane perpendicular to a unit vector u1 followed by the reflection in the plane perpendicular to u2, then the matrix U2U1XU1U2 represents the rotation of the vector x through R. Having effectively encoded all of the rotational linear geometry of 3-space into a set of complex 2√ó2 matrices, it is natural to ask what role, if any, the 2√ó1 matrices (i.e., the column vectors) play. Provisionally, a spinor is a column vector :\\\\xi=\\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\xi_1\\\\xi_2\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right], with complex entries Œæ1 and Œæ2. The space of spinors is evidently acted upon by complex 2√ó2 matrices. Furthermore, the product of two reflections in a given pair of unit vectors defines a 2√ó2 matrix whose action on euclidean vectors is a rotation, so there is an action of rotations on spinors. However, there is one important caveat: the factorization of a rotation is not unique. Clearly, if X ‚Üí RXR‚àí1 is a representation of a rotation, then replacing R by ‚àíR will yield the same rotation. In fact, one can easily show that this is the only ambiguity which arises. Thus the action of a rotation on a spinor is always double-valued. There were some precursors to Cartan's work with 2√ó2 complex matrices: Wolfgang Pauli had used these matrices so intensively that elements of a certain basis of a four-dimensional subspace are called Pauli matrices œÉi, so that the Hermitian matrix is written as a Pauli vector \\\\vec{x} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{\\\\sigma}.The Pauli vector is a formal device. It may be thought of as an element of , where the tensor product space is endowed with a mapping . In the mid 19th century the algebraic operations of this algebra of four complex dimensions were studied as biquaternions. As per the book, by Michael Stone and Paul Goldbar, Mathematics for Physics, \\"The spin representations were discovered by ¬¥Elie Cartan in 1913, some years before they were needed in physics.\\", thus contradicting the above statement on the precursor to Cartan's work as being done by Pauli. Isotropic vectors  Spinors can be constructed directly from isotropic vectors in 3-space without using the quaternionic construction. To motivate this introduction of spinors, suppose that X is a matrix representing a vector x in complex 3-space. Suppose further that x is isotropic: i.e., :{\\\\mathbf x}\\\\cdot{\\\\mathbf x} = x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=0. Then since the determinant of X is zero there is a proportionality between its rows or columns. Thus the matrix may be written as an outer product of two complex 2-vectors: :X=2\\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\xi_1\\\\xi_2\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right]\\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix}-\\\\xi_2&\\\\xi_1\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right]. This factorization yields an overdetermined system of equations in the coordinates of the vector x: subject to the constraint This system admits the solutions ,\\\\quad \\\\xi_2=\\\\pm \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{-x_1-ix_2}{2}}.}} Either choice of sign solves the system (). Thus a spinor may be viewed as an isotropic vector, along with a choice of sign. Note that because of the logarithmic branching, it is impossible to choose a sign consistently so that () varies continuously along a full rotation among the coordinates x. In spite of this ambiguity of the representation of a rotation on a spinor, the rotations do act unambiguously by a fractional linear transformation on the ratio Œæ1:Œæ2 since one choice of sign in the solution () forces the choice of the second sign. In particular, the space of spinors is a projective representation of the orthogonal group. As a consequence of this point of view, spinors may be regarded as a kind of \\"square root\\" of isotropic vectors. Specifically, introducing the matrix :C=\\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix}0&1-1&0\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right), the system () is equivalent to solving X = 2 Œæ tŒæ C for the undetermined spinor Œæ. A fortiori, if the roles of Œæ and x are now reversed, the form Q(Œæ) = x defines, for each spinor Œæ, a vector x quadratically in the components of Œæ. If this quadratic form is polarized, it determines a bilinear vector-valued form on spinors Q(Œº, Œæ). This bilinear form then transforms tensorially under a reflection or a rotation.  Reality  The above considerations apply equally well whether the original euclidean space under consideration is real or complex. When the space is real, however, spinors possess some additional structure which in turn facilitates a complete description of the representation of the rotation group. Suppose, for simplicity, that the inner product on 3-space has positive-definite signature: With this convention, real vectors correspond to Hermitian matrices. Furthermore, real rotations preserving the form () correspond (in the double-valued sense) to unitary matrices of determinant one. In modern terms, this presents the special unitary group SU(2) as a double cover of SO(3). As a consequence, the spinor Hermitian product is preserved by all rotations, and therefore is canonical. If, however, the signature of the inner product on 3-space is indefinite (i.e., non-degenerate, but also not positive definite), then the foregoing analysis must be adjusted to reflect this. Suppose then that the length form on 3-space is given by: Then the construction of spinors of the preceding sections proceeds, but with x2 replacing i x2 in all the formulas. With this new convention, the matrix associated to a real vector (x1,x2,x3) is itself real: :\\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix}x_3&x;_1-x_2\\\\x_1+x_2&-x_3\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right). The form () is no longer invariant under a real rotation (or reversal), since the group stabilizing () is now a Lorentz group O(2,1). Instead, the anti- Hermitian form :\\\\langle\\\\mu\\\\xi\\\\rangle = \\\\bar{\\\\mu}_1\\\\xi_2-\\\\bar{\\\\mu}_2\\\\xi_1 defines the appropriate notion of inner product for spinors in this metric signature. This form is invariant under transformations in the connected component of the identity of O(2,1). In either case, the quartic form :\\\\langle\\\\mu\\\\xi\\\\rangle^2 = \\\\hbox{length}\\\\left(Q(\\\\bar{\\\\mu},\\\\xi)\\\\right)^2 is fully invariant under O(3) (or O(2,1), respectively), where Q is the vector- valued bilinear form described in the previous section. The fact that this is a quartic invariant, rather than quadratic, has an important consequence. If one confines attention to the group of special orthogonal transformations, then it is possible unambiguously to take the square root of this form and obtain an identification of spinors with their duals. In the language of representation theory, this implies that there is only one irreducible spin representation of SO(3) (or SO(2,1)) up to isomorphism. If, however, reversals (e.g., reflections in a plane) are also allowed, then it is no longer possible to identify spinors with their duals owing to a change of sign on the application of a reflection. Thus there are two irreducible spin representations of O(3) (or O(2,1)), sometimes called the pin representations. Reality structures The differences between these two signatures can be codified by the notion of a reality structure on the space of spinors. Informally, this is a prescription for taking a complex conjugate of a spinor, but in such a way that this may not correspond to the usual conjugate per the components of a spinor. Specifically, a reality structure is specified by a Hermitian 2 √ó 2 matrix K whose product with itself is the identity matrix: K2 = Id. The conjugate of a spinor with respect to a reality structure K is defined by :\\\\xi^* = K\\\\bar{\\\\xi}. The particular form of the inner product on vectors (e.g., () or ()) determines a reality structure (up to a factor of -1) by requiring :\\\\bar{X}=KXK\\\\,, whenever X is a matrix associated to a real vector. Thus K = i C is the reality structure in Euclidean signature (), and K = Id is that for signature (). With a reality structure in hand, one has the following results: * X is the matrix associated to a real vector if, and only if, \\\\bar{X} = K X K\\\\,. * If Œº and Œæ is a spinor, then the inner product ::\\\\langle\\\\mu\\\\xi\\\\rangle = i\\\\,^t\\\\mu^* C \\\\xi :determines a Hermitian form which is invariant under proper orthogonal transformations. Examples in physics=Spinors of the Pauli spin matrices  Often, the first example of spinors that a student of physics encounters are the 2√ó1 spinors used in Pauli's theory of electron spin. The Pauli matrices are a vector of three 2√ó2 matrices that are used as spin operators. Given a unit vector in 3 dimensions, for example (a, b, c), one takes a dot product with the Pauli spin matrices to obtain a spin matrix for spin in the direction of the unit vector. The eigenvectors of that spin matrix are the spinors for spin-1/2 oriented in the direction given by the vector. Example: u = (0.8, -0.6, 0) is a unit vector. Dotting this with the Pauli spin matrices gives the matrix: : S_u = (0.8,-0.6,0.0)\\\\cdot \\\\vec{\\\\sigma}=0.8 \\\\sigma_{1}-0.6\\\\sigma_{2}+0.0\\\\sigma_{3} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0.0 & 0.8+0.6i \\\\ 0.8-0.6i & 0.0 \\\\end{bmatrix} The eigenvectors may be found by the usual methods of linear algebra, but a convenient trick is to note that a Pauli spin matrix is an involutory matrix, that is, the square of the above matrix is the identity matrix. Thus a (matrix) solution to the eigenvector problem with eigenvalues of ¬±1 is simply 1 ¬± Su. That is, : S_u (1\\\\pm S_u) = \\\\pm 1 (1 \\\\pm S_u) One can then choose either of the columns of the eigenvector matrix as the vector solution, provided that the column chosen is not zero. Taking the first column of the above, eigenvector solutions for the two eigenvalues are: : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1.0+ (0.0)\\\\ 0.0 +(0.8-0.6i) \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1.0- (0.0)\\\\ 0.0-(0.8-0.6i) \\\\end{bmatrix} The trick used to find the eigenvectors is related to the concept of ideals, that is, the matrix eigenvectors (1 ¬± Su)/2 are projection operators or idempotents and therefore each generates an ideal in the Pauli algebra. The same trick works in any Clifford algebra, in particular the Dirac algebra that is discussed below. These projection operators are also seen in density matrix theory where they are examples of pure density matrices. More generally, the projection operator for spin in the (a, b, c) direction is given by :\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\begin{bmatrix}1+c&a-ib;\\\\a+ib&1-c\\\\end{bmatrix} and any non zero column can be taken as the projection operator. While the two columns appear different, one can use a2 \\\\+ b2 \\\\+ c2 = 1 to show that they are multiples (possibly zero) of the same spinor. General remarks In atomic physics and quantum mechanics, the property of spin plays a major role. In addition to their other properties all particles possess a non-classical property, i.e., which has no correspondence at all in conventional physics, namely the spin, which is a kind of intrinsic angular momentum. In the position representation, instead of a wavefunction without spin, œà = œà(r), one has with spin: œà = œà(r, œÉ), where œÉ takes the following discrete set of values: :\\\\sigma =-S\\\\cdot\\\\hbar , -(S-1)\\\\cdot\\\\hbar , ... ,+(S-1)\\\\cdot\\\\hbar ,+S\\\\cdot\\\\hbar . The total angular momentum operator, \\\\vec{\\\\mathbb J}, of a particle corresponds to the sum of the orbital angular momentum (i.e., there only integers are allowed) and the intrinsic part, the spin. One distinguishes bosons (S = 0, ¬±1, ¬±2, ...) and fermions (S = ¬±1/2, ¬±3/2, ¬±5/2, ...).

Due to its provenance, it is often referred to by its nickname of Rusek (Polish derogatory word for a native of Russia) or Czapajew (Chapayev) (Russian: –ß–∞–ø–∞–µ–≤). Description The locomotive's construction is based on that of the Soviet VL10 and VL11 (Russian: –í–õ10 & –í–õ11, respectively) and is characterised by its straightforward design as well as ease of use and reliability. The ET42 was designed to be a dual section locomotive from the outset, as opposed to the remaining dual section locomotives operated by PKP, such as the ET41 or ET40. For this reason a \\"single version\\" of the ET42 doesn't exist; nor is it possible to modify one of the sections to run as an independent unit. Since there aren't any empty spaces left by surplus cabs, the locomotive is much shorter than other dual section locomotives built from single units. The ET42 is also equipped with facilities for heating carriages and can therefore be used for hauling passenger trains. Operational history Fifty ET42s were purchased between 1978 and 1982 and were all based at the Zdu≈Ñska Wola Karsznice depot. They were all built at the Novocherkassk Electric Locomotive Factory in the former Soviet town of Novocherkassk (Russian: –ù–æ–≤–æ—á–µ—Ä–∫–∞—Å—Å–∫). The ET42's main role is hauling very heavy coal trains (up to 4,000 tonnes) along the routes leading from Silesia to the ports of Gda≈Ñsk and Gdynia. Four locomotives are no longer in PKP's inventory: ET42-003, ET42-033, ET42-043, ET42-045. ET42-003 was written off in a rail accident.

History St. Leonard's Church, Aiglsbach Aiglsbach was first recorded as a settlement in 864, with alternative names recorded as Agelspach (ca. 1145), Ailgilspach (ca. 1190) and Egilspach (ca. 1160). The name likely derives from a given name such as Agil, Egil, Aigil or Eigil, while bach refers to a stream. The town belonged to the taxation district of Munich and to the administrative district of Mainburg in the Electorate of Bavaria. Administrative reform in the Kingdom of Bavaria led in 1818 to the creation of the municipality as it is today, the official spelling being changed in 1911 from Aigelsbach to Aiglsbach. The name of Eichelsbach, a settlement within the municipality of Elsenfeld in the Bavarian Spessart in Lower Franconia is also sometimes spelled Egilespach. Aigil or Egil was a common name in the Middle Ages, and Eichelsbach in the Spessart is thought to have been named after an abbot named Aigil, of a monastery near Fulda.

It is the short form of a more formal salutation, \\"Gesegnete Mahlzeit\\" (archaic term, de: Blessed mealtime). The salutation is commonly used without connection to food or eating in Northern Germany, and this usage, corresponding to something like \\"hello, everyone\\" or \\"I'm off, folks\\", is becoming more and more widespread in informal settings, such as between office co-workers. In Austria it is used as a salutation during meal times and can also be used before drinking Sturm (Federweisser) as reference to the meal-like quality of the fermenting grape juice. Similarly, in most German regions it is only used in connection with meals. However, soldiers typically greet each other with Mahlzeit (and the reply Mahlzeit, not danke) from getting up in the morning until about 8 pm, including the entire normal work day, presumably as the next mealtime is always within short distance and is looked forward to. Mahlzeit can also be used in a negative sense. For example, when two people see something that might well spoil their appetite, one may sarcastically say \\"Mahlzeit\\" (or the stronger, \\"Na, Mahlzeit!\\") to the other.

J. Heinz Company as part of Kraft Heinz. Heinz Ketchup holds 80% of the market share in Europe and 60% in the United States. History First introduced as \\"Catsup\\" in 1876 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Heinz Tomato Ketchup remains the best selling brand of ketchup.\\"FOOD INDUSTRIES IN THE MID-ATLANTIC REGION.\\" The Greenwood Encyclopedia of American Regional Cultures: The Mid-Atlantic Region. Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2004. Credo Reference. Web. 1 October 2012. From 1906 it was produced without preservatives. In 1907, Heinz started producing 13 million bottles of ketchup per year, exporting ketchup all over the world, including India, Australia, Israel, South America, Japan, Indonesia, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Heinz ketchup is often served at restaurants in the United States and Canada, as well as many other countries. As a condiment for many foods, such as french fries, chips, hamburgers and hot dogs, Heinz ketchup uses the slogan, \\"America's Favorite Ketchup.\\" As of 2012, there are more than 650 million bottles of Heinz Tomato Ketchup being sold every year throughout the world. In January 2009, the label design was altered, with the illustration of a gherkin pickle that had adorned the label since the 1890s removed and replaced with an illustration of a vine-ripened tomato accompanied by the slogan \\"Upgrade To Heinz\\". In a recent American Customer Satisfaction Index poll of 10,644 consumers, H.J. Heinz Co. had the highest score of any food or beverage firm, higher than Kraft, Coca-Cola, and Nestl√©. Production Heinz manufactures all of its American tomato ketchup at two plants: one in Fremont, Ohio, and another in Muscatine, Iowa. Heinz closed their plant in Leamington, Ontario in 2014. The former Canadian plant is now owned by Highbury Vancouver to produce French's ketchup in Canada. Globally, Heinz produces ketchup and other tomato sauces in factories the world over, including such nations as the U.K. and the Netherlands. Although Heinz touts \\"one basic recipe\\" for its mainstay ketchup, there are variations in this recipe tailored to national tastes, and dependent on the country of production. Varieties Heinz Organic Tomato Ketchup In addition to the standard ketchup variety, Heinz offers two varieties known as \\"Organic\\" and \\"Simply Heinz\\". Both of these varieties' ingredients contain sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. Heinz offers several flavor variations: sriracha, jalape√±o, and balsamic vinegar. Dietary requirements are addressed with no- salt-added and reduced-sugar varieties. File:Heinz Tomato Ketchup with fries.jpgLimited Edition Heinz Tomato Ketchup blended with balsamic vinegar (left) and standard Heinz Tomato Ketchup (right) Edchup Ed Sheeran X Heinz ketchup On June 5, 2019, which is National Ketchup Day, Heinz along with singer-songwriter and ketchup-lover, Ed Sheeran, released a limited edition ketchup product known as Ed Sheeran X Heinz ketchup, more popularly known by its portmanteau, ‚ÄúEdchup‚Äù. Heinz announced the release in an Instagram post on June 5, 2019. The post featured Sheeran posing with a bottle of ‚ÄúEdchup‚Äù. Ed Sheeran is a long-time ketchup lover. He made this apparent when he had the Heinz ketchup logo tattooed on his left arm. The bottles, which were 20 ounces each, were limited to 5 per order. The ketchup inside was no different than ordinary Heinz tomato ketchup. The bottle itself featured a unique label in which the title was ‚ÄúHEINZ TOMATO EDCHUP‚Äù. The labels of standard Heinz ketchup bottles feature a tomato hanging from its stem. On the ‚ÄùEdchup‚Äù label the tomato is ‚Äùwearing‚Äù glasses and has a leaf on the top of it which appears to be hair. The tomato on the label was designed to imitate Ed Sheeran. EZ Squirt colored ketchup  From 2000 to 2006, Heinz produced colored ketchup products called EZ Squirt, which were available in squeezable containers and targeted towards young children. The ketchup launched in green and red-colored varieties, which were later joined by purple, pink, orange, teal, and blue. The Canadian version was labelled E-ZEE Squirt, most likely because of the difference in the way that the letter Z is pronounced in the USA and the way it's pronounced in rest of the English-speaking world. Saucy Sauce‚Ñ¢ In April 2018, Heinz announced the release of \\"Mayochup\\", a portmanteau of mayonnaise and ketchup that is a mixture of the two sauces, because 500,000+ users voted \\"yes\\" in a Twitter poll asking Americans if they wanted to see it in stores. A number of Twitter users responded that such a mixture already existed as \\"fry sauce\\" and \\"fancy sauce\\". The sauce arrived at U.S. retailers' shelves in September 2018. It attracted some media attention in May 2019 when the phrase was revealed to mean \\"shit-face\\" in the Cree language. In March 2019, after the success of their Mayochup campaign, Heinz announced the release of two new portmanteau products to celebrate the company's 150th anniversary: \\"Mayomust\\", from mayonnaise + mustard, and \\"Mayocue\\", from mayonnaise + barbecue. In April 2019, Heinz released yet another portmanteau product, this time combining ketchup and ranch dressing to create \\"Kranch\\". The new sauce received a mixed reception online. Packaging Heinz ketchup is packaged in glass and plastic bottles of various sizes, as well as individual-serving condiment packets made of foil or plastic. Larger amounts of ketchup are packaged either in metal cans, rigid plastic jugs, flexible plastic bags and in bag-in-box format. The larger containers can be fitted with pumps or placed into dispensers for bulk service. A bag containing is the largest offering intended for restaurants; an IBC tote containing is sold to food manufacturers. In 2010, Heinz unveiled a new single serve cup for dipping and squeezing, called the Dip & Squeeze, that will eventually replace the original packets. The Heinz Keystone Dispenser is a color-coded plastic dispensers, shaped to resemble the keystone part of the \\"Heinz 57\\" symbol, that accepts bags of condiments that include the original, low-sodium and Simply Heinz varieties of ketchup, along with several varieties of mustard, mayonnaise, ranch dressing and relish. Glass bottles Heinz introduced its octagonal glass bottle for the first time in 1889; the bottle was patented in 1890. While other glass bottle designs have existed, the octagonal glass bottle is still in use and is considered an \\"iconic\\" example of package design. In the United States, the glass bottle commonly used by restaurants holds of ketchup. A small bottle containing about of ketchup also exists for hotel room service and other situations where it is desirable to serve individual meals with a more personal or luxurious presentation than might be perceived with the foil or plastic packets associated with fast food dining. As ketchup has high viscosity and behaves as a pseudoplastic or thixotropic liquid, dispensing from glass bottles can be difficult. Tapping the glass bottle causes the ketchup to become thinner and easier to pour. Heinz suggests, on its website, that the best place to tap the bottle is on the \\"57\\" mark. The New York Times has also claimed that the tapping the \\"57\\" mark is the best way to cause Heinz ketchup to pour smoothly.Heinz.com. Retrieved April 28, 2011. Shaking the bottle or tapping in another place is also effective, however. The \\"57\\" mark arises from an advertising statement that Heinz made \\"57 Varieties\\" of products. When Henry J. Heinz introduced the \\"57 Varieties\\" slogan, however, the company already made at least 60 products. The number is simply the combination of numbers Heinz and his wife considered \\"lucky\\". The \\"upside-down\\" squeezable plastic bottle, consisting of an opaque red bottle with a wide white cap located at the bottom, was introduced as a food service product in 2002. It allows ketchup to be dispensed more easily than was possible with the glass bottle, and permits the use of more of the ketchup in the bottle, as the contents will settle on top of the dispensing valve. The \\"upside-down\\" bottle is intended to be non-refillable. A similar bottle has been introduced in several different sizes at the retail/grocery level, but without the opaque red coloring.  Merchandising  The Heinz Ketchup logo, and its distinctive red colour, have been used in numerous licensed products. This includes clothing, mugs, pin badges and tomato flavoured cosmetics. A Heinz Ketchup cookbook was published by Absolute Press in 2007. In January 2020, Heinz and department store Fortnum & Mason launched tomato ketchup-filled chocolate truffles, as part of their Valentine's Day offering. In April 2020, Heinz launched a 570-piece ketchup jigsaw puzzle, where all of the pieces were identically red.  Counterfeiting scheme  In 2012, a criminal scheme that repackaged bulk standard ketchup into bottles with counterfeit \\"Simply Heinz\\" labels failed when the transferred ketchup began to ferment and explode.

History 250px Situated on the heights of the road from Oberhaslach to Wangenbourg, the castle was first mentioned in a charter in 1264, as the property of sire Bourckard, burgrave of Nideck. In 1336 there is mention of a second castle, below the first, fief of the Bishop of Strasbourg and held by the landgraves of Basse-Alsace. Nideck then became the property of the seigneurs of the region, in the 14th and 15th centuries, according to the various regional conflicts and other events of the time. It was besieged by the Strasbourgeois in 1448. The M√ºllenheim family took possession of the castle and kept it until 1509. It was finally destroyed by a fire in 1636. The castle overlooks the Nideck waterfall and is easily reached on foot. The castle has been listed since 1898 by the French Ministry of Culture as a monument historique and is owned by the state. Ch√¢teau fort de Nideck The Legend of Nideck In 1816 the legend of Nideck joined the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm. This story inspired the poet Adalbert von Chamisso to write Das Riesenfr√§ulein (The Giant's Daughter). The tale relates how the castle was inhabited by a couple of giants and their little daughter. Bored one day, she walked as far as the Alsace plains and found what she took to be some living toys. Once returned to the castle, her father explained to her that they were men and that they must be left in their place because they cultivated the land to feed the giants.

Article 15, paragraph 1 reads: The Governor is therefore authorized, within the limits of these regulations and the instruction of the Crown, to act on behalf of the Kingdom Government.

Saints houses boarders both from its own students and girls from Saint Monica's High School, also in Cairns.  History  In 1930 the Marist Brothers established the school for boys. Initially there were three Marist brothers and 96 students. During World War II, air raids on Australian towns by Japan and the fear of an invasion by the Japanese led to evacuations from northern Australian towns. In March 1942, the boarders (being most of the students) were evacuated to the guest house at Lake Barrine. Boarding school Saint Augustine's offers a co-ed boarding catering for students from grades 7 to 12. The boarding community includes many students from the Far North Queensland region, along with many country students from outback Queensland and the Northern Territory. A significant number of students also board from as far away as Papua New Guinea, Gove and other islands off the coast of Australia.  Sport  The college is a member of the Cairns Interschool Senior Sport Association (CISSA) which sees a number of local schools compete in a number of different sports each Wednesday. CISSA runs during the first semester of the school year. Saint Augustine's has also been very successful in holding the Overall Boys' TCN Swimming Champion trophy for 40 years.  Rugby union  The school won all competitions in the 2014 Cairns Schoolboys Rugby Union competition.  School houses  Saint Augustine's has four houses. They are as follows: * Heavey (yellow) * Phealan (green) * Walter (red) * Reginald (blue) These houses compete against each other in many activities, including annual athletics and swimming carnivals, public speaking, and a competition on Champagnat Day. These events build up to a House Cup which is awarded at the end of each year.

Murrin is currently serving a jail sentence for sex crimes committed whilst at other schools. Brother Geoffery Sydney Veness, a one time principal of the college, plead guilty to offences against a male pupil at the school and was convicted and given a one-year suspended jail sentence in 2001.[4] The suspended sentence proved quite controversial with the trial judge coming under regular scrutiny for allegedly being lenient in the sentencing of sex offenders including Veness.

It was directed by Michael Winner. It was released on 2 November 1990, to mixed reviews, and was a box office disappointment. It has since developed a small cult following, even a subreddit. Plot Moore and Caine play dual roles‚Äîa pair of small-time con-men and a pair of inept nuclear physicists who believe they have invented a limitless supply of energy. The con men use their resemblance to the scientists to con their way into the scientists' safe deposit boxes and steal the formula, but in so doing, they become entangled in a shady world of spies and international intrigue. The film includes a number of cameo appearances, including Jenny Seagrove (Winner's partner at the time) playing two different roles, John Cleese, Patsy Kensit, Alexandra Pigg and Nicholas Courtney.

Education While completing her master's degree at the University of Cape Town (2001), she discovered a latitudinal pattern of die-off of quiver trees (Aloidendron dichotomum) suggesting that climate change could be to blame. She received funding to further the study, working with Guy Midgley at the South African National Biodiversity Institute in Cape Town. Foden spent much of 2001‚Äì2003 surveying Quiver Trees in Namibia and the arid regions of western South Africa and set up long term monitoring to track changes. Her findings confirmed a clear trend of increasing mortality along gradients from south (polewards) to north (towards the equator) and from higher to lower altitudes, suggesting that the species is responding to a poleward shift in its suitable climate, but that colonization at the leading range edge is lagging. The study was published in 2007 and was one of the first of its time to document climate change impacts on plants, arid ecosystems or in Africa. The work formed the main focus of a TVE Documentary, \\"All of a quiver\\", screened on World in April 2007. Career From 2003 to 2007 Foden managed the South African National Biodiversity Institute's Threatened Species Programme, based in Pretoria. In this capacity she played leading roles in establishing atlasing and conservation assessment programs for plants, reptiles, butterflies and arachnids. She established a scholarship for postgraduate research on threatened species and served as chairperson of the IUCN Species Survival Commission Southern African Plant Specialist Group. In 2007 Foden moved to the United Kingdom to join the IUCN Global Species Programme, based in Cambridge. Working with scientists from the IUCN Species Survival Commission, she developed a method of assessing species' vulnerability to climate change that involves modeling each species' predicted exposure to climate change and examining the biological traits that are likely to make them more or less sensitive and able to adapt to these changes. In a 2013 publication, Foden and her co-authors describe the method and its application to all birds, amphibians and corals. The study highlights the species in these groups at highest risk of climate change driven extinction, as well as the regions in which they are concentrated. The study compares species' climate change vulnerabilities with their risk of extinction on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and highlights both most urgent and new priorities for conservation. Foden and her team also applied the approach in regionally-focused climate change vulnerability assessment projects in East and Central Africa's Albertine Rift,http://data.iucn.org/dbtw-wpd/edocs/SSC- OP-048.pdf West Africa and Madagascar. Foden carries out a range of activities to raise awareness about climate change impacts on biodiversity, including through talks and seminars. In 2009 she led a public-orientated report and press release entitled 'Ten New Climate Change Flagships: More Than Just the Polar Bear' at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference. She was a guest lecturer on the University of Cambridge Conservation Leadership course in the 2010s. Foden has been a steering committee member of the IUCN Species Survival Commission Climate Change Specialist Group for many years, and is a Trustee of the Environment Africa Trust. As of 2016, Foden chaired the IUCN SSC Climate Change Specialist Group when the team created new guidelines for the conservation community, for assessing species‚Äô vulnerability to climate change. At that time she was also a Senior Researcher at the University of Stellenbosch, South Africa.

History Waddington was a mesne manor of the ancient Lordship of Bowland which comprised a Royal Forest and a Liberty of ten manors. These spanned eight townships and four parishes, covering an area of almost on the historic borders of Lancashire and Yorkshire. The manors within the Liberty were Slaidburn (Newton-in-Bowland, West Bradford, Grindleton), Knowlmere, Waddington, Easington, Bashall Eaves, Mitton, Withgill (Crook), Leagram, Hammerton and Dunnow (Battersby).Forest of Bowland official website The Tempests were lords of the manor of Waddington from at least the early thirteenth century.

Following stays at Muncaster Castle on the Cumbrian coast and at nearby Bolton Hall, he went into hiding at Waddington Hall, the home of Sir Richard Tempest. He was betrayed by \\"a black monk of Addington\\" and on 13 July 1465, a group of Yorkist men, including Sir Richard's brother John, entered the home to arrest him.

He was the younger brother of professional wrestler Gene Stanlee. Career Steve served with Gene in the U.S. Navy during World War II and entered the professional wrestling circuit after the war. From 1947 to 1948, Stanlee wrestled under the ring name Paul Stanlee for Georgia Championship Wrestling (gCW). He competed against such wrestlers as Tom Mahoney and Bobby Roberts, winning the majority of these matches. Like his brother Gene, Steve took the nickname \\"Mr. America\\" for his chiseled physique, bleached his hair blond, and wore dazzling sequined jackets to the ring. Gene and Steve did train together and had a couple of runs as a tag team, but the two generally stayed on separate career paths. Notably, Steve wrestled Lou Thesz for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on October 27, 1950, two full years before his brother faced Thesz. After his stint in Georgia, Stanlee competed in Toronto, Ontario. He worked as a jobber, putting over other wrestlers, such as Al Korman and Pat Flanagan. In the early 1950s, Stanlee wrestled in the Northeastern United States. Wrestling in New York and New Jersey, he received occasional pushes, challenging for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on several occasions. Stanlee then traveled to California, where he wrestled in the mid-1950s. He later returned to wrestle for Capitol Wrestling in the New York area in the late 1950s. Steve didn't catch on with the public in the same way as Gene did, and as a result never attained the same level of fame. He did have a longer career in the ring, however, and may in fact be the better known brother among fans of 1960s wrestling. While Gene was out of wrestling by the early '60s, Steve remained active. He wrestled both as a singles competitor and as part of a tag team, \\"The Stanlee Steamers\\", with a kayfabe third \\"brother\\", Bob Stanlee (played by Bob Merrill). Unfortunately, Steve won few high-profile matches either way and is generally regarded to have been a \\"jobber to the stars\\" for much of his career. He did, however, win the National Wrestling Alliance's Ohio Heavyweight Championship on July 1, 1961 by defeating Frankie Talaber. He dropped the belt back to Talaber in a rematch later that year. Stanlee also helped train Buddy Bison, who wrestled for Georgia Championship Wrestling for several years. From 1964 to 1966, Stanlee wrestled for the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). He lost the majority of his matches, but he did get victories over Arnold Skaaland and \\"Baron\\" Mikel Scicluna in 1965. After leaving the WWWF, Stanlee wrestled in Hawaii, competing in both singles matches and in a tag team with Jim Hady. He then returned to Georgia Championship Wrestling, putting over the other talent in that promotion as well. Late in life, Steve Stanlee appeared in an interview in the Icons Of Wrestling documentary series. He died in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin on July 2, 2010.

Randall Floyd, In the Realm of Ghosts and Hauntings, 2002, \\"Lady Lovibond: Ghost schooner still sails the English coast\\", pp 103-05; Lional Fanthorpe and Patricia Fanthorpe, Unsolved Mysteries of the Sea, 2004, p. 26ff; Rebecca Stefoff, Ghosts and Spirits, 2007, \\"Spectral sites\\" p. 51f. No contemporary records of the ship or its supposed sinking are to be found. The story goes that the ship was at sea on 13 February because her captain, Simon ReedSailing's Strangest Moments, p. 24, John Harding, 2004 (in some accounts named Simon Peel), had just been married, and was celebrating the occasion with a cruise. According to several accounts, the ship was bound for Oporto in Portugal.Unsolved Mysteries of the Sea, p. 27, Lionel and Patricia Fanthorpe, 2004 Despite the longstanding sailors' superstition that it was bad luck to bring a woman on board, Reed had brought his bride Annetta with him on the ship. According to legend, the first mate, John Rivers, a rival for the hand of the captain's young wife, was pacing the decks in jealous anger. While the captain, his wife and their guests were celebrating the marriage below deck, the first mate was seized with a fit of jealous rage. Casually drawing a heavy, club-like belaying pin from the rail, the mate walked softly up behind the crew member at the wheel and felled him to the deck with one crushing blow. Rivers then seized the wheel and steered the ship onto the treacherous Goodwin Sands, killing everyone aboard.Fanthorpe 2004, p.27. A subsequent inquiry into the disaster recorded a verdict of misadventure. The first supposed sighting of the phantom Lady Lovibond on 13 February 1798 was reported by at least two ships, the Edenbridge captained by James Westlake, and a fishing smack. Its alleged 1848 appearance convinced local seamen that a wreck had occurred ‚Äì they sent out lifeboats from Deal in hopes of rescuing the survivors. Captain Bull Prestwick allegedly sighted her in 1948 and reported that she looked real, but gave off an eerie white glow. There was no reported 1998 sighting. The Goodwin Sands are England's most fertile grounds for ghost ships, and are also the location of the legendary island of Lomea. The Lady Lovibond shares the area with two other phantom vessels: a liner called the , and the Shrewsbury, a man-of-war. Researchers George Behe and Michael Goss came to the conclusion that there is no reliable primary sources that mention the Lady Lovibond before a 1924 article in the Daily Chronicle. They speculated that the ship may have been a fabrication from the journalist, or based on a ship that sailed into view between 1914 and 1924. Behe and Goss speculate that stories about the ship may have been invented for Valentine's Day and there were similarities with the story from other fictional ghost stories.Behe, George; Goss, Michael.

Professionally it is a branch of industrial design, similar to automotive design using identical techniques and methodology, but confined by a set of conventions about what is acceptable to the buying public. These conventions have been defined by the acceptance of the industry and media as a whole to the assumption that the public will only purchase machines that bear more than a passing resemblance to competition machines of whatever kind. In some large OEM motorcycle manufacturers, the term designer can also be applied to the project leader or chief engineer charged with laying down the principal architecture of the vehicle. In recent years it has also become associated with custom or \\"chopper\\" builder culture.  Professional design  Professional motorcycle designers almost always hold degrees in industrial design, industrial design engineering or similar, and have training in styling, modeling, as well as knowledge in aspects of technology associated with single track vehicles. Although no degree as a specialisation exists per se, the majority of candidates graduate through colleges and universities with established transportation design courses, and are trained as automotive designers. Most OEM motorcycle manufacturers, such as Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki, BMW, Ducati, Piaggio and others have in-house design studios dedicated to this purpose, while others such as Yamaha and KTM depend on specialised independent design consultancies.  Methodology = Design and engineering relationships  Due to the high importance of mechanical components or even exposed engines to motorcycle styling, almost always designers will have a greater sensitivity to and awareness of engineering than will typical car designers. In OEM situations, large teams of professional engineers and specialists will collaborate on each project development, allowing the designer to focus on the more intangible or subjective aspects of design, such as styling, human-machine interface psychology, and market and cultural relationships. In other matters such as pure mechanical ergonomics (such as seat height, handlebar placement, etc.), or basic layout (the location of major components, storage, etc.) there is usually considerable overlap between the designer and engineer. The designer will nominally approach each problem from a human interface, or \\"feel\\" or \\"irrational\\" point of view (example : \\"Does this material feel cold or warm, and is this feeling appropriate to this vehicle's target consumer?\\"), while the engineer will attack each problem with the \\"rational\\" or clinical approach of empirically weighing the cause and effect of each design decision against the project's technical and economic design targets (example : \\"Can this material be moulded into the designer's desired shape? Will that be too expensive to produce?\\")  Research and Concept Design  In OEM motorcycle design, the normal procedure of developing a new motorcycle involves the same steps in other professional design disciplines : identifying a target consumer, researching them to identify benchmarks and project targets, then proposing concept directions in a written form known as a Design Brief or QFD. From this point, artwork is developed to visually communicate the designer's ideas. These are presented in 2Db drawing or illustrated form, from which a winning direction is down selected for further development. Once a satisfactory design is established on paper (the term paper is a generalization that can include traditional hand renderings, digital artwork or CAD drawings), then full scale modeling begins to realise the design in tangible 3D form.  Styling  Often used as an interchangeable term with \\"design\\", styling is in fact just one component of the design process. Typically, styling is developed through sketches, renderings and illustrations then realised in 3D form using automotive styling clay, specialised industrial modeling foams such as Sibatool, Renshape or Epiwood, or in increasingly limited cases plaster or body filler. As the most subjective part of the design process, the various members of the development team must depend heavily on the judgment, skill and experience of the appointed designer to create an appropriate look. The most misunderstood element and the most dangerous to the success of a product, is the idea that team members should evaluate the design based on personal tastes or preferences. Industrial design is not an art form, but a focused creative expression using the scientific data and analysis in the Design Brief and QFD as ultimate guidelines. The target user, their needs and tastes should be reflected in the final design, not necessarily exclusively those of the design team. Of course, many complex variables such as the OEM brand identity, past successes and failures, and whimsical trends often skew or distort styling decisions. In instances where the factors are overwhelming, OEM's may err on the side of cautious conservative design.  Parallel development  Because of the need to reduce development time and costs, the \\"styling\\" design model is usually developed in parallel with the engineering 3D design. While there is an increasing amount of digital design input in the modern OEM design process, nearly all major motorcycle manufacturers still rely on full scale clay models to render the master style model, then scan and import the styling surfaces into suitable 3D software packages (Alias, CATIA, ISEM Surf) for integration into the 3D engineering CAD platform (CATIA, ProEngineer, etc.). Once combined, the design team can virtually refine the motorcycle by optimising component assembly, checking for any undesirable interferences between parts, and predict and eliminate possible engineering problems. Typically, designers and engineers will have the greatest number of conflicts during this phase of development, as designers will fight to maintain the original styling and design of the clay model and artwork into the production vehicle, while the engineer will eliminate all problems in the most efficient manner possible. The success of the final product depends heavily on the level of cooperation between these often conflicting needs.  Amateur and specialists = Custom builders  In recent years, largely due to the popularity of television programs like Orange County Chopper and Biker Build-off, the building of one of a kind \\"chopper\\" or \\"cruiser\\" type motorcycles has become more mainstream, leading to a flourishing builder industry. As a whole, these vehicles are not designed in the professional sense, but rather crafted by hand by metal workers and artisans using traditional skills. The resulting vehicles tend to be very elaborate, expensive and difficult or impossible to reproduce in mass production, but are highly valued for the same reasons. Among custom motorcycle culture, certain names have become famous for their creations and have led to mainstream acceptance of previously unacceptable design solutions such as extreme ergonomics, totally rigid rear wheels without the benefit of suspension, minimal lighting and limited ground clearance for cornering. These design characteristics are purely emotional in nature, being led by styling and image rather than technical or performance considerations.  \\"Specials\\"  Custom and specials motorcycles are similar to the above but tend to be super sport type motorcycles, or at least high-performance based, using many special add-on parts, one-of-a-kind or limited series frames, racing wheels and parts or hand-made components to maximise performance. While modifying motorcycles is an activity as old as the motorcycle itself, the \\"special\\" culture or \\"streetfighter\\" began to flourish in the mid-1970s as a response to the myriad high performance Japanese motorcycles then available, but whose power far exceeded their handling. Individuals would choose premanufactured parts from catalogs or from other bikes and redesign their particular machine to suit their desires. In general this activity is limited to one-of-a-kind vehicles and, as with custom motorcycles, uses very little genuine engineering or design methodology, although some small-scale manufacturers exist who make limited runs of a given model. In some cases, these tiny specialists were successful enough to grow into full-scale OEM companies such as the Buell Motorcycle Company and Bimota of Italy.

It is situated in the Vhembe District of Limpopo in the central Soutpansberg range. The peak with radar station, at 1,719 meters a.s.l., forms a conspicuous landmark visible from the town and the N1 national road. Hanglip mountain is situated in the 354 hectare Hanglip Forest Reserve within the Hanglip State Forest. The state forest contains commercial pine plantations, protected natural forest and bushveld. The pine plantations are harvested in 30 to 40 year cycles for construction wood. Geologically the mountain consists of tilted layers of the Karoo succession including glacial till deposits. Red quartzite deposits and grey andesite lava intrusions are also present. Songozwi was the VhaVenda area, under the VhaDzanani clan and their Chiefs, and later joined by the Mphephu/Ramabulana clan. The VhaDzanani clan have their sacred site in mount Songozwi, while the Ramabulana clan bury their chiefs there at a place or hill called Luatame. The whole region was Dzanani (named after the VhaDzanani) until 1946. This is because Songozwi was made a white-only area after 1913. Vhavenda were then evicted from this fertile area, the last group of Vhavenda left the area around the 60s. Eviction started around Schoemansdal after the 1898/9 Vhavenda - boer War. The boer were led by general Piet Joubert. As safeguard against further attacks, Fort Botha was established under Hanglip some kilometers southwest of Mphephu's kraal. The ruins of the fort are currently off limits, being situated near graves of the Singos and the sacred site of vhaDzanani on the other side. The town of Trichardtsdorp was established after the conflict.

An overdetermined system is almost always inconsistent (it has no solution) when constructed with random coefficients. However, an overdetermined system will have solutions in some cases, for example if some equation occurs several times in the system, or if some equations are linear combinations of the others. The terminology can be described in terms of the concept of constraint counting. Each unknown can be seen as an available degree of freedom. Each equation introduced into the system can be viewed as a constraint that restricts one degree of freedom. Therefore, the critical case occurs when the number of equations and the number of free variables are equal. For every variable giving a degree of freedom, there exists a corresponding constraint. The overdetermined case occurs when the system has been overconstrained -- that is, when the equations outnumber the unknowns. In contrast, the underdetermined case occurs when the system has been underconstrained ‚Äî that is, when the number of equations is fewer than the number of unknowns. Such systems usually have an infinite number of solutions. Systems of equations=An example in two dimensions #1 A system of three linearly independent equations, three lines, no solutions parallel), no solutions #3 A system of three linearly independent equations, three lines (all parallel), no solutions #4 A system of three equations (one equation linearly dependent on the others), three lines (two coinciding), one solution #5 A system of three equations (one equation linearly dependent on the others), three lines, one solution #6 A system of three equations (two equations each linearly dependent on the third), three coinciding lines, an infinitude of solutions Consider the system of 3 equations and 2 unknowns ( and ), which is overdetermined because 3>2, and which corresponds to Diagram #1: :\\\\begin{align} Y&=-2X-1\\\\ Y&=3X-2\\\\ Y&=X+1. \\\\end{align} There is one solution for each pair of linear equations: for the first and second equations (0.2, ‚àí1.4), for the first and third (‚àí2/3, 1/3), and for the second and third (1.5, 2.5). However, there is no solution that satisfies all three simultaneously. Diagrams #2 and 3 show other configurations that are inconsistent because no point is on all of the lines. Systems of this variety are deemed inconsistent. The only cases where the overdetermined system does in fact have a solution are demonstrated in Diagrams #4, 5, and 6. These exceptions can occur only when the overdetermined system contains enough linearly dependent equations that the number of independent equations does not exceed the number of unknowns. Linear dependence means that some equations can be obtained from linearly combining other equations. For example, Y = X + 1 and 2Y = 2X + 2 are linearly dependent equations because the second one can be obtained by taking twice the first one. Matrix form Any system of linear equations can be written as a matrix equation. The previous system of equations (in Diagram #1) can be written as follows: : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ -3 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} X \\\\ Y \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} Notice that the rows of the coefficient matrix (corresponding to equations) outnumber the columns (corresponding to unknowns), meaning that the system is overdetermined. The rank of this matrix is 2, which corresponds to the number of dependent variables in the system. A linear system is consistent if and only if the coefficient matrix has the same rank as its augmented matrix (the coefficient matrix with an extra column added, that column being the column vector of constants). The augmented matrix has rank 3, so the system is inconsistent. The nullity is 0, which means that the null space contains only the zero vector and thus has no basis. In linear algebra the concepts of row space, column space and null space are important for determining the properties of matrices. The informal discussion of constraints and degrees of freedom above relates directly to these more formal concepts. Homogeneous case The homogeneous case (in which all constant terms are zero) is always consistent (because there is a trivial, all-zero solution). There are two cases, depending on the number of linearly dependent equations: either there is just the trivial solution, or there is the trivial solution plus an infinite set of other solutions. Consider the system of linear equations: Li = 0 for 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ M, and variables X1, X2, ..., XN, where each Li is a weighted sum of the Xis. Then X1 = X2 = ... = XN = 0 is always a solution. When M < N the system is underdetermined and there are always an infinitude of further solutions. In fact the dimension of the space of solutions is always at least N ‚àí M. For M ‚â• N, there may be no solution other than all values being 0. There will be an infinitude of other solutions only when the system of equations has enough dependencies (linearly dependent equations) that the number of independent equations is at most N ‚àí 1\\\\. But with M ‚â• N the number of independent equations could be as high as N, in which case the trivial solution is the only one. Non-homogeneous case In systems of linear equations, Li=ci for 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ M, in variables X1, X2, ..., XN the equations are sometimes linearly dependent; in fact the number of linearly independent equations cannot exceed N+1. We have the following possible cases for an overdetermined system with N unknowns and M equations (M>N). * M = N+1 and all M equations are linearly independent. This case yields no solution. Example: x = 1, x = 2. * M > N but only K equations (K < M and K ‚â§ N+1) are linearly independent. There exist three possible sub-cases of this: **K = N+1. This case yields no solutions. Example: 2x = 2, x = 1, x = 2. **K = N. This case yields either a single solution or no solution, the latter occurring when the coefficient vector of one equation can be replicated by a weighted sum of the coefficient vectors of the other equations but that weighted sum applied to the constant terms of the other equations does not replicate the one equation's constant term. Example with one solution: 2x = 2, x = 1. Example with no solution: 2x + 2y = 2, x + y = 1, x + y = 3. **K < N. This case yields either infinitely many solutions or no solution, the latter occurring as in the previous sub-case. Example with infinitely many solutions: 3x + 3y = 3, 2x + 2y = 2, x + y = 1. Example with no solution: 3x + 3y + 3z = 3, 2x + 2y + 2z = 2, x + y + z = 1, x + y + z = 4. These results may be easier to understand by putting the augmented matrix of the coefficients of the system in row echelon form by using Gaussian elimination. This row echelon form is the augmented matrix of a system of equations that is equivalent to the given system (it has exactly the same solutions). The number of independent equations in the original system is the number of non-zero rows in the echelon form. The system is inconsistent (no solution) if and only if the last non- zero row in echelon form has only one non-zero entry that is in the last column (giving an equation 0 = c where c is a non-zero constant). Otherwise, there is exactly one solution when the number of non-zero rows in echelon form is equal to the number of unknowns, and there are infinitely many solutions when the number of non-zero rows is lower than the number of variables. Putting it another way, according to the Rouch√©‚ÄìCapelli theorem, any system of equations (overdetermined or otherwise) is inconsistent if the rank of the augmented matrix is greater than the rank of the coefficient matrix. If, on the other hand, the ranks of these two matrices are equal, the system must have at least one solution. The solution is unique if and only if the rank equals the number of variables. Otherwise the general solution has k free parameters where k is the difference between the number of variables and the rank; hence in such a case there are an infinitude of solutions. Exact solutions All exact solutions can be obtained, or it can be shown that none exist, using matrix algebra. See System of linear equations#Matrix solution. Approximate solutions The method of ordinary least squares can be used to find an approximate solution to overdetermined systems. For the system Ax = b, the least squares formula is obtained from the problem :\\\\min_{x}\\\\Vert Ax - b \\\\Vert, the solution of which can be written with the normal equations, :x =(A^{\\\\mathrm{T}}A)^{-1}A^{\\\\mathrm{T}}b, where {\\\\mathrm{T}} indicates a matrix transpose, provided (A^{\\\\mathrm{T}}A)^{-1} exists (that is, provided A has full column rank). With this formula an approximate solution is found when no exact solution exists, and it gives an exact solution when one does exist. However, to achieve good numerical accuracy, using the QR factorization of A to solve the least squares problem is preferred. In general use The concept can also be applied to more general systems of equations, such as systems of polynomial equations or partial differential equations. In the case of the systems of polynomial equations, it may happen that an overdetermined system has a solution, but that no one equation is a consequence of the others and that, when removing any equation, the new system has more solutions. For example, (x-1)(x-2)=0, (x-1)(x-3)=0 has the single solution x=1, but each equation by itself has two solutions.

Djouce is one of a few Irish mountains for which the Irish Office of Public Works (OPW) maintain a boarded mountain trail, using railway sleepers, from its base to a point close to its summit; making the mountain even more accessible to the public, but while also protecting the underlying bog and soil from human erosion. Djouce is popular with hill walkers, and it lies along the 131-kilometre Wicklow Way; on its southern slopes at a senic viewpoint is the J.B. Malone memorial stone, dedicated to the creator of the Wicklow Way. Naming According to Irish academic Paul Tempan, Djouce is sometimes referred to Dowse in historical sources. Tempan notes that the old Irish word for \\"d√≠gas\\" is high or lofty, but that while a \\"Sliab Digsa\\" is mentioned in the Metrical Dindshenchas, the second word is interpreted as a woman's name; potentially showing the meaning of \\"d√≠gas\\" was unclear even at the time of the Metrical Dindshenchas (12th- century). The OSI Map uses the term Djouce Mountain.  Geography  The River Dargle rises on the northern flank of the mountain, close to the source of the River Liffey in the Featherbeds; they rise either side of the catchment boundary, the Liffey flowing west and the Dargle flowing east. Powerscourt Waterfall, one of the highest waterfall in Ireland, lies on its eastern slope. Djouce overlooks to the west the highlands around the Sally Gap; to the east the Roundwood / Calary Bog plateau. It also overlooks the corrie lake of Lough Tay to the southwest. It is bounded to the west by the R115; to the south by the R759 and to the west by the R755. Its southern and eastern flanks are heavily forested, up to and above the 2,000 feet contour, mainly with Sitka spruce plantations. As these trees are clear-felled (when they mature), a policy of the reinstatement of native tree species is being pursued, either through planting or natural regeneration. Djouce's southern shoulder is called White Hill , and to the north of Djouce, across a small saddle is War Hill Djouce's prominence of qualifies it as a Marilyn, and it also ranks it as the 42nd-highest mountain in Ireland on the MountainViews Online Database, 100 Highest Irish Mountains, where the minimum prominence threshold is 100 metres. Hill walking J.B. Malone memorial stone on Djouce Mountain in County Wicklow. Djouce is a popular destination for hillwalkers due to its accessibility and views offered. The main route to the summit of Djouce is via the Boardwalk path that was created by the OPW in 1997‚Äì1999 using old railway sleepers, and since upgraded, to protect the ground and bog from human erosion. This route starts from the Ballinastoe Wood car-park, or the adjacent J.B. Malone car-park (off the R759 road). The first objective is the scenic point at the J.B. Malone memorial stone which overlooks Lough Tay with views across to Luggala (or Fancy Mountain). The boarded path then rises up to White Hill, before taking a ninety-degree turn northwards to the summit slopes of Djouce. At this point, the boarded path takes another ninety-degree turn eastwards along the Wicklow way (following this path leads to Powerscourt Waterfall and Enniskerry, alternative starting points for Djouce), however, climbers on Djouce leave the boardwalk to take a stone and gravel path to the summit. The route from the car-park and back is 7-kilometres and can be completed without special hiking shoes and requires minimal navigational skills (due to the existence of the paths throughout the route). View into Lough Tay and Luggala from the J.B. Malone stone Alternative versions aim to create a \\"loop route\\" by avoiding the direct return to the boarded path on the descent of Djouce, and instead, walking over the bogland to get to forest paths in Ballinastoe Wood that return to the car-parks; other routes expand on this \\"loop route\\" by also taking in War Hill to the north of Djouce to create a longer 15-kilometre \\"loop-route\\".  Teresa Wall vs NPWS (2016)  Boardwalk leading up to the J.B. Malone memorial stone The future of boarded mountain paths and trails in Ireland was put in doubt when a climber, Teresa Wall, successfully sued the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in the Circuit Court for Euro 40,000 in 2016 for an injury sustained in on the Djouce boarded walk (she required seven stitches after tripping on the boardwalk and cutting her knee near the J.B. Malone memorial stone); however, her award was overturned in February 2017 following a High Court appeal by the NPWS, which rejected her arguments that a \\"trip hazard\\" is the same whatever the location. 1946 Air crash On 12 August 1946, a Junkers Ju 52/3m, carrying a group of 21 girl guides on a French government-funded trip to meet Irish girl guides, crashed into the upper south-western slopes of Djouce mountain in very poor weather. The crash completely ripped the engines from the plane, and thus the fuselage did not catch fire; all of the 27 passengers on board survived the crash, although some had severe injuries.

(Summer) Dundurn Street is a Lower City arterial road in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. It is a two-way street that starts off at Mountain Face Park, Niagara Escarpment in front of the Bruce Trail as a collector road, right behind Hillcrest Avenue and then turns into a four lane thoroughfare from Aberdeen Avenue northward to York Boulevard where it ends in front of Dundurn Park. The section of Dundurn Street north of Main Street was designated as part of Highway 2, until January 1, 1998. History Dundurn Street South neighbourhood Dundurn Park, \\"Mystery building\\" Dundurn Street, originated with Sir Allan MacNab who named his home Dundurn Castle and its landscaped grounds Dundurn Park. Originally Dundurn Street, South of King Street West was known as Garth Street up to 1913. Dundurn is a Gaelic word meaning \\"the fort on the water.\\" (sic - This is a persistent incorrect translation perpetuated in many historical works about Dundurn Castle. The original source of the error is not known. Dundurn actually derives from the Gaelic words d√πn meaning \\"hill fort\\" and d√≤rn meaning \\"fist\\", thus Dundurn means \\"hill fort of a fist\\". It is named after Sir Allan MacNab's ancestral family home in Dundurn, Perthshire, Scotland, just east of Loch Earn, which was the site of an ancient Pictish hill fort named D√πn D√≤rn. So named because the hill upon which it sat is shaped like a fist. There are many Gaelic words referring to water, none of which resembles the place name element durn. The erroneous translation \\"fort on the water\\" likely derives from a confusion with the Scots word burn, which means \\"creek\\" and is not a Gaelic word at all. - citation to be added shortly) Originally, Dundurn Street was called Garth Street. The Hamilton Military Museum opened in 1976 and is situated inside Dundurn Park adjacent to Dundurn Castle. It tells the story of the service given by citizens of the Hamilton area from the time of the American Revolution to World War II. The Staircase originally was opened by Hugh MacLeod in 1998. The Staircase evolved and expanded from an improvisational comedy workshop to include an art gallery, a cafe, a theatre for film and live acts, and a rehearsal space. A former variety store next door was also acquired. Bruce Trail One can reach the Bruce Trail via the stairway on Dundurn Street South. The trail cuts through the city along the Niagara Escarpment (mountain) and used by many locals for a full days hike. The Trail is 430 miles long and starts at Niagara Falls, passes through Hamilton and ends at the Bruce Peninsula. Hikers are led to scenic gorges, hidden waterfalls and places of quiet charm.

It was theatrically released in January 1942. Plot Commander Don Winslow is returned to the Office of Naval Intelligence from his command of his cruiser to investigate strange events on the Pacific island of Tangita, noticeably a ship being torpedoed. He discovers that there is a ring of saboteurs and enemy agents who are trying to destroy ships carrying supplies to the troops stationed in the islands and sabotage the war effort. Though the US Navy is preparing to build a naval base on Tangita, an unknown foreign power secretly has a subterranean submarine base beneath the island with the goal of preventing the American base from being completed. He sets out with three assistants to find the mastermind behind the activities. CastProduction The serial was based on the comic strip by Commander Frank V. Martinek, which was approved by the US Navy. The strip gained new meaning with the approach of World War II, which would also affect the serial: \\"Its presentation as a Universal serial in October 1941 - just before the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor in December - was one of the most timely contributions of the serial field.\\" The Universal serials for 1941-42 were meant to run: Riders of Death Valley, Sea Raiders, Head Hunters of the Amazon, Gang Busters. Head Hunters of the Amazon was, however, dropped in favor of this serial.

Life  Luigi Lippomano was the illegitimate son of Venetian patrician Bartolo Lippomano, who determined to provide an ecclesiastical career for his son.Tacchella Il Processo agli eretici veronesi; Wojtyska, Aloisius Lippomano He graduated from the university at Padua and eventually entered into service at the papal court in Rome. Distinguished for his piety and integrity of character, he was among the first in Rome to join the \\"Oratorio della Carit√†\\" founded by St. Cajetan of Tiene, and composed of distinguished men, who in the Roman Curia were the leaven of Church reform, and afterwards took a prominent part in the Council of Trent. In 1528 he accompanied the court of Pope Clement VII to Orvieto after the sack of Rome by imperial troops. Later that year he sent his brother Thomas a detailed firsthand report of the great flood of the Tiber. In 1538, he was consecrated titular Bishop of Methone by Cardinal Gian Pietro Carafa, future Pope Paul IV, and appointed coadjutor cum jure successionis to his cousin Pietro Lippomano, Bishop of Bergamo, who was also active in Catholic reform. Due to his illegitimate birth and some say also opposition from German cardinals, Luigi would never become a cardinal. In 1542 Pope Paul III sent him as nuncio to Portugal to announce the convocation of the Council of Trent. He returned to Italy and took an active part in the council, following the council fathers to Bologna in 1547, where he attended all the sessions. When Pietro was transferred to Verona in 1544, Luigi accompanied him. Pietro died in Edinburgh Castle during the summer of 1548 while on a diplomatic mission in Scotland, and Luigi succeeded him as Bishop of Verona. In 1548 he was sent with Bertano and Pighi to Germany. From 1551 he was one of the presidents of the Council until its suspension (25 April 1552), during that period the dogmatic decrees on the Eucharist, penance, and extreme unction were published, as well as several decrees on reform. In 1555 Pope Paul IV sent him as nuncio to Poland, where, on account of his lively opposition to the pretensions of the Protestant nobility, his reception was mixed. Tired and sick he returned to Verona in February 1557, and later, after recovery to Rome, where he stayed until his death on August 15, 1559.Tacchella Il Processo agli eretici veronesi; Wojtyska, Aloisius Lippomano; Teter Sinners on Trial, chapter 5  Works  Amid his numerous official duties, he did not neglect his studies, which, however, he directed towards spiritual edification. Thus he wrote \\"Catenae in Genesin\\" (Paris, 1546), \\"In Exodum\\" (Paris, 1550)‚Äîboth works republished at Rome in 1557; (Venice, 1553). His chief work was Sanctorum priscorum patrum vitae (8 vols., Venice, 1551‚Äì60; 2 vols., Louvain 1564), for which he engaged the services of many learned men, and himself, on his travels, searched libraries and archives. This collection gave a great impulse to scientific hagiography, and opened the way for Surius and the Bollandists.

It functions as the web relationship influence among the cyber citizens and it aims to make desirable comments about an organization, its products and services, news viewed by its target audiences and lessen its undesirable comments to a large degree. Online public relations shows differences from traditional public relations. One of these is associated with its platforms. Compared with traditional public relations channels (such as TV, radio and printed press), the network systems used for online public relations vary from search to social platforms. In the era of digital marketing, the major online public relations tools for the public relations professionals and marketers such as content marketing, search engine optimization are the results of mixture of digital technologies and public relations. Those approaches have become the mainstream digital marketing machines and learning to take advantage of these marketing tools is an essential part of modern public relations strategies. Online Public Relations is very similar to traditional Public Relations in the sense that it‚Äôs about influencing the public instead than buying placement for brand content. The influence could result in a story in a magazine, newspaper review on google, yelp or blog. It could additionally result in other online pick-up, which include by way of social media influences.  The Goal of Online Public Relations  The goal is to have a lasting high quality impact on the external image of a company or brand. In addition, some partial goals are defined by: # Acquisition and retention of new customers # Communication of information # Increase of attention # Creating a high cost-benefit ratio # Improving (online-) reputation # Measuring and controlling success # Achieving a high degree of actuality  Social media & Digital PR today  Public relations both traditional and digital, have always based itself on relationships. In the same way, social media is all about connecting people or connecting companies with its costumers and target demographics. When social media and public relations are merged, it‚Äôs easy to start interactions on two-way conversations with your target market, what was a struggle back in the days for the PR department. At the same time, is a very valuable source for feedback and a way of recognizing what‚Äôs most important to your audience. On the other hand, through the years, measuring effectiveness of messages or campaigns has been really hard. Nonetheless, now a days with social media, it's easy to see metrics, analyze data, highlight engagements and from there make decisions based on the impacts being made. Finally is a great alliance for brand awareness, the perfect platforms to speak. Tell your message, show the company culture, and sell your vision. It is quite a game changer these days, a costumer will fold towards a company where they can search for reviews, company values and so on, over a product where no information is to be found online.  Differences between online and traditional public relations  * The organizations can communicate with its audiences directly through a variety of online platforms instead of depending on the media channels only * Audiences exposed to the information are linked to the network and then the flow of information is multi-directional among people * Multiple sources of information provided can be accessible to audiences * Audiences are entitled to the right to review, comment and assess *Online PR targets social media, web searches, blogs, and websites in addition to targeting traditional media outlets  Differences between Views of Traditional Public Relations vs. Public Relations used as a Marketing Function: = Views of the Traditional Public Relations Department:  * It is a Department which acts as a link between an organization and outside parties (customers). Its work is to determine an evaluate the public approach * Suggest management to construct guidelines and procedures relating to public interests * It is a separate Department whose job is to sincerely execute communication program with outside parties and business partners  Views on Public Relation as more of Marketing Function:  * Public Relations is an integral part of marketing communication mix, where the company promotes its brand and builds relationships with outside parties through its specialized functions, such as seminars and press conferences. * Public Relations Department reports to the Marketing Department, whose act is to create a larger picture which focuses on the ultimate goal of in organization, which is strong branding and long term relations with its customers. Tactics * Buzz marketing. Buzz marketing means marketers first identify the Alpha consumer in terms of a new idea and technologies and then promote specifically made messages such as a funny video or email with the help of the network of those Alpha consumers. One of the typical examples was that Paper Magazine issued a nearly naked image of Kim Kardashian on their cover, then viewers who saw the photo responded immediately and made it spread quickly. As the whole version had come out, nearly one percent of the entire web activities in the US got involved. * Manage negative comments on third-party websites There are relevant worries about some counter-arguments about brands reputation. Marketers are responsible for coping with unfavorable mentions quickly through online reputation management such as Google Alerts to influence people' attitudes toward those negative comments. * Display information online The internet platforms provide organizations a variety of channels to issue timely news and information. The forms of information can vary from search to social to brand management platforms such as email alerts or news stories. These contents provided by organizations allow media channels to find news sources easily, which can increase the exposure of organizations and then improve public relations. * link building. Link building is used to achieve and create hyperlinks to other third-party website or related site to help netizens to navigate between websites. Building high-quality links can have an effect on search result ranking.

The film stars M√©li√®s himself as an apothecary who blows a copy of his own head up to enormous dimensions, but who is unable to get his assistant to perform the stunt as expertly. The special effect of the inflated head, made with a novel combination of purpose- built moving equipment and multiple exposures, evokes the modern close-up and enjoys an iconic place among M√©li√®s's works. Plot In a laboratory, an apothecary plans a novel experiment. Putting a living duplicate of his own head on a table, he uses a bellows to swell the head up to gigantic size. The head enjoys itself by making faces and laughing with the apothecary, who then completes the experiment by letting the air out and returning the head to normal. The apothecary then attempts to have his assistant reproduce the experiment, but the assistant inflates the head too much, and it explodes in a bang of smoke. The angry apothecary throws the assistant out of the room. Production M√©li√®s appears in the film as the apothecary and as his duplicate head. To create the illusion of the expanding head, M√©li√®s surrounded himself with a black background and used a specially built ramp to move himself gradually closer to the stationary camera. The head was then superimposed onto the rest of the image using the multiple exposure technique. The other special effects used are substitution splices and pyrotechnics. Release and reception The Man with the Rubber Head was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 382‚Äì383 in its catalogues, where it was advertised as a grande nouveaut√©. The film was sold in American catalogues as The Man With the Rubber Head and in British catalogues as A Swelled Head.Malth√™te & Mannoni 2008, p. 344.

The plan was announced by the Mayor of Caguas, William Miranda Mar√≠n, along with former governor An√≠bal Acevedo Vil√° on . The agreement signed creates a public-private society between three parties: the central government, the city council and a regional partnership; it entails an investment of $200 million by the central government through the Government Bank of Development (Banco Gubernamental de Fomento in Spanish). The total cost of the project is estimated at between $375 million and $400 million. The execution of the project will be in charged by Mideast Technology Initiative \\"Tecnol√≥gica Centro Oriental\\" (INTECO),intecopr.org a non-profit organization that groups municipal governments, academic and industrial institutions of the region. The new line will include two stops in Caguas that will connect the Tren Urbano (Urban Train in English) in San Juan.

Current traffic levels continue to remain heavily congested during rush hour periods. The original schedule was set to begin with Tren Interurbano's technical proposals being revealed by the end of 2007 with several firms bidding for the construction contract shortly thereafter. Beginning stages of construction were originally scheduled for the first quarter of 2008, which was planned to finish around the end of 2009 or the first quarter of 2010, allowing for two years of construction time.oficinascomerciales.es Proyecto de tren ligero entre Caguas y San Juan, Novedades= Press Release; El Nuevo D√≠a 11/05/07.

Starting May 2013, proposals will be developed as well as negotiations with interested construction companies. During the months of September and October, proposals will be received and a company willing to build the rail will be chosen. Finally, during November or December, it is expected the construction will start. According to the current government administration, it is projected that the train will be operating before elections on 2016. Stations The new train will link San Juan's Tren Urbano Cupey or Centro M√©dico stations with Las Catalinas Mall and Plaza Centro stations in Caguas. Several intermediate stops are proposed, one of these being Montehiedra, but according to the proposed route published in March 2013, Montehiedra will not be considered for a station.

In 1971, at age 16, he got his first DJing gig at The Roundtable. In February 1973, he opened The Gallery in Chelsea, Manhattan with his older brother Joe Siano. At the time, he was considered to be the best DJ in the city, and this helped the club attain its legendary status. New York Magazine called it \\"one of the five most visually breathtaking nightspots of our time\\".Nicky Siano at deejaybooking.com The Gallery even took over from David Mancuso's Loft for a short period in the 1970s as the hottest underground dance party. When Steve Rubell opened Studio 54, he asked Siano to be one of its resident DJs, so while remaining at The Gallery on weekends, during the week he could be seen at Studio 54 or one of the other now legendary discos that appeared at that time. Siano worked the DJ booth at Bianca Jagger's infamous Studio 54 birthday party. He was known for playing underground alternative music as opposed to the disco hits that were dominating the nightclub scene. Siano was fired from Studio 54 after four months due to excessive drug use. He claims that he was fired because Studio 54 owner Steve Rubell wanted the club to be the star and not the DJ. Having been one of the most successful DJs of his time, Siano went into production. In 1977, he produced his first big single \\"Kiss Me Again\\" on Sire Records, which sold more than 300,000 records. The start of the 1980s proved a rocky time for Siano, with his dropping out of the scene. Siano continues to tour extensively as well as produce. His release Power of Love, featuring Arline Burton, was launched at the 2007 WMC. As well as his tour and production schedule, Siano has released a film documenting the Gallery nightclub with footage shot in the club during the 1970s. On October 18, 2011, Siano reappeared at Studio 54 for the club's one-night reopening, organized by Sirius XM Radio. He played all 1970s disco from the club's original days.

It is situated in the city's north-west, on the west bank of the Caledonian Canal, and is often considered a suburb to the city. For most of the city's history, Scorguie was a large tract of farmland tied to an area known as \\"Knockgurr\\". Throughout the 19th century it was owned by the Duffs of Muirtown, along with a small portion of nearby Merkinch. The farm appears in a court report from 1857, in which it states crofters renting the land were to pay \\"¬£90 a year\\" (roughly ¬£9,200 today). After centuries of existence as pastureland, housing projects in Scorguie began sometime after the Second World War. As of 2018, the population is close to 3,000, with roughly 1,500 individual dwellings. Scorguie is home to Moray Firth Radio (MFR) station, established in 1982 as the Highland's first major radio station.

Career Born in 1908 in New York City as Gladys Quartararo, she came from a close family and was the youngest of seven children. She often played supporting roles and sometimes a love interest for the lead male actor. In One Stolen Night (1928) Quartero was cast with Betty Bronson and William Collier. The story concerns a British World War I soldier who comes to the assistance of an enslaved dancer. In Frozen River (1929) she was paired with Raymond McKee as the motion picture's romantic leads. In 1931 Quartero appeared in Arizona, an early John Wayne movie. Playing \\"Conchita,\\" she is a source of strife in Wayne's relationship to the characters depicted by Laura La Plante and June Clyde. She performed again with Wayne in The Man from Monterey (1933). Her final screen performances show Quartero playing smaller parts, such as the role of a Cuban dancer in Torchy Blane in Panama (1938), a native dancer in Green Hell (1940) and a bar-girl in A Lady Takes a Chance (1943). Death Nina Quartero died in Woodland Hills, California in 1985, aged 78. Publicity stunt Quartero once tried a publicity stunt by claiming that she was betrothed to Notre Dame All-American quarterback Frank Carideo. Carideo demanded a retraction of Quartero's engagement announcement, although he admitted he knew her from a time when each resided in Mount Vernon, New York. He had also visited her home, in Beverly Hills, California, prior to the 1930 University of Southern California game, to exchange greetings.

The goal is to address different kinds of learning not covered in a traditional classroom. By including LWL with a traditional classroom, students are better equipped to attain whole person development and to develop lifelong learning skills. It is the focus of education in Hong Kong, and was developed for higher education at the University of Surrey England. Lifewide education is the means by which an institution encourages, supports and recognizes learners' lifewide learning. It is an approach to visualising learning and personal development as a whole of life enterprise. Lifewide learning adds important detail to the broad pattern of human development we call lifelong learning ‚Äì all the learning and development one gains as one progresses along the pathway of one's life. Lifewide learning recognizes that most people, no matter what their age or circumstances, simultaneously inhabit a number of different spaces ‚Äì like work or education, being a member of a family, being involved in clubs or societies, traveling, taking holidays, and looking after their own well-being mentally, physically, and spiritually. So the timeframes of lifelong learning and the spaces of life-wide learning will characteristically intermingle, and who we are and who we are becoming are the consequences of this intermingling. Most people have the freedom to choose which spaces they want to occupy and how they want to occupy them. In these spaces, they make decisions about what to be involved in, meet and interact with different people, have different sorts of relationships, adopt different roles and identities, and think, behave and communicate in different ways. In these different spaces, they encounter different sorts of challenges and problems, seize, create or miss opportunities, and aspire to live and achieve their ambitions. The promise of lifewide education is that people can more fully appreciate and value their lives for the potential they hold for enabling them to become the people they want and need to become (in other words, their everyday pathway to actualising themselves). 'Lifewide Education' a not for profit, community-based organisation was founded in 2011 to encourage and support the growth and exchange of knowledge and practices in educational settings relating to lifewide learning. Its programme of scholarly work explores the many dimensions of lifewide learning.

The station was opened on 7 June 1971, replacing Alnabru Station. The former was dismantled to make room for Alnabru Freight Terminal. The station serves mostly an industrial area. History When the Trunk Line was completed in 1854 there was no station serving the Alna area. From the 1880s there was a growing industry in the area. There was a station named Alna which was established on 24 March 1872, but was closed already on 1 December 1873. Alnabru Station at roughly the same place opened on 20 January 1902. It initially took the name Alna, but this was changed to Alnabru on 1 May. The station was a major cargo terminal and the terminal of two freight lines, the Alna Line and the Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line.Bjerke & Holom: 54 The Norwegian State Railways bought the farm Nordre Alna in 1918, allowing for a further development of the station. The site was eventually determined to act as the new main cargo yard for Oslo. Alnabru Freight Terminal was taken into use in 1970.Bjerke & Holom: 33 This forced the Trunk Line to be rerouted past the freight yard, resulting in a new section of track being built on the north side. Alna Station was placed on this segment. The new station was taken into use for trains in the direction of Oslo from 7 June 1971. The other track was taken into use on 14 June. The same day Alnabru Station was closed and subsequently demolished. Alna Station was originally named Alnabru, but took the name Alna in February 1973.Bjerke & Holom: 55 Facilities Alna Station is situated from Oslo Central Station. The line past Alna is double track and electrified. The station features an island platform with a shed. The platform is and tall. The station is not step-free, as access is provided by an overpass with stairs. The station lacks a ticket machine. Service Vy serves Alna with line L1 of the Oslo Commuter Rail. L1 calls at all stations, running from Lillestr√∏m Station along the Trunk Line past Alna to Oslo Central Station and then along the Drammen Line to Asker Station before serving the Spikkestad Line and terminating at Spikkestad Station. Alna has four trains per direction per hour. Travel time is 7 minutes to Oslo Central Station and 22 minutes to Lillestr√∏m.

The title sequence featured Alexei Sayle as an innocent, newly arrived man in London singing cheerful lyrics and dancing around Trafalgar Square, in a spoof of American television shows such as the Mary Tyler Moore Show. It was the successor to Alexei Sayle's Stuff, and predecessor of Alexei Sayle's Merry-Go- Round. Sayle's co-star from Channel 4's The Gravy Train, future dual Academy Award winner Christoph Waltz appeared in a sketch during its run. Recurring characters The show differed from Alexei Sayle's Stuff mainly in its introduction of recurring characters who include: * Alexei's alter ego, Bobby Chariot. Bobby is a Scouse comic of the old school, who appears as a warm-up act during breaks when the show has supposedly 'broken down' for technical reasons. His catchphrase \\"How you diddling?\\" will invariably fail to ignite the audience, prompting the reply, \\". . . Bloody sod you, then.\\" He will then regale them with anecdotes about his wife having left him, his drink problem, and sleeping in his Jag. He is an archetypal 'traditional' comedian who combines the least politically correct sides of Jimmy Tarbuck, Ken Dodd and Stan Boardman with a bit of Mr Sayle. He will often pick on the audience for cheap laughs, then turn on them when they remain unresponsive. Often, rather than being seen in front of the audience, he is pictured sitting among them, pouring his heart out to some poor uninterested, bored soul. Bobby also features in the subsequent show Alexei Sayle's Merry-Go-Round. * Bobby's even more depressing and hopeless gag writer, played by Stephen Lewis, still bashing out bad puns on a manual typewriter. * A caricature of John Smith, who was leader of the Labour Party at the time. * Performance artists Egbert and Bill (a lampoon of real-life artists Gilbert and George), perform together with John Sparkes. * Nancy and Spike. Two radical lesbians who run a feminist bicycle shop in Hackney called \\"Menstrual cycles\\". Depending on viewpoint, these are either very un-PC or overly PC characters. Running sketches Both series of the show included running sketches. * Psycho Ward 11 in Series 1 was a spoof Australian hospital soap featuring Jean Marsh and Peter O'Brien. *Drunk In Time in Series 2 satirised the popular late 1960s cult sci-fi TV series The Time Tunnel. It featured Peter Capaldi as Sayle's fellow drunk time-traveling companion, and also Jenny Agutter and Alfred Marks as the scientists back at the base.

Qualification standards for licensed mariners are universally set by the STCW Convention adopted and promulgated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), while the licenses of individual sailors are issued by the delegated maritime authorities of the member states of the IMO; these may vary in the details of the implementation, including the government agency responsible for licensing and the local names of the grades and qualifications in each particular country. Mariners that do not have a license are referred to as unlicensed mariners or ratings. Licensing by country In the United States, the United States Coast Guard grants licenses to members of the United States Merchant Marine in five categories: deck officers, engineers, staff officers, radio officers, and pilots. The United States Coast Guard has replaced paper licenses with the Merchant Mariners Credential which is a combination of the former Merchant Marine Officers license and Merchant Mariners Document in a small book that looks similar to a passport. Several States within the United States issue a state mariners license for use upon non-federal inland waters. Most of these states honor USCG Merchant Marine licenses as an alternative to state licensing. State licensing programs closely follow the federal guidelines for issuance of these licenses, including the requirements concerning professional maritime training and experience. In the United Kingdom, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency issue licenses, known as Certificates of Competency, in a similar fashion under the amended STCW convention.  Types =Deck officers There are a wide variety of licenses for deck officers, with restrictions of geography and tonnage. Licenses without such restrictions are called unlimited as in Third Mate or Officer of the Watch, Unlimited. The grades of unlimited licenses are: * Master's License for masters and lower grades. * Chief Mate's License for chief mates and lower grades. * Second Mate's License qualifies the holder as second mate or third mate. * Third Mate's License qualifies the holder as third mate. Mariner licenses range from large to small vessels. Smaller charter boat operators may have a charter boat license or a certificate under the Large Yacht Code. Engineers Licenses are issued in the grades of: *Chief Engineer *First Assistant Engineer *Second Assistant Engineer *Third Assistant Engineer *Chief Engineer (limited) *Assistant Engineer (limited) *Designated duty engineer *Chief Engineer (uninspected fishing industry vessels) *Assistant Engineer (uninspected fishing industry vessels) Staff officers Staff officers are issued a Certificate of Registry in the following grades: * Chief purser * Purser * Senior assistant purser * Junior assistant purser * Medical doctor * Professional nurse * Marine physician assistant * Hospital corpsman Radio officers * Radio officer Pilots Pilot licenses vary with tonnage and geography.

It is a dematiaceous (dark-walled) mold normally found in soil, air, cellulose and plant debris. According to the Dictionary of the Fungi (10th edition, 2008), there are about 95 species in the widespread genus. In 1817 Gustav Kunze established the genus Chaetomium (the plume of the helmet) to classify the species C. globosum and C. elatum. No further contributions to the genus were made until 1837 when the publication of Corda described its characteristic asci in his work, Icones Fungorum Hucusque Cognitorum. In 1915, Arthur Houston Chivers produced a complete monographic treatment of the genus, recognizing only 28 of the described 114 species.

Yidisher Kultur Farband=YKUF / Jewish Culture Association /  The Yidisher Kultur Farband (YKUF, rarely called by its English [translated] name, the Jewish Culture Association) was a U.S. association, initially Communist-oriented, formed for preserving and developing Yiddish culture in Yiddish and in English, through an art section, a writers' group, reading circles, and publications. YKUF was founded in Paris in September 1937 by Jewish Communists and their supporters as an international body to disseminate ideology to the Yiddish-reading and Yiddish- speaking community. The organizing meeting was an international congress of Yiddish culture, the first to be held since the 1908 Czernowitz Conference for the Yiddish Language; about 100 delegates attended, including 11 from the United States. The first chairman of YKUF was the non-Communist writer Alexander Mukdoni; the secretary (to 1957) was the poet Zishe Weinper, an efficient fundraiser for YKUF and, according to Melech Epstein, a \\"secret member of the Communist Party.\\" In the U.S., financial support also came from the Jewish People's Fraternal Order, the Jewish section of the International Workers Order. At the time of the non-aggression pact between Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler in August 1939, many of the non-Communist artists and writers affiliated with YKUF left the organization. Branches of the international YKUF were established in various countries. The U.S. branch, founded in 1937, ceased operation soon after the death of Itche Goldberg on December 27, 2006. Prominent cultural figures, such as Kalman Marmor and Nachman Meisel, saw to it that Farlag YKUF, the organization‚Äôs New York-based publishing house, issued highly regarded anthologies and studies of Yiddish literature. It published more than 250 books, including Yiddish fiction and poetry, memoirs (by Reuben Brainin, among others), history, and anthologies such as America in Yiddish Literature (1961). The U.S. YKUF began publishing the journal Yidishe Kultur in 1938, initially a monthly, in recent decades it appeared bimonthly or seven times a year. Meisel, who was not a Communist Party member and had edited a Polish literary magazine, became its first editor; in 1964, he was succeeded by Itche Goldberg, who edited it since that time to 2004. With Goldberg's death, the magazine ceased publication. The political roots of YKUF were more of historical note than ideological tendency in its last decades. In the mid-1990s, contact and rapprochement developed between YKUF and its historically socialist counterpart organization, the Congress for Jewish Culture, also based in New York, as well as the Congress‚Äôs publication, Zukunft (\\"Future\\"). They subsequently cooperated in such activities as commemorations of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, and memorials for the Soviet- Yiddish writers murdered in August 1952 in Moscow 's Lubyanka prison. Yidish Natsionaler Arbeter Farband=Jewish National Workers Alliance /  Members of the NJWA in front of their Minneapolis meeting hall The Yidish Natsionaler Arbeter Farband or Jewish National Workers Alliance (NJWA) was an early Yiddish-speaking Labor Zionist landsmanshaft in North America, founded in 1912.David Bridger, Samuel Wolk, The New Jewish Encyclopedia, Behrman House, Inc, 1976, p.143 Its official organ was the Yidishe Kempfer or Jewish Fighter, edited by Baruch Zuckerman. The Farband operated as a mutual aid society parallel to the political party Poale Zion, organizing cooperative insurance and medical plans and an extensive Yiddish and Hebrew educational system, as well as having developed in the 1920s a cooperative housing building in the Bronx, New York. The Farband even developed and maintained cemeteries for movement members. While mainly based in New York, the Farband was active throughout the United States and Canada, forming local chapters and summer camps in many cities with significant Jewish communities. The summer camp for the New York chapter was called Camp Kinderwelt, located in Upstate New York, and had an adjoining adults camp called Unser Camp. The Farband ran a network of secular schools in the US and Canada, called Folkshulen. In 1931 the Farband Yugnt Clubs, their youth wing, joined with Young Poale Zion to form the Young Poale Zion Alliance as the official youth wing of the entire Labor Zionist movement in America. The Los Angeles branch published Chaim Grade, including the Yiddish originals of The Agunah and The Yeshiva. In 1971, the Farband joined with Poale Zion, the Labor Zionist Organization of America, and the American Habonim Association to form the Labor Zionist Alliance, which in 2004 re-branded and renamed itself as Ameinu.

Reception The Liverpool Daily Post called her \\"one of the nation's best-loved soap babes\\". The Daily Record listed her among \\"The soap stars who boosted the ratings with their shocking clinches\\" for her part in a lesbian storyline. The Daily Record described her saying she \\"overacts her way through another scene\\" when she finds vows Kurt is out of her life for good. The Daily Record also commented on Ruth's relationship with Lewis saying \\"He's just turned from one of the most easy-going blokes around into a woman-beater. Yep, when he finds out Ruth has aborted the baby, he hits her. Not a good move at all. It might be Ruth, but we can't condone this, can we? I'd smash both their heads together, the rotten pair.\\" They described the storyline as a cracker and the attempted rape scenes as \\"some of the grittiest storylines ever seen in a soap\\". All About Soap magazine placed Kurt and Ruth's wedding at number nineteen on their twenty greatest soap weddings list. The Daily Record's Merle Brown commented on Ruth saying \\"while they're at it, why not blow up Ruth, and put her out of her misery. Terri Dwyer, who plays her (after a fashion) is wooden as well, and seeing her painful attempts at emotional scenes is just too much to take.\\" Brown also listed her amongst his least favourite soap characters saying \\"Lewis, my least favourite soap character of all time (although Ruth is right up there with him), is feeling guilty about his tryst with Lorraine and refuses to sleep with her again. Which opens the gates, methinks for Ruth to find out, and a big barney to ensue. Great. I can hardly wait to see Terri Dwyer overact her way through this one.\\" Upon Dwyer receiving a nomination Brown later added \\"if Terri Dwyer wins Best Actress I shall really have to complain. How can she even be nominated?\\". The Sunday Mail commented on her time in the show saying she has had \\"controversial storylines\\" including \\"attempted rape, married young, kicked out by her husband over an affair, then widowed, a lesbian kiss with a 17-year-old, and now an unwanted pregnancy. No wonder the blonde babe gets most of the show's fan letters.\\" The Daily Mirror commented that her Christmas return put the \\"cracker back into Christmas\\". Ruth in Hollyoaks was also known as a rather loud mouthed character, evidence of this is seen in an episode where while she is talking Lucy Benson's hand covers her mouth in order to gag her but Ruth continues to try and talk but just makes muffled sounds under Lucy's hand. The Daily Record commented negatively on Ruth's relationship with Kurt saying that the pair needed a \\"mallet on the head\\" after their marriage breakdown. They added that \\"Ruth is still doing the angst-ridden facial expression in Hollyoaks this week as she and hubby Kurt are nowhere nearer sorting out their relationship\\" and later said Kurt \\"is still pleading for a reconciliation with Ruth\\". Ruth and flatmate Jasmine Bates sleep together after spending the night sharing a bottle of wine. The Daily Record described the storyline saying \\"Wait until the TV watchdog people see this week's Hollyoaks - lesbian kissing scenes at tea-time. Phil Redmond brought you your first lesbian kiss in Brookside a good few years ago now and there was uproar. Now he's at it again in his teen-soap as a good old heart-to-heart between Jas and Ruth over a bottle of wine leads to something more. The next morning, Ruth is not a happy girl at all, as she regrets her night of passion with her flatmate. Oh dear. Sparks will fly.\\" The Daily Record described the brief relationship saying \\"In Hollyoaks it's the end of the road as Jas moves out of Ruth's flat after their night of passion. Ruth, it seems, is not one for the ladies.\\" References Category:Hollyoaks characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1995 Category:Fictional English people of Scottish descent Category:Osborne family (Hollyoaks) Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Ruth Osborne"},{"id":"10161378","text":"Luton is a village in Devon, England, within Teignbridge local authority area.

Situated from Oslo Central Station, it features two platforms. The Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line passes through the station without a platform. Bryn is served by the L1 line of Vy's Oslo Commuter Rail. The station was opened on 1 September 1854, but was originally only a halt to test brakes. Ticket sales commenced in 1858. A new, brick station building was erected in 1884. A new wooden station building was finished on the north side in 1902, designed by and is one of Norway's nine first stations. The original building, designed by Finn Ivar Andreas Knudsen. The station has been proposed redeveloped as a major transit hub for eastern Oslo. History The 1902 station building When the Trunk Line opened as the first railway in Norway on 1 September 1854, Bryn was merely a halt used to test brakes for west-bound trains towards Christiania.Bjerke & Holom: 54 The station was named for the farm Bryn, which means \\"natural meadow\\". It was not classified as a station, but it was therefore possible to board and disembark in that direction. From 2 June 1856 trains in both direction stopped at Bryn. In the third year of operations the railway built a spur from the halt. Bryn received a ticket office the following year and in about 1860 it was fully classified as a station.Norwegian Trunk Railway: 107 The area saw a rapid industrialization with the arrival of the railway, helped by the falls in Alna. Soon afterwards housing started being built in the area. The original wooden station building at Bryn was demolished,Norwegian Trunk Railway: 108 and replaced with a new in brick in 1884.Bjerke & Holom: 55 The station sometime after 1902 By the 1890s the Trunk Line was experiencing sufficient traffic that the railway company decided to built double track on the line from Christiania to Lillestr√∏m Station. At the same time a new freight line, the Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line, was constructed and met up with the Trunk Line at Bryn. This forced the need for a new station building on the opposite, north side of the tracks, which opened in 1902. The former station building was kept and used as a residence for the station master. At the same time the two roads which crossed the tracks as level crossings were replaced with bridges.Norwegian Trunk Railway: 122 With the upgrades a simple interlocking system was installed. The √òstensj√∏ Line of the Oslo Tramway opened past Bryn in 1923. The railway past the station was electrified from on 1 September 1927.Bjerke & Holom: 52 The station received a complete interlocking system from 23 April 1939. The tram line was converted to a metro line in 1966. Bryn Station received centralized traffic control from 24 January 1972, allowing it to be unmanned from 1 July 1975. Facilities Bryn Station is situated from Oslo Central Station, at an elevation of above mean sea level. The station is located at the top of a hill, Brynsbakken, which represents a steep climb for all west-bound freight trains.Faveo: 8 The wooden station building was designed by Finn Ivar Andreas Knudsen. Across from the station building is a brick Swiss chalet style building which previously served as a station master's residence.Hartmann: 107 It is now the headquarters of the Norwegian Railway Club. The west-bound platform The line past Bryn is double track and electrified. The station features two platforms, both long. They are tall, respectively. A third track, the Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line, passes through the station, but there are no platforms along that track. It is only used by freight trains. Platform 1 is universally accessible. Track 2 has access via an overpass which also carries Adolf Hedins vei. This road concurrently carries E6 and Ring 3. Service The Norwegian State Railways serves Grorud with line L1 of the Oslo Commuter Rail. L1 calls at all stations, running from Lillestr√∏m Station along the Trunk Line past Grorud to Oslo Central Station and then along the Drammen Line to Asker Station before serving the Spikkestad Line and terminating at Spikkestad Station. Grorud has four trains per direction per hour. Travel time is 4 minutes to Oslo Central Station and 25 minutes to Lillestr√∏m. Brynseng Station of the Oslo Metro is situated within five minutes' walk of Bryn. The area is also served by Ruter's bus line 23. Bryn is within fare zone 1. Future The station looking west, with the Alna River and the Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line furthest away The National Rail Administration and Ruter have in their Oslo Hub reports identified Bryn as one of three main public transit hubs they wish to develop. The area already features a metro station which covers three metro lines, √òstensj√∏, Lambertseter and Furuset, although the two stations to not have easy access to each other. The railway station has poor access and narrow platforms. An upgrade of the station has been called for, in which the tracks would be moved closer to the river and an island platform established. It could have access from √òstensj√∏veien. Establishing a new hub at Bryn would not only involve several new lines terminating there, but would also require a significant urban renewal of the area. Oslo Bus Terminal has reached its capacity and Ruter wants to decentralize this function. Due to the vicinity to Ring 3 and E6, Bryn has been identified as a suitable location for a south-easterly bus terminal. The Romerike Tunnel passes straight under the metro station. It has been built in such a way that it can easily be rebuilt to feature an underground railway station, situated below street level. Ruter is also working with plans to rebuild Ring 2 as a tramway and build a tram line from Carl Berners plass. In addition they have proposed a tram line from Bryn to √òkern and Sinsen. The 2.6 percent gradient of Brynsbakken makes it difficult to achieve effective freight operations to Alnabru Freight Terminal. The Norwegian National Rail Administration is exploring various concepts to build a new line which connects to the √òstfold Line, bypassing Brynsbakken and Bryn Station. This has been named the Bryn Diagonal. Beyond determining that such a connection will not be tied to the new Follo Line, no decision has yet been made.

Later, during the Spanish reconquest, he changed sides and fought for independence against the royalist forces. Before the beginning of the war, Lanta√±o was simply a well-connected large estate owner of √ëuble Province. In 1814 Spanish Brigadier Gabino Ga√≠nza put him in command of one of his main guerrilla columns, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He participated in the Battle of El Roble, the Battle of Membrillar and the Disaster of Rancagua, among other military actions. But the capture in 1814 of the Carrera brothers, Jos√© Miguel and Luis, was what made him famous within the army. After the Battle of Maip√∫ in 1818, he continued fighting with the royalists on the south shore of the R√≠o B√≠o-B√≠o until he accompanied Colonel Juan Francisco S√°nchez in the exhausting retreat to Valdivia in 1819. From there he went on to Peru by sea in order to continue serving the royalist cause. In Peru he was welcomed by Viceroy Joaqu√≠n de la Pezuela. In 1821, before the arrival of the rebel forces of Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, the viceroy ordered him to prepare the defense of the Department of Ancash. Against the forces that he organized in Huaraz, the rebels sent troops from Supe under the command of Colonel Enrique Compino. The attackers surprised the city. Lanta√±o was taken prisoner and sent back to Chile. Bernardo O'Higgins, who knew him before the revolution (because both were powerful neighbors in the same province), offered to recognize his rank if he joined the patriot army. Lanta√±o, apparently convinced of the hopelessness of the royalist cause, accepted the offer. He was commissioned the same year to mediate with the royal governor of Chilo√©, Antonio de Quintanilla. Lanta√±o proposed in the name of the government of Santiago the incorporation of the archipelago of the recently created Chilean Republic, trying to convince Quintanilla of the inevitable defeat of Spanish arms in Chile. The mission, however, was unsuccessful, because Quintanilla did not accept Lanta√±o's view of the situation. Returning to the territory held by the rebels, he fought in the Guerra a muerte (War to the Death, or the final phase of the Chilean War of Independence), together with Captain Manuel Bulnes. In 1821 he negotiated the surrender of the royalist camp at Quilapalo. In 1823 he led a punitive expedition against the guerrillas of the Pincheira brothers in the mountains of √ëuble.

It was founded in 1921 by Nugent Monck. Early history and conversion The theatre was originally built as a Roman Catholic chapel in 1794. In the nineteenth century it had been used as a baking soda factory, a grocery warehouse, and as a hall for the Salvation Army. It was small, the main body of the building measuring only forty by forty-six feet. However, a vaulted ceiling gave it excellent acoustics; more importantly, it already had galleries on three sides. The building was quickly converted by the Guild of Norwich Players from a state of near-dereliction into an Elizabethan style playhouse. Nugent Monck, the founder of the Guild of Norwich Players used to say it was a half scale model of the Fortune Theatre, although later scholars have suggested that Blackfriars Theatre would be a more accurate comparison. Operation The Maddermarket Theatre opened in 1921 and was the first permanent recreation of an Elizabethan Theatre. The founder was Nugent Monck who had worked with William Poel. Poel was the first to restore Shakespeare's plays with the full text and to play them in the Elizabethan style without elaborate scenery. Monck founded the Norwich Players, an amateur dramatic society, in the early years of the Twentieth Century. They first performed in his house, then at the Music House in King Street. Their success led to him purchasing an eighteenth- century former Catholic chapel in St John Maddermarket in Norwich, which was converted into the Maddermarket Theatre in 1921. The conversion took six weeks to complete with actors rehearsing and then helping to decorate it. It was intended to build a thrust stage but the dimensions of the building and lack of funds resulted in an end-stage being constructed instead. The original form of the building was a rectangular space wide by long with a gallery running around three sides. The ceiling was in the form of a plaster barrel-vault which gave the building its remarkable acoustic properties. The stage occupied nearly half the space. A pillared canopy was constructed from which to hang the painted curtains, which Monck used to effect very rapid scene changes. There was a gallery to the rear of the stage and two entrance doors either side of the stage, the two downstage ones being under the side galleries. All of these features are still in place today, although often covered by modern sets. The first dressing rooms were on the side galleries but are now housed within the main body of the building. The gents' to the side of the stage above the green room and the ladies' behind the stage, backing onto Strangers' Hall museum which in turn backs onto the rear of the theatre. Over the years tip-up seats have replaced loose chairs. The pillars that supported the side galleries were removed in the 1950s and the curved gallery was re-built straight, to accommodate the new supporting girder. At that time the back wall of the stalls was removed and the auditorium extended back to allow the stalls to accommodate another four rows of seats. In the 1960s the Medieval buildings flanking the front of the theatre were demolished and a new foyer, bar, toilets, rehearsal room and box office were constructed in a very brutal \\"modern\\" style. The site was overgrown with madder plants, some of which were donated to Strangers Hall medieval gardens, who in turn gifted the Theatre its very own madder plant in 2007. Many of the Elizabethan details were covered over the years and the permanent half-timbered set was often covered-over with conventional scenic flats. When Dave Harris became Artistic Director, he asked if it were possible to re-construct the stage giving it the thrust as was intended by Monck in the 1920s. This not only involved adding-on an extra seven feet of stage in the form of a half hexagon but also rebuilding the gallery and re-arranging the seating in the front stalls. Despite pessimistic predictions of a great loss of seats only ten seats at the rear of the gallery have been lost. Removal of unnecessary gangways has allowed the stage to be greatly enlarged without any loss of stalls seats (in fact they gained an extra wheelchair position). The gallery has been reconstructed with a steeper rake and with the original curved tiers re-created. The 1930s cinema seats have been retained in all parts of the 'house'. The new total seating capacity is 310. All the new work was done to match the 1920s Tudor style of the rest of the original theatre, which is a Grade II 'listed' building. The opportunity was taken to replace the 1960s house-lights with lanterns in order to look more in keeping with the rest of the decor. New front of house lighting positions have been provided and new cable-runs have been concealed in the new floors. The Council's City Works Department built the stage and a seating contractor moved the seats. All other work was done in-house. All the work was done between productions and during a summer closure of approximately six weeks and the total cost was about ¬£10,000. During the autumn, the original permanent set was restored and was first used for a production of Bartholomew Fair, when one of the original Monck painted curtains was used again.

History When the prefecture plan for Saga was published in 1984, it was decided that Kashima City was never going to have a highway or a Shinkansen connection. Mr. Masahiko Kuwahara, the mayor of Kashima, was also the president of the junior chamber. He created a committee called \\"Forum Kashima\\" to improve the city's cultural calendar. As a result, the 1st Kashima Gatalympic event was held on May 3, 1985. As the Gatalympics became famous, the mudflats that had been neglected before were improved in condition and status. Under a new perspective, the mudflats became an important and valued symbol for the growth of the city as a whole. It was therefore natural that the mudflats became the central reason for which Kashima is now recognized for. The proposed name for this event translates as \\"The big athletic meet on the mudflats.\\" Though accurate, it was also a little dry. A second title was proposed: \\"The Gata-olympic big athletic meet on the mudflats\\". Finally, whilst heavily under the influence of alcohol, somebody could only utter as much as \\"Gatalympic\\" and from then on, that name has stuck like mud. The term \\"Gatalympics\\" is a play on the name of mudflats in Japanese, Kashima Higata (ÈπøÂ≥∂Âπ≤ÊΩü) and the Olympics.  Events  * The 2007 Event was on 27 May. The opening ceremony commenced at 10am, with events from 11am to 3pm. * The 2009 Gatalympics were held on 7 June. * The 30th Kashima Gatalympics took place on 25 May 2014. References * 1/2/3/4.

He has lived in New York since 1990. Life=Biography When he was 10 years old, Yun-Fei Ji's mother sent him to study with an officer who drew illustrations for the People's Liberation Army. In 1982, he received a B.F.A. from the China Central Academy of Fine Arts, Beijing, P.R. China. During that time, the instructors at the Central Academy of Fine Arts still painted in a Socialist-realist propaganda style. In 1989, he received a M.F.A. from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville in the Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences. Ji lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. He is represented by James Cohan Gallery. Travel Yun-Fei Ji took a trip to the ancient Silk Road area of northwest China. On this trip, he viewed Buddhist frescoes in the Mogao caves in Dunhuang, China. The narrative of the frescoes greatly influenced him and inspired him to create multiple works based on that expedition. Ji also visited Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina, and made drawings of this experience. He says this about the experience: :\\"I saw this natural disaster as an example of government failure. And after the financial collapse, I saw similarities- how the government failed to do its job as a watchdog. It's very disproportionate in both cases how the people who put in all the work paid the price, and the people who benefited from all the work paid no price.\\". Painting style Detail from The Village and its Ghosts by Yun-Fei Ji Yun-Fei paints traditionally, using the media ink and watercolor on rice paper and mulberry paper. In his painting process, he starts with multiple pencil drawings. When he wants to see something in color, he will paint it with ink or watercolor. His paintings generally include eerie looking characters. Ji grew up with ghost stories, and he uses these as inspiration. He said: :\\"I use ghost stories as metaphors because it's an easy way to satirize human problems and issues.\\". The ink and watercolor rendering at right demonstrates the artist's approach to imaginary creatures. The image is from the last section of a 60 foot long handscroll, The Village and its Ghosts, from 2014. His inspiration also includes historical, cultural, and political messages, such as memories from the time of Maoist rule. Ji has an interest in including household items in his works, such as machines, fabrics, and musical instruments. He is also interested in the literary aspect of art: :\\"I try to mimic the method that underlies the formation of early Chinese characters: I invent forms that are like words to describe the world.\\".

In 1964, while Chavarr√≠a was living in Brazil, there was a military coup and he fled to work amongst the gold seekers in the Amazon. Later on, he fled to Cuba.

Chavarr√≠a‚Äôs style of writing is within the Latin American tradition of political writers, such as Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez. He mentioned that as a child, he read Jules Verne, Emilio Salgari and Alexandre Dumas, and their influence can be detected in his writing. For example, in Tango for a Torturer, the influence of The Count of Monte Cristo is clear. Chavarr√≠a‚Äôs life and writings clearly show his communist and revolutionary background.

It was a single-seat, single-engine biplane of all-metal construction. Built by Fairey Aviation Company Limited, it served principally with the Belgian Air Force throughout the 1930s until the outbreak of World War II. Design and development The Firefly was a private-venture design, penned by Marcel Lobelle, as the Curtiss D-12 powered Firefly I had been rejected owing to its American engine and its wooden structure, and could not be easily fitted with the larger and heavier geared Rolls-Royce Falcon XI favoured by the RAF.Mason 1992, p. 212.Willis Aeroplane August 2020, p. 92. A completely new design, it shared little with the Firefly I beyond the name. Making use of experience gleaned from the earlier machine, it was developed in response to Specification F.20/27 for a single-seat interceptor. It first flew on 5 February 1929.Mason 1992, p. 212. The Firefly II competed for the RAF contract against the Hawker Fury, showing superior speed but was criticised for having heavier controls. Crucially, it retained a mainly wooden structure despite the Air Ministry's demands for metal structures. This led to the Fury being selected. Afterwards, the prototype was rebuilt and renamed Firefly IIM, the \\"M\\" denoting the all-metal construction of the rebuilt machine. A revised prototype with longer-span wings, the Firefly III was built to Specification N21/26 as a carrier-based fighter to replace the Fleet Air Arm's Fairey Flycatchers, first flying on 17 May 1929.Taylor 1988, pp. 175‚Äì176. Like the land-based fighter, it was rebuilt with more metal components as the Firefly IIIM, and again like the Firefly II, was beaten by a design produced by Hawker, in this case the Hawker Nimrod. Although no production orders ensued, the Firefly IIIM was fitted with floats and used as a trainer by the RAF's High Speed Flight preparing for the 1931 Schneider Trophy race.Mason 1992, p. 213. Operational history A contract was won for 25 IIM aircraft for Belgium's A√©ronautique Militaire, followed by a contract for a further 62 to be constructed by Avions Fairey, Fairey's Belgian subsidiary. The Belgian aircraft served briefly in the Second World War from May to June 1940. Two of the Belgian aircraft were converted to Firefly IV, with 785 hp (585 kW) Hispano-Suiza 12Xbrs engines but the improvement was not deemed sufficient to warrant development. One was restored to its original form, while the other passed to Fairey for trials. One aircraft was supplied to the Soviet Union.

She acted in many movies opposite Prem Nazir and have also worked in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu and Kannada films. Biography Her first appearance onscreen was in the Tamil film Chitthi (1966). Her first film in Malayalam was Poojapushpam (1969), directed by the patriarch Thikkurissy Sukumaran Nair. She ended up being a part of 3 of the 6 movies Thikkurissy directed in his prolific career as a director. She also got to share screen space with the leading lady of the times, Sheela in her debut movie itself. She gained popularity due to her beauty in the Malayalam film history. She was a contemporary of the popular Malayalam actress Jayabharathi. Her most notable films are Angathattu (1973), Postmane Kananilla (1972), Lanka Dahanam (1971), Maravil Thirivu Sookshikkuka (1972), Pacha Nottukal (1973), Taxi Car (1972), Aromalunni (1972) and Ponnapuram Kotta (1973). In all these films, she starred opposite Prem Nazir and the Prem Nazir-Vijayasree pair created biggest hits in box office. \\"Theirs was the most successful pair in Malayalam cinema ever, I cannot think of a single film of theirs flopping.\\" says R. Gopalakrishnan, one of the senior- most still photographers in Malayalam cinema. Many of her movies are directed by Kunchacko. At the end of her career, she parted ways with Kunchacko and joined with P. Subramaniam. She also acted in a number of Tamil films but in supporting roles. She had played an important role in Babu (1971), a Sivaji Ganesan starrer, as the pair of Sivaji who is killed early in the story. She had also acted opposite Gemini Ganesh in Chitthi, a hit. Other notable ones are Deivamagan (1970), Adhe Kangal (1967) and Kulavilakku (1968). Many celebrities praised the beauty of Vijayasree. \\"She is the most beautiful woman I have ever met\\", said director Bharathan to his associate, Jayaraj, once. \\"She was verily the Marilyn Monroe of Malayalam. No other actress had as many male admirers as she had. No other actress had as many hits as her in such a short span of time. No actress had made such a sudden impact in Malayalam cinema. People went to the theatre to see her, and that is something that has not happened before (her time)\\", said Jayaraj. He directed a film Naayika, by which the character in the movie named \\"Vani\\" (played by actress Sarayu) portrays slight resemblance to Vijayasree's life. \\"If Jayan epitomised the essence in manly beauty among male actors, then there has never been an actress in Malayalam whose voluptuous beauty compared to Vijayasree's. Her graceful statuesque beauty was almost a symbol of God's artistry\\", said actor Kaduvakulam Antony. Many actors and directors said, due to the bad fate, Malayalam film fans could not see the great Jayan-Vijayasree combination on the screen. \\"She was extremely beautiful of course, but she was a capable performer too.\\", said actor Raghavan.

Tower of Alfonso XI, part of the former City Walls, and belongs to Las Huelgas. The Abbey of Santa Mar√≠a la Real de Las Huelgas is a monastery of Cistercian nuns located approximately 1.5 km west of the city of Burgos in Spain. The word huelgas, which usually refers to \\"labour strikes\\" in modern Spanish, refers in this case to land which had been left fallow. Historically, the monastery has been the site of many weddings of royal families, both foreign and Spanish, including that of Edward I of England to Eleanor of Castile in 1254, for example. The defensive tower of the Abbey is also the birthplace of King Peter of Castile. History On 2 January 1187, Pope Clement III issued a papal bull authorising the founding of a monastery dedicated to the Virgin Mary. In June of the same year, Alfonso VIII of Castile, at the behest of his wife, Eleanor of England, daughter of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine granted the foundational charter stipulating that the monastery was to be governed by the Cistercian Order. Until the 16th century, it enjoyed many royal privileges granted to it by the king, including exemption from taxes, the lordship of many villages and territories (governed by the monastery's abbess), and the possession of many of the royal families' valued personal items, most of them religious. It is even claimed that, until the Council of Trent, the abbess was able to hear confession and give absolution, like a priest. In 1199, the founders formally delivered the monastery to the nuns and added a clause pursuant to which the monastery was to be the burial place of the royal family. Constance, the youngest daughter of Alfonso, joined the Cistercians there. She was the first known as the Lady of Las Huelgas. This position was held as well by other women from the royal family, including her niece Constance and her grand-niece Berengaria, and maintained the close connection between the community and their royal patrons. Queen Eleanor and Queen Berengaria were both documented as supporting and being involved with the abbey. While members of the royal family were secular leaders of the monastery, abbesses such as Sancha Garcia were spiritual authorities. Alfonso VIII, who was himself to be buried at Las Huelgas, along with his wife, Eleanor, created the affiliated Royal Hospital, with all its dependencies, subject to the Abbess. The hospital was founded to feed and care for the poor pilgrims along the Camino de Santiago. Donations made to sustain the hospital noted the key role that Eleanor played in its founding and maintenance, and she made many donations in honor of her deceased son Ferdinand. A community of lay brothers developed to help the nuns in their care of the hospital's patients, who became known as the Brothers Hospitallers of Burgos. There were never more than a dozen of them, but they formed an independent religious Order in 1474. The Brothers survived as an Order until 1587, when their Order was suppressed and they were again placed under the authority of the abbess.Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) \\"Benedictine\\" p. 464 The Abbess of the monastery was, by the favor of the king, invested with almost royal prerogatives, and exercised an unlimited secular authority over more than fifty villages. Like secular lords, she held her own courts, in civil and criminal cases, and, like bishops, she granted Dimissorial Letters for ordination, and issued licenses authorizing priests within the territory of her abbatial jurisdiction to hear confessions, to preach, and to engage in pastoral care. She was privileged also to confirm the Abbesses of other monasteries, to impose censures, and to convoke synods. At a General Chapter of the Cistercians held in 1189, she was made Abbess General of the Order for the Kingdom of Le√≥n and Castile, with the privilege of convoking annually a general chapter at Burgos. The Abbess of Las Huelgas retained her ancient prerogatives up to the time of the Council of Trent, in the 16th century. Currently, the monastic community, which at present numbers 36, is part of the Spanish Congregation of St. Bernard, a reform movement of Cistercian nuns, which arose during the 16th and 17th centuries. Due to this, they are also commonly referred to as \\"Bernadines\\". The nuns of this Congregation would follow a more exact observance of the Rule of St. Benedict than other Cistercian houses, with frequent and lengthy fasts, and celebrating the Divine Office about 2:00 A.M. The nuns support themselves through the decoration of porcelain items, making rosaries and providing laundry services for local hotels. This abbey has founded a daughter house in Peru, the Monastery of the Most Holy Trinity, which is located in the agricultural Lur√≠n District, on the outskirts of the Lima Metropolitan Area. The monastery has about ten professed nuns, and several candidates in various stages of formation. They support themselves by making cakes and jams, for which they use the produce of their own gardens.  Cultural heritage The monastery is open to the public. Visits are administered not by the monastic community, but by the Spanish heritage organisation Patrimonio Nacional, which maintains the property as a Spanish royal site.  Textiles  The monastery houses the Museo de Ricas Telas, a showcase of medieval textiles taken from the many royal tombs in the convent. Also on display is the tapestry that covered the tent of the Almohad caliph Al Nasir, known to the Christians as Miramamolin. This tapestry was seized by the victorious Christians at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa on July 16, 1212. When Sancho VII of Navarre's men drove through an enchained circle of African slaves guarding Miramamolin's tent, the caliph fled with great haste, leaving this tapestry along with several other prizes of war behind for the exultant Spanish. One of the many royal tombs at Las Huelgas  Musical heritage  Las Huelgas preserves a 14th-century music manuscript, the Codex Las Huelgas. It contains monophonic and polyphonic music which is assumed to have been performed by the nuns. Some of the music is not found in any other source.

He proposed the name of this new species at a meeting of the British Association in 1863, with the written version published in 1864.King, W. B. R. (1864). The reputed fossil man of the Neanderthal. Quarterly Journal of Science, 1, 88‚Äì97. Life King was born to William King, a coal worker, and his wife Eleanor n√©e Armstrong who was a confectioner and shop owner. He grew up in Durham and went to study in Sunderland and apprenticed at various times with an ironmonger, book-seller and a librarian. He took an early interest in collecting fossils. He worked at the Newcastle museum in 1841 but left it after six years after conflict with the employers. In 1849 he joined Queen's College Galway and during his long career there published nearly 70 papers and established a museum. He developed a course in geology for the arts, agriculture, and engineering faculties and served as an examiner in geology for the University. His research included topics such as the structure of the brachiopod shell, rock cleavage and the uplift of the Burren. His most famous work was The reputed fossil man of the Neanderthal published in 1864. In this he noted the differences in the curved ribs, the skull muscle attachment suggesting carnivory and suggested that the Neanderthal was a species different from modern humans. He supported a modified version of Darwin's Origin of Species but he gave considerable emphasis to place the Neanderthal as being close and on a \\"lower scale\\" than Andaman and Australian aborigines and suggested that like them, the Neanderthal was \\"incapable of moral and theoistic conception\\". His speculation on their theological beliefs did not go without critical comment from contemporaries like Charles Carter Blake. King married Jane Nicholson in 1839 and one of their sons, William King Jr. worked in the Geological Survey of India, and became its director. King was a fellow of the Geological Society of France and was awarded an honorary D.Sc. by Queen's University in 1870. King resigned in 1883 following a stroke but stayed as an emeritus professor. He died at Glenoir, Galway on 24 June 1886. King's grandson, another William King (1910-2012), was a globe- circumnavigating yachtsman and a Royal Navy officer in World War II.

The society was founded in 1910 by Ananda Coomaraswamy, and others, as the India Society. Sedgwick reports Coomaraswamy's stimulus as follows: :In 1910 he became involved in a very public controversy, played out in the correspondence columns of The Times and elsewhere, on the status of Indian art. This had started when Sir George Birdwood, while chairing the Indian Section of the annual meeting of the Royal Society of Arts, had announced that there was no ‚Äúfine art‚Äù in India and had somewhat unwisely responded to the suggestion that a particular statue of the Buddha was an example of fine art: ‚ÄúThis senseless similitude, in its immemorial fixed pose, is nothing more than an uninspired brazen image. . . . A boiled suet pudding would serve equally well as a symbol of passionless purity and serenity of soul.‚Äù This controversy culminated in the foundation of the India Society, later the Royal India Society, to combat the views of the Birdwoods of this world. Coomaraswamy played a major part in this endeavor. In 1944 the Society was granted permission to become The Royal India Society under the patronage of the Dowager Queen Mary of Teck. After partition, its name was again changed to the Royal India and Pakistan Society, and then again to the Royal India, Pakistan, and Ceylon Society. In 1966 it merged with the East India Association.  References  * Review of Coomaraswamy by Roger Lipsey; reviewed by K. R.

They are indexed by pairs of elements y, w of a Coxeter group W, which can in particular be the Weyl group of a Lie group.  Motivation and history In the spring of 1978 Kazhdan and Lusztig were studying Springer representations of the Weyl group of an algebraic group on \\\\ell-adic cohomology groups related to unipotent conjugacy classes. They found a new construction of these representations over the complex numbers . The representation had two natural bases, and the transition matrix between these two bases is essentially given by the Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials. The actual Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig construction of their polynomials is more elementary. Kazhdan and Lusztig used this to construct a canonical basis in the Hecke algebra of the Coxeter group and its representations. In their first paper Kazhdan and Lusztig mentioned that their polynomials were related to the failure of local Poincar√© duality for Schubert varieties. In they reinterpreted this in terms of the intersection cohomology of Mark Goresky and Robert MacPherson, and gave another definition of such a basis in terms of the dimensions of certain intersection cohomology groups. The two bases for the Springer representation reminded Kazhdan and Lusztig of the two bases for the Grothendieck group of certain infinite dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebras, given by Verma modules and simple modules. This analogy, and the work of Jens Carsten Jantzen and Anthony Joseph relating primitive ideals of enveloping algebras to representations of Weyl groups, led to the Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig conjectures.  Definition  Fix a Coxeter group W with generating set S, and write \\\\ell(w) for the length of an element w (the smallest length of an expression for w as a product of elements of S). The Hecke algebra of W has a basis of elements T_w for w\\\\in W over the ring \\\\mathbb{Z}[q^{1/2}, q^{-1/2}], with multiplication defined by :\\\\begin{align} T_y T_w &= T_{yw}, && \\\\mbox{if }\\\\ell(yw) = \\\\ell(y) + \\\\ell(w) \\\\ (T_s + 1)(T_s - q) &= 0, && \\\\mbox{if }s \\\\in S. \\\\end{align} The quadratic second relation implies that each generator is invertible in the Hecke algebra, with inverse . These inverses satisfy the relation (obtained by multiplying the quadratic relation for by ‚àí2q‚àí1), and also the braid relations. From this it follows that the Hecke algebra has an automorphism D that sends q1/2 to q‚àí1/2 and each to Ts‚àí1. More generally one has D(T_w)=T_{w^{-1}}^{-1}; also D can be seen to be an involution. The Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials Pyw(q) are indexed by a pair of elements y, w of W, and uniquely determined by the following properties. *They are 0 unless y ‚â§ w (in the Bruhat order of W), 1 if y = w, and for y < w their degree is at most (‚Ñì(w) ‚àí ‚Ñì(y) ‚àí 1)/2. *The elements ::C'_w=q^{-\\\\frac{\\\\ell(w)}{2}}\\\\sum_{y\\\\le w} P_{y,w}T_y :are invariant under the involution D of the Hecke algebra. The elements C'_w form a basis of the Hecke algebra as a -module, called the Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig basis. To establish existence of the Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials, Kazhdan and Lusztig gave a simple recursive procedure for computing the polynomials Pyw(q) in terms of more elementary polynomials denoted Ryw(q). defined by :T_{y^{-1}}^{-1} = \\\\sum_xD(R_{x,y})q^{-\\\\ell(x)}T_x. They can be computed using the recursion relations :R_{x,y} = \\\\begin{cases} 0, & \\\\mbox{if } x ot\\\\le y \\\\ 1, & \\\\mbox{if } x = y \\\\ R_{sx,sy}, & \\\\mbox{if } sx < x \\\\mbox{ and } sy < y \\\\ R_{xs,ys}, & \\\\mbox{if } xs < x \\\\mbox{ and } ys < y \\\\ (q-1)R_{sx,y} + qR_{sx,sy}, & \\\\mbox{if } sx > x \\\\mbox{ and } sy < y \\\\end{cases} The Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials can then be computed recursively using the relation :q^{\\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\ell(w)-\\\\ell(x))}D(P_{x,w}) - q^{\\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\ell(x)-\\\\ell(w))}P_{x,w} = \\\\sum_{x using the fact that the two terms on the left are polynomials in q1/2 and q‚àí1/2 without constant terms. These formulas are tiresome to use by hand for rank greater than about 3, but are well adapted for computers, and the only limit on computing Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials with them is that for large rank the number of such polynomials exceeds the storage capacity of computers. Examples *If y ‚â§ w then Py,w has constant term 1. *If y ‚â§ w and then Py,w = 1. *If w = w0 is the longest element of a finite Coxeter group then Py,w = 1 for all y. *If W is the Coxeter group A1 or A2 (or more generally any Coxeter group of rank at most 2) then Py,w is 1 if y‚â§w and 0 otherwise. *If W is the Coxeter group A3 with generating set S = {a, b, c} with a and c commuting then Pb,bacb = 1 + q and Pac,acbca = 1 + q, giving examples of non-constant polynomials. *The simple values of Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials for low rank groups are not typical of higher rank groups. For example, for the split form of E8 the most complicated Lusztig‚ÄìVogan polynomial (a variation of Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials: see below) is ::\\\\begin{align} 152 q^{22} &\\\\+ 3,472 q^{21} + 38,791 q^{20} + 293,021 q^{19} + 1,370,892 q^{18} + 4,067,059 q^{17} + 7,964,012 q^{16}\\\\ &\\\\+ 11,159,003 q^{15} + 11,808,808 q^{14} + 9,859,915 q^{13} + 6,778,956 q^{12} + 3,964,369 q^{11} + 2,015,441 q^{10}\\\\ &\\\\+ 906,567 q^9 + 363,611 q^8 + 129,820 q^7 + 41,239 q^6 + 11,426 q^5 + 2,677 q^4 + 492 q^3 + 61 q^2 + 3 q \\\\end{align} * showed that any polynomial with constant term 1 and non-negative integer coefficients is the Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomial for some pair of elements of some symmetric group. Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig conjectures The Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials arise as transition coefficients between their canonical basis and the natural basis of the Hecke algebra. The Inventiones paper also put forth two equivalent conjectures, known now as Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig conjectures, which related the values of their polynomials at 1 with representations of complex semisimple Lie groups and Lie algebras, addressing a long-standing problem in representation theory. Let W be a finite Weyl group. For each w ‚àà W denote by be the Verma module of highest weight where œÅ is the half-sum of positive roots (or Weyl vector), and let be its irreducible quotient, the simple highest weight module of highest weight . Both and are locally-finite weight modules over the complex semisimple Lie algebra g with the Weyl group W, and therefore admit an algebraic character. Let us write ch(X) for the character of a g-module X. The Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig conjectures state: : \\\\operatorname{ch}(L_w)=\\\\sum_{y\\\\le w}(-1)^{\\\\ell(w)-\\\\ell(y)}P_{y,w}(1)\\\\operatorname{ch}(M_y) : \\\\operatorname{ch}(M_w)=\\\\sum_{y\\\\le w}P_{w_0w,w_0y}(1)\\\\operatorname{ch}(L_y) where is the element of maximal length of the Weyl group. These conjectures were proved over characteristic 0 algebraically closed fields independently by and by . The methods introduced in the course of the proof have guided development of representation theory throughout the 1980s and 1990s, under the name geometric representation theory.  Remarks  1\\\\. The two conjectures are known to be equivalent. Moreover, Borho‚ÄìJantzen's translation principle implies that can be replaced by for any dominant integral weight . Thus, the Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig conjectures describe the Jordan‚ÄìH√∂lder multiplicities of Verma modules in any regular integral block of Bernstein‚ÄìGelfand‚ÄìGelfand category O. 2\\\\. A similar interpretation of all coefficients of Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials follows from the Jantzen conjecture, which roughly says that individual coefficients of are multiplicities of in certain subquotient of the Verma module determined by a canonical filtration, the Jantzen filtration. The Jantzen conjecture in regular integral case was proved in a later paper of . 3\\\\. David Vogan showed as a consequence of the conjectures that :P_{y,w}(q) = \\\\sum_{i} q^i \\\\dim(\\\\operatorname{Ext}^{\\\\ell(w)-\\\\ell(y)-2i}(M_y,L_w)) and that vanishes if is odd, so the dimensions of all such Ext groups in category O are determined in terms of coefficients of Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials. This result demonstrates that all coefficients of the Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials of a finite Weyl group are non-negative integers. However, positivity for the case of a finite Weyl group W was already known from the interpretation of coefficients of the Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials as the dimensions of intersection cohomology groups, irrespective of the conjectures. Conversely, the relation between Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials and the Ext groups theoretically can be used to prove the conjectures, although this approach to proving them turned out to be more difficult to carry out. 4\\\\. Some special cases of the Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig conjectures are easy to verify. For example, M1 is the antidominant Verma module, which is known to be simple. This means that M1 = L1, establishing the second conjecture for w = 1, since the sum reduces to a single term. On the other hand, the first conjecture for w = w0 follows from the Weyl character formula and the formula for the character of a Verma module, together with the fact that all Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials P_{y,w_0} are equal to 1. 5\\\\. Kashiwara (1990) proved a generalization of the Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig conjectures to symmetrizable Kac‚ÄìMoody algebras. Relation to intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties By the Bruhat decomposition the space G/B of the algebraic group G with Weyl group W is a disjoint union of affine spaces Xw parameterized by elements w of W. The closures of these spaces are called Schubert varieties, and Kazhdan and Lusztig, following a suggestion of Deligne, showed how to express Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials in terms of intersection cohomology groups of Schubert varieties. More precisely, the Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomial Py,w(q) is equal to :P_{y,w}(q) = \\\\sum_iq^i\\\\dim IH^{2i}_{X_y}(\\\\overline{X_w}) where each term on the right means: take the complex IC of sheaves whose hyperhomology is the intersection homology of the Schubert variety of w (the closure of the cell ), take its cohomology of degree , and then take the dimension of the stalk of this sheaf at any point of the cell whose closure is the Schubert variety of y. The odd-dimensional cohomology groups do not appear in the sum because they are all zero. This gave the first proof that all coefficients of Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials for finite Weyl groups are non-negative integers.  Generalization to real groups  Lusztig‚ÄìVogan polynomials (also called Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials or Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig‚ÄìVogan polynomials) were introduced in . They are analogous to Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials, but are tailored to representations of real semisimple Lie groups, and play major role in the conjectural description of their unitary duals. Their definition is more complicated, reflecting relative complexity of representations of real groups compared to complex groups. The distinction, in the cases directly connection to representation theory, is explained on the level of double cosets; or in other terms of actions on analogues of complex flag manifolds G/B where G is a complex Lie group and B a Borel subgroup. The original (K-L) case is then about the details of decomposing :B\\\\backslash G/ B, a classical theme of the Bruhat decomposition, and before that of Schubert cells in a Grassmannian. The L-V case takes a real form of G, a maximal compact subgroup in that semisimple group , and makes the complexification K of . Then the relevant object of study is :K\\\\backslash G/ B. In March 2007, it was announced that the L‚ÄìV polynomials had been calculated for the split form of E8.  Generalization to other objects in representation theory  The second paper of Kazhdan and Lusztig established a geometric setting for definition of Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials, namely, the geometry of singularities of Schubert varieties in the flag variety. Much of the later work of Lusztig explored analogues of Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials in the context of other natural singular algebraic varieties arising in representation theory, in particular, closures of nilpotent orbits and quiver varieties. It turned out that the representation theory of quantum groups, modular Lie algebras and affine Hecke algebras are all tightly controlled by appropriate analogues of Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials. They admit an elementary description, but the deeper properties of these polynomials necessary for representation theory follow from sophisticated techniques of modern algebraic geometry and homological algebra, such as the use of intersection cohomology, perverse sheaves and Beilinson‚ÄìBernstein‚ÄìDeligne decomposition. The coefficients of the Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials are conjectured to be the dimensions of some homomorphism spaces in Soergel's bimodule category. This is the only known positive interpretation of these coefficients for arbitrary Coxeter groups.  Combinatorial theory  Combinatorial properties of Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials and their generalizations are a topic of active current research. Given their significance in representation theory and algebraic geometry, attempts have been undertaken to develop the theory of Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials in purely combinatorial fashion, relying to some extent on geometry, but without reference to intersection cohomology and other advanced techniques. This has led to exciting developments in algebraic combinatorics, such as pattern-avoidance phenomenon. Some references are given in the textbook of . A research monograph on the subject is . , there is no known combinatorial interpretation of all the coefficients of the Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials (as the cardinalities of some natural sets) even for the symmetric groups, though explicit formulas exist in many special cases.

Estimation of the number of slides is difficult because individual scarps conjoin. The total has been reported as high as 16,000, though it is unclear how this figure was arrived at.

As of February 2, 2001, more than 2,500 aftershocks had hit El Salvador, leading to additional damage and terrorizing the inhabitants. Clean water and sanitation became a matter of grave concern in many areas due to the earthquake's destruction of some $7 million to municipal drinking water systems, and tens of thousands of people were living outdoors in spite of the approaching rainy season (Invierno). Government and public health organizations warned of the possible spread of disease as desperate people began to scavenge debris piles -- some containing severed human limbs -- looking for items they could pawn to purchase needed food and other commodities.CNN. \\"Poor sanitation fuels disease fears in aftermath of Salvador quake,\\" CNN.com, January 20, 2001. Tectonic setting El Salvador lies above the convergent boundary where oceanic crust of the Cocos Plate is being subducted beneath the Caribbean Plate at rate of about 72 mm per year along the Middle America Trench. This boundary is associated with earthquakes resulting from movement on the plate interface itself, such as the 7.7 1992 Nicaragua earthquake, and from faulting within both the overriding Caribbean Plate and the subducting Cocos Plate, such as the 1982 El Salvador earthquake.  Earthquake  The January 13 earthquake was a result of normal faulting within the subducting Cocos Plate as shown by the hypocentral depth and published focal mechanisms. Of the two possible fault planes indicated, analysis of observed seismic waves supports the solution with a fault plane dipping moderately to the northeast. It was followed by a series of aftershocks, including 70 greater than M 4 of which 10 were greater than M 5 in the period up to February 2, 2020. The largest aftershock was an M 5.8 event at 12:20 on January 15. Exactly one month after the mainshock there was another destructive earthquake, which occurred on an entirely different fault within the overriding Caribbean Plate, leading to a further 315 deaths.  Post-quake analysis  In the days and weeks following the earthquakes, Salvadoran and foreign agencies analysed the factors that had facilitated the destruction the disasters had caused. While Salvadoran government representatives were quick to point out that the destruction had been far less than that of the 1986 earthquakes,Ambassador Rene Leon, interviewed by Ray Suarez. \\"Salvadoran Earthquake,\\" OnlineNewsHour, January 15, 2001. outside researchers critiqued shortcomings in preparedness and in policies toward land development that had permitted massive deforestation in the Santa Tecla area. Mexican seismologists invited by the Salvadoran government summarized their observations this way: The government's response to the earthquakes was critiqued from different sides, with some criticizing the legislature for not approving the full amount of emergency funding urged by President Flores, and others condemning what they saw as the ARENA government's contributions to the devastation. The Nicaragua-based magazine Env√≠o argued that the conservative government's pro-business stance had fostered aggressive levels of land development, coupled with high poverty rates that forced poor rural residents to make do with inadequate but cheap building materials, asserting: \\"Totaling up these factors makes it clear that the consequences of a natural phenomenon like an earthquake cannot be described as 'natural' ... Describing the January 13 earthquake as a 'natural disaster' is not only irresponsible, but also a declaration of future impotence. It assumes fatalistic acceptance that no natural phenomena can be prevented and that all one can do is respond to emergencies as they arise and try to rehabilitate and reconstruct what has been destroyed.\\" The magazine further critiqued the government's optimism about economic recovery in the aftermath of the first quake as an \\"insulting\\" minimization of the tragedy caused across the country and as an attempt to shore up the dollarization campaign that had been the focus of political attention up until the quakes.Ismael Moreno. \\"Dollarization and the Earthquake: Two Manmade Disasters,\\" Revista Env√≠o, January 2001.

In 2005, a manga sequel began serialization in the manga magazine Ultra Jump as Dogs: Bullets & Carnage, continuing the storyline. The Dogs: Prelude manga volume has been adapted into a two-volume original video animation series (OVA) by David Production in 2009. Premise Dogs is set in a dystopic European city where violence, crime, genetic manipulation and other scientific brutalities have become common.

A second drama CD was released on October 23, 2010, adapting the first volume of Dogs: Bullets & Carnage. Anime On November 19, 2008, an OVA adaptation of Dogs: Stray Dogs Howling in the Dark was announced in Ultra Jump. The two-volume OVA series was produced by David Production and featured the same voice cast as the drama CD. The first DVD volume, released on May 19, 2009 with the fourth volume of Dogs: Bullets & Carnage, featured adaptations of the first two chapters, \\"Weepy Old Killer\\" and \\"Gun Smoker\\". The second DVD volume, featuring \\"Blade Maiden\\" and \\"Stray Dogs Howling in the Dark\\", was initially released on May 29, 2009, for a limited time and later released on July 17, 2009 along with a limited edition reissue of the first Dogs manga which included new story material. Reception Carlo Santos of Anime News Network stated that Shirow Miwa raised \\"gunplay to the level of art\\" and that the loosely connected characters \\"provide the backdrop for mouth-watering eye candy\\". He also states that the \\"bent-perspective and striking layouts\\" will dazzle the reader \\"with split-second bullet-time acrobats\\". The most striking aspect is how the sparse backgrounds and lack of special effects make each scene more effective because the critical moments have a \\"frozen in time\\" quality more effective than a comic book's attempt to capture motion in a still frame. Santos also credits Miwa's ability to \\"craft a manga storyline about an old man who's the very opposite of a spunky teenage protagonist\\". However, Santos believes it is another \\"pompous, preening '_____ with guns' series\\" and that it is hard to find any substance of artistry when the Miwa is \\"cycling through all the usual tough-guy tropes\\". The characters fall into clich√©s and the entire series is \\"clich√© city\\". He believes that the stories are too loosely connected. Even though the characters encounter each other eventually, it is \\"not the same thing as actually kicking off a storyline together\\". Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin stated the volume is \\"a stylishly violent crime thriller in the vein of Asian film-influenced movies like Pulp Fiction and The Matrix\\" and that Miwa's art reflects the elegance such a manga needs. He thought that the characters dress well and that most of characters \\"sport top of the line hair styles\\". The series is not empty either. Douresseaux called the series \\"visually sharp\\" and said that it bears some weight behind each swing. He believes that Garth Ennis fans and fans of violent anime will like the series. Manga Recon's Ken Haley stated that although all four stories in the volume were enjoyable and entertaining, the fourth story involving Heine \\"feels cut off and adrift from the other three\\" because it incorporated science fiction elements the other three did not hint at. He felt that Miwa's artwork is engaging and the characters designs are interesting and \\"contemporary with a vague hint of industrial/goth at times\\". Miwa's use of heavy blacks and stark whites reminded Haley of Shou Tajima, illustrator of Multiple Personality Detective Psycho, although there is no further similarity. He says that Miwa's style is dynamic and the action sequences are \\"fast-paced and kinetic\\" because of liberal use of extreme depth cues, an artistic technique which exaggerates the sense of distance. However, the technique does seem a bit overused as it is used in every action sequence, causing it to lose impact. Haley does entertain the idea Miwa used the technique in a satirical manner and, if so, \\"it worked\\". He praises the lack of backgrounds as they give the stories a \\"universal feeling\\" and allows them to be set in any modern-day city. However, the lack of backgrounds means that important setting information needs to be expressed through dialogue. Despite this, Haley is curious to see what will happen next and how the plots will connect to one another.

Biography The brother of Thomas Peter Lee, was born in Petroleum, West Virginia on January 31, 1867. At a very early age, he began working in the oil fields and spent six years with the U. S. Oil Company in West Virginia, before moving to Ohio and then following his brother to Saratoga, Texas in 1904. He married Margaret McGuigan, a native of Parkersburg, on September 8, 1907, and the couple had six children: William Howard, Irene May, Thomas Peter, Faustine Ellen, and the twins, Donald and Ronald. After working for ten years with the Producers Oil Company, Bill Lee resigned and joined the Texas Company (Texaco), which assigned him to the Sour Lake production division. When T. P. Lee left the Texas Company and vacated the position of general superintendent of production, Bill thought that he might be promoted to that spot, but another got the job. Though thoroughly sickened when things did not work out as planned, he stayed with the company only at the insistence of his brother. Meanwhile, he still sought another area of employment, until finally, he got his wish. With the formation of the Yount-Lee Oil Company, T. P. Lee gave him a block of stock in the new venture, and this afforded him the opportunity to break away from the oil business. Subsequently, he organized and became president of the Citizens National Bank of Sour Lake, Texas which became one of the most prominent financial institutions in Hardin County. Bill Lee's grandson, T. P. \\"Tommy\\" Lee, III, described his grandfather as a large man weighing about three hundred pounds and with a height of about five feet, eleven inches. He was very affectionate toward all family members, but he was closer to T. P. Lee than all the rest. Portrayed as a \\"man of extreme wealth with country ways,\\" Bill Lee maintained a vegetable garden, kept various farm animals at his stately Houston home on Montrose Boulevard, and enjoyed spoiling all of his children and grandchildren. After moving from Sour Lake to Houston, Lee devoted himself to investments. He became a distinguished financier, a member of the River Oaks Country Club, Houston Club, Yacht Club, Mount Olive Lodge No. 3, A. F. and A. M. of Parkersburg, West Virginia, and the Shrine and Knights Templar. Bill Lee lived to be sixty-nine years old, and at the time of his death on October 28, 1936, brought on by bronchial pneumonia, he made his residence at 4218 Montrose Boulevard in Houston. Like his brother, T. P. Lee, Bill is buried at Houston's Glenwood Cemetery. Legacy One of Bill's daughters, Faustine, married Glenn Herbert McCarthy, popularly known as \\"Diamond Glenn\\", a legendary wildcatter who built the world-famous Shamrock Hotel in Houston. Purportedly, McCarthy, a close friend of Howard Hughes, inspired the character of Jett Rink found in Edna Ferber's best-selling novel Giant. Another of Bill Lee's children, William Howard, married into Hollywood royalty not once but twice: first to actress Hedy Lamarr from December 1953 until the couple divorced in 1960; and then to Gene Tierney in 1960.

Cast The show was hosted by Pat Sajak, best known as host of the game show Wheel of Fortune. In order to do the talk show, Sajak left the NBC daytime version of Wheel, but remained the host of the syndicated nighttime version he is still hosting as of 2020. Sajak's announcer and sidekick on the show was Dan Miller, his friend and former colleague from their time working together in the mid-1970s at WSM-TV (now WSMV-TV) in Nashville, Tennessee. The in-studio band was led by jazz musician Tom Scott, who subsequently served the same role on the short-lived Chevy Chase Show. History=Pre-production Sajak was hired by Michael Brockman, the CBS vice-president for daytime, children's and late-night programming, who wanted to have a late-night talk show established when Johnny Carson eventually announced his retirement from NBC's The Tonight Show. Brockman had known Sajak since the two worked for NBC in the late 1970s. At that time, Brockman had approached Sajak, a weatherman, about doing a game show, but Sajak rejected the idea, saying what he really wanted to do was get a talk show. Brockman kept him in mind over the years, and at a lunch in 1986 he reminded Sajak about the conversation. Sajak confirmed his interest in a talk show, and Brockman went to work getting approvals from his management for the plan and getting network affiliates to commit to the show. CBS spent more than $4 million for a new sound stage for the show at its Television City studios located above the four studios on the first floor. A staff of more than 30 was hired, and Sajak signed a guaranteed two-year contract for what was reportedly $60,000 a week. In an interview held a month before the show premiered, Sajak said he was \\"not looking to raise the level of TV\\"; he summarized the elements planned for the show, a plan that \\"steal[s] liberally\\" from talk shows past and present. =Premiere= Chevy Chase was the show's first guest; his interview was followed by one with Joan Van Ark, a performance by and brief interview with The Judds, an interview with the outgoing commissioner of baseball, Peter Ueberroth (interrupted briefly when Chase, who followed late-night talk show conventions of the time and remained seated on stage during the show's other guest appearances, raised his hand and asked if he could go to the bathroom). There was an interview (with Michael Gross), and then the show ended with a performance by stand-up comic Dennis Wolfberg. =Format= The show's set was similar to that of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Its format emulated Carson's model, featuring a monologue, comedy bits, interviews with celebrities, and performances by musicians and comedians. The Pat Sajak Show began as a 90-minute talk show, but was reduced to 60 minutes in October 1989. CBS executives said the show was shortened because the late-night talk show format was better suited for a 60-minute time slot. Rush Limbaugh Two weeks before The Pat Sajak Show was canceled, on March 30, 1990, radio host Rush Limbaugh made headlines when he guest hosted the program, and, in a departure from its regular format, entered the audience to get a response about the veto of a bill in Idaho that would have restricted abortion. Directly after announcing that the bill was vetoed, Limbaugh went to the first woman who stood up and was cheering the loudest. The woman denounced Limbaugh's anti-abortion statements earlier in the show, stating \\"women's lives are more important than any potato\\" and \\"You don't know what it's about. You'll never have a baby, you'll never be pregnant. You'll never have an abortion.\\" After a verbal confrontation with the angry woman in the audience, followed by an angry man shouting, \\"We are gonna be wherever you are and we're gonna denounce and expose you,\\" Limbaugh addressed the camera and stated that he went into the audience in an attempt to show the viewing public that there was an underlying prejudice against him. Due to heckling, Limbaugh decided to conduct his interview with Sydney Biddle Barrows in another studio. After a commercial break, Limbaugh attempted to address the topic of affirmative action, but was heckled again by several male audience members wearing ACT UP T-shirts, calling him a \\"murderer\\" before he could make a point. Limbaugh sat silently with the camera focused on him for nearly a minute while audience members continued shouting phrases such as \\"You want people to die!\\" Limbaugh responded with, \\"I am not responsible for your behavior.\\" After another break, Limbaugh returned and conducted the final segment after the audience had been cleared. He stated that the audience was not \\"evicted from the studio\\" or \\"forcibly restrained from doing anything they did\\" and gave CBS credit for handling the situation in the manner it did.The Pat Sajak Show, March 30, 1990 Limbaugh later claimed that the dissident audience members were planted by the show's producers as a publicity stunt.May 3, 2001 Transcript of Larry King Live guest host Pat Sajak interviewing Rush Limbaugh Cancellation During its final weeks, Sajak worked four days per week, with a guest host on Fridays. More than a decade later, Sajak (serving as guest host of Larry King Live) interviewed Limbaugh and facetiously said the show \\"was going so well that they actually auditioned replacements for me on the air.\\" Limbaugh all but confirmed the suspicion. On April 9, 1990, CBS announced the cancellation due to low ratings, which were generally half the level of Carson's, and were further diminished by The Arsenio Hall Show, which had been launched in syndication the same month as Sajak's show. Some affiliates delayed the show or never carried the program at all, choosing to air sitcom reruns or syndicated shows; there were even some that actually carried Arsenio instead. The final show aired on April 13, 1990. Because it was a Friday, Sajak did not appear, and comedian Paul Rodr√≠guez hosted in his place. CBS restored its CBS Late Night block of movies and reruns, which The Pat Sajak Show replaced earlier, and would not program another late-night talk show until the Late Show with David Letterman debuted in August 1993. That show proved far more successful, with Letterman hosting until May 2015 and Stephen Colbert taking over the show in September of the same year. Legacy Studio 56 at CBS Television City, where The Pat Sajak Show was taped, would later host numerous other talk shows, including The Dennis Miller Show, Politically Incorrect, The Tyra Banks Show, The Wanda Sykes Show and Rove LA. In September 2012, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson moved into Studio 56, returning a CBS late night talk show to that location over 22 years after The Pat Sajak Show was cancelled. As a tribute, Ferguson installed an autographed publicity photo of Sajak from The Pat Sajak Show era on the Late Late Show set's faux-mantelpiece, alongside those of Letterman and previous Late Late Show hosts Tom Snyder and Craig Kilborn. James Corden took over The Late Late Show in 2015, which remains in Studio 56 with a completely redesigned set. Rush Limbaugh would begin a run in syndicated television in 1992, following a similar format to the one he used guest-hosting The Pat Sajak Show. The show aired from 1992 to 1996. Somewhat ironically, Sajak's first guest Chevy Chase went on to host his own late night talk show on Fox in 1993, which proved even less successful than Sajak's own show.

Background A big, gangly horse standing just under seventeen hands, Pleasant Colony was a grandson of Ribot. He was bred by Wall Street financier Thomas Mellon Evans and raced under his Buckland Farm banner. Early racing career At age two, Pleasant Colony won two of his five starts including the Remsen Stakes. At age three, in the spring of 1981 he was second in the Fountain of Youth Stakes. Pleasant Colony lost 3 of 4 races to Akureyri. He lost the Fountain of Youth Stakes and the Pilgrim Stakes besides finishing behind Akureyri in the Florida Derby. He also was defeated by Akureyri in the Remsen Stakes but was placed first through disqualification. After Pleasant Colony's fifth-place finish in March's Florida Derby, his owner dismissed his trainer and replaced him with John P. Campo. Ridden by jockey Jeffrey Fell, Pleasant Colony then won April's Wood Memorial Stakes by three lengths. Triple Crown races In the 1981 Kentucky Derby under regular jockey Jorge Vel√°squez, Pleasant Colony held off a powerful stretch drive by Woodchopper to win by three-quarters of a length. The expected rivalry with Woodchopper never materialized in the Preakness Stakes. Pleasant Colony came from behind to win by a length over Arkansas Derby winner Bold Ego with Woodchopper far back in eleventh place. In the third and final leg of the Triple Crown series, the Belmont Stakes, Pleasant Colony finished third to winner Summing. Later racing career Pleasant Colony won the Grade I Woodward Stakes. After a fourth in the Marlboro Cup Invitational Handicap, he was retired to stud duty at Buckland Farm. At year's end, he was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding 3-Year-Old Male Horse. As a sire From 1982 at age 4, until 1998 at age 20, Pleasant Colony stood at Thomas Mellon Evans's Buckland Farm annex outside Lexington, Kentucky on Paris Pike near the Fayette County and Bourbon County line. He became a very significant sire, producing seventy-three stakes race winners including more than a dozen Grade I winners and the following champions: * Pleasant Stage ‚Äì 1991 Eclipse Award for Outstanding 2-Year-Old Filly and winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies * Pleasant Tap ‚Äì 1992 Eclipse Award for Outstanding Older Male Horse * St Jovite ‚Äì European champion won the 1992 Irish Derby, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes * Pleasantly Perfect ‚Äì Won the 2003 Breeders' Cup Classic and 2004 Dubai World Cup * Colonial Colony ‚Äì Won the 2004 Grade 1 Stephen Foster Handicap Pleasant Colony's daughters have produced a number of Grade 1 stakes race winners. He is the damsire of Forestry, sire of The Green Monkey sold at the February 2006 Fasig-Tipton Florida auction for a world record price of $16-million. The Green Monkey had almost no success at the racetrack and is now standing at stud. Following his owner's death in 1997, Pleasant Colony was sent to Blue Ridge Farm in Upperville, Virginia, where he died in 2002 at age 24. After his death, Pleasant Colony returned to Buckland Farm to be buried in the primary field of Barn 4, the Broodmare Barn, in the field adjacent to the farm‚Äôs main house site.

Documentation for the DRAMBORA toolkit is available at the Digital Curation Centre's and DigitalPreservationEurope's DRAMBORA Interactive page. The DRAMBORA toolkit is intended to facilitate internal audit of digital preservation repositories by providing repository administrators with a means to assess their capabilities, identify their weaknesses, and recognise their strengths. The development of the toolkit follows a concentrated period of repository pilot audits undertaken by the DCC, conducted at a diverse range of organisations including national libraries, scientific data centres and cultural and heritage data archives. The construction of a toolkit of this kind is a dynamic process and this is the second stage in this process. The DRAMBORA toolkit represents the latest development in an ongoing international effort to conceive criteria, means and methodologies for audit and certification of digital repositories. The intention throughout its development was to build upon, extend and complement existing efforts. A key requirement has been to establish a toolkit that contributes towards a single process for repository assessment. The importance of international cooperation and collaboration, and the potential dangers associated with divergence were acknowledged very early on within the DCC and DPE's work in this area. The results of the original efforts of RLG/NARA task force and the nestor working group to develop criteria for audit and certification of trustworthy digital repositories and the work that was led by the Center for Research Libraries (CRL) were foremost within the considerations throughout the development of the DRAMBORA toolkit, and in the DCC-led pilot audits that preceded it. The DCC/DPE working group has engaged with representatives of other groups to agree upon a set of principles, representing the fundamental, objective baseline criteria for preservation repositories, and these and their underlying concepts, are profoundly important within the toolkit. It is anticipated that self-audit based on DRAMBORA can be facilitated if undertaken in association with one or both of the check-lists, and vice versa. The risk-based approach assists efforts to match a repository against these lists of requirements. Only with a clear view of an organisation's business context and its implicit risks can an auditor effectively use these requirements. The toolkit contextualises these lists so they can be more effectively applied. In addition to these resources, we have also sought to incorporate and adapt ideas and concepts from an additional, diverse range of sources, including a wide range of international information standards, many with their basis in the risk management industry aiming to broaden ever further the perspectives that our international colleagues have already established.

Beginning at the Imari Shrine, the festival is well known as one of the three great fighting festivals of Japan. The festival has been held since 1829. Two shrines, Aramikoshi and Danjiri, meet at various points throughout central Imari. They are smashed together simultaneously until one shrine falls back. This is done to the sound of a beating drum within the shrine Danjiri, the sound of which gives Ton Ten Ton its name.https://tontenton.jp/?page_id=138  Changes to the festival  In 1955, the number of matches was reduced and alcohol consumption by participants pulling the floats was banned.

Born in Chingford, then a village in Essex, she was the eldest daughter of a curate. Louisa Aldrich-Blake graduated in medicine from the Royal Free Hospital in 1893. She obtained her Master of Surgery degree and was a lead surgeon by 1910. Louisa volunteered for military medical service during the First World War. She was one of the first people to perform surgery on rectal and cervical cancers. In recognition of her commitment and achievements, a statue was erected in Tavistock Square, London. This statue's position is close to her alma mater.  Early life and education  Louisa Aldrich-Blake was born in Chingford, Essex to Rev Frederick James Aldrich- Blake and his wife Louisa Blake Morrison. She moved with her family to Welsh Bicknor in Herefordshire during her childhood, and maintained a home in the town until her death. Throughout her career, Aldrich-Blake was associated with the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital, becoming senior surgeon in 1910. Aldrich-Blake began her school education at Cheltenham Ladies' College. She graduated with first-class honours from the London School of Medicine for Women by 1894 as a Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Medicine and an MD.

Career Louisa Brandreth Aldrich-Blake, portrait by Harry Herman Salomon commissioned by Henry Wellcome. The newly qualified Aldrich-Blake began work at the New Hospital for Women and Children in London. She worked her way up to become the lead surgeon while also working at the city's Royal Free Hospital. At the Royal Free Hospital, she was the first woman to hold the post of surgical registrar in 1895 and also acted as an anaesthetist. Her position as consulting surgeon at the Royal Free started in 1919 and ended when she died in 1925. She also worked at the Canning Town Women's Settlement Hospital. During the First World War, many of the male surgical staff were deployed on foreign active service and Dr. Aldrich-Blake took on increased responsibility for the surgery, becoming consulting surgeon to the hospital. Aldrich-Blake spent multiple holidays aiding the military hospitals in 1914 to 1916, specifically in France with Dr. Frances Ivens from the Anglo-French Red Cross Hospital and helped out as a visiting surgeon at the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps Hospital. Aldrich- Blake was nicknamed \\"Madame la G√©n√©rale\\" by her patients. Her time was also spent contacting other women in the profession to organise volunteer units. She approached every woman on the Medical Register to ask if they would consider volunteering for the Royal Army Medical Corps, and 48 enrolled, many of whom were sent to Malta. Aldrich-Blake was the first to perform operations for cervical and rectal cancers. She led the British surgeons in taking on the Wertheim operation for carcinoma of the cervix. Aldrich-Blake added a piece to the Practitioner's Encyclopedia of Midwifery and Diseases of Women named \\"Pain as a symptom of pelvic trouble\\" and a piece on \\"Abdomino-perineal excision of the rectum by a new method\\" in the British Medical Journal in 1903. She held a chair position as a vice-president of the Section of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 1924 that was a part of the British Medical Association. Although she had a professional practice, Aldrich-Blake never received a sizeable salary for her work. Academia Aldrich-Blake was devoted to training students at her alma mater, the London School of Medicine for Women (now the medical school of University College London). She became Vice-Dean in 1906 and Dean of the School in 1914. Aldrich-Blake's encouragement for women to join the medical field increased the school's population by almost double during the First World War. Death and legacy Aldrich-Blake died on 28 December 1925 from cancer at home having undergone several operations during previous weeks. St Pancras Church, in London, celebrated her life on 1 January 1926 and her ashes were transferred back to her home in Welsh Bicknor. Memorial in Tavistock Square. The Dame Louisa Brandreth Aldrich-Blake Collection is located in the Royal Free Hospital's Archives Centre. A statue of her is in Tavistock Square, London. Her career was highlighted in a 2015 exhibit specifically related to her actions in the First World War where she performed surgery on the front line and encouraged other women to join the field. She also influenced the War Office to allow women to enlist to be a part of the medical staff. In 2019, she was acknowledged with a Google Doodle for the UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Bulgaria, Sweden, Denmark, Estonia, and Iceland on the 154th anniversary of her birth. Awards and honours In the year of her death, Aldrich-Blake was named a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire on the New Year's Honours List in 1925.

A gifted and talented player, he was voted by the Greek sports magazine \\"Ethnosport\\" as one of the 50 best Greek football players ever. Having gained fame in Greece as the creative playmaker for Panachaiki FC, Davourlis attracted even more attention during the 1973 season, when he helped his team become the first Greek countryside football club ever to qualify for a European competition (the 1974 UEFA Cup).Rsssf, website about football statistics Davourlis was famed for his technical ability, his ball skill, his creative passes and his powerful shot in or outside the box; furthermore, his leadership was exemplary. He was also a notable free kick taker, as demonstrated by his numerous goals from outside the penalty area. In spite of the fact that his career had a rather bitter end for a player of his caliber, he is still worshiped by fans all over the Peloponnese. The Panachaiki Stadium bears his name since 1992, when he died due to a heart attack.Bogonikolos, Nikos. \\"The black diamond\\", Peloponnisos, 22 May 2006 Club career=Early career, Panionios Patron and Panachaiki 1962‚Äì1971 Davourlis was born in Patras. Having been discovered by Panachaiki former player and scouter Spyros Voulgarakis, he began his playing career at the age of fourteen with a Panachaiki subsidiary team, Panionios Patron. Two years later he joined the senior team and contributed to Panachaiki's battle to reach the Greek first division. His most notable achievement at that time was that he became the first Greek football player to be selected for the national team while playing for a second division team.Ethnosport, \\"The top 50\\" Finally, after several unsuccessful attempts, Panachaiki made it to the \\"big\\" division in 1969 and Davourlis' talent shone. However, the team was involved in a bribery scandal and sunk again to the lower division. Fortunately enough for Davourlis, they were back a year later and the Black Prince of Patras led Panachaiki's rise towards glory. Panachaiki and Olympiacos 1971‚Äì1978 In the 1972 season, Davourlis scored 15 goals and Panachaiki finished sixth. The best was still to come though. After an amazing 1973 season in which he scored again 15 goals, including a hat trick in Toumba Stadium against championship contender PAOK, he achieved with Panachaiki something that no other Greek countryside club ever had done at the time: participation in a European competition, for instance the 1974 UEFA Cup. In 1974, Davourlis' performances and leadership were still very good but rumors related to his transfer affected him considerably. Panachaiki proved to be unable to become a real threat to the local powerhouses and finished once again sixth. At the end of a season during which he scored 11 times in the Championship and once in the UEFA Cup, Davourlis was transferred to Olympiacos. The transfer fee was 9.25 million Drachmas, the highest in Greek football history at the time. At Olympiacos, Davourlis was one of the top players of the team, along with Georgios Delikaris, Yves Triantafyllos and Julio Losada. His team won one Greek Championship title and reached two consecutive Greek Cup finals, winning thanks to his goal in 1975 and losing in 1976.Rsssf, website about football statistics Nevertheless, his heart was travelling somewhere else. Panachaiki 1978‚Äì1985 In 1978, when Davourlis was transferred back to Panachaiki, almost nothing in Patras remained of the glorious team that fascinated Greece in the first half of the decade. Davourlis' presence increased the level of the team, but the results remained poor, leading to the club's relegation to the Second Division in 1981 and once again in 1985. He ended his career with Korinthos FC in 1986. Later on he worked for Panachaiki as a scouter discovering many talents until the year he died, the most famous of whom is Grigoris Georgatos. International career Davourlis earned his first cap with the Greek national football team on 23 July 1969, coming in as a substitute in the 75th minute of a friendly match against the Australia. Had Davourlis spent more years playing for a Greek powerhouse, the number of his national team selections would have been undoubtedly higher. Destiny's choice, however, is something that will always remain strictly personal.

It celebrated its 250th anniversary on the 31st of January 2008 and is one of the country's oldest established theatres. Many well known acts have played here over the years, including Ching Lau Lauro, William Charles Macready, Charles Kean , Tom Thumb and his spouse (Mr and Mrs Stratton), Paganini, Donald Sinden, Bernard Cribbins and The Bolshoi Ballet. It hosts a large range of touring productions. The theatre had a ¬£10m refurbishment in 2007, designed by Tim Foster Architects. In 2015, plans were launched for the new ¬£15m Stage Two building under the direction of the then CEO Peter Wilson MBE. The new building was to house one of europe's most technically advanced arts education facilities, and a new 200 seat auditorium. In 2016, it was announced that Peter was to depart the Theatre Royal, after 25 years at the helm. It was later announced that the new auditorium would be named the Peter Wilson Studio. In mid 2016, Stephen Crocker, a former deputy CEO of The Lowry theatre was announced as the new Chief Executive. In 2019, Norwich Theatre Royal was rebranded to become the Norwich Theatre group alongside Norwich Playhouse.  Shows  A traditional family pantomime is produced in-house annually for the Christmas season each year. The 2019 production of Cinderella starred Kara- Lianne Jones and Prince Charming (David Witts) as the love-struck young couple who will live happily ever after come the end of the show. Joining them on stage was the entertaining sister act - Alexa (Amanda Henderson) and Siri (Alix Dunmore) - who were good, bad and indeed ugly, as Cinders' sisters. In addition, it regularly attracts a host of touring theatre productions.  History  The second Theatre Royal (previous to the building pictured) was built in 1826. The theatre announced its opening. The popular magician Ching Lau Lauro received a bad review there, from the Norfolk Chronicle, in 1828. Just over a year after the theatre burnt down its successor was revealed. In 1894 the theatre was closed for several months in order to carry out a scheme of reconstruction and redecoration from the designs of Frank Matcham. The theatre owner's death in 1902 led to its auction. In November Harry Lauder made his first visit to Norwich with his BIG VARIETY ROAD SHOW in 1935. George Barnes played The Grand Vizier to John Inman's Wishee Washee in Aladdin Christmas 1975. This was to be George's 33rd pantomime season. Television newsreader Helen McDermott landed a part as Helen the Sultana of Booberoomba - doubling as a tavern wench - in Dick Whittington and His Cat in January 2001. Mother Goose, the 2001 pantomime beat box office targets by ¬£10,000. A Birthday profit for Norwich Theatre Royal in 2002 as it celebrated its tenth anniversary since reopening, with a profit of ¬£76,000, more than twice the previous year's surplus. The 2002 pantomime was Jack and the Beanstalk starring Rikki Jay.

In 1935, Woodward and partners sold the company to Standard Oil & Gas for $46 million. He was born at Podunk, New York to William W. and Ida May LaGrange Woodward. Because his father made his living in the oil business in its earliest days at Titusville, Pennsylvania, Emerson wanted to follow in his footsteps. After receiving an early education in the Goodwill Hill public schools in Pennsylvania, Woodward, at the age of eleven, went to work in the oil fields, and before the end of his career, he would be affiliated with the industry in various other states, including Oklahoma, Ohio, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. He married Bessie McGarry in 1901 at her hometown of Woodsfield, Ohio. The couple had only one child, a son, Harley E. Woodward, who died at age 34 when the private plane he was in crashed into Rich Mountain, Arkansas.Baltimore Sun ‚Äì March 6, 1936 The Producers Oil Company employed Emerson Woodward for eleven years, and during this stretch, he met his lifelong associate, Thomas Peter Lee, who worked for the same firm. Woodward advanced quickly within the organization and received a promotion to assistant superintendent of its southern division, which encompassed the area from New Orleans to El Paso. Later, he helped organize the Farmers Petroleum Company, held the position of superintendent, and in 1921 became president of the Republic Production Company, a subsidiary of American Republics Corporation. With the formation of the Yount-Lee Oil Company, Woodward eventually became one of its largest stockholders. Trapshooting Emerson Woodward, in January 1924, advanced $28,000 to build the Houston Gun Club on Westheimer Road, and he actively participated in his favorite hobby of trapshooting in the company of friends such as Hank A. Hausmann of LaGrange, Texas and Forest McNeir, a fellow Houstonian. His expert marksmanship earned for him places in the National Trapshooting Hall of Fame, which inducted him on August 24, 1973, and in the Texas Trapshooters Association Hall of Fame, which reciprocated in 1983. One of his records \\"in 1933 ‚Ä¶ set a yearly ATA (American Trapshooters Association) 16-yard average record of .9950 that was not broken or tied until 1965, some thirty-two years later. Valdina Farms After the Yount-Lee sale, Emerson Woodward announced, \\"Well, I sold the last of my oil interests today. I've got nothing to do but fool with horses.\\" He kept his word, retired from the oil business and spent much of his time occupied with the sport of the kings. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, on his ranch, Valdina Farms, spanning located in both Uvalde and Medina Counties in Texas, hence the name Valdina, he raised, trained, and sent his horses such as Valdina Myth, Valdina Orphan, and Rounders to racetracks all over the country. Called by The New York Times as \\"one of the largest and most famous racing stables of its time,\\" New York Times - May 25, 1943 under trainer Frank Catrone these Thoroughbreds competed head to head with some of the best the American racing world had to offer. Valdina Myth was the 1940 two-year-old-fillies earnings Champion and the 1941 Kentucky Oaks winner. Valdina Myth's pedigree and racing history Valdina Orphan, with jockey Carroll Bierman aboard, won 1942 Derby Trial Stakes then ran third in the Kentucky Derby.Valdina Orphan's pedigree and racing history Irish bred Rounders won several top races in the United States including the 1942 Arlington Handicap in which he beat the great Triple Crown champion, Whirlaway.Rounders' pedigree and racing history For his contributions to the industry, the Texas Horse Racing Hall of Fame inducted him as a member in 2001. Philanthropy Emerson and his wife were also recognized for their philanthropic accomplishments. According to Jack Meyer, their pastor at the Heights Church of Christ in Houston, \\"They financed an orphanage in Hope, Arkansas ‚Ä¶, built the Church of Christ at College Station, contributed heavily to the Boles Orphans home at Quinlan, Texas. They sent many girls through the Abilene Christian College, paying all their expenses.\\" Death An automobile driven by Woodward collided into the side of a train at a grade crossing near D'Hanis, Texas, close to Hondo in Medina County, and the accident claimed both his life and that of his wife, the only other passenger in the vehicle. Bessie Woodward died of injuries on May 22, 1943, and Emerson followed at age sixty- four two days later while a patient at the Medina Hospital in Hondo.Miami News - May 24, 1943 A double funeral was held in Houston at Heights Church of Christ, and they were entombed in a mausoleum at the city's Forest Park Cemetery. Their fifteen-year-old grandson, Robert Woodward, would inherit their entire estate.Palm Beach Post ‚Äì May 30, 1943 References=Sources * McKinley, Fred B., and Greg Riley.

The team played its home games at Sundby Idr√¶tspark.  Big visions  The vision for the Amager merger was announced at a press conference at Fremad Amager headquarters on Tuesday March 20, 2007 by Faroese footballer and future club owner, Todi J√≥nsson; real estate agent, sponsor and member of the Fremad Amager board, Hanne N√∏rrisgaard; new sponsor Eik Bank representative, Claus Bodenhoff;Medarbejdere; Claus Bodenhoff Eik Bank, retrieved June 7, 2007 and former Fremad Amager chairman Karsten √òstergaard.

The reason why the team did not exist before August 2008, is that the deficit of 3 million DKK in Fremad Amager had to be paid out by the former majority share holder before the Dansk Boldspil-Union deadline of submission on March 31, 2007. As it was not realistic to keep the original plans of playing from 2007, it was decided to postpone the merge for one year. Furthermore, none of the participating clubs had the organisation or facilities needed to secure promotion to the Superliga.  Background  Before the press conference, the merge and new professional team was known under different work titles: 'Amager FC' (a different football club already exists under this name), '√òens Hold' (English: The Islass Team, not to be mistaken with Odense Boldklub and the cooperation between Funenian clubs) and finally plain 'Amager' (a joint team for promising youngsters from Amager) and had been underway since the summer of 2005. However, the plans did not proceed before a group consisting of four Faroese investors under the name of Fremad Amager Invest A/S and with the footballer Todi J√≥nsson as the front man, at an extraordinary press general assembly on March 15, 2007, took over the majority of the shares (51.7%) of Fremad Amager.F√¶r√∏sk kapital skudt ind i Fremad Amager Amager Bladet, March 19, 2007. The other investors in the new company were composed by an investment group from the Faroe Islands and two investors from the Copenhagen IT-business, and had a starting capital of 1.5 million DKK.Slut med Benny i Fremad A. , CPH News, March 29, 2007 The previous majority stockholder, controversial real estate agent Hanne N√∏rrisgaard, represented a third of the shares. According to Todi J√≥nsson, the plans to take over a club in Denmark to use for Faroese players started two years prior to the takeover, with concrete dialogue with Fremad Amager starting 1.5 years prior to the takeover.Fremad-bosser p√• overarbejde, Lokalavisen, April 30, 2007 Kastrup Boldklub were to have joined the merger, but due to their engagement in Amager United and the conflicts in getting out of that arrangement, including the court trial against Amager United Aps in connection with the break-up, the club chairman, S√∏ren Mogensen, stated that this would not happen.Kastrup og T√•rnby begraver strids√∏ksen Amager Bladet, May 15, 2007 It was expected that Kastrup Boldklub would join the merger at a later stage, as the club was one of the two original promoters of the √òens Hold-project. The question of joining FC Amager was raised at a general assembly with a positive result, and the promoters and investors of FC Amager had stated that there was an open invitation to all football clubs on Amager to join the new team. The last attempt to join the football clubs of Amager and create a competitive professional team with Superliga ambitions came at the initiative of a number of people in Kastrup Boldklub and Fremad Amager, when it was realized that no Amager club would be economically strong enough to survive in the Superliga on its own.√òens Hold B.T., November 14, 2005 Fremad Amager contacted Kastrup Boldklub and T√•rnby Boldklub (the two clubs behind Amager United) to discuss the possibilities of a future collaboration, to which the Kastrup Boldklub board were positive. After an informal meeting in June 2005 (XX) between Karsten √òstergaard (then chairman of the amateur side of Fremad Amager and member of the board) and Gorm Thorius (then chairman of Kastrup Boldklub) as well as S√∏ren Mortensen (then representative of Kastrup Boldklub in the board of Amager United), the group invited all 35 football clubs from Amager to a co-operation through a grand meeting on October 13, 2005. Representatives from 10 clubs showed up and expressed a wish to join non- binding discussions about future collaboration and the completion of a work document for the basis of decision for establishing of the team. Later, however, it turned out that the idea of a joint professional team did not have the backing of a number of the clubs' boards and general assemblies. After the meeting in June 2005, Gorm Thorius and S√∏ren Mortensen left the Amager United board, due to accusations of being disloyal to the club when entering talks with Fremad Amager. The disagreements between Kastrup Boldklub and T√•rnby Boldklub were to be characteristic for the future of Amager united. On November 14, 2006, after a long debate among the members of Kastrup Boldklub the vote was 80.2% for and 19.8% against.Klokkeklart ja fra Kastrup Amager Bladet, November 20, 2006 Shortly after the general assemblies in Amager FF and Kl√∏vermarkens FB also agreed. Fremad Amager did not need a general assembly, as the amateur part of the club had waived the right to decide over the professional part of the club when Fremad Amager became a public limited company. Shortly after the grand meeting, T√•rnby Boldklub withdrew from √òens Hold due to their engagement in Amager United. Likewise AB 70 also withdrew from the talks due to their newly won promotion to the 2nd Division, as the merge would mean a relegation of their team to Danmarksserien. In October 2006, this was followed up by the board of B1908 which had two representatives in √òen Hold. The board did not feel that the existing document for the basis of decision was good enough to be accepted at an extraordinary general assembly. Furthermore, they could not surrender the sovereignty of the club, as they did not feel that the project was sustainable due to the lack of concrete major sponsors. Drag√∏r Boldklub did raise the question at a general assembly on December 5, 2006 however the club was not given the mandate to participate, as only one of the members of the club voted for the project. Neither Sundby Boldklub nor S√∏nderbro Fight agreed to a formal collaboration.  Logo and mascot  The logo of FC Amager was drawn by the Faroese communication bureau Sansir and features a pair of angel wings (from the Fremad Amager nickname), a shield with Dannebrog and the club name in abbreviated form as the central elements of the design.Sansir har designet FC Amagers logo Sansir, retrieved June 7, 2007 FC Amager's club kits will be a combination of blue and white colors.

With Aquilina's novel Taƒßt Tliet Saltnet, he wrote using the orthographic system designed by the Akkademja tal-Malti (at the time it was known as l-Gƒßaqda tal-Kittieba tal-Malti (Maltese Authors Society)) and chose to write in the Semitic form rather in romance form to build this characteristic that Maltese is a European language. Apart from this linguistic mission, Aquilina also had an ideological term. In the mixture of History and inventions of historic literature novel, he made conditions and aspects from human life to build to the reader opinions in favour of Maltese history. The story The era that happened the events of the novel Taƒßt Tliet Saltniet was years of revolution. In America, the fight for freedom broke the chains of servilism. In France, one of the most bloody revolution was finished and throughout all of Europe, the shout for justice and equality had been heard across one kingdom after another. In Malta of the Knights of St John period, this shout was also heard. This novel of Professor Aquilina is written on this idea. Alessandru Habela, the son of baroness Isabella, fell in love with Pawlina, an 18-year-old youth, the daughter of the farmer Pawlu ta' Menzju. Once on the way, Alessandru saw Pina, a poor lady that was going to die. Without thinking twice, he entered his mother's house and was going to take care of her, but she died after few days. For his mother and for the other nobel persons like her this act was one of the greatest scandals. Isabella shouted very much about this act, and sent his son Alessandru out of the house and took off his nobility title. Alessandru then began to live like the child, of a farmer that cultivates fields, from the things that he grew in the fields, providing food for others.

St. Swithin's Church The church which houses the Norwich Arts Centre is dedicated to Saint Swithun and dates to the fifteenth century, although an earlier, Anglo-Saxon church may have existed on the site. The area was originally a wealthy one, with four medieval churches close to each other. However it had become a slum by the nineteenth century. St. Swithin's became redundant and was closed in 1881. In 1882, the church's tower was demolished as it had become unsafe, this was later replaced by a bell-cot. The building was back in use as a church between 1883 and 1891, after which time it fell into disrepair. In 1905, a clergyman, John Sawbridge, raised funds for it to be reopened as an Evangelical church, to cater for the poor and deprived surrounding area. There was sufficient money for a large, adjoining parish mission and school room to be constructed in 1908. However, by 1951, the church was again redundant due to falling numbers of local residents. It was used as a furniture warehouse until it was taken over by the Arts Centre in 1980. The church itself became an auditorium, and the schoolroom became an exhibition space and cafe. Little of the interior of the church remains in place except for ten monuments, the oldest being to Sibilla Skottowe (died 1657) and Anne Skottowe (died 1662). Another monument is to William Abbott (1754-1818), a veteran of the American War of Independence, who served at the Battle of Bunker Hill.

The intersection of Raja SC Mullick Road and Central Road is a very busy place with the 8B bus stand, numerous shops, restaurants, Jadavpur Railway Station, Auto Rickshaw stands and Government Offices in its vicinity. Residents say that the entire 4-kilometer stretch is a commuters‚Äô nightmare. The situation is worse at four points ‚Äî at the EM Bypass crossing opposite the route 45 bus terminus, a complete nightmare at Jadavpur 8B bus terminus, then at Bagha Jatin, and finally at the four-point crossing in Garia. Recently, to ease traffic flow, the public works department (PWD) has decided to widen the road up to 60 feet. The four-km stretch of this road is between 25 and 60 feet wide now. The PWD has sanctioned Rs 3 crore for the project. If everything goes according to schedule, the work will be completed by monsoon of 2009. Like the other well-known roads, the entire stretch is full with food hawkers and street vendors. There are vendors with little kerosene stoves making egg toasts‚Äîan omelette on a lightly toasted sliced bread and serving them with a cup of tea. Then there are little food stalls selling rolls - chicken roll, egg-chicken rolls etc. The ones in front of Jadavpur market are specially good! Then there is roti served with ghugny and aloor dom, shingara (Bengali breakfast samosas), muglai paratha (crispy bread stuffed with mince and fried), chow mein, chilli chicken, biryani, sweetmeats and, of course, chai (tea). Food joints The 8B bus stand junction on this road is very crowded but it offers a variety of restaurants, food stalls and confectionaries on Central Road. There are air-conditioned restaurants such as Banzara, Blue Lagoon. Then there are small snack shops selling Chicken patties and other snacks such as Sugar and Spice, Bake Club.

J. and Mary Jane Cross Rothwell. Educated in the public schools of both his native state and Ohio, he began his career in the oil fields and eventually moved to Saratoga, Texas, where he found work with the production division of the Sun Oil Company. On August 13, 1913, he married Mabel Martha Lee, the daughter of Thomas Peter Lee, and to this union, three daughters were born: Mary Elizabeth, Essie Lee, and Virginia Mae. In 1914 he and Miles Franklin Yount formed the Yount-Rothwell Oil Company, which later became the Yount-Lee Oil Company, of which he became vice president and superintendent of production‚Äîand eventually its president. Tal Rothwell had numerous business ties and held directorships on the boards of the Citizen National Bank of Sour Lake, Texas, the First National Bank of Beaumont, the Lake Tool Company, and the Rex Supply Company of Sour Lake. A devoutly religious man with a gentle voice and calm demeanor, he rose as one of the leaders of the First Methodist Church of Beaumont, where he was steward and chairman of the finance committee, and the music committee. Once during the Depression, when the church needed $39,000 to complete an addition to the Sunday School building, the Rothwells contributed $30,000 to the cause. They also donated the Aeolian- Skinner organ, and a new parsonage to First Methodist. As a civic leader, Tal served on the Texas Y.M.C.A. board as a member-at-large; was vice president of the Community Chest board, and president of the board of directors of the Beaumont General Hospital, which later became St. Therese. As a devoted family man and humanitarian, he recognized the fact that some oil field roughnecks tended to drink away their paychecks immediately after receiving them. Due to a genuine concern that his employees‚Äô families were not being adequately fed and clothed, at times he summoned the wives to Spindletop and gave their husbands‚Äô pay to them directly to ensure that they would at least have the opportunity to see the money first. This type of spirit prevailed within the Yount-Lee organization, and Rothwell, like the other company officers, contributed some of his personal income to other worthy causes, which included aid to the area‚Äôs needy families. After the sale of the Yount-Lee Oil Company, Tal Rothwell maintained an office on the fifteenth floor of the San Jacinto Building in Beaumont, Texas, where he looked after his family‚Äôs personal investments. He died at age sixty-two on December 16, 1949. Afterward, Mabel donated the Rothwell Bible Chair and Wesley Foundation to Lamar State College of Technology (now Lamar University), and the dedication was held on February 8, 1953. However, while discussing the terms of her will with Marvin McClendon and Martin Davis, certified public accountants; Harry Garnham, the Rothwell business manager for years; and Ken Linsley, another connection to the estate, she died suddenly of a heart attack in her home on November 14 of that same year. Both ‚ÄúPapa Tal‚Äù and Mabel are buried at Beaumont‚Äôs Magnolia Cemetery. References * McKinley, Fred B., and Greg Riley.

It was the seat of the Counts of Castell. Today it is part of the municipal association Wiesentheid. It has around 800 inhabitants. Geography=Location Castell is located on the western slope of the Mittelgebirge Steigerwald in the district of Kitzingen of the Franconia region. Its territory borders on that of Oberscheinfeld, located in the neighbouring district of Neustadt (Aisch)-Bad Windsheim. Subdivision Castell has seven Ortsteile: Castell, Forsthaus, Geiersm√ºhle, , Gr√ºndleinsm√ºhle, and . The municipal territory was 2,292 hectares in 2013, of which 1,162 ha were accounted for by forest and 936 by agricultural use. Settlement and transport areas total just 168 ha. Neighbouring communities Castell borders on (clockwise from the north) Abtswind, Geiselwind, Oberscheinfeld, Iphofen, Wiesenbronn and R√ºdenhausen. History Castell was first mentioned in the foundation charter of Megingaudshausen Abbey (later moved to M√ºnsterschwarzach), dated 816. In 1091, a noble named Rupert refers to himself in a document from the Diocese of W√ºrzburg as de Castello, marking the first use of the name. From 1202, the lords of Castell held the rank of Graf (count), after 1228 with the supplement dei gratia (\\"by the grace of god\\"). The site of the old castle on the Schlossberg above Castell The hill south of the village, was long the site of two castles. This partition was first mentioned around 1266 in a document by and . On the peak known as Herrenberg stood a castle held after 1328 by the Burgraviate of Nuremberg and later by the Margraviate of Brandenburg-Ansbach, who also controlled part of the village of Castell. On the Schlossberg stood a castle held by the Counts of Castell. Both were destroyed in the Peasants' War in 1525 by revolting peasants. The Counts had their castle rebuilt, while the other remained a ruin. Between 1546 and 1561, the Counts Conrad, Georg and Heinrich Castell introduced Reformation to the County, thus founding a small Landeskirche centred on Castell. After the destruction of their castle, the Margraviate of Brandenburg moved their Amt to Kleinlangheim but held on to their half of the village of Castell. In 1680/84, Graf (1641-1709) bought back the Brandenburg territory and had a new Baroque palace built by Peter Sommer in 1686-91. This was one of the earliest three-winged palaces in Franconia. Church St. Johannes In 1691, the Counts moved to the new Schloss at the foot of the hill and the old castle was relegated to a farm building. Later it was used as a source of building materials and, in 1818/19, Graf Friedrich Ludwig zu Castell-Castell had the previously treeless Schlossberg turned into an English landscape garden. The new castle is still today owned and inhabited by the prince of Castell-Castell. In 1774, the Gr√§flich Castell-Remlingen'sche Landes-Credit- Cassa was founded here, the oldest Bavarian bank still in operation, known today as '. During mediatisation, the County lost its role as a sovereign state it had held within the Holy Roman Empire. In September 1806, it was turned into a part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. The Landeskirche became part of the Bavarian Protestant church in 1814. In 1818, during the reordering of Bavaria, the municipality Castell was created. From 1902-7, the F√ºrstlich Castell'sches Archiv (princely archive) was set up by the historian and writer , who also authored the standard work on the history of the House of Castell. In 1950, the Communit√§t Casteller Ring, a Protestant religious order for women, was established in Castell and took its name from the village. In 1957, the mother house moved to the Schwanberg. On 1 July 1977, the formerly independent municipalities of Greuth and W√ºstenfelden became part of Castell. Economy Much of the economy of Castell is still linked to its historical role as a princely seat. Since 1972, the main office of the F√ºrstlich Castell‚Äôsche Bank has been at W√ºrzburg, but it retains a presence in Castell which remains the formal seat of the bank. ' produces high-quality wine on a total area of 70 hectares of vineyards. The vineyards around the Castell Schlossberg were first mentioned in 1266. The village's many historic buildings also make it a popular tourist destination. Government The mayor of Castell is Jochen Kramer. Attractions The village features a number of listed monuments (see list of protected monuments in Castell (German)). St. Johannes The church , is one of the most prominent buildings in Castell. The current early Neoclassical hall church was built in 1784-92, based on plans by Joseph Albert still showing Baroque influences. Like its predecessors, it served as the main church of the Protestant Landeskirche of Castell. The princely burial place is located here. Today, it is the main church of the '. Schloss Castell Schloss Castell ' (Castell palace), built in the late 17th century in Baroque style, remains the seat of the princely family of Castell-Castell. Around 1820, the formal Baroque garden was turned into an English landscape garden. Between 1863 and 1869 Graf Friedrich Ludwig (1791-1875) had the Torbau, the eastern wing and the corner pavilions rebuilt and expanded in Baroque revival style. A new stables was added at that time, which serves today as the restaurant Weinstall. Around 1870, the park was expanded based on plans by Carl von Effner. These Anlagen feature a pond, a new stables, a riding hall and the Wiedervereinigungsstein from 1991 by Theo Steinbrenner. Castle ruins Remains of the Oberschloss The mound where the Unterschloss once stood Outside of the village, on the peaks known as Herrenberg and Schlossberg, are the remains of the two castles. The ' marks the location of the original seat of the Counts of Castell. The medieval castle was expanded during the Second Margrave War in 1553. In 1607 to 1615 it was replaced by an early-modern one. This in turn fell into disuse after Schloss Castell was built. Besides trenches and structures below ground, only a stair tower with some attached walls remains today (this dates from the rebuilding in the early 17th century). Even less is visible of the other castle, held by the Burgraviate of Nuremberg and later by the Margraviate of Brandenburg-Ansbach. It is today known as , formerly also Unteres Schloss (lower castle) to distinguish it from the Oberes Schloss or Oberschloss (upper castle). All that remains of this structure is a mound, later planted with trees. Wildbad Castell served as a spa for many centuries. The Wildbad was first mentioned in 1399. It grew so fast in the 16th century that in 1601 a new two-storied spa building was erected in Renaissance style. Visitors took baths in curative \\"bitter\\" water. In the late 17th century, the Wildbad was closed. The building then served as the seat of the princely government and administration and of the Landeskirche. The princely bank was founded here and the building later housed the princely archive, which today contains around 8,000 documents. The original bathing rooms in the cellar also still exist today.

In December 1941, the company transferred the line to , which was renamed to the Toyama Chih≈ç Railway in 1943. The line was nationalized in June 1943 by Imperial Japanese Government Railways due to line's importance as a freight and materiel route to the port of Toyama. The Japanese National Railways (JNR) modified the Toyamak≈ç Line's electrification system to 1500 V DC, the last to be altered among JNR lines acquired from private companies. When JNR was privatized in 1987, the line became part of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) network. During the time JR West operated the Toyamak≈ç Line (which ended on 28 February 2006) it suffered a long period of declining passengers and the resulting reduction in service. The Toyama Light Rail Company, a public-private partnership with the Hokuriku Electric Power Company, Intec, and the municipal and prefectural governments as major shareholders, was set up to own and operate the line. It was modified for light rail services and reopened on April 29, 2006, returning it to service under a Toyama-based company after half a century of outside management. Prior to the line's transfer in 2006, patronage was 1,700 passengers on weekdays and fewer than 750 on weekends. Under Toyama Light Rail ownership, the line proved to be surprisingly successful: 12,750 people rode the line on the first day. By November 9, 2006, one million passengers had used the line. Services Approximately six services are operated in each direction per hour in the morning, 4 in the daytime to evening, 2 in the late night. The fare is JPY 200 for an adult, 100 for a child per ride, reduced to 160 for an adult and 80 for a child when using the Passca, a smart card ticketing system.

City leaders had earlier proposed a November 1 deadline for the Chinese population to leave the city. On November 3, 1885, a mob that consisted of prominent businessmen, police, and political leaders descended on the Chinese community.Pfaelzer 2007, pp. 219-220. The mob marched Chinese residents to a railroad station and forced them to board a train to Portland.Pfaelzer 2007, pp. 221-222. In the following days, the structures that remained in the Chinese community were razed.Pfaelzer 2007, pp. 222-223. The event was the result of growing anti-Chinese sentiment and violence throughout the American West. This organized action became known as the \\"Tacoma method\\", and despite national and international outcry, it was used as an example of how to forcibly remove Chinese residents from cities and towns throughout the American West.Pfaelzer 2007, p. 219. The anti-Chinese sentiment in Tacoma and Washington Territory more broadly made it so that those involved did not face repercussions for their actions.Pfaelzer 2007, pp. 224-228. This impacted Chinese immigration to Tacoma for decades. In 1992, the Chinese Citizens Reconciliation Committee was created.Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation 2013, \\"The History of the Foundation.\\" In 1993, the Tacoma City Council issued a statement on the expulsion saying that it was \\"a most reprehensible occurrence\\".Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation 2013, \\"The History of the Foundation.\\" In 2005, Chinese Reconciliation Park broke ground on the Tacoma waterfront to commemorate the event.Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation 2013, \\"Tacoma Chinese Park.\\"  Background = Chinese community of Tacoma  Some members of the Chinese community were situated along Pacific Avenue, near the Hatch Mill. Some of their shacks are pictured here. In 1873, the Northern Pacific Railway announced plans to situate its western terminus in Tacoma. Given the experience of Chinese laborers on other major railroad projects, they were among the laborers that were hired to work on the new construction.Hildebrand 1977, pp. 20-21. The Northern Pacific Railway completed its Tacoma terminal on December 27, 1873.Hildebrand 1977, p. 21. Because there was still work to be done building wharves and smaller rail lines, Chinese workers remained in the area. The Northern Pacific Railway leased the Chinese land near the train tracks which became the Tacoma Chinatown.Chin 1992, p. 59. This was located on the Tacoma waterfront near present-day Downtown Tacoma.Chin 1992, p. 59. By the 1880s, there were approximately 1,000 Chinese residents living in Pierce County with 700 of them in Tacoma.Wilcox 1978, p. 204 There was a fluctuation of the numbers of Chinese residents during this time due to the lack of record keeping and the transient nature of the industries that many Chinese residents worked in. There were several Chinese owned businesses within Chinatown selling groceries and household goods, but the majority of the Chinese were employed in laundries, small stores, hotels, restaurants, and domestic work.Chin 1992, pp. 58-59.  Regional and national anti-Chinese sentiment  California became the core site of early anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States beginning in the 1850s. While Chinese immigrants enjoyed a much older history in the United States, the true expansion of Chinese immigration to the United States was with the California Gold Rush in 1848. This gave poor Chinese families the hope and opportunity to raise their families. The rate of immigration was relatively small until 18,000 Chinese came to California in 1852.Hildebrand 1977, p. 7 As they formed communities, they developed their own benevolent societies to support them in their new lives.Hildebrand 1977, p. 7 This gave them a connection to their homeland but it also provided them job opportunities, education, recreation, medical help, and assistance in settling disputes.Hildebrand 1977, p. 7. As Chinese miners began to work in California's mines, tensions began to rise between European and Chinese workers. Similar animus took place once the Chinese began to branch out into other industries.Hildebrand 1977, p. 8. Anti-Chinese sentiment was particularly strong with labor organizations in California. Denis Kearney, an Irish immigrant and one of California's most public anti-Chinese labor leaders, popularized the call of \\"The Chinese Must Go!\\" This rallying cry became increasingly common throughout the American West and was used in the buildup to the Chinese expulsion in Tacoma.Hildebrand 1977, p. 43. As anti- Chinese sentiment became common in California, corresponding incidents of violence and anti-Chinese legislation occurred throughout the state. This included several riots as well as ordinances that set limits on housing and property ownership.Hildebrand 1977, pp. 8-9. Racial animus and new economic opportunities led Chinese immigrants to other territories, moving to other parts of the American West and Pacific Northwest.Hildebrand 1977, p. 9. In the following decades, anti-Chinese sentiment began to be reflected in national policy. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, and the subsequent 1892 Geary Act, were federal laws that targeted Chinese immigrants by barring all new immigration from China. Local sentiment among anti-Chinese activists in the Washington Territory was that this legislation was not being enforced, and that Chinese migrants were entering primarily from British Columbia.Chin 1992, p. 64. Throughout the 1880s, anti-Chinese incidents became increasingly common. On September 4, 1885, the Rock Springs Massacre occurred in Rock Springs, Wyoming Territory and represented one of the deadliest anti-Chinese incidents in the United States during the nineteenth century. A group of coal miners drove out hundreds of Chinese miners and killed at least 28 of them. News of this event spread nationally and internationally and led to increased friction between the Chinese consulate and the United States government.Yung, et. al 2012, pp. 48-54. This would become one of a string of violent incidents directed towards the Chinese population in the Pacific Northwest territories. This violence soon spread to Washington Territory. On September 7, 1885, in Squak Valley (present-day Issaquah, Washington), a group of white and Native American laborers fired into the tents of Chinese hop pickers and killed three of them.Pfaelzer 2007, p. 215. On September 11, 1885, another instance of anti-Chinese violence occurred in the Coal Creek mines of Newcastle, Washington Territory. There, one Chinese miner was kidnapped and the barracks of several dozen Chinese workers was set on fire.Chin 1992, pp. 66-67.Pfaelzer 2007, p. 215. On September 19, 1885 in the coal mining community of Black Diamond, Washington Territory, white miners drove the Chinese out and injured nine of them.Wilcox 1978, pp. 205-206.Chin 1992, p. 67. These events spurred a flurry of organizing activity devoted to expelling the Chinese from other communities in the Washington Territory.  Growing anti-Chinese sentiment in Tacoma  Jacob Weisbach, the mayor of Tacoma during the Chinese expulsion, was a central figure in the anti-Chinese movement in Tacoma. In February 1885, Tacoma Mayor Jacob Weisbach (a German immigrant) met with a small group of men to discuss the Chinese question. William Christie, who had witnessed the Chinese expulsion that had recently occurred in Eureka, California, was among the attendees.Morgan 1979, p. 222.Hunt 1916, p. 359. During this meeting, they discussed the actions taken by other localities to expel their Chinese citizens and considered how they might do the same in Tacoma. This was one of the earliest recorded instances of Tacoma citizens meeting to discuss taking direct action to expel Chinese residents.Morgan 1979, p. 222.Hunt 1916, p. 359. On February 21, 1885, Mayor Weisbach called a mass meeting at the Alpha Opera House to discuss methods of expelling the Chinese population of Tacoma. Roughly 900 of Tacoma's 6,936 total citizens came to the meeting. The crowd was mostly male and white, and the crowd represented nearly half of the town's electorate.Morgan 1979, p. 222. A former alderman, J. E. Burns, suggested passing sanitation laws to enable the city to evict Chinese residents and burn down Chinese homes.Morgan 1979, p. 223. Reverend J. A. Ward suggested that white property owners cease selling and leasing property to the Chinese community.Morgan 1979, p. 223. Weisbach roused the crowd with a closing speech, stating: \\"If the people are in earnest, if they are Free Americans in fact they will not yield up their homes and business to the filthy horde.\\"Morgan 1979, p. 223. The crowd adopted a resolution to exclude Chinese people from Tacoma and discourage citizens from employing any Chinese people. The resolution stipulated that any citizen who did not boycott Chinese employment would have their name published.Morgan 1979, pp. 223-224. Herbert Hunt stated that during 1885, \\"the discussion of the [Chinese] question was constant and it figured in many business and social affairs.\\"Hunt 1916, p. 361. Many groups formed in 1885 in Tacoma with the express goal of expelling the Chinese community.Morgan 1979, pp. 225-226. On September 7 of 1885, a Tacoma chapter of the Knights of Labor was formed, which helped to increase hostility against Chinese residents.Chin 1992, p. 66. The Tacoma City Council also tried to pursue expulsion through legal means, by making residence in Tacoma more difficult for the Chinese community.Hildebrand 1977, pp. 39-40. The council passed an ordinance at the recommendation of Mayor Weisbach stating that all sleeping rooms needed to have 500 cubic feet of air per individual.Hunt 1916, p. 363.Hildebrand 1977, pp. 39-40. On September 28, 1885, an \\"Anti-Chinese Congress\\" met in Seattle. Tacoma's Mayor Weisbach presided over the congress, which proclaimed that all Chinese people must leave Western Washington by November 1 of that year. The congress planned for \\"ouster committees\\" to notify the Chinese residents in the communities assembled of the expulsion date.Wilcox 1978, p. 206. A meeting was held at the Alpha Opera House in Tacoma on October 3 to elect the Tacoma \\"ouster committee,\\" which would later become known as the Committee of Fifteen.Morgan 1979, pp. 229-230. Following the meeting, members of this committee alerted members of Tacoma's Chinese community that they had to leave the city by November 1.Wilcox 1978, p. 206. Other anti-Chinese community members put additional pressure on white Tacomans to fire their Chinese employees.Morgan 1979, pp. 230-231. After this alert, much of the Chinese community left the city, with merchants and some laborers choosing to remain behind. Some members of the Tacoma community gave their assurances to Chinese residents that they would be protected and not forced to leave.Morgan 1979, p. 230. A series of events occurred in the days leading up to the expulsion. On October 31, the night prior to the deadline for the Chinese residents to leave, a final rally was held. Nearly 700 people came to show support for the expulsion.Hunt 1916, p. 371.Morgan 1979, p. 236. As the November 1st deadline approached, an additional 150 Chinese people left the city, leaving roughly 200 Chinese people in Tacoma. The following day, November 2, those accused in the Squak Valley massacre were acquitted, leading to a feeling that those involved in anti-Chinese actions could act with relative impunity.Morgan 1979, p. 236.  Expulsion and destruction of Chinese community  On the morning of November 3 at 9:30 AM, 200 to 300 white citizens of Tacoma gathered on Pacific Avenue.Morgan 1979, p. 237. The mob had shortly thereafter grown to nearly 500 people.Pfaelzer 2007, 219. The mob marched from Seventeenth Street to Old Tacoma, stopping at each Chinese residence and business to tell the people within to pack and be ready for a wagon to come at 1:30 PM that day to take them away.Morgan 1979, pp. 237-238. They visited the homes and businesses of white citizens who had refused to fire their Chinese employees, delivering their message to them as well.Morgan 1979, p. 239. The mob acted methodically and militaristically in their action to expel the Chinese population of Tacoma, and many of the men were armed with either guns or clubs.Pfaelzer 2007, p. 219. The expulsion was often violent. Lum May, a prominent merchant who had been in Tacoma since 1875, reported in a later deposition that the mob \\"broke forcibly into the houses, smashing in doors and breaking in windows.\\"Pfaelzer 2007, p. 221. The wife of Lum May refused to leave and was dragged by members of the mob out of her house. May reported that: \\"From the excitement, the fright, and the losses we sustained through the riot she lost her reason. She was hopelessly insane and attacked people with a hatchet or any other weapon if not watched...She was perfectly sane before the riot.\\"Hildebrand 1977, p. 50. There were only a few instances of resistance to the actions of the mob.Morgan 1979, p. 241. A few Chinese residents sent telegrams to Governor Watson Squire asking for help, but he did not take any action.Morgan 1979, pp. 239-241. Some who may have intervened against the action of the mob later reported a hesitance due to the presence of the mayor, judge, multiple members of the city council, and the fire chief in the mob.Morgan 1979, pp. 239-241.Hildebrand 1977, pp. 50-51. When Lum May appealed to Mayor Weisbach and noted General John W. Sprague's promise of protection for the Chinese community, Weisbach retorted that \\"General Sprague has nothing to say. If he says anything we will hang him or kick him.\\"Morgan 1979, p. 238.Hildebrand 1977, p. 51. At 1:30 PM, 150 to 200 members of the Chinese community were rounded up and forced to march 8 miles to the Lake View train station in a torrential downpour.Morgan 1979, pp. 242-243.Hunt 1916, p. 375.Pfaelzer 2007, pp. 221-222. A select number of Chinese merchants were granted a stay of 48 hours to pack up their business, however, for many this was not honored and they were forced to leave with the rest of the Chinese community.Morgan 1979, p. 242. Upon arriving at Lake View, the expelled Chinese people were forced to buy their own train tickets to Portland.Morgan 1979, p. 243. Those who could not afford tickets rode in the boxcars of a freight train or walked the 140 miles along the rail grade. While waiting for transportation, two men died of exposure.Pfaelzer 2007, p. 222. In the ensuing days, members of the Tacoma community preceded to burn down the city's Chinatown. On November 4, three members of the Committee of Fifteen went to inspect Chinese property along the waterfront, and shortly after their departure the buildings were engulfed in flames.Morgan 1979, p. 245. No attempts were made by the Tacoma Fire Department to save the buildings.Pfaelzer 2007, p. 223. Within four days of the expulsion, all physical memory of Tacoma's Chinese community had been erased by fire.Hildebrand 1977, p. 57.  Aftermath = Local aftermath  The Tacoma 27 were indicted on felony conspiracy charges related to the Chinese expulsion. None of them were ultimately convicted. The headline of the Tacoma Daily Ledger on November 4, the day after the expulsion, read: \\"Gone! Two Hundred Chinese Leave the City ‚Äì How the People's Request was Enforced.\\"Morgan 1979, p. 244. On November 7, a ball was held by Tacoma Turnverein, the city's German society, to celebrate the actions of Mayor Weisbach and the Committee of Fifteen. That same day, Mayor Weisbach, the fire chief, and 25 others who were involved with the expulsion were indicted on felony conspiracy charges. This group would become known as the Tacoma Twenty-Seven. They were escorted to Vancouver, Washington Territory on the morning of November 9.Hildebrand 1977, p. 58. Community members cheered on the 27 as they left, and immediately began raising money for a legal fund.Pfelzer 2007, p. 225.Hildebrand 1977, p. 58. Each member of the Tacoma Twenty-Seven stated that they would plead not guilty.Morgan 1979, p. 248. By the 12th, the 27 had posted bail and returned to Tacoma, where they were greeted with much fanfare.Hildebrand 1977, p. 59. The trial of the 27 had been set for the first Monday of April in 1886.Pfaelzer 2007, p. 225. The trial stalled for a year before the original indictments were dropped on a technicality. The United States Attorney immediately presented evidence for a new trial but only 10 of the original 27 were re-indicted. These indictments were also dropped for procedural reasons. Finally, in 1887, the case was brought before a new grand jury, but in the end, no one was indicted.Morgan 1979, p. 251. The men involved in the Chinese expulsion had become local heroes and would go on to dominate city politics for years afterwards.Hunt 1916, p. 383.Hildebrand 1977, p. 59.  US government and Chinese consulate  The Chinese consulates in San Francisco and Washington D.C. were in contact with Washington Territory officials and representatives of the federal government throughout 1885. In September, Frederick Bee, representing San Francisco's Chinese consulate, exchanged messages with Governor Watson Squire over the safety of the territory's Chinese residents. Bee noted that \\"Complaints are made to this consulate from your Territory that evil-disposed persons have attacked and wounded several Chinese residents, and that further violence is threatened; that, in fact, the Chinese are to be expelled from the Territory.\\"Hildebrand 1977, p. 43. Squire assured Bee that Washington officials would be vigilant about future actions. Immediately following the expulsion, Chinese consulates in Washington D.C. and San Francisco pursued legal avenues to ensuring a just resolution. On Yang Ming, the consul general in San Francisco, messaged Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard and noted that \\"Several hundred Chinese driven from Tacoma...No effort made by the governor or authorities to protect them. Prompt action must be taken, or the same outrage will be enacted all over the Territory.\\"Pfaelzer 2007, p. 223. The Chinese consulate continued to make the argument that the expulsion and related acts of anti-Chinese violence were a direct violation of the Burlingame Treaty.Pfaelzer 2007, p. 223. Chinese officials experienced several challenges in working with the administration of United States President Grover Cleveland. President Cleveland reacted to the growing anti- Chinese sentiments by strengthening the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 under the belief that cultural differences and anti-Chinese hostility made the U.S. unsafe for Chinese immigrants.Kennedy, \\"Justice for the Chinese.\\" In turn, the Qing government felt that the U.S. was unable or unwilling to protect Chinese citizens living in America. In August 1886, the Chinese foreign office proposed a new Sino-American treaty be drafted with the U.S. State department.Kennedy, \\"Justice for the Chinese.\\" On October 1, 1888, Congress passed the Scott Act which permanently banned the immigration or return of Chinese laborers to the United States. The Qing government did not recognize the legitimacy of this act.Kennedy, \\"Justice for the Chinese.\\" President Cleveland, concerned about trade relations with China following the Tacoma expulsion and other cases of anti-Chinese violence in the United States, asked Congress to pass legislation to indemnify the Chinese who suffered from riots in the Pacific states and territories. Congress authorized a payment of $276,619.75 on October 19, 1888 to China as compensation for the Tacoma expulsion and other cases of anti-Chinese violence.Pfaelzer 2007, p. 229.Hunt 1916, p. 383.  National response  After the Tacoma expulsion, the Portland, Oregon, newspaper The Oregonian published a piece condemning the actions of Tacoma and comparing the treatment of Chinese in Tacoma to the expulsion of the Jews and Moors from Spain.Morgan 2003, p. 250. The Seattle Chronicle echoed the Oregonian's concern of the treatment of the Chinese in Tacoma, and noted that two Chinese residents who were driven out of Tacoma were British citizens who appealed to the British government for redress.Morgan 2003, p. 250. The Chronicle also stated that Tacoma would not be so proud of their method once its situation became an international incident. Tacoma received criticism from several newspapers on the East Coast, including The New York Times, New York Herald, New York Sun and New York Tribune.Morgan 2003, p. 250. The phrase Tacoma method was coined in the aftermath of the Tacoma expulsion in a piece written by Tacoma resident George Dudley Lawson in California's Overland Monthly.Pfaelzer 2007, p. 219. Lawson's piece attempted to justify the expulsion which he viewed as a boon to Tacoma.  Reconciliation  This custom pavilion is one of the centerpieces of Chinese Reconciliation Park in Tacoma, Washington. Dr. David Murdock moved to Tacoma in 1982 and noticed the lack of Chinese presence in the city. After learning about the 1885 expulsion of Tacoma's Chinese citizens and worried by the lack of recognition of the event, Murdoch submitted a Citizen Suggestion Award Application to the city of Tacoma on August 27, 1991. The statement suggested that \\"since the eviction [of the Chinese populace] was from the Old Town waterfront, it would be appropriate to set aside an area of reconciliation (small park with a Chinese motif) and a monument acknowledging the incident, noting Tacoma's regret and desire to move ahead in unity and respect.\\"Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation 2013, \\"Tacoma Chinese Park.\\" On November 30, 1993, the Tacoma City Council approved resolution number 32415 in order to formally apologize for the Chinese expulsion of 1885. In doing so, the council recognized efforts of local citizens in promoting reconciliation and endorsed the construction of a Chinese commemorative park which would be located at the former national guard site on Commencement Bay. The city council authorized $25,000 to begin the project, and the Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation was founded in spring of 1994 in order to continue the process of reconciliation in the Tacoma community. The centerpiece of the foundation has been the construction of Chinese Reconciliation Park, located on the Ruston Way shoreline. The park is very close to the former Chinese settlement of Little Canton, from which residents were expelled in 1885. The park consists of a waterfront trail, the String of Pearls Bridge, and a custom pavilion that was originally constructed in China.Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation 2013, \\"Tacoma Chinese Park.\\" See also *Anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States *Anti-Chinese violence in Oregon *Anti-Chinese violence in Washington *Chinatown, Tacoma *Chinese Exclusion Act *History of Chinese Americans in the Pacific Northwest *Issaquah riot of 1885 *Rock Springs Massacre *Seattle riot of 1886 *Tacoma, Washington *Watson C.

History The park was planned by the administration of Mayor Osvaldo Cacciatore in 1978. Cacciatore, appointed by Argentina's last military government, envisaged the park as the centerpiece of efforts to revitalize the dilapidated Villa Soldati ward. The mayor opened the contract to develop a theme park for bidding, and awarded the bid to Interama Parks S.A., a company established for the purpose; Alberto Gourdy Allende was chosen as its first managing director. Interama Parks was formed for use of the military that governed Argentina at that time, but also for civilian use. The company contracted the Swiss firm Intamin to supply imported attractions, including mechanical games, roller coasters, facilities, accessories, shopping trolleys, popcorn machines, and the Interama Tower, an observation tower. The amusement area itself is a relatively small facet of the park, which included 75 hectares (188 acres) of green space. Construction and Reaction Skydiver ride. Construction began at the end of 1978. The park was planned on a 120 hectare (296 acre) undeveloped lot located near the Parque Zoofitogeografico (an arboretum), in Villa Soldati. It lay between Belgrano South railway and existing parking lots near Fern√°ndez of Cruz Avenue, and would be adjacent to an existing city park. The construction required the eviction of remote area's slums, as well as numerous, small landowners; some roads required pavement to allow construction machinery access to the site. After the removal of debris and waste, the property was first used as a landfill. A perimeter fence was placed around the site, and work began. One million cubic meters of earth had to be moved to level the site. It was then landscaped with lakes and hills, while the bases of the attractions and a road network were built. Workers began assembling a replica of the Russian mountains. Earth for the hills, now covered in turf, came from the future lakes, still simple depressions in the land. The site was being transformed from a fallow field into a colorful theme park. Special recreation zones (plones) were laid out. James Fowler, a leading geologist, was contracted, as was Richard Battaglia of Disney World. The construction was carried out by an engineering team led by Omar N. V√°zquez. =Observation Tower= The Torre Espacial observation tower. Materials for the observation tower were acquired in Austria shortly after Interama won the bid, and before construction began; it was described as \\"a circular tower with observatory and restaurant...\\" (according to a November 1978 issue of Gente magazine). Work began on the assembly of the tower in May 1980. The first step of the production was to create the holes for the foundation pilings. The piles were created by TREVI, INC. at a cost of US $728,000. Trevi constructed the extensive pilings for the foundations of the following structures: *Vertigorama Roller Coaster (US $2,025,000) - Total Ride Cost: US $10,000,000 *Aerogondolas (Sky Ride) Columns (US $78,000) - Total Ride Cost: US $4,500,000 *Aconcagua Roller Coaster (US $67,000) - Total Ride Cost: US $6,500,000 *Pedestrian bridge of Entrance on Fern√°ndez de la Cruz Avenue (US $16,000) Metal reinforcements for the concrete were placed into the 35 meter (115 foot) deep holes, and these were filled with bentonite, a clay-like mineral, to absorb groundwater. The bentonite was then displaced by the poured concrete. Approximately 10 meters (33 feet) below the piles, the ground was composed of Puelchense, a layer of very hard material typical to the topography of Buenos Aires. 30 pilings were cut off (with the metallic armor visible) to 8 meters (26 feet) below floor level. This area was then filled by solid concrete in which the main columns of the Tower were embedded. This process alone took 6 months. Construction of the metallic structure took another 6 months. While the tower was built, foundations for the anchoring of the tensors that would have to be lowered to the level of 120 meters (394 feet). The tower itself was a self-supporting structure, and did not need external supports until reaching 120 meters. The tensor cables were then attached, using a crane, to the important beams under Platform 1 and the concrete anchorages at the base of the tower. The incomplete structure became an improvised, gigantic Christmas tree for the 1980 holidays. At night, thousands of colored lamps formed illuminated garlands along the steel tensors and a giant star on the roof of platform 2 together with a poster located in one of the sides of the platform 1 in which could be read at the distance: FE. The park since its opening The park was inaugurated as Parque Interama on September 21, 1982. Its sixty attractions included the Aconcagua roller coaster, the Scorpion double giant wheel, Vertigorama double roller coaster (which never opened as not all parts were delivered https://rcdb.com/1506.htm), Aerogondolas (the longest Sky Ride in Latin America), the musical fountain, and a miniature railway circulating around the perimeter of the park. The observation tower reached 208 m (682 ft) upon topping out in 1981, and remained the tallest free-standing structure in Argentina until 2015. Mayor Mauricio Macri and Vice-Mayor Mar√≠a Eugenia Vidal tour the park after its partial reopening in 2010. The park struggled with setbacks from before its opening, The 1980 bankruptcy of the chief stockholder in Interama, Banco Sidesa, delayed the inaugural. Interama's estimated US$100 million in bad debts prompted the administration of Mayor Julio C√©sar Saguier to revoke the lease, and sue Interama, upon the 1983 return of democracy. The park was then renamed as the Parque de la Ciudad (City Park) in December of that year. The park itself failed to attract the 15 million yearly visitors projected by the city. Annual attendance reached 1.1 million in 1985, and declined afterward. The addition of an IMax cinema was later planned, but was ultimately canceled. The park's deteriorating condition led to its closure by Mayor An√≠bal Ibarra in October 2003, and though it was reopened three years later, ongoing safety concerns led to its renewed closure in March 2008 by Mayor Mauricio Macri. Years of litigation culminated in November 2000 in a US$2 billion ruling in favor of Interama and against the city for a breach of contract stemming from the 1983 lease rescission. Appeals filed by the city ultimately resulted in the ruling's reversal in 2007, however. The park was reopened for the nation's Bicentennial in May 2010; amid ongoing refurbishment and replacement of inoperable rides, the reopening included the addition of a cultural center and art gallery. Mayor Macri later established the 180,000 m¬≤ (1.9 million ft¬≤) Ciudad del Rock (Rock City) on the grounds of the former amusement park in 2013; the venue was built to host events organized by Quilmes Rock estimated to draw over 50,000 spectators. The project drew criticism from Villa Lugano-area Congressman Alejandro Bodart, who pointed to Macri's decision to collect below-market user fees from Quilmes Rock (180,000 pesos - US$31,000 - per event) as well as the mayor's plan to dismantle the park's abandoned rides. The defunct amusement park was chosen by city authorities to serve as the main location for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics. The bidding process was thus announced on March 27, 2014, for the construction an olympic village with 1,440 apartments to house athletes and staff, as well as numerous venues for the games themselves, including the Predio Ferial Ol√≠mpico.

It was introduced in 1992 to replace Tasmania's old \\"High School Certificate\\", and partially restructured for 2007. Patterns of Study The majority of students undertake TCE-related courses over the final two years of school (out of six years of high school), however it is possible to undertake different study patterns over different time periods or through different teaching organisations. These two years are normally completed either at separate campuses of Tasmanian independent schools, or at government colleges. The onus of TCE education is the promotion of independent learning for students, with the aim of equipping students to be able to learn independently of guided education. It is felt this is better preparation for higher education. Available Courses The courses offered for study within the TCE are divided into categories according to the relevant knowledge types or skills. These reflect the nature of the subject and are similar to the way universities allocate areas of study according to faculty. These are: Arts, English, Health & Physical Education, Information Technology, Languages, Mathematics, Science, Society and Environment, Student-Directed Inquiry, Technology and Manufacturing Studies. The following is the complete list of TCE Courses available to students by area of study. Arts *Arts Applied (This course enables students to apply art in a practical way such as concerts, creating film, media publication, or recorded production). *Performing Arts (Including Audio Design, Dance, Drama, Media Production & Music). *Visual Arts (Art Appreciation, Visual Arts and Media, & Art Production). English The study of English at TCE level is divided up into specialist sub-categories, including: English, English Applied, English Communications, English Studies, English Writing, English as a Second Language, Communicating with the Deaf, & Study Material (the study of previous examinations and course work). Health & Physical Education Health and Physical Education is divided up into specialist sub-categories including: Adventure education, Athlete Development, Health, Recreation and Health, Sport studies & Sport Science. Information Technology Information Technology consists of Computer Science, Computing and Information Systems. Languages Several languages are offered for study within the TCE and focus tends to be on languages of countries which have significant trade status with Australia, or large numbers of international speakers. The main languages included are: Chinese, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, & Japanese, although several others, particularly those of Australian ethnic minority groups can also be studied. Mathematics The study of mathematics at TCE level is offered at varying levels of complexity, ranging from maths for every day living skills, through to complex equations. The subjects within the field of mathematics are: Mathematics Applied, Mathematics Methods, Mathematics Specialised, Maths after College, Maths at Work, Maths for Living & Study Material (the study of previous examinations and course work). Science The following sciences can be studied towards a TCE qualification: Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, Physics, Science of Natural Resources, & Science of the Physical World. Society and Environment Society and Environment focuses on subjects which apply skills to the understanding of human interactions with each other, and the environment around them, including: Psychology, Sociology, Economics, Religion & Philosophy, Legal Studies, Ancient Civilisations, Modern World History, Geography, and World & Environment. Student-Directed Inquiry This is an experimental area of study that the TCE has offered on a trial basis in 2006 and 2007 and encourages students to develop their own learning designs and research approaches. It is very much focused on allowing students to develop an academic approach to learning within an area of personal interest, and offers the freedom to approach the gathering of knowledge, research or skill acquisition through their own initiative. Technology Many areas of technical skills can be studied through the TCE including: Applied Technology, Automotive Technology, Catering, Computer Graphics and Design, Design Graphics, Design in Metal, Design in Wood, Electronics, Food Studies, Housing and Design & Lifestyle and Fashion. Manufacturing Studies Manufacturing studies is another new pilot area of study in 2007, and is designed to equip students with knowledge and skills related to the manufacturing industries, which are currently the second largest industry sector in Australia. Assessment The Tasmanian Certificate of Education is awarded based upon a criterion based assessment. This basically means students can be assessed depending upon their meeting or successful completion of standards and criteria. These criteria usually assess knowledge, skills and competencies in differing ways to ensure a wide understanding of the course syllabus has been obtained by the student. It is felt that this is fair and more practical that just relying upon traditional examinations, although many areas of study still utilise exams in conjunction with other methods of assessment. Subjects are offered at varying levels of difficulty, ranging from a basic understanding, through to a pre-tertiary entrance qualification. The difficulty of a subject is guided by its rating as a 1-3 level subject. Subjects are also given an A, B or C rating based on the number of hours that are required for the course, C being the longest. In this way, all subjects will have a rating such as 3A, or 2C etc., depending on the time it involves and the difficulty of the work involved. C level subjects can also be offered as pre-tertiary (level 3C), and for students wishing to gain university entrance, enough points from pre-tertiary entrance subjects must be obtained to gain a Tertiary Entrance Rank (TER) score above the requirements for the applied course. Award Upon successful completion of a satisfactory pattern of study students are awarded the \\"Tasmanian Certificate of Education\\" (TCE) by way of a testamur. This may also come with a Tertiary Entrance Rank (TER) if the student has nominated to attempt a university entrance qualification, and the TER score will dictate which university courses the student is eligible to apply for.

The bureau was inaugurated to conduct a national debate on the political future of Nigeria, and was charged amongst other things to \\"Review Nigeria‚Äôs political history and identify the basic problems which have led to our failure in the past and suggest ways of resolving and coping with these problems.\\" The exercise was the broadest political consultation conduced in Nigerian history. Before the establishment of the bureau, Nigeria had undergone two major democratic constitutions: the First Nigerian Republic and the Second Nigerian Republic, both replete with institutional failures and overthrown by the military. During the bureau's tenure, it received over 27,000 submissions from Nigerians all over the country, on issues ranging from religion, to ethnicity and ideology. In March 1987, the bureau submitted its final report to the military government of General Babangida with recommendations.Stephen Wright; Nigeria: Struggle for Stability and Status, Westview Press, 1998, pp 83-85. However, the political bureau was seen by some critics as an endeavour to legitimize the military's incursion into politics by basing some of its existence to a return to democratic rule such as open debates and finalizing a return to democracy. In 1987, Newswatch magazine released an unofficial report of the bureau, for its reward, it was proscribed for a few months lending credence to some of the criticisms of the regime, as taking Nigerian on a farcical democratic experiment.Cameron Duodu, \\"Silence is tarnished - The continuing repression faced by Nigeria's Newswatch\\", The Guardian (London), 20 April 1987.

Some rejected recommendations *A unicameral legislature *Rejection of the zoning principle *Five-year single term for the presidency *Democratization of socio-economic power through political and economic participation in all structures and organisations of power, leading to a socialist state Babangida and Nigerian intellectuals The formation of the political bureau was a significant event for many reasons. The composition of the bureau could hardly be faulted as it included men and women of character and learning; it also served as an early move for Babangida to co-opt, cultivate and involve intellectuals in the elaborate Transition to civil rule Programme. In preparation, Babangida released political detainees, repealed the Decree 4 of 1984 and promised to respect fundamental human rights. Within two years of seizing power, Babangida had the support of a large swathe of the country; there were few dissensions. Eventually, when General Babangida's intentions started to become obvious to discerning members of the bureau, only a few of the members took decisive action after what was perceived as a relapse to the military authoritarian tendencies experienced under General Muhammadu Buhari. Edwin Madunagu, a prominent journalist of the liberal newspaper The Guardian, was dropped from the bureau for \\"extremist\\" and \\"uncooperative\\" views and attitudes. He would later release an unofficial bureau report via Newswatch, Madunagu was then threatened and intimidated by the secret police. Professor Sam E. Oyovbaire served as special adviser to Admiral Augustus Aikhomu (Aikhomu became Babangida's deputy in October 1986, after fall out with Commodore Ebitu Ukiwe) engaged in rationalising the regime's political programme. Oyovbaire extolled the virtues of the Transition Programme, the National Electoral Commission (NEC), MAMSER (Mass Mobilisation for Self-Reliance Social Justice, and Economic Recovery), SAP (Structural Adjustment Programme - the \\"home-grown\\" version implemented by the Babangida regime without the standby facility of the International Monetary Fund). In February 2002, Oyovbaire, along with Chidi Amuta, wrote in defence of Babangida's programmes. By 2002, Oyovbaire could be read defending Babangida's regime: \\"The socio-economic reforms of the IBB regime created the enabling environment for a generation of Nigerian professionals who were self- reliant, confident and challenged to break new grounds in the Nigerian political economy.\\" and presented Babangida's regime as the \\"... architect and founder of the process of modernization of the Nigerian political economy...\\" Regarding the \\"missing\\" $12.2 Billion Gulf War oil windfall, Oyovbaaire wrote: \\"The IBB regime did what it had to do with the dedicated funds. Therefore, the divergence of opinions between the Okigbo committee and the IBB regime on this matter was essentially conceptual and not substantive.\\" These above appear to confirm the reading of public commentators, including intellectuals and academics, of the success of Babangida's patronage politics. The creation of several programmes maintained a steady income for many academics, even as the programs were rife with the corruption that marked Babangida's regime as exceptional. Members of the political bureau were promised active roles in the implementation of their recommendations; personal loyalty developed as a matter of course. In reference to the Transition Program of General Babangida, Prof. Adebayo Willians in \\"Intellectuals and the crisis of democratization in Nigeria: Towards a theory of postcolonial anomie\\" wrote: \\"A substantial faction of the intellectual class is implicated in this democratic debacle, and its behaviour provides rich insights into the dynamics of intellectual affiliations in a neopatrimonial military state.\\" By 2010, Oyovbaire had become coordinator for the activities of PDP presidential aspirant, Abubakar Atiku. Oyovbaire has also co-authored a book \\"Portrait of a New Nigeria Leader: Selected Speeches of IBB\\" (Tunji Olagunju and Sam Oyovabaire). In the preface, Adele Jinadu wrote: \\"President Babangida's enunciation of human rights as a cardinal aspect of his regime is not merely accidental or an opportunistic rationalisation to take advantage of the opprobrium in which the Buhari regime was held and thereby win popular acclaim. Rather it runs deep in his liberal and populist convictions and is based on a reasoned and well- thought out conceptualisation of the military role in African politics\\". Jinadu, another Nigerian intellectual, appears blind to - as Williams would write - the \\"unprecedented and well-documented assault on human rights by the Babangida government\\". In 2010, when Babangida had again nursed the ambition of contesting for the presidency, Professor Oyovbaire had been named as his \\"Director of Policy and Strategy\\". In December 2010, when Badangida had been ruled out of the 2011 elections, Oyovbaire had been reported as the head of the Abubakar Atiku campaign for the presidency in the South-South; this followed the \\"harmonization process of the Babangida, Gusau, Atiku and Saraki Campaign Teams in the South-South following the adoption of Atiku Abubakar as the consensus Candidate by the Ciroma led wise men from the North ...\\".\\"PRESS RELEASE: Prof Sam Oyovbaire heads Atiku campaign in S‚ÄôSouth\\", African Herald Express, 21 December 2010. Oyovbaire's high opinion of Babangida could be contrasted with the assessment of two other scholars. In the assessment of Rotimi and Julius Ihonvbere: \\"Babangida‚Äôs Character... left much to be desired.

The three panels are entitled, respectively \\"Packing Up\\", \\"On the Wharf\\", and \\"The Collision\\". The Seattle riot of 1886 occurred on February 6‚Äì9, 1886, in Seattle, Washington, amidst rising anti-Chinese sentiment caused by intense labor competition and in the context of an ongoing struggle between labor and capital in the Western United States. The dispute arose when a mob affiliated with a local Knights of Labor chapter formed small committees to carry out a forcible expulsion of all Chinese from the city. Violence erupted between the Knights of Labor rioters and federal troops ordered in by President Grover Cleveland. The incident resulted in the removal of over 200 Chinese civilians from Seattle and left two militia men and three rioters seriously injured.Many sources, like Laurie (cited), agree that around 200 Chinese left by ship on the morning of the 7th. Some sources, such as Crowley (cited), say that most of the remaining 150 also left later. Background During the 1840s, the California Gold Rush brought many Chinese to the United States. Many had come in the hopes of improving their economic conditions, and their arrival was initially welcomed due to labor shortages. According to information from the U.S. Census, the Chinese population increased at a dramatic pace until 1890, though they never accounted for more than 0.2 percent of the U.S. population through the 1800s. After the Gold Rush, many Chinese people moved into the northwest territories of Oregon, Washington, and Montana in search of work, especially with the new mining opportunities and railroad expansion. The Chinese workers developed a reputation for being efficient and willing to work long hours, but also for accepting less pay than white workers. This increased racial tensions in the West, as companies recruited Chinese workers in order to undercut higher-paid white workers. Violent outbreaks against the Chinese occurred as early as the 1860s and continued to intensify in the 1870s, especially in California. As corporations continued to flood the labor market with Chinese workers, many Chinese were excluded from or refused to join unions in the fight against capital, which angered and threatened the white European immigrants who constituted these organizations. Unions such as the Knights of Labor and the American Federation of Labor supported legislation that limited or excluded Chinese immigration. By the mid-1880s, a wave of anti-Chinese violence grew and spread into the Pacific Northwest. Rock Springs Rock Springs was just the first outbreak of many in the West of anti-Chinese violence. It occurred in Rock Springs, in the Wyoming Territory. In the 1870s, the Union Pacific coal mines began firing white strikers and replacing its previously all-white work force with cheaper Chinese laborers. The incident occurred on September 2, 1885. Fighting broke out in the mines between white and Chinese laborers. A mob destroyed and set aflame many Chinese homes, causing an estimated $140,000 of damage, killing 28, injuring 14, and sending the remaining immigrants fleeing into the surrounding area. Later, Governor Francis Warren telegraphed President Cleveland requesting federal military assistance, due to a report that had surfaced that the Chinese, who had fled the town earlier, had now regrouped in nearby Evanston and had armed themselves. The Chinese and anti-Chinese mobs were set to meet, which prompted the commitment of federal troops to Rock Springs. The soldiers were not under orders to protect the Union Pacific Railroad or to protect the Chinese, as required by the Burlingame Treaty of 1868 with China. Officially, troops were deployed to Rock Springs to \\"prevent any disruption to the United States mail or the routes over which they are received.\\" This decision was likely made to avoid setting the precedent of committing federal troops to stamp out anti-Chinese violence, which the Army lacked the resources, time, and numbers to achieve. Eventually, diplomatic pressure from the Burlingame Treaty prompted President Cleveland to issue a new order to protect Chinese laborers \\"at points of threatened or actual violence\\" now that troops had been committed. The Chinese were then led by four companies of federal troops into the town without incident. This set a precedent for sending federal troops to protect the Chinese immigrants from frequent violence in the area, though the Cleveland administration evaded responsibility for the incident. It also set a precedent because not a single rioter was punished. They did pay a sum of $150,000 to the Chinese government, though never to the immigrants themselves. Federal forces remained in the area for another 14 years after the massacre, and, for the most part, white and union influence disappeared in the wake of the riot. An illustration of the massacre of the Chinese at Rock Springs, Wyoming from Harper's Weekly Vol.29, 1885. Seattle Tensions in Seattle continued to rise when the Chinese laborers shifted from mining and railroad construction to urban labor. Many whites felt as though the Chinese were driving them from the labor force by agreeing to work for less. They saw the Chinese as racially inferior \\"semislaves\\" who were unable to assimilate into the American way of life. Some argued that the hiring of Chinese workers would only serve to lower the standard of living for the average American working man in the West, who would be forced to accept lower wages to compete. Others asserted that the Chinese workers were stripping America of her wealth because many immigrants sent paychecks back to their families in China. Members of the Knights of Labor were leaders of the organized movement against Chinese workers in Seattle.\\"Lesson Fifteen: Industrialization, Class, and Race: Chinese and the Anti-Chinese Movement in the Late 19th-Century Northwest\\", History of Washington State & the Pacific Northwest, Center for Study of the Pacific Northwest, University of Washington. Retrieved 20 March 2007. The Knights in Washington Territory were only loosely affiliated with the national organization. The chapter's organizer was Daniel Cronin, a 38-year-old carpenter who came to the Puget Sound area via California during the summer of 1885. Under Cronin's leadership, the Washington Knights of Labor went from a loose-knit band of workers to an organized and militant \\"brotherhood\\". In September 1885, Cronin warned Seattle's workers that riot and bloodshed would follow during the winter if the Chinese were not removed. It was Cronin and the leadership of the Knights of Labor who planned for the systematic expulsion of Seattle's Chinese; the group organized a territorial anti-Chinese congress and declared that all Chinese must leave Seattle by November 1, 1885.Schwantes, Carlos A. \\" Protest in a Promised Land: Unemployment, Disinheritance, and the Origin of Labor Militancy in the Pacific Northwest, 1885-1886,\\" (JSTOR), The Western Historical Quarterly, Vol. 13, No. 4. (Oct., 1982), pp. 373‚Äì390. Retrieved 20 March 2007. After forming local coordinating committees, Cronin stepped away from his post as Knights leader and left the Chinese expulsion, largely, to other individuals. Disgruntled over the presence of 3000+ Chinese immigrants in the Seattle-Tacoma corridor, the Washington Knights organized a meeting on the 28th of September. The meeting was presided over by Tacoma's mayor, Jacob Weisbach, and the assembled men concluded they must rid the area of \\"Chinese slave labor\\". They intended to speak to employers about their discharge, and thus formed local committees to enforce the expulsion if all Chinese were not removed from the town by November 1. Some Chinese were persuaded to evacuate at this point and between November 4‚Äì14, some 150 Chinese fled Seattle. This prompted territorial Governor Watson Squire to telegraph President Cleveland for troops, and he received soldiers under the command of Brig. Gen. John Gibbon by train the next morning. These soldiers never took action and were ordered back to garrison on November 17. The tensions did not end there, however, as Knights of Labor meetings continued through January. On February 6, 1886, the Knights again met and charged a six-man committee with delivering an ultimatum to the Chinese that they must leave Seattle or be forcibly removed. Riot On the morning of February 7, many \\"committees\\" forced their way into Chinese homes, demanding the Chinese pack their bags and report to the steamship Queen of the Pacific at 1pm. The committees set up wagons through Seattle's Chinatown to haul baggage down to the pier. After a search was conducted for Chinese who fled or hid, the committees led some 350 Chinese from Chinatown to the pier. Local Sheriff John McGraw was aroused to enforce law and order with his force of deputies, but McGraw was sympathetic to the plight of the Knights and simply protected the Chinese immigrants from violence on their way to the pier. When Governor Squire ordered the dispersal of the mob and the release of the Chinese, the riotous mob ignored him. Thus, Squire called for the local \\"Seattle Rifles\\" militia and requested the aid of federal troops to assist McGraw. Meanwhile, at the dock, rioters were significantly short of raising the funds needed to transport 350 people by steamship. Only 97 of 350 Chinese had their fare paid. U.S. Justice Greene heard of the incident through an angered Chinese merchant and issued a writ of habeas corpus which required the captain of the Queen to produce the Chinese in court the next morning. At midnight, McGraw along with local militia blocked two attempts by the mob to lead the remaining 253 Chinese to a train to Tacoma. McGraw defused the situation by ordering the train to leave before the mob could reach it. The next morning, McGraw led the 97 passengers still on the Queen of the Pacific to the territorial court as ordered by Justice Greene. There was an incident along the way as the mob tried to block their progress and 8 Knights leaders were arrested. Once there, Greene informed the Chinese that they had a legal right to remain in the city. Though he promised to protect them, only 16 elected to stay and the rest were escorted back to the ship. By the time they had returned the mob had raised funds for the additional passage of 115 more Chinese and the boat set sail. It was agreed that the remaining 150 Chinese would depart on the steamship George Elder once funds had been raised. News of the agreement failed to spread throughout Seattle. As McGraw, his deputies, and the militiamen tried to lead the Chinese back to their homes, a new mob formed, incensed at the arrest of their leaders. The militiamen clubbed members of the mob with rifle butts when progress was impeded. When members of the mob began to wrest the militia rifles, shots rang out and stopped only after 2 militia men and 3 rioters lay seriously injured. The mob backed off and prepared for another charge when an extra company of militiamen arrived and sent the crowd into a confused state. Once McGraw stated that those responsible for the shooting would be prosecuted, the crowd dispersed. When a third mob threatened the lives of the militiamen who fired upon the crowd, Governor Squire issued martial law. Neither Greene nor Squire believed that McGraw and his combined militia force would be able to enforce martial law in the territory, and federal troops arrived in Seattle on February 10 and found it \\"devoid of traces...of the rioting\\". Squire ended martial law and restored local civil order on February 23. Most troops were recalled, but two companies of troops were left in Seattle for another 4 months after the riot.

Aftermath The increasingly common outbursts of anti-Chinese violence in the 1880s, like that of the Seattle riot, allowed Congress to pass the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act that completely barred the immigration of all Chinese workers into the United States. Congress then voted to extend the ban in 1892 and 1902. This led to a dramatically reduced Chinese population in the U.S. in the 1890s into the 1900s. Those who did leave were restricted from being replaced by other Chinese immigrants. Congress paid $276,619.15 to the Chinese government in compensation for the rioting, but the actual victims never saw any such compensation. Though 13 men were tried in court in relation to the riot, not a single one was ever convicted of a crime. Both Mayor Henry Yesler and Sheriff McGraw were unseated in the following election. Few Chinese remained in the Seattle area following the riot. Many of the Chinese chose to return to China following the wave of racially inspired violence. There was a considerable loss of property because of their forced and hasty expulsion The Qing government could only look to secure indemnities for the Seattle riot, knowing that the guilty parties would likely never be brought to answer for their crimes. This was because federal and territorial authorities had been largely unwilling to assist in declaring martial law and arresting the criminals The Chinese asked the advice of their Consuls in the U.S. and sent additional diplomats to investigate the matter and report back with possible actions. Ouyang Ming, the Chinese Consul-General of San Francisco concluded that the Chinese were not well liked by either the American public or the government. He proposed that the best way to prevent future harm to Chinese citizens was to bar all Chinese emigration to the states, feeling as though only trouble would result if things were left unchanged. Others, such as influential Governor-General Zhang Zhidang, disagreed. He proposed that the Chinese immigration policy remain fluid because of Chinese interests in the United States and it did. Qing officials continued efforts in Washington to combat the unjust restrictions that were placed on Chinese immigrants following the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. The killing of Chinese gradually came to a stop in the years after 1886, however legislation restricting them continued. Protection of current and future Chinese in America proved difficult to achieve Chinese consul Goon Dip, a Chinese businessman, was largely responsible for the 2nd wave of Chinese immigration into Seattle and founded the cradle for Seattle's second Chinatown. Soon Japanese and Filipino immigrants also gravitated to the area because of the area's inexpensive housing and storefronts for their own businesses and restaurants. By the late 1930s, Chinatown was re-established in Seattle as a distinct and proud neighborhood. Many Chinese prospered despite lingering tensions. However, relations again soured after the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan. Many Japanese Americans were rounded up in the spring of 1942 for \\"internment\\" camps throughout World War II. In response to anti-Japanese sentiment, many Chinese Americans in Seattle began distinguishing themselves with \\"I am Chinese\\" badges declaring that they were not Japanese. The area's population continued to diversify following World War II, as an increasing number of Filipinos passed through or settled in the area. This prompted Seattle Mayor William Devin to promote a new name for the neighborhood, the \\"International District,\\" in 1951, though this still rankles some in the Chinese community.

Its payoff at expiration is equal to :(\\\\sigma_{\\\\text{realised}}-K_{\\\\text{vol}})N_{\\\\text{vol}} where: *\\\\sigma_{\\\\text{realised}} is the annualised realised volatility, *K_{\\\\text{vol}} is the volatility strike, and *N_{\\\\text{vol}} is a preagreed notional amount. that is, the holder of a volatility swap receives N_{\\\\text{vol}} for every point by which the underlying's annualised realised volatility \\\\sigma_{\\\\text{realised}} exceeded the delivery price of \\\\sigma_{\\\\text{strike}}, and conversely, pays N_{\\\\text{vol}} for every point the realised volatility falls short of the strike. The underlying is usually a financial instrument with an active or liquid options market, such as foreign exchange, stock indices, or single stocks. Unlike an investment in options, whose volatility exposure is contaminated by its price dependence, these swaps provide pure exposure to volatility alone. This is truly the case only for forward starting volatility swaps. However, once the swap has its asset fixings its mark-to-market value also depends on the current asset price. One can use these instruments to speculate on future volatility levels, to trade the spread between realized and implied volatility, or to hedge the volatility exposure of other positions or businesses. Volatility swaps are more commonly quoted and traded than the very similar but simpler variance swaps, which can be replicated with a linear combination of options and a dynamic position in futures. The difference between the two is convexity: The payoff of a variance swap is linear with variance but convex with volatility. That means, inevitably, a static replication (a buy-and-hold strategy) of a volatility swap is impossible. However, using the variance swap (\\\\Sigma_{T}^{2}) as a hedging instrument and targeting volatility (\\\\Sigma_{T}), volatility can be written as a function of variance: :\\\\Sigma_{T} = a\\\\Sigma_{T}^{2}+b and a and b chosen to minimise the expect expected squared deviation of the two sides: :\\\\text{min} E[(\\\\Sigma_{T} - a\\\\Sigma_{T}^{2}-b)^{2}] then, if the probability of negative realised volatilities is negligible, future volatilities could be assumed to be normal with mean \\\\bar\\\\Sigma and standard deviation \\\\sigma_{\\\\Sigma}: :\\\\Sigma_{T} \\\\sim N(\\\\bar\\\\Sigma, \\\\sigma_{\\\\Sigma}) then the hedging coefficients are: :a=\\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\bar\\\\Sigma + \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{\\\\Sigma}^{2}}{\\\\bar\\\\Sigma}} :b=\\\\frac{\\\\bar\\\\Sigma}{2+\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{\\\\Sigma}^{2}}{\\\\bar\\\\Sigma^2}} See also * Variance swap * Volatility (finance) * Forward volatility ReferencesExternal links * Prepackaged Volatility Plays Category:Derivatives (finance) Category:Swaps (finance) ","title":"Volatility swap"},{"id":"10162449","text":"Mainstockheim is a municipality in the district of Kitzingen in Bavaria in Germany.

It was founded by Anand Kumar, a mathematics teacher, and Abhayanand, the former D.G.P of Bihar. The program selects 30 talented candidates each year from economically underprivileged sections of Indian society and trains them for the JEE. The program is portrayed in the 2019 film, Super 30, starring Hrithik Roshan as Kumar. Kumar, and his school, have been the subject of several smear campaigns, some of which have been carried in Indian media sources. History In 2002, Abhayanand and Anand Kumar started Super 30 with the plan to select 30 talented students from economically impoverished sections who could not afford IIT coaching. These 30 students were then prepared to pass IIT-JEE examinations. Anand Kumar's mother, Jayanti Devi, volunteered to cook for the students while Anand Kumar, Abhayanand, and other teachers tutored them. The students were also provided study materials and lodging for a year free of cost. In the first year of the coaching, 18 out of 30 students made it to IIT. The following year, application numbers soared due to the popularity of the program and written examination was conducted to select 30 students. In 2004, 22 out of 30 students qualified for IIT-JEE, increasing the popularity of the program which attracted even more applications. In 2005, 26 out of 30 students cleared the IIT-JEE exam, while 28 in 2006 - this despite the fact that IIT changed the examination structure. In appreciation of their efforts, Bihar Chief Minister at the time Nitish Kumar congratulated the students with a cash prize of ‚Çπ50,000 each. The following year 28 more students cleared the IIT- JEE, and in 2008, all of the Super 30 students cleared the IIT-JEE, after which Abhayanand quit Super 30 saying \\"the experiment is over.\\" Some of Kumar's former students joined as Super 30 teachers and in 2009 and 2010 all 30 students again qualified the IIT JEE exams. In subsequent years the success rates from the 30 students were: 2011 (24 passed), 2012 (27 passed), 2013 (28 passed), 2014 (27 passed), 2015 (25 passed), and in 2016 (28 passed). In 2017, all Super 30 candidates made it to the IIT-JEE. In 2018, 26 of the 30 students cleared the exam. Awards and recognition Time Magazine included Super 30 in its list of The Best of Asia 2010. The organization also received praise from US President Barack Obama's special envoy Rashad Hussain, who termed it the \\"best\\" institute in the country. Newsweek Magazine included Super 30 in its list of Four Most Innovative Schools in the World. Anand Kumar was awarded the Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Shiksha Puraskar in November 2010, the highest award given by the Bihar state government in the field of education. Smear campaigns On July 23, 2018, an article in Dainik Jagran cited former Super 30 students who said that only three students from the program had passed the IIT JEE exam that year, contrary to Kumar's claim that 26 had passed. The report also claimed that students who sought to enroll in Super 30 were pushed to enroll in another coaching center called Ramanujan Institute of Mathematics, a for-profit coaching institute, on the pretext that Kumar would coach them if they performed well. Furthermore, the article alleged that by asking IIT aspirants to enroll in Ramanuj Institute, Kumar made over ‚Çπ1 crore annually. Former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar and Current Leader of the Opposition in the Bihar Assembly Tejashwi Yadav spoke in favor of Anand Kumar and said that \\"propaganda is being run in media influenced by feudal mindset to discredit and defame Anand Kumar.\\" Former Union Cabinet Minister Shatrughan Sinha has also spoken in Kumar's favor on Twitter. In August 2018, The Hindu reported that Kumar and his school are frequently the focus of faked smear campaigns, and identified the potential sources of the fabricated stories that appeared in the Dainik Jagran newspaper in July. Film Bollywood director Vikas Bahl cast Hrithik Roshan for his film Super 30, which is based on the life and works of Anand Kumar. It theatrically released in India on 12 July 2019 to mixed reviews.

It is best known for registering voters at concerts ‚Äì having signed up 600,000 voters since its launch in 2004. Origins The organization was co-founded in 2004 by Marc Brownstein, bass player for the popular electronic rock band The Disco Biscuits, and his friend Andy Bernstein, author of The Pharmer's Almanac, a series of books about Phish. As of July 2019, Peter Shapiro serves as Chairman of the Board, Bernstein is Executive Director of the organization, and Brownstein is a board member with the title ‚ÄúFounder, Chairman Emeritus.‚Äù Activities Some of HeadCount's higher profile activity includes the release of public service announcements starring Jay-Z and Dave Matthews,Vote Again 2010. Jay-Z, Dave Matthews and Headcount.org. 2010. a compilation album featuring Pearl Jam, Wilco and Phish, and various activities involving board member Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead. HeadCout also has served as the voter registration partner for the March for Our Lives movement, as well as Spotify, Soundcloud, American Eagle Outfitters, and The Grammys. For the 2020 election, the organization registered roughly 400,000 voters, through its work with Ariana Grande, Spotify, YouTuber David Dobrik, and hundreds of other musicians, brands and partners. Although HeadCOunt is largely known for it's on-the-ground work registering voters at concerts, and is a mainstay at festivals like Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza, the Coronavirus pandemic did not stop the organization's momentum. Instead, it had its best election cycle ever. This followed many years of activity combining music, culture and democratic participation. For the Midterm Elections in 2018, HeadCount also rolled out a campaign called \\"The Future is Voting\\" featuring many elements, including an anthem film, a get-out-the-vote tour, and a series of limited edition Levi's Trucker Jackets worn by musicians and social media influencers for National Voter Registration Day. Earlier that year, HeadCount ran the voter registration efforts for March for Our Lives, the organization created by students from Parkland, FL after the mass-shooting at their high school. HeadCount is a founder of National Voter Registration Day and stages a massive social media campaign around it each year. The campaign has featured hundreds of musicians and entertainers posting \\"Register to Vote\\" photos on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, with a link to an online voter registration form. Participants included Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart, Fergie, Russell Simmons and The Black Keys. In 2016 HeadCount partnered with music streaming services Spotifyhttp://pitchfork.com/news/69650-obama-interrupting-everybodys-spotify- listening-today-with-reminder-to-vote/ and Pandora Radiohttp://blog.pandora.com/us/its-national-voter-registration-day-make-sure- youre-registered-with-pandora-and-headcount-org/ to help music fans vote. American Spotify users received a message from President Barack Obama directing them to HeadCount.org for voter information. Pandora ran short HeadCount Get-Out-The-Vote PSA's 750 million times and helped over 10,000 voters register through ads on the app. HeadCount also partnered with Ben & Jerry's to hand out free ice cream on Phish tour to fans that registered or pledged to vote. And for the first time ever, HeadCount registered voters at every stop on Vans Warped Tour.https://huffingtonpost.com/kelly-frazier/vans- warped-tour-goes-bac_b_10604764.html Beyond concerts, HeadCount has a large presence on the Internet. Its blog features updates on \\"music, politics and everything in between,\\"HeadCount blog. and it launched a platform called #SoundOff (www.SoundOffatCongress.org) for Tweeting directly at members of Congress. In 2008 HeadCount produced the documentary A Call to Action,http://www.jambase.com/article/trey-weir-call-to-action which has aired on cable television. In early 2012 HeadCount conceived and produced \\"The Bridge Session\\" a live performance from Bob Weir's TRI Studios featuring Weir, members of the National and various other guests. A live webcast on Yahoo! also featured a roundtable political discussion. The collaborations in that session led to Day of the Dead and Blue Mountain. The non-profit also runs the \\"Capitol Community\\" program for the Capitol Theatre (Port Chester, New York), which sends school teachers to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum for curriculum training. Participation Row HeadCount manages Participation Row activism villages at various music festivals including Lockn' (2013, 2014, 2015, 2016) in Arrington, VA, True Music (2013) in Scottsdale, AZ, Phases of the Moon (2014) in Danville, IL, FloydFest (2016) near Floyd, VA the Okeechobee Music & Arts Festival in Okeechobee, FL, The Traveler's Rest Festival in Montana, and Newport Folk Festival and Newport Jazz Festival in Rhose Island. HeadCount also put on a Participation Row for the Dead & Company tours, which was preceded by Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead in both Levi's Stadium and Soldier Field and on Dead & Company's 2016 Summer Tour. Participation Row traditionally hosts 8-16 different non- profits, allowing concert-goers to take actions related to the non-profits. Each Participation Row has also included a silent auction of signed merchandise, with proceeds going to the participating non-profits. At the Fare Thee Well shows, the Participation Row silent auction included a D'Angelico EX-DC electric guitar signed by all 7 performers and played by Bob Weir on stage during the second Santa Clara show. The auction for the guitar closed at $526,000 , making it the 20th most expensive guitar of all time . Structure Since its inception, HeadCount has been largely volunteer- driven. It fields volunteer teams in most major U.S. cities. Each consists of a trained team leader who runs the local operations, and a cadre of volunteers. These teams then set up tables at concerts through which they register voters and disseminate information related to political issues and upcoming elections. This approach has allowed HeadCount to keep its operating costs low while reaching a very large number of people. In any given year, the organization sets up these tables at 500 to 1,500 concerts or more. HeadCount is supported by a Board of Directorshttps://www.headcount.org/board-of- directors/ featuring leaders in the music and political worlds including Republican consultant Gordon Hensley, Cake founding member John McCrea, former interim White House Chief of Staff to U.S. President Barack Obama, Pete Rouse and Grateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir.

With his studio he designed, among others, the Erasmus Bridge in Rotterdam, the Moebius House in the Netherlands, the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany, Arnhem Central Station, the Singapore University of Architecture and Design, Raffles City in Hangzhou and numerous other buildings.  Biography  Ben van Berkel studied architecture at the Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam, and at the Architectural Association in London, receiving the AA Diploma with Honours in 1987.Wolfgang Amsoneit, et al. (1996). Contemporary European architects. p. 170. In 1988 he and his then wife, Caroline Bos, set up an architectural practice in Amsterdam named Van Berkel & Bos Architectuurbureau, which realized, amongst other projects, the Karbouw office building and the Erasmus Bridge in Rotterdam. In 1998 van Berkel and Bos relaunched their practice as UNStudio, where UN stands for \\"United Network\\". Ben van Berkel has lectured and taught at many architectural schools around the world. He has led Diploma Units at the Berlage Institute in Rotterdam (1992-1993) and the Architectural Association in London (1999). Before his role as dean at the St√§delschule in Frankfurt (2001-2016), he was Visiting Professor at Columbia University, Princeton University and Harvard University. In 2011 Ben van Berkel was appointed the Kenzo Tange Chair at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. Central to his teaching is the inclusive approach of architectural works integrating virtual and material organisation and engineering constructions. Ben van Berkel has received many personal awards and affiliations, such as the Eileen Gray Award (1983); the British Council Fellowship (1986); the Charlotte K√∂hler Award (1991); Member of Honor of the Bund Deutscher Architekten (1997); the 1822-Kunstpreis 2003 (Mercedes-Benz Museum, Stuttgart) (2003); the Charles Jencks Award (2007); the Honorary Fellowship AIA (2013); and the Kubus Award (2016).

UNStudio  In 1998 van Berkel and Bos relaunched their practice as UNStudio, the UN standing for \\"United Network\\". UNStudio presents itself as a network of specialists in architecture, urban development and infrastructure. With UNStudio, van Berkel has built several projects, including the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, an LED media fa√ßade (designed with Rogier van der Heide) and interior renovation for the Galleria Department store in Seoul, Korea, and a private villa in up-state New York, the Arnhem Central Station, Canaletto Tower in London and Raffles City in Hangzhou, China. Current projects are Doha Metro Network in Qatar, the Scotts Tower in Singapore, the Hanwha Headquarters in Seoul and ‚ÄòFour‚Äô, a new mixed-use development in the heart of Frankfurt. Publications ;Delinquent Visionaries (1993) In Delinquent Visionaries Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos investigate the changing perspective of architecture. This collection of fifteen essays on subjects ranging from the language and notation of architecture to contemporary architects such as Santiago Calatrava, Daniel Libeskind, Nigel Coates and Bernard Tschumi, is a tribute to the architectural imagination. 'This book should be viewed not so much as a 'visionary' collection of writings, but as a well presented accumulation of thoughts, ideas and observations. As a publication it's formatting and design earnestly corroborates its contents.', according to Deborah Hauptmann in De Architect. ;Mobile Forces (1994) For this book the authors have chosen to employ the very format of the book to elucidate their architectural approach, differentiating four themes that together constitute a modest repertoire of new architectural definitions: Mobile Forces, Crossing Points, Storing the Detail and Corporate Compactness. All projects are headed under one of these categories. In our electronic age the old architectural definitions have lost much relevance; even the building processes themselves are changing, making it necessary to look afresh at the potential meanings of architecture. Presenting such views in conjunction with the projects in this pioneering way, accompanied by two external essays and four essays by the authors, makes this book less a conventional architectural monograph, than a profoundly theoretical statement. ;Museum het Valkhof (1999); The contemporary museum is a mixture of supermarket, temple and tourist attraction. This heterogeneous collection of functions imposes a great diversity of technical and structural requirements. The wide variety of the objects and works of art belonging to the different museological collections reflect the potential heterogeneity of the building. The central question with respect to the architectural design therefore concerns the insertion of a layer of coherence and continuity by way of protective netting and background to the diversity and differentiation. How to fit the extensive programme with the collections, circulation and climatic and lighting installations? And how to tie together these aspects so as to achieve an integrated whole? ;Move (1999) Architects are going to be the fashion designers of the future, dressing events to come and holding up a mirror to the world. The re-thinking of public imagination, public space and public forces transforms architects into public scientists. Their imagination is informed as much by the semi-conscious preoccupations of collective vision, such as glamour, mediation, advertising and celebrity, as by the specifics of the discipline. Architecture must engage with the banal dreams of the contemporary world, and stop presenting its products as uncontaminated objects that say only: 'architecture... Time is on the architect's side [...]‚Äô. MOVE examines the architect's new role in an environment of technological, public and economic change. The redefinition of organizational structures was the common thread running through the original three books. ;UNStudio UNFold (2002) This book documents a number of UNStudio projects and takes critical stock of a welter of previously unpublished designs: the restructuring of the station area in Arnhem, the generating station in Innsbr√ºck, the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) laboratory in Utrecht and the competition-winning design for the Ponte Parodi in Genoa. In this new book UN Studio have draped a personal layer over the analytical project documentation. With texts by Caroline Bos, experiments in associations and out-of-the-rut architectural photography, UNStudio UNFold immerses the reader in the firm's design process. The book appeared simultaneously with the large retrospective exhibition on the work of UNStudio from May 26 to September 29, 2002 in the Netherlands Architecture Institute. ;UNStudio, Design Models (2006) Design Models is the complete monograph of UNStudio‚Äôs output. The book begins with an essay that sets out the principles of their ‚Äòdesign models‚Äô, five conceptual methods that serve as the point of departure for their broad array of project types. Divided by design model, the book's main section presents 00 concepts and buildings, presented in detail: from the initial, generative diagram through the digital-modelling process, to construction and final outcome. Bookending the projects is a second essay, ‚ÄòAfter Image‚Äô, which contemplates the role and representation of contemporary architecture in today's visual and information culture. ;Buy me a Mercedes- Benz (2006); This book about the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany shows how various forms of expert knowledge have been combined and interwoven to finally result in the Mercedes-Benz Museum. It gives an insight into the various ideas, experiences and ambitions behind the project. At its basis was a unique design model: the digitally programmed, three-dimensional, cross- connected trefoil. Implementing this model has resulted in a building that radically breaks with many of today's architectural conventions. The aim of the book is to allow the visitor of the Mercedes-Benz Museum to take the building home; it recreates the experience of visiting the complex, yet strongly directional structure which provides many surprising perceptual experiences. ;Reflections - Small Stuff by UNStudio (2010) Reflections, Small Stuff by UNStudio presents a selection of interiors, installations, pavilions and products from the last 20 years. The 30 projects are organised in pairs which form each other's mirror image, illustrating the idea of reflection and its manifold meanings at literal and symbolic levels. Scattered throughout the book are statements by Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos expressing the thoughts behind each design. These texts bear witness to the theoretical richness and versatility at the basis of UNStudio's highly particular approach to architecture and design. Spaces of Flow (e-book, 2016) The interactive book app Spaces of Flow ‚Äì Arnhem Central Station is a free complementary publication to Knowledge Matters. The first in a planned series of digital publications with a focus on the future of mobility, Spaces of Flow elaborates on the application and production of knowledge in the design and development of Arnhem Central Station. For the first installment, we zoom in on this extensive and complex project, illustrating how the synthesis of external and internal expertise from a network of collaborators and stakeholders created a flow of knowledge that became essential to the success of the project. T Spaces of Flow app features drawings, diagrams, photographs, videos, audio commentary, animations and a detailed timeline narrating the history of Arnhem Central Station Knowledge Matters (2016) Published by Frame Publishers, Knowledge Matters is an exploration into a more agile form of practice - one that is scalable, relevant and opens conversations about the future of the discipline in the context of today's knowledge sharing society. It does so by critically engaging the expanded set of demands now placed upon the profession ‚Äì reframing these demands as the latent potentials of performative architecture in the 21st century. These potentials are explored, realised and speculated upon through the book's 11 ‚ÄòKnowledge Tools‚Äô, with projects often appearing more than once and in various guises.

The contemporary cultural inclination to see innovation as an inherently collaborative effort, a communal, discursive growing and groping towards the new, as consensual and shared, appears to find confirmation throughout history, going back to the Renaissance, looking at Picasso and Braque, the Surrealists, and the radical architecture groups of the 1960s and the early 1970s such as Superstudio and Archigram. So we seek the experiment of working with others, including other architects. What do we have to lose? Instead of being afraid of losing our 'identity', maybe we should be glad; let's liberate ourselves from our brands. ** Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos in: UN Studio - Amsterdam Architect van het jaar, 2007. *Data technology, sensorial technology, artificial intelligence and augmented reality will enable us as architects and designers to create buildings that sense, understand and respond to the needs and behaviors of the people that work and live in them. **Ben van Berkel in: Industry Leaders Magazine, June 2019. *Architects, designers and urban planners need to work alongside innovative developers, city councils and teams of experts from different fields to find and test real life, integral solutions to current challenges in the built environment. **Ben van Berkel in: Industry Leaders Magazine, June 2019.

The gunfire resulted in the death of three Chinese men and the wounding of three others. The attackers were later identified and brought to trial, but all were acquitted. The attack was part of a widespread pattern of racially motivated violence against Chinese immigrants in the United States. During the latter half of the 19th century, there were more than 150 documented group attacks against Chinese communities and settlers throughout North America. Some of the details about what happened in Squak Valley are in dispute. There are brief accounts from two of the Chinese victims of the attack and several statements from those who investigated the crime, but otherwise the remaining information comes from statements made by the individuals who were either on trial or awaiting trial for the murder of the Chinese laborers. Several statements made during the trial directly contradicted the accounts made by others. Undisputed accounts Ingebright and Lars Wold were two brothers who owned a large hops farm in the Squak Valley, about 15 miles east of Seattle, in the 1880s. For several years they had been using local American Indian laborers to the pick hops crop, but in 1885 the market prices for hops were very low. After failing to negotiate lower wages with the Indians, in late August the Wold Brothers contracted with the firm of Quong Chong & Company in Seattle to bring Chinese laborers to pick the hops for a reduced rate. On Saturday afternoon, September 5, a group of thirty-seven Chinese laborers arrived at the Wold Brothers' farm. They pitched their tents in the orchard at the farm. That same night a group of local Squak Valley residents, led by Sam Robertson and DeWitt Rumsey, visited the Chinese and told them they should leave the Valley. They were interrupted by one of the Wold Brothers' workers, who persuaded the local men to go see the Wold Brothers. The local men met with the Wold Brothers and told them that the Chinese must leave, or else the same men would come back and force them to leave. The Wold Brothers told the group to go away and let the Chinese do their work. The group then left and returned to their homes. On Sunday, September 6, news of the Wyoming Rock Springs Massacre of Chinese miners was on the front page of the Seattle newspaper. On Monday, September 7, 1885, at about 4 o'clock, another group of about thirty Chinese started to enter Squak Valley and were met at George W. Tibbetts' store by a group of white men and Indians. The crowd intimidated the arriving Chinese, who turned around and went back the way they came. There are no known reports of who was in the group of men that turned the Chinese away. Somewhere around 10 p.m. that same day, a group of at least five white men and two Indians went to the Chinese camp on the Wold Brother's farm. Several rounds of shots were fired into the tents of the Chinese workers, and at least six Chinese workers were hit by the gunfire. Two, identified as Fung Woey and Mong Gow, died quickly, and another, identified as Yeng San, died the following morning. The remaining three wounded men, named Gong Heng, Ah Jow and Mun Gee, recovered, although Mun Gee was reported to have more permanent injuries. King County Sheriff McGraw and King County Coroner L. B. Dawson conducted an investigation of the shooting the next day. The coroner convened an official inquest to look into the matter, and on Tuesday, September 8, a hearing was held. At the hearing, eleven men testified before a jury of six local residents. Those testifying were: Gong Heng, Joseph Day, I. A. Wold, L. A. Wold, Sam Gustin, M. De Witt Rumsey, J. A. Wold, George W. Tibbetts, William A. Wolf, Perry Bayne, and Sam Robertson. Under oath, Robertson admitted taking part in the shooting and named several others who were there with him. The jury found that the Chinese were killed \\"by gun and pistol wounds initiated by M. DeWitt Rumsey, Joseph Day, Perry Bayne, David Hughes, Samuel Robertson, Indian Curley, Indian Johnny and other persons to us unknown.\\" Two days later a grand jury indicted all of those named by the coroner's jury, except Sam Robertson. The judge gave Roberson immunity in return for his testimony against the others. Prosecuting Attorney J. T. Ronald decided to try Perry Bayne first, since he was implicated by Robertson as the leader of those who did the shooting. On October 28, the trial of Perry Bayne started in Seattle. It lasted a full week. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty after deliberating less than one-half hour. The prosecutor then charged the same seven men, plus George Tibbetts, with inciting a riot. Another trial was held in late November, and all of the defendants were found guilty. They were fined $500 each. The defendants appealed their conviction to the Territorial Supreme Court on the grounds that women had been wrongly included on the grand jury that had handed down the indictments. In January, 1888, the Court agreed with the defendants, saying that the law required all members of grand juries to be qualified voters, and women at that time did not have the right to vote in Washington Territory. All of the convictions were overturned. Disputed information The number of people who went to the Chinese camp on Saturday night and on Monday night was stated by various defendants to have been at least seven and as many as twenty. Everyone who testified was uncertain about the number and exactly who was in the group. At the murder trial, the defendants said that they were just going to tell the Chinese to leave, but when they got to the camp someone in the camp shot at them first. The defendants claimed they returned the fire only in self-defense. The role of the local Indians in the attack is unclear. Several Indians testified that they were present in the group that went to the camp, and two men, identified at Indian Joe and Indian Curley, were indicted for the murder. During Perry Bayne's trial, at least one person testified that the Indians fled when the shooting started. Although Sam Robertson first testified against the other defendants, at the trial the defendants said he was the leader and they went along mainly to keep him from harming the Chinese. Testimony about the number and types of guns supposedly used, and who did or did not use them, varied from person to person.

She is best known for forming the first freedmen's schools (those for newly freed slaves), notably the Penn School.  Early life  Laura Matilda Towne, the daughter of John Towne and Sarah Robinson was born on May 3, 1825 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Education & influences  Laura Towne originally studied medicine when the American Civil War broke out. She was raised in Philadelphia hearing sermons about the abolition of slavery by her minister, William Henry Furness at the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia. Influenced by these teachings, Towne answered the call for volunteers when the Union captured Port Royal and other Sea Islands area of South Carolina. With the help of her Quaker friend Ellen Murray (January 31, 1834 ‚Äì April 7, 1908) they founded the Penn Center on St. Helena Island, the first school for newly freed slaves in the United States. Laura Towne was buried at the Laurel Hill Cemetery, Section, Lot 77 to 80, in Philadelphia.  The Penn Center  The school started with nine students and operated out of the back room of a plantation house. Towne and Murray spent the next forty years of their lives ministering to the freed slaves, developing their trust, providing them with medical care, teaching them to read and write, and fighting for their land rights. Towne and Murray eventually adopted several African American children and raised them as their own. She took care of the school for the rest of her life and eventually gave up practicing medicine. After her death, Penn School was transferred to Hampton Institute, at which time it began operating as the Penn Normal, Industrial, and Agricultural School. Recognized as a National Historic Landmark, the Penn Center trained generations of students, including U.S. Congressman Robert Smalls (1839-1915). During the Civil Rights era the Penn Center served as a training ground for non-violent civil disobedience by welcoming Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.. Now a National Historic Landmark, the Penn Center celebrated 150 years education, leadership and service.

Oil bodies are not considered organelles because they have a single layer membrane and lack the pre-requisite double layer membrane in order to be considered an organelle. They are found in plant parts with high oil content that undergo extreme desiccation as part of their maturation process, and help stabilize the bodies. Oleosins are proteins of 16 kDa to 24 kDa and are composed of three domains: an N-terminal hydrophilic region of variable length (from 30 to 60 residues); a central hydrophobic domain of about 70 residues and a C-terminal amphipathic region of variable length (from 60 to 100 residues). The central hydrophobic domain is proposed to be made up of beta-strand structure and to interact with the lipids. It is the only domain whose sequence is conserved. Models show oleosins having a hairpin-like hydrophobic shape that is inserted inside the triacylglyceride (TAG), while the hydrophilic parts are left outside oil bodies.oleosin Oleosins have been found on oil bodies of seeds, tapetum cells, and pollen but not fruits.

Use in Purification of Recombinant Protein Oleosins provide an easy way of purifying proteins which have been produced recombinantly in plants. If the protein is made as a fusion protein with oleosin and a protease recognition site is incorporated between them, the fusion protein will sit in the membrane of the oil body, which can be easily isolated by centrifugation. The oil droplets can then be mixed with aqueous medium again, and oleosin cleaved from the protein of interest.

As Lady Reading, she was highly active in promoting Anglo-American relations, not only as the wife of a former British Ambassador to the US, but also in her peacetime role helping to rebuild the British economy and find stimulating employment for women ‚Äì both voluntary and paid. In addition to the WVS, she also established Women's Home Industries, a highly successful exponent of British craft and cultural traditions in clothing and textiles, and also a prolific exporter to the United States and Canada. She served on boards of various cultural bodies, including the BBC Advisory Board and Glyndebourne, and was a keen early supporter of University of Sussex. In 1958, she became the first woman to take a seat in the House of Lords in her own right. A 1963 profile in The Observer said: \\"the W.V.S. has brought out in her the latent political talent and the strength of character that once induced someone to say of her that had she been a man she would have become Prime Minister\\". Early life and career Stella Charnaud was born on 6 January 1894 in Constantinople (now Istanbul). Her father Charles Charnaud was a director of the tobacco monopoly of the Ottoman Empire. Her mother Milbah Johnson was from Lincolnshire and was Charnaud's second wife. The family lived on the Asian side of the Bosphorus at Moda. Due to poor health, much of Stella Charnaud's education was via private tutors. A 1963 profile provided more background on her childhood. She was the fifth of nine Charnaud children ‚Äì with four brothers and four sisters ‚Äì and was exactly in the middle. Spinal troubles confined her to bed for \\"months and years\\", but she would later speak of its advantages ‚Äì not least that she became a listening post for her siblings and half siblings. She said: \\"it was like being the spider in the middle of a large web\\". The Observer suggested it had taught her the art of diplomacy. While she would later describe herself as \\"brung up\\", because of her lack of formal education, she combined learning from the local Church of England chaplain with the tutelage of a governess at home. She spoke fluent French and German and some Italian and Greek. Her Times obituary said that during World War I, she worked for the British Red Cross Society, gaining experience that would inform her future work. The Observer profile told her First War history somewhat differently, saying that she joined the Voluntary Aid Detachment ‚Äì then a volunteer nursing group directed by the Red Cross ‚Äì but was demoted to pantry maid because of her tendency to faint at the sight of blood. Charles Charnaud had lost his money during the war and this meant Stella Charnaud looked for employment, initially working in a solicitor's office. Her Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry says she began her training as a secretary in London in 1914, the year that war broke out. In 1925, she was asked to join the Viceroy's staff in Delhi, India. Initially, she served as secretary to Lady Reading, the wife of the Viceroy, Rufus Isaacs, 1st Earl of Reading, but soon rose to become chief of staff to the Viceroy. Later, she worked as his private secretary at Imperial Chemical Industries, of which he was president and at his London home in Curzon Street, Mayfair. Lord and Lady Reading, c. 1935 After Isaacs' wife died in 1930, Charnaud became his political hostess. The couple married on 6 August 1931 ‚Äì he was 71 and she was 37 and The Observer profile noted that this alliance was greeted with \\"universal applause\\". From this point on she became Marchioness of Reading ‚Äì usually addressed as Lady Reading. A biography notes that while the transition from secretary to marchioness and wife of a man twice her age who was also foreign secretary (Rufus Isaacs held this role briefly between August‚ÄìOctober 1931) might have been a formidable challenge for many women, she adapted easily to the role and gained widespread acceptance. In 1932 she became chair of the Personal Service League, a voluntary organization concerned with helping ameliorate poverty during the Great Depression. Anglo-American 'mission' Although Lady Reading's marriage was a brief one ‚Äì Lord Reading died in 1935 ‚Äì it became a driving force in her life and, she said, influenced much of her later work. Her Observer profile described how he told her that after his death she would want to \\"serve the country\\", describing in detail how this could be effected. He also impressed upon her the value of the relationship between the United States and the UK ‚Äì Lord Reading was a former Ambassador to the US ‚Äì suggesting that the future of democracy might depend upon a better understanding of the Americans by the British. After the Marquess' death in 1935, she experienced a period of \\"shock and disorientation\\". This was described in far more detail in the 1963 Observer profile. She immediately travelled to the United States. There she travelled by car across the country, staying in dollar-a-night lodgings and working as a dish-washer in order to understand \\"ordinary\\" Americans. This fact-finding mission was put to an end in somewhat unusual circumstances: \\"Her mission evidently caused some concern about her own well-being. In the end she was stopped on the road by a bewildered State Trooper who said: 'The President wants you to call him'.\\" She returned to Washington D.C. and would remain a close friend thereafter of Eleanor Roosevelt ‚Äì the two shared an interest in alleviating poverty and wrote to each other fortnightly for years after her trip. Early voluntary and social work Even before her husband's death Lady Reading had become active in voluntary social work, chairing the Personal Service League, created to serve the needy and unemployed. She served on the Ullswater Commission on Broadcasting in 1935 as the only female member of the committee (later she would become a member of the BBC Advisory Council). A WVS mobile 'Blitz Canteen' in 1941 ‚Äì the canteens operated across London to provide refreshments to troops and civilians Women's Voluntary Service In 1938, a year before the start of World War II, Home Secretary Samuel Hoare sent for Lady Reading and requested that she establish an organisation of women that would assist the government and local authorities if war were declared. Lady Reading founded the Women's Voluntary Service for Air Raid Precautions Services, later referred to simply as the Women's Voluntary Service or by its initials WVS. The structure was created by her. The WVS recruited women across the country ‚Äì one million by 1942. The approach was to recruit women from all walks of life and avoid excessive bureaucracy or committees. Women wore uniforms, but there was a focus on individual initiative. Duties were wide-ranging, ranging from providing support to the armed services and to refugees, to the evacuation of children, pregnant women and other vulnerable people from cities at risk of bombing. Initially it organised a great many training courses, from driving in the blackout to childcare and \\"train the trainers\\" sessions. In London, courses were taught in many languages, including Italian, Dutch and Yiddish, for foreign nationals in the WVS. On 31 August 1939, with war inevitable, immediate evacuation from cities was ordered, following over a year of preparation; 1.5 million people were evacuated by Isaacs's WVS over the next three days. As the war progressed, the WVS, funded by the government and local authorities, fed, clothed and re-housed civilians affected by air raids. The WVS continued in peacetime; in the immediate post-war period it assisted with the problems caused by shortages of food, fuel and housing. Its transition continued in the years afterwards; in 1963 it still had some 1,200 depots around the country. It remained voluntary and became not just an arm of civil defence but of the welfare state. Women's Home Industries After the war had ended, Lady Reading became involved in another venture designed to assist the nation and engage women's efforts. Women's Home Industries was originally established in 1947 to stimulate women's craftsmanship and earn dollars for Britain. Initially, the WVS collected samples from its membership ‚Äì including tapestry, embroidery, quilting and hand knitting ‚Äì and the response inspired a start-up business supported by the Board of Trade. The company remained under the auspices of the WVS and operated initially from its HQ at 41 Tothill Street, London SW1, but was a limited company. Lady Reading served as chair of the company, as well as the WVS, and it split from the WVS in the 1950s. It remained a highly successful exporter of professionally finished clothing and crafts ‚Äì notably to the United States ‚Äì as well as supplying couture houses, with most suppliers being home-based women. House of Lords The Marchioness was created a life baroness by letters patent on 22 September 1958, one of only four women in the first cohort of fourteen creations.. She took the title Baroness Swanborough, of Swanborough in the County of Sussex to sit on the Crossbenches. Her husband was a Liberal cabinet minister and imperial diplomat, widely regarded and highly respected, but as now she could pursue her own duties. On introduction she was the first female life peer to sit in the Lords.21 October 1958, HL Hansard, cols 661-2. Her maiden speech questioned the government's policy on refugees and displaced persons of whom she had some war experience. She praised the work of the voluntary services, of which she had been a valid member. She urged the Macmillan government to support the work of the UNHCR worldwide. In her speeches she paid particular attention to the plight of stateless children, who for legal reasons were incapable of achieving citizenship.HL Hansard, 20 October 1966, cols 170-2. She chaired the Home Office's Advisory Council (1962-5) that played a leading role in facilitating the \\"Wundrush\\" migration to Britain from the Commonwealth. In 1965 she was appointed the working party on the place of the Voluntary Service in After Care. She referred to the prison system and rights of prisoners on release, how they might be cared for, and what rights and obligations they might have.Who's Who and Who Was Who 2018, 'Reading'; Home Office Report, Report on the Work of the Probation and text Other roles From 1936‚Äì1968, Lady Reading was vice-chair of the Imperial Relations Trust. She was a member of the BBC Advisory Board and vice-chair of its Board of Governors from 1947‚Äì51. She chaired the Home Office Advisory Council on Commonwealth Immigration and led a working party on the after-care of prisoners released from jail. She was also an early supporter of the University of Sussex (founded 1961) and bequeathed her private residence, Swanborough Manor, to be used as the residence of the university's vice chancellor for 50 years after her death. The university sold the manor in 2003James Trollope, The manor of its going, The Daily Telegraph, 15 March 2003 She was also a trustee of Glyndebourne. Public recognition She was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1941, and promoted to Dame Grand Cross (GBE) in 1944. On 22 September 1958, she was created a life peer in her own right, becoming Baroness Swanborough. She was the first woman to take her seat in the House of Lords. She was awarded honorary doctorates by the universities of Reading (1947), Yale (1958), Manitoba (1960) and Leeds (1969), and by Smith College (1956).

Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3422168 or https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3422168 The journal is a general law review that publishes original articles relating to common law jurisdictions and the law of the European Union. In addition, the journal contains sections devoted to recent legislation and reports, to case analysis, to review articles, and to book reviews. The current editor-in-chief (General Editor) is David Kershaw. Previous editors included Lord Chorley, Lord Wedderburn, Hugh Collins, and Julia Black. The contents of the first 59 volumes (published between 1937 and 1996) are freely available online; more recent volumes are available on a subscription basis.  Foundations  The Modern Law Review Ltd. is a charity that was established in 1937 to promote the study of law and related fields. To this end, it publishes the law review and organises lectures and seminars and offers scholarships and awards. In addition, the review provides the funding to host the annual Chorley Lecture.  Chorley Lecture  The annual Chorley Lectures started in 1972 and are named in honour of Robert Chorley, 1st Baron Chorley, the founding editor of the Modern Law Review. The lecture is usually delivered in early June at the London School of Economics and subsequently published as the lead article in the January issue of the following year's volume.  Wedderburn Prize  The annual Wedderburn Prize is awarded for \\"a contribution to that year's volume which in the opinion of the editorial committee is exemplary of the type of scholarship that The Modern Law Review aims to promote\\". It is named in honour of Lord Wedderburn of Charlton, who served as general editor of the review from 1971 to 1988. Preference is given to the work of authors who are at a relatively early stage of their careers. Previous winners of the Wedderburn Prize include Kimberlee Weatherall, David Kershaw, and Nico Krisch.

It is normally applied to quantify drug, disease and trial information to aid efficient drug development, regulatory decisions and rational drug treatment in patients. Pharmacometrics uses models based on pharmacology, physiology and disease for quantitative analysis of interactions between drugs and patients. This involves Systems pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and disease progression with a focus on populations and variability. Mould and Upton provide an overview of basic concepts in population modeling, simulation, and model-based drug development.Mould DR, Upton RN Basic concepts in population modeling, simulation, and model-based drug development CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology September 2012 A major focus of pharmacometrics is to understand variability in drug response. Variability may be predictable (e.g. due to differences in body weight or kidney function) or apparently unpredictable (a reflection of current lack of knowledge).  Types of models = Pharmacokinetics (PK)  Models of pharmacokinetic processes.  Pharmacodynamics (PD)  Models of pharmacodynamic processes.  Physiologically based Pharmacokinetics  Physiologically based pharmacokinetic models  Exposure-response  Exposure-response models describe the relationship between exposure (or pharmacokinetics), response (or pharmacodynamics) for both desired and undesired effects. See also dose- response.  Disease progression  Disease progression models describe the time course of disease and placebo effects. Disease and exposure-response models are used to understand the relationship between treatment, biomarker changes and clinical outcomes.  Trial  Trial models describe variations from the nominal trial protocol due to things such as patient dropout and lack of adherence to the dosing regimen. Organizations Historically, pharmacometrics has been represented in related clinical pharmacology and statistics organizations. A number of smaller local organizations in Europe, United States, and New Zealand/Australia held local meetings. In the early 1990s, The PAGE meeting was organized and has been held yearly since then, although no official organization was present. Ette and Williams have provided a historical context from which the evolution of pharmacometrics can be appreciated. In 2011, the American Society of Pharmacometrics (ASoP) was founded from a number of local American groups, and over 600 members worldwide joined ASoP within 6 months. In 2012, ASoP evolved to the International Society of Pharmacometrics (ISoP) to reflect the increasing number of international members.

All of his siblings died young of tuberculosis. He left school at 13, working for little reward as an office boy and clerk.Aldrich, Robert F. Colonialism and Homosexuality. Page 96. Routledge, 2003. After having been caught stealing money from a gas-mantle works, apparently to help establish himself as something of a literary gentleman, Stuart-Young was arrested and spent six months in prison. He was only 18.Parker, Peter. Poet, pederast and palm oil merchant: review of The Forger's Tale by Stephanie Newell He later spent many years in Africa, in such diverse places as Sierra Leone, Grand Bassa in Liberia, Conakry in French Guinea and later, Onitsha on the Niger River. In Onitsha, he worked as a trader to some measure of success. He would exchange European goods for African materials such as palm-oil, ivory and rubber. Stuart-Young was a strong critic of the work of missionaries.Killam, Gordon Douglas. Africa in English Fiction, 1874-1939. Page 54. Ibadan University Press, 1968 According to Stuart-Young, it was a photograph by Frederick Rolfe of a nude Egyptian boy that awoke in him, a schoolboy of fourteen, a fascination for Africa. He once alleged to have had a relationship, with romantic overtones, with Oscar Wilde. Stuart- Young claimed to have first met him in June 1894 as a teen, while dining at the Savoy. The two visited the Haymarket, seeing Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan.Bristow, Joseph. Wilde Writings: Contextual Conditions. Page 169. University of Toronto Press, 2003. Stuart-Young even forged letters allegedly by Wilde to substantiate this.McKenna, Neil. The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde. Page 310. Basic Books, 2005. Stuart-Young's memoirs of Wilde and the supposed letters were published in his 1905 volume, Osrac, the Self-Sufficient. According to Timothy D'Arch Smith, it is unlikely Stuart-Young had ever met Wilde. D'Arch Smith further states that the love of Stuart-Young's life was an Englishman named Tommy Todd.Smith, Timothy D'Arch. Love in Earnest: Some Notes on the Lives and Writings of the English 'Uranian' Poets from 1889 to 1930. Routledge & K. Paul, 1970. Stuart-Young developed close relationships with several young African houseboys, including a mix-raced, 14-year-old boy named Ibrahim, referred to by Moray-Young as 'the Unkissed', and an 11-year-old named Bosa, whom he later took with him to England. Stuart-Young published dozens of works, including books of poetry, novels, descriptions of African life and autobiographical works. His poems are closely linked to fin-de-si√®cle and Uranian themes, being informed by decadence, colonialism and pederasty. Stuart-Young married twice, both times to English women: Annie Knight in 1908 and Nellie Gibson Etheridge Young in 1919. There is no evidence of a marriage to an African woman, in spite of his 1904 novel about such a union, Merely a Negress: a West African Story. He was given the honorary name of Odeziaku by the Igbo people, which means \\"keeper, caretaker, manager, or arranger of wealth\\". In 1939, Stuart-Young died in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. He was given a lavish funeral by his friends and employees in Africa, where 10,000 Igbo mourners lined the streets for ceremonies which extended over four days. A study of Stuart-Young, entitled the Forger's Tale: the Search for Odeziaku, was published by Stephanie Newell in 2006.

He was portrayed by Rory Cochrane until the character's death in the third season opening episode \\"Lost Son\\".  Characterization  Prior to the character's untimely demise and Rory Cochrane's departure from CSI: Miami at the start of season 3, \\"Speed\\" is distinguished in his occasional carelessness in procedure. Especially featured is his neglect of proper sidearm maintenance \\"Dispo Day\\", which is a contributing factor to Speed's own death. He also, at one point, borrows Calleigh Duquesne's crime light and forgets to recharge it, much to her annoyance. Speed's cavalier attitude is also featured in other ways as well. He states that he sees his job as a CSI as no more than a \\"paycheck\\", lacking the enthusiasm for criminology and justice shared by the rest of the team \\"Wannabe\\". He rides his bike to work, and claims that he's happy with that rather than a standard automobile \\"Lost Son\\". Showcased in the series is his role as best friend to Adam Rodriguez's Eric Delko. This facet of him is evident in episode 604, \\"Bang, Bang, Your Debt,\\" a full three years after Speedle's death \\"Lost Son\\". Delko, still feeling the effects of a head injury suffered (season 5 episode 15 \\"Man Down\\"), suffers from vivid hallucinations of his deceased friend, which ultimately leads to the discovery that Audio- Visual Lab Technician Dan Cooper had stolen Speedle's credit card. This episode, especially with Speedle's appearance therein, illustrates the ongoing trauma of the violent death of a friend (in this case, Speed) on those who were close with that individual. When Cooper claims that, since Speed is dead, no-one got hurt, Calleigh Duquesne angrily points out that Eric is hurt, and so is she, in particular, by the false hope the card charges (coupled with Delko's hallucinations) gave and Cooper is given the ultimatum of turning himself in or Calleigh will press charges herself. Later, \\"Ambush\\", it is revealed that she did not press charges. Character biography Tim Speedle was a Trace and Impressions expert with the Miami-Dade Crime Lab from Jamaica, Queens. In the season 8 opener, it was revealed that he had been recommended to Horatio by Jesse Cardoza who transferred to the LAPD at the time and returned recently, Speedle was working at St. Petersburg PD at the time. Death Speed dies in the Season 3 opening episode, \\"Lost Son\\", after being mortally wounded during a gunfight in a jewelry store. He and Caine brace themselves for a fight, but Speedle's gun jams giving one of the thieves an opportunity to shoot him in the chest. Caine calls for an ambulance, but Speedle succumbs to his injuries before help arrives, dying in Caine's arms. Speedle's death leaves the team, especially Caine and Delko, devastated. Internal Affairs is forced to investigate and Calleigh reports that the gun simply malfunctioned thereby closing the IAB investigation. A funeral is held and his parents and team are shown grieving over his loss. Speedle's position on the team was later taken by Ryan Wolfe, a former Miami-Dade Police Department patrol officer. Legacy During a first-season episode, Speed and Delko, during a night of clubbing on the town, were caught in a devastating and deadly fire when the nightclub bouncer set the building alight in a twisted effort to be a hero. Speedle was instrumental in saving lives when he noticed an emergency-exit door ajar, and he guided many victims to safety. Despite the trauma of the blaze, he insisted on working the scene with the rest of his team (season one, episode 22, \\"Tinder Box\\"). A few months after his death, Sara Piper a.k.a. Cookie Devine, (season 3, episode 18, \\"Game Over\\") fears a sex tape she made with her boyfriend will be leaked. She goes to the lab and ask for Tim Speedle, who had previously helped her (season 2, episode 24, \\"Innocent\\") and Horatio overhears. He steps in and informs her that Speed had been killed in the line of duty but promises to look into her case. Five years after Speedle's death, his memory is still tender in the hearts and minds of his colleagues. They have left his locker and effects intact, intriguing those who come after his demise (episode 6x04, \\"Bang, Bang, Your Debt\\").

Unlike the apparent color of a mineral, which for most minerals can vary considerably, the trail of finely ground powder generally has a more consistent characteristic color, and is thus an important diagnostic tool in mineral identification. If no streak seems to be made, the mineral's streak is said to be white or colorless. Streak is particularly important as a diagnostic for opaque and colored materials. It is less useful for silicate minerals, most of which have a white streak or are too hard to powder easily. The apparent color of a mineral can vary widely because of trace impurities or a disturbed macroscopic crystal structure. Small amounts of an impurity that strongly absorbs a particular wavelength can radically change the wavelengths of light that are reflected by the specimen, and thus change the apparent color. However, when the specimen is dragged to produce a streak, it is broken into randomly oriented microscopic crystals, and small impurities do not greatly affect the absorption of light. The surface across which the mineral is dragged is called a \\"streak plate\\", and is generally made of unglazed porcelain tile. In the absence of a streak plate, the unglazed underside of a porcelain bowl or vase or the back of a glazed tile will work. Sometimes a streak is more easily or accurately described by comparing it with the \\"streak\\" made by another streak plate. Because the trail left behind results from the mineral being crushed into powder, a streak can only be made of minerals softer than the streak plate, around 7 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. For harder minerals, the color of the powder can be determined by filing or crushing with a hammer a small sample, which is then usually rubbed on a streak plate. Most minerals that are harder have an unhelpful white streak. Some minerals leave a streak similar to their natural color, such as cinnabar and lazurite. Other minerals leave surprising colors, such as fluorite, which always has a white streak, although it can appear in purple, blue, yellow, or green crystals. Hematite, which is black in appearance, leaves a red streak which accounts for its name, which comes from the Greek word \\"haima\\", meaning \\"blood.\\" Galena, which can be similar in appearance to hematite, is easily distinguished by its gray streak.

In 2017, over 30 years after it was first launched, ITV announced that 'The Big Fight Live' would return after it was announced Chris Eubank JR would fight for the world title on ITV Box Office. History ITV's boxing coverage had largely been confined to big fights from the USA in the 1970s and early 80s, which were covered as part of World of Sport and as separate programmes. Until 1984, they were largely shut out of British domestic boxing due to a cartel operated by promoters such as Jarvis Astaire, Harry Levene and Mickey Duff, who had contracts with the BBC. ITV obtained the rights to show fights promoted by then-rebel promoter Frank Warren's Sports Network in 1984. Several years later, a contract with Barry Hearn followed as a result of his friendship with Greg Dyke, while the network also worked closely with other promoters including Don King. Until the early 1990s, the programmes were titled Boxing, World Championship Boxing, \\"The Big Fight Live\\" (a name occasionally used in the 1980s) or shown as part of Midweek Sport Special. Until 1985, boxing continued to be shown on World of Sport, before the programme was axed. In the early 1990s, most boxing on ITV was branded The Big Fight Live. The exceptions to this were programmes on regional ITV, which used a variety of names, with \\"Fight Night\\" and \\"Seconds Out\\" being among the names used in some regions, while some overnight highlights programmes featuring less well-known or non- British fighters still used the \\"World Championship Boxing\\" title. During the 1980s, \\"Fight Night\\" promoted the careers of boxers like Errol Christie, whose fights featured on ITV and not the rival BBC. However, \\"The Big Fight Live\\" or \\"The Big Fight\\" (for highlights programmes), featuring its bright yellow and black branding and its dramatic theme tune became the consistent brand used for all of ITV's main network boxing coverage. This was a particularly fruitful period for ITV's boxing coverage, as they featured fights involving boxers such as Nigel Benn, Chris Eubank and Naseem Hamed. These were produced by LWT for the ITV Network, and drew large audiences. The decline of ITV's boxing portfolio began in mid-1994 when Barry Hearn took Chris Eubank and his stable of fighters to Sky Sports. At the start of 1996, Sky Sports won the rights to show Sports Network (Frank Warren promoted) fights, leaving ITV with only occasional boxing for the following ten years. Their only networked boxing during this period were a few fights involving Shea Neary, thanks to a contract with Merseyside promoter John Hyland. Other bouts were shown on ITV2 and the ITV Sport Channel, while ITV2 also ran a fortnightly magazine show called \\"Boxing First\\". This was presented by Russ Williams with Steve Bunce as a regular studio pundit, and other studio guests. The programme featured highlights of fights not shown live on UK television, as well as features. Other boxing was shown on a regional basis, but this was rare. In May 2005, ITV returned to the ring, with live coverage of Amir Khan's last fight before becoming professional against Mario Kindel√°n. It achieved a peak audience of 6.3 million viewers, encouraging ITV to reach a long-term agreement to show future Sports Network boxing promotions. In June 2005, the network won back the rights to show Frank Warren's Sports Network fights and as a result broadcast fights involving Amir Khan, Joe Calzaghe, Danny Williams, Audley Harrison and others. As of September 2007, their coverage of Sports Network promotions was shared with Setanta Sports, with only Amir Khan fights remaining with ITV. On 6 September 2008, Amir Khan switched to Sky from ITV, signalling the end of the network's contract with Frank Warren's Sports Network. Later that month, ITV announced a 2-year deal with Hennessy Sports for coverage of 26 fights. The majority of fights were due to be screened on ITV4 and once again were to be hosted by Jim Rosenthal, who returned to ITV having previously been sacked in early 2008. Amir Khan moved back to ITV in 2010, with his fight against Paulie Malignaggi broadcast live in the early hours of Sunday 15 May 2010. It also broadcast delayed coverage of at least one Carl Froch fight in America the night after it took place around this period, along with a number of other matches Shortly afterwards, ITV stopped screening any boxing coverage, believing it not to be commercially viable. Presentation The main host of ITV Boxing was Jim Rosenthal, who returned to the programme after presenting ITV's Formula One coverage from 1997, on its return in 2005. Barry McGuigan left Sky Sports in 2005 to continue his role as a pundit on ITV. Commentary was provided by John Rawling and Duke McKenzie. Gabriel Clarke provided reports and interviews with the boxers. The main event was usually shown on the ITV Network while undercard matches were often televised on ITV4. Before 1996, the main commentators had been Reg Gutteridge and Jim Watt, both of whom moved to Sky while continuing to commentate for the few boxing shows ITV televised in the late 1990s, which were presented by Russ Williams. Graham Beecroft and Nick Halling commentated on boxing on a regional basis during the late 1990s, while Halling was also the commentator on Boxing First. 2015 Onwards In 2015 ITV started screening live boxing matches once again beginning with Carl Frampton‚Äôs fight against Chris Avalos. On December 13, 2016, ITV announced that Chris Eubank Jr. would fight for the IBO World Championship live on a new pay-per-view channel called ITV Box OfficeChris Eubank Jnr to fight on new ITV Box Office channel under 'The Big Fight Live' name, bringing an end to the 7 year hiatus of the programme not being on TV. In December 2018, ITV announced a ground-breaking new deal with Haymon Sports and Premier Boxing Champions (PBC) to bring exclusive coverage of PBC world- class boxing events to ITV.https://www.itv.com/news/2018-12-11/itv-announce- groundbreaking-deal-with-haymon-sports-and-premier-boxing-champions/ The collaboration was the first time that Haymon Sports and PBC has partnered with a UK broadcaster to stage boxing events regularly in the UK. The exclusive three-year deal guarantees a minimum of 15 televised events each year, to be shown free on ITV, ITV4 and as pay-per-view events on ITV Box Office. The first programme of the new deal was the IBF Super Middleweight title fight between Jose Uzcategui and Caleb Plant in the early hours of Monday 14 January 2019, UK time, which was broadcast live on ITV4. Plant, the challenger, won the fight on points. ITV took the feed from host broadcaster Fox Sports and Ronald McIntosh provided voiceovers for UK viewers when the host broadcaster was on commercial breaks.

Domestic Operations Branch. News Bureau, 1943 Charles Clinton Spaulding (August 1, 1874 ‚Äì August 1, 1952) was an African-American business leader. For close to thirty years, he presided over North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, which became America's largest black-owned business, with assets of over US$ 40 million at his death. Biography Spaulding was born in Columbus County, North Carolina to Benjamin Mack Spaulding, Senior (1845-1921) and Margaret Ann Virginia Moore (1849-1920). \\"Black Wall Street\\" marker in Durham He started out as a dishwasher and later, general manager of a grocery company when John Merrick, the owner of several barber shops, and Aaron M. Moore, a practicing physician, thought of an idea of an insurance company in 1898 (then named North Carolina Mutual and Provident Association). Merrick and Moore employed Spaulding in 1899 and he soon became general manager. After Moore's death in 1923, Spaulding served as NC Mutual president from 1923 to 1952. The company specialized in \\"industrial insurance\\", Which was basically burial insurance. The company hired salesmen whose main job was to collect small payments (of about 10 cents) To cover the insured person for the next week. If the person did die while insured, the company immediately paid benefits of about 100 dollars. This covered the cost of a suitable funeral, which was a high- prestige item in the black community.Charles Richmond Henderson, \\"Industrial Insurance. VI. Private Insurance Companies,\\" American Journal of Sociology (in JSTOR Spaulding died on his 78th birthday in Durham, North Carolina. Leadership Roles Spaulding provided leadership in the National Negro Insurance Association and the National Negro Bankers Association by 1920. In 1942 the New York Chamber of Commerce, mainly a white body, elected him to membership. He served as a trustee for Howard University, Shaw University, and North Carolina College at Durham. He was also active in politics. He helped establish the Durham Committee on Negro Affairs in 1935, serving as its first chairman. As national chairman of the Urban League's Emergency Advisory Council from 1930 to 1939, he campaigned to secure New Deal jobs for African- Americans. Awards and honors In 1926 Spaulding was awarded the Harmon Foundation Gold Medal for distinguished achievement in business. Shaw University, Tuskegee Institute and Atlanta University conferred honorary Doctorates of Law on him. Spaulding was recognized alongside John Merrick and Richard Fitzgerald as Main Honorees by the Sesquicentennial Honors Commission at the Durham 150 Closing Ceremony in Durham, NC on November 2, 2019. The posthumous recognition was bestowed upon the group for their contributions to Durham as innovative leaders who established one of the nation's strongest African American entrepreneurial enclaves.

Derb. & Sol. and C. peregrina (Sauvageau) Hamel. C. sinuosa was present at least as far back as the 1840s in Spain, and C.peregrina was introduced and first noticed by oyster fishermen in the Bay of Biscay in 1906. It was first noticed in Britain in 1907 in Cornwall and Dorset.Jones, W.E. 1974. Changes in the seaweed flora of the British Isles. In Hawksworth, D.L.

U.S. Congress special election In February 2007, Republican U.S. Congressman Charlie Norwood, of Georgia's 10th congressional district, died of cancer. There was a special election open primary in June 2007, where candidates of all parties participated in the primary. A candidate needed 50% to win outright, and there would be a run-off if no candidate earned it the first time. Ten candidates filed: six Republicans, three Democrats, and a Libertarian. Whitehead was the only elected politician to run, and was the front-runner. He won the endorsements of U.S. Congressman Saxby Chambliss. In the primary, Whitehead finished first with 44% of the vote. Doctor Paul Broun qualified for the run-off, ranking second with 21% of the vote, with only 198 votes more than third-place finisher James Marlow, a Democrat. Broun won a plurality of just four counties: Oconee (47%), Jackson (42%), Oglethorpe (37%), and Morgan (31%).http://sos.georgia.gov/elections/election_results/2007_0619/026.htmhttp://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=343830 In the runoff campaign, Whitehead angered some voters by failing to appear at a debate held in Athens and then by referring to his alma mater, the University of Georgia, as a \\"liberal bastion\\" that should be eliminated, save for the football team. In the July 17, 2007 election, Broun upset Whitehead by a margin of just 0.8%, a difference of just 394 votes. After the votes were certified, Whitehead declined to ask for a recount despite the narrow margin. Broun won the counties in the Northern part of the district, while Whitehead won the counties in the southern part.

It consists of lead vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Ryan Tedder, guitarist Zach Filkins, guitarist Drew Brown, bassist and cellist Brent Kutzle, drummer Eddie Fisher and keyboardist Brian Willett. The band first achieved commercial success on Myspace as an unsigned act. In late 2002, after OneRepublic played shows throughout the Los Angeles area, several record labels approached the band with interest, but the band ultimately signed with Velvet Hammer, an imprint of Columbia Records. They made their first album with producer Greg Wells during the summer and fall of 2005 at his studio, Rocket Carousel, in Culver City, California. The album was originally scheduled for release on June 6, 2006, but the group was dropped by Columbia two months before the album came out. The lead single of that album, \\"Apologize\\", was released on April 30, 2006, on Myspace and received some recognition there, becoming number one on the Myspace charts. In 2007, OneRepublic released their debut album, Dreaming Out Loud. Its lead single, \\"Apologize\\", was remixed by Timbaland, becoming a huge international success, reaching number one in sixteen countries and subsequently earning them a Grammy Award nomination. The second single, \\"Stop and Stare\\", mirrored its predecessor's success. The album was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The band's second album, Waking Up (2009), produced the singles \\"All the Right Moves\\", \\"Secrets\\", \\"Marchin On\\", and \\"Good Life\\", with the latter reaching the top ten of the US Billboard Hot 100. OneRepublic's third album, Native (2013), became the band's first top ten album on the Billboard 200, and highest-charting album to date, charting at number four. The lead single, \\"If I Lose Myself\\", charted within the top ten in several countries, while the album's third single, \\"Counting Stars\\", became the band's most successful single in recent years, obtaining top-five placements in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, the U.S., and the UK. This marks their highest charting single in the United Kingdom to date. It has also peaked at number 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100, matching their highest peak of \\"Apologize\\" in 2007. On October 7, 2016, OneRepublic released Oh My My, their fourth studio album, which featured a number of collaborators, including Cassius, Peter Gabriel, and Santigold. Preceded by the singles \\"Wherever I Go\\", released on May 13, 2016, and \\"Kids\\", released on August 12, 2016, it was recognized as a change in their sound in contrast to previous albums by both critics and the band itself. In 2017, the band released the singles \\"No Vacancy\\", \\"Truth to Power\\", \\"Stranger Things\\" with Kygo and \\"Rich Love\\" with Seeb. To date, the band has sold approximately over 16 million records worldwide. History=1996: Origins The first incarnation of what evolved into OneRepublic formed in 1996 after Ryan Tedder and Zach Filkins befriended each other during their senior year at Colorado Springs Christian High School in Colorado Springs, Colorado. During a drive home, as Filkins and Tedder discussed favorite musicians including Fiona Apple, Peter Gabriel and U2, they decided to put together a band. They enlisted a few musical friends and named their rock act This Beautiful Mess‚Äîa phrase which first attained cult prominence a year earlier when Sixpence None the Richer released its award-winning second album, This Beautiful Mess. Tedder, Filkins & Co. had a few small gigs at Pikes Perk Coffee & Tea House, attended by friends and family. Senior year ended, and Tedder and Filkins parted ways, each attending different colleges. 2002‚Äì2007: Reformation Reuniting in Los Angeles in 2002, Tedder and Filkins reformed their second band under the moniker Republic. Tedder, by then an established songwriter and record producer, had convinced Filkins who was living in Chicago to relocate. Nine months later, the band signed with Columbia Records. After a few lineup changes, the group finally settled with Tedder on vocals, Filkins on lead guitar and backing vocals, Eddie Fisher on drums, Brent Kutzle on bass and cello, and Drew Brown on guitar. The band's name was changed to OneRepublic after the record company mentioned that the name Republic might result in legal action from other, similarly named bands. The band worked in the studio for two and a half years and recorded its first full-length album. Two months before the album was due to be released, (with \\"Sleep\\" as its debut single), OneRepublic was dropped by Columbia Records. The band was beginning to gain prominence on MySpace; Tedder said it was the number-one unsigned act on MySpace, and credits the website for keeping the band together. The band caught the attention of a number of labels, including Timbaland's Mosley Music Group. The band soon signed onto the label, becoming the first rock band to do so. 2007‚Äì2011: Dreaming Out Loud and Waking Up OneRepublic's debut album, Dreaming Out Loud, was released on November 20, 2007, and debuted at number 14 in the US with first week sales of 75,000. Critical reception to the album ranged from negative to mixed. Allmusic gave the album a modest review, stating the \\"album sounds derivative\\" but also \\"sounds cohesive and smoothly pleasant\\". Robert Christgau gave the album a negative review, and termed it a \\"dud\\". Rolling Stone gave the album 2 out of 5 stars, but placed the band in its \\"Artists to Watch\\" list, which featured ten artists that, according to the magazine, \\"...are bringing the future of music, today.\\" Their lead single, \\"Apologize\\", was released in its original version from Dreaming Out Loud. Timbaland, who at the time was one of the most highly visible artists/producers, approached the band to be featured on a compilation album he was working on, Shock Value. Timbaland rearranged the song slightly to give it more of an R&B; feel adding backing vocals, guitar bass line, a new drum section, and autotune to the lead vocals. This along with the strong backing of the Timbaland name made it a major hit both in the United States and internationally. It peaked a number one globally, including eight consecutive weeks on the Billboard Pop 100 chart, subsequently reaching the top three of the Billboard Hot 100. The song sold five million copies in the United States alone, receiving a five-times Platinum certification from the RIAA. The song was a massive hit internationally, reaching number one in sixteen countries, including Australia, Austria, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and Sweden. It also spent thirteen weeks at number one in Canada. It has since been certified over 2x Platinum in 6 countries worldwide, including 4x Platinum in Australia. The song ultimately earned the band their first Grammy nomination for best pop performance in a group or duo. The second single from the album, \\"Stop and Stare\\", released in March 2008, reached the top ten in eight countries worldwide, including charting at number four in the United Kingdom, and topping the UK Rock Chart. It also reached number twelve on the Billboard Hot 100, and number nine on the Pop 100. Additional singles included \\"Say (All I Need)\\" and \\"Mercy\\". The album was later certified Platinum in the United States and Germany, as well as Gold in Australia, Austria, and Canada. OneRepublic's second studio album, Waking Up, was released on November 17, 2009, charting at number 21 on the Billboard 200, and ultimately selling over 500,000 copies in the US and over 1 million worldwide. The lead single, \\"All the Right Moves\\", was released on September 9, 2009, peaking at number 18 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and being certified 2x Platinum. \\"Secrets\\", the second single from the album, reached the top five in Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, Poland, and on the US Adult Pop Songs and Adult Contemporary charts. It has sold almost 4 million copies in the US as of August 2014. Furthermore, it reached number 21 on the Hot 100. The song was used in television shows such as Gossip Girl, Lost, Nikita and CSI: Miami, as well as in the sci-fi fantasy movie, The Sorcerer's Apprentice and the promos for ABC Family's series Pretty Little Liars. \\"Marchin On\\", the album's third single made top ten appearances in Austria, Germany, and Israel, however it was the fourth single \\"Good Life\\" that became the band's most successful song from the album, particularly in the US. Released on November 19, 2010, it became their second top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 at the time, peaking at number 8 and selling over 4 million copies in the US alone, earning a 4x Platinum certification. Rolling Stone put the song on its list of the best 15 whistling songs of all time. Waking Up was later certified Gold in Austria, Germany, and the US for sales of over 500,000, and has since sold over 1 million copies worldwide. OneRepublic perform at Zermatt Unplugged 2011 in Switzerland In 2009, OneRepublic were featured on Leona Lewis's second studio album Echo on the track \\"Lost Then Found\\". On June 5, 2010, the band supported Pink on her Funhouse Summer Carnival Tour at Innsbruck. OneRepublic supported Bon Jovi at The O2 Arena for three dates in June 2010. The band supported Maroon 5 for their Palm Trees & Power Lines Tour in fall 2010. In November 2011, OneRepublic released their first Christmas single, titled \\"Christmas Without You\\". 2012‚Äì2016: Native and Oh My My  OneRepublic released their third studio album, Native, on March 22, 2013, marking the end of the band's three and a half year hiatus. The album debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 becoming their first top 10 album in the US, with first week sales of 60,000. It was also their best opening sales week since their debut album Dreaming Out Loud which sold 75,000 copies in its first week. \\"Feel Again\\" was originally released as the lead single on August 27, 2012, however after the album being delayed it was re-branded as a \\"promotional single\\". The song was released as a part of Save the Children's Every Beat Matters campaign, where a portion of the proceeds from the single's sales would be donated. It peaked at number 36 on the US Billboard Hot 100, additionally marking the top ten positions in Germany and on the US Adult Pop Songs chart. The single was later certified Platinum in the US. The song was used in an official trailer for The Spectacular Now. The album's first global single, \\"If I Lose Myself\\" was released on January 8, 2013. It reached the top ten in Austria, Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland, yet only managed to peak at number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song has since been certified Gold in both Italy and Australia. The album's third single, \\"Counting Stars\\", has become their most successful single from the album thus far and the band's biggest hit. The song achieved significant international success, charting within the top five in Australia, Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Luxembourg, Poland, New Zealand, Scotland, Slovakia, and Spain. It reached number 1 in the UK, marking the band's highest-charting song ever in that country, while also peaking at number 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100, their first song to crack the top 5 since Apologize. The song has since peaked at number 1 in 5 countries worldwide and has gone 5x platinum in Australia, 2x Platinum in New Zealand, Platinum in the UK, Gold in Switzerland and Germany, as well as currently holding a Diamond certification in the US. On October 29, 2015, the video for \\"Counting Stars\\" became the first video, by a band to reach 1 billion views on YouTube. As of April 2019, the music video has over 2.7 billion views and 9.6 million likes. On April 2, 2013, the band embarked on their headlining concert tour Native Tour in promotion for the album, beginning in Europe. This ran throughout 2013/14 and saw the band perform shows across Europe, North America, Asia and Australia, and New Zealand. The 2013 North American tour was a co-headlining tour with singer- songwriter Sara Bareilles, while the 2014 Native Summer Tour was a co- headlining tour with The Script and American Authors. The tour finished in Russia on November 9, 2014, marking a total of 169 shows and the band's largest tour to date. The album's fourth single, \\"Something I Need\\", was released on August 25, 2013. Despite little promotion of the song upon its release due to the late and unexpected success of \\"Counting Stars\\", the song has still managed to be certified 2x Platinum in Australia and Platinum in New Zealand as of December 2013. On April 8, 2014, OneRepublic confirmed via Twitter that their new song, \\"Love Runs Out\\", recorded at Studio Faust Records in Prague, would be released. Tedder said that the band had intended the song to be the first single on Native, but that he could not think of a chorus for the song, so the song's release was delayed. The song was added as the second track on the album's re-release on April 14. It was also an internationally successful track, breaking the top 5 in Austria, Germany, Canada, Switzerland, and the UK; and reaching the top 15 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. It is used as the promotional song for the show How to Get Away with Murder. In September 2014, OneRepublic released the music video for \\"I Lived\\", the sixth single off their Native album. Tedder noted that he wrote the song for his 4-year-old son. The related video raises awareness of cystic fibrosis by featuring a 15-year-old named Bryan Warnecke who lives with the condition. A remix was released for the Coca-Cola [RED] campaign to fight AIDS. In Bangkok, 2017 In November 2014, the group tweeted photos captioned: \\"Hotel recording, Poland.

Rhythm guitarist Drew Brown says that they are excited about it and they think that it is the best thing they have ever done. In June 2015, Tedder said that they were working on a song called 'Colors', which he said is one of his favorite songs going on the album.

History The Bruhat order on the Schubert varieties of a flag manifold or a Grassmannian was first studied by , and the analogue for more general semisimple algebraic groups was studied by . started the combinatorial study of the Bruhat order on the Weyl group, and introduced the name \\"Bruhat order\\" because of the relation to the Bruhat decomposition introduced by Fran√ßois Bruhat. The left and right weak Bruhat orderings were studied by . Definition If (W, S) is a Coxeter system with generators S, then the Bruhat order is a partial order on the group W. Recall that a reduced word for an element w of W is a minimal length expression of w as a product of elements of S, and the length ‚Ñì(w) of w is the length of a reduced word. *The (strong) Bruhat order is defined by u ‚â§ v if some substring of some (or every) reduced word for v is a reduced word for u. (Note that here a substring is not necessarily a consecutive substring.) *The weak left (Bruhat) order is defined by u ‚â§L v if some final substring of some reduced word for v is a reduced word for u. *The weak right (Bruhat) order is defined by u ‚â§R v if some initial substring of some reduced word for v is a reduced word for u. For more on the weak orders, see the article weak order of permutations. Bruhat graph The Bruhat graph is a directed graph related to the (strong) Bruhat order. The vertex set is the set of elements of the Coxeter group and the edge set consists of directed edges (u, v) whenever u = tv for some reflection t and ‚Ñì(u) < ‚Ñì(v). One may view the graph as an edge- labeled directed graph with edge labels coming from the set of reflections. (One could also define the Bruhat graph using multiplication on the right; as graphs, the resulting objects are isomorphic, but the edge labelings are different.) The strong Bruhat order on the symmetric group (permutations) has M√∂bius function given by \\\\mu(\\\\pi,\\\\sigma)=(-1)^{\\\\ell(\\\\sigma)-\\\\ell(\\\\pi)}, and thus this poset is Eulerian, meaning its M√∂bius function is produced by the rank function on the poset.

Peopled by characters introduced by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in his 1847 epic poem of the same name, it tells the tale of Evangeline Bellefontaine and Gabriel Lajeunesse, born on the same mid-18th century day in the Acadian village of Grand-Pr√© in Nova Scotia. The two forge a bond that strengthens as they grow older, and they eventually become engaged. Their lives are disrupted when they are separated by British soldiers who invade the community and disperse the residents among the American colonies. Evangeline's search for her fianc√© takes her on a long journey from the New England seacoast to the Louisiana bayous, where she settles in St. Martin and faithfully waits for the arrival of her beloved. Years later she joins local priest Father Felician to assist him in his ministrations to the still-homeless Acadians roaming along the Atlantic seabord, a fateful move that unexpectedly brings her closer to her destiny. In 1995, inspired by a children's theatre production about the Acadian expulsion, music teacher Paul Taranto began working on a musical adaptation of the story. Three years later, he approached actor/playwright/lyricist Wax with a collection of songs he had written and asked if he would be interested in collaborating on the project. Unable to commit himself at the time, he recommended Taranto work with mutual friend Danny Tiberghein, who taught at the same school and had a theatrical background. When Tiberghein later was killed, Wax agreed to complete the musical with Taranto as a memorial to him. Production history In November 1998, Evangeline was presented in concert form at the Episcopal High School (Baton Rouge, Louisiana). The reaction was favorable enough for the creative team to pool their resources and finance the recording of a concept album. The first full-scale production of the show, directed by Paige Parsons-Wax, was mounted at Louisiana State University in 1999. Taranto conducted the orchestra, and Wax played one of the secondary roles. Two months later, there were two concert performances, one in Lafayette and the other at the Strand Theatre in Shreveport. The latter was taped by Louisiana Public Broadcasting and, in October 2000, aired on PBS stations throughout the United States and Canada. The PBS production starred Ana Maria Andricain as Evangeline, Rod Weber as Gabriel, and Andre Chapoy as Father Felician, backed by the Centenary College Choir, the Texas Street Singers, and the Children's Choir of the Episcopal School of Baton Rouge. Evangeline was staged at the Baton Rouge Little Theatre in 2004. It was directed Paige Parsons Gagliano, while composer Paul Taranto was musical director. Andre Chapoy appeared once more as Father Felician. In February 2011, the musical received full-scale production at the Manship Theatre in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, presented by the Dunham School's Theatre Department and directed again by Gagliano. Judy Snow acted as musical director while Lisa Hooks-Murray was the show's choreographer. Evangeline was played by Mary Elizabeth Drake, and Gabriel by Roston Jarrell. Father Felician was Quinn Miller. The show was staged at Theatre Baton Rouge in the fall of 2016, directed by Gagliano, with music direction by Taranto and choreography by Christine Chrest. Bailey Purvis played the title character.Evangeline The Musical , Theatrebr.org, accessed September 14, 2016 Synopsis In the French-Acadian village of Grand-Pre in Nova Scotia, it is the middle of the eighteenth century. The priest, Father Felician, announces that two children were born the same morning: Gabriel Lajeunesse and Evangeline Bellefontaine, both delivered by midwife Madame Hebert. The two children grow up together under the occupation of British troops. Eventually Gabriel proposes marriage to Evangeline. Her free-spirited friend, Praline, is unhappy about this. On the day before the wedding, the British force the Acadians from their homes and burn the village. To end the Acadians' opposition to the British, they are forced to disperse among the American colonies. Evangeline and Gabriel become separated, but they vow to stay faithful until they can find one another. Evangeline's search, with Father Felician, takes her from New England to St. Martin in the Louisiana territory. For years, she watches for Gabriel‚Äôs return, while everyone tells her to move on with her life. Praline, now wealthy and widowed, visits and urges Evangeline to join her to live a life of luxury and excitement in New Orleans, but Evangeline declines. She leaves with Father Felician to bring medical aid to the still-homeless Acadians along the Atlantic coast. In a hospital in Canada near Grand-Pre, she finally sees Gabriel, who has been surviving as a trapper, but he is dying of a fever. He dies in her arms, declaring his love and faithfulness to her. She confirms to Father Felician that this brief reunion was worth all she had given, her entire life, and nothing less.

It is a stochastic volatility model: such a model assumes that the volatility of the asset is not constant, nor even deterministic, but follows a random process.  Basic Heston model  The basic Heston model assumes that St, the price of the asset, is determined by a stochastic process: : dS_t = \\\\mu S_t\\\\,dt + \\\\sqrt{ u_t} S_t\\\\,dW^S_t \\\\, where u_t, the instantaneous variance, is a CIR process: : d u_t = \\\\kappa(\\\\theta - u_t)\\\\,dt + \\\\xi \\\\sqrt{ u_t}\\\\,dW^{ u}_t \\\\, and W^S_t, W^{ u}_t are Wiener processes (i.e., continuous random walks) with correlation œÅ, or equivalently, with covariance œÅ dt. The parameters in the above equations represent the following: * \\\\mu is the rate of return of the asset. * \\\\theta is the long variance, or long run average price variance; as t tends to infinity, the expected value of ŒΩt tends to Œ∏. * \\\\kappa is the rate at which ŒΩt reverts to Œ∏. * \\\\xi is the volatility of the volatility, or 'vol of vol', and determines the variance of ŒΩt. If the parameters obey the following condition (known as the Feller condition) then the process u_t is strictly positive : 2 \\\\kappa \\\\theta > \\\\xi^2 \\\\, .  Risk-neutral measure  :See Risk-neutral measure for the complete article A fundamental concept in derivatives pricing is that of the Risk-neutral measure; this is explained in further depth in the above article. For our purposes, it is sufficient to note the following: #To price a derivative whose payoff is a function of one or more underlying assets, we evaluate the expected value of its discounted payoff under a risk-neutral measure. #A risk-neutral measure, also known as an equivalent martingale measure, is one which is equivalent to the real-world measure, and which is arbitrage-free: under such a measure, the discounted price of each of the underlying assets is a martingale. See Girsanov's theorem. #In the Black-Scholes and Heston frameworks (where filtrations are generated from a linearly independent set of Wiener processes alone), any equivalent measure can be described in a very loose sense by adding a drift to each of the Wiener processes. #By selecting certain values for the drifts described above, we may obtain an equivalent measure which fulfills the arbitrage-free condition. Consider a general situation where we have n underlying assets and a linearly independent set of m Wiener processes. The set of equivalent measures is isomorphic to Rm, the space of possible drifts. Consider the set of equivalent martingale measures to be isomorphic to a manifold M embedded in Rm; initially, consider the situation where we have no assets and M is isomorphic to Rm. Now consider each of the underlying assets as providing a constraint on the set of equivalent measures, as its expected discount process must be equal to a constant (namely, its initial value). By adding one asset at a time, we may consider each additional constraint as reducing the dimension of M by one dimension. Hence we can see that in the general situation described above, the dimension of the set of equivalent martingale measures is m-n. In the Black-Scholes model, we have one asset and one Wiener process. The dimension of the set of equivalent martingale measures is zero; hence it can be shown that there is a single value for the drift, and thus a single risk-neutral measure, under which the discounted asset e^{-\\\\rho t}S_t will be a martingale. In the Heston model, we still have one asset (volatility is not considered to be directly observable or tradeable in the market) but we now have two Wiener processes - the first in the Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) for the asset and the second in the SDE for the stochastic volatility. Here, the dimension of the set of equivalent martingale measures is one; there is no unique risk-free measure. This is of course problematic; while any of the risk-free measures may theoretically be used to price a derivative, it is likely that each of them will give a different price. In theory, however, only one of these risk-free measures would be compatible with the market prices of volatility-dependent options (for example, European calls, or more explicitly, variance swaps). Hence we could add a volatility-dependent asset; by doing so, we add an additional constraint, and thus choose a single risk-free measure which is compatible with the market. This measure may be used for pricing.  Implementation  * A recent discussion of implementation of the Heston model is given in a paper by Kahl and J√§ckel . * Information about how to use the Fourier transform to value options is given in a paper by Carr and Madan. * Extension of the Heston model with stochastic interest rates is given in the paper by Grzelak and Oosterlee. * Derivation of closed-form option prices for time-dependent Heston model is presented in the paper by Gobet et al. * Derivation of closed-form option prices for double Heston model are presented in papers by Christoffersen and Gauthier. * Explicit solution of the Heston price equation in terms of the volatility was developed in Kouritzin , which can be combined with known weak solutions for the volatility equation and Girsanov's theorem to produce explicit weak solutions to the Heston model. Such solutions are useful for efficient simulation. * There exist few known parametrisation of the volatility surface based on the Heston model (Schonbusher, SVI and gSVI). * Use of the model in a local stochastic volatility context is given in a paper by Van Der Weijst.  Calibration  The calibration of the Heston model is often formulated as a least squares problem, with the objective function minimizing the difference between the prices observed in the market and those calculated from the Heston model. The prices are typically those of vanilla options. Sometimes the model is also calibrated to the variance swap term-structure as in Guillaume and Schoutens. Yet another approach is to include forward start options, or barrier options as well, in order to capture the forward smile. Under the Heston model, the price of vanilla options is given analytically, but requires a numerical method to compute the integral. Le Floc'h summarizes the various quadratures applied and proposes an efficient adaptive Filon quadrature. The calibration problem involves the gradient of the objective function with respect to the Heston parameters. A finite difference approximation of the gradient has a tendency to create artificial numerical issues in the calibration. It is a much better idea to rely on automatic differentiation techniques. For example, the tangent mode of algorithmic differentiation may be applied using dual numbers in a straightforward manner. Alternatively, Cui et al. give explicit formulas for the analytical gradient. The latter was obtained by introducing an equivalent but tractable form of the Heston characteristic function.

The phenomenon has been relayed to modern audiences through Franz Kafka's 1922 short story A Hunger Artist. Hunger artists should be distinguished from two other phenomena of the time: \\"Fasting Women\\" such as Martha Taylor and Ann Moore who refused to eat while staying home, usually explained as some kind of miracle and later exposed as fraud; and \\"Living Skeletons\\", people of exceptionally low body weight performing in freak shows.

In 1938 he changed his surname to Gerhard and used the pseudonym Karl-Gerhard. Biography Karl Emil Georg Johnson was born in Hedvig Eleonora parish in Stockholm, Sweden. He was the son of Frans Emil Jonsson (1861‚Äì1917) and Jenny Augusta Jonsdotter (1863‚Äì1906). In 1916, he appeared as an actor under the direction of Hjalmar Selander at the Nya Teatern in Gothenburg. In 1919, he debuted as a couplet singer at the cabaret Fenixpalatset in Stockholm as successor to Ernst Rolf (1891‚Äì1932). For many years, he was an actor in various traveling theater companies. Through most of his career, he wrote songs and couplets as well as a large number of sketches, dialogues and monologues for performance on the stages of Stockholm and Gothenburg. Many of Karl Gerhard‚Äôs plays and songs were politically to the left, and during the 1930s and World War II, they contained clear anti-fascist statements.

He was primarily a right fielder, but occasionally played other positions in the infield.Baseball-Reference player page Wolf played for his hometown team, the Louisville Colonels of the American Association, from 1882, when they were called the Eclipse, to 1891. When the American Association folded, he then played for the St. Louis Browns of the National League in 1892, his last season in the majors. He played in just three games for the Browns before being let go. He played in the minor leagues until 1894 before retiring. In 1889, with the team 2‚Äì8 after ten games under player-manager Dude Esterbrook, the managerial reins were handed over to Wolf, who won only 14 of the 65 games he managed. The other two managers to follow, Dan Shannon and Jack Chapman, didn't fare any better, as Louisville won only 27 games that year with 111 losses. In 1890, he led the American Association in batting with .363. Wolf died in 1903 at the age of 41, from the effects of brain trauma he suffered a few years before in a fire-fighting accident, and is interred at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville.The Dead Ball Era This cemetery is where other Louisville ballplayers have been buried as well, including childhood friend and teammate Pete Browning.Pete Browning Bio See also * List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders * List of Major League Baseball career triples leaders * List of Major League Baseball player-managers ReferencesExternal links *SABR Biography \\"Chicken Wolf\\" Category:Major League Baseball right fielders Category:Louisville Eclipse players Category:Louisville Colonels players Category:St. Louis Browns (NL) players Category:Louisville Colonels managers Category:Syracuse Stars (minor league baseball) players Category:Utica Stars players Category:Buffalo Bisons (minor league) players Category:Savannah Modocs players Category:Macon Hornets players Category:Major League Baseball player-managers Category:Baseball players from Kentucky Category:19th-century baseball players Category:Burials at Cave Hill Cemetery Category:1862 births Category:1903 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Louisville, Kentucky ","title":"Jimmy Wolf"},{"id":"10163233","text":"St. Godehard's Rotunda in Strzelin St. Godehard's Rotunda () in Strzelin is a Romanesque church founded in the 11th century and rebuilt in the 13th century.

The line currently runs from the Wal-Mart parking lot in Catonsville to Bullneck Road/Turner's Station Dundalk (the destination sign found on buses) mostly along the corridors of Frederick Road on the west side and Eastern Avenue on the east side, serving the communities of Yale Heights, Pigtown, downtown Baltimore, Fells Point, and Highlandtown. The bus route is the successor to the 8 Catonsville, 10 Highlandtown, and 26 Sparrows Point streetcar lines.Harwood, Herbert H. (2003). Baltimore Streetcars: The Postwar Years. Johns Hopkins University Press. pp 116-125. . History Route 10 was electrified in 1893 as a streetcar route between Roland Park and Point Breeze. Between Roland Park and downtown Baltimore, the route was similar to that of the current Route 27. There were also branches to Union Avenue and Sweet Air industrial parks. From downtown to Point Breeze, routing was similar to that of today's route, with slight variations in the streets on which the trolleys operated. In 1940, Route 10 was shortened to Highlandtown, and service to Point Breeze was provided on a new Route 20 shuttle.http://www.btco.net/Routes/route2.htm Though today's Route 20 does serve the Dundalk area, the no. 20 Point Breeze shuttle was an unrelated service. The origin of the current Route 20 was as a service along Baltimore Street. In 1959, Route 10 was converted to a rubber tire bus operation. Service was extended west to Pimlico and east to Sparrows Point after being combined with Route 26, which started operation in 1926 as a separate streetcar line, before its conversion to a shorter shuttle streetcar in 1950, with riders on other parts of the line being diverted to Route 10. Route 26 ended its operation in 1959, when a branch of Route 10 to Sparrows Point was added.Harwood, p. 28. In 1982, Route 10 was split into two routes. The Route 10 designation was used for a line that ran from State Center (the future location of the State Center Metro Subway Station to the Dundalk area. A new Route 27 was formed that back then operated from Pimlico to Albemarle Street, serving the northern portion of this route. In 1992, the route to Sparrows Point was modified, and buses took Wise Avenue rather than the Peninsula Expressway. This was initially done because of a road closure, but MTA, finding a demand for bus service on Wise Avenue, did not change the route back. In 2005, as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, a comprehensive overhaul plan for the region's transit system, Route 10 was combined with Route 2, and extended west from downtown Baltimore to Catonsville. Under this plan, all trips were routed to the Bullneck Road loop in Dundalk. Service to Sparrows Point, which had low ridership and required a heavy taxpayer subsidy, was no longer provided, and all other short branches on the route were discontinued. In addition, a portion of the route between Lombard Street and the State Center Metro subway station was eliminated. Riders on Wise Avenue were instructed to use Route 4. The combined route was initially identified as Route 2/10 during a transitional period. On February 5, 2006, it was renamed simply to Route 10. On November 1, 2016, a route 10 bus was involved in a fatal crash with a school bus. Six people, including the drivers of both buses and four passengers of the MTA bus were killed. The crash is currently under investigation. https://www.google.com/amp/www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Fatalities- Confirmed-in-Crash-Between-MTA-Bus-School-Bus-- 399449601.html%3Famp%3Dy?client=safari BaltimoreLink As part of the BaltimoreLink overhaul, on June 18, 2017 Route 10 will be served by two different routes.

Early life Born in Exeter, Devon, and called Charles Cornwallis Michell later in his life because of the proximity to Cornwall of his birthplace, Michell was educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich and commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1809. He headed a brigade at the battles of Vittoria and Toulouse, took part in Waterloo and was appointed teacher of military drawing at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst on 24 March 1824 and professor of military fortification at Woolwich on 25 December 1825 and promoted to the brevet rank of major shortly thereafter. He was fluent in Spanish, Portuguese and French. Cape of Good Hope Michell was appointed as surveyor-general at the Cape in 1828, (having probably heard of the post through his cousin Rufane Donkin) at the same time holding the positions of superintendent of public works and civil engineer. For performing these functions, he received an annual salary of ¬£800. The surveyor-general's duties included taking charge of the detailed surveys needed to produce a good map of the Colony, improving passes and roads and surveying the Colony's border accurately. He was an outstanding architect, designing various churches such as St. Paul's in Rondebosch and St. John's in Bathurst. He suggested improvements to Table Bay Harbour and designed lighthouses at Mouille Point, Cape Agulhas (supposedly modelled on the Pharos of Alexandria) and Cape Recife. Anne Michell Charles Collier Michell wash painting by Charles Collier Michell - Museum Africa, Johannesburg Map of Cape Town and surroundsCharles Collier Michell 1837 He acted as assistant quartermaster in the Sixth Frontier War in 1834. His most active area was in the planning and construction of roads, as well as their improvement, being responsible for the planning of Michell's Pass near Ceres - a vast improvement on the old Mostert's Hoek Pass - and the Houw Hoek Pass near Elgin, both carried out by Andrew Geddes Bain, as well as Sir Lowry's Pass and the Montagu Pass, the latter constructed over the Outeniqua Mountains by an Australian road-engineer Henry Fancourt White in 1843-47. Besides all his other skills, Michell was an accomplished water-colourist, particularly of landscapes. His illustrations appeared in Narrative of a voyage of observation among the colonies of Western Africa and of a campaign in Kaffirland (1837), written by his son-in-law, Capt. Sir James Edward Alexander. He was granted a pension in 1848 and returned to England where he died on 28 March 1851 at Eltham. Family While Michell was posted in Toulouse, he married schoolgirl Anne D'Arragon on 10 October 1814, after eloping. She was the only daughter of a retired officer in the army of King Louis XVI of France and her parents disapproved of the marriage. Their first two children were born in Lisbon, Julia Anne in 1815 and Frederica Louisa in June 1817. The third, Lady Eveline Marie Alexander, was born in Nantes on 16 April 1821, and the last Anne in Cape Town on 28 October 1829.

Organic bases are usually, but not always, proton acceptors. They usually contain nitrogen atoms, which can easily be protonated. For example, amines or nitrogen- containing heterocyclic compounds have a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom and can thus act as proton acceptors. Examples include: * pyridine * alkanamines, such as methylamine * imidazole * benzimidazole * histidine * guanidine * phosphazene bases * hydroxides of quaternary ammonium cations or some other organic cations Factors affecting alkalinity Most organic bases are considered to be weak. Many factors can affect the strength of the compounds. One such factor is the inductive effect. A simple explanation of the term would state that electropositive atoms (such as carbon groups) attached in close proximity to the potential proton acceptor have an \\"electron-releasing\\" effect, such that the positive charge acquired by the proton acceptor is distributed over other adjacent atoms in the chain. The converse is also possible as alleviation of alkalinity: electronegative atoms or species (such as fluorine or the nitro group) will have an \\"electron- withdrawal\\" effect and thereby reduce the basicity. To this end, trimethylamine is a more potent base than merely ammonia, due to the inductive effect of the methyl groups allowing the nitrogen atom to more readily accept a proton and become a cation being much greater than that of the hydrogen atoms. In guanidines, the protonated form (guanidinium) has three resonance structures, giving it increased stability and making guanidines stronger bases. Phosphazene bases also contain phosphorus and are, in general, more alkaline than standard amines and nitrogen-based heterocyclics. Protonation takes place at the nitrogen atom, not the phosphorus atom to which the nitrogen is double-bonded. Hydroxide donors Some organic bases, such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide, tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, or choline hydroxide are hydroxide donors rather than proton acceptors like the above compounds. However, they are not always stable. Choline hydroxide, for example, is metastable and slowly breaks down to release trimethylamine.

It supports SCM tools including CVS, Subversion, Git, Perforce, Clearcase and RTC, and can execute Apache Ant and Apache Maven based projects, as well as arbitrary shell scripts and Windows batch commands. The primary developer of Hudson was Kohsuke Kawaguchi, who worked for Sun Microsystems at the time. Released under the MIT License, Hudson is free software. Builds can be started by various means, including scheduling via a cron-like mechanism, building when other builds have completed, and by requesting a specific build URL. Hudson became a popular alternative to CruiseControl and other open-source build servers in 2008. At JavaOne conference in May 2008, it was the winner of Duke's Choice Award in the Developer Solutions category. When Oracle bought Sun, it declared its intention to trademark the Hudson name, and development began on a commercial version. It was decided by the majority of the development community, including Kawaguchi, to continue the project under the name Jenkins in early 2011. Oracle maintained that Hudson was continuing development and that Jenkins was a fork; the Jenkins developers considered Hudson to be the fork. Interest in Hudson collapsed thereafter. Eventually Oracle donated the remaining Hudson project assets to the Eclipse Foundation at the end of 2012. Having been replaced by Jenkins, Hudson is no longer maintained and was announced as obsolete in February 2017. Plugins Hudson is extensible through a plugin architecture, and many plugins have been made publicly available which extend it far beyond purely being a build tool for Java projects. Plugins are available for integrating Hudson with most version control systems and bug databases. Many build tools are supported via their respective plugins. Plugins can also change the way Hudson looks or add new functionality. Builds can generate test reports in various formats (JUnit is supported out of the box, others via plugins) and Hudson can display the reports and generate trends and render them in the GUI.  Hudson‚ÄìJenkins split  In November 2010, an issue arose in the Hudson community with respect to the infrastructure used, which grew to encompass questions over Oracle's stewardship and perceived control of the project. Negotiations were held between the principal project contributors and Oracle; although there were many areas of agreement, a key sticking point was the control of the name \\"Hudson\\" itself, which Oracle claimed, and for which it submitted a trademark registration in early December 2010 (granted on October 25, 2011). As a result, on January 11, 2011, a proposal was made to change the project name from \\"Hudson\\" to \\"Jenkins\\". The proposal was overwhelmingly approved by those that voted on January 29, 2011, creating the Jenkins project. On February 1, 2011, Oracle indicated that it, in partnership with others in the community, intended to continue development of Hudson.  Move to Eclipse Foundation  On May 3, 2011, the Eclipse Foundation in conjunction with the key Hudson committers, Oracle, Sonatype and other community supporters, put forward a formal proposal for the transfer of Hudson, including the core code and problematic trademarks, to the Eclipse Foundation. Hudson's founder Kohsuke Kawaguchi saw the Oracle move as validating Jenkins. \\"When we were talking with Oracle to find a middle ground, they made it very clear that they have no intention of giving up the trademark control. But with this move, they clearly acknowledge that Oracle couldn't keep up with the Jenkins project.\\" On January 23, 2013, Eclipse announced the inclusion of Hudson 3 in the Eclipse Foundation.

Generally regarded as a milestone of the Czechoslovak New Wave movement, it follows two young girls (Jitka Cerhov√° and Ivana Karbanov√°), both named Marie, who engage in strange pranks. Originally planned as a satire of bourgeois decadence, the movie targets those attached to rules and was referred to by Chytilov√° as \\"a necrologue about a negative way of life.\\"Anderson, Melissa. \\"Mod Madness from Vera Chytilov√°‚Äôs New Wave Daisies,\\" The Village Voice, July 4, 2012.

The shots of the airplanes are from US Navy footage shot in the Pacific Theatre during World War II. The first scene shows the two main characters sitting in bathing suits. Their conversation is robotic and from that point on they decide to be bad. The next scene shows Marie I and Marie II dancing in front of a tree. The tree has many fruits and resembles the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Once Marie I eats from the tree, they both fall and appear in their apartment. Marie II attempts suicide by filling the room with gas, but fails because she left the window open. In an extended sequence of scenes, the girls go on dates with a series of older men. In each scene, the girls cavort and eat much food while mocking their date, who is driven to the end of his patience, at which point the girls say that they are late for a train, and then ditch the man at the train station. The girls eventually go to a Prague nightclub where they upstage a 1920s-style dancing couple's floor show and annoy patrons with their drunken antics.Hoberman, J. \\"Perfect Chaos: Vera Chytilov√°‚Äôs Sedmikr√°sky (Daisies),\\" Artforum, April 2019. Retrieved October 10, 2020 Marie II also goes to the apartment of a man who is a butterfly collector. In this scene, many butterflies are shown as still frames. The man repeatedly declares his love to Marie II, whom he calls Julie. At the end, she says that she wants to eat. In later scenes, the two girls lounge about in various rooms while listening to their suitors profess love for them over the phone. These scenes are accompanied by footage of the girls destroying phallic food, as well as eggs. At one point, the girls meet an older woman, who begs them to stay for a bit, and remarks on how she misses her youth. The girls wait for her to step out, then rob her and leave, after which they philosophize about their actions. Later, they go to a factory. There are still frames of locks, and the building looks run down. They look for \\"nourishment\\" and stumble upon a feast. They eat the food, make a mess and destroy the room. They destroy a chandelier, and the film cuts to them being dunked in water like witches, as the director states how there can be no \\"clean resolution\\" to the destructive dinner. The Maries return to the dining room, and attempt to clean the room while whispering about being good and hardworking, and that this will make them happy. This is not enough, as the chandelier falls on the Maries, presumably crushing them. The film closes with war footage similar to the beginning, and ends with an epigraph that the film is \\"dedicated to those who get upset only over a stomped-upon bed of lettuce.\\" Cast * Jitka Cerhov√° as Marie I * Ivana Karbanov√° as Marie II * Marie ƒåe≈°kov√° as Woman in the bathroom * Ji≈ôina My≈°kov√° as Toilet lady * Marcela B≈ôezinov√° as Toilet lady * Julius Albert as Older dandy * Old≈ôich Hora as Dandy * Jan Klus√°k as Young dandy * Josef Kon√≠ƒçek as Dancer * Jarom√≠r Vom√°ƒçka as Happy gentleman At the time of production, neither Cerhov√° or Karbanov√° were professional actresses, the former being a student and the latter a salesclerk. Co-writer Ester Krumbachov√° described the protagonists as ‚Äúa pair of silly young girls but they could just as well have been two generals.\\"  Themes and style  Throughout the film, the two main characters muse about youth, happiness, existence, and the state of being spoiled. The film has very little in the way of plot structure, and scenes proceed from one to the next chaotically, frequently switching between black and white, color, and filter color footage. Many scenes include elements of slapstick, and the characters spend a significant amount of the film eating or playing with food. Reception=Domestic The film was positively received by Czech audience and critics. Film critic Anton√≠n J. Liehm wrote that Daisies was \\"a remarkable film not only for the viewers that appreciate its artistic significance, but also for those who just want to be entertained and might miss its magnitude on the first viewing\\". Author Milan Kundera called the film \\"masterly made\\" and wrote that the \\"monstrosity of the main characters was depicted elegantly, poetically, dreamlike and beautifully, but without becoming any less monstrous\\". It won the Trilobit Award for the Best Czechoslovak movie of 1966 by Film and TV Union. However after being criticized by the communist MP Jaroslav Pru≈æinec during interpellations in May 1967, the film was pulled from all major cinemas for ‚Äúdepicting the wanton‚Äù, and was only screened in smaller venues. International The film was also very well received in Europe. French journalist Pierre Billard, writing for L'Express, compared the Daisies to Mack Sennett and Marx Brothers movies and called it \\"a grand celebration of absurdities with technical finesse and marvellous art direction so rarely achieved\\". In the US press, the reception was mostly negative. Bosley Crowther in The New York Times wrote: \\"Pretentiously kookie and laboriously overblown mod farce about two playgirls who are thoroughly emptyheaded. Its stabs at humor and satire simply don't cut.\\" It is the highest ranked Czech film in They Shoot Pictures Don't They, an online aggregator of critic best-of lists.

The world‚Äôs largest exclusively cultural Carpatho-Rusyn organization, C-RS was established in Pittsburgh in 1994 and has over 1,250 members worldwide. The Carpatho-Rusyns are a distinct East Slavic ethnicity who have lived since the Middle Ages in remote villages scattered along the foothills and valleys of the Carpathian Mountains of East Central Europe (located in present-day Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Ukraine, and Romania as well as Croatia and Serbia). The name Rusyn identifies them as descendants, in part, of a people from the vast lands of ancient Rus' who were converted to the Eastern Christian Church in the 9th century. C-RS works to educate those of Rusyn descent as well as others about Carpatho-Rusyn heritage. The society supports the preservation and development of Rusyn culture on both sides of the Atlantic. Establishment The impetus for development of C-RS emanated from the Second World Congress of Rusyns held in Krynica, Poland in 1993. The new society built upon the inclusive approaches of other American Carpatho-Rusyn organizations, particularly the Carpatho-Rusyn Research Center founded in 1978 by Paul Robert Magocsi and the Rusin Association founded by Larry Goga in 1983. Formed by largely third and fourth-generation Carpatho-Rusyn Americans, C-RS was dedicated to helping others discover their Carpatho-Rusyn heritage at a time when the designation ‚ÄòCarpatho-Rusyn‚Äô was not widely known. Honoring a resilient, stateless people whose homeland changed hands repeatedly over the past centuries, C-RS sought to tell the remarkable story of ‚Äòa people from nowhere‚Äô ‚Äì a proverbial phrase coined by the famous American artist of Carpatho-Rusyn ancestry, Andy Warhol. The society‚Äôs logo prominently features the Carpatho-Rusyn national emblem as its symbol, a red bear facing blue and gold stripes with the motto ‚Äúmanifesting Rusyn culture and history‚Äù. This shield was first adopted as the official emblem of the Czechoslovak province of Subcarpathian Rus‚Äô on March 30, 1920. It fell into disuse after Nazi Germany‚Äôs dismembering of Czechoslovakia in 1938 but was adopted later as the official symbol of the Transcarpathian oblast of Ukraine on December 18, 1990. The emblem‚Äôs left field is divided into 7 horizontal blue and gold alternating stripes representing the seven largest rivers of the land: the Tysa, Teresva, Tereblya, Rika, Borzhava, Latorica and Uzh. The silver background represents the rich salt mines of the area and the red bear is depicted as the king of the snowy Carpathian Mountains. Early years The society expanded rapidly from its eight original founders. This growth necessitated a newsletter for its members, The New Rusyn Times'. In addition to promoting self-awareness of Carpatho-Rusyn identity, the mission of C-RS ‚Äòholds in high esteem the continuity of life which connects the living Rusyn culture to its treasured and ancient heritage‚Äô. Through its growing membership, the society promoted opportunities to learn, express, and enjoy the beauty and life affirming values of a living Carpatho-Rusyn heritage. Carpatho-Rusyn Folk Exhibit C-RS has hosted conferences on Carpatho-Rusyn history and genealogy and has managed the Carpatho-Rusyn cultural display at the Pittsburgh Folk Festival. The society co-sponsored a national Carpatho-Rusyn cultural celebration at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh and provides traveling displays of Rusyn culture for church and ethnic festivals. One of C-RS‚Äôs greatest early successes was in reestablishing relations with the European Carpatho-Rusyn community and supporting their efforts to resurrect and develop Carpatho-Rusyn culture after fifty years of Communist persecution. The society has two European funds ‚Äì Humanitarian Aid and the Rusyn Homeland Fund. C-RS exhibition of Carpatho-Rusyn Art The Humanitarian Aid Fund was created in 1996 when Carpatho-Rusyn villages in the Transcarpathian oblast of Ukraine experienced an unexpected late fall flood killing 17 and leaving hundreds homeless. Through its members, C-RS worked with the American Red Cross to set up relief for the people of Subcarpathian Rus‚Äô. Since then the fund sends primarily medical supplies to healthcare professionals in Transcarpathia for those in need. The society‚Äôs Rusyn Homeland Fund provided comprehensive support to the Carpatho-Rusyn community in eastern Slovakia at a critical time before the 2001 census to heighten ethnic awareness of those of Carpatho-Rusyn heritage. The fund underwrote the printing of maps showing Carpatho-Rusyn villages, a traveling display of Carpatho-Rusyn culture, and the widespread mailing of Rusyn-language newspapers and magazines to Carpatho-Rusyn households. Consequently, the number of Slovak citizens identifying as Carpatho-Rusyn increased dramatically compared with the previous census of 1991. The fund also provided financial support to help create a network of Rusyn language schools in Transcarpathia, Ukraine. Moving forward The founding president of C-RS was John Righetti who served until 2012 and is now president emeritus. He was succeeded by Jim Kepchar-Kaminski (2013-2015) and Maryann Sivak (2015-present). The organization currently consists of 6 chapters and 8 branches located throughout the United States. C-RS seeks to collaborate with all Carpatho-Rusyn organizations worldwide to disseminate historical, genealogical, linguistic and ethno-cultural information. In addition to its newsletter, the society created a website, blog and e-mail bulletin, C-RS Connection. Since 2004, the Carpatho-Rusyn Society Heritage Program has broadcast Carpatho-Rusyn music and information on WPIT in the greater Pittsburgh area and worldwide via the web. The society currently hosts a genealogy forum on its website and is expanding its social media presence Programs that have served both the Carpatho-Rusyn American and European communities include the highly successful Rusyn Heritage Tour. The society has promoted an annual two- week tour of the Carpatho-Rusyn communities in Poland, Slovakia and Ukraine. The tour experience is one of immersion in contemporary Rusyn culture as well as allowing for visits to ancestral villages and genealogical research. Since 2011, C-RS has supported and offered scholarships to the Studium Carpato-Ruthenorum, an annual international summer school for Rusyn language and culture held at Presov University. National Cultural CenterCarpatho-Rusyn Cultural and Educational Center, Munhall, PA In 2004, C-RS purchased the former St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cathedral at 915 Dickson Street in Munhall, Pennsylvania and converted it into the Carpatho-Rusyn Cultural and Educational Center. The century-old building holds significance for those of Carpatho-Rusyn heritage. It was designed in 1903 by Hungarian-born architect Titus de Bobula and was patterned after the Carpatho- Rusyn Greek Catholic Cathedral of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross in Uzhhorod (then Ungv√°r, Kingdom of Hungary). In 1929, the building was chosen as the cathedral for the Ruthenian (Rusyn) Greek Catholic Exarchate in America. Slavjane Folk Ensemble performance at C-RS 25th Anniversary celebration In May 2019, the society celebrated its 25th Anniversary at its renovated cultural center. Professor Paul Robert Magocsi, the world‚Äôs foremost authority on Carpatho-Rusyns, gave the keynote address and received the society‚Äôs highest honor, the Michael Strank Award, named after the Carpatho-Rusyn-American Marine sergeant who helped raise the US flag at the Battle of Iwo Jima. A native of Orjabyna (Jarabina), Czechoslovakia, Strank was awarded US citizenship posthumously in 2008. Prior recipients of the Michael Strank Award were Orestes Mihaly (2009) and John Righetti (2014).

Arnol is within the parish of Barvas, and is situated on the A858. Once a thriving township with over forty crofts, it now has a population of about 100 and supports a much lower number of active crofters. It is the location of the Blackhouse Museum, owned by Historic Environment Scotland. History The township of Arnol has been moved at least three times in the last two hundred years with materials for buildings being robbed and re-used from earlier structures. The early 19th century settlement was actually on the coast but later it was moved inland, closer to the main road. Few of the surviving buildings were lived in for more than 50 years and during that time many were considerably modified, extended and partially rebuilt. The Arnol blackhouses Through the village the ruins of blackhouses can be seen everywhere. Very few are still roofed but their massive stone walls and ‚Äòorganic‚Äô lines are very characteristic. The older ones have rounded ends and appear as a series of conjoined cells typically with a central living area/byre with a porch and barn on either side. The later ones can be identified by their gabled end walls and the presence of a stone dividing wall between living area and byre. The museum at No. 42 is probably the best example of a blackhouse on Lewis having been in state care since the occupants moved out in the 1960s. The building, complete with internal fittings, gives a very good impression of what it would have been like to live in a blackhouse. The central hearth is always kept lit and is essential to keep the roof dry and in good condition. The visitor centre also includes the ruined blackhouse over the road at No. 39. This is one of the few blackhouses on Lewis that have been investigated archaeologically. The excavation by Headland Archaeology revealed successive phases of occupation as the building was modified during the last century as estate owners tried to improve living standards. The earliest levels identified an open central hearth with no clear division between the living area and the byre. In later phases, floors were cobbled or flagged and a step was built to separate the areas occupied by humans and animals. The living area was leveled, probably to accommodate box beds and other furniture. Before the roof collapsed the building was used as a weaving shed as evidenced by the presence of a stone- built platform in the central room.

Salar de Talar The Norte Grande (Big North, Far North, Great North) is one of the five natural regions into which CORFO divided continental Chile in 1950. It borders Peru to the north, the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Altiplano, Bolivia and Argentina to the east, and the Copiap√≥ River to the south, beyond which lies the Norte Chico natural region. Geography The Norte Grande, which extends from the Peruvian border to about 27¬∞ south latitude, a line roughly paralleled by the Copiap√≥ river, is extremely arid. It contains the Atacama Desert, one of the driest areas in the world; in certain sections, this desert does not register any rainfall at all. Average monthly temperatures range at sea level between about 20.5 ¬∞C during the summer and about 14 ¬∞C during the winter. Most of the population lives in the coastal area, where the temperatures are more moderate and the humidity higher. The desert region is an elevated arid plateau descending gradually from the Andes towards the coast, where it breaks down abruptly from elevations of 800 to 1500 ft. From the sea this plateau escarpment has the appearance of a range of flat topped hills closely following the coast line. This topography generates coastal microclimates because the fog that frequently forms over the cold ocean waters, as well as any low clouds, is trapped by the high bluffs. This airborne moisture condenses in the spines and leaves of the vegetation, droplets that fall to the ground and irrigate the plants' roots. The fog of this area is known locally as Camanchaca. Beyond the coastal bluffs, there is an area of rolling hills that encompasses the driest desert land; this area ends to the east with the Andes towering over it. This region is rainless, barren and inhospitable, absolutely destitute of vegetation except in some small river valleys where irrigation is possible, and on the slopes of some of the snow-covered peaks where the water from the melting snows nourishes a scanty and coarse vegetation before it disappears in the thirsty sands. It is very rich in mineral and saline deposits, however. This area is broken by ranges of barren hills having the appearance of spurs from the Andes, and by irregular lateral ranges in the vicinity of the main cordillera enclosing elevated saline plateaus. Within the mountain ranges parallel to the main chain of the Andes, the main one is the Cordillera Domeyko and among the salt flats the greater is the Salar de Atacama. The edges of the desert in some sections have subterranean aquifers that have permitted the development of forests made up mainly of tamarugos, spiny trees native to the area that grow to a height of about twenty-five meters. Most of those forests were cut down to fuel the fires of the many foundries established since colonial times to exploit the abundant deposits of copper, silver, and nitrate found in the area. The result was the creation of even drier surface conditions. The eastern parts of this region lie within the higher ranges of the Andes and include a large district. This arid, bleak area is apparently a continuation southward of the great Altiplano, and is known as the Puna de Atacama. Its average elevation is estimated at 11,000 to 12,000 ft. A line of volcanoes crosses it from north to south, and extensive lava beds cover a considerable part of its surface. The chief summits being those of Licancabur, Acamarachi, L√°scar, Mi√±iques, Pular, Socompa, Llullaillaco. Large shallow saline lakes are also characteristic features of this region. The area receives considerable rainfall during the summer months in what is commonly known as the Bolivian Winter, forming shallow lakes of mostly saline waters that are home to a number of bird species, including the flamingo species Andean, Chilean and James. Contrary to the image of monochrome barrenness that most people associate with deserts, the landscape is spectacular, with its crisscrossing hills and mountains of all shapes and sizes, each with a unique color and hue depending on its mineral composition, its distance from the observer, and the time of day. Northward from the Atacama desert core area, some of the water from the altiplano trickles down the Andes in the form of narrow rivers, many of which form oases before being lost to evaporation or absorption into the desert sands, salt beds, and aquifers. However, some rivers do manage to reach into the Pacific, including the Loa River, whose U-shaped course across the desert makes it Chile's longest river. The water rights for one of the rivers, the Lauca River, remain a source of dispute between Bolivia and Chile. These narrow rivers have carved fertile valleys in which an exuberant vegetation creates a stark contrast to the bone-dry hills. In such areas, known locally as Quebradas,Although the term may be translated as Ravine or Gorge, this also refers to a generally intermittent and shallow stream. roads usually are built halfway up the arid elevations in order to maximize the intensive agricultural use of the irrigated land. They offer spectacular panoramic vistas, along with the harrowing experience of driving along the edges of cliffs. The Quebradas separate extensive plains called Pampas. The major of those is the Pampa del Tamarugal. In the Norte Grande, the kinds of fruits that grow well in the arid tropics thrive, and all kinds of vegetables can be grown year-round, noticeably in Azapa Valley. However, the region's main economic foundation is its great mineral wealth. For instance, Chuquicamata and Escondida. The former is the world's largest open-pit copper mine and the latter is the copper open- pit mine with the largest production in the world. Since the early 1970s, the fishing industry has also developed enormously in the main ports of the area, most notably Arica, Iquique and Antofagasta.

He is known for hosting a variety of TV programs featuring fashion and interior design. Early life Verdi was born and raised in suburban Maplewood, New Jersey. His mother, a Portuguese immigrant, was a skilled dressmaker, and his father was a chef. Verdi developed his sensibilities in suburban New Jersey where he defied the norm to set-out on a career as a trained goldsmith. He gained a degree from New York‚Äôs Fashion Institute of Technology. He had jewelry showcases in Manhattan‚Äôs Barney‚Äôs, Bendel's, Bloomingdales and Bergdorf Goodman. Career In the early 1990s, Verdi redirected his pursuits towards a career in television. Troubled by the fact that the fashion reporter on Gay Entertainment Television was a straight woman, Verdi contacted the network, which led to his first job in television. A 1998 article in The New York Times is quoted as saying about Verdi, ‚ÄúIn the style universe, where fashion, decorating and the media are usually on different planets, Mr. Verdi travels comfortably between them. He is a jack- of-all-trades in a world where good taste and an instinct for the Now can be a passport across boundaries.‚Äù Verdi has worked with many celebrities. He planned the 1996 wedding of fashion designer Cynthia Rowley to sculptor Bill Keenan. He also designed the New York apartments of Sandra Bernhard, Hugh Jackman, Mariska Hargitay and Bobby Flay. In 2000, Verdi co-created and co- hosted Full Frontal Fashion on the now-defunct network Metro TV. The show was the first of its kind to air complete coverage of runway fashion shows. In 2002, Verdi began co-hosting Surprise by Design. On the show, Verdi or his co- host, Rebecca Cole, would redesign a room or exterior space at someone‚Äôs home in order to surprise a loved one. The homeowner would assist in the re-design, which would happen on a $2,500 budget, in one day, typically while their loved one was away at work. The show became the Discovery Channel‚Äôs highest rated daytime show. Verdi hosted Fashion Police, a weekly series about celebrity fashion, when it was on the Style Network. He is frequently a guest on a variety of talk and news programs such as The View, Live with Regis & Kelly, The Today Show and VH1‚Äôs The Fabulous Life Of. Additionally, Verdi is a stylist for Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria, and has designed two of her Los Angeles, California homes. He was the designer for her July 7, 2007 wedding in Paris, France to basketball star Tony Parker. Verdi has appeared since 2008 as a celebrity judge on the TV Land series, She's Got the Look where women over 35 compete for a modeling contract and magazine spread. In 2010, Verdi starred in his self-titled show, The Robert Verdi Show, in which he styled celebrities and ran amok with bizarre ideas he threw at his crew of personal assistants. The show aired for one season on the LGBT TV channel Logo. In February 2012, Verdi launched an affordable sunglasses collection under his name which sold exclusively on HSN. In June 2015, Brides Gone Styled premiered on TLC, with Verdi and Gretta Monahan co-hosting.

In 1994, he was the only American who chose to remain in the country after the Rwandan genocide began. Since 1978, when he first went to Africa as part of a college volunteer program, Wilkens had already spent 13 years working on the continent. After training as a high-school teacher, he later went back to night school and earned an MBA at the University of Baltimore. Career=Beginning of the genocide In early 1994, Wilkens was in Rwanda with his wife and three children. As the Rwandan genocide began, he sent them with a U.S. convoy to Burundi (U.S. officials were afraid to use Kigali's airport, so they evacuated their citizens by cars) and stayed in his home in Kigali. Wilkens knew that he could not leave his friends, many of whom were Tutsis. His family had hired two workers who were Tutsi, Juan and Anita, to help out around the house. He feared that they may be harmed if he did not stay. His decision was made during conversations with his wife, Teresa, recalling that \\"Teresa and I would go back to the bedroom and we would talk, because we had made a decision that I wouldn't evacuate. We would pray, and I'd say, 'Does this still seem right?' and she said, 'Yes, it does'.\\" Wilkens stayed in Rwanda even as others fled, including many high ranking U.S. officials. No one was more surprised by his decision to remain in Rwanda than the Rwandan people. Thomas Kayumba, Carl's co-worker, said that \\"All the foreigners left, but not Wilkens. He was still young. To take leave of his little children and his wife, to give himself to the Rwandan people, I don‚Äôt know how to explain it.\\" Gisimba Orphanage The first three weeks were spent in his house with trustworthy Tutsi's seeking refuge, but when there was a possibility to go out and do anything to people, who were slaughtered every day, sometimes just meters away, he gave his all to help them. Wilkens saved about 400 people from the Gisimba Orphanage. One day, when Carl arrived at Gisimba, he saw more than 50 armed militiamen who were waiting for an occasion to kill everyone inside the orphanage. His presence there stopped anyone from being killed. Wilkens decided to sleep with the kids that night to make sure they were safe. He stayed there until, using all his connections, he found four guards to guard the people inside the orphanage. He jumped into his car to find the governor, who could help him to save the orphans. When he was in his office, the Hutu prime minister Jean Kambanda, was there and someone told Wilkens to ask him for help. Wilkens described the situation with these words: \\"'Ask him?' It's like that's the stupidest thing you could imagine - to ask this guy who is obviously orchestrating the genocide, a key player, and yet I have no other options. ‚Ä¶ [He's like], 'Just go out in the hallway. He's in the next office. When he comes out, ask him.\\" So I went out [into the hallway] ‚Ä¶ and [a] door opens. Everybody snaps to attention, and here comes [the prime minister] and his little entourage. They're coming down the hall, and I am, too. I put my hand out and I said, 'Mr. Prime Minister, I'm Carl Wilkins, the director of ADRA.' He stops and he looks at me, and then he takes my hand and shakes it and said, 'Yes, I've heard about you and your work. How is it?' I said, 'Well, honestly, sir, it's not very good right now. The orphans at Gisimba are surrounded, and I think there's going to be a massacre, if there hasn't been already.' He turns around, talks to some of his aides or whatever, [and he turns back to me and] he says, 'We're aware of the situation, and those orphans are going to be safe. I'll see to it.'\\" And it worked; the prime minister agreed to make sure that nothing would happen to the orphans. But Wilkens, who was afraid of another militiamen attempt to kill people inside Gisimba, decided to move survivors to a safe haven - the Saint Michel Cathedral. Again, he used his connections and in few days, he organized two buses and a military escort, which was to help them to get through the most dangerous roadblocks. Wilkens negotiated with armed men on the way to the cathedral. In the end, everyone on the buses was transported to Saint Michel alive and unharmed. Vatier Orphanage and Nyamirambo Adventist Church This was a quite similar situation to that in Gisimba. The orphanage was run by a Frenchman, , and before April 1994 its main goal was to take care of 16 HIV-positive orphans. But during the genocide it was a hiding place for about 100 children. They did not have drinking water and were running out of food and it was just then that Wilkens appeared, bringing most needed supplies. None of the children spoke English nor did Carl speak Kinyarwanda, so at first children who did not know his name called him: ADRA SOS (it was written on his car). When the situation became critical (there was fighting going on between RPF and Hutu army in the area where orphanage was situated), again Wilkens tried to relocate survivors to Saint Michel Cathedral. His obstinacy allowed him to do it once again. People from the orphanage were safe. He did the same for 12 survivors from Adventist Church in Nyamirambo. They were transported to the safe haven in H√¥tel des Mille Collines. Wilkens reminisces that the situation during genocide was very complex, and that he was working often on the edge of law and morality: \\"I was in so many positions that could have been interpreted as compromising or even collaborating with the enemy. ‚Ä¶ Who's going to believe someone who goes to court and says, 'Well, actually I asked [the prime minister] to help me save some Tutsis?' Who's going to believe that? The stuff in the genocide just turns.\\" Wilkens negotiated to save lives with Col. Tharcisse Renzaho - governor of Kigali and with prime minister Jean Kambanda later sentenced to life imprisonment by International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). General Romeo Dallaire faced a same dilemma, debating whether it was morally acceptable to \\"shake hands with the Devil\\" in order to save someone's life. However, the effects of such negotiations - thousands of saved human lives - made some feel that it was worthy to pay the price. After RPF's victory When the units of Rwandan Patriotic Front took over Kigali on July 4, 1994, it was not still the end of service for Wilkens. Asked by RPF's officials, he helped distribute water, food and supplies to inhabitants of Kigali. It was the case of for example Saint Andre College in Nyamirambo (where there were about 12,000 people) and Kacyiru camp for the internally displaced. He also tried to find all his ADRA co-workers. Many times, such actions ended with a happy end. One of the most moving moments took place near Gitarama, when he found Amiel Gahima: \\"As we walked past the town of Gitarama towards Kigali, I abruptly saw a pick up truck with the ADRA flag. The vehicle suddenly stopped as it approached us. I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes when I saw Carl Wilkens coming towards me from the vehicle. As he saw me, emaciated and frail, carrying my three-year-old son on my shoulders, he was in tears.\\" Return to Rwanda and present day When he finally ended his mission, he went back to the United States. But in 1995 he, his wife Teresa and their 3 children returned to Rwanda and for the next 18 months Wilkens worked for the Adventist Church on reconstruction projects. Since 1996, Wilkens has been living in the U.S. and he became an Adventist pastor and is working in Milo Adventist Academy in Days Creek, Oregon. He visits Rwanda from time to time to see his friends and co-workers. When he was giving a sermon in Kigali in December 2005, crowd of over 3,000 people attended his service. Wilkens tours the United States to speak to students, teachers, and parents about his experience in Rwanda. He has spoken at schools such as Clarke Central High School in Athens, Georgia, Mission San Jose High School in Fremont, California, St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute, Glenbrook North Highschool in Northbrook, Illinois, Avon High School in Connecticut and at Elon University in Elon, North Carolina. During his talks, he describes his experiences in Rwanda, and how to stay positive by doing things such as creating new brain pathways. On 25 January 2012, Wilkens spoke to high school students at Al Yasmina school in Abu Dhabi of his experiences in Rwanda, and promoted his new book. Wilkens also spoke during the 2014 GIN Abu Dhabi Conference in NYU Abu Dhabi, to a group of high school and university students. On 26‚Äì27 April 2014, Wilkens spoke to students at several international schools in Taipei of his experiences in Rwanda, and was selling his book during a Model United Nations conference.

Its northern border is formed by the limit with the Far North, to the west lies the Pacific Ocean, to the east the Andes mountains and Argentina, and to the south the Zona Central natural region. Although from a strictly geographic point of view, this natural region corresponds to the Chilean territory between the rivers Copiap√≥ and Aconcagua, traditionally the Norte Chico refers to the zone comprising the regions of Atacama and Coquimbo. This region was home to the Diaguita people.  Geography  The near north (Norte Chico) extends from the southern border of the Atacama Desert to about 32¬∞ south latitude, or just north of Santiago. It is a semiarid region whose central area receives an average of about 25 mm of rain during each of the four winter months, with trace amounts the rest of the year. The near north is also subject to droughts. The temperatures are moderate, with an average of 18.5 ¬∞C during the summer and about 12 ¬∞C during the winter at sea level. The winter rains and the melting of the snow that accumulates on the Andes produce rivers whose flow varies with the seasons, but which carry water year round. The slopes of the Andes are precipitous, the general surface is rough, and in the north the higher ground and coast are still barren. Elqui valley As in the far north, the coastal areas of the near north have a distinct microclimate. In those sections where the airborne moisture of the sea is trapped by high bluffs overlooking the ocean, Valdivian temperate rainforest develop as the vegetation precipitates the vapor in the form of a misty rain. Notable examples can be found in the Bosque de Fray Jorge National Park. Because the river valleys provide breaks in the coastal elevations, maritime moisture can penetrate inland and further decrease the generally arid climate in those valleys. The higher elevations in the interior sections are covered with shrubs and cacti of various kinds. Cerro Tololo Norte Chico is a highly mountainous district where distinct ranges or elongated spurs cross the country from the Andes to the coast, forming transverse valleys of great beauty and fertility. The most famous of these is the Elqui Valley. The deep transverse valleys provide broad areas for cattle raising and, most important, fruit growing, an activity that has developed greatly since the mid-1970s. Nearly all Chilean pisco is produced in the near north (Chilean laws defines the pisco as a drink produced in the Near North). The cultivation of the soil becomes possible, at first through irrigation and then with the aid of light periodical rains. Some areas of Norte Chico feature a very dry air and negligible cloud cover, which make them an excellent location for telescopes. Notable astronomical observatories in the district include Cerro Tololo Inter- American Observatory and La Silla Observatory. The Andes of Norte Chico are home to the first, second and fourth mountain highest in Chile. Corresponding respectively to Ojos del Salado, Nevado Tres Cruces and Nevado de Incahuasi. Copiap√≥.  Hydrography  Rivers = The principal rivers of this natural region are Copiap√≥, Huasco, Elqui, Limar√≠ and Choapa. The Copiap√≥, which once discharged into the sea, is now practically exhausted in irrigating a small fertile valley in which stands the city of that name. The Copiap√≥ and Huasco rivers have comparatively short courses, but they receive a considerable volume of water from the higher sierras. The latter is also used to irrigate a small, cultivated valley. The rivers of the region of Coquimbo (the Elqui, Limar√≠ and Choapa) exist under less arid conditions, and like those of the northern portion of the Valpara√≠so Region (namely: Petorca, La Ligua and Aconcagua), are used to irrigate a much larger area of cultivated territory. Goat husbandry is common through Norte Chico, however it produces severe erosion and desertification.

It is bordered by the Hartford neighborhood to the north, Route 10 to the east, Johnston and Cranston on the West and separated from Olneyville by Route 6. Like Federal Hill, Silver Lake was traditionally an Italian-American neighborhood. Since the mid-1990s, Silver Lake has undergone a radical transformation into a largely Hispanic neighborhood, as evidenced by the recent influx of Central American restaurants, bars and markets.  History  Settlement in Silver Lake began after the completion of the Plainfield Road to Plainfield, Connecticut in 1710. Farmers settled the area shortly afterward. Isolated from the rest of Providence, some sought to secede from Providence before the town of Johnston, Rhode Island annexed Silver Lake in 1759.Providence Neighborhoods: Silver Lake Silver Lake took its name from the original lake located in the area bordered by Murray, Sybil, Mercy and Plainfield Streets. At the turn of the 20th century, it was graded with landfill and debris then became the site of a supermarket and bank for many years. Suburban development in the 19th century led Providence to reacquire Silver Lake in 1898. Shortly thereafter, Silver Lake witnessed its most significant period of development in the early 20th century prior to the Great Depression. From the late 19th century until the 1970s the neighborhood was predominately Italian with Irish, Polish, English and a mix of other European immigrants.  Demographics  In 1990, nearly 43% of Silver Lake residents claimed some Italian ancestry. That same census showed that about 7% of Silver Lake's residents Hispanic, 2.3% were Asian, and 2% were African-American. Median family income in Silver Lake was $27,736, about 2% lower than the citywide average. 16% of families lived in poverty. According to the 2000 census, 10,943 persons resided in Silver Lake, an increase from the 9,141 residents who called Silver Lake home in 1990. Between 1990 and 2000 the percentage of non-white residents in Silver Lake rose from 11 percent to 57.6 percent. 42 percent of Silver Lake's residents were Hispanic; 42% were White; 3.7 percent were Asian; and 8 percent were African-American. In 2000, more than half (58%) of the residents of age 25 or older were high school graduates. 59% of children under the age of six speak a language other than English as their primary language.Bot generated title --> Housing tenure in Silver Lake has remained mostly unchanged over the past decade. The proportion of owner-occupied housing units declined slightly from 36.6 percent to 35 percent between 1990 and 2000. About a fifth of all housing units in Silver Lake are single-family units, and most other structures house two to four families. 8 percent of all housing units in Silver Lake are located in buildings with five or more housing units, reflecting the more suburban character of much of the neighborhood. The median family income was $27,981, below the citywide average of $32,058. 28% of families were below the poverty level while 15% receive some form of public assistance. 18% of children under the age of six had been exposed to high levels of lead.  Government  Over half of Silver Lake is within Ward 7, which is represented in the Providence City Council by Democrat John J. Igliozzi.Providence City Council - Phone: (401) 521-7477 The eastern portion of Silver Lake is within Ward 15, represented by Democrat Sabina Matos.Official website of the Providence City Council - Councilwoman Sabina Matos  Parks  Neutaconkanut Park Neutaconkanut Park occupies most of Silver Lake between Plainfield Street and the border with Johnston. It is a park with baseball fields, basketball courts, public pool and recreation center as well as forest and walking trails.Citywide Green There are four small memorial parks near the intersection of Silver Lake and Pocasset Avenue. They are: *Ponte Corvo Memorial at the corner of Pocasset Avenue and Laurel Hill Avenue. *Cerbo Square Memorial on Murray Street near the intersection of Murray and Silver Lake Avenue. *Scalabrini Piazza on Silver Lake Avenue at the site of the bell tower left standing at the original St Bartholomew's Church (now located 1/3 mile away, atop Laurel Hill). *Silver Lake Memorial Park is a small war memorial at the corner of Pocasset Avenue and Union Avenue. Cultural attractions Silver Lake features the Feast of Saint Bartholomew, a church feast which includes a solemn procession, games, rides, and foods from both Italian-American and Hispanic cuisines respectively. The feast lasts three days and is held every year in August. In 1907, the original Saint Bartholomew Church (then located on Moorefield Street) was dedicated. The church was built by the Italian immigrants in the neighborhood, who in large part had lived in Vairano Patenora, Caserta, Campania in Southern Italy before settling in Silver Lake. The Church is named in honor of La Parrochia di San Bartolomeo (Saint Bartholomew Parish) located in Vairano Patenora. Throughout the years, the size of the parish increased greatly so in 1969, a new and larger Church was built next to the Parish School on Laurel Hill Avenue. Notable people * Joseph A.

Along with Axwell Tiberius, she is one of the two primary characters in Adams' Dark Horse Comics series Monkeyman and O'Brien. Publication history Ann O'Brien was created by writer/artist Art Adams, who conceived of Monkeyman & O'Brien as series that would enable him to draw monsters similar to the classic movie monsters that he enjoyed in his youth, like Godzilla, King Kong and the Universal Monsters.George Khoury and Eric Nolen-Weathington.

G-Fan. pp. 22 - 25. Adams named O'Brien in tribute to Fay Wray's character, Ann Darrow, from King Kong and that film's special effects creator Willis O'Brien, The character debuted in Dark Horse Presents #80 (December 1993) in a story titled \\"A Monkeyman & O'Brien Adventure: Tortorus\\". She next appeared in a backup story entitled \\"Who Are Monkeyman and O'Brien?\\" in Mike Mignola's 1994 series Hellboy: Seed of Destruction. The character made further appearances in several short stories in Dark Horse Presents, a three book limited series titled Monkeyman and O'Brien (1996), and a crossover miniseries Gen 13/Monkeyman and O'Brien (1998). The character's last published appearance was in 1999 in a comic strip in Dark Horse Extra, newspaper style comics fanzine. Fictional character biography Ann Darrow O'Brien is the daughter of eminent scientist and explorer, Professor William S. O'Brien. Missing for two years, Professor O'Brien left his daughter Ann and her assistant Akiko Oki living in his palatial Bay Area estate. To the surprise of many, the young Ann had been keeping the estate solvent. Ann's amoral half-sister Oniko (who left the family 15 years earlier to join a mysterious criminal enterprise) and her two henchmen invade the estate to take it over. The sisters have a brawl in an unused dimensional transportation chamber, and Ann accidentally hits a button that kicks off a \\"life form retrieval beam.\\" The chamber explodes as it summons the giant, simian genius Axewell Tiberius, who's combating an unknown, ape-like enemy. The henchmen escape with Oniko and the still-living head of Tiberius' enemy, while Ann and Akiko befriend Tiberius and give him a place in the estate's library. O'Brien discovers that the blast in the chamber had released a mysterious radiation that affects both her and Oniko. Immediately after the explosion, her eyes turn orange‚Äîthe same color as Tiberius's. The next night, she needs almost no sleep to feel refreshed. The next day she finds that her sneakers no longer fit her feet: \\"I was growing faster than a teenager!\\" She performs better and better at physical tasks, lifting tons of free weights and at one point making a 60-mile run in 30 minutes without much effort. She frets a little about the ongoing growth spurts (wasting plenty of money on clothes that become too small in 24 hours), but finally settles in at seven feet tall and 250 pounds. Her new strength, size, and knowledge (from working alongside Tiberius) transform O'Brien from an estate manager to a renowned and fearless adventurer. She joins Tiberius in a series of 1960s-inspired adventures, only a few of which are delineated in the comics. (Author/artist Adams makes references to more adventures, like the \\"Shrieking Bin-Yak,\\" which are never seen by the readers.) Her eventual goal: Help Tiberius find a way to his home world dimension. Personality and powers O'Brien has superhuman strength, superhuman speed, superhuman durability, superhuman agility, superhuman stamina, invulnerability, and the ability to heal quickly from injury. Her strength increases when she get very angry. In a crossover with Gen 13, she was able to defeat an evil version of Caitlin Fairchild with some ease - she had to hold back some of her strength so as not to kill her. Fairchild has many feats with which she could be listed in a \\"Class 100\\" level of strength. This would mean O'brien is above this level as well. In Monkeyman and O'Brien #3 she is bitten by the Shrewmanoid, bleeds, and then heals within seconds.

Central Chile (Zona central) is one of the five natural regions into which CORFO divided continental Chile in 1950. It is home to a majority of the Chilean population and includes the three largest metropolitan areas‚ÄîSantiago, Valpara√≠so, and Concepci√≥n. It extends from 32¬∞ south latitude to 37¬∞ south latitude. Geography Central Chile is one of the five main geographical zones in which Chile is divided. The Chilean Central Valley lies between the Coastal range (\\"Cordillera de la Costa\\") and the Andes Mountains. To the north is the semi-desert region known as El Norte Chico, (the \\"little north\\"), which lies between 28¬∞ and 32¬∞ south latitude. To the south lies the cooler and wetter Valdivian temperate rain forests ecoregion, in Los Lagos Region; (the latter includes most of South America's temperate rain forests). The Central valley is a fertile region and the agricultural heartland of Chile. Climate Endangered Chilean Wine Palms in La Campana National Park Quillota, Re√±aca, Pichidangui , Aconcagua Valley Valparaiso,Talagante, Santiago, San Antonio Chimbarongo, Rancagua The climate is of the temperate Mediterranean type, with the amount of rainfall increasing considerably and progressively from north to south. In the Santiago area, the average monthly temperatures are about in the summer months of January and February and in the winter months of June and July. The average monthly precipitation is no more than a trace in January and February and in June and July. By contrast, in Concepci√≥n the average monthly temperatures are somewhat lower in the summer at but higher in the winter at , and the amount of rain is much greater. In the summer, Concepci√≥n receives an average of twenty millimeters of rain per month; in June and July, the city is pounded by an average of per month. The numerous rivers greatly increase their flow as a result of the winter rains and the spring melting of the Andean snows, and they contract considerably in the summer. The combination of abundant snow in the Andes and relatively moderate winter temperatures creates excellent conditions for Alpine skiing. The annual mean temperature in Santiago is . The temperate action of the ocean prevents temperatures from dropping drastically, and if snow falls in the area it does not usually stay on the ground for more than a few hours. In Santiago the annual rainfall is and in Valpara√≠so, it amounts to . Along the Central Valley rainfall increases gradually southward until it reaches in Concepci√≥n. Topography Talca, Linares Chill√°n, Tom√© Nacimiento, Concepci√≥n, Los Angeles Temuco, Puerto Saavedra, Isla Mocha The topography of central Chile includes a coastal range of mountains running parallel to the Andes. Lying between the two mountain ranges is the so-called Central Valley, which contains some of the richest agricultural land in the country, especially in its northern portion. The area just north and south of Santiago is a large producer of fruits, including the grapes from which the best Chilean wines are made. Exports of fresh fruit began to rise dramatically in the mid-1970s because Chilean growers had the advantage of being able to reach markets in the Northern Hemisphere during that part of the world's winter. Most of these exports, such as grapes, apples, and peaches, go by refrigerator ships, but some, such as berries, go by air freight. The southern portion of central Chile contains a mixture of some excellent agricultural lands, many of which were covered originally with old-growth forests. They were cleared for agriculture but were soon exhausted of their organic matter and left to erode. Large tracts of this worn-out land, many of them on hilly terrain, have been reforested for the lumber, especially for the cellulose and paper industries. New investments during the 1980s in these industries transformed the rural economy of the region. The pre-Andean highlands and some of the taller and more massive mountains in the coastal range (principally the Cordillera de Nahuelbuta) still contain large tracts of old-growth forests of remarkable beauty, some of which have been set aside as national parks. Between the coastal mountains and the ocean, many areas of central Chile contain stretches of land that are lower than the Central Valley and are generally quite flat. The longest beaches can be found in such sections. Demography and economy Chile's vineyards are found on flat land within the foothills of the Andes. The following regions are traditionally considered as being part of Chile's central Valley: * V Region of Valpara√≠so * The Metropolitan Region of Santiago * VI Region of the Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins * VII Region of the Maule * VIII Region of the Biob√≠o Historically, the Central valley has been the heartland of the country with the highest concentration of population (two thirds of the country's population) and, in addition, the area where the greater proportion of the economic productivity of the country is concentrated. Its economy is characterized by its diversity and the strongest pillars lie in the use of natural resources, through the copper mining, logging, agriculture and wine producing, fishing, and manufacturing sector. The main cities are: Santiago, Valpara√≠so, Vi√±a del Mar, Quilpu√©, Villa Alemana, Quillota, Puente Alto, San Antonio, Melipilla, Rancagua, Curic√≥, Talca, Linares, Chill√°n, Concepci√≥n, Talcahuano, Coronel and Los √Ångeles.

Ohmefentanyl is one of the most potent Œº-opioid receptor agonists known, comparable to super-potent opioids such as carfentanil and etorphine which are only legally used for tranquilizing large animals such as elephants in veterinary medicine. In mouse studies, the most active isomer 3R,4S,Œ≤S-ohmefentanyl was 28 times more powerful as a painkiller than fentanyl, the chemical from which it is derived, and 6300 times more powerful than morphine. Ohmefentanyl has three stereogenic centers and eight stereoisomers, which are named F9201‚ÄìF9208. Researchers are studying the different pharmaceutical properties of these isomers. The 4‚Ä≥-fluoro analogue (i.e., substituted on the phenethyl ring) of the 3R,4S,Œ≤S isomer of ohmefentanyl is one of the most potent opioid agonists yet discovered, possessing an analgesic potency approximately 18,000 times that of morphine. Other analogues with potency higher than that of ohmefentanyl itself include the 2‚Ä≤-fluoro derivative (i.e., substituted on the aniline phenyl ring), and derivatives where the N-propionyl group was replaced by N-methoxyacetyl or 2-furamide groups, or a carboethoxy group is added to the 4-position of the piperidine ring. The latter is listed as being up to 30,000 times more potent than morphine. Side effects of fentanyl analogues are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression, which can be life-threatening. Illicitly used fentanyl analogues have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear. Molecular structure of four ohmefentanyl isomers Synthesis The synthesis of ohmefentanyl is more complex than the synthesis of fentanyl and some of its related analogues, requiring more reagents, equipment, and time compared to the synthesis of fentanyl. The synthesis of ohmefentanyl is accomplished starting from 1-Benzyl-3-methyl-4-piperidinone from which the imine is formed by reaction with aniline. The obtained imine is reduced using sodium borohydride to yield the amine which is then reacted with propionic anhydride. In the next step of the synthesis, the benzyl protecting group is removed from the piperidine ring by catalytic hydrogenation to give the secondary amine which is then reacted with 2-bromoacetophenone, after which the ketone is reduced with sodium borohydride to form ohmefentanyl.

Born in Genoa into well-to-do family, he first studied classic literature, but moved into an apprenticeship with the painter Bernardo Strozzi, then Giovanni Andrea Ansaldo. He worked for some years in Florence, where he copied many of the works of Andrea del Sarto. Returning to Genoa (about 1625), he painted mainly for private customers. He worked also in Corsica (at that time part of the Republic of Genoa), where he painted locally influential paintings for some churches around Bastia.

Although the lytic activity of some microbe-derived hemolysins on red blood cells may be of great importance for nutrient acquisition, many hemolysins produced by pathogens do not cause significant destruction of red blood cells during infection. However, hemolysins are often capable of lysing red blood cells in vitro. While most hemolysins are protein compounds, some are lipid biosurfactants.  Properties  Many bacteria produce hemolysins that can be detected in the laboratory. It is now believed that many clinically relevant fungi also produce hemolysins. Hemolysins can be identified by their ability to lyse red blood cells in vitro. Hemolysis by Streptococcus seen on a plate Not only are the erythrocytes affected by hemolysins, but there are also some effects among other blood cells, such as leucocytes (white blood cells). Escherichia coli hemolysin is potentially cytotoxic to monocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages, leading them to autolysis and death. Visualization of hemolysis (UK: haemolysis) of red blood cells in agar plates facilitates the categorization of Streptococcus.  Mechanism  One way hemolysin lyses erythrocytes is by forming pores in phospholipid bilayers. Other hemolysins lyse erythrocytes by hydrolyzing the phospholipids in the bilayer.  Pore formation  Many hemolysins are pore-forming toxins (PFT), which are able to cause the lysis of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets by producing pores on the cytoplasmic membrane. Hemolysin is normally secreted by the bacteria in a water-soluble way. These monomers diffuse to the target cells and are attached to them by specific receivers. After this is done, they oligomerize, creating ring-shaped heptamer complexes. Hemolysins can be secreted by many different kinds of bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli or Vibrio parahemolyticus among other pathogens. We can take a look at the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus as a specific example of pore-forming hemolysin production. Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogen that causes many infectious diseases such as pneumonia and sepsis. It produces a ring-shaped complex called a staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin pore. In nature, Staphylococcus aureus secretes alpha-hemolysin monomers that bind to the outer membrane of susceptible cells. Upon binding, the monomers oligomerize to form a water- filled transmembrane channel that facilitates uncontrolled permeation of water, ions, and small organic molecules. Rapid discharge of vital molecules such as ATP, dissipation of the membrane potential and ion gradients, and irreversible osmotic swelling leading to the cell wall rupture (lysis) can cause death of the host cell. This pore consists of seven alpha-hemolysin subunits, which represent the major cytotoxic agent that is freed by this kind of bacterium. These subunits are attached to the target cells, the way we have already explained, and extend the lipid bilayer, forming the pore structures. These pores in the cellular membrane will eventually end up causing cell death, since it allows the exchange of monovalent ions that would cause the DNA fragmentation.  Enzymatic  Some hemolysins damage the erythrocyte membrane by cleaving the phospholipids in the membrane.  Staphylococcus aureus hemolysins  Œ±-hemolysin = Alpha(Œ±)-hemolysin of Staphylococcus aureus: macromolecular structure of the transmembrane pore. Secreted by Staphylococcus aureus, this toxin causes cell death by binding with the outer membrane, with subsequent oligomerization of the toxin monomer and water-filled channels. These are responsible for osmotic phenomena, cell depolarization, and loss of vital molecules (v.gr. ATP), leading to its demise. = Œ≤-hemolysin = Œ≤-hemolysin (hlb; ) is a Phospholipase C toxin secreted by S. aureus. Upon investigating sheep erythrocytes, its toxic mechanism was discovered to be the hydrolysis of a specific membrane lipid, sphingomyelin, which accounts for 50% of the cell‚Äôs membrane. This degradation was followed by a noticeable rise of phosphoryl-choline due to the release of organic phosphorus from sphingomyelin and ultimately caused cell lysis. = Œ≥-Hemolysin = Œ≥-Hemolysins are pore-forming toxins in the same family as Œ±-Hemolysin. They are unique in that they come in two components, and hence are referred to as bi-component toxins (). Compared to beta-hemolysin, it has a higher affinity for phosphocholines with short saturated acyl chains, especially if they have a conical form, whereas cylindrical lipids (e.g., sphingomyelin) hinder its activity. The lytic process, most commonly seen in leucocytes, is caused by pore formation induced by an oligomerized octamer that organizes in a ring structure. Once the prepore is formed, a more stable one ensues, named Œ≤-barrel. In this final part, the octamer binds with phosphatidylcholine.  Structure  The structure of several hemolysins has been solved by X-ray crystallography in the soluble and pore-forming conformations. For example, Œ±-hemolysin of Staphylococcus aureus forms a homo- heptameric Œ≤-barrel in biological membranes. The Vibrio cholerae cytolysin; also forms a heptameric pore, however Staphylococcus aureus Œ≥-hemolysin; forms a pore that is octameric. The heptamer of Œ±-hemolysin from Staphylococcus aureus has a mushroom-like shape and measures up to 100 √Ö in diameter and 100 √Ö in height. A membrane-spanning, solvent-accessible channel runs along the sevenfold axis and ranges from 14 √Ö to 46 √Ö in diameter. On the exterior of the 14-strand antiparallel Œ≤ barrel there is a hydrophobic belt approximately 30 √Ö in width that provides a surface complementary to the nonpolar portion of the lipid bilayer. The interfaces are composed of both salt-links and hydrogen bonds, as well as hydrophobic interactions, and these contacts provide a molecular stability for the heptamer in SDS solutions even up to 65 ¬∞C.  Role during infection  Hemolysins are thought to be responsible for many events in host cells. For example, iron may be a limiting factor in the growth of various pathogenic bacteria. Since free iron may generate damaging free radicals, free iron is typically maintained at low concentrations within the body. Red blood cells are rich in iron-containing heme. Lysis of these cells releases heme into the surroundings, allowing the bacteria to take up the free iron. But hemolysin is related to bacteria not only in this way but also in some others. As mentioned before, hemolysin is a potential virulence factor produced by microorganisms, which can put a human's health at risk. Despite causing some severe pathologies, many cases of hemolysis do not suppose a health hazard. But the fact that hemolysins (produced by pathogenic microorganisms during infections) are combined with other virulence factors may threaten a human's life to a greater extent. The main consequence of hemolysis is hemolytic anemia, condition that involves the destruction of erythrocytes and their later removal from the bloodstream, earlier than expected in a normal situation. As the bone marrow cannot make erythrocytes fast enough to meet the body‚Äôs needs, oxygen does not arrive to body tissues properly. As a consequence, some symptoms may appear, such as fatigue, pain, arrhythmias, an enlarged heart or even heart failure, among others. Depending on the type of hemolysin and the microorganism that produces it, manifestation of symptoms and diseases may differ from one case to the other: * Alpha-hemolysin from uropathogenic E. coli produces extra-intestinal infections and can cause cystitis, pyelonephritis, and sepsis. Alpha-hemolysin from Staphylococcus aureus can cause severe diseases, such as pneumonia. * Aerolysin from Aeromonas sobria infects the intestinal tract, but it might also cause sepsis and meningitis. * Listeriolysin from Listeria monocytogenes (a facultative intracellular bacterium that thrives within host cells, mainly macrophages and monocytes) causes the degradation of phagosome membranes, but they are not a potential danger for the cell‚Äôs plasmatic membrane. Both aerolysin and alpha-hemolysin are synthetized by extracellular bacteria, which infect specific tissue surfaces. Hemolysins have proved to be a damaging factor for vital organs, through the activity of Staphylococcus aureus. S.aureus is a dangerous pathogen that may lead cells to necrotizing infections usually recognized by a massive inflammatory response leading to tissue damage or even tissue destruction. There is a clear example of this: the pneumonia produced by S.aureus. In this case, it has been proven that alpha-hemolysin takes part in inducing necrotic pulmonary injury by the use of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is responsible for inflammatory processes and of pyroptosis. Pneumonia caused by S.aureus is a common disease in some areas, which is the reason for the many studies in the field of immunology aimed at developing new farmacs to cure easily or prevent this kind of pneumonia. At the moment, apiegnin and beta-cyclodextrin are thought to alleviate S.aureus pneumonia, whereas the antibodies of anti alpha-hemlysin are thought to give protection. Further findings show that the main virulence factor of S. aureus, the pore-forming toxin Œ±-hemolysin (Hla), is the secreted factor responsible for the activation of an alternative autophagic pathway. It has been demonstrated that this autophagic response is inhibited by artificially elevating the intracellular levels of cAMP. This process is also mediated by the exchange factors RAPGEF3 and RAP2B. Another interesting point is that pretreatment of leukocytes with doses of alpha-hemolysin at which nearly 80% of the cells survived decreased the ability of the cells to phagocytize bacteria and particles and to undergo chemotaxis. Premature activation of leukocytes and inhibition of phagocytosis and chemotaxis by alpha-hemolysin, if they occur in vivo, would greatly enhance the survival of an E. coli attack. Some hemolysins, such as listeriolysin O, allow bacteria to evade the immune system by escaping from phagosomes. Hemolysins may also mediate bacterial escape from host cells.  Regulation of gene expression  The regulation of gene expression of hemolysins (such as streptolysin S) is a system repressed in the presence of iron. This ensures that hemolysin is produced only when needed. The regulation of the production of hemolysin in S.aureus(expression of hemolysin) is now possible due to in-vitro mutations that are related to serine/threonine kinase and phosphatase.  Treatment  As hemolysins are produced by pathogenic organisms, the main treatment is the intake of antibiotics specific to the pathogen that have caused the infection. Moreover, some hemolysins may be neutralized by the action of anti-hemolysin antibodies, preventing a longer and more dangerous effect of hemolysis within the body. When blood cells are being destroyed too fast, extra folic acid and iron supplements may be given or, in case of emergencies, a blood transfusion. In rare cases, the spleen must be removed because it filters blood and removes from the bloodstream dead or damaged cells, worsening the lack of erythrocytes.  Applications = Medicine  Thermostable Direct Hemolysin (TDH; ) produced by Vibrio parahaemolyticus is now being studied in the field of oncology. It regulates cell proliferation in colon carcinoma cells. TDH induces Ca2+ influx from an extracellular environment accompanied by protein kinase C phosphorylation. Activated protein kinase C inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the rational target of anti-colorectal cancer therapy.  Biotechnology  Œ±-Hemolysin has been utilized to conduct nanopore sequencing of DNA. It has also been used to form pores on cellular plasma membrane to deplete cellular Nucleotides.

The relationship, largely driven by the nations' common interests as maritime countries on the edge of Europe and close to larger continental neighbours, dates back to the Middle Ages in 1373 with the Anglo- Portuguese Alliance. The two countries now enjoy a friendly and close relationship. History John of Gaunt being entertained by John I of Portugal, 14th century. The history of the relationship between Portugal and Britain dates back to the Middle Ages. English Crusaders aided Portugal in the Reconquista, and after taking Lisbon in 1147, the first King of Portugal Afonso Henriques made the Englishman Gilbert of Hastings the Bishop of Lisbon. In 1373 the Kingdom of England signed the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, the oldest alliance in the world still in force. The alliance was formalised by the Treaty of Windsor in 1386, and in 1387 Philippa of Lancaster, the daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, was married to John I of Portugal. During the late 16th century England found itself fighting against Spain which at this time was in personal union with Portugal. The English Armada was launched as part of this conflict in an attempt to restore Portuguese independence and counter both Spanish and Portuguese military ships which formed the Spanish Armada. A further marriage between the Portuguese and English royal families occurred with the Marriage Treaty in 1662 when Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza, daughter of King John IV of Portugal. Her dowry gave Britain Tangiers and Bombay, plus free trade to Portuguese colonies in Brazil and Asia. In return Charles raised a brigade of troops to serve in Portugal's Restoration War against Spain. Catherine is credited with popularising tea, which is now seen as a key part of British culture. In 1703, Portugal joined an alliance of England and the Netherlands in the War of the Spanish Succession against France and Spain. That same year, Portugal and England signed the Methuen Treaty. In the 18th century, the two nations were allies in the Seven Years' War. The 19th century saw the alliance between Portugal and the United Kingdom come into effect once more when Napoleon Bonaparte built the Continental System, which Portugal refused to join, leading Napoleon to invade. In 1807 Napoleon's army attacked Lisbon, forcing the Portuguese royal family to flee to Brazil under the protection of the British Royal Navy. In the later half of the century, as Portugal's imperial power declined following Brazil's independence, there were disputes between itself and the United Kingdom in southern Africa (1890 British Ultimatum) which was a great embarrassment for the Portuguese monarchy and colonial prestige. Portugal was one of the Allies of World War I along with Britain. While officially neutral in World War II, Portugal remained friendly to the British, a counterpart to Spain's cooperation with the Axis. World Wars Portugal was an official Allied Power in World War I; Portuguese troops were the first to be gassed by German soldiers, yet they received nothing after the Treaty of Versailles. In World War II, Prime Minister Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar was committed to the six-century-old treaty (which had been renewed in 1899). Portugal provided assistance not by declaring war but by helping Spain stay neutral and by assuming a co-belligerent status against Germany by leasing air bases in the Azores to the Allies in 1943. It cut off vital shipments of tungsten to Germany in 1944, after heavy Allied pressure. Lisbon was the base for International Red Cross operations aiding Allied POWs, and a main air transit point between Britain and the U.S.Ian Dear and M.R.D. Foot, eds.

It was to be set in San Francisco, California, c. 1969, following a group of criminals as they performed various thefts. Plot In 1969, Johnny Sutton got out of jail where he ended up for committing a small robbery. He finds out his father has passed away, leaving one big job unfinished in San Francisco Mint. Since Johnny is coming from a family of prominent thieves, which led him to follow their footsteps, being behind the bars just increased his desire to become the best bank robber of all time. He decides to finish what his dad wasn't able to by putting together a crew. Gameplay Heist was planned to be an open world action game. Every operation had to be carefully assessed from the start by consulting Uncle Sal. In that case, he would lay out the security measures, vault details, skill level needed to crack the safe and camera locations. Johnny was able to inspect the banks as a regular customer in order to get an understanding of the locations. The plan was to have six main banks with their own designs and security, with additional twenty side banks in order to have the players improve their skills. During all missions, he would be joined by Crumb, Cracker and Kid. Each of the them had their own strong points: Crumb relied on power and used a shotgun, Kid was useful in the getaways, while Cracker used his safe-cracking skills. A \\"Shot Calling\\" feature consisted of assigning the responsibilities for each crew member who would then perform their given roles. They would give a notice to Johnny whenever there is something more fitting they could be doing. There was a chance someone would decline the order, thinking he wouldn't be able to do it. Besides the regular button press system for communication, Heist was also to include a voice- control option that allowed the players to give orders by using a microphone. All orders were tied to their separate commands, fully customizable at the same time. Depending on how the situation was being handled, the time limit to finish the job would change accordingly. The gameplay was designed to punish the players for their mistakes, relying on a domino effect as a consequence. If the players didn't bring together the customers and clerks, they could try to escape and set off the alarm through the front door or behind the cashier's desk. The security guards would tend to pull out their guns at any time if the player doesn't watch over them, resulting in the police being alerted by the people passing nearby and arriving as fast as possible. There was an implemented \\"reprimand-and-reward\\" system, where Johnny's interactions with other teammates would affect their future behaviors. For example, if he praised or scolded one of them for what they have done, that person would remember that and act by it next time. The notoriety that was made to that point affected how would the police try to handle the team. It could also cause the civilians to start carrying guns and turn into vigilantes. If the team managed to leave the bank, the getaway would start immediately. The goal was to get to a safe place while driving as Kid across the streets of San Francisco and avoiding road blocks on the way. The police could have been slowed by shooting at their vehicles, or by distracting them with roadside objects. Some other groups would also try to stop the gang, each with their own methods and strengths: FBI, National Guard, vigilantes and street thugs. Every vehicle possessed an individual value for both armor and health, which was upgraded both performance wise and visually. Between the main story jobs, the players were able to complete side missions with additional gear or money as a reward, such as robbing diners or making alliances with other gangs. The allies were set to help the gang during the escape by various measures, such as stage protests or trucks blocking the way. Development Initially, inXile had an agreement to develop an open-world project for PlayStation 3 in Unreal Engine, but they didn't know the specifications at the time, which led to performance issues related to random-access memory on the console. With Scott Crisostomo as a lead designer, Heist was inspired by the 60s movies for the visual style, and several action movies for the overall feel, like Bullitt, Point Break and Dog Day Afternoon. The intent was to use the 60s rock and roll songs for the soundtrack. The developers used Need for Speed: Most Wanted as a reference for the car chases found in-game. The game was to be powered by PathEngine. According to Brian Fargo, the development took a hit because of too much involvement by Codemasters. Release Heist was announced on March 20, 2007, with a scheduled release date of Q4 2007 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. A month later, it was presented on the publisher's event Code 07 with a gameplay footage. At that point, Heist was about 30 to 35 percent complete. In December 2007, the game was pushed to Q2 2008 as a part of the Codemasters 2008 lineup's reveal. After missing out on summer 2008 release, there was little to no word about the state of the project since. Cancellation Codemasters announced on 28 January 2010 that the game had been cancelled. The British publisher furthered the statement by announcing it would no longer publish games developed by external studios.

It is remarkable in that parts of it are actually built into the rock (semi- troglodytic). History According to studies by B. Metz and T. Biller, the first mention of the castle goes back to 1250. This date certainly corresponds with the approximate date of its construction by the Lutzelhardt family, after who the castle is named. The Lutzelhardts, who were V√∂gte of Wasselonne, sold the castle in 1363 to the Fleckensteins. It was burnt in 1397 by the troops of the city of Strasbourg, taken by assault in 1462 by the troops of Wissembourg and was certainly repaired by 1469. The exact date of its abandonment is not known, but it was recorded as a ruin in 1538. Description The ruins of Ch√¢teau de Lutzelhardt The castle is built on an outcrop of sandstone, twenty metres (~65 ft) high and sixty metres (~195 ft) long. At its feet, on the south-east, is the lower courtyard. On the highest part of the rock are the remains of a small square keep, with dressed stones, and the remains of a residence along the eastern edge of the rock. The north wall still stands to the height of the ground floor. The other parts of the castle are slightly lower. They consist of a cistern, a well or second cistern, and traces of various buildings. In the lower courtyard there are remnants of sections of the curtain wall with the doorway on one side and mounds on the other, two massive cellars cut into rock (one having been vaulted) and a staircase in the rock giving access to the castle proper.

Its headwaters originate in the Cudworth and Tiger Hill Plains near the Town of Wakaw. The outlet of Wakaw Lake marks the beginning of the Carrot River and, from there, this river flows northeast through the Melfort and Red Earth Plains until it http://crwatershed.ca/about-us/ joins into the Saskatchewan River west of The Pas, Manitoba. The Carrot River is about 300 km in length and it parallels the course of the South Saskatchewan and Saskatchewan Rivers. The Carrot River serves as the main watershed for north-eastern Saskatchewan as all smaller streams and rivers empty into the Carrot River. This causes major flood problems during the spring run off and rainy seasons around the Town of Carrot River and Red Earth Indian Reserve. The floods usually strand everyone east of the river with very few ways around the flooded area. Another Carrot River enters Oxford Lake on the Hayes River.  History  The Carrot River valley was initially inhabited by Cree and Saulteaux Aboriginal people. English fur trader and explorer Henry Kelsey explored the river in the summer of 1691.MHS Transactions: The journal of Henry Kelsey, 1691-1692 Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne and Anthony Henday also explored the valley during the 1750s.  Fossils and historical finds  During the 1980s the Royal Saskatchewan Museum explored the banks and rock edges of the Carrot River, because a local farmer had been finding numerous fossils in that area. The tests on the found fossils showed them to be approximately 92 million years old. The sites along the Carrot River proved to be some of the wealthiest deposits of fossils and showed deposits from numerous other species including sharks and fish. The most notable find was in 1991, when the Royal Saskatchewan Museum and the Canadian Museum of Nature unearthed the six-metre fossil skeleton of an ancient crocodile, a Terminonaris robustus specimen named \\"Big Bert\\". Big Bert turned out to be very well-preserved and the only one of its kind found in Canada. They also found a complete fossil of Xiphactinus and toothed birds. Fish The fish species include walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, burbot and white sucker.

The Zona Sur (Southern Zone) is one of the five natural regions on which CORFO divided continental Chile in 1950. Its northern border is formed by the B√≠o-B√≠o River, the limit with the Central Chile Zone. By west with the Pacific Ocean, by the east with the Andean mountains and Argentina. Its southern border is the Chacao Channel, beyond it lies the Austral Zone. While Chilo√© Archipelago belongs geographically to Zona Austral in terms of culture and history it lies closer to Zona Sur. Geography Although many lakes can be found in the Andean and coastal regions of central Chile, the south (Sur de Chile) has the country's most lakes. Southern Chile stretches from below the R√≠o B√≠o-B√≠o at about 37¬∞ south latitude to below Isla de Chilo√© at about 43.4¬∞ south latitude. In this lake district of Chile, the valley between the Andes and the coastal range is closer to sea level, and the hundreds of rivers that descend from the Andes form lakes, some quite large, as they reach the lower elevations. They drain into the ocean through other rivers, some of which (principally the Calle-Calle River, which flows by the city of Valdivia) are the only ones in the whole country that are navigable for any stretch. The Central Valley's southernmost portion is submerged in the ocean and forms the Golfo de Ancud. Isla de Chilo√©, with its rolling hills, is the last important elevation of the coastal range of mountains. View of Termas Geom√©tricas near Co√±aripe. The Andes of Zona Sur host numerous hotsprings. The lakes in this region are remarkably beautiful. The snow-covered Andes form a backdrop to clear blue or even turquoise waters, as at Lago Todos los Santos. The rivers that descend from the Andes rush over volcanic rocks, forming numerous white- water sections and waterfalls. Some sections still consist of old-growth forests, and in all seasons, but especially in the spring and summer, there are plenty of wildflowers and flowering trees. The pastures in the northernmost section, around Osorno, are well suited for raising cattle; milk, cheese, and butter are important products of that area. All kinds of berries grow in the area, some of which are exported, and freshwater farming of various species of trout and salmon has developed, with cultivators taking advantage of the abundant supply of clear running water. The lumber industry is also important. A number of tourists, mainly Chileans and Argentines, visit the area during the summer. Climate The climate of Southern Chile is rainy with a Mediterranean precipitation pattern. The windward slopes of the Chilean Coast Range and the Andes receive up to 3000‚Äì5000 mm of precipitation annually. Behind the Chilean Coast range there is a weak rain shadow while behind the Andes, in Argentina, precipitation drops sharply. The zone lies in the mid-latitudes and is strongly influenced by the Westerlies. During the summer the South Pacific High moves into the area. Soils The main agricultural soils are; red clay soil (rojo arcillosos, ultisols), trumao and √±adi. Some red clay soils are planted with Eucalyptus globulus. In the middle course of B√≠o B√≠o River, in the northern part of Zona Sur, soils are sandy with a coarsening trend towards the Andes.Schlatter et al. 2003, p. 100. Soils of the Chilean Coast Range are mostly derived from metamorphic rock. These soils are usually poor in phosphorus, potassium and have toxic levels of aluminium. Often, these soils have poor drainage and their thickness is highly variable even at scale of tens of meters.Schlatter et al. 2003, pp. 92‚Äì93. Flora and fauna Male southern pud√∫; Los Lagos Region. The natural vegetation of Southern Chile is mainly the Valdivian temperate rainforests. These forests are characterized by large trees, chiefly evergreen Nothofagus and Conifers plus Myrtles. The understory is made of vines, hanging vines, bushes, small trees, moss, dead trunks and decomposing matter. Despite of being largely evergreen the Valdivian temperate rainforests do contain a number of deciduous tree species like Nothofagus obliqua and Nothofagus alpina. Other vegetations types of southern Chile include Fitzroya forests, Araucaria forests and wetlands called √±adis. A number of small mammals inhabit Southern Chile including the pud√∫, coypu and Darwin's fox. Database entry includes a lengthy justification of why this species is critically endangered History Southern Chile was during the time of Spanish conquest and colony populated by indigenous Mapuches from Tolt√©n River northwards and by Huilliches south of the river, both groups are classified as Araucanian. The mountainous zones in the east were populated by Pehuenches Puelches. Until the Battle of Curalaba and the following Destruction of Seven Cities around 1600 the southern zone was part of the General Captaincy of Chile and Spanish Empire. After 1600, the Spanish settlements were destroyed or abandoned with the exception of Valdivia that was re-founded in 1645 with heavy fortifications. The zone between Valdivia and Chilo√© was gradually incorporated into Chile by a series of agreements with local Huilliches and founding of settlements. By 1850 this process was culminated with the immigration of thousands of German immigrants to Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue. The zone north of Valdivia was incorporated into Chile in the 1880s during the occupation of the Araucania. Gallery File:Vacasrupanco.jpgCattle grazing in the Rupanco area.

Education Dunn, son of a Cambridge University mathematics professor, was educated at Eton College, then entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1880, graduating B.A. in 1884, and M.A. in 1887. Football career Dunn played football for Eton College, and was a Cambridge University football blue in 1883 and 1884. C.W. Alcock described Dunn, who usually played inside-left as \\"A good centreforward, rather light, but has plenty of pluck, and is a sure shot at goal\\", and \\"has great pace, and both dribbles and middles well\\". Later in his playing career he moved into defence, appearing as right-back at both his England international appearances in 1892. Dunn played in two FA Cup Finals for Old Etonians, contributing a pass to William Anderson for the only goal, thus winning the trophy 1‚Äì0 in 1882 against Blackburn Rovers, and being a runner-up in 1883 when his team lost 2‚Äì1 to Blackburn Olympic in extra time. During the latter game he went off with a knee injury early in the second half, an incident that many believed cost his side the cup, as with no substitutes allowed in those days the Old Etonians had to play on with ten men. Both finals were played at Kennington Oval. He played four times for England, starting with a 7‚Äì0 thrashing of Ireland at Liverpool on 24 February 1883 during which he scored twice. Almost exactly a year later he played against Ireland again as England this time won 8‚Äì1 in Belfast. His third cap came on 5 March 1892 in a 2‚Äì0 victory over Wales at Wrexham, whilst his final international appearance was to end in a 4‚Äì1 win over Scotland at Ibrox Park, Glasgow, on 2 April the same year. Dunn also appeared for the Corinthians between 1886‚Äì1892, and the Granta football club, as well as representing London, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk, and The South versus The North. Other sports Dunn was also an active cricketer at Minor County level with appearances for Norfolk from 1886 and Hertfordshire in 1898, and was a member of the Free Foresters. He also played ice hockey. Educational career Ludgrove Hall on a postcard of around 1900 Dunn started teaching as tutor to the Dunville family in Ireland in 1884‚Äì85. He was a master at Elstree School, Hertfordshire, from 1885 to 1892. In May 1892 he opened his own preparatory school, Ludgrove, at Ludgrove Hall, Cockfosters, near Barnet where he remained as headmaster until his death. Death and legacy He died in his sleep on 20 February 1902 at the young age of 41. In the week preceding his death, he had refereed a football match between Ludgrove's own XI and Oxford University and played hockey on the ice at Trent Park near the school, when he complained of tiredness. On the day he died he had visited the House of Commons with M.P. Colonel William Kenyon-Slaney, whose son was then a pupil at Ludgrove. He was buried at Little Shelford, Cambridgeshire, where he was brought up. 'ATB' left a widow and three children. His youngest daughter, Olive Mary, became an author and also wrote for the satirical magazine Punch. His only son, John H. M. Dunn, became a 2nd Lieutenant with the Royal Field Artillery and was killed in action in the First World War on the Somme in September 1916. His eldest daughter, Marjorie Florence, was awarded an MBE in 1920 for her work with the Red Cross during that war. His wife Helen outlived him by 26 years and died in 1949 aged 81. After his death the Arthur Dunn Cup was instituted in his memory, based on an idea he proposed shortly before his death. This is a football competition for 'Old Boys' teams of various leading independent schools, and was first competed for in the 1902‚Äì03 season. Sporting honours Old Etonians *F.A.

History  The club's predecessor sides was Oestricher Fu√üballclub which was formed in 1911 and later merged with the football department of Turnverein Oestrich von 1881. Like other German organizations, including sports and football associations, the club was dissolved by occupying Allied authorities after World War II. It was re-established as Fu√üballverein Sportfreunde Oestrich on 10 September 1949 and in 1975 adopted its current name. Until the mid-70s the team played in the city and district circuits until earning promotion to the Landesliga Westfalen in 1975. Just three years later they again moved up, this time to the Verbandsliga Westfalen (V). They played there until 1995 when they won honours as league champions and advanced to the Oberliga Westfalen (IV). The Sportfreunde earned mid-to- lower table results as an Oberliga side until a 17th-place finish in 2002 returned them to fifth division competition. In 2006 the club earned a second- place result but was promoted to the Oberliga over first place DSC Wanne- Eickel when that club was denied a license. In 2008 it became part of to the new NRW-Liga (V) where they finished second from bottom and were relegated to the Verbandsliga (VI) the next year. Another demotion in 2012 saw the club enter Landesliga Westfalen 2 (VII) but before the new season opened, it joined TuS Iserlohn to become FC Iserlohn.

It is surrounded by the Zona Sur and the Chacao Channel to the north, the Pacific Ocean and Drake's Passage to the south and west, and the Andean mountains and Argentina to the east. If excluding Chilo√© Archipelago Zona Austral covers all of Chilean Patagonia. Geography=Physical geography In the far south (Chile Austral), which extends from Valdivia through the Chacao Channel to Cape Horn, the Andes and the South Pacific meet. This district of the country is mountainous, heavily forested and inhospitable. The deeply indented coastline is filled with islands which preserve the general outline of the continent southward to the Fuegian archipelago, the outside groups forming a continuation of the Chilean Coast Range. The heavy and continuous rainfall throughout this region, especially in the latitude of Chilo√©, gives rise to a large number of rivers and lakes. Farther south this excessive precipitation is in the form of snow in the Andes, forming glaciers at a comparatively low level which in places discharge into the inlets and bays of the sea. The extreme southern part of this region extends eastward to the Atlantic entrance to the Strait of Magellan, and includes the greater part of the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego with all the islands lying south and west of it. There are some comparatively level stretches of country immediately north of the Strait, partly forested and partly grassy plains, where sheep farming has been established with some degree of success, but the greater part of this extreme southern territory is mountainous, cold, wet and inhospitable. The perpetual snow-line here descends to 1,000 to 1,200 m (3,500 to 4,000 ft) above sea-level, and the forest growth does not rise above an altitude of 300 to 450 m (1,000 to 1,500 ft). =Mountains= From the latitude of Michinmahuida volcano southwards a well-defined western longitudinal valley, occupied by the Carretera Austral, divides the Andes into two chains, the eastern being the main chain, to which belong mounts Ventisquero Sur, Barros Arana and Alto Nevado, while the western chain, broken into imposing blocks, contains several high volcanic peaks such as Corcovado, Yanteles and Melimoyu. An important transverse mountain range of the Andes separates the valleys of the rivers Simpson and Iba√±ez. This section is dominated by the active Hudson volcano and the jagged Cerro Castillo. Southward from General Carrera lake is found a wide oblique opening in the range, through which flows the river Baker. The main chain of the Andes in the west is an enormous rugged mass of ice and snow of an average height of 2700 m (9000 ft.), sending glaciers to all the western fjords. Monte San Valentin (4,058 m [13,314 ft.]) is the culminating point of the Andes in the region extending from 49¬∞ to 46¬∞ S latitude Monte San Lorenzo, detached from the main chain of the Andes, is 3,706 m (12,156 ft.) high. The section from 48¬∞ to 52¬∞ S latitude is a continuous ice-capped mountain range, and some of the glaciers extend from the eastern lakes to the western channels, where they reach the sea-level. The highest mountain in the section is Lautaro volcano, but the most famous compose the Cordillera del Paine in the south and the Fitz Roy group in the north. The southernmost part of this zone is formed by two small parallel ranges called Cordillera Sarmiento and Cordillera Riesco, which are separated by the Fjord of the Mountains. From the 52 deg. S. lat. up to Strait of Magellan, the western slope of the Cordillera does not, properly speaking, exist. Abrupt walls overlook the Pacific, and great longitudinal and transversal channels and fjords run right through the heart of the range, cutting it generally in a direction more or less oblique to its axis, the result of movements of the Earth's crust. This region is not fully explored, and all that is known of it is that it is principally composed of the same rocks as the Fuegian Andes, and that the greater part of its upper valleys is occupied by glaciers that reach down to the sea amid dense forest. The Cordillera of the Andes in Tierra del Fuego is formed of crystalline schists, and culminates in the snow-capped peaks of Mount Darwin and Monte Sarmiento in the Cordillera Darwin, which contains glaciers of greater extent than those of Mont Blanc. The extent of the glaciers is considerable in this region, which, geographically, is more complex than was formerly supposed. Although, in the explored portion of the Fuegian chain, the volcanoes which have been mentioned from time to time have not been met with, there seem to have existed to the south, on the islands, many neo-volcanic rocks, some of which appear to be contemporaneous with the basaltic sheet that covers a part of eastern Patagonia. Farther south the Andes terminates in Cape Horn. In this section the mountains are composed principally of crystalline rocks, and their heights are inconsiderable when compared with those of the northern Andes. =Coasts= The continental coastline features numerous inlets and fjords, from which the mountains seem to rise straight up to great elevations; this is, for example, the case with the Cerro Mac√° (2,300 meters) near Puerto Ais√©n. The rest of the land consists of literally thousands of islands forming numerous archipelagos interwoven with sometimes-narrow channels, which provide the main routes of navigation. The grouping of such islands shows that they are in part the summits of a submerged mountain chain, a continuation southward of the Chilean Coast Range. Three groups of these, called Chilo√©, Guaitecas and Chonos archipelagoes, lie North of the Taitao Peninsula. The largest island of this portion of Austral Chile is Chilo√©, which is inhabited. Some of the smaller islands of these groups are also inhabited, though the excessive rainfall of these latitudes and the violent westerly storms render them highly unfavourable for human occupation. Some of the smallest islands are barren rocks, but the majority of them are covered with forests. These archipelagoes are separated from the mainland in the north by the gulfs of Ancud and Corcovado, 30 to 35 mi wide, which appear to be a submerged part of the great Chilean Central Valley, and farther south by the narrower Moraleda Channel, which terminates southward in a confusing network of passages between the mainland and the islands of the Chonos group. Below the Taitao peninsula is the broad open Gulf of Penas, which carries the coast-line eastward fully 100 mi and is noticeably free from islands, with some exceptions. The northern entrance to Messier Channel is through this gulf. Messier, Pitt, Sarmiento and Smyth's Channels, which form a comparatively safe and remarkably picturesque inside route for ships, about 338 mi in length, separate another series of archipelagoes from the mainland. These channels are in places narrow and tortuous. Among the islands which thickly fringe this part of the coast, the largest are Merino Jarpa (lying within Baker Channel), Prat, Campana (part of Guayaneco Archipelago), Little Wellington, Wellington and Mornington (of the Wellington Archipelago), Madre de Dios, Duke of York, Chatham, Hanover, Cambridge, Contreras, Rennell and the Queen Adelaide Archipelago, a group of small barren rocks and islands lying immediately north of the Pacific entrance to the Strait of Magellan. The large number of English names on this coast is due to the fact that the earliest detailed survey of this region was made by English naval officers; the charts prepared from their surveys are still in use and form the basis of all subsequent maps. Belonging to the Tierra del Fuego archipelago south of the Strait of Magellan are Desolaci√≥n, Santa In√©s, Clarence, Capit√°n Aracena, Dawson, Londonderry, Hoste, Navarino and Wollaston Islands, with innumerable smaller islands and rocks fringing their shores and filling the channels between them. The far south contains large expanses of pastures that are best suited for raising sheep, mainly on Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego. The area's other main economic activity is oil and natural gas extraction from the areas around the Strait of Magellan. This strait is one of the world's important sea-lanes because it unites the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through a channel that avoids the rough open waters off Cape Horn. The channel is perilous, however, and Chilean pilots guide all vessels through it. HydrographyRivers= The Comau Fjord and Vodudahue River traverse the densely wooded country in a north-westerly direction from the Andes to the north-eastern shore of the Gulf of Chacao. This area is home to Pumal√≠n Park. Continuing southward, the Yelcho is the next important river to traverse this region. Forming part of its basin is the Futaleuf√∫ River, which drains a large area of Argentine territory. Yelcho flows north-west from Yelcho Lake to the Gulf of Corcovado. The Palena is another river of the same character, having its source in a large frontier lake, which is called General Paz or General Vintter in Argentina and Palena in Chile. It flows for some distance through Argentine territory before crossing into Chile. It receives one large tributary from the south, the Pico River, and enters an estuary of the Gulf of Corcovado a little north of the 44th parallel. The Cisnes is wholly a Chilean river, draining an extensive Andean region between the 44th and 45th parallels and discharging into the Puyuhuapi Channel, which separates Magdalena Island from the mainland. The Ais√©n River also has its source near the 46th parallel, and drains a mountainous region as far north es the 45th parallel, receiving numerous tributaries, and discharging a large volume of water into the Ays√©n Fjord. The next large river is the Baker River, through which the waters of lakes General Carrera and Cochrane, find their way to the Pacific. Both of these large lakes are crossed by the boundary line. The Baker discharges into Baker Channel. The course of the river from lake General Carrera is south and south-west, the short range of mountains in which are found the cerros San Valent√≠n and Arenales forcing it southward for an outlet. Baker inlet also receives the waters of still another large Argentine-Chilean lake, O'Higgins Lake. Its north-west arm drains into the Pascua River. After a short north-westerly course the river discharges into Baker Inlet in lat. 48¬∞ 13‚Ä≤ S., long. 73¬∞ 24‚Ä≤ W. South of Pascua river there are no large rivers on this coast, but the narrow fjords penetrate deeply into the mountains and bring away the drainage of their snow-capped, storm-swept elevations. A peculiar network of fjords and connecting channels terminating inland in a peculiarly shaped body of water with long, widely branching arms, called Worsley Sound, Obstruction Sound and √öltima Esperanza Sound, covers an extensive area between the 51st and 53rd parallels, and extends nearly to the Argentine frontier. It has the characteristics of a tidewater river and drains an extensive region. A noteworthy peculiarity of southern Chile, from the Taitao peninsula to Tierra del Fuego, is the large number of glaciers formed on the western and southern slopes of the Andes and other high elevations, which discharge direct into these deeply cut estuaries. Some of the larger lakes of the Andes have glaciers discharging into them. The formation of these icy streams at comparatively low levels, with their discharge direct into tidewater estuaries, is a phenomenon not to be found elsewhere in the same latitudes. =Lakes= General Carrera Lake The great Andean lakes of Palena (near the 44th parallel), General Carrera (in lat 46¬∞ 30‚Ä≤ S.), Cochrane (47¬∞ 15‚Ä≤ S.) and O'Higgins (49¬∞ S.), lie partly within Chilean territory. In Argentina are called, respectively, General Paz (also is known as General Vintter), Buenos Aires, Pueyrred√≥n and San Mart√≠n. Towards the coast, other important lakes are Presidente Rios Lake, Laguna San Rafael and Yulton Lake. Southward from the southern portion of Southern Patagonian Ice Field (about 51¬∞ S. lat.), lakes include Del Toro and Sarmiento. The former overflows into √öltima Esperanza Sound. In the extreme south of Chile mainland is Laguna Blanca, a large fresh-water lake in lat. 52¬∞ 30‚Ä≤ S. Notable lakes in Tierra del Fuego include Fagnano (shared with Argentina), Blanco and Ofhidro. Climate In the northern part of the far south, there is still plenty of rainfall. For instance, Puerto Ais√©n, at 45¬∞ 24‚Ä≤ south latitude, receives 2,973.3 millimeters of rain per year. However, unlike in Valdivia, the rain falls more or less evenly throughout the year in Puerto Ais√©n. The summer months average 206.1 millimeters, whereas the winter months average 300 millimeters. The temperatures at sea level in Puerto Ais√©n average 13.6 ¬∞C in the summer months and 4.7 ¬∞C in the winter months. The area is still heavily forested, although some of the native species of trees that grow in the central and southern parts of the country have given way to others better adapted to a generally colder climate. The southern part of the far south includes the city of Punta Arenas, which, with about 125,000 inhabitants, is the southernmost city in the world with over 100,000 inhabitants (see Southernmost settlements). It receives much less precipitation; its annual total is only 438.5 millimeters, or a little more than what Valdivia receives in the month of June alone. This precipitation is distributed more or less evenly throughout the year, with the two main summer months receiving a monthly average of 31 millimeters and the winter months 38.9 millimeters, some of it in the form of snow. Temperatures are colder than in the rest of the country. The summer months average 11.1 ¬∞C, and the winter months average 2.5 ¬∞C. The virtually constant wind from the South Pacific Ocean makes the air feel much colder.

As of , this is the most recent election in which a Democrat was elected Governor of Alaska and the most recent election in which an Alaskan governor won a second full term.  Candidates  Incumbent Democratic governor Tony Knowles was up for re-election. On the Republican side, three major candidates jockeyed for the nomination: businessman John Howard Lindauer, state senator Robin L. Taylor, and Wayne A. Ross. Lindauer won the open primary election, with Taylor coming in second. Jim Sykes, founder of the Green Party of Alaska, ran on that party's ticket, but Desa Jacobsson later replaced him on the ballot. Ray Metcalfe, a defecting Republican who had founded the Republican Moderate Party of Alaska, also ran.  Campaign  Lindauer's campaign faltered late into the race as a result of his failure to disclose that his wife, a wealthy Chicago lawyer, had financed the bulk of his campaign. As a result of this revelation, the Republicans withdrew their support of Lindauer and backed Robin Taylor, the runner-up of the Republican primary, as a write- in candidate. Due to the lateness of this change, the Republicans unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a court order to delay the election. The collapse of Lindauer's campaign resulted in a three-way split of the Republican vote between him, Taylor, and the Republican Moderate Metcalfe. Knowles defeated Taylor, his closest opponent, by 33%, the widest margin of victory for a gubernatorial candidate in Alaska history. Moreover, if Taylor's and Lindauer's totals are added together, Knowles defeated the two Republicans combined by 16% ‚Äì still the widest margin in Alaska history until 2010.

It is located in S√£o Mateus do Sul, Brazil, and it is owned and operated by the Brazil energy company Petrobras. Petrosix means also the Petrosix process, an externally generated hot gas technology of shale oil extraction. The technology is tailored to Irati oil shale formation, a Permian formation of the Paran√° Basin. History Petrobras started oil shale processing activities in 1953 by developing Petrosix technology for extracting oil from oil shale of the Irati formation. A inside diameter semi-works retort (the Irati Profile Plant) with capacity of 2,400 tons per day, was brought on line in 1972, and began limited commercial operation in 1980. The first retort that used current Petrosix technology was a internal diameter retort pilot plant started in 1982. It was followed by a retort demonstration plant in 1984. A retort was brought into service in December 1991, and commercial production started in 1992. The company operates two retorts which process 8,500 tons of oil shale daily. Retort The Petrosix vertical shaft retort is the world's largest operational surface oil shale pyrolysis reactor. It was designed by Cameron Engineers. The retort has the upper pyrolysis section and lower shale coke cooling section. The retort capacity is 6,200 tons of oil shale per day, and it yields a nominal daily output of 3,870 barrels of shale oil (i.e., 550 tons of oil, approximately 1 ton of oil per 11 tons of shale), 132 tons of oil shale gas, 50 tons of liquefied oil shale gas, and 82 tons of sulfur. Process Petrosix is one of four technologies of shale oil extraction in commercial use. It is an above-ground retorting technology, which uses externally generated hot gas for the oil shale pyrolysis. After mining, the shale is transported by trucks to a crusher and screens, where it is reduced to particles (lump shale). These particles are between and and have an approximately parallelepipedic shape. These particles are transported on a belt to a vertical cylindrical vessel, where the shale is heated up to about for pyrolysis. Oil shale enters through the top of the retort while hot gases are injected into the middle of the retort. The oil shale is heated by the gases as it moves down. As a result, the kerogen in the shale decomposes to yield oil vapor and more gas. Cold gas is injected into the bottom of the retort to cool and recover heat from the spent shale. Cooled spent shale is discharged through a water seal with drag conveyor below the retort. Oil mist and cooled gases are removed through the top of the retort and enter a wet electrostatic precipitator where the oil droplets are coalesced and collected. The gas from the precipitator is compressed and split into three parts. One part of the compressed retort gas is heated in a furnace to and recirculated back to the middle of the retort for heating and pyrolyzing the oil shale, and another part is circulated cold into the bottom of the retort, where it cools down the spent shale, heats up itself, and ascends into the pyrolysis section as a supplementary heat source for heating the oil shale. The third part undergoes further cooling for light oil (naphtha) and water removal and then sent to the gas treatment unit, where fuel gas and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are produced and sulfur recovered.The fuel gas or another fuel is used to heat the external furnace. One drawback of this process is that the potential heat from the combustion of the char contained in the shale is not utilized. Also oil shale particles smaller than can not be processed in the Petrosix retort. These fines may account for 10 to 30 per cent of the crushed feed.

The boundary of the two boroughs is a street named Recreation Way. No roads directly cross the Croydon and Merton divide, and streets were planned according to borough, leading to differing architectural or building schemes. It lends its name to a ward of the London Borough of Merton. History Mitcham Borough Council (MBC) dissolved in 1965 on incorporation into London. It helped to meet the post- World War II housing shortage, wrought by the London Blitz, by building prefabricated ‚ÄòArcon‚Äô bungalows at Pollards Hill. The first were ready by January 1946, meant to last about 10 years. Many remained until the mid-1960s. The pre-fabs were mostly demolished in the 1960s, to make way for a new, high density, low-rise scheme that was constructed by Merton London Borough Council and Wimpey Homes between 1967 and 1971. Separately, four landmark maisonette blocks were built by MBC in the 1950s on Yorkshire Road: Westmorland Square (1950), Bovingdon Square (1956) and between those years Hertford Square and Berkshire Square. A branch library and community centre were built, which received a design award. Governance=Councillors Both sides of Pollards Hill elected Labour Party councillors at the last Council elections in May 2018. At present in the local government re-warding process used nationally for the regular election of a delegation of councillors, it lends its name to a ward of the Merton. UK elections (general elections and by- elections) East and west have, since 1992 and 1997, respectively seen their relevant two seats in London, locally dependent wholly on borough, return Labour MPs. The seats are Croydon North and Mitcham and Morden. The narrower majority, narrowly, is in the latter; at all elections since 1997 the two seats have seen a greater than 28% Labour majority. Geography To the east (in Croydon), covering the sides of the hill, are larger houses, stretching towards central Norbury. The roads are lined with pollarded lime trees. To the west (in Merton), at the foot of the hill, is the Pollards Hill estate stretching to Mitcham Common. A section of the estate was transferred to the ownership of Moat Homes housing association in 1998 under a stock transfer from the local authority. Moat has since demolished four maisonette blocks dating from the 1950s and is undertaking a wider regeneration of the stock. Covering the crown of the hill is Pollards Hill Park, an open area of 7.75 acres (3.14 hectares), managed by Croydon Council, to whom it was donated in 1913. The park is the highest point in the Norbury area and can give views as far as Windsor Castle. A viewpoint at the top of the park indicates the direction of various landmarks. Education In September 2006, Harris Academy Merton opened on the former site of Tamworth Manor High School. The academy is on the Merton side but right on the Croydon border.

He was made a Knight of St. Gregory in January 1933 by Pope Pius XI. He was the secretary-treasurer of the Yount-Lee Oil Company, and later named as vice president and treasurer, had been associated with Miles Franklin Yount from the early days when Yount struggled at Sour Lake, Texas and he was a traveling salesman with the Heisig-Norvell Company. Biography Born in 1877, at Charlotte, North Carolina, Harry was one of Patrick Henry and Adele Myers Phelan‚Äôs eleven children. He received an early education in the parochial schools at Charlotte, but soon after completing the ninth grade, he followed his father into the wholesale grocery business. The younger Phelan held jobs as office boy and shipping clerk in several organizations, including the Wittkowsky Wholesale Dry Goods and the Wolfe Company, and at the age of nineteen, he went to work as a traveling salesman for the J. A. Durham Company. He remained there until January 1902, when he moved to Beaumont, Texas. Heisig-Norvell offered him a similar job at a salary of $150 per month. Phelan accepted the position and remained with this concern until 1913, at which time he formed his own business, the Phelan-Josey Grocery Company. For a while, though, he successfully divided his time between duties at Yount-Lee and his own firm, but in January 1927 the demands generated by the oil company‚Äôs success at Spindletop forced him to choose between the two. Yount-Lee won out. Phelan, however, continued as president of Phelan-Josey, but his brother, Frank, already a vice president there, assumed the title of general manager and ran the business while Harry devoted his full attention to Yount-Lee affairs. On June 15, 1905, he married Johannah Maria Cunningham at Chicago, and three children were born to this union: John Henry, Jr., Anthony, and Margaret. The elder Phelan, an active member of the Catholic Church, became legendary for his philanthropic activities. In October 1931 he donated $35,000 to the St. Vincent de Paul Society in Austin, Texas, and he contributed considerable funds to the Home of the Holy Infancy (now Marywood), located also in Austin, that provides maternity, adoption, and foster care services. He and Johannah gave extensively to St. Anne Church and St. Anne School in Beaumont, along with numerous ‚Äúorgans, statues, and ..., making gifts of some 225 altars to churches throughout the country,‚Äù including the one donated in 1915 to St. Anthony Cathedral in Beaumont. As a recompense for his many contributions, Pope Pius XI made Harry a Knight of St. Gregory in January 1933, an honor received previously by only one other Texan and only about fifty men in the entire country. And later that same year, the Pope also granted the Phelans a private audience, a first for Beaumonters. The Catholic Church bestowed upon him numerous other awards, such as Knight of Malta and Knight in the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1928 Phelan began construction of a palatial home named Caed Mile Failte, a Gaelic term meaning ‚Äúone hundred thousand welcomes,‚Äù on a estate, located at the corner of Eleventh Street and Calder Avenue in Beaumont. The original estimate of the house, set at $125,000, escalated, and when completed, it ranged near $500,000 after adding in the costs of the land, furnishings, and other amenities, such as guest houses, art studios, a miniature golf course, stables, a swimming pool, and a $25,000 pipe organ. Architect Owen James Trainor Southwell, a long-time friend of the family who grew up with the Phelan children, designed the overall project. Harry Phelan gave much of his time and some of his wealth to his beloved city of Beaumont. In return, the Beaumont Rotary Club named him as 1940 citizen of the year, and in 1951 he received the prestigious Laetare Medal, conferred by the University of Notre Dame to outstanding Catholic laymen. He became known far and wide for his philanthropic acts, but the greatest of these occurred in early 1957 when he and Johannah donated their home and estate to the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word. The home, now vacant, and grounds are a part of the St. Elizabeth Hospital complex. Harry Phelan died at age seventy-nine in Beaumont, Texas on May 19, 1957, and is buried at the city‚Äôs Magnolia Cemetery. References *Source: McKinley, Fred B., and Greg Riley.

As of 2008 one baronetcy is extinct. Chaytor baronets, of Croft Hall (created 1671) William Chaytor (1639 ‚Äì 1720) was created a baronet, of Croft Hall in the County of York, in the Baronetage of England on 26 June 1671 and appointed Colonel of the Richmondshire Regiment of the militia in 1689. He was the son of Royalist Lieutenant-Colonel Nicholas Chaytor (1608 ‚Äì 1665), of Butterby and Haughton Field, who served under the Marquis of Newcastle, in son of Thomas Chaytor (1553 ‚Äì 1618) and grandson of Sir Christopher Chaytor (1494 ‚Äì 1592), of Butterby. Sir Christopher was surveyor-general for Elizabeth of Durham and Northumberland in 1575 and registrar of the Consistory Court of Durham, and received a grant to bear arms in 1571. He married Elizabeth, sole heiress to the Norman French Clervaux family; through this marriage, the Clervaux estates came to the Chaytor family, who came to often use 'Clervaux' or the variant form 'Clervaulx' as middle names.Burke (1835), Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners, p. 139Hylton Longstaffe (1852), House of Clervaux, Pedigree of Chaytor In 1675, Sir William married Peregrina, daughter of Sir Joseph Cradock of Richmond. Though Sir William had eight sons and five daughters, none of them survived him, and when he died in Fleet Prison, where he had been held for debt 17 years, in 1720/1 the baronetcy became extinct.G.E.C. (1909), Complete Baronetage, p. 49-50 His seat of Croft passed to his nephew Henry, who was father of William Chaytor (MP) of Croft and Spenningthorne (1732 ‚Äì 1819). Chaytor baronets, of Witton Castle and Croft (created 1831) William Chaytor (1771 ‚Äì 1847), an industrialist and Whig politician who served as MP for Richmond in the first Reform Parliament, was created a baronet of Croft in the County of York and of Witton Castle in the County of Durham, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 30 September 1831. He built Clervaux Castle on the manor of Croft. He was son of William Chaytor of Croft and Spenningthorne, Member of Parliament for Hedon (UK Parliament constituency), Recorder of Richmond and Vice-Lieutenant for the North Riding of Yorkshire; his great-grandfather, Henry Chaytor (c. 1638 ‚Äì 1719) was brother to Sir William Chaytor, 1st Baronet of the first creation. He was succeeded by his eldest son William Richard Carter Chaytor, the second baronet, who represented Durham in the House of Commons. His grandson, William Henry Edward Chaytor, the fourth baronet, was High Sheriff of County Durham in 1902 and a Deputy Lieutenant of the county. He died unmarried at an early age and was succeeded by his younger brother, Walter Clervaux Chaytor, the fifth baronet, who served as a Justice of the Peace. The fifth baronet also died at a young age and was succeeded by his younger brother, Edmund Hugh Chaytor, the sixth baronet. On the death of his only son, William Henry Clervaux Chaytor, the seventh Baronet, in 1976, the line of the third baronet failed. The presumed eighth baronet, his successor, was his second cousin George Reginald Chaytor, son of William Richard Carter Chaytor, eldest son of Reginald Clervaux Chaytor, son of the second marriage of the second baronet. He never proved his succession and was never on the Official Roll of the Baronetage.

At its outermost tip is Fenning Island (now joined to the mainland), at the tip of which is Stert Point (sometimes spelt Steart Point) which is the eastern end of the West Somerset Coast Path. North of Stert Point lies Stert Island, which was joined to the peninsula until about 1798. The peninsula consists largely of low-lying flat farmland, and projects northwards on the west side of Stockland Reach, the lower stretches of the estuary of the River Parrett. The main settlement on the peninsula is the village of Steart, but two other villages, Stockland Bristol and Otterhampton sit at the peninsula's base. A single minor road links the village of Steart to these other villages. The River Parrett Trail runs along the peninsula. West of the peninsula are the village of Stolford and Hinkley Point, and to the south is the village of Combwich. From 1927 to the 1950s Stert Flats, the mudflats north-west of the peninsula, were used as a RAF range, the Stert Flats Air Gunnery and Bombing Range. A few structures from this time remain.  Nature reserves  Aerial view of the Steart Peninsula There are two nature reserves on the peninsula. A third reserve is being developed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.  Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserve  Bridgwater Bay, a national nature reserve, lies on the northern side of the peninsula. The reserve includes the largest area of salt marsh in Somerset, and large expanses of mudflats exposed at low tide, important feeding and roosting sites for waterfowl and wading birds. There are four bird hides in the north of the reserve, near the tip of the peninsula. Adjoining the reserve are three coastal commons ‚Äî from west to east these are Catsford Common, Wall Common and Steart Common.  Steart Marshes  The Steart Marshes are a major wetland reserve on the south side of the peninsula, completed in 2014 and managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust. The reserve is the result of a flood management project, which involved a breach in the sea wall to permit seawater to enter the salt marsh from the tidal River Parrett. The Steart peninsula has flooded many times during the last millennium. The most severe recent floods occurred in 1981. By 1997, a combination of coastal erosion, current sea level rise and wave action had made some of the defences distinctly fragile and at risk from failure. As a result in 2002 The Environment Agency produced the Stolford to Combwich Coastal Defence Strategy Study to examine options for the future. In July 2010, the Environment Agency presented a plan to convert the peninsula into wetland habitat, costing ¬£17‚Äì20 million, which included land purchase costs of ¬£5‚Äì7 million. It was the largest wetland habitat creation scheme in England. Work began on the programme in May 2012 and was completed in September 2014. An Environment Agency spokesman said \\"The Steart project will directly protect homes, businesses and the surrounding infrastructure. Salt marsh is a natural flood risk management scheme. Like coral reefs or mangroves in the tropics, salt marsh takes energy out of the tide and reduces wave height.\\"  References External links *Archaeology of the Steart Peninsula, Wessex Archaeology, 2019 Category:Sedgemoor Category:Peninsulas of England Category:Landforms of Somerset ","title":"Steart Peninsula"},{"id":"10164374","text":"Planeta Rica is a town and municipality located in the C√≥rdoba Department, northern Colombia.
