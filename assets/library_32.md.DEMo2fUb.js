She made pointed observations of people in her circle and political figures. Although not intended for publication, an edition of her letters and journal, including entries from 1766 to 1774, was published in 1889 by a distant great-nephew. Life=Marriage and separation She was the fifth and youngest daughter of the soldier and politician John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll (1680–1743), and his second wife, Jane (c.1683–1767), a maid of honour to Queen Anne and Caroline, Princess of Wales. Mary grew up in Sudbrook or in London, visiting her father's ancestral estate at Inveraray in Argyll at least once and possibly more often. She married on 1 April 1747, Edward Coke, Viscount Coke (1719–1753); son of Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester. Their courtship had been strained, and in retaliation Edward left her alone on their wedding night and from then on virtually imprisoned her at his family estate at Holkham Hall, Norfolk. She reacted by refusing to have sex with him. She never used the title Viscountess Coke. Their families went to litigation, and eventually produced a settlement in 1750 whereby Lady Mary could live with her mother at Sudbrook but had to remain married to Coke until his death, which came in 1753, when Mary was 26. Already having received a handsome legacy from her father, she set out on her life of independence (she never remarried), that became (as her entry in the Dictionary of National Biography puts it) \\"marked by gossip, travel, devotion to royalty, and self-imposed misadventure\\".Jill Rubenstein, 'Coke, Lady Mary (1727–1811)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 30 Nov 2015 Mary occupied Aubrey House, in the Campden Hill area of Holland Park from 1767 to 1788. A London County Council blue plaque commemorates her and other residents of the house. Royal romance? In her grandiose shows of grief on the death of Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany, in 1767, Lady Mary alleged in veiled hints that they had been secretly married, a claim that brought her further derision. He had been a subject of an intensely emotional and lengthy flirtation, which she alleged had been passionate on both sides. According to most accounts, the relationship had been one-sided, with York regarding it and her as a joke. Trips to Europe On her first trip to Europe in 1770–71, Lady Mary became a friend of Empress Maria Theresa and was warmly welcomed at the Viennese court. She alienated her friend on her third visit in 1773 by interfering in court intrigue. Mary, however, did not see that this predicament had been self-inflicted and from then on saw any disaster – servants' incompetence, unsuccessful auction bids, rheumatism – as part of a Maria Theresa-instigated plot pursuing her across Europe. Emily Barry (née Stanhope, Countess of Barrymore, and wife of the 6th Earl) was accused by Mary of luring away her previously faithful servant whilst she was in Paris in 1775, to aid an alleged assassination plot against her by Maria Theresa's daughter Marie Antoinette and her underlings. Walpole It was the 1775 event which finally drove away another of Mary's close friends, Horace Walpole. Though devoted and mock-gallant in his flattery of her (his The Castle of Otranto in 1765 was dedicated to her), he also could see that her lack of a sense of humour and pride in her own self-importance made most of her misfortunes self-inflicted. He called her and two of her sisters (Caroline Townshend, Baroness Greenwich, and Lady Betty Mackenzie) the three furies, and wrote elsewhere: > 'She was much a friend of mine, but a later marriage,Between the Duke of > Gloucester and Walpole's niece Lady Waldegrave. which she particularly > disapproved, having flattered herself with the hopes of one just a step > higher, has a little cooled our friendship.

W. S.Lewis and others, > 48 vols.(1937–83), 23.530 Political observer Lady Mary saw evidence of a conspiracy (this time a Catholic one against the Protestant succession) in Margaret Nicholson's attempt to assassinate George III in 1786 and Maria Fitzherbert's rumoured marriage to George, Prince of Wales. Some of her observations were more accurate, for example her praise of the Duchess of Devonshire's political skill, in 1787: \\"As soon as ever any young man comes from abroad he is immediately invited to Devonshire House and to Chatsworth—and by that means he is to be of the [Whig] opposition\\".E. H. Chalus, 'Women in English political life, 1754–1790', DPhil diss., U. Oxf., 1997, p88 She avidly collected political information, deploying it to protect herself, her friends and her family, and passing it on to her sisters in her journal. She was a frequent visitor to the Houses of Commons and Lords, witnessing political controversies such as Warren Hastings's trial and the debate over the Cumberland election petition in 1768 (in which she backed Sir James Lowther). Death She bought Morton House, Chiswick four years before her death there in 1811. She appreciated that Sir Stephen Fox had built it late in the 17th century and the house had been little altered since. She was buried in Westminster Abbey in her father's family vault on 11 October 1811. Journal Lady Mary is mainly known from her journal, never intended for publication and instead written for self-amusement and for the amusement of her sisters, most especially Anne (1719/20–1785), who had married William Wentworth, 2nd Earl of Strafford, in 1741. Her DNB entry states: \\"The journal ranges from banal descriptions of card games and weather to perceptive social observation and expressions of sincere affection, often closely and unselfconsciously juxtaposed. The personality which emerges from the whole combines elements of the mundane and the preposterous with the deeply sympathetic.\\" She began writing it in August 1766 and stopped making regular additions in January 1791, when Anne's husband died. The published edition includes entries only up to December 1774. (Her great-great-great-nephew James Archibald Home edited this edition.) After 1791, Lady Mary continued to pass on her opinions to friends and relatives, such as her niece Lady Frances Scott (her sister Caroline's daughter by her first marriage to Francis, earl of Dalkeith) and her first cousin once removed Lady Louisa Stuart. Louisa Stuart in 1827 wrote an acerbic memoir of Lady Mary, which is another major source for her life.Miller, Karl, Stuart, Lady Louisa (1757–1851), writer in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004 & online edition, January 2006 (subscription required) accessed 29 February 2008 Publication -Lady Mary Coke, The letters and journals of Lady Mary Coke, Volume 1, London, Kingsmead Bookshops, 1889 NotesSources * DNB Category:Daughters of British dukes Category:1727 births Category:1811 deaths Category:Burials at Westminster Abbey Category:British letter writers Category:Women letter writers Category:British diarists Category:People from Ham, London Mary Category:British courtesy viscountesses Category:Women diarists ","title":"Lady Mary Coke"},{"id":"12706776","text":"Armorial of Denzell: Sable, a mullet in chief and a crescent in base argent John Denzel (died 1535) held large estates in Cornwall and became serjeant-at- law and Attorney-General to the Queen Consort, Elizabeth of York.

The army was first active from 1998 to 2009, and was reformed in 2015. After the war, the Soviet Air Defence Forces' main command in the Leningrad area from 1960 was the 6th Independent Air Defence Army.  History = Origins  The army traces its lineage back to the formation of the 2nd Air Defence Corps before Operation Barbarossa, the World War II German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. The corps provided direct cover for the city, and the Air Forces of the Leningrad Military District had two fighter aviation divisions for air defense, which became the 7th Fighter Aviation Corps in July. In November, the 2nd Corps was reorganized into the Leningrad Air Defence Corps Region, but on 5 April 1942 it became the Leningrad Air Defence Army. During the Siege of Leningrad between 1941 and 1944, the air defence formations protecting the city claimed more than 1,500 German aircraft destroyed, and covered the Road of Life across Lake Ladoga. In the fall of 1945, after the end of the war, the army was reorganized into the 16th Special Air Defence Corps, which was redesignated the 16th Air Defence Corps in May 1946 and the 16th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Corps PVO in July 1947. In early 1949, the headquarters of the Leningrad Air Defence Region was formed from the corps headquarters. In August, its anti-aircraft artillery divisions conducted an exercise in which they practiced repelling a large enemy air raid. The region was an air defence region of the 2nd category, and in the spring of 1954 became 1st category, tasked with providing air defense for Leningrad and the Leningrad Military District. On 1 May 1953, it included four fighter aviation divisions part of the 25th Fighter Air Defence Army (the 20th, 41st, 44th, and the 50th), three anti-aircraft artillery divisions (the 25th, 29th, and the 42nd), a separate anti-aircraft artillery regiment, and seven separate anti-aircraft artillery battalions. These numbered 33,200 men, 256 fighter aircraft, 950 anti-aircraft guns (including 261 light guns), and 52 radars. In June 1954, the region was reorganized into the Special Leningrad Air Defence Army, and the 25th Fighter Army abolished with its divisions brought under the direct control of the new army. When surface-to-air missiles were introduced in the air defence forces between 1958 and 1959, four Air Defence Brigades of Special Designation were formed in the army: the 82nd, 83rd, 84th, and 86th, equipped with S-75 Dvina missiles. These brigades were planned to be controlled by a coordinated missile defence system forming a ring around Leningrad, known as the System-100 Missile Zone. Additionally, the S-75s were to be bolstered by three regiments of long-range multi-target Dal missiles, whose formation began in the fall of 1960. The closed military town of Khvoyny was built to house the headquarters of the system.  6th Independent Air Defence Army  In March 1960,Michael Holm, 18th ADC, accessed March 2012 the 6th Independent Air Defence Army (6-я отдельная армия ПВО) was formed from the Special Leningrad Air Defence Army. It controlled air defence units in Leningrad Oblast, Pskov Oblast, and the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. Between 1961 and 1962, the aviation division headquarters were disbanded and their regiments directly subordinated to the army headquarters. The Dal missile program was cancelled in late 1962, and the SAM brigades instead equipped with the S-125 and S-200 missiles. In the spring of 1967, the System-100 Zone was abolished and its units directly subordinate to the army headquarters or the 14th Air Defence Division. On 22 February 1968, the army was awarded the Order of the Red Banner in honor of the 50th anniversary of the Soviet Army. In early 1978, the 14th Division was transferred to the Baltic Military District, and in the spring of 1980 the army was reorganized into the 18th Air Defence Corps with the transfer of its fighter units to the Air Forces of the Leningrad Military District. The army was composed of regiments of interceptors and anti-aircraft missiles. It had two major tasks: to protect the most industrialized European part of the Soviet Union against possible U.S. cruise missile attack from the north via the North Pole (using Mikoyan MiG-31 interceptors), and to protect the deployment of nuclear submarines stationed in the Kola Peninsula (using Su-27 fighters). In early 1986, the PVO returned to the organization used during the 1960s and 1970s. As a result, in April 1986, the headquarters of the army was reestablished in Leningrad at 16 Baskov Pereulok from the headquarters of the 18th Corps. The army included the 27th Air Defence Corps at Riga, the new 54th Air Defence Corps with headquarters at Khvoyny, the 14th Air Defence Division at Tallinn, and the 498th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Training Brigade at Opochka. In turn, the 27th Corps of the PVO consisted in 1988 of the:Michael Holm, 27th Air Defence Corps, accessed February 2012 *54th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment PVO (Vainode, Latvian SSR) (38 Sukhoi Su-27P / UB) *689th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment PVO (Nivenskoye, Kaliningrad Oblast) (36 Sukhoi Su-27P / UB) *77th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade (Ventspils, Latvian SSR) *85th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade (Kaunas, Lithuanian SSR) *158th Guards Anti- Aircraft Rocket Brigade (Liepaya, Latvian SSR) *169th Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade (Neman, Kaliningrad Oblast) *183rd Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade (Gvardeysk, Kaliningrad Oblast) *205th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade (Riga, Latvian SSR) *529th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment (Ukmerge, Lithuanian SSR) *466th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment (Vilnius, Lithuanian SSR) *80th Radio-Technical Brigade (Tukums, Latvian SSR) *81st Radio-Technical Brigade (Pereslavskoye, Kaliningrad Oblast) *5th Radio-Technical Regiment (Paplaka, Latvian SSR) 54th Air Defence Corps included: *177th Fighter Aviation Regiment PVO (Lodeynoye Pole, Leningrad Oblast) (38 Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23MLD) *180th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment PVO at Gromovo-Sakkola, Leningrad Oblast) (31 Mikoyan MiG-31) *82nd Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade (Lomonosov, Leningrad Oblast) *83rd Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade (Zelenogorsk, Leningrad Oblast) *84th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade (Vaganovo, Leningrad Oblast) *86th Anti- Aircraft Rocket Brigade (Tosno-2, Leningrad Oblast) *204th Guards Anti- Aircraft Rocket Brigade (Kerstovo, Leningrad Oblast) *169th Guards Anti- Aircraft Rocket Regiment (Kornevo, Leningrad Oblast) *219th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment (Pervomayskoye-1) *341st Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment (Lopukhinka-2) *555th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment (Ostrov-2) *967th Anti- Aircraft Rocket Regiment (Tikhvin) *46th Radio-Technical Brigade (Khvoyny)  Russian Air Force  The Army was reformed within the Russian Air Force on June 1, 1998, from the 76th Air Army of the VVS and the 6th Independent Air Defence Army, both headquartered in Saint Petersburg.

He served as the secretary of foreign affairs for the Junta of Caracas, as Venezuela's first foreign minister, and as chief of the Executive during the First Republic of Venezuela. He was also editor for Gazeta de Caracas and ran the Correo del Orinoco. He was the main editor of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence, the chief architect of the Venezuelan Constitution of 1811 and the electoral rules for the election of the first Congress. He was also president of the Angostura Congress in 1819 and vice president of Gran Colombia.  Early years  Roscio was born to Italian migrant from Milan, Giovanni Roscio, and Paula María Nieves, a Venezuelan native from La Victoria.Biografía de Roscio Living in San Francisco de Tiznados, he studied Italian and Latin. He moved to Caracas in 1774 in order to further his studies, undertaken under tutelage from the Count of San Javier's daughter. He studied theology and civil law, attaining degrees in Canon law and civil law in 1794 and 1800 respectively. Filing for licensing at the Real Audiencia de Caracas in 1796, the College of Law alleged his unsuitability in light of irregularities in his maternal heritage claims, specifically his failure to state his \\"Indian\\" heredity. He appealed this determination in a nine-year-long process termed \\"trial of Inés María Paéz\\", after which he was admitted into the College. It is for this reason Roscio is considered an early defender of civil rights and anti-discrimination activist. Roscio is known to have contracted marriage with Guyanese native María Dolores Cuevas, with whom he had a daughter, Carmen Roscio Cuevas, born 10 March 1821.  Public life  Roscio was one of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence's most important ideologues, taking a leading role in the 19 April 1810 revolution, as \\"representative of the people\\". He held the foreign ministry during the Supreme Junta, during which time he lobbied for emancipation, particularly during the Constitutional COngress of 1811. Attending the Congress as a representative for Calabozo, he took part in redacting the declaration of independence signed on 5 July 1811. He also helped redact the 1811 Federal Constitution, approved on 21 December 1811. During August 1810 he founded the Sociedad Patriótica, later attended by Francisco de Miranda, and where Simón Bolívar was to give his notable \\"Acaso 300 años de calma no bastan\\" speech. He was elected substitute member of the 1812 triumvirate that March. As part of his role, he supported ascribing Miranda the title of Generalisimo and Dictator of Venezuela. Following Domingo de Monteverde's triumph and the defeat of the First Republic, Roscio was sent to jail in the Arsenal de la Carraca in Spain. He was then transferred to Ceuta, along with seven co-prisoners, including José Cortés de Madariaga, Juan Pablo Ayala, Juan Paz del Castillo, Francisco Isnardi, Joseph Mires and Juan Baraona. He escaped to Gibraltar in 1814 with three of them, but was extradited to Spain by the British authorities. Roscio sent, through close friend Thomas Richard, a letter to King George IV, which played a part in Fernando VII's decision to release the four prisoners. Roscio then travelled to Jamaica and then the United States, where he published Triunfo de la libertad sobre el despotismo (Philadelphia, 1817). He supported Simón Bolívar in 1818 at Angostura, throughout the creation of the Third Republic of Venezuela and the formulation of Gran Colombia. During this time he acted as finance minister and president of the Angostura Congress, as well as vice president of the Department of Venezuela and Gran Colombia. Roscio died on the eve of acting as president of the Cúcuta Congress, on 10 March 1821. Roscio created paper money in Venezuela, proposing the name \\"Bolívar\\", which remains to this day. He was also founding member of the Orinoco Mail, its second director; and lobbied for the creation of a national library.. In 2011, his remains were decreed to be interred in the National Pantheon of Venezuela, a process which has been delayed due to difficulties in properly identifying his actual remains.Busto dedicato a Roscio  References Further reading * Bolívar, Reinaldo.

It represents the combined kinetic and potential energy of the vehicle at any given time. It is the total energy of the vehicle (relative to the Earth's surface) per unit weight of the vehicle and being independent of the mass of the vehicle provides a powerful tool for the design of optimal trajectories. Aircraft-specific energy is very similar to specific orbital energy except that it is expressed as a positive quantity. A zero value of aircraft-specific energy represents an aircraft at rest on the Earth's surface, and increases as speed and altitude increases. Orbital specific energy is zero at infinite altitude and decreases as one approaches the surface of the earth. As with other forms of specific energy, aircraft- specific energy is an intensive property and is represented in units of length since it is independent of the mass of the vehicle. Applications The field of trajectory optimization has made use of the concept since the 1950s in the form of energy analysis. In this approach, the specific energy is defined as one of the dynamic states of the problem and is the slowest varying state. All other states such as altitude and flight path angle are approximated as infinitely fast compared to the specific energy dynamics. This assumption allow the solution of optimal trajectories in a relatively simple form. The specific energy is computed by the total energy (as defined above relative the Earth's surface) divided by the mass of the vehicle. It is a key element in performance of aircraft and rockets. For a rocket flying vertically (in a vacuum), it is the apogee that the rocket would obtain. It is used extensively in Energy–maneuverability theory that is used to determine the optimal paths for aircraft in dogfights.

Hoeflin to facilitate psychometric research, the Mega Society is a high IQ society open to people who have scored at the one-in-a-million level on a test of general intelligence claimed to be able to discriminate at that level. The public profile of the Mega Society increased with the publication of the Mega Test in 1985 by Hoeflin. (also archived at ) Criteria for acceptance No professionally designed and validated IQ test claims to distinguish test-takers at the one-in-a-million level of rarity of score. The standard score range of the Stanford-Binet IQ test is 40 to 160. The standard scores on most other currently normed IQ tests fall in the same range. A score of 160 corresponds to a rarity of about 1 person in 30,000 (leaving aside the issue of error of measurement common to all IQ tests), which falls short of the Mega Society's 1 in a million requirement. IQ scores above this level are dubious as there are insufficient normative cases upon which to base a statistically justified rank-ordering. High IQ scores are less reliable than IQ scores nearer to the population median. The Mega Society accepts members on the basis of untimed, unsupervised IQ tests that the test author claims have been normalized using standard statistical methods. There is controversy about whether these tests have been properly validated. The Mega test specifically is described as a \\"nonstandardized test\\" by a psychologist who wrote a 2012 book on the history of IQ testing. The Guinness Book of World Records once stated that the most elite ultra High IQ Society is the Mega Society with percentiles of 99.9999 or one in a million required for admission.

Biography Ahmed Agdamski acting as Leyli from Leyli and Majnun (opera) Ahmadbey Badalbeyli was born on January 5, 1884, in Shusha, Azerbaijan. He attended circles of theater-lovers and participated in national spectacles from his childhood. Scenic activity of the actor began in 1910, with attendance of a theatrical troupe of “Nijat” charity union. He was famous for his performance of women roles in various operas in the early history of Azeri Opera, when women's appearance on stage was strictly forbidden by religion and tradition. But later he began to play male parts, too. Besides all these he also was engaged in pedagogic activity. He was always persecuted because of playing women's parts. Ahmedbey changed his surname and address. For several years he was known as Miri. At the beginning of the 1920s he returned to Karabakh, where he established a theatrical troupe in Agdam city, in 1923. In 1934, he moved to Agdash.Əhməd Ağdamski In 1943, Ahmad Agdamski was conferred “Honored Art Worker of Azerbaijan” title. He died on April 1, 1954. Creativity In the 19th and 20th centuries, there were no women- actress in Azerbaijan and this is why men played female parts. Ahmed Agdamski, whose nice voice and fine constitution helped him in creation female roles, was one of them. He played pieces of Leyli (“Leyli and Majnun”), by persuasion of his brother Badalbey and because of refusal of Farajov (because of persecution of theater-haters), Asli (“Asli and Karam”), Gulnaz (“If Not That One, Then This One”), Gulchohra (“Arshin mal alan”), Minnat khanim (“Husband and wife”) and Tahmina (“Rustam and Zohrab”) from operas written by his cousin Uzeyir Hajibeyov. In “Shah Abbas and Khurshid Banu” he acted as poet Khurshidbanu Natavan. In 1916, Agmed Agdamski was shot in “Arshin mal alan”, the first Azerbaijani comedy-film, which was based on motifs of an opera of the same name written by Uzeyir Hajibeyov.

It is the last large undiked island in the Fraser River's North Arm. History The War Kitimat was constructed on Poplar Island, in 1918. In 1879, the federal government allocated three reserves to the New Westminster Indian Band, including on Poplar Island. A smallpox epidemic devastated the local people, known as the Qayqayt after the name of their main village on the east bank of the Fraser, reducing the band members from about 400 people to under 100. Many of the remaining inhabitants of Qayqayt were assimilated into other local reserves, such as the neighbouring Musqueam Indian Band. Their reserve on Poplar Island was turned into an Aboriginal smallpox victim quarantine area. For decades, the Poplar Island reserve was designated as belonging to \\"all coast tribes\\". In 1916 the remaining land on Poplar Island was turned over to the BC Government. During World War I the New Westminster Construction and Engineering Company built both a massive shipyard on the island and a bridge connecting it to New Westminster. During the war years, hundreds of workers built, among other things, four warships for the government of France. Cargo vessels built in the shipyard include the War Kitimat, War Comox, War Edensaw, and the War Ewen. Ship launching ways are still visible on the island’s upriver end. In 1936, the bridge gave out but by then, only fisheries warden William Albert Bowcott and his family lived on the island, and in 1945 the island was bought by New Westminster, which immediately sold it to Rayonier Canada, a forest company that used the island mainly as an anchorage for its log booms. Over the years, the trees grew back. The B.C. government included the island in its \\"nature legacy\\" program in 1995, and it was to be held by the Metro Vancouver's park department as a strictly protected nature reserve, in perpetuity. The Qayqayt First Nation, a \\"revived\\" band government, is trying to regain control of the island to reinstate it as a landbase (it currently is the only chartered First Nations government in Canada with no land base).

Relief which shows a Christian king from Himyar wearing a crown, c. 450 - c. 525 CE?Paul Yule, A Late Antique Christian king from Himyar, Southern Arabia, Old South Arabia, Antiquity, vol. 87, issue 338, December 2013, 1124–35 Ẓafār or Dhafar () ' (museum: UTM: 435700E, 1571160 N zone 38P, 14°12'N, 44°24'E, deviating slightly from Google Earth) is an ancient Himyarite site situated in Yemen, some 130 km south- south-east of today's capital, Sana'a, and c. southeast of Yarim. Given mention in several ancient texts, there is little doubt about the pronunciation of the name.Walter W. Müller, Encyclopedia of Islam 11 fasc. 185-186 (2001) 379-380 s.v. Zafar Despite the opinion of local patriots in Oman, this site in Yemen is far older than its namesake there.G. Rex Smith, Ẓafār, Encyclopedia of Islam 11 fasc. 185-186 (2001) 380-381 s.v. Zafar It lies in the Yemenite highlands at some 2800 m. Zafar was the capital of the Himyarites (110 BCE - 525 CE), which at its peak ruled most of the Arabian Peninsula.Paul Yule, Himyar-Spätantike im Jemen/Late Antique Yemen (Aichwald 2007) The Himyar are not a tribe, but rather a tribal confederacy.Walter W. Müller, Himyar, Reallexikon für Antike und Christentum, v. 15 (Stuttgart 1991) 303-331 For 250 years the confederacy and its allies combined territory extended past Riyadh to the north and the Euphrates to the north-east. Zafar was the Himyarite capital in Southern Arabia prior to the Aksumite conquest. History From an archaeological perspective, the settlement's beginnings are not well known. The main sources consist of Old South Arabian musnad inscriptions dated as early as the 1st century BCE. It is mentioned by Pliny in his Natural History, in the anonymous Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (both 1st century CE), as well as in the Geographia of Claudius Ptolemaeus (original 2nd century CE). At some point, presumably the medieval times the coordinates of the Ptolemy map were incorrectly copied or emended so that subsequent maps place the site Sephar metropolis in Oman, not in the Yemen. The Zafar in Yemen is more than 1000 years older than that place-name in Oman, assuming from the evidence in known texts (Smith 2001: 380). Written sources regarding Zafar are numerous, but heterogeneous in informational value. The most important source is epigraphic Old South Arabian. Christian texts shed light on the war between the Himyar and the Aksumites (523 - 525). The Vita of Gregentios is a pious forgery created by Byzantine monks, which mentions a bishop who allegedly had his see in Zafar. It contains linguistic usage possibly of the 12th century CE.A. Berger (ed.), Life and Works of Saint Gregentios, Archbishop of Taphar… Millennium Studies in the Culture and History of the First Millennium C.E. vol. 76 (2006) According to Arab geographer and historian, Al-Hamdani (c. 893-945), Zafar was also known by the name Ḥaql Yaḥḍib (\\"the field of Yaḥḍib\\").Al-Hamdāni, al-Ḥasan ibn Aḥmad, The Antiquities of South Arabia - The Eighth Book of Al-Iklīl, Oxford University Press 1938, p. 20 Individual finds belong to the Himyarite early period (110 BCE - 270 CE). Rare earlier finds were probably brought to the site from elsewhere. Most of the ruins and finds, however, appear to belong to the empire period (270 - 525). A few post-war Ge'ez inscriptions have survived at the site. From the late/post period identifiable finds are few indeed at Zafar. After this there is little to suggest an occupation until recent times. The excavated finds are important because the texts shed little light on the material culture and art of this age. Moreover, recently the chronology of the main coin series has been attacked.Armin Kirfel/Winfried Kockelmann/Paul Yule, Non-destructive Chemical Analysis of Old South Arabian Coins, 4th Century BCE – 3rd century, Archeometry vol. 53, 2011, 930–949. URL: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-4754.2011.00588.x/abstract Already an established big town, Sana'a and its fortress Ghumdan, replaced Zafar as capital probably between 537 and 548. The textual basis is thin regarding this topic. At the same time the archaeological record in Zafar and the surrounding region breaks off. No textual tradition articulates its destruction. Only an Aksumite church was recorded as being destroyed in 523. This church, likely built by the Christian missionary Theophilos the Indian, was destroyed by Dhu Nawas following the Himyarite conversion to Judaism. It was later restored after Aksum's successful invasion on Himyar in 524. There is evidence that Zafar and settlement in general in the Yemenite highlands declined drastically in the 5th and 6th centuries.cf. Jérémie Schiettecatte, D’Aden à Zafar villes d’Arabie du sud préislamique, Orient & Mediterranée Archéologie no 6, Paris 2011 Ideally, the viability of the city correlates declines drastically just after a relief of a crowned man was erected in what the excavator terms the Stone Building Site. The date of this relief and its inscription difficult, both perhaps to the mid 5th century. The occurrence in Zafar of ribbed amphorae manufactured in Aqaba/Ayla evidently in order to transport wine, shows the area just north of Aqaba to have been a fruitful agricultural area. On the other hand, D. Fleitmann has studied speliotherms from al-Hootha cave in central Oman and has gathered information for megadroughts especially around 530. These may have afflicted the entire Peninsula. A rectangular mapped surface area comprises 120 hectares. But the settlement is of uneven density and smaller than this. Zafar is the second largest mapped archaeological site in Arabia after Marib. Ancient settlement occurs inside and outside the ancient city defences. These have been estimated at 4000 metres long. The main fortress today is still referred to as the \\"Husn Raydan\\". A text by the medieval Yemenite author al-Hamdani mentions the names of city gates, most of which are named after the town to which they face. The main architectural ruins at Zafar include tombs and on the south-western flank of the Husn Raydan a 30 x 30 m square stone court, as preserved, originally probably a temple, to judge from the accumulation of cattle bones which it contained. It is located immediately north of a subterranean chambers and tombs. Immediately to the north are a row of storage chambers. The Husn Raydan and al-Gusr (standard Arabic: al-Qasr) 300 m to the north were once one fortification inside the city walls. Raydan South also was fortified and the ruined fortifications are best preserved here. Musnad texts mention five royal palaces at Zafar: Hargab, Kallanum, Kawkaban, Shawhatan and Raydan, the state palace. Smaller ones, such as Yakrub, also find mention. Nearby Himyarite period settlements include Maṣna‘at Māriya (ancient Samiʻān) and the Ǧabal al-‘Awd settlement, 25 air km to the south-east. The city was home to polytheist, Jewish and Christian communities. Jews dominated politically until 525. The ring-stone of Yishak bar Hanina is the earliest possible evidence for Jews in South Arabia. Surprisingly little evidence exists for the actual character and customs of these religions, far distant from their centres. Nor do the artefacts confirm a picture of the actual practices of Judaism and Christianity as we know them today. The vast majority of the sculpture suggests polytheistic belief was dominant in the population. One assumes in terms of religions a mixture of Christians, Jews and polytheists in late pre- Islamic times. An excavated 1.70 m tall image of a crowned figure represents a Christian king that wears an Aksumite-looking crown - the only image of that early religion to survive. At its apex Zafar had a flourishing sculptural industry attested to by a large number of relief fragments. But for a single example, the Heidelberg archaeologists were unable to positively identify churches or chapels on the site which no doubt existed Paul Yule (ed.), Ẓafār, Capital of Ḥimyar, Rehabilitation of a ‘Decadent’ Society, Excavations of the Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg 1998–2010 in the Highlands of the Yemen, Abhandlungen Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft, vol. 29, Wiesbaden 2013, 32, , From the 3rd to mid-6th centuries Zafar was a bustling international centre with a booming local and international trade. Yule estimated a 4th-century population of some 25,000, based partly on the surface area and population density.Paul Yule (ed.), Ẓafār, Capital of Ḥimyar... Evidence of trade comes in the form of Late Roman period amphorae such as that depicted below. Many were produced in Aqaba, Jordan as we know from excavations there. Aqaba was a center where goods were loaded, re-packed and re-exported. About 500 such sherds and vessels came to light in Zafar, the number rivalling that at Adulis and Aqaba.M. Raith–R. Hoffbauer–H. Euler–P. Yule–K. Damgaard, Archaeometric Study of the Aqaba Late Roman Period Pottery Complex and Distribution in the 1st Millennium CE, Zeitschrift für Orient-Archäologie, 6, 2013, 320–350, . While wine is often mention as an import, livestock, textiles, meat, fish and fish sauce were also imported. The contemporary environment is vastly inferior to that which provided the resource base for the early Himyarite tribal confederation. Despite some 500 mm precipitation per year, Water is scarce, upland soils are chronically eroded; the tree cover was eliminated perhaps in the empire period. Given the exhaustion of natural resources, civil strife, epidemics and megadroughts the Himyarite period population declined especially in the 6th century. Today, some 450 farmers inhabit the former capital. Excavations at Ẓafār yielded 19 cultivated species including eight cereals, four oil and fibre plants, three pulses, three fruits and one spice. Hordeum is the most important cerealManfred Rösch & Elske Fischer, Charred plant remains, in Yule, Late Antique Arabia Ẓafār 2013, 187-94. The Stone Building also yielded most of 6000 excavated animal bones. The Stone Guilding seems to have functioned as a slaughterhouseMargarethe and Hans-Peter Uerpmann, Animal remains in Yule, Late Antique Arabia Ẓafār 2013, 194-219. An early 6th century relief statue has been identified as a king of Byzantine type,Paul Yule, A Late Antique Christian king from Himyar, Southern Arabia, Old South Arabia, Antiquity, vol. 87, issue 338, December 2013, 1124–35 perhaps a representation of king Sumūyafaʿ Ashwaʿ. In 1970, Italian orientalist Giovānnī Garbinī discovered a Sabaean inscription on a column in Bayt al-Ašwāl near Zafar [Dhofār], whereon is engraved a later writing in Assyrian (Hebrew) script which reads: \\"The writing of Judah, of blessed memory, Amen shalom amen.\\"Shelomo Dov Goitein, The Yemenites – History, Communal Organization, Spiritual Life (Selected Studies), editor: Menahem Ben-Sasson, Jerusalem 1983, pp. 334–339. The script is believed to date to the 4th-century CE. The inscription attests to the multi-ethnic make-up of the peoples of South Arabia at that time.

V. Kunhiraman (1871 - 1949) was an Indian social reformer, journalist and the founder of Kerala Kaumudi daily. A follower of Sree Narayana Guru, Kunhiraman was the author of a number of books covering the genres of novels, short story, poetry, biographies and essays. He was one of the leaders involved in the Vaikom Satyagraha of Reformation movement in Kerala which led to the Temple Entry Proclamation.  Biography  Kunhiraman was born on February 6, 1871 at Mayyanad in Kollam district of the south Indian state of Kerala to Njarakkal Vasudevan, an astrologer and magician, and Kallumpurathu Kunjichali. After early education at Mayyanad L. M. S. School, he joined the Government High School, Kollam but had to discontinue studies after 8th standard and started his career at the Forest department in 1893 as a clerk during which time he resumed his studies to pass the teachers' examination to become a teacher in 1894 at Vellamanal School, Mayyanad. He taught at a number of schools at Kollam, Kadakkavoor, Kayikkara and Paravur before returning to Vellamanal school by which time he had passed the lawyers' examination and resigned from the school in 1913 to take up the career of a lawyer by practicing at the Magistrate Court at Paravur. In between, he founded Kerala Kaumudi daily in 1911 and later, he shifted his base to Kollam, after quitting his career as a lawyer, resuscitated Kerala Kaumudi daily in 1920 with the assistance of his son, K. Sukumaran. His early journalistic articles were published in Sujananadini, run by Paravoor Kesavan Asan , where he became a sub-editor in due course and wrote poems and articles, mostly on social affairs. Kunhiraman was married to Kunjikkavu and the couple had two sons, K. Sukumaran and K.Damodaran and a daughter, Vasanthi, who was married to C. Kesavan, former chief minister of Travancore-Cochin. He died on April 10, 1949, at the age of 78.  Legacy = Kerala Kaumudi To launch a newspaper of his own was his all time-dream. In 1911, C.V. launched Kerala Kaumudi as a weekly newspaper. He was the proprietor - editor, printer, publisher and even the proofreader! Started in 1911, in Mayyanad, it had grown over the years as one of the most influential dailies in Malayalam with 9 editions from Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Kochi, Thrissur, Kozhikode and Kannur.  Other journalistic contributions  Kunhiraman was also the editor of Malayalarajyam, Navajeevan, Kathamalika, Yukthivadi, Navasakthi and Vivekodayam.

He had been on the editorial board of Malayala Rajyam, Navajeevan, Navasakthi, Malayala Manorama, Bhashaposhini, Kathamalika, Vivekodayam and Yuktivadi.  Literary contributions  Kunhiraman's oeuvre comprises 14 books, covering the genres of novel, short story, poetry, biography and other works including the condensed versions of Mahabharata and Ramayana, of which Valmiki Ramayanam, a prose rendering of the epic, was his first work to come out in print, in 1901, followed by Vyasabharatam, Panchavadi and other works. This include four novels, a short story anthropology, a book of poetry and his reminiscences of Kumaran Asan.  Social activities  Kunhiraman was a close associate of Narayana Guru and an active participant in the intellectual and social activities of Sivagiri Mutt. He was one of the leaders of the Vaikom Satyagraha, a social protest against untouchability, centred around the Shiva temple at Vaikom during 1924–25.

The sinking In February 1942 British Malaya and Singapore had surrendered to the Japanese Army. Over 100,000 British and Empire military personnel had become prisoners as well as thousands of civilians. A few thousand more were escaping to the nearby Netherlands East Indies and from there to Australia, Ceylon or India in any ship that could be found. Many of these ships were lost to Japanese attacks among the islands scattered around Sumatra and Java while attempting to escape. Rooseboom under Captain Marinus Cornelis Anthonie Boon, was taking around 500 passengers (mainly British military personnel and civilians) from Padang to Colombo in Ceylon. On 1 March 1942 at 11:35pm Rooseboom was steaming west of Sumatra when it was spotted by the Japanese submarine I-59 (which was later re designated I-159) under the command of Lieutenant Yoshimatsu and torpedoed. Rooseboom capsized and sank rapidly leaving one life boat (designed to hold 28) and 135 people in the water. Eighty people were in the lifeboat the rest clung to flotsam or floated in the sea. Two of these survivors were picked up nine days later by the Dutch freighter Palopo. Until the end of the Second World War they were assumed to be the only survivors. The lifeboat The story of the survivors on the lifeboat was told by Walter Gardiner Gibson (a corporal from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) in a book in 1952; he is the only known witness of the events that would occur on the lifeboat over the next 26 days. His tale was told to the British authorities after the war but was first heard publicly in court in Edinburgh in 1949 in order to confirm that Major Angus Macdonald was dead so that his estate could be settled. According to Gibson in and around the lifeboat were an estimated 135 survivors, many with injuries, including Gibson himself who was in the lifeboat due to those injuries. Among the survivors were the Captain M.C.A. Boon and the senior surviving British officer Brigadier Archibald Paris (who had commanded the 15th Indian Infantry Brigade during the Battle of Malaya).Smith p. 552 There were also two other Argyll officers aboard the Rooseboom; Major Angus Macdonald, second in command of the Argylls and Captain Mike Blackwood. These two officers were chiefly responsible for holding up a Japanese tank column during the Battle of Bukit Timah.Smith p. 491 Paris, MacDonald, Blackwood and number of the other military passengers were among a selected few of the most proven fighters chosen to be evacuated instead of being lost to a POW camp. By the time the boat had drifted for more than , to ground on a coral reef less than from Padang, Roosebooms starting point, only five of its 80 passengers remained alive, and one of those drowned in the surf while trying to land. In Gibson's account the ordeal that followed the sinking showed the worst of human nature under some of the most extreme conditions. On the first night many of those in the water drowned or gave up. Some twenty men built a raft from flotsam and towed it behind the boat. The raft slowly sank and all twenty perished three days later. In the first few days discipline collapsed men and women went mad with thirst, some drinking sea water, which sent them into hallucinations. Many threw themselves overboard rather than face further suffering, and a gang of five renegade soldiers positioned themselves in the bows and at night systematically pushed the weaker survivors overboard to make the meagre rations go further. Gibson claims to have organised an attack on the renegades with a group of others who rushed them and pushed them en masse into the sea. Brigadier Paris died, hallucinating before he fell into his final coma. The Dutch captain was killed by one of his own engineers. Towards the end Gibson realised that all who remained alive were himself, another white man, a Chinese woman named Doris Lin and four Javanese seamen. That night the Javanese attacked the other white man, killed and then ate part of him. Later the oldest Javanese died.Smith pp. 552–553 The lifeboat fetched up on Sipora an island off Sumatra and only from Padang where the Rooseboom started its journey 30 days earlier. One of the Javanese seaman drowned in the surf while the other two disappeared into the jungle and have never been found. After a period of being treated by some of the local population Doris Lin and Gibson were discovered by a Japanese patrol. Gibson was returned to Padang as a POW while Lin was shot as a spy soon afterwards. Gibson told his story in the book The Boat published in 1952 and in a second book Highland Laddie in 1954. He died in Canada, where he had settled, on 24 March 2005, aged 90. Senior officer casualties Many of the officers and men who boarded Rooseboom were evacuated from Singapore because of their specialist knowledge or skills and would therefore have been men of some importance to the war effort. *Brigadier Archibald Paris (CO 12th Indian Brigade) *Colonel Richard Louis Mortimer Rosenberg (Royal Corps of Signals, Malaya Command) *Group Captain Reginald Lewis Nunn, DSO (Director of Public Works, Singapore; CO Malayan Volunteer Air Force; a former Major of Royal Engineers) *Lt.Col.

Rattlesnake round-ups (or roundups), also known as rattlesnake rodeos, are annual events common in the rural Midwest and Southern United States, where the primary attractions are captured wild rattlesnakes which are sold, displayed, killed for food or animal products (such as snakeskin) or released back into the wild. Rattlesnake round-ups originated in the first half of the 20th century for adventure and excitement, as well as to achieve local extirpation of perceived pest species.Means, B. 2009. Effects of rattlesnake roundups on the eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus). Herpetological Conservation and Biology 4:132-141. Typically a round-up will also include trade stalls, food, rides, and other features associated with fairs, as well as snake shows that purport to provide information on rattlesnake biology, identification, and safety, but actually perpetuate misinformation and myths about snakes while demonstrating unsafe handling techniques. To date, round-ups where snakes are killed take place in Alabama, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Texas, with largest events in Texas and Oklahoma.Fitzgerald, L. A., and C. W. Painter. 2000. Rattlesnake Commercialization: Long-Term Trends, Issues, and Implications for Conservation. Wildlife Society Bulletin 28:235–253. Many round-ups are no longer slaughtering snakes, but have transitioned to educational festivals celebrating rattlesnakes and other wildlife. All round-ups in Pennsylvania return snakes to the wild and two former round-ups in Georgia and Florida use captive animals for their festivals. The largest rattlesnake round-up in the United States is held in Sweetwater, Texas. Held annually in mid-March since 1958, the event currently attracts approximately 30,000 visitors per year and in 2006 each annual round-Up was said to result in the capture of 1% of the state's rattlesnake population, but there are no data or studies to support this claim. Round-ups have economic and social importance to the communities that hold them. The events often attract thousands of tourists, which can bring hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue into small towns; the Sweetwater Round-Up's economic impact was estimated to exceed US$5 million in 2006. Snake collectors often make large profits selling snakes at the events. Cash prizes and trophies are often given out to participants in categories like heaviest, longest, or most snakes. These incentives result in all size classes of snakes being targeted equally. Most roundups target the western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), though some events target prairie rattlesnakes (C. viridis), timber rattlesnakes (C. horridus), or the eastern diamondback rattlesnake (C. adamanteus).Fitch, H.S. 2003. Reproduction in the rattlesnakes of the Sharon Springs, Kansas Roundup. Kansas Journal of Herpetology 8: 23-24. A harvest of several hundred to several thousand kilograms of snakes is typical for many roundups. In Texas, up to 125,000 snakes could have been removed annually from the wild during the 1990s. However, effects of roundups on rattlesnake populations are unclear. Harvest size at roundups is highly variable from year to year but does not show a consistent downward trend, even after decades of annual roundup events in some areas. C. atrox is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN.Frost, D.R., Hammerson, G.A. & Santos-Barrera, G. 2007. Crotalus atrox. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2014.3. . Downloaded on 11 March 2015. However, poaching and roundups have been destructive to populations of timber rattlesnakes (C. horridus) in the northeastern United States. Some groups are concerned that C. atrox local populations may be declining rapidly, even if the global population is unaffected. Rattlesnake round-ups became a concern by animal welfare groups and conservationists due to claims of animal cruelty and excessive threat of future endangerment. In response, some Round-Ups impose catch size restrictions or releasing captured snakes back into the wild.

Bush, 323 F.3d 133 (1st Cir. 2003), was a court case challenging the constitutionality of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The case was dismissed, since the plaintiffs failed \\"to raise a sufficiently clear constitutional issue.\\"Summary of the case: John Doe I v. President Bush Retrieved 8/7/2007. The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 was challenged by \\"a coalition of U.S. soldiers, parents of U.S. soldiers, and members of Congress\\" prior to the invasion to stop it from happening. They claimed that an invasion of Iraq would be illegal. Judge Lynch wrote of their argument, \\"They base this argument on two theories. They argue that Congress and the President are in collision -- that the President is about to act in violation of the October Resolution. They also argue that Congress and the President are in collusion -- that Congress has handed over to the President its exclusive power to declare war.\\"Doe v. Bush Opinion by Judge Lynch 3/13/2003 Pages 3,4,10,23,25,26. Retrieved 8/7/2007. The case was dismissed on February 24, 2003 by Judge Joseph Tauro of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The petitioners appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. On March 13, a three-judge panel affirmed the decision to dismiss the complaint. The opinion was written by Judge Sandra Lea Lynch: > An extreme case might arise, for example, if Congress gave absolute > discretion to the President to start a war at his or her will... Plaintiffs' > objection to the October Resolution does not, of course, involve any such > claim. Nor does it involve a situation where the President acts without any > apparent congressional authorization, or against congressional opposition... > To the contrary, Congress has been deeply involved in significant debate, > activity, and authorization connected to our relations with Iraq for over a > decade, under three different presidents of both major political parties, > and during periods when each party has controlled Congress. Lynch also cited Massachusetts v. Laird 451 F.2d 26 (1st Cir. 1971), which similarly found that the Vietnam War was constitutional. Lynch concluded that the Judiciary could not intervene, because there was not a fully developed conflict between the President and Congress at that time. On March 17, the plaintiffs filed for a rehearing. Their petition was denied the next day. Iraq was invaded on March 20.

Davison and Freddie Davison, was an Australian novelist and short story writer. Whilst several of his works demonstrated his progressive political philosophy, he is best known as \\"a writer of animal stories and a sensitive interpreter of Australian bush life in the tradition of Henry Lawson, Joseph Furphy and Vance Palmer.\\"Wilde et al. (1994) p. 221 His most popular works were two novels, Man-shy and Dusty, and his short stories. Life Davison was born in Hawthorn, Victoria, and christened as Frederick Douglas Davison. His father was Frederick Davison, a printer, publisher, editor, journalist and writer of fiction; and his mother was Amelia, née Watterson. He was their eldest child.Darby (1993) He went to Caulfield State School, but left when he was 12, and worked on his father's land at Kinglake in the mountain range north of Melbourne,Smith (1980) p. 172 before moving to the United States with his family in 1909. Here Davison was apprenticed to the printing trade, and first started writing. Between 1909 and the beginning of World War I, he travelled widely in North America and the West Indies. However, with the beginning of the war, he went to England and enlisted, serving in France with the British cavalry. He met his wife Agnes (who was known as Kay) Ede in England while he was doing officer training at Aldershot and they married in 1915. They had a son and a daughter. Davison and his family came to Australia in 1919 after the war ended, and took up a Soldier Settlement selection near Injune, Queensland. However, the farm failed, and, in 1923, he and his family moved to Sydney, where he worked in real estate and as an advertising manager for his father's magazines, the Australian and Australia.Papers of Frank Dalby Davison He had a romantic relationship with fellow writer, Marjorie Barnard, through the late 1930s.Modjeska (1991) pp. 208–210 Barnard used an inversion of his name \\"Knarf\\" for the hero of her collaborative novel Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow. During World War II, he worked in government departments in Sydney and Melbourne. His marriage, which had been failing for some time, was dissolved, and in 1944 he married Edna Marie McNab. In 1951, they bought a farm called \\"Folding Hills\\" at Arthur's Creek (Victoria). He wrote his last major work, The White Thorntree (1968), here. Davison died in Melbourne on 24 May 1970. Writing career Davison began writing full-time during the depression, adopting, at this time, the names Frank Dalby to distinguish himself from his father. He won the Australian Literature Society Gold Medal for his novel Man-shy in 1931. Man-shy is \\"the story of a red heifer ... who learned to value freedom above everything\\".Smith (1980) p. 171 It was initially published in serial form in 1923–25 in his father's Australian magazine. Later, with the Depression impacting his earning ability, he tried to find a publisher. However, no-one was interested in a book \\"about a cow\\", so he published it himself. Angus & Robertson took it on after it won the Australian Literature Society's award. During the 1930s he worked as a real- estate agent and also as a special contributor to The Bulletin. He produced several stories and books, including the novel Children of the Dark People and the short story collection The Woman at the Mill. While Man-shy took over 7 years to be published, his last book, The White Thorntree, took over 22 years to write. Smith wrote in 1980 that it \\"deals with human beings and their sexual expressions of themselves as no other Australian writer has done\\". The first edition was published with a cover designed by artist and friend, Clifton Pugh.Smith (1980) p. 175 Davison was active in the Fellowship of Australian Writers and, through the 1930s, formed a close working relationship with Marjorie Barnard and Flora Eldershaw. Barnard, Eldershaw and Davison were known as the \\"triumvirate\\" for their work in developing progressive policies through the Fellowship on such issues as civil liberties and censorship. In the Acknowledgment for Dusty (1946) he wrote: > A few years ago I was granted a year's Fellowship by the Commonwealth > Literary Fund to carry out certain work. This is the first opportunity I > have had to make suitable acknowledgments. I am hoping this book will be > accepted as completing the undertaking of which the volume of short stories, > The Woman at The Mill, was the first part. This is not the novel I had in > mind – perhaps it is a better one! – but it accrues from that year in which > I had free time to work and grow, and for which I am grateful to my fellow > citizens and the community of letters.Davison (1946) Acknowledgment He was also a long-time friend of Vance and Nettie Palmer and John Morrison.Morrison, pp.55-61. He was, in September 1949, a charter member of the Australian Peace Council. Davison wrote under several pseudonyms: T Bone; The Roo; Davison, Fred D.; Fred Davison, Junr; Fred Junr; Davison, F. Myall; Douglas, Frederick; Daly, Francis; Daniels, Frank; Sandes, John; McGarvie, Scott; F. D. D.AusLit (2007) His novel, Dusty was made into a film in 1983.Dusty (1983), IMDB Themes His concern about the destruction of the Australian natural environment and his political interest in promoting \\"liberal democratic values\\" are reflected in his writings. \\"He saw literature as a means by which people might be helped to know themselves and their society as a necessary prelude to reform\\". Smith suggests that while much of his writing focuses on nature and the land, several stories and his last book explore the emotional and sexual relationships between men and women.Smith (1980) p. 173 Awards *1931: Australian Literature Society Gold Medal for Man-shy *1938: MBE for services to literature *1939–40: Commonwealth Literary Fund Fellowship *1946: Argus prize for Dusty Bibliography * Man-Shy (1931) * The Wells of Beersheba (1933) * Blue Coast Caravan (1935) * The Wasteland (1935) * Children of the Dark People (1936) * The Woman at the Mill (1940) * Dusty (1946) * The Road to Yesterday (1964) * The White Thorntree (1968) * The Wells of Beersheba and Other Stories (1985, published posthumously) NotesExternal links *Dusty at IMDB Accessed: 2007-08-10 References *Darby, Robert (1993) 'Davison, Frank Dalby (1893–1970)', in Australian Dictionary of Biography, on-line edition Accessed: 2007-08-10 *Davison, Frank Dalby (1946) Dusty, New Edition 1976, London, Angus & Robertson *Modjeska, Drusilla (1981) Exiles at home: Australian women writers 1925–1945, London, Sirius *Papers of Frank Dalby Davison, Ms 1945 (National Library of Australia) *Morrison, John, (1987), The happy warrior, Melbourne, Pascoe Publishing, pp.55-61, *Smith, Graeme Kinross (1980) Australia's writers, West Melbourne, Nelson, pp. 170–6 * Wilde, W., Hooton, J. & Andrews, B (1994) The Oxford Companion of Australian Literature 2nd ed.

The 11th Army Air Force and Air Defense Army was reformed within the Eastern Military District on 14 August 2015.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/11-air-army.htm It was first formed during the Second World War from the Soviet Air Forces of the 2nd Red Banner Army. It was re-created in 1998 from the Soviet Air Defence Forces' 11th Air Defence Army units (except for a regiment of MiG-31 interceptor aircraft on the Kamchatka Peninsula, handed over by Russian Naval Aviation) and the 1st Air Army of the VVS. The 1st Army of the VVS had been reformed on 1 July 1957. In 2007 the commanding officer was Lieutenant General Valeriy Ivanov, former commander of the 1st Air Defence Corps. The 11th Army of VVS and PVO was disbanded in 2009 by being redesignated the 3rd Air and Air Defence Forces Command. The army was reformed once again in 2015. 11th Air Defence Army The 11th Air Defence Army (or 11th Army of the Soviet Air Defence Forces, 11 A PVO) appears to have been formed in 1960. During the Soviet period, the 11th Air Defence Army gained headlines due to the defection of Viktor Belenko in September 1976, and the KAL 007 shootdown in 1983. The KAL 007 shootdown occurred on 1 September 1983. After a protracted ground- controlled interception, three Su-15 fighters from Dolinsk-Sokol airbase and a MiG-23 from Smirnykh Air Base managed to make visual contact with the Boeing 747 and later shot it down. In the late 1980s the 11th Air Defence Army of the Voyska PVO, as it was then, controlled two corps (23rd in Vladivostok & 8th in Komsomolsk) and three divisions (24th in Petropavlovsk, 29th in Blagoveshchenk and 6th in Okhotsk), 10 fighter aviation regiments (IAPs), 8 SAM brigades/regiments and 9 radio-technical (radar) brigades/regiments.Feskov, et al (2004) p.151 In 2001 the 8th ADC was renamed the 25th Air Defence Division, and in 2009 renamed 11th Aerospace Defence Brigade. 24th Air Defence Division was activated 5.60 in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (Khomutovo), Sakhalin Oblast. 23rd Air Defence Corps 1988 HQ Vladivostok *22nd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment PVO (Tsentralnaya Uglovaya, Primorskiy Kray)()(http://eagle- rost.livejournal.com/310734.html) *47th Fighter Aviation Regiment PVO (Zolotaya Dolina (Unashi), Primorskiy Kray) (disbanded 1998) *530th Fighter Aviation Regiment PVO (Chuguevka, Primorskiy Kray) *821st Fighter Aviation Regiment PVO (Spassk-Dalny, Primorskiy Kray) (disbanded 1994) *130th Anti- Aircraft Missile Brigade (Vladivostok, Primorskiy Kray) *150th Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade (Zolotaya Dolina (Unashi), Primorskiy Kray) *267th Anti- Aircraft Missile Brigade (Filino, Primorskiy Kray) *639th Anti-Aircraft Missile Regiment (Vasilevka, Primorskiy Kray) *749th Anti-Aircraft Missile Regiment (Timofeevka, Primorskiy Kray) *1133rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Regiment (Lipovtsy, Primorskiy Kray) *10th Radio-Technical Brigade (Artem, Primorskiy Kray) *123rd Radio-Technical Regiment (Timofeevka, Primorskiy Kray) In 2001 renamed 93rd Air Defence Division; in 2009 renamed 12th Aerospace Defence Brigade. 6th Air Defence Division 1988 HQ Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Kamchatka Oblast *865th Fighter Aviation Regiment PVO (Petropavlovsk- Kamchatsky Airport (Yelizovo), Kamchatka Oblast) *191st Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade (Petropavlovsk-Kamchatka, Kamchatka Oblast) *60th Radio-Technical Regiment (Koryaki, Kamchatka Oblast) *124th Radio-Technical Regiment (Ust- Kamchatsk, Kamchatka Oblast) Formed from 222nd Fighter Aviation Division PVO May 1960; disbanded 1998. 24th Air Defence Division 1988 HQ Yuzhno- Sakhalinsk (Khomutovo) *121st Communications Center (Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (Khomutovo), Sakhalin Oblast) *41st Fighter Aviation Regiment PVO (Burevestnik, Iturup Island) *528th Fighter Aviation Regiment PVO (Smirnykh, Sakhalin Oblast) *777th Fighter Aviation Regiment PVO (Dolinsk-Sokol, Sakhalin Oblast) *328th independent Transport Aviation Squadron (Dolinsk-Sokol, Sakhalin Oblast) *140th Anti-Aircraft Missile Regiment (Poronaysk, Sakhalin Oblast) *752nd Anti-Aircraft Missile Regiment (Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (Khomutovo), Sakhalin Oblast) *891st Anti-Aircraft Missile Regiment (Okha, Sakhalin Oblast) *38th Radio-Technical Regiment (Smirnykh, Sakhalin Oblast) *39th Radio- Technical Regiment (Dolinsk, Sakhalin Oblast) *125th Radio-Technical Regiment (Goryachiye Klyuchi, Kurilsky District, Sakhalin Oblast (Iturup Island) Disbanded 1998. 11th Air Force and Air Defence Forces Army Following the amalgamation of the 11th Air Defence Army and the 1st Air Army, in 2007 the 11th Army included two regiments of Su-27 fighter aircraft, one of MiG-31 interceptors, two of Su-24 tactical bombers, two of Su-25 attack aircraft and one reconnaissance regiment of Su-24MRs.Air Forces Monthly, July & August 2007 issues.

The 23rd Fighter Aviation Regiment, located at Dzemgi (Komsomolsk-on-Amur), was the first Russian Air Force unit armed with the upgraded Su-27SM fighters. The 303rd Fighter Aviation Division fought with the 64th Fighter Aviation Corps of the Air Defence Forces during the Korean War, flying Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15s, though it is not certain that the current 303rd Division is the same unit that fought during that war.) The 303rd Fighter Aviation Division fought during Operation Bagration, and included the Normandie-Niemen regiment for a period. The most notable unit of the 11th Army in 2007 was the 18th Guards Vitebsk Normandie-Niemen Assault Aviation Regiment, stationed at Galyonki, which has been twice awarded the Red Banner and the Order of Suvorov. In 1943, during World War II, the regiment included the Normandie squadron of French pilots, which later became the independent regiment known as Normandie-Niemen. On 9 May 1995 (Victory Day), to commemorate these events, the 18th ShAP received the name Normandie-Niemen. Since March 1993, the unit operates the Sukhoi Su-25 attack aircraft.

It has a large residential population in waterside apartments.  History  The dock was constructed for boats using the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the Aire and Calder Navigation to tranship goods and commodities from Leeds city centre in 1843. It was primarily used to bring coal from collieries around Rothwell and Wakefield to supply heavy industries in Hunslet and business and commerce in Leeds city centre. The western side of the dock once had a large crane on tracks along the side of the dock to load and unload goods from canal barges. In the 1990s the surrounding area was made up of Victorian industrial buildings most of which were derelict. Throughout the second half of the 20th century the area suffered steady industrial decline. The mills and many heavy engineering works began to close, move further out of town or scale down. Construction of the £42.5 million purpose- built Royal Armouries Museum marked the start of the area's redevelopment which opened in March 1996. No further development was made until 2004 when a multi-storey car park opened followed by an Express hotel in August 2006. The retail and leisure sector was launched on 11 October 2008 with fashion shows from celebrity fashion consultant and TV presenter Gok Wan. However few retail chains were attracted to the area and the site failed to take off as a shopping centre. The site, which had been known as Clarence Dock, became New Dock in mid-2012 as part of a re-branding initiative. The site was bought by Allied London, and rebranded as Leeds Dock in 2013.  Facilities  Leeds Dock is the home of the Royal Armouries Museum, a major national museum. The site attracts around 1.5 million visitors a year. Although the site was originally intended to include a destination shopping centre, few shops opened and most of the shops that did open have since closed. Leeds Dock's main shopping street, 'The Boulevard' radiates southbound from Armouries Square. Another focal point is 'The Anchorage' at the top of the dock. Clarence House is a tower containing 227 apartments and six retail units.

It is one of the few recorded instances in the Old West of a one-on-one pistol quick-draw duel in a public place, in the manner later made iconic by countless dime novels, radio dramas, and Western films such as High Noon.http://www.straightdope.com/columns/040625.html, The Straight Dope: \\"Did Western gunfighters really face off one-on-one?\\" The first story of the shootout was detailed in an article in Harper's Magazine in 1867, making Hickok a household name and folk hero.  Prelude  Tutt and Hickok, both gamblers, had at one point been friends, despite the fact that Tutt was a Confederate Army veteran, and Hickok had been a scout for the Union Army. Davis Tutt originally came from Marion County, Arkansas, where his family had been involved in the Tutt–Everett War, during which several of his family members had been killed. He had come north to Missouri following the Civil War. Hickok had been born in Illinois, coming west after mistakenly thinking he had killed a man in a drunken brawl. The eventual falling out between Hickok and Tutt reportedly occurred over women. There were reports that Hickok had fathered an illegitimate child with Tutt's sister, while Tutt had been observed paying a great deal of attention to Wild Bill's paramour, Susanna Moore. When Hickok started to refuse to play in any card game that included Tutt, the cowboy retaliated by openly supporting other local card-players with advice and money in a dedicated attempt to bankrupt Hickok.  The card game  The simmering conflict eventually came to a head during a game of poker at the Lyon House Hotel (now called the \\"Old Southern Hotel\\"). Hickok was playing against several other local gamblers while Tutt stood nearby, loaning money as needed and \\"encouraging [them], coaching [them] on how to beat Hickok\\". The game was being played for high stakes, and Hickok had done well, winning about $200 ($ as of ) of what was essentially Tutt's money. Irritated by his losses and unwilling to admit defeat, Tutt reminded Hickok of a $40 debt from a past horse trade. Hickok shrugged and paid the sum, but Tutt was unappeased. He then claimed that Hickok owed him an additional $35 from a past poker game. \\"I think you are wrong, Dave,\\" said Hickok. \\"It's only twenty-five dollars. I have a memorandum in my pocket.\\" Tutt had a large following at the Lyon House and, encouraged by these armed associates, he decided to take the opportunity to humiliate his enemy. In the midst of their argument over the $10 difference in the debt (and while Hickok was still playing poker), Tutt grabbed one of Hickok's most prized possessions off the table, his Waltham repeater gold pocket watch, and announced that he would keep the watch as collateral until Hickok paid the full $35. Hickok was shocked and livid but, being outnumbered and outgunned, he was unwilling to resort to violence at the time. He quietly demanded that Tutt put the watch back on the table. Tutt reportedly replied only with an \\"ugly grin\\" and left the premises with the watch. Aside from publicly humiliating Hickok and taking his property, Tutt's demand for collateral on a debt from a fellow professional card player implied he thought Hickok was an insolvent gambler trying to avoid his debts. To ignore such an insult from Tutt would have ruined Hickok's career as a gambler in Springfield, which was reportedly his only source of income. Further, groups of Tutt's friends reportedly continued to mock Hickok after the initial confrontation, baiting him with talk of the pocket watch to see if he could be goaded into drawing in anger so he could be shot down by the whole group. After several days of this, Hickok's patience was at its breaking point. When a group of Tutt's supporters at the Lyon House mocked Hickok and announced that they had heard Tutt was planning to wear the watch \\"in the middle of the town square\\" the next day, Hickok reportedly replied, \\"He shouldn't come across that square unless dead men can walk.\\" Having apparently made up his mind, Hickok returned to his room to clean, oil and reload his pistols in anticipation of a confrontation with Tutt the next morning.  Failed negotiations  Although Tutt had humiliated his rival, Hickok's ultimatum essentially forced his hand. To go back on his very public boast would make everyone think he was afraid of Hickok, and so long as he intended to stay in Springfield, he could not afford to show cowardice. The next day, he arrived at the town square around 10:00 a.m. with Hickok's watch openly hanging from his waist pocket. The word quickly spread that Tutt was making good on his pledge to humiliate Hickok, reaching Hickok's own ears within an hour. According to the testimony of Eli Armstrong (and supported by two other witnesses, John Orr and Oliver Scott), Hickok met Tutt at the square and discussed the terms of the watch's return. Tutt now demanded $45. Armstrong tried to convince Tutt to accept the original $35 and negotiate for the rest later, but Hickok was still adamant that he only owed $25. Tutt then held the watch in front of Hickok and stated he would accept no less than $45. Both then said they did not want to fight and they went for a drink together. Tutt soon left, however, returning once again to the square, still wearing the watch. The shootout Wild Bill Hickok in 1869 At a few minutes before 6:00 p.m., Hickok was seen calmly approaching the square from the south, his Colt Navy in hand. His armed presence caused the crowd to immediately scatter to the safety of nearby buildings, leaving Tutt alone in the northwestern corner of the square. At a distance of about 75 yards, Hickok stopped, facing Tutt, and called out, \\"Dave, here I am.\\" He cocked his pistol, holstered it on his hip, and gave a final warning, \\"Don't you come across here with that watch.\\" Tutt did not reply, but stood with his hand on his pistol. Both men faced each other sideways in the dueling position and hesitated briefly. Then Tutt reached for his pistol. Hickok drew his gun and steadied it on his opposite forearm. The two men fired a single shot each at essentially the same time, according to the reports. Tutt missed, but Hickok's bullet struck Tutt in the left side between the fifth and seventh ribs. Tutt called out, \\"Boys, I'm killed,\\" ran onto the porch of the local courthouse and back to the street, where he collapsed and died.  Trial and aftermath  The next day, a warrant was issued for Hickok's arrest and two days later he was arrested. Bail was initially denied, as is common in murder cases. Hickok eventually posted a bail of $2,000 (equivalent to $ in present-day terms) on the same day, after the magistrate reduced the charge from murder to manslaughter based on the circumstances. Hickok was arrested under the name of William Haycocke (the name he had been using in Springfield) for the manslaughter of David Tutt. During the trial, the names were amended to J. B. Hickok and Davis Tutt/Little Dave, \\"little\\" being an equivalent to the present day \\"junior\\" to indicate having the same name as the father. Hickok's manslaughter trial began on August 3, 1865 and lasted three days. Twenty-two witnesses from the square testified at the trial. Hickok's lawyer was Colonel John S. Phelps, former Union military Governor of Arkansas. The prosecution was led by Major Robert W. Fyan; the judge was Sempronius H. Boyd. The trial transcripts have been lost, but newspaper reports indicate that Hickok claimed self-defense. The most disputed fact at the trial was who fired first. Only four witnesses actually watched the fight. Two claimed both men fired, but they could not tell who drew first. One said he was standing behind Hickok so he only saw Hickok draw, as his view of Tutt was blocked. Another said Tutt did not fire, but admitted noticing Tutt's gun had a discharged chamber. The other witnesses all stated that while they did not see the shooting, they heard only one shot. Despite Hickok's claim of self-defense being technically invalid under the state law pertaining to \\"mutual combat\\" (since he had come to the square armed and expecting to fight), the jury decided that he was justified in shooting Tutt. As Tutt was the initiator of the fight (by taking Hickok's watch) and the first to display overt aggression, and since two witnesses indicated that Tutt was the first to reach for his pistol, the unwritten law dictated that Hickok was justified and subsequently they absolved him of guilt. In fact, Hickok was seen as being honorable for giving Tutt several chances to avoid the conflict instead of shooting him the moment he felt he was shown disrespect. Judge Boyd gave the jury two apparently contradictory instructions. He first instructed the jury that a conviction was its only option under the law.\\"The defendant cannot set up justification that he acted in self-defense if he was willing to engage in a fight with deceased. To be entitled to acquittal on the ground of self-defense, he must have been anxious to avoid a conflict, and must have used all reasonable means to avoid it. If the deceased and defendant engaged in a fight or conflict willingly on the part of each, and the defendant killed the deceased, he is guilty of the offense charged, although the deceased may have fired the first shot.\\" However, he then instructed them that they could apply the unwritten law of the \\"fair fight\\" and acquit,\\"That when danger is threatened and impending a man is not compelled to stand with his arms folded until it is too late to offer successful resistance & if the jury believe from the evidence that Tutt was a fighting character & a dangerous man & that Deft. was aware such was his character & that Tutt at the time he was shot by the Deft was advancing on him with a drawn pistol & that Tutt had previously made threats of personal injury to Deft ... & that Deft shot Tutt to prevent the threatened impending injury [then] the jury will acquit\\" an action known as jury nullification, which allows a jury to make a finding contrary to the law. The trial ended in acquittal on August 6, 1865, after the jury deliberated for \\"an hour or two\\" before reaching a verdict of not guilty, which was not popular at the time.\\"Legal Culture, Wild Bill Hickok and the Gunslinger Myth\\" Steven Lubet UCLA Law Review, Volume 48, Number 6 (2001) (reprinted in Insights on Law & Society) A prominent Springfield attorney gave a speech to the crowd from the balcony of the court house, denouncing the verdict as \\"against the evidence and all decency\\" and there was talk of lynching Hickok. The verdict was expected and well in keeping with the \\"trail law\\" of the day; as stated by a modern historian, \\"Nothing better described the times than the fact that dangling a watch held as security for a poker debt was widely regarded as a justifiable provocation for resorting to firearms.\\" While Hickok felt humiliated by Tutt wearing the watch, Tutt could also claim the same humiliation if he failed to wear the watch, essentially bowing to Hickok's warning. Due to its notoriety, the gunfight has since received much research and attention. Several weeks after the gunfight, on September 13, 1865, Colonel George Ward Nichols, a writer for Harper's, sought out Hickok and began the interviews that would eventually turn the then-unknown gunfighter into one of the great legends of the Old West. Davis Tutt's body was initially buried in the Springfield City Cemetery, but was disinterred and reburied in Maple Park Cemetery in March 1883 by his half-brother Lewis Tutt, a former slave who was the son of Tutt's father and his female slave.Kimberly Harper White Man's Heaven: The Lynching and Expulsion of Blacks in the Southern Ozarks, 1894-1909 University of Arkansas Press, 2010 Pg 114 In 1874 Lewis Tutt was sworn in as Springfield's first African American Police officer.

In later life he became infamous for his luxurious tastes and cruelty to his slaves - when they displeased him, he had them fed to \\"lampreys\\" that he maintained for that purpose, which was deemed to be an exceedingly cruel act. When Vedius tried to apply this method of execution to a slave who broke a crystal cup, Emperor Augustus (Pollio's guest at the time) was so appalled that he not only intervened to prevent the execution but had all of Pollio's valuable drinking vessels deliberately broken. This incident, and Augustus's demolition of Vedius's mansion in Rome he inherited in his will, were frequently referred to in antiquity in discussions of ethics and of the public role of Augustus.  Biography  Publius Vedius Pollio, the son of a freedman, was born in the 1st century BC and attained membership of the equestrian orderDio 54.23.1.;. Vedius Pollio's first certain appearance in historical sources comes after Octavian (later Augustus) became sole ruler of the Roman world in 31 BC; at some point Vedius held authority in the province of Asia on behalf of the emperor.Syme, p. 28. A proconsul of Asia under Claudius cited an enactment of Vedius Pollio, confirmed by Augustus, as a precedent (Braund, no. 586). For a mere equestrian to govern this province was anomalous, and there were presumably special circumstances; Vedius' term of office could have been in 31-30 BC before the appointment of a regular proconsular governor, or after a major earthquake in 27 BC.Syme, p. 28; Momigliano et al., p. 1584. He later returned to Rome, and when Alexander and Aristobulus, the sons of Herod the Great, came to the city in about 22 BC, they may have stayed with him.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 15.343 says they stayed in \\"the house of Pollio\\", which could refer to either Vedius or Asinius Pollio. See Syme, p. 30. Despite these services to the state, it was for his reputed luxury and cruelty that Vedius would become best known. He owned a massive villa at Posillipo on the Gulf of Naples,Pausilypon, the imperial villa near Naples, R. T. GUNTHER, OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS, 1913 later described by the poet Ovid as \\"like a city\\".Ovid, Fasti 6.641. Most notoriously, he kept a pool of lampreys into which slaves who incurred his displeasure would be thrown as food.Dio 52.23.2; Pliny the Elder, Natural History 9.39; Seneca the Younger, On Clemency 1.18.2. Nevertheless, he retained, at least for a while, the friendship of Augustus, in whose honour he built a shrine or monument at Beneventum. On one occasion, Augustus was dining at Vedius' home when a cup-bearer broke a crystal glass. Vedius ordered him thrown to the lampreys, but the slave fell to his knees before Augustus and pleaded to be executed in some more humane way. Horrified, the emperor had all of Vedius's expensive glasses smashed and the pool filled in. According to Seneca, Augustus also had the slave freed; Dio merely remarks that Vedius \\"could not punish his servant for what Augustus also had done\\".Seneca the Younger, On Anger 3.40 (= Braund, no. 432); Dio 52.23.2-4. Villa of Vedius Pollio, Posillipo There are a number of less certain appearances that may be the same Vedius Pollio. A Vidius or Vedius, possibly the same, is mentioned in a letter of 46 BC as involved in a dispute with the scholar-politician Curtius Nicias.Cicero, Letters to Friends 9.10Syme, pp. 25-26, 28. As well, Ronald Syme suggests that the \\"Publius Vedius\\" who appears in Cicero's letters as a friend of Pompey may also be Vedius Pollio.Syme, p. 23-30. Cicero, governor of Cilicia, was travelling near Laodicea in 50 BC, when Publius Vedius met him with a large retinue, and several wild asses and a baboon in a chariot. Unimpressed, Cicero wrote to Atticus, \\"I never saw a more worthless man.\\"Cicero, Letters to Atticus 6.1. About this possible Vedius Pollio, Cicero adds a further anecdote: Publius Vedius, earlier, had left some items with Vindulus, who meanwhile had died. Vindulus's heir later examined the items and found five portrait-busts of married ladies, including the noted patrician Junia Secunda. Cicero took these to be trophies of Vedius' sexual conquests, and, while highly praising her publicly,Smith, William, Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology, Volume 2, Little and Brown, 1846, p. 657. in correspondence, criticizing her for the indiscretion, and her husband and brother for their lack of awareness of her conduct.Cic. ad Att. vi. 1Hall, John, Politeness and Politics in Cicero's Letters, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 116. But an affair, if it did occur, may have been with a sister, Junia Prima.Cicero, ad Atticum, vi. 1 Vedius died in 15 BC.Dio, Roman History, LIV.23 Among his many heirs, Augustus received a large part of Vedius's estate, including his villa at Posillipo, along with instructions to erect a suitable monument on the site. The emperor demolished at least part of Pollio's house in Rome and constructed in its place a colonnade, the Porticus of Livia in honour of his wife, which he dedicated in 7 BC.http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/pollio.htmlDio 52.23.5-6,55.8.2Ovid, Fasti 6.639-648. Legacy Vedius's treatment of his slaves and Augustus's conduct towards him became popular subjects for anecdotes in antiquity. During or shortly after Augustus's reign, Ovid praised his demolition of Vedius's house as a grand statement against immoral luxury made even at the emperor's own cost.Ovid, Fasti 6.645-648. Scott notes that in replacing the house with a public monument Augustus merely \\"carried out the terms of the will\\", and argues that any suggestion he wished to censure Vedius's memory may have been mere \\"gossip\\".Scott, p. 460. Also in the 1st century AD, Vedius's story was used by the philosopher Seneca the Younger and the encyclopedist Pliny the Elder. In two ethical treatises, Seneca used Vedius's treatment of the cup-bearer and Augustus's response to illustrate the extremes to which anger could lead and the need for clemency.Seneca the Younger, On Anger 3.40 (= Braund, no. 432); On Clemency 1.18.2. Pliny the Elder mentioned Vedius's lampreys in his Natural History while treating varieties of fish, noting the man's friendship with Augustus while ignoring the story of the latter's clemency.Pliny the Elder, Natural History 9.39. Pliny was no admirer of Augustus and his handling of the story has been seen as \\"a gratuitous jibe\\" at the emperor.Africa, p. 71. In a highly rhetorical passage, the Christian writer Tertullian stated that after executing slaves, Vedius had his lampreys \\"cooked straight away, so that in their entrails he himself might have a taste of his slaves' bodies too\\".Tertullian, On the Mantle 5.6, translated by Vincent Hunink. In several works, Adam Smith cited Augustus's intervention to save the cup-bearer in support of an argument that the condition of slaves was better under a monarchy than a democracy. He embellished the story by claiming that Augustus manumitted all of Vedius's slaves, a statement not based on any ancient source; in one 1763 lecture even estimating the value of the property their master thus lost.Africa, pp. 73-74.

Born in London to George Riley Snr, a well-educated bookseller, and Margaret Raby, he was the older brother of Edward Riley, also a merchant and pastoralist in Sydney. In 1804 Riley followed two of his sisters, who had married captains in the New South Wales Corps, Captain Ralph Wilson and Anthony Fenn Kemp, to Australia where, with his brother Edward who later followed, they went on to become two of Australia's richest men. Life Alexander Riley was born in Middlesex, London in 1778. Riley was the second oldest with two brothers, Edward Riley and Charles Riley, and three sisters, Frances, Margaret and Elizabeth. He Married Sophia Hardwicke in London on 30 October 1804, then left England in the Experiment arriving in Australia in June 1805. It was here that Lieutenant Governor Patterson looked upon Riley favourably and granted him generous land grants in the Liverpool area. Riley acquired a farm at the Hawkesbury in August 1805 then became storekeeper and magistrate for Port Dalrymple, where his two sisters lived with their families. Later that year Riley was appointed deputy-commissary which enabled him to grasp the possibilities of international trading. Riley travelled to the colony of Sydney in January 1809 with Patterson, after Patterson assumed command of New South Wales after William Bligh was stood down. It was here that Riley became devoted to his land grant at Liverpool, named Raby, after his mother's family, and his love of sheep began.  Other careers  Riley took on many careers for which he gained his wealth. Riley was known for his role in the international trading firm Jones & Riley, with Richard Jones, which conducted an import-export business between Calcutta and Canton. Jones & Riley continued until the 1820s. He developed a trading relationship with his brother Edward Riley, who lived in Calcutta, India, at the time as well as W.S.Davidson in Canton. He was one of the founders for the Bank of New South Wales in 1816, now Westpac, as well as the first marine insurance broker in New South Wales. In 1817 Riley left the business Jones & Riley and all his other commercial affairs in the hands of his brother Edward, who had moved to New South Wales around 1915. Riley bought the Harriet and on 22 December 1817, sailed with his family, back to London. It is believed that the reason for his move was frustration with the East India Company's monopoly over international trading. Back in London he operated a mercantile firm. It is believed Riley never returned to Australia, however he did continue to have dealings with New South Wales. In 1819 Riley joined the successful and highly respected firm Donaldson, Wilkinson & Co who were agents for the colonial trade. In August 1825, with the help of his brother Edward and nephew Edward Jr (b1806), Riley exported the first of many flocks of Saxon merino sheep to Australia in the Sir George Osborne. Travelling with the sheep was his nephew Edward Jr who was supposed to hand the sheep over to his father Edward, however due to his father's recent death the sheep remained in the care of Edward Jr. These laid the foundations Australia's wool economy, the backbone of Australia's prosperity for the next century. Later Riley was granted one of the first pastoral runs in the Yass- Canberra area. Riley died in London on 17 November 1833. NotesReferences *Rubinstein, W.

It includes the small hamlet of Barnyards. It is bounded by the parishes of Elie, Ceres, Cameron, St Monans, Carnbee, Newburn and Largo.Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland, by Francis Groome, 2nd edition 1896; article on Kilconquhar It is approximately 9 miles from north to south. Much of the land is agricultural or wooded. The village itself is situated inland, north of Kilconquhar Loch. Also in the civil parish are Colinsburgh and Largoward, the latter since 1860 being a separate ecclesiastical parish. The coastal village and royal burgh of Earlsferry was formerly in the parish, but in 1891 the burgh and that part of the parish south of the (now disused) Fife Coast Railway line and Cocklemill Burn was transferred to the parish of Elie.Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland, by Francis Groome, 2nd edition 1896; article on Earlsferry History Kilconquhar Castle was formerly owned by the Adams of Kilconquhar. Adam of Kilconquhar married Marjorie, Countess of Carrick to become the Earl of Carrick. Adam went to the Crusades with Prince Edward of England and died in Acre. His widow subsequently married Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale, who thus became Earl of Carrick and Lord of Kilconquhar. Their son was Robert the Bruce.Kilconquhar: A Hidden Gem by Jean Lindesay-Bethune 2011 There was another castle in the parish called Rires or Reres, belonging to the Forbes family. Margaret Beaton, Lady Reres, was a companion of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her husband Arthur Forbes was involved in the assassination of John Wood.Pitcairn, Ancient Criminal Trials, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1833), p. 40. The ruins of the castle were demolished and cleared away in the 19th-century. In the 18th century the village was noted as a weaving centre. This industry employed 235 persons in 1856 but faded in the late 19th century. The population was at a high in 1836 of 558 but dropped to 350 in 1881. By 2011 it had fallen to just over 200. Parish Church Kil in the name implies an early Christian origin for the church, but no early remains or carved stones of the period have been identified. The situation of the medieval parish church, on a mound near a loch, is a typical one for early sites. Kilconquhar Parish Church is within the Church of Scotland. The historic church building is still in regular use; it is an exact, but larger scale, copy, of Cockpen and Carrington Parish Church in Midlothian has an unusually tall tower for such a small parish. Mention of Saint Conquhar, a Scottish Saint, is found only in the 15th-century Perth Psalter. His saint's day is noted as May 3. The new church was planned in 1818 and designed by R & R Dickson in 1819, based on Cockpen Church which they had overseen the construction of, following the death of its designer, their employer Richard Crichton.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Dickson The church opened in 1821. It contains several fine stained glass windows including \\"The Acts of Charity\\" by Ward and Hughes installed in 1867 and four biblical warriors installed in the 1920s by Mrs Andrew Grant in memory of her four nephews lost in World War I. The church bell was donated by Robert, son of the Countess Dowager of Crawford, in the mid 19th century, but is an 18th-century bell, formerly in Greenwich Hospital. The remains of Old Kilconquhar Church lie in the churchyard. This was originally called Culdee Church and is first mentioned in 1177. In 1200 Duncan, Earl of Fife bestowed revenues from this church to the Cistercian nunnery in North Berwick. The church was consecrated in 1243 by Bishop de Bernham. In 1499 Patrick Dunbar, Laird of Kilconquhar, set up an altar to \\"Our Lady of Pitie (Pity)\\". Other notable buildings The local pub is the Kinneuchar Inn. It dates from the 18th century. Lochside Farm, Allan Cottage and Woodlands all date from the mid 18th century. Notable Residents *James Drummond was minister for 1681 to 1699. *Rev William Milligan was minister of the parish from 1850 to 1860 and his son George Milligan was born here in 1860. *Rear Admiral William Duddingston was born at St Ford on the southern edge of the parish.

A signatory of Israel's declaration of independence, he served continuously as a minister from the country's foundation in 1948 until his death in 1970 apart from a brief spell in the late 1950s. Biography Haim-Moshe Shapira was born to Zalman Shapira and Rosa Krupnik in the Russian Empire in Grodno in what is today Belarus, Shapiro was educated in cheder and a yeshiva, where he organised a youth group called Bnei Zion (lit. Sons of Zion). He worked in the Education and Culture department of the National Jewish Council in Kaunas (now in Lithuania), and in 1919 set up the Young Mizrachi, which became a leading player in the religious Zionist youth movement in Lithuania. In 1922 he started work as a teacher at an ultra-orthodox school in Vilnius, and also served on the board of the Mizrachi group in the city. Between 1923 and 1924 he was active in the Young Mizrachi group in Warsaw, before attending a Rabbinical Seminary in Berlin between 1924 and 1925. In 1925 he was a delegate at the Zionist Congress, where he was elected onto the executive committee. In the same year he immigrated to Mandatory Palestine. In 1928 he was elected onto the Central Committee of the Hapoel HaMizrachi movement, and also served as a member of the World Mizrachi committee. In 1936 he was elected as a member of the Zionist Directorate and a Director of the Aliyah department of the Jewish Agency, a role he filled until 1948. In 1938 he was sent on a special mission to try to save Jews in Austria following the takeover by Nazi Germany. Political career Shapira was one of the people to sign Israel's declaration of independence, and was immediately appointed Minister of Health and Minister of Immigration in David Ben-Gurion's provisional government. In Israel's first elections in 1949, Shapira won a seat as a member of the United Religious Front bloc, an alliance of Agudat Yisrael, Poalei Agudat Yisrael, Mizrachi and his Hapoel HaMizrachi party. He was reappointed to his previous ministerial posts, and also became Minister of Internal Affairs. After the 1951 elections in which Hapoel HaMizrachi ran as an independent party, Shapira was appointed Minister of Internal Affairs and Minister of Religions. Following a cabinet reshuffle in 1952, he lost the Internal Affairs portfolio, but was appointed Minister of Welfare instead. Another reshuffle in 1955 saw him regain the Internal Affairs portfolio. The 1955 elections saw Mizrachi and Hapoel HaMizrachi run as a combined bloc, the National Religious Front, which later became the National Religious Party (NRP). Shapira was reappointed Minister of Religions and Minister of Welfare. In 1957 he was seriously injured by a hand grenade thrown into the Knesset by Moshe Dwek, but survived. He and all other NRP ministers resigned from the cabinet in July 1958, marking the only spell he spent out of office during his time in Israel. Following the 1959 elections, Shapira returned to the cabinet as Minister of Internal Affairs. After the early elections in 1961, he re-added the health portfolio to his roles. After elections in 1965 Shapira became just Internal Affairs Minister, a role he retained again after the 1969 elections. He died in office on 16 July 1970. Positions on the Arab-Israeli conflict Shapira belonged to the dovish camp of religious Zionism. This camp held considerable power before the Six-Day War, but was weakened significantly after the war in favor of hawkish Gush Emunim, whose spiritual leader was Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook. Before the state of Israel was founded, Shapira opposed the dissident military organizations, Irgun and the Stern Gang, although he resigned in response to the attack on the Irgun arms ship Altalena, ordered by David Ben-Gurion. Before the United Nations voted in favor of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, Shapira took a minority position in his movement, supporting the plan. When military actions were debated during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Shapira voiced moderate and careful positions. After the state was founded, he supported giving a hundred thousand Palestinian refugees the option to return to Israel in exchange for a peace accord. Regarding the Deir Yassin and Qibya affairs, he said, \\"It's wrong from a Jewish perspective. Jews should not act like that\\". His opinion differed from others in his party, including Zalman Shragai. Shapira supported retreat from the Sinai Peninsula after the 1956 Suez Crisis. He said: \\"A bit more modesty, a bit less vanity and pride won't be unhelpful to us\\". In this context, he cited the decision of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakai to negotiate with the Romans. Shapira was the most vocal of the ministers opposing a preemptive Israeli attack before the Six Day War. \\"How dare you go to war when all the circumstances are against us\\", he said to the IDF's chief of staff, Yitzhak Rabin. The other National Religious Party ministers joined Shapira in this stance. During the war, he opposed opening a new front in the Golan Heights. Despite his moderate worldview, he acted to include the right wing parties in the government on the eve of the war. This effort resulted in the establishment of a national unity government. After the war, Shapira voiced support for the settlement movement but warned that future peace agreements would be based on territorial concessions. However, he believed that discussions were meaningless as long as the Arabs refused to consider peace with Israel. He was more determined about Jerusalem – \\"The eternal capital should not be taken from the eternal nation\\". When the pupils of Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook expressed indignation at his moderate worldview, he replied, \\"we should not distance ourselves from our few friends in the world\\". He cited the opinion of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, who said that questions of territorial concessions should be decided by those who are experts in the fields of defense and national security. When Moshe Dayan demanded the annexation of the West Bank to Israel, Shapira opposed it. Dayan wondered, \\"How can a religious Jew be so yielding\\". He remarked that Shapira's opinion differed from that of other party members.

The NOOP scheduler is the simplest I/O scheduler for the Linux kernel. This scheduler was developed by Jens Axboe.  Overview  The NOOP scheduler inserts all incoming I/O requests into a simple FIFO queue and implements request merging. This scheduler is useful when it has been determined that the host should not attempt to re-order requests based on the sector numbers contained therein. In other words, the scheduler assumes that the host is unaware of how to productively re-order requests. There are (generally) three basic situations where this situation is desirable: * If I/O scheduling will be handled at a lower layer of the I/O stack. Examples of lower layers that might handle the scheduling include block devices, intelligent RAID controllers, Network Attached Storage, or an externally attached controller such as a storage subsystem accessed through a switched Storage Area Network. Since I/O requests are potentially rescheduled at the lower level, resequencing IOPs at the host level uses host CPU time on operations that will just be undone at the lower level, increasing latency/decreasing throughput for no productive reason. * Because accurate details of sector position are hidden from the host system. An example would be a RAID controller that performs no scheduling on its own. Even though the host has the ability to re- order requests and the RAID controller does not, the host system lacks the visibility to accurately re-order the requests to lower seek time. Since the host has no way of judging whether one sequence is better than another, it cannot restructure the active queue optimally and should, therefore, pass it on to the device that is (theoretically) more aware of such details. * Because read/write head movement doesn't impact application performance enough to justify the reordering overhead. This is usually the case with non-rotational media such as flash drives or solid-state drives (SSDs). However, NOOP is not necessarily the preferred I/O scheduler for the above scenarios. As with any performance tuning, all guidance will be based on observed work load patterns (undermining one's ability to create simplistic rules of thumb). If there is contention for available I/O bandwidth from other applications, it is still possible that other schedulers will generate better performance by virtue of more intelligently carving up that bandwidth for the applications deemed most important. For example, running an LDAP directory server may benefit from deadline's read preference and latency guarantees. At the same time, a user with a desktop system running many different applications may want to have access to CFQ's tunables or its ability to prioritize bandwidth for particular applications over others (ionice). If there is no contention between applications, then there are little to no benefits from selecting a scheduler for the above-listed three scenarios. This is due to a resulting inability to deprioritize one workload's operations in a way that makes additional capacity available to another workload. In other words, if the I/O paths are not saturated and the requests for all the workloads fail to cause an unreasonable shifting around of drive heads (which the operating system is aware of), the benefit of prioritizing one workload may create a situation where CPU time spent scheduling I/O is wasted instead of providing desired benefits. The Linux kernel also exposes the sysfs parameter as a scheduler-agnostic configuration, making it possible for the block layer's requests merging logic to be disabled either entirely, or only for more complex merging attempts. This reduces the need for the NOOP scheduler as the overhead of most I/O schedulers is associated with their attempts to locate adjacent sectors in the request queue in order to merge them. However, most I/O workloads benefit from a certain level of requests merging, even on fast low-latency storage such as SSDs.

It was originally a rural parish with no major settlement, but with the development of Leven as a seaside resort in the late 19th century, the population of the parish grew considerably. According to an 1857 description, \\"The parish is bounded on the north & east by Kilconquhar, on the south by Largo Bay and on the west by Largo. It is from north to south and in breadth. Its area is , all under cultivation except 350 under pasture and 130 under wood. The land surface near the shore is sandy, forming extensive links which are kept in pasture. The land ascends from the shore to the northwards, reaching its greatest height at Gilston. The soil, with the exception of the links, is very fertile. The rent of land averages £2-12-0 per acre. The parish schoolmaster's salary is £30, plus £14 of fees, besides which there is an allowance for teaching a certain number of Poor children, from a fund left by John Wood of Orkie in 1659.

The name MACS is a registered trademark of the company. The method was developed with Miltenyi Biotec's MACS system, which uses superparamagnetic nanoparticles and columns. The superparamagnetic nanoparticles are of the order of 100 nm. They are used to tag the targeted cells in order to capture them inside the column. The column is placed between permanent magnets so that when the magnetic particle-cell complex passes through it, the tagged cells can be captured. The column consists of steel wool which increases the magnetic field gradient to maximize separation efficiency when the column is placed between the permanent magnets. Magnetic- activated cell sorting is a commonly used method in areas like immunology, cancer research, neuroscience, and stem cell research. Miltenyi sells microbeads which are magnetic nanoparticles conjugated to antibodies which can be used to target specific cells. Procedure The MACS method allows cells to be separated by using magnetic nanoparticles coated with antibodies against a particular surface antigen. This causes the cells expressing this antigen to attach to the magnetic nanoparticles. After incubating the beads and cells, the solution is transferred to a column in a strong magnetic field. In this step, the cells attached to the nanoparticles (expressing the antigen) stay on the column, while other cells (not expressing the antigen) flow through. With this method, the cells can be separated positively or negatively with respect to the particular antigen(s). Positive and negative selection With positive selection, the cells expressing the antigen(s) of interest, which attached to the magnetic column, are washed out to a separate vessel, after removing the column from the magnetic field. This method is useful for isolation of a particular cell type, for instance CD4 lymphocytes. With negative selection, the antibody used is against surface antigen(s) which are known to be present on cells that are not of interest. After administration of the cells/magnetic nanoparticles solution onto the column the cells expressing these antigens bind to the column and the fraction that goes through is collected, as it contains almost no cells with these undesired antigens. Modifications Magnetic nanoparticles conjugated to an antibody against an antigen of interest are not always available, but there is a way to circumvent it. Since fluorophore-conjugated antibodies are much more prevalent, it is possible to use magnetic nanoparticles coated with anti-fluorochrome antibodies. They are incubated with the fluorescent-labelled antibodies against the antigen of interest and may thus serve for cell separation with respect to the antigen.

Vernon was a dual international and played for both Ireland teams – the IFA XI and the FAI XI. He also played on two occasions for a Great Britain XI. Club career=Early years Vernon was born in Jocelyn Avenue, Belfast and when he left school he initially entered the family butcher business. He would eventually return to the same trade after retiring as a player. Vernon also played as a junior with both Spearmint and Dundela. His performances attracted the interest of Liverpool but he rejected their approach and opted to sign for Belfast Celtic instead. Belfast Celtic Together with Jimmy McAlinden, Billy McMillan, Tommy Breen and Charlie Tully, he was a prominent member of the Celtic team managed by Elisha Scott. This team dominated the Irish League during the Second World War era. He played his last game for Celtic on 8 February 1947 against Linfield. Both West Bromwich Albion and Glasgow Celtic declared an interest in signing Vernon but the Celtic manager, Jimmy McGrory, would not meet Belfast Celtic's £8,000 valuation. West Bromwich Albion Vernon eventually signed for West Bromwich Albion in February 1947 for a club record fee of £9,500. In 1949 he captained a West Brom team that also included Davy Walsh and Reg Ryan to promotion from the English Second Division. In the same season he also scored his only goal for the club, on Christmas Day in a 1–0 win against Sheffield Wednesday. On 8 June 1947, together with Davy Walsh, Vernon guested for Shamrock Rovers in a friendly against Everton. Crusaders In 1952 Vernon returned to the Irish League and became player-manager at Crusaders, the club that in 1949 had replaced Belfast Celtic in the league. In 1954 he guided the club to victory in the Ulster Cup, their first ever senior trophy. He left the club at the end of that season and returned to the butcher trade.http://www.belfastceltic.org/memory/ International career When Vernon began his international career in 1944 there were in effect, two Ireland teams, chosen by two rival associations. Both associations, the Northern Ireland – based IFA and the Ireland – based FAI claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and selected players from the whole island. As a result, several notable Irish players from this era, including Vernon played for both teams. In addition Vernon also played twice for a Great Britain XI. IFA XI Between 1944 and 1951, Vernon made 21 appearances for the IFA XI. He made his debut in an 8–4 defeat against a Combined Services XI at Windsor Park on 9 September 1944. This team was basically a Great Britain XI and featured, among others, Matt Busby, Stanley Matthews, Tommy Lawton and Stan Mortensen. During the 1945–46 season he also played in the three Victory internationals.Soccer at War – 1939 – 45 (2005): Jack Rollin On 27 November 1946 he helped the IFA XI gain a 0–0 draw with Scotland. The draw helped the IFA XI finish as runners-up in the 1947 British Home Championship. Vernon also helped the IFA XI gain some further respectable results, including a 2–0 win against Scotland on 4 October 1947 and a 2–2 draw with England at Goodison Park on 5 November 1947. On 12 May 1951 he also helped the IFA XI gain a 2–2 draw with France. Vernon played his last game for the IFA XI on 20 November 1951 in a 2–0 defeat to England. FAI XI In 1946 Vernon also made 2 appearances for the FAI XI. He was one of several players born in Northern Ireland who benefited from the FAI's attempts to establish an all-Ireland influence. In June 1946 when the FAI organised an Iberian tour, Vernon, together with Jimmy McAlinden, Billy McMillan and Paddy Sloan, was one of four Northern Irish players called up. Vernon subsequently played in both the 3–1 defeat to Portugal on 16 June and then helped the FAI XI gain a 1–0 victory against Spain on 23 June.The Boys In Green – The FAI International Story (1997): Sean Ryan Ireland (FAI) stats Great Britain XI On 10 May 1947, Vernon, together with Stanley Matthews, Wilf Mannion, Tommy Lawton and Billy Liddell, played for a Great Britain XI against a Europe XI at Hampden Park. The game was arranged to celebrate England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland rejoining FIFA. On 3 December 1951 at Ninian Park he also captained a Great Britain XI against Wales as the Football Association of Wales celebrated their 75th anniversary.

The first prototype version of the software was DOS-based, but since 1996, it has continuously evolved with the Microsoft Windows OS. In November 2008, EarMaster became multi-platform with the release of a version for Mac OS X. The main focus of EarMaster is ear training and sight-singing, even though EarMaster seems to tend towards a more general approach to music teaching since v. 4.0, covering a broader spectrum of music theory and practice. In June 2016, EarMaster was also made available on iOS.  History  The prototype of EarMaster was a DOS-based software programmed in 1994 by Hans Jakobsen. The first proprietary version of EarMaster was EarMaster 1.0, released in 1996 by Miditec. It was distributed by Roland in Scandinavia and available in 5 languages. EarMaster 2.0 was launched in 1997 and was the first version to be commercialized online. In 1998, EarMaster develops the first educational version of its ear training software, EarMaster School 2.5, in collaboration with 29 music teachers. EarMaster Pro 4.0 and EarMaster School 4.0 follow in 2000, with a new interface and more options. EarMaster 5.0 was released in 2005 in both a Pro and a School version, first for Windows and later for Mac OS X. The release of EarMaster 5.0 also marks a name change for the editing company from Miditec to EarMaster ApS. EarMaster 6 was released in 2012, followed by two major updates (6.1 in 2013 and 6.2 in 2015), and a completely new version for iPad in 2016. In 2017, EarMaster 7 was released on Windows and Mac, followed by a version for iPhone in 2020 which was featured in the App Store in the \\"Best of the Month - New Apps we love\\" section. In 2014, EarMaster released an educational Cloud solution for e-learning called EarMaster Cloud. EarMaster Cloud enables music schools, choirs and private teachers to give access to the EarMaster application on Windows, macOS and iOS to students and teachers. The solution includes Learning Management System features and Course Authoring Software, making it possible to create and deploy interactive Musicianship assignments and review the results of the students. EarMaster Cloud was nominated for a Music Teacher Award for Excellence in 2019 and is used by prominent institutions such as Berklee College of Music in the USA.  Content  EarMaster includes several training modes: workshops with progressive sets of lessons about various music theory and ear training topics, a customization mode, and a beginner's course. While the general workshops are rather general and their lessons focus on most of the aspects of ear training, the jazz workshops focuses exclusively on the particularities of Jazz music (e.g. jazz chord, swing rhythms and real book sight-singing). With the customization mode, the user can set up custom exercises for tailored practice. The topics covered by EarMaster are interval singing, interval comparison, interval identification, scale identification, chord identification, chord inversion identification, chord progression identification, rhythm dictation, rhythm reading (sight reading), rhythm clap-back, rhythmic error detection, melodic dictation, melody sing-back and melodic sight-singing. Questions are answered with on-screen interfaces (staff, piano, guitar, bass, violin, cello, banjo and other stringed instruments), a functional keyboard with scale degrees and solfege syllables, multiple-choice buttons, a MIDI instrument, or through a microphone (voice, clapping or acoustic instruments). The user can choose between several note-naming systems to complete the exercises: Anglo-Saxon (A, B, C, etc.), Fixed-Do Solfege, or Relative-Do Solfege, which makes it compatible with the Kodály method. The results of each lesson are recorded and analyzed in a statistics window. They can be synchronized automatically via the EarMaster Cloud system for instant access by music teachers. EarMaster Cloud is a cloud-based system for music schools developed by EarMaster ApS. It combines online license management and cloud syncing of student assignments and results.  Technical Features  EarMaster is distributed electronically as a download. The software is compatible with the Microsoft Windows OS (XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10), Mac OS X 10.10 or superior, and iOS 9 or newer. User can input answers with a MIDI device by playing their answers. The software also includes real-time pitch detection, which enable users to sing or play their answers and obtain an immediate evaluation of their pitch and rhythm accuracy. The sounds played by the software are produced by a SoundFont playback engine and cover the complete set of General Midi (GM) sound presets. Since version 6.1, EarMaster can import music scores with up to 8 voices in the Music XML format in order to use them in its rhythmic and melodic exercises (for SATB sight-singing for example) EarMaster includes an editable library with chords, scales, chord progressions, and over 600 Jazz and Classical music scores to be used in custom exercises and assignments by students and teachers.

The babies and children, most of them resulting from rape at the place of enslavement, were abducted en masse between 1943 and 1945. At some locations, up to 90 percent of infants died a torturous death due to calculated neglect.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p. 400, . Nazi policy Among the Polish and Soviet female forced labour () unintended pregnancies were common due to rampant sexual abuse by their overseers.Cezary Gmyz, Wprost magazine (Number 17/18/2007), pp. 1–3. A staggering 80 percent of rapes resulting in unwanted births occurred on the farms where the Polish girls worked. The SS suspected the victims of \\"cheating their way out of work\\" by conceiving. Notably, the babies born inside concentration camps were not released into the communities. For example, of the 3,000 babies born at Auschwitz, some 2,500 newborns were drowned in a barrel at the maternity ward by the German female overseers. Meanwhile, by the spring of 1942 the arrival of trains with the girls from Poland turned into medieval slave markets in German towns and villages, as in Braunschweig among other locations, where the young women were beaten, starved, and prohibited from speaking to each other. Medical checkup before departure to unknown German slave markets; already pregnant foreigners were not allowed entry into Germany Preoccupied with their new babies, foreign labourers could no longer work for the benefit of the Nazis Abortion in Germany was illegal as far as German women were concerned, thus the law had to be altered. On 11 March 1943, the Reichsführer-SS signed a decree allowing for abortions \\"requested\\" by the young Zivil- und Ostarbeiter. Pregnant slave workers, who were forced to abort by the Germans, had to sign printed requests before surgery and were threatened with prison time and death by starvation. Abortions were enforced after determining whether the probable father was a German or otherwise Germanic in origin.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web pp. 399-400, . Children were either born in, or brought into any one of the estimated 400 Ausländerkind-Pflegestätte homes as \\"parentless\\". When racially valuable, they were removed for Germanisation. In the event a foreign female worker was considered to be of Germanic blood, such as Norwegian, her child was kept alive, but this was rare. The mortality of the Zivil- und Ostarbeiter babies was very high on average, exceeding 50 percent regardless of circumstances. It is estimated that between 1943 and 1945 some 100,000 infants of slave labourers from Poland and the Soviet Union were killed by forced abortion or by calculated neglect after birth in Germany. By other estimates, up to 200,000 children might have died.. A German general and NSDAP government official, Erich Hilgenfeldt, while inspecting some of those locations was troubled by what he saw. He reported that the children were dying in an unnecessarily slow, tortuous process lasting for months, due to inadequate food rations: At the Waltrop- Holthausen birth and abortion camp, 1,273 infants were purposely left to die in the so-called baby-hut and then simply checked off as stillborn. Historians believe that it was Himmler himself who intentionally gave these \\"assembly stations\\", a pompous name of the nursing homes for the non-German children, while all along planning their mass murder known euphemistically as \\"the special treatment\\" (Sonderbehandlung). The immediate reason for the local Gestapo to insist on setting up so many of these institutions was that pregnant German women absolutely refused to enter the facilities where the Ostarbeiter women were taken. According to the last decree of Reichsführer-SS in this matter, signed on 27 July 1943, foreign mothers who were unable to get back to work after giving birth were to be exterminated along with their babies. The killing wards for the Zivil- und Ostarbeiter children, including their intentionally misdiagnosed mothers (usually as being \\"mentally ill\\"), were established at the Bavarian state hospital at Kaufbeuren and its branch at Irsee. They continued to function as euthanasia centres for 33 days after the end of the war until discovery by American troops on 29 May 1945.

(New) Christmas with Boney M. is an aborted second Christmas album turned into a compilation. The album was exclusively released in South Africa where the group's popularity - contrary to the rest of the world - remained high during the early 80s. The album is a sought-after item for Boney M. collectors since it includes the original recording \\"Mother and Child Reunion\\" with Reggie Tsiboe and La Mama which was remixed and overdubbed with additional vocals for a 1985 charity single for Ethiopia, released by Frank Farian Corporation. The album has never been released on CD. After the commercial failure with the Ten Thousand Lightyears album, Frank Farian gathered Liz Mitchell and new member Reggie Tsiboe to record a second Christmas album in the hope of repeating the success of 1981's Christmas Album. Backed by two classically trained singers, the twin sisters Amy & Elaine Goff, Farian recorded six new titles before he changed his plans and had Reggie record \\"Kalimba De Luna\\" - a current hit in Italy - which, when released as a Boney M. title, gave the group a European hit single, quickly followed by another cover of an Italian hit, \\"Happy Song\\". To benefit from the Christmas sales, Farian hastily put together two compilation albums Kalimba de Luna - 16 Happy Songs and a seasonal-themed \\"Christmas With Boney M.\\", mixing the six new Christmas songs with six previously released titles which all had a seasonal or semi-religious flair to them. Hansa chose just to release the \\"Kalimba De Luna\\" compilation on the strength of the two new hit singles, and the second Christmas album never went further than the test pressing stage. Boney M.'s South-African record company, Gallo, however, went for the Christmas release and furthermore added \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" and \\"Mary's Boy Child\\" from the first Christmas Album and replaced \\"Exodus\\" with \\"Children Of Paradise\\". The new Christmas songs were made available to the rest of the world two years later when Hansa released the album The 20 Greatest Christmas Songs.

Limelight has strong associations with new bands, homegrown talent, and indie/rock/metal club nights. History Indie rock band Sons and Daughters performing in 2005 Limelight nightclub and adjoining Dome bar were first opened in 1987 by Patrick Lennon who had previously owned the Harp Bar based in Hill Street, Belfast.

It was first bred in the town of Uccle on the outskirts of Brussels, in central Belgium, in the early years of the twentieth century. It is a true bantam, with no standard-sized large fowl counterpart, and is one of eleven Belgian true bantam breeds.  History  The Barbu d'Uccle was created by Michael Van Gelder of Uccle, Belgium, in the early years of the twentieth century, with help and advice from Robert Pauwels and Louis Vander Snickt. It is thought, but not known for certain, that he cross-bred the existing Sabelpoot and Barbu d'Anvers bantam breeds. The Barbu d'Uccle was first shown in 1905. The first colours were millefleurs and porcelain, but black, white and cuckoo were soon added; by 1909 the breed was well established. The Barbu d'Uccle was first exported to the United Kingdom in 1911. The millefleur variety was added to the Standard of Perfection of the American Poultry Association in 1914. From that time, partly as a consequence of the First and Second World Wars, it gradually declined. A breed society, the Club belge du Barbu d’Uccle, was formed in 1969. In the twenty-first century conservation status of the breed is listed as \\"critical\\"; it is nevertheless the third-most numerous true bantam breed in Belgium.  Characteristics  The Barbu d'Uccle has a low posture, a full beard and a muff; the legs are heavily feathered. It has a single comb, unlike the Barbu d'Anvers, which has a rose comb. In the Netherlands the recommended weight is for cock birds, and about for hens, while the French standard recommends average weights of and respectively. The Poultry Club of Great Britain suggests a weight in the range for males and for females. The American standard specifies an ideal weight of for cocks, for hens and cockerels, and for pullets. Twenty-eight colour varieties are listed for the Barbu d'Uccle in Belgium. Colours listed by the Entente Européenne include blue, blue quail, cuckoo, millefleur, porcelain, lavender, lavender quail, black, black mottled, silver quail, quail, and white. The American Poultry Association lists seven varieties: black (1996), golden neck (1996), millefleur (1914), mottled (1996), porcelain (1965), self blue (1996), and white (1981).

It was expected that a new version of Live.com (later Windows Live Personalized Experience, now defunct) would be released in Fall 2007, featuring a new interface design together with Windows Live service integrations. Microsoft later confirmed that Windows Live Home would not be a replacement for Live.com. Early prototype screenshot of Windows Live Home. Some of the early announced features for Windows Live Home included: *Providing access to emails and contacts through Hotmail *Showing upcoming calendar items from Windows Live Calendar *Allowing blog and photo publishing direct to Windows Live Spaces *Showing the status of Windows Live OneCare installed on the PC The final version of Windows Live Home was released on October 15, 2007. One notable feature of the first release of Windows Live Home was the ability to set the location of the user and display the current weather conditions for the city or region selected. The color of the homepage also automatically changed according to the time of the day. Windows Live Home was updated on December 2, 2008 as part of the overall Windows Live Wave 3 update.

It first appeared in Paris in 1670, anonymously, though the identity of the author came to be known. The original title as published by Claude Barbin was Le comte de Gabalis, ou entretiens sur les sciences secrètes, \\"The Count of Cabala, Or Dialogs on the Secret Sciences\\". The book was widely read in France and abroad, and is a source for many of the \\"marvelous beings\\" that populate later European literature. French readers include Charles Baudelaire and Anatole France – it was the main source for his At the Sign of the Reine Pédauque (1892). In English literature, it influenced Alexander Pope, who borrowed from it to create the sylphs in The Rape of the Lock (1714), and in German, it is a likely source for Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué's Undine. In recent times it has been considered by some to have been intended as a satire of occult philosophy, though in its time it was taken seriously by many readers.

Overview  The main goal of the Deadline scheduler is to guarantee a start service time for a request. It does so by imposing a deadline on all I/O operations to prevent starvation of requests. It also maintains two deadline queues, in addition to the sorted queues (both read and write). Deadline queues are basically sorted by their deadline (the expiration time), while the sorted queues are sorted by the sector number. Before serving the next request, the deadline scheduler decides which queue to use. Read queues are given a higher priority, because processes usually block on read operations. Next, the deadline scheduler checks if the first request in the deadline queue has expired. Otherwise, the scheduler serves a batch of requests from the sorted queue. In both cases, the scheduler also serves a batch of requests following the chosen request in the sorted queue. By default, read requests have an expiration time of 500 ms, write requests expire in 5 seconds. An early version of the scheduler was published by Jens Axboe in January 2002. Measurements have shown that the deadline I/O scheduler outperforms the CFQ I/O scheduler for certain multithreaded workloads.  sysfs tunables = fifo_batch (integer)  Deadline executes I/O Operations (IOPs) through the concept of \\"batches\\" which are sets of operations ordered in terms of increasing sector number. This tunable determines how big a batch will have to be before the requests are queued to the disk (barring expiration of a currently-being-built batch). Smaller batches can reduce latency by ensuring new requests are executed sooner (rather than possibly waiting for more requests to come in), but may degrade overall throughput by increasing the overall movement of drive heads (since sequencing happens within a batch and not between them). Additionally, if the number of IOPs is high enough the batches will be executed in a timely fashion anyway.  read_expire (integer)  The ‘read_expire’ time is the maximum time in milliseconds after which the read is considered ‘expired’. Think of this more like the expiration date on a milk carton. The milk is best used before the expiration date. The same with the deadline scheduler. It will NOT attempt to make sure all IO is issued before its expiration date. However, if the IO is past expiration, then it gets a bump in priority…. with caveats. The read expiration queue is ONLY checked when the deadline scheduler re-evaluates read queue. For reads this means every time a sorted read is dispatched EXCEPT for the case of streaming io. While the scheduler is streaming io from the read queue, the read expired is not evaluated. When re-evaluating the read queue, the logic is check for expired reads (look at head of FIFO [time ordered] queue) check to see if cached read pointer valid (so even if not streaming, the cached pointer still takes precedence so the sorted queue is traversed tip to tail in a sweep) pick up the first read from the sorted queue (start at the tip again for another sweep) If there are expired reads, then the first one is pulled from the FIFO. Note that this expired read then is the new nexus for read sort ordering. The cached next pointer will be set to point to the next io from the sort queue after this expired one…. The thing to note is that the algorithm doesn’t just execute ALL expired io once they are past their expiration date. This allows some reasonable performance to be maintained by batching up ‘write_starved’ sorted reads together before checking the expired read queue again. So, the maximum number of io that can be performed between read expired io is 2 * 'fifo_batch' * 'writes_starved'. One set of ‘fifo_batch’ streaming reads after the first expired read io and if this stream happened to cause the write starved condition, then possibly another ‘fifo_batch’ streaming writes. This is worse case, after which the read expired queue would be re-evaluated. At best, the expired read queue will be evaluated ‘write_starved’ times in a row before being skipped because the write queue would be used.  write_expire (integer)  Identical to read_expire but for write operations (grouped into separate batches from reads).  writes_starved (integer)  As stated previously, deadline prefers reads to writes. As a consequence, this can lead to situations where the operations are executed are almost entirely reads. This becomes more of an important tunable as write_expire is elongated or overall bandwidth approaches saturation. Decreasing this gives more bandwidth to writes (relatively speaking) at the expense of read operations. If application workload, however, is read-heavy (for example most HTTP or directory servers) with only an occasional write, decreased latency of average IOPs may be achieved by increasing this (so that more reads must be performed before a write batch is queued to disk).  front_merges (bool integer)  A \\"front merge\\" is an operation where the I/O Scheduler, seeking to condense (or \\"merge\\") smaller requests into fewer (larger) operations, will take a new operation then examine the active batch and attempt to locate operations where the beginning sector is the same or immediately after another operation's beginning sector. A \\"back merge\\" is the opposite, where ending sectors in the active batch are searched for sectors that are either the same or immediately after the current operation's beginning sectors. Merging diverts operations from the current batch to the active one, decreasing \\"fairness\\" in order to increase throughput. Due to the way files are typically laid out, back merges are much more common than front merges. For some workloads, you may even know that it is a waste of time to spend any time attempting to front merge requests. Setting front_merges to 0 disables this functionality. Front merges may still occur due to the cached last_merge hint, but since that comes at basically zero cost, it is still performed. This boolean simply disables front sector lookup when the I/O scheduler merging function is called. Disk merge totals are recorded per-block device in /proc/diskstats.

It was their first album to feature guitarist Mike Hanus, brother of founding member Stefan Hanus and last to feature founding bass guitarist Markus Amann, and it is the only Fleshcrawl album thus far that does not bear the \\"carved- in-flesh\\" Fleshcrawl logo. This album is different from the preceding Descend into the Absurd in that it is somewhat more melodic and musically organized, thus making it closer to the Swedish subgenre of death metal in relation than their earlier releases, which carry a more generic death metal sound. As is typical of their mid-1990s albums, and of mid-1990s Swedish/Melodic Death metal in general, Impurity is characterized by rapid Bass Drum rolls that alternate with slower, more intense patterns, particularly to counter the mid- to-high tempo guitar riffs. However, the sound of this album is unique among similar bands of the same time in that the drums are toned somewhat higher than usual, resulting in a \\"tinny\\" sound not unlike that of many mid-1990s black metal bands. The major lyrical themes of this album are consistent with their previous releases, and tend to focus on grim, dark subjects, as is common in death metal, such as evil, death, slavery to dark forces (Subordinate), sacrifice (Center Of Hate), and homicide and genocide (Incineration).

The division is heir to the Blue Division which fought during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, in particular during the Battle of Bazeilles and the 9th Colonial Infantry Division, part of the Free French Forces, which distinguished themselves in the apprehending of Elba in June 1944 and the disembarking in Provence on 15 August of the same year. The Division then made way to Indochina, where it was placed dormant (without being dissolved) in December 1947. The unit was reactivated in July 1963 in Brittany under the designation of 9th Brigade. On 1 January 1976, the division was baptized as 9th Marine Infantry Division 9e DIMa. Accordingly, the division was attached to the terrestrial intervention force, then the Rapid Action Force (FAR) since 1983. On 1 July 1999, the unit was restructured in a brigade and was designated as 9th Light Armoured Marine Brigade (BLBMa). On 1 January 2013, the brigade was named to the current designation as the 9th Marine Infantry Brigade (9e BIMa). The headquarter staff is stationed in Poitiers since 1 July 2010. The motto of the brigade is \\"Semper et Ulbique\\", Latin for \\"Always and All over\\". The \\"9th\\" illustrated capability on all exterior theatres of operations where France has been engaged since World War II: Indochina, Lebanon, Kuwait, Macedonia, Kosovo, Bosnia, Congo, Tchad, Ivory Coast. From October 2010 to May 2011, the Brigade armed essentially Brigade La Fayette in Afghanistan by projecting a headquarter staff ( composed 50% of Marines, Bigors, Marine sapeurs of the 9e BIMa) and the tactical interam groupment of Richelieu armed by the 2nd Marine Infantry Regiment 2e RIMa. In January 2013, elements of the Brigade took part in Operation Serval. In all combat engagement theatres around the globe, the 9e BIMa illustrated worth of the oldest traditions of the French Troop de Marine.  Missions  The principal mission of the 9e BIMa, for which the brigade is apt to revolve around: * Amphibious actions: quick projection of a headquarter staff and one reinforced battalion (1,400 men) by naval amphibious marine means, such as Mistral-class amphibious assault ship. * Security missions, securitization of urbain oriented combat designated areas. * Deep decentralization action of search and reconnaissance oriented missions. * Rapid and deep incursions (armored raids, 100 km range) The 9e BIMa is present around the globe and also relieves missions of short duration such as in Senegal, Guyana in Mayotte and Djibouti. The 9eBIMa actively participates to missions with the French Navy as the land terrestrial land component of Amphibious groups. The 9e BIMa is twinned with 3rd Royal Marines Commando Brigade of the Royal Navy. Within this title, from 28 May to 1 June 2012, the center of amphibious operations of the headquarter staff embarked on BPC Mistral with the designated exercise Narval. 10 officers of the headquarter staff of the (twin brigade) participated in light of preparation to exercise Corsican Lion which took place from 17 to 26 October 2012.

The axioms of S5 The following makes use of the modal operators \\\\Box (\\"necessarily\\") and \\\\Diamond (\\"possibly\\"). S5 is characterized by the axioms: *K: \\\\Box(A\\\\to B)\\\\to(\\\\Box A\\\\to\\\\Box B); *T: \\\\Box A \\\\to A, and either: * 5: \\\\Diamond A\\\\to \\\\Box\\\\Diamond A; * or both of the following: :* 4: \\\\Box A\\\\to\\\\Box\\\\Box A, and :* B: A\\\\to\\\\Box\\\\Diamond A. The (5) axiom restricts the accessibility relation R of the Kripke frame to be Euclidean, i.e. (wRv \\\\land wRu) \\\\implies vRu . Kripke semantics In terms of Kripke semantics, S5 is characterized by models where the accessibility relation is an equivalence relation: it is reflexive, transitive, and symmetric. Determining the satisfiability of an S5 formula is an NP-complete problem. The hardness proof is trivial, as S5 includes the propositional logic. Membership is proved by showing that any satisfiable formula has a Kripke model where the number of worlds is at most linear in the size of the formula. Applications S5 is useful because it avoids superfluous iteration of qualifiers of different kinds. For example, under S5, if X is necessarily, possibly, necessarily, possibly true, then X is possibly true. Unbolded qualifiers before the final \\"possibly\\" are pruned in S5. While this is useful for keeping propositions reasonably short, it also might appear counter-intuitive in that, under S5, if something is possibly necessary, then it is necessary. Alvin Plantinga has argued that this feature of S5 is not, in fact, counter-intuitive. To justify, he reasons that if X is possibly necessary, it is necessary in at least one possible world; hence it is necessary in all possible worlds and thus is true in all possible worlds. Such reasoning underpins 'modal' formulations of the ontological argument.

The cathedral is currently used by the Abkhazian Orthodox Church and serves as that body's seat, although this usage is disputed by the Republic of Georgia and is considered irregular by the Eastern Orthodox communion. Pitsunda Cathedral was built at the end of the 10th century by King Bagrat III of Georgia. It served as the seat of the Georgian Orthodox Catholicate of Abkhazia until the late 16th century when Abkhazia came under the Ottoman hegemony.

It is a cross-domed cathedral with three naves and three apses, shaped as a rectangle with extending semicircular apses. The cathedral is notable for its impressive size, reaching 29 m high (including the dome), 37 m long and 25 m wide; the walls are up to 1.5 m thick. The building rests on heavy slabs of grey sandstone; the walls are made up of alternating rows of stone and brickwork, a typical technique for late Byzantine architecture. The cathedral contains vestiges of wall-painting from the 13th and the 16th centuries. A 12th-century Georgian manuscript of the Four Gospels, found at the cathedral in 1830, is now preserved at the Georgian National Center of Manuscripts in Tbilisi.  Gallery  File:Abkhasie.

It is heir to the traditions of the 27th Alpine Division FFI, created in September 1944, renamed the 27th Alpine Infantry Division in December 1944, the 27th Alpine Brigade in December 1962, the 27th Alpine Division in August 1976, and then the 27th division d'infanterie de montagne (27th DIM) in July 1994. With the end of conscription, all of the French Army's divisions were downsized and the 27th became a brigade in 1999.  History  After the liberation of the Combe de Savoie and the Grésivaudan, Colonel Jean Vallette d'Osia became the commander of the 1st Alpine Division of the French Forces of the Interior (1ere Division alpine FFI) in September 1944, which unified the mountain units created in the French Resistance in the northern Alps. The unit, the first FFI division, was formed at the suggestion of Colonel Marcel Descour, the FFI commander in Lyon, and approved by General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny. Vallette d'Osia located his headquarters in Challes-les-Eaux. Charles de Gaulle reformed the 27th Alpine Infantry Division on 17 November 1944 under the command of General Molle. The division, which became operational in January 1945, included the 5th Alpine Demi-Brigade (DBA) under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Le Ray and the 7th Alpine Demi-Brigade under the command of Colonel De Galbert. Its 159th Infantry Regiment was sent to defend Strasbourg in the same month and did not return to the Alps until March. While the 27th was reorganized, the Alpine valleys were held by the 4th Moroccan Mountain Division (4e DMM), which rejoined the 1st Army on 17 November. The 4e DMM left behind its artillery, which was used to reform the 27th's 93rd Mountain Artillery Regiment (93e RAM).  Organisation in 2020  In June 2020, the brigade is now organised as: * Operational Control ** État- Major de Brigade (Brigade Staff), in Varces-Allières-et-Risset, and element at the Grenoble Mountain Troops Hotel ** 27éme Compagnie de Commandement et de Transmissions de Montagne (27th Company of Command and of Communications of Mountain), in Varces-Allières-et-Risset ** 4éme Régiment de Chasseurs à Cheval (4th Regiment of Mounted Chasseurs), in Gap (Light Tank and Light Mechanised) ** 7éme Bataillon de Chasseurs Alpins (7th Battalion of Alpine Chasseurs), in Varces-Allières-et-Risset (Light Mechanised/High Mountain Armoured) ** 13éme Bataillon de Chasseurs Alpins (13th Battalion of Alpine Chasseurs), in Chambéry (Light Mechanised) ** 27éme Bataillon de Chasseurs Alpins (27th Battalion of Alpine Chasseurs), in Annecy (Light Mechanised) ** 93éme Régiment d'Artillerie de Montagne (93rd Mountain Artillery Regiment), in Varces- Allières-et-Risset (Mobile Artillery) ** 2éme Régiment Étranger de Génie (2nd Foreign Legion Engineer Regiment), in Saint-Christol * Administrative Control ** Groupement de Commandos de Montagne (GCM, Group of Commandos of the Mountain), in Modane ** École Militaire de Haute Montagne (High Mountain Military School), in Chamonix Mont Blanc ** Centre de Formation Initiale Militaire — 6éme Bataillon de Chasseurs Alpins, in Gap  External links  * Official page  References = Citations  Bibliography  * Category:Brigades of France Category:Mountain infantry brigades Category:Military units and formations established in 1888 ","title":"27th Mountain Infantry Brigade (France)"},{"id":"12708305","text":"Newnhamia is a genus of ostracods.

Usually, these animals inhabit caves or groundwater. They occur in western Eurasia, in regions that were not covered by the Pleistocene ice sheets. They are found throughout most of Europe with the notable exception of the Nordics and they are also largely missing from Iberia. The genus extends into Asia as far as the Arabian Peninsula and Iran. In their main range - the central Mediterranean region through Central and Eastern Europe to the Ukraine - they are among the most significant organisms inhabiting the groundwater. In the Dinaric Alps alone there are at least 45 species. There are also six species in the British Isles (the northernmost Niphargus): N. aquilex, N. fontanus, N. glenniei and N. kochianus of Great Britain, and N. irlandicus and N. wexfordensis of Ireland. Although the individual species often have very small ranges and only live at a narrow water temperature range, the genus includes both species of cold and relatively warm places, taken to the extreme in N. thermalis from thermal waters. Niphargus are extremely variable in their appearance (more so than even some amphipod families), but are whitish and completely lack eyes. They are fairly small, ranging from about in length in the smallest species to about in the largest. At least some of the species are highly resistant to starvation and able to survive for more than 200 days without food. Species The taxonomy of Niphargus is highly complex. The genus contains the following species: *Niphargus abchasicus Martynov, 1932 *Niphargus aberrans Sket, 1972 *Niphargus ablaskiri Birstein, 1940 *Niphargus abricossovi Birstein, 1932 *Niphargus adbiptus G.

Soon after leaving prison, Fast Eddie has his eye cut out by a loan shark chasing an old debt. Eddie's other eye will only be spared upon repayment. Desperate for cash, Eddie phones Linda, a childhood sweetheart. She lives in SAXON - a ghost-town of grim flats run by a corrupt council. Linda is very wealthy. Her husband Kevin won a million pounds on a TV quiz show. But Kevin has gone missing, feared dead. Eddie offers his services as an amateur sleuth, and so embarks on a comically gruesome journey through the surreal underworld of Saxon: the place where he grew up, the place where his mother works as a prostitute, the place where he murdered a bailiff.

The script garnered rave reviews from Triggerstreet.com, Kevin Spacey’s website for screenwriters, e.g.: “Enjoyed every second. Great dialogue, well-paced, very funny… Eddie's the down-and-out anti-hero we've come to love in British films, beginning with A Clockwork Orange.” Acclaim Saxon won Official Selection in the 61st Edinburgh Film Festival under the artistic direction of Hannah McGill. The film was nominated for the Michael Powell Award for Best New British Feature. Loftin’s earlier short film ‘‘Don Juan’’ appeared at the Santander Film Festival. First-time producer Elise Valmorbida, also a published writer (Matilde Waltzing, The Book of Happy Endings, The TV President), was honoured as a Skillset/EIFF Trailblazer, one of ten film- making talents in the UK to win this accolade. EIFF Artistic Director Hannah McGill wrote of Saxon: “Startling UK thriller brings the grit of 70s Hollywood to a messed-up London estate… Sizzling with tension and vivid, near-surreal imagery, this is a forceful and confident debut.” Saxon went on to further festival success as Official Selection in the British Film Festival in Israel (January 2008) and the European Independent Film Festival (March 2008) where the film won the award for Best European Dramatic Feature. On 21 April 2008, Saxon had its English premiere at The East End International Film Festival, where it was nominated for the award of Best UK Debut Feature. Featured on BBC London, the film screened to a sold-out cinema, with a waiting list for returns. The film was released in the UK 12 January 2009. Micro-budget EIS Saxon was funded entirely by private equity, including the producers’ own mortgage. The film’s financing structure was first announced publicly in ScreenFinance magazine: “Sillwood Films is launching a micro-budget Enterprise Investment Scheme to finance its urban thriller Saxon. Unusually… The EIS will be used to give a tax incentive to individuals who have already put money into the film.” As with many micro-budget productions, Saxon’s cast and crew worked on the basis of part-deferred fees. Other professionals worked for company shares rather than cash. Post-production was delivered by St Anne’s Post (part of the giant Ascent Media Group) under the direction of Patrick Malone.

The Lednice-Valtice Area is registered in the list of monuments protected as World Heritage Sites (WHS) by UNESCO. It is adjacent to the Pálava Landscape Protected Area (Pálava Biosphere Reserve), a WHS registered by UNESCO several years before. The close proximity of two cultural landscapes protected by UNESCO is unique. History The House of Liechtenstein acquired a castle in Lednice in 1249, which marked the beginning of their settlement in the area. It remained the principal Liechtenstein residence for 700 years, until 1939 and World War II. 17th–19th centuries The Dukes of Liechtenstein transformed their properties into one large and designed private park between the 17th and 20th centuries. During the 19th century, the Dukes continued transforming the area as a large traditional English landscape park. The Baroque and Gothic Revival style architecture of their chateaux are married with smaller buildings and a landscape that was fashioned according to the English principles of landscape architecture. In 1715 these two chateaux (castles) were connected by a landscape allée and road, later renamed for the poet Petr Bezruč. The Lednice Ponds are situated between the town of Valtice and villages of Lednice and Hlohovec; as are the Mlýnský, Prostřední, Hlohovecký, and Nesyt Ponds. A substantial part of the cultural landscape complex is covered in pine forests, known as the \\"Pine−wood\\" (Boří les), and in areas adjacent to the Thaya River with riparian forests. 20th century In 1918 the region became part of new Czechoslovakia. The Liechtenstein family opposed the annexation of Czech territory into Sudetenland by Nazi Germany, and as a consequence their properties were confiscated by the Nazis, and the family then relocated to Vaduz in 1939. After World War II the family made several legal attempts for restitution of the properties. Post-war, they had passed into ownership of Czechoslovakia: its Communist regime did not support returning large estates to exiled aristocratic landowners. After the Czechoslovakian Velvet Revolution in 1989, the Liechtenstein descendants again renewed legal attempts for restitution, which were denied by the Czech state, the present day owner of the properties. Features The principal elements are: * Chateau Valtice and its contiguous town of Valtice. * Lednice Castle and its contiguous village of Lednice. * The village of Hlohovec. Pavilions and follies St Hubert Chapel In addition to the castles, there are many large to small residential pavilions located throughout the designed landscape, often serving as chateau or hunting lodges.The term zámeček (, literally a small château) — is usually translated here as a \\"manor house\\" — or a \\"hunting lodge\\" (, ), if it served for hunting. * The Colonnade − Rajsna (German: Reistna) — a Neoclassical colonnade on the top of a hill ridge above Valtice (like a gloriette) from the 1810s to 1820s * Belvedere — a belvedere landscape element. * Rendezvous (or Temple of Diana) — a hunting lodge in a form of a Neoclassical arch from the 1810s * St Hubert Chapel (Kaple svatého Huberta) — a Gothic Revival column structure from the 1850s dedicated to the patron saint of hunters, situated in the Pine wood * Border House (Hraniční zámeček) — a Classicist chateau built in the 1820s directly on the former (until 1920) borderline between Lower Austria and Moravia Temple of the Three Graces * Temple of the Three Graces (Tři Grácie) — a semicircle gallery with allegorical statues of Sciences and Muses and a statue of the Three Graces from the 1820s * Pond House (Rybniční zámeček) — at the shore of one of the Lednice Ponds Nový dvůr * Nový dvůr (German: Neuhof, New Farm) — a Neoclassical farm finished in 1809, originally used for sheep husbandry, nowadays for horse breeding * Apollo Temple (Apollónův chrám) — a Neoclassical hunting lodge from the 1810s, ashore of one of the Lednice Ponds * Hunting Lodge (Lovecký zámeček) — a Neoclassical house from 1806 * John's Castle (Janův hrad or Janohrad) — a Gothic Revival style folly of \\"artificial ruins\\" (, ) in style of a castle, finished in 1810 * Minaret — a Moorish Revival style \\"minaret\\" observation tower high, located in the Lednice Castle garden (finished in 1804), that provides a view of the entire landscape. On clear days the Pálava Hills and Malé Karpaty Mountains can also be seen from the towers. * Obelisk — an obelisk erected in memory of the peace treaty of Campo Formio (1798) Pohansko * Pohansko — an Empire-style hunting lodge finished after 1812, it houses an exhibition of Břeclav Town Museum: close to the lodge there are both an important archaeological site of Great Moravian remains and reconstructed parts of the Czechoslovak border fortifications * Lány — an Empire-style hunting lodge from the beginning of the 19th century  Preservation  The garden follies and the conservatory of Lednice Park were listed in the 1998 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund, for their deteriorating condition resulting from insufficient financial resources.World Monuments Fund – Lednice and Valtice Cultural Landscape The Fund had previously studied the preservation of Lednice and Valtice Castles, and after 1998 it helped fund restoration of the Valtice Rendezvous folly as a demonstration project with support from American Express.Elaine Louie, New York Times, \\"Saving Endangered Art and Architecture,\\" June 25, 1998.

This company was renamed to Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1922. However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company used the name BMW (which in German appears as Rapp Motorenwerke). BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the BMW R 32 in 1923. BMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, which, at the time, built Austin Sevens under licence under the Dixi marque.Odin, L.C. World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG. The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged Dixi called the BMW 3/15. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars. Aircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, against the wishes of its director Franz Josef Popp, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production, with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture stopped altogether. BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the BMW 501 luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper Isetta microcar under licence. Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity. The BMW 700 was successful and assisted in the company's recovery. The 1962 introduction of the BMW New Class compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading manufacturer of sport- oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupe and luxury sedan models. The BMW 5 Series mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the BMW 3 Series compact sedans in 1975, the BMW 6 Series luxury coupes in 1976 and the BMW 7 Series large luxury sedans in 1978. The BMW M division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the BMW M5 in 1984 and the BMW M3 in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan. The company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW large financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only Mini and Rolls Royce. The 1995 BMW Z3 expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 BMW X5 was the company's entry into the SUV market. The first mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, with most engines switching over to turbocharging over the following decade. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 BMW ActiveHybrid 7, and BMW's first electric car was the BMW i3 city car, which was released in 2013. After many years of establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 BMW 2 Series Active Tourer multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).  Aircraft and industrial engines = 1913–1918: World War I  BMW's origins can be traced back to three separate German companies: Rapp Motorenwerke, Bayerische Flugzeugwerke and Automobilwerk Eisenach. The history of the name itself begins with Rapp Motorenwerke, an aircraft engine manufacturer which was established in 1913 by Karl Rapp. A site near the Oberwiesenfeld was chosen because it was close to Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (then called Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik), with whom he had contracts to supply his four-cylinder aircraft engines.Norbye, Jan P., BMW - Bavaria's Driving Machines p. 11 Rapp was also sub-contracted by Austro-Daimler to manufacture their V12 aircraft engines, under the supervision of Franz Josef Popp who was delegated to Munich from Vienna. Popp did not restrict himself to the role of observer, becoming actively involved in the overall management of the company.Norbye, p. 12 In April 1917, following founder Karl Rapp's departure, Rapp Motorenwerke was renamed Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW). BMW's first product was the BMW IIIa aircraft engine. The IIIa engine was known for good fuel economy and high- altitude performance. The resulting orders for IIIa engines from the German military caused rapid expansion for BMW. The large orders received from the Reichswehr for the BMW IIIa engine were overwhelming for the small company, however government officials in the relevant ministries were able to give BMW extensive practical support for the rapid expansionBayerische Motoren Werke GmbH BMW Historical Archives and funding to build a new factory near BMW's existing workshops. The German Empire did not, however, wish to go on supporting BMW with loans and guarantees, and therefore urged the flotation of a public limited company.Kiley, D. Driven:Inside BMW, the Most Admired Car Company in the World The name-change to Bayerische Motoren Werke compelled management to devise a new logo for the company, therefore the famous BMW trademark is designed and patented at this time. However, they remained true to the imagery of the previous Rapp Motorenwerke emblem. Thus, both the old and the new logo were built up in the same way: the company name was placed in a black circle, which was once again given a pictorial form by placing a symbol within it. By analogy with this, the blue and white panels of the Bavarian national flag were placed at the center of the BMW logo. Not until the late 1920s was the logo lent a new interpretation as representing a rotating propeller. BMW's corporate history considers the founding date of Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (7 March 1916) to be the birth of the company.  1918-1923: Post-war aftermath  BFw Helios motorcycle After the end of World War I in 1918, BMW was forced to cease aircraft engine production by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. At the time, Max Wiedmann held about 80 percent of the shares in BMW, the majority of which were obtained from his father-in- law Karl Rapp in 1914. Following Wiedmann's capitulation, BMW AG was registered as a company on 13 August 1918, taking over the manufacturing assets, order book and workforce from BMW GmbH.Munich Commercial Register; Munich public records; 13 August 1918 The shares in BMW AG were owned by the Viennese financier Camillo Castiglioni (33%), the Nuremberg industrialist Fritz Neumeyer (33%), Bayerische Bank (17%) and Norddeutsche Bank (17%). To remain in business, BMW produced farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The BMW M2B15 industrial engine was also used in various motorcycles, including the 1920 Helios model built by Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (which would later merge with BMW). On 20 May 1922, Camillo Castiglioni purchased the rights to the name BMW for 75 million reichsmarks. The purchase did not include BMW's facilities, therefore to the company descended from Rapp Motorenwerke continued production under the name Süddeutsche Bremse AG (known today as Knorr-Bremse). Castiglioni was also an investor in another aircraft company, called \\"Bayerische Flugzeugwerke\\", which he renamed BMW. The disused factory of Bayerische Flugzeugwerke on Lerchenauer Straße was re-opened to produce engines for buses, trucks, farm equipment and pumps, under the brand name BMW. BMW's headquarters have been at that location ever since.Norbye, p. 13BMW Munich Plant - Location - History - 1922  1939–1945: World War II  BMW 801 radial engine BMW 003 jet engine With German rearmament in the 1930s, the company again began producing aircraft engines for the Luftwaffe. In 1939, BMW bought Brandenburgische Motorenwerke, also known as Bramo, from the Siemens group of companies and merged it with its aircraft engine division under the name BMW Flugmotorenbau GmbH. A new factory at Allach, outside Munich, began production of aircraft engines later that year.Norbye, p. 72 Over 30,000 aero engines were manufactured through 1945, as well as over 500 jet engines such as the BMW 003. To enable this massive production effort, forced labor was utilized, consisting primarily of prisoners from concentration camps such as Dachau.The Dachau Concentration Camp, 1933 to 1945, p.171 By the end of the war, almost 50% of the 50,000-person workforce at BMW AG consisted of prisoners from concentration camps. Among its successful World War II engine designs were the BMW 132 and BMW 801 air-cooled radial engines, and the pioneering BMW 003 axial-flow turbojet. Towards the end of the Third Reich, BMW developed some military aircraft projects for the Luftwaffe— the Strahlbomber, Schnellbomber and Strahljäger— but none of them reached production.  Motorcycles  BMW R24 BMW's motorcycle history began in 1921 when the company commenced manufacturing engines for other companies. BMW's own motorcycles— sold under the BMW Motorrad brand— began in 1923 with the BMW R 32, which was powered by a flat-twin engine (also called a \\"boxer- twin\\" engine). Production of motorcycles with flat-twin engines continues to this day, however BMW has also produced many models with other types of engine.  Automobiles = 1923–1939: Start of production  BMW's production of automobiles began in 1928, when the company purchased the Automobilwerk Eisenach car company from Gothaer Waggonfabrik. Eisenach's current model was the Dixi 3/15, a licensed copy of the Austin 7 which had begun production in 1927. Following the takeover, the Dixi 3/15 became the BMW 3/15, BMW's first production car.Norbye, p.24 Towards the end of 1930, BMW attempted to introduce a new front axle with independent wheel suspension for both their models, the BMW 'Dixi' 3/15 DA4 and BMW 'Wartburg' DA3, but this resulted in accidents with the prototypes because of construction faults.Article ‘Die Schwingachse des Kleinen,’ Motor-Kritik magazine, issue 3, early February 1931. In 1932, the BMW 3/20 became the first BMW automobile designed entirely by BMW. It was powered by a four-cylinder engine, which BMW designed based on the Austin 7 engine. BMW's first automotive straight-six engine was released in 1933,Norbye, pp. 33-36 in the BMW 303, which was larger and more conventional than its 3/20 predecessor.Norbye, p. 33Noakes, Andrew, The Ultimate History of BMW, pp. 24-25 The 303 was also the first BMW to use the \\"kidney grille\\" that would become a characteristic of BMW styling.Norbye, p. 36 The 303 formed the basis for the four-cylinder 309 and the larger- engined 315 and 319,Norbye, pp. 38-40, 43-44Noakes, p. 26 while the 315/1 and 319/1 roadsters were built using the chassis of the 303.Noakes, pp. 27-28 and the restyled 329.Norbye, p. 47 The 303 platform was supplemented in 1936 by the BMW 326, a larger luxury car with a more rigid frame. The 326 was BMW's first four-door sedan.Norbye, pp. 45-46Noakes, p. 28 A shortened version of the 326 chassis was used in the BMW 320 (which replaced the 329), the BMW 321 (which replaced the 320) and in the BMW 327 coupé.Norbye, pp. 47, 68-70Noakes, pp. 36-37 Also in 1936, the BMW 328 sports car replaced the 315/1 and 319/1. Unlike its predecessors, the 328 had a purpose-built chassis and a unique engine (the BMW M328) which produced .Norbye, pp. 65-66 From its introduction at the Eifelrennen race at the Nürburgring in 1936, where Ernst Henne drove it to win the 2.0 litre class,Noakes, p. 31 to the overall victory of Fritz Huschke von Hanstein at the 1940 Brescia Grand Prix during World War II.Norbye, p. 68Noakes, p. 35 The 328 was highly successful in motor racing, with more than 100 class wins in 1937 alone.Norbye, p. 66 The BMW 335 luxury car was produced from 1939 to 1941.Norbye, p. 250 It was built using an extended version of the 326 chassis with the larger BMW M335 straight-six engine.Norbye, p. 69 File:BMW Dixi 1930.JPG BMW 3/15PS (1928-1931) File:MHV_BMW_303_1934_01.jpg BMW 303 (1932-1934) File:MHV_BMW_335_1939_01.jpg BMW 335 (1939-1941)  1945–1951: Post-war rebuilding  In East Germany, the BMW factories at Eisenach-Dürrerhof, Wandlitz-Basdorf and Zühlsdorf) were seized by the Soviet Union. The factory at Eisenach was taken over by the Soviet Awtowelo Company.Noakes, p.42 and resumed production of the BMW 321 in 1945, just after motorcycle production also resumed. A mildly revised BMW 327 entered production in 1948, followed by the BMW 340 in 1949. These were sold under the BMW name with the BMW logo affixed to them.Norbye, p. 75 To protect its trademarks, BMW AG legally severed its Eisenach branch from the company. The Soviet Awtowelo Company continued production of the 327 and 340 under the Eisenacher Motorenwerk (EMW) brand with a red and white version of the logo until 1955. In West Germany, many of the BMW factories had been heavily bombed during the war. By the end of the war, the Munich plant was completely destroyed. BMW was banned by the Allies from producing motorcycles or automobiles. During this ban, BMW used basic secondhand and salvaged equipment to make pots and pans, later expanding to other kitchen supplies and bicycles. In 1948, BMW was still barred from producing automobiles, however, the Bristol Aeroplane Company (BAC) inspected the factory, and returned to Britain with plans for the 327 model and the six-cylinder engine as official war reparations. Bristol then employed BMW engineer Fritz Fiedler to lead their engine development team. In 1947, the newly formed Bristol Cars released their 400 coupé, a lengthened version of the BMW 327. that featured BMW's double- kidney grille.Norbye, p. 80 By the end of the 1940s BMW had returned to motorcycle manufacture but still had not restarted automobile manufacture.Norbye, p.85 There were several approaches considered regarding how to re-enter the automotive market. Kurt Donath, technical director of BMW and general manager of the Milbertshofen factory,Norbye, p.76 advocated to produce another manufacturer's old models under licence, also purchasing the tooling to produce the cars from the other manufacturer.Norbye, p.86 Chief engineer Alfred Böning's preferred approach was a small economy car, and he developed the BMW 331 prototype, powered by a motorcycle engine. In the end, it was sales director Hanns Grewenig's proposal that was successful. Grewenig believed that BMW's small production capacity was best suited to luxury cars with high profit margins, similar to the cars BMW made just before the war. To this end, he had Böning and his team design the BMW 501 luxury sedan.Norbye, p.87 The 501 was unveiled in 1951, however delays in receiving and setting up equipment caused production of the 501 to be delayed until late 1952.Norbye, pp. 89-90  1952–1958: Production resumes in Munich  There were several other shortcomings with the 501 luxury sedan. The cost was approximately DM15,000— about four times the average German's earnings.Noakes, p. 46 It was also much heavier than expected, so the six-cylinder engine (based on a pre- war design) struggled to provide adequete performance.Norbye, p. 88 Construction of the 501 bodies was originally expected to be done in-house, however BMW ended up using bodies built by Karosserie Baur in Stuttgart for more than a year. In 1954, the 501 model range received some much-needed changes, which resulted in a doubling of sales. The 501 became the 501A and received a price reduction of DM1,000. An entry-level 501B model was introduced, priced at DM1,000 below the 501A.Noakes, p. 48Norbye, p. 92 Both models received an upgraded version of the six-cylinder engine. A new BMW 502 flagship model was introduced, with a higher trim level and the new BMW OHV V8 engine,Norbye, p. 91Norbye, p. 90 BMW's first V8 engine. At the same time, BMW sought to offer a more affordable car. Motorcycles were BMW's largest money earner at the time, and their sales had peaked in 1954. Germans were turning away from mopeds and motorcycles toward light automobiles such as the Messerschmitt KR175 and the Goggomobil. After seeing the Iso Isetta bubble car at the 1954 Geneva Motor Show,Norbye, pp. 119-120Lewin, pp. 31-32 BMW entered talks with Iso Rivolta and bought both a licence to manufacture the Isetta and all the tooling needed to manufacture its body.Norbye, p. 121 Production of BMW's version of the Isetta began in 1955; more than ten thousand Isettas were sold that year. BMW made more than a hundred thousand Isettas by the end of 1958,Lewin, p. 33 and a total of 161,728 by the end of production in 1962.Norbye, p. 122 The Isetta chassis was lengthened to create the BMW 600, since BMW knew that it needed a larger four-seat family car to keep up with the rising wealth and expectations of the German people, but could not afford to develop a new model from scratch. The rear-mounted engine was increased in size from and the 600's rear suspension was BMW's first use of the semi- trailing arm system that would be used on their sedans and coupes until the 1990s. Released in 1957, the 600 could not compete against the larger, more powerful Volkswagen Beetle. Production ended in 1959 after fewer than 35,000 were built.Norbye, pp. 122-123Lewin, p. 34 Influenced by the public response to the introduction of the Mercedes-Benz 300SL and Mercedes-Benz 190SL in 1954, BMW began development of a sports car based on the platform of the BMW 502 luxury sedan.Norbye, pp. 95-96 The styling was contracted out to industrial designer Albrecht von Goertz, who designed a two-seat roadster and a four-seat grand tourer versions.Norbye, pp. 113-114 The BMW 507 roadster was introduced at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York in early 1955,Seeliger, Georg, BMW 503/507: Die V8-Sportmodelle, p. 83BMW 507 and 503 (1955-1960), Car Body Design, 21 November 2006 while the BMW 503 four-seater was introduced a few months later. However, high prices would be the downfall of both models. Max Hoffman, the BMW importer for the United States, told BMW that he would order 2000 507s if he could sell them for each. When the selling price was given as about twice that, and higher than the 300SL, he withdrew his offer.Norbye, p. 115Noakes, pp. 50-52 412 units of the 503 and 253 of the 507 were built during their production runs from 1956 (May for the 503, November for the 507) to March 1959.Norbye, p. 251Lewin, Tony, The Complete Book of BMW: Every Model in the World Since 1962, p. 29  1959–1968: Near bankruptcy and New Class  By 1959, BMW was in debt and losing money.Norbye, p. 134 The Isetta was selling well but with small profit margins.Noakes, p. 57 Their 501-based luxury sedans were not selling well enough to be profitable and were becoming increasingly outdated.Norbye, p. 130 Their 503 coupé and 507 roadster were too expensive to be profitable. The BMW 600, a four-seater based on the Isetta, was selling poorly.Noakes, pp. 56–57 The motorcycle market imploded in the mid-1950s with increasing affluence turning Germans away from motorcycles and toward cars.Norbye, pp. 119–120 BMW had sold their Allach plant to MAN in 1954.Norbye, p. 119 American Motors and the Rootes Group had both tried to acquire BMW.Norbye, p. 132 At BMW's annual general meeting on 9 December 1959, Dr. Hans Feith, chairman of BMW's supervisory board, proposed a merger with Daimler-Benz. The dealers and small shareholders opposed this suggestion and rallied around a counter-proposal by Dr. Friedrich Mathern, which gained enough support to stop the merger. At that time, the Quandt Group, led by half-brothers Herbert and Harald Quandt, had recently increased their holdings in BMW and had become their largest shareholder. By the end of November 1960, the Quandts owned two-thirds of BMW's stock between them. By this time, BMW had launched the BMW 700, a small car with a rear-mounted engine (based on the BMW R67 motorbike engine). The 700 was available as a 2-door sedan, a coupe and a \\"RS\\" model for racing.Norbye, p. 124Melissen, Pieter; Ultimatecarpage.com: BMW 700 RS In 1960, the development program began for a new range of models, called the \\"Neue Klasse\\" (New Class) project.Norbye, pp. 140-141 The resulting BMW New Class four-door sedans, introduced in 1962, are credited for saving the company financially and establishing BMW's identity as a producer of sports sedans. The New Class had front disc brakes and four- wheel independent suspension,Norbye, pp. 136-137 which helped establish BMW's reputation for sporting cars. It was the first BMW to officially feature the \\"Hofmeister kink\\", the rear window line that has been a styling feature of most BMWs since. By 1963, with the company back on its feet, BMW offered dividends to its shareholders for the first time since World War II.Norbye, p. 63 In 1965, the New Class range was expanded with the New Class Coupés luxury models. The following year, the two-door version of the 1600 was launched, along with a convertible in 1967. These models began the BMW 02 Series, of which the 2002 sports sedan model was the best known.Norbye, pp. 161-162 BMW acquired the Hans Glas company based in Dingolfing, Germany, in 1966. Glas vehicles were briefly badged as BMW until the company was fully absorbed. It was reputed that the acquisition was mainly to gain access to Glas’ development of the timing belt with an overhead camshaft in automotive applications,Toronto Star 3 July 2004 although some saw Glas’ Dingolfing plant as another incentive. However, this factory was outmoded and BMW's biggest immediate gain was, according to themselves, a stock of highly qualified engineers and other personnel. The Glas factories continued to build a limited number of their existing models, while adding the manufacture of BMW front and rear axles until they could be closer incorporated into BMW.Becker, p. 74  1968–1978: New Six, 3 Series, 5 Series, 7 Series  E9 3.0 CSL In 1968, production of the BMW M30 engine began, BMW's first straight-six engine since World War II which would remain in production for 24 years. This engine coincided with the launch of the New Six large sedans (the predecessor to the 7 Series) and New Six CS large coupes (the predecessor to the 6 Series). The first generation of the BMW 5 Series mid-size sedans were introduced in 1972, to replace the New Class sedans. The 5 Series platform was also used for the BMW 6 Series coupes, which were introduced in 1976. In 1975, the first generation of the BMW 3 Series range of compact sedans/coupes was introduced as the replacement for the 02 Series. The first generation of the BMW 7 Series large sedans were introduced in 1978.  1978–1989: M division  E30 M3 The 1978 BMW M1 was BMW's first mid-engined sports car and was developed in conjunction with Lamborghini. It was also the first road car produced by BMW's motorsport division, BMW M. In 1980, the M division produced its first model based on a regular production vehicle, the E12 5 Series M535i. The M535i is the predecessor to the BMW M5, which was introduced in 1985 based on the E28 5 Series platform. In 1983, BMW introduced its first diesel engine, the BMW M21. The first all-wheel drive BMW was the E30 3 Series 325iX model, which began production in 1985. The E30 became BMW's first model produced in a station wagon (estate) body style, when the \\"Touring\\" model was introduced in 1987. The 1986 E32 7 Series 750i model was BMW's first car to use a V12 engine. The E32 was also the first sedan to be available with a long-wheelbase body style (badged \\"iL\\" or \\"Li\\"). The BMW M3 was introduced in 1985, as part of the E30 3 Series model range.  1989–1994: 8 Series, hatchbacks  E31 8 Series The 8 Series range of large coupes was introduced in 1989 and in 1992 was the first application of BMW's first V8 engine in 25 years, the BMW M60. It was also the first BMW to use a multi-link rear suspension, a design which was implemented for mass-production in 1990 E36 3 Series. The E34 5 Series, introduced in 1988, was the first 5 Series to be produced with all-wheel drive or a wagon body style. In 1989, the limited-production BMW Z1 began BMW's line of two- seat convertible Z Series models. In 1993, the BMW 3 Series Compact (built on the E36 3 Series platform) was BMW's first hatchback model (except for the limited production 02 Series \\"Touring\\" models). These hatchback models formed a new entry-level model range below the other 3 Series models. In 1992, BMW acquired a large stake in California-based industrial design studio DesignworksUSA, which they fully acquired in 1995. The 1993 McLaren F1 is powered by a BMW V12 engine.  1994–1999: Rover ownership, Z3  In 1994, BMW bought the British Rover Group (which at the time consisted of the Rover, Land Rover, Mini and MG brands as well as the rights to defunct Austin and Morris brands), and owned it for six years. The purchase of Rover was not successful. Already struggling after years of industrial disputes, Rover had a poor reputation but in trying to improve its image it would become a rival to the BMW market segment. BMW found it difficult to reposition the English automaker alongside its own products and the Rover division was faced with endless changes in its marketing strategy. In the six years under BMW, Rover was positioned as a premium automaker, a mass-market automaker, a division of BMW and an independent unit. The 1996 documentary, When Rover Met BMW gave some insight into the difficulties faced by the two companies. By 2000, Rover was incurring huge losses and BMW decided to sell off several of the brands. The MG and Rover brands were sold to the Phoenix Consortium to form MG Rover, while Land Rover was taken over by Ford. BMW, meanwhile, retained the rights to Mini (which was launched in 2001) and Rolls-Royce Phantom (which was launched in 2003). Back in Germany, the 1995 E38 7 Series 725tds was the first 7 Series to use a diesel engine. The E39 5 Series was also introduced in 1995 and was the first 5 Series to use rack-and-pinion steering and a significant number of suspension parts made from lightweight aluminum. The Z3 two-seat convertible and coupe models were introduced in 1995. These were the first mass-produced models outside of the 1/3/5 Series and the first model to be solely manufactured outside Germany (in the United States, in this case). In 1998, the E46 3 Series was introduced, with the M3 model featuring BMW's most powerful naturally aspirated engine to date.  1999–2006: SUV models, Rolls- Royce  BMW's first SUV, the X5, was introduced in 1999. The X5 was a large departure from BMW's image of sporting \\"driver’s cars\\", however, it was very successful and resulted in other SUVs being introduced, such as the smaller X3 in 2003. The 2001 E65 7 Series was BMW's first model to use a 6-speed automatic transmission and the iDrive infotainment system. The E65 also attracted controversy for its exterior styling. In 2002, the Z4 two-seat coupe/convertible replaced the Z3. In 2004, the 1 Series hatchbacks replaced the 3 Series Compact models as BMW's entry-level models. 2003 Rolls-Royce Phantom was the first Rolls-Royce vehicle produced under BMW ownership. This was the end result of complicated contractual negotiations that began in 1998 when Rolls-Royce plc licensed use of the Rolls-Royce name and logo to BMW, but Vickers sold the remaining elements of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars to Volkswagen. In addition, BMW had supplied Rolls-Royce with engines since 1998 for use in the Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph. In 2005, BMW's first V10 engine was introduced in the M5 model of the E60 5 Series range. The E60 platform was also used for the E63/E64 6 Series, which reintroduced the 6 Series models after a hiatus of 14 years.  2006–2013: Shift to turbocharged engines  F01 7 Series (2008-2016) ActiveHybrid 7 model BMW's first mass-production turbocharged petrol engine was the six-cylinder BMW N54, which debuted in the 2006 E92 3 Series 335i model. In 2011, the F30 3 Series was released, with turbocharged engines being used on all models. This shift to turbocharging and smaller engines was reflective of general automotive industry trends. The M3 model based on the F30 platform is the first M3 to use a turbocharged engine. BMW's first turbocharged V8 engine, the BMW N63, was introduced in 2008. Despite the trend to downsizing, in 2008 BMW began production of its first turbocharged V12 engine, the BMW N74. In 2011, the F10 5 Series was the first time an M5 model used a turbocharged engine. The BMW X6 SUV was introduced in 2008. The X6 attracted controversy for its unusual combination of coupe and SUV styling cues. In 2009, the BMW X1 compact SUV was introduced. The BMW 5 Series Gran Turismo fastback body style was also introduced in 2009, based on the 5 Series platform. BMW's first hybrid-powered car, the F01 7 Series ActiveHybrid 7 model, was introduced in 2010.  2013–present: Electric/hybrid/fuel-cell power  i8 (2014-present) BMW released their first electric car, the BMW i3 city car, in 2013. The i3 is also the first mass-production car to have a structure mostly made from carbon-fiber. BMW's first hybrid sportscar (and their first mid-engined car since the M1) is called the BMW i8 and was introduced in 2014. The i8 is also the first car to use BMW's first inline- three engine, the BMW B38. In 2013, the BMW 4 Series replaced the coupe and convertible models of the 3 Series. Many elements of the 4 Series remained shared with the equivalent 3 Series model. Similarly, the BMW 2 Series replaced the coupe and convertible models of the 1 Series in 2013. The 2 Series was produced in coupe (F22), five-seat MPV (F45) and seven-seat MPV (F46) body styles. The latter two body styles are the first front-wheel drive vehicles produced by BMW. The F48 X1 also includes some front-wheel-drive models. The BMW X4 compact SUV was introduced in 2014. The 2016 G11 7 Series 740e and F30 3 Series 330e models are the first plug-in hybrid versions of the 7 Series and 3 Series respectively.

It was written by Ellis-Bextor and Dimitri Tikovoi, while production was handled by Tikovi, with additional production by Brio Taliaferro and Jeremy Wheatley. It is a dance- pop, electropop and disco song and a reference to the famous misquotation of Emma Goldman, \\"If I can't dance, I don't want to be part of your revolution\\", which nevertheless summarizes what she did say.Shulman, Alix Kates. \\"Dances with Feminists\\". Women's Review of Books, Vol. IX, #3. December 1991. Available at the Emma Goldman Papers. Retrieved on December 13, 2007. The song was scheduled to be released as the fourth single from the album, which was confirmed by the singer herself; however, a full release did not eventuate. The song was also included on the soundtrack to the 2007 film St Trinian's and received mostly positive reviews from music critics, with many calling it a \\"delightfully self-aware cut which transport us to a world where the glitter ball never stops spinning.\\" Background and release In an interview with Digital Spy in August 2007, Ellis-Bextor announced that \\"If I Can't Dance\\" was to be released as the fourth single from her album Trip the Light Fantastic in November 2007. She performed the song live for the first time in July 2007 on the BBC1 Saturday night game show, DanceX. Around this time, Sophie announced that she was unsure if she wished to release \\"If I Can't Dance\\", due to the popularity of \\"Love Is Here\\" amongst fans, and that after her performance on DanceX, fans had urged her to release \\"Love Is Here\\" instead. She then announced plans for releasing \\"If I Can't Dance\\" would stay, and that \\"Love Is Here\\" would become the fifth single instead. On 9 October 2007, Ellis-Bextor announced that plans to release \\"If I Can't Dance\\" and \\"Love Is Here\\" had been cancelled, and that her record label would release a new, unreleased song in their place. However, when the song was featured on the St Trinian's soundtrack, which was released on 10 December 2007, rumours spurred that the single would, in fact, be released. In January 2008, Ellis-Bextor made a shock announcement that the Trip the Light Fantastic era was concluded, and soon after, plans for a Greatest Hits compilation expected for release in Autumn 2008 came to light. Rumours regarding the single's release again became rife when the track was confirmed for inclusion on the compilation, but Ellis- Bextor confirmed in February 2008 the track would not be released as a single. Regardless, on 5 May 2008, a single release of \\"If I Can't Dance\\" surprisingly appeared on the iTunes Store without any prior announcement or confirmation, complete with new artwork and backed with the B-side \\"Can't Have It All\\". Days later, the single was removed from the store, and since, fans have wondered if the single was listed by Fascination, due to its removal just days later. This also meant the single failed to chart anywhere. Composition \\"If I Can't Dance\\" was written by Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Dimitri Tikovoi, while production was handled by Tikovi, with additional production by Brio Taliaferro and Jeremy Wheatley. It draws from the dance-pop, electropop and disco genres. The song is a reference to the famous quote from Emma Goldman, \\"If I can't dance, I don't want to be part of your revolution\\". Goldman never said these exact words but she did convey this idea in an encounter with a young revolutionary that she mentions in her autobiography Living My Life. Lyrically, it finds Sophie tartly telling her stiff limbed lover, \\"Oh darling, don't be so unkind / The beat must never be denied\\". Critical reception The song received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Emily Mackay of Yahoo! Music wrote that \\"'If I Can't Dance', with its jerky, Girls Aloud-esque rhythmm, is sure-footed sparkler.\\" Kitty Empire of The Observer called it \\"another delightfully self-aware cut which features our ice maiden twitching a buttock to some bloopy percolations\\", while Talia Kraines of BBC Music wrote that the song \\"transport[s] us to a world where the glitter ball never stops spinning.\\" K. Ross Hoffman of Allmusic noted that it is a \\"Xenomania-esque stomp.\\" Nick Levine of Digital Spy commented, \\"When she declares, halfway through the album, 'If I can't dance, I don't want any part of your revolution', you can't help but wonder, just for a moment, how on earth those pesky Frenchies of 1786 [sic]The correct year was 1789. managed to storm the Bastille without Trip the Light Fantastic as a soundtrack.\\" Track listing # \\"If I Can't Dance\\" – 3:26 # \\"Can't Have It All\\" – 4:11 Credits and personnel *Songwriting – Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Dimitri Tikovoi *Production – Dimitri Tikovoi *Additional production by Brio Taliaferro, Jeremy Wheatley *All instruments by Dimitri Tikovoi Credits adapted from the liner notes of Trip the Light Fantastic, Fascination Records.

Since then he has produced several Painting Robots and the Robotarium, a zoo for robots. RAP (Robotic Action Painter) (2006) is a robot that makes drawings based on emergence and stigmergy, decides when the work is ready, and signs it, is displayed as a permanent installation at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.Leonel Moura and Henrique Garica Pereira, \\"Man and Robots: Symbiotic Art\\".

Robots ArtSbot (Art Swarm Robots), 2003, comprise several small autonomous robots, called Mbots, each equipped with color detection sensors, obstacle avoidance sensors, a microcontroller and actuators, for locomotion and pen manipulation. Mbots have two distinct behaviors: the random behavior that initializes the process by activating a pen, based on a small probability (usually 2/256), whenever the color sensors read white; and the positive feed-back behavior that reinforces the color detected by the sensors, activating the corresponding pen (since there are two pens, the color circle is split into two ranges - 'warm' and 'cold'). With this process the collective set of robots generate compositions where from a random background some color clusters emerge. RAP (Robotic Action Painter), 2006, work alone but based on the same principles of emergence and stigmergy. Some improvements however produce rather distinct compositions from those of the ArtSbot swarm. Some of the new skills are: to determine the length and shape of each trace, the capacity to decide, in a non-linear mode, the moment to stop and the ability to sign. Additionally RAP works with six color pens and the RGB sensors are disposed in a grid of 3x3 which permits to detect local patterns and not only colors. ISU, 2006, is very similar to RAP but is able to write letters and build words. In this fashion it makes compositions that resemble some of the Lettrist works from the 1950s and automatism. Robotarium X is a large-scale steel glass construction lodging forty-five different robots, most powered by photovoltaic energy and fully autonomous. RUR, the birth of the robot In 2010 Leonel Moura creates a new version of the theatre play RUR with robots. R.U.R., Rossum’s Universal Robots is a classic playwright written by Karel Capek in the 1920s in which the word ROBOT was coined. Men and robots clash resulting in the extermination of mankind and the emergence of robots as a new dominant species. The play was always staged with human actor’s transvestite as robots. Moura’s new version displays, for the first time, real robots interacting on stage with human actors. RUR, the birth of the robot, debuted in August 2010 at the Itáu Cultural, São Paulo, Brazil.

A compensating differential, which is also called a compensating wage differential or an equalizing difference, is defined as the additional amount of income that a given worker must be offered in order to motivate them to accept a given undesirable job, relative to other jobs that worker could perform. One can also speak of the compensating differential for an especially desirable job, or one that provides special benefits, but in this case the differential would be negative: that is, a given worker would be willing to accept a lower wage for an especially desirable job, relative to other jobs. The idea of compensating differentials has been used to analyze issues such as the risk of future unemployment, the risk of injury, the risk of unsafe intercourse, the monetary value workers place on their own lives, and in explaining geographical wage differentials.  Geographical Wage Differentials There is a wide literature dealing with geographical wage differentials. Following the neoclassical assumption of clearing labour markets, where there is a more attractive area to live in and if labour mobility is perfect, then more and more workers will move to this area which in turn will increase the supply of labour in this area and in turn depress wages. If the attractiveness of that area compared to other areas do not change, the wage rate will be set at such a rate that workers would be indifferent between living in areas that are more attractive but with a lower wage and living in areas which are less attractive and with a higher wage. Henceforth, a sustained equilibrium with different wage rates across different areas can happen. The theory The theory of compensating wage differentials provides a theoretical framework to explain why the ‘underlying’ structure of pay differs between geographical areas. Competition in labour markets ensures that the net advantages of different jobs will tend to equality. Thus, higher pay in some areas of the country is expected where the cost-of-living is higher while higher pay is also necessary to compensate for a less pleasant working environment. The rate of pay in the private sector represents (according to the hypothesis) the exact rate necessary to attract and retain staff. Thus all else equal a higher rate of pay in one area means that this area is less attractive (either has low amenity levels or higher cost-of-living). The pay offered in this area is set to counter the relative unattractiveness of the region. Some empirical studies have tried to test this assumption. Most of this research is interested in inter geographical wage disparities. The research ask the question: how can geographical wage differentials be explained? Empirical results Most of the empirical results from the literature attempt to decompose the geographical wage differentials according to human capital characteristics. Areas with more skilled workers will tend to have higher mean wages. Though, average wages may differ among different areas because they offer different levels of amenities. It is usually believed in economics that wages in areas where the level of amenity is high comparatively to other areas will be lower. Empirical research has attempted to measure area characteristics in order to measure this effect on average wages. Though, some characteristics may be attractive for some workers but because workers may have different utilities, other workers may not be attracted by these characteristics. The following assumption is usually made: workers among a similar occupation will share similar utility function, then it is possible to measure the characteristics of areas on the mean wage of a particular occupation. = Human capital = Some articles have brought evidence that wages differ across areas in different countries using a decomposition analysis of the mean wage. In 1992, Reilly used this decomposition technique to decompose wage differentials between 6 local labour markets in the UK. The decomposition allows to decompose mean wage differences into two parts, one which is the consequence of individual characteristics in those 6 labour marketsAberdeen, Coventry, Kircaldy, Northampton, Rochdale and Swindon are the six local labour markets used. and the other one which is due to unexplained differences. The author finds that the differences in wages between labour markets is at around 20%, and that between Aberdeen and Rochdale, 50% of this difference is explained by workers' characteristics, the other part is not explained. The unexplained differences can be thought of being consequences of differences in local areas attractiveness. Though this author does not give any evidence that this is the case. Similar results are obtained by García and Molina for SpainThey divided Spain into 5 main regions (North, South, East, Centre and Madrid) and used the Oaxaca technique with data from 1994They use a cross sectional data for 1994 (European Community Household panel) combined with regional price and population data from the National Statistics Institute (INE). They have 4450 individual observations that were divided into 5 main regions (North, South, East, Centre and Madrid). They introduce controls into their wage equations for occupation, education, industry, gender, age, tenure and whether they have a second language. Pereira and Galego analysed wage differentials in Portugal using dynamics. They also found similar results to García and Molina and to Reilly.They use data from the Quadros de Pessoal for 1995 and 2002. This data is compulsory for all employers with at least one employee. It is completed and sent to the ministry of employment of Portugal. It does not concern employees of public administration, the armed forces and self employed professionals. They considered only workers between 16 and 65 and excluded fisheries, agriculture and unpaid family workers and apprentices. They also excluded workers in Madeira and the Açores. = Area characteristics = Part of the attractiveness of areas is the cost-of-living. An area with a lower cost-of- living should be more attractive than areas with an expensive cost-of-living. Unfortunately, it is difficult to measure within countries cost-of-living. In an article published in 1983, Shah and Walker estimated a wage equation for male white workers in the UK using the general household survey of 1973. They adjust their regressions on individual characteristics, industry mix and cost- of-living. They introduced regional dummies for 15 regions:Greater London, South East, West Midlands, North West, Scotland (West Coast, East Coast, North and South), Wales (South East and not South East), South West, East Midlands, East Anglia, York/Humberside, North East. The cost-of-living proxy is taken from Reward Regional Surveys Ltd which publish reports on cost-of-living and regional comparisons from 1974 up to at least 1996 The description of the construction of those cost-of-living is not clear.The descriptions in Shad and Walker (1983) and in Johnston et al. (1996) are not very clear. Though that is how it can be summarised: the Reward Group assumes that households with two adults and two children of age 10 and 13 are representatives of the “communities”. From those households they gather 200 retail prices in 100 locations to which are added 18 regional prices for fuel and car insurances and 31 national prices covering newspapers, stamps, licences etc. The prices are weighted according to eight patterns of expenditure of the households. Wage differentials change and sometimes are reversed when they introduce the cost-of-living, Scotland and the South East of England are worse off when introducing cost-of-living compared to the Midlands regions. This result can be though of some evidence of the fact that differences in monetary reward are not the same as the differences in real-term awards. This suggests that the differences in wages between regions compensate at least partly for differences in cost-of-living. In 1991, Blackaby and Murphy estimated standardised geographical wage differentialsThe authors estimated a wage equation with a complete set of industry, regional dummies and interactions between the two using the General Household Survey of 1982. They restricted their sample to individuals who had worked more than 27 hours and had reported weekly earnings which resulted in a sample of 6999 individuals. They also controlled for individual characteristics (age, age square, gender, experience and education). and then explained these geographical wage differentials with a set of weather,They used year averages of rainfall, sunshine, gale days … Taken from the monthly weather report of the meteorological offices. environmentalThey used atmospheric pollution, road congestion and the overall provision of recreational facilities. and prices indexes.They matched their data with the New Earnings Survey data of the same year (1982). They introduced additional control for size of the plant and effort based on workers paid by results. They also included data on union wages. In the UK in 1982, wages, if set by collective bargaining, have national collective bargain as well as local ones. Thus they used proportions of people covered by either national bargaining, national and local ones for each regions of their analysis. The authors include other variables based on two other theories: efficiency wage and search theory. The results provide some evidence that workers are not suffering from money illusion as where areas with prices are higher by 10% than another area also have wages 10% higher. In consequence, wage do compensate for local differences in prices. In England, wages are usually thought of being better in the South than in the North of the country. Though Blackaby and Murphy show that wages when controlled for individual characteristics, occupations characteristics, cost-of-living and industry mix are better in the North than in the SouthThe South is defined as South-East, South-West, East Anglia, East Midlands. for manual workers. Thus they conclude that it makes sense for unemployed in the North to wait and look for a job in the North as that is where they will get relatively better pay. This give some extra evidence that wage differentials compensate, at least partly, for geographical differences in cost-of-living. Discussion=Possible confusion with other concepts The terms compensation differential, pay differential, and wage differential (see wage dispersion or economic inequality) are also used in economics, but normally have a different meaning. They simply refer to differences in total pay (or the wage rate) in any context. So a 'compensation differential' can be explained by many factors, such as differences in the skills of the workers in those jobs, the country or geographical area in which those jobs are performed, or the characteristics of the jobs themselves. A 'compensating differential', in contrast, refers exclusively to differences in pay due to differences in the jobs themselves, for a given worker (or for two identical workers). In the theory of price indices, economists also use the term compensating variation, which is yet another unrelated concept. A 'compensating variation' is the change in wealth required to leave a consumer's well-being unchanged when prices change.

It took place in the townland of Clonfin (or Cloonfin) between Ballinalee and Granard in County Longford. The IRA ambushed two lorries carrying members of the British Auxiliary Division, sparking a lengthy gun battle in which four Auxiliaries were killed and eight wounded. The Auxiliaries eventually surrendered and their weapons were seized. The IRA commander, Seán Mac Eoin, won some praise for helping the wounded Auxiliaries. Following the ambush, British forces burned a number of houses and farms in the area, and shot dead an elderly farmer. Background The IRA's North Longford Flying Column, 21 strong and led by Seán Mac Eoin, had been formed in late 1920. In that year they had killed four Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) policemen. In November, a company of the Auxiliary Division - a paramilitary police force made up of ex-military officers - had been stationed in the county to put down the local IRA, and were reinforced in January 1921. Whereas previously the IRA had tried to operate in relatively large numbers, often attacking police barracks, from this point on, their GHQ in Dublin ordered smaller but more frequent attacks to be made. The ambush site, on the road between Granard and Ballinalee, was well chosen. Mac Eoin selected a position where the ambushers had excellent cover and were barely visible to the British. The plan was to explode a mine as the lorries passed. The British assessment was that, \\"the ambush was most cleverly laid\\" The ambush The IRA detonated the roadside improvised explosive device as two British lorries were passing a bridge, killing the driver of the first lorry instantly. The IRA unit then opened fire on the lorries, triggering a fire-fight of two hours. One of the Auxiliaries got away and managed to summon reinforcements.Michael Hopkinson, The Irish War of Independence, p. 143. During the fighting, four members of the IRA party worked their way around the flank of the Auxiliaries, killing their commander, Lt. Commander Worthington Craven. After his death, the remaining policemen surrendered. A total of four Auxiliaries had been killed and eight wounded.RIC Memorial Roll, policememorial.org.uk; accessed 22 August 2014. MacEoin's treatment of his prisoners was humane. He congratulated them on the fight they had put up and prevented his fighters from assaulting the Auxiliaries. He also had water brought from nearby houses for the British wounded. When he was later captured by the British, three Auxiliaries testified at his court martial to his generous treatment of them at Clonfin. Mac Eoin's humane treatment reportedly delayed the IRA's getaway and they were almost caught by 14 lorries of British reinforcements as they escaped across Clonfin Wood. The IRA had captured 18 rifles, 20 revolvers ammunition, a Lewis gun and 800 rounds of ammunition. Aftermath In the aftermath of the ambush, British forces raided the nearby towns of Killoe, Ballinamuck, Drumlish, Ballinalee, Edgeworthstown, Granard and Ardagh. A number of houses and farms were burnt. They shot dead an elderly farmer, Michael Farrell, in reprisal for the ambush.Marie Coleman, County Longford and the Irish Revolution, pp. 125-27, 133. The IRA flying column lay low after the ambush and did not attempt any more attacks until the end of the month. MacEoin, the Longford IRA leader, was captured at Mullingar railway station in early March and charged with the murder of RIC DI MGrath. He was released in July under the terms of the Truce which ended hostilities. In his absence, the Longford IRA were not able to sustain the intensity of their campaign. A memorial was later erected at the site of the ambush. The IRA combatants were: MacEoin (Ballinalee), Sean Duffy (Ballinalee), James J. Brady (Ballinamuck), Tom Brady (Cartronmarkey), Paddy Callaghan (Clonbroney), Seamus Conway (Clonbroney), Pat Cooke (Tubber), Seamus Farrelly (Purth), Paddy Finnegan (Molly), Larry Geraghty (Ballymore), Mick Gormley (Killoe), Hugh Hourican (Clonbroney), Jack Hughes (Scrabby), Mick Kenny (Clonbroney), Paddy Lynch (Colmcille), John McDowell (Clonbroney), Jack Moore (Streete), Mick Mulligan (Willsbrook), Michael F.

He is best known as the suspected perpetrator of the 1920 Wall Street Bombing, which killed 38 people, seriously injured 143, and injured hundreds more. Early life and career Buda was born in the city of Savignano sul Rubicone, in the region of Romagna that at the time was a center of anarchism and it is very possible that he became an anarchist in the beginning of his teenage years. He was a restless young man, and at fifteen years of age he was arrested for robbery and then later, faced a conviction for noise pollution in the night. After he was discharged from jail, he began work as an apprentice shoemaker, but finding no economic stability, he decided to emigrate to the United States in 1907. There he was hired to work as a gardener, mason, worker in a telephone company as well as a hat factory, and many other menial jobs. In America, he spent many long periods of terrible economic hardship, so in 1911 he decided to return to Italy. Two years later, he returned to the United States, settling in Boston (Massachusetts), where he worked as a laborer in the footwear industry.  Life in the United States, and Sacco and Vanzetti meeting  Buda, met Nicola Sacco during the strike of 1913 in Hopedale, and three years later, he met Bartolomeo Vanzetti in Plymouth. He began to attend the anarchist group of these two Italian-Americans who were followers of Luigi Galleani, and also devoted his free time to the organization of free Italian anarchist schools, where Italian immigrants were taught the rudiments of anarchism. In 1916, he was arrested in Boston, for taking part in a demonstration against the US intervention in World War I. During the proceedings against him, he refused to take the oath on the Bible, and was sentenced to five months in prison. In 1917, to escape the call of the army after the US entry into the war, he went with Sacco and Vanzetti and others to Monterrey (Mexico), which at this time had a vibrant community of Italian anarchists. During this time, Buda made a living as a laborer in a laundry room, sharing his salary with the other members of the community.  Activities  In 1916, the Preparedness Day Bombing in San Francisco resulted in 50 people being killed or wounded; Buda's participation could be neither proved nor disproved. In 1917, Buda met with ten other anarchists (including his friend Carlo Valdinoci). A bomb was placed alongside the Italian Evangelical Mission Church in Milwaukee's Third Ward (24 November). The device was discovered and brought to the police station where it detonated, causing the death of 9 policemen and two civilians. The bomb was thought to be an attempted retaliation for the September 1917 Bay View incident, in which two were killed during a hostile exchange between a group of local Italians and pro-American patriotism pastor, Rev. August Giuliani, of the Italian Evangelical Mission Church.. The authorities, however, were never able to prove the guilt of the accused, because many of them were in prison at time of the bombing. As a response, anarchist bombings followed across the country (on 2 June 1919, bombs were set off in Paterson, New Jersey, Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C.), although most did not create serious consequences. In this climate, the Immigration Act of 1918 was promulgated, by which foreigners who were involved or simply accused of subversive activities could be expelled. Many anarchists were repatriated to their countries of origin because of this law.  Wall Street bombing  1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. On 11 September 1920, the anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti, Buda's friends and companions, were charged with robbery and murder in South Braintree, and the climate, already simmering from the promulgation of anti-anarchist laws and the deportation of Luigi Galleani, literally got over-heated. Five days later, on 16 September, at noon, a man traveled to Wall Street with a horse-drawn cart, and stopped between the headquarters of the J.P. Morgan bank and the New York Stock Exchange Building. At noon, the cart, loaded with 100 pounds of dynamite and 500 pounds of cast- iron sash weights, exploded through a timed device. The bank and other buildings were severely damaged but remained intact. 38 people died and another two hundred were injured. The US authorities responded promptly. The investigation was headed by William J. Flynn, director between 1919 and 1921 of the Bureau of Investigation, the forerunner of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. About Flynn, Attorney General Palmer said, \\"Flynn is a hunter of anarchists ... the greatest expert in anarchist circles of the United States\\". Flynn claimed that the attack was a response to the arrest of Sacco and Vanzetti. Flynn immediately began to track the anarchists and showed particular interest in the followers of Luigi Galleani's related Subversive Chronicle newspaper. In particular, attention was turning to Mario Buda, based on the testimony of a blacksmith who had rented the horse which was used to pull the explosive wagon. Buda, however, was able to avoid detection and left New York to embark on a trip back to his old home in Italy.  Activity in Italy  After some time back in Italy, Buda was arrested in Savignano, being charged with having participated in the clashes between fascists and Anti- fascists on 28 February 1921, during which he had supposedly killed a police sergeant. Accused along with 15 other people, all were acquitted due to lack of evidence. On 10 August 1922, during a search of his home, police found numerous letters, which he had received from American anarchists with whom he had kept in touch, including a letter written by Nicola Sacco. Between 1925 and 1927 he commuted to Rimini, where he found work as a shoemaker. Buda made no secret of his friendship with Sacco and Vanzetti, who in the meantime had been sentenced to death. Three days before the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti on 23 August 1927, Buda was arrested and later sentenced to five years of confinement to be served in the island of Lipari, where he again met Luigi Galleani as well as Umberto Tommasini. In 1932 he was moved to Ponza and shortly after he was set free. He moved for two months to Switzerland, after which he returned to his home in Savignano. The Communist newspaper of France claimed that Mario Buda was an espionage agent of Benito Mussolini's secret police and that he had come to France to betray other anarchists to the authorities. This was never proven because after his return to Savignano, he never left, and continued his trade working in the production and sale of shoes.  Death  In 1955, Mario Buda allegedly admitted to his nephew that he had built and detonated the Wall Street bomb. He had even remained at the scene after the explosion, but was neither interviewed nor arrested. He fled to his native Italy, where he remained under the pseudonym Mike Boda until his death. He was never brought to trial for his admitted crimes, which are supposed to include the detonation of the Milwaukee bomb of November 1917 (see Activities). The Wall Street bombing case was never officially closed.

He is played by Anthony Quayle.  Film  Brighton first appears at T. E. Lawrence's funeral. He has the film's first line of dialogue: \\"He was the most extraordinary man I ever knew.\\" Brighton is mentioned in early scenes as being the chief British liaison to the Arab Revolt. He first meets Lawrence during the canyon scene (when Lawrence sings \\"The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo\\" to himself) and then briefs Lawrence on the situation. Brighton seems to take umbrage with Lawrence and his presence there, and advises Lawrence to \\"keep your mouth shut\\" once they get into camp. Their conversation is interrupted when Turkish airplanes begin bombing the camp of Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness), whom Brighton complains has ignored his request to withdraw to the south. Feisal speaks with Brighton and Lawrence for the first time after the raid, saying that he will agree to Brighton's advice, but wishes to move the wounded to Yenbo. Brighton is seen in the exodus scene, witnessing the prank played by Farraj (Michel Ray) and Daud (John Dimech) on Corporal Jenkins, Brighton's aide (Norman Rossington). He then engages in a heated strategic discussion with Feisal and Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif), who accuse him and the British of having imperialist designs. Brighton dismisses their pleas for artillery and modern equipment, emphasizing that he feels discipline and training is more important. He clashes with Lawrence in this scene, disagreeing with his idea of the Bedouin engaging in guerrilla warfare and referring to Lawrence at one point as a traitor. Feisal agrees to Brighton's plan to withdraw to Yenbo, and exits the tent. Brighton reappears at the end of Act I, confronting Lawrence in the Cairo bar after he has seized Aqaba. Though initially sceptical, he becomes proud of Lawrence's achievement and arranges for him to meet with the new commander, General Edmund Allenby (Jack Hawkins). He sits in on Lawrence and Allenby's conference and expresses admiration for Lawrence's achievement: \\"I think you should recommend a decoration, sir. I don't think it matters what his motives were - it was a brilliant bit of soldiering!\\" Brighton is next seen early in Act II, after Lawrence's first successful train raid. He is still attached to the forces of the Arab Revolt (he would be overall commander since he is superior to the now-Major Lawrence), and chastises Sherif Ali and the Arabs over their method of looting and then deserting the army. He drives around in an armoured car and mans a machine gun during the train raids. He openly clashes with Auda ibu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) after Auda deserts following a successful raid: *Auda: You are a fool. *Brighton: Maybe. I am NOT a deserter! *Auda: Give thanks to God, Brighton, that when He made you a fool, He gave you a fool's face! *Brighton: You are an impudent rascal! *Auda: I must go, Aurens, before I soil myself with a fool's blood. While Lawrence and his ever-shrinking forces continue north towards Deraa, Brighton returns to Cairo and meets with Allenby. He informs Allenby that Lawrence is exaggerating the size of his force, and defends Lawrence and his actions from a sceptical Allenby, who fears Lawrence has \\"gone native\\". Brighton briefly appears in the Jerusalem scene, acting a secretary/aide to Allenby, though his only dialogue is to greet Lawrence. It is clear by this time that he genuinely admires Lawrence and his ability. Brighton next appears at the staff meeting for General Allenby's army in the field, discussing the movements of the Arab army, and is assigned to find and report on them. Brighton meets Allenby a few scenes later, discussing Lawrence's cocky attitude and expressing fear that he might reach Damascus first - unless they are slowed by a large column of retreating Turks. Brighton is already in Damascus when General Allenby arrives, informing Allenby of the Arab Council's success in taking over the city. Though Brighton feels the Arabs unable to rule the city, Allenby, at the advice of Dryden (Claude Rains), refuses to aid the Arabs. Brighton chastises Allenby, saying that it's a \\"heavy responsibility\\" in allowing the Arabs to collapse in chaos. Brighton later appears with Lawrence's departure and the subsequent conference between Allenby, Feisal, and Dryden. He ultimately becomes so disgusted by their cold attitude towards Lawrence that he excuses himself, hoping to meet Lawrence and express his admiration. Unfortunately, Lawrence has already left, and Brighton is left observing the anarchy engulfing Damascus, with tears in his eyes.  Historical basis  Brighton was created by Robert Bolt as an amalgam of various officers who served with T. E. Lawrence during the war. Historically, there was no equivalent to Brighton at the time that Lawrence joined with Feisal, although there were a handful of lower-ranking French and British officers who served primarily as weapons advisors. The character most historically similar to Brighton was, perhaps, Lt. Colonel Stewart F. Newcombe, who was a close friend of Lawrence, and unlike Brighton was able to gain acceptance by the Arabs. He was captured in 1917 but was able to escape with the help of a Turkish girl, although he never returned to the Arabian theatre. Newcombe would continue his friendship with Lawrence after the war; he was one of the pallbearers at Lawrence's funeral. In Michael Wilson's original script, Brighton was named Colonel Newcombe. Other notable officers include Captains Boyle and Garland, the latter responsible for the first British/Arab raid on the Hejaz Railway, Alan Dawnay, Allenby's liaison to the Arabs through 1918, and Lt. Col. Charles E. Wilson, who served as official commander of the British attachment over Lawrence in 1917. Wilson had a much more fractious relationship with Lawrence than the above officers; Lawrence initially did everything he could to avoid serving under Wilson's direct command.  Characterisation  Brighton was considered by director David Lean to be \\"the only honourable character in the film\\", while actor Anthony Quayle thought Brighton was an idiot. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056172/trivia Robert Bolt interpreted the character as \\"stand(ing) for the half-admiring, half appalled disturbance raised by Lawrence in minds quite wedded to the admirable and inadequate code of English decency\\". http://www.telawrence.info/telawrenceinfo/legacy3/film/film3.htm Whatever intentions Lean, Quayle, and Bolt had regarding the character, both interpretations can be read into the character. In the early scenes at Feisal's camp, Brighton comes across as a stuffy, conventional British officer. He is disgusted by the somewhat effeminate Lawrence and seems to hold the Arabs in contempt. His insistence on \\"discipline\\" show him to be an inflexible regular army man, although in this scene he shows some hint of flexibility by expressing interest in Lawrence's proposed guerrilla strategy. However, Brighton gradually becomes respectful towards Lawrence, frequently expressing admiration towards him and even defending him to Allenby, Dryden and others. Unlike Lawrence's other superiors, who simply wish to manipulate him, Brighton genuinely admires Lawrence. It is clear that Brighton does have a strong sense of honour, as evidenced by his disgust with the Arab practice of desertion and his arguments with Ali and Auda. His distaste towards Allenby's \\"hands-off\\" approach towards the collapse of the Arab Council, the British betrayal of the Arabs, and the disrespectful and cold treatment of Lawrence by his superiors leads him to storm out of the conference room abruptly. A similar character appears in Terence Rattigan's Lawrence-themed play Ross, in the form of Colonel Barrington, although Barrington maintains his contempt throughout the whole of the play, feeling Lawrence to be an unfeeling, soulless brute.

It was an attempt to link Cornwall and Devon together in an economic, political and statistical sense to form a South West region. This involved combining and centralising some local government functions and services such as the police, ambulance, fire services and media output such as local TV and newspapers. History The Liberal Democrats supported this process until the late 1990s. The process was opposed by the Cornish political party Mebyon Kernow and did not receive widespread support from the Cornish public. After the 1997 general election the Liberal Democrat partly withdrew their support as they said that they agreed that the 'Devonwall' process undermined Cornwall's claims to European Objective One funding. Cornish demands for Objective One grant aid in the early 1990s for regeneration were often dismissed by Government officials as unrealistic and unobtainable. but this ignored the fact that of the 56 most deprived areas in Devon and Cornwall, 51 were in Cornwall. Cornwall also had less than 75% of the average European GDP but these statistics were hidden when statistically Cornwall and Devon (with a higher GDP) were linked together. There were also claims that 'Devonwall' was an attempt by politicians to hijack the Cornish Celtic identity. In 1998 Cornwall was recognised by the UK Government as having \\"distinct cultural and historical factors reflecting a Celtic background\\", thus allowing it to be separated in a regional and economic sense from Devon. This fact underlines the importance of Celticity to Cornwall in recent years. In July 2000 Mebyon Kernow issued the \\"Declaration for a Cornish Assembly\\". > \\"Cornwall is a distinct region. It has a clearly defined economic, > administrative and social profile. Cornwall's unique identity reflects its > Celtic character, culture and environment. We declare that the people of > Cornwall will be best served in their future governance by a Cornish > regional assembly. We therefore commit ourselves to setting up the Cornish > Constitutional Convention with the intention of achieving a devolved Cornish > Assembly–Senedh Kernow.\\" Objective One funding Between 2000 and 2006, £350 million of Objective One funding was made available to Cornwall and the next 'tranche' (called Convergence funding) will last between the beginning of 2008 to 2013 and will be worth £445 million. There have been many complaints from Cornish people that the management of the Objective One investment is largely controlled from outside Cornwall., by the South West Regional Development Agency (SWRDA), in Exeter and Bristol. Cornwall is the only Objective One region in the UK and Europe where the project is administered from outside the region. Today many Cornish organisations such as Mebyon Kernow, Cornish Solidarity, the Liberal Democrats, the Cornish Constitutional Convention and Conservative PPCs and independent councillors still campaign against the 'Devonwall' concept and are in favour of Cornwall being run as a distinct cultural, economic and administrative region with its own assembly. There was renewed opposition to \\"Devonwall\\" in Cornwall in 2010, when the new government announced that local enterprise partnerships will replace regional development agencies. Devon County Council and Devon-based business interests, including the media, wanted to join with Cornwall to form a \\"Devonwall\\" LEP, but there was widespread opposition to this in Cornwall., with Cornwall Council favouring a Cornwall and Isles of Scilly LEP. Possible Parliamentary constituency Further opposition arose in 2010 to a cross-border parliamentary constituency, dubbed a \\"Devonwall\\" constituency, as part of the coalition government's plans to reform the electoral boundaries. It was condemned by Mebyon Kernow and the Keep Cornwall Whole campaign, who planned protests in Saltash by the boundary of the historical division between Devon and Cornwall, one of which took place in October 2010.This is Cornwall:Hundreds gather in protest of 'Devonwall' constituency It was announced in September 2011 that the proposed new seat would include Bude in North Cornwall and Bideford in West Devon.This is Cornwall:New Devonwall constituency The idea resurfaced following the Conservative party victory in the 2015 UK general election, within which they took every Cornish seat.

Ernst Lissauer (16 December 1882 in Berlin - 10 December 1937 in Vienna) was a German-Jewish poet and dramatist remembered for the phrase Gott strafe England (\\"May God punish England\\"). He also created the Hassgesang gegen England, or \\"Song of Hate against England\\". Lissauer was \\"a round little man, a jolly face above a double double-chin, bubbling over with self-importance and exuberance,\\" according to his friend Stefan Zweig.Zweig, Stefan (1964). The World of Yesterday. Translation first published 1943; original German: Die Welt von Gestern (1941). Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press. p. 231. He was a committed nationalist and a devotee of the Prussian tradition as well as an ambitious poet. Zweig said of him: \\"Germany was his world and the more Germanic anything was, the more it delighted him.\\" His devotion to German history, poetry, art and music was, in his own words, a monomania, and it only increased with the outbreak of World War I, when he penned his hate song. Wilhelm II decorated him with the Order of the Red Eagle. Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria ordered it printed on leaflets and distributed to every soldier in the army.Elon, Amos (2002). The Pity of It All. New York: Henry Holt. p. 324-325. Despite his obvious zeal, Lissauer ended by pleasing no one. He came to be criticised by the vigorous anti- Semitic movement of the day for expressing such \\"fanatical hatred\\", which they considered \\"unreasonable\\", \\"utterly un-German\\", and \\"characteristic of nothing so much as the Jewish race\\". Houston Stewart Chamberlain declared that the Teutonic German did not \\"wallow in Old Testament hate.\\" Over in England, Arthur Conan Doyle said in his book The German War: \\"This sort of thing is, it must be admitted, very painful and odious. It fills us with a mixture of pity and disgust, and we feel as if - instead of a man - we were really fighting with a furious, screaming woman.\\" Lissauer himself came to regret writing the Hassgesang, refusing to allow it to be printed in school text books. After the war he said that his poem was born out of the mood of the times, and that he did not really mean it to be taken seriously. In 1926 he said that rather than writing a hymn of hate against England it would have been better if he written a hymn of love for Germany. In every sense an unfortunate man, Lissauer spared no pains to balance two traditions, one Jewish and the other German, at a time when history was forcing them apart. The Third Reich's advent forced him to flee his native land for Austria. In 1936, then living in Vienna, he wrote: \\"To the Germans I am a Jew masked as a German; to the Jew a German faithless to Israel.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * Elisabeth Albanis, German- Jewish Cultural Identity from 1900 to the Aftermath of the First World War: A Comparative Study of Moritz Goldstein, Julius Bab and Ernst Lissauer, Tübingen: Niemeyer, 2002.

Just as the First Dáil established a parallel Irish Republic in opposition to the British Dublin Castle administration, so Comhairle na dTeachtaí attempted to establish a legitimatist government in opposition to the Provisional Government and Government of the Irish Free State established by the Third Dáil.

In 1926 de Valera resigned as President, left the Sinn Féin party and founded Fianna Fáil, which in 1927 entered the Fourth Dáil. Comhairle na dTeachtaí, never more than a symbolic body, was thereby rendered defunct. Fianna Fáil members spoke at a Comhairle na dTeachtaí meeting in December 1926, whose minutes were discovered in a 1928 raid on Cumann na mBan headquarters and published in 1930 by the Cumann na nGaedheal government.

It has a verse and chorus, as well as a third section, though the third section is often omitted in recordings. Like most popular songs of the era it features a 32 bar chorus, though with an extended coda. The song was written for the film Swing Time (1936), where it was introduced by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Rogers plays a dance instructor whom Astaire follows into her studio; he pretends to have \\"two left feet\\" in order to get her to dance with him. Astaire sings the verse to her and she responds with the chorus. After an interlude, they dance to the tune.

Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668 (1984), was a United States Supreme Court case challenging the legality of Christmas decorations on town property. Background Pawtucket, Rhode Island's annual Christmas display in the city's shopping district, consisting of a Santa Claus house, a Christmas tree, a banner reading \\"Season's Greetings,\\" and a crèche, was challenged in court. The crèche had been a part of the display since at least 1943. The plaintiffs brought the suit to the District Court of Rhode Island, which permanently enjoined the city from displaying the Nativity scene as a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling. The city then petitioned to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari. Ruling Chief Justice Burger delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Justices White, Powell, Rehnquist, and O'Connor joined. The Supreme Court reversed previous rulings in a vote of 5–4, ruling that the display was not an effort to advocate a particular religious message and had \\"legitimate secular purposes.\\" It held that the crèche did not violate the Establishment Clause based on the test created in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971). They ruled that the crèche is a passive representation of religion and that there was \\"insufficient evidence to establish that the inclusion of the crèche is a purposeful or surreptitious effort to express some kind of subtle governmental advocacy of a particular religious\\" view. They also stated that the Constitution \\"affirmatively mandates accommodation, not merely tolerance of all religions, and forbids hostility toward any.\\" The Court ruled that the crèche has a legitimate secular purpose within a larger holiday display to celebrate the season and the origins of Christmas which has long been a part of Western culture. The Federal \\"Government has long recognized—indeed it has subsidized—holidays with religious significance.\\" For example, the first Congress that passed the First Amendment enacted legislation providing for paid Chaplains in the House and Senate, and \\"It has long been the practice that federal employees are released from duties on Thanksgiving and Christmas while being paid.\\" The court compared the crèche to the display of religious paintings in government funded museums. In addition, the crèche requires only minimal expenses for assembly and dismantling. The Court also stated, \\"no inquiry into potential political divisiveness is even called for\\" because the situation does not involve direct aid to church-sponsored organizations and because the crèche been displayed for 40 years with no problems. Concurrence Justice O’Connor, in her concurring opinion, offered a \\"clarification\\" of how the Establishment Clause should be read: This is sometimes referred to as the \\"Endorsement test.\\" A law which fails this test is found to be unconstitutional because it \\"endorses\\" religion or religious beliefs in such a way that it tells those who agree that they are favored insiders and those who disagree that they are disfavored outsiders. The other side of the coin would be the \\"disapproval\\" of religion or religious beliefs in such a way that those who agree with the beliefs are told that they are disfavored outsiders while those who disagree with the beliefs are told that they are favored insiders. Dissent Justices Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens dissented. The dissenting opinion argued that the case did not pass the Lemon test. The secular display surrounding their secular purpose of celebrating of a national holiday could have been done without a clearly religious symbol that supports only one religion to the exclusion of others giving one group public approval of their views. Even if other religious groups are allowed to include \\"'competing efforts [by religious groups] to gain or maintain the support of government' may 'occasio[n] considerable civil strife.'\\" The religious crèche is also placed in a central location within the display, which makes even less of the Court's idea that Pawtucket was just including all of the traditional images. The dissenting opinion also mentions that it cannot be compared to a religious display in a museum because it is not solely being considered as a piece of art but as a religious symbol as well. The government recognition of Christmas previously has only been to recognize the secular parts of Christmas, such as spending time with family. The minority also dissented, noting that \\"Those who believe in the message of the nativity receive the unique and exclusive benefit of public recognition and approval of their views\\" and that the creche provides \\"a significant symbolic benefit to religion...\\" The dissent argued \\"The effect on minority religious groups, as well as on those who may reject religion, is to convey the message that their views are not similarly worthy of public recognition nor entitled to public support. It was precisely this sort of chauvinism that the Establishment Clause was intended forever to prohibit.\\"  See also  * County of Allegheny v.

History No. 6 Squadron is one of the ten senior squadrons of the Indian Air Force. Formed prior to independence, its varied roles have included air-sea rescue, counter-air, fighter-reconnaissance, maritime reconnaissance, maritime strike, target towing and transport. The squadron was formed as a fighter-reconnaissance unit at Trichinopoly (now Tiruchirapally) on 1 December 1942 under the command of Squadron Leader (later Air Commodore) Mehar Singh. It participated in the Indian Air Force's tenth anniversary review at Ambala, and received an award for \\"the best looking aircraft\\". The squadron continued working-up, until November that year. In November 1943, flying Hawker Hurricane FR.IIb No 6 Squadron IAF moved to Cox's Bazar as a part of the RAF Third Tactical Air Force (Third TAF) for the Second Arakan Campaign. During this campaign, No 6 Squadron was the only specialist reconnaissance unit available to support the Fourteenth Army on this front, earning the name \\"The Eyes of the Fourteenth Army\\". They were also dubbed \\"the Arakan Twins\\" for flying in the standard tactical reconnaissance pairing of Leader and Weaver. Returning from his Arakan Front visit in mid-January 1944, General Sir William Slim, GOC Fourteenth Army, wrote in his memoirs how impressed he was with this reconnaissance squadron. For services during the squadron's tour of operations, Flight-Lieutenant Rawal Singh was awarded the MBE, and Sergeant BM Kothari, the head of the photographic section, received the British Empire Medal. In addition, Flying Officer (later Air Commodore) JD Aquino and Pilot Officer (later Wing Commander) LRD Blunt were commended by the Air Officer Commanding.http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/Sqn/006.html Assignments *Burma Campaign *Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 *Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 Aircraft *Hawker Hurricane *Jaguar IM/IS References 006 Category:Military units and formations of India in World War II Category:1942 establishments in India ","title":"No. 6 Squadron IAF"},{"id":"12709449","title":"James O'Brien (New Zealand politician)"},{"id":"12709458","text":"Parantica pseudomelaneus is a species of nymphalid butterfly in the subfamily Danainae.

It is a small crab that lives commensally in the tube of a tube-dwelling worm. It was one of the first marine crustaceans to be included on the IUCN Red List in 1996. Description Parapinnixa affinis is similar to other pea crabs of the genus Parapinnixa, especially P. nitida. It differs from P. nitida in the proportions of its carapace, which is more than twice as wide as long in P. nitida but less than twice as wide as long in P. affinis. The carapace is approximately wide, with a maximum of . The carapace is usually \\"light amber mottled with dark ochre\\", but 5% of crabs are albino. Distribution Parapinnixa affinis appears to be endemic to Southern California, having been recorded from San Pedro, Anaheim Landing, Newport Bay and San Diego. It was once recorded from Siberia, but this record is doubtful. Conservation and ecology Parapinnixa affinis was one of only two marine crustaceans to be included on the IUCN's list of endangered species in 1996, the other being the coconut crab. Many others have been added later. It lives commensally in the tubes of the polychaete worms Terebella californica and Loimia. A bryozoan from the family Vesiculariidae is sometimes found on the legs of P. affinis. Taxonomy Parapinnixa affinis was first described by Samuel Jackson Holmes in 1900, in his Synopsis of California stalk-eyed Crustacea. The type specimen was a single female, collected in July 1895 from Dead Man's Island, San Pedro, California (now part of the Port of Los Angeles); it was donated to the University of California. P. affinis no longer lives at the type locality, which has been made unsuitable by the accumulation of \\"harbor refuse and oil\\". No further specimens were collected for over thirty years, until one was collected in 1930, and Steve Glassell collected specimens including an allotype in 1932.

They also prefer faster flowing streams than Hexagenia. This difference in habitat creates several morphological differences between the two genera. The mandibular tusks are used to excavate an open burrow in the substrate where the mayfly resides, therefore the size and strength of the head differs between the two genera in correlation to the different substrates in which they burrow. However, the best delineating feature between the two is that Pentagenia have a pointed frontal process with a minor cleft at the point.Keltner, J. and W. P. McCafferty. (1986).

His older brother Bartholomew I Báthory fell in 1432 fighting against the Hussites. Stephen first appears in 1419 as dapiferorum regalium magister (master of the royal stewards), and later as a judge royal. In 1435 he was appointed Palatine of Hungary by King Sigismund. Sigismund's short-lived successor, King Albert of Habsburg awarded him with the castle Bujak. In 1444 he was the flag-bearer of Władysław, King of Poland and Hungary, in the Battle of Varna, in which he fell alongside his King. Stephen was married twice: #Ursula, daughter of George de Kis Tapolcsa #Barbara, widowed Csapy After his death, his second wife Barbara went to court against Christine, the widow of Stephen's younger brother Thomas, with which she disputed a mill's revenue.

He was a member of the mystical Khajagan order. His father was the Sufi scholar Saif ud-Dīn Hamza (), a descendant of Prophet Muhammad. Saif ud- Dīn Hamza was Amir (chieftain) of the Tribe of Kulal, his full title being Amir-i-Kulal. After his father's death, Shams ud-Dīn became the Amir and head of the tribe. By this time his reputation as a scholar and religious figure had spread through Turkestan and the title Amir-i-Kulal, had become his common name. Kulal was named for his grandfather, also known as Shams ud-Dīn, the spiritual mentor of the Barlas tribe and Turghai, father of Amir Timur. Kulal had a number of students who later became prominent figures in history, including Baha-ud-Dīn Naqshband and the conqueror Amir Timur. After rise of the Timurid Dynasty, a close relationship began between the houses of Amir Timur and Amir Kulal and continued through the Mughal line in India. Kulal is buried at Sokhar, near Bukhara, Uzbekistan. Family lineage and Kulal tribe Amir Kulal's father, Amir Saif ud-Dīn Hamza, was a direct descendant of Husain ibn Ali, grandson of Muhammad. The entire tribe of Kulal were descended from Muhammad. The Kulal tribe settled in the area of modern-day Vabkent near the end of the twelfth century. Around 1340, the city was visited by Ibn Battuta who spent a night there as a guest. Battuta described it as beautiful, saying that it had \\"... many gardens and rivers\\".Ibn Battuta: Travels in Asia and Africa The tribe's date of settlement can be approximated with the remains of the madrasa (a form of Mosque) which was constructed at Vabkent in 1198 under the patronage of Burhan ud-Din Abdul Aziz II (whose name adorns the Madrasa's minaret, the only surviving segment of the building). The builders of the madrasa were members of the Kulal tribe and copied the Kalyan mosque (Po-i- Kalyan) style, making upgrades in the design and technology. This made the Vabkent madrasa a more refined form of Kalyan mosque. The tribe quickly established a small industrial base at the central market of Vabkent and built mills in the surrounding areas, which continued to operate well into the sixteenth century. The city's main industries were coin minting; alloying of steel; creating pottery; and milling. Their highly glazed pottery and tiles, unmatched in quality and quantity, were their main export. This earned the tribe the title of Kulal (potter) and gave them their name. Their kiln designs were highly efficient and were able to produce up to 1500 pots in each batch. Utilizing wind and water resources for milling and industrial processes coupled with efficient kiln designs resulted in considerably higher earnings per capita, leading to a healthy lifestyle for the entire tribe. Despite a history of wars and conflict in the area, the Kulal tribe was not once attacked. There are three main reasons for this: *The tribe was famous as being entirely composed of descendants of Muhammad, gaining them considerable respect from the neighboring tribes; this was a considerable advantage in a Muslim dominated country. *The city was surrounded by a terrain of gardens and greenery criss-crossed by numerous rivers and streams at one side and an endless desert at the other, which was barren and uninhabited. This, coupled with the lack of substantial material value in the small city, was a big enough deterrent for any invading army which would have to travel at least one day to reach the city which lied at the boundary of the Kyzyl Kum desert. *The social system was devised into three sections—the political system, monetary system, and publicity system. Their political system was simple. The most learned of the tribe was chosen as the head. The goal of the head, other than being the qazi and administrator was to represent the tribe and politically maneuver through times of war. Also, the post was not hereditary. No hereditary claim to the \\"throne\\" meant there wasn't one family in the tribe which would grow up to have amassed huge portions of tribe wealth in a couple of generations, in case the head turned out to be corrupt. Also, this avoided any mutual tussles between heirs of any deceased chieftain, as there was nothing to fight for. Their monetary system was even more advanced (for their time) than the political system. All of the mills and manufacturing plants were owned in essence by the community. Anyone willing and skilled was allowed to operate and earn a living as long as he kept the structure maintained and donated for construction of newer structures. The system worked superbly well and at least at a smaller scale of a couple of thousand individuals proved could be sustained for a number of centuries. Strict codes of intermarriages within the tribe, relatively small birthrates (compared to the one prevalent at the times), single marriages and continuous outward migration meant the population stayed nearly constant throughout the time period. By the time of Amir Kulal wrestling had become a Kulal trademark sport. The tribe held regular contests both at Vabkent and Bukhara in which outsiders also competed. The Kulal youth were almost always successful, instilling the idea of the Kulal tribe as superior and fierce warriors. The full name of Amir Kulal is as follows: > Amir Kulal ibn Hamzah ibn Ibraheem ibn Muhammad ibn (Muhammad) Hasan ibn > Abdullah AlShaheed ibn Jafar ibn Husain ibn Ali ibn Hasan AlQayem ibn > (Muhammad) Husain ibn (Ahmad) Husain ibn (Muhammad) Ali AlDaynori ibn Moussa > AbuSobha Moussa AlThani ibn Ibraheem AlMurtdha ibn Moussa AlKadhim ibn Jafar > AlSadiq ibn Muhammad AlBaqir ibn Ali Zainualabdeen ibn AlHusain AlSebit, son > of Fatimah ibnt Muhammad, ibn AlImam Ali ibn AbiTalib AlHashemi AlQurashi Early life Shams ud-Dīn Amir Kulal was born at Bukhara. His father Saif ud-Dīn Hamza was head of the Kulal tribe and a renowned scholar. As head of the tribe, Saif ud-Dīn Hamza was titled Amir-i-Kulal (Leader of Kulal tribe). Shams ud-Dīn was educated in his childhood and early in his life took the position of head of the madrasa at Vabkent. He was also known as a great wrestler. By the time he became the head of Kulal tribe his fame as a scholar and religious figure had spread through the surrounding region with many noble and powerful families sending their children to study under him, most notably from the Barlas Tribe. Amir-i-Kulal Shams ud-Dīn Kulal was elected as tribe's head after his father's death. Although all the heads of Kulal were titled Amir-i-Kulal, it was Shams ud-Dīn whose name has become synonymous with the title-name. Today, he is mostly remembered as Amir Kulal, rather than his birth name. Kulal continued to teach at the madrasa, even when he was head of the tribe. One of his most famous disciples was Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari, who used to work as an executioner in Bukhara under the rule of Qazan Khan ibn Yasaur. Legend says that Baha ud-Dīn was ordered to execute a man who had angered the king, but right before his execution the accused called upon Amir Kulal, identifying him as his teacher. Amir Kulal intervened and the accused was set free on his intercession. This was Baha ud-Dīn's first encounter with Amir Kulal. Impressed by him, Baha ud-Dīn became his student. Amir Kulal also had a sizable following of spiritual protégés. Of these the most prominent was Turghai who had previously been influenced by Amir Kulal's grandfather. After Turghai's death his son Timur held Amir Kulal in the same esteem, holding him as his spiritual guide. Around the year 1340, Ibn Battuta made a day stop at Vabkent who later described the city as beautiful with many rivers and gardens. He was Amir's guest at the city and was guided towards Bukhara, then at a day's travel from Vabkent. In the year 1357, Timur approached Amir Kulal for his advice on strategic maneuvers for attacking Uzbeks. It was under his advice that Timur changed his attack plan. Amir Kulal died in 770/1370 and was buried in Sukhar (Sokhar) near Bukhara. Sometimes Amir Kulal's tomb is confused with the tomb of his grandfather (also Shams ud-Dīn Kulal). It is Shams ud-Dīn Kulal (Amir Kulal's grandfather) who is buried at Shahrisabz(Kesh); the Green City. Amir Kulal's grandfather had constructed the madrasa Dor-i-Tilavat/Dorut Tilavat (House of Mediation) and was buried here after his death. Later, Timur transferred the body of his father Turghai, to be near the grave of Shams ud-Dīn (Amir Kulal's grandfather). Amir Kulal's grandfather was Turghai and Barlas Tribe's spiritual mentor. Majority of Timur's family is also buried at the same place. Recently, his tomb had been renovated under the orders of Uzbekistan's President. None of the books written by Amir Kulal still exist, although some excerpts and essays have survived in the family library. Three copies of a biography of Amir Kulal \\"Maqamat-i-Amir Kulal\\" written by his great grandson Shihab ul-Dīn have survived. Descendants After Amir Kulal's death his descendants, propagated from his four sons (Burhanudeen, Shah, Hamzah, and Omar), continued to assosciate with the Timurid and then Mughal dynasty kings and princes as their friends and teachers. Amir Kulal's grandson Amir Kalan (Muhammad ibn Shah ibn Amir Kulal) was entrusted with the education of young Ulugh Beg. Although Amir Kalan is renowned for his religious scholarship he was also well versed in mathematics and astronomy, and introduced these sciences to the young prince. At Ulugh Beg's madrasa Amir Kalan was considered one of the top ten teachers with unparalleled proficiency in ulum-i-yaainia, dinia and ulum-i-shariat. Amir Sultan (Muhammad Shmsudeen ibn Ali ibn Burhanudeen ibn Amir Kulal), another grandson of Amir Kulal married Ottoman Sultan, Bayezid I's daughter. After Babur established the Mughal Empire in India many of Amir Kulal's descendants moved there and continued to enjoy an influence in the Mughal dynasty. They remained as teachers and mentors of Mughal princes and kings or their close friends. Last of these was Shah Abbas, tutor of Mughal King Farrukhsiyar. By the time Farrukhsiyar was enthroned, the family had parted ways from the Mughals. After about one hundred years the family comes to prominence with Sheikh Samad Ali, one of the prominent students of Shah Abdul Aziz. Although his exploits as an engineering entrepreneur overshadows his scholarly work, his son Hakim Qadir Ali earned fame both as a scholar and doctor. His great grandson Shah Altaf was renowned as a scholar and scientist in the area around Delhi, and his school attracted many students from this area. After its founding, the majority of Amir Kulal's descendants emigrated to Pakistan. Shaykhan family The Shaykhan family claims ancestry from the Naqshbandi Sufi saint of Bukhara Shaykh Shams ud-Dīn Muhammad Amir Kulal. During the early period of Islamic history the ancestors of Amir Kulal migrated from Al Madinah and settled in Shaykhan Ninawa, Iraq where successive generations lived for over five centuries. The entire family later emigrated to Janah, Iraq and thereafter to Bukhara in modern Uzbekistan. The generations following Amir Kulal lived in Bukhara for more than a century. Some notable descendants included: Amir Hamzah Ibn Amir Kulal (d800H), known as Baba Mir, a leading Naqshbandi Sufi saint with large following of spiritual protégés; Amir Hasan Zaman Ibn Amir Hamzah (d 825H), buried in Sokhar near Bukhara. Amir Masud Zaman Ibn Amir Hasan Zaman (d 875H), buried in Samarkand; and Amir Muhammad Arifullah Ibn Amir Masud Zaman (847-909H), fourth in descent from Amir Kulal, a prominent Naqshbandi Sufi saint and a spiritual mentor of Umar Shaykh Mirza (1456-1494AD), ruler of the province of Fergana and father of Zahir ud-Dīn Muhammad Babur (1483-1530AD), founder of the Mughal empire in India. Emperor Babur, fifth in descent from Amir Timur and founder of the Timurid dynasty which ruled northern India for nearly four centuries, was mindful of his Central Asian origin and, following in the steps of Timur, gave extensive patronage to descendants of Amir Kulal. Shaykh Sayyid Zain ud-Dīn Ibn Amir Muhammad Arifullah (d.940H/1533AD) was a writer, a poet and belonged to Naqshbandi Sufi Order. Translated memoirs of Mughal Emperor Babur into Persian and was author of the book Tabaqat-e-Baburi. Shaykh Zain ud-Dīn was part of Babur's entourage when he occupied Kabul in 910H/1504AD and later in 932H/1525AD in his fifth expedition to Hindustan accompanied him to India. In his memoirs Babur writes that on entering Delhi after the victorious battle of Panipat in 932H/1526AD against Sultan Ibrahim Lodi he asked Shaykh Zain ud-Dīn to lead the Friday prayers and recite the Khutba (proclamation) in his name. Decrees of the Emperor announcing victories at the battle of Panipat and against Rana Sanga and the Rajput coalition at the battle of Khanua 933H/March 17, 1527AD were composed by Shaykh Zain ud-Dīn which were copied and dispatched to the entire realm. Shaykh Zain ud-Dīn was \\"Sadr-us-Sudur\\" responsible for the judicial administration and religious affairs of the Mughal Empire and also for drafting and issuing emperors decrees in accordance with the Quran and Sunnah. He died in Agra, India and was buried in the courtyard of a Madrasa built by him. Khwaja Sultan Ali Ibn Shaykh Zain ud-Dīn (d. 970H) was a minister with second Mughal emperor Humayun (1508-1556AD) and later ambassador to Iran during the reign of emperor Akbar (1556-1605AD). Amir Mansoor Khan Ibn Khawaja Sultan Ali (d. 982H) was a senior general in the Mughal army. He died while hunting near Hyderabad Deccan. Shaykh Sayyid Muhammad Adil Khan Ibn Amir Mansoor Khan (d. 1019H) served as a Mughal high- ranking military official in the provinces of Lahore, Multan, Kashmir and Kabul. Shaykh Sayyid Abu Saeed Ibn Shaykh Sayyid Mohammad Adil Khan (d.1043H) was a general in emperor Jahangir's (1569-1627AD) army and later performed important ministerial duties at Jehangir's court. Amir Shaykh Farrukh Zaman Khan Ibn Shaykh Sayyid Abu Saeed (d. 1089H) rose to the illustrious position of the Captain of the Mughal Red Fort at Shahjahanabad in emperor Shah jahan's reign (1627-1659AD) Amir Shah Sajawal Ibn Amir Shaykh Farrukh Zaman Khan (d. 1120H) eleventh in direct descent from Amir Kulal was a Naqshbandi Sufi saint and a tutor to Mughal princes during the reign of emperor Awrangzeb (1659-1707AD) apart from being officer in charge of administration of Mughal court. Amir Shaykh Muhammad Zaman Sikandrabadi Ibn Amir Shah Sajawal was a leading noble of Sikandrabad (Bulandshahr / India). He lived in the reign of emperor Muhammad Shah (1719-1748AD) and was awarded with an estate at Akbarpur, Salarpur near Delhi. This was a time when the Mughal empire was under severe decline. Nadir Shah and Ahmed Shah Abdali had sacked Delhi and many noble Muslim families were facing severe economic decline and disorder. However, Amir Shaykh Muhammad Zaman Sikandrabadi's descendants preserved the family traditions of Sufism and were notable sadaats (descendants of Muhammad) of Chehel Amiran (later Koocha Chelan) in Delhi. During the later Mughal period, the family continued to produce eminent men of learning who distinguished themselves in various walks of life. Shaykh Samad Ali ibn Amir Shaykh Mohammad Zaman an accomplished religious scholar and graduate of Rahimiya college (Delhi), a centre of Islamic Renaissance in the subcontinent under Shah Abdul Aziz Ibn Shah Waliullah (1746-1828 AD).

Another elder of the family Shaykh Nabi Buksh a tutor to Mughal princes was awarded an estate near Delhi in the reign of last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah (1837-1857). During the traumatic year of 1857 AD when the War of Independence started, the family played a significant role against the British. Many lost their lives, others fled Delhi and took refuge in small towns / villages namely lncholi, Hapur, Danpur, Aounla, Sambhal, Amroha, Badarpur, Malyana and Jalali. Shaykh Karamat Hussain along with his entire family including his eldest son Shaykh Altaf Hussain (d. 1956AD) and buried in grave yard Bibi Pak Daman, Lahore, Pakistan who was barely seven years old proceeded to Sikandarabad but feeling unsafe due to close proximity of Bulandshahr settled in his ancestor's maternal town Dibai.

Surendra Sai and his associates Madho Singh, Kunjal Singh, Airi Singh, Bairi Singh, Uddant Sai, Ujjal Sai, Khageswar Dao, Karunakar Singh, Salegram Bariha, Govind Singh, Pahar Singh, Rajee Ghasia, Kamal Singh, Hati Singh, Salik Ram Bariha, Loknath Panda/Gadtia, Mrutunjaya Panigrahi, Jagabandu Hota, Padmanave Guru, Trilochan Panigrahi and many others resisted the British and successfully protected most parts of Western Odisha region for some time from the British rule. Most of them died unnoticed fighting for freedom from the British. Many of them were hanged by the British; Hatte Singh died in the Vapor Island in the Andamans. Surendra Sai died in Asirgarh Jail on 28 February 1884.  Early life and background  Sai was born on 23 January 1809 in a village called Khinda about 40 km to the north of Sambalpur, Odisha. He was one of the seven children of Dharma Singh. The family was part of the Sambalpur state ruling clan.He belonged to the branch initiated by Anirudha Sai son of Madhekara Sai, ruler of Sambalpur.  Revolt for the throne  In 1827 ruler of Sambalpur , Raja Maharaja Sai died without an heir.The British Government installed his widow Rani Mohan Kumari as the ruler of the state.This was against the established norms where only the male rulers were acceptable to the population.As a result of which disturbance broke out and conflict increased between the recognised ruler and other claimants for the throne of Sambalpur. Surendra Sai being one of the descendants of the ruling clan , had the most prominent claim. In time Rani Mohan Kumari became unpopular. Her land revenue policy did not satisfy the Gond and Binjhal tribal zamindars and subjects who suspected loss of power to the British. The British authorities removed Rani Mohan Kumari from power and put Narayan Singh, a descendant of royal family but born of a low caste, as the king of Sambalpur. The British Government ignored the claim of Surendra Sai for succession. Rebellion broke out in the regime of Narayan Singh. Surendra Sai and his close associates, the Gond zamindars, created many disturbances. In an encounter with the British troops Surendra Sai, his brother Udyanta Sai and his uncle Balaram Singh were captured and sent to the Hazaribagh Jail where Balaram Singh died. King Narayan Singh died in 1849. By virtue of the Doctrine of Lapse, Lord Dalhousie annexed Sambalpur in 1849, as Narayan Singh had no male successor to succeed him. During the uprising of 1857 the sepoys set Surendra Sai and his brother Udyant Sai free. The resistance to British continued in Sambalpur under the leadership of Surendra Sai. He was supported by his brothers, sons, relatives and some Zamindars.  Uprising  Sai espoused the cause of the downtrodden tribal people in Sambalpur by promoting their language and culture in response to the higher castes and the British trying to exploit them to establish their political power in Sambalpur region. He began protesting against the British at the age of 18 in 1827. First time he was arrested in 1840 and sent to Hazaribagh Jail. He was broken out of Hazaribagh prison by the fighters during 1857 rebellion.He moved his operations to the hilly tracts of Odisha and continued his resistance until his surrender in 1862 . Before his surrender he spent 17 years in prison at Hazaribagh and after his final arrest served a term of 20 years including his detention of 19 years in the remote Asirgarh hill fort until he died. Attempts made to suppress him The Indian Revolution collapsed by the end of 1858 and law and order was restored by the British throughout India, but he continued his revolution. The military resources of the British were pulled up against him and the brilliant Generals like Major Forster, Capt. L. Smith and others earned credit in suppressing the rebellion elsewhere in India were brought to Sambalpur to stamp out his revolution. But all attempts failed and Surendra Sai succeeded in foiling strategy of the British for a long time. Major Forster, the reputed general who was vested with full military and civil power and the authorities of a Commissioner to suppress Surendra Sai and his followers, was removed by the British authority in 1861 after three years in Sambalpur. His successor Major Impey could not defeat Sai. The British seized the entire food-stock of the rebels, stopped all resources of the supply of food and other necessaries of life for them. Major Impey abandoned the idea of violent war and cautiously followed the policy of peace and good-will with the approval of the Government of India. Surendra Sai, one of the greatest revolutionaries in history, and a warrior who knew no defeat in his life surrendered with full faith in the honesty and integrity of the British Government. However, after the death of Impey, situations took a sudden change and the British administrators revived their hostility towards the great hero. Last days Sambalpur was brought under the jurisdiction of the newly created Central Provinces on 30 April 1862; Surendra Sai decided to surrender soon after that. However, he was said to have been disillusioned and the new setup indulged in reversal of the old liberal policy. The administrators found that the surrender of Surendra Sai did not bring the revolution to an end. They stepped down to organise a conspiracy and made sudden arrest of Surendra Sai and all his relations, friends and followers. Sai and six of his followers were subsequently detained in the Asirgarh hill fort. Sai spent the last part of his life in captivity. In 1884 on 23 May, Surendra Sai died in the Asirgarh fort, away from his native land. Sambalpur was one of the last patch of land to be occupied by the British Empire in India, not counting the Princely States. This was largely due to the efforts of Surendra Sai. He was a very good swordsman. People of the region affectionately called him as Bira (or \\"Veer\\" meaning courageous) Surendra Sai. Recognition Citizens of Sambalpur region feels Surendra Sai, should have been recorded with greater importance in the history of India's struggle for independence. According to them, he is yet to get the right place because of the state administration's ignorance and carelessness. Even historians and research scholars also have been blamed.

History Although the Bank of Ireland is not a central bank, it does have Sterling note-issuing rights in the United Kingdom. While Bank of Ireland is headquartered in Dublin, in the Republic of Ireland, it has operations in Northern Ireland, where it retains the legal right (dating from before the partition of the Ireland) to print its own banknotes. These are pound sterling notes and equal in value to Bank of England notes, and should not be confused with banknotes of the former Irish pound. The Bank of Ireland does not issue banknotes in the territory of the Republic of Ireland; until the Republic joined the euro in 1999, the only note-issuing bank there was the Central Bank of Ireland. Pre-decimal issues (1922–70) These issues were issued between 1922 and 1970. (PS catalogue numbers to be inserted) Decimal issues (1971–) A £5 Sterling note issued by Bank of Ireland in Northern Ireland These issues have been issued since the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland changed over to decimal currency on 15 February 1971. The obverse side of Bank of Ireland banknotes features the Bank of Ireland logo, below which is a line of heraldic shields each representing one of the six counties of Northern Ireland. Below this is a depiction of a seated Hibernia figure, surrounded by the Latin motto of the Bank, Bona Fides Reipublicae Stabilitas (\\"Good Faith is the Cornerstone of the State\\").

All of the denominations feature an illustration of the Old Bushmills Distillery on the reverse side. Prior to 2008, all Bank of Ireland notes featured an image of the Queen's University of Belfast on the reverse side. The current series of Bank of Ireland banknotes, in denominations of £5, £10, £20 and £50, were issued in 2013. All of the denominations feature an image of Hibernia, a line of shields representing the six counties of Northern Ireland and its logo on the front.

It ran in 1993 and was recorded for VHS (and later DVD) release at the Mayflower Theatre in Southampton. It was written by its stars, Rik Mayall as Richie Richard and Adrian Edmondson as Eddie Hitler.  Plot  Following a weekend lock-in in the lavatories of their local pub, Richie and Eddie return to their flat. After they unsuccessfully attempt to prepare breakfast the mail arrives, containing a letter and parcel for Richie. The letter is from the solicitors, which Eddie is left to dispose of, and the parcel contains a blow- up doll Richie ordered without his flatmate's knowledge. He bribes Eddie to leave the flat so he can be alone with his new friend Monica, unaware that Eddie has opened the solicitors' letter and discovered that following his uncle’s death, Richie is now owed £15,000, which he wishes to claim for himself. The second act opens with Richie having trouble with Monica; ultimately he accidentally attaches himself to the doll with superglue. Eddie returns intending to kill him to claim the £15,000. He helps remove the doll, then tries to poison Richie, albeit unsuccessfully. When Richie himself reads the solicitors' letter, he discovers that the £15,000 is actually a debt Richie owes, as his uncle never paid it during his lifetime. He resigns himself to suicide, but not before Eddie has tricked him into signing a marriage certificate (assuming that such a bond will entitle him to the money). The play ends with Eddie realising his mistake, and the pair apparently electrocute themselves to avoid paying the debt that they both now owe.  Trivia  An eight-minute section of the second act revolves around Ade teasing Rik for corpsing during his lines and Rik’s annoyance at Ade for receiving a large round of applause from the audience when he delivers his own lines in an overly-dramatic fashion. The line Ade recites is similar to one in television episode \\"Contest\\", when he talks about the futility of their conversation: \\"slime in this ear, slime in that ear\\". (Ade also remarks after his over-dramatic delivery, \\"Alan Rickman, eat your heart out!\\") During this sequence, Eddie claims he was born in Southampton (Ade was actually born in West Yorkshire). Rik tries to get the audience to stop laughing by telling them to pretend that they're watching Ben Elton. Near the end of this section, Rik manages to compose himself to deliver his line, to which Ade responds: \\"Fucking hell! A line from the play!\\" to great audience applause. During a fight, Ade accidentally hits Rik on the nose for real, causing a character break by Ade to say \\"You all right? I actually hit you on the nose then, didn't I?\\" There was a part where Monica was put under the sofa cushion when Eddie walked in and Richie sat on top and the leg popped out. This footage is now lost. After Richie attempted to kick Eddie in the crotch in response to an insult, a metal clanging sound is heard and Richie yells in pain and asks, \\"What have you got up there?\\" to which Eddie replies, \\"My testicles.\\" This scene is also from the Dangerous Brothers sketch \\"Crocodile Snogging.\\" Similarly, in the first act a visual gag wherein the pair spit out their teeth (having bitten into a Special-K brick) mirrors a similar gag in The Dangerous Brothers sketch \\"Exploding Politicians\\". There is a part in the second act where Ade hits Rik in the crotch with a Cricket Bat. Rik responds with \\"Ha! Ha! Missed both my legs!\\" This is a reference to The Young Ones episode Oil. The same joke is done again in the Bottom Live: The Big Number Two Tour. Rik Mayall is always the first cast member to both speak and appear on stage, shortly followed by Ade Edmondson.

Thompson married Millicent Maud Garnaut on 19 January 1909 and initially farmed near Keith in southeast South Australia before a drought in 1914 led to their return to Port Adelaide. In 1930 Thompson was elected President of the Carters and Drivers Union, (later the Transport Workers Union). His influence in the union movement led to his preselection as the Labor Party candidate for the safe Labor seat of Port Adelaide at the 1930 South Australian election. After the institution of single-member electorates in the South Australian House of Assembly in 1938, Thompson successfully transferred to Semaphore, serving there until 1946. He also served as president of the South Australian branch of the ALP from 1938 to 1940. In 1946 Thompson resigned from state parliament to successfully run as the Labor candidate for the federal seat of Hindmarsh, based on Port Adelaide, in the House of Representatives. After most of the northern portion of Hindmarsh was transferred to the new seat of Port Adelaide ahead of the 1949 election, Thompson transferred there and won easily.

Like Ocean Parkway on the south shore, and Lake Ontario State Parkway in Upstate New York, it was meant to provide both recreational use and a seaview, in this case a view of the Long Island Sound. The parkway was to include two new state parks in Lattingtown, and Eatons Neck.  Proposed routing  The Sound Shore Parkway was to begin at New York State Route 107 (NY 107) in downtown Glen Cove, running northeast into Lattingtown. From there, it would have continued east through Bayville, where it was to encounter an interchange with the Bayville-Rye Bridge, and then towards a causeway crossing Cold Spring Harbor between Centre Island and Lloyd Harbor's Lloyd Neck in Suffolk County. Here, the Sound Shore Parkway would have intersected the proposed Caumsett State Parkway (which was to lead to the Bethpage State Parkway) at Caumsett State Park, then would have crossed a second causeway over Huntington Bay into Eatons Neck. At this point, the parkway was to swing southeast toward the Village of Asharoken, where it was to run along the narrow land strip connecting Eatons Neck to the rest of Long Island on elevated fill along the sound-side of the beach. A similar proposal was considered for the Asharoken-Norwalk Bridge and its approach to the unbuilt Babylon-Northport Expressway. After passing along the coast in Fort Salonga, the Sound Shore Parkway was to have one of two eastern termini. The first proposed terminus was to be at Sunken Meadow State Park, along what is today Naples Avenue. Evidence of this can be found on the streetlights, which are designed for medians, but are used for the north side of the road and the parking fields along it instead. It was to connect with the existing Sunken Meadow State Parkway. The other one was an extension from Sunken Meadow State Park southeast into Caleb Smith State Park near Smithtown, which may have even included an interchange with the unbuilt Northern State Parkway extension's Jericho Turnpike Spur.Map of the proposed Sound Shore Parkway and connecting routes (Ray Ingersoll, Asharoken News)  History  Robert Moses added this parkway to his master plan in 1965, despite retiring from the Long Island State Park Commission two years earlier. However, by the 1970s fiscal difficulties and a political climate of rampant anti-highway sentiment thwarted all attempts at construction of the parkway, as was the case with many proposed roadways in the New York Tri-State area.

Plot Maya is an upcoming artist and college student. In the winter of her senior year, Maya attends a fraternity party and talks to a man named Jared. She accepts his invitation to dinner at a restaurant, then goes to his apartment, just to talk. They start to make out, but when Maya tells him to stop, Jared soon reveals his true self and brutally rapes her while uttering dehumanizing slurs in her ear. Over the next year, Maya's personality changes. She becomes quiet and withdrawn, graduating from college and taking a job at a clothing store. She disconnects herself from society and other familiar surroundings while struggling to break free of the resulting depression and addiction. At night, she's someone else: a beauty at the nightclub scene, dancing, seductive, sniffing cocaine. Maya later meets and seeks out the help of a DJ she meets at a club, named Adrian, whom she confides in. Maya becomes TA to a class Jared is in. One day she catches him cheating on an exam and threatens to report it, but instead uses it as an opportunity to lure Jared to her apartment. Jared willingly complies. She turns the tables on him by tying him to her bed and blindfolding him. She allows Adrian to rape Jared several times. Echoing what Jared said to Maya. In the final shot, as Maya watches Adrian brutally sodomize Jared, she seems slightly regretful and sheds a tear, seeming to indicate she is still not over her psychological issues. Cast * Rosario Dawson as Maya * Chad Faust as Jared * Marcus Patrick as Adrian * James A. Stephens as Professor Byron * Vanessa Ferlito as Bodega girl * Tracie Thoms as Denise * Alexie Gilmore as Seline * Jonathan Tchaikovsky as Tyler * Phoebe Strole as Innocent Girl * Nicole Vicius as Melanie * Scott Bailey as Upstairs guy Release Descent was released in two alternate cuts: a 105-minute uncut NC-17 rated version and a 95-minute R-rated version. The notable difference between the two is that the edited release omits about seven minutes of the second rape scene. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 35% based on reviews from 34 critics, with an average rating of 4.88/10. The website's consensus states: \\"Descent has the potential to make a statement about sexual violence, but falls flat by focusing on revenge rather than Rosario Dawson's emotional state.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 45 out of 100 based on reviews from 10 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Matt Zoller Seitz of The New York Times wrote: \\"Hard to watch but essential to see, Descent is at once realistic and rhetorical, and driven throughout by righteous anger that comes from an honest place.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2007 films Category:2007 LGBT-related films Category:2007 thriller drama films Category:American independent films Category:American films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:American thriller drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films about racism Category:Films about rape Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in New Jersey Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Rape and revenge films Category:2007 drama films ","title":"Descent (2007 film)"},{"id":"12709915","text":"Plagiolepis grassei is a species of ant in genus Plagiolepis.

He was the team's first quarterback. Lewis attended Lakewood High School in Lakewood, Ohio, and Staunton Military Academy in Virginia. He went to Duke University, where he played football as a back. He was a member of the Duke Blue Devils basketball team during the 1944–45 season. Lewis joined the Browns after graduating from college and spent his entire professional career with the team, playing primarily as a defensive back. He left the game after the 1951 season to concentrate on his insurance business. Lewis died in 2002. High school and college career Lewis grew up in Lakewood, Ohio and attended Lakewood High School. He played football and baseball, and was on a Lakewood basketball team that reached the state high school championship game in 1941. Lakewood's football team tied for the Lake Erie League championship in 1940 and 1941, when Lewis played left halfback. Lewis later transferred to Staunton Military Academy in Virginia, and in 1942 set a school scoring record in football with 14 touchdowns and 282 total points. After graduating, Lewis attended Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and played as a back on the school's Blue Devils football team. Lewis was Duke's second-string tailback as a sophomore in 1944, but he took over starting duties after the original first-stringer, Allen Elger, suffered a knee injury. Lewis, however, broke his elbow in the team's second game of the season against the University of Pennsylvania and had to sit out. He returned for a November game against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, and in a 34–0 victory on November 11 against the previously undefeated Wake Forest University he passed to receiver Clark Jones for a touchdown. Later in November, he passed to Harold Raether for the final touchdown in a 33–0 win over the University of North Carolina that gave Duke a second consecutive Southern Conference title and a spot in 1944's Sugar Bowl game against the University of Alabama. Lewis's passing helped Duke drive the ball 64 yards in the third quarter against Alabama, leading to a touchdown by All-American Tom Davis. Duke won 29–26. While football was Lewis's main sport, he also played basketball at Duke in the 1944–45 season. Professional career Lewis entered the U.S. Navy in 1945 and was a triple threat player and alternate quarterback for the Fleet City, California Bluejackets, a military team. The Bluejackets won the national service title that year. The Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL) selected Lewis with the 200th pick in the 1946 NFL Draft, but NFL commissioner Bert Bell ruled him ineligible under league rules. The Rams took Lewis thinking he was in the 1946 graduating class, but he had one more year of eligibility left as an athlete who entered college in 1943. The decision delayed Lewis's professional career for a year; in 1946 he signed with the Cleveland Browns of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Lewis started at quarterback for the Browns in their first three games in his first season, sharing duties with Otto Graham. After Graham took over as the starting quarterback, he became a defensive back who also returned punts and kickoffs. Lewis had five interceptions in his first season, when the Browns won the AAFC championship. Cleveland won the league championship in each of the ensuing three years before the AAFC dissolved and the Browns were absorbed into the more established NFL. The Browns beat the Rams to win the NFL championship in 1950, the team's first year in the league. The following year, Lewis returned a Bob Waterfield interception for 12 yards to the Cleveland 32-yard line during the Browns' 24–17 loss to the Rams in the NFL title game at the Los Angeles Coliseum. After the 1951 season, Lewis retired from the Browns to devote himself full-time to his insurance business. Later life and death In 1961–62, Lewis worked as a color commentator on Browns television broadcasts, and became vice president of insurance administration for the New York Yankees following the team's purchase by George Steinbrenner in 1973. He participated in the retired players division of the NFL players' golf tournament in Hollywood, Florida, in January 1961. He was inducted into the Greater Cleveland Sports Hall of Fame in 1976. Lewis died at the age of 79 in Tampa, Florida, following an extended illness in 2002.

Since its establishment during the South-East Asian theatre of World War II, No. 4 Squadron remains the only fighter squadron other than No. 3 Squadron IAF and No. 7 Squadron IAF to remain continuously in existence in the service of India.  Crest  The squadron adopted the 'Oorial head' as its emblem in December 1944 shortly before the Supreme Allied Commander of South East Asia Command Lord Louis Mountbatten visited the Squadron. The squadron crest consists of an Oorial head with the Ashoka on top and the squadron Motto 'Honour unto death' written below. When the squadron was formed at Peshawar the Afghan tribals used to conduct regular fights amongst the local mountain sheep known as the Oorial; a subspecies of the Urial, with a red coat. The Oorial is a wild horned mountain sheep, with a very lengthened sense of smell and sight. They have the ability to climb the steepest hillsides with remarkable ease, and are even wary and alert with significant strength and endurance. This animal has the ability of being a ferocious fighter that continues the fight to death rather than lose face and honour by turning away.No.4 Squadron, Bharat Rakshak  History  Indian Air Force MiG-21 Bison No. 4 Squadron of the Indian Air Force was first formed at Peshawar on 1 February 1942. Squadron Leader Habib Ullah 'Bulbul' Khan was its first commanding officer. The squadron was first equipped with Westland Lysander aircraft. The Second World War was in its third year, and Japanese forces were advancing towards India's eastern frontiers in the South- East Asian theatre of World War II. Within a few days, the squadron moved to Kohat where it would conduct missions over rebel-held areas of the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP). In 1942 the squadron moved on a detachment to Hyderabad, Sindh, to operate in support of the army during operations against the Hurs. The Indian Army was then dealing with the insurrection instigated by Faqir Ipi. During 1942, the squadron also operated Lysander detachments from Miranshah, a forward base in the North-West Frontier Province, for action against insurgent Pashtuns in North Waziristan. During this period the squadron operated its aircraft as bombers, besides carrying out its army air cooperation role, tactical reconnaissance and mail dropping missions. In June 1942, the squadron moved to the RAF station at Risalpur, near Rawalpindi, for converting onto the Hawker Hurricane fighter bombers. The conversion training was completed by August 1942 and No. 4 Squadron moved to Phaphamau to collect its branch new Hurricane IIC aircraft. In September 1943 the squadron moved from Phaphamau to Bhopal for air-to-air armament training. It was a disastrous move, as out of the 12 Hurricanes that took off, 3 crashed due to bad weather. On completion of armament training, the squadron moved to Sulur in November 1943 to practice for eventual operations in Burma. In February 1944, the squadron moved to Ranchi to carry out special low flying and ground attack training before moving to the front for its operational tour to Burma. In March 1944, the squadron moved to Fenny Airfield for operations against the Japanese occupation of Burma. The role of the squadron was to provide close air support to the British Fourteenth Army campaign. It was from Fenny Airfield that the squadron carried out its first operational sorties by providing fighter escort for Dakota transport aircraft, engaged in supply dropping missions for the Northern Combat Area Command in northern Burma. From August 1944 to January 1945, the squadron was based at Cox's Bazar to relieve No. 6 Squadron RAF and carried out close air support, interdiction and tactical reconnaissance operations. As the British Fourteenth Army pushed the Japanese forces southwards and moved towards Rangoon, No. 4 Squadron was constantly on the move and kept moving from one advanced landing ground to another. In December 1944, the Third Arakan Offensive began. The objective being to capture the Maya peninsula Akyab, Ramree island and to contain the Japanese in the Arkan and prevent them from crossing the Arakan Yoma and interfering with the advance of the British Fourteenth Army. No. 4 Squadron operated in direct support of the land forces and bombed Japanese strongpoints at Haparabyin and Ratheduang. During the landing of the Indian troops at Kangow, the squadron laid a smoke screen on the beach to enable safe landing of the troops. In recognition of the services rendered, the squadron's personnel were awarded one DSO, four DFCs and one MBE. It is at this time that the squadron adopted the Oorial head as its emblem. In April 1945, No. 4 Squadron was transferred back to India, ferrying back 9 Hurricanes for conversion onto Spitfire aircraft. By end of 14 May Spitfire Mk VIIIs were received and conversion training commenced in June. The squadron took part in the Victory over Japan Day parade at Madras by carrying out a flypast. In August 1945, the squadron was intimated of the possibility of the Oorials moving to Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. This was a singular honour for the Royal Indian Air Force and for No. 4 Squadron in particular. Short take off and landing procedures were practiced in preparation for the move to Japan as it was envisaged that the aircraft would be flown off the aircraft carrier onto onshore airfields. The Spitfire had pneumatically operated flaps which could be lowered fully for landing or raised fully up. The squadron devised a method of getting 15 degrees of flaps by inserting wooden wedges. On 8 April 1946, HMS Vengeance sailed with 22 aircraft of No. 4 Squadron, berthed at Singapore for refueling and set course for Iwakuni, a port of Kyushu island. The aircraft carrier finally arrived at Air Station Iwakuni and was anchored midstream. The decision taken earlier to fly the aircraft off the carrier was changed since excellent facilities were provided for off-loading and transporting the aircraft. The squadron was given a temporary base at Air Station Iwakuni until the rest of the personnel arrived. Shortly thereafter, the squadron moved to its permanent location at Miho on Sloustin Island. From here the squadron undertook various flying tasks which were mainly maritime patrol over the sea to ensure there was no subversive activity or smuggling. The stay at Miho was an interesting one and a lot of extracurricular functions were undertaken. The flight commanders Flight Lieutenant Nur Khan and Flight Lieutenant Shirpurkar evolved a pattern of formation flying depicting the letters \\"IAF\\". This being the first time such letters were seen in the sky. There were occasional exercises carried out to display the air strength to the local populations while large formations were flown over the big cities. The squadron returned to India in February 1947 and was located at Kanpur. They were here when the country achieved independence. In October 1947, the squadron was re-equipped with Hawker Tempest IIs and became the training squadron for the Indian Air Force.

It has been placed in a number of families, including a monotypic family, Platythelphusidae, as well as Potamidae and its current position in the Potamonautidae, and has also been treated as a subgenus of Potamonautes. It forms a monophyletic group, possibly nested within the genus Potamonautes, which would therefore be paraphyletic. The genus is the only evolutionary radiation of crabs to have occurred in a freshwater lake, and it occurred recently, probably since the Pliocene. This parallels the better known radiation of cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika. Only one other species of freshwater crab is found in Lake Tanganyika, Potamonautes platynotus. Taxonomic history The first freshwater crab to be described from Lake Tanganyika, by Alphonse Milne-Edwards in 1887, was considered so distinct from the other crabs known up to that time that it was placed in a new genus, as Platythelphusa armata. Twelve years later, a second species was described by W. A. Cunnington, leader of the third Tanganyika Expedition, and was also placed in a separate genus, as Limnothelphusa maculata. The same author later described a third species, Platythelphusa conculata, and eventually realised that all three belonged to the same genus, reducing Limnothelphusa to a taxonomic synonym. In 1952, Capart did not recognise the species P. conculcata, but added four new species, P. denticulata, P. echinata, P. polita and P. tuberculata. Since that time, P. conculcata has been restored, and two new species have been described, P. immaculata and P. praelongata. Distribution All nine species live in relatively shallow waters around the edge of Lake Tanganyika. While four countries border Lake Tanganyika (Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania and Zambia), only two species have been found in all four countries, P. armata and P. conculcata. One species, P. polita, has been found in all except Zambia; two (P. echinata and P. tuberculata) have been found in Burundi and Tanzania; one has been found in Tanzania and Zambia (P. maculata); one is only known from Zambia (P. praelongata) and two have only been seen in Tanzania (P. denticulata and P. immaculata). However, many of the species are poorly known, and their true distributions may be wider than is currently known. Species Fishermen on Lake Tanganyika Platythelphusa armata As the largest species in the genus (up to in carapace width), Platythelphusa armata is subject to small- scale fishery. Adults live at depths of , while juveniles live at depths of , and often inhabit discarded Neothauma tanganyicense shells. The species is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN. Platythelphusa conculcata Platythelphusa conculcata is found at depths of , and is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN. Platythelphusa denticulata Platythelphusa denticulata is known from few sites, all in Tanzania. Though it may have a low population, there is no evidence of a decline and it is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN. Platythelphusa echinata Platythelphusa echinata is found at depths of on the Tanzanian and Burundian shores of Lake Tanganyika. It lives where the substrate is rocky or sandy, and occasionally uses old Neothauma shells. Platythelphusa immaculata Platythelphusa immaculata is known from only 25 specimens, but is listed as Least Concern, because there are no apparent threats to its survival. Platythelphusa maculata Platythelphusa maculata lives on sand and rocks, and occasionally in Neothauma shells, at depths of , and is listed as Least Concern. Platythelphusa polita Platythelphusa polita lives on sand and rocks, and occasionally in Neothauma shells, at depths of , and is listed as Least Concern. Platythelphusa praelongata Platythelphusa praelongata lives at the greatest depth of any Platythelphusa species, the single known specimen having been collected at , around Mbita Island, and is listed as Data Deficient. Platythelphusa tuberculata Platythelphusa tuberculata has longer legs than the other species, and lives at the northern end of Lake Tanganyika, on muddy substrates. It has been found in the stomachs of fish including Chrysichthys brachynema and Bathybagrus stappersii (formerly Chrysichthys stappersii).

Because he was known as \\"Jackie Washington\\" early in his career, he is often confused with the Canadian Jackie Washington, (1919–2009), who was a blues and jazz performer (nor is either to be confused with the fictional, female Jackie Washington played by Jenifer Lewis in the 1999 mockumentary TV-film Jackie's Back). Jackie Washington Born Juán Cándido Washington y Landrón on June 2, 1938, in Puerto Rico, he grew up in the Boston, Massachusetts neighborhood of Roxbury. He studied at Emerson College as a Theater Arts major.Robert Taylor. \\"He Sings What He Feels.\\" Boston Herald, July 29, 1963, p. A23. As part of the Cambridge/Boston folk music scene in the early and mid-1960s, he released four albums on Vanguard—Jackie Washington (1962), Jackie Washington/2 (1963), Jackie Washington at Club 47 (1965), and Morning Song (1967); this last LP consisted entirely of original compositions and was his first with a band. [None of his albums has been released on CD but individual songs have appeared on anthologies. His sole single, for instance, \\"Why Won't They Let Me Be?\\" (1966), is included in Northern Soul's Classiest Rarities 2 (Kent, 2005).] The live album, Jackie Washington at Club 47, featuring a cover collage by Eric Von Schmidt, is most representative of his act as he had a lot to say between numbers—not only setting up the contexts of the songs but also relating personal anecdotes; indeed, he could easily have worked as a stand-up comedian, and he fully appreciated the early records of Bill Cosby (nowadays, his main man comedically is Chris Rock). Vanguard, however, tried to groom him as a male counterpart to Joan Baez. He now characterizes himself as primarily a storyteller. While coming home in the early hours of December 3, 1962, Washington was arrested by the Boston Police: what happened was the subject of dispute, with the police saying that when they questioned him, Washington assaulted one of the officers \\"Jury is Picked to Try Singer,\\" Boston Herald, February 5, 1963, p. 25. and Washington asserting that he was stopped, and subsequently beaten by two officers, for no reason other than his race.\\"Begin Probe of Brutality by Police.\\" Boston Herald, December 15, 1962, p. 6. The case resulted in a cause célèbre which Washington's supporters believed had exposed racism in the Boston police force.Hertzberg, Hendrik, The Harvard Crimson, 11 Jan 1963. Washington was ultimately acquitted of all charges, in a verdict that took the jury only five hours to reach.\\"Acquital Won by Folk Singer.\\" Boston Herald, February 8, 1963, p. 9. In the summer of 1964 he participated in Freedom Schools conducted in the South, and three of his performances from his live album are included in the double-CD anthology Freedom Is A Constant Struggle (Songs of the Mississippi Civil Rights Movement) (1994). At one point he was Dr. Martin Luther King's personal assistant in Mississippi.Tom Keyser, Albany Times Union, 21 Jan 2010.] \\"Esta Navidad\\" from his first album is included in the 1995 Vanguard compilation A Folksinger's Christmas. His version of the traditional English nonsense song \\"Nottamun Town\\" was the tune and arrangement used by Bob Dylan as the basis for \\"Masters of War\\", . [Clinton Heylin in Revolution In the Air (2009) rejects this idea as \\"patently absurd\\" (p. 116), but Jackie Washington, including \\"Nottamun Town\\", was released in December 1962, and The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, with \\"Masters of War\\", was released 27 May 1963; Dylan loved Washington's rendition, repeatedly requested he perform it, and asked Vanguard Records to give him a copy of Washington's debut album; Jean Ritchie, whose version Heylin and others give as Dylan's source, sings the song in a minor key but plays the accompaniment in major chords. Washington reset the melody to minor chords, and in the process changed it somewhat—Dylan liked this version and used it as the model for \\"Masters of War.\\"] Washington's role in the song's transmission is acknowledged in Bob Dylan by Greil Marcus: Writings 1968–2010 (Public Affairs, 2010, p. 410). Washington taught Joan Baez \\"There But For Fortune\\" by Phil Ochs, which provided Baez with her first appearance on the singles chart. (You can tell she learned it from him because he had made a lyric change; where Ochs had written \\"whose face is growing pale\\", Jackie, being black, had substituted \\"whose life has grown stale\\"—which is how Baez sings it.) Originally managed by Manny Greenhill, Joan Baez's manager, Washington later did his own bookings. He is currently managed by Mitch Greenhill, (Manny's son), through Folklore Productions. On 25 July 1968 Jackie was master of ceremonies for a political rally supporting anti-Vietnam War presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy held at the Red Sox' Fenway Park. As the first performer to headline the Caffè Lena in Saratoga Springs, New York, in 1960, Jackie was invited back 22 January 2010 to perform as part of an ongoing celebration of the club's 50th anniversary, with Bill Staines as the opening act.Tom Keyser, Albany Times Union, 21 Jan 2010. On 1 Feb 2013 he returned to Club Passim (formerly Club 47) in Cambridge, Mass. His first album in 45 years, Curbside Cotillion, was released in 2012, his first recording as Jack Landrón. He is featured in the documentary For the Love of the Music: the Club 47 Folk Revival (2013). On 19 Dec 2014 Landrón spoke at the Cambridge Forum in Harvard Square, Massachusetts, about his experiences during Freedom Summer's voter registration drive in Mississippi in 1964. This appearance can be viewed on YouTube. Actor He relocated to Manhattan to pursue acting under the name of Jack Landrón. One of his earliest performances was in the 1966 National Educational Television production of Tennessee Williams' one-act play Ten Blocks on the Camino Real (1948), starring Lotte Lenya and Martin Sheen; this has been available on DVD. He has done extensive work in commercials and continues to compose. Landrón is a member of the board of the New York Screen Actors' Guild. In the fall of 2007 he appeared in Maxwell Anderson’s Night Over Taos, directed by Estelle Parsons.. In 2009 he relocated to West Hollywood, Los Angeles to pursue work in television and film.Tom Keyser, Albany Times Union, 21 Jan 2010. He currently lives in Los Angeles' Chinatown.

It is endemic to Frégate Island in the Seychelles. It grows to be about 20–30 mm long and has a hard, rounded abdomen covered with tubercles. There appears to be no sexual dimorphism. They are largely arboreal, sheltering under the bark of trees, beneath the crooks of branches, and within bushes during the day. They are believed to be nocturnal, descending to the forest floor at night, though never travelling far. This behaviour may help them to avoid predators such as the Wright's Skink and the Seychelles magpie-robin. When in danger, chemicals will secrete from the defensive glands in the posterior of the beetle, which have a musky smell and stains the skin purple. In captivity they have been noted to eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, bark, fungus and cat food. There are a few captive populations, taken for conservation reasons, the largest being at London zoo. These populations are the descendants of two small populations taken from the wild several years apart. It is quite possible that it previously lived on other islands in the Seychelles, and it has been suggested that it could be reintroduced to other islands to reduce its vulnerability. In captivity they have been recorded to live for up to seven years. ReferencesSources *ARKive Images *Nature Seychelles 2005. Giant Tenebrionid Beetle. Downloaded on 10 October 2009.

Captured after being badly wounded, he was executed at Edinburgh on 26 June 1685. His speech from the scaffold included the statement \\"none comes into the world with a saddle on his back, neither any booted and spurred to ride him.\\" These words were quoted during the US Constitutional Convention in 1787, and by Thomas Jefferson shortly before his death in 1826. Biography Little is known of Rumbold's background, except that he was born in 1622, and his family came from Hertfordshire, possibly Royston. He had a brother, William, who took part in Monmouth's Rebellion but was pardoned in 1688. Dismissed from the army following The Restoration in 1660, he married a widow who owned a Malting business based at Rye House, Hertfordshire near Hoddesdon. There is no record of any children from this marriage. Career Rumbold fought throughout the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, including Dunbar in September 1650 He joined the Parliamentarian army in 1642 and served throughout the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, joining the New Model Army when it was set up in 1645. At some point, Rumbold lost an eye, though it is unclear if this was a battle injury, and as a result was known to his friends as Hannibal. Rumbold was a Baptist, a sect particularly prominent in the New Model, and closely associated with the radical Leveller movement. He claimed to have been present at the execution of Charles I, and in February 1649 was one of those who petitioned for Agitators to be re-appointed to the Army Council. Oliver Cromwell viewed the Agitators with great hostility, especially after their role in organising the so-called Leveller mutinies in April and May. Rumbold seems to have withdrawn from the group, as his name does not appear on the version of the petition printed by the Levellers, and was rewarded with a commission. During the Third English Civil War, he fought at the battles of Dunbar and Worcester; when it ended in 1651, he was a Lieutenant in Cromwell's Regiment of Horse. He was dismissed from the army with the rank of captain at the 1660 Restoration. Rumbold was closely involved in attempts to exclude the Catholic James from the throne Rumbold remained politically active after the Restoration, and was prominent within radical circles, many of whom were also Baptists and New Model veterans. They included former Agitators Abraham Holmes and John Harris, who were also present at Charles' execution, Rumbold's cousin John Gladman, and his brother William. This group was closely involved in the 1679 to 1681 campaign to exclude the Catholic James from succeeding his brother Charles II. They helped organise the 1680 'Great Petition' demanding the recall of Parliament, signed by 18,000 people, including John Ayloffe, Richard Nelthorpe and Robert Ferguson. All of the above were implicated in the Rye House Plot. Named after Rumbold's home, the plan was to ambush Charles and his brother as they returned to London from Newmarket in March 1683. Rumbold was reportedly given the task of killing Charles, although there is considerable debate as to how serious it was, or what its objectives were. In his speech from the scaffold in 1685, Rumbold denied any intention of murdering the king, but after warrants for his arrest were issued in June, he escaped to the Dutch Republic. Here he joined other exiled opponents of the Stuarts. The most prominent were Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll, convicted of treason in 1681, and Charles' illegitimate son, James Scott, Duke of Monmouth, exiled for his involvement in the Rye House Plot. Preparations for a rising became more urgent with the accession of James after the death of Charles in February 1685, and the two agreed to work together. To ensure co-ordination, a leading Scots exile, Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun accompanied Monmouth, while Rumbold and Ayloffe went with Argyll. Playing card showing John Ayloffe, also executed for his role in Argyll's Rising Unfortunately, Argyll's Rising failed to attract significant support, and was fatally compromised by divisions among the rebel leadership, Rumbold being one of the few to emerge with any credit. After Argyll was captured on 18 June, the others were ordered to disperse; intercepted by militia on the night of 20/21 June near Lesmahagow, Rumbold killed one assailant, wounded another two, and was captured only when his horse was shot from under him. Brought to Edinburgh seriously wounded, he was tried, convicted of treason on 26th and executed the same day, allegedly to ensure he did not die of his wounds first. Ayloffe was executed later that year in London along with Nelthorpe, who served with Monmouth, as did William Rumbold, pardoned in 1688 for his participation. Rumbold made his own defiant declaration on the scaffold: This echoed words published thirty-seven years earlier by Harris in Mecurius Militaris; 'Children of kings are born with crowns upon their heads, and the people with saddles upon their backs.' They would be quoted again in 1787 during discussions on the definition of treason at the Convention that drew up the Constitution of the United States. Ten days before his death, Thomas Jefferson also borrowed from Rumbold's speech in his letter of 24 June, 1826 to the Mayor of Washington, D.C.. He wrote, \\"...All eyes are opened or opening to the rights of man. The general spread of the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth, that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few, booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately by the grace of God.\\" ReferencesSources    * * Category:1622 births Category:1685 deaths Category:Roundheads Category:English army officers Category:People of the Rye House Plot Category:Executed military personnel Category:Executed English people Category:17th-century executions by Scotland ","title":"Richard Rumbold"},{"id":"12710112","text":"Polyergus breviceps is a species of ant endemic to the United States. It is a social parasite of other ants, namely of Formica gnava but also of Formica occulta and Formica argentea. Polyergus is an inquiline parasite, having lost its ability to take care of its young and themselves. \\"The workers do not forage for food, feed the young or the queen, or even clean up their own nest\\". To survive, Polyergus workers raid Formica nests to steal the pupae—which, once hatched, become workers of the mixed nest. This sort of relationship is not unique, of the approximately 8,800 species of ants, at least 200 have evolved some form of symbiotic relationship with one another. What makes Polyergus special is the way a newly mated queen can, all by herself, take over a Formica nest and start a new colony. Slave raids and colony takeovers Polyergus workers emerge from their nest (a mixed nest where Formica workers are already enslaved) and forage for a suitable raid target. If they find one, the scouts return to the nest, rally the other Polyergus, and head out in a raiding column. If the new target is a Formica nest, the Polyergus incite a \\"panic-flee\\" response from the Formica by releasing formic acid and take the Formica pupae back to their nest as slaves. Occasionally, a new queen goes on a raiding column with the other Polyergus. She then, after mating, leaves the column and forages for a suitable Formica nest. Howard Topoff evaluated how the queen takes over a colony. After finding a Formica nest, she finds an entrance and is immediately attacked by Formica workers. The queen responds by biting with her sharp mandibles and releasing a pheromone from her enlarged Dufour's gland that, unlike many other parasitic ants, has a pacifying effect. The queen quickly searches for and locates the Formica queen and, with her adapted mandibles, proceeds to bite and lick various parts of the Formica queen for an average of 25 minutes. \\"Within seconds of the host queen's death, the nest undergoes a most remarkable transformation\\". The Formica workers cease to be aggressive to the intruder and start to groom the Polyergus queen as if it were their own. The takeover now complete, the Polyergus queen gains not only a nest, but a worker caste as well. She then lays her eggs and the cycle continues. Mechanisms Nearly all slave-making ants, including Polyergus, have mandibular adaptations that help them attack others. Specific to Polyergus, when the queen first enters a Formica nest she releases a pheromone from her enlarged Dufour’s gland. Topoff did experiments to show that this pheromone has an important facilitative effect in colony usurpation; it reduces the aggression of the defending Formica workers. The researchers took the Dufour’s, pygidial, and poison glands from freshly mated Polyergus queens, using water as a negative control. These were crushed in distilled water to make a solution containing their extracts. Because it was impossible to prevent a Polyergus queen from secreting her own pheromones during a live encounter, they used the harvester ant Pogonomyrmex occidentalis (naturally attacked by Formica) as the subject. These ants were dipped in the above solutions, one ant/solution/test at a time, and placed in a petri dish with three Formica occulta \\"attackers\\". They were observed for three minutes to see for how long the Pogonomyrmex was attacked. The results were as follows: \\"the mean duration of aggression by the Dufour’s gland treatment was 53.3 seconds...The mean duration of aggression for the water, pygidial gland, and poison gland controls were: 143.5 seconds, and 137.2 seconds and 132.2 seconds respectively\\". Apparently, at some time, Polyergus queens evolved the capacity to passively facilitate colony takeovers. Topoff and Ellen Zimmerli also did experiments to prove that the Polyergus queen \\"tricks\\" the Formica colony by obtaining chemicals from the Formica queen in the process of killing her. In one test, the Formica queen was killed (by flash freezing then thawing) prior to Polyergus contact. Even though it was already dead, the Polyergus queen bit, stabbed, and licked the queen just as if it were alive: and the Polyergus was consequently accepted by the colony. Another test showed that if no Formica queen was present, then Polyergus had little chance of a successful takeover. Clearly, the Formica queen is providing some sort of chemical(s) to the Polyergus queen, however unintentionally. That takeover can occur even if the host queen is dead, but not if she is not present, proves that chemical absorption is important. The Polyergus queen needs only kill one host queen to be accepted. If the colony was polygynistic, the Polyergus queen can take her time finding the other queens. \\"Hour by hour, day by day, she methodically locates and kills every Formica queen, sometimes taking several weeks to clear out all remnants of opposition\\". Evolution Considerable work has been published on the evolution of ant dulosis and almost all of it has at least some empirical evidence to defend its positions. Notably, that nearly all raiding ant species have is an adaptation of their mandibles that make them big or piercing or both. It makes sense that the very thing that helps an ant be a better raider makes that same ant depend on others. The parasite loses the use of its mandibles for actual work. On this and other evidence, some propose that predation is the precursor to slavery. It has also been suggested that colony multiplication by adoption and budding followed by temporary parasitism can lead to dulosis. While observations indicate that colony multiplication can lead to temporary parasitism, it is apparently very questionable that temporary parasitism leads to dulosis. In addition, about 100 years ago, Carlo Emery observed that, \\"The slave-making temporarily and permanently parasitic ants originate from closely related forms which serve them as host.\\" Jurgen Heinze did a series of experiments that prove this observation, known today as Emery's Rule. Rather than just relying solely on morphological cues, he used enzyme gel electrophoresis assays to create a detailed phylogenetic picture of host and parasite connections. His experimental results support a loose version of Emery’s rule. On one end of the spectrum, they saw near identical electromorphs between species in most host and parasite pairs studied. However, it also appears that at least one example does not support Emery’s rule in that (Leptothorax paraxenus) differed from its host in several electromorphs. The selective forces involved in the evolution of social parasitism are not fully understood, and it is unlikely that one model fits all relationships. \\"Any hypothesis explaining the evolution of slavery in Polyergus must account both for the origin of group raiding with brood capture, and for non-independent colony foundation by queens\\". Topoff gives an adequate hypothesis to the evolution of Polyergus by integrating three processes: queen takeover, olfactory imprinting, and territorial fighting. Here are his main points. A free-living ancestor of Polyergus, that is a scavenger, would band together with others for intraspecific contest. Occasionally a queen invaded colonies of Formica. Initially the queen drove off the Formica queen and workers and appropriated the Formica pupae (he gives as example the queens of Formica wheeleri that do this now). The killing of the Formica queen and adoption by the workers evolved from this. His previous work (which was presented earlier) shows what would have evolved for adaptation to occur: \\"(1) sharp mandibles for killing the Formica queen, (2) a pheromone that reduces aggression from resident workers, (3) a tendency to hold onto the dead Formica queen long enough to absorb her odors...\\". The next step was olfactory imprinting between the two species, a consequence of living one’s life from start to finish in the presence of both species. Polyergus’ ancestor then forages and encounters a colony of the same species. Again, they recruit nestmates to a territorial raid. In a brilliant insight, Topoff suggest this trait explains the raiding behavior. The Polyergus worker, raised by Formica as conspecifics, \\"identifies individual of Formica as belonging to its own species, another territorial raid is incited. Thus from the standpoint of Polyergus... slave raids are equivalent to territorial raids\\". The captured brood is imprinted as well and they become workers in the original nest. As time went on \\"Our ancestral Polyergus could easily slide in the direction of facultative parasitism\\". Eventually, Polyergus ancestors lost the ability to take care of themselves and become the inquiline Polyergus we see today.

It is an obligatory social parasite, unable to feed itself or look after its brood and reliant on ants of another species of the genus Formica to undertake these tasks. Parasitic ants are known as \\"dulotics\\" (from the Greek δοῦλος doulos, meaning a slave) and the ants they parasitise are known as \\"hosts\\". Description P. lucidus is part of a group of six orange-red or dark-red species of ants, mostly from eastern North America, that have long, often dark-coloured appendages and few hairs on the dorsal surface of the gaster. The worker is long and has a head longer than it is wide, crowned with about a dozen short setae (bristles). It is red with the legs and the tip of the gaster often being tinged with brown. The specific name lucidus means \\"shiny\\" and this ant is the shiniest in the group and has a glossy mesonotum and gaster, and a moderately shiny head. Behaviour P. lucidus raiding a F. incerta nest P. lucidus is incapable of feeding itself or rearing its young without assistance. Like other members of its genus, it raids the nests of another species of ants and carries off the pupae to be reared in the dulotic nest where, when they emerge, they function as workers. In the case of P. lucidus, the host species is Formica incerta, and reports of Formica pallidefulva and Formica schaufussi in dulotic nests of P. lucidus, e.g., result from misidentifications, corrected in Trager's work. Colonies of P. lucidus and its close relatives only raid nests of the slave species already present in the dulotic nest, an early clue that these host specialists might, in fact, be separate species. On the odd occasion when the nest of a different ant species was raided, the pupae brought back to the dulotic nest were likely to be consumed. In the past, it was suggested that worker dulotics obtain their preferences by imprinting, but it is now deemed more likely the host preference is an innate, evolved trait of each species. Distribution P. lucidus is native to the eastern United States and occurs almost everywhere that its host species is found. Its range extends from New England and Wisconsin southwards to the Carolinas and Missouri, but it is absent from Kansas and Nebraska. It is generally found in prairies, pastures, and old fields.

(с.209–210) Description The queen and workers of this slave-maker ant species are black or dark brown in color (unlike the more western species) generally matching the host species in color. Behavior Like other species of the genus, it is a parasite to host Formica ant species. The colony begins when a young queen leaves her parent colony and mates. The queen then searches for a suitable host colony. When the P. samurai queen invades the host Formica japonica colony, she kills the resident Formica queen or queens and adopts the colony's scent. She then takes the role as queen, laying eggs destined to become her first \\"slave\\"-makers. When the original Formica work force is starting to die out, the new workers of the colony begin to search for other colonies of the Formica to raid. Once a colony is located, workers will gather above the nest before leaving in a large group to the nest. Once workers reach the host Formica nest they rush in and attempt to steal as many large larvae and pupae as possible before returning to the nest with them, destined to become workers for the P. samurai colony. Such raids never kill the queen of suitable host Formica species, so the colony can be raided repeatedly over the summer.

Early 16th century Ottoman mirror armour (krug), a distinctively Ottoman protection consisting of large round steel plates in the front and back connected by mail. Mirror armour (, , meaning \\"mirror\\"; , , meaning \\"protect-heart mirror\\"), sometimes referred to as disc armour or as ' or ' ( meaning \\"four mirrors\\"; whence , ), was a type of cuirass used mainly in Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe; including Indian, Persia, Tibet, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire. It literally translates to \\"four mirrors\\" which is a reflection of how these pieces looked, which resembles four (sometimes more) metal discs or rectangular armour plates. Mirror armor was used in some cultures up to the 20th century. Description and history \\"Mirror armour\\" is a type of partial plate armour which was developed initially from round metal mirrors (a kind of rondel) worn over other armour (usually over mail) as enforcement. Metal mirrors in this armour were considered as protection from not only cold steel and arrows, but also supernatural influence. It was believed that mirrors could reflect the evil eye, so they were polished and worn over other armour. Early mirror armour consisted of a round mirror attached to the body with a few leather laces (similar to the Roman phaelerae). In Europe, they were known as (Greek) or (Armenian) and were popular with various Bronze Age civilisations, as well as the Central Asian tribes such as the Saka and Yuezhi, and also among the Sasanians. Late mirror armour took the form of a mirror cuirass, helmet, greaves, and bracers worn with mail. There were two alternative constructions of mirror cuirass: * with discs – two large round mirrors surrounded by smaller mirror plates, such as the Klivanion. * without discs – typically having four mirror plates – frontplate, backplate, and two sideplates joined by hinges or laces. Early types of this armour were known among the Celtiberians,War & Society in the Celtiberian World, M. Almagro-Gorbea & A. Lorrio (2008) by the Romans, in the Middle East, Central Asia, India, Russia, Siberia (where it was worn by Siberian natives before the Russian conquest), Mongolia, Indochina and China (including Tibet too). Later types of this armour were known in the Middle East, Central Asia, India, and Russia. The mirror cuirass with discs was popular in Turkey and Russia, while that without discs was popular in Persia, Central Asia and India. In India, there was a popular form of brigandine with a few mirror plates riveted to it. According to Bobrov,Леонид Бобров \\"Защитное вооружение среднеазиатского воина эпохи позднего средневековья\\" (Leonid Bobrov \\"Panoply of a Late Medieval Central Asian Warrior\\") illustrations of some kinds of mirror armour round metal mirrors worn by Mongolian warriors as armour reinforcement are shown in Persian miniatures of 13c. This is verified by archaeological finds in Central Asia and the Far East. This kind of armour prevailed in Central Asia during 15–17c, and could be worn over any armour including brigandines, lamellar armour, chainmail and even plated mail. In 16c in Persia, mirror plates became much larger and changed their shape to rectangular in order to improve body protection. This improved mirror armour gradually spread during 16–17c to Central Asia and North India. Further improvements were made during the 1640s when mirror plates evolved into mirror cuirass, which sometimes had additional mirror plates used as pauldrons for protection of the shoulder laces. Besides separate mirror plates laced as reinforcement to other armours there were small mirrors that were sewn or riveted to brigandine. Brigandines with such integral reinforcements were very popular at the end of the 15th century, but their use had practically been abandoned by the end of the 17th century. Many modern army ballistic vests resemble the \\"Chahar-Aine\\" layout with basic soft anti-fragmentation armour (analogue of chain mail) covering a large area, and two, four or even more bulletproof plates (\\"mirrors\\") worn above it, thus combining weight saving and freedom of movement with high level of protection of vital areas. Ottoman 15th to 16th century mirror armour is commonly referred to as \\"Krug\\", while the name for the same type of armour in Russia is (), and the modern technical term is (), from the Russian () – \\"mirror\\"; and () – \\"armour\\".
