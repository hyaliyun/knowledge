The band was formed in 2006 by Oliver Fogwell, Jeff Ritchie and Matt Heywood. The band would go through several guitarists and keyboardists from 2007 before being joined by Bizz and Zot on guitars and drums respectively. Our Last Enemy has worked and played with bands that include Fear Factory, Static X, Dope, Hanzel und Gretyl, SOiL, Genitorturers, Mnemic, God Forbid, and Fozzy.  History = Early years and ‚Ä¶Is Death, 2006‚Äì2009  Our Last Enemy was formed in 2006 through the dissolution of the members previous bands. According to an interview with vocalist Oliver Fogwell, during this period, the band wrote and jammed for close to six months before playing their first show. During 2008, Our Last Enemy entered the studio to record the EP ‚Ä¶Is Death. The EP is a play on the meaning of the band's name, 'our last enemy is death'. It is a six-song EP containing three original songs (\\"10,000 Headless Horses\\", \\"Decoy\\" and \\"Cold & Alone\\") and also features three remixes of \\"10,000 Headless Horses\\". Bassist Matt Heywood stated that the last copy of ‚Ä¶Is Death was given to Vas Kallas of Hanzel und Gretyl. Our Last Enemy toured the east coast of Australia extensively during this time, solidifying their name in cities outside of their native home of Sydney.  Fallen Empires, 2009‚Äì2013  During this period, it was announced that Our Last Enemy would be relocating from Sydney to Los Angeles for three months to record their debut album with producer Christian Olde Wolbers of Fear Factory fame (God Forbid, Threat Signal, Mnemic). While recording in Los Angeles the band also lived with producer Christian Olde Wolbers. Also during this period, Our Last Enemy became the first Australian band to work with publicist Kelli Wright. They were signed to Australian heavy metal label Riot! Entertainment with distribution through Warner Music Group, and Bizz of American industrial band Genitorturers joined as guitarist. The band's next release, Fallen Empires, took close to three months to record, and was recorded at the famed Temple Studios which is co-owned by B-Real of Cypress Hill and Raymond Herrera of Fear Factory. The album was distributed by Warner Music in Australia. To coincide with the release of Fallen Empires, Our Last Enemy embarked on a tour of Australia and New Zealand. Fallen Empires was released in Australia in October 2010 through Riot!/Warner in Australia, and has received a favorable response from critics, noting the sound quality and the musical range of the band. Upon its digital release in April 2011, the album debuted at No. 1 on the Australia iTunes Metal Charts. The band released a video clip for the song \\"10,000 Headless Horses\\" in early May 2011, shot by The Blackley Brothers. The band self-released an EP called Wolves of P√©rigord on 26 March 2012, which debuted at No. 2 on the Australia iTunes Metal Charts, just missing out on a second No. 1 to the new Meshuggah album released the same week. The band followed this up by expanding on its interest in electronic music and previous experiments with remixes by releasing the album Engineering the Enemy. The album features remixes of their songs by artists such as Mortiis, Angel (Dope/Team Cybergeist), Travis Neal (Divine Heresy), Dismantled, Angelspit, The Berzerker, and Shiv-r (Metropolis Records). The album debuted at No. 2 on the Australian iTunes Metal Charts making it a third straight top 3 release for the band.  Since 2014  On 11 March 2014, the album Pariah was released.

After some twenty years of medical work, which included organizing the Hsiang-Ya Medical College, which still functions in Changsha today, Hume resigned over the issue of turning control over to Chinese during the anti-imperialist campaigns of 1925‚Äì1927. He died in Wallingford, Connecticut, February 8, 1957. The Humes had five children: Theodore Carswell (1904‚Äì1943); Charlotte Elizabeth Hume Freeman (1906‚Äì1994); Margery (1909‚Äì1911); Edward Welch (1913‚Äì1915); and Kathrina Joy Hume Falk (1917‚Äì1986). Lotta Hume (1876‚Äì1976) died on February 17, 1976, in La Jolla, California.\\"Biographical Sketch,\\" Hume Papers, Yale Library Biography Hume was born in Ahmednagar, India, and educated there by his father, whose father before him had also worked as a teacher and missionary. He received his B.A. from Yale College (1897) and his M.D. from Johns Hopkins Medical School (1901). After marriage to Charlotte (\\"Lotta\\") Carswell in 1903, the couple returned to India. From 1903‚Äì1905 Hume was in Bombay as an Acting Assistant Surgeon in the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service to monitor the Plague outbreak that had started in 1896. When the newly established Yale-in-China Mission, as it was then called, recruited the couple in 1906, they went to work in Changsha, Hunan. Hume described the allure of China, where there were not the government medical colleges there had been in India, as allowing him to achieve his ambitions in medical training. He represented a new generation of missionaries who thought in different terms from the earlier emphasis on purely evangelical work. \\"Get hold of the students, of the educated men ‚Äì and China will be won.\\" Although he insisted on using only the scientific medicine he had learned at Johns Hopkins, Hume assumed that Chinese would be won to Western ways and Christian religion only if he learned and respected Chinese culture.\\"Edward Hume: Yale for China,\\" in Jonathan D. Spence, To Change China; Western Advisers in China, 1620-1960 (Boston: Little Brown, 1969), 164-66 . Hume recruited Chinese medical co- workers, raised funds, negotiated agreements, and laid the groundwork for the Yale-in-China hospital which opened in 1917. He served as senior physician, dean of Hunan Medical College, professor of medicine, and liaison with Chinese medical boards and professional journals. His aim was to develop educational and medical work \\"under the strongest Christian influence and under the highest intellectual and scientific standards of teaching and research.\\" In 1926, as other foreigners in China condemned the anti-foreign campaigns of the rising Nationalist Party, Hume declared his understanding of their attitudes. \\"No one can give effective service to China today, whom the Chinese do not welcome. We are guests here.\\" When Yali students took to the streets in violent protest of the May Thirtieth Incident of 1925, however, Hume found it impossible to simultaneously placate them, reassure his Chinese and American colleagues, and satisfy the trustees in New Haven. He came to doubt the worth of the American staff and even of the Yali Bachelors, recent Yale graduates who came to Changsha to teach English. When the Trustees rejected his proposal that the medical school and college be turned over to the Chinese, he offered his resignation.\\"Edward Hume: Yale for China,\\" in Jonathan D. Spence, To Change China; Western Advisers in China, 1620-1960 (Boston: Little Brown, 1969), pp. 177-82. In the years that followed, Hume became director and executive vice-president of the New York Post-Graduate Medical School and Hospital. From 1934 to 1937 he conducted a survey of medical facilities for the Chinese National Health Administration and went on to carry out such a survey in India. Hume also helped to organize the Christian Medical Council for Overseas Work, of which he was secretary from 1938 to 1946. He participated or served as an officer in a number of organizations, such as Yale-in-China (Trustee, 1927‚Äì1954, President 1934‚Äì1936, and Vice-President, 1955‚Äì1957); the Associated Boards for Christian Colleges in China; and the American Council of the Institute of Pacific Relations.\\"Biographical Sketch,\\" Hume Papers, Yale Library Writings *Edward H.
