Biography  Norbert Busè was raised in Erbach im Odenwald, Germany. Until 1993 he worked as an editor at the German public-service broadcaster ZDF and also appeared on air as the presenter of the consumer-advice programme KONTAKTE. Since 1991 he has been working on film projects and questions of media education. In 1993, he moved to Berlin and directed documentary films alongside his own experimental short films.  Work  Focus points for his work so far have been cultural, with a particular emphasis on music. The first of his films shot for ZDF, Auf Teufel komm raus [Come Hell or High Water], considers the meaning of music in adolescent development, by example of the New Wave scene. In 2003 Busè began, in co-operation with UNESCO, ZDF and 3sat, the production of the 12-piece film project Meisterwerke der Menschheit [Mankind's Masterpieces]. The films showed the humanity's intangible cultural heritage and the threat under which even music finds itself. AVA - Die Stimme meiner Mutter [AVA- The Voice of my Mother], a 90-minute music documentary film, was Busè’s first feature-length film about the legacy and potential loss of Russian folk songs. He produced over 30 episodes of the Arte Lounge programme, which at first broadcast classical music from a Berlin club. In 2010 he organised a choral festival in South Africa for the European cultural broadcaster Arte, the culmination of which was a joint performance from all the choirs involved of the freedom song ‘Ukuthula’. Films he produced about musicians such as Karlheinz Stockhausen, John Cage, Elvis Presley, Sergiu Celibidache and Richard Strauss have also attracted international recognition. Additionally, he has been one of few in the industry to bring to television the traditional stage dance of Russia, Bolivia, India, Malaysia and Cuba, preserving their native environment and thereby awakening a deeper understanding of dance. In 2009 he took over as Head of Factual Programming at Studio TV Film in Berlin.  Recognition  Norbert Busè has been officially recognised for his work , including internationally. In 1999 he won the audience-choice award in the youth category from the Film Council of Bremen [Filmbüro Bremen] with his first short film, Incubus. In 2004 he was awarded the Media Prize of the German Diabetes Foundation [Deutsche Diabetes-Stiftung] for his documentary on the epidemic of prosperity. In 2011, his production of Arte Lounge was nominated for the Grimme Prize in the entertainment category. In 2011 the four-part series Auf den Spuren von Easy Rider [Tracking Down Easy Rider] was awarded the gold medal for best production in the cultural category at the world's biggest television trade-show, NAB in Las Vegas. In 2014 he was nominated at the International Classical Music Awards for his directing of the film Sergiu Celibidache - Feuerkopf und Philosophy [Sergiu Celibidache: firebrand and philosopher]. In 2015 his production Richard Strauss and his Heroines won the ECHO Classical award for best DVD-production of the year, and at the International Classical Music Awards. \\"The former ZDF editor and experienced filmmaker Norbert Busé knows all about the cultural history of the 20th century - which expressly includes popular culture as well as the fine arts. In his extensive film oeuvre he has already portrayed the \\"greats\\" such as Stockhausen, John Cage or George Tabori, as well as the stars of the masses: Elvis Presley, the Chinese State Circus or simply the Moving Republic of Germany.\\" (Thomas Schneider, Haus des Dokumentarfilms)  Filmography  1990: Vor was habt Ihr eigentlich Angst?

It is difficult to disentangle Holbein's original work from that of his workshop and other copyists. Possibly five largely original versions survive, as well as a number of drawings made as studies. Holbein's portraits played an important part in spreading the painter's reputation across Europe, as they and their copies were widely distributed. When Holbein moved to England he had a letter of recommendation from Erasmus to Thomas More, in whose house he initially lived. Commission Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam (1466/69–1536) was a renowned humanist scholar and theologian. He moved in 1521 to Basel, the city where Hans Holbein the Younger lived and had his workshop. Such was the fame of Erasmus, who corresponded with scholars throughout Europe, that he needed many portraits of himself to send abroad to his protectors; although not an admirer of painting, he understood the power of image.Bätschmann; Griener, 155 Quentin Matsys painted a noticeably younger Erasmus, writing, in 1517, and used another profile portrait for a medal in 1519. Albrecht Dürer made a portrait in engraving in 1526. But it was Holbein's images that were endlessly copied. Of the work Erasmus wrote in 1524, \\"Recently I sent again two portraits of Erasmus to France, painted by a very skillful artist. The artist carried along my portrait to France.\\" Versions There are three main portrait types: a three-quarters view, probably of 1523, best-known from the National Gallery version; a profile view also from 1523, reading, as in the Louvre, and an older three-quarters view, perhaps c. 1530, probably best represented by the portrait miniature, a roundel 10cm across, in the Kunstmuseum Basel. All of these were produced in many versions, several probably at least partly by Holbein himself, or supervised by him. The pose and face tends to remain the same, but the clothes and backgrounds vary. It seems to have been Holbein's practice to make a very careful drawing of his subjects (though no full drawings for any of these portraits survive) and to then produce the painted portrait without the sitter being present. The Louvre has drawings done as studies for the hands of both its painted version and the London version. There is also a small emblematic depiction of an idealized Erasmus as the Roman god Terminus (his personal emblem), of 1532, now in the Cleveland Museum of Art. =London= The version also known as Portrait of Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam with Renaissance Pilaster is a 1523 painting in oil and tempera on panel, in the National Gallery, London (on long-term loan from the Earl of Radnor). Holbein painted three much-copied portraits of Erasmus in 1523, of which this is the largest and most elaborate. It is likely the one sent to , Archbishop of Canterbury, in England. Holbein later painted Warham after he travelled to England in 1526 in search of work, with a recommendation from Erasmus, who had once lived in England himself. Holbein's portrait of Erasmus includes a Latin couplet by the scholar, inscribed on the edge of the leaning book on the shelf, which states that Holbein would rather have a slanderer than an imitator. According to art historian Stephanie Buck, this portrait is \\"an idealized picture of a sensitive, highly cultivated scholar, and this was precisely how Erasmus wanted to be remembered by future generations\\".Buck, Stephanie. Hans Holbein. Cologne: Könemann, 1999, , p. 50 The painting was formerly at Longford Castle, home of the Earl of Radnor, and may be referred to by this.

Sovereignty The Manchester Martyrs were three Irishmen executed after being condemned for association with the killing of a policeman in Manchester, England in 1867. The day after the executions, Frederick Engels wrote to Karl Marx: \\"Yesterday morning the Tories, by the hand of Mr Calcraft, accomplished the final act of separation between England and Ireland. The only thing that the Fenians still lacked were martyrs. ... To my knowledge, the only time that anybody has been executed for a similar matter in a civilised country was the case of John Brown at Harpers Ferry. The Fenians could not have wished for a better precedent.\\"Marx and Engels in Ireland (1971) Progress Publishers, Moscow. Letter of November 24 1867 Engels to Marx Ten Irish Republican Army members died during a 1981 hunger strike, including Bobby Sands. The Belfiore martyrs (in Italian, Martiri di Belfiore) were a group of Italian pro-independence fighters condemned to death by hanging in 1853 during the Italian Risorgimento. They included Tito Speri and the priest Enrico Tazzoli and are named after the site where the sentence was carried out, in the valley of Belfiore at the south entrance to Mantua. Unionism The Tolpuddle Martyrs were a group of 19th century agricultural labourers in Dorset, England, who were arrested for and convicted of swearing a secret oath as members of the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers. The rules of the society showed it was clearly structured as a friendly society, that is, a mutual association for the purposes of insurance, pensions, savings or cooperative banking; and it operated as a trade-specific benefit society. But at the time, friendly societies had strong elements of what are now considered to be the principal role of trade unions, and wages were at issue. The Tolpuddle Martyrs were sentenced not to death but to transportation to Australia, a harsh form of exile. Communism In the People's Republic of China, people who died in the cause of the Communist Partymost particularly the many victims of the 1927 Shanghai massacre but also including devoted humanitarians during the Chinese Civil War such as the Canadian physician Tillson Harrisonare honored and commemorated as martyrs. The red scarf worn by the 100+ million Young Pioneers honors their spilt blood. Jiang Zhuyun and Liu Hulan are notable female martyrs who have been commemorated in various media. Notable monuments include the Monument to the People's Heroes at the confluence of Suzhou Creek and the Huangpu River in central Shanghai and the Longhua Martyrs' Memorial. Many communist activists have died as martyrs in India, due to their allegiance to various communist parties, such as the CPI(M) and the CPI. Most of them hail from mainly leftist states such as Kerala, and Tripura. In Kerala, many are killed in protests by the police, and some are assassinated by activists in other political parties, such as the INC and the RSS. The district of Kannur has reported to have had the most political murders. Here, the RSS are known to have used brutal violence to eliminate CPI(M) workers.

It originally aired on February 9, 2012. The episode was written by Caroline Dries and directed by Chris Grismer. Plot Rebekah (Claire Holt) attacks Elena (Nina Dobrev) but Elijah (Daniel Gillies) stops her before she kills her. Esther (Alice Evans) organizes a ball as a celebration for her family's reunion and she invites Elena and the whole town. Rebekah invites Matt (Zach Roerig) while Klaus (Joseph Morgan) sends a dress to Caroline (Candice Accola) and invites her as his date. Damon (Ian Somerhalder) and Stefan (Paul Wesley) do not agree with Elena going to the ball and she tells them that she will not go but she eventually does because she wants to know what Esther wants from her. Finn (Casper Zafer) introduces himself to Elena and tells her that his mother would like to see her alone. Damon does not want to let Elena out of his sight, so Elena asks Stefan's help. Stefan snaps Damon's neck and Elena meets Esther. Esther explains to Elena why she is not dead even though Klaus killed her many years ago. She also tells Elena her plan and that the real reason she wanted all her children together was to link them as one so she will be able to kill them and \\"fix\\" the evil she created years ago. To be able to start the ritual, Esther needs Elena's blood. Elena agrees to help her since it is the only way to kill Klaus. In the meantime, Rebekah asks for Kol's (Nathaniel Buzolic) help to hurt Matt so that she can get revenge on Elena for stabbing her, but spending time with Matt makes her change her mind while Klaus confesses to Caroline that he likes her and keeps flirting with her all night. He reveals his passion for drawing and painting but Caroline keeps asking him to free Tyler (Michael Trevino) from the sire bond. Klaus asks her to leave and when she gets home, she finds a drawing sent to her by Klaus. The ball ends and Esther is now able to complete the spell with Finn's help. She links all her children together and Finn tells her that he is ready to die. Elena tells Stefan Esther's plan on their way home and he is glad that Klaus will be dead. Elena tries to make Stefan care again but Stefan says he does not want to care because if he does the only thing he feels is pain and he leaves. Rebekah tries to talk to Matt the next day but he rejects her. Damon, who is also hurt with Elena's behavior, sees that Rebekah is hurt from Matt's rejection and the two of them end up at his bedroom having sex.

Dhalyn Warren from Fanbolt gave the episode an A rating saying that overall she loved the episode and it went by so fast. \\"This week’s episode of The Vampire Diaries featured a killer party! Literally. Beautiful gowns, dancing, not to mention a few snaps of the neck! The Original Family definitely knows how to throw a party, but we all know what happens when there’s an event in Mystic Falls. Dire consequences.\\" Carrie Raisler from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ rating saying that the episode is a \\"very fine\\" one and the Originals are the characters responsible for that. \\"It’s a bit hard to believe [The Originals], all of whom fit into the world of Mystic Falls so perfectly, only just arrived on the scene and are already capable of carrying the majority of an episode all by themselves. TVD doesn’t get enough credit for consistently creating characters that are interesting out of the gate and then using them wisely, therefore ingratiating them to the audience quickly.\\" Diana Steenbergen from IGN rated the episode with 9/10. \\"One thing The Vampire Diaries has made a point of emphasizing in the past is that Elena likes to make her own decisions, and this episode was another example of that. [...] The Season 3 version of Damon may be more in touch with his feelings, but he is still Damon and still has a tendency to act recklessly [...] he didn't take out his anger by compelling or killing some poor, innocent girl the way he had done in the past. For Damon, picking the fight with Kol and hooking up with Rebekah was actually progress.\\" Matt Richenthal from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 3.1/5 focusing on the characters' personal relationships; the new Damon/Rebekah \\"couple\\" as well as the romance between Klaus and Caroline and they probably mean. About The Original mother, he states: \\"[Esther] was easily the best part of the hour. Do we buy that she really wants to kill her children in order to make up for betraying the natural order of things? I think so. It's hard to believe she'd be lying to Finn, her right-hand son, about offing him and his siblings. That would be downright cruel. But will she actually go through with it? That's another matter.\\" E.Reagan from The TV Chick gave a good review to the episode saying that it was solid. \\"Seriously, this show gets better and better every week. Loved the stuff with Mama Original. Super interested in Finn’s martyrdom. Loved Klaus and Caroline. Excited in my happy space about all the Stefan/Elena stuff.

It was the first comet analyzed using polarimetry, by François Arago. Discovery On July 1, 1819, Johann Georg Tralles in Berlin observed a brilliant comet low in the sky during the evening twilight. It was confirmed the next night by the astronomer Johann Elert Bode, also in Berlin. Observations On July 2, Tralles found the comet to have a coma of 40″. On July 3, Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve measured the nucleus at 8″ with a tail of several degrees. Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers reported that the nucleus had an apparent magnitude of 1–2 and a tail about 7–8° long. The comet was last sighted by Struve on October 25. Also on July 3, François Arago used a polarimeter of his own invention to analyze the light from the comet's tail and discovered that it was polarized. He then observed the nearest star, Capella, which did not show polarized light. This indicated that some light from the comet's tail was reflected from the sun. This marked the first polarimetric observation of a comet. Transit of the Sun After the orbital elements of the comet were calculated by Olbers, he discovered that a transit of the Sun by the comet had occurred on June 26, days before its first observations. He reported this to Bode on July 27. Orbit Orbital elements for the comet were calculated by several astronomers. The orbit is classified as parabolic and is nearly perpendicular to Earth's orbital plane, with an inclination of 80°. It passed closest to the Earth on June 25 at a distance of and closest to the Sun on June 28 at . The orbit of the comet and its transit of the Sun were later analyzed by astronomer John Russell Hind. In 2016, the orbit was recalculated based observations of the comet taken in 1819. In literature The comet was widely seen and noted by people who were not astronomers. Poet John Keats noted how he and his wife Fanny had stared at the comet. Historian Nathaniel Philbrick writes about the great comet seen in July 1819 by the people on the island of Nantucket, Massachusetts in his 2000 book, In the Heart of the Sea.

Telelift is headquartered in Maisach, near Munich in Germany and has three subsidiaries in Berlin, Stuttgart and Singapore.  History  Telelift was founded in 1964 in Munich. In the same year, the first of numerous patents was granted for an electric track vehicle system which was the start to a long lasting and still remaining business success in many countries, mainly in Europe and America, but also in Asia, Middle East and Australia. A professional distribution brought hundreds of so-called \\"UniCar“ systems to many hospitals, libraries and administration buildings. HSBC headquarters for example in London and Hong Kong operate large Telelift systems with hundreds of transport trolleys. A second product line was an AGV (automated guided vehicle) called \\"TransCar\\" which was installed from 1974 – 2012 in dozens of hospitals in Europe and Asia. In 1989, Thyssen bought Telelift GmbH, integrated its own library automation system type \\"MultiLift\\" and added the Siemens track system type Simacom VT. In 1999, a Swiss company bought Telelift GmbH and integrated it into their healthcare solutions group. In 2012, Telelift GmbH was sold and is privately owned again.

A Mass rock (Carraig an Aifrinn in Irish) was a rock used as an altar in mid-17th century Ireland as a location for Roman Catholic Mass. From a Statute (No. 15) of the Synod of Clones, held by Oliver Plunkett in 23 August 1670, we can see how a local Mass-site could have been selected in those times. It was decreed at the time that a place be appointed that was convenient to the parish priest and the parishioners. Church law at the time explains why some penal-day Mass sites were to be found centrally situated in a parish, others on the borders of two or more parishes to convenience the worshipers.  Records = 1731 report = The \\"Report on the State of Popery of 1731\\" identifies \\"Atlars ut supra\\" in the Parish of Clontibret. \\"Ut supra\\" is Latin for \\"as stated above\\" and the entry reads ‘one Altar made of earth & stones uncovered’. The entry also relates to multiple altars, these possibly being those located at Lemgare and Tassan (Catholic Historical Society of Ireland (1913) ‘Report on the State of Popery in Ireland, 1731, Archivium Hibernicum, 1, pp. 10-27). This means that knowledge of the Mass Rocks in the townlands of both Lemgare and Tassan potentially dates back to at least 1731. =1957 survey= Lemgare Mass Rock was, along with Tassan Mass Rock, Doohamlet Mass Rock, Lisglasson Mass Gardens and Dunfelimy Mass Hut, recorded in a survey of Mass rocks in Clontibret carried out by Rev P O'Gallachair in 1957 on behalf of the Diocese of Clogher. This survey was aided by Very Rev Larry Marron Adm. of Clontibret Parish at the time. Rev. O'Gallachair mentions the \\"Mass Rock\\" in Dunfelimy being \\"on the site of old church of Annyalla\\". In making this reference he is picking up a point by over thirty years earlier by Fr James E McKenna in his ‘Parishes of Clogher’, Vol. I (Enniskillen, 1920, p. 527). The opinion is that there may be a mix up between a Mass Rock in Dunfelimy and perhaps a structure (usually a hut) which predated the old chapel at Annyalla which was built in the late 1790s. At the time of the survey Lemgare Rock was reported as being on the lands of a John Brennan.  Status  Lemgare Mass Rock has now been listed by the National Monuments Service in their Sites and Monuments Record as \\"MO015-008----\\". The report was compiled by Michael Moore (National Monuments Service) and uploaded onto their viewer on 25 January 2016.http://webgis.archaeology.ie/historicenvironment/ Location Lemgare Mass Rock would have been a good location for the people from the surrounding parishes to attend mass. In those times there were no physical borders in Ireland and people went to and from county to county and parish to parish with relative ease. Indeed, up to the 1930s a lot of young people from Derrynoose Parish would have indeed come to school in Lemgare. The location of Lemgare Mass Rock would have been strategically important due to its; Because of the site's elevation (including from the \\"Carnan\\", which is a lookout point above the rock from which four counties are visible) it would have near on impossible for any approaching army to surprise the parishioners whilst they prayed.

The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. The farmhouse is now the Bradford House Bed and Breakfast. Description and history The town of Patten is located in the remote interior of Maine, in northern Penobscot County. The Bradford Farm complex occupies about just north of the village center. The main complex is located on the west side of Maine State Route 11, the main north-south route through the county, and the associated farmlands extend west and north to Maine State Route 159, which provides access to the northern end of Baxter State Park. The main feature of the farm complex is its 19th-century connected farmstead, which includes a c. 1845 Greek Revival house, connected via ells to a barn complex, whose oldest element is an English barn of similar vintage. Other buildings include a 19th-century potato house and wagon shed. The township that became Patten was first settled in the 1830s, and Patten was incorporated in 1841. The Bradford Farm property, originally a full lot of , was first owned by David Haynes, who is credited with building the earliest portions of the extant complex. The property was purchased in 1893 by Ezekiel Bradford, whose family worked the land for 105 years. The Bradfords operated the property primarily as a dairy farm, adding and extending buildings to meet a variety of needs. In 1998 the farmhouse was converted into a bed and breakfast inn.

The genus contains a single species, Gyaclavator kohlsi. History and classification G. kohlsi was described from a group of fossils, which are compression-impression fossil pairs preserved in layers of soft sedimentary rock. Along with other well preserved insect fossils, the G. kohlsi specimens were collected from layers of the Late Early Eocene Parachute Creek Member of the Green River Formation. The formation is a group of Late Paleocene to Late Eocene depositional basins in Wyoming and Utah. The Parachute Creek Member is a composed of oil shales from the shallow mountain lake, Lake Uinta, that existed for around 20 million years. Study of the paleoflora preserved in the shales indicates the lake was around in elevation surrounded by a tropical to subtropical environment that had a distinct dry season. At the time of study, the holotype and paratype counterpart and parts were part of the paleoentomology collections housed by the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. They were first studied by an international team of researchers headed by Torsten Wappler of the Naturmuseum Senckenberg, Messel pit research station, Germany. The team's 2014 type description of the genus and species was published in the natural sciences journal PLOS ONE. The generic name is a combination of \\"Gyas\\", a Greek giant, and the Latin \\"clavator\\" meaning club. The name is a reference to the unique enlarged structuring of the antennae. The specific epithet kohlsi is a patronym coined in honor of David Kohls, for the support he has provided paleontology along with finding and donating the holotype fossil. At the time of description, the total number of Tingidae species described from fossils in the United States was six, with Dictyla veterna, Eotingis antennata and Tingis florissantensis from the late Eocene Florissant Formation. Vianagramma goldmani and Vianathauna pericarti are both from the Turonian New Jersey amber. Of the four species described from Colorado as of 2015, G. kohlsi was the first described from the Green River Formation. The structuring of the wings is very similar to extant species in the subfamily Cantacaderinae. However phyogenetic analysis gave results suggesting G. kohlsi is a possible sister taxon to the subfamily. If placed in the subfamily, the species would be the only record of the subfamily from the Nearctic region, though the subfamily is known from the Neotropic region, with a fossil species described from Dominican amber. Description G. kohlsi paratype The known G. kohlsi fossils are all males, preserved with whole bodies but missing portions of the legs or antennae. The holotype and two of the paratypes are preserved in ventral view while the fourth paratype is in dorsal preservation and missing the forward area and antennae. The holotype is from the ends of the hemelytra to the tip of the head. The three paratypes are , , and long respectively. In all the specimens the well developed hemelytra project past the tip of the abdomen and the bodies have an overall ovoid shape. The heads have a long rostrum, laying along the head and ending almost at the abdomen. The eyes are round and project from out from the sides of the head. There are three raised carinae which run along the pronotum. The antennae, which are as long as the head to the abdomen, are made up of four segments. Antennomere three is the longest and antennomere two is shortest. The final segment is flared into a petal form, with a ridge separating them into a wider side and a longer side. Given the unique flaring of the distiflagellomere (the last segment of the antennae), it is possible the antennae were used in male to male competition displays, or in female courtship, though they may have only been used for sensory input. The species is the first known example of distinct visual display structuring in Tingidae antennae. Similar modification of antennae segments is seen in the leaf footed bug genera Chariesterus and Chondrocera who use them in aerial displays competing with nearby males to attract females.

Built in stages in the mid-19th century, it exhibits an unusual combination of Greek Revival and southern Gothic Revival features that is not otherwise known in Vermont. It is also possible that parts of the house were built using slave labor, an extremely rare occurrence in the state. The property, which now houses an art gallery, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Wheelock House is located in southern Townshend, on the east side of Vermont Route 30 about south of the village center. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, clapboard siding, two interior brick chimneys, and a granite foundation. It is set on a rise overlooking the road and the nearby West River. The corners of the building have paneled pilasters with molded capitals, rising to a narrow modillioned frieze. A single-story porch extends across the center three bays of the main facade, supported by octagonal tapered columns rising to a richly carved entablature. The main entrance is framed by sidelight and transom windows. The interior retains original plaster and woodwork of high quality, including a straight-run central staircase whose railings run continuously up to the attic level. The oldest portion of the house is believed to be its kitchen ell, which was probably built about 1820 by a member of the Wood family, who had owned the property since 1779. In 1839 the property was sold to Caleb Wheelock, whose son Allen is credited with construction of the major portion of the house in the late 1850s. Allen Wheelock spent several years in Natchez, Mississippi, where he administered an estate and apparently acquired significant wealth, including four slaves. The house incorporates some design features and building practices that are more typical of the South than they are of Vermont, and some of its decorative materials (notably the porch columns) may have been brought north. Local folklore includes unconfirmed stories that the Wheelock slaves were involved in its construction.

It flows from east to west across the northern boundary of the City of Tucson from the confluence of Tanque Verde Creek and Pantano Wash to the Santa Cruz River away. The Rillito River Park runs along the north and south banks of the river from Interstate 10 to North Craycroft Road. History Prior to development by European settlers, much of the Santa Cruz valley was filled with riparian habitats, including numerous zones along the banks of the Rillito River. As recently as the late 19th century, the river was a perennial stream lined with trees and dense vegetation such as cottonwoods, willows, and mesquites. However, due to increased pumping of groundwater for irrigation projects to support agriculture and urban development, the river eventually dried up and much of the riparian habitat was lost by the mid 20th century. The loss of vegetation led to increased erosion of the river banks during flood events, which in turn led to a widening and straightening of the river channel. Today, the Rillito is an ephemeral river that only carries water during floods or in response to snowmelt. In the late 20th century, as a flood control measure, many segments of the channel's banks were stabilized using soil cement to reduce erosion and prevent the water from overflowing the banks and damaging property.

It is closely related to the plenary power doctrine that immunizes from judicial review the substantive immigration decisions of the United States Congress and the executive branch of the United States government. Since the alien denied entry at a consulate abroad was not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, it is not a priori clear whether the alien has standing to sue in the US justice system. However, the principle of consular nonreviewability goes further than simply denying aliens standing; it also creates a strong presumption against judicial review of consular decisions requested by United States citizens and residents affected by them.  Distinction between Department of State decisions, USCIS decisions, and ICE/CBP immigration enforcement decisions  Consular nonreviewability specifically applies to decisions made by consular officers representing the United States in other countries, who are employees of the United States Department of State. It does not apply to decisions made by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. For many immigrant and non-immigrant visas, the approval of a petition or application from the USCIS is a prerequisite for obtaining the visa. However, the visa may be denied despite the USCIS application having been approved, and consular nonreviewability insulates such decisions from challenge. For instance, in the case of Kerry v. Din (2015) the applicant whose visa was denied had gotten USCIS approval through a Form I-130 filed by his wife, but his visa was nonetheless denied and the United States government claimed that detailed explanation of the reason of denial was not necessary. Consular nonreviewability also does not apply to decisions made by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers when deciding whether to allow an alien to enter or not enter the United States at a designated port of entry, or to immigration enforcement actions taken by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. However, in practice, the avenues of legal redress for the actions of these agencies are limited, owing to the plenary power doctrine.  Review and reconsideration within the Department of State  Consular nonreviewability does not mean that the Department of State cannot reconsider its immigration decisions. There are a number of avenues for redress within the Department of State for somebody whose visa is denied. = Re-application and submission of additional information = * Section 214(b) refusals: These are refusals for non-immigrant visas where the consular officer is unconvinced of the applicant's non-immigrant intent. This ground of refusal cannot be appealed, but the applicant is free to apply again for a visa (paying the visa fee again). Past refusals are on the record and the applicant is therefore in principle expected to show a change in circumstances to explain why he/she would now qualify for a visa. However, since different consular officers make decisions based on their own discretion the applicant may well qualify when applying the second time despite no change to circumstances. * Section 221(g) refusals: These \\"quasi-refusals\\" mean that the consular officer has deferred a final decision on the applicant, and will complete the decision once additional information from the applicant or the United States government becomes available. If the pending information needs to come from the applicant, there is a time limit of one year. If the applicant exceeds the time limit, the applicant needs to re-apply. If the pending information needs to come from the United States government, there is no time limit. The various grounds for such quasi-refusals: ** Suspension of Action on Petition ** Addition evidence is required ** Withdrawal of application (while it is pending adjudication) = Supervisorial review = The Code of Federal Regulations states that all non-immigrant visa denials should be reviewed by a supervisor. However, the Foreign Affairs Manual states that as many refusals as practical, but not fewer than 20%, should be reviewed, as soon as possible, but deferrable by up to 120 days if the applicant wishes to submit additional evidence. For immigrant visa applications, the review must take place as soon as administratively feasible (but within 30 days) unless the applicant wishes to submit additional evidence (in which case there is no time limit). Supervisorial review of 214(b) refusals (failure to establish non-immigrant intent) require the supervisor to re-interview the applicant. = It may be possible to appeal a decision within a consulate = In some limited circumstances, the decisions of consular officers may be appealed within the consulate. However, there are no procedural guarantees of this.  Scope and exceptions  A few exceptions to the doctrine of consular nonreviewability have emerged over the years: # The Mandel test, namely, that the consulate did not provide a \\"facially legitimate and bona fide\\" reason for the rejection, and it might infringe on the constitutional rights of United States citizens. # In cases where a consular officer rejects the application based on an underlying statute or regulation, it may sometimes be appealed on these two grounds: #* Claims that the underlying statute or regulation being applied is unconstitutional. #* Claims that the consular officer made a procedural error in applying the statute.  History  Since it almost by definition excludes judicial review, cases challenging the doctrine of consular nonreviewability are heard quite rarely in court. However, the doctrine has evolved somewhat in response to court challenges. = Post-Chinese Exclusion Act: The Chinese Exclusion Case (1889) = Some important precedents regarding judicial reviewability of immigration decisions were set in the aftermath of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act and Immigration Act of 1882. The Chinese Exclusion Act was the first federal immigration act to significantly affect migration flows, and the Immigration Act of 1882 gave enforcement teeth to this law by making immigration enforcement a federal matter. At this time, the determination regarding whether an alien could enter the United States was by the officer at the designated port of entry. When the officer decided not to admit the alien, the alien was generally detained on the vessel he or she had arrived on and then returned to his or her home country by the captain of the vessel. Since the vessel would generally be harbored in the United States prior to departure, the alien could file a writ of habeas corpus and have his or her refusal challenged in court, at least in principle. A few such cases shortly after the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act helped delineate the scope of judicial review for decisions on whether to admit an alien. The most significant case was Chae Chan Ping v. United States (1889), also called the Chinese Exclusion Case. Chae Chan Ping, a Chinese-born United States resident was denied re-entry to the United States after a trip to China, in accordance with the Scott Act, which had passed after his departure to China but prior to his return arrival. He filed a lawsuit against the United States government, and lost. In its decision, the Supreme Court wrote that the power to exclude foreigners rested with the executive branch of the government, and any international grievances arising from this were the province of the political department of the government. Other cases that occurred in subsequent years further strengthened the plenary power doctrine, though they related to the authority to deny entry and deport people and did not address consular decisions. These included Fong Yue Ting v. United States (1893), Lem Moon Sing v. United States (1895), and United States v. Ju Toy (1905). =Post- Immigration Act of 1924: London v. Phelps (1927) and Ulrich v. Kellogg (1929) = Prior to World War I, passports and visas were not necessary to enter the United States at a designated port of entry. In 1917 (during World War I), the United States Department of State and United States Department of Labor issued a joint order to diplomatic, consular, and immigration officers requiring that noncitizens have a passport and visa before seeking entry to the United States. In 1918, these requirements were made long-term by the United States Congress. Initially, consular officers issuing visas did not check for grounds of inadmissibility; rather, they simply issued the visa and informed the applicant of potential grounds for inadmissibility, leaving the task of determining inadmissibility to the officer at the port of entry. This led to the problem of people undertaking an expensive journey and then being rejected at the port of entry. In 1924, Congress enacted a provision requiring consular officers to make a determination of admissibility and issue the visa only if they were satisfied. While the officer at the border still had final say on whether to admit the alien (i.e., the alien could be denied entry despite having a valid visa), the visa served an important prior screening and filtering role. At the same time, the United States moved in the direction of more comprehensive restrictions on immigration from around the world. Specifically, the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 restricted annual immigration from a country to no more than 3% of the population of people from that country in the United States as of the U.S. Census of 1910; the Immigration Act of 1924 (The Johnson-Reed Act) further reduced this to 2%. While this effectively limited immigration from most countries to lower than the levels at that time, the primary purpose of the law was to clamp down on immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe. It also significantly affected immigration from Africa and Asia. The combination of the increased degree of immigration restriction and the shifting of immigration decisions towards consulates abroad gave consular decisions considerable significance. Two cases in the immediate aftermath of the Immigration Act of 1924 have been cited as precedents for consular nonreviewability: * United States ex rel. London v. Phelps 22 F. 2d 288 (2d Cir. 1927): Mrs. London, who lived in Canada, requested a visa to visit her children in New York City. Her visa was denied. She appeared at the border where she was refused entry. She filed a habeas corpus petition against the U.S. immigration inspector, arguing that as a resident of Canada she was not required to have a visa to travel to the United States. She also argued that the issuance of visas was simply a ministerial act, and therefore the decision not to grant her a visa was wrong as well. The case was decided against Mrs. London. The Phelps court's decision noted that \\"Unjustifiable refusal to vise a passport [...] is beyond the jurisdiction of the court.\\" While the case has been cited as a precedent for consular nonreviewability, some have argued that it addressed only the question of what was relevant to that particular court case. * United States ex rel. Ulrich v. Kellogg 30 F. 2d 984, 985 (D.C. Cir. 1929): The petitioner, a U.S. citizen, filed a petition for writ of mandamus asking the court to order the U.S. consulate in Berlin to issue a visa to his wife in Germany. The consulate had refused to issue her a visa based on the claim that she had previously committed larceny, considered a crime of moral turpitude. The court reviewed the decision and found that the conviction for larceny constituted a crime of moral turpitude, and therefore made her inadmissible. It further noted that, both on the language of the relevant statutes, the power to issue or deny visas lay with consular officers, not with the Secretary of State, and therefore the Secretary of State could not order a consular officer to change a visa decision. = The Administrative Procedure Act (1946), Knauff v. Shaughnessy (1950), and reliance on the plenary power doctrine = Prior to 1946, there was no barrier in principle to judicial review of consular decisions, but there was no clear protocol in general for challenging decisions by government agencies in courts. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 changed this; Section 10 of the APA permitted judicial review for any person \\"adversely affected or aggrieved\\" by the actions of a government agency. Also, Section 279 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 explicitly gave the courts jurisdiction over \\"all causes\\" arising under Title II of the statute. This meant that cases would be brought to the courts the decisions on which would help clarify their thinking on consular nonreviewability. Courts' initial response to efforts to challenge consular decisions was to rely on the plenary power doctrine. The first decision establishing the plenary power doctrine in the post-APA era was Knauff v. Shaughnessy (1950). According to the Knauff court, \\"whatever the procedure authorized by Congress, it is due process as far as an alien denied entry is concerned.\\" In this case, Knauff, the alien wife of a citizen who had served for the United States in World War II sought admission to the United States (and would ordinarily have been eligible based on the War Brides Act), but was denied admission by the United States based on confidential information. The Attorney General denied a hearing, arguing that a hearing would reveal sensitive information that would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. The Supreme Court upheld the Attorney General's decision, clarifying that the denial of entry to the alien wife was not unconstitutional, and that it is \\"not within the province of any court, unless expressly authorized by law, to review the determination of the political branch of Government to exclude a certain alien.\\" Two other court decisions at the time played some role in establishing the doctrine of consular nonreviewability: * Licea-Gomez v. Pilliod, 193 F. Supp. 577 (N.D. Ill. 1960): The petitioner was excluded for lacking a visa, and filed a complaint under the APA challenging both the exclusion order and the consular officer's refusal to issue a visa. The court acknowledged that the petitioner could challenge the exclusion under the APA, but declined to consider the arguments relating to the denial of the visa. * Loza-Bedoya v. INS, 410 F.2d 343 (9th Cir. 1969): The INS had incorrectly informed the U.S. consulate that Loza-Bedoya had been involved with criminal activity, and the consulate denied a visa based on that. He, however, re- entered the United States without inspection and was later placed in deportation proceedings. He filed a motion with the Board of Immigration Appeals to reopen, but was denied, and he challenged this in court, but the court sided with the BIA. = Kleindienst v. Mandel (1972) = Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S 753 (1972) was a United States Supreme Court decision that upheld that the United States Attorney General has the right to refuse somebody's entry to the United States, as he has been empowered to do so in 212 (a) (28) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. This action was brought to compel Attorney General Kleindienst to grant a temporary nonimmigrant visa to a Belgian journalist and Marxian theoretician whom the American plaintiff-appellees, Ernest Mandel et al., had invited to participate in academic conferences and discussions in the US. The alien had been found ineligible for admission under 212 (a) (28) (D) and (G) (v) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, barring those who advocate or publish \\"the economic, international, and governmental doctrines of world communism.\\" Kleindienst had declined to waive ineligibility as he has the power to do under 212 (d) of the Act, basing his decision on unscheduled activities engaged in by the alien on a previous visit to the United States, when a waiver was granted. Even though it upheld consular nonreviewability, the opinion offered in the Kleindienst v. Mandel case paved the way for potential challenges to consular decisions. Specifically, Kleindienst v. Mandel rejected judicial review because it ruled that the consulate had offered a \\"bona fide and facially legitimate\\" reason for rejecting the visa. This suggested that in cases where such a reason was not provided, the consular decision may be subject to judicial review. This criterion for whether a consular decision might be eligible for judicial review would come to be known as the Mandel test. = Kerry v. Din (2015) = Kerry v. Din (576 U.S. ___) (2015) was a United States Supreme Court decision that upheld the doctrine of consular nonreviewability. The case was filed by Fauzia Din, a United States citizen who had arrived in the country as a refugee from Afghanistan in 2000. In September 2006, she married Kanishka Berashk, a citizen of Afghanistan, who had worked as a civil servant under the Taliban regime. Din then submitted a Form I-130 petition to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, sponsoring Berashk under the Immediate Relative category. The petition was approved by the USCIS. Berashk used the approved Form I-130 to apply for a visa to enter the United States. However, in June 2009, he was informed that his visa was denied; the stated reason for the denial was that he had provided material support to a terrorist but no further details were provided. Din filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California arguing that the government denied her due process of law by depriving her of her \\"constitutional right to live in the United States with her spouse.\\" The District Court rejected her argument, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. The United States appealed the reversal in the Supreme Court. Per the Mandel test, there were two questions at hand: # Was a constitutional right of Fauzia Din, a United States citizen, infringed upon? # Was the reason offered by the consulate for rejecting Berashk's visa \\"bona fide and facially legitimate\\" per Mandel? The case was won by the United States, with the Supreme Court split in its opinion. Antonin Scalia, John G. Roberts, and Clarence Thomas wrote plurality opinions. Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito concurred. Scalia's opinion rejected (1), i.e., he argued that the denial of a visa did not implicate a fundamental liberty interest, and that it differed from Loving v. Virginia in that the right to marriage was not being questioned. Kennedy's opinion differed from Scalia's in that he did not come to a definite conclusion regarding (1), but instead he rejected (2), arguing that even if Din's liberty was infringed upon, the reason explanation offered by the consulate for the denial (i.e., that Berashk had provided material support to a terrorist organization) fulfilled the government's obligations, and that further details were not required in cases where the application was denied due to terrorism or national security concerns. Stephen Breyer wrote a dissenting opinion answering both (1) and (2) in the affirmative, in which he was joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Scalia's opinion argued that Kennedy's concurrence argued that the On the other hand, Breyer's dissent argued that forbidding people from living together did effectively impede the right to marry, and that the level of explanation offered for the denial was inadequate, similar to \\"telling a criminal defendant that he is accused of breaking the law.\\" Although Kerry v. Din upheld the doctrine of consular nonreviewability, legal commentators viewed it as not carrying much additional weight as a precedent since the decision was a plurality opinion.

If scenes and sequences are generally imposed by the scenario and its narration, rhythmicien or metric cinema assumes to be indifferent to subject and story. Images and sounds are detached from any production of meaning ; they are exclusively dedicated to a rhythmic layout where visual and sound elements are used as material for durations, rates, frequencies, times and cycles. A process is established with the aim of collecting visual dynamics in a structured composition. From shooting to editing, all cinematographic resources are considered a priori sources of rhythm: axes and camera movements, lenses, editing, are thus subject to constraint through a rhythmic system (similar to music, metric or not), which offers unusual compositions on screen. Framings or pans, which are usually led by the movement of a character, are pre-set here: regardless of whether this character stays in the frame or not.Elisabeth Jenny, Les conceptions du montage, CinémaAction N°72, 3ème trimestre 1994 =Experiments= His work as a rhythmicien artist implies progressing over very long periods, like daily shots for over 24 years, (Séries circadienne) or using 2 video cameras, shooting every two weeks at noon sharp, in the imposed itinerary at the gates of Paris, (Midi pile). These projects, initiated in January 1994, continue today. Once a month in his workshop, projections that are held. His experimentations delve into his personal archives of films and videos, stored over time, in order to compose visual and sound arrangements specific to each session. The result is a kind of palimpsest in permanent mutation. The projection itself becomes form.

This has sometimes been referred to as the unfinished last Grateful Dead album and The Missing Album. The band began work on a new album in February 1992, which was incomplete. After Jerry Garcia's death, the band had considered finishing the album, but it never came into fruition. On October 8, 2019, it was announced that a new album entitled Ready or Not would be released on November 22, 2019. It contains 9 songs, recorded during live performances between 1992 and 1995. All songs are from the list given below.promotional email Overview In the early 1990s, the Grateful Dead had been working on new songs. When Jerry Garcia died in 1995, the band decided to break up and this album was never finished. Work on the unfinished album began in February 1992 in West Marin County in California, at a studio the band called \\"the Site\\", which was located on a hill with scenic views and occasional views of wildlife. At the time, Jerry Garcia was not particularly interested or focused upon the project, which discouraged its impetus. The studio session work did not have any lead vocals from songs that Garcia performed lead vocals on, and Garcia's guitar work on the tracks was described as \\"rudimentary.\\" The tracks for the new album were incomplete. In 1995, Phil Lesh was performing studio work on the unfinished album. At this time, Lesh stated that the album \\"... doesn't have much Jerry on it\\", referring to Garcia. In 1997, Bob Weir stated that the album could potentially be completed, but that it would take additional collaboration from the remaining band members. Weir and others stated at this time that they expected for a collaboration to finish the album to occur sometime in 1998. In August 1999, Lesh stated that he felt the content from the studio sessions did not merit use on an album, and that efforts to improve the content would not equate to what Garcia would have performed. In 1999, Dennis McNally, spokesperson for the Grateful Dead, stated that using another guitarist to fill-in for Garcia \\"would have been unconscionable\\", and that \\"without Garcia, there is no last album.\\" So the album never came into fruition. The box set So Many Roads (1965–1995) has six songs from live concert performance and rehearsal tracks from the unfinished Grateful Dead album. This album would have had the most variety of lead singers for songs of any of the Grateful Dead's studio albums, other than American Beauty. There were four singers: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh and Vince Welnick. Fan renditions Fans and book authors have created their own albums that could represent what they had been working on. An example of this is the mock-album Days Between (The Final Album That Never Was), put together by Tony Sclafani, author of the 2013 book The Grateful Dead FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the Greatest Jam Band in History. This would-be album is sketched out in Chapter 35 of his book; he also put together a video on YouTube, made up of studio and live recordings, so fans could hear what the album might have sounded like. Another fine example of this is So Many Roads (1995, Full Album), a video on YouTube which collects studio quality recordings of the songs that were slated to be on the album. It also only has 10 tracks instead of twelve; the exclusions are \\"Samba in the Rain\\", and \\"If the Shoe Fits\\" So Many Roads - The Grateful Dead (Full Album) Track listing The following are the songs that were planned for this album: * \\"Liberty\\" (Jerry Garcia/Robert Hunter) * \\"Samba in the Rain\\" (Vince Welnick/Robert Hunter) * \\"So Many Roads\\" (Jerry Garcia/Robert Hunter) * \\"Days Between\\" (Jerry Garcia/Robert Hunter) * \\"Corrina\\" (Bob Weir/Mickey Hart/Robert Hunter) * \\"Fearless Groove\\" (Mickey Hart/Bill Kreutzmann) * \\"If the Shoe Fits\\" (Phil Lesh/Andrew Charles) * \\"Easy Answers\\" (Bob Weir/Bob Bralove/Rob Wasserman/Vince Welnick/Robert Hunter) * \\"Eternity\\" (Bob Weir/Rob Wasserman/Willie Dixon) * \\"Childhood's End\\" (Phil Lesh) * \\"Way to Go Home\\" (Vince Welnick/Bob Bralove/Robert Hunter) * \\"Wave to the Wind\\" (Phil Lesh/Robert Hunter) * \\"Lazy River Road\\" (Jerry Garcia/Robert Hunter) See also * Unfinished creative work ReferencesExternal links * Grateful Dead – official website Category:Grateful Dead Category:Unfinished albums ","title":"Unfinished Grateful Dead album"},{"id":"49121157","text":"Pastime is a 1990 American drama film directed by Robin B.

Plot In 1957, a California low-level minor- league baseball team called the Steamers has a pitcher way beyond his prime, 41-year-old Roy Dean Bream, who reminisces about his brief \\"cup of coffee\\" in the Major Leagues and how the great Stan Musial once hit a grand slam home run against him. New to the team is 17-year-old Tyron Debray, a fireballing pitcher Bream immediately takes under his wing. Because one is old, talkative and white and the other young, quiet and black, various tensions materialize on the team, many of them instigated by Randy Keever, a bad-tempered bully who is another of the team's pitchers. Bream is keeping a secret as he goes through what is likely to be his final season, a heart condition for which he is taking medication.

Schomburg collection.  Early life and education  Ernestine Rose was born on March 19, 1880, in Bridgehampton, New York, and named after Ernestine Polowsky Rose, a nineteenth-century feminist. She studied at Wesleyan University and the New York State Library School in Albany, New York, where she graduated in 1904. During her study at the New York State Library School, she worked a summer at a branch of the New York Public Library (NYPL) on the Lower East Side during her college education where she was exposed to Russian-Jewish immigrants and their culture. She emphasized programs that would help immigrants adjust to a new country rather than programs design to \\"Americanize\\" them, as was the norm at the time.  Career  During World War I, Rose served as director of hospital libraries for the American Library Association (ALA). Returning to New York, in 1915, she served as head librarian at the Seward Park Branch, located in a Jewish immigrant community of New York City, until 1917. At Steward Park, she encouraged her assistants to become well versed in Jewish, Yiddish and Russian holidays, customs, and literature, intending to make them sensitive to the surrounding community. Rose became the branch librarian at the 135th Street Branch in Harlem in 1920. The branch had opened in 1905 when the neighborhood was inhabited by middle- class Jews, but a migration of southern Blacks, Caribbean, and South American Blacks following World War I changed the neighborhood to be a majority African-American neighborhood by the time Rose was appointed. The Harlem Renaissance of the time made Harlem a destination for black writers, artists, musicians, and scholars. Rose immediately noted that many cultural institutions weren't working with the new community and she wanted to make the library an integral part of the community that would provide guidance and promote racial pride. Her first role was to integrate the library staff, hiring four new library assistants of color, starting with Catherine Allen Latimer and including Pura Belpre and Nella Larsen Imes. She also worked to encourage community groups to hold meetings, reading and organized story hours, free public lectures, exhibitions of Black artists and sculptors and a reference collection of Black literature. In 1922, Rose worked with the ALA to organize a group of librarians to exchange ideas and discuss issues of working with African Americans. In 1924, Rose worked with Franklin F. Hopper, chief of the circulation department of the Central Branch, the National Urban League, and the American Association for Adult Education to secure a combined $15,000 grant from the Rosenwald Fund and the Carnegie Corporation. They formed the Harlem Committee, whose goals were to use the funds to develop cultural, vocational, and social programs within the Harlem community. They developed programs featuring well-known speakers, vocational classes through the YWCA and the Urban League. In 1926, the committee oversaw the purchase the Arthur A. Schomburg collection to incorporate into The Division of Negro Literature and History, later becoming the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, at the library. The collection included \\"over 5,000 volume[s], 3,000 manuscripts, 2,000 etchings and portraits and several thousand pamphlets\\" showcasing the history and culture of African Americans. The grant also made possible the hiring of Schomburg to head the collection. In 1933, the library worked with the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to host a writers project. Rose retired from the NYPL in 1942.

He also runs a YouTube channel that currently has obtained over 2.5 Million Subscribers and over 550 million channel views as of August 22, 2020. Call of Duty esports career=Call of Duty: Black Ops II (2012–2013 season)= Scump played for OpTic for the Call of Duty: Black Ops II season. OpTic would take their only 1st-place finish at UMG Chicago, but would never finish outside of the top 10. OpTic achieved a 3rd-place finish at the 2013 Call of Duty Championship to finish off the 2012–2013 season. =Call of Duty: Ghosts (2013–2014 season)= Seth stayed on OpTic going into the Call of Duty: Ghosts season. However, after a 9th-place finish at the MLG Fall Championship and a 13th-place finish at UMG Philadelphia, Scump announced he would be leaving OpTic and joining Team EnVyUs alongside Merk, ProoFy, and Goonjar because of a rivalry with Nadeshot. Less than two-weeks after his departure from OpTic, Scump announced that he was leaving Envy and returning to Optic. He would rejoin the lineup of Nadeshot, MBoZe, and Clayster for the Call of Duty Championship 2014. The squad finished 3rd for the second year in a row. After that tournament, the team picked up ProoFy to replace MBoZe, who then became captain of OpTic Nation. The new team placed in the top eight at UGC Niagara, and was invited to attend the MLG X Games Invitational. Here, OpTic advanced all the way through their bracket to face Team Kaliber in the Grand Final. OpTic won, and Scump become one of the first gold medalists for Call of Duty.

The team initially placed second to Crimsix's longtime teammate Aches at the first event of the season, and afterwards placed first at UMG Orlando 2015, the MLG Pro League Season 1 Playoffs, and the Call of Duty Championship's NA Regional event. At the 2015 Call of Duty World Championship, the team placed a disappointing 7th after they went into the event as the clear favorites. After the event, Scumps's longtime teammate, Nadeshot, decided to leave competitive Call of Duty and was replaced by Damon \\"Karma\\" Barlow, with Scump becoming the team captain. As the new captain of OpTic Gaming, Seth led the team to 6 more championships and 2 more Pro League Regular Season wins to end the Advanced Warfare season. They won ESWC Zénith 2015 and Gfinity Spring Masters 1 with Enable in place of Karma, but as they returned to the United States they went to California to compete at UMG California 2015 with Karma. When they won UMG Cali it marked their 3rd straight event win in three consecutive weekends in three different countries. They then finished 1st in Season 2 of the MLG Pro League to qualify for MLG Pro League Season 2 Playoffs at the summer XGAMES in Austin, Texas, where he and OpTic defended their title and won his second gold medal. OpTic and Scump then finished 2nd to FaZe Clan at UMG Dallas 2015 and Gfinity Summer Championship. They bounced back as they won UMG Washington D.C. 2015 and MLG Pro League Season 3 Regular Season, where they went 11–0 in the season. Once again, they fell short and placed 2nd to Scump's ex-teammate, Clayster's FaZe team for the final time in AW. Scump then went on to win the final event of Advanced Warfare, MLG World Finals, with OpTic Gaming. He stated that the World Finals was the only event where he felt like he got carried, but it still marked Scump's and OpTic's most successful year by far. They won 9 championships, all 3 of the online Pro League Season, appeared in 10/11 Grand Finals, they won many online tournaments hosted by MLG and UMG, earned 1,651,320 pro points, and Seth had the most pro points out of any player with 447,975. =Call of Duty: Black Ops III (2015–2016 season)= Going into the Call of Duty: Black Ops III season Scump confirmed that OpTic Gaming would not be making any roster changes, like many other teams. OpTic Gaming went on to successfully qualify for the Call of Duty World League NA. OpTic gaming placed 2nd in the first event of the season, the \\"Totino's invitational\\", losing to Rise Nation in the final. After entering the next event with a top-4 seed, Seth and his team were met an even worse placing of 4–8 along with the other top-seeded teams, however the event suffered from technical difficulties leading to an apology from the event's management.http://www.umggaming.com/page/UMG-Update Scump has won now two 25k tournaments hosted by UMG gaming and one 25k tournament hosted by ESL.

After inconsistent placings at numerous major events, the roster split up after a series of poor tournament placings, with Scump performing badly individually. They kicked FormaL and Karma and recruited players Sam 'Octane' Larew and Anthony 'Methodz' Zinni. But their problems weren't solved, as they placed 5–6th at the CWL Anaheim open, 7–8th at stage two playoffs and 17–24th in the 2018 Call of Duty Championship. This was the first time since Modern Warfare 2 that OpTic Gaming failed to win a single championship throughout a season.

It is similar to the \\"no poo\\" method in that it discourages the use of shampoo. Among other things, it calls for the use of a cleansing conditioner in place of shampoo (also called \\"conditioner washing\\" or \\"co-washing\\"), no silicones (used in many commercial conditioners and styling products), the use of a diffuser when blowdrying, and no combs, brushes, or terrycloth towels. It also includes tips for using hair gel and other styling products. The aim in general is to treat naturally curly hair gently, minimizing damage to the hair cuticle; to keep it moisturized, since curly hair is more prone to dryness than straight hair; and, perhaps most significantly, to accentuate rather than interfere with the hair's natural curl pattern. The most prominent curly hair classification system groups curly types from 2 to 4 and A to C (representing increasing tightness of the curl) with type 1 representing the complete absence of curl (or straight hair). Type 2 typically encompasses varying degrees of wavy hair, Type 3 contains loose, spiraled curls, and Type 4 includes tighter curls, kinks, and coils. History Woman with Afro While variations of the method had been in use before then, in 2001 it was introduced to a wider audience by hairstylist Lorraine Massey, founder of the Devachan Salons. Lorraine has parted ways with DevaCurl few years ago and now the owner and founder of Curly World products and Spiral XYZ Curl Salon in NYC,. When the Curly Girl Hand Book was first published, straight hair was the prevailing style for women in the USA, the U.K., and elsewhere, and many women felt pressured to straighten their hair with flat irons or chemical relaxers. Massey writes in her introduction about growing up in England, where she was ridiculed for having curly hair. When she moved to New York City, she had an eye-opening experience: \\"Jewish, Italian, Latino, and African-American people living around me had curly hair that looked like mine! I no longer looked or felt like an outsider.\\" Since the early 2010s, curly hairstyles have become more popular and championed by many celebrities like Yara Shahidi, Solange Knowles, Viola Davis, and Sarah Jessica Parker. Variations Woman with curly hair People with various hair textures have adapted the method to their needs. Popular variations include the use of sulfate-free shampoos, which are more widely available now than they were in 2001, and occasional blow-drying with the use of heat protectants and a diffuser instead of a regular hair dryer. An additional essential step in the curly hair care routine includes the use of deep conditioners once a week. These deep conditioning treatments work more effectively if they are performed regularly once a week. Application of heat by using thermal heat caps helps deep conditioners penetrate the cuticle better leaving the hair more moisturised. The method is also used by males; the name \\"curly girl\\" reflects the relative importance of hair care to women and girls due to societal expectations.Massey, p. 135 The method can also be used on kinky, coily, and wavy hair, which are often treated as curly hair types or \\"curl patterns\\" on hair care websites and in hair typing systems. As co-washing has become more popular, consumer demand has spawned a new hair product, the \\"cleansing co-wash\\", which proponents claim removes buildup from the hair and scalp without the harsh \\"stripping\\" or drying effects of traditional shampoo. Massey's book also includes techniques for cutting curly hair, such as cutting the hair when dry rather than wet.Massey, p. 97 Related hair cutting techniques include the Deva cut, Ouidad cut, and RI CI cut. Other authors have written curly hair care guides which focus on specific hair types. Curly Like Me: How to Grow Your Hair Healthy, Long, and Strong by Teri LaFlesh provides natural hair care tips especially for tight curls. Better than Good Hair: The Curly Girl Guide to Healthy, Gorgeous Natural Hair by Nikki Walton focuses on Afro-textured hair. Writers at the Naturally Curly website provide hair care advice based on curl pattern, porosity, and other factors. The curly girl method also requires one to know one's hair porosity. There are low, medium and high hair porosity. Low hair porosity is when the hair cuticles are tightly shut. Low porosity hair has difficulty obtaining moisture but once moisture is absorbed it will remain moisturized. This porosity type is common with hair that has suffered little to no damage (either from heat styling tools or from chemicals) and thus it is the preferred porosity level. Medium porosity hair is when the hair cuticles are loose, allowing moisture to be easily absorbed and retained. High porosity is when there are gaps in the hair cuticles which allows the hair to easily absorb the moisture but also easily lose the moisture just as easily as it was absorbed. These gaps are caused by long term damage to the hair from things like over-manipulation, heat damage and chemical damage from hair dyes and relaxers.

According to Mohammad Esfandiari, director of communications and public relations of Iran's Martyrs and Disabled Veterans’ Organization, there are 548,499 disabled veterans of the Iran–Iraq War living in Iran as of June 2014, a number which includes the victims of Iraq's chemical weapon attacks on Iran. The latter are called \\"chemical janbaz\\" (). Chemical Janbaz receiving oxygen by mask. Chemical warfare veterans After Iraqi chemical attacks against Iranian soldiers and civilians, from 1983 to 1988, the number of people suffering injuries, including respiratory (42%), ocular (39%) and skin complications (25%) was more than 3,400 – a number which increased to at least 45,000 twenty years later, \\"due to the occurrence of late respiratory complications of mustard gas exposure.\\" \\"The latency period can be as much as 40 years\\" and \\"So almost every day there are new cases — 30 years after the war,\\" said Shahriar Khateri, the co-founder of the Society for Chemical Weapons Victims Support. According to Farhad Hashemnezhad in 2002, at least 20 percent of the patients were \\"civilians who didn’t think they were close enough to be exposed.\\" This large number of chemically affected veterans has made Iran the world's largest laboratory for the study of the effects of chemical weapons. According to a declassified CIA report, as a result of Iraq's repeated use of nerve agents and toxic gases in the 1980s, Iran suffered more than 50,000 casualties mostly by mustard gas used in dusty, liquid and vapor forms packed into bombs and artillery shells which were then fired at the front lines and beyond, at targets such as hospitals. The number of registered chemically affected veterans was 70,000 by 2014, according to Shahriar Khateri, Iran's leading expert on chemical weapons victims. \\"awareness could have saved lives,\\" Khateri said. Doctors estimate that the final toll of Iraq's chemical weapons could be as high as 90,000, equal to the total deaths from all toxic gases in World War I. During the Iran–Iraq War, mustard gas was used by Iraq against Iran, and it was the \\"first time ever that nerve agents such as sarin and tabun were employed.\\" Experiencing the outcomes of the chemical weapons, chemical warfare veterans believe that the younger generations should be instructed that \\"war is not a computer game.\\" \\"We want to show how painful the consequences are. We don't want revenge. We just want to show what happens so it won't happen again,\\" said Saadi, injured by Iraqi mustard gas. Psychiatric veterans The number of mentally disabled veterans including those who suffer from PTSD is increasing some of them increasingly showing signs of mental issues and the mental health conditions have worsened with age in others. Services In Tehran alone there are very few wheelchair- accessible ramps, elevators and parking spots and the problem is more serious in smaller cities. This is while over 5,000 disabled Iranian veterans, mostly living in the capital, are restricted to wheelchairs for mobility. According to the Tehran Metro Group many more elevators are needed in Tehran's subway system. To provide better services for disabled veterans, the Iranian government has announced that around $5 million has been dedicated to constructing ramps and wheelchair-accessible paths throughout Tehran. No similar official plans are dedicated for other cities in Iran. In Tehran, chemical weapons victims are often referred to the Sasan Hospital. The Tehran Peace Museum plans to focus on the enduring human consequences of Iran–Iraq War and serves as a centre for surviving victims of the war, especially chemical warfare veterans attacked by Saddam Hussein's forces. In addition to numerous laws and regulations the Iranian government has passed to address disability related issues, the Disability Protect Act, including 16 articles providing legal protections for disabled persons in areas such as public building access, education, housing and finance, has been Iran's most progressive and comprehensive legislation concerning disabled persons which was passed in 2003. The Janbazan Foundation is created by Iran government for the assistance of Iranian disabled veterans and for giving them special treatment. They also receive services such as financial loan from Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs. In popular culture Veterans are presented with awards and are thanked for their service on formalities such as ceremonies which are plentiful and widely covered in the Iranian media, particularly on two annual national occasions, namely Disabled Veterans’ Day in May and Sacred Defence Week (Sept. 20–27), which commemorates the commencement of the Iran–Iraq War. According to the supreme leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, \\"disabled war veterans are images of the war crimes of big powers who encouraged former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein to invade Iran.\\" See also * Wounded in action * Martyr * Iraq chemical attacks against Iran * Az Karkheh ta Rhein, Iranian movie * Ra’ad Rehabilitation Goodwill Complex References Category:Iran–Iraq War Category:Disability in Iran Category:Chemical weapons Category:Veterans' affairs ","title":"Disabled Iranian veterans"},{"id":"49121395","title":"Nilakkal"},{"id":"49121396","text":"DJ Colin Francis (born 16 January 1976) is a DJ and music producer from Essex specialising in dance, hip-hop, pop and R&B.; In November 2015, Colin Francis supported 50 Cent as his opening act for a three city UK Tour.

She creates large scale landscapes and abstract works using a three step process of painting, collage, and machine stitching. Background and education Barbara Lee Smith was born in Camden, New Jersey and grew up in nearby Cape May. Her early interests included music, embroidery and the work of Jackson Pollock who she was first exposed to in a 1949 Life magazine article. Smith majored in home economics at Douglass College (then the women's college of Rutgers University). She married soon after graduating in 1959 and, as a young wife and mother, lived on Long Island, New York and then in Levittown, New York. In Levittown she had easy access to New York City where art exhibitions, most notably a Kandinsky show at the Guggenheim Museum, made an impact. During this period she taught herself machine embroidery. In the late 1960s, Smith moved to Chicago where she resided for three decades near the shore of Lake Michigan. She started teaching contemporary embroidery and design and returned to college in 1970, attending graduate school at Northern Illinois University where she received a MFA degree in mixed media in 1978. In 2000, Smith and her second husband, Mel, relocated to the Pacific Northwest, where they live and work on Raft Island, west of Tacoma, Washington. Life and work Smith has worked as a self-employed studio artist since 1979. From her work in Chicago, which featured architectural elements, to her work in the Pacific Northwest, with its imagery of land, sea and sky, her work is ethereal and technically adept. In reviewing a 2009 exhibition of Smith's work, Carla Seaquist wrote: > In essence a seeker, Barbara's artistic purpose is to retrieve those lost > things - meaning, mattering, beauty, wit, a sense of the sacred ... Barbara > has been faithful to her inner landscapes. It's why her work resonates so > deeply: she shows us profound things the modern world has forgotten but > desperately needs. Since 1975, her work has been featured in over 25 solo exhibitions in the US, UK, New Zealand and Japan. She's participated in dozens of invitational group exhibitions including the Bellevue Art Museum Fiber Biennial, Korea Quilt Festival and the Beijing Art Salon. In a review of a 1989 group exhibition on Long Island, The New York Times called Smith's work \\"off beat and personal.\\" > ... her work cannot be pigeonholed into any category.

Marshland - Twilight (2010) by Barbara Lee Smith; 49.5\\" x 39\\" [private collection] photo by Tom Holt Smith also contributes to her field through teaching and curatorial work. From 2000-2005, she served as a visiting professor in the Department of Design and Embroidery at Joshibi College of Art and Design in Tokyo; conducted workshops and lectures at Stik Plus in the Netherlands between 1999 and 2014; and served as a visiting lecturer at Windsor College, England between 1991 and 2004. She has curated textile exhibitions in Massachusetts, Chicago, New Zealand, and North Carolina. Smith authored the book Celebrating the Stitch: Contemporary Embroidery of North America, published by Taunton Press in 1991. It outlines the movement of embroidery from the home into the artist's studio through a series of interviews with textile artists. The book includes a range of textile mixed media examples; it also explores creative issues and how to address them. A Gathering of Light (2015) by Barbara Lee Smith; 49.5\\" x 39\\"; photo by Igor Beschieru Smith has been honored for her work by the Pierce County (Washington) Art Commission's Career Award, named an honorary member of the Embroiderers' Guild of England, as well as Distinguished Resident by the Ragdale Foundation. A lengthy 2009 interview with Smith, part of the Archives of American Art Oral History Program, is available from the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art. Smith writes: \\"a personal goal has been to help the field of textiles be recognized as a major art form and to see that those who use fiber as their primary medium are recognized within the larger world of art.\\" In 2015, Smith wrote about the evolution of her work: > Growing up in Cape May, New Jersey brought me into everyday contact with the > Atlantic Ocean, and much of my life has been spent finding my way from one > coast to the other. The urge to be near salt water infused my work while > living in Chicago for many years, and as I finally landed more than fifteen > years ago in the Pacific Northwest on a small island in Puget Sound, my work > evolved from non-representation images to evocations of the land, sea and > sky. Daybreak (2013) by Barbara Lee Smith; 6' x 4'; photo by Tom Holt Technique Smith uses a single material: an industrial grade polyester non woven fabric, Lutradur. She uses it as a canvas for acrylics and silk-paint pigments chosen for light fastness. She creates a painting on the tough fabric, then bonds several layers together to form a base on which she collages small pieces of the painted material, heat setting them in place.

Best known for his works Death of a Boxer (2009), Till Death (2012) and Theeb (2014) for which he received wide spread acclaim and recognition, including a Best Foreign Language Film nomination at 88th Academy Awards, nomination for Best film not in the English language, and the BAFTA Award for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer at the 69th British Academy Film Awards. Theeb is the first Jordanian film to receive an Oscar nomination. Biography Abu Nowar was born in Oxford in 1981, from a Jordanian military family. He is the youngest of thirteen half- siblings.http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/film/article4698392.ece As a child, he heard stories from his father about chivalrous and courageous Bedouin warriors, which later influenced his film making. In an interview with The Times' Kate Maltby, he said: \\"I’ve always had a sympathy for people caught between different pressures.\\" When Abu Nowar was 10 years old, his family moved to Jordan. He later returned to England to complete his A Levels and attend King's College London where he focused on war studies. He used some of the strategic and organizational skills acquired at college during the making of his movie, Theeb. Early in his career, Abu Nowar and his friend Rupert Lloyd got jobs laying dance floors. When they won their first BAFTA, they would dance on a floor they had constructed years earlier at the Grosvenor House Hotel. Abu Nowar returned to Amman in 2004, where he took up residence. Career In 2005, Abu Nowar was accepted into the RAWI Screenwriters lab, a project sponsored by the Royal Film Commission and the Sundance Institute to support film makers. With this support, he developed his first screenplay Shakoush\\" (Hammer). In 2009, Abu Nowar wrote and directed Death of a Boxer, an eight-minute film that appeared at The Palm Springs International Shortest, The Dubai International Film Festival, the Miami Short Film Festival, and the Franco-Arab Film Festival. Following the success of Death of a Boxer, Abu Nowar had difficulty launching his next project, due to funding issues and ideas that were not strong enough to come to fruition. He had co-written a Bedouin western with Rupert Lloyd in 2003, but it was not until he met producer and screen-writer Bassel Ghandour that the idea for Theeb came together. The two decided to adapt a screenplay, written by Ghandour, into a full-length feature film. Abu Nowar describes the film Theeb as a \\"Bedouin Western\\", with nods to Akira Kurosawa's samurai films and American westerns. During the writing of the film, Abu Nowar, Ghandour and Lloyd lived for a year in Wadi Rum and Wadi Arabeh located in southern Jordan to meet local Bedouins and better understand their folklore in an attempt to portray the people and their way of life authentically. Funding, though inadequate, was secured by private sector investors, as well as several institutions: King Abdullah II fund for development, Doha film institute and Abu Dhabi-based Sanad film fund. The film, released in 2014, received widespread acclaim and recognition for its success. Abu Nowar dedicated the film to artist and architect Ali Maher, an iconic figure in Jordan. Maher, who offered support to Abu Nowar when he first arrived in Jordan in 2004, died in 2013 and only got to see the movie's trailer. In February 2015, Abu Nowar was among the honorees who were invited by King Abdullah and Queen Rania to Al Husseiniya Palace, for an event in which the attendees were praised for their entrepreneurship and good citizenship. Abu Nowar has plans for future films and hopes to feature Bedouin women, which was previously frowned upon by the Bedouin community.

It holds conferences about new developments in traffic separation and satellite navigation. It has charitable status and a Royal charter. History The organisation was formed in 1947 as the Institute of Navigation and was patterned after the US Institute of Navigation. Both organizations had been influenced by the role navigation had helped in moving troops and supplies during Second World War. Emerging technology such as radar and LORAN increased in the years following the war. The Institute sought to provide a forum where academics, engineers, mariners, and pilots could learn, exchange information, and share personal experiences. The Institute's founding membership included several notable professionals in the field. From the field of astronomy Sir Harold Spencer Jones, the Astronomer-Royal was the first president. The first two vice-presidents represented the field of aviation in Air Chief Marshal Sir John Slessor (Deputy Chief of the Air Staff) and the development of radar in Sir Robert Watson-Watt. Marine navigation was represented by Michael Richey who became the first Executive Secretary. The following year Richey would found the Institute's official academic publication, the Journal of Navigation.s. Journal of Navigation.

Arriving in New Amsterdam Nick and Pete learn that there is hostility between the settlers and the Native Americans. After a brief meeting with Maria and Janet Dangola who invite them for Christmas dinner they next attempt to deliver the ring to Elizabeth but are unable to find her. As there is no lodging available Nick and Pete decide to sleep in a barn where they meet Marlene, a young girl whose parents were kidnapped by Native Americans. Hitching their horses to an old carriage Nick and Pete attend a meeting with the governor and learn there are plans to attack the Native Americans and after Nick asks to meet the Native Americans the governor spitefully takes their horses and gives them a single reindeer as replacement. On Christmas Eve Nick, Pete and Marlene visit the Dangola family with presents for the children. Pete begins to fall in love with Janet, while the reindeer they have named Vixen attracts 3 other reindeer. Nick and Pete travel to the Native American camp and Nick is identified by them as the Man with the White Beard who brings peace and prosperity and could fly. After requesting the Native Americans return Marlene's parents for the sake of peace and safety of the children the Native Americans give Nick a bright red coat as thanks. Nick and Pete begin delivering presents and find that the village tanner has made Nick some black leather boots. Arriving at the governor's house they realise there are no traditional wooden clogs to put gifts in and instead decide to go down the chimney and leave gifts in stockings instead. They also meet the governor's maid, who turns out to be Elizabeth Van Olden, and after giving her the engagement ring she gives Nick a bright red hat. Returning to the Dangola house the Native Americans appear with Marlene's parents just as it starts snowing. Unable to navigate the snow in their carriage, Maria's husband, Big Manuel, replaces the wheels with runners, transforming it into a sleigh, now with 6 reindeer. As Santa and Pete leave, the sleigh suddenly lifts into the sky and they fly away into the night. Back in the present Terence wakes up in the middle of the night and finds that the Book of Life is in the living room. He finds his name inside but when he tries to tell Grandpa Nicolas the book disappears and he cannot remember anything he read.

The Brasiliano orogeny is a regional name for the larger Pan-African/Brasiliano orogeny that extended not only in South America but across most of Gondwana. In a wide sense the Brasiliano orogeny includes also the Pampean orogeny. Almeida et al. coined the term Brasiliano Orogenic Cycle in 1973. The orogeny led to the closure of several oceans and aulacogens including the Adamastor Ocean, the Goianides Ocean, the Puncoviscana Ocean and the Peri-Franciscano Ocean. Attempts to correlate the South American Brasiliano belts with the African Pan-African belts on the other side of the Atlantic has in many cases been problematic.

This vessel should not be confused with several other steamers named Enterprise which operated in the Pacific Northwest at about the some time. Construction In 1863, a new independent steamer, the Enterprise, was built at Canemah, Oregon by Capt. George A. Pease, backed by a company formed by Capt. Charles. W. Pope (1831-1871), Capt. Nat H. Lane, Sr. (1823-1878), C. Friendly, Judge Riley E. Stratton, C. Crawford, James Wilson, C.W. Rea, and S. Ellsworth. Enterprise, the second steamer of this name to operate on the Willamette, was launched in November 1863, and ran independently for a short time under George Pease. Dimensions Enterprise was 120 or 125 feet long, exclusive of the extension of the main deck over the stern, called the fantail, on which the stern-wheel was mounted. The beam (width) was 24 feet, and the depth of hold was four feet. Gross tonnage was 194. The official merchant vessel registry number was 8141. Engineering Enterprise was equipped with twin steam engines, single-cylinder, horizontally mounted, each with bore of and stroke of , 13 nominal horsepower. Operations Soon after Enterprise was launched, an accommodation was reached with the dominant steamer line on the Willamette, the People's Transportation Company, after which Pease remained in command for over two years. In 1866, the P.T. Company purchased Enterprise outright from its original owners. As of October 27, 1866, steamers of the People’s Transportation Company, Enterprise, Echo, and Active departed Oregon City every Monday and Thursday for Salem, Albany, and Corvallis. In March 1867, recent high water in the river had changed the channels leading to Eugene, and created a shallow bar about six miles south of Eugene, so that Enterprise, running under Capt. Sebastian Miller, was unable to reach either Eugene or Lancaster. In September 1867, the steamers Enterprise and Echo were reported to be able to make regular trips to Albany because navigation obstacles in the river had been removed. As of November 16, 1867, Enterprise was running on a winter schedule, from Oregon City to Harrisburg and Eugene every Wednesday. On December 21, 1867, it was reported that Enterprise had run aground a few miles downriver from Eugene, and that as a result of the water’s having receded with the boat still aground, it was doubted that the steamer could be refloated until the water would rise again. However, the vessel was freed, and returned to Oregon City on Friday, December 27, 1867, with no apparent damage. In late January, 1868, ice coated the Willamette River. Enterprise came downriver on January 25, 1868 and had to break a channel in the ice from Rock Island to the boat basin at Oregon City. Financial success Enterprise was highly successful financially, earning a 33.3% profit in its first year of operations, and 66.6% in the second year, with a dividend of $50 a share, When Enterprise was purchased by P.T. Co., the original owners received $280 in P.T. stock for every $100 of Enterprise stock. Disposition Enterprise was dismantled in 1875 at Canemah.

It was first released in the United Kingdom and France for the MSX in 1984, and was re-released for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum in 1985. It is the second instalment of the Strategic Wargames series. The game is set during the Battle of Midway in the Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II and revolves around the United States Navy attacking a large Imperial Japanese fleet stationed at Midway Atoll, in retaliation for the attack on Pearl Harbor. In the game, the player assumes control of American forces and must eliminate all Japanese forces around the atoll by air or naval combat. The Battle For Midway received largely negative reviews upon release. It was criticised for its incompatibility with black and white television sets, as the game was only accessible in a limited range of colours. The easy difficulty of the gameplay was also criticised. Gameplay A map showing combat around Midway Atoll. The game is a turn-based strategy and focuses on naval battles during the Battle of Midway, which is initiated in response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The player commands three American task forces; two United States Navy forces and one United States Air Force unit, which are stationed on Midway Atoll. The objective of the game is to defeat three attacking Imperial Japanese naval forces. Each American task force has an aircraft carrier, whereas the Japanese have four. The player begins the game with two American search aircraft used to locate and track the attacking Japanese forces. When the main attacking Japanese force has been located, the player must send all available air units to engage them in combat. Air combat takes place over real time, and may take up to a minute of travel time once launched from an aircraft carrier. Aircraft will run out of fuel over time and will crash if not refuelled at a carrier. The game contains elements of arcade gameplay, which will automatically enable once the player comes into contact with the enemy. The arcade sequences involves the player utilising an anti-air machine gun in order to shoot down Japanese aircraft. The game ends once all four Japanese aircraft carriers have been destroyed. Background and release Personal Software Services was founded in Coventry, England, by Gary Mays and Richard Cockayne in 1981. The company was known for creating games that featured historic war battles and conflicts, such as Theatre Europe, Bismark and Falklands '82. The company had a partnership with French video game developer ERE Informatique, and published localised versions of their products to the United Kingdom. In 1986, Cockayne took a decision to alter their products for release on 16-bit machines, as he found that smaller 8-bit computers, such as the ZX Spectrum, lacked the processing power for larger strategy games. The decision was falsely interpreted as \\"pulling out\\" from the Spectrum market by video game journalist Phillipa Irving. Following years of successful sales throughout the mid 1980s, Personal Software Services experienced financial difficulties, in what Cockayne admitted in a retrospective interview that \\"he took his eye off the ball\\". The company was acquired by Mirrorsoft in February 1987, and was later dispossessed by the company due to strains of debt. Upon release, The Battle For Midway was packaged with an exclusive ring-binder and a manual detailing the nature of the Battle of Midway. It was later re-released as part of a Strategic Wargames compilation cassette known as Conflicts 2, published by Personal Software Services. Reception The game received negative reviews upon release. Angus Ryall of Crash criticised the game's incompatibility with black and white television sets, stating that, despite a growing British economy, Ryall expected the developers to have designed games for \\"the lowest common denominator\\". Gwyn Hughes of Your Sinclair criticised the tactical elements of the game as too light, stating that the success of the player depends on dexterity, and not \\"brainpower\\". Clare Edgely of Sinclair User praised the game's historical accuracy, however she felt that its late release in comparison to other wargames made The Battle For Midway feel \\"ordinary\\". A reviewer of Your Computer stated that the game was a \\"flawed\\" attempt to recreate the famous Battle of Midway, despite admitting that it contained \\"some nice touches\\". A reviewer of Australian Commodore Review praised the game's wide range of features such as the save and load functions. However, they criticised menu designs and \\"insufficiently integrated\\" arcade sequences, calling them both \\"poor\\". Two reviewers of Your Spectrum criticised the combat sequences' reliance on the speed of pressing keys instead of the use of strategy. One reviewer considered the game to be sophisticated, however the other reviewer viewed the game's slow pace and graphics negatively. Despite the criticism, Ryall praised the real time element of the game and accessibility, saying that The Battle For Midway is up to \\"current standards\\". A reviewer of Amstrad Action praised the game's \\"accurate\\" reproduction of events and different levels of speed, however criticised the easy predictability of Japanese forces. A reviewer of Amtix stated that the game suffered from \\"average\\" graphics and \\"poor\\" sound, and also questioned the inclusion of the arcade sequences. A reviewer of Your 64 recommended The Battle for Midway for beginners to the genre, despite stating that it was \\"not a simple game\\". A reviewer of Commodore Horizons called it an \\"enthralling\\" game.

In an attempt to make up for lost time, it was travelling in excess of when a tyre blew out and it crashed, killing 12 passengers. The subsequent court case was subjected to a 13-year delay, becoming one of the lengthiest legal cases in France. Accident Montego European Travel, based in Wetley Rocks, Staffordshire, began business with two buses in April 1990. They were leased to Telford-based Pineda Holidays. One of its vehicles, a 76-seat double-decker coach – containing sixty-nine passengers from the West Midlands or Liverpool between the ages of 9 and 76; six guides; and a driver – was on a return trip to Birmingham from Nîmes with sources stating that it was making its return from Costa Brava, Spain. The coach had passed an inspection in July 1989 and was due for another the following July. Whilst travelling along the main north-south portion of the A6 autoroute, south of Paris at 8:00am, the coach's front driver's side tyre suffered a blowout at , over the legal speed limit, as the driver attempted to make up for lost time. The coach crashed into a ditch, flipped over to its side, and slid more than before going through concrete fence posts and stopping in a wheat field. It took four hours to extract passengers trapped in the wreckage. Just prior to the accident, passengers voiced their concern at the coach's excessive speed and erratic movement to a courier, but were ignored. Casualties Eleven passengers were killed and 61 injured, 33 of whom were hospitalised overnight. Of those who died, six passengers were from Telford, Shropshire, and five from the West Midlands – one from Oldbury, the rest from Wolverhampton. A majority of them were sitting in the front of the bus. The victims were between the ages of 10 and 68. The driver, John Johnston from Stoke-on-Trent, was seriously injured but survived. A news article in the Evening Standard claimed that he had been driving for the company for ten days and had been licensed to drive this type of vehicle for over two years. One of the dead, an 18-year-old woman, was 17 weeks pregnant. The tyres were later found to be under-inflated but in good condition. At that time, it was compulsory for all buses built after 1988 to be equipped with speed limiters. Those built between 1984 and 1988 were required to have limiters by 1 April 1990; those built between 1974 and 1983 by 1 April 1991. Coaches were not required to have seat belts; at the time their use was opposed by a majority of the European Union. The accident was the worst road accident in France since a 1982 crash when 53 people, including 44 children, died when their bus caught fire following a pile-up near Beaune. Legal proceedings Manslaughter charges were initially brought against John Johnston, the driver of the bus; Melvin Eardley, the owner of Montego European Travel; and Anthony Mitchard, chief executive of Avon Rubber, which manufactured the tyres. The charges against Mitchard and Eardley were dropped in 2001 and 2002, respectively. After arguments about blame and various legal errors, Johnston was tried in Sens in 2003, thirteen years after the accident. Although the prosecutor acknowledged that the delay was \\"scandalous\\" and stated that the families of accident victims could seek damages from the French government, the presiding judge rejected defence arguments that the case should be dismissed. Johnston was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and received a suspended sentence of 30 months in prison and a five-year driving ban. Following the rejection of Johnston's appeals in the French courts, a British inquest ruled the case an accidental death in October 2006. Johnston had died of natural causes the previous August at the age of 68.

It is based in Stevenage and part of the Archant group. The vast majority of its copies are delivered locally or picked up as a free newspaper, but it is also sold. It is published each Thursday in three editions—one concentrates on the Stevenage area, another focuses on Hitchin and a third pays particular attention to Letchworth and Baldock. Nick Gill has been editor since January 2017; previous permanent editors were Darren Isted (2002–14) and John Francis, who retired in June 2016. The paper was formed in May 1971 as the successor to the long- established Hertfordshire Pictorial, a paid-for weekly whose three editions covered Letchworth and Baldock, Hitchin and Stevenage. The free paper was originally named the Stevenage Sun, Hitchin Sun or Letchworth Sun, depending on the edition. The Comet name was adopted after less than a month after the national newspaper The Sun threatened legal action. Subsequent attempts by the Surrey Comet to prevent the Comet name being used were seen off. The Comets average circulation, counting all three editions together, was 66,791 in 2014—29,087 for the Stevenage edition, 17,953 for Hitchin, and 19,751 for the Letchworth and Baldock version. Of those 98.4% were delivered or picked up free and 1.6% were paid for.

Such calculations are used by psephologists and media for the purposes of detecting changing voting patterns and swings from one party to another from one election to the next, which is easier to calculate when no boundary changes have been implemented. Use in United Kingdom elections Boundary reviews can favour a particular political party, as notional election calculations have found. In the case of the United Kingdom, the Conservative Party usually benefits slightly due to population shifts away from inner cities towards suburban areas, where the Conservative Party has a stronger vote base. Consequently, representation in inner city areas - usually areas where the Labour Party has its strongest voter base - declines as its population declines. Notional election result calculations are of particular importance in the United Kingdom because the country is unusual in not releasing official breakdowns in voting data, which enables such data to be applied to electoral areas which are subject to boundary changes. Parliamentary constituencies are based on smaller local government wards, and it is the results from local government elections that are the primary source used to calculate notional results at a constituency level. Professors Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher of Plymouth University have been involved in calculating notional results for general elections since 1992 where periodic boundary changes have taken place. The data compiled from their work has been used by several prominent media companies including television channels for the purposes of comparing one general election result to the last. Notional results have their limitations in that voting patterns may well have been different had new boundaries been in force at previous elections, because some voters who vote tactically may have chosen to vote differently under different boundaries, depending on which political parties or candidates were most competitive under old boundaries. Other problems with making notional calculations is that people vote differently between national and local elections, particularly as many councilors enjoy a cross-party personal vote. Local factors can also have a great effect on voting patterns. In addition, a large number of wards are not contested by all the major political parties, some of them electing independent candidates or candidates from residents' associations. Sometimes wards themselves are subject to boundary changes. On a national level, notional general election results by constituency have been calculated in the UK on numerous occasions in the past by academics and election experts such as Rallings and Thrasher, when boundary changes have been implemented. In the February 1974 general election, notional results from the previous general election in 1970 were calculated on behalf of the BBC in constituencies where major boundary changes took effect. In 1983, extensive boundary changes led to notional general election results being jointly calculated by the BBC and ITN for the previous general election in 1979. Further notional results were created for the 1997 general election (to compare with the 1992 general election), in 2005 (to take into account the reduction in the number of Scottish constituencies brought about by the establishment of the Scottish Parliament), and in the 2010 general election (to compare with the 2005 general election).

Essen got into influence of Pietism at an early age. He studied theology but his views which differed from the official line of the church delayed his ordination. As a priest, Essen was an active member in the Pietistic movement. In the early 1850s he got into doctrinal conflict with the leader of the movement Nils Gustaf Malmberg and got closer to the official church. Essen took part in development of the Finnish hymnal, both in Finnish and Swedish, and he represented Estate of Clergy in Diet of Finland. Later Essen worked as university professor of theology.  Early life and studies  Essen was born in Oravais, Vaasa Province. His parents were lieutenant Otto Mauritz von Essen, a member of the Essen family, and Brita Christina née Thodén. Essen got the first influence of Pietism from a well-known preacher, Jonas Lagus. He did his matriculation exam in 1830. Essen went to study theology and in 1837 he graduated Bachelor of Theology. When he continued his studies he formed a group of university Pietists with Lars Stenbäck and Julius Immanuel Bergh. During 1839–1840 they published Pietistic newspaper called Evangeliskt Veckoblad. Consequently, officials and church became suspicious towards Essen and Porvoo Cathedral Chapter refused giving him ordination in 1838. But after Essen graduated Master of Theology in 1840 with excellent grades, the Turku Cathedral Chapter decided to ordinate him.  Career = Clerical career = Essen started his clerical career working as priest in west Uusimaa. Later he moved to Ostrobothnia to Ylihärmä and Ilmajoki where Pietism was in upswing. He took actively part in the movement. He criticised strongly new church order proposal of 1847, proposed by Johan Jakob Nordström; according to Essen it included such elements of hierarchy which the Pietistic movement could not accept. = Doctrinal conflicts = Since the early 1850s Essen began to criticise Pietism, and especially its leader Nils Gustaf Malmberg. The internal schism in the movement led to a split; Essen and many other young priests adopted Johann Tobias Beck's theology, that represented Tübingen school. The influence had been brought to Finland by Alfred Kihlman. Subsequently, Essen's views approached to those of the traditional Lutheran church and participated in hymnal committee of the Finnish and Swedish- speaking versions. He evaluated J. L. Runeberg's hymnal version together with Kihlman and gave a positive assessment. = Political career = Essen participated in Diet of Finland in 1863–1864 and 1872 representing Estate of Clergy. In 1876 he took part in the first synod of Finland. He was also a member in number of governmental committees. = University career = Essen got doctorate in 1864 and in 1867 he made dissertation to get a position as professor of practical theology. His thesis is about confession and it includes a lot of influence from Beck; according to Essen, only a private penance is scripturally correct. Carl Gustaf von Essen worked as a professor until 1875, after which he moved for retirement to Herniäinen estate in Hattula.  Family  Essen was married to Katalina Sofia née Arppe (1806–1894) in 1841. Their children were Lydia, married Bergroth (1842–1872), Hanna (1843–1844), Mikael (1845–1905), Elina (1847–1950), Gertrud (1849–1898) and Edvard (1850–1912).

Chapel Hill, NC: Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina, 2017. https://sph.unc.edu/files/2017/11/swanson_hpmcv.pdf He later received his M.A. and Ph.D. from Yale University in 1980 and 1985, respectively. His PhD was in sociology and his thesis was entitled \\"The moral career of the missionary,\\" later published as a book titled \\"Echoes of the call: Identity and ideology Among American missionaries in Ecuador.\\" Career Swanson first became interested in the intersection between mental illness and violence when working at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston shortly after finishing graduate school. In 1991, he joined Duke as a medical center instructor. Since 2007, he has been a tenured professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences there. Research Swanson has co-authored over 200 papers on subjects such as the epidemiology of violence and mental illness, the effectiveness of community-based interventions for people with serious psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, and causes of gun violence, as well as policies aimed at reducing it. In 1990, he led a study that found that, when excluding substance abusers, 33% of people with mental illness reported having behaved violently, as compared with only 15 percent of non- mentally-ill people. The same study found that substance abuse was a strong predictor of violence. This study has been criticized for overstating the connection between serious mental illness and violence. In 2015, he led a study that found that 8.9% of those interviewed, which would equate to roughly 22 million Americans, had both impulsive anger issues—meaning they developed \\"explosive, uncontrollable rage\\" when provoked—and easy access to guns in their homes. In 2016, he led a study analyzing data from two Florida counties that found that 72% of mentally ill people who committed suicide with a gun purchased it legally. Later that year, he published a study evaluating a 1999 Connecticut law allowing police to remove guns from people believed to be at risk of suicide. The study found that one suicide was prevented for every 10 to 20 guns seized under the law. Views Shortly after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Swanson told the New York Times that \\"Psychiatrists, using clinical judgment, are not much better than chance at predicting which individual patients will do something violent and which will not.” The following January, he told the Washington Post that “there’s a modest relative risk” for violence among people with a serious mental illness. Awards and honors Swanson received the 2011 Carl Taube Award from the American Public Health Association and the 2010 Eugene C. Hargrove, MD Award from the North Carolina Psychiatric Foundation for his career in researching mental health. He was awarded a NARSAD Distinguished Investigator Grant from the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation in 2013, and an Independent Research Scientist Career Award from the National Institute of Mental Health in 2004.

The scheme was first launched in 8 districts of the Maharashtra state in July 2012 and then across all 35 districts of the state in November 2013. It provides free access to medical care in government empanelled 488 hospitals for 971 types of diseases, surgeries and therapies costing up to Rs.1,50,000 per year per family (Rs.2,50,000 only for renal transplant). As of 17 January 2016, around 11.81 lakh procedures amounting to Rs.1827 crore have been performed on patients from 7.13 lakh beneficiary families which includes over 7.27 lakh surgeries and therapies. The scheme is called successful amid some allegations of hospitals directly or indirectly causing patients to incur out-of-pockets expenses on some part of the treatment.  History  In 1997, the then Chief Minister of Maharashtra Manohar Joshi started 'Jeevandayee Yojana' for the poor people which covered cost of treatment of very serious illnesses. But this scheme had shortcomings. This scheme was used to cover only 4 procedures related to brain, heart, kidney and cancer. Also Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) launched by the Government of India in 2008 had largely failed, while the Aarogyasri health insurance scheme of neighbouring Andra Pradesh state had become very successful. So the Maharashtra government closed the RSBY scheme, revamped the old 1997 'Jeevandayee Yojana' and modelled it on the 'Aarogyasri' scheme of the Andra Pradesh to cover 971 types of surgeries, therapies, procedures. It was renamed as 'Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee Arogya Yojana' after the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and it was launched as pilot project on 2 July 2012 over eight districts of the Maharashtra state and it covered 52.37 lakh families. These districts were Mumbai, Thane, Dhule, Nanded, Amravati, Gadchiroli, Solapur and Raigad. Under this scheme, more than 1 lakh procedures were carried out between July 2012 and October 2013. Following the success of this pilot scheme, government of Maharashtra decided to launch this scheme in all 35 districts of the state.  Overview = Introduction = RGJAY information board in an empanelled hospital The scheme was launched in all 35 districts of the Maharashtra on 21 November 2013 at Nagpur by the Indian National Congress president Sonia Gandhi in the presence of Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan, Maharashtra Health Minister Suresh Shetty, Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar, and others. The scheme now covers around 2.11 crore families from 35 districts of the Maharashtra state. Under this scheme, Maharashtra govt pays insurance premium of Rs.333 plus taxes per year per one beneficiary family to the public sector National Insurance Company towards Rs.1,50,000 health insurance policy and the benefeciary family gets medical access for 971 surgeries, therapies and procedures in the government empanelled hospitals. The scheme covers pre- existing diseases and ailments. The scheme is launched on floater basis; that means a single member of family can get free medical access costing up to Rs.150,000 in one year or whole family can get free medical access costing up to Rs.150,000 in one year. Renal transplant is treated exceptional case and government offers up to Rs.250,000 per year for this operation. In December 2015 Maharashtra govt announced increase in limit on kidney transplant expenses from Rs 2.50 lakh to Rs 3 lakh which includes medical check-up of kidney donor and receiver. Govt also announced separate funds for poor patients to undergo dialysis. = Statistics = As per RGJAY society, 6,61,333 surgeries or procedures were carried out throughout Maharashtra under this scheme until 15 November 2015 which amounted to 1641.10 crore rupees. Until December 2015, RGJAY Society had empanelled 476 hospitals across the Maharashtra state out of which 76 were government hospitals. Out of 6.62 lakh surgeries, 3.5 lakh were major surgeries and cancer surgeries ranked first followed by kidney and heart surgeries. The TISS report observed that in public hospitals 53% beneficiaries were yellow ration card holders (BPL beneficiaries) while 47% beneficiaries were orange ration card holders (non- BPL beneficiaries). The report further observed that in private hospitals, 63% beneficiaries were orange ration card holders and 37% beneficiaries were yellow ration card holders. Statistics of beneficiaries are daily updated on RGJAY Society website which reflects data since 2 July 2012 i.e. since the commencement of the scheme. As per these statistics available as of 17 January 2016, 12,48,970 patients (from 7,22,703 beneficiary families) were enrolled across the Maharashtra state out of which 11,81,066 patients were registered. The govt has incurred 1827.7 Crore rupees until 17 January 2016 for the treatment of these patients. Out of 11,81,066 patients, surgeries and therapies were carried out on 7,27,437 patients. 14,210 death cases have occurred; 5,300 patients died in govt hospitals while 8,910 patients died in private hospitals. 6169 health camps were organized across the Maharashtra state.  Eligibility  Below Poverty Line families having income less than one lakh rupees per annum and who holds either Antyodaya card or Annapurna card or Yellow or orange ration card are eligible for free medical access under this scheme. The scheme does not cover Above Poverty Line families which holds white ration card. Data from valid card coupled with Aadhar card is used to issue 'Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee Arogya Yojana Health Card' to the beneficiary family which bears names, ages and photos of family members. Until this health card is issued, valid ration card and Aadhar card (or driving license, voter's ID card issued by the Election Commission of India) can be used to gain access to free medical care under this scheme.  Benefits  The scheme covers 971 surgeries, therapies and procedures which falls under following 30 categories: * 1 General surgery * 2 ENT surgery * 3 Ophthalmology surgery * 4 Gynaecology and obstetrics surgery * 5 Orthopedic surgery and procedures * 6 Surgical gastroenterology * 7 Cardiac and cardiothoracic surgery * 8 Pediatric surgery * 9 Genitourinary system * 10 Neurosurgery * 11 Surgical oncology * 12 Medical oncology * 13 Radiation oncology * 14 Plastic surgery * 15 Burns * 16 Poly trauma * 17 Prostheses * 18 Critical care * 19 General medicine * 20 Infectious diseases * 21 Pediatrics medical management * 22 Cardiology * 23 Nephrology * 24 Neurology * 25 Pulmonology * 26 Dermatology * 27 Rheumatology * 28 Endocrinology * 29 Gastroenterology * 30 Interventional radiology Out of 971 procedures, 131 procedures are performed only in government hospitals. Illnesses which can be treated in primary health center or any other ordinary hospital are not covered under this scheme. Pneumonia is not covered, but advanced and serious forms of this disease and other lung related procedures like lobar pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, pneumoconiosis, pneumothorax, pneumonectomy, etc. are covered in this scheme. Diarrhea is not covered, but various surgical and medical gastroenterology procedures are included in this scheme. diabetes is not covered, but advanced and complicated stages of diabetes like diabetic retinopathy, diabetic ketoacidosis, uncontrolled diabetes with infectious emergencies etc. are covered under this scheme. Snakebite without ventilation support is not covered, but snakebite with ventilation support is covered under this scheme. Hernia and appendicitis are not covered, but Diaphragmatic hernia and appendicular perforation are covered. In emergency case of appendicitis, hospital may admit the patient and RGJAY Society may approve the package mentioned in the policy. In the original scheme knee replacement and hip replacement surgeries were not included. In July 2015 it was reported that the government was considering to include these surgeries in the scheme and roll out the same from November 2015.  System  Dr. Ulhas Patil Medical College And Hospital at Jalgaon - one of the RGJAY empanelled network hospital Maharashtra govt has formed 'Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee Arogya Yojana Society' (RGJAY Society) to implement and monitor this scheme in coordination with the National Insurance Company (NIC). RGJAY Society and NIC has identified eligible hospitals throughout the Maharashtra and has empanelled them to implement this scheme. As of January 2016, 488 hospitals are empanelled at 35 district places. NIC and RGJAY Society has connected all of these hospitals through a computer network with dedicated database of beneficiary families. These hospitals are referred as 'Network Hospitals'. The beneficiary patient can directly approach the network hospital. Or the patient can be referred to the network hospital by a doctor in nearby govt hospital (run by the Zilla Parishad) or by a doctor in health camp. = Network hospital = RGJAY Aarogyamitra help center in one of the RGJAY empanelled network hospital The govt has appointed 'Aarogyamitra' (Health Friend) in all network hospitals. This Aarogyamitra checks referral card, health card or any other necessary documents. If all documents are in order, the network hospital admits the patient and sends online pre-authorization request to the insurer NIC which can also be reviewed by the RGJAY Society. The preauthorization request is processed within 24 hours. In emergency cases, network hospital can give telephonic intimation to the NIC and approval can be granted immediately. Once the patient is admitted, all expenses pertaining to the patient are borne by the hospital and thereafter the hospital sends bill to the insurer NIC for reimbursement. These expenses include bed charges in general ward, nursing and boarding charges, fees of doctors involved in the treatment (surgeons, anaesthetists, medical practitioner etc.), consultants fees, cost of anaesthesia, blood bottles, oxygen, operating theater charges, cost of surgical appliances, medicines and drugs, cost of prosthetic devices, implants, X-Ray and diagnostic tests, food to inpatient, one side transport cost (from Hospital to residence of patient only by bus or railway. The scheme does not cover ambulance charges for transporting patient from home to hospital or from one hospital to another hospital.) etc. That means, the patient can walk in hospital without a single rupee in his pocket and come out after full treatment of his ailment without paying any money for anything related to his treatment. The insurer has identified 125 procedures for free follow-up consultation and medicine. If the illness of the patient falls under these 125 procedures, then the hospital also covers cost of follow-up consultation and free medicine for one year from the date of discharge of the patient. NABH audit of network hospitals is mandatory. Government hospitals which have A1 grade gets full reimbursement of expenses incurred on the patients. Other government hospitals which have grades below A1 receives more than 10% cuts in the refund. = Health camp = The process of health camps organizations is coordinated by the RGJAY Society and NIC and MDIndia Healthcare seNices acts as the third-party administrator. The venue of the health camp is identified by the district collector (or by the additional commissioner in case of BMC). Thereafter district coordinator of NIC, TPA and district health officer organizes the health camp in consultation with the network hospital and the district collector. Local NGOs can also participate in the organization of health camp. Organization of health camp is publicised through newspaper advertisements, pamphlets, local cable network, public address system etc. At least 6 MBBS doctors - 3 male and 3 female - are required to attend the patients along with 10 Aarogyamitras (5 male and 5 female). Objectives of the health camp includes identifying beneficiary families and creating awareness about the scheme among them, training generalist medical officers of primary health centers (PHCs) about 971 types of procedures so that they can refer the patients from PHCs to network hospitals after proper screening, training Aarogyamitras of PHCs about helping patients in proper documentary work etc. Basic amenities -like shade, fans, chairs, water, snacks etc. - are provided to the patients attending the camp. Network hospital is required to carry screening equipments like stethoscope, sphygmomanometer, glucometer, thermometer, ECG machine, fundoscope, pseudoscope, weigh machine, height scale, otoscope, tuning fork etc. Network hospital is also required to carry common drugs which includes ibuprofen, paracetamol, aspirin, diclofenac sodium, metronidazole, albendazole, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, ranitidine, B-complex etc. Doctors in health camp are required to carry out following investigations on the patients - hemogram, ESR, BSL, blood group, routine microscopic X-ray, fundoscopy, otoscopy, radiological ECG, USG, vision test, hearing test etc. After proper screening, if the illness of patient does not fall within 971 predefined procedures, then only free consultation is provided to the patient. If the illness falls within predefined 971 procedures, then free treatment and medicine is given to the patient in the health camp. If the patient can be treated only in the network hospital, then doctors give 'Health Camp Referral Card' to the patient which mentions all the details and date of appointment.  Updates  In February 2016, it was reported that the Maharashtra govt has decided to remove 130 procedures and add new 270 procedures in the scheme when it will sign fresh MOU with the insurance company in November 2016. Senior citizens will be the focus of new amended scheme. Govt may modify criteria of 'minimum 30 beds' to accommodate smaller hospitals in the interior area of Maharashtra. The State Government of Maharashtra launched a health insurance scheme, Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee Arogya Yojana (RGJAY) on 2 July 2012 in 8 districts of Maharashtra (Phase 1) and later on introduced to remaining 28 districts of Maharashtra (Phase 2).https://www.jeevandayee.gov.in/ The scheme is renamed as Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana from 1 April 2017.  Grievances  Under this scheme, full treatment of the beneficiary patient is supposed to be free and cashless, but as per Tata Institute of Social Sciences, 63% beneficiary patients had incurred out-of-pocket expenses for diagnostics, treatment or consumables. As per TISS, the reasons included lack of time to do paperwork, unawareness about the benefits of the scheme, lack of cooperation from the hospital staff etc. RGJAY Society denied this claim by stating that 6.62 lakh procedures were carried out, but only 6232 grievances were received which amounts to only 0.94%. The Society further said that out of 6232 grievances, 82.22% grievances were resolved. The Society has cancelled empanelment of 102 hospitals and 7 hospitals were suspended from the scheme.

Alsace autonomist movement (; ; ) is a cultural, ideological and political regionalist movement for greater autonomy or outright independence of Alsace. Purposes generally include opposition to centralist territorial, political and legal pretensions of either France (\\"Jacobin policies\\"), including the new French region Grand Est since 1 January 2016, and Pan-Germanism of Germany; or both. It instead generally favours regional decentralization including political and fiscal autonomy for Alsace, promoting the defense of its culture, history, traditions, and bilingualism of the Alsatian language. A slogan that has sometimes occurred in protests in the 21st century is \\"Elsass frei\\" (\\"Alsace free\\"). Several mass protests have taken place in public places around Alsace in opposition to the French region of Grand Est, with ratification on 1 January 2016. In addition, several Alsatian organisations and political parties have been formed to promote the cause, notably Alsace d'abord and Unser Land. The movement of greater autonomy of Alsace runs partly parallel to that of Alemannic separatism, originating in the Napoleonic era (ca. 1805–1815) and briefly revived both after World War I (1919) and after World War II (1946–1952).  History  Present location of Alsace within France. Traditional distribution of the Alsatian language as an Upper Rhine German or Alemannic dialect in the 19th and 20th century. = Background = Due to expansionist doctrines of France since the time of Louis XIV, Alsatians have been subject to many shifts in European history. Over the centuries, many figures and organisations have contributed to the cause of rejected either or both of these pretentions, promoting varying degrees of autonomy or even independence, both in public and in form of political participation. Various autonomist and separatist movements in Alsace have received support from over the political spectrum, including left, centre and right, comprising diverse political ideologies. =19th century= *Alsatian Workers and Peasants Party = World War II = The establishment of Nazi Germany and its annexation of Alsace-Lorraine during the World War II, introduced a new situation for many Alsatians, including hardships for many, such as the malgré-nous. However, some advocates of autonomy for Alsace saw the new regime as a chance to reenacted rights for the culture and autonomy of the Alsatians formerly under French government. While few were actually attracted to the anti-semitism or authoritarianism of the regime, a number of Alsatian autonomists were subsequently accused of collaboration with Nazi officials after the war, some of which were trialed, prisoned, and even executed. *:fr:Fritz Spieser (1902-1987) * :de:Paul Schall (1898-1981) * :fr:Joseph Bilger (1905-1975) * :fr:Marcel Stürmel (1900-1972) *:fr:Camille Dahlet (1883-1963) *:fr:Joseph Rossé (1892–1951) *Jean-Pierre Mourer (1897-1947) *Charles Hueber (1883-1943) *:fr:Charles Roos (1878-1940) *Eugène Ricklin (1862–1935) After war, also related groups :fr:Nanziger and :fr:Loups Noirs remain notable.

He established Al-Hoda, the largest Arabic daily in North America and facilitated Arabic printing by adapting the linotype machine to the Arabic script with his brother Salloum. Mokarzel was a strident and impassioned writer who used his publishing house to print a number of books and to circulate Maronitism and Lebanese nationalism. He was involved in a number of sectarian brawls and legal disputes particularly with the publishers of rival Arabic New York-based newspapers, and his unwavering stances and criticism of the Syro-Lebanese diaspora community often engendered controversy and politico-sectarian division. Biography=Youth in Mount Lebanon= Mokarzel was born into a Maronite Catholic family from the town of Freike in Mount Lebanon, then a semi-autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire. His father Antoun, a Maronite priest, and his mother Barbara Mokarzel née Akl were influential figures in local civic and political affairs.Mokarzel 1968, p. 123Mokarzel 1932, p. ز Mokarzel attended school at the Collège de la Sagesse in Beirut and received higher education at the Jesuit Saint Joseph University in Beirut. After graduation, Mokarzel moved to Cairo, Egypt where he landed a job teaching literature at the Jesuit college; he became ill with fever after a year there and returned to his hometown in 1886 where he founded a boarding school. Mokarzel's return to Lebanon was brief and he soon decided to move to the United States. Mokarzel traveled with two relatives, Abdo Rihani and the latter's nephew, Ameen, who would become a major figure in the Mahjar literary movement.Mokarzel 1968, p. 124Mokarzel 1932, p.حJacobs 2015, location: 1705 =In New York, early careers and turmoil= On August 4, 1888, Mokarzel and the Rihanis landed in New York; they lived in the basement of 59 Washington Street in Manhattan, a part of the city that was known as Little Syria due to the settlement of a growing Arab Christian immigrant population.Jacobs 2015, location: 1673 The majority of the Syrian and Lebanese immigrants were of modest background and resorted to petty jobs, such as peddling. By contrast, Mokarzel hailed from the Beiruti elite.Fahrenthold 2009, p. 6 The Jesuit- educated Mokarzel, who was fluent in French, was quickly hired to teach the language at the Saint Francis Xavier's College in Manhattan, a Jesuit institution at the time. Besides teaching, he was also employed as a bookkeeper for different businesses before engaging in a dry goods commerce venture with Abdo Rihani in 1891. The business failed and Mokarzel consequently departed for Mount Lebanon in 1892.Mokarzel 1932, p. طJacobs 2015, location: 1712 Upon his return to the United States, the Arbeelys, a Greek Orthodox family of Damascene origins, had begun printing Kawkab America (American Star), the first Arabic-language newspaper in North America; Mokarzel set out to open his own newspaper Al-ʿAsr (The Epoch) with capital from his wealthy merchant friend, Najeeb Maalouf. Mokarzel and Nageeb Arbeely engaged in a journalistic feud, personally attacking each other resulting in series of lawsuits and counter-suits between the two newspapers.Jacobs 2015, location: 5685, 5735 The enterprise floundered and was discontinued less than a year after its commencement.Jacobs 2015, location: 5602–5670 Mokarzel attended medical school for two years before dropping out.Fahrenthold 2009, p. 7 Meanwhile, Mokarzel was gaining notoriety for his controversial demeanor; he engaged in brawls and verbal disputes with other Arabic-speaking immigrants and was arrested on several occasions for libel and physical assault against members of the community affiliated with the Arbeely family. The brawls that started as a result of professional competition and personal antipathy evolved into sectarian battles between Mokarzel's Maronite entourage and the Orthodox families of the community. Despite his multiple arrests, Mokarzel was never jailed but the incidents were to continue. In 1895, Tannous Shishim, a Lebanese immigrant, petitioned for divorce from his wife Sophie on the ground of adultery and Mokarzel was named co-respondent in the court proceedings. The Arbeelys were quick to publish the culpable news in their newspaper along with a bilingual transcript of the judge's decision, further tarnishing the reputation of Mokarzel. The accused couple got married and eloped to Philadelphia to flee the community's public denunciation.Jacobs 2015, location: 8602–8690 =Inception of Al-Hoda= Copy of the cover page of the first issue of \\"Al-Hoda\\" In Philadelphia on February 22, 1898, the estranged Mokarzel published the first issue of his second newspaper Al-Hoda (The Guidance), which became the longest-running Arabic newspaper in the United States. The first issue consisted of 18 pages of three columns each and appeared on a weekly basis. The publication expanded in November 1898 to 24 pages including six full pages of advertisement and was distributed in over forty countries. In early 1899, Mokarzel boasted that the circulation of Al- Hoda surpassed that of its main competitor, the Orthodox-inclined Kawkab America. Although claiming to be a non-sectarian publication, Al-Hoda was, like most of the New York-based Arabic newspapers, a mouthpiece to voice the confessional stances of the paper's owner.Jacobs 2015, location:5456–5600 Al- Hoda was aimed primarily at the Arabic-speaking Levantine immigrants, especially the Maronite community; it reported on Ottoman politics in the Levant, political reform in Lebanon and on the environment of immigrant-run businesses.Mokarzel 1968, p. 3 Mokarzel's brother Salloum traveled to the United States and joined the enterprise that same year. The format of the publication changed after Salloum's arrival; Al-Hoda began appearing twice weekly and was reduced to eight pages with more space reserved for paid advertisements. Despite his standing in the American Maronite community, infamy and controversy still followed Mokarzel. In 1899, the newlyweds published in Al-Hoda an apologetic article of Sophie's divorce from her previous husband and their subsequent marriage. However, Mokarzel's marriage was failing; he separated from Sophie on the same year that their defensive article was published and they divorced in 1902. Sophie returned to New York and took up selling linens before moving to South California where she started a linen shop and married her third husband, a Levantine confectioner. The Mokarzel brothers continued to print Al-Hoda in Philadelphia until late 1902. =Back in New York= In 1902, Naoum and his brother moved back to New York and settled in Brooklyn; they set up their newspaper's office on Manhattan's West Street. The first issue of Al-Hoda was published from the New York offices on August 25, 1902 and was since published on a daily basis.Mokarzel 1932, p. ي In 1904, Mokarzel married Ameen Rihani’s sister Saada, who according to Naoum's niece and biographer Mary Mokarzel, was very eager to marry him. Ameen Rihani brokered his sister's marriage to Mokarzel but the two never cohabited and Saada soon returned to Mount Lebanon. In 1908, Mokarzel sued for divorce from Saada in absentia on the account that she had committing adultery in a hostel in Mount Lebanon. The divorce was settled in May and was followed by a ten-year dispute in which Saada tried to prove her innocence and to win alimony. Mokarzel and Ameen Rihani had a lasting professional collaboration with Ameen publishing a regular section entitled Kashkoul al- Khawater (Patchwork of Thoughts) from 1901 until 1904. The two writers fell out because of Naoum's divorce from Saada and because of political differences and conflicting values. =Competing newspapers and sects= Mokarzel's approach to the Arab American community's other newspapers was contentious and confrontational, and he accused the editors of the other newspapers lacking integrity and professional ethics. The most frequent targets of Mokarzel's attacks were Kawkab America and Al-Islah (The Reform).Jacobs 2015, location: 5689, 5735 Mokarzel posited ever since the establishment of Al-Hoda that his newspaper was secular and independent, accusing the other Arabic US-based newspapers of being sectarian and aligned to France, Britain, Russia and to the Ottomans. This position was staunchly upheld by Mokarzel until two Maronite clergymen Yusuf Yazbek and Estephan Qurqumaz sought to publish Al- Sakhra (The Rock), a newspaper representing American Maronites. Feeling threatened by the looming publication, Mokarzel contravened his previous positions and declared that Al-Hoda had always served the Maronite sect and nation and accused the clergymen of seeking \\"personal and dishonorable purposes\\". Yazbek accused Mokarzel's newspaper of being a mouthpiece of another Maronite priest, Khairallah Stefan.Jacobs 2015, location:5653 Mokarzel and his newspaper eventually prevailed. The animosity prevailing between the newspapers representing different sects mirrored an intra-communal sectarian strife that turned violent in later years. In August 1905, Mokarzel reported that the Orthodox bishop Raphael Hawaweeny called upon his followers to \\"crush\\" him. The tensions developed into violence in the autumn of 1905 when the partisans of Hawaweeny and Mokarzel sympathizers clashed, resulting in 29 injured.Jacobs 2015, location:7326–7359 The sectarian tension in Little Syria reached its zenith in 1906 when John Stefan, brother of the priest Khairallah Stephan, was killed in a restaurant brawl on Washington Street. Mokarzel was apprehended by the police for the assault that was linked to the murder. Mokarzel's calumnious accusation and arrest were overturned as the complainant did not show up to the trial. The charge was dismissed and the police authorities settled on an Orthodox man, Elias Zreik, as the murderer.Jacobs 2015, location: 7359–7400 During Zreik's trial, the prosecution held that Elias and his brother George were sent to kill Mokarzel; when they did not find him in his office they set out to the restaurant where his Maronite sympathizers often met. =New Arabic printing era and political involvement= In 1910, the Mokarzel brothers decided to adapt the linotype machine to Arabic script to mitigate the expensive cost and tedious task of manual typesetting.Mokarzel 1968, p.2 Naoum Mokarzel imported Arabic type letters from Egypt and acquired the first such machine for Al-Hoda from the Mergenthaler company.Fahrenthold 2009, p. 7 While the linotype machine made printing cheaper, there was significant competition for readership since New York's Arabic-speaking community did not exceed 10,000 before World War II. Through his writing in Al-Hoda and other American journals, Mokarzel was gaining further prominence as a leading figure of the American Maronite community and was seeking a similarly prominent woman to marry. In 1910 he married for the third and last time; his wife, Rose Abillama hailed from a princely Maronite family and was more than twenty years his minor. Mokarzel did not have any offspring from any of his marriages.Jacobs 2015, location: 8682 In 1911, Mokarzel became the permanent president of the Lebanon League of Progress (Jamʿiyyat al-Nahda al-Lubnaniyya) a Maronite organization established in the US by Ibrahim Najjar dedicated to promote a French- supported Maronite protectorate in Lebanon.Hazam 1932, p.90Hourani 1992, p. 153Mokarzel 1932, p. ل-مGualtieri 2009, p. 92 In June 1913, Mokarzel was the Lebanon League of Progress delegate to the First Arab Congress in Paris where he represented the North American Maronites. Delegates to the congress discussed reforms to grant the Arabs living under the Ottoman Empire autonomy. The congress did not have a lasting effect, due mostly to the beginning of World War I.Khalidi 1980, pp.310–311Mokarzel 1932, p. ن In 1917, Mokarzel sought and collected through Al-Hoda more than $30,000 US in donations to relieve his compatriots in Mount Lebanon who were experiencing a great famine due to Entente and Ottoman blockades. The collected donations were to be personally dispensed by Mokarzel, but half of the money was directed to fund a volunteer armed force that was gathering to enter Lebanon instead of toward relief aid. Mokarzel incorrectly surmised that the Entente powers would come to the Maronite force's assistance, but they did not take interest in the armed venture. Mokarzel represented the Lebanon League of Progress in the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 where he advocated French tutelage over Mount Lebanon. On September 28, 1919, when the prospects of French control began to materialize, Mokarzel dispatched a fervent telegram to his New York office announcing that the French army would replace the British forces in Greater Syria and that Lebanon would come under French guardianship.Gualtieri 2009, p. 102 In 1923, on the occasion of Al-Hoda's Silver Anniversary, Mokarzel was celebrated as a leading figure by the Maronite and the non-Maronite literary community of America, as well as by a number of American friends. =Last years and death= Mokarzel's last years were marked by bed-confining illnesses. He boarded a boat to France on March 18, 1932 despite his deteriorating health condition to attend a Lebanon-related conference in Paris. Mokarzel succumbed to his illnesses on April 5, 1932. His body was sent from Paris to New York where he received a large public funeral. His body was sent to Lebanon and interred in the family cemetery in his hometown of Freike.Mokarzel 1932, p. س After his death, Al-Hoda came under Salloum's management,Mokarzel, M. 1968, p. 125 which passed at the latter's death in 1952 to his daughter Mary. The newspaper closed in 1971. Views and activism Mokarzel held an esteemed position in New York's Arabic-speaking community at a young age; his political and social views were expressed in Al- Hoda as well as other non-Arabic American newspapers. According to Suleiman, Mokarzel was an obstinate and passionate individual who fiercely clung to and defended his opinions and the survival of his publication. He sought to convert detractors to his point of view and he repeatedly made contradictory statements and opinions. Mokarzel engaged in many disputes with his detractors and with editors or rival newspapers and responded to criticism with personal attacks and sarcasm. =Immigration= In 1896 the Ottoman government lifted the ban on the emigration of its subjects, prompting a surge of immigration to the United States from the Levant. The Ottomans saw benefit in the remittances sent by the Ottoman diaspora, which boosted the economy.Jacobs 2015, location: 841 In 1898, the Ford Committee lobbied for more stringent immigrant admission criteria to the United States and proposed to the US Congress that the undesirable be turned back. These measures aimed to dampen the flow of the non-European immigrants and prompted Mokarzel to call on all the community's newspapers to stop promoting immigration because the immigrants were likely to be turned back upon arrival.Jacobs 2015, location: 941 Despite the restrictive measures, only a small fraction of Levantine Ottoman immigrants were debarred.Jacobs 2015, location: 1258 =Lebanese independence= alt=Image of tricolor flag, the flag is divided into three equal vertical bands colored from left to right: blue white and red. A green tree sits in the middle of the central white band. Mokarzel harbored tacit Lebanese separationist aspirations that he did not openly advocate until the Ottoman defeat in World War I. Before the Ottomans' fall, Mokarzel's rhetoric was more diplomatic; unlike Al- Ayam (The Days), another US-based Arabic newspaper, which was openly hostile toward the Ottoman sultan and authorities, Al-Hoda took a more cautious tone, reminding its Arabic-speaking American readers that they were above all, Ottoman settlers in a foreign land. In 1894, Mokarzel attended an event honoring the Ottoman sultan, giving an address in French to the assembled notables among whom was the Ottoman consul-general of New York. In 1899, Mokarzel criticized the newly established Young Syria Party that aimed to overthrow the Ottoman government and sought to recruit a militia for that purpose.Jacobs 2015, location: 8020,8052 At the turn of the twentieth century, Mokarzel began to openly express his disdain for the Ottoman consul in New York.Jacobs 2015, location:5825 Mokarzel represented the Lebanon League of Progress in the Arab Congress of 1913 in Paris advocating for the autonomy of Mount Lebanon within the Ottoman Empire.Gualtieri 2009, p. 16 The mistreatment of the Lebanese during World War I and the ensuing famine were turning points for Mokarzel, who afterward openly called for Lebanon's independence from the Ottomans. In 1917, Mokarzel urged his readers to join a special battalion and fight alongside France to help force the Ottomans out of Lebanon. His call for action was met with distrust and was not successful as there was a growing concern that the recruits would be exploited in occupying Mount Lebanon on behalf of the French, not liberate it from the Turks. Mokarzel then engaged in a campaign among the Lebanese communities in the diaspora, especially in the Americas, to change the name of the community and its organizations from \\"Syrian\\" to \\"Lebanese\\". Mokarzel participated in the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and advocated a French Mandate over Mount Lebanon to train the locals in good governance in preparation for independence. Mokarzel designed the flag used of Mandatory Lebanon;Hazran 2013, p. 177 his calls for the establishment of a French-supported protectorate in Lebanon caused his detractors to accuse his newspaper of being financially supported by French endowments. =Religion and sectarianism= Despite being a staunch practicing Maronite, Mokarzel had often criticized and clashed with the Maronite clergy especially al-mursaloon (the dispatched) who collected funds for the purpose of building or renovating churches in Lebanon. The Maronite clergy members were not accustomed to accountability or reproach of their actions, and thus Mokarzel's criticisms and accusations of corruption made them irate. He was subsequently accused by members of the clergy of being a Freemason. Instead of building more places of worship, Mokarzel pressed in a 1904 article for building more public and secular schools in which the clergy and religion had no influence, arguing that the priests were not serving their community. In a 1923 article, Mokarzel reasserted that secular schools were necessary to avoid sectarian antagonism and aversion between the people of the same nation. Mokarzel also called for freedom of expression and religious tolerance and used the Al-Hoda publishing house to propagate these values. In 1903, Al-Hoda published Ameen Rihani's The Tripartite Alliance in the Animal Kingdom, a book that was critical of religion. Both Rihani and Mokarzel were severely attacked by the Catholic clergy and by the editors of many rival Arabic newspapers in the United States. Notwithstanding his previous calls for secularism, Mokarzel engaged in a sectarian campaign aimed at Lebanon's Muslim population in November 1925; in a New York Times article, he called for French protection of Lebanese Christians from \\"the ruthless fanaticism of the Mohammedan element\\".Jackson 2013, p. 177 =Female literacy= In a 1904 article entitled \\"You Are What Your Womenfolk Are\\", Mokarzel adamantly called against gender discrimination against women in education and attributed the Levantine women's lack of education to the backwardness of the clergy and their authority over women, which he argued, was the root cause of the lack of progress of the Arabic- speaking community of the United States. In an attack on the role of the clergy in barring women from education and from becoming teachers, Mokarzel described the women who submit to the clergy's impositions as traitors to God, and to the mothers' purpose of upbringing. Mokarzel attacked what he called \\"false modesty\\" and how the men of the community allowed their women to peddle freely and stay out of town overnight while labeling them as immodest if they became writers of gave public lectures. Mokarzel found an ally in Afifa Karam, a stalwart woman writer whom he appointed as \\"Director of Women's Issues\\" in Al-Hoda. She contributed a regular column in the newspaper and continued writing about the community's women issues despite angry attacks and attempts to shame her. Mokarzel further encouraged female education by offering a free Al-Hoda subscription to any literate woman from the Arabic-speaking community of the United States. Mokarzel was, however, against granting women the right to vote and women's involvement in politics.Gualtieri 2009, p. 88 =Great Druze Revolt= Mokarzel was a vehement opponent of the Great Syrian Revolt of 1925 which pitted Syrian and Lebanese rebels against the French Mandatory authorities. Mokarzel formed the \\"Committee to help the Lebanese victims and the refugees\\" and initiated a fundraising campaign supervised by the Lebanon League of Progress for the benefit of Lebanese victims of the uprising from Rashaya, Hasbaya and Marjayoun. He managed to collect more than half a million dollars that were transferred to a committee in Lebanon headed by Moussa Nammour, a member of the Lebanese parliament. Meraat-ul-Gharb (The Mirror of the Occident), a rival newspaper, accused Nammour of socializing with the French and accused Nammour's organization of corruption.Bailony 2013, p. 18 Mokarzel was opposed to Emir Shakib Arslan, a leading figure of the Druze revolt, with whom he had fundamental political disagreements. He called on his readers to petition the US government to ask for the deportation of Arslan and of his delegation. Mokarzel managed to get the delegation under surveillance.Bailony 2013, p. 20 =Arab whiteness and naturalization= In 1909 Mokarzel founded the Syrian American Association to defend the eligibility of Syrians to the American citizenship.Gualtieri 2009, p.67GhaneaBassiri 2010, p. 155 Mokarzel and the SAA were engaged in the 1914 George Dow v. United states case. George Dow was an Ottoman Syrian whose application for citizenship had been rejected twice by the lower courts of South Carolina. Mokarzel and Dow's lawyer mounted an elaborate defense of five points arguing why Dow was to be in the \\"white persons\\" category.Kayyali 2006, pp. 51 Mokarzel argued that Syrians are of Arab origins, \\"the purest type of the Semitic race\\" and that therefore are \\"free white persons\\" falling within the meaning of the naturalization statute.Hourani 1992, p.195 In the final ruling, the judge in Dow's case accepted the Dillingham report which stipulated that Syrians were from the Semitic branch of the Caucasian race, that they were of mixed Syrian, Arabian and Jewish ancestry and were not from the Mongolian race of their Turkish overlords. The judge finally ruled that Syrians were \\"white persons\\", and consequently the court granted Dow American citizenship. The Dow case officially settled the issue of race and eligibility for citizenship for the early Arab Americans.Blum 2012, p. 149 Legacy By adapting the linotyope machine to the Arabic script, Mokarzel and Al-Hoda paved the way for cheaper and easier publishing for Arabic-speaking communities all throughout the world; subsequently, the New York Arabic- speaking colony became an intellectual epicenter through the preponderance of Arabic printing presses. Al-Hoda grew to be an Arabic daily with the widest circulation in North America. The New York Times wrote in 1948 that this development \\"made possible and immeasurably stimulated the growth of Arabic journalism in the Middle East\\".

The 3rd FTS is the third-oldest squadron in the Air Force, with over 95 years of service to the nation, its origins date to the organization of the 3rd Aero Squadron on 1 November 1916 at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. Deployed to the Philippines after World War I, during the 1941-1942 Battle of the Philippines, it was wiped out, with some of its personnel being forced by the Japanese to endure the Bataan Death March. It was not re-activated until 1973. Mission To qualify warriors with the skills and attitude necessary to become the world's best combat airlift and tanker pilots. History=Origins= The 3rd Flying Training Squadron dates to the organization of the 3rd Aero Squadron on 1 November 1916 at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. Most of the officers and men of the Squadron were transferred from the Aviation School at Rockwell Field, San Diego, California, where, at the time, all Army aviators were trained. There, it replaced the 1st Aero Squadron, whose members were sent to Columbus Airfield, New Mexico as part of the Punitive expedition against Pancho Villa. There, the squadron may have operated some Curtiss JN-3s and possibly some Curtiss N-8s, preparing them to be sent south to Columbus.Hennessey, Curtiss R-2 assembly at Kelly Field, Texas, 1917 In December 1916, Congress authorized the lease of a 700-acre tract of land seven miles south of San Antonio, Texas for a new airfield to accommodate the rapidly expanding Aviation Section of the Signal Corps. By March 1917, men from the 3rd Aero Squadron were hard at work clearing the cotton plants from the land and laying foundations for hangars and mess halls at what would become Kelly Field. On 5 April 1917, one day before the United States entered World War I, four Curtiss JN-4 \\"Jennies\\" landed at the new field.Kroll, On 29 August 1917 the 3rd Aero Squadron left Kelly Field for Fort Sill, Oklahoma with 12 Curtiss R4 airplanes under the command of a Captain Weir to establish a new training airfield. The squadron was assigned to Henry Post Field (named after 2nd Lt. Henry B. Post who was killed in a plane crash in California in 1914). It was re-designated as Squadron A, Henry Post Field, Oklahoma. on 22 July 1918. At Post Field, the 3rd was most likely an observer training unit in support of the United States Army Field Artillery School. In September 1917, the 4th Aero Squadron was transferred to Post Field from Fort Sam Houston, as a second training squadron. The 3rd was ordered to transfer 135 men to the 4th to bring the squadron up to its authorized strength. The 3rd was redesignated as \\"Squadron A\\", with the 4th being redesignated as \\"Squadron B\\" in July 1918. Both squadrons were demobilized at the end of World War I on 2 January 1919. =Philippines Duty= The unit was re-formed as a new unit, designated as the 3rd Aero Squadron, on 13 May 1919 at Mitchel Field, New York. Many of the men were experienced mechanics and officers who had served either in France or at training units in the United States during World War I. After being organized, the squadron was transferred by train to San Francisco, California, where it boarded a ship bound for Manila, in the Philippine Islands, arriving on 18 August. The squadron was assigned to the Philippine Department, and was stationed initially at Camp Stotsenburg on Luzon. Some Dayton-Wright DH-4s, which were used as trainers during the war in the United States, arrived later in 1919 and were assigned to the squadron.Clay, Officers of the 3rd Pursuit Squadron in formation in front of a squadron Boeing P-26 Peashooter, Clark Field, Luzon, Philippines, 1937. On 10 March 1920, along with the 2d Aero Squadron, which had arrived in December 1919, the squadrons were organized into the 1st Group (Observation). On 14 March 1921, the squadron was re- designated as the 3rd Squadron (Pursuit), its mission was to provide coastal aerial defense as part of the 4th Composite Group, a re-designation of the 1st Group. In 1924, the squadron was formally consolidated with its World War I predecessor organization, giving it a history dating to 1 November 1916. Exercises and maneuvers with Army ground forces and Naval forces were a regular and important part of its mission. In the Philippines, the squadron received a wide variety of second-line hand-me-down aircraft transferred from units in the United States during the austere years of Air Corps procurement during the 1920s and 1930sEdmonds, As a result of the rising tensions with the Japanese Empire in 1940, the defenses of the Philippines were judged to be abysmal, and a reinforcement effort was made to defend the islands against any Japanese aggression. The 3rd had received P-26 Peashooters in 1937, the latest in the line of second-line aircraft. These obsolete aircraft were replaced in early 1941 with impressed export versions of the Seversky P-35 being designated EP-106 by the company that were manufactured for the Swedish Air Force. On 24 October 1940, President Franklin Roosevelt signed an executive order requisitioning all the undelivered EP-106 aircraft and impressing them into the USAAC. These were designated P-35A by the Army, and 40 planes were sent to the Philippines during 1941 to bolster the islands' defenses. The P-35As were replaced by Curtiss P-40 Warhawks in late 1941. On 1 September 1941, the squadron was moved to the new Iba Airfield, in an effort to disperse the fighter strength of the 4th Composite Group. On 1 November, it was assigned to the new 24th Pursuit Group in a reorganization of the Far East Air Force assets in the Philippines.Watkins, =World War II= 3rd Pursuit Sqauadron P-35As at Nichols Field, Luzon, Philippines. The first word of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was received by commercial radio between 0300–0330 hours local on 8 December 1941 in the Philippines. Within 30 minutes radar at Iba Field, Luzon plotted a formation of airplanes 75-miles (120-km) offshore, heading for Corregidor Island. P-40's from the squadron were sent out to intercept but made no contact. By 1130 hours, the fighters sent into the air earlier landed for refueling, and radar disclosed another flight of Japanese aircraft 70-miles (112-km) West of Lingayen Gulf, headed south. Fighters from the 3rd made another fruitless search over the South China Sea. The P-40's sent on patrol over the South China Sea returned to Iba with fuel running low at the beginning of a Japanese attack on the airfield. The P-40's failed to prevent the bombing but did manage to prevent the Japanese Zeros from a low-level strafe of the airfield and its ground support facilities. Zero low-level strafing had proved extremely destructive at Clark Field earlier that day. The RADAR facilities at Iba, however, were destroyed in the attack. The P-40s that survived the initial Japanese attack were able to meet the Zeros on near equal terms, but the P-40 lacked the maneuverability of the lighter Japanese plane. On 9 December, the 3rd Pursuit Squadron was ordered to move to Nichols Field, to provide air defense of the Manila area. Bad weather delayed additional attacks until 10 December However, without any early warning Radar, the squadron received only a few minutes notice of a second major Japanese air attack focused on Nichols Field and the Naval facilities at Cavite. The remaining pilots prepared to meet the enemy formations. However, the standing patrols being flown had left those planes in the air low on fuel. The planes on alert took off to attempt interception however before they could reach the altitude of the attacking Japanese bombers, they were swarmed on by Zeros. Combats broke out across the sky and although outnumbered nearly three to one, the 3rd Pursuit pilots did well, downing more Japanese aircraft than they lost. However, as they ran out of fuel, they had to break off and land wherever they could find a field. By the end of the day, the strength of the entire 24th Pursuit Group consisted of twenty-two P-40s and eight P-35s. With no supplies or replacements available from the United States, ground crews, with little or no spares for repairing aircraft, used parts which were cannibalized from wrecks. Essentials, such as oil, was reused, with used oil being strained though makeshift filters, and tailwheel tires were stuffed with rags to keep them usable. The aircraft which were flying and engaging the Japanese seemed to have more bullethole patches on the fuselage than original skin. On 12 December, Nichols Field was abandoned and the squadron operated from at temporary fields in northern Bataan, and later withdrawn on 8 January to \\"Bataan Field,\\" located several miles from the southern tip of the peninsula. 24th Pursuit Group Curtiss P-40E Warhawk Bataan Airfield 1942. Bataan field consisted of a dirt runway, hacked out of the jungle by Army engineers in early 1941 and lengthened after the FEAF was ordered into Bataan. However, it was well camouflaged. It was attacked and strafed daily by the Japanese, however no aircraft were lost on the ground as a result of the attacks. Bataan Field was kept in operation for several months during the Battle of Bataan. The remaining pilots continued operations with the few planes that were left, cannibalizing aircraft wreckage to keep a few planes airborne in the early months of 1942. Many squadron members, unneeded to support the limited number of airplanes fought as infantry. With the surrender of the United States Army on Bataan, Philippines on 8 April 1942, the remainder of the 24th Pursuit Group withdrew to Mindanao Island and began operating from Del Monte Airfield with whatever aircraft were remaining. Those remaining on Luzon that surrendered to the Japanese were subjected to the Bataan Death March. The last of the group's aircraft were captured or destroyed by enemy forces on or about 1 May 1942. With the collapse of organized United States resistance in the Philippines on 8 May 1942, a few surviving members of the 3rd Pursuit Squadron managed to escape from Mindanao to Australia where they were integrated into existing units. The unit was never remanned or equipped during the war. It was carried as an active unit until 2 April 1946. =Southeast Asia= 3rd Tactical Fighter Squadron A-7 CorsairAircraft is A-7D-10-CV Corsair II serial 71-309 at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base in 1973. This plane was retired to AMARC as AE0206 15 September 1991. As a result of the successes of the A-7D Corsair II-equipped 354th Tactical Fighter Wing (Deployed) at Korat Royal Thai AFB, Thailand in the closing days of the Vietnam War, Headquarters, Pacific Air Forces requested the activation of a permanent A-7D squadron in Thailand. The Air Force, in turn, re-activated the 3rd as the 3rd Tactical Fighter Squadron at Korat on 15 March 1973, and the 354th transferred a squadron of its A-7Ds to the squadron, along with volunteer airmen who joined the host 388th Tactical Fighter Wing. 3rd TFS aircraft engaged in combat operations over Cambodia and Laos during the spring and summer of 1973, supporting friendly western governments in those nations against Communist aggression. A Congressional resolution mandated the end of United States combat over Indochina, effective 15 August 1973, and the 3rd TFS flew its last combat mission that date over Cambodia.Glasser, Logan, 3rd Tactical Fighter Squadron A-7DAircraft is serial 71-327. 429th Tactical Fighter Squadron F-111A serial 67-96 is also on the Korat Alert Ramp during the SS Mayaguez Operation in May 1975. With the end of active combat in Indochina, in March 1974, the 354th transferred several more aircraft to the 3rd TFS prior to its return to Myrtle Beach AFB. Squadron aircraft practiced bombing and intercept missions in western Thailand. A large exercise was held on the first Monday of every month, involving all USAF units in Thailand. \\"Commando Scrimmage\\" covered skills such as dog fighting, aerial refueling, airborne command posts and forward air controllers. These exercises were taken very seriously. The A-7D aircraft were pitted against the F-4 Phantom II aircraft in dissimilar air combat exercises. These missions were flown as a deterrent to the Communists in Vietnam as a signal that if the Paris Peace Accords were broken, the United States would use its airpower to enforce its provisions. The wars in Cambodia and Laos, however continued, and in the spring of 1975, Communist regimes took power in both of those nations. 3rd TFS A-7Ds along with other Thailand-based USAF aircraft provided air cover and escort during Operation Eagle Pull, the evacuation of Americans from Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and Operation Frequent Wind the evacuation of Americans and selected Vietnamese from Saigon, South Vietnam. On 14–15 May 1975, aircraft assigned to Korat (3rd TFS A-7D, 34th TFS F-4E, 428th TFS F-111A and 16th SOS AC-130) provided air cover in what is considered the last battle of the Vietnam war, the recovery of the SS Mayaguez after it was hijacked by the Cambodian Khmer Rouge communists. =3rd Tactical Fighter Wing= F-4E Phantom at Clark ABAircraft is McDonnell Douglas F-4E-49-MC Phantom serial 71-1073, in 1976 1976. This plane was retired to AMARC as FP0649 5 April 1991. It was still on the AMARC inventory 15 January 2008. The USAF presence at Korat RTAFB ended in 1975, and on 15 December, the 3rd TFS was transferred to Clark Air Base, Philippines, replacing the 68th Tactical Fighter Squadron, which had been inactivated earlier. It was the first time the squadron had been assigned to the Philippines since the surrender of American forces on the islands in April 1942. Upon its arrival at Clark, the A-7Ds were flown back to the United States to be transferred to the National Guard Bureau where they were reassigned to several Air National Guard squadrons. The 3rd was re-equipped with F-4E Phantom IIs that were transferred from other Thailand-based squadrons which were headed back to the United States. Throughout the late 1970s and the 1980s, the squadron deployed throughout the Pacific on exercises and supported the training requirements of other units. =Cope Thunder= The Mount Pinatubo eruption forced the 3rd TFW's hasty relocation to Elmendorf AFB, Alaska on 19 December 1991. The F-4Es of the 3rd TFS, however were retired and the squadron was transferred to Eielson AFB, Alaska without personnel or equipment, where it became part of the 343rd Wing. It was re- designated as the 3rd Fighter Training Squadron, and its mission became the administration of the COPE THUNDER arctic training program. It was equipped with UH-1N Huey helicopters for range support. It was inactivated on 20 August 1993 when the 354th Fighter Wing was moved to Eielson from the inactivated Myrtle Beach AFB, the personnel and equipment of the 3rd being re-designated as the 353rd Fighter Training Squadron. Ironically, it was the 363rd Tactical Fighter Squadron, deployed to Korat RTAFB, that transferred its A-7D Corsair IIs to the re-activated 3rd Tactical Fighter Squadron in March 1973 after decades of inactivation. =Air Education and Training Command= Squadron Northrop T-38AAircraft is Northrop T-38A-50-NO Talon serial 63-8118 The 3rd Flying Training Squadron was reactivated on 1 April 1994 at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. It was equipped with the Slingsby T-3A Firefly with a mission to conduct AETC's Enhanced Flight Screening Program. On 2 April 2001, it was transferred to Moody Air Force Base, Georgia where it became a T-6 Texan II primary flying training squadron as part of the 479th Flying Training Group. As a result of BRAC 2005, the 479th was inactivated on 21 July 2007. Its aircraft and equipment were redistributed to other AETC units.Rogers, The 3rd moved to Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma later in April 2007 and was redesignated the 3rd Fighter Training Squadron to provide Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals training to fighter graduate students. The 3rd lost its IFF mission when the Air Force concentrated the training at three other bases in September 2011. In September 2012, the 32d Flying Training Squadron was inactivated, and its T-1 Jayhawk training mission and personnel were taken over by the newly reactivated 3rd FTS at Vance in order to preserve the latter's heritage.

It is immediately subject to the Maronite Patriarch of Antioch (not part of any Ecclesiastical province) and the Roman Congregation for the Oriental Churches. It is currently ruled by Archeparch Georges Bou- Jaoudé, Congregation of the Mission (C.M.). Its archeparchial (archiepi scopal) seat is the Saint Michael Cathedral in the city of Tripoli (Arabic Tarabulus as-Sam) in Lebanon.  Statistics As per 2014 the archeparchy pastorally served 147,800 baptized Eastern Catholics in 126 parishes and 3 missions with 190 priests (130 diocesan, 60 religious), 206 lay religious (66 brothers, 140 sisters) and 6 seminarians.  History  The eparchy dates back to the seventeenth century, but was canonically erected in the Maronite Synod of Mount Lebanon in 1736 as Arch?Eparchy (Arch?diocese) of Tripoli / Tripoli del Libano (Curiate Italian) / Tarabulus / Tripolitan(us) Maronitarum (Latin). Initially it included all the coastal territory from Tripoli to Latakia. * In 1840 it acquired a dozen of villages from Maronite Catholic Eparchy of Byblos, by order of the Propaganda Fide. Joseph Assemani, Archbishop of Tripoli, attended the First Vatican Council in 1869–1870, called upon by Pope Pius IX. Assemani, of the famous family of Maronite clerics, was born in Hasseroun on 31 March 1821. Well versed in Italian and Latin, he was sent to Rome to the Pontifical Urban University to study theology and French. He was ordained a priest in Rome by Cardinal Fransoni, Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. He returned to Lebanon, where he was appointed confessor to the Maronite Patriarch. He was a professor of Italian, Latin and philosophy before being named Vicar General of the Maronite Patriarchy in Tripoli. He was named Maronite Chorbishop of Tripoli in 1856. With the assistance of the French Consul, Mr. Planche, he was able to obtain from Fuad Pasha a plot of land to establish a Maronite cemetery and hospital. He established in Tripoli the Brotherhood of the Immaculate Conception, repaired the Church of the Virgin Mary, and obtained an Ottoman firman to build a church in Tripoli, the first of its kind since the Crusades. According to his biography, he suffered numerous vexations while representing the Maronites in Tripoli. In 1860, his home was attacked and pillaged during the night. He was arrested twice and often attacked, before being exiled by the Ottoman governor in 1867. In 1869 he joined the Maronite delegation attending the First Vatican Council in Rome, serving as the Maronite delegation's official interpreter due to his knowledge of Latin, French and Italian. * On April 16, 1954 the Arch?Eparchy gave a part of its territory to Syria in favor of the erection of the Apostolic Administration of Latakia. * ?

The index was first proposed by Robert M. Little in 1975 in his paper The Irregularity Index: A quantitative score of mandibular anterior alignment. The index takes the anatomical contact points of anterior Incisors into account. A contact point is created by touching of edges of two different teeth. During mandibular crowding, teeth are often rotated, displaced either palatally or buccally. The Little's irregularity index measures the horizontal linear displacement of anatomic contact points of each mandibular incisor from the adjacent anatomic point and sums the five displacement together. Once summed, the value represents the degree of anterior irregularity. A perfect alignment from canine to canine will yield a score of 0 on the Irregularity Index. As the crowding increases, the score will increase. Little used Dial Calipers in his study to measure the distances on a plaster model taken of mandibular arches. The caliper had an accuracy to tenths of millimeter. The vertical discrepancy between the contact points does not play a role in the index. The scale of the index is listed below. The number correspond to the distance in mm of the sum of horizontal displacements of the anatomical contact points of the mandibular anterior teeth. * 0 - Perfect alignment * 1-3 - Minimal irregularity * 4-6 - Moderate irregularity * 7-9 - Severe irregularity * 10 - Very severe irregularity  Disadvantages  Some of the disadvantages of this index includes assigning high score to Malocclusion which involve a severe rotation of one or more tooth. The treatment of a case like this maybe simple compared to the high score of crowding it received from this index. The index also does not take into account other features of malocclusion before assigning a score to an individual.

Originally built for and owned by the Willamette Steam Navigation Co., it was soon acquired by the People's Transportation Company, a steamboat line which held a near-monopoly on Willamette River transportation. This vessel was rebuilt in 1871, and ran until 1875, when it was dismantled. Construction and dimensions Alert was built at Oswego, Oregon, in 1865 by the firm of Paquet & Brown, and launched on December 8, 1865. Alert was long, exclusive of the extension of the main deck over the stern, called the \\"fantail\\" on which the stern-wheel was mounted. Alert had a beam (width) of and depth of hold of . Alert measured out at 340.83 tons according to the official merchant vessel registry. The official merchant vessel registry number was 1233. Alert was driven by two single-cylinder steam engines, horizontally mounted, each with a cylinder bore of 16.5 inches and a piston stroke of 60 inches. In 1874, the steam engines of Alert developed 74 horsepower. Operations=For Willamette Steam Navigation Company= Alert made its trial trip on January 18, 1866. The initial officers of Alert were James Strang (1827-1890), master; Edward Fellows, engineer; H. H. Johnson, purser; Jerry Driscoll, mate. As of March 1866, Alert was operating on a daily run (Sundays excepted) from Portland to Oregon City, departing from Vaughn's wharf at 7:00 a.m. under Capt. James Strang. At Oregon City, the route connected with the steamer Active, which, under John T. Apperson, master, departed Mondays and Thursdays for Salem, Albany, Corvallis and downriver waypoints. At that time, Alert and Active were both owned by the Willamette Steam Navigation Company, of which D. W. Burnside was president. =For People's Transportation Company= In December 1866, Alert was owned by the People's Transportation Company, of which Asa Alfred McCully (1818–1886) was president. Capt. Ephraim Weston Baughman (1835-1921). took over as master after the steamer had been acquired by the People's Transportation Company. According to one source, in 1868, Baughman was succeeded by captains Joseph Kellogg and George A. Pease. Another, contemporaneous, source, states that Captain Kellogg was in charge of Alert on the Portland to Oregon City run as of December 1, 1866. Under the winter shipping arrangements of the company, Alert departed Portland daily at 7:00 a.m., for Oregon City, where it connected with steamers running to points on the upper Willamette River, upstream from Willamette Falls. The Reliance ran on Mondays and Thursdays to Corvallis, Oregon; the Fannie Patton ran to the same city on Tuesdays and Fridays; the Active ran every Wednesday for Harrisburg, Lancaster, and Eugene; and Union ran on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays for Dayton and Lafayette on the Yamhill River. In late September 1869, Alert used a bell to sound its arrival, in a dense fog, at the dock in Oregon City. While bells were used for such purposes on Mississippi River steamboats, this was departure from the tradition of Willamette River steamboats, which generally employed the steam whistle in lieu of a ship's bell. On the Saturday morning before December 4, 1869, a steward on Alert, a young man named Foote, committed suicide by jumping overboard and drowning. Foote entered the ladies cabin, and as he went out, spoke to some women, telling them goodbye, and then immediately went to the stern of the boat and jumped over. Foote was reported to have been recently discharged from the East Portland Insane Asylum. Reconstruction and disposition Sources appear to differ on the disposition of the steamer Alert. According to one source, Alert was condemned in 1871. Alert was rebuilt and renamed E.N. Cooke. Another (non-contemporaneous) source states that Alert was rebuilt in 1871 as the steamer E.N. Cooke, U.S. merchant vessel registry number 8762. Another source states that by June 1871, Alert had been broken up, with the machinery to be installed in a new boat. =Reconstruction= The steamer appears to have been rebuilt in 1871. In late March of that year, the People's Transportation Company was reported to be planning to build two new boats, one to replace Alert and another to replace Reliance. The new boats were to be long, of 250 tons, designed after a model by Capt. Joseph Kellogg. In April 1871, \\"work had been commenced on the new steamer Alert, which was expected to be the largest and best-furnished steamer ever to run between Oregon City and Portland. On June 2, 1871, the new Alert was reported to be almost ready to be launched. On Monday, June 12, 1871, the old Alert was taken out of service, to be dismantled so that the machinery could be placed in the new Alert. The new Alert was reported to be in operation on Tuesday, August 22, 1871, carrying as cargo a large boiler from a repair shop in Portland to the woolen mills in Oregon City. =Disposition= Alert (#1233) and E.N. Cooke (#8762) were both listed separately on the 1874 merchant vessel registry. This continued to be the case three years later. By the next year, only E.N. Cooke was listed. Alert is recorded as having been dismantled in 1875.

Biography Todd was born in 1903 in Litchfield, Kansas, a small coal mining town near Pittsburg, Kansas. She was one of 13 children born to Charles Wilson and his wife Estelle Slaughter Wilson. Lucinda started her teaching career in 1928 after graduating from what is now Pittsburg State University with a degree in Education. She married Alvin Todd in 1935 and they moved to Topeka, Kansas. As a married woman, she was not permitted to teach so she was forced to quit her job. While raising her daughter, Nancy, she became active in the local chapter of the NAACP and was elected Secretary in 1948. When Nancy entered grade school, Lucinda wanted her to have music lessons, but she later learned that music was only taught at the white schools. When she asked the school board why, they told her that colored children weren't interested in learning music and couldn't afford the instruments. She spoke out against this policy and the next year, there was music in the black schools. As Lucinda became more outspoken about the conditions of the schools for African-American children, other teachers grew afraid of losing their jobs because of their association with Lucinda. Whenever some of her teacher friends visited her home, she had to pull the shades down. At the time, African-American teachers in Topeka endured ruthless work conditions at the hand of a white segregationist superintendent, who hired a black man to enforce segregation throughout the school system. This school administration evaluated black teachers 50% for their skills and 50% for \\"attitude\\" and the wrong \\"attitude\\" could get them fired. In August 1950 Lucinda wrote a letter to Walter Francis White, Executive Secretary of the national NAACP, requesting legal support. In the letter she stated, \\"Our situation has become so unbearable that the local branch has decided to test the permissible law which we have here in Kansas.\\" Mr. White referred Lucinda's request to the NAACP's legal department. Together with attorneys in Topeka, the NAACP outlined a series of strategies that aligned the desegregation movement with Lucinda's push for equitable access to educational opportunities. Lucinda Wilson Todd, and 13 other black parents became the petitioners in the class action suit to bring about integration in Topeka's elementary schools, Brown v. Board of Education. On May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the group of parents to integrate the elementary school system of Topeka. The decision to proceed with what was to become Oliver Brown et al. v. the Topeka Board of Education was made around Lucinda Todd's dining room table. In spite of the fact that she was a teacher in the school district and faced reprisals for her actions, she immediately volunteered on behalf of her daughter Nancy, as the first Topeka plaintiff. Todd died on July 17, 1996 in Topeka.

History In June 2015, Universal Studios Japan confirmed that they would be adding a new Jurassic Park-themed attraction. Later in July, vertical construction began, when the park finished building the first supports and track. Later in August, the park released teasers around the park saying \\"The Greatest DINOSAUR RIDE IN THE WORLD! Coming in 2016...\\". Construction was going on for a while. Finally on October 2, 2015, the park officially announced that they were adding Flying Dinosaur. Ride experience Firstly, it starts in a duel station and leads into a lift hill. After it gets to the top it has a big drop which turns slightly to the left and enters the first inversion (a zero-gravity roll) and it quickly enters a \\"Fly to lie\\" element which makes riders face the sky. It then goes into a half pretzel loop and makes riders turn into a flying position again. Quickly it turns into another pretzel loop, then enters a small tunnel at the bottom of the loop. It has a small air-time element after that and gets into a corkscrew. After that inversion, the train will enter a helix and comes to the final inversion, an inline twist which is just before the final brake run.

Life Neuland was born in Bonn, the son of a tailor named Johann Caspar Neuland and his wife Catharina, née Frings. He attended a local private boys school and studied harmony and some musical instruments with Johann Gottfried Klebs as well as piano and composition with Carl David Stegmann until 1824.Susanne Haase: Der Bonner Komponist Wilhelm Neuland (1806–1889). Studien zu Leben und Werk (Kassel: Merseburger, 1995), p. 9. He spent the years until 1826 as a military band musician, performing on several instruments, retiring mainly on health grounds, and established himself as a music teacher and composer in Bonn. From 1828 to 1871, Neuland was conductor of the Société Philharmonique (an orchestra and choral society) in Calais, France, a position that he was able to pursue for some months in a year only. He also conducted frequently in neighbouring Boulogne-sur-Mer. In addition, Neuland spent the years 1830 to 1835 mainly in London, where he was much in demand as a guitarist and composer for the guitar, following his contacts with other German-speaking guitarist-composers from Germany and Austria, including Ferdinand Pelzer and Leonhard Schulz. In London, he began to give opus numbers to his compositions. He wrote several ambitious works for guitar and a number of duos for guitar and piano and songs to guitar accompaniment. After he had left London, he never wrote for solo guitar again. At the time of the inauguration of the Beethoven monument in Bonn in 1845, Neuland was back in his native city, playing cello in the orchestra during the unveiling ceremony and donating 32 thalers. Dividing his time between Calais and Bonn, Neuland composed two large masses, opp. 30 (1840) and 40 (1856), which are now regarded as his main achievements.They form the bulk of the analytical part in Haase (1995), as above, pp. 34–107. After the Franco- Prussian War and the establishment of the German Empire in 1871, Neuland settled permanently in Bonn, although he maintained good relations to the north of France, attending a performance of his two masses in Boulogne-sur-Mer in 1872.Haase (1995), p. 27. He was frequently in demand as a conductor of orchestral and choral concerts, but did not have an employment as such. He died in Bonn in 1889 and was buried on the Alter Friedhof ('Old Cemetery'). Music Neuland wrote in a Romantic style following the models of Schumann and Hiller in particular. His early works for guitar established his name in England and make him one of the first composers writing music for guitar without primarily being a guitarist themselves. The masses have been performed frequently, mainly in Germany and France, until well into the twentieth century. In recent years his songs and his guitar works have created some renewed interest.

Any bike race longer than a century ride, which is , is sometimes considered to be ultra-distance cycling. However, such events are relatively common, so using a longer distance to define the category is more useful, such as any race that is longer than , or even a double century, . Bike races that cover these distances but which are split into stages do not fit most definitions of ultra-distance races - the clock needs to run continuously from start to finish. Even so, extra-long stages within a longer race may be long enough to be an ultra-distance race by themselves. In addition, any team events in which individual cyclists do not complete the full distance are not considered to be ultra-distance. Bike races that can be described as ultra-distance are organized below according to the type or format of the race. This is not an exhaustive list of such races, but the longest, most important (as measured by the level of media interest), or most popular (as measured by the number of participants) races within each category are mentioned. BikingMan is a series of 6 ultradistance self- supported cycling races which are all following a similar time-limit (120 hours) with a mileage of 620 miles. Track cycling In the early days of bicycle racing in the late 1800s, six-day racing on velodromes was popular. Only the original race format is a true ultra-distance cycling race as defined here because it was a simple test of how far an individual cyclist could ride during the six day-long event. The format evolved away from this to involve teams of two riding in a relay format. Later, the non-stop nature of the race was changed to only race during part of each day. Road racing= Professional = In the early days of professional road bicycle racing there were many one-day road races and stages in grand tours that were much longer than those of today. Bordeaux-Paris in France was the longest one-day, annual professional bike race; it had a route of about and was run almost every year between 1891 and 1988. After 1988, the longest one-day professional bike race became Porto–Lisboa in Portugal, which was about long. Porto-Lisboa was last held in 2004, and Milan-San Remo in Italy has since then been the longest race at . Paris–Brest–Paris was a professional bike race that covered a massive in France, and was only held every 10 years from 1891 until 1951, but has since continued as a randonneuring event (see below). Cycling's grand tours used to include far longer stages than they do today. The longest ever Tour de France stage was in the 1919 Tour and that year every one of the 15 stages was more than long. The longest ever stage in the Giro d’Italia was in the 1914 Giro and that year 5 of the 8 stages were longer than . The Vuelta a España did not begin until 1935 and the first edition was when its longest-ever stage was held, which was . In modern grand tours, stages longer than are increasingly rare and the limit set by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) for any individual stage during a stage race is 240 km. =Supported ultracycling races= There are no longer any true ultra-distance bike races (i.e., that are longer than ) that are affiliated with cycling's main governing body, the UCI; most modern ultra-distance races are instead affiliated with the UltraMarathon Cycling Association (UMCA). By far the best-known of these races is the Race Across America (RAAM), a non-stop race across the United States that covers . In this format of racing, the cyclists race individually (drafting and group riding are not allowed) but each cyclist has at least one support vehicle and a team of support staff. This specific format of racing is often referred to as \\"ultracycling\\", which is why it would be incorrect to refer to all ultra-distance cycling as ultracycling. Many ultracycling races include a team category that operates in a relay format and so does not meet the criteria for an ultra-distance cycling race used here (in which individuals must ride the complete distance). Other ultracycling races include the Race ACross Europe (RACE), which is long. The oldest ultracycling race in Europe is the Glocknerman, an Austrian cycling event with a distance of that was first held in 1997. The Race Across The Alps is only long but contains over of climbing and so the organizers claim it to be the hardest one-day race in the world. The first Race Across Russia was held in 2013 as a non-stop team relay event with a total distance of about between Moscow and Vladivostok. In 2015 it became the Red Bull Trans-Siberian Extreme with a solo category and the route was split into 15 separate stages, each between and long. =Road time trials= 12-hour and 24-hour road cycling time trials have been around for a long time and are still common. In these events, cyclists attempt to ride the maximum distance possible within the time limit. The current 24 hour record is over on a traditional bicycle and over in a velomobile. In 2014, the UMCA revived interest in the highest annual mileage record, which was last set in 1939 by Tommy Godwin at . This involves riding the maximum distance possible within a 12-month period. In early 2016, Kurt Searvogel broke the record, achieving a distance of in one year or per day. Some ultra-distance time trials are held at permanent motorsport racetracks, such as Bike Sebring (Sebring International Raceway), Rad am Ring (Nürburgring), Monza 12h Cycling Marathon (Autodromo Nazionale Monza), Cycling Zandvoort 24h (Circuit Zandvoort), 24h BiCircuit Festival (Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya), and Revolve24 Endurance Cycling Challenge (Brands Hatch and The Bend Motorsport Park). These lack any road traffic and have smooth road surfaces. =Unsupported ultracycling & bikepacking road races= Some races have recently become popular that recall the early era of professional bike racing in which riders were unsupported and raced day and night. The most popular of these is the Transcontinental Race, which covers approximately across Europe and was inspired by the off-road US event called the Tour Divide. As in ultra- cycling events, there is a mass start, but in bikepacking races, drafting is not allowed and all support is forbidden, so there are no support vehicles and riders must find all of their supplies, accommodation, etc. from commercial sources along the route or bring it with them. Although most will allow \\"Trail Magic\\" from strangers through kind actions, gifts, and other forms of encouragement so long as the magic doesn't move the bike. Another popular example in this category include the Trans Am Bike Race, which is more than 50% longer than the Transcontinental Race at , and so it is currently the longest non-stop bike race in the world. The IncaDivide, is a shorter distance event (1,800 km / 1,120 mi) which brings the high altitude cycling experience. It is the highest self-supported race that takes riders above 4,920 meters (16,140 feet) in the Andes mountains of Peru. It is part of the BikingMan, the first ultra bikepacking race series which took place in 2019 in Oman, France, Laos, Peru, Portugal and Taiwan on 620 miles standard format. Unsupported rides are sometimes done as completely solo attempts outside of organized rides but are still well-publicized. These often involve riding point to point (including city to city), for example Vegas In 24. =Randonneuring= Randonneuring events (also called brevets or audaxes) are generally non- competitive rides where racing is not the focus; they are ridden more as personal challenges. They also differ from most ultracycling and bikepacking races in that group riding and drafting is allowed. Supplies and accommodation are often provided by the organizers at intermediate checkpoints, but the use of support vehicles is not allowed outside of the checkpoints. The most famous of this type of event is Paris-Brest-Paris in France, in which over 5,000 people attempt to complete the long route in under 90 hours. The randonnee version evolved from the professional bike race (see above) and is held every four years. There are many similar events of between and around the world, including London–Edinburgh–London in the UK and the Cascade 1200 in the USA. For a more complete list, see the page on randonneuring. There are also many more shorter-distance randonneuring rides, which are typically , , or long. =Cyclosportives / Gran fondos= Cyclosportives (also known as gran fondos) are mass-participation cycling events. They are far less serious than pure bike races, but times are recorded and prizes are often awarded to the fastest people. The organizers normally provide full support in terms of marking the route and providing feed stations. The event that proclaims itself to be the \\"longest Granfondo in the world\\" follows almost the same route as the professional Milan-San Remo bike race and is long. However, there are several similar events that are longer. Bordeaux-Paris was a professional race until 1988 and returned in 2014 as a cyclosportive with a route of about . Styrkeproven Trondheim-Oslo is a long race and cyclosportive in Norway. The Tour du Mont Blanc is a long cyclosportive over mountainous terrain through France, Switzerland, and Italy. Slightly longer still is the Wysam 333 in Switzerland at . There is also the Mallorca 312, which is a long ride around the island of Mallorca, the Dragon Devil version of the Dragon Ride Wales cyclosportive in the UK is long, and the Vätternrundan cyclosportive that does a tour of the Swedish lake is long. In New Zealand, there is the Lake Taupo Cycle Challenge. The standard cyclosportive option involves a single lap of the lake, which is long, but there are also options to do two laps in one day for , with no support on the first lap, or start one day earlier and do four laps, , which is more of a randonneuring-format event. Every second year there is also an 8 lap option, long, but a following support vehicle is required for that version making it more of an ultracycling-format event. =Century rides= In the US, organized century rides of are common, with the format falling between a cyclosportive and a randonnee. There are also many organized double centuries of , one of the more popular ones being the Seattle to Portland Bicycle Classic, and at least one event even offers and options, the Los Angeles Wheelmen Grand Tour. =Other road cycling records= There are a few classic long-distance cycling routes for which time records are kept even though riders normally do not race simultaneously. These include Land's End to John o' Groats in the United Kingdom, which is about . On the longer end of the spectrum, there is Cairo to Cape Town in Africa, which is about . This record is currently held by Scottish endurance cyclist Mark Beaumont. The longest record of this format is the around the world cycling record, which requires the cyclist to cover by bike plus other requirements. A new women's around the world cycling record is currently being attempted by Scottish endurance cyclist Jenny Graham. In 2012 and 2014, a mass-start event called the World Cycle Race was organized based on these rules. Gravel biking In the early days of road bike racing, most roads were not paved, so most races were held primarily on unpaved/dirt/gravel roads. Due to road infrastructure improving with time, road bike racing is now done almost entirely on paved roads. However, in the 21st century, riding and racing road bikes on gravel roads has gained popularity, at least in part due to improvements in technology. Bicycle technology is seen as the largest contributor to the popularity of gravel biking because technology has allowed designers to integrate key characteristics of bikes across disciplines into one bike. For instance, the relaxed geometry of mountain bikes is the foundation of gravel bike frames but gravel bikes are lighter, faster and more responsive than a mountain bike. Gravel bikes also use characteristics of both cycle cross and road bikes for better comfort on long rides and the wheel clearance to accommodate rides done in torrential conditions. The culture of gravel biking has also been another reason it has grown in popularity. Gravel races rarely call for a team of coaches and bicycle technicians because the courses susceptible to varying weather that is hard to train and prepare for. Gravel riders are generally focused on getting through a course rather than maintaining a pace during races. This give way to camaraderie on the trail and caters to a fun and relaxed atmosphere that is not always present in road and mountain bike races. One of the longest and most famous of the modern gravel bike races is the Dirty Kanza in the Flint Hills around Emporia, Kansas, USA, which is long with a 350-miler announced for 2018 and options of 25, 50 and 100 mile courses as well. In the UK, the Dirty Reiver is a 200 km off-road cycling challenge that takes place in Hexham, England. The Dirty Kanza is a great example of how much gravel biking has grown in recent years for example, in 2006 there was a total of 34 riders that participated in the 200 mile race. In June 2019, 2,750 riders lucky enough to be picked from a lottery crossed the start line of the Dirty Kanza 200 and the fact that organizers had to introduce other mileage categories also shows that gravel biking is about the adventure.Jason Sumner,,\\"Bicycling\\" Mountain biking As on the road, some of the most popular ultra-distance mountain bike events are 12 and 24 hour time trials, of which there are many all over the world. In addition, there are many mountain bike races of at least . Very few mountain bike races are longer than because the average speed on typical mountain biking terrain is much slower than that on the road. 24 hour mountain bike races are where the bikepacking genre began, in which riders are entirely self-supported (see above for road-based bikepacking events). One of the most famous and popular off-road bikepacking events is the Tour Divide, which covers across the Rocky Mountains from Canada, through the US, and finishes at the Mexican border. The Iditarod Trail Invitational in Alaska is run on snow bikes in winter and is long. The most popular off-road bikepacking race in Europe is the Tuscany Trail, which covers in central Italy. Also in Italy, the Italy Divide starts at the Roman Coliseum and finishes at Lake Garda, passing through Siena, Florence and Bologna en route. It mixes technical mountain bike sections with gravel trails. In Central Asia, the Silk Road Mountain Race takes place in Kyrgyzstan, and covers 1,700 km (1,056 mi) in the Tien Shan mountain range. The Titan Desert is a six-day stage race held in Morocco with a total distance of over . In Australia, the Race to the Rock is an unsupported race through the Outback founded by Jesse Carlsson. The course and length differs each year, but generally finishes at Uluru; the 2018 edition was 3,500 km (2,175 mi) in total, and covered sections of Southern Australia as well as Tasmania. Climbing-focused Instead of trying to maximize the distance ridden in one ride, some people try to maximize the height gained in one ride. Everesting is a challenge that involves repeatedly cycling up and down the same hill multiple times until the total height gain matches the height of Mount Everest, . There are also records for the most height gain achieved within a certain time period, for instance 24 hours.

From the middle of the third millennium BC onwards, these oases came under Egyptian control and it seems that Egyptians and people of the Sheikh Muftah culture lived close nearby. Some Sheikh Muftah culture sites were found very close to Egyptian settlements.

In regards to bacteria, the idea is to design agents that block virulence rather than kill bacteria en masse, as the current regime results in much more selective pressure (on antibiotic resistance). From the early 1950s onwards, a large number of antibiotics, due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant common pathogen strains (both gram-negative and gram-positive), became scarcely effective and not-useful. This scenario has stimulated the research for an alternative strategy focused on agents (antivirulence or antipathogenic agents) aimed to disarm microorganisms cause of infectious disease, without killing or inhibiting the growth of microorganisms themselves and therefore with limited selective pressure to promote the antibiotic resistance phenomenon. The antivirulence strategy needs the knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms and of the virulence factors that underlie them. Virulence factors are the weapons possessed by pathogens to cause damage to the host, hence they are molecules or bacterial cell structures involved in the various stages of pathogenesis such as adhesion, invasion and colonization and also in the ability to escape host defenses and to injury the host tissues by producing toxic molecules (bacterial endotoxins and exotoxins). Adhesion The bacterial adhesion to the host tissues, involving a direct and a specific interaction between bacterial surface molecules and host ligands, is a fundamental step for microbial colonization and infection of both Gram- positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Interfere with adhesion, the first step of pathogenesis, could be an efficient way to prevent or treat infections.Cascioferro, S., Totsika, M., & Schillaci, D. (2014). Sortase A: An ideal target for anti-virulence drug development. Microbial Pathogenesis, 77, 105-112. doi:10.1016/j.micpath.2014.10.007 Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens adhere to the host tissues through filamentous organelles known as pili.Pinkner JS, Remaut H, Buelens F, Miller E, Aberg V, et al. (2006) Rationally designed small compounds inhibit pilus biogenesis in uropathogenic bacteria.Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 103: 17897-17902. The pili function on initial bacterial adhesion, invasion and biofilm formation, has been mainly studied for Gram-negative bacteria. There are some works on the synthesis of pilicides, chemical agents synthesized to target the chaperone–subunit interaction and the chaperone interaction with a protein involved in the biogenesis of the pili in Gram-negative known as fimbrial usher protein.Piatek R, Zalewska-Piatek B, Dzierzbicka K, Makowiec S, Pilipczuk J, et al.(2013) Pilicides inhibit the FGL chaperone/usher assisted biogenesis of thefimbrial polyadhesin from uropathogenic Escherichia coli. BMC Microbiol13: 131. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the major aetiological agent of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) and is often studied as a model of Gram- negative pathogen for the development of pilicides compounds. Similar structural motifs of pilin components has been found in an important family of Gram-positive surface proteins linked to peptidoglycan, the Microbial Surface Components Recognizing Adhesive Matrix Molecules (MSCRAMMs), able to recognize extracellular matrix proteins of host, such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, and collagen. If we consider the important part played by MSCRAMMs in the first step of Gram-positive pathogenesis and of biofilm formation, new antivirulence agents could be developed by using as a target the enzyme responsible of linking such proteins to cell wall, that is the Sortase A (SrtA), rather than any single surface protein involved in the mechanism of virulence.

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 58(23), 9108-9123. doi:10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b00779 The SrtA is a membrane-bound cysteine transpeptidase that is responsible, in Gram-positive bacteria, for the covalent anchoring of surface proteins to bacterial cell wall. 3,6-Disubstituted triazolo-thiadiazole compounds are under preclinical evaluation (including animal models) as antivirulence drugs against Staphylococcus aureus.Zhang J. et al., Antiinfective therapy with a small molecule inhibitor of Staphylococcus aureus sortase, PNAS 16, 2014, 111(37)13517-13522 Other cell surface molecules in Gram-positive bacteria, involved in the adhesion process, without cell wall anchorage, are non proteinaceous adhesins like Wall Teichoic acids (WTAs) and lipoteichoic acids. Since WTAs are required for host infection and play important role in biofilm formation, it has been suggested that they are important virulence factors required for the establishment and spread of infection in a host. Therefore, the enzymes involved in WTAs biosynthesis can be considered as good targets for novel antivirulence agents that interfere with Gram-positive pathogenic process. One possible target is the WTA biosynthetic pathway because strains of S.aureus and Bacillus subtilis mutants in WTAs are not able to colonize the host tissue and show a greatly diminished ability to establish infection in animal models.Swoboda JG, Campbell J, Meredith TC, Walker S (2010) Wall teichoic acid function, biosynthesis, and inhibition. ChemBioChem 11: 35-45. =Approved antivirulence drugs= Early examples of the antivirulence approach include mainly the inactivation of bacterial toxins with anti-toxin antibodies administered to post-exposure patients (serological therapy that induces artificially acquired passive immunization). Since inactivation of toxin during infection has proven to be an effective way to prevent or alleviate the symptoms of acute disease, significant progress has been made in the development of novel anti-toxic monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, in October 2016 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in July 2018 the Italian Drug Agency (AIFA) approved the therapeutic use of a monoclonal antibody called bezlotoxumab (Zinplava) as a treatment aimed at reducing the recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection in patients at high risk of recurrence.Dickey, S.W, Cheung, G.Y.C, Otto, M.

Today the site is still in use by Champion Christian College and is under renovation by the City of Hot Springs. History First built by the Detroit Tigers as a practice field in 1908, Majestic Park was the spring training site of the Boston Red Sox and their star pitcher Babe Ruth (1909–10, 1912–18), Cincinnati Reds (1910–11), Brooklyn Dodgers (1910) and St. Louis Browns (1911). The location later became the site of Dean Field (1935–47)/Jaycee Park (1947–present). Dean Field also served as home to the Rogers Hornsby Baseball College. The Hot Springs Bathers minor league team and the Chicago White Sox (1948–51) minor league Spring Training were held at Jaycee Park. Jaycee Park hosted the 1952 Negro League World Series and a 1953 exhibition game featuring Jackie Robinson. The site can claim games featuring both All-time Home Run record holders, Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron as among those who have played at the site. In 1914, Babe Ruth was just beginning his career (as a dominant left-handed pitcher) for the Red Sox, while a young Aaron played in the 1952 Negro League World Series. Today, the site is undergoing an 8.5 million dollar renovation, with a completion date of spring, 2021. The site has four historical plaques, as part of the Hot Springs Historic Baseball Trail. Majestic Field, Rogers Hornsby, Jackie Robinson and Hank Aaron each have historical plaques on the site. Jackie Robinson, Brooklyn Dodgers, 1954 Along with Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson and Hank Aaron, others who performed at the site include Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner, Jimmie Foxx, Gil Hodges, Harry Hooper, Cy Young, Rogers Hornsby, Grover Cleveland Alexander, Herb Pennock, Tris Speaker, and Walter Johnson. The Sporting News (1998) ranking of the greatest players ever listed: Babe Ruth (1), Ty Cobb (3), Walter Johnson (4), Hank Aaron (5) and Rogers Hornsby (9). Baseball in Hot Springs Often called the \\"birthplace\\" of Spring Training baseball, Hot Springs first welcomed Major League Baseball in 1886, when the Chicago White Stockings (now the Chicago Cubs), brought their coaches and players to the city in preparation for the upcoming season. Team President Albert Spalding (owner of Spalding Sporting Goods) and the team's player/manager Cap Anson, thought the city was an ideal training site for the players. The first baseball location was Hot Springs Baseball Grounds. Many other Major League teams followed and began training in Hot Springs. Needing venues for teams to use, Whittington Park was built in 1894, followed by Majestic Park (1908) and Fogel Field (1912). 134 members of the Baseball Hall of Fame are documented to have trained or played, in Hot Springs. World Series Champion Red Sox 1916, Babe Ruth in front row, middle History of Original Majestic Field In 1908, the Detroit Tigers created a practice baseball field at the site. In 1909, the stands forMajestic Park were built at the field by Boston Red Sox owner John I. Taylor, who signed a five-year lease on the property as a Spring Training location. Trolleys were routed to turn around in front of the park. The Majestic name came from the Majestic Hotel in Hot Springs. Two years later, Taylor would construct Fenway Park for the Red Sox. The Boston Red Sox (1909-1910, 1912–18), Cincinnati Reds (1910-1911), Brooklyn Dodgers (1910) and St. Louis Browns (AL) (1911) held Spring Training Camp at the original Majestic Park. The Boston Red Sox were a dominant team, winning four World Series Championships in their time at Majestic Park (1912, 1915, 1916 and 1918). It was in 1918 spring training that the Red Sox first began to use Babe Ruth in the field, instead of exclusively at pitcher, to take advantage of his hitting. On March 29, 1918, the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway, owners of the Majestic Park property cancelled the Red Sox lease for 1919 to utilize a portion of the ballpark area for railroad needs. In 1918, the original Majestic Park facility was demolished, leading to other fields on the property that had ties to the Major Leagues: Dean Field and Jaycee Park. The relocated field was renamed \\"Dean Field\\" in 1938 after Hall of Famer Dizzy Dean and his brother \\"Daffy\\" Paul Dean. Jaycee Park was built on the adjacent south side of the lot in 1947 to replace Ban Johnson Park, which was located across town. Dizzy Dean plaque HOF. \\"Dean Field\\" was named for Dean and his brother Paul \\"Daffy\\" Dean When Dean Field (1935-1947) and Jaycee Park (1947-Present) evolved, they hosted the Rogers Hornsby Baseball College, the George Barr Umpire School, the Chicago White Sox (1949–52) Minor League Spring Training and the Hot Springs Bathers as tenants. The minor league Bathers (1947-1955) were a Cotton States League team that was an affiliate of the Chicago White Sox (1947-1951), St. Louis Cardinals (1954) and the Kansas City Athletics (1955). Paul Dean Managed the 1954 team. =Baseball Schools= The Roy Doan Baseball School operated from 1934–38, attracting hundreds of students and utilized Dean Field and other locations throughout Hot Springs. In 1939, Hall of Fame player and manager Rogers Hornsby, a former instructor with Roy Doan, started his own Rogers Hornsby Baseball College. Hornsby's six- week event ran until 1952, annually attracting 100-200 prospective professionals and numerous major league scouts. Cy Young, Jimmie Foxx, Tris Speaker and Schoolboy Rowe were among the instructors. The George Barr Umpire School, the first ever training school for aspiring umpires, operated in Hot Springs through 1940, being held in conjunction with the baseball schools. =Babe Ruth= Babe Ruth played at Majestic Park for six seasons. In 1914, the lefty pitcher first faced Major League players as a young minor leaguer. Ruth would make the Red Sox' major league roster in 1915 and establish himself as a star pitcher. In 1918, during Spring Training, Ruth played first base as an emergency measure in a game against Brooklyn at Whittington Field (now Ban Johnson Park). The game helped change baseball history. Ruth hit two home runs that day and the second was a reported 573-foot home run that landed in the Arkansas Alligator Farm across the street. As a result, the Red Sox began to use Ruth as both a pitcher and a hitter. With Ruth regularly in the 1918 lineup, he led the American League with 11 home runs. He also pitched to a 13–7 record and the Red Sox won the World Series. Sold to the New York Yankees in 1920, Ruth went on to total 714 Home Runs, a record that stood until broken by Hank Aaron. Babe Ruth, 1916 =Jackie Robinson= On October 22, 1953, Jackie Robinson played in an exhibition game at Jaycee Park. Having broken Major League Baseball's color barrier in 1947, Robinson and the some other Major League players (including his Dodgers teammate Gil Hodges) toured, calling themselves Jackie Robinson's All-Stars. Robinson's squad played the Negro American League All-Stars that day, losing 14-9. Today, there is a plaque at the site as part of the \\"Hot Springs Baseball Historic Trail\\" honoring the event. =Hank Aaron: Negro League World Series= Hank Aaron, Milwaukee Braves, 1960 In 1952, as referenced in a plaque at the site, 18-year old shortstop Hank Aaron played for the Negro League Indianapolis Clowns against the Birmingham Black Barons at Jaycee Park in the Negro League World Series. The World Series was eventually won by the Clowns, with Aaron hitting 5 Home runs and batting over .400. The 1952 World Series was also the last for the Negro Leagues. Discovered by the Clowns while playing for a semi-pro team (Mobile Black Bears) in a game against them, they signed Aaron in April, 1951. After his performance in the Negro League World Series, Aaron signed with the Boston Braves. Hank Aaron would eventually become baseball's all-time Home Run leader, with 755 career Home Runs, breaking Babe Ruth's record of 714 on April 8, 1974.Heaphy,Leslie A. The Negro Leagues, 1869-1960p.222 Media The First Boys of Spring is a 2015 documentary on the history of Hot Springs Spring Training. The film features Majestic Park items. Produced by Arkansas filmmaker Larry Foley, it is narrated by Hot Springs area native, actor Billy Bob Thornton. The Foley documentary was aired nationally on the MLB Network beginning in February, 2016. Site Today In 1953, the Hot Springs Boys and Girls Club built and opened a youth facility on the parcel at 109 West Belding Street, where it still remains today. In 2018, Champion Christian College took possession of the youth facility building. In September 2019, the City of Hot Springs passed a bond issue to secure 8.5 million dollars for a total renovation of the Majestic Park site, with a completion date of spring, 2021.

The record was written in Toronto and recorded for two years in Berlin. The album garnered critical acclaim for its production, Ruba's vocals and the distinctiveness of each song, landing in the top 50 on Drowned in Sound's list of the best albums of 2011. Production The songs were written in the couple's built-in home studio in Toronto. In writing the songs, Sarah Ruba wrote down phrases or lyrics in her notebook during studio time, while Pavao was experimenting in the studio. Ruba described the duo's songwriting as \\"Futurepop\\", saying: “Even though we feel like we’re gearing towards writing pop songs, it’s not like Britney Spears, you know? Also because of the synths, the ‘80s influence, it sounds kind of spacey; and when synthesizers first came out, they were like ‘The Future.’ It’s a way of using a nostalgic term for electronic instruments in combination with popular and futuristic sounds.” The recording of New Look took place in Berlin for two years. Adam Pavao described their experience in Berlin in an interview: “It was really inspiring to be there and listen to the underground electronic stuff coming out of Berlin, because you don’t really hear that anywhere else. It was cool, like we went into the future a little bit. It inspired us to hear fresh, new music.” Composition New Look is a close combination of modern-day music and the style of 1980s electropop acts including Visage, Soft Cell, Ultravox, Yazoo, Pet Shop Boys and Eurythmics. The 1980s sound of the album is achieved with what Heather Steele of The Line of Best Fit explained as the duo's \\"penchant for analogue equipment, MIDI gaps and double-tracked female vocals.\\" Musically, New Look has the minimalism and space of indie pop act The xx to put Sarah Ruba's breathy, versatile vocal delivery in front of the mix, which was compared by reviewers to Aaliyah and Sade. The instrumentals was analogized in a review as \\"the work of the Neptunes melted in that same pot Björk used to cook up Vespertine.\\" Other musical influences include the works of Dirty Projectors, Chromeo, Yazoo, Kraftwerk, Theo Parrish, Depeche Mode's in their early years, and Spandau Ballet. The eighties electro elements are heard the clearest on tracks like the synth-saturated disco song \\"Nap on the Bow\\", which starts New Look. Including a \\"slow burning drum machine\\", it was described in a review for the magazine Clash as a strange combination of the songs \\"You’re Not Alone\\" by trip hop group Olive and \\"I Can’t Wait\\" by Nu Shooz. Critical reception New Look garnered critical acclaim, with some reviewers calling it one of the best albums of the year. As of January 2016, New Look holds an aggregate weighted mean of a 7.6 out of ten from the website AnyDecentMusic? based on nine reviews. Praise towards the album included Sarah Ruba's emotional vocal delivery, Adam Pavao's production and sound, and the distinctiveness of each track. Natalie Shaw of BBC Music honored New Look as \\"an essential record made by two people with astonishing control, skill and knowledge; one which makes us proud of what music has done in the past 20 years, and just what it can now create.\\"Shaw, Natalie (2011). \\"Review of New Look - New Look\\". BBC Music. Retrieved January 15, 2016. Heather Steele, in her review for The Line of Best Fit, highlighted that the record \\"unfolds and reveals more after each and every listen,\\" opining that every little sound and vocal part is deserved to be listened to. Ben Hogwood, a journalist for musicOMH, favored the lyrical content, in which \\"the uncertainty and originality of the lyrics lending an often unresolved tension to each song.\\" She also noted that Ruba's voice in sounding like \\"as if she really means every word that she sings, an obvious point to note you might think, but one often overlooked.\\" Loud and Quiet's Reef Younis found the LP to be \\"expertly fashioned, set to cutely coax awkward shapes to unassuming, hip-snaking rhythms and irritatingly infectious melodies\\", concluding that \\"The standard was set high but the pop renaissance shows no sign of letting up.\\" Clash magazine writer John Freeman scored the album a seven out of ten, calling it \\"pleasingly playable\\", while a CMJ critic stated that the duo were able to \\"create its own form of stark intimacy that the members, luckily for us, have translated nearly flawlessly into musical form.\\" A review in DIY magazine called it an \\"outstanding debut to suggest that they will be around for a very long time\\", but also wrote that the album could be disliked for \\"favouring style over substance\\". A similar sediment was shared by Jim Carroll, a music critic for The Irish Times, writing that \\"In between the electro shimmer and the plush melodramatic moods (best experienced on The Ballad), New Look [...] show many good reasons to pay attention to what they’ll produce in the long run.\\" However, one mixed review of New Look came from Dean O Hillis, a writer for SLUG Magazine. He wrote that the album's main issue was that the duo didn't know how to end their songs: \\"While not a total disaster, the missing key is obviously a skilled producer who could help them hone and sharpen their apparent talent.\\" Track listingReferences Category:2011 debut albums Category:New Look (band) albums Category:Studio !K7 albums ","title":"New Look (album)"},{"id":"49123066","text":"Events from the year 1326 in the Kingdom of Scotland.

It was the costliest, as well as the first above-average, Atlantic hurricane season since the 2012 season. It featured the highest number of deaths since the 2008 season and also yielded the highest number of named storm landfalls on the United States since that year. The season officially began on June 1 and concluded on November 30, dates which conventionally delimit the period during each year when a majority of tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. The season's first cyclone, Alex, developed on January 12, while the final storm of the season, Otto, closed-out the season by exiting into the Eastern Pacific on November 25, becoming the first Atlantic–Pacific crossover hurricane since Hurricane Cesar–Douglas in 1996. A total of 16 tropical depressions were recorded, of which 15 further intensified into tropical storms. Of those 15, a total of seven strengthened into hurricanes, while four attained their peaks as major hurricanes. Activity began with Alex which, upon making landfall in the Azores, became the first January landfalling tropical cyclone since Hurricane Alice in the 1954 season. In June, tropical storms Colin and Danielle became the earliest third and fourth named storms, respectively, on record. Hermine moved ashore the coastline of Florida as a Category 1 hurricane on September 2, ending the record hurricane drought that began in the state after the 2005 season's Hurricane Wilma. In late September and early October, Hurricane Matthew wrought destruction throughout the Caribbean Sea and Southeastern United States, resulting in $15.09 billion (2016 USD) in damage and 603 deaths; it remains the ninth-costliest hurricane on record in the Atlantic, as well as the tenth-costliest in the United States. In mid-October, Hurricane Nicole developed to Category 4 intensity and remained a major hurricane while directly impacting Bermuda, the first storm of such strength to do so since Hurricane Fabian in the 2003 season. Following the 2016 season, the names Matthew and Otto were retired from reuse in the North Atlantic by the World Meteorological Organization. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.

In the United States, Free-roaming animals (ferae naturae) are (broadly) held in trust by the state; only if captured can be claimed as personal property.Joan E. Shaffner, An Introduction to Animals and the Law, Palgrace Macmillan, 2001, pp. 19–20. Animals regarded as commodities may be bought, sold, given away, bequeathed, killed, and used as commodity producers: producers of meat, eggs, milk, fur, wool, skin and offspring, among other things.Rosemary-Claire Collard, Kathryn Gillespie, \\"Introduction,\\" in Kathryn Gillespie, Rosemary-Claire Collard (eds.), Critical Animal Geographies, London: Routledge, 2015, p. 2.Francione 2004, p. 116. The exchange value of the animal does not depend on quality of life.Cassuto 2009, p. 314.

In commodity markets, animals and animal products are classified as soft commodities, along with goods such as coffee and sugar, because they are grown, as opposed to hard commodities, such as gold and copper, which are mined.Patrick Maul, Investing in Commodities, Hamburg: Diplomica Verlag GmbH, 2011, p. 8, table c. Researchers identify viewing animals as commodities by humans as a manifestation of speciesism. The vegan and animal rights movements, chiefly the abolitionist approach, of the twentieth century calls for eliminating the commodity or property status of animals. History and law Animals, when owned, are classified as personal property (movable property not attached to real property/real estate). The word cattle derives from the French word cheptel or Old French word chatel, or personal property.Wilkie 2010, pp. 115–116; \\"Chattel\\", Legal Information Institute, Cornell University Law School. Historian Joyce Salisbury writes that the relationship between humans and animals was always expressed in terms of control, and the idea that animals become property by being domesticated. She notes that Saint Ambrose (340–397) held the view that God controlled wild animals while humanity controlled the rest. Isidore of Seville (560–636) distinguished between \\"cattle\\", a term for animals that had been domesticated, and \\"beasts\\" or wild animals, as did Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274).Joyce Salisbury, The Beast Within: Animals in the Middle Ages, Routledge, 2012 [1994], p. 10, 13–15. The English jurist William Blackstone (1723–1780) wrote of domesticated animals, in Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765–1769): > In such as are of a nature tame and domestic (as horses, kine [cows], sheep, > poultry, and the like), a man may have as absolute a property as in any > inanimate beings ... because these continue perpetually in his occupation, > and will not stray from his house or person, unless by accident or > fraudulent entitlement, in either of which cases the owner does not lose his > property ...\\"William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, Volume > 1, Callaghan, 1884 [1765–1769], p. 389, cited in Wilkie 2010, p. 116. That wild animals belong in common to everyone, or to the state, and can become personal property only if captured, is known as the \\"animals ferae naturae\\" doctrine. Blackstone wrote of wild animals that they are either \\"not the objects of property at all, or else fall under our other division, namely, that of qualified, limited, or special property, which is such as is not in its nature permanent, but may sometimes subsist, and at other times not subsist.\\"Blackstone 1884, p. 390. Sentience Writing about wild animals being imported into France in the 18th century, historian Louise Robbins writes that a \\"cultural biography of things\\" would show animals \\"sliding in and out of commodity status and taking on different values for different people\\" as they make their way from their homes to the streets of Paris.Louise E. Robbins, Elephant slaves and pampered parrots: Exotic animals and their meanings in eighteenth-century France, University of Wisconsin--Madison, 1998, p. 10. Sociologist Rhoda Wilkie has used the term \\"sentient commodity\\" to describe this view of how the conception of animals as commodities can shift depending on whether a human being forms a relationship with them.Wilkie 2010, p. 115ff. Geographers Rosemary-Claire Collard and Jessica Dempsey use the term \\"lively commodities.\\" Political scientist Sami Torssonen argues that animal welfare has itself been commodified since the 1990s because of public concern for animals. \\"Scientifically-certified welfare products,\\" which Torssonen calls \\"sellfare,\\" are \\"producible and salable at various points in the commodity chain,\\" subject to competition like any other commodity.Sami Torssonen, \\"Sellfare: A History of Livestock Welfare Commodification as Governance\\", 71(1), Fall 2015. Social scientist Jacy Reese Anthis argues that, while there is no immanent right for animals or humans to not be commodified, there are strong practical reasons to oppose any commodification of animals, not just that which is cruel or egregious.

Early life Of Scottish Catholic origin, he was born in the spring of 1740, two years after his parents' marriage.Adm Thos Gordon's letter book - National Scottish Archives He was the son of another Thomas MacKenzie (Foma Kalinovich Mekenzi, Фома Калинович Мекензи -Son of Colin) who was also a rear admiral in the service of Russia. His mother Ann MacKenzie (née Young) was the granddaughter of Admiral Thomas Gordon, Governor of Kronstadt. Mackenzie entered into the Russian Navy in 1765 with the rank of midshipman, initially serving in the Baltic Sea. Later, with a rank of captain lieutenant, he took part in a number of battles in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–74), including the Battle of Nauplia (1770). He was wounded in the Battle of Chesma, where he served under Scottish-born Admiral Samuel Greig and commanded a fireship which contributed to the destruction of the Turkish fleet. On 9 July 1771 he was awarded the Order of St. George Fourth class. For distinction in this battle he was also promoted to captain of the second rank (equivalent to commander). On 21 April 1777 he was promoted to captain of the first rank (equivalent to captain). Sevastopol On 28 June 1782 he was promoted to captain of major-general rank, and on 1 January 1783 to rear admiral in the Black Sea fleet. With a squadron of nine frigates and some smaller ships, he wintered in the practically uninhabited bay of Akhtiar on the Crimean peninsula. He cleared the shore of forests and founded the city of Sevastopol on . At MacKenzie's initiative the city was developed, with a shipyard, shops, hospital and church, as well as barracks and living quarters for officers. He worked to establish limestone quarries and developed the land to meet the supplies required by the wooden fleet, as well as food supplies. He is considered the first commander-in-chief of the port of Sevastopol. The MacKenzie Hills (Мекензиевые горы) on the outskirts of the city are named in his honour, and he was given a farmstead there by Potemkin as a reward for his service. He had a house in the city where Empress Catherine the Great would once later stay. Making the most of limited resources, he did not always observe formalities in achieving results, which served as a motive for accusations of misuse of treasury funds. This undermined his health, and he died in Sevastopol on 10 January 1786. Descendants Thomas MacKenzie had a son born to Maria Wady, whose descendants are living today.

A historic landmark, the Baltic Exchange building was architecturally known for its cathedral-like trading hall and its stained glass war memorial. It was damaged in a bombing in 1992. The site is now occupied by 30 St Mary Axe (\\"The Gherkin\\"); the stained glass can be seen at the National Maritime Museum. Construction The historic building was designed by Smith and Wimble and completed by George Trollope & Sons in 1903: it was subsequently listed as a Grade II* listed building. Bombing of the exchange building Stained glass window from the old Baltic Exchange building (now in the National Maritime Museum) On 10 April 1992 at 9:20 pm, the façade of the Exchange's offices at 24–28 St Mary Axe was partially demolished, and the rest of the building was extensively damaged in a huge Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) bomb attack. The one-ton bomb killed three people whilst 91 were wounded. The bombing came a day after the General Election. =Aftermath= Architectural conservationists wanted to reconstruct what remained from the bombing, as it was the last remaining exchange floor in the City of London. English Heritage, the government's statutory conservation adviser, and the City of London Corporation insisted that any redevelopment must restore the building's old façade onto St Mary Axe. Baltic Exchange, unable to afford such an expensive undertaking alone, sold the site to Trafalgar House in 1995. The remaining sculptures and masonry of the structurally unstable façade block on the site were photographed and dismantled before the sale; the interior of the Exchange Hall, which was regarded as stable, was initially sealed from the elements in the hope that it would be preserved in situ in any new development, but was subsequently dismantled and stored offsite in 1995–96. English Heritage later discovered that the damage was far more severe than they had previously thought. Accordingly, they stopped insisting on a full restoration. What remained of Exchange Hall was completely razed in 1998 with the permission of the planning minister John Prescott over the objections of architectural preservationists, including Save Britain's Heritage, who sought a judicial review of his decision. The site, together with that of the Chamber of Shipping at 30–32 St Mary Axe, was used to accommodate 30 St Mary Axe, commonly referred to as \\"The Gherkin\\". The stained glass of the Baltic Exchange war memorial, which had only suffered superficial damage in the bomb blast, has been restored and is in the National Maritime Museum. Architectural salvage Its classic red granite, coloured marble, Portland stone, and much of the original plaster interiors that survived the bomb were first stored in a Reading warehouse before being sold in 2003 to salvage dealer Derek Davies, who moved them to Cheshire. Davies put the elements on SalvoWEB in February 2003, finally selling the 1,000 tonnes or more to salvage dealer Dennis Buggins in late 2005. Buggins then moved the elements from Cheshire to various barns around Canterbury in Kent.Pavilions of Splendour , heritage.co.uk Sale of building and new life After years on the market, in June 2006 an Estonian businessman, Eerik-Niiles Kross, found an advertisement for the components of the Baltic Exchange building on SalvoWEB while trawling the web for reclaimed flooring.Historic London building to be reassembled in central Tallinn, baltictimes.com He and his business partner Heiti Hääl bought the Baltic Exchange elements for £800,000Extreme architectural auction sale, salvonews.blogspot.com from Dennis Buggins of Extreme Architecture, and the 49 containers were shipped via Felixstowe to Tallinn in June 2007.

Due to planning conflicts, the components have remained stored in their shipping containers for a decade.

New Testament scribal interpolations  Matthew 17:21 Is an interpolation to assist in harmonizing with Mark 9:29 referencing the removal of a demon. Matthew 23:14 is added to help harmonize with Mark 12:40 and Luke 20:47. Mark 16:9-20 is not found in the oldest texts of Mark. Luke 2:33 has been modified in some translations to replace 'Jesus father' with Joseph, to imply that Joseph is not Jesus father. The famous image of Jesus sweating drops of blood as he prayed in the garden prior to the crucifixion, fails to appear in the earliest copies of Luke. John 5:4 which tells of an angel stirring the waters to heal the people is also not found in early texts. The parable of the adulterous woman and the famous phrase 'Let he who is without sin cast the first stone' is either missing entirely, or placed in different parts of John, or even in different parts of Luke. The story of the Ethiopian eunuch was also modified, presumably to fit the authors position on salvation through baptism. First John 5:7-8 also appears to have been modified to reinforce the concept of the holy trinity, as the earliest manuscripts state (starting with verse 8 \\"The Spirit, the water, and the blood\\" Whereas popular translations such as the King James Version show (starting in verse 7) \\"For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.

Some of the essential design elements have also been adopted as a modern smaller multihull prototype variant. Larger context The Pacific Ocean and particularly Micronesia gave birth to many different forms of simple sailing craft. Sail plan and hull form differ. Sail plans may include lateen, also known as crab-claw or half-crab-claw, Latin, or triangular. Hull formats include catamarans, doubles, proa, and singles. Presence of a beam spanning a double hull is optional. Likewise, hull end forms and shapes vary greatly. Masts for these type of sailboats can be made with one or two poles. The vessels may be made by hollowing out tree trunks, or may be assembled from planking. Other design considerations include the intended use of the vessel, for fishing, sea voyages or war, and whether they are to be used in sheltered lagoons or in the open sea. Additionally, there is an important and fundamental dividing line between two design types. Some vessels \\"shunt\\", that is they change course direction by using the opposite pole of a two pole mast then sailing in the opposite direction (the \\"Pushmi- pullyu\\" of the sailing world). Others use a tacking rig, a design that is similar to sloop rigged boats found worldwide. History Developed in Palau and used for centuries, the kaep was built from tree logs. A keel carved to a knife's edge was combined with a deep bow, giving it the ability to function in severe adverse weather, wind and waves. Sailors would crowd aft, lifting the bow out of the water, and increasing hull speed. It was used to fish, race and trade. It is a very fast craft. The kaep lacks a rudder. Instead it has a \\"crab claw\\" sail, and is further controlled by the skillful use of fore and aft trim moving the boat's balance point, that is the center of resistance relative to the center of effort to control her heading. This is essentially like a wind surfer. See Sail twist. A traditional kaep is double-ended with a reversible or pivoted (swiveling) mast, so that it can be sailed in either direction. A traditional kaep has an average hull in length, in width, and maximum height of . The kaep has been the subject of commemorative postage stamps in Palau.

He practiced medicine in Vienna, and published numerous almanachs, planetary tables and calendars. His Astrolabium planum was published by Erhard Ratdolt of Augsburg in 1488; a second edition was printed by Johann Emerich for Lucantonio Giunti in Venice in 1494.  Life  Engels was born at Aichach, near Augsburg in Bavaria, probably on 2 March 1453. He registered at the University of Ingolstadt in the summer of 1472, the year of its foundation, and graduated as a master of arts in 1474; in 1476 he gave lectures on Aristotle at the university. From 1489 to 1491 Engel worked as a proof-reader or editor for the noted printer Erhard Ratdolt of Augsburg, who had previously worked in Venice and had published many works on astronomy. Between 1492 and 1497 Engels studied medicine at the University of Ingolstadt. He later practiced medicine in Vienna, where on 29 September 1512 he died.  Works  From 1484 Engel began to publish almanachs and astrological calendars, in both German and Latin. His Astrolabium planum, with many tables of astrological calculation and 360 examples of horoscopes, was published by Erhard Ratdolt in Augsburg in 1488. A second edition was printed by Johann Emerich for Lucantonio Giunti in Venice in 1494, and subsequently reprinted by Giunti in 1502. Engel's edition of the De magnis coniunctionibus, Latin translations by Jean de Séville (Johannes Hispalensis) of works by the ninth-century astronomer and astrologer Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi of Baghdad, was published by Ratdolt in 1489, and was influential in the development of the astrological theory of planetary conjunctions. Ratdolt's edition of the Tabule directionum profectionumque of Regiomontanus, printed in 1490, has corrections by Engel. In 1491 Ratdolt printed Engel's edition of the Decem tractatus astronomiae of the thirteenth-century mathematician and astrologer Guido Bonatti of Forlì. The Ephemerides coelestium motuum usque ad annum 1500 of 1494 was printed in Vienna by Johannes Winterburger, the first Viennese printer, who also printed the undated Almanach novum atque collectum … super anno domini 1510.

Irvine (born 10 December 1956) is an Irish judge who is the President of the Irish High Court, the first woman appointed to that role. She first was a Judge of the High Court between 2007 to 2014. She was a Judge of the Court of Appeal from 2014 to 2019 and served as a Judge of the Supreme Court of Ireland from May 2019 until becoming President of the High Court on 18 June 2020. She is an ex officio member of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal. She was nominated to become the President of the High Court in June 2020. In addition to being the first woman to hold that position, she is the first judge to have held four judicial offices.  Early life  Irvine was born to John and Cecily Irvine in 1956 in Clontarf, Dublin. Her father was once deputy director of RTÉ. She was educated at Mount Anville Secondary School, University College Dublin and the King's Inns. She was an international golf player, winning the Irish Girls Close Championship in 1975.  Legal career  She was called to the Bar in 1978, and became a Senior Counsel in 1996. She was the secretary of the Bar Council of Ireland in 1992. She was elected a Bencher of the King's Inns in 2004. Irvine specialised in medical law, appearing in medical negligence cases on behalf of and against health boards in actions. She was a legal advisor to an inquiry into Deposit interest retention tax conducted by the Public Accounts Committee, along with future judicial colleagues Frank Clarke and Paul Gilligan. She represented the Congregation of Christian Brothers at the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. Her practice also extended to constitutional law. As a junior counsel, she acted for the plaintiff in Cahill v. Sutton in 1980 in the Supreme Court with seniors Niall McCarthy and James O'Driscoll. The case established the modern Irish law of standing for applicants to challenge the constitutional validity of statutes. She appeared with Peter Kelly to argue on behalf the right of the unborn in a reference made by President Mary Robinson under Article 26 of the Constitution to the Supreme Court in 1995 regarding the Information (Termination of Pregnancies) Bill 1995.  Judicial career = High Court = Irvine was appointed as a Judge of the High Court in June 2007. She was in charge of the High Court Personal Injuries list from 2009 to 2014 and subsequently became the second Chair of the Working Group on Medical Negligence and Periodic Payments, established by the President of the High Court. = Court of Appeal = She was appointed to Court of Appeal on its establishment in October 2014. Some of her judgments on the Court of Appeal reduced awards given by lower courts for personal injuries compensation. She wrote \\"most of the key\\" Court of Appeal judgments between 2015 and 2017 which had the effect of reducing awards arising from subsequent actions in the High Court. She was appointed to chair a statutory tribunal to conduct hearings and deal with cases related to the CervicalCheck cancer scandal in 2019. However following her appointment as President of the High Court in 2020, she was unable to continue with the position. = Supreme Court = On 4 April 2019, she was nominated by the Government of Ireland as a Judge of the Supreme Court. She was appointed by the President of Ireland on 13 May 2019. She wrote decisions for the court in appeals involving planning law, the law of tort, intellectual property law, judicial review, and chancery law. Irvine was appointed by Chief Justice Frank Clarke in 2019 to chair the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee of the Judicial Council. The purpose of the committee is to review the levels of compensation issues in court cases arising out of personal injuries. Minister of State at the Department of Finance Michael W. D'Arcy wrote a letter to congratulate Irvine on her appointment and outlined his views that personal injuries awards in Ireland should be \\"recalibrated\\". She responded to the letter by saying it was the not the Committee's duty to tailor its findings \\"in a manner favourable to any particular interest group\\". = President of the High Court = Following a cabinet meeting on 12 June 2020, it was announced that she would be nominated to succeed Peter Kelly as President of the High Court. A three person panel consisting of the Chief Justice Frank Clarke, the Attorney General Séamus Woulfe and a management consultant Jane Williams reviewed applications for the position, before making recommendations to cabinet. The President of the Law Society of Ireland welcomed her appointment, describing her as a \\"outstandingly able judge\\". She is the first woman to hold the role. As she was previously an ordinary judge of three courts, her appointment as President of the High Court made her the first person to have held four judicial offices. She was appointed on 18 June 2020 and made her judicial declaration on 19 June. She took over as President in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland. She issued guidelines for lawyers to negotiate personal injuries cases outside of court due to the backlog formed by delays in hearings. She issued a practice direction in July 2020 that face coverings were to be worn at High Court hearings. In her first week as President, she presided over a three-judge division of the High Court in a case taken by a number of members of Seanad Éireann. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Seanad should sit even though the nominated members of Seanad Éireann had not been appointed. The court refused the relief and found for the State. She continues to sit in the Supreme Court following her appointment.  Personal life  Irvine was formerly married to retired judge Michael Moriarty, with whom she has three children.

It was built in 1932 and opened in 1933. It starts on the southern edge of Arnos Park soon after Arnos Grove station and ends on the northern side of the park, where the line enters a tunnel that continues to Southgate.

The extension was built in stages, first to Arnos Grove station (opened 1932), then to Oakwood (then known as Enfield West), during which phase the viaduct was constructed, and finally to Cockfosters. The entire project cost more than £5 million. The viaduct The viaduct starts at the southern edge of Arnos Park and ends on the northern side of Hampden Way, opposite Morton Way.

The combination of a viaduct followed fairly soon after by a long tunnel was made necessary by the need to keep the line as level as possible as it crossed the Pymmes Brook valley, then went under high ground at Southgate before continuing above ground to Oakwood and Cockfosters.

Career Černický first studied art in Ústí nad Labem from 1987 to 1990, before moving to Prague in 1990 to attend the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design, moving to the Academy of Fine Arts in 1993, where he studied until 1997. He first received attention for outlandish projects, such as, in 1993, collecting tears from people in the street, which he then took to an Ethiopian monastery. His projects are varied, but usually depict hypothetical subjects. Černický combines various media in exhibitions, alternating between easel painting, objects, video and photography. He also uses action art and new media technologies. His work often features strong emotions, social commentary, and ironic humor. Other examples of Černický’s works include tools for taking drugs made of cut glass, a tattooed sausage, a glass model of a nuclear explosion, a striped series of paintings, an ornamental series on terrorism, monochrome images with a silicon structure, a monument in the form of an information board at a railway station with philosophical texts, videos about the movement of the speed of light, the “Gagarin Thing”, and a white motorcycle helmet imitating Munch’s The Scream.

It is famous for the pine forest and the Nature Reserve Bosco di Alcamo. On its slopes they have found a proto-historic necropolis and traces of an ancient settlement. If you go up to the peak you can see the remains of an old water reservoir (called Funtanazza) and a gate (called Porta della Regina), which implies the existence of surrounding walls.Gruppo Archeologico Drepanon, Bonifato - La montagna ritrovata, Trapani, Il Sole editrice, 2014, . Besides, on the top there are the remains of a castle with four towers, that was built at the end of the 14th century by the Ventimiglia family, feudal lords of the territory of Alcamo for a certain period.  Territory  Mount Bonifato is located in the hinterland of Golfo di Castellammare, between the valley of Fiume Freddo (a river on the west) and Fiume Jato (a river on the east). It shows quite steep faces on the south, while the declivity is more gradual in the northern part of the mountain, in proximity of Alcamo. Until the first decades of the 19th century the mountain was covered with an oak wood of ilex and downy oak. In the thirties they began a massive reforestation prevalently with Aleppo’s pine that is the prevailing essence nowadays. The access to the mount and the Nature Reserve is provided by a town street: Via per monte Bonifato. Along this road there is a large number of holiday houses, especially concentrated between the fourth and fifth hairpin bend from the valley floor, and it is illuminated for a large part of its course (with the exception of the last mile, before the entrance into the Reserve area). From the peak you can admire a landscape with the mountains of Palermo on the east and the island of Marettimo in the west; on clearer days you can also see Ustica in the north and mount Cammarata in the south-east.  Geology  The stratigraphy of Mount Bonifato is quite complex as this mountain is made up of many layers of rock, dating back to geological periods. They have found, in particular, the following formations: * Formation Sciacca (Norian-Rhaetic) * Formation Inici (Hettangian-Sinemurian) * Formation Buccheri (Liassic superior-Tithonian inferior) * FormationLattimusa (Tithonian superior-Valanginian inferior) * Formation Hybla (Aptian–Albian) * Formation Amerillo (Cretaceous superior–Oligocene inferior) * Formation Bonifato (Oligocene superior) * Calcareniti of Corleone (Burdigalian–Langhiano) * Marls of San Cipirello (Langhiano superior-Tortonian inferior) * Colluvium(Holocene). From the idrogeological point of view, there are a deep aquifer in correspondence with the Triassic limestones, a superficial one near the peak and secondary aquifers in correspondence with the layers of debris.  Paleontology  Tortoise’s fossil eggs inside the travertine of Alcamo Between the mountain and Alcamo there is an imposing bank of travertine dating back to Pleistocene which has been exploited nearly all to get slabs for the building industry.Aspetti geomorfologici, stratigrafici, sedimentologici e paleontologici dei travertini di Alcamo (TP) However the quarries are also an important site for paleontology because they have found important fossils there. In particular inside one of these quarries (now Geosite Travertino della Cava Cappuccini (Alcamo)), they have found remains (a natural cast of the brain, defences and molar teeth) of the dwarf elephant,Musei d'Italia - Progetto SiciliaMuseo Gemellaro - Gli elefanti di Sicilia e i primi uomini: benvenuti sulla macchina del tempo. Elephas falconeri,the spheric eggs and the fossilized armour of a big tortoise (Geochelone sp.).Cani M., 1988: On new records of fossil elephants at Alcamo Sicily Italy.

Gemellaro - \\"Tartarughe di Alcamo\\" The site has also allowed to re-establish the correct \\"stratigraphy\\" of the Elephas in Sicily because, in a fracture of travertine filled with \\"paleosuolo\\" (then more recently than travertine itself), they have found the remains of a medium size elephant, the Elephas mnaidriensis,Cani M., 1988: On new records of fossil elephants at Alcamo Sicily Italy. which had been wrongly considered the dwarf elephant’s ancestor. Inside Alcamo travertine they also discovered specimens of giant dormouse,Perché un corso di aggiornamento di geoscienze presso il Museo Gemmellaro.

In ancient times there was a fortified town on Mount Bonifato, in fact they have found different specimens. With the passing of time, this town has passed different phases of population and depopulationHistoria Alcami: Reperti archeologici. and for a long time it was inhabited simultaneously with Alcamo (which stands at the foot of the mount), before its disappearing. In particular, it was inhabited since the last part of the Bronze Age, and Elyms, Romans and Byzantines settled there.Alcamo: sul monte Bonifato una polis degli Elimi? From the quotations by Licofron, we know that in ancient times this residential area was called Longuro. With the same name they also indicated the mount, which according to other suppositions was also called \\"Aereo\\" and \\"Longarico\\" (corresponding to the Latin name of Longuro).Nuove effemeridi siciliane The old town was defended by a wall on three sides and was composed by unicellular houses (that is having a single room). Among the remains of the old town there is the “Funtanazza”, an ancient architectonic work which probably was a water reservoir; according to other people, it was, on the contrary, a thermal plant. The Funtanazza has a rectangular shape with pillars sustaining a barrel vault, similar to the moorish fountains on the northern coasts of Africa. = Medioeval period = Ruins of the Castle of Ventimiglia in a description by the Prince of Torremuzza (1779) It dates back to 1182 a document about land grants in which this residential area appears with the name \\"Bonifato\\"Mariangela Ettari, \\"Il Castello di monte Bonifato\\" (or Bùnifat or Bonifacio), from the name of the Roman knight who became its owner.Alcamo e le origini da Longuro, Longarico In 1243, owing to an order given by Frederick II, after some cases of rebellion, there was an event of depopulation, but in 1333 it was repopulated under Frederick III’s rule. Since 1340 it was a possession of the baron Raimondo Peralta and later of Guarnieri Ventimiglia. The son Enrico Ventimiglia succeeded Guarnieri Ventimiglia: he declared that he had the castle of Ventimiglia (or castle of Bonifato) built as a protection from possible attacks. According to some different interpretations, the castle would date back, on the contrary, to a previous period. In 1243 the castle was destroyed by order of Federico II, and rebuilt in 1391 by the Ventimiglia family at their own expense. Bonifato was definitively abandoned in 1338; its inhabitants finally settled in Alcamo because of the difficulty of getting there and the distance from the road network. In 1779 the ruins of the castle were inserted in the Piano di conservazione dei Beni Culturali della Sicilia (Preservation Plan of the Cultural Heritage of Sicily) by Gabriele Lancillotto Castello, Prince of Torremuzza.  Archeological research  An old photo of Porta Regina (the Queen's Gate). Since the second half of the 16th century Mount Bonifato has already been explored by scholars who identified different archaeological sites on the mountain,Gli studi di archeologia del territorio di Alcamo such as the ruins of the old residential area, discovered by the scholar Tommaso Fazello. The archaeological remains on Mount Bonifato were subjects of research by the historians Ignazio de Blasi (18th century) and Vincenzo di Giovanni (19th century). At the Regional Archeological Museum Antonio Salinas there are also some lanterns and stamps of bricks dating back to the Roman age, collected on Mount Bonifato by Pietro Maria Rocca during the 19th century. Several archaeological excavations have later been made on this mount,Alpa Uno, \\"Alcamo: Monte Bonifato, riprendono gli scavi\\" revealing finds dating back to the Middle Ages and remains of very ancient settlements, such as a house of the 6th-7th century A.D. and fragments of ceramics and bronze now exhibited at the museum Baglio Anselmi of Marsala. Since the first excavations on Mount Bonifato, they have discovered some tomb caves, without any findings inside them, as they were reused by local farmers in later periods. During the following digs, they discovered the ruins of an ancient gate, called The Queen’s Gate. During the last years the excavations have been done within some school-camps organized by Legambiente (1996), Archeoclub of Trapani-Erice (2000), LIPU (2001) and Gruppo Archeologico Drepanon (from 2007 to 2010, inside an iniziative called \\"Progetto Bunifat\\").  Places of religious interest  The Sanctuary of Most Holy Mary of the Height was built in the 16th century by three friars (Antonino La Melodia, Vito Faraci e Giuseppe La Chelba), after the founding of an icon of Our Lady dating back to a previous period (later missing) which had been buried under the walls. During the same century of its construction, the Church was a place of pilgrimages (called \\"Vie Sacre\\") by the believers arriving at the sanctuary as a sign of penance or to ensure the arrival of the rains. The Church was rebuilt in 1930; inside it you can see a wooden statue made in 1933 by Giuseppe Ospedale and a painting on metal by Liborio Mirabile. In honour of Our Lady of the Height they celebrate the festivity on September 8 and they prepare large bonfires or \\"luminari\\" (during the eve), the celebration of Masses, the procession and the recital of poems in dialect. Procession in honour of Our Lady of the Height (about 1960).  Man’s intervention  Owing to the reforestation activities and the installation of TV repeaters (one of them is even placed on one of the three towers of the castle), a lot of signs of the past have got lost on Mount Bonifato, such as: *The snowfields, that is special pits where they collected snow, whose water was considered miraculous as it melt; *The caves, among which Polifemo or the eagles’ cave, where they said once these birds of prey lived.  Sport events  On Mount Bonifato they have performed 13 editions of a car race, whose finish line was the yard in front of Funtanazza:Cronoscalata Monte Bonifato in 2010 this sport event has been resumed after several years.Appuntamento ad Alcamo per la conclusione del Siciliano ACS Mount Bonifato has also been the place of some cycling races, such as the III Gran Prix of Cycling in the Province of Trapani (2012).A Monte Bonifato ciclismo di qualità  See also  * Alcamo * Alcamo Marina * Nature reserve Bosco di Alcamo  References  Sources  *  Other projects  Category:Alcamo ","title":"Mount Bonifato"},{"id":"49123678","text":"Maiwoche (May Week) is the name of an annual festival which takes place in the German city of Osnabrück, and also in Herdecke, Germany.  Maiwoche in Osnabrück  cathedral Maiwoche 2009: Stalls and concert stage on the market place outside the Town Hall During the Maiwoche, artists and music groups of various genres perform on numerous stages spread out across the whole of Osnabrück’s city centre. These regularly include nationally and sometimes internationally renowned performers such as Die Happy, The Spencer Davis Group, Die Angefahrenen Schulkinder, Lotto Kind Karl, 4Lyn, Madsen, Mickie Krause and Casper; however most of the groups tend to change from year to year. Stalls are also set up between the stages - similarly to funfairs – during the Maiwoche. In addition, a swing ride is set up every year in front of the cathedral in Osnabrück. The Osnabrücker Aktien Brauerei was a co- founder of the modern Osnabrück Maiwoche. The first Maiwoche festival was opened in May 1972 with a beer barrel tapping, in the presence of then-Lord Mayor Ernst Weber. It is the largest public festival in north Germany. More than 600,000 people attended the Maiwoche in Osnabrück in 2007 (which took place from 11 – 20 May). In 2008 it took place from 1 – 12 May (Whit Monday) and saw an estimated 700,000 people attend. The 2009 and 2010 events took place from the 8 – 17 May and the 13 – 24 May respectively.

It survives in two main medieval redactions, a shorter one from about 1300 and a longer one from about 1350, both taking their inspiration from The Four Sons of Aymon, a French chanson de geste. It is distinctive enough, however, to be reckoned among the romances composed in Iceland, rather than a translation.Matthew Driscoll, \`Late Prose Fiction (Lygisögur)', in A Companion to Old Norse-Icelandic Literature and Culture, ed. by Rory McTurk (Oxford: Blackwell, 2005), pp. 190 --204 (p. 191). Synopsis Kalinke and Mitchell summarise the saga thus: > Earl Ámundi has four sons—Vigvarðr, Rögnvalldr, Markvarðr, Aðalvarðr—and a > daughter. Rögnvalldr incurs the anger of the emperor by defeating him in a > chess game. The emperor strikes Rögnvalldr, and Vigvarðr avenges the insult > by killing the emperor. The saga revolves around the clash between the > emperor's son Karl and the four brothers, abetted by their brother-in-law > Mágus who is capable of assuming various disguises. In the end Mágus effects > a reconciliation between the feuding parties. Manuscripts Mágus saga is exceptionally extensively attested: it and Jarlmanns saga ok Hermanns compete for being the most widely attested Icelandic saga of any type.Matthew Driscoll, \`Late Prose Fiction (Lygisögur)', in A Companion to Old Norse-Icelandic Literature and Culture, ed. by Rory McTurk (Oxford: Blackwell, 2005), pp. 190--204 (p. 194). Kalinke and Mitchell identified the following manuscripts of the saga: Influence 'The origin of the older Mágus saga may be oral tradition, or it may be, as in the case of Tristrams saga, that a translation made in Norway was revised in Iceland and gave rise to a new version'. As well as drawing on The Four Sons of Aymon in chs 5-22, it has striking overlaps with the Pelerinage de Charlemagne in ch. 1, the folktale type AT 1552 in ch. 2, to Decameron 3:9 in chs 2-4. The saga also draws on the Norse texts Þiðreks saga, Karlamagnús saga, Hálfs saga ok Hálfsrekka, and Snorra Edda. The younger version includes Geirarðs þáttr, which draws on the Gesta Romanorum.Jürg Glauser, 'Mágus saga jarls', in Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia, ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 403-3 (p. 402). 'Parts of the material of the saga are also found in Mágus rímur and Geirarðs rímur, in the Faroese ballad Karlamagnus kvæði (Karlamagnus og Jógvan kongur, CCF 106), and in Norwegian ballads (Dei tri vilkåri, The Types of the Scandinavian Medieval Ballad, TSB D 404)'.

Also known as the 1st Oba of Imiekuri, he was recognized as powerful by those he traded with in Ghana and Nigerian states, having become rich through the cotton and slave trades. On August 14, 1967 he died of old age, at his home in Illewi.  Background  Olowu was born in Imiekuri, Okpella, Nigeria around 1855 in a small village called Illewi. He was born into a nomadic family of Merchants. Growing up in the agrarian town, he was helpful in farming with his parents and was tall for his young age until growing up to be very tall.  Personal life  Olowu was a strong practitioner of Juju. He had 2 children from his wife, who died in 1916. Edwin Ikhumitse Olowu, his son, was the first one in the family and village to get an education. Olowu spoke numerous languages fluently: Okpella, Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, etc. Around the early 1930s Olowu's mother died from old age.  Involvement with the slave trade  Olowu was a powerful slave trader in Nigeria. In his early life, he traveled from Nigeria to Ghana for trading and brought back bamboo seeds to plant in the Okpella Region. He also traveled to villages and towns in the areas of the Midwest region including Badagry for his trade. Many family members regarded him as influential in the cotton trade as well as that of other commodities like cocoa, palm oil, and tobacco. During his time as a trader he changed his surname to Olowu, due to his trade with the Yoruba. At the beginning of the 20th century Olowu abandoned the slave trade and took on his duties as Oba Of Imiekuri.  Life as Oba Of Ilewi  Sometime after the Nupe war in Okpella, Olowu became the first Oba of Imiekuri, he was known to bring development to Illewi and his people, and reigned until his death. thumb  Later life and death  Later in his life after being king he went back to farming.

The battle was fought in conjunction with several other actions of the Salamaua–Lae campaign. Throughout the first half of 1943, Australian forces had clashed with the Japanese around Wau and then Mubo as they had pushed the Japanese back towards Salamaua. As the campaign had developed, the Japanese had brought in reinforcements from elsewhere in New Guinea, effectively reducing their garrison, particularly around Lae. Following fighting on Lababia Ridge, the Australians had begun securing positions around Bobdubi, with a view to extending towards Mount Tambu. With a view to driving on Salamaua from several different axes, and also to establish a port with which to relieve the aircraft and native carriers that were supplying their forces, a landing at Nassau Bay was made in early July by US troops, and they subsequently began a drive north along the coast. By mid- July, they came up against strong Japanese forces along a ridge overlooking Tambu Bay, which was later dubbed Roosevelt Ridge, after one of the US battalion commanders. Over course of July and August, the US 162nd Infantry Regiment made several attempts at capturing the ridge. Progress was slow, though, and this – coupled with inter-Allied service politics – strained relations between US and Australian commanders before the ridge was eventually carried in mid-August. Background In late June and early July, Allied forces were advancing towards Salamaua, having secured the airfield at Wau earlier in the year. As Australian forces were fighting around Mubo and Bobdubi, Allied planners determined the need to relieve some of the logistics burden on their aircraft by seizing Nassau Bay, which was about south of the Allies' ultimate objective. Over the course of several days in early July, one reinforced battalion of the 162nd Infantry Regiment, under the command of Colonel Archibald MacKechnie, made an unopposed amphibious landing at Nassau Bay. They were supported by the Australian 2/6th Infantry Battalion, which created a diversion to draw Japanese troops away from the landing beach. Elements of the Papuan Infantry Battalion (PIB) provided flank security and after the landing, the US troops established a beachhead at Nassau Bay. Following the initial landing, two more battalions of the 162nd Infantry Regiment were landed at Nassau Bay along with Australian and US artillery support. The Japanese troops holding the area around area were drawn from the 3rd Battalion, 66th Infantry Regiment—under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Fukuzo Kimura—the 3rd Battalion, 102nd Infantry Regiment and a detachment of 250 men from the 115th Infantry Regiment. These forces were reinforced by elements of the 238th Infantry Regiment, which was sent to the area in mid- August as the Japanese sought to reinforce the Salamaua area by moving troops from other parts of New Guinea. Battle Following further fighting around Mubo, the Japanese began to withdraw to avoid encirclement as the Allies advanced towards Salamaua on the coast. At the same time, in early July, an ad hoc force under Brigadier General Ralph W. Coane – the US 41st Infantry Division's artillery commander – was established reporting to Major General Stanley Savige's 3rd Division, as command relationships and inter-Allied politics resulted in MacKechnie being dismissed, following disputes between Roosevelt and the commander of the 17th Brigade, Brigadier Murray Moten, regarding whether or not the US troops were under Australian command. The main body of the 162nd Infantry Regiment, consisting of Lieutenant Colonel Harold Taylor's 1st Battalion and Roosevelt's 3rd Battalion, were tasked with undertaking a flanking drive along the coast north of Nassau Bay towards Logui, as part of the three-pronged Allied drive on Salamaua. Crossing the Bitoi River, the US troops had advanced north along the narrow isthmus east of Lake Salus towards Tambu Bay. Tasked with securing a beachhead around the bay, and providing artillery support to the Australians fighting around Komiatum and Bobdubi, elements of the PIB under the command of Captain Ernest Hitchcock, were pushed ahead of the US force to scout the area, and around 14 July they succeeded in locating several Japanese elements around Boisi including marines and soldiers from the III Battalion of the 66th Infantry Regiment, which were orientated to defend against a landing around Tambu Bay. In addition to these forces, which numbered about 250 men, further Japanese forces which had fallen back from Mubo had also established themselves in force on a ridge overlooking the bay. This ridge, which provided good observation of Tambu Bay, allowing the Japanese to fire artillery down on to the landing beaches, was later named Roosevelt Ridge by the Americans, naming it after Major Archibald Roosevelt, the commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 162nd Infantry Regiment. Map of key locations during the fighting around Salamaua. Roosevelt Ridge is marked as \\"RR\\". On 15 July, a company from the 2nd Battalion of the 162nd Infantry Regiment landed on Lababia Island. Three days later the main US drive on Tambu Bay commenced, with two companies striking towards the north via an inland route, while another hand-railed the coast, guided by PIB scouts. The advance was slow and on the coast, the US company was held up around Lake Salu while a platoon from the PIB destroyed one of the Japanese outposts around Boisi on 20 July. The US company was then able to occupy Boisi, but found itself receiving harassing fire from Roosevelt Ridge, which stretched from the sea about to the west. The 2nd Battalion, 162nd was subsequently brought up to Tambu Bay as preparations were made for an attack on Roosevelt Ridge. The Australian divisional commander, Savige, to whom Coane Force was subordinated, suggested an attack from the west, which would allow the US troops to advance downhill; however, Coane determined he would assault from the east. A platoon from the PIB scouted the area, and then this was followed by an attack by two companies: 'K' and 'I'. The Japanese defenders rolled hand grenades down the steep slope and fired mortars down on the attacking Americans. Upon cresting the hill small arms fire engaged them from several concealed positions. With this the assault was turned back. A second attempt was made later that day, but again it was defeated and two days later the two US companies withdrew from the ridge. Afterwards, 'I' Company secured the western end of the ridge around Scout Ridge, which lay opposite Roosevelt Ridge, separated by a deep ravine. In an effort to support the advancing infantry, on the night of 20/21 July two artillery pieces from the Australian 2/6th Field Regiment were landed at Tambu Bay. These were reinforced with two more guns on 24 July, while a second troop was landed the following week. Working in conjunction with the larger US 105 mm pieces, these guns were later used to help reduce the Japanese defences around the Salamaua region, with aerial observation being provided by Boomerang fighters from No. 4 Squadron RAAF, while Australian forward observers were sent out from Tambu Bay to marry up with the Australian 15th and 17th Brigades further to the north-west. Japanese forces estimated that 4,000 rounds fell on their position in this period. The Japanese responded with counter-battery fire throughout late July, and an air raid by a single bomber on 24 July. The Americans renewed their attack on Roosevelt Ridge on 27 July. A force of 100 soldiers from 'E' Company were assigned this time, using a creek line to parallel the ridge, and move up through the dense jungle. Pushing to the west and then hooking back towards a spur that led towards a small knoll on the crest, the Americans sought to find a break in the Japanese defences. Nevertheless, once again, on reaching the crest they began taking heavy fire, and although they established themselves firmly on a shoulder of ground below the ridge, they could go no further. A second company – 'F' Company – was brought up, moving in beside 'E' Company on their left, and a further assault was made on 28 July, but again this was defeated. The Americans then dug-in while the Japanese harassed them with tracer fire throughout the night. For several days, the US troops made more unsuccessful attempts to win the position. In early August, the Japanese launched an uphill attack on 'I' Company on Scout Ridge. This was repelled, but they continued for several nights until the Americans took the Bald Knob feature further down Scout Ridge. In the week that followed, Japanese troops raided the US positions, severing communications. The lack of progress concerned the Allied commanders and subsequently Douglas MacArthur replaced Coane and Roosevelt, with MacKechnie returning to take over the 162nd and Major Jack E. Morris taking over from Roosevelt. The Australian 42nd Infantry Battalion was landed at Nassau and Tambu Bays in early August and subsequently used secure positions around Davidson Ridge and Scout Ridge as part of efforts to secure Mount Tambu. Since their earlier failed attacks, the US troops around Roosevelt Ridge had been patrolling the area and observing the Japanese forces, aided by the PIB. By 12 August, orders were passed for a renewed effort. The 2nd Battalion, under Major Arthur Lowe, was tasked with the main assault from its position on the southern slope of the ridge, while Morris' 3rd Battalion assaulted on their left, on the eastern part of Scout Ridge. The main assault commenced early on 13 August, but it was preceded by a patrol from the 2nd Battalion establishing an outpost about from Boisi. This position was attacked by the Japanese throughout the night, but the US troops managed to hold their position. Heavy preparatory fires fell on Japanese position to the front and flanks, before the attack began with two companies pushing forward. In the ensuing fighting the Japanese lost 39 men killed, while the US forces had 25 killed or wounded, as they penetrated the Japanese perimeter in three locations. Overnight, the Japanese attempted to reinforce the position with 200 men from the 238th Infantry Regiment, but the following morning the two US companies were able to effect a link up at the western end of the ridge. The remainder of the position was then subjected to heavy fire from Bofors guns that had been dragged onto a knoll opposite the ridge, and were fired horizontally into the Japanese position, devastating the Japanese defenders and tearing up the jungle. Aftermath Following the fighting around Roosevelt Ridge, the Allied advance on Salamaua continued. Mount Tambu was secured on 18 August, and operations in the area continued through the final week of August. The capture of Roosevelt Ridge enabled Allied artillery observers to control fires more effectively around Salamaua and in the days following they began shelling Tambu Bay heavily, while patrols were pushed forward of the ridge with a view to eventually clearing the Japanese from the Scout Ridge junction and pushing north of Roosevelt Ridge. Around the same time, the Allies launched a seaborne landing near Lae and an airborne landing at Nadzab as part of an operation to secure Lae, which Allied planners considered more important than Salamaua itself. Pressure had been maintained on Salamaua in an effort to try to draw reinforcements away from Lae; however, as the Lae operation developed, the Japanese moved about 5,000 to 6,000 troops away from Salamaua by sea, abandoning the badly bomb damaged town. In early September, Major General Edward Milford's 5th Division headquarters took over from the 3rd Division, and the Australians launched the final effort to secure Salamaua. Bad weather hampered their efforts, but the airfield and surrounding area was eventually secured on 11 September, by Australian forces from the 15th and 29th Brigades, after a brief engagement with the Japanese rearguard. Losses in the campaign amounted to 1,083 killed or wounded for the Australians with 343 being killed and 8,100 for the Japanese, 2,722 men being killed. In addition, the US 162nd lost 81 killed and 396 wounded throughout the entire campaign.

The school was active between until its closure in 2008. History Following the discovery of gold in Victoria in the 1850s and the granting of statehood to the Colony, the population of Melbourne rose quickly from 177 at the time of settlement in 1836 to 80,000 in 1854 and just seven years later that figure had risen to 140,000.The history of the City of Melbourne. Melbourne City Council, 1997. (web document) Retrieved on 8 June 2015. The needs of the ever-expanding population led to the establishment of places of worship, hospitals and schools. The suburb of Brunswick was no different and a school building, part of the St Ambrose Church complex, costing £1000 was completed by the middle of 1885 and opened formally around that time. This building later became the St. Ambrose's Hall. In 1890 St. Ambrose's was declared a Parish in its own right led by Father Luby. The school enrolment had increased to 330 and the need for finances to expand the services offered by the parish was rising. By 1906 the total school enrolment had risen to 1021 students and around £6000 had been spent in the preceding 16 years. Since 1899 the school had been led by Charles Xavier O'Driscoll. When O'Driscoll resigned in 1911 he went on to become Inspector of Catholic Schools for the region. The girls school St Ambrose's Girls' School began operating in the original church building and the curriculum included singing, drawing and French. By 1906 the running of the school had been taken over by the Sisters of Mercy. The Sisters travelled along Sydney Road from their convent in North Coburg daily and in 1913 Sister Mary Claver was head of the girls school. Around 1922 the daily average attendance had risen to 500 pupils. The boys school In the early years the boys shared the same building with the girls but were still being taught by lay teachers in 1906. In 1917 a new building, costing £4000, was formally opened a short distance from the church itself. Also known as St. Ambrose's Boys School, Brunswick, members of the Congregation of Christian Brothers taught the boys and assumed control of this school. At the time of opening it had an enrolment of 300, its first headmaster was Bro. Keniry. The boys school continued to be assisted by the Christian Brothers for some time as they had also established St Joseph's CBC North Melbourne in the neighbouring suburb of North Melbourne. St Joseph's was to become the residence of the teaching Brothers serving St Mary's Primary School, West Melbourne, St Joseph's and St George's School in Carlton, and for a time, St. Ambrose's.Stewart, Ronald (2000) The Spirit of North 1903–2000.

Born in 1837, he began to live on Beaver Island in 1893 and died in 1925. Protar's cabin and \\"doctor's office,\\" where he lived from 1893 to 1925. Biography Born in what is now Tartu, Estonia, then part of the Russian Empire, Protar's birth name was Friedrich Parrot. His date of birth is recorded as February 19, 1837. Parrot's family was part of the German- speaking, landowning aristocracy of the Baltic region. In his early adult years, Parrot developed a successful career in German-language theater, performing for appreciative audiences in Dresden, Berlin, Riga and elsewhere in north and central Europe. Possibly because he ran afoul of Russian government efforts to Russianize the Empire's Baltic provinces, Parrot emigrated to the United States in 1874, changing his family name to Protar. He worked a number of jobs, most of them in the theater. However, he eventually became a newspaper editor in Rock Island, Illinois. In 1893, seeking solitude and an opportunity to get a fresh start in life, Protar established a home on Beaver Island, in northern Lake Michigan. He changed his first name to Feodor and adopted a lifestyle inspired by the Russian novelist and philosopher, Leo Tolstoy. He lived alone, sharing the isolated island with a small population of farmers, loggers and fishermen, most of them of Irish descent. Protar lived off the land as much as was possible, growing his own food, canning and drying it for sustenance during the long winters. His fellow islanders saw him as a benevolent, if eccentric, humanitarian and follower of a spiritual discipline inspired by Tolstoy. Trained or self-taught in pharmacology, Protar was eventually pressured by his neighbors into practicing as an unlicensed physician. This was a skill of serious importance to the islanders in the early 1900s, as the technology of the time meant that Beaver Island was isolated from the mainland in the harsh winter months, and the island was not big enough to support a licensed physician.

He was the last rector of the Sint Agathaklooster in Delft, until hanged without due process on 10 or 11 December 1572. Although never officially canonised he has long been regarded as a martyr by Dutch Catholics. Life Musius is thought to have been born in Delft on 11 June 1500 (although the sources are not unanimous, some giving alternative dates or locations). He was the son of Johannes Pietersz Muys, a descendant of the Dordrecht patrician lineage of Muys van Holy, and Elisabeth Woudana. He was orphaned young and began a clerical career. He studied theology at Leuven University, and travelled in Flanders and France, spending time in Ghent, Arras, Paris and Poitiers. He then became rector of the Sint Agathaklooster in Delft, a post he held for 35 years, while writing Latin verse and corresponding with numerous scholars he had met on his travels.A.

On contravening a curfew for members of the Catholic clergy and religious orders, leaving the city to bring church treasures to safety, he was hunted down by the Lord of Lumey and transported to Leiden. There, despite having a letter of safeguard from William of Orange, he was beaten, tortured and hanged. His sufferings were described in Richard Verstegan's Theatrum crudelitatum (Antwerp, 1587) and in book 10 of Petrus Opmeer's Historia martyrum Batavicorum (Cologne, 1625).

Prior to joining the Outlaws, he played for the teams -bird noises-, Hammers Esports, and Luminosity Gaming Evil, and was the captain of the 2017 United States Overwatch World Cup team. After retiring as a player, Jake joined the Overwatch League broadcast team as a caster. Jake was one of the Overwatch League's best known players, and has served as an ambassador of esports. He was interviewed by The Today Show about the Overwatch League, and represented esports players at a summit with the International Olympic Committee.  Playing career = Early career = Prior to the release of Overwatch, Lyon was a Team Fortress 2 player under the alias \\"sneakypolarbear\\". He began playing at 11 and competing at age 14, first in the Highlander and later in the 6v6 competitive formats. Two years later he had become skilled enough to receive an ESEA League invitation. When he decided to compete in Overwatch, he changed his alias to \\"Jake\\" (sometimes stylized as \\"JAKE\\") to avoid being mistaken as the League of Legends player Sneaky.2:10, 4:101:30 Lyon did not receive an invitation to participate in Overwatch's pre-release open beta, and began playing the game only upon its public release. At the time, Lyon was a college student and was studying abroad in the Netherlands. He was able to distinguish himself as one of the game's best players, achieving a top-500 rank in the game's competitive mode, despite playing on sub-optimal equipment.3:00 Lyon credits his time playing Team Fortress 2 for giving him a strong starting point for Overwatch, noting that as a TF2 Soldier player, he had experience with both hitscan and projectile weapons, and that the in-game communication style transferred over well, since both games were fast-paced and required a large amount of in-game communication.6:20, 7:50 Jake and five other former Team Fortress 2 players founded the team -bird noises-, reusing a team name that two of the other players had used in TF2. Although they all came from the same game, most had not played with each other before Overwatch. -bird noises- was eventually signed by Hammers Esports. In an interview, Jake described Hammers as the first organization to give them a reasonable offer, mentioning that they had received other offers before Hammers', but that they were not for living wages, and one even offered to pay them in mouse pads.4:30, 18:00 Hammers sold the roster to Luminosity Gaming a few months later, and since Luminosity already had an Overwatch roster, the former-Hammers roster competed under the name Luminosity Gaming Evil.4:25 During one online competition as part of LG Evil, Lyon attempted to play through a tornado warning, and at one point the match had to be delayed because he needed to evacuate to the basement of his college dorm until the warning passed.28:00 = Houston Outlaws = In the months between the World Cup qualifiers and the finals, Lyon was signed to the OpTic Gaming-owned Houston Outlaws, one of the teams in the newly formed Overwatch League. Three of Lyon's World Cup teammates would also go on to be part of the team; Matt \\"coolmatt69\\" Iorio had already been signed, and Shane \\"Rawkus\\" Flaherty and Russell \\"FCTFCTN\\" were signed after Lyon. Partway through the year, Kyle \\"KyKy\\" Souder, the 2017 World Cup team coach, also joined Outlaws as an assistant coach. In their inaugural season, the Outlaws would finish with a 22-18 match record, and end the season in 7th place, one spot short of making the end-of-year playoffs. In Overwatch, Jake is projectile DPS specialist and in-game leader. Extremely proficient with hero Junkrat, he became so closely associated with the character that fans began calling him \\"Jakerat\\".6:15 Lyon credits his success with the character on being willing to take aggressive, one-on-one engagements with opponents, and on having devised ways to maximize the hero's impact that other players had not yet discovered. In addition to Junkrat, Jake is known for his play on the heroes Soldier:76 and Pharah, and for being an in-game shot caller (a player that communicates strategy to teammates during the game).7:302:00 On December 7, 2019, Lyon announced that he was retiring from professional Overwatch competition, citing that he felt that he \\"forcibly stagnated [his] process of learning, growth, and exploration.\\" = International career = Jake was selected as the captain of the 2017 United States Overwatch World Cup team. The team qualified for the tournament finals at BlizzCon 2017 through their participation in a qualification tournament in Santa Monica, California. This event was Lyon's first offline tournament in front of a live audience; his previous competitions were online-only.1:30 At the main event, the team lost in the quarterfinals in an unexpectedly close series to favorites and eventual tournament-winners South Korea.  Casting career  Lyon declined tryouts for the 2018 Overwatch World Cup, announcing on Twitter that he had \\"bigger plans this year\\". This fueled rumors that Jake would be retiring as a player, either to join a team's coaching staff or to become an in-game broadcaster or \\"caster\\". He would later be announced as a caster for the Incheon, South Korea stage of the World Cup qualifiers, paired with veteran caster Andrew \\"ZP\\" Rush. As a caster duo, Rush would handle play-by-play casting, and Lyon would handle analysis. After retiring from competitive Overwatch, it was a announced that Lyon would join the Overwatch League talent as a commentator.  Esports ambassador  Charismatic and outspoken, Lyon has developed a reputation as a \\"leading personality amongst players\\",4:50 and is seen as an ambassador to Overwatch and to esports. Financial Review called him \\"the perfect poster-boy for the sport as it tries to dispel the prejudice that computer-gaming is a lonely pursuit of wastrels and slobs\\". In July 2018, Lyons was selected as one of two Overwatch League players to attend a summit between the International Olympic Committee and the esports community. The Times-Standard praised the selection, saying that Lyon was \\"likely one of the best players that could have been selected to publicly represent professional esports on a global scale\\". A few months prior to the meeting with the IOC, Lyon and Outlaws teammate Shane \\"Rawkus\\" Flaherty spoke with Megyn Kelly about the Overwatch League in a segment on The Today Show. Personal life Lyon was born in La Jolla, California, on July 28, 1996. Outside of esports, his interests include outdoor activities such as rock climbing and kayaking.1:40 Although Jake is known for being outspoken in and about Overwatch, he considers himself an introverted person, telling Blitz Esports \\"I always liked time alone and I never feel really relaxed unless I'm by myself\\". Lyon briefly studied economics at Denison University in Granville, Ohio before leaving to pursue a full-time career in esports.

The facility consisted in two electron beamlines to mimic the functionalities of the CLIC Drive Beam and Main Beam. The facility used the former assets of the LEP Pre-Injector (LPI) accelerator complex. LPI was primarily used to inject electrons and positrons into the CERN accelerator complex, to be ultimately delivered to Large Electron–Positron Collider (LEP). Following the LEP shut down in 2000, LPI ceased to provide beams to experiments (LPI provided beams directly to some experiments independent of LEP) in April 2001. Then work begun to convert LPI facility to be used for the CTF3. The conversion happened in stages, with the first stage (so-called Preliminary Phase) starting accelerator commissioning in September 2001.CERN Document Server  G. Geschonke and A. Ghigo (editors): CTF3 Design Report (2002) Retrieved on 31 July 2018 In the following years, LPI morphed into CTF3. The facility stopped its operation in December 2016, and one of its beamlines has been converted into the new CERN Linear Electron Accelerator for Research (CLEAR) facility. This page provides a general description of the facility with references to its main experimental program. More detailed informations can be found in the facility Design Report.  Description of the facility  Layout of the CLIC Test Facility at CERN (CTF3) showing its main parts. The beam path is identified by solid red lines. Accelerating structures, both longitudinal and transverse, are identified by green blocks on the beam path, while blue blocks represent Power Extraction and Transport Structures (PETS). The facility implemented and demonstrated the feasibility of a scaled version of the CLIC Drive Beam: a 1.2 μs-long electron beam (bunched at 1.5 GHz, and with 4 A mean current) was generated and accelerated up to ~135 MeV in a ~80 m-long LINAC by using fully loaded accelerating structures powered by ~40 MW, 3 GHz RF pulses. The beam was then going through a simplified version of the Drive Beam Recombination Complex (DBRC): a system composed of a delay loop and a combiner ring allowed to recombine different part of the incoming beam to finally produce a 140 ns-long train of bunches at 12 GHz and with mean current as high as 28 A. A second electron beam of lower intensity (a few bunches of about 100 pC/bunch), called Probe Beam, was generated and accelerated up to 200 MeV in the so-called \\"Concept d’Accélerateur Linéaire pour Faisceau d’Electrons Sonde\\" (CALIFES) injector. The main purpose of the Probe Beam was to emulate the main, colliding beam of CLIC.  Experimental program  The two electron beams produced at CTF3 were used to demonstrate the two-beam acceleration concept in the Two-Beam-Module installed into the CLEX experimental area: the Drive Beam was decelerated in special Power Extraction and Transfer Structures (PETS), and the power produced used to accelerate the Probe Beam with gradients as high as ~145 MeV/m. The facility served as test bed for other CLIC related R&D;, for example: * Beam Loading effect on RF breakdown rate. * Drive Beam deceleration efficiency studies. * Drive Beam phase stabilisation by using a novel feed- forward system.  CERN Linear Electron Accelerator for Research  View of the CERN Linear Electron Accelerator for Research (CLEAR) beamline seen from the end of the line beam dump. Thanks to its ease of operation and versatility, the Probe Beam was used also for activities not directly connected to CLIC. This triggered the interest of various communities, and a workshop was organised to discuss possible re-use of such a beamline. In December 2016, while CTF3 was ending its operation, it was then decided to transform the Probe Beam in a new general purpose R&D; facility under the name of CERN Linear Electron Accelerator for Research, or CLEAR. CLEAR keeps providing testing capabilities for X-band accelerator technology, including CLIC, but it also allows to explore novel concepts as plasma acceleration, THz radiation production. Furthermore, it provides electron irradiation capabilities to space and medical communities.

It was built between February and April 1942. It is also known as Y Station, 16 Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery and No. 2 Station, Gun Station 393. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 November 1999.  History  The Mount St John Anti-Aircraft gun station was constructed between February and April 1942 as part of the World War II air defences of Townsville, in an effort to monitor aircraft entering the nearby Garbutt Aerodrome. On 7 December 1941, the United States of America entered World War II following the bombing of Pearl Harbour in Hawaii by Japanese carrier-borne aircraft. The United Kingdom and its Commonwealth had been at war with Germany since September 1939, but now the war was truly global. Japan attacked the Philippines and Thailand, and advanced through Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies (now Indonesia). Singapore fell on 15 February 1942 and two brigades of the 8th Division of the 2nd Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) were captured, while the third brigade was destroyed piecemeal on the islands of Timor, Ambon and New Britain. The Japanese first bombed Darwin on 19 February 1942, and America's General Douglas MacArthur arrived in Australia on 17 March, after being ordered to leave the Philippines (which fell in early May). At this time Australia appeared in imminent danger of invasion, but two key naval battles reduced this threat. The battle of the Coral Sea, fought 4–8 May, prevented a Japanese invasion force from reaching Port Moresby, and the Battle of Midway, fought in early June 1942, crippled the offensive power of the Japanese aircraft carrier force. Australia now became the springboard for the Allied attempt to push back the Japanese. General MacArthur moved his General Headquarters, South West Pacific Area (GHQ, SWPA) from Melbourne to Brisbane on 20 July 1942, a day before the Japanese landed on the north coast of New Guinea in the Buna- Gona area and attempted to advance on Port Moresby via the Kokoda Track. In September another Japanese landing force was defeated at Milne Bay, the Japanese were halted at Imita Ridge on the Kokoda track, and the joint Australian-US effort to retake New Guinea began. Queensland played a major role in the build-up of troops and supplies for the counter-offensive. In late 1942 Townsville was the principle port for those Allied troops serving in the New Guinea campaign and Cleveland Bay between Magnetic Island and Townsville was an important assembly point for shipping. The Australian forces chose Townsville as the Area Combined Headquarters for the North East Area, while the American forces used Townsville as the headquarters of the United States Army Base Section Two and the Fourth Air Depot of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Between 1942 and 1945 the Townsville and Charters Towers region became one of the largest concentrations of airfields, stores, ammunition depots and port operations in the South West Pacific Theatre. After the raid on Darwin, many felt Townsville, the largest city in the North, would be the next to experience a large-scale raid. However, due to its distance from the front line, it could not be raided by land-based bombers, which had added to the devastation in Darwin. Thus any bombing attack would come from aircraft carriers or long range Kawanishi flying boats. Garbutt aerodrome was adequately defended. The 16 Heavy Anti-Aircraft (16 HAA) Battery was stationed in Townsville early in the war in the South West Pacific, with two separate units defending the airport and its approaches. No.1 Station, at Rowes Bay south of Pallarenda, was operational by 9 March 1942 with four guns in position. Construction of No.2 Station at Mount St John, located directly west of the Garbutt main north-south runway, commenced in February 1942 and was completed towards the end of April 1942; however, construction of the semi- underground command post did not commence until late 1942. Other Australian Army HAA positions in Townsville were built at Aitkenvale, The Strand, and Jimmy's Lookout (in Rowes Bay). No.2 Station was Townsville's largest and most modern anti-aircraft battery when completed. Hardly a mountain, more a small hill, the site included four concrete ammunition bunkers, four 3.7\\" guns of the latest design, and an underground command post and plotting room. The standard (static) HAA gun position used in Queensland during World War II had four hexagonal gun positions, with a semi-underground command post in the centre of the arc of the guns and a magazine for each gun, with all elements built with reinforced concrete. At Mount St John, the 3.7\\" gun positions consisted of a surface concrete platform, surrounded by a protective earth wall (most of the surrounding earth walls have since been removed). Another permanent type of HAA position used in Queensland had the emplacements sunk into the ground, with concrete walls around the pit, complete with ammunition recesses. No.2 Station's function was to observe all aircraft movements around Garbutt aerodrome and make sure that all aircraft followed the correct lane of entry. Any aircraft following an incorrect lane was to be fired on as an enemy aircraft. The Mount St John gun station was connected by phone to No. 3 Fighter Sector Headquarters (3FSHQ) Stuart (Operations and Signals Bunker), as well as various other installations and was staffed 24 hours a day. All four guns were in place by 11 March. However open sights, enabling the guns to be fired accurately, were not fitted till 22 March. At 1206 hours on 21 March 1942 the first Japanese aircraft of World War II was sighted over the city by observers at Kissing Point Battery. It was described in one report as \\"silvery underneath, wings like a Douglas, with the leading edge being tapered back\\". Another report described it as being a Japanese MC-20, however this is not feasible as this aircraft did not have the range. The Japanese aircraft that fits the description is the Mitsubishi G3M3; a twin engine bomber/reconnaissance aircraft. Possessing a range of , this aircraft was specifically designed for fast, long-range reconnaissance. It was the only twin-engine aircraft, which could make the distance from New Guinea, and was code-named Nell by the Allies later in 1942. It is shown on a pre-July aircraft recognition poster as the Type 96 Mitsubishi. The purpose of these reconnaissance missions was to locate airfields so a future strike could be arranged. It is possible that this particular aircraft was based in Lae or Salamaua, which had fallen on 8 March. US B17's operating out of Cloncurry, Charters Towers and Townsville had bombed both bases at least twice. The Kissing Point Battery spotted another aircraft the next day at the same time. That both aircraft were sighted at midday was significant; this time of the day was perfect for aerial photographic reconnaissance, as there were no shadows to distort objects on the ground. The Kissing Point Battery rang through to both No.1 and No.2 stations of 16 HAA but discovered the phone lines were down. Even if either unit had spotted the aircraft, they would not have been able to fire accurately, as open sights were not fitted until 22 March, the following day. The names of the batteries were changed with No.1 Station changed to X Station at Rowes Bay, and No.2 Station to Y Station at Mount St John. The first time both these stations fired on an enemy aircraft was on 1 May 1942. Intelligence recorded that: \\"At approximately 0945 hrs 16 A.A. Bty opened fire on enemy Recce aircraft flying at a great height. At approximately 1220 hrs U.S.A.A. Bty. opened fire on hostile aircraft, which made out to sea\\". When consulting single unit diaries a more detailed description of what occurred on 1 May emerged: \\"Planes were sighted by X Station at Palleranda [sic] at a height of approximately 24,000 feet, heading directly towards the aerodrome at Garbutt. X Station immediately went into action and with the first salvo caused the planes to change direction and climb steeply to 29,000 feet and out of range of the guns. Y Station at Mt St John also went into action at this stage. In all 33 rounds were fired 25 from the station at Pallarenda and 8 from the station at Mount St John\\". According to the unit diary, these two aircraft returned at 1140 hrs, releasing a balloon over Garbutt aerodrome at . The balloon descended and blew out to sea, the diary remarking that \\"tactics proved that they were enemy aircraft\\". The balloon was a radiosonde, or a dropsonde which was an instrument platform with radio transmitting capabilities. It contained instruments capable of taking air temperature, humidity and pressure measurements at different heights. Its descent provided an indirect measure of wind speed and direction at various atmospheric heights. The data was then transmitted back to the aircraft. This information was vital if a raid was to proceed on a target so that aircraft could bomb accurately. This was either a test run, or the preliminaries to a raid being planned. It is likely that these flying boats were from the 14th Kokutai (Air Group) based in Rabaul Harbour, located today in the East New Britain province of Papua New Guinea. Mount St John's Y Station was involved in more action. Prior to Townsville's first air raid on the night of 25/26 July 1942, the city received a warning that a raid would soon occur. This clue unfortunately went unheeded by military authorities. For three days prior to the first air raid on the city, AA units were on high alert, with yellow alerts and unidentified aircraft reports occurring more frequently than usual. At 0920 hrs on 22 July 1942, unidentified aircraft were seen flying at over Townsville. At 1000 hrs, Y Station at Mount St John reported \\"white balloon at 25,000 feet slowly descending\\". Once again the Japanese used dropsondes to record wind speed and direction at certain heights for a planned raid on Townsville. Townsville was attacked three times during late July 1942, by the 2nd Group of 14 Kokutai Japanese Naval Air Force, using Kawanishi H8K (Emily) four-engine flying boats based at Rabaul. On the night of 25/26 July two Emilys dropped bombs in the sea off Townsville's wharves. However, Y Station did not fire until a second raid early in the morning of 28 July. At 0220 hrs that day searchlights at Rowes Bay picked up a lone Emily at . After 20 rounds were fired from Y Station an explosion close to the nose of the aircraft occurred, causing it to drop its bomb load in an uninhabited area of nearby Many Peaks Range. During the third raid on the morning of 29 July 1942 an Emily dropped seven bombs in Cleveland Bay and one on a paddock at Oonoonba, and was intercepted and damaged by two US fighter aircraft. The minutes of meeting 126 of the Allied Works Council (Queensland Division), 1 December 1942 referred to the Mount St John position as Gun Station 393. On 31 July 1944 the 16th HAA Battery disbanded. Since the end of World War II, the Mount St John gun station has been sold and is now owned by a private company. Industrial development of the surrounding area has occurred, and parts of the west and east sides of Mount St John were quarried between the 1950s and the 1980s. In the later part of this period sections of one gun platform and the stairs of the two exposed magazines were removed and dumped nearby within the heritage boundary.  Description  The anti-aircraft gun station on the summit of Mount St John is located directly west of the Garbutt main north-south runway. The site is located on the road to the Townsville City Council's sewerage treatment plant off the Bruce Highway (Ingham Road). In 1999, physical remains of the Mount St John site comprised four ammunition magazines, four gun positions and a semi-underground command post/plotting room, all constructed from reinforced concrete. A fifth gun platform, for a light AA gun, is located just east of the command post, and the main camp site for Y Station was located at the base of the hill to the south of the gun emplacements. All magazines are of identical size, single-roomed and originally located underground with semi-concealed stairways, single steel doors and two metal ventilators on the roof. Two have had soil around them removed and are completely exposed. The stairs on these same two have been removed and are lying nearby. Mounds north of the gun emplacements may also contain material discarded from the station. The four gun positions are clearly visible. Two are hexagonally shaped platforms, the outer walkway on one being partly demolished, the remaining two appear to be circular, but originally would have been hexagonal. The anti-aircraft guns were of calibre and all four gun platforms still have the metal mounting rods in place. The semi-underground command post/plotting room is structurally intact and still possesses its metal entrance door. There is also evidence of a service road winding up the south side of the mountain.  Heritage listing  The Mount St John Anti- Aircraft Battery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Mount St John Anti-Aircraft Battery, a complex of gun positions, magazines and a command post (operational in April 1942) is important in demonstrating the measures taken to defend Townsville from Japanese air attack during World War II. Queensland was the main staging area for the Allied effort to drive the Japanese out of New Guinea, and Townsville provided vital port, airfield supply and supply facilities for Allied forces during the war in the South West Pacific. Due to its strategic importance, the city was bombed three times by Japanese long-range flying boats in July 1942, and Y Station fired at a Japanese aircraft during the second raid. The former Y Station of HAA is one of a series of extant World War II structures remaining in Townsville. It differs from the others in that it is the only remaining structure which was involved in action against hostile aircraft before and after the battle of the Coral Sea (fought in early May 1942). The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. Underground deposits of material on the site, buried since the end of the war, have the potential to reveal more information on the operation of HAA positions in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Mount St John Anti-Aircraft Battery is a good example of the standard HAA gun station complex used throughout Queensland, with four gun positions (in this case of a surface emplacement type), four magazines (two still buried), a semi- underground command post, a Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) position and camp site remnants at the base of the hill. The old road formation on the south side of the hill is also a part of the wartime infrastructure, and demonstrates how the site was accessed. Y Station is the most intact surviving example of the HAA defences of Townsville, and is one of the most intact HAA positions in Queensland. A number of HAA sites in Queensland were sited on high ground, when it was available. Y Station's location demonstrates its intended role in protecting Garbutt airfield to the north-east; therefore the sight lines between it and the airfield are important.

She founded and chaired the Muslim Union of Tunisian Women (UMFT) from 1936 to 1956. Biography She was born into an old Tunisian family of religious scholars (ulama), originally Ottoman, which dates back to Khodja Ali Al Hanafi, and Ottoman military imam of the army who came to Tunis for the battle conducted in 1574 at La Goulette against the army of Charles V. Bchira Ben Mrad was the daughter of Sheikh El Islam, Mohamed Salah Ben Mrad, and the granddaughter of a mufti of Tunis, Hmida Ben Mrad. Sallouha, her mother, is the daughter of another Sheikh El Islam, Mahmoud Belkhodja. Her father gave her and her sisters a traditional education and home tutoring provided by a family friend, the Sheikh Manachou. She married Ahmed Zahar. Activism After hearing a discussion between nationalist leaders on the dire situation of the country, attended notably by Mahmoud El Materi, Bchira Ben Mrad had the idea of creating a framework for women to be active in the national movement. In 1936, Ali Belhouane and other activists unsuccessfully organized a fair to raise money for North African students settled in France. Ben Mrad then decided to organize with women. She obtained the agreement of nationalist leaders Belhouane and Mongi Slim, initially skeptical, and created an organizing committee of Naima Ben Salah, Tewhida Ben Sheikh (the first woman physician in Tunisia), the Hajjaji girls (whose father is a minister), Hassiba Ghileb (granddaughter of Cheikh El Medina Sadok Ghileb) and Nabiha Ben Miled (wife of Ahmed Ben Miled): they managed to gather 9000 people in Dar El Fourati, remained a bourgeois family traders, and collected a significant amount of money given to nationalist leaders. A week later, in May 1936, she founded the UMFT, constituting the first Tunisian women's organization. With the support of her father and sisters, she published numerous articles in her father's journal, Shams al-Islam (The Sun of Islam). The UMFT worked with the Neo Destour. The association, which does not get its visa until 1951, established its statutes which aim to build knowledge among women, to direct them to education within the limits of morality and religion, and to promote institutions for young people and children. The permanent members of the office are Hamida Zahar (Secretary General and sister of Bchira), Tewhida Ben Sheikh, Nebiha Ben Miled, and Essia Ben Miled (sister of Bchira), Hassiba Ghileb, Souad Ben Mahmoud, Naima Ben Salah, Jalila Mzali, and Mongiya Ben Ezzeddine. Other women joined the UMFT as activists like Moufida Bourguiba, Wassila Ben Ammar, Radhia Haddad, and Fethia Mzali. Ben Mrad remained the president of the UMFT until its dissolution in 1956.

History The College was started in 1970 as a science senior college but by 1973 had switched from science to commerce. In 1979 the junior college was added, and in 1981 the post-graduate program (M.Com). This made St. Vincent College a full-fledged commerce college. A doctorate in business management was offered for two years but dropped. The need for the college was questioned in 1985 but the vote was in favour, and it continued to cater to the working youth of the city. In 2001 the Girls Association \\"Mother Teresa Vidyarthini Manch\\" was set up. The Ex-Students Association (VINCA) began officially in May 2011. In 2012 the college inaugurated the Diploma in Banking & Financial Management in collaboration with Loyola Institute of Business Administration (LIBA), Chennai, and the new specialization of Business Administration for M.Com. In 2013, Marketing Management for M.Com was added. In the academic year 2014-15, affiliation for the Diploma Programme was switched from LIBA to Pune University.

Rituals have a prescribed form, source, and sequence that include sacred objects, places, times and seasons, music, dance, texts, songs and words, and mediators (such as monks, spirit mediums, religious leaders, and traditional healers). Ritualcide may be linked to genocide. In particular, when regimes tamper with collective tradition, inhabitants become vulnerable and/or susceptible to spirit-based harm. Unprotected, angst and compliance increase while dissent decreases. The term ritualcide was coined by Peg LeVine in Love and Dread in Cambodia: Weddings, Births and Ritual Harm Under the Khmer Rouge, which emerged from an eight-year ethnographic study into Khmer Rouge weddings and Cambodian rituals (2010), as she studied ritual history before, during and after Democratic Kampuchea. The definition was expanded in 2015 when LeVine continued research at the Shoah Foundation, Center for Advanced Genocide Research. In October, 2016, ritualcide was introduced at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) in conjunction with Khmer Rouge activity between 1975 and 1979. LeVine described how ritual loss complicates the aftermath of trauma for the living and the dead, and ruptures the cosmological order that binds ancestors. Without access to reliable, traditional ritual sources, collective fear and vulnerability increase for survivors. In genocide and Holocaust studies, ritual restoration holds relevance for recovery by survivors and ancestors, and their collective sense of protection and cultural continuity.

In early February 1971, PAVN forces swept RLA defenders from a line of hilltop positions guarding the royal capital of Luang Prabang. The city's perceived invulnerability to attack was shattered. King Sisavang Vatthana refused to leave his capital. Other Military Regions of Laos hastily forwarded to Luang Prabang's Military Region 1 any troops that could be spared from the rest of the Laotian Civil War. On 7 April, the resulting patchwork force of RLA battalions, Forces Armee Neutraliste half regiment, and Central Intelligence Agency-backed Special Guerrilla Units managed a three-pronged offensive supported by tactical aviation that surrounded and defeated the invading PAVN 335th Independent Regiment, which had gotten within eight kilometers of Luang Prabang. By 5 June 1971, the 335th was in full retreat. Overview As early as April 1953, during the First Indochina War, Vietnamese communist forces under General Võ Nguyên Giáp invaded northern Laos with four divisions. With four to one odds in their favor, the Vietnamese did not complete their capture of the royal capital of Luang Prabang. The Viet Minh contented themselves with establishing a base area in Houaphanh Province, adjacent to the set piece Battle of Dien Ben Phu that would decide the war.Castle, pp. 9--11. When personally asked by General Raoul Salan on 23 April 1953 if he would evacuate Luang Prabang, King Sisavang Vong elected to remain, thus committing the French to defense of the royal capital. The king's decision was at least partially responsible for the French commitment to Dien Ben Phu the following year. On 24 April, the Blind Bonze Pho Sathou predicted, without leaving his temple, that the North Vietnamese invasion would recede back northward. On the 30th, still in his wat, the Blind Bonze predicted that the communists were not en route to conquer the administrative capital of Vientiane; the latter fact was verified within a few days by French military intelligence.Fall, pp. 52-54. On 9 May, the Vietnamese began to withdraw from their positions outside Luang Prabang, as foreseen by Sathou. Later, French intelligence discovered that a French unit had destroyed a crucial logistics center along the communist supply route to Luang Prabang; the Vietnamese invasion had been starved out. However, the Vietnamese once again attacked Luang Prabang, beginning 27 January 1954. Despite having committed the 308th Division, 148th Independent Regiment, and some additional troops to the effort, the invasion was blunted, with French defense forces taking heavy casualties. On 20 February 1954, the communists once again began to retreat to North Vietnam; however, they left behind a shadow administration of Pathet Lao (PL).Fall, pp. 54-56. The \\"blind bonze\\" incident established a legend of Luang Prabang's invulnerability that would influence its defense during the Laotian Civil War. Background In February 1971, North Vietnamese troops attacked and captured a string of hilltop positions forming a defensive line northeast of Luang Prabang. The communists had previously struck at the Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) and the Lima 54 airfield in Military Region 1 (MR 1) without touching the city. Now they seemed poised to overrun it. The general belief that Pathet Lao respect for King Savang Vatthana protected Luang Prabang from assault suddenly seemed questionable. To guarantee the monarchy's succession, the crown prince was moved south to Vientiane. The threat to the monarchy energized the Royal Lao Armed Forces. In contrast to their usual parsimonious ways, commands of other Military Regions readily provided troops to protect King Sisavang Vatthana.Conboy, Morrison, p. 293. Reinforcements for Luang Prabang were rushed in from the other Military Regions. Bataillon Parachutistes 101 was immediately diverted from a pending offensive on the Bolovens Plateau in Military Region 4 (MR 4). Military Region 5 (MR 5) forwarded Bataillon Commando 205 from Vientiane. Both battalions were forwarded to a position 14 kilometers northeast of the capital, at the juncture of the Nam Soung and Mekong Rivers. On 22 March, the communists drove the Royalist infantry from their position on the King's farm and took it over. A Royal Lao Army (RLA) artillery battalion joined the retreat, resetting its guns on the Luang Prabang airfield. Dawn 23 March 1971 found the 335th Independent Regiment of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) just eight kilometers from Luang Prabang, tasked with capturing it. They were faced by several understrength RLA battalions and a single 105mm artillery battery. Bataillon Guerrier 121 (BG 121) was ordered to push back the communists, but had no success.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 293, 311 note 46. The other two Batallion Guerriers assigned to MR 1 were recalled from the field and placed into defensive locations. Meanwhile, reinforcements poured in from across the nation. MR 3 forwarded two battalions from Savannakhet. Military Region 2 (MR 2) shifted Bataillon Guerrier 227 (BG 227) from its recruitment drive, across the Regional border into MR 1. Forces Armées Neutralistes also dispatched half a regiment consisting of two of its battalions from MR 2. Military Region 5 supplied a battalion from Vientiane, and another from Sayaboury Province. MR 5 also came up with other reinforcements--a gunboat squadron on the Mekong River, five M-706 armored cars, and both 105mm and 155mm howitzers. Activities With three monarchist commands involved--Royal Lao Army, Neutralists, CIA-backed guerrillas--coordination became essential. Even as they consulted, the communists pushed BG 121 and some allied military irregulars back towards the capital. Meanwhile, the conference planned a three part counterattack with air support from both the RLAF and the U.S. Air Force.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 293-294. On 7 April 1971, Operation Xieng Dong began with the two MR 3 battalions being airlifted to a spot 17 kilometers east of Luang Prabang. On the 9th, they were strengthened by an added battalion and a heavy weapons company. They then swept westward to dislodge a PAVN battalion occupying the village of Ban Nathan. On 17 April, they captured Ban Nathan after a three-day fight. On the 20th, a fourth Royalist battalion was airlifted in. The Groupement Mobile 32 (GM 32) regiment was complete for its pursuit northward after the communists.Conboy, Morrison, p. 294. While that sweep worked its way back toward Luang Prabang, MR 1's own local battalions began to move northward against little resistance. By 24 April 1971, they had reached the south bank of the Nam Soung where it ran into the Mekong. On 15 May, they were helilifted over the Nam Soung to its northern bank. The 335th PAVN Regiment was now penned against the Mekong by the eastern and southern monarchist movements. In late May, the third prong of the Xieng Dong offensive finally moved east, with its two RLA battalions crossing the Mekong north of the communists. The 335th was surrounded and cut off, briefly tried a breakout on 5 June 1971, then retreated back towards North Vietnam to be reconstituted. Result Operation Xieng Dong successfully defended the royal capital. Aftermath The 335th PAVN Regiment, having been withdrawn from its usual station in Military Region 1, was replaced by the 8th Independent Regiment so the PAVN could maintain their presence.Conboy, Morrison, p. 334 note 2. The heavy weapons company committed to Operation Xieng Dong was not relinquished to form the 324th Heavy Weapons Battalion. As a result, all MR 3's GM regiments had a heavy weapons company parceled out to them because the 324th could not be formed.Conboy, p. 306. NotesReferences * Castle, Timothy N. (1993).

He had further brushes with the law but seized business opportunities and became quite prosperous. He and his brother were then joined by a contingent of brothers and sisters who made their mark in New South Wales and South Australian business and politics. Early life, crime and punishment Vaiben and his brother Emanuel Solomon were arrested at a boarding house in Northallerton on the evening of 16 October 1816, charged with having broken into a farm house and stealing a quantity of clothing, the property of Thomas Prest, some of which they had already sold. They were subsequently committed for trial at the Durham Assizes, which took place on 6 August 1817. They were found guilty of theft, but not of breaking and entering (which was then a capital offence) and sentenced to transportation for seven years. They were taken away to Woolwich, where they were incarcerated in a hulk named Justitia moored in the River Thames. They were taken aboard the Lady Castlereagh which around mid-December 1817 set sail for Australia, arriving at Port Jackson on 30 April 1818. Governor Macquarie would only allow thirty-nine prisoners to disembark, and ordered the captain to take the remaining 261 to Van Diemens Land, compensating the ship's owners for the change of plans. The two Solomon boys, who were among the latter contingent, were not model prisoners, and after committing a theft of clothes were on 3 March 1821 sent in irons to Newcastle, New South Wales for three years, shortly before its dismemberment as a penal settlement. The boys received their Certificates of Release in Sydney in August 1824. Prosperity The means by which Emanuel and Vaiben made their way from poor emancipists to relative affluence is by no means clear but must have been by a series of small-time trading and gradual accretion. But by July 1826 he was in a position to begin employing labour, having written to the authorities to have the convict David Myers assigned to him at his business in King Street, Sydney. By 1928 he had premises to let at 74 George Street, which may have fallen through, as the following year the two brothers were in partnership at that same address. They continued in partnership for over ten years, buying and selling whenever they could see a financial advantage. In 1831 Vaiben bought into the Jamieson subdivision. In 1836 he opened a tailoring establishment in George Street, and in September that year purchased of land in Brighton. He maintained the partnership with his brother Emanuel, for a time acting as agents for the ship Nereus, and when Emanuel moved to Adelaide, acting as agents for each other. They owned the brig Dorset, which ferried goods and passengers between the two cities, often making the return trip in 30 days. They built the Queen's Theatre, Adelaide in 1840, just in time for the Depression brought about by Governor Grey's financial stringency following Governor Gawler's profligacy. The theatre, managed by John Lazar, folded after a year. As trade between the two colonies dried up, and with increased competition from rival brig Emma, relations between the two brothers became strained, Emanuel accusing Vaiben of insufficient zeal and lack of communication.*Richards, E. S. (1975) The fall and rise of the brothers Solomon Journal of Proceedings of the Australian Jewish History Society, Vol VIII, Part 2, pp. 1-28. In 1844 Emanuel made it to Sydney to confront Vaiben; they dissolved partnership. Coincidentally, and largely due to the opening of copper mines in Burra and Kapunda, the economy of South Australia rebounded and Emanuel, who had by virtue of the strictest economy, retained most of his assets, profited hugely in partnership with his young nephew Judah Moss Solomon; his shares in the South Australian Mining Association repaid him handsomely. Horningsea Park, restored and now heritage-listed Vaiben did not reach quite the same peak of wealth and prestige, but he was still hugely wealthy, as evidenced by the wills of his spinster daughters. He and his sons David, Abraham and Saul, in partnership as V. Solomon and Sons, purchased in 1855 the estate \\"Horningsea\\", near Liverpool, New South Wales, with its grand, but somewhat dilapidated, mansion, and renamed it Horningsea Park. Vaiben and his family lived there and ran the farm. Vaiben withdrew from the partnership in April 1857. His sons continued as D., A. & S. Solomon; they left the district in 1872. During his life Vaiben accumulated a considerable portfolio of properties. Family Vaiben married Mary \\"Sarah\\" Smith (c. 1809 – 18 May 1879) in 1826. He and some of his family were practising Jews; contributing to the building of the first synagogue in Sydney.

It was built in 1886. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Rosebank, a substantial, single-storeyed timber residence, was erected for well-known Townsville identities Rose and Andrew Ball. Andrew Ball was one of the first Europeans to explore the Cleveland Bay district, and is acknowledged as the founder of Townsville. In 1864 he was managing Woodstock Station (to the south of Ross River) for pastoralists Robert Towns and John Melton Black (who together owned Jarvisfield and Woodstock cattle runs and Fanning Downs and Victoria Downs sheep stations), when Black asked Ball to explore the country to the north, to find a suitable wharfage site at Cleveland Bay from which to handle station produce. Ball, accompanied by Mark Watt Reid and two Aboriginal stockmen, set out in April 1864 and eventually found the mouth of what later was called the Ross River. The site Ball selected for a wharf and port was on Ross Creek, a tributary of Ross River. Lying beneath the huge sandstone outcrop of Castle Hill, the location reminded Ball of Castletown, the capital of the Isle of Man, and that was what he called the place. When a government town site was surveyed here in 1865, the name was changed officially from Castletown to Townsville, in honour of Robert Towns. Andrew Ball was occupied for the next few years with pastoral work before returning to Townsville in the late 1860s, and was a partner in Ball & Grimaldi, Townsville, in 1869. In 1877 he married Mrs Rose O'Neill, widow and licensee of the Exchange Hotel in Flinders Street since 1873. The Exchange had been erected in 1869 by Edward Head and was made the terminus for the Ravenswood coach service in 1870, but it was the popular Rose O'Neill who improved the hotel's reputation and nearly doubled its size in the mid-1870s. Rose O'Neill eventually purchased the hotel and following her marriage to Andrew Ball and his taking over of the licence in 1877, the Exchange became one of the most popular hotels in town. Ball was charming and widely known, with business interests both in Townsville and on the goldfields (Ravenswood and Charters Towers), and together, he and Rose developed a large and loyal cliental at the Exchange. In 1881 the two-storeyed timber hotel was destroyed by fire, but Townsville was booming and Ball immediately rebuilt in brick, the substantial new two-storeyed Exchange Hotel opening in 1882. That year Andrew Ball gave up the licence, he and Rose retiring from hotel work but retaining numerous Townsville business interests. They resided at West End for some years before moving to Rosebank in the mid-1880s. Rosebank, circa 1892 In January 1885 Rose Ball acquired title to a 20 acre site about out of town, southwest along the Charters Towers road, at a time when the western and southwestern suburbs of Townsville were emerging as fashionable addresses for successful Townsville businesspersons. On this property Rose and Andrew Ball erected Rosebank, a large timber residence picturesquely situated overlooking a small lagoon and creek (now filled in and part of Mindham Park). The front entrance drive from the main road crossed a causeway and two bridges over the creek/lagoon, then became a circular drive lined by bunya pines and mango trees, surrounding a large rose garden in the front yard. The back approach to the house passed through banyan and Moreton Bay fig trees. Rosebank was developed as a self- sufficient semi-rural estate, with a dairy, cowyard, chicken run, vegetable garden, stables and various storage and fodder sheds, and an underground water supply. Rose Ball also developed a very fine flower garden and bush house at Rosebank, which were famous in the Townsville district. Andrew Ball died at Rosebank in September 1894, aged 62, and his widow remained there until her death in February 1925, aged 83. In January 1912 their only daughter, Annie Alice May, married lawyer Robert Johnstone Douglas (son of Queensland Premier, John Douglas), later a Supreme Court Judge. Mr & Mrs Douglas are understood to have resided at Rosebank from 1912, when they employed Townsville builder E Crowder to renovate the building. The renovations included the installation of a number of pressed metal ceilings, removal of a partition wall to form a library, enlargement of the dining room by opening up the sewing room and pantry, and extension of the kitchen. The verandah floorboards also were replaced at this time. In 1919, title to the property was transferred from Mrs Ball to her daughter. In 1903 and again in 1971 the house was damaged by cyclones and the owners carried out major alterations and refurbishment to parts of the structure in 1912 and 1972. Blocks of land on the left side of the house were sold off in the first part of this century and in 1940 the local Council resumed the watercourse in front of Rosebank to create public parkland, reducing the 8.094 hectare property to the house block of today. The Douglas family, one of whom became a leading physician in Townsville, owned the house until September, 1972 when it was purchased by the Lillicrap family who undertook renovations to make it more functional. The Lillicrap family, after many years sold the house to the family that still owns it.  Description  Rosebank is a substantial, single-storeyed, timber house resting on low brick piers, with a short-ridge roof of corrugated-iron, wide surrounding verandahs and a detached kitchen wing at the rear, accessed from the back verandah. The single-skinned external walls have deep chamferboards with exposed stud-framing. Decorative details include cast-iron cresting and finials on the roof, cross-braced timber balustrading and ornate timber brackets on the verandahs, and a finial and fretwork bargeboards to the small gabled entrance portico at the front. The interior has some fine pressed metal ceilings, which have been restored, and early 20th century light fittings. The kitchen and bathroom of the service wing have been modernised. A double brick garage and pool at the left of the house are late 20th century additions. While some of the mango trees remain, more recent cottage gardens have been established. The house is fronted by Townsville City Council parkland which was part of the original property.  Heritage listing  Rosebank was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Rosebank, erected , survives as important evidence of the development of Townsville as the principal port of north Queensland in the 1880s, when businesses were consolidating, the principal commercial premises were being re-built in brick, and fine gentlemen's residences were being established in the western and southwestern suburbs. Its imposing style reflects the prosperity of its owners and of the region during the boom period of the 1880s. Renovations in the 1910s and 1970s testify to its continued use as an elite residence for well over a century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Rosebank is an excellent example of a substantial, decorative, timber residence of the mid-1880s, complete with detached kitchen house, standing in the remnants of larger grounds and garden The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The house remains highly intact, and together with the surviving grounds, is important for its aesthetic qualities. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Rosebank is considered one of Townsville's finest colonial homes, and has a strong association for the residents of Townsville with the early development of their city. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It is important also for its close association with Andrew and Rose Ball, prominent and early Townsville residents, Andrew Ball being acknowledged as the founder of Townsville.

Estudiantes achieved promotion to Primera B Nacional after winning its group in the 2014 Torneo Federal A. History The club was established at the initiative of a group of students of Escuela Normal Juan Pringles, on June 20, 1920. After commemorating the anniversary of Manuel Belgrano's death, they met to form a club, being Carlos Pino elected as president. The club was named \\"Sportivo Estudiantes\\" (\\"students\\" in Spanish), adopting the green and white colors that represented hope and purity respectively. The Government of San Luis donated the club a land on Constitución street of the city. In August 1920 the \\"Unión Puntana de Football\\" (current Liga Sanluiseña) was established, being Estudiantes the first champion ever. The format was a single round-robin tournament, with all the games played at \\"Cancha del Internado\\" (located in the Infantry Regiment of the city). Estudiantes' first venue was located on Bolívar street, between Sucre and San Juan streets. Estudiantes became the first club in the city to have its own stadium.\\"Historia del club que nació campeón\\" In the 2000s, Sportivo Estudiantes was notable for having won 3 consecutive promotions to upper divisions, starting with the 2012 Torneo Argentino C (5th division) championship until its most recent achievement when the team got promotion to the 2nd division, Primera B Nacional, in November 2014.

Andrew Ball (died 1894) was a pioneer in Townsville, Queensland, Australia. He is also credited with the European discovery of its site.  Early life  Andrew Ball was the son of James Creighton Ball and his wife Hannah (née Leeky). Townsville pioneer Andrew Ball was one of the first Europeans to explore the Cleveland Bay district, and is acknowledged as the founder of Townsville. In 1864 he was managing Woodstock Station (to the south of Ross River) for pastoralists Robert Towns and John Melton Black (who together owned Jarvisfield and Woodstock cattle runs and Fanning Downs and Victoria Downs sheep stations), when Black asked Ball to explore the country to the north, to find a suitable port at Cleveland Bay from which to handle station produce. Ball, accompanied by Mark Watt Reid and two Aboriginal stockmen, set out in April 1864 and eventually found the mouth of what later was called the Ross River. The site Ball selected for a wharf and port was on Ross Creek, a tributary of Ross River. Lying beneath the huge sandstone outcrop of Castle Hill, the location reminded Ball of Castletown, the capital of the Isle of Man, and that was what he called the place. When a government town site was surveyed here in 1865, the name was changed officially from Castletown to Townsville, in honour of Robert Towns. Andrew Ball was occupied for the next few years with pastoral work before returning to Townsville in the late 1860s, and was a partner in Ball & Grimaldi, Townsville, in 1869. In 1877 he married Mrs Rose O'Neill, widow and licensee of the Exchange Hotel in Flinders Street since 1873. The Exchange had been erected in 1869 by Edward Head and was made the terminus for the Ravenswood coach service in 1870, but it was the popular Rose O'Neill who improved the hotel's reputation and nearly doubled its size in the mid-1870s. Rose O'Neill eventually purchased the hotel and following her marriage to Andrew Ball and his taking over of the licence in 1877, the Exchange became one of the most popular hotels in town. Ball was charming and widely known, with business interests both in Townsville and on the goldfields (Ravenswood and Charters Towers), and together, he and Rose developed a large and loyal cliental at the Exchange. In 1881 the two-storeyed timber hotel was destroyed by fire, but Townsville was booming and Ball immediately rebuilt in brick, the substantial new two-storeyed Exchange Hotel opening in 1882. That year Andrew Ball gave up the licence, he and Rose retiring from hotel work but retaining numerous Townsville business interests. They resided at West End for some years before moving to Rosebank in the mid-1880s. In January 1885 Rose Ball acquired title to a 2-acre site about 3 miles out of town, southwest along the Charters Towers road, at a time when the western and southwestern suburbs of Townsville were emerging as fashionable addresses for successful Townsville businesspersons. On this property Rose and Andrew Ball erected Rosebank, a large timber residence picturesquely situated overlooking a small lagoon and creek (now filled in and part of Mindham Park). Today Rosebank is within the suburb of Mysterton.  Later life  Andrew Ball died at Rosebank on 27 September 1894 aged 62, the oldest resident of Townsville. As he was highly respected, flags in Townsville were hung at half-mast. He was buried in a graveside service with Church of England rites conducted by Rev. Pike on 28 September 1894, at the largest funeral held in Townsville. At Ball's request, he was buried next to friend and fellow pioneer William Kirk in the West End Cemetery. His widow Rose remained at Rosebank until her death in February 1925, aged 83. In January 1912 their only daughter, Annie Alice May, married lawyer (later Supreme Court Judge) Robert Johnstone Douglas, son of Queensland Premier, John Douglas.  Legacy  On Sunday 1 November 1964, a monument commemorating the \\"100th Anniversary of Settlement in Townsville\\" was unveiled on The Strand, with particular mention made of four men: Robert Towns, Andrew Ball, Mark Watt Reid and John Melton Black. As at 2020, the monument is located in Anzac Memorial Park between the Centenary Fountain and the bandstand ().

The expedition plundered Brittany, and then landed in Gascony. They advanced on Bordeaux 28 March 1295, but failed to take the town. Retiring to Bayonne, the earl of Lancaster died on 6 June 1295 and his forces returned to England. In 1295 France and Scotland enter the Treaty of Paris, agreeing to mutual support in face of conflict with England, and subsequently termed the ‘Auld Alliance.’ Edward I tried to raise forces to pursue further war with France, but Bohun and other earls resisted this goal. In March 1297 Parliament was held at Salisbury, and Edward I pressed the issue, but events in Scotland changed his direction. As fighting broke out again, William Wallace sacked Lanark Castle in May 1297. On 5 August 1297 the King provided John Devereux with letters of protection for the next year while he is on the king's service overseas.Major General Hon. George Wrottesley (editor).

Page 75 to 77 Nicholas III Devereux of Chanston, John's nephew, and his coparceners (David le Seriaunt, John and Sarah Ragun with their son John, and Maud widow of Richard le Bret) claimed portions of the manor, and contested Hugh Devereux's grant to John and Eva Devereux. Nicholas III Devereux of Chanston claimed a third part of Chanston that he held at the time of Hugh's death. He showed evidence that Hugh had granted all his rights in this land that comprised the dower of Isabel, widow of Nicholas II Devereux of Chanston and mother of Hugh, in the village of Aynaldestone, and that this occurred prior to any grant to John Devereux. David le Serriaunt made claim to 5 acres that similarly Hugh had granted him. John and Eva Devereux countered that their grant came first. John and Sarah Ragun with their under-age son, John, put forward their claim of 6 marks of rent in the manor that they were to hold for 5 years. These issues were held over until the octave of Michaelmas (6 October 1308) Maud le Bret contested 12 acres of meadow that was granted by Hugh to the Raguns for life, which Hugh afterwards granted the reversion to Richard and Maud le Bret and their heirs (Richard le Bret Junior). These issues were further held over until the quindene of Easter (14 April 1309). Due to John, son of John and Sarah Ragun, being under-age, it was judged he could not attorn until he came of age. Marriage John Devereux married Joan de Eylesford, the daughter of Walter de Eylesford before 1283. They had a son: *John Devereux the YoungerH.C. Maxwell Lyte (editor).

The complaint was changed because it was sealed at another time by a fine of 40 shillings, and the fine is enrolled. On 28 March 1321 protection was granted for 3 years to John Devereux while on the king’s service in Ireland with Ralph de Gorges. On 18 December 1324 dower was assigned to the widow of Ralph de Gorges, Eleanor. Her attorney for these proceedings was John Devereux. On 4 September 1325 protection was provided to John Devereux who was in the retinue of Hugh de Courtenay when he went with the king. On 1 November 1325, John, son and heir of John Devereux, enrolled a general release to Richard de Wynslade of all actions in all lands, rents, and services in Leche Turvyle (Eastleach, Gloucester). Among the witnesses was John le Machon who was identified as one of his father’s men in a complaint of 1302. John married a second time to a woman named Eva who survived him. They had no children. Lord of Munsley John Devereux held the title of Lord of Munsley, and lands in Burton and Cranford, Northamptonshire. Burton Latimer (or Aylesford's Manor) comprised a third of the township of Burton. In 1242 it was held by Henry de Aldwinkle, probably only for life, and was obtained by Wischard Ledet when he relinquished his claim on the original manor of Burton to Alan de Dinant. His heir was his daughter, Christina, who married first Henry de Braybroc and second Gerard de Furnival.Anthony Story.

Alice married John le Latimer, and Christina married William le Latimer. Christina, wife of Gerard de Furnival, died between 1266 and 1270, and Burton passed to her daughter, Christina, the wife of William Latimer. Beginning in 1273 the Latimers failed to send the 75 shillings from Burton required for the guard of Rockingham Castle. William de Aylesford (or Eylesford) held Burton from the Latimer's for the rent of 1 ounce of silk or 12 shillings a year. On 14 October 1280 the inquisition post mortem of William de Eylesford of Burton showed him holding the manor of Burton.J E E S Sharp (editor). Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, Volume 2, Edward I. (London: Public Record Office, 1906), pp. 201-209, entry 374 accessed 13 January 2016. He was found not to be liable for the 75 shillings. On William de Eylessford death, Burton passed to his brother, Walter de Eylessford. Walter gave it and other tenements to his daughter, Joan, and her first husband. Following the death of her first husband without issue, Joan married John Devereux before 1283, and they had issue. John Devereux held ½ knights’ fee at Burton, and 1 hide of land at Cranford on the Roll of Fees of 1284. When Walter de Eylesford died in 1292, Joan had already died. Gerard de Eylessford brought suit against his brother-in-law, John Devereux, over the tenements given to Joan. Gerard claimed the tenements by a writ of morte d’ancestor.An assize of mort d'ancestor was a writ filed when after the decease of a man's ancestor, a stranger abated and entered into the estate. Gerard, who was underage at the time, protested that his father, Walter, had held the property at his death, and John had no right to it after the death of Joan de Eylessford. John Devereux attested that they were given to Joan and her heirs during her first marriage. As that marriage was without issue, it passed to John with their marriage, and now should go to their issue, John Devereux Junior. The judgment was for John Devereux. Following the judgment for Devereux, he would hold this title for the remainder of his life.

Afterdrop is attributed to the return of cold blood from the extremities to the core due to peripheral vasodilatation, thus causing a further decrease of deep body temperature. However a second theory explains afterdrop as a side effect of conductive heat transfer. \\"The hypothermic patient cools from the outside in. Consequently, a heat gradient is established from the relatively warm core to the cool periphery. This heat gradient does not reverse immediately upon initiation of rewarming. Until the gradient is reversed, further heat transfer occurs from the warmer core to cooler peripheral tissues.\\" In severe cases, afterdrop can lead to post-rescue collapse, but has not been shown to be of any clinical importance in rewarming the hypothermic patient. Afterdrop is not observed in the rewarming of all hypothermic patients. It is more common in patients who were rapidly cooled or rewarmed. Afterdrop was less common in patients for whom rewarming was delayed, or when cooling was slow and prolonged.
