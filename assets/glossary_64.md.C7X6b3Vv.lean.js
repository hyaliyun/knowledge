Pickering (24 November 1941 ‚Äì 5 January 1995) was an Australian rules footballer who played with North Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Early life & family Pickering was the son of Wally Pickering, who was a legendary forward for Stawell. Wally Pickering played in the club's inaugural Wimmera Football League premiership in 1939. From 1956 to 1959, Pickering went to St Patrick's College, Ballarat. Football career Pickering, a ruckman from Stawell, was sought by both Essendon and North Melbourne. Secured by the latter, Picking made three appearances early in the 1961 VFL season, before he was sidelined with an ankle injury and then a dislocated elbow, which ended his season. It wasn't until the 16th round of the 1962 season that he returned to senior football, a game against Melbourne at Arden Street Oval, in which he kicked three goals. The following round, at Kardinia Park, he kicked another three goals, from a forward pocket. His next appearance, in round 18, would be his last for North Melbourne. He decided to return to Stawell in 1963 and remained with the club for many years, finishing his Wimmera career with 220 games and three club best and fairest awards. In 1969 he was the joint leading vote getter in the Toohey Medal, with Nhill's Rod Coutts, but lost on countback. The league decided in 2003 to award retrospective medals to all players who finished second on countback, which included Pickering. His son, Liam Pickering, a former North Melbourne and Geelong footballer, collected the award on behalf of his father, who died in 1995.

Kozhichal shares its boundaries with Kodagu district of Karnataka state towards the east, rest of the Kannur district towards west and south and the district of Kasaragod towards north.Chathamangalam Theruvamala Inception Kozhichal came into existence during the Malabar migration, a large scale influx of mainly Syrian Christians from the early decades of 20th century through the end of 20th century to the northern districts of Kasaragod,Kannur, Kozhikode and Wayanad, most parts of which were uninhabited at that time. Kozhichal served as a hub for those migrated to the north eastern parts of Kannur district, with the towns of Pulingome Rajagiri(a near village) and Cherupuzha. The name of the town is credited (though still a matter of dispute among villagers) to the abundance of Chickens in the region and a river that passes through the town. Kozhichal today Today the town houses a lower primary school (St. Augustine's LP School), a branch of the Kerala Gramin Bank, an office of the Indian postal department, a Roman Catholic church (St. Sebastien's Church of the Arch Diocese of Tellicherry) and a number of shops that cater to the various day-to-day needs of the villagers. The population of Kozhichal is mainly constituted by Christians. The language spoken is Malayalam despite the town's close proximity to the Kannada speaking district of Kodagu in the State of Karnataka. This is due to the situation that the border areas are not inhabited by humans. Both Christian as well Hindu migrants converse in the Travancore Dialect of Malayalam. Controversies The town witnessed a few months of trouble as the Government Of India temporarily decided to go ahead with implementing the Kasthuri Rangan Report which deals with imposing strict rules on construction of new buildings, farming etc. in view of conserving the Western Ghats. The villagers protested against the government's decision locally, backed by the Catholic Church. Transport Kozhichal is well connected with the nearest city of Payyanur by road which is situated 42 kilometers from Kozhichal. Several privately owned transport companies operate services to and from Kozhichal. The state run KSRTC also operates services through the town. The first bus service through the town was Rajagiri(town near kozhichal) To Kottayam KSRTC bus which connected the migrants to their home towns in the district of Kottayam. Auto Rikshaw is the most common local method of transport. The new Rajagiri(a town near kozhichal)-Cherupuzha hill highway through the town will be a new addition to the town's transport needs.

Recording Lewis's fourth Mercury album of 1971 includes his radical arrangement of the Kris Kristofferson classic \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\". Although producer Jerry Kennedy avoided releasing singles in the country market that featured Jerry Lee's trademark \\"boogie woogie\\" piano style, by late 1971 Lewis had amassed so many country hits that Kennedy began to alter his approach. As Colin Escott writes in the liner notes to the 2006 retrospective A Half Century of Hits, \\"Since the country breakthrough in 1968, Lewis's records had been spare, unornamented and unremittingly slow-paced. After three years Kennedy decided to break out of the artistic straitjacket. When Lewis arrived at Mercury's studio in August 1971 he was greeted by a 10-piece string section rehearsing a Kris Kristofferson song. Kennedy wanted to give the big-budget treatment to 'Me and Bobby McGee'. The song had been a country hit for Roger Miller and a pop hit for Janis Joplin, and so if Lewis was to do it, he would have to rethink it. And that's what he did. In losing Kristofferson's whimsicality, he created a new song.\\" In addition to Kristofferson, Merle Haggard had been another writer Lewis kept returning to during his impressive run, this time recording the honky-tonk \\"drinkin' song\\" \\"Swinging Doors\\". Would You Take Another Chance on Me? does betray a \\"countrypolitan\\" influence, containing more elaborate productions that were becoming more common on country radio largely due to the influence of Billy Sherrill, who was enjoying tremendous success at Epic Records producing Lewis's old Sun label-mate Charlie Rich and Tammy Wynette by employing strings and layered background vocalists to create a Phil Spector- like \\"wall of sound\\". As Lewis's behaviour became more erratic as the decade wore on, Kennedy would do his best to keep his artist relevant in the country charts by turning more towards this sweetened sound. Reception The album's title track became Lewis's second number one country hit of 1971, and \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\" would crack the top 40 on the pop charts, the first time he had done so since 1961. The album itself peaked at number three on the Billboard country albums chart.

Two brothers of his were priests ‚Äì following the example of their paternal uncle ‚Äì and Passi himself moved to Venice in order to dedicate himself to both his preaching and educational missions. Passi's beatification was celebrated on 13 April 2013. Life Passi was born in 1789 in Bergamo as the first of eleven children to the nobles Enrico Passi (a teacher) and Caterina Corner in the province of Bergamo; two brothers were the priests Giuseppe Celio and Marco. His paternal uncle was the priest Marco Celio Passi. In his childhood volatile political circumstances forced the family to relocate to a villa in Calcinate. In 1810 he became the director of the confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament at Calcinate and in 1811 became the director of the confraternity of the Christian Doctrine. Passi began his studies for the priesthood in 1811 and was ordained as such on 13 March 1813. His brother Marco aided him in founding the Pious Society of Saint Dorothy in 1815 for the education of both children and adolescents. This was an establishment that Pope Pius VII praised and who also encouraged that the organization expand and spread to other towns in the region. In 1838 he founded the Teaching Sisters of Saint Dorothy. Pope Gregory XVI granted him the title of \\"Apostolic Missionary\\". Passi died on 18 April 1866. Beatification The beatification process commenced on 6 March 1981 under Pope John Paul II and Passi became titled as a Servant of God; Cardinal Marco C√© inaugurated the cognitional process in Venice on 10 May 1982 and this process later concluded on 9 November 1983 while the Congregation for the Causes of Saints later validated this process on 10 April 1986. The C.C.S. received the Positio from the postulation in 1996 with historians first assessing and approving the cause on 24 November 1998. Theologians approved this on 8 November 2005 as did the C.C.S. on 15 May 2007; Pope Benedict XVI named the late priest as Venerable on 6 July 2007 after confirming his heroic virtue. The single miracle for beatification was investigated on a diocesan level from 7 April to 31 June 2009 and received C.C.S. validation on 7 May 2010 before medical experts voiced their approval to it on 13 October 2011; theologians followed on 18 February 2012 as did the C.C.S. on 15 May 2012. Benedict XVI approved this miracle on 28 June 2012 and confirmed that Passi would now be beatified. Cardinal Angelo Amato beatified Passi on 13 April 2013 on the behalf of Pope Francis in Venice.

It is found in China (Tianjin). The wingspan is 6‚àí8 mm. The forewings are greyish fuscous to blackish fuscous, the costal margin with a white spot basally at about 1/10 and one before apex, the former sometimes touching the fold posteriorly. There is some stria at the distal 3/10 and 1/6 obliquely outward, reaching the middle of the wing and near the termen respectively. There is transverse white fascia from the costal 1/3 and 1/2 obliquely outward, reaching the dorsal 1/2 and before the end of the fold respectively, edged with blackish fuscous to black scales. The hindwings are uniformly grey. The larvae feed on Grewia biloba and its variety parviflora. They mine the leaves of their host plant. They mine on the upper surface. The mine begins as an epidermal silvery curved white line which soon enlarges to a whitish blotch. Yellowish-fuscous or fuscous lines can be found on the surface of the blotch. As the larva develops, the blotch usually incorporates the earlier linear mine. The last instar larva vacates the mine for pupation by chewing a semicircular opening near the margin of the blotch. Cocoons are usually made in the leaf wrinkles. The larvae are pale green to yellowish-green and reach a length of 4 mm. The species overwinters in the pupal stage.

His beatification received approval in mid-2014 from Pope Francis after the pontiff approved a miracle that had been found to have been attributed to his intercession. Cardinal Angelo Amato beatified Cestac in mid-2015 on the pope's behalf. Life Younger Cestac. His sister and Servant of God Marie-Louise- √âlise Cestac. Louis-√âdouard Cestac was born in 1801 in France to Dominique Cestac and Jeanne Amitessarobe at number 45 on the Rue Mayou; his siblings were Marianne and the Marie-Louise-√âlise (14.03.1811-17.03.1849). His mother Jeanne was Basque-Spanish. Marianne (b. circa 1795) was the eldest while √âlise was the last meaning Cestac was the middle sibling; he was √âlise's godfather at her baptism. In his childhood he suffered an incurable neuralgia and complete mutism for a duration of three years. His mother decided to consecrate him to the Mother of God and Cestac's condition improved to the point where he was healed. His healing was credited to the intercession of the Blessed Virgin. The Cestac's later moved to Puntous due to the Peninsular War. Cestac underwent his ecclesial studies from 1816 at Aire-sur-l'Adour and Paris where he befriended Michel Garico√Øts. He received the minor orders on 25 December 1821 and in 1822 was back to his studies and formation after recovering from a serious illness. He was ordained to the diaconate on 26 June 1825 before being ordained to the priesthood on 17 December 1825. He served as a professor in Larressore from 1826 until 1831. Father Cestac was later appointed as the vicar of the diocesan cathedral on 27 August 1831 and gave his full attention to the poor and met with them on a frequent basis in order to better serve them and to know them better. In 1836 he established a home for poor girls. He and his sister Marie-Louise √âlise together co-founded - on 6 January 1842 - their own religious congregation known as the Serviteurs de Marie. Two other women joined at the time of the order's founding while √âlise became Sister Marie Magdalene. There was once an occasion when Empress Eug√©nie de Montijo came to Cestac asking him to pray for her to have a son but the priest assured her that she would indeed bear a son - the empress did indeed have a son. On 13 January 1864 a profound experience struck when a beam of light hit Cestac and caused him to see devils scattered across the globe causing grave damage. He was horrified but was relieved to see the Mother of God before him and who told him that those devils had been let loose. Yet she added that the time had come for the world to request her intercession to fight and end the grave powers of Hell. From her the priest received the prayer known as the \\"August Queen\\". He presented this to Bishop Fran√ßois Lacroix and also had 500, 000 copies printed to be sent. At the time of the first printing the printing press broke down twice. His dedication to social and agricultural reform won him praise and it even earned him the Legion of Honor from Napoleon III in 1865 for his contributions to schooling and agriculture. He died on 27 March 1868. Beatification His tomb. The process for beatification opened in France in a local informative process tasked with the collection of documents and such a process spanned for several months from February 1898 until 1899; theologians cleared his writings of doctrinal errors on 1 May 1902 in a move that would allow the cause to proceed. The formal introduction to the cause came under Pope Pius X on 8 April 1908 and he was titled as a Servant of God. An apostolic process was later held from 21 September 1909 until 28 February 1916 for further investigation. The cause then moved onwards to Rome where the Congregation for Rites validated these processes on 5 June 1919 deeming them to have done their work according to the required criteria. An antepreparatory committee met to evaluate the cause on 28 March 1944 granting it their approval while the preparatory group had to meet twice on 13 February 1945 and 28 April 1953 in order to approve it. The officials of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints and their consultants also met and approved the cause on 13 April 1976 while the C.C.S. met alone to grant definitive approval on 22 June 1976. Pope Paul VI declared Cestac to have lived a life of heroic virtue and named him to be Venerable on 13 November 1976. Cestac's beatification all depended on one healing deemed a miracle as a result of his intercession. One such case was investigated in a diocesan tribunal and was sent to the C.C.S. in Rome who validated the investigation on 28 January 2011. Medical experts deemed that there was no scientific explanation for the healing on 3 October 2013 while theologians ruled on 18 February 2014 that the healing came due to requests made for Cestac's intercession. The C.C.S. concurred with both findings on 3 June 2014. Pope Francis authorized the promulgation of a decree that recognized the healing as a legitimate miracle on 13 June 2014 which enabled the beatification to take place. Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the beatification on 31 May 2015 on the pope's behalf.

The band consists of former Coma Cinema frontman Mathew Lee Cothran and various collaborators. They have released eight records and several EPs. Their music has been described as \\"evoking [...] childhood nights fraught with existential dread\\" and has been likened to the earlier music of Ariel Pink and Elliott Smith. History = Formation, Early EPs, and Run for Cover = Elvis Depressedly was formed in 2011 in Columbia, South Carolina, originally as a way for Cothran to explore his Bowie-esque alter ego of \\"Mickey\\", referenced in the early EPs as a way for him to confront and examine his fears and anxieties. The band debuted with the self-release of the five-track EP Save the Planet Kill Yourself. It was followed by the EP Goner, and the single \\"Disgraceland\\" in the same year. In 2012 Cothran played his first show under the name Elvis Depressedly, playing the entirety of the album Mickey's Dead, which was released later that year on Orchid Tapes. The album was named one of the best free albums of 2012 by The Social. Hotter Sadness was released in October 2012. The EP Holo Pleasures, released via Birdtapes in 2013, was a breakthrough of sorts, giving the band more exposure than any previous release, despite getting no press coverage. In November 2014, the band signed to Run For Cover Records. After the recording was completed, Cothran moved to Asheville. = New Alhambra and Holo Pleasures/California Dreamin' = In 2015, the band released a new album titled New Alhambra, which was proclaimed by Pitchfork to be \\"a utopian sort of indie-pop record\\", giving it a 7.3. They went on a short tour following the release of the album. The album charted: it peaked at #7, at #6 as a Heatseeker Album, #23 as an Alternative Album, and #33 as a Rock Album. Rolling Stone put \\"N.M.S.S.\\", the second track on the album, at #23 on a list of the best songs of 2015. In 2016, Run for Cover announced Holo Pleasures/California Dreamin', a compilation of the earlier Holo Pleasures EP with the unreleased California Dreamin' EP.

The band is fronted by Jon McClure, nicknamed \\"The Reverend\\". Their debut album, The State of Things (2007), helped them gain success in Britain and spawned the UK top 10 single \\"Heavyweight Champion of the World\\". The band released their second album, A French Kiss in the Chaos (2009), which led to them being invited to support Oasis on their final tour, playing venues such as Wembley Stadium. The band's third studio album, @Reverend_Makers, was released in 2012, and their fourth studio album, ThirtyTwo, was released in 2014. History =Early years= In late 2005, McClure brought several musicians together for Reverend and the Makers. Like his previous bands, the Makers included co-songwriter Ed Cosens, this time playing bass. The rest of The Makers consisted of Dave Sanderson (guitars), Joe Moskow (keyboards), Richy Westley (drums, formerly of Hoggboy) and Laura Manuel (vocals), and occasionally Simon Stafford on trombone. Sanderson was dismissed in July 2006 after the band completed their first headline UK tour and replaced by Gledhill guitarist Tom Jarvis. Late in 2005, fellow Sheffield band Arctic Monkeys released their debut single, and McClure was hounded by major record labels, reportedly offering him sums of up to ¬£150,000 to make an album like Arctic Monkeys. McClure declined the offer, and decided to do everything his own way, managing to sell out The Plug in Sheffield twice, a venue with a capacity of 1,000 people, while still unsigned. It was not until the following year that McClure met Mark Jones in a club in London when he asked him for a lighter. The two got talking and Mark Jones came to see Reverend and the Makers at the next show. Jones reportedly proclaimed the band as the \\"best band in the world\\" and signed them to his label Wall of Sound Records. Reverend and The Makers released a 9-track demo in 2006, entitled \\"Ten Songs\\". The artwork included a track list with ten songs, track 10 being \\"Paris at Night\\". However this song was not made available for download; it only surfaced on the internet in August 2007. The demos were recorded at 2Fly Studios, and produced by Alan Smyth, McClure acknowledges the work Smyth put into the demos by accrediting the debut single; \\"Heavyweight Champion of The World\\" as McClure/Cosens/Smyth. Reverend and the Makers' music is a mix of indie guitar pop, electronica and a touch of Madchester-esque funk. Some of the internet demos feature members of other notable Sheffield musicians such as Alex Turner (Arctic Monkeys), Tim Hampton (Bromheads Jacket) and Mike Hughes (Little Ze). One of Reverend's inspirations is Manchester performance poet John Cooper Clarke and Reverend often performs his own poems, of a similar style, in between songs during his live sets. One of the B-sides to the debut single \\"Heavyweight Champion of the World\\" is a poem entitled \\"Last Resort\\" in which John Cooper Clarke and McClure read alternate stanzas. This poem was also duetted live when the band played live at Shoreditch's Spread Eagle in the first tour in May 2006. In April 2006, Reverend and The Makers were support to the Arctic Monkeys on their sold out UK tour, exposing the band to larger audiences and bigger venues. This was followed by their own first UK tour in May and June, selling out dates in Shoreditch, London and The Plug in home- town Sheffield on the final night. A second tour followed in October 2006, showing great progression as a band. The sound was much tighter and far more advanced than on their previous tour. =The State of Things and breakthrough (2007‚Äì08)= Performing at Summer Sundae in 2008 In 2008, Reverend and The Makers set a date for their first release and undertook a UK tour, including several festivals over the summer period including Glastonbury Festival, Carling Weekend, T in the Park and T4 on the Beach as well as supporting the Red Hot Chili Peppers at Hampden Park, Glasgow. In January 2008, Reverend and The Makers toured Australia.*Clode, Samantha, \\"Tell it like it is: Reverend and the Makers\\" , Triple J, 24 September 2007. Their first release was \\"Heavyweight Champion of the World\\" on 28 May 2007 and featured the B-Sides \\"18‚Äì30\\" and \\"The Last Resort\\" featuring John Cooper Clarke. The single takes its name from a line in A Kestrel for a Knave a novel by Barry Hines and a favourite book of McClure. The single is available on both CD and 7\\" vinyl formats, including a limited edition \\"White Vinyl\\" release. The single was released for download on 6 May and reached #38 in the UK single chart on download only. The album, entitled The State of Things, was recorded over the Christmas period and was released on Wall of Sound on 17 September 2007. The album features songs co-written and performed with Alex Turner of Arctic Monkeys and one track co-written and with guest vocals from Tim Hampton of Bromheads Jacket, other tracks include vocals by Steve Edwards. In June 2008, drummer Richy Westley left the group to form his own band Strange and Partners. In August 2008 frontman Jon McClure said he would quit music after their next album, although a month later he changed his mind. The inconsistency of McClure's actions has led many critics in the music press to report negatively towards the move. Welsh band Future of the Left joked of their delight at the band's split at live shows on their tour at the time, as can be heard on their live album Last Night I Saved Her from Vampires.Last Night I Saved Her From Vampires, 4AD, 2009 McClure has a new project, Mongrel, with a single \\"Hit from the Morning Sun\\" due to be released in February 2009.Playlist, The Sunday Times, 18 January 2009 =A French Kiss in the Chaos (2009‚Äì2010)= Early 2009, it was announced that Tom Jarvis has left the band, and has been replaced by Tom Rowley (ex-Milburn), Rowley was already a good friend of McClure, and contributed to the first album by co-writing the tracks \\"Bandits\\" and \\"Miss Brown\\".

The album was released in June and the opening single, \\"Silence Is Talking\\" was featured during the band's three night run at Wembley Stadium. The band released a second single, \\"No Soap (in a Dirty War)\\" in October. McClure was in the media spotlight for his personal views in July 2009, after an interview in which he commented on Jade Goody's death earlier in the year; \\"it's sad she died and it's good more girls are getting smear tests but let's not forget she was a talentless racist\\". He has also been in the media recently speaking out about the UK's involvement in the Iraq War, requesting that fellow musicians, particularly the Arctic Monkeys, his contemporaries from Sheffield, focus on real issues and to \\"not write songs about girls at bus stops any more like me and Monkeys used to do, let's start talking about what's happening man as otherwise you know where we gonna go, we're going down the toilet aren't we?\\". In December, it was announced via McClure's Twitter that Andy Nicholson, his fellow member in Mongrel and ex-Arctic Monkeys bassist would join the band for their third album. NME published the story on its website soon after. =Hiatus and @Reverend_Makers (2010‚Äì2012)= McClure announced via his Twitter in July 2011 that \\"the recording of the Reverend and The Makers 3rd album is underway\\". In August 2011, the band posted a new track called \\"Riot\\" on their YouTube page, in response to the 2011 England Riots. It was announced in January 2012 that the band had completed work for the third album, scheduled for a release later that year. The band also revealed that they will be supporting Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds on their UK Arena tour in spring. Details on the album are sketchy, but McClure has stated it will be produced by Jason Cox and James Dring (Gorillaz) and Youth (The Verve, U2) and will move away from the political-minded nature of the band's second album. The band also announced they had signed to Cooking Vinyl Records. McClure also stated that ex-Milburn and current The Book Club frontman Joe Carnall was to join the band, as well as ex-thisGirl drummer Ryan Jenkinson. In February 2012, the band played their first gig for two years in Coventry. Just days after, they released their lead single off their third album \\"Bassline\\" via their Facebook page. The band also announced their third album would be entitled @Reverend Makers due to \\"nothing representing the modern times more than the '@' symbol\\", according to McClure. The album is set for an 18 June release, according to Amazon. The band appeared on Soccer AM in May 2012 and stated the next released single would be \\"The Wrestler\\" (which was released on 14 May 2012). The album was released on 18 June 2012 and reached number 16 on the UK Albums Chart. In December 2012 the band released a live CD & DVD titled \\"Reverend and The Makers Live In Sheffield\\", recorded at O2 Academy Sheffield in October 2012. =ThirtyTwo (2013‚Äì2014)= The band announced in October 2013 that their fourth record would be released in February 2014 and produced by Youth, James Welsh and the band.

The name of the Order refers to the Sacred Tunic that Jesus Christ wore at his death. According to legend, the relic was raffled off by Roman soldiers and it was then taken to Georgia, preserved, and buried in the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral, alongside the insignias of former Kings of Georgia. In 1942, Prince Irakli Bagration of Mukhrani was elected President of the Union of Traditionalist Georgians, who were dedicated to restoring a free Georgia under a constitutional monarchy.

History The viaduct was completed in 1856 and spanned the Borovnica Valley along the route from Vienna to Trieste vie Ljubljana. During its construction and for some decades afterward it was the largest stone bridge in Europe. It was long and high. The structure was planned by Carl Ritter von Ghega and construction began in 1850, lasting until August 1856, when the first train crossed it. It was a two-story structure; the first story consisted of 22 arches, and the second story had 25 arches. It was supported by 24 columns built of dressed stone that stood on wooden pilings driven into the loamy marsh soil. The arches were built of brick. The construction required one million cubic feet of broken stone, five million bricks, and one million cubic feet of stone blocks. The remains of the railroad viaduct The viaduct was in poor condition before the Second World War. Water had seeped into the viaduct for decades, weakening the bricks, and the oak pilings that supported it were beginning to rot, with the result that the entire structure was gradually settling. Trains crossing it had to slow down to . At the beginning of the Second World War in Yugoslavia, the withdrawing Yugoslav Army blew up part of the bridge; Italian forces replaced the missing part of the viaduct with an iron structure. After the Italians withdrew, German forces built a bypass route past the viaduct because of the danger posed by increasingly frequent aerial attacks. After the last major Allied aerial attack in 1944, the partially destroyed viaduct was not repaired. The railroad was rerouted to the edge of the Borovnica Valley in 1947, which is where it also runs today. The remaining part of the viaduct was gradually dismantled by 1950. Today only a single column of the viaduct remains, standing in the middle of Borovnica.

It is found in shallow water in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Description Anthopleura ballii has a broad base up to across and a trumpet-shaped column up to high. The surface of the column bears forty-eight longitudinal rows of small warts, each tipped with red. The oral disc is wide and there are up to 96 tapering tentacles arranged in five whorls. These are retractable to a limited extent and are flecked with white. The colouring of this species is variable, being some shade of red or yellow, with the tentacles sometimes having an iridescent green sheen. The warts are non-adhesive. This is in contrast to the closely related glaucous pimplet (Anthopleura thallia), which has gravel or debris adhering to the column. Distribution and habitat Anthopleura ballii is native to northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the coasts of Western Europe. It is found on rocky coasts from the intertidal zone down to depths of about . It usually occurs in crevices, in the holes made by piddocks as they burrow, under boulders and in other concealed locations. It is sometimes attached to pebbles and shells and may be semi-immersed in sand or mud. Biology Anthopleura ballii contains unicellular dinoflagellates living inside the tissues. These are species of Symbiodinium and are commonly known as zooxanthellae. They are photosynthetic organisms and provide the sea anemone with nutrients and energy, the products of photosynthesis. This type of arrangement is common in corals and sea anemones in nutrient-deficient tropical seas but is rare in temperate waters, which tend to be nutrient-rich. Researchers have found that the ova become infected with maternal zooxanthellae just before spawning takes place. The zooxanthellae are restricted to one side of the ovum and during the rearrangement of tissues that takes place during the development of the embryo into a planula larva, the zooxanthellae are confined to the endoderm of the larva and to the gastrodermal cells of the adult. This method of acquiring zooxanthellae is unusual. In tropical seas zooxanthellae are frequently liberated into the sea by symbiotic invertebrates and occur in the faeces of predators feeding on symbiotic cnidarians. This means that there is little need for maternal transfer of symbionts. This is not the case in temperate seas where free-living zooxanthellae are scarce. A. ballii is gonochoric, with individuals being either male or female. It is a broadcast spawner.

Weissman started her artistic career as a classical painter utilizing Impressionistic techniques. She has evolved since the 1960s into a style of Realism. For the past eleven years, she has been exploring tattoo sub-cultures for the purpose of documenting the phenomenon she refers to as ‚ÄúLiving Canvases.\\"  Early life and education  Weissman grew up in St. Louis, Missouri after World War II. Her education was directed toward the achievement of a BFA Degree from the Kansas City Art Institute and an MFA degree from the University of Cincinnati. She was selected from her undergraduate class to receive a scholarship to the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture and the University of Cincinnati graduate program.  Living canvases  After creating paintings of doll parts and working in body wrapping, a technique that involves creating molds of the subjects and mummifying them, Weissman began focusing on tattoos. She documented tattoo culture in her paintings, ‚ÄúThe Tattoo Series,‚Äù which is a collection of highly detailed depictions of people with intricate tattoos. As the collection progressed, her work has transformed from tight, closely cropped torsos, to full bodies and models posed with ornamental kimonos or juxtaposed with earthly elements. Weissman chooses models that have a theme on their body, she is interested in body art that is not purely aesthetic, tattoos that have a goal or a meaning. It is important to Weissman that the tattoo is not just a piece here or there, she likes tattoos that have something to say. It‚Äôs not usually difficult for Weissman to find models; mostly her subjects consist of mostly people she meets at body art conventions and in similar environments. While usually reluctant at first, after viewing some of previous works, subjects are convinced they will not be commercialized and agree to model for her. In addition, some subjects have contacted her about having her paint their tattoos. She starts her painting process by taking photos of her models and their tattoos alongside her photographer Jack Anderson. After a photo session, Weissman projects the photo onto her canvas and begins drawing the figure and all its details. She color codes each change in color, making the canvas look a little like the world's most complex color-by-numbers diagram. Then, section by section, she paints and glazes her work. Start to finish, one of her paintings takes about six months to complete.  Style  Weissman‚Äôs style can be described as detail-oriented. It is important to her to fully include the intricate aesthetics of each pattern and to represent the jewel- like quality of the color, noticing subtle differences in hue and brightness. She considers herself a colorist; like Vermeer and Chardin, whose art exemplifies chiaroscuro, the light and dark enveloping the figures, and the fleshy, beautiful skin tones of Rubens. Besides the tattoos, the human form is likewise important. Since the tattoos are lying on the body, the three- dimensional form of the figure is very important in Weissman‚Äôs work. Additionally, she gives particular attention to how the light envelopes her figures.  Exhibitions and collections  Ms. Weissman has mounted solo exhibitions with Estelle Malka, Los Angeles, CA; Galerie Furstenberg, Paris, France; and Riverdale Art Museum, Riverside, CA among others. Her work is held in the permanent collections of the Arnot Art Museum, Elmira, NY; Museum of the American West, Los Angeles, CA; Hallmark Crown Center, Kansas City, MO; as well as Habimah Theatre Tel Aviv, Israel. Critical attention to her work has been received by PBS, American Art Collector, ArtNews, Art in America, ArtWeek, and Los Angeles Magazine.

Background After a full decade in a commercial abyss, by 1970 Jerry Lee Lewis was one of the hottest country stars in the business after hit singles like \\"What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made a Loser Out of Me)\\" and \\"She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left of Me)\\" had rocketed up the charts. With his albums selling again, he appeared in front of 25,000 fans at the Toronto Peace Festival in 1969 and later that year performed on his own television special called The Many Sounds of Jerry Lee Lewis. In early 1970, he appeared on The Johnny Cash Show and, with his profile higher than it had been since his Sun Records days, was invited to play the International Hotel in Las Vegas. Befitting his new role as a honky- tonk balladeer, Lewis kept it mostly country, performing his recent hits and other songs made famous by Bob Wills, Hank Williams, and Tom T. Hall. The album would be another hit for Lewis, rising to number 5 on the Billboard country albums chart. Lewis played Vegas at the same time as Elvis Presley, who was enjoying his own comeback around this time. According to Rick Bragg's authorized biography Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story, in 1969 Presley tracked Jerry Lee down at a hotel in Columbus, Ohio and invited him to see his show at the International, an invitation Lewis accepted. According to Lewis guitarist Kenny Lovelace, when Presley introduced Lewis during the show, the audience gave him a standing ovation. The next year, Lewis would be playing the International with his own band while Elvis played in the main room. \\"I was playin' in the lounge,\\" he recounts to Bragg. \\"I mean, the lounge was as big...It was as large as this whole house. Just the lounge. I mean, the main room would seat, like, three thousand people. And the room I was in would seat, like, twenty-five hundred.

She returned to Leeds and was given further tests. When told the diagnosis, she knew that DSRCT that had metastasized had \\"an utterly dismal prognosis\\". She was treated with P6 protocol chemotherapy and endured painful treatments which she described in detail in her blog \\"The Other Side and the Bright Side\\". She described how the news that her condition was incurable was broken to her: After her diagnosis, Granger continued her medical training and qualified as a consultant geriatrician. During the latter stages of her illness, she was treated at St Gemma's Hospice, Leeds. She died on 23 July 2016, aged 34. Campaigns = #hellomynameis = Granger started the #hellomynameis campaign in 2013, chiefly using Twitter, where by the time of her death, she had over 47,000 followers. The campaign name was the Twitter hashtag #hellomynameis. It was intended to encourage healthcare staff to introduce themselves to patients. On 31 August 2015, the second anniversary of the campaign, she recalled: , the campaign has been endorsed by more than 400,000 doctors, nurses, therapists, receptionists and porters across over 90 organisations, including NHS Trusts across England, NHS Scotland, NHS Wales and the NHS in Northern Ireland. She has spoken passionately at many health conferences and her campaign is supported by the former Prime Minister David Cameron, Nicola Sturgeon, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, many celebrities, and a significant number of leaders in health organisations in the UK and overseas. = Fundraising = Granger donated proceeds from the sales of her two books, and sponsored events such as a tandem skydiving jump, to cancer research. In total she raised over ¬£250,000 for the Yorkshire Cancer Centre. Awards and honours In February 2014, NHS England created the Kate Granger Awards for Compassionate Care. These annual awards are in honour of Granger to \\"recognise an individual, team or organisation that has made a positive difference to patient care\\". In June 2014, Granger was elected as a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, the first doctor in training that the college had elected as a fellow, in recognition of her contribution to healthcare. Granger was made a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to the NHS and improving care. Her award was presented to her at Buckingham Palace by the Prince of Wales, in June 2015. Also in 2015, she was made an honorary Doctor of Science by London South Bank University.

Research interests Abernethy contributed to understanding of mechanisms of peripheral distribution for drugs and drug disposition and effect in obesity, the knowledge base in pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic relationships for cardiovascular drugs in aging. He improved the concept of aging with his research that the pathophysiology of aging must be considered interpreting the drug effects on aged patient. His last research was on the role of genetic polymorphisms of drug effectors with effective responses to cardiovascular drugs. Moreover, to better quantify the effects of multiple medications on functional performance in older adults, he was developing a Drug Burden Index.

Archive history It is known that the European powers occupied Crete at the beginning of 1897, declaring its autonomy from the Ottoman Empire. In consideration of the ambiguous situation that had come about on the big Mediterranean island and the rapid deterioration of its historical monuments (threatened by theft and reckless demolitions), in 1898 the Italian Ministry of Education decided to send an archaeological mission to Crete, directed by Federico Halbherr. A member and future president of the Royal Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, Carlo Francesco Ferraris, suggested to the members that they finance the sending of a delegate to Crete who could support the Italian mission with the specific task of exploring and illustrating the monuments that can still be found there of Venetian rule, which extended from 1204 to 1669. In 1899 Giuseppe Gerola , on the recommendation of Halbherr (also originally from Rovereto), was appointed by the Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti to carry out a study campaign in Crete aimed at recording the monumental and artistic signs of Venetian rule there. The idea was to reproducing the numerous monuments of Venetian rule on the island partly with plaster casts and partly with photographs . Gerola arrived in Crete on 18 January 1900. During two and a half years in Crete, (1900 - 1902), Gerola collected a vast quantity of material, then published over almost 30 years (between 1905 and 1932) in four monumental volumes, which in 1933 won him the Mussolini Prize, awarded by the Royal Academy of Italy. Documentation produced Gerola wrote five reports for the Istituto, made more than 50 plaster casts (most of which are in storage at the Museo Storico Navale), took 1500 photographs, whose negatives are held at the Istituto Veneto, and made a large number of sketches, drawings and notes.

'Maluma') is a commercial cultivar of avocado that was discovered in South Africa. It is marketed simply as 'Maluma', but sometimes also as 'Maluma Hass' referring to its similarity in appearance to the well-known Hass cultivar. Its name originated from the fact that it was discovered by Mr. Dries Joubert, a farmer from Levubu in South Africa, on his farm 'Maluma'. Maluma is considered a large fruit with individual fruit weights ranging from 150 gram to 400 gram, with most fruit being in the 250 to 300 gram range. It is known as a black-skinned avocado cultivar due to the dark purple-black colour of the skin when ripe. History Maluma was discovered by Mr. A.G. (Dries) Joubert on his farm 'Maluma' in the Levubu region in northern South Africa in the early 1990s. Maluma was noted by Mr. Joubert due to its proportionally larger fruit, precociousness and high yield compared to the regular 'Hass' trees in his commercially cultivated orchard. Mr. Joubert approached Allesbeste Nursery in South Africa, an avocado nursery specialising in reproducing avocado trees asexually using a proprietary method called micro-cloning, in the latter part of the 1990s to investigate the uniqueness and commercial viability of the observed avocado fruit. Allesbeste Nursery then proceeded with semi-commercial field trials and found the fruit to be sufficiently unique and commercially viable as a new avocado cultivar. Until this point the fruit were referred to informally as 'Dries Hass' (from Mr. Joubert's first name) and sold simply as 'Hass'. Allesbeste Nursery proceeded to formally name the cultivar Maluma after the farm where it was discovered and also applied and was granted a plant breeders' right in South Africa on 7 November 2004. It was granted full export status under its own name by South African authorities in 2006, after which it was revealed to the international avocado world at the VI World Avocado Congress held in Vi√±a del Mar, Chile in 2007. Maluma has subsequently been planted in most avocado producing regions of the world and has been granted registered plant protection in most of those countries, while pending in others. Botanical characteristics Maluma was discovered as a chance seedling and because it did not originate from a breeding program, the parentage of the cultivar is unknown. However, it appears to be related to Guatemalan varieties with some Mexican gene characteristics. Maluma trees produce A-type flowers. The tree is a slow, upright grower while being precocious. It has an axial-irregular branching habit. The fruit are of a pyriform shape with weights ranging from 150 gram to 400 gram, peaking at 250 to 300 gram with an asymmetrical pedicel. The fruit are green when unripe and turn dark purple-black when ripe. The fruit skin is rough and pebbly. Suitability for high density cultivation High density Maluma orchard in South Africa, planted 2,5m x 2,5m Due to the fact that Maluma trees tend to grow slower and therefore more compact, when compared to 'Hass' trees, together with its ease of pruning and relatively high yield potential makes it well suited for high density cultivation practices.

As such it stood in stark contrast to earlier construction projects that were carried out during the 2000s, even though there had been both public criticism and civic campaigns directed against these projects as well,‚ÄùZolyan Mikayel, \\"Armenia‚Äôs Facebook Generation:Social Networks and Civic Activism in Armenia\\", Newsletter of the Institute of Slavic, East European,and Eurasian Studies of the University of California,Berkeley, Fall 2010, Volume 27, Number 2, page 7; http://iseees.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/u4/ISEEESNL_Fall_2010_Web.pdf historian Mikayel Zolyan states in his paper ‚ÄúArmenia‚Äôs Facebook Generation: Social networks and civic activism in Armenia‚Äù published by the University of California, Berkeley.

With the support of European Association for Local Democracy (ALDA), urbanlab initiated Engage Vanadzor, a project aimed to promote re-evaluation of Armenia‚Äôs third largest city, Vanadzor‚Äôs modern tangible and intangible heritage- rock music and to advocate its preservation through community engagement.ENGAGE VANADZOR. The heritage of modernity and cradle of creative industry; http://choiceproject.eu/engaging-vanadzor/ urbanlab also implemented some self-initiated experimental projects, the results and data of which (notably, the Folding Points of Yerevan) have been in circulation among the interested parties. With this project urbanlab attempts to address urban planning issues in Yerevan through an alternative perspective. =Action and community involvement= The team carries out urban, environmental and cultural projects, which are mostly socially and culturally oriented and tend to be in accordance with general principals of their socially active role. Notable urban projects carried out by the team are: *Gyumri-Kars Common Urban Heritage Protection *Conservation of Sevan Writers ResortSevan Writers‚Äôs Resort gets a fresh start from Getty Foundation http://www.mediamax.am/en/news/society/21116/ *Other Yerevan * Project Management and implementation supervision of Lovers' Park in Yerevan *Alternative Avenue *Revitalization of Kond *Rehabilitation of Shoushi's Adamyan Street Common Notepad is the outcome of the Gyumri-Kars Urban Common Heritage project implemented jointly by the Urban Foundation for Sustainable Development and urbanlab. It aimed to promote a dialogue between Armenian and Turkish young urban planners and architects to join efforts in addressing the problem of protecting mainly the 19th-century urban heritage of Kars and Gyumri. These two cities shaped their urban structure and style during the Russian Empire period and had many similarities - built form the same tuff stone, in the same neo-classical style, etc.\\"Armenia-Turkey Normalisation Process  ’É’°’¥÷É’∏÷Ä’§’°’Ø’°’∂ ’∂’∏’©’°’ø’•’ø÷Ä. ‘≥’µ’∏÷Ç’¥÷Ä’´-‘ø’°÷Ä’Ω ÷Ñ’°’≤’°÷Ñ’°’µ’´’∂ ’™’°’º’°’∂’£’∏÷Ç’©’µ’∏÷Ç’∂’®\\"; http://www.armenia-turkey.net/en/Common-Notepad The Conservation of Sevan Writers ResortKeeping It Modern: 2016 Grants Awarded; http://www.getty.edu/foundation/initiatives/current/keeping_it_modern/grants_awarded_2016.html project is funded by the Getty Foundation‚Äôs ‚ÄúKeeping it Modern‚Äù grant to Writers Union of Armenia.

It consists of mapping and promoting the culturally significant urban sites based on crowd-sourcing information processing. It will help preserve sites and structures that are still standing and commemorate those that have been lost to rapid urban re- structuring. The Revitalization of Kond project initiated by urbanlab aims to re-evaluate the historical importance of the district and its role in the fabric of the city with a set of recommendations on how to revitalize the district without damaging the historic environment. =Advocacy and education= Since establishment, sharing of experience, non-formal education and advocacy for democratization of urban planning process has been one of the major directives of the organization. A series of lectures titled ‚ÄúMeet Architecture‚Äù, organized by urbanlab for four consecutive seasons (2012-2013) at the Union of Architects of Armenia, were a success. The series hosted professionals of the field from Armenia and other countries, such as France, Germany, Austria, Romania, Iran and UK, and were attended by many students and interested individuals. The organization also teamed up with official license holders of the local Pecha-Kucha Nights and organized two presentations on themes concerning urban planning and architectural issues. urbanlab has also been a partner of different educational programs, such as Bio Diversity and Built Environment Summer Course held at the American University of Armenia and City Hundretwasser workshop held at Cafesjian Centre for the Arts. Started from 2011 urbanlab team has been organizing urban walks with a special focus on unconventional heritage sites of Yerevan, i.e. Kond, Lalayants Street, etc. In the framework of the same initiative, Yerevan participated in Jane's Walk movements and Faro Walks during European Heritage Days. = Publications = * Utopia and Collapse, Rethinking Metsamor ‚Äì the Armenian Atomic City, Katharina Roters and Sarhat Petrosyan, Park Books, Z√ºrich, Switzerland, 2018 Utopia and Collapse, Rethinking Metsamor ‚Äì the Armenian Atomic City;https://www.lehmanns.de/shop/technik/41295526-9783038600947-utopia-and- collapse * Independent Landscape, Mediapolis and urbanlab, Yerevan, 2016 * Analysis and Development of the Urban Planning Documentation System, self- published, 2013 Full Armenian text * Study, Analysis and Development Program for Legislative Basis of the Protection of Historical and Cultural Monuments, self-published, 2012http://www.urbanlab.am/files/wareshelf/1/14978627389203.pdf = Exhibitions = *Independent Landscape, Pavilion of the Republic of Armenia at the 15th International Architecture Exhibition - La Biennale di Venezia, Venice, Italy, 2016 * Prague Architecture Week 2013, Prague, Czech Republic *Scraps from the whole - the whole in scraps, urban planning exhibition, ACCEA, Yerevan, Armenia, 2013 * The Alternative Avenue, Yerevan Architecture Biennale, Museum Institute of Architecture, Yerevan, Armenia  References   External links  * urbanlab official website * urbanlab blog Category:Architecture of Armenia Category:Armenian activists Category:Architects from Yerevan Category:2006 establishments in Armenia ","title":"Urbanlab Yerevan"},{"id":"45281862","text":"Koivukyl√§ (; English meaning: birch village) is a district and major region of the municipality of Vantaa, Finland.

Biography =Haiti= G√©rard √âtienne wrote his first poems when only 13 and performed them on radio, but he left his paternal home at 15. Declaring that his father had been violent towards his mother because she did not share his Vodun religion, √âtienne said that he had been terribly affected by his childhood. In Port-au-Prince he took part in an uprising against the despotic regime of the U.S.-backed Paul Magloire. Arrested with Luc B. Innocent and Windsor Kl√©ber Laferri√®re, he was imprisoned and tortured. Prison and torture had marked him deeply, but after Magloire was deposed in 1956, √âtienne found the strength to pursue classical studies. As he was later to comment in an interview with Ghila Sroka, \\"The more we deny the people the right to exist, the more they express their disappointment in the arts, literature, music.\\"Ghila Sroka, ¬´G√©rard √âtienne: le juif n√®gre¬ª (\\"The Negro Jew\\"), autumn 2001 interview, La Tribune Juive 19.4 (March 2003). Accessed 2 February 2015. In 1958 he began a career as a journalist, teacher and writer. A follower of Haitian Marxist novelist and physician Jacques Stephen Alexis (himself murdered by the Tonton Macoute in 1961), he took part in a 1959 plot against the army-supported regime of Fran√ßois (\\"Papa Doc\\") Duvalier, for which he was arrested and tortured a second time. Upon his release, √âtienne published in rapid succession four books of poetry and two literary essays. He founded the \\"Samba\\" cultural group (later to become Ha√Øti- litt√©raire). While teaching at colleges and a high school, he was simultaneously literary critic and reporter with the daily Le Nouvelliste (1961-1962) and Panorama (1962-1964). √âtienne has followed parallel military and artistic trajectories, especially at Syto Cav√©'s Soci√©t√© des Messagers de l'art (1963) and the Haitian Air Corps, where as an air cadet he was assigned to the meteorology department (1955‚Äì1957). With the publication of his first book of poetry Au milieu des larmes (\\"Amidst the tears\\") in 1960, he found himself a cultural and literary leader within his country. Following a long detention in Duvalier's prisons, he fled to Quebec as a refugee in August 1964. Quebec and New Brunswick On his arrival in Montreal, he taught at the Lyc√©e Da Silva (1964-1965) and worked as a reporter for the M√©tro Express and Quartier Latin newspapers. While studying literature at the Universit√© de Montr√©al (1964‚Äì1970), he worked first in a factory and then as a hospital orderly at the H√¥tel-Dieu de Montr√©al. He taught at the C√©gep de Matane (1968-1970) and wrote for the newspaper La Voix Gaspe ‚Äî a newspaper that ceased publication in 2012.Jean Gagnon, La Voix Gasp√©sienne: la fin d'une √©poque (\\"End of an era\\"), 17 June 2012, La Voix de la Matanie. Accessed 1 February 2015. In 1965 he published \\"Letters to Montreal,\\" his first Canadian book. Since then, he continued to publish poems and stories; his work is in several French and Haitian anthologies and has been translated into English, Portuguese and German. In his early years in Canada he had converted to Orthodox Judaism. In 1967 he married Natania Feuerwerker, whom he had met at the Universit√© de Montr√©al. She was a daughter of the French jurist and Haganah fighter Antoinette Gluck (1912-2003) and the rabbi and historian David Feuerwerker (1912‚Äì1980).Natania √âtienne, \\"R√©ponse √† un antisemite ha√Øtien\\" (\\"Reply to a Haitian anti-Semite\\"), 16 April 2011, Tendance Antipodes, accessed 1 February 2015. √âtienne and his wife had two children, Jo√´l and Micha√´lla. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Universit√© de Montr√©al (1968) and a PhD in linguistics from the University of Strasbourg (1974). In 1967-68 he was editor of Lettres et √âcritures, a journal published by the Universit√© de Montr√©al's arts faculty in 1967-68; later in 1968 he founded the Th√©√¢tre de Matane.Stanley P√©an, Disparition de G√©rard √âtienne (1936-2008) 16 December 2008. Accessed 1 February 2015. From 1971 till his retirement in 2001 he was a journalism professor at the Universit√© de Moncton. From 1972 to 1987 he wrote a column for the Montreal newspaper \\"Le Devoir\\". From 1974 to 1980 he also edited a review published by the Universit√© de Moncton. Later he wrote for the now defunct daily Le Matin and the weeklies Le Voilier and Le Moniteur acadien in Shediac, New Brunswick (1986-1987). Confrontation Despite having suffered two comas and having undergone brain surgery, he continued to write to the weekly Le Voilier (1987‚Äì1989). In 1993, just before he was to appear for a Radio-Canada interview on Denise Bombardier's Raison Passion television show, G√©rard √âtienne was the victim of a bloody gang assault, a politically motivated attack that increased his determination to resist what he characterized as Haitian feudalism. He later wrote of the event in his 1998 book L'Injustice, la d√©sinformation, le m√©pris de la loi (\\"Injustice, misinformation, disregard of the law\\"). Subsequently, to that assault, √âtienne, through his columns in the Ha√Øti-Observateur newspaper, continued his struggle for sustainable democratic change in his Haitian homeland. In this capacity, he published in 2008, through √âditions du Marais, an uncompromising play, Monsieur Le Pr√©sident. The Racine actors group staged five performances of the play at the Th√©√¢tre Stanislas d'Outremont in April 2008. Aside from his poetry and journalism, √âtienne has also followed an academic career in the field of linguistics. He founded a new discipline in the humanities known as anthroposemiotics. His two essays on this subject, La Question raciale et raciste dans le roman qu√©b√©cois (1995) and La Femme noire dans le discours litt√©raire ha√Øtien (1998), received critical acclaim in both Quebec and the broader francophone world. Awards and honours G√©rard √âtienne in 1991 received the Medal of the Guadeloupe writers union, Association des √©crivains de la Guadeloupe. In 1996, the International Council for Francophone Studies (Conseil international d'√©tudes francophones) conferred upon him the prestigious Maurice-Cagnon Certificate of Honour, for his exceptional contribution to world French-language studies.Liste des r√©cipiendaires depuis 1991, Prix du Conseil International d'√âtudes Francophones.

Stowe acquired Griffin Coal in 1979 and later acquired SkyWest and East-West Airlines during the 1980s. In 1984, Stowe joined the John Curtin Foundation along with Alan Bond, Ernest Henry Lee- Steere and Laurie Connell to raise funds for the then premier of Western Australia, Brian Burke. The reclusive millionaire moved to Monaco in 1986, mooring his yacht Capella at the tax haven. Since then he has split his time between his new home and Western Australia. Stowe separated from his partner, Jemma Lee-Steere (Ernest Lee-Steere's daughter), in 1990. The subsequent court battle was subjected to media scrutiny. The couple had three daughters and a son Jason and had been together for ten years. Though they never married, she changed her surname to Stowe by deed poll at his insistence. In 1994 she sued Stowe for 250 million and, by 2000, a settlement was reached. In 2003, Stowe married Anne-Margaret MacDermott of Perth, his fourth wife. In 2010 administrators were called in when Griffin Coal failed to pay a 25-million instalment on 475 million worth of bonds. Griffin had also failed to pay the Australian Taxation Office a 5-million instalment of a 65-million debt. The company collapsed shortly afterward, leaving an estimated 2 billion debt on coal and associated energy assets. Soon after, properties from another Stowe company, WR Carpenter Agriculture Pty Ltd, which controlled a herd of 50,000 cattle, were being sold off; these included Minilya and Joanna Plains Stations. A fire sale of Stowe assets followed, with his estate, Devereaux Farm, near Bullsbrook selling in 2013. The propertywith a 20-room, 8-bathroom mansion, two swimming pools, two helipads and a polo fieldfor which the asking price was 70 million, sold for 21.35 million in 2013.

Early career The address side of a balloon post card from the 1870 siege of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War. The former Mus√©e des Lettres et Manuscrits. Lh√©ritier served in the French army after which he was an asset manager. In the early 1980s he discovered by chance in a stamp shop in Paris a letter marked \\"par ballon mont√©\\" while seeking a rare stamp for his son. This caused him to research balloon mail and write several books on the subject, including a novel, Les Ballons de la libert√© (1995). He is (or was) a sponsor of the National Library of France. Aristophil In 1990, Lh√©ritier founded the company Aristophil in Nice, to buy historical manuscripts, letters and other documents, and then to sell shares in those items to investors. In 2002, Lh√©ritier purchased 54 pages of correspondence between Albert Einstein and the Swiss mathematician Michele Besso for $559,500 at Christie‚Äôs New York.French police widen net in manuscripts investigation. Vincent Noce, The Art Newspaper, 17 March 2015. Retrieved 22 April 2016. He divided these into 400 shares, which he sold to investors. His company, Aristophil, retained the right to buy back the shares at a higher price but did not commit itself to doing so. He was the buyer, in about 2004, of the manuscript of the Marquis de Sade‚Äôs 120 Days of Sodom. In 2004, Lh√©ritier established the Mus√©e des Lettres et Manuscrits at 8 Rue de Nesle in Paris, and it moved to 222 Boulevard Saint- Germain in 2010.

He is under formal investigation for a suspected pyramid scheme fraud. According to his lawyer, Francis Triboulet, nobody can claim with certainty to have lost money, because the manuscripts had not yet been sold, and their actual value is thus still unknown. The dealer Frederic Castaing, however, emphasises that true collectors \\"aren't that interested in the pecuniary value of a document. They love the touch of it, the sense of communing with a personage who is normally shut up in an encyclopedia\\" and argues that Lh√©ritier, \\"turn[ed] part of our cultural heritage into stocks and shares.

In 1851, his name was immortalized on the north facing commemorative plaque on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great in Berlin. Friedrich Wilhelm Quirin von Forcade de Biaix is erroneously referred to in some 19th century historical sources in Prussia as the Marquis de Biaix.Priesdorff, Band 1, Page 354, Nr. 371 (in German) As with his father, there is no evidence that he was ever a Marquis. Biaix was not a marquisate, but instead a noble manor (see also Manorialism). He was also never the Seigneur de Biaix. The title Seigneur was not hereditary. In the case of his family, his grandfather, who purchased the Biaix Manor in 1659, was the Seigneur de Biaix.Chaix d'Est-Ange, Tome 18, Page 315 (in French) Following his death in 1684, his father's eldest brother inherited the property and the right to enter the Estates of B√©arn and became the next Seigneur de Biaix. He, in turn, passed it to his eldest son.  Early life  Friedrich Wilhelm Quirin von Forcade de Biaix was the second son of Lieutenant General Jean de Forcade de Biaix (1663‚Äì1729) and his wife, the Baroness Juliane von Honstedt, daughter of the Major General Baron Quirin von Honstedt,Zedlitz-Neukirch, Band 2, Page 436 (in German)Zedlitz-Neukirch, Band 5, Page 245 (in German) from W√ºrttemberg but in the service of Prussia. His baptismal Godfather was none less than Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg and King in Prussia in 1698, who became Frederick I of Prussia the first King of Prussia aka \\"the Mercenary King\\" in 1701. His father was a Huguenot religious exileK√∂nig, Band 1, Page 429 (in German) who was among the earliest arrivals in Brandenburg-Prussia,Chaix d'Est-Ange, Tome 18, Page 316 (in French) after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes by the Edict of Fontainebleau in October 1685. Unlike his father and his eldest brother, choosing to not abjure from his Calvinist beliefs, he left his native B√©arn in France for Brandenburg-Prussia, where Frederick I of Prussia, then Elector of Brandenburg, was not only encouraging, but actively facilitating, Huguenot immigration. Little else is known about his early life.  Military career  Portrait of a Regimental Commander, probably Johann Quirin von Forcade; by Antoine Pesne, date unknown, before 1757. The lives and careers of both Friedrich Wilhelm Quirin von Forcade de Biaix and his father are intricately linked to the history of the 23rd Prussian Infantry Regiment, founded in 1713 and disbanded in 1806. Forcade spent the majority of his career on the infantry side of this regiment. The regiment also included a company of Grenadiers, the 2nd Grenadier Company. It was garrisoned in Berlin from 1716 until 1806. He later commanded the entire regiment, including the Grenadiers, for 17 years, (14 July 1748 - 23 March 1765). His father commanded the regiment during 13 years (February 1716 - 2 February 1729). During much of its existence, as well as more than 200 years after, it was referred to as Forcade's Regiment. The Regiment is immortalized in the German military marching composition \\"Das Regiment Forcade\\" that was in use as late as World War II. Forcade entered Prussian military service in 1713 during the reign of King Frederick William I of Prussia (1713‚Äì40), beginning what would become one of the most notable military careers in the history of the Kingdom of Prussia, spanning some 53 years, and further serving under King Frederick the Great (1740‚Äì65). * 21 September 1713, appointed as a F√§hnrich, an entry-level commissioned officer with the Grenadiers of the Wei√üe F√ºsilier-Leibgarde Nr. 1, in the 1st Prussian Infantry Regiment, aka General Field Marshall Count von Wartensleben's Infantry Regiment (in 1788, called von Bornstedt's Regiment). =Great Northern War (1715)= Following Brandenburg-Prussia's declaration of war against Sweden in the summer of 1715, Forcade fought in the Pomeranian Campaigns. He fought at the Siege of Stralsund (15 June 1715 - 23 December 1715), where he was wounded for the first time, the storming of the Peenemuende Lair (21‚Äì22 August 1715) and on R√ºgen Island (16‚Äì18 November 1715). * 11 January 1716, promoted to Second Lieutenant. * Promoted on 26 May 1719 to First Lieutenant. * 24 January 1721, promoted to Captain in his father's Regiment, the 23rd Prussian Infantry Regiment. At the time, still commonly referred to as the Regiment von Sydow. * In 1732, promoted to Major in the same regiment. * Promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in 1740. =First Silesian War (1740‚Äì42)= He fought near Glogau (29 December 1740 - 2 January 1741), Breslau (29 December 1740 - 2 January 1741), Ottmachau Palace (12 January 1741), Troppau (23 January 1740), Graetz (25 January 1741), the Battle of Mollwitz (10 April 1741), at Neisse (19 October 1741 - 31 October 1741), Laa (12 March 1742), Bruenn (31 March 1742 - 3 April 1742), Austerlitz (10 April 1742) and Wartha (25‚Äì26 May 1742). * 30 May 1743, promoted to Colonel. * In June 1743, he was appointed Amtshauptmann von Zinna (the civil official heading the Zinna district government). =Second Silesian War (1744‚Äì45)= Forcade and the 23rd Prussian Infantry Regiment fought at Prague (2‚Äì18 September 1744), Pless aka Josephstadt (27 November 1744), Patschkau (27 December 1744) the Battle of Hohenfriedberg (4 June 1745), Gross- and Klein Bocken (31 July 1745), around Neustadt in B√∂hmen (11‚Äì12 September 1745), at the Battle of Soor (30 September 1745) and at Trautenbach and Schatzlar (16 October 1745). The regiment lost its Regimentschef, Major General Wolf Alexander Ernst Christoph von Blanckensee, at the Battle of Soor. Forcade himself, was shot through the calf of his right foot. Badly wounded, he was left for dead on the battlefield. King Frederick the Great attributed the glory of the victory to him for his actions on the battlefield that day, and, on 6 January 1746, awarded him the Kingdom of Prussia's highest order of merit, the Pour le M√©rite, as well as a pension of 600 Thaler and the title of Canon (Domherr) of Havelberg. Another episode in 1746 demonstrates just how much King Frederick the Great treasured Forcade. During a ritual presentation at court at the Berlin Palace, Forcade had to lean on a window because of his wounded right foot. The King personally brought him a chair, graciously saying: \\"My dear Colonel von Forcade, so brave and worthy a man, as He is, well deserves that even the King himself brings him a chair.\\"Komander, Page 310 (in German)Naumann, Band 1, Page 522 (in German) * In 1747, on occasion of the baptism of his son, Friedrich Heinrich Ferdinand Leopold, the King Frederick the Great was the Godfather. As a gift, the King ordered von Forcade to accept the title of Drost zu Neuenrade (the Official responsible for the militarily administrative district of Neuenrade) in the County of Mark with the royal command that it be later transferred to the child. * May 1747, promoted to Major General, with rank retroactive to 4 December 1743. * Appointed on 14 July 1748 as Regimentschef of his father's old regiment, the 23rd Prussian Infantry Regiment, at the time also referred to as Donha's Regiment, after his predecessor, Count Christoph zu Dohna. =Seven Years' War (1754‚Äì63)= Forcade commanded his regiment in early engagements near Pirna (11 September 1756 - 16 October 1756). * 10 February 1757, promoted to Lieutenant General. Forcade and the 23rd Prussian Infantry Regiment were particularly active during the Seven Years' War. 1757 He commanded his regiment, fighting alongside of his men, at * the Battle of Reichenberg near Kratzau (21 April 1757); Infantry * the Battle of Prague (6 May 1757 - 20 June 1757); Infantry and Grenadiers * Aussig (27/29 July 1757); Infantry and Grenadiers * Kotta (24 August 1757); Grenadiers * Markranst√§dt (29 October 1757); Infantry and Grenadiers * the Battle of Rossbach (5 November 1757); Infantry and Grenadiers * the Battle of LeuthenLange, Page 92 (in German) (5 December 1757); Infantry and Grenadiers * Klein-Mochbern and Maria-H√∂fchen, near Breslau (6 December 1757); Grenadiers * the Siege of Breslau (7‚Äì20 December 1757); Infantry * Nikolaivorstadt at G√∂rlitz (12 December 1757); Infantry * Landeshut (22 December 1757); Grenadiers Forcade's infantry lost 600 men during each of the battles at Prague and Leuthen. * On 7 December 1757, after commanding the Battle of Leuthen in which distinguished himself beyond description, he was awarded the Knight of the Order of the Black Eagle. When the King took possession of Leuthen, he personally wrote of von Forcade: English translation: \\"My dear Lieutenant General von Forkade. I know that he has endured much at this siege, and it is our fortune because of him, that we were soon able to become masters of the city, because he otherwise, without my being able to help or relieve him, would have had to endure even more. So I thank him for it, and because he endured the most here : so shall he also alone have the honor from it. So, I herewith award him not only the Order of the Black Eagle, but also appointed him as Lieutenant governor of Breslau. I have awarded the vacant {command of} the Bremen Grenadier Company in Golz' Regiment to his eldest son, who is my Adjutant, because he well deserves it\\". 1758 * Holitz in Bohemia (11‚Äì12 July 1758); Infantry * the Battle of Zorndorf (25 August 1758); Infantry and Grenadiers * the Battle of Jenkwitz (11 October 1758); Infantry * the Battle of Hochkirch (14 October 1758); Infantry and Grenadiers Forcade was wounded again at the Zorndorf. The Prussians lost 12,800 men, the Russians lost 18,000 men at Zorndorf. Forcade lost 1,600 of his men that day, 800 each from his infantry and Grenadiers, as well as the Grenadier's commanding officer, Major Ernst Sigismund von Wedell. He again lost 1,600 of his men again at Hochkirch, 800 each from his infantry and Grenadiers, where the Prussians were defeated on the battlefield. 1759 * the Battle of Friedland in Bohemia (9 September 1759); Infantry During this successful battle, Forcade's infantry took 700 prisoners and destroyed an important munitions depot. 1760 * in April 1760, he marched the regiment to Pomerania and forced the Russian General Tottleben to retreat from the province to the Polish border. * the Siege of Dresden (13‚Äì22 July 1760); Infantry and Grenadiers * Adelsdorf (9 August 1760); Grenadier * the Battle of Liegnitz (15 August 1760); Infantry and Grenadiers * Hochgiersdorf (17 September 1760); Grenadier * Sch√∂na (2 November 1760); Grenadier * the Battle of Torgau (3 November 1760); Infantry and Grenadiers At the Battle of Torgau, Forcade lost 15 officers and more than 600 men. 1761 * Schwadronschef (Rittmeister) of the 2nd Grenadier CompanyGieraths, Band 8, Page 111 (in German) under Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia. * an entrenched camp near Bunzelwitz (20 August 1761 - 25 September 1761); Infantry 1762 * 1762, commanded a special corps under Prince Henry of Prussia in Saxony. * the Battle of Grethen (9 March 1762); Grenadiers Although Forcade's Grenadiers won the Battle of Grethen against 4,000 Austrians, they lost their commanding officer, Major Joachim Friedrich von Rathenow, who died from his wounds a week after the battle. * D√∂beln (12 May 1762); Grenadiers * Marches between Frauenstein and Tharandt Forest: Klingenberg, Beerwalde Mill, Rothenbach Mill, Lehn-Mill (15 May 1762); Grenadiers * the Siege of Schweidnitz (4 August 1762 - 10 October 1762); Infantry * Brand (15 October 1762); Grenadiers * the Battle of Freiberg (29 October 1762) =The Treaty of Hubertusburg= In 1763, following the Treaty of Hubertusburg, he received a gift of 8,000 Thaler from King Frederick the Great. A cabinet order of the King on 19 May 1763 created a War Tribunal, presided over by Lieutenant General von Forcade, together with Lieutenant Generals von Wedell, von Czetteritz and von Wylich.Winter, Page 155 (in German) =Final Years= The proverb \\"Brave wie Forcade\\" (Brave like Forcade) became a standard expression of valor in the Prussian Army during the 18th century. \\"Das Regiment Forcade (hat nie ein Feind besiegt)\\" (lyrics by Georg von Kries, melody by Hans Hertel, 1906) was long a standard, at times mandatory, composition in the German military song repertoire. =His Legacy= Following Friedrich Wilhelm Quirin von Forcade de Biaix's death in 1765, his widow received a handwritten letter,K√∂nig, Band 1, Page 431 (in German) in French, from King Frederick the Great, that reads: English translation: \\"I take advantage of the first {free} moment of my convalescence to let you know the part I take in the loss you experienced, and what I want to do to relieve your justifiable pain. I give you a first pension of five hundred crowns for the long and faithful {years of} service that your husband rendered me; a second identical sum, in consideration of your happy fertility; and a third, also of five hundred crowns, to help you raise your children. I can only recommend that you make sure that they follow in the footsteps of their father.\\"Paganel, Volume 1, Page 425 (in French) Madame von Forcade undoubtedly highly appreciated this well-deserved gesture. She made sure that their children respected the King's wishes; all four sons were said to have been commissioned officers; six of the seven daughters were said to have married military men, and the seventh married a pastor and was the head of a religious order. Friedrich Wilhelm Quirin von Forcade de Biaix was interred following a state funeral where he was given a vault for himself and his family in the crypts under the Old Garrison Church in Berlin, which was destroyed during the allied bombing of Berlin on 23 November 1943. Following the destruction of the church, the tombs not destroyed during the bombings, where among others 15 Prussian Field Marshals and about 50 Prussian Generals were buried between 1722 and 1830, were broken into and plundered by grave robbers on several occasions. At the recommendation of the Soviet military authorities, the 199 human remains still present were gathered from the vault and were placed into 47 coffins, and transferred into a community grave at the :de:S√ºdwestkirchhof Stahnsdorf near the chapel. His remains, and those of his wife, were among those transferred. A 19th century theatrical play centered around Frederick the Great, affectionately referred to as (Old Fritz), and Friedrich Wilhelm Quirin von Forcade de Biaix {citation needed}. In 1851, General von Forcade was immortalized on the north facing commemorative plaque on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great in Berlin.

He was the Regimentschef of the 23rd Prussian Infantry Regiment, Commandant of the Royal Residence in Berlin, Gouverneur militaire of Berlin and Knight of the Order of the Black Eagle. He married the Baroness Juliane von Honstedt, from the noble house of Erdeborn, on 15 April 1697. She was the daughter of Major General Quirin, Erbherr (Allod) von Honstedt (aka Hohnstedt, aka Honst√§dt), Herr of Sulzau, Weikenburg and Erdeborn, and his wife Maria Magdalena Streiff von L√∂wenstein, of Falkenau, Diedenhosten and Bacour. =Marriage= Friedrich Wilhelm Quirin von Forcade de Biaix originally intended to marry a daughter of French Baron Fran√ßois Mathieu Vernezobre de Laurieux (1690‚Äì1748).Bourrachot, p. 59 (in French)> The rich baron and his family had left Paris after the collapse of John Law's Mississippi Company in 1720 and befriended King Frederick William I of Prussia. When the King ordered Vernezobre to marry his daughter to von Forcade de Biaix, who she rejected, the marriage was only averted when Vernezobre agreed to undertake the construction of a prestigious city residence for the King, referred to as the Vernezobre'sche Palais, located at Husarenstra√üe 102, later renamed in his honor to Wilhelmstrasse 102, after the King's death in 1740. He subsequently married on 7 October 1727Berlin- Friedrichstadt, Marriages Vol. 1707-1747, p. 247 (in French manuscript) at the French Cathedral in Berlin with 18 year old Baroness Marie de Montolieu de St.-Hippolyte aka Maria von Montaulieu, Freiin von St.-Hippolyte (* 23 August 1709, Berlin; ‚Ä† 15 September 1767,Heinsius, Issue 73, Page 825, Nr.

From their marriage and until their respective deaths, the couple maintained a fixed residence and home in Berlin. =Children= A look at the baptisms of the couple's children provides a both interesting and noteworthy documentary of just how close the ties were between the Forcades, the royal family, members of the royal household and other key figures in Frederick the Great's most intimate inner circle. Over a period of 25 years, the couple had 23 children, including four said to be stillborn. Eleven survived their father, of which four were sons.

Titles and Offices  Historical terms, in particular those related to offices, titles and awards, are often outdated in their usage to the point that modern dictionaries no longer contain them. To understand their meaning in the present day context it is necessary to look into dictionaries from the period. Historical terms in German used in the production of this article, and their English definitions, include: =Regimentschef= The appointment to Regimentschef, a Regimental Commander in the Prussian Army, was usually for life. For this reason, most regiments were known and referred to by the name of their Chef, the commander, for example Forcade's Regiment instead of the 23rd Prussian Infantry Regiment. Note: In a similar tradition, a Schwadronschef aka Rittmeister was a Squadron Commander (of horse-mounted troops), usually for life, or until retirement or discharge for disability. The terms Schwadronschef and Rittmeister are synonymous and are often used interchangeably in the 18th century. =Amtmannschaft von Zinna= the Office of Lord Seneschal of Zinna * Amtmannschaft (die): synonym with \\"Drostei\\"; the Seneschal's Lordship, Dignity, Power or Jurisdiction, the Bailiwick See: Ebers, Johann, The New And Complete Dictionary Of The German And English Languages: composed chiefly after the German Dictionaries of Mr. Adelung and of Mr. Schwan / 1: ...

Especially for her fictional work, she has achieved a special place in modern Portuguese literature. Biography Irene Lisboa was born in Quinta da Murzinheira in the municipality of Arruda dos Vinhos, Portugal. She came from very wealthy background and grew up at the family estate where she was born. She attended the Escola Normal Primeira de Lisboa, and graduated high school from the convent boarding school of Convento do Sacramento. After schooling in Lisbon, she studied pedagogy in Belgium, France and Switzerland. In Geneva, Switzerland, she studied at the educational institute where her lecturers included the well-known educator √âdouard Clapar√®de. She then worked as a teacher and a school inspector before becoming an official of the Instituto para a Alta Cultura (Institute of High Culture). Lisboa used several pen names: Manuel Soares for her educational works and Jo√£o Falc√≥ for her early literary works and much of her poetry as women writers were not generally accepted at the time. However, although the fact that a male pseudonym appears on some of her work, the tone of the work reveals that the narrator is a woman, something that is \\"never disguised or expressly omitted.\\" From 1926 to 1958, in addition to several academic works on pedagogy, she published poems, short stories, novels, books for children, and literary essays. She also contributed to a number of Portuguese periodicals. Her literature was well received in both Portugal and Brazil. The poet and literary critic Jorge de Sena considered she was one of the \\"greatest Portuguese writers on account of the incomparable originality of her style and personality\\". On November 25, 1958, exactly one month before her 66th birthday, she died in Lisbon.

After at least one preliminary sketch,Study for Football Players (Dessin pour Les Joueurs de football) published in Montjoie! Salon des Ind√©pendants, no. 4, March 29, 1913 Gleizes began working on this painting in 1912 and finished it before exhibiting the work at the Salon des Ind√©pendants, March 1913.Soci√©t√© des artistes ind√©pendants: catalogue de la 29√®me exposition, 1913, no. 1293 Moving away from his quasi-monochromatic works of 1910 and 1911, Gleizes employs a wide array of primary colors, grays, earth tones and umbers. Unlike the preferred subject matter of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque (e.g., still lives or guitar players), Gleizes has depicted a vast scene, combining a sporting event with a semi-urban or industrial landscape in the background. As the principle subject matter of this work Gleizes chose to represent a group of six or seven rugby football players. The action and contact between the players is palpable. Two of the men are holding on to the player with the ball (blue jersey) as if a tackle is imminent. In contrast to the impending violence of the sport, Gleizes has painted flowers along with some cubic shapes toward the bottom right of the picture. On the bottom left is a man, possibly a fallen player, holding what appears to be a round shaped item in his hand. Spectators are seen toward the upper right, while to the left, in the background, Gleizes has painted a town, a bridge and bellowing clouds or smoke. The rich juxtaposition of divers elements present within the piece are tied together in a Cubist idiom by an interlocking grid of diagonal lines, facets, intersecting plains and spheres. Overview Painted during an ongoing debate over the virtues of Cubism and Futurism, Les Joueurs de football is a prime example of the artists desire to reconcile the problem of representing the subject from different points of view simultaneously, and/or in successive stages of motion (both the physical displacement of an object and the movement of thought).Peter Brooke, Albert Gleizes ‚Äì For and Against the Twentieth Century, New Haven and London, Yale University Press, 2001, pp. 29‚Äì31, , Here, according to art historian Peter Brooke, Gleizes explores the movement of subjects in motion \\"with the sense of movement that can be excited in the spectator using purely pictorial means\\". Brooke continues, \\"The drama can be seen very clearly expressed in Gleizes's painting Les Joueurs de football, in which a very powerful pictorial construction is undermined by the idea of aggressive movement, very rare for Gleizes, conveyed in the frozen gestures of the subject, the football players\\". Guillaume Apollinaire writes in Montjoie! on 18 March 1913: > With his Joueurs de football, Albert Gleizes taken an enormous step. This is > his most varied and most colored canvas. I still see in the upper section > some unpleasant and heavy smoke, but the composition is new, divers. Gleizes > embarked upon a challenging composition that he masterfully arranged. The > subject has returned to the painting and I‚Äôm not in the least proud to have > predicted the return of what constitutes very foundation of pictorial art. > This √âlan vital constitutes the subject of Gleizes' canvas. L‚ÄôOiseau bleu, > the large poetic composition by Metzinger is the most important work painted > by this much discussed artist. It is difficult to express in a few lines and > without prior meditation all the invention, all the marvel [f√©√©rie] of this > well painted work. We can no longer say, now, that Cubism is obscure > [triste], gala rather, grand [noblesse], measure [mesure] and audacity. Les Joueurs de football is testament to the close association of two artists, Metzinger and Gleizes, and to their shared social, cultural and philosophical conviction that painting represented more than a fleeting glimpse of the world in which they lived, that indeed by showing multiple facets of a subject captured at successive intervals in time simultaneously, a truer more complete image would emerge.Joann Moser, Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger in retrospect, 1985, The University of Iowa Museum of Art (J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press) > We feared the dogmas and hermetic ideas, destructive acts disguised as new > constructions, before they appeared as we knew they would. Rejecting > nothing, we sketched out a traditional curve in French painting from Courbet > to ourselves as the latest arrivals, persuaded that the new order cannot be > created independently of the permanent order. (Albert Gleizes, 1917)Albert > Gleizes: La Peinture Moderne, in 391, No. 5, New York, June 1917Two > Philosopher-Painters, Albert Gleizes and Kasimir Malevich Gleizes' Football Players exemplifies the principle of mobile perspective and simultaneity elaborated upon in the Cubist manifesto Du \\"Cubisme\\", written with Jean Metzinger. Football Players exemplifies, too, the general freedom of the artist to interpret the subject matter without producing photograph resemblance or ‚Äòrealistic‚Äô portrayal of an object or event. For Metzinger and Gleizes, such a portrayal was simply an arbitrary convention. In the world of experience, things are not static, but in constant motion. Objects are rarely seen from one point of view, and the act of perception is systematically accompanied by a collection of emotions and thoughts. Life is not a 'purely retinal' experience. Rugby football Henri Rousseau, 1908, The Football Players, oil on canvas, 100.5 √ó 80.3 cm, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum The apparition of The Football Players (1908) in the work of Henri Rousseau signaled the emergence of sporting events as a subject for art.Gordon Hughes, Resisting Abstraction: Robert Delaunay and Vision in the Face of Modernism, University of Chicago Press, Nov 25, 2014 Jean Metzinger painted At the Cycle- Race Track (Au V√©lodrome) (1911‚Äì12) Peggy Guggenheim Collection; Umberto Boccioni, Dynamism of a Cyclist (1913), Peggy Guggenheim Collection and Dynamism of a Soccer Player (1913) Museum of Modern Art. Robert Delaunay worked on a series of rugby football scenes from 1912 to 1913, and again in 1924.Kubisme en sport Andr√© Lhote, later, painted the subject several times, between 1917 and 1937.Andr√© Lhote, Rugby, 1917, Agence Photographique de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux et du Grand Palais des Champs-Elys√©es (RMN) In both the Gleizes painting and those of Delaunay, the identification with soccer has commonly been made, however, the ball is oval and the hands are being used; clearly identifying the subject of these works as depictions of rugby football games.Guggenheim Museum Collection Paintings, 1880‚Äì1945, Published June 1976 by Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation The first rugby competition was held in 1892 as a one-off championship game between two Paris- based teams, the Racing Club de France and Stade Fran√ßais. In 1900 rugby was played at the Paris Summer Olympics. France won the gold medal of the first ever rugby event at the Olympics. Racing Club made it to the championship final on 31 March 1912. France joined an international competition in 1910, and coined the term Tournoi des Cinq Nations (Five Nations Championship); a term that would last almost the entire century.Rugbysme: le rugby et l'art moderne, Mus√©e Fabre de Montpellier Agglom√©ration, 8 September ‚Äì 28 October 2007 On 1 January 1913, at the France-Scotland match, spectators threw themselves on the referee to express their dissatisfaction. The mounted police were forced to intervene charging. This violent incident led to the secretary of the Scottish Rugby Union to declare: \\"If the game can only be played under the protection of the police or the military, it is not worth playing\\".Jean- Pierre Bodis, Histoire mondiale du rugby, Biblioth√®que historique Privat, 1987, Following this incidents, Scotland refused to face France at the 1914 tournament.The tournament, rugby-nomades.qc.ca France was implicitly excluded from further tournaments, but World War I did not permit the application of this exclusion. The related sport-themed work of Rousseau, Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Boccioni (and later Lhote), reflected the enthusiasm for sport that fascinated the French spirit at the time. Romain Rolland described the Belle √âpoque generation as \\"Passionately in love with pleasure and violent games\\", in his 1912/13 novel Jean-Christophe. Art historian Daniel Robbins writes: > The role of team sport, especially in the context of mass audience > participation, reflects another interest of the artists of Passy.

Recording Lewis's second album of 1972 not only had a different sound from its predecessor, The Killer Rocks On, but also from the country albums like Another Place, Another Time and She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left Of Me) that had ushered in his comeback; unlike those records, which possess a stripped down, \\"hardcore\\" sound, Who's Gonna Play This Old Piano...Think About It, Darlin' is far more in tune with the smoother, countrypolitan sound that began dominating country radio in the early seventies. \\"She's Reaching for My Mind\\", \\"Too Many Rivers\\", and \\"No Traffic Out of Abilene\\" all contain strings and an array of background vocalists as producer Jerry Kennedy attempted to give the tracks as contemporary a feel as possible. Although the album did reach number three on the Billboard country albums chart, it signified the beginning of the end as far as Lewis's incredible run on the singles chart was concerned, with the Dixieland-infused title track stalling at number 14. Although he would continue to have the odd hit country single, they would come at a more infrequent rate, as songwriters began providing Lewis with material so tailor- made that they began verging on self-parody. In his 2014 authorized biography, Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story, Rick Bragg comments that eager tune-smiths \\"obliged with a slew of new material that fit perfectly with his voice and leather-worn persona. Some of them actually were created for him - like 'Think About It, Darlin',' written to capitalize on one of his catchphrases.\\" Lewis was likely inspired to record \\"Walls Around Heaven\\" because of his mother's death the previous year. The song, in which the singer condemns his own sinful ways, also reflects Lewis's ongoing struggle to come to terms with his faith and his lifestyle which, by all accounts, got more and more out of control as the decade wore on.

Rusca was arrested under false pretenses and was killed through the use of torture in 1618. He was recognized by the Roman Catholic Church as a martyr and was beatified in 2013. Biography Rusca was born in 1563 to a family that belong to an ancient and noble house, the House of Rusconi. He was born to Giovanni Antonio and Daria. His siblings were Bartolomeo, Christopher and Daisy. He commenced his theological studies in Milan from 1580 to 1587. Ordained to the priesthood in 1587 at the end of his time of study, he was appointed as the Archpriest of Sondrio. This was an appointment he was kept in until his death. He also tried to promote the teachings and decisions of the Council of Trent and also tried to cope with the rise of Protestantism in Europe. Rusca viewed Protestantism as something that would be dangerous to the church teachings. Rusca was briefly arrested in 1608 and acquitted of breaching rules in relation to respect of religious tolerance. In 1618, he was taken by force by several soldiers and was accused of being part of violence against ministers of the Protestant faith and was subsequently arrested. Rusca was found guilty of this and subjected to torture for several days. Through torture, he died shortly after his arrest. Beatification Rusca's cause of beatification started on 1 February 1934 under Pope Pius XI but was granted \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against) on 27 March 1995 under Pope John Paul II. This meant that he became a Servant of God. Pope Benedict XVI declared that Rusca died in hatred of the faith and proclaimed him to be a martyr on 19 December 2011, thus paving the way for his beatification. On behalf of Pope Francis, Rusca was beatified on 21 April 2013 by Cardinal Angelo Amato.

The content spans mainly across the secondary school public exams syllabus in the UK and USA such as GCSE A Level and the SAT. As of January 2015 the app has been installed over 500,000 times. Gojimo was founded by serial entrepreneur George Burgess. The app currently offers over 50,000 free multiple-choice, curriculum-based quiz questions and over 10,000 premium questions. History George Burgess came up with the idea for exam preparation apps while studying for his A Level exams. Media accounts have made light of his being caught emailing a freelance app developer by his Geography teacher, who resultantly became his first business adviser. Having established EducationApps Ltd. the EducationApps range grew to over a hundred subject-specific apps. The apps quickly took off and Burgess produced nine BBC Bitesize apps (in a deal with BBC Active, a joint venture between BBC Worldwide and Pearson Education). He continued to run the company while studying at Stanford University in America. In 2014 venture capital firm Index Ventures and JamJar Investments, a fund set up by the founders of Innocent smoothies, announced they invested over $1 million in Burgess‚Äô company, which was rebranded as Gojimo and grouped into a single platform solution and launched at the 2014 BETT show. Over the course of 2014 the Gojimo team began to develop in-house content, the teacher portal and launched on Android and the web in 2015. The team now has 14 members of staff. Gojimo was also a finalist of the Best App Category of BETT 2015. In March 2017, Gojimo was acquired by Telegraph Media Group. Functionality The in-app store is used to locate quizzes and study guides: users browse by subject or qualification. Study guides can be searched or navigated by topic. Within each set of questions. users can take a random quiz or choose a specific topic on which to focus. Quizzes consist of multiple choice questions with four possible answers. After answering each question the user is given in-depth explanations of the answer and links to further reading. They can also track their improvement over time in the progress review section. Content The app currently offers content for various subjects for UK exams: 11+ Common Entrance, 13+ Common Entrance, GCSE and A-Level; US Exams: SAT, ACT and AP; and international undergraduate and IGCSE qualifications. The subjects offered vary between qualifications but include Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Geography, History, Maths, Law, Politics, Religious Studies, English, Latin, Spanish, German, Psychology and Design Technology. In addition to content which is generated by in-house writers and fact-checked by teachers, external publishers such as McGraw-Hill Education and Oxford University Press have created premium content for the app. There are currently 60,000 questions available across the different qualifications. Aims Gojimo aims to be the world's leading exam preparation application and to take a significant role in the transformation of education away from textbooks and towards digital sources.

He is the trustee and Secretary of Samskrit Promotion Foundation. He is also the co-founder of Samskrita Bharati. Now he is spearheading a movement to teach Sanskrit Through Sanskrit On 25 January 2017, Government of India announced \\"Padma Shri\\" award in the category Literature and education. for his contribution towards the promotion of Sanskrit.  Early life  Shastry was born on 23 January 1956 in Kedila village near Mangalore (Bantwal taluk). He learnt Sanskrit from the Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha at Tirupati. As a teenaged Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh worker Shastry was imprisoned during the Emergency. Alone in his cell, he took to reading biographies. In the writings of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and Swami Vivekananda he learnt how Sanskrit could unlock scientific, mathematical and medical knowledge buried in ancient Sanskrit texts. Career =Speak Samskrit movement = Krishna Shastry, along with some of his friends, went on to start the ‚ÄòSpeak Samskrit‚Äô Movement in 1981 from Bangalore. His method of teaching Sanskrit is to let the student learn it in the same language rather than through another language by translation. Learning Sanskrit can be a forbidding exercise because it is being taught through translation. To make it easier for the students, Shastry's method is not to learn the language through grammar, but to teach Sanskrit as it is spoken. Students thus do not have to wrestle with the nuances of an arcane syntactics. It's then easier to master the language, so much so that even semi-literate people can opt for the course. = Samskrita Bharati = The movement eventually evolved into the not-for-profit organisation Samskrita Bharati, a voluntary body committed to the cause of Sanskrit. Shastry's efforts led to the development of the very popular \\"Ten-day Sanskrit Speaking Course\\" of Samskrita Bharati. He has inspired a dedicated work force for Sanskrit across the country which is leading the propagation work at various states. Samskrita Bharati and Shastry have been implementing the 10 day course through a network of 250 full-time workers and 5,000 Sanskrit Bharati volunteers. It also helps that the course is offered for free. Samskrita Bharati has enabled nearly one crore people to learn and converse in Sanskrit the language, one lakh of whom have decided to use Sanskrit at home in true ancient style. Shastry's efforts have also led many universities and colleges to adopt the communicative teaching method for Sanskrit. In the US, SAFL (Samskrit as a Foreign Language) is a popular course among the children of Indian origin. Samskrita Bharati is active all over India and in 13 countries including USA, Canada, UK and the UAE. The organisation is also credited with the revival of Sanskrit in Gujarat A few unique experiments like \\"Samskrit Homes\\" and \\"Samskrit mother tongue Children\\" are popular. \\"Saraswati Seva\\" is a project through which hundreds of books from other Indian and foreign Languages are translated into Sanskrit. To promote young authors and modern books in Sanskrit he has organised events such as \\"Samskrit Book Fair\\", and \\"Sahityotsava\\". = Vision = Shastry sees Sanskrit as being India's lingua franca. He says, \\"Till now Samskrit has only been seen from a spiritual or religious perspective; it is high time Samskrit is approached from a scientific point of view as well.\\" He opines that Sanskrit would be a unifying factor in India. Shastry believes in taking Sanskrit to the under-privileged.

She was an advanced Irish nationalist, whose career mirrored that of her husband, James Michael 'Citizen' Flanagan and her friend Constance Markievicz. She was a member of the radical women's group Inghinidhe na h√âireann (which in English would mean Daughters of Ireland) and the Irish Volunteers women's auxiliary Cumann na mBan. Mary Perolz was born at Limerick on 7 May 1874, the third child of Richard Perolz and Bridget Carter. Her father and great-grandfather were printers by trade, which informed her literary career. She joined Inghinidhe na h√âireann at its foundation in 1900. She was a member of the Provisional Committee led by Maud Gonne and later Constance Markievicz, and whose members included the Gifford sisters and Helena Molony. She introduced other women such members of her extended family like Rose McNamara to the organisation. She was frequently involved in the theatre, and acted the first ever play in Irish staged publicly in Dublin, playing Meadda in December 1902 in Eillis agus an Bhean Deirce (Ellis and the Beggar Woman) by playwright Peadar Toner Mac Fhionnlaoich, better known under his pseudonym, C√∫ Uladh. Perolz, as her friends called her, taught Irish history and language in classes organised by Inghinidhe na h√âireann for Dublin schoolchildren, conducted by lantern light at night. Marie and Helena Molony were stalwarts of the Liberty Players and National Players with the young actor Captain Sean Connolly, who would die in the Easter Rising.Charles Townshend, \\"Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion\\", p.162. Feminist, actress and revolutionary By 1916, Perolz was a committed revolutionary, having joined Cumann na mBan and the syndicalist Irish Citizen Army, of which her friend Constance Markievicz was a leading officer.Bureau of Military History (BMH), Witness Statements (WS) (Margaret Keogh). She was a friend of James Connolly and in contact with Jim Larkin, the leaders of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union. She worked for the Irish Women Workers' Union (IWWU), and attended Trade Union Congress meetings at Sligo on its behalf. Perolz was registered at the official owner of Spark, a weekly socialist newspaper published between February 1915 and April 1916, edited by Markievicz. At an important public meeting in March 1916, she spoke as Markievicz, who was banned under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 from making appearances. Perolz read the text of Markievicz's speech and read the exclusion order imposed, and answered the questions of the audience.McCoole, Sinead, \\"No Ordinary Women\\", p.53. During the Easter Rising Perolz took a vital message from Padraic Pearse to Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Tipperary calling out the troops, and also arranged six other people to carry the same message around the country. As she cycled through Cork she met Tom√°s Mac Curtain and Terence MacSwiney in their broken-down car, on their way to inform volunteers that the Rising was cancelled. On the flyleaf of a pocket book, she was carrying was written the secret message from Pearse: \\"We go into action at noon today. PHP.\\" The initialled notepaper took Mac Curtain and MacSwiney by surprise, as they had expected orders to be signed rather than initialled.The information was provided by the Bureau of Military History interviews. Townshend, p.255. She got back to Dublin by Wednesday of Easter Week.Elizabeth McCarthy's pension application in Military Archives After the Rising Perolz hid out in Tralee,Townshend, pp.261‚Äì2. but she was betrayed and arrested on 2 May 1916, and brought to Dublin Castle under escort and imprisoned at Mountjoy Jail. The charge against her was her 'ownership' of James Connolly's Spark, 'the seditious weekly paper'.\\"The Spark\\" during the period of its circulation was estimated to be 2,382 copies. Sedition was a felonious crime, equivalent to treason, and could carry the death penalty. On 5 June, General Maxwell was still awaiting orders for her deportation to England. Constance Markievicz, detained under Defence of the Realm Regulation 14B, was sent to Oxford Jail. Kathleen Lynn was sent to Bath women's prison. James Connolly's secretary Winifred Carney went with Marie, Helena Molony, Brighid Foley, and Ellen Ryan to Aylesbury Prison.Mannix Joyce, 'The Story of Limerick and Kerry in 1916', \\"Capuchin Annual\\" 1966, pp.339‚Äì342. From an initial tally of 73 arrests, these were the only women imprisoned in England after the Rising.Lil Conlon, Cumann na mBan and the Women of Ireland, 1913‚Äì1925, (Kilkenny: Kilkenny People Ltd, 1969), p.23. They finally left Dublin on 20 June 1916. Perolz was sent to serve a sentence at Lewes Prison.Letter from Gen. John Maxwell to the Secretary of State for the War Office, 5 June 1916, Class WO141/20. PRO.McCoole, Sinead, No Ordinary Women, p.56. On their arrival in England, the women were given seven days to appeal against the sentences.Notice Regulation Order 14B 1916. Class HO144/1457/314179. PRO. The appeals were sent to a judge in the British High Court in London. Perolz' arrest scandalised her family; several resolved to change their surname to 'Prole', to disassociate themselves from her. After questions in the British parliament and a court appearance, Perolz and Breda Foley were released in July 1916. They were issued with travel warrants and expected to use them to go home to Ireland, landing at D√∫n Laoghaire.Class 10 114/1455/313106/0. PRO. McCoole, op cit., p.56. Immediately she was made Acting President of the Irish Women Workers' Union in Markievicz's stead. She travelled to England to greet her friend on her release from Aylesbury Prison on 17 June 1917, and accompanied her back to Ireland. Personal life Perolz and James Michael Flanagan, a leftist affectionately known as 'Citizen Flanagan', fell in love in 1919 and moved to live at 127 Botanic Road, Glasnevin, Dublin. She continued to work for women's rights in the labour movement. They married in 1919. She died on 1 December 1950.\\"Mary Flanagan\\", Defence Forces Ireland (√ìglaigh na h√âireann), Military Service Pensions Collection (1916 ‚Äì 1923).

Its common name is the orangespotted filefish, and it is native to shallow waters in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexoco. Description The orangespotted filefish grows to a length of about . The head has a number of wavy yellowish lines which run down onto the snout; near the eyes these alternate with bluish lines. The body has a number of broad brown bands separated by narrow whitish-yellow bands which converge at the caudal peduncle and continue onto the tailfin. On the caudal peduncle there is a moderate-sized white spot, often with a smaller white spot below it. The body is speckled with small orange spots, some of which have brown centres, and similar sized white spots. The first spine of the dorsal fin is located above the eye. It is very large and is separate from the rest of the fin. Immediately behind its base is a groove into which it can be folded when not needed. Distribution and habitat The orangespotted filefish occurs in the Caribbean Sea, the northern half of the Gulf of Mexico and the tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean. In the western Atlantic, its range extends from Massachusetts to southeastern Brazil, while in the eastern Atlantic, it is known from S√£o Tom√© and the Gulf of Guinea. It is usually found on reefs at depths between about , but usually no deeper than . Ecology The orangespotted filefish tends to swim near the seabed over rocky and coral reefs, hiding among the taller corals and gorgonians. It feeds mainly on sponges and algae, but also consumes tunicates, bryozoans and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Juveniles are found in the water column away from reefs and are preyed on by tuna, billfishes, and other large predatory fishes. This fish is held in low esteem by humans and seldom eaten by them.

This satellite will be Turkey's first fully domestically-produced communications satellite, and is expected to be completed by 2020 and launched in 2022. History According to an agreement signed on December 15, 2014, the satellite will be developed and manufactured indigenously by specialists under the leadership of T√úBƒ∞TAK Space Technologies Research Institute (T√úBƒ∞TAK Uzay) in cooperation with Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), ASELSAN and CTech Bili≈üim Teknolojileri A.≈û.. TAI will be in charge of design and production of the satellite structure and the subsystems such as spacecraft thermal control, chemical propulsion, harness and mechanical ground equipment needed to support the mission. TAI and T√úBƒ∞TAK Uzay will cooperate for the development of the software for satellite on-board data handling as well as for satellite command and control. They will perform the assembly, integration and test activities together at the TAI's Satellite Assembly Integration and Test Facility () (UMET) in Akƒ±ncƒ±, Ankara. T√ºrksat 6A will also have X-band satellite communication capability for use by the Turkish Armed Forces. ASELSAN, the Turkish military electronic systems producer, signed for this purpose a contract worth of CA$30 million with the Canadian company MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) in April 2014. The launch of the satellite is planned for 2022. It will be in a geosynchronous orbit positioned at 42¬∞ East with an expected on-orbit life time of at least 15 years. It will consist of 16 Ku band transponders, additionally 4 in reserve as well as two active and one in reserve X band transponders. The Ku band transponders will have a bandwidth of 7.3-18.1 GHz for uplink and 11.7-12.75 GHz downlink bandwidth. Each of the Ku band transponders will have a minimum power of 140 W and the X band transponders at least 150 W each. While the X band transponders will cover the territory of Turkey only, the Ku band transponders of T√ºrksat 6A will have three coverage zones: * entire Turkey, *\\"West Zone\\" covering the British Isles in the west, Scandinavian countries in the north, North Africa in the south, Caspian Sea in the east, *\\"East Zone\\" covering Anatolia in the west, Russian Federation in the north, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan in the south, China national boundary in the east.

But that joey manages to hit the ball on second attempt despite a sneaky trick from the spider monkey who is now the pitcher. The joey also makes it safe after running back and forth between bases. Next, Kiko becomes the batter. As Kiko hits the ball and runs to the bases, a joey jumps out his shorts, and another one jumps out of that joey's shorts, and so on, all of which are going in the same direction. The ostrich in the outfield tries to catch the ball, only to accidentally swallow it.

It is a rectangular single-story log structure measuring , built out of round logs joined by saddle notches at the corners. The diameter and length of the logs reduces as they rise to the eaves; oakum chinking is used to close the gaps. The house was built in 1935 by Joe and Blanche Puhl, settlers who were part of the Matanuska Valley Colony settlement project. This building is distinctive as a colony house because it was not built by the crews of the Works Progress Administration that built most of the colony's housing; the Puhls organized their own construction team and acquired materials for its construction on their own. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.

Collins claimed that the film's advertising was misleading because she had only performed in a minor supporting role shot two years earlier, but a sex scene had been added afterward using a body double to cash in on her new celebrity status from the hit TV show Dynasty. The other three performers claimed they had been under a false impression about the kind of film they were making.\\"Judge Bars Ads Depicting Collins' Nude 'Homework'\\". Variety.

The book covers the history of the Milwaukee Road's most famous passenger train, the Hiawatha, from its creation in 1934‚Äì1935 up through 1970. The book also covered the various other Milwaukee Road trains which carried the name \\"Hiawatha.\\"  Synopsis  The Hiawatha Story is organized chronologically. It begins with the construction of the first Hiawatha in 1934‚Äì1935. The Milwaukee Road created the train to compete with streamliners then under development by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad's (Burlington Route) and Chicago and North Western Railway. Unusually for the period, the Milwaukee Road constructed all the passenger equipment in its own shops, and Scribbins devotes considerable space to describing this equipment in detail, with many illustrative photographs. Scribbins also describes the work done to prepare the Chicago‚ÄìTwin Cities route for high- speed running. The Hiawatha regularly operated at speeds over . Scribbins follows the history of the original Hiawatha, later re-branded as the Twin Cities Hiawatha, which at the time the book was published in 1970 was still in operation. The popularity of the train led the Milwaukee Road to apply the \\"Hiawatha\\" brand to other routes, and Scribbins tells the history of these as well: Chippewa-Hiawatha, Midwest Hiawatha, North Woods Hiawatha and Olympian Hiawatha. Throughout, Scribbins pays close attention to the operation details as well as the rolling stock. Famous Milwaukee Road products such as the Beaver Tail and Skytop Lounge are described in detail, as are the Pullman- Standard Super Domes, the first full-length dome cars ever built, which operated on several \\"Hiawatha\\" routes.  Reception  The Hiawatha Story received favorable reviews on its publication. Richard C. Overton reviewed the book for Technology and Culture and called it \\"worthy of some attention by the serious student of American railroading.\\" Overton wrote that while Scribbins had included much railfan-pleasing technical detail the book \\"should appeal to a wide audience.\\" Martin Baker, writing in RQ, called the book an \\"exceptionally thorough and attractive account.\\" George W. Hilton praised the book in a review for Railway and Locomotive Historical Society Bulletin: \\"The book clearly conveys the impression of an effort to perfect it for its own sake that is the mark of the best scholarship of any sort.\\" At its annual meeting in 1971 the Wisconsin Historical Society presented an \\"Award of Merit\\" to Scribbins for The Hiawatha Story.  Publication  The Hiawatha Story was first published by Kalmbach Publishing in 1970. The dust jacket featured a watercolor by Gil Reid, art director at Kalmbach, called \\"Roaring Through Rondout\\", depicting a Milwaukee Road class A passing through Rondout, Illinois, at speed. In 2007 the University of Minnesota Press published a reprint of The Hiawatha Story as part of its Fesler-Lampert Minnesota Heritage series.

It is sometimes found in the aquarium trade. Description Coris cuvieri grows to a maximum length of which is slightly longer than the related Coris gaimard. It has a dullish orange-brownish background colour with green markings which become more obvious as the fish matures. Adult males have yellow and blue markings on their heads face and also have a greenish-white vertical stripe in the middle of the body, the stripe being absent in the females. There is a green spot on each body scale which contrasts with the dark reddish body. The juveniles, are similar to those of C. gaimard are bright orange-red in colour with 5 white patches with black edges along the back starting at the snout and ending on the caudal peduncle but as the juveniles grow older the differences become apparent. Distribution Coris cuvieri is found in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea, from the southern Arabian Peninsula along the east African coast to South Africa at 30¬∞S and east as far as Sumatra and Bali. Habitat and biology Coris cuvieri occurs over the exposed outer reef flats and in reefs within lagoons the seaward edges of reefs. It can be found in areas where there is a substrate consisting of mixed sand, coral and rubble. The juvenile fish occur in small tidal pools and in exposed reef flats with algae covered rubble. It is generally a solitary species which feeds largey on prey with hard shells such as crustaceans, molluscs and sea urchins. While foraging it turns over rocks, searching for hidden invertebrates. It is oviparous and when breeding the males and female form a pair. A single dominant male will guard a harem of several smaller females. Human use Coris cuvieri is used in the aquarium trade, although the similar Coris gaimard is preferred, the juveniles of the two species are very similar and can be confused. Species description and naming This species was formally described in 1831 as Julis cuvieri by the naturalist Edward Turner Bennett with the type locality given as Mauritius. The specific name honours the French naturalist Georges Cuvier (1790-1832), who described it under the name Julis aygula but which was determined by Bennett to be a separate species.

The only described species, Beddomixalus bijui, is endemic to the Western Ghats, India. Its name is derived from a combination of the cognomen of Richard Henry Beddome, in honour of his work on the amphibian diversity of the Western Ghats, as well as Ixalus, which is often used as a suffix for names of rhacophorid genera. Description Beddomixalus differs from the other rhacophorid genera by being a slender and elongated medium-sized frog, the female measuring up to in length; its yellowish-buff or reddish-brown dorsum carrying two distinct yellowish-cream longitudinal stripes; vomerine teeth and an absent lingual papilla; distinct supratympanic fold as well as tympanum; a rounded canthus rostralis; an obtusely concave loreal region; a simple and tubular Wolffian duct. At the same time, the early development of non- pigmented eggs occur exposed on moist swamp beds, without protection nor parental care; it has free-living aquatic tadpoles which are adapted to lentic conditions; and the genus inhabits mid- to high elevation forests. =Colour= Male Its dorsum is of buff-brown colour with a dark stripe between the eyes; a dark stripe extends medially from its interorbital region to its vent. It possesses two light-coloured, yellowish-cream longitudinal stripes extending along its dorsolateral region, on either side of its body, which are bordered on the lower side by black dots; a broad dark band extends from below the snout along the tympanum as well, up to the middle of the animal's flank, where it morphs into a pale patch covered in vermiculations. Female It has a reddish- to orange-brown dorsum with similar dark and light bands and vermiculations as in the male, while its ventral surface is white. =Tadpoles= Tadpoles are small, exotrophic and nektonic. They are oval, depressed and dark pigmented from the snout to the tip of the tail, including their fins. The ventral side is pale pink and less pigmented. Eyes are reddish and of moderate size. The musculus interhyoideus and intestine are visible through the ventrum. Its naris is equidistant from its snout and eye. Its tail fin is moderate and rounded at the end. The lower jaw sheath is V-shaped. Tadpoles of this species were observed with completely developed hindlimbs at stage 40, with a pale dorsolateral band appearing at stage 42. Its eyes are bright red and its body pigmentation is a greenish- yellow by stage 44, whilst metamorphs begin emerging on land. During stage 46, froglets are found on swamp vegetation. Behaviour The type species is primarily arboreal, inhabiting trees in and around highland swamps or marshes. During early breeding season, males were observed to aggregate around optimal breeding locations in unfilled swamp beds. They begin migrating to these during the onset of pre-monsoon showers from surrounding forest. Most males rest on shrubs and bushes up to a height of about and make a pulsating breeding chorus in unison. Air around these males is said to stink of \\"burnt rubber\\", similar to that felt around aggregating males of Hylarana malabarica. This odour is thought to be produced by glands on their dorsolateral margin. Males come down from their calling spots as night progresses and move on to grass patches in the swamp beds. Amplexus is pectoral. Eggs are non-pigmented and semiterrestrial, with an average diameter of 3.2mm. They are scattered on moist soil or a grassy substrate. Total clutch size was observed as 175 eggs. Distribution B. bijui is found in an elevation of between above sea level in evergreen forests in the Eravikulam plateau.

Road to Public Offering and Acquisition On August 2014, Pro-Friends announced that they are eyeing an initial public offering by September or October of the same year. However, there was no IPO that happened along the mentioned months and a press release was made December of the same year that the Securities and Exchange Commission has approved its IPO set on January 14, 2015 citing that the reason for the delay is due to negative leads brought about by a competitor prompting SEC to require Pro-Friends to clarify the allegations before the IPO application is processed. However, the reason for the delay was refuted by the Chief Operating Officer of PSE, Roel Refran. On January 9, 2015, SEC has approved a PHP 7.7 billion (approx US$175 million USD) IPO and the listing date was set January 14, 2015. Eventually, the IPO offering expired as the Philippine Stock Exchange has not given a go-signal for ProFriends due to outstanding issues and non-compliance with the standard requirements. The company has abandoned the offering since March 2015. In August 2015, Pro-Friends has abandoned its IPO when George Ty's GT Capital Holdings acquired 22.68 percent of its stake. On the second quarter of 2016, an additional 28.30% of Property Company of Friends Inc. was also acquired by GT Capital Holdings, Inc.. The deal increases GT Capital‚Äôs economic stake in Pro-Friends from 22.70 percent to 51.0 percent. Marketing Property Company of Friends is highly active on their marketing activities, being a sponsor for the location on the reality TV show I Do, existence of sponsored articles on various online and paper publications, advertisements on radio stations, and hired Janette Toral, to set up its SEO Lead Generation Program (July 2014 to December 2014). The company's aggressive marketing has been criticized by some real-estate analysts as creating a breeding culture of \\"The customer is not always right.\\"; which was brought about by their focus on creative marketing even though its core business is building houses.

Senate Resolution No. 859 Series of 2014 has been released by the 16th Congress. On December 9, 2014, a new Senate Resolution 1054 has been released from the office of the same senator to upgrade Resolution 859 by including alleged violations of real- estate developers on the independence of homeowners associations from control of real estate developers as mentioned in Republic Act 9904 implementation. = Protests, Expos√© and Lawsuits = In October 2015, due to allegations of violations, a surge of online protests and weblogs about the quality of construction and unsuited location of projects of the real-estate developer has prompted the company to file libel complaints to its complaining customers and individuals, including Ervin Malicdem, a hazards mapper. The complaint however was dismissed by the Mandaluyong Prosecutor's Office as the information exposed was \\"made in good faith and there is truth to the claim, while Pro-Friends was not able to controvert the allegations against them.\\" In March 2016, Congressman Karlo Nograles has urged the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council to cease the operations of Pro-Friends due to increasing number of complaints, including the presence of improper drainage that causes severe flooding, defective sewerage system and substandard materials were used for construction. HUDCC on the other hand, under the chairmanship of Vice President Leni Robredo, posted an advisory regarding the complaints hurled against the real-estate developer, prompting confirmation of 415 cases filed in HLURB that resulted in favor of the buyers. =The company's response= According to Property Company of Friends, turn-over delays are present as they continue to improve the efficiency of their processes while they are placing the safety of their customers as the priority. This paved way for the reason why prohibition of buyer inspections during construction phase are in effect. Additionally, flooding is brought about by the abnormal rainfall that inundated Cavite during Typhoon Maring of 2013 that reached 475 mm. However, petitioners have remained unsatisfied with the response as their policies are allegedly in violation of some tenets in the Consumer Act of the Philippines and Presidential Decree 957.As for the flooding caused by TS Maring, it only dropped 335 mm over a 24-hour period at Cavite City; which is twelve kilometers away from Lancaster New City. Residents of one their Cavite project believe the flooding was only caused partly by the amount of rainfall.

Built in 1914 at the Bath Iron Works, it at first served the tourist trade on the lake before being converted to a towboat hauling lumber. It was fully restored in the 1990s by the nonprofit Moosehead Maritime Museum, and is again giving tours on the lake. One of the very few surviving early lake boats in Maine, and the oldest vessel afloat built at Bath, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description Katahdin is a bluff-bowed steamer, long, with a beam of and a hull depth of . Its hull is steel, with two wooden decks. Its typical draft is . The original configuration included enclosed passenger spaces on two decks, with an open area at the stern on the lower deck, and surrounding the enclosed area on the upper deck. The pilot house is located at the front of the upper deck enclosure. The main passenger entryways are located on the lower deck on either side of the pilot house. Katahdin was built in 1914 at the Bath Iron Works for the Coburn Steamship Company, and is the oldest vessel afloat built at Bath. It was shipped in sections to Greenville, where final assembly took place. The primary use when launched was to deliver tourists and supplies to the Mount Kineo Resort from Greenville Junction, but it also offered cruises on the lake. The Great Depression and the increased use of the automobile for leisure transportation led to a decline in demand, and it made the last tourist trip in 1938. In 1940 it was acquired by a paper company (later itself merged into the Scott Paper Company), and converted for use as a towboat hauling timber across the lake. This conversion included the removal of the promenade areas of the decks, and the replacement of the steam plant by a diesel engine. It continued in this use until 1976. Not long afterward, a local nonprofit, the Moosehead Marine Museum, was organized to preserve the boat. It was sufficiently restored to provide tours of the lake, and again began serving the tourist trade. After a major fundraising effort begun in 1993, it was fully restored, including a replating of the hull by the Bath Iron Works. The upper deck is now fiberglass, and the promenades have been restored. In 2012 the keel was replaced. Katahdin in 2019 Katahdin now offers cruises between June and October, traveling either 12 or 20 miles up the lake, in cruises with durations of 3 and 4 1/2 hours. It is also available for hire for private events.

The interviewer is usually a professional or paid researcher, sometimes trained, who poses questions to the interviewee, in an alternating series of usually brief questions and answers. They can be contrasted with focus groups in which an interviewer questions a group of people and observes the resulting conversation between interviewees, or surveys which are more anonymous and limit respondents to a range of predetermined answer choices. In addition, there are special considerations when interviewing children. In phenomenological or ethnographic research, interviews are used to uncover the meanings of central themes in the life world of the subjects from their own point of view. Journalist Marguerite Martyn of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch made this sketch of herself interviewing a Methodist minister in 1908 for his views on marriage. Characteristics of qualitative research interviews * Interviews are completed by the interviewer based on what the interviewee says to be conformed and done. * Interviews are a far more personal form of research than questionnaires. * In the personal interview, the interviewer works directly with the interviewee. * Unlike with mail surveys, the interviewer has the opportunity to probe or ask follow up questions. * Interviews are generally easier for the interviewee, especially if what is sought are opinions and/or impressions. * Interviews are time-consuming and resource-intensive. * The interviewer is considered a part of the measurement instrument and has to be well trained in how to respond to any contingency. *Interviews provide an opportunity of face to face interaction between 2 persons; hence, they reduce conflicts. Technique When choosing to interview as a method for conducting qualitative research, it is important to be tactful and sensitive in your approach. Interviewer and researcher, Irving Seidman, devotes an entire chapter of his book, Interviewing as Qualitative Research, to the importance of proper interviewing technique and interviewer etiquette. Some of the fundamentals of his technique are summarized below: Listening: According to Seidman, this is both the hardest as well as the most important skill in interviewing. Furthermore, interviewers must be prepared to listen on three different levels: they must listen to what the participant is actually saying, they must listen to the ‚Äúinner voice‚ÄùSeidman, I (1998). Technique isn‚Äôt everything, but it is a lot. In Interviewing as qualitative research: A guide for researchers in education and the social sciences. New York, NY: Teachers College Press. or subtext of what the participant is communicating, and they must also listen to the process and flow of the interview so as to remain aware of how tired or bored the participant is as well as logistics such as how much time has already passed and how many questions still remain. The listening skills required in an interview require more focus and attention to detail than what is typical in normal conversation. Therefore, it is often helpful for interviewers to take notes while the participant responds to questions or to tape-record the interviews to be able to, more accurately, transcribe them later. Ask questions (to follow up and to clarify): While an interviewer generally enters each interview with a predetermined, standardized set of questions, it is important that they also ask follow-up questions throughout the process. Such questions might encourage a participant to elaborate upon something poignant that they've shared and are important in acquiring a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Additionally, it is important that an interviewer ask clarifying questions when they are confused. If the narrative, details, or chronology of a participant's responses become unclear, it is often appropriate for the interviewer to ask them to re-explain these aspects of their story so as to keep their transcriptions accurate. Be respectful of boundaries: Seidman explains this tactic as ‚ÄúExplore, don‚Äôt probe,‚Äù It is essential that while the participant is being interviewed they are being encouraged to explore their experiences in a manner that is sensitive and respectful. They should not be ‚Äúprobed‚Äù in such a way that makes them feel uncomfortable or like a specimen in a lab. If too much time is spent dwelling on minute details or if too many follow-up questions are asked, it is possible that the participant will become defensive or unwilling to share. Thus, it is the interviewer's job to strike a balance between ambiguity and specificity in their question asking. Be wary of leading questions: Leading questions are questions which suggest or imply an answer. While they are often asked innocently they run the risk of altering the validity of the responses obtained as they discourage participants from using their own language to express their sentiments. Thus it is preferable that interviewers ask open- ended questions instead. For example, instead of asking ‚ÄúDid the experience make you feel sad?‚Äù - which is leading in nature - it would be better to ask ‚ÄúHow did the experience make you feel‚Äù - as this suggests no expectation. Don't interrupt: Participants should feel comfortable and respected throughout the entire interview--thus interviewers should avoid interrupting participants whenever possible. While participants may digress in their responses and while the interviewer may lose interest in what they are saying at one point or another it is critical that they be tactful in their efforts to keep the participant on track and to return to the subject matter in question. Make the participant feel comfortable: Interviewing proposes an unusual dynamic in that it often requires the participant to divulge personal or emotional information in the presence of a complete stranger. Thus, many interviewers find it helpful to ask the participant to address them as if they were ‚Äúsomeone else,‚Äù such as a close friend or family member. This is often an effective method for tuning into the aforementioned ‚Äúinner voice‚Äù of the participant and breaking down the more presentational barriers of the guarded ‚Äúouter voice‚Äù which often prevails. Strengths and weaknesses There are many methods. When considering what type of qualitative research method to use, Qualitative Interviewing has many advantages. Possibly the greatest advantage of Qualitative interviewing is the depth of detail from the interviewee. Interviewing participants can paint a picture of what happened in a specific event, tell us their perspective of such event, as well as give other social cues. Social cues, such as voice, intonation, body language etc. of the interviewee can give the interviewer a lot of extra information that can be added to the verbal answer of the interviewee on a question. This level of detailed description, whether it be verbal or nonverbal, can show an otherwise hidden interrelatedness between emotions, people, objects unlike many quantitative methods of research.Weiss, R. S. (1994). Learning from strangers, the art and method of qualitative interview studies. New York, NY: Free Pr. In addition, qualitative interviewing has a unique advantage in its specific form. Researchers can tailor the questions they ask to the respondent in order to get rich, full stories and the information they need for their project. They can make it clear to the respondent when they need more examples or explanations.Emans, Ben (1986). Interviewen; theorie, techniek en training. Groningen: Wolters-Noordhoff. Not only can researchers also learn about specific events, they can also gain insight into people's interior experiences, specifically how people perceive and how they interpreted their perceptions. How events affected their thoughts and feelings. In this, researchers can understand the process of an event instead of what just happened and how they reacted to it. Another advantage of qualitative interviewing is what it can give to the readers of academic journals and papers. Research can write a clearer report to their readers, giving them a ‚Äúfuller understanding of the experiences of our respondents and a greater chance to identify with the respondent, if only briefly.‚Äù Qualitative interviewing is not a perfect method for all types of research. It does have its disadvantages. First, there can be complications with the planning of the interview. Not only is recruiting people for interviews hard, due to the typically personal nature of the interview, planning where to meet them and when can be difficult. Participants can cancel or change the meeting place at the last minute. During the actual interview, a possible weakness is missing some information. This can arise from the immense multitasking that the interviewer must do. Not only do they have to make the respondent feel very comfortable, they have to keep as much eye contact as possible, write down as much as they can, and think of follow up questions. After the interview, the process of coding begins and with this comes its own set of disadvantages. First, coding can be extremely time consuming. This process typically requires multiple people, which can also become expensive. Second, the nature of qualitative research itself, doesn't lend itself very well to quantitative analysis. Some researchers report more missing data in interview research than survey research, therefore it can be difficult to compare populations Participant in qualitative research interviews Compared to something like a written survey, interviews allow for a significantly higher degree of intimacy,Seidman, Irving. Interviewing as Qualitative Research: A Guide for Researchers in Education and the Social Sciences. Teachers College Press, 1998, pg.49 with participants often revealing personal information to their interviewers in a real-time, face-to-face setting. As such, this technique can evoke an array of significant feelings and experiences within those being interviewed. On the positive end, interviewing can provide participants with an outlet to express themselves. Since the job of interviewers is to learn, not to treat or counsel, they do not offer participants any advice, but nonetheless, telling an attentive listener about concerns and cares can be pleasing. As qualitative researcher Robert S. Weiss puts it, ‚ÄúTo talk to someone who listens, and listens closely, can be valuable, because one‚Äôs own experience, through the process of being voiced and shared, is validated.‚ÄùWeiss, Robert. Learning from Strangers: The Art and Method of Qualitative Interview Studies. The Free Press, 1994, pg. 122 Such validation, however, can have a downside if a participant feels let down upon termination of the interview relationship, for, unlike with figures like therapists or counselors, interviewers do not take a measure of ongoing responsibility for the participant, and their relationship is not continuous.Seidman, Irving. Interviewing as Qualitative Research: A Guide for Researchers in Education and the Social Sciences. Teachers College Press, 1998, pg.91 To minimize the potential for this disappointment, researchers should tell participants how many interviews they will be conducting in advance, and also provide them with some type of closure, such as a research summary or a copy of the project publication.Weiss, Robert. Learning from Strangers: The Art and Method of Qualitative Interview Studies. The Free Press, 1994, pg. 123 On the negative end, the multiple-question based nature of interviews can lead participants to feel uncomfortable and intruded upon if an interviewer encroaches on territory that they feel is too personal or private. To avoid crossing this line, researchers should attempt to distinguish between public information and private information, and only delve deeper into private information after trying to gauge a participant's comfort level in discussing it. Furthermore, the comparatively intimate nature of interviews can make participants feel vulnerable to harm or exploitation.Seidman, Irving. Interviewing as Qualitative Research: A Guide for Researchers in Education and the Social Sciences. Teachers College Press, 1998 This can be especially true for situations in which a superior interviews a subordinate, like when teacher interviewers his or her student. In these situations, participants may be fearful of providing a ‚Äúwrong answer,‚Äù or saying something that could potentially get them into trouble and reflect on them negatively. However, all interview relationships, not just explicitly superior-subordinate ones, are marked by some degree of inequality, as interviewers and participants want and receive different things from the technique. Thus, researchers should always be concerned with the potential for participant feelings of vulnerability, especially in situations where personal information is revealed. In order to combat such feelings of vulnerability and inequity and to make participants feel safe, equal, and respected, researchers should provide them with information about the study, such as who is running it and what potential risks it might entail, and also with information about their rights, such as the right to review interview materials and withdraw from the process at any time. It is especially important that researchers always emphasize the voluntary nature of participating in a study so that the participants remain aware of their agency. These aforementioned power dynamics present in interviews can also have specific effects on different social groups according to racial background, gender, age, and class. Race, for example, can pose issues in an interview setting if participants of a marginalized racial background are interviewed by white researchers, in which case the existence of historical and societal prejudices can evoke a sense of skepticism and distrust. Gender dynamics can similarly affect feelings, with men sometimes acting overbearingly when interviewing women and acting dismissively when being interviewed by women, and same-gendered pairs being vulnerable to false assumptions of commonality or a sense of implicit competition. In terms of class, participants of perceived lower status demonstrate, in some cases, either excessive skepticism or excessive submissiveness, and in terms of age, children and seniors may exhibit fears of being patronized. In order to minimize these social group related negative feelings, researchers should remain sensitive to possible sources of such tensions, and act accordingly by emphasizing good manners, respect, and a genuine interest in the participant, all of which can all help bridge social barriers. Finally, another aspect of interviews that can affect how a participant feels is how the interviewer expresses his or her own feelings, for interviewers can project their moods and emotions onto those they are interviewing. For instance, if an interviewer feels noticeably uncomfortable, the participant may begin to share this discomfort, and if an interviewer expresses anger, he or she is in danger of passing it on to the participant. So, researchers should try to remain calm, polite, and interested at all times.  Interviewing children  = Key terms = Qualitative interviews are a way of gathering data that involve the researcher and participant/s engaging in a focused conversation.Savin-Baden, M. & Major, C. (2013). Qualitative research: The essential guide to theory and practice. London: Routledge. Interviews are considered to be ‚Äúthe most common method of gathering data for qualitative research‚Äù; further, they ‚Äúare an integral part of most research traditions.‚Äù Interviews may be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured. Semi-structured interviews, in which a researcher has questions to guide the interview while engaging and responding to the participant beyond the interview script, are recommended for work with children. Children are individuals under the age of 18 who are considered a vulnerable population in research ethics. Research ethics refers to an aspect of research focusing on the ‚Äúprinciples of right and wrong that a particular group accepts‚Äù. Due to the young age of children, consent must be obtained from parents prior to engaging children in research. = Historical background = Child development and psychology has played a role in the development of including children‚Äôs perspectives in research. While not all children follow a linear trajectory of development, it has been found that children between the ages of five and seven are capable of discussing their opinions with others, and by age six, children can recount their thoughts and preferences. Between the ages of seven and eleven years old, children begin to use logic to solve problems and develop self-esteem; around age ten, children tend to be able to effectively convey their thoughts and emotions to one another. These findings indicate children have the skills to discuss their experiences, thoughts, and emotions; they can be considered experts on their own lives. Much of the methodological resources that discuss strategies for interviewing children present information from child development as a justification of this practice. Qualitative research has more recently begun discussing the ethics of interviewing children. Theoretical shifts in the 1990s paved the way to including children‚Äôs voices in research. The theoretical concept of children‚Äôs agency arose, emphasizing the belief that children are ‚Äúcapable of making sense of their views, and sharing...them...[Further,] as human beings, they are entitled to express these views‚Äù. By conceptualizing children in this way, they become valuable research participants. Although children can participate in research, child-friendly and appropriate strategies are essential when conducting research. = Current practices =  Ethical considerations  Key ethical considerations when interviewing children include ensuring informed consent and a willingness to participate or continue participation, managing the presence of a power dynamic between the researcher and the participant, and issues of disclosurePhelan, S. K., & Kinsella, E. A. (2013). Picture this . . . safety, dignity, and voice‚Äîethical research with children: Practical considerations for the reflexive researcher. Qualitative inquiry, 19(2), 81. Retrieved from http://search.ebscohost.com.umasslowell.idm.oclc.org/ login.aspx?direct=true&db;=edb&AN;=84600231&site;=eds-live. A study of children in New Zealand with motor impairments addressed both informed consent and a willingness to participate through the use of five strategies intended to help children decide whether or not they wanted to participate in the study. Strategies included providing an information sheet, interview guide of questions, consent form and questionnaires in child-friendly language and formats, an invitation letter with flexible data collection strategies, child- selected interview setting, and inviting parents to be present during the interview. A study utilizing visual data also employed similar strategies after obtaining parent consent. To further address children‚Äôs willingness to participate, researchers engaged in responsive, semi-structured interviews in which children were allowed to guide the interview process. The power dynamic of an adult researcher and a child participant is an important ethical consideration. Researchers must recognize that they are inherently in a position of power when working with children, and this power dynamic impacts the interview process. Further, it is important for researchers to resist falling into a ‚Äúteacher mode‚Äù, which signals participants that there is a right or wrong answer to the interview questions. Issues of disclosure are also present when interviewing children, as they are a vulnerable population, susceptible to oversharing. To manage this risk, researchers mitigate this issue by allowing the child to lead the interview, letting the child control how much they share with the researcher. Phelan and Kinsella also warn against creating an environment that is too comfortable for children.  Best practices  Best practices when interviewing children include ensuring participants‚Äô comfort, providing positive responses to children, allowing children to guide the conversation, completing the interview in a comfortable environment, and employing flexible, responsive methodologyTeachman, G., & Gibson, B. E. (2013). Children and youth with disabilities: Innovative methods for single qualitative interviews. Qualitative health research, 23(2), 264. Retrieved from http://search.ebscohost.com.umasslowell.idm.oclc.org/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=edb&AN;=84490887&site;=eds- live. Practices including allowing children to guide the conversation, the use of a comfortable environment, and flexible methodology are echoed in ethical considerations. Adler, Salantera, and Zumstein encourage researchers to provide non-verbal feedback to children, such as nodding or raising eyebrows to indicate interest, but warn against affirmations that would cause children to limit what they're saying to what may be deemed interesting. In contrast, Poinzovsky-Bergelson, Dayan, Wahle, and Roer-Strier found affirmations and encouragement from researchers elicited what was deemed to be the richest data. There is also conflicting research on whether researchers should ask ‚Äòwhy‚Äô questions to children. In a study of what encourages or inhibits children‚Äôs participation in research, it was found that ‚Äòwhy‚Äô questions produced rich data, especially when combined with encouraging statements. However, previous research had suggested ‚Äòwhy‚Äô questions should be avoided when interviewing children.Clark, A., & Statham, C. (2005). Listening to young children: Experts in their own lives. Adoption and fostering, 29, 45‚Äì56.  Visual data  Visual data included photo elicitation, co-created visual data, and child-created visual data. Photo elicitation interviews (PEI) can be implemented in research interviews; researchers may ask children to take photographs of their daily activities and discuss these photos in their interview. PEI has been found to be useful in reducing issues of disclosure and minimize power imbalances; in a study focused upon ethics of interviewing children, it was a successful method of engaging children in qualitative interviews. Co-created visual data was created through participatory drawing; children create drawings around specified content at the request of a researcher. This model of interviewing to be easily implemented, engage students, and diminish barriers and power dynamics between the child and the researcher. Limitations present include challenges with interpretation of the visual data collected and the validity of these analyses. Child-created visual data was utilized in the New Zealand study of children with motor impairments; students were asked to draw or paint their choice of leisure activity and then engaged in a conversation about what they drew. Drawing was found to be the second most preferred method of engaging in the interview among participants and was found to reduce anxiety for some children. Types ; Informal, Conversational interview: No predetermined questions are asked, in order to remain as open and adaptable as possible to the interviewee's nature and priorities; during the interview the interviewer \\"goes with the flow\\". ; General interview guide approach: Intended to ensure that the same general areas of information are collected from each interviewee; this provides more focus than the conversational approach, but still allows a degree of freedom and adaptability in getting the information from the interviewee. ; Standardized, open-ended interview: The same open-ended questions are asked to all interviewees; this approach facilitates faster interviews that can be more easily analyzed and compared. ; Closed, fixed-response interview: All interviewees are asked the same questions and asked to choose answers from among the same set of alternatives. This format is useful for those not practiced in interviewing. This type of interview is also referred to as structured.Moore, Brenda (2014). \\"In-Depth Interviewing\\" in Routledge Handbook of Research Methods in Military Studies, (eds.) J. Sorters, P. Shields, S Henriette. New York: Routledge. 115-128. Household research Research on households pose specific ethical problems of anonymity and consent among interviewees, and there is an ongoing controversy over whether spouses should be interviewed in personal, individual interviews or in couple interviews. Interviewer's judgments According to Hackman and Oldman several factors can bias an interviewer's judgment about a job applicant. However these factors can be reduced or minimized by training interviews to recognized them. Some examples are::: ;Prior Information: Interviewers generally have some prior information about job candidates, such as recruiter evaluations, application blanks, online screening results, or the results of psychological tests. This can cause the interviewer to have a favorable or unfavorable attitude toward an applicant before meeting them. ;The Contrast Effect: How the interviewers evaluate a particular applicant may depend on their standards of comparison, that is, the characteristics of the applicants they interviewed previously. ;Interviewers' Prejudices: This can be done when the interviewers' judgement is their personal likes and dislikes. These may include but are not limited to racial and ethnic background, applicants who display certain qualities or traits and refuse to consider their abilities or characteristics.

From November 10 to 16, 2014, Evolve's parent company, WWNLive, held four events in a ten-day tour of China. Busick ended the tour with a record of 2 wins (against Timothy Thatcher and Jody Kristofferson) and 2 losses (to Johnny Gargano and Thatcher). =Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (2014‚Äì2015)= On August 29, 2014, Busick made his debut for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG), participating in their annual Battle of Los Angeles tournament losing to Roderick Strong in the first round. He also wrestled the following night teaming with Drew Gulak coming up short against ReDRagon. He returned the following show at Untitled II losing to Tommaso Ciampa and Black Cole Sun losing a four-way to Brian Cage which also involved Uhaa Nation and Ciampa. On February 27, 2015, at From Out of Nowhere, Busick picked up his first win in PWG by defeating old rival \\"Speedball\\" Mike Bailey, before losing to Brian Cage at Don't Sweat the Technique. He also reunited with Gulak to compete in DDT4 losing in the first round to Ricochet and Rich Swann. He appeared at Mystery Vortex III defeating Timothy Thatcher before getting into a confrontation with the newly formed Mount Rushmore 2.0 and specifically Super Dragon before getting superkicked by The Young Bucks. He then participated in the 2015 Battle of Los Angeles defeating Andrew Everett in the first round. The following night, he would team with Everett and Trevor Lee in a losing effort against Super Dragon and The Young Bucks in the very first six-man tag team Guerilla Warfare match. He would then wrestle his final PWG match losing to Chris Hero the next night in the second round. =WWE (2009, 2011, 2015‚Äìpresent)= Appeared on Smackdown on January 1, 2010 (taped on December 29, 2009) as The Carolina Panther in a squash match vs The Great Khali. Appeared on Raw on October 10, 2011 and on Smackdown on October 28, 2011 as a paper bags assistant during Cody Rhodes undashing gimmick. On September 1, 2015, it was reported that Girard had signed a developmental contract with WWE and would be reporting to NXT the following month. He made his debut at an NXT house show on October 30, in a Halloween battle royal, which was won by Bayley. On January 9, 2016, he made his singles match debut under his real name, losing to Rich Swann. At a set of television tapings held on January 22, he made his televised debut (which aired on February 24), in a losing effort against Apollo Crews. He then wrestled in a dark match before NXT TakeOver: Dallas, where he lost to Manny Andrade. In June, Girard debuted the new ring name Oney Lorcan. From August, Lorcan feuded with Danny Burch; after the two traded victories, they formed a tag team and feuded with Riddick Moss and Tino Sabbatelli. In early 2018, they took part in the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic, but were eliminated in the first round by team of Roderick Strong and Pete Dunne. Lorcan suffered an orbital bone fracture during his tag team match with Burch against The Undisputed Era at NXT Takeover: Chicago, requiring facial surgery. Lorcan returned two months to the day of his injury on August 16, losing to War Raiders at an NXT live event. Lorcan spent the latter part of 2018 bouncing between the NXT and NXT UK brands. In February 2019, Lorcan and Burch were participants in the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic tournament, but were eliminated in the first round by The Forgotten Sons. In March 2019, Lorcan took part in a tournament on 205 Live to name a challenger for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship at WrestleMania 35. He defeated Humberto Carrillo in the first round, but lost to Cedric Alexander in the second round. On March 26, 2019, it was announced that he was moving to the 205 Live brand, but would still wrestle for NXT. He then redebuted on that nights episode of 205 Live, costing Alexander a match against Ariya Daivari and attacking him after the match, establishing himself as a heel in the process. On the April 16 episode of 205 Live, he defeated Alexander in Alexander's final match on 205 Live. After the match, Lorcan shook Alexander's hand as a sign of respect, turning Lorcan face in the process. On the September 18 episode of NXT, Lorcan was defeated by Lio Rush in a number one contender's match for the Cruiserweight Championship. On December 6, 2019, Oney Lorcan announced on his Twitter that he signed a multi-year contract with WWE. On the February 13, 2020 episode of NXT UK, Lorcan teamed up with Danny Burch in a tag team match defeating The Hunt (Primate and Wild Boar). They then teamed up again on the February 13 episode of NXT UK in a non-title match against the NXT UK Tag Team Champions Gallus (Mark Coffey and Wolfgang) but failed to beat them. On the May 20 episode of NXT, Lorcan and Burch defeated Ever-Rise and proceeded to call out the NXT Tag Team Champions Imperium (Marcel Barthel and Fabian Aichner) afterwards by mocking their signature pose. The following week, they challenged them for the NXT Tag Team Titles. Other media Girard made his video game debut as Oney Lorcan as a playable character in WWE 2K19 and also appeared in WWE 2K20.

Harmonic morphisms form a special class of harmonic maps i.e. those that are horizontally (weakly) conformal. In local coordinates, x on M and y on N, the harmonicity of \\\\phi is expressed by the non-linear system :\\\\tau(\\\\phi )=\\\\sum_{i,j=1}^m g^{ij}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\phi^{\\\\gamma}}{\\\\partial x_i\\\\partial x_j} -\\\\sum_{k=1}^m\\\\hat\\\\Gamma^k_{ij}\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\phi^{\\\\gamma}}{\\\\partial x_k} +\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta=1}^n\\\\Gamma^{\\\\gamma}_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}\\\\circ\\\\phi \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\phi^{\\\\alpha}}{\\\\partial x_i} \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\phi^{\\\\beta }}{\\\\partial x_j} \\\\right)=0, where \\\\phi^\\\\alpha=y_\\\\alpha\\\\circ\\\\phi and \\\\hat\\\\Gamma,\\\\Gamma are the Christoffel symbols on M and N, respectively. The horizontal conformality is given by :\\\\sum_{i,j=1}^mg^{ij}(x)\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\phi^\\\\alpha}{\\\\partial x_i}(x)\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\phi^\\\\beta }{\\\\partial x_j}(x)=\\\\lambda^2(x)h^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(\\\\phi(x)), where the conformal factor \\\\lambda:M\\\\to\\\\mathbb R_0^+ is a continuous function called the dilation. Harmonic morphisms are therefore solutions to non-linear over-determined systems of partial differential equations, determined by the geometric data of the manifolds involved. For this reason, they are difficult to find and have no general existence theory, not even locally.  Complex analysis  When the codomain of \\\\phi:(M,g)\\\\to (N^2,h) is a surface, the system of partial differential equations that we are dealing with, is invariant under conformal changes of the metric h. This means that, at least for local studies, the codomain can be chosen to be the complex plane with its standard flat metric. In this situation a complex-valued function \\\\phi=u+iv:(M,g)\\\\to\\\\mathbb C is a harmonic morphisms if and only if :\\\\Delta_M(\\\\phi)=\\\\Delta_M (u)+i\\\\Delta_M (v)=0 and :g( abla\\\\phi, abla\\\\phi )=\\\\ abla u\\\\^2-\\\\ abla v\\\\^2+2ig( abla u, abla v)=0. This means that we look for two real-valued harmonic functions u,v:(M,g)\\\\to\\\\mathbb R with gradients abla u, abla v that are orthogonal and of the same norm at each point. This shows that complex-valued harmonic morphisms \\\\phi:(M,g)\\\\to\\\\mathbb C from Riemannian manifolds generalise holomorphic functions f:(M,g,J)\\\\to\\\\mathbb C from K√§hler manifolds and possess many of their highly interesting properties. The theory of harmonic morphisms can therefore be seen as a generalisation of complex analysis.  Minimal surfaces  In differential geometry, one is interested in constructing minimal submanifolds of a given ambient space (M,g). Harmonic morphisms are useful tools for this purpose. This is due to the fact that every regular fibre \\\\phi^{-1}({z_0}) of such a map \\\\phi:(M,g)\\\\to (N^2,h) with values in a surface is a minimal submanifold of the domain with codimension 2. This gives an attractive method for manufacturing whole families of minimal surfaces in 4-dimensional manifolds (M^4,g), in particular, homogeneous spaces, such as Lie groups and symmetric spaces.  Examples  * Identity and constant maps are harmonic morphisms. * Holomorphic functions in the complex plane are harmonic morphisms. * Holomorphic functions in the complex vector space \\\\mathbb C^n are harmonic morphisms. * Holomorphic maps from K√§hler manifolds with values in a Riemann surface are harmonic morphisms. * The Hopf maps \\\\phi:S^3\\\\to S^2, \\\\phi:S^7\\\\to S^4 and \\\\phi:S^{15}\\\\to S^8 are harmonic morphisms. * For compact Lie groups K\\\\subset H\\\\subset G the standard Riemannian fibration \\\\phi:G/H\\\\to G/K is a harmonic morphism. * Riemannian submersions with minimal fibres are harmonic morphisms.

Life  In the sources he is commonly called \\"Stephen the magistros, the son of Kalomaria\\" (), making him a son of Maria, the sister of Empress Theodora, the wife of Emperor Theophilos (reigned 829‚Äì842) and regent for Michael III (r. 842‚Äì867). He is first mentioned in 886, at the beginning of the reign of Leo VI the Wise (r. 886‚Äì912), when he was tasked, along with the Domestic of the Schools Andrew the Scythian, with leading the court examining Patriarch Photios and Theodore Santabarenos on accusations of treason. Like Andrew, Stephen had been a member of the court under Leo's father Basil I the Macedonian (r. 867‚Äì886), but by the end of Basil's reign apparently belonged to a group of followers of Leo, who in 883 where even accused of plotting against Basil. His career prior to 886 is unknown, but on his seal, dated to ca. 913‚Äì922, are recorded the ranks which he successively held: basilikos protospatharios, patrikios and anthypatos. Stephen is not mentioned again for most of Leo's reign, but he probably retained his title of magistros throughout this time. He is next attested ca. 908 in an act of adjudication concerning the Kolobou Monastery near Mount Athos, as a member of the committee examining the case. In 910, he was the recipient of a letter by the diplomat Leo Choirosphaktes, in which the latter pleaded with Stephen to intercede with the emperor and secure his recall from exile. In June 913, he was appointed by Leo's brother and successor Alexander (r. 912‚Äì913) as one of the seven guardians of the underage Constantine VII (r. 913‚Äì959), along with the Patriarch Nicholas I Mystikos, the fellow magistros John Eladas, the rhaiktor John Lazanes, the otherwise obscure Euthymius and Alexander's henchmen Basilitzes and Gabrielopoulos. In this capacity, he participated in the reception of the sons of the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon in the Palace of Blachernae in August 913, along with Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos and John Eladas. Follis with Empress-regent Zoe and her son, Constantine VII He remained in high standing under the regency of Empress-dowager Zoe Karbonopsina (914‚Äì919), for in 917 he was able, along with Constantine Gongyles, to intercede and save the admiral Romanos Lekapenos from being blinded for failing to adequately support the land army during the disastrous Battle of Acheloos against the Bulgarians. His high position becomes evident from the fact that in 919, when Zoe was deposed from the regency by Constantine VII with the support of Lekapenos, the young emperor sought recognition of the fact from Stephen and Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos. Stephen was unable, however, to prevent Lekapenos from staging a coup on 25 March 919: as the imperial fleet, led by Lekapenos, sailed into the Boukoleon harbour, Stephen fled the palace. Romanos Lekapenos was immediately named magistros and megas hetaireiarches, and effectively took over the reins of government. Lekapenos moved swiftly to consolidate his position: in April 919 his daughter Helena was married to Constantine VII, and Lekapenos assumed the new title basileopator; on 24 September, he was named Caesar; and on 17 December 919, Romanos Lekapenos was crowned senior emperor. A number of plots against the usurper were discovered over the next few years, and loyalists of the powerless Constantine VII were purged and exiled. Despite his advanced age‚Äîhe must have been over 80 at the time‚Äîon 8 February 921, Stephen too fell victim to such a purge. Accused of having himself designs on the throne, he was exiled to the island of Antigone, where he was forced to become a monk. His supporters Theophanes Teichiotes and the orphanotrophos Paul were also exiled.

It was released on Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux on 26 January 2015. In Gravity Ghost, the player controls the ghost of a young girl named Iona, who flies through a fantasised version of space (analogous with purgatory) with her friend, a ghost fox. As a living girl, Iona lives on a secluded island with her three sisters, her mother and father. The eldest sister, Hickory, becomes their guardian after the sudden death of their parents. The plot is revealed gradually through a series of animated cutscenes, as Iona seeks to mend a planet which has been torn apart and replaced by a black hole. The PlayStation 4 version was released on 6 August 2019. Plot :The story is told through nonlinear narrative, this summary is given in chronological order. Iona, a young girl, lives happily with her three sisters, mother and father in a secluded island community. Iona's oldest sister, Hickory, is in a relationship with another resident of the island, a young man named Arthur. The two want to get married, but Hickory plans to pursue an education in astronomy before settling down. One day, when Iona's youngest sister, Pepper, playfully wanders out of bounds through a hole in a fence, she unknowingly ingests a poisoned mushroom. Unable to find an antidote on the island, Iona's parents rush to the mainland through a stormy night, tasking Arthur to maintain the lighthouse light for their return later in the night. As Arthur waits at the top of the lighthouse, lightning strikes it, shattering the lens, incapacitating Arthur and dooming Iona's parents to crash. Hickory becomes the guardian of her sisters and now plans to marry Arthur, as she can no longer leave her sisters on the island behind to pursue her education. Pepper has made a miraculous recovery without the antidote. Tensions between Hickory and Iona build, as Iona blames Arthur for their parents' deaths. She becomes increasingly rebellious, befriending a wild fox named Voy and spending most of her time out of the house. She frequently visits her neighbours: Sal, an old poacher who builds a treehouse which Iona frequently hides in; and Eddy, an old woman who believes in a \\"sacred geometry\\" that holds the universe together. The animosity between Hickory and Iona builds until the night of Hickory's wedding. Iona, still angry at Arthur and distressed that her opposition to the wedding is being ignored, runs away into the forest with a lantern. She accidentally drops it and continues in the dark to find Voy, intending to run away from home with him. Retreating to the treehouse where she has stored some food to lure Voy, she tearfully explains to him her plan. Unbeknownst to Iona, he has a family living in the forest, and so refuses to leave with her. Iona defiantly resolves to run away on her own, and begins slowly edging out to the end of a branch where some of her supplies are kept. Attracted by the food, a different fox climbs the tree and begins edging along the branch as well, startling Iona, who slips and falls to her death. The ghosts of Iona and Voy fly through space together. When Voy flies away, Iona goes on a mission traversing seven constellations to retrieve him. Along the way, she gets advice from the seven guardian spirits of the seven constellations, and reunites the spirits of wild animals with their bodies, sending them properly into the afterlife. In the centre of the universe is a black hole left by a destroyed planet, around which Iona can see her friends and family, in varying states of distress or peril. As Iona retrieves fragments of the planet, she begins to feel remorseful about her treatment of them. She finds out that Voy had a family and that Eddy, foraging for seasoning mushrooms, was responsible for cutting the hole in the fence through which Pepper found the poisoned mushroom. She finds out that the fox which startled her off the branch was Voy's mate, and watches as Sal finds and brings her body to Hickory, who kills Voy in rage. Iona also realises with alarm that the lantern she dropped has ignited a forest fire, implied to be what killed all the animal spirits Iona meets. Desperate to save her loved ones, Iona subtly manipulates their thoughts, feelings and aspects of nature to minimise their grief and to help them escape. Once all the fragments of the planet are delivered to the black hole, Iona reunites her spirit with her own body, which had been trapped in the middle of the black hole. Together with Voy's spirit, Iona guides the islanders and the Voy's family to safety on the coast before entering the afterlife herself. Years later, the community has gone back to living on the island and have begun to rebuild. Hickory and Arthur have become the guardians of Iona's two younger sisters, as well as having had a baby of their own. Hickory has become an astronomer, and when she discovers a periodic comet, she names it Iona's comet. The comet has an orbital period of twelve years, the age which Iona was at the time of her death. The game ends as Eddy, who firmly believes that it was Iona's spirit who enabled them all to escape the forest fire, hopefully states that they will see her again in twelve years.

It has been widely recorded, and was one of the top songs in the U.S. in 1955 and again in 1962. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. Background The song/poem begins with a narration by an unnamed man who is prospecting for gold in the Western U.S. He wanders into the deserted \\"valley of the shifting, whispering sands\\", and describes its desolate, frightening environment. After wandering there for \\"days and weeks\\" and using all his food and water, he escapes in some unknown way. He \\"pays his final debt\\" for being spared by telling what he learned out in the desert. The narration ends, followed by a song that reprises his experience. The entire work takes almost six minutes to recite and sing. Some recorded releases omit the narration entirely, while others incorporate it and the song in various sequences. Recordings The song was written in 1950 and recorded in 1955. It charted twice, by Rusty Draper and also by Billy Vaughn and His Orchestra, and both became hit recordings. Vaughn's version utilized the spoken word of Ken Nordine, whose voice was often used in voice-overs and on some recordings. There was even a parody version, \\"The Shifting Whimpering Sands\\", recorded by Homer and Jethro. The song was released again by Billy Vaughn on an album of that name in 1962, with the voices of the Ray Conniff Singers and again with narration by Ken Nordine.

It is the type species of the genus Pseudorhabdosynochus Yamaguti, 1958. Description Sclerotized copulatory organs of Pseudorhabdosynochus epinepheli (left, male; right, female) Pseudorhabdosynochus epinepheli is a small monogenean, about half a millimetre in length. Adults are hermaphroditic. The species has the general characteristics of other diplectanids, with a flat body and a posterior haptor, which is the organ by which the monogenean attaches itself to the gill of is host. The haptor bears two squamodiscs, one ventral and one dorsal, which are made up of numerous rows of rodlets. The reproductive organ include a single ovary and a single testis. The sclerotized male copulatory organ, or \\"quadriloculate organ\\", has the shape of a bean with four internal chambers, as in other species of Pseudorhabdosynochus. The vagina also includes a sclerotized part, which is a complex structure. The sclerotised vagina comprises an anterior trumpet, followed by a primary canal, a primary chamber, a secondary canal, a secondary chamber and an accessory structure. The trumpet is in continuity with the unsclerotised vagina. The primary canal is thin- walled, with regular diameter and wide lumen, and is coiled once. The primary chamber is heavily sclerotised, and complex in shape: a pear-shaped cavity continued as a heavily sclerotised cylinder arising from its thinner, posterior part; the cylinder curves and runs parallel with the longitudinal axis of the pear-shaped cavity; the cylinder continuous with primary canal. The secondary canal is thin, with an indistinct central lumen. The secondary canal is inserted into the cylinder of the primary chamber. The secondary chamber is continuous with the secondary canal, sclerotised, and elongate, ventral to and much smaller than the primary chamber. The accessory structure is small, inserted into the anterior extremity of the secondary chamber. The external and internal surfaces of the primary and secondary chambers are smooth. Nomenclature and synonyms The famous Japanese parasitologist Satyu Yamaguti described the same species twice, the first time in 1938 Yamaguti, S. 1938: Studies on the helminth fauna of Japan. Part 24. Trematodes of fishes, V. Japanese Journal of Zoology, 8, 15-74.

Publications of the Seto Marine Biological Laboratory, 7, 53-88. Article PDF (as Pseudorhabdosynochus epinepheli Yamaguti, 1958). In both papers, the species was described from parasites collected from the same fish species, the grouper Epinephelus akaara off Japan. According to Kritsky & Beverley-Burton (1986) Kritsky, D. C. & Beverley- Burton, M. 1986: The status of Pseudorhabdosynochus Yamaguti, 1958, and Cycloplectanum Oliver, 1968 (Monogenea: Diplectanidae). Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington, 99, 17-20. PDF , Pseudorhabdosynochus epinepheli Yamaguti, 1958 is a junior synonym of Pseudorhabdosynochus epinepheli (Yamaguti, 1938) Kritsky & Beverley-Burton, 1986 and Pseudorhabdosynochus epinepheli (Yamaguti, 1938) Kritsky & Beverley-Burton, 1986 is the modern valid combination for Diplectanum epinepheli Yamaguti, 1938.

The episode features special guest stars Gloria Estefan as Santana's mother Maribel Lopez, Ken Jeong and Jennifer Coolidge as Brittany's parents Pierce and Whitney Pierce, and Gina Gershon as Blaine's mother Pam Anderson. Plot Whitney Pierce (Jennifer Coolidge) brings Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale), Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), and Santana's mother Maribel Lopez (Gloria Estefan) to a barn in Indiana where she wants Brittany and Santana to be married in, as it was the birthplace of Brittany and because gay marriage is legal in Indiana but not in Ohio. Decorations begin with the help of Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) and Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) but Brittany has wedding jitters as their officiant has cancelled, so Kurt realizes that his father, Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) can officiate. Santana asks Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), and Tina to help pick dresses for herself and Brittany, but Santana breaks tradition by seeing Brittany in her wedding dress which sends Brittany into a superstitious frenzy. While planning a seating chart, Rachel is hesitant about being with Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) as she is unsure if Burt and his wife Carole Hudson (Romy Rosemont) will object, but Mercedes assures her that it will be accepted. Santana flatly refuses to allow Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) to be at the wedding. Kurt tells his friend Walter (Harry Hamlin) that he is going to the wedding with Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss), and Walter gently breaks off their relationship while encouraging Kurt to pursue his true love. Kurt runs to Blaine's home where they confess their mutual love for one another and kiss. Tina tells Artie, Blaine, and Noah \\"Puck\\" Puckerman (Mark Salling) her intentions to propose to Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) even though they have just reunited as friends and are mostly communicating via text messages. She asks for their blessing, which they do, though Artie initially hesitates. Sue tells Santana that she really wants to attend her wedding but Santana again curtly rejects her. At the wedding venue, Burt tells Kurt and Blaine that he had no regrets about going into a second marriage with Carole, and she tells them to seize every moment. Brittany is still in a superstitious frenzy which is only increased when Santana comes in with Brittany in her wedding dress, but Santana calms her down. Sue arrives, having brought Santana's grandmother, Alma Lopez (Ivonne Coll), who she has helped to realize that although Alma may not believe females should marry each other, family is the most important thing, and she asks to attend the wedding. Santana then forgives Sue and allows her to stay. Sue then pulls Blaine and Kurt to a room where there are two wedding tuxedos waiting for them. Brittany explains that Blaine and Kurt's relationship inspired her, and that she would like for them to be married alongside her and Santana, who also supports the idea. After some debate and hesitation, Blaine and Kurt agree to get married in a joint ceremony. Brittany, Santana, Kurt and Blaine have a shared exchange of vows, and both couples are married. After some dancing, Tina privately asks Mike to marry her, but Mike gently turns her down, as he does love her but not in that way. Back at McKinley High, Tina and Artie have lunch together and agree to marry each other if neither one is married by age 30. Sue gives a honeymoon vacation to each of the newlywed couples.

The episode features a flashback from the show's pilot episode that explores the reasons why the original five members of the New Directions glee club decided to join.  Plot The year is 2009, and Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) announces to his wife Terri Schuester (Jessalyn Gilsig) that he is now running the McKinley High glee club. She is not happy about this. Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) is depressed as he starts his second year at McKinley High. Guidance Counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) notices him looking at a pamphlet about suicide, and calls his father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) to the school.

At lunch, Kurt sits at a table with Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), and tells her that he needs to join a club; after finding out that he can sing, she suggests the new glee club. The two of them meet and sing but when Kurt suggests they audition together, Rachel refuses: stars shine separately, and she plans to shine.

He auditions, and tells his father that he has joined the club. Burt is unsure but happy for his son, but Kurt hesitates to tell his dad that he is gay. Rachel tries to befriend Mercedes, and asks to come to her church to hear her sing. When she does, Rachel is worried, and tells Mercedes that she has a great future as a soul singer, but Mercedes tells her that whatever type of music is being sung, Rachel will have to compete with her for it. Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) is rebelling by using a fake stutter to drive most people away, and dressing as a goth. She is friends with Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale), who really likes her as she is the only one at the school who treats him like a regular human being despite his being in a wheelchair. In the cafeteria, a couple of Tina's goth friends dump food on Rachel and Kurt as a dare, and one dares Tina and Artie back to try out for the glee club. They both do, supporting each other, and each is impressed by the other's singing ability. The first meeting of New Directions is a tense one: Will gives the first solo to Artie, but Rachel insists that she should be getting the solos as she has the best voice, a claim immediately disputed by Mercedes. That night, Terri finds Will working on music for the glee club, and she is concerned that Will's commitment to glee club may cause future issues with their marriage, but Will promises to put her first. Rachel is pleased when Will gives her the next solo, but Mercedes is very upset. She is talked out of quitting by her church choir director (April Grace), who urges her to stay, and predicts that competing with Rachel will ultimately make Mercedes a better singer. Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) and Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) praise Sue's leadership of the Cheerios cheerleaders to five consecutive national championships. Sue wonders about the revival of glee club, but Figgins assures her that they are of no concern and that Sue and the Cheerios will always be the center of McKinley High. During her weekly one-on-one basketball game with Will, Sue tells him that it is wrong to encourage the dreams of such young minds, but Will disagrees, and says that glee club could be even more important than cheerleading. Sue gives him an ultimatum: her friendship or the glee club. Will picks the glee club, adding that he just recruited Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith), the quarterback of the football team. Sue is furious. Hearing that Terri is pregnant and that Will may be leaving as glee club director to become an accountant, Rachel goes to see Terri to convince her that Will needs to stay at McKinley. Terri is not persuaded in the least. Mercedes and Kurt are having issues with Finn, which they talk over at a coffee shop, where Mercedes has a chance encounter with Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss). Artie, Kurt, Mercedes, Rachel, and Tina meet on whether or not to kick out Finn, but they realize that he belongs in glee club as much as they do, and they unanimously vote to keep him in. Emma begs Figgins to give Will a raise so that he can stay on as glee club coach, but Figgins instead finds an old video of Will competing in a glee club championship, which Emma shows to Will. Sue congratulates Will on his departure from teaching, but as he is leaving, he hears the sound of the glee club singing \\"Don't Stop Believin' in the auditorium, and he stays to watch them. Production Although this was the twelfth episode aired in the sixth season, it was the ninth episode to be produced. It was initially announced as airing ninth, set for February 27, 2015, but was rescheduled as part of the finale. The episode was written by the show's three co-creators, Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan, and directed by Paris Barclay, who described it as the \\"most unusual episode of Glee I have ever directed\\". The episode was filmed in early December 2014. The filmed material is supplemented by the inclusion of the entire original performance of \\"Don't Stop Believin from Glee pilot episode, which features Cory Monteith and Lea Michele on lead vocals. Recurring characters appearing in this episode include new McKinley High glee club member Tina Cohen-Chang (Ushkowitz), students Noah \\"Puck\\" Puckerman (Salling), Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) and Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton), guidance counsellor Emma Pillsbury (Mays), Principal Figgins (Theba), Will's wife Terri Schuester (Gilsig), Kurt's father Burt Hummel (O'Malley) and Terri's co-worker Howard Bamboo (Kent Avenido). New characters introduced for this episode were April Grace as Mercedes' church choir director and Bex Taylor-Klaus as a goth student. Natalija Nogulich, while given a guest star credit, does not appear in the broadcast episode. Five of the six songs from the episode have been released on a digital five-track EP with the title Glee: The Music, 2009. These are: \\"Popular\\" from the musical Wicked sung by Michele and Colfer, Zella Jackson Price's \\"I'm His Child\\" performed by Riley, Katy Perry's \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" sung by Ushkowitz, Ginuwine's \\"Pony\\" performed by McHale, and Journey's \\"Don't Stop Believin' in the original version from the pilot episode of the series. The sixth song, \\"Mister Cellophane\\" from the musical Chicago sung by Colfer, is not on the EP. Reception =Ratings= The episode was broadcast an hour earlier than the show's usual Friday timeslot, with the second episode and series finale airing in that usual timeslot. \\"2009\\" received a season high 0.8/3 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic and attracted 2.69 million American viewers during its initial broadcast. Its ratings and viewership were higher than the final episode of the series, \\"Dreams Come True\\", which aired immediately after and was watched by 2.54 million viewers and received a 0.7/2 rating/share. =Critical response= Andy Swift of TVLine wrote that the episode \\"tackled flawlessly\\" the \\"tricky\\" task of doing a flashback to the year 2009 without Cory Monteith, who had played Finn Hudson until his death in 2013, both in alluding to \\"iconic moments\\" in the pilot and by mentioning Finn at a number of points in the dialogue. He described the inclusion of the \\"Don't Stop Believin footage from pilot as \\"absolutely gut wrenching in every sense of the word\\". Time James Poniewozik wrote that it was an \\"ingenious move\\" to make the episode \\"essentially an alternative version\\" of the Glee pilot, which had been \\"one of the best TV pilots of the last decade\\". He called the episode \\"sweet and nostalgic and tearjerking\\".

The set V of vertices of the graph is fixed, but the set E of edges can change. The three cases, in order of difficulty, are: * Edges are only added to the graph (this can be called incremental connectivity); * Edges are only deleted from the graph (this can be called decremental connectivity); * Edges can be either added or deleted (this can be called fully dynamic connectivity). After each addition/deletion of an edge, the dynamic connectivity structure should adapt itself such that it can give quick answers to queries of the form \\"is there a path between x and y?\\" (equivalently: \\"do vertices x and y belong to the same connected component?\\").  Incremental connectivity  If edges can only be added, then the dynamic connectivity problem can be solved by a Disjoint-set data structure. Each set represents a connected component; there is a path between x and y if and only if they belong to the same set. The amortized time per operation is \\\\Theta(\\\\alpha(n)), where n is the number of vertices and Œ± is the inverse Ackermann function.  Decremental connectivity  The case in which edges can only be deleted was solved by Shimon Even and Yossi Shiloach. The structure uses a table that specifies, for each vertex, the name of the component to which it belongs. Thus a connectivity query takes constant time. The challenge is to update the table when an edge is deleted. = Acyclic graphs (forests) = When edge u-v is deleted in a forest, the tree containing that edge is broken to two trees: one of them contains u and the other contains v. The table is updated in the following way. * Scan the tree starting from u (using any tree scan algorithm, such as DFS). * Scan the tree starting from v. * Do the above two procedures in parallel, i.e., either using two parallel processes, or by interleaving their steps (make a step of first scan, then a step of the second scan, then a step of the first scan, etc.). * Suppose the first scan that terminates is the scan from u (so we know that the tree containing u is the smaller one). Assign a new component name to every node in the subtree of u. Since we always rename the smaller sub-component, the amortized time for a delete operation is O(\\\\log(n)). = General graphs = When an edge is deleted in a general graph, we don't know whether its component remains a single component (connected by other edges) or broken to two components. So we use two processes which run in parallel (or in an interleaved way). Process A checks whether the edge deletion breaks a component, and if it does, both processes halt. Process B checks whether the edge deletion does not break the component to which it belongs, and if it does not, again both processes halt. ;Process A: is similar to the acyclic-graph case: there are two sub-processes who scan from both ends of the deleted edge. If one of the sub-processes finishes before reaching the other end, this means that the component is broken into two sub-components, and the name of the smaller sub-component is updated, as before. Thus the amortized time for a delete operation is again O(\\\\log(n)). ;Process B: uses a breadth-first structure (BFS), which is initialized as follows. A vertex r is chosen and the BFS starts from it. The only vertex in level 0 is r. All the vertices of distance i from the root are in level i. If G is not connected, a new scan is started at some unscanned vertex v, v is put in level 1, and an artificial edge connects v to the root r; all vertices of distance i from v are now in level i+1, etc. Artificial edges are introduced in order to keep all the connected components in one BFS structure and are used only for this purpose. Clearly, the artificial edges are used only in process B. The structure has the following properties. A vertex v in level i, i>0, has only three types of edges: backward edges which connect it to level i‚àí1 (there is at least one such edge, which may be artificial), local edges which connect it to other edges in level i (there are zero or more such edges), or forward edges which connect it to edges in level i+1 (there are zero or more such edges). So for each vertex v, we maintain three sets of edges (backward, local and forward). When an edge u-v is deleted, there are two options: either u and v are in the same level, or they are in levels whose number differs by 1. ;Case 1: both u and v are on the same level. In this case, the edge deletion cannot change the components. The edge is simply deleted from the sets of local edges of u and v, and process B halts (and therefore process A is halted too). Our BFS structure is still valid. ;Case 2: u and v are on different levels. Without loss of generality, assume u is in level i‚àí1 and v is in level i; hence the edge should be removed from forward(u) and from backward(v). :;Case 2.1: If the new backward(v) is not empty, then the components have not changed: there are other edges which connect v backwards. Process B halts (and process A is halted too). :;Case 2.2: If the new backward(v) is empty, then v is no longer connected to level i‚àí1, and so its distance from the root is no longer i; it must be at least i+1. Additionally, there may be other vertices, connected to v, whose distance from the root increases as a result of the deletion. To calculate the updated distances, we use a queue Q, which initially contains only the vertex v. While Q is not empty: # w := dequeue(Q) # Remove w from its level (say, j), and put it in the next level (j+1). # Update local neighbours: #* For each edge w‚àíx in local(w), remove it from local(x) and put it in forward(x). #* backward(w) := local(w) # Update forward neighbours: #* For each edge w-x in forward(w), remove it from backward(x) and put it in local(x); if the new backward(x) is empty, enqueue x on Q. #* local(w) := forward(w) #* forward(w) := empty set # If the new backward(w) is empty, enqueue w again on Q. If the edge deletion does not break any component and we are in case 2.2, then eventually the procedure will halt. In this case it is easy to see that the BFS structure is maintained correctly. If its deletion does break a component, then the procedure will not halt by itself. However, process A, recognizing the break, will halt, and both processes will halt. In this case all the changes made in the BFS structure are ignored, and we go back to the BFS structure we had just before the deletion, except that the deleted edge is now replaced by an artificial edge. Clearly, in this case v is now the root of a tree which includes the new component, and perhaps additional components, through some other artificial edges. Also, there are no edges connecting the descendants of with any vertices which are not 's descendants, except the artificial edge .One way to realize the return to the structure preceding the deletion of e without having to copy the whole structure is to keep on a stack all the changes that took place in the BFS structure since the deletion of e and undo them one by one. This way the processing time is only multiplied by a constant. whenever an edge is processed in the procedure, one of its endpoints drops by one level. Since the lowest level a vertex can reach in runs which are terminated by process B is V-1, the cost per edge is bounded by 2V. Hence the amortized time per deletion operation is O(n).  Fully dynamic connectivity  = Acyclic graphs (forests) = A forest can be represented using a collection of either Link-cut trees or Euler tour trees. Then the dynamic connectivity problem can be solved easily, as for every two nodes x,y, x is connected to y if and only if FindRoot(x)=FindRoot(y). The amortized update time and query time are both O(log(n)). = General graphs = A general graph can be represented by its spanning forest - a forest which contains a tree for every connected component of the graph. We call this spanning forest F. F itself can be represented by a forest of Euler tour trees. The Query and Insert operations are implemented using the corresponding operations on the ET trees representing F. The challenging operation is Delete, and in particular, deleting an edge which is contained in one of the spanning trees of F. This breaks the spanning tree into two trees, but, it is possible that there is another edge which connects them. The challenge is to quickly find such a replacement edge, if it exists. This requires a more complex data structure. Several such structures are described below.  The Level structure  Each edge in the graph is assigned a level. Let L=lg n. The level of each edge inserted to the graph is initialized to L, and may decrease towards 0 during delete operations. For each i between 0 and L, define Gi as the subgraph consisting of edges that are at level i or less, and Fi a spanning forest of Gi. Our forest F from before is now called FL. We will keep a decreasing sequence of forests FL ‚äá ... ‚äá F0. Dynamic Graph Problems - in Lecture Notes in Advanced Data Structures. Prof. Erik Demaine; Scribe: Katherine Lai. = Operations = The Query and Insert operations use only the largest forest FL. The smaller subgraphs are consulted only during a Delete operation, and in particular, deleting an edge which is contained in one of the spanning trees of FL. When such an edge e = x‚àíy is deleted, it is first removed from FL and from all smaller spanning forests to which it belongs, i.e. from every Fi with i ‚â• level(e). Then we look for a replacement edge. Start with the smallest spanning forest which contained e, namely, Fi with i = level(e). The edge e belongs to a certain tree T‚äÜFi. After the deletion of e, the tree T is broken to two smaller trees: Tx which contains the node x and Ty which contains the node y. An edge of Gi is a replacement edge, if and only if it connects a node in Tx with a node in Ty. Suppose wlog that Tx is the smaller tree (i.e. contains at most half the nodes of T; we can tell the size of each subtree by an annotation added to the Euler trees). We loop over all the edges Œµ with level i and at least one node in Tx: * If the other node of Œµ is in Ty, then a replacement edge is found! Add this edge to Fi and to all containing forests up to FL, and finish. The spanning forests are fixed. * If the other node of Œµ is in Tx, then this is not a replacement edge, and to 'penalize' it for wasting our time, we decrease its level by 1. = Analysis = The level of each edge will be decreased at most lg n times. Why? Because with each decrease, it falls into a tree whose size is at most half the size of its tree in the previous level. So in each level i, the number of nodes in each connected component is at most 2i. Hence the level of an edge is always at least 0. Each edge whose level is decreased, takes O(\\\\lg n) time to find (using the ET tree operations). In total, each inserted edge takes O(\\\\lg^2 n) time until it is deleted, so the amortized time for deletion is O(\\\\lg^2 n). The remaining part of delete also takes O(\\\\lg^2 n) time, since we have to delete the edge from at most O(\\\\lg n) levels, and deleting from each level takes O(\\\\lg n) (again using the ET operations). In total, the amortized time per update is O(\\\\lg^2 n). The time per query can be improved to O(\\\\lg n / \\\\lg \\\\lg n). However, the worst-case time per update might be O(n). The question of whether the worst-case time can be improved had been an open question, until it was solved in the affirmative by the Cutset structure.  The Cutset structure  Given a graph G(V,E) and a subset T‚äÜV, define cutset(T) as the set of edges that connect T with V\\\\T. The cutset structure is a data structure that, without keeping the entire graph in memory, can quickly find an edge in the cutset, if such an edge exists. Start by giving a number to each vertex. Suppose there are n vertices; then each vertex can be represented by a number with lg(n) bits. Next, give a number to each edge, which is a concatenation of the numbers of its vertices - a number with 2 lg(n) bits. For each vertex v, calculate and keep xor(v), which is the xor of the numbers of all edges adjacent to it. Now for each subset T‚äÜV, it is possible to calculate xor(T) = the xor of the values of all vertices in T. Consider an edge e = u‚àív which is an internal edge of T (i.e. both u and v are in T). The number of e is included twice in xor(T) - once for u and once for v. Since the xor of every number with itself is 0, e vanishes and does not affect xor(T). Thus, xor(T) is actually the xor of all edges in cutset(T). There are several options: * If xor(T)=0, then we can confidently reply that cutset(T) is empty. * If xor(T) is the number of a real edge e, then probably e is the only edge in cutset(T), and we can return e. We can also read the endpoints of e from the number of e by splitting it to the lg(n) leftmost bits and the lg(n) rightmost bits. * The third option is that xor(T) is a nonzero number which does not represent a real edge. This can only happen if there are two or more edges in cutset(T), since in that case xor(T) is the xor of several numbers of edges. In this case, we report \\"failure\\", since we know that there are edges in the cutset but cannot identify any single edge. There is a small probability that the xor of several different edges will result in a number which happens to be the number of another edge. This might lead to a false positive. In order to reduce the probability of this event, we can enlarge the domain of the numbers of vertices to, say, n3 instead of n. Then, if there is more than one edge in cutset(T), xor(T) will almost certainly be a meaningless value, as stated above. Our goal now is to handle this third option. First, create a sequence of lg(n) levels of the cutset structures, each of which contains about half the edges from the upper level (i.e., for each level, pick each edge from the upper level with probability 1/2). If in the first level xor(T) returns an illegal value, meaning that cutset(T) has two or more edges, then there is a chance that in the next level, which contains fewer edges, xor(T) will return a legal value since cutset(T) will contain a single edge. If xor(T) still returns an illegal value, continue to the next level, etc. Since the number of edges is decreasing, there are two cases: * The good case is that we eventually find a level in which cutset(T) contains a single edge; then we return that edge and finish. * The bad case is that we eventually find a level in which cutset(T) contains no edges; then we report \\"failure\\", since we know that there are edges in the cutset but cannot identify any single edge. It is possible to prove that the probability of success is at least 1/9. Next, create a collection of C lg(n) independent versions of the level structure, where C is a constant. In each versions, do an independent random reduction of edges from level to level. Try each query on each of the versions until one of them succeeds. The probability that all versions fail is at most: :(1-1/9)^{C \\\\lg{n}} = 2^{- 0.17C \\\\lg{n}} = n^{-0.17 C} By proper selection of C we can make the probability of failure arbitrarily close to 0. = Operations = We can add a cutset structure to a dynamic connectivity structure. The Insert and Delete operations on the cutset structure are done in exactly the same way: the edge inserted/deleted is XORed into both its endpoints. When an edge is deleted from the spanning forest used for the dynamic connectivity structure, the cutset structure is used to find a replacement edge. = Analysis = A single cutset structure requires only O(n lg n) memory - only a single number, with 2 lg n bits, for each of the n vertices. We don't have to keep the edges themselves. For dense graphs, this is much cheaper than keeping the entire graph in memory. We have to keep lg(n) versions, each of which contains lg(n) levels. Hence, the total memory requirement is . The query time is O(polylog(n)) in the worst case. This is in contrast to The Level structure, in which the query time is O(polylog(n)) amortized, but the worst-case time is O(n). = Offline Dynamic Connectivity = If the order in which edges will be deleted is known ahead of time, then we can solve the dynamic connectivity problem in log(n) per query. If we can maintain a Maximum Spanning Forest where edges are ordered by their deletion time, we know that when we delete some edge that is in the forest, there is no possible edge that can replace it. If there were some edge that connects the same two components the deleted edge does, then this other edge would have been part of the maximum spanning forest instead of the edge we deleted. This makes the delete operation trivial: we simply need to split the tree into its two parts if the edge to delete is part of our forest, or ignore the operation otherwise. Adding an edge is slightly more complicated. If we add an edge edge e from u to v, then if u and v are not connected, then this edge will be part of the Maximum Spanning Forest. If they are connected, we want to add u->v to our forest if it can improve our Maximum Spanning Forest. To do this, we need to quickly check what edge has the smallest removal time on the path from u to v. If this edge's removal time comes after e's removal time, then e cannot improve our minimum spanning forest. Otherwise, the other edge should be deleted and replaced with e. This requires us to do the following operations: add an edge, cut an edge, and query the minimum edge on a path which can be done rather easily with a link-cut tree in log(n) per operation.

Nadel qualified as a barrister and was called to The Bar (Middle Temple) in 1996 before turning to journalism. After a year at the American network ABC News' London bureau she moved to the BBC where she reported for national television and radio. Nadel was a lobby correspondent for the BBC's Parliamentary Unit. In 1991 Nadel moved to ITV, working first for Channel Four News before becoming ITN's Home Affairs Correspondent in 1991. In this post her special investigations contributed to a number of miscarriages of justice being re- opened and exposed the use of rape as a weapon of war in Bosnia. In 1994 she became ITN's Home Affairs editor heading a bureau of specialist reporters and producers, a post she held until 1999. In 1997, Nadel's interview with Lord Woolf at the third Woman Lawyer conference led to him conceding consideration of fast track measures for women to address gender imbalances at the bar. Alongside her journalism career, Nadel has published both novels and non- fiction. Nadel's acclaimed non-fiction book about the Sara Thornton case, Sara Thornton: The Story of a Woman Who Killed, was published in 1993. The book highlighted the ways in which the legal system discriminates against victims of domestic violence and was subsequently adapted into a film, Killing Me Softly, which aired on BBC1 in 1996. Nadel's first novel, Pretty Thing, was published in 2015. Her writing has appeared in many of the UK's national newspapers. Her most recent book - WE : A Manifesto For Women Everywhere, written in collaboration with actress Gillian Anderson, was published by HC in the UK and Atria in the United States, as well as in a number of other countries. Nadel has contested several elections at local and national level as a candidate for the Green Party. In 2014, she stood in the Bryanston and Dorset Square ward on Westminster City Council, coming seventh (representing the third-placed party after the Conservative and Labour candidates). In the general election of 2015, she stood as a parliamentary candidate for Westminster North, coming fifth. In the 2017 election, she was a candidate in neighbouring Kensington, when she came fourth. In the 2016 London Assembly election, Nadel stood in West Central, finishing in third place. She is a trustee of the charity Inquest which supports families whose relatives have died in custody.  Compassion in Politics  In 2018, Nadel co-founded the campaign group Compassion in Politics with her colleague Matt Hawkins. The group launched in October of that year with the stated aim of \\"putting compassion, cooperation, and empathy at the heart of politics.\\" The group has grown to have the support of over 50 parliamentarians from six parties and of academics and activists including Noam Chomsky, Cerys Matthews, Helen Pankhurst, and Ruby Wax. In 2019 the Guardian described Compassion in Politics as \\"the movement to be hopeful about.\\" The campaign divides its work between reforming parliamentary systems so they encourage greater compassion and developing policy proposals built on the value of compassion and inclusion. In relation to the former the group launched a new voluntary code of conduct with More United which has so far been signed by over 100 parliamentarians. During the 2019 general election the group created the #StopTheNastiness pledge which asked candidates to campaign with respect and compassion. Notable signatories included Sir Keir Starmer, Yasmin Qureshi, Caroline Lucas, and Penny Mordaunt. They also founded and launched a new All Party Group for Compassionate Politics Co-Chaired by Debbie Abrahams and Baroness Warsi. In terms of developing policy proposals the group has focused its efforts on a new \\"Compassion Act\\" which would make it illegal for future governments to introduce legislation that would push anyone into destitution. Nadel is a regular contributor to the Metro, The Independent and The Huffington Post. She has also written about the campaign in the Guardian and appeared on the Moral Maze, Sky News, 5Live, and BBC Scotland.

Biography Mora practiced gymnastics in his childhood and youth. He currently lives in Catalonia. Career He first studied medicine at the University of Barcelona, where he studied from 1984 to 1990. In 1991 he joined the \\"Hospital General de Granollers\\" and in 1992 he joined the \\"Hospital Universitario Valle de Hebr√≥n\\", where he became a pediatrician. In 1995 he joined the Medicine School in the Autonomous University of Barcelona, in order to obtain his PhD in 2003. As part of his training, in 1996 he joined the Cornell University Hospital where he specialized in pediatric cancer at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Mora is currently Director of the Research Laboratory of Tumor Development and Chief of Pediatric Oncology in the Hospital Sant Joan de D√©u Barcelona .  Medical Perspective  For Mora, pediatric oncology's treatments require a constant awareness accompanied by a certain degree of firmness. He has mentioned, repeatedly, that he does not feel gratified with the treatment's result but the process and personalized therapy of each patient. The work and research that he has developed concerning the feasible treatments for cancer have shown that his medical perspective relating to the responsibility of the patient's family, the oncologist and the patient himself have been influenced by commitment, generosity and family strength. The way he conceives the disease differs from other medical perspectives. For J. Mora, Childhood cancer is better referred to as Developmental cancer. Under this 'Developmental cancer' concept, he refers to an age factor, broadened to include patients up to 25 years old, and also refers to the point in a given patient's development when the cancer might appear. He has established that childhood cancer is a misnomer and that it must be replaced by ‚ÄúDevelopmental cancer‚Äù. For Mora, Developmental cancer is a type of disease that has nothing to do with cancer in adults; he mentions that it is a mistake to compare them because childhood tumors are due to developmental growth only and have nothing to do with external agents.http://www.fsjd.org/es/-la-investigaci√≥n-debe-estar-al-lado-del- paciente-para-mejorar-nuestra-capacidad-de-pronosticar-diagnosticar-y-aplicar- tratamientos-_49015 Medical Contributions Mora coordinates a group of specialists who research developmental cancer. They have generated the complete sequencing of the Ewing's sarcoma‚Äôs genome. In the neuroblastoma, they have gained the ability to predict the tumor‚Äôs behavior, and have developed an active plan that will allow the patient a specific therapy.Mora, Jaume, Muzaffar Akram, and William L. Gerard.\\"Comparison of Normal and Tumor Cells by Laser Campture Microdisection\\" Methods in Enzymology Academic Press 2002 Similarly, they are the first group of researchers to design an animal model of a tumor in the brain stem and have developed a passive treatment without radiation therapy, which can cure gliomas from the spinal cord.Mora Graupera, Jaume. \\"Documentaci√≥n y archivo del ensayo\\" chapter 33 MediPharm. Tratado de medicinia Farmac√©utica. Editorial M√©dica Panamericana, 2010 In the summer of 2014 they managed to operate a previously inoperable tumor because of its location. The operation was complemented with Mora‚Äôs technology and his team printed a tumor model using a 3D printer, allowing them to practice until they were ready to operate on the patient. Personal Success Mora establishes that his group of researchers‚Äô success is due to the relationship between the 'laboratory-family', who are still involved with the institution even after the patient's treatment has finished, as that encourages group work and personal passion towards work. Mora mentions that the ‚Äúlaboratory cannot be far away from the patient‚Äù, and to ensure a relationship influenced by trust and support as the respective treatments are carried out because at the end of the therapies, all the support received by the patient's family is reflected in financial contributions that enable further research.

The fort was built approximately in 1660 A.D. According to a number of historians, the river fort was built by Mir Jumla II, a Subahdar of Bengal under the Mughal Empire, to establish the control of Mughal Empire in Munsiganj, and to defend Dhaka and Narayanganj from the pirates. The fort was a part of the triangular defence strategy for the vulnerable river route, from where the pirates used to attack Dhaka. The strategy was developed by Mir Jumla II with the help of the other two forts in Narayanganj- the Hajiganj Fort and the Sonakanda Fort. Background Entrance to the fort Mughals took over the control of the Bengal in 1574 AD after defeating Daud Khan Karrani. Mughals exercised a progressive rule in Bengal. Bengal was then a very wealthy province and was frequently attacked by the pirates. The Mughal Empire was then locked into a civil war regarding the succession of Emperor Shah Jahan. Shah Shuja, the second son of Shah Jahan and the Subahdar of Bengal, led a campaign to Agra to take over the throne. Aurangzeb, after his accession to the throne wanted to appoint a man with high skills in naval warfare as the river-oriented Bengal was the strong hold of Shah Shuja. So he entrusted Mir Muhammad Saeed Ardestani alias Mir Jumla II who was a successful trader in maritime trades in first life, to deal with Shah Shuja. Mir Jumla II rushed to the Bengal compelling Shah Shuja to retreat. Later, Mir Jumla II was appointed as the Subahdar or the governor of the then Bengal province in 1660. Mir Jumla was aware of the pirates who used to run a campaign of terror in the important cities of Bengal. After his appointment as the Subahdar, he shifted the capital of Bengal to Dhaka from Rajmahal. In a quest to protect the capital Dhaka from the pirates, Mir Jumla II developed a triangular defence strategy and decided to build up three river forts near Dhaka. One of these three forts is Idrakpur Fort of Munshiganj. History Idrakpur, now Munshiganj was a strategically very significant point as it was the junction of a number of rivers including Meghna River, Shitalakshya River, Ichhamati River and Dhaleshwari River. The fort was built on the bank of the junction of Ichhamati River and Meghna River. The Portuguese and Magh pirates used this point to move forward to Dhaka through Shitalakshya River. On their way to Dhaka they used to loot other important cities like Sonargaon and Bikrampur. Mir Jumla II was determined to protect Dhaka and eager to develop the wealthy area Bikrampur. So, he came up with a triangular defence strategy to protect the cities from the Portuguese pirates. Idrakpur Fort was the centre of his strategy. The erection of the fort was intended to check the advance of the Magh and Portuguese pirates proceeding towards the Mughal capital city of Dhaka. The fort was also used as the naval base of the naval fleet of 200 frigates under Mughal admiral Abul Hossain. According to the strategy, whenever the pirates made an attempt to advance to Dhaka the Mughal soldiers would be ordered to start firing mortars both from the cannons of their 200 battleships and from the Idrakpur Fort leaving the pirates with no options but to retreat or die on the rivers. However, if any of the pirate ships survived the initial attack and tried to advance to Dhaka the Sonakanda Fort and the Hajiganj Fort, situated on the eastern and western bank of Shitalakshya River respectively, would start throwing round-shots to those ships and vessels and sink all the pirate ships on the river. It was probably built in about 1660 A.D. Architecture Idrakpur river-fort is different from the other Mughal forts and has a number of unique features. The fort is apparently divided into two parts- the eastern part and the western part. The quadrangular eastern part and the polygonal western part combined into the complete fort. The brick built fort comprises a wider open area surrounded by wall with bastions at the angles. The thick wall runs from north to south measuring 86.87-meter in length and 59.60-meter in width. The wall has machicolations from where the enemies on the river was targeted and the mortars were fired. There are a number of towers from where the movement of the enemies were observed. The most significant feature of the fort is the circular drum it has in the eastern part of the fort. The circular drum is further enclosed by another fortification wall, which was used for mounting a huge cannon. The elevated circular drum of 32.5-meter in diameter and 9.14-meter high and can be reached by a staircase. The drum comprises three subsequent layers. Another remarkable feature of the fort is the existence of a staircase leading to a secret room at the foot of the drum. The staircase leads to a secret underground chamber which was the magazine or storehouse for arms and explosives.

It was designed to allow donators to see who was receiving the donations, and collects donations by throwing lavish parties, where attendees can buy tickets and see videos of the families to whom they are donating. As of October 1, 2014, the Foundation has raised over $600,000 for 77 families, and has been sponsored and recognized for its philanthropic efforts. Kaufman also received recognition for creating it, receiving an award from the Houston Astros called the \\"Hometown Hero.\\" History The Fanatical Change Foundation first began as a charitable organization for families who have faced tragedies when it was founded by businessman Steven Kaufman in 2008 in response to the 2008 Hurricane Ike. Another reason cited for its creation by Kaufman was a desire to create a charity where donators could fully understand who was receiving the donations. He felt that it filled a niche that other charities typically didn't fill, which lead to the charity model the Fanatical Change Foundation uses today. He is currently the organization's President. As of October 1, 2014, the foundation has raised more than $600,000 for 77 different families in need in the Houston area. The Fanatical Change Foundation's website features multiple stories of people who went through tragedy and were helped by the organization. Some of the families helped by them include the family of Tony Blocker, who died after being pulled under by a rough surf, and the family of Markese Donahue, who was killed by a gun shot to the chest during a dispute. The Fanatical Change Foundation is a 501(c)3 charity, meaning that it is federally approved and a recognized charity under the Internal Revenue Service in the United States. =Fundraising events= Every year, the Fanatical Change Foundation hosts parties to raise money for needy families. In 2009, the organization hosted an event called \\"Keep the Change\\" where they gave money earned from the event to three families in need. It hosted a Halloween party called the \\"Hollywood Halloween: Cocktails & Costumes for a Change\\" in 2014. Attendees were able to view videos of the families who are receiving the donations. The event was hosted at the Diamond Club in Minute Maid Park. The event featured live music, costumes, cocktails, hors d'oeuvres, and auctions for attendants to enjoy. Recognition The Fanatical Change Foundation has received attention and praise for its philanthropic efforts. Its events have been sponsored by a variety of different companies, including ServerMonkey, a provider of new and used IT hardware. The foundation's 2014 Halloween party was included in a list of the best Houston Halloween parties by the NU Home Source Realty company. It was recognized by Lifestyles Unlimited International for its \\"intimacy in charitable giving\\" due to its more direct approach to helping those in need. Steven Kaufman was given multiple awards for his work on his mortgage firm Zeus Mortgage and for his philanthropic work with the Fanatical Change Foundation. Particularly, he was included in the Houston Business Journal's \\"40 Under 40\\" list (which honors mortgage professionals under the age of 40) and by the Houston Astros as a \\"Hometown Hero\\" for his work with the Fanatical Change Foundation.

It was the work of the sculptor Guillaume J√©z√©quel except for the crucifix which was the work of the sculptor Yves Hernot de Lannion and was remounted on the calvary in 1896. Kergrist-Mo√´lou is located in the C√¥tes-d'Armor region, the ancient diocese of Cornouaille. J√©z√©quel had worked alongside his brother on the Kergrist-Mo√´lou church in 1554. Originally the calvary's sculpture was substantial, with records showing that it was decorated with almost one hundred statues telling the story of the life and death of Jesus Christ, but sadly the calvary was vandalized during the 1793 French Revolution leaving many statues broken and decapitated with others disappearing completely. What is now left of the calvary stands on a large octagonal granite base and fragments of the mutilated figures are placed around the cross itself. This article gives some of the history of the calvary and describes its constituent parts. Brief history The Notre-Dame church at Kergrist-Mo√´lou dates back to the early 16th Century and was built by the brothers Guillaume and Pierre J√©z√©quel. The calvary dates to 1578 and the sculptural work involved is attributed to Guillaume J√©z√©quel. It was commissioned by the Baron de Pont-l'Abb√© to celebrate the recovery of his daughter who was dying but recovered after he had made a pilgrimage to Kergrist to pray for help. In style the calvary is thought to have been inspired by that at Plougonven. It stands in the churchyard and there is an inscription on the west face reading \\"EN L AN 1578 G. JEZEQUEL.\\" It was restored in the 19th Century but the original order in which the pieces had been arranged was not kept to. The 1922 restoration was carried out after the calvary was declared a \\"Monument Historique\\" in 1921, becoming the only calvary in C√¥tes d'Armor to be given such protection. and another restoration was carried out in 1960. In the Breton language \\"Kergrist\\" means the \\"village of Christ\\". Several of the statues that survived the 1793 attack are arranged on the upper surface of the pedestal and the others stand on a ledge which runs around the pedestal's lower part. Statues on the calvary's upper surface On the upper surface we have a depiction of a Jew thought to have been part of the original scene depicting Jesus appearing before Pontius Pilate and a man on a horse which was probably part of the original scene showing the procession involving Jesus carrying the cross to Golgotha. The horse on which the cavalier is sitting has lost part of its legs. We then have a statue depicting Saint Veronica but this is broken and faces the wrong way around, a statue of John the Evangelist of which the head is broken and a seated Saint Yves which has also suffered damage. Then comes a statue of the Virgin Mary with two devils one of which is the devil of the temptation of Eve. Next is a scene depicting the resurrection although Jesus has lost his head. He is stepping from the tomb and is surrounded by two sleeping soldiers. We also have a scene showing the mouth of hell and the descent into limbo and a depiction of the Virgin Mary with child accompanied by one magi. Statues on the calvary's lower ledge On the lower surface we have a depictions of the Virgin of the Annunciation next to Mary Magdalene in tears. This is followed by depictions of Jesus carrying of the cross. Jesus is brought to his knees by the weight of the cross and is accompanied by two soldiers. Next we see a scene showing Jesus being crowned with a crown of thorns, Pontius Pilate washing his hands, his servant holding a bowl of water and the flagellation. Next is another scene showing Christ being crowned with a crown of thorns but of a more recent vintage. There is then a depiction of Saint Peter with sword and the arrest of Jesus. Next is the \\"mise au tombeau\\", this attended by six people. Nicodemus stands at Jesus' head but there is no statue of Joseph of Arimathea at Jesus' feet. Jesus is laying on a shroud with fringed edges that forms a semi- circle. Finally we have a scene depicting Jesus in discussion with the two lawyers, although Jesus' figure is missing. the Flight into Egypt and a scene depicting the Nativity of Jesus. In the nativity scene the Virgin Mary has lost her head whilst Joseph is shown kneeling behind the ass and the cow. A winged angel, a shepherd and two magi surround the child Jesus who is shown as a boy rather than a new-born baby. On the lower level we see Pontius Pilate washing his hands whilst a servant stands to his right with a bowl of water. Then we see what would have been part of the flagellation scene with Jesus, his feet bound and tied to a column, although Jesus has lost his head. Then we see a scene showing Jesus being crowned with thorns. To the left of Pontius Pilate, Jesus stands held by two soldiers and wearing the crown of thorns and before that we see the group including Jesus carrying the cross. On the upper surface and to the left we see the cavalier riding a horse which has lost most of its legs and on the far right the Angel of the Annunciaton Views of the Kergrist-Mo√´lou calvary Sculpture depicting the nativity on the calvary's north face. Jesus lies between two magi whilst the heads of two cattle loom above him Saint John is comforting the Virgin Mary On the lower level left we see Jesus having the crown of thorns pushed onto his head. Next we see Saint Peter putting his sword back in its sheath whilst to his right are the remains of the scene which depicted Peter removing Malchus' ear and Jesus' arrest after betrayal by Judas, who stands clutching his purse. The damage to the group between Peter and Judas is very bad and the sculpture is difficult to interpret. On the upper level we see the horned devil on the right of the statue of a female saint. On her left are the two figures without heads one of whom was thought to be Saint Yves View of Kergrist-Moelou calvary. On the upper level we see the cavalier on horseback. The horse's legs are broken. To his left are two headless figures. On the lower level and from left to right we see the nativity, then Mary Magdalene in tears before the Virgin Mary whose hands are raised in blessing, followed by the group en route to Golgotha, Jesus shown carrying the cross Recommended reading \\"Sculpteurs sur pierre en Basse-Bretagne.

He was one of the last surviving British Army officers to have served with the 6th Airborne Division in Operation Mallard on 6 June 1944 and in Operation Varsity on 24 March 1945. He later commanded the Ugandan Army. Early life and Second World War John Tillett was born in Ipswich, Suffolk, on 4 November 1919, just under a year after the end of the First World War. His father, Major A. R. Tillett, served with the Suffolk Hussars. He was educated at Ipswich School and went to Germany on a school hockey tour in 1936, where he encountered the Hitler Youth organisation, which made him an honorary member. In Germany, he saw army manoeuvres in the Harz mountains which convinced him that war was approaching and he enlisted in the 4th/5th Battalion, Suffolk Regiment, a Territorial Army (TA) unit serving as part of the 54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division, in 1937. However, Tillett was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (Ox and Bucks) on 24 August 1940, eleven months after the Second World War began, and was given the service number of 145422. He was posted to the 2nd Battalion, Ox and Bucks (also known as the 52nd), which had recently returned from India. The battalion formed part of the 31st Independent Brigade Group, which in December 1941 was converted into the 1st Airlanding Brigade. The brigade, comprising the 1st Battalions of the Royal Ulster Rifles and the Border Regiment and the 2nd Battalions of the South Staffordshire Regiment and Ox and Bucks, commanded by Brigadier George Hopkinson, was now part of the 1st Airborne Division, commanded by Major General Frederick Browning. The battalion was now part of the British Army's expanding airborne forces and underwent training as a glider infantry unit. Transferring from the 1st Airlanding Brigade, alongside the 1st Ulster Rifles, to help form the newly created 6th Airlanding Brigade, under Brigadier Hugh Kindersley, which itself was one of three brigades of Major General Richard Gale's 6th Airborne Division, the battalion spent many months in training for the eventual Allied invasion of Normandy, in which it would play a leading role. =Normandy= He became adjutant of the 2nd Ox and Bucks early in 1944 and was closely involved in the planning of the coup de main operation, led by Major John Howard, Officer Commanding (OC) of the battalion's D Company to capture two vital bridges: Pegasus Bridge and Horsa Bridge in the opening minutes of D-Day. On 6 June 1944, Tillett's glider, piloted by glider pilots from the Glider Pilot Regiment, landed near Ranville, Normandy, at approximately 21.00hrs, along with the rest of the battalion, as part of Operation Mallard. After holding the line on the Breville ridge and sustaining many casualties, Tillett and the 2nd Ox and Bucks in August 1944 took part in the British break-out and advance to the Seine (see 6th Airborne Division advance to the River Seine), known as Operation Paddle. The battalion, along with the rest of the 6th Airborne Division, returned to Bulford Camp, Wiltshire, in early September 1944, after three months of nearly continuous action. =Operation Varsity= In November 1944, Major Howard received serious injuries following a road traffic accident and Tillett, promoted to major, replaced him as OC of D Company. He was to lead the company in the Ardennes: the Battle of the Bulge, holding the line in the Netherlands and in Operation Varsity: the air assault landing over the River Rhine on 24 March 1945. Operation Varsity was the last major battle on the Western Front during the Second World War. The gliders carrying the 2nd Ox and Bucks, including the glider carrying Tillett and D Company HQ, landed in daylight, north of Hamminkeln, east of the River Rhine, on the north-east perimeter of the 6th Airborne Division's landing zone. The Germans met the landing gliders with ferocious fire in the air and on the ground; the 2nd Ox and Bucks lost 400 killed or injured out of a total battalion strength of 800 men. Tillett's company was reduced to 3 officers and 58 men. In the battle of the landing area his company captured and held all its objectives. He continued to lead his company in the advance across Germany to the Baltic sea. During the advance, in woods, near L√ºneburg, Tillett and his company discovered the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. They were ordered to continue to pursue the enemy rather than investigate further; the Camp Guards having by this stage fled. At the end of the war Tillett was present at Wismar for the meeting between Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, commanding the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group, and his Russian counterpart Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky, for which the 2nd Ox and Bucks provided the Guard of Honour. Tillett was mentioned in despatches for his wartime service. Post-war In September 1945, he was posted to Palestine with the 2nd Ox and Bucks and the rest of the 6th Airborne Division (see 6th Airborne Division in Palestine) during the Palestine Emergency. He returned to England and attended the Staff College, Camberley, in 1949. Tillett served with the 1st Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, 43rd and 52nd, from 1953 at Osnabr√ºck, West Germany. In 1955 he became an instructor in the Nuclear Weapons Tactical Wing of the School of Infantry, Warminster, Wiltshire. He witnessed the British atomic weapons tests which took place at Maralinga in South Australia; the effects of which were to subsequently cause him health problems. In 1959 Tillett became second-in-command of the 1st Green Jackets (43rd and 52nd) based at Knook Camp, near Warminster. He was later posted to Uganda and became Commanding Officer of the 1st Ugandan Rifles, formerly the 4th King's African Rifles, based in Ginja, Uganda. One of his junior officers in the battalion was Idi Amin who was later to succeed Tillett in command of the battalion. Tillett, in the rank of local Brigadier, subsequently commanded the whole of the Ugandan Army. He later served in Ottawa, Canada and at HQ Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE). He retired from the Army in 1969 and served as a Retired Officer mainly involved in officer recruitment for the Royal Green Jackets. Later life Tillett became curator of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry Museum at Slade Park Barracks, Oxford and had a key role in the development of the new Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum in Winchester, Hampshire. He wrote a brief history of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry from the regiment's origins in 1741 and 1755 to the Royal Green Jackets up to 1992. He was the last-known surviving 2nd Ox and Bucks (the 52nd) officer to have taken part in the gliderborne air assault landing on Normandy, on D-Day, 6 June 1944. Tillett organised and regularly attended the regimental commemorations of the anniversaries of the battle for Normandy at B√©nouville and of the River Rhine Crossing at Hamminkeln, Germany. He was the administrator of the Darell-Brown Memorial Trust. He lived in Micheldever, Hampshire. He married Joan Lawson in 1943 with whom he was to have two sons and a daughter.

The premi√®re took place on Thursday, 3 February 2011 at the War Memorial Opera House, San Francisco.  Overview  Program notes for the ballet stated: \\"Based on the true story of the burning of Kyoto‚Äôs Golden Pavilion in 1950, RAkU is set in a much earlier time and in a style similar to Noh theater, which presents the essence of a story rather than a literal depiction... Despite its Japanese story and setting, RAkU contains no traditional Japanese dance or music; Possokhov is more interested in tone, aesthetics, and visual inventiveness than in reenacting history. Combining folk-based steps and Butoh (a post‚ÄìWorld War II Japanese dance form utilizing extremely slow movements) with classically based movement, he makes every emotion in this ballet visual and vivid.\\" The world premiere cast of RAkU consisted of Yuan Yuan Tan as the Princess, Damian Smith as her warrior husband, Pascal Molat as the evil monk and four warriors (Gaetano Amico, Sean Orza, Jeremy Rucker and Quinn Wharton). San Francisco Ballet restaged it in 2012 and 2015. In 2014, Yuan Yuan Tan won the Critics' Circle National Dance Award for Outstanding Female Performance (Classical) for her portrayal of the Princess in RAkU. On March 13, 2012, an audio recording of RAkU was released. It was performed by the San Francisco Ballet Orchestra and chanters of the San Francisco Zen Center, and led by San Francisco Ballet Music Director and Principal Conductor Martin West at Skywalker Sound on April 22, 2011. San Francisco Ballet also mounted RAkU on tour at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts in Costa Mesa in September 2011. The orchestra, led by Maestro Martin West, included members of The Pacific Symphony and the Buddhist chants were performed by the Zen Center of Los Angeles. The Company also brought RAkU to Sadler's Wells Theatre in London in September 2012 and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. in November 2012. RAkU joined the repertory of the Joffrey Ballet in September 2014 (the score was performed by Chicago Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Scott Speck) and was revived in 2016. Pacific Northwest Ballet had their company premiere of the work in Seattle in April 2018 (staged by Quinn Wharton). A one-hour documentary by Shirley Sun about RAkU called Fire and Ashes, Making the Ballet RAkU had its world premiere at the Brava Theater Center on October 20, 2017 as part of the San Francisco Dance Film Festival. The documentary had its New York premiere on July 21, 2018 as part of the Dance on Camera Festival at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center.

Sculpture and artistic work Santiago Medina Medina's earliest sculptures in the 1990s were in clay and over time began to also work in bronze and stainless steel. The pieces became larger in the 2000s and 2010s. In 2012, he worked with renowned urban architect Juan Felipe Uribe de Bedout on the Cedro Verde Project in Colombia. In 2014, \\"Life\\", a nine-foot monumental stainless steel sculpture was installed at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts to celebrate the first centennial of the school. Mariavelia Savino, well known curator and gallerist, summarizes Medina's art as: \\"What is most unique about contemporary artist Santiago Medina is his aesthetic depth and erudition to capture, in stainless steel and bronze, the authentic expressiveness of the visual arts. His art displays energetic but yet enigmatic spiraling figures in continuous movement rising to the heavens. The topics covered joy and harmony, lovers and maternal love, life and friendship, ecstasy and passion, are the fabric of who we are as humans. All these strong emotions converge in his seductive art.

His great-grandfather Emiliano MejiaJaime Osorio Gomez. Fotografia de Antioquia. Villegas Editores. 2012. was a pioneer photographer and painter in Colombia in the late 1800s and early 1900s. His grandfather, Rafael Mejia Uribe, was also a painter and prominent pediatrician in Colombia.

His father, Jorge Medina Gomez, was a physician and radiologist who graduated from Universidad de Antioquia School of Medicine at the head of his class. His mother, Susana, was a hospital volunteer at Medellin General Hospital He attended the Dora Ramirez Art Institute in Medellin, Colombia since age 5. Dora Ramirez was a leading artist and renown teacher of her time who has paintings at the Museum of Antioquia. In the 1980s, he trained at Libe de Zulategui Atelier. De Zulategui a leading art teacher and critic in Colombia. He studied at the Columbus School, a bilingual English-Spanish school, accredited both by the US and Colombian association of schools. He graduated at the head of his class and there he discovered his love for sports specially road cycling which is very popular in Colombia, country which breeds some of the top climbers in the world. In 1982, he start medical school at CES University with the idea of bringing medical sensibility to his strong artistic expression. He graduated first of his class and gave the graduation speech. Physician Inspired by the dual careers of Russian painter and lawyer Wassily Kandinsky and of his grandfather Rafael Mejia as a physician and artist he embarked on doing medicine and art as complementary careers. He decided to specialize in Radiology (Medical Imaging) because of its artistic 3D visual appeal and ground-breaking technology. He did his Diagnostic Radiology (Medical Imaging) residency at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University in St. Louis, USA. He then subspecialized in Neuroradiology (Brain imaging) and Pediatric Radiology (Medical Imaging in Children) at Boston Children's Hospital a Harvard School of Medicine affiliated Hospital. Looking to bring a social meaning to his medical and artist work he enrolled in the Harvard School of Public Health to do a Master of Public Health with a concentration in Health Care Management.

While living in Boston he had the chance to see the monumental sculptures of Henry Moore at Harvard University (\\"Four Piece Reclining Figure\\") and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (\\"Three Piece Reclining Figure Draped\\"). As Medina studied these sculptures he realized the power of the monumental sculpture and the beauty of the abstract, a realization that gave a new direction to his future works. Sculptor Following his early training in rigorous academic artistic training with Ramirez and de Zulategui he enrolled in specialized courses at the Cincinnati Institute of Art and then at the University of Miami Night Art Program. After traveling in Italy in the 1990s to study Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he realized that in order to become a master sculptor he needed to have deeper training in drawing and oil painting. In 2003, he joins the Romero and Hidalgo Art Studios in Miami to work and study. Renowned Venezuelan master painters Abdon Romero and Sonia Hidalgo inspired him to master oil painting on linen in the tradition of the Renaissance masters (http://www.romerohidalgostudios.com/). Works from this 2000s included paintings from his blue period ‚ÄúHope‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnlightment‚Äú currently at the College of Medicine Florida International University. Commissions for CES University Founders Library included ‚ÄúImagine: A tribute to John Lennon‚Äù and ‚ÄúDa Vinci, the universal man‚Äù. Religious commission included ‚ÄúResurrection‚Äù for Saint Louis Catholic Church in Miami, USA, ‚Äú Jesus Savior‚Äù for Santa Maria de Los Angeles Church in Colombia and ‚ÄúA tribute to John Paul ll‚Äù for Saint Madre Laura Convent in Colombia. Santiago Medina in Workshop To further his studies in monumental sculpture he studies and works with American sculptor Nilda Comas at the Legacy Art Studio in Pietrasanta, Italy and Ft. Lauderdale, USA. While studying in Pietrasanta and Carrara in Italy he decided to open large studios in Miami (Pinecrest), USA and Medellin, Colombia devoted primarily to sculptures. Early bronze works are at the Washington University School of Becker Medical Library and Harvard School of Public Health FRAN√áOIS-XAVIER BAGNOUD building. Medina explains the passion behind his sculptures as \\"I bring inert bronze and stainless steel to life by creating timeless masterpieces for art lovers. \\" In 2013 during the Centennial of the Harvard School of Public Health, Medina started to work on a monumental sculpture to commemorate such an important event. The nine-foot-high monumental stainless steel sculpture \\"Life\\" was unveiled at Harvard in October 2014. Medina explains the motivation behind the sculpture: ‚Äú I wanted to capture the essence of the Harvard School of Public Health which is the improvement of life. My inspiration was the double helical DNA molecule which is the code for all forms of life. Therefore, the sculpture has a double helical spiraling shape. Stainless steel with its very high quality finish was used not only because of its beauty and durability; but because it reflects life around it constantly changing its mood as the day, night and seasons come and go. In addition, the sculpture is actually alive by changing not only its look but also its temperature from the chili New England winters to the pleasant summer days.‚Äù In 2015, Medina is working on a monumental stainless steel sculpture for Miami Country Day School to celebrate its 75th anniversary.

Aldrich (born 1943) is an American sociologist and Kenan Professor of Sociology and Adjunct Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship at the Kenan Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is also a Faculty Research Associate at the Department of Strategy & Entrepreneurship at the Duke University Fuqua School of Business; and Fellow of Sidney Sussex College at Cambridge University. He is a Faculty Fellow of the Center for Study of Economy and Society at Cornell University. Aldrich's main research interests are entrepreneurship, team formation, evolutionary theory, economic sociology and inequality, and gender issues in entrepreneurship. Aldrich is best known for his work in applying an evolutionary perspective to organizational emergence and change. One of his seminal works is the 1999 book Organizations Evolving, which won the Academy of Management George Terry Award and was the co-winner of the Max Weber Award from the American Sociological Association's Section on Organizations, Occupations, and Work.  Early career  Aldrich received his BA in sociology from Bowling Green University in 1965 and went on to pursue his PhD at the University of Michigan. In 1966, he directed a survey project through the Institute of Social Research, which explored ethnic succession in the small business populations of high-crime areas of Boston, Washington DC, and Chicago. Aldrich carried out subsequent waves of the study in 1968 for his dissertation, titled Organizations in a Hostile Environment. This study led to follow-up studies in 1970 and 1972, in a collaboration with Albert J. Reiss Jr. The project became emblematic of the nationally representative, longitudinal research for which Aldrich came to be known and showed the effects of the broader social environment on business formation. Following the completion of his dissertation in 1969, Aldrich accepted an assistant professorship at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations. There he began to further develop his evolutionary perspectives on organizational theory, and wrote a number of papers that explored context as a driver for organizational change, including a paper titled \\"Organizational Boundaries and Inter-Organizational Conflict\\", and eventually formed the basis for his 1979 book, Organizations and Environments. Following up on his earlier studies in the US, in 1975, Aldrich also undertook comparative research on ethnic business succession in the UK. Several other waves in subsequent years revealed similar evidence of business populations changing in response to population-level residential changes. These studies also ultimately formed the basis of his 1990 book Ethnic Entrepreneurs, co-authored with Roger Waldinger and Robin Ward.  Evolutionary perspective on entrepreneurship  Aldrich's most influential works have presented, developed, and refined an evolutionary approach to organizational behavior and entrepreneurship. At the heart of this approach is the assumption that evolutionary processes are driven by entrepreneurs and organizations‚Äô struggles to obtain scarce resources, both social and physical. In organizational communities, organizations with different characteristics enter into relationships of competition and cooperation; those organizations better able to deal with the environment are more likely to survive, and characteristics of successful organizations may then be diffused to other organizations in the same population. The approach is applicable at multiple levels of analysis and directs attention to the processes of variation, selection, retention, and struggle that jointly produce patterned change in evolving systems. Aldrich's perspective was developed throughout the 1970s, at a time when new approaches to organizational analysis were blossoming around the world. In a collaboration with Jeff Pfeffer that began during a summer spent as a Visiting Assistant Professor at Stanford University, Aldrich co-authored a key paper, ‚ÄúEnvironments of Organizations\\". The paper presented the first synthetic statement of evolutionary and resource-dependence perspectives in organizational research and appeared in the Annual Review of Sociology. In a later collaboration with Bill McKelvey, in ‚ÄúPopulations, Natural Selection and Applied Organizational Science\\", Aldrich further argued that scholars could use the variation-selection-retention scheme to create a comprehensive understanding of organizational change. Aldrich also championed the idea that this evolutionary approach could also be applied in a multilevel framework. The article ‚ÄúFools rush in? The institutional context of industrial creation\\" coauthored with C Marlene Fiol, was a first step toward looking at new industries at the individual, group, organizational, and population levels. This multi-level perspective was also a key characteristic of Organizations Evolving, which began with creation at the organizational level, moved through change at the organization and population levels, and ended at the community level. That book was later revised in a collaboration with Martin Ruef.  Career at the University of North Carolina  Aldrich moved from Cornell University to the Department of Sociology at the University North Carolina, Chapel Hill in 1982. He was the first chair of the revamped Curriculum in Industrial Relations, later renamed the Management and Society (M&S;) Curriculum within the sociology department. He chaired the M&S; program until 2003, when he became department chair of sociology, serving until 2014. Under his direction, the department‚Äôs journal, Social Forces, switched from being self-published to becoming one of the major social science journals published by Oxford University Press. After arriving at the University North Carolina, Aldrich‚Äôs research shifted toward a greater focus on entrepreneurship, inspired in part by colleagues at entrepreneurship conferences such as the Babson Conference. One of his most well-known works, ‚ÄúEntrepreneurship through social networks\\", conceptualized business creation as an outcome of opportunity structures and access to resources obtained through key connecting relationships. Relatedly, Aldrich wrote extensively on family business, gender, and race issues of entrepreneurship, and social ties in small business creation. He was heavily influenced by his colleagues at UNC, particularly Glen Elder, who pioneered the approach called life course studies, and Amos Hawley, a pioneering researcher in human ecology. Aldrich was also involved in a number of key large-scale entrepreneurship projects, including the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED) I and II. Aldrich's recent work has focused on entrepreneurial efforts made possible by current social movements and technology. As the maker movement has empowered would-be entrepreneurs to tinker, explore, and unleash creative efforts, social networks have evolved and made it possible for such creative efforts to receive validation in many ways, including through crowd funding campaigns. He is investigating the possible effects that participating in the maker movement, especially in well- equipped maker spaces, might have on hobbyists and tinkerers creating prototypes and subsequently starting their own enterprises.

Overview Methylene cyclopropyl acetic acid (MCPA) is a compound found in lychee (Litchi chinensis) seeds.Gray DO, Fowden L. alpha-(methylenecyclopropyl)glycine from litchi seeds. Biochem J 1962;82:385‚Äì9. It is also a metabolite in mammalian digestion after ingestion of hypoglycin, a rare and potentially toxic amino acid, chemically related to the common amino acid lysine. Hypoglycin is found in the unripe ackee fruit in Africa. Dihydrosterculic acid is the major carbocyclic fatty acid in the seed oils of Litchi chinensis. It is a cyclopropene fatty acid; these have been found in many plants of the order Malvales (Sterculiaceae, Malvaceae, Bombaceae and Tiliaceae), in up to 60% of seed oil content, depending on the species but also in leaves, roots and shoots. They are accompanied by small amounts of their cyclopropanoid analogues, i.e. cyclopropyl acetic acid. Pathophysiology of MCPA MCPA forms non-metabolizable esters with coenzyme A (CoA) and carnitine, causing a decrease in their bioavailability and concentration in bodily tissue. Both of these cofactors are necessary for the Œ≤-oxidation of fatty acids, which in turn is vital for gluconeogenesis. MCPA also inhibits the dehydrogenation of a number of Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. The inhibition of one in particular, butyryl CoA dehydrogenase (a short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase), causes Œ≤-oxidation to cease before fully realized, which leads to a decrease in the production of NADH and Acetyl-CoA. The cascading effect continues, as this decrease in concentration further inhibits gluconeogenesis.Holson, Dave A. ‚ÄúAckee Fruit Toxicity.‚Äù Edited by Timothy E Corden, EMedicine, misc.medscape.com/pi/iphone/medscapeapp/html/A1008792-business.html. Formation of MCPA after ingestion of hypoglycin A and its toxicity Hypoglycin A is a water soluble liver toxin, that upon ingestion, leads to hypoglycemia through the inhibition of gluconeogenesis, a metabolic pathway that leads to the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrate carbon sources (i.e. glucogenic amino acids, lactate, and glycerol). In addition, it also limits Acyl and carnitine cofactors, which are instrumental in the oxidation of large fatty acids.The Chemical Society. Foreign Compound Metabolism in Mammals. Volume 1: A Review of the Literature Published between 1960 and 1969. London: The Chemical Society, 1970., p. 218. Hypoglycin A undergoes deamination, forming Œ±-ketomethylene-cyclopropylpropionic acid (KMCPP), which then forms MCPA through oxidative decarboxylation. Hypoglycin A (and hypoglycin B) is found in the ackee fruit, the national fruit of Jamaica, and, like Litchi chinensis, is a member of the family Sapindaceae. The fruit is rich in fatty acids, zinc, protein, and vitamin A. In the fully ripened arils of the fruit, Hypoglycin A is present at only 0.1ppm, but in the unripened fruit it can exceed a concentration of 1000ppm. Ingestion of the unripened fruit containing such a concentrated dose causes what is known as Jamaican vomiting sickness. Depending on the severity of the case, the symptoms range from headache, rapid heart beat and sweating to dehydration and low blood pressure stemming from intense vomiting, to delirium and coma, and finally seizures and death.Holson, Dave A. ‚ÄúAckee Fruit Toxicity.‚Äù Edited by Timothy E Corden, EMedicine, misc.medscape.com/pi/iphone/medscapeapp/html/A1008792-business.html. The symptoms stemming from lychee poisoning are near identical, both being caused by MCPA, with lychee seeds also containing methylenecyclopropyl glycine (MCPG), a homologue of Hypoglycin A. Hypoglycin A undergoes deamination, forming Œ±-ketomethylene-cyclopropylpropionic acid (KMCPP), which then forms MCPA through oxidative decarboxylation. Recent poisonings In 2014, numerous children died in Bihar (the largest producer of lychees in India) after consuming lychees. The vast majority of the fatalities were undernourished children who ate unripened lychees, their preexisting low blood sugar detrimentally amplifying the effects.NDTV Food. ‚ÄúThe Poisonous Litchi: Here's How Toxins in the Fruit Killed Children in Bihar‚Äù NDTV Food, NDTV Food, 4 Feb. 2017.

Former senior managing partner Jason Epstein departed the company in 2017.  History  On September 17, 2013, online music service Rhapsody International announced that it would accept a \\"significant\\" investment of an undisclosed amount from Columbus Nova Technology Partners. At the same time, it was announced that Rhapsody president Jon Irwin would step down and the company would lay off some of its workers. Former senior managing partner Jason Epstein also owns Daybreak Game Company, Harmonix, the makers of Guitar Hero, whom he bought from Viacom in December 2010. In 2015, Columbus Nova made large investments in Chairman Benny Gantz's Fifth Dimension, a real time predictive analysis firm used by security agencies. Fifth Dimension was founded in 2014 by CEO Guy Caspi and deputy Chairman of the Board Doron Cohen. Late in 2018, Fifth Dimension ceased its operations. In 2017, Mother Jones reported that Andrew Intrater donated $250,000 to Trump's inauguration fund and $35,000 to a joint fundraising committee for Trump‚Äôs re-election and the Republican National Committee. = Connection to Viktor Vekselberg and payments to Michael Cohen = According to the Washington Post, \\"Columbus Nova has been described in federal regulatory filings as an affiliate of the Renova Group, founded by Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg\\". The sanctioned Russian company Renova Group, itself controlled by Vekselberg, also subject to U.S. sanctions, has previously listed Columbus Nova as an affiliate investment manager under the Renova Group's umbrella. Per regulations administered by the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), companies that are at least 50% owned by sanctioned individuals or companies are themselves subject to U.S. sanctions. Columbus Nova stated that, while Renova Group had been their largest client, they had never been part of Renova Group, and had been \\"100 percent owned by U.S. citizen\\" since its inception. On May 8, 2018, the New York Times reported that during 2017 Columbus Nova made payments of at least $500,000 to a bank account maintained by Michael Cohen, then acting as President Donald Trump's personal attorney. However, the sanctions against Renova Group were not put in place until April 6, 2018, so even if Columbus Nova were subject to sanctions due to its ownership structure, payments from Vekselberg to Donald Trump (via Cohen) would not have been expressly prohibited by OFAC at the time the payments were made. Subsequent reporting by the New York Times noted that the Muller report did not name Intrater or Vekselberg and quoted Intrater as saying, ‚ÄúThe fact that I‚Äôm not even mentioned in the Mueller report confirms what I knew all along ‚Äî that I‚Äôve done nothing wrong.‚Äù As reported in the New York Times, on July 1, 2019, Intrater and his Columbus Nova entity sued the United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) claiming that OFAC's \\"50% rule\\" - whereby any property owned 50% or more by a sanctioned person is itself subject to sanctions also known as blocking - is unconstitutional as applied to Americans who have an interest in such property. The New York Times article also noted that \\"If successful, the lawsuit could break new legal ground. Carlton Greene, a former senior Treasury official who worked in the office overseeing investigations into sanctions violations and is now a partner at Crowell & Moring, said past lawsuits had raised Fourth Amendment issues but none made it a central argument. \\"\\"I think a Fourth Amendment argument for property blocked in the U.S., for a party with constitutional rights, is an argument that the government would have to take seriously,\\"\\" Mr. Greene said.

Molarity Redux is a webcomic following the same characters as alumni.  Molarity, 1977‚Äì1982  Molarity first began in The Observer, Notre Dame's student newspaper, in 1977. It appeared sporadically at first, but with advocacy by Steve Odland, Observer managing editor at the time, Molarity eventually ran five days a week during the school year, in a four-panel black- and-white format. Molinelli continued the strip even during a year abroad, while studying architecture in Rome. In chemistry, \\"molarity\\" is a term for molar concentration; the strip's title plays on the name of its protagonist, Jim Mole. \\"Molarity\\" is also said to be a portmanteau of \\"Molinelli\\" with \\"hilarity\\".  Molarity Redux webcomic, 2010 onward  In the Summer 2000 issue of the alumni magazine Notre Dame, Molinelli contributed \\"Molarity Redux,\\" in which the strip's characters, now older, are working on the Notre Dame campus. In January 2010, Molarity Redux returned as a monthly feature on Notre Dame Magazine's Web site. In format it is generally a color strip of eight to nine panels. Selections from the original strip, billed as \\"Molarity Classic\\", also run on Notre Dame Magazines site.  Characters  Molarity's central character is Jim Mole, a student everyman. His roommates include Mitch, a football player; Chuck Mason, an anarchic political activist; and Dion Wicker III, who comes from a wealthy and privileged family. Mitch's intelligent girlfriend, Cheryl, is a roommate of the self-involved and fashion-conscious Brenda. Notre Dame's diverse student body included Alfie, a dolphin. Years later, in Molarity Redux, Jim is a tweed-clad Notre Dame professor. Also teaching is Brenda, who is married to Mitch, now an assistant football coach. Chuck Mason has become a performance artist.  Collections  Three books of collected Molarity strips were published in the 1980s, each reportedly selling 4000 to 5000 copies. Two were issued by Juniper Press, and the third was published by Buy the Book Press. Molarity: On the Road to Selling Out Juniper Press (Notre Dame, Indiana), 1980.

It aims to inform students of their right to an education free from gender-based violence under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex discrimination in institutions receiving federal government funding. The organization also seeks to influence legislation and policy to improve federal enforcement of Title IX and treatment of student victims.  Founding  Know Your IX was co-founded in 2013 by Amherst College student Dana Bolger and Yale Law School student Alexandra Brodsky, both of whom were sexually assaulted on college campuses, as a \\"survivor-run, student-driven campaign to end campus sexual violence.\\" Goals include clarifying misconceptions regarding Title IX, explaining statutory requirements, and documenting complaint filing protocols. The organization's website explains: > Running on grassroots energy, we educate students across the country about > their civil right to education free from sexual violence and harassment > while also pushing policy and legislative change on the national level for > better federal enforcement of that same right. In July 2016, Mahroh Jahangiri became Executive Director of Know Your IX. In fall of 2017, Sage Carson assumed leadership of the organization.  Legal education  The Know Your IX website hosts resources including \\"know your rights\\" materials on Title IX and the Clery Act. Know Your IX maintains an active social media presence through which it shares its educational resources, The organization also encourages visitors to its website to share educational resources through social media or by printing posters. In October 2013 Amy Poehler's Smart Girls project released an education video promoting the Know Your IX project A number of schools promulgate the information Know Your IX publishes about Title IX, including the Smart Girls video.  Audience  Know Your IX attempts to reach both students who don't know their Title IX rights and existing activists. It aims to be broad based to counter the historical trend that \\"Feminism and the movement against sexual violence has historically been a very white, upper-middle-class movement\\", according to Bolger.  Policy advocacy  Know Your IX advocates for state and federal policy and legislative reform. Through its \\"ED ACT NOW\\" campaign, the organization first focused on the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, from which it demanded increased transparency and Title IX enforcement. Since ED ACT NOW's launch, OCR has released the list of schools under investigation for sexual assault-related violations of Title IX and begun finding schools officially out of compliance with the law. Know Your IX also advocates for legislative change, including authorizing the OCR to fine schools for Title IX violations. In June 2014, Brodsky, Bolger, and former Know Your IX members John Kelly and Laura Dunn participated in federal Senate roundtables regarding changes in Title IX enforcement. Know Your IX has also vocally opposed state laws to require colleges and universities to refer sexual assault reports to law enforcement.  Journalism guide  In fall of 2014, the organization published a guide for journalists writing about gender based campus violence. Reaction was mixed; the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault described it as a \\"comprehensive guide\\" for \\"accuracy and objectivity\\", whereas in the Washington Examiner, Ashe Schow claimed that Know Your IX \\"cares less about actual justice and more about automatically believing every accuser and labeling the accused as rapists\\".

Wolff became a journalist and author, but spent much time travelling through the Dolomites asking the people he met, especially the old, if they could recall the local legends, which he recorded in his notebook, and later published. He proposed that the Ladinian population of the Dolomite valleys had once had a matriarchal society. He discovered the saga of the Kingdom of Fanes by piecing together the fragments of legend that he had collected with his friend Hugo von Rossi. Since he had not received a university education, for a long time his stories were attacked as his own inventions. He was only recognized towards the end of his long life. Wolff was a pan-German nationalist, and thought that Germans were the original Indo-German people. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) he published articles in the Alldeutsche Bl√§tter in which he called the Italians and French representatives of the African and Asiatic races, who had the audacity to attack the European Germans. In 1918 he wrote, \\"The next bimillenium will be the age of the Germans, for German history is just repeating Indo-German history, and the world is about to become German in the same way it once became Indo-German. Some of the articles were so extreme that they were translated and published by the French propagandists. Karl Felix Wolff' died on 25 November 1966 in Bolzano. Selected works Wolff published a number of books in German, including collections of legends and descriptions of places, and also published magazine articles, booklets and leaflets. His interest was that of a poet and author rather than an anthropologist, so the legends are probably not entirely authentic. =German language= * Monographie der Dolomitenstra√üe und des von ihr durchzogenen Gebiets.

Early life Nancy Brown, known to her family and friends as Nannie, was born on 5th Avenue, Manhattan, New York City to a wealthy American industrialist family in 1878. Nancy would be better known by her married name O'Rahilly, and her part in the Irish revolutionary period. Her husband, The O'Rahilly, was one of the leaders and the most senior casualty of 1916 Easter Rising. She was educated in the United States, before visiting Ireland, and later attended an Ursuline convent in Paris. She first met Michael Rahilly, when he was a medical student in Dublin. Known to him as Nannie, they were engaged, deciding thereafter to move to New York, her fianc√© following to be near her. He sold his family business in County Kerry, before moving to America. They were married on 15 April 1899. Rahilly worked for her father's Brown Mills Company. Their first child came soon after on 14 March 1900, named Bobby. They lived in New York until 1902, before moving back to Ireland. Bobby died in June 1903 but another son, Richard (always known as 'Mac') was born on 3 July 1903. They lived in Paris, and then Brighton, before Egan (from the Irish 'Aodogan') was born in 1904. The family then moved to London. In 1905, they moved again back to New York, and closed the family business, Brown Mills, which had failed. Their fourth son, Niall was born in Philadelphia in December 1906. They lived in New York until 1909. Later life in Ireland Together with her husband, Nancy O'Rahilly returned to Ireland to live near sisters Nell and Anna Humphreys. They joined the Gaelic League and became fluent in the Irish language (gaelic). O'Rahilly contributed to Irish Freedom, editor of An Claidheamh Soluis, the Gaelic League paper. Nancy O'Rahilly joined Cumann na mBan in 1914 and was elected to its founding Executive Committee. Two oldest sons joined Fianna √âireann. Her husband Michael Joseph O'Rahilly, was killed during the Easter Rising, having written a note of dying declaration to her. Her last child was born, after the Rising, in July 1916. Her house at 40 Herbert Park, Ballsbridge, County Dublin where she lived with her young family was raided by British soldiers in mid-1916. In 1920, she joined the White Cross organization, and she was appointed to the executive committee and spoke on a fundraising tour of the USA. She became a Vice-President of Cumann na mBan, but resigned in 1922, during the Irish Civil War, when her son was fighting for the anti-treaty IRA, which she also supported. She also acted on the Winding-Up Committee in 1925. She lived in Herbert Park, Ballsbridge until her death in 1961, and is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery.

It is the third installment in the Five Nights at Freddy's series, and is chronologically set thirty years after the events of the first game and is chronologically the fourth installment in the series. The game was released on Steam on March 2, 2015, for Android devices on March 7, 2015, and for iOS devices on March 12, 2015. A Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One port was released on November 29, 2019. The game received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, who praised Springtrap and the reworked camera system but criticized the phantom animatronics' jumpscares.  Gameplay  The gameplay deviates from the previous games in the series slightly. In keeping with the first two installments, players are once again tasked with surviving a week of night shifts, lasting from 12 A.M. to 6 A.M. (4 minutes of real time). However, this game features only one animatronic that can physically attack the player. Several animatronics from earlier games return as \\"phantoms\\" that cannot harm the player directly, but can hinder efforts to survive until 6 A.M. The game takes place in a horror-themed attraction named Fazbear's Fright, which is constructed using props and equipment salvaged from the former Fazbear Entertainment restaurants. The attraction aims to capitalize on the previous incidents that occurred at the various restaurants formerly operated by the company. The player must monitor two separate security camera systems, one each for the rooms/corridors and ventilation ductwork in order to track the animatronic's movements. In addition, the player must watch the status of three operating systems and reboot them whenever they malfunction. These systems control the cameras, a set of audio devices that can be used to lure the animatronic away from the player's position, and the ventilation. Failure to keep the latter of these running can cause the player to hallucinate seeing multiple animatronics in the building. If the real animatronic enters the office, it jumpscares the player and the game ends. The game consists of five nights, increasing in difficulty, and completing all five unlocks an even more challenging \\"Nightmare\\" night. Several low- resolution minigames are hidden within the main game; completing all of them unlocks the game's \\"good ending\\" and grants access to bonus content that includes a cheat menu. If the player completes the \\"Nightmare\\" night, they will unlock the cheat menu. The cheat menu offers a range of options, including a mode to make the animatronics act more aggressive and therefore make the game harder, depending on the player's skills. Other cheats include a radar and the ability to make nights faster.  Plot  Set thirty years after the events of the first game, the player assumes the role of a newly- hired employee at Fazbear's Fright, a horror-themed attraction based on the unsolved mysteries of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, constructed using paraphernalia salvaged from the original restaurants. During the week before the attraction is scheduled to open to the public, the player must watch over the facility from the security office during their shift (12:00 A.M. to 6:00 A.M. game time), using a network of surveillance cameras placed in the rooms and air vents. In addition, the player must monitor the status of three operating systems ‚Äì cameras, audio and ventilation ‚Äì and reboot them whenever they begin to malfunction. Camera problems cause the video feeds, already poorly lit and distorted, to become totally obscured by static. If the ventilation fails, the player's vision begins to black out. The player may also see phantoms of animatronics from the previous games; these can cause system malfunctions, most commonly in the ventilation, but cannot directly harm the player. After the first night, the staff at Fazbear's Fright uncover an older deteriorated, rabbit-like animatronic which they nickname \\"Springtrap\\"; The player must now prevent it from entering the office and attacking; if this occurs, the game ends. The player can seal off the air vents at certain points to block its progress, but cannot seal the door or air vent that lead directly into the office. The audio system, when functioning properly, can be used to play sound effects that draw Springtrap away from the office. Ventilation malfunctions can cause the player to hallucinate seeing more than one animatronic on the cameras. As the nights progress, the player hears a series of instructional cassette tapes (similar to the telephone calls from the first two games) that instruct employees how to operate two suits which can function as both an animatronic and a costume for humans. The tapes also discuss a \\"safe room,\\" an additional emergency room which \\"is not included in the digital map layout programmed in the animatronics or the security cameras, is hidden to customers, invisible to animatronics, and is always off-camera.\\" However, later nights discourage use of the suits. The Night 4 recording states the suits are \\"deemed temporarily unfit for employees\\" following \\"an unfortunate incident at the sister location involving multiple and simultaneous spring lock failures.\\" To replace the faulty suits, the archive states that temporary costumes that \\"were found on very short notice\\" would be provided, though requesting that \\"questions about appropriateness/relevance should be deflected.\\" The recording which plays during Night 5 reminds employees that the safe room is \\"a safety location for employees only\\" and that customers must never be taken there. Also, after discovering that one of the special suits was \\"noticeably moved,\\" it reminds employees that the suits are \\"not safe to wear under any circumstances.\\" Low-resolution minigames between nights hint at the restaurant's troubled past, with the first four nights' minigames depicting the original animatronics following a dark purple animatronic before being violently disassembled by William Afton, previously seen in the minigames of Five Nights at Freddy's 2 as the man responsible for the various murders that occurred throughout the fictional franchise's history. In the fifth night's minigame, the ghosts of the five children who inhabited the animatronics corner William Afton, who attempts to protect himself by hiding in the \\"Spring Bonnie\\" suit. However, the suit's faulty spring-lock mechanism fails, and the man is crushed as the children fade away, leaving their killer to seemingly bleed to death, explaining Springtrap's origins. \\"Happiest Day\\" minigame Unlike the previous entries, Five Nights at Freddy's 3 contains two endings, depending on whether the player has found and completed all of the hidden minigames within the main game. Some of these are only available on specific nights, while others can be accessed during any night. The \\"bad ending\\" is attained from completing the game without completing all the hidden minigames, and shows a screen depicting the heads of the five animatronics from the first game with lit-up eyes, implying that the animatronics are still possessed. Completing all the hidden minigames before completing the game earns the \\"good ending\\", which is the same screen as described previously but with the animatronics' heads turned off, with one head disappearing, presumably Golden Freddy. This implies that the children's souls have finally been put to rest. Completing all five nights unlocks a bonus night, \\"Nightmare\\", which boosts the game's difficulty, similar to \\"Night 6\\" in the previous titles. While playing the mode, an archived recording states that all Freddy Fazbear's Pizza locations' safe rooms will be permanently sealed, instructing employees that they are \\"not [to] be mentioned to family, friends or insurance representatives.\\" When this night is completed, a newspaper clipping reveals that Fazbear's Fright was destroyed in a fire shortly after the events of the game and that any salvageable items from the attraction are to be auctioned off. However, brightening the image reveals Springtrap in the background, confirming that he survived and is set to return in one of the next games.  Development  In January 2015, a new image was uploaded to Scott Cawthon's website, teasing a third entry in the series. A short while later, a second image was released, depicting the redesigned animatronics from the second game apparently scrapped. Various teaser images followed, before a trailer was released on January 26, 2015. The game was posted (and later accepted) onto Steam Greenlight the same day. A demo for the game was released to selected YouTubers on March 1, 2015, with the full game being released hours later on March 2, 2015. On March 7, 2015, a mobile port was released for Android devices, and for iOS on March 12, 2015.  Reception  Metacritic's aggregate reviews for Five Nights at Freddy's 3 has received an average score of 68 out of 100. Omri Petitte from PC Gamer gave Five Nights at Freddy's 3 a score of 77 out of 100, praising the reworked camera system, but commented on how the jumpscares from the other animatronics \\"felt a little stale by the third night.\\" In a more critical review, Nic Rowen from Destructoid gave the game a 6.5 out of 10, saying that even though the game is \\"by far the most technically proficient and mechanically satisfying installment yet,\\" he criticized Springtrap and Fazbear's Fright for lacking the \\"charm of the original cast and locations.\\"  References   External links  * * Five Nights at Freddy's 3 on IndieDB Category:2015 video games Category:Android (operating system) games 3 Category:Indie video games Category:IOS games Category:Point-and-click adventure games Category:Horror video games Category:Fiction set in 2023 Category:Video games about robots Category:Single-player video games Category:Works about missing people Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games with alternate endings Category:Windows games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Xbox One games Category:Clickteam (game engine) games ","title":"Five Nights at Freddy's 3"},{"id":"45285363","text":"The Argentina‚ÄìUnited States lemon dispute was a World Trade Organization dispute settlement case (DS448) challenging U.S. import laws. On September 3, 2012, Argentina requested the assistance of the World Trade Organization in hosting consultations to discuss the United States procedures. Argentina claimed that the prohibition of imports of this fruit for the previous 11 years, and other restrictive measures, lacked scientific justification.. Argentina asserted that the United States was trying to dismay the benefits of the World Trade Agreements.  The lemon industry  According to the Federation of American Scientists, the U.S. is the largest importer of lemons at 475,000 metric tons for 2011 to 2012. Argentina is the producer of 1.0-1.5 MMT per year with 260,000 MT of sufficient quality to be sent to the fresh export market. Argentina argues that since others import the fruit the United States, the largest importer of lemons, should follow the same procedure. \\"Argentine citrus is exported to destinations with very high health standards such as the Netherlands, Spain and Italy, which do not question the excellent quality of Argentine produce,\\" the Argentine government said. The United States is concerned with two plant diseases, citrus variegated chlorosis and citrus greening that could hurt U.S. lemon production. Recently, a 2014 study shows that Argentine lemons contained excessive imazalil pesticide residues. Imazalil is a systemic fungicide, which is used post-harvest on bananas, citrus and as a pre-planting seed treatment of barley and wheat. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies imazalil as a likely human carcinogen, but it is not generally considered to be a dietary risk. The EPA allows for the presence of imazalil residue within certain tolerances in or on specific food commodities. In 2011, U.S. imports of Argentine farm products topped $1.64 billion, while U.S. agricultural exports to Argentina totaled $154 million. The United States is running a trade surplus or a positive balance of trade.  Origins of dispute  The U.S., along with Japan, filed their complaints over the import licensing system earlier in August (2012) and the European Union lodged a nearly identical case in May. Following others complaints, Mexico became the fourth country to challenge the Argentine policies. The four challengers assert the same basic allegation: That Argentina has used import licensing and registration requirements as an informal trade balancing program to favor domestic producers, withholding the licenses from importers unless they agree to certain export quotas. In March, 2012, 14 members of the WTO Council for Trade in Goods, including the U.S., EU and Mexico, said the regulations were creating long delays and resulting in huge costs for many of the companies doing business with Argentina. The countries said the policies were unbefitting a WTO nation, and urged Argentina to dismantle the licensing program. U.S. Trade Representative spokeswomen, Nkenge Harmon said, \\"We are concerned with a disturbing trend in which countries engaged in actions that are inconsistent with their WTO obligations retaliate with counter-complaints rather than fix the underlying problem raised in complaint‚Äù. This particular case seems to be a part of larger problem and an act of retaliation.  The WTO case  Argentina claims that the prohibition of imports of this fruit for the last 11 years, and other restrictive measures, lack scientific justification. Argentina also claims that the measures of the United States appear to cancel or impair the benefits for Argentina derived, directly or indirectly, from the relevant WTO Agreements. Argentina challenged the U.S. by these specific measures: * a series of US measures allegedly maintained for the past 11 years, which Argentina argues constitute an import prohibition on citrus fruits affecting fresh lemons originating in the Northwest region of Argentina; * the United States' failure to grant approval for the importation of fresh lemons from the Northwest region of Argentina; and * alleged undue delays in the approval procedures for the importation of fresh lemons from the Northwest region of Argentina. On December 6, 2012, Argentina requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 17 December 2012, the Dispute Settlement Body deferred the establishment of a panel. There have been no further updates on the case since December 2012.

He is the founder and leader of the Hong Kong Resurgence Order and is the ideological leader of the \\"Hong Kong Autonomy Movement,\\" dubbed as the \\"godfather of localism\\" in Hong Kong. Until mid-2016, Chin was an assistant professor at the Department of Chinese of the Lingnan University.https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/04/14/first- casualty-after-occupy-lingnan-refuses-contract-extension-of-radical-professor/ Biography =Background= Chin was born in Hong Kong in 1961. His father, a Traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, was born in Malaysia and came to Hong Kong in 1950. He received Bachelor of Arts degree in English at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 1986. He later studied in Germany, obtaining a doctorate in ethnology from the University of G√∂ttingen in 1995. He returned to Hong Kong and worked at the Policy Research Institute between 1995 and 1996 and was a senior advisor to the HKSAR government on cultural, arts, and civic affairs from 1997 and worked as research director in the Home Affairs Bureau until 2007. He became one of the leading critical intellectual voices against the destruction of local communities and historical edifices amidst the craze of urban redevelopment. Using the pen name Chin Wan, he wrote for many newspaper columns and supported the young radicals who became increasingly militant in opposing Hong Kong and Chinese real estate tycoons and Beijing's intervention in Hong Kong. In 2009, he was hired as assistant professor at the Department of Chinese of the Lingnan University. He held his teaching post until mid-2016 when his contract was not renewed, allegedly due to his localist views. =\\"Godfather of localism\\"= In 2011, Chin published the book On the Hong Kong City-State. His book analysed Beijing's neo- imperialist stance on Hong Kong. Responding to it, Chin rooted in a Hong Kong perspective, reflects the rising tide of Hong Kong \\"localist\\" ideology and actions. Chin emphasised the significance of Hong Kong autonomy for the sake of Hong Kongers. The book triggered fierce public debate and was popular among the young generation. It was selected as one of the best books of the year in 2011 by the Hong Kong Book Prize organised by Radio Television Hong Kong, and has been on the best-seller list of all major bookstore chains ever since its publication in late 2011. Chin argued that a democratic China could hurt Hong Kong more as populism will reign in the democratic Chinese legislature, dissolving the \\"one country, two systems\\" commitment and Hong Kong's valuable resources would become fair game to a voracious China. \\"What we Hongkongers need is not a democratic China, but to build Hong Kong into an autonomous city-state first, merging the British culture with a restored Chinese culture,\\" wrote Chin. He suggested that Hongkongers should push for a \\"Chinese Confederation\\" consisting of separate and parallel states in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. He strongly criticised the candle vigil for the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests organised by the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China in 2013 for their Chinese patriotic sentiment in their slogan. He blamed the mainstream pro-democrat politicians for the failure of the Hong Kong democracy movement, accusing them for betraying the Hong Kong people by colluding with the United States and China. He also strongly criticised the left-leaning activists, stating them as the reason of the failure of the social movements and their pro-immigrant and cosmopolitan stance. Chin advocates \\"Hong Kong First\\" and \\"Hong Kong-China separation\\" positions and stressed that the influx of mainland tourists and immigrants is the largest threat to the established institutions and social customs of Hong Kong and is part of the scheme of Beijing's colonisation. He called for actions from the radical activists against the tourists and advocated violent actions as the means for defending Hong Kong's autonomy. Chin's opinions triggered huge arguments within the pro-democracy activists and he was condemned \\"xenophobic\\" and \\"nativist\\" by the mainstream activists and the government. Chin is well known for his inflammatory remarks on Facebook and enjoys a growing, loyal following on the Internet. He once made a remark on Facebook saying that \\"the Communist Party cannot slaughter Hong Kong men, nor can it publicly rape Hong Kong women. So it uses soft methods to send the mainland vagina to Hong Kong. With the roles of wife, lover and prostitute, the vagina and uterus of Hong Kong women are scrapped.\\" He became the advisor of an autonomy organisation. More radical elements took his idea further, expressing a yearning for the bygone days of British rule, waving colonial flags, and even advocated for Hong Kong independence, from which Chin himself draws a line. During the 2014 Hong Kong protests, Chin called for militant actions in contrast to the non-violent movement advocated by the mainstream organisers, Occupy Central with Love and Peace, Hong Kong Federation of Students and Scholarism. He had criticised the Occupy organisers even before the protests, stating their peaceful approaches would achieve nothing but their own personal moral high ground. He was later on asked to report to the police in suspect of inciting and organising an unauthorised assembly. =2016 LegCo bid= He joined an electoral alliance with Civic Passion led by Wong Yeung-tat and incumbent legislator Wong Yuk-man to contest in the 2016 Legislative Council election after a localist activist Edward Leung of Hong Kong Indigenous received a better-than-expected result in the 2016 New Territories East by-election in which Leung grabbed more than 66,000 votes. Chin contested in the New Territories East with the slogan of \\"creating a de facto referendum in five constituencies; allow all citizens to participate in the creation of constitution\\". Chin's list received 23,635 votes, four percent of the total votes, ranking 13th place and was not elected.

Camaldolese Church, Warsaw History Church and its surroundings in 1861 The King of Poland W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa (Polish: W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Waza) founded the first church in Biela≈Ñski Forest as a vote of gratitude for royal election the crown and winning in the Smolensk campaign. The church had to be situated in a remote area according to the Camaldoleses tradition and it was built on the area of former village P√≥lko (now Bielany). In 1669‚Äì1710 and 1733‚Äì1755 the church was rebuilt, the founders of the project were Polish kings John II Casimir (Polish: Jan II Kazimierz Waza) and Michael I (Polish: Micha≈Ç Korybut Wi≈õniowiecki). During the 19th century Poland was under partitions. After the fall of the January Uprising in 1864, Tsarist occupation authorities liquidated all Camaldoles monasteries with the exception of the Warsaw. In the next years, Russian authorities took over some of the buildings. The Russians introduced a ban on the admission of new members. After that, the church and hermitages were taken over by the Russian Red Cross. In 1905 a parish was created and the church was renovated. After Russian's withdrawal from Warsaw in 1914 an orphanage was formed and run by Sisters. In 1916 a seminar was launched and in 1918 a junior high school was built in the former foresterium. Nowadays the church and the hermitage huts are preserved in their original state. After the destruction of the 2nd World War and burning down of the gymnasium building, the former monastery buildings were redesigned by the ATK (Catholic Theology Academy), now UKSW (Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University), and on the site of the hostelry and the remnants of the gymnasium building there is a modern seminary building being erected by the Warsaw Archdiocese. Architecture Plan of the Camaldolese Church, Warsaw Standing in front of the facade of the church we are exactly on the axis of the monastic complex. It is pointed out by the wooden cross standing at today Dewajtis street. From the setting of that cross in 1693 began to pave the grounds of the monastery. The monastery complex consists of a gate, church, 13 hermitages and foresterium. According to Mariusz Karpowicz the church was designed by Italian architect Isidoro Affaitati. =Facade= The facade was erected when the church with the main body had been already built. The designer of that late Baroque works could be a Roman architect Gaetano Chiaveri. The facade is triaxle ‚Äì the central part is a little forward of and topped with a tympanum, enclosed in a pair of composite pilasters and columns. Here there are two architectural styles late Baroque and early Classicism. The first of them can be seen in the details and the second one in the central part and columns. In the side niches are set two wooden polychrome sculptures. The first shows Saint Benedict and the second one Saint Romuald. =Interior= Interior decorations are in rococo style. the church has an octagonal plan cut by cross. Presbytery is a double span, closed semicircular. There is an octagonal nave, which cut transept by transverse axis. The transept is made by two symmetrical chapels. We can observe a great sailing vault. On the diagonal axes are four chapels lower than those which determine presbytery. Consistency adds fact that the whole interior has part of Corinthian style for example columns. Between the chapels there are placed narrow passages. =Hermitages= Hermitage Gate, Camaldolese Church, Warsaw Walking around the church, we can see 13 hermitages. They are arranged in four parallel rows on either side of the central axis formed. Between houses connected by low walls fences are situated gardens. All hermitages have the same interior. In the center there is cross-vaulted hall, on the one side there is a cell and small utility room, on the other side we can see chapel and woodshed. Nowadays Today it is a parish church. At present, near the church there is junior high school, high school and UKSW (Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University). Now the church is also a kind of cultural center. The concerts and theatrical performances take place in the crypt, there is also a caf√©. There are several attractions for children such as a wooden carousel and a donkey. The church is attractive both for local society and tourists. Bibliography * Maria Brykowska, Ko≈õci√≥≈Ç Kamedu≈Ç√≥w na Bielanach, Warszawa: Wyd. PWN, 1982 * Ks.

However, many commentators regarded as an attempt by NBC to piggyback on the box office success of American Sniper and ABC's success with American Crime. According to TV Insider, the main reason for the surprising last minute name change was that the awareness of the upcoming series was low, and that the retitling would offer \\"the opportunity to better market the show to middle-American audiences.\\" A teaser trailer was released on March 6, 2015, which revealed an April 5 release date and featured the tagline, \\"A soldier. A mother. Betrayed. Her odyssey begins.\\" The first two episodes were shown as a double bill when BBC Two premiered the series in the United Kingdom on Sunday June 28, 2015, under its original name. The series was originally set to premiere in Australia on the Seven Network in 2015 but did not premiere until March 20, 2016 in a late night timeslot. Reception The series has received mixed or average reviews from U.S. critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a rating of 50% based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads \\"With a been-there-seen-that premise and multiple muddled plots, American Odyssey can't escape the shadows of its superior predecessors in an age of solid spy/action television.\\" On Metacritic, the show has a score of 59 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"Mixed or average reviews\\". The initial reaction from British reviewers was also fairly negative. Michael Hogan in The Daily Telegraph wrote after the first two episodes had aired that \\"The programme wasn't without tense moments but the trouble was its scattergun plotting. It was like someone had cut up broadsheet newspapers from recent years and glued bits randomly to the script, making the whole thing lack cohesion. Homeland it certainly isn't.\\" Ellen E. Jones of The Independent was less harsh, writing that \\"This new series starring Anna Friel as an American special-ops soldier really is global conflict for dummies, but that doesn't necessarily make for bad television. It's nonsense, but it's glossy, well- executed nonsense.\\" David Butcher in Radio Times commented that \\"Parts of Odyssey may remind you dimly of Homeland. Its American network NBC probably hoped to create a down-and-dirty version of the Claire Danes thriller, but what we end up with is more Poundland than Homeland. It's perfectly serviceable, undemanding drama, with a bit of (not nearly enough) action here and there. But Homeland it ain‚Äôt.\\" Episodes  References External links  Category:2015 American television series debuts Category:2015 American television series endings Category:2010s American drama television series Category:American action television series Category:American military television series Category:2010s American political television series Category:American thriller television series Category:English-language television shows Category:NBC original programming Category:Television series by Universal Television Category:Television shows set in Mali Category:Terrorism in television Category:American political drama television series ","title":"American Odyssey"},{"id":"45285669","title":"Handsome (song)"},{"id":"45285697","title":"Queen Sugar"},{"id":"45285705","text":"Horner Rennbahn is a metro station on the Hamburg U-Bahn lines U2 and U4.

Series creator Tim Kring returned as executive producer. During the 2015 Super Bowl, NBC aired a 16-second teaser promo for the series. On July 9, 2015, a six-chapter web-series titled Dark Matters was released to introduce the characters and story of Heroes Reborn. On January 13, 2016, it was announced that Heroes Reborn would not be renewed for a second season. Plot According to the official synopsis, the miniseries will \\"reconnect with the basic elements of the show's first season\\" in which ordinary people discover that they have special abilities. A six-chapter prequel web-based series titled Dark Matters was released on July 9, 2015, to introduce the new characters and story lines. The series takes place one year after a terrorist attack in Odessa, Texas. The government blames those with extraordinary abilities (\\"Evolved humans\\", or \\"Evos\\"), who are forced into hiding when vigilantes systematically hunt and kill them. Two such killers, Luke and Joanne Collins, are seeking revenge for the son they lost at the Odessa bombing. Noah Bennet is also in hiding, but is found by the conspiracy theorist Quentin Frady, who tries to show him the truth behind the Odessa tragedy. Meanwhile, new characters are discovering their own unique abilities. In Illinois, Tommy tries to live a normal life with his dream girlfriend, Emily, after being forced to move and change his name to hide his powers. In Tokyo, Miko is looking for her missing father, but her quest to find him could prove deadly. A new hero is emerging in Los Angeles through Carlos, a former soldier whose brother (an Evo) tried to protect people with powers. Malina is an innocent teenager who, although inexperienced with her powers, has a great destiny. Meanwhile, in the shadows, Erica Kravid, the head of the highly successful tech conglomerate Renautas, has acquired Primatech with dark goals. As the number of Evos grows, some heroes of the past, including Hiro Nakamura, Matt Parkman, Mohinder Suresh, The Haitian Ren√©, Angela Petrelli, Micah Sanders, and Molly Walker, cross paths with the new, emerging Evos. Together, they must save the world from a geomagnetic reversal that will leave the planet vulnerable to lethal solar radiation. Heroes creator Tim Kring said in interviews that, rather than a direct continuation, Heroes Reborn takes place considerably after the events of the original series. He stated that \\"This is not the fifth season, this is actually the 10th season\\".

Reception  Heroes Reborn received mixed- to-negative reviews from television critics, with a critic score of 53 out of 100 on Metacritic. On Rotten Tomatoes it received a 43% fresh rating, where it was criticized for overuse of special effects and melodrama. About the show's reception, Kring said: \\"Well, when you make a show like that, I was adamant about that show being a thirteen-episode event series, and having a closed- ended quality to it. I had always felt that one of the issue with Heroes was the ongoing nature of it was difficult to sustain, so I really loved the idea that this was a thirteen-episode event series, and when it was over, it was over. I don‚Äôt know that the audience ever really understood that that was the initial plan from the very beginning. So I think that it got a little confusing for the audience as to whether it was a reboot of Heroes, or whether it was just an event series. As much as we tried to say it every time in the press, I think that message may not have completely come through, that it was always intended to come to an end. So in terms of how it wrapped up, I feel a little remorse that I think a lot of people didn‚Äôt understand that it was supposed to wrap up when it did. We actually really felt very good about what we accomplished with the thirteen episodes.\\" Home media releases Heroes Reborn - Event Series was released on DVD and Blu-ray disc on April 12, 2016 in Region 1 by Universal Studios Home Entertainment.

Jerome stepped down in early 2019; Tom Arey (Peter Wolf, Ghosts of Jupiter) has taken his place. History The band was officially formed in 2009, when Dana Colley was asked to bring a group to Nel Nome Del Rock Festival in Palestrina, Italy. Ten years earlier, Morphine's frontman Mark Sandman had suddenly died of a massive heart attack while performing in that venue. After some deliberation, Colley invited Jeremy Lyons to sing and play the 2-string slide bass, along with drummer Jerome Deupree. Lyons asked friend \\"Washtub\\" Robbie Phillips to build a 2-string bass for him and started learning the Morphine repertoire. The process wasn't easy as Lyons had to master a new instrument while singing below his natural vocal range. In the beginning, they couldn't agree on a name, and they alternated between ‚ÄúMembers of Morphine & Jeremy Lyons‚Äù and the ‚ÄúElastic Waste Band,‚Äù which eventually morphed into ‚ÄúThe Ever Expanding Elastic Waste Band‚Äù. Early in 2014 someone asked Lyons if he didn't ‚Äúplay with ... the ‚Äòvapors‚Äô of Morphine?‚Äù, inspiring the band's name as it is currently known. Vapors of Morphine have toured through the United States, South America, Europe and Russia. Some highlights have been successful European and South American tours in 2018 and '19; M√™s Da Cultura Independente (S√£o Paulo, Brazil, 2014), The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival (USA, 2012); Virada Cultural Festival in Sao Paulo, Brazil (2012), New Orleans‚Äô Voodoo Experience (USA, 2011); and Maquinaria Festival in Santiago, Chile (2011). Former Morphine drummer Billy Conway has played as a guest, filling in for Deupree or making the group a quartet. Studio drummer Jeff Allison filled in as drummer in 2012 when Deupree was suffering from tendonitis. A week after returning from Europe in November, 2018, Deupree informed his bandmates of his decision to leave the band, partly due to issues with tinnitus. (reference needed) He will be appearing on their upcoming album release, alongside Tom Arey.

At various stages he was a government minister and his country's ambassador to Czechoslovakia. Because of the way power in the German Democratic Republic was concentrated on the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands), Herbert Krolikowski's most important appointment almost certainly came in 1976 when he became one of the 145 members of the Central Committee of the SED (party). Life Herbert Krolikowski was born into a working-class family in a small industrial town near Breslau (as it was then known) in Lower Silesia, some four years before the birth of his brother Werner Krolikowski. He undertook a commercial apprenticeship and was in 1942 enrolled for Labour service which at this time meant joining the army. In 1945 he became a Soviet prisoner of war: while in captivity he attended an \\"Anti- fascist School\\". In November 1949 he was released to the newly founded German Democratic Republic, which till the previous month had still been designated the Soviet occupation zone in what remained of Germany. He obtained a clerical job with a Co-op in Malchin. In addition, from March till August 1950 he served as First Secretary of the local Society for German‚ÄìSoviet Friendship, also becoming an instructor and section head with the society's national head office in Berlin. In 1952/53 he served as personal assistant to the Society's national General Secretary, Gottfried Gr√ºnberg. Although the German Democratic Republic had been founded only in October 1949, the basis for a return to one- party government within the Soviet occupation zone had been established back in April 1946 with the establishment of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands). The creation of the party came about through a contentious merger in the area under Soviet Administration of the old Communist Party and the more moderately left-wing Social Democratic Party. The merger was in theory one of equals, but by the time the German Democratic Republic was formally founded in 1949 the positions of party influence and leadership were almost all held by men who, like Koenen, had been members of the Communist Party until 1946. Herbert Krolikowski joined what was by now the new country's ruling SED (party) in 1952. In 1954/55 he underwent a course of study at the Party Academy in Berlin. Herbert Krolikowski joined his country's diplomatic service in 1955: till 1958 he served as an attach√© and third secretary in the East German embassy in Moscow. From 1958 till 1960 he was an acting director and then in 1960/61 in charge for Europe Division 4 (i.e. Scandinavia) at the East German Ministry for Foreign Affairs. He undertook a course of correspondence study at the country's \\"Walter Ulbricht\\" Academy for Law and Political Sciences at Potsdam during 1956-58, giving rise to the award of a degree in 1959. From 1962/63 he moved to head up the ministerial department for Europe Division 1 (i.e. the Soviet Union) at the Foreign Ministry, being promoted in 1963 to the position of Deputy Foreign Minister. A further period of training followed from 1967 till 1969 at the Soviet Diplomatic Academy, leading to a doctorate. Dr. Krolikowski then served as his country's ambassador to Czechoslovakia in succession to Peter Florin and in the aftermath of the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of that country. He held this important diplomatic appointment from August 1969 till October 1973. At the eighth Party Congress in June 1971, Herbert Krolikowski's was one of the 54 names on the candidate list for membership of the SED Central Committee, and in May 1976, at the ninth party congress, he became one of the (by now) 145 Central Committee members. He retained his Central Committee membership till the mass resignation of the party Central Committee in December 1989, which took place in the context of the events leading to Germany reunification in October 1990. In terms of government positions, he was reappointed Deputy Foreign minister in November 1973, following his return from the Prague job, and in January 1975 became Secretary of State and First Minister for Foreign affairs - effectively deputy Foreign Minister \\\\- in succession to Oskar Fischer (who now headed up the foreign ministry). Krolikowski and Fischer both remained in post until 1990 and the final chapter in the forty-year existence of the German Democratic Republic. In April 1986 he was chosen for the position of Secretary General at the regular meeting of the Warsaw Pact Political Advisory Meeting for member states, held in Berlin. He handed over to the Polish Foreign Minister, Henryk Jaroszek in May 1987 ahead of the subsequent meeting.Neues Deutschland, 30. Mai 1987, p. 5.

Biography She was born Lydia Mackenzie Falconer to Elizabeth Lydia McLeod (d. 1865), a schoolteacher, and her husband, an Inverness-based merchant, William Fraser (1789‚Äì1828). She was baptised in 1812. After her father's business failed her mother's family helped pay for her education. She was schooled at Inverness Academy and later in Edinburgh, where she lodged with the musician George Thomson, a friend of the poet Robert Burns. After some time in England she returned to Scotland, setting up a small school in Cromarty, where her family then lived. In Cromarty she met Hugh Miller. Both were well read and intelligent; she had lived in Edinburgh's literary society. Her family objected but they were engaged in 1832 and they married on 7 January 1837. Together they had four surviving children. Her husband was appointed to manage the periodical The Witness in Edinburgh and Lydia assisted and wrote contributions for the publication. Under the pseudonym Mrs Harriet Myrtle, she wrote about 20 educational and moral stories for children which were often adventurous and light-hearted. In 1847 she anonymously published her only adult novel, Passages in the Life of an English Heiress, or, Recollections of Disruption Times in Scotland, the background drawn from her own and her husband's upbringing and their discussions.

It is found in shallow water in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Description Anthopleura thallia typically has a base about wide, a column about long and an oral disc wide. The lower part of the column has many sticky, cup-shaped warts in about 36 vertical rows. The margin of the column has several outgrowths of the body-wall known as acrorhagi, which are well armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells). On the oral disc there are two to four whorls of thirty to sixty tapering, blunt-tipped, fully retractile tentacles and a central mouth. The column is green, yellow or brown, the warts are red to brown and darker than the column. The oral disc is green to brown, paler near the mouth, with chevron-shaped markings, and the tentacles are the same colour as the column and sometimes barred with white. Distribution and habitat Anthopleura thallia is found on the coasts of Western Europe and in the Mediterranean Sea. It is an uncommon species and its range includes the Isle of Man, Ireland, the southwest of England, Normandy, Brittany, Galicia, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean Sea. Reports of its presence in Israel, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aqaba and Croatia are probably incorrect. It is found on rocky coasts with vigorous wave action, from the intertidal zone down to depths of about . The column is often buried in sand or concealed in a crevice, or may occur among mussels or under gravel, and usually has sedimentary particles or debris sticking to it. This fact helps to distinguish this species from the closely related red speckled anemone (Anthopleura ballii) which has a non-adhesive column. Biology Anthopleura thallia has a patchy distribution but is locally abundant. It is likely that it is clonal as many individuals are scarred, having undergone asexual reproduction by splitting longitudinally. No zooxanthellae are found in this species.

He was a two-time all-conference quarterback at North Texas State College from 1947 to 1950 and had previously started 1 game for the Texas Longhorns football team in 1944. He was drafted by the Washington Redskins in 1951 and played professionally for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in Canada during the 1951 season. He coached high school football for nearly a decade and then became a successful businessman, the mayor of Denton, Texas and a candidate for the Texas state legislature. Early life Martin was born in Denton, TX as the son of a carpenter and one of seven brothers. He was a three-sport high school athlete, winning honors in each. On the tennis team he won the 1941 County Class A singles Title, in basketball he was All-District in 1940 and 1941 and in Football he was 2nd team All-State in 1942. After graduation, Martin joined the Merchant Marines, in which he would remain for the next four years. Playing career =Texas= In 1944, Martin was a freshman football player at the University of Texas, backing up the legendary Bobby Layne on a team who's roster, like most school's, was thin due to World War II. Before the second game of the season, Layne was injured and Martin replaced him at quarterback against #4 Randolph Field. Randolph Field fielded a team of college all-stars that Texas and Martin had difficulty competing with. He threw 12 passes for 170 yards and 1 touchdown, but also threw a school record 5 interceptions in a game that Texas lost 42‚Äì6. The next week, with Layne back in the lineup, Martin threw a touchdown pass in a 20‚Äì0 win over Oklahoma, his last in a Longhorn jersey. A few days after the Oklahoma game, Martin re- entered the United States Coast Guard Maritime Service. Martin did not return to the University of Texas, but spent the intervening years involved in World War II and amateur sports. In the spring of 1946, he played center field for the amateur Denton Bears of the Brazos-Trinity Baseball League, one of many amateur leagues to form after World War II. The following winter, he was on the SMU basketball team, but did not play much. =North Texas= After four years, Martin was discharged from the Merchant Marines in 1947 and enrolled at the University of North Texas, where he would play football with future NFL Pro-Bowler Ray Renfro. The school was then known as North Texas State Teachers College and would change its name to North Texas State College in Martin's senior year. At UNT he was a four-year letterman, played quarterback, defensive back and punter and twice made the all-conference team as quarterback. In 1947, he started out as the #3 quarterback on the team, but eventual became the #2 quarterback backing up Fred McCain. North Texas, fresh off its first ever bowl win, won the Lone Star Conference title for the second year in a row and went 10‚Äì1 in the regular season. They beat the favored University of Florida, in Gainesville, and their only regular season blemish was a 12‚Äì0 loss to defending Southwest Conference champion Arkansas. The Eagles made their second straight bowl appearance, this time at the Salad Bowl in Phoenix, Arizona against Nevada. In that game they were down 13‚Äì6 late in the 4th quarter when Martin threw what would have been the game-tying touchdown pass, but the ball went right through the hands on the intended receiver, and the Eagles lost. Though no official statistics exist for the season, Martin threw at least 3 touchdown passes for at least 46 yards. With McCain's graduation, Martin took over as starting quarterback in 1948. There are no official statistics available for Martin in 1947 or 1948, but according to media reports, he threw for 755 yards, 2nd best in the conference, and rushed for 32. With three games left, he had 5 touchdowns and scored one more in the last game for a total of 6. The team went 6‚Äì4 that year, and Martin was able to get revenge on Randolph AFB for his 1944 outing at Texas by leading North Texas to an 86‚Äì0 victory over them. In 1949, North Texas' first year in the Gulf Coast Conference, Martin led the conference in passing and made the All-Gulf Coast Conference team. He went 71 of 179, for 1,416 yards and 18 touchdowns and had an average punt distance of 38.9 yards. North Texas went 8‚Äì4 for the season. After his strong 1949 season, Martin was considered a candidate for the Little All-American team in his senior year. He put up solid numbers, and in early October was the leading passer among small college quarterbacks. By the end of the season, he had completed 68 passes for 1106 yards and 6 touchdowns. He was not an All-American but did make the All- Conference team for the second year in a row. The Eagles went 7‚Äì2‚Äì1 and were co-champions of the Gulf Coast Conference. Against Tennessee-Chattanooga, Martin engineered a come-from-behind touchdown driving, scoring with a 12-yard pass in the closing seconds to win 19‚Äì14. And the following week against Houston, he again marshaled a 4th-quarter come-from-behind drive, throwing three straight complete passes, including the game-winning touchdown to put North Texas up 16‚Äì13. Martin graduated in 1951 with, officially, 2,522 passing yards over his career, but that only includes the last two years because no official records exist before 1949. Including his reported yards from 1947 and 1948, he threw for at least 3,323 career passing yards, enough for the school record at the time and 8th all-time at North Texas. Using his official and reported numbers, he also graduated as the career leader in touchdown passes with at least 33, and now sits at 6th in school history. Both records lasted until the end of the 1960s. In addition to football, Martin played tennis and basketball for North Texas. He was inducted into the North Texas Athletic Hall of Fame in 1989. He was also a candidate for the North Texas All-Century Football Team. =Pro football= Martin was drafted by the Redskins in the 23rd round of the 1951 NFL Draft as the 268th pick, but it's unclear if he ever signed a contract or attended camp with them. He was signed to play professional football with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union, a precursor to the Canadian Football League. He played in two games for the team in September of 1951, but he was cut on October 1, the league deadline for trimming foreign-born players on the roster down to seven. At one point, Couch Carl Voyles had considered Martin to be the team's #1 quarterback, but the need to limit Americans resulted in the cut. Nonetheless, Martin was paid for a full season of play. =Records= * UT ‚Äì Most interceptions, game (5), tied by Todd Dodge, Bret Stafford and Garrett Gilbert * UNT ‚Äì Passing yards, career (3,323), surpassed by Steve Ramsey in 1969 * UNT ‚Äì Touchdown passes, career (33), surpassed by Ramsey in 1969 Bold means active Coaching and refereeing When his pro football career was over, Martin put his master's degree in education to use and became a high school coach and teacher. He was a basketball and football coach at Denison High School during the 1951‚Äì1952 school year and then moved to his alma mater in Denton to coach the same sports as well as tennis and golf. He replaced head coach Walt Parker, who was serving an 18-month stint in the Air Force, for a year as interim head coach in 1952 and then following Parker's return, spent a year as a line coach. When Parker resigned the following February, Martin was immediately promoted to head football coach. He was the head coach from 1954‚Äì1960 during which time Denton went 14‚Äì34‚Äì2. Martin was an active football official. He worked at both the high school and college level officiating games in the Southwest Conference and the Missouri Valley Conference. Business and politics In 1960, Martin started Martin-Eagle Oil Company which he grew from a single service station to a multimillion-dollar business with over 40 stations. On the same site as his original gas station he also owned Mean Green Grocery and a hamburger restaurant called Zeke's Drive-in, where Mean Joe Greene often ate while he was in college. He also owned real estate, a washateria and an apartment building. After a few years in business, he went into politics. In 1967, he was elected to the Denton City Council and was promptly appointed Mayor by the council. As mayor he helped repair streets in Southeast Denton, get I-35 expanded west to Fort Worth and build a new City Hall. In 1968, he was the Republican nominee for the Texas House District 50 seat in the Texas legislature. His opponent was none other than Walt Parker, the man Martin had coached under in 1953 and replaced as head coach at Denton the following year. Martin lost that race, Parker served for 10 years, and in 1969, Martin stepped down as Mayor because the unpaid job was taking up too much of his time. In 1976, he was involved in a high-profile fight with the University of North Texas over a lot he owned that they sought to condemn for a parking lot. The lot was once the Martin family home site and at the time hosted several of his businesses. Late in the year, they reached an amicable settlement for the land. Family and later life Martin married his college sweetheart Bettye Lassiter in Houston in 1949. They had two children Steve and Gary. After his service in the Merchant Marines, he continued to serve in the Naval Reserves. Martin was involved in much of the civic life in Denton. He founded Little League baseball in Denton, served as Director of the Chamber of Commerce, and organized a charity golf tournament for the UNT athletic department that bears his name, among others. In November 2006, Martin was driving alone to a retired football coach's luncheon when he was involved in a car accident that claimed his life. He died in Fort Worth on November 27, 2006 and was buried in Denton.

History Nikolai Golovanov is a graduate of the Mechanical Engineering department of Bauman Moscow State Technical University as a designer of space launch vehicles. Upon his graduation, he began with the Kolomna Engineering Design bureau, which at the time employed the future founders of ASCON, Alexander Golikov and Tatiana Yankina. While at the bureau, Dr Golovanov developed software for analyzing the strength and stability of shell structures. In 1989, Alexander Golikov and TatianaYankina left Kolomna to start up ASCON as a private company. Although they began with just an electronic drawing board, even then they were already conceiving the idea of three-dimensional parametric modeling. This radical concept eventually changed flat drawings into three-dimensional models. The ASCON founders shared their ideas with Nikolai Golovanov, and in 1996 he moved to take up his current position with ASCON. Today he continues to develop algorithms in C3D Toolkit.

She is also a member of the Arbitration Commission of the Bulgarian Rhythmic Gymnastics Federation. In 2005, she was a candidate (backed by BSP and a number of other parties) to become mayor of the capital city, losing out to Boyko Borisov in the second decisive electoral round of the municipal elections. After being unable to stake a strong enough claim for the leadership position of BSP at the party congress in October 2009, Doncheva founded the PP \\"Movement 21\\" in April 2010, which does not constitute a political party, but represents the activism of citizens. Tatyana Doncheva ran in the 2016 Bulgarian Presidential Elections. She speaks English and Russian in addition to her native Bulgarian. Political views Tatyana Doncheva is a vocal opponent against corruption and argues in favor of reforms in Bulgaria's justice system. Recently, she raised concern about the anti-constitutional amendments to Bulgaria's Code of Criminal Procedure which were passed by the Bulgarian Parliament in August 2017. Doncheva was worried that the new changes create more possibilities for repression: for instance, one of the new provisions permits an investigation to be kept open indefinitely. Previously, she had argued that Bulgaria's Prosecution acts like \\"a shah from the Middle Ages.\\" She also warned that Bulgaria's Prosecutor General Sotir Tsatsarov abuses his office and attacks businessmen for personal reasons. In the summer of 2017, Doncheva suspected that Tsatsarov was working towards extending his already excessive powers through negotiations behind the curtain. Sotir Tsatsarov has recently been nominated for sanctions under the US Magnitsky Act.

Bucklebury Manor has been listed as Grade II by English Heritage since 22 November 1983. History =Manorial status= The land on which the house stands was originally part of the Bucklebury Estate, belonging to the Winchcombe family and their descendants for many generations. In 1830, their home, Bucklebury House, was gutted by fire and demolished shortly afterwards, leaving only servants‚Äô quarters and associated outbuildings standing. In the mid-1830s, Winchcombe Henry Howard Hartley had a smaller Georgian manor house built on the higher ground immediately south of the old house, calling it ‚ÄòThe Cottage‚Äô. The Hartley family then mostly lived on their estates in Gloucestershire. However, shortly before these were sold in 1906, the chief heiress to the estates, Mrs Nina Webley-Parry, moved to the Cottage and renamed it ‚ÄòBucklebury Manor‚Äô. =Post-manorial house= The Winchcombe descendants finally left the Manor and it ceased to be the local manor house when Major Derrick Hartley Russell restored the buildings at old Bucklebury House in 1957. In 2012, Bucklebury Manor and its grounds were purchased by Michael and Carole Middleton, the parents of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.

Hart, Ethel Grey Terry, Kathleen O'Connor, James Farley, Jack Gardner, Carl Gerard, and William Dyer. It was written by William S. Hart and J.G. Hawks. The film was released on November 18, 1923, by Paramount Pictures. It was the first film to depict Wyatt Earp, although in a very brief role, and the only film made before he died in 1929 that included his character, until Law and Order was released in 1932. Plot After the America Civil War ends, key military and government leaders meet in Washington D.C. Gunfighter Wild Bill Hickok (William Hart) goes to Dodge City where he hangs up his gun belt and takes over a card table. Local lawmen are unable to rid the town of lawless cowboys. Hickok's arch-enemy and gang leader Jack McQueen (Jim Farley) accuses Hickok of losing his nerve. Hickok visits General Custer and retrieves his sword, taking up his role as a fighter for what is right. He returns to Dodge City and enlists the help of friends Wyatt Earp, Calamity Jane, Bat Masterson, Doc Holliday, Charlie Bassett, Luke Short and Bill Tilghman to chase the bad guys out of town. Hickcok falls for the wife of George Hamilton (Carl Gerard). Pursued for his crimes, McQueen leaves town and gets away; follows him and kills him. Hickok departs Dodge City in sorrow since the woman he loved was already married. Characters Movie still of Bert Lindley as Wyatt Earp William S. Hart, who played Wild Bill Hickok, and Wyatt Earp were best friends. Earp wanted Hart's help to make a movie that would improve what the public thought about him and his brothers. Based on what the press wrote about his actions at the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and his job as a referee of the Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey boxing match, Earp had a dubious reputation. Earp wrote Hart in July 1925: \\"I am sure that if the story were exploited on the screen by you, it would do much towards setting me right before the public which has always been fed up with lies about me.\\" Bert Lindley playing Wyatt Earp appeared very briefly in a crowd scene. This was the first movie that depicted Wyatt Earp, and the only one that included his character before he died in 1929. Hollywood didn't make another film that referenced his character until Law and Order in 1932. Cast Marketing The film premiered in New York city on November 18, two weeks before its public release on December 3, 1923. Despite his very small role, Earp was prominently featured in the promotional copy as \\"Deputy Sheriff to Bat Masterson of Dodge City, known as one of the three greatest gun-men that ever lived, along with Bat Masterson and 'Wild Bill' Hickok... Back in the days when the West was young and wild, 'Wild Bill' fought and loved and adventured with such famous frontiersmen as Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp.\\" In reality, Earp was a virtually unknown assistant marshal in Dodge City when Wild Bill Hickok was murdered in 1876. Earp served as a technical adviser on the film. Because the role of Earp's character in the movie is so small, Bert Lindley is not listed on some descriptions of the movie and this portrayal of Earp is often overlooked. Alan Barra, author of Inventing Wyatt Earp: His Life and Many Legends, overlooked this movie in his biography. Hart thought a great deal of Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson, and after Masterson's death in 1921, dedicated his next film, Wild Bill Hickok to Masterson. Reception The film was not well received. One reviewer described it as \\"rather dull and tedious.\\" The film's poor box office draw helped end Hart's already fading star.

It has a surface area of approximately 621.5 acres, or nearly a square mile. The lake is situated entirely within the borough of Harveys Lake. By volume, it is the largest natural lake in Pennsylvania, and by surface area, is the second-largest lake. It is a glacial lake surrounded by hills and is the source of Harveys Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna River. The lake has a stone masonry dam. The lake's watershed has an area of approximately 3600 acres. The majority of the watershed is forested, but there is some developed land as well. Nearly all of the developed land is close to the lake itself, and the lake is surrounded entirely by a paved road. Harveys Lake was affected by algae blooms from the mid-20th century onward, and these algae blooms were caused by pollution of nutrients, especially phosphorus. The lake was identified as impaired in 1994, with an annual phosphorus load of . However, the phosphorus load has been reduced somewhat since then. The lake is listed on the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory. A number of rare or endangered plant species have been observed in its vicinity. Various species of fish inhabit the lake and a number of bird species have been observed in its vicinity. Harveys Lake was accidentally discovered by Benjamin Harvey in 1781. The first settlers arrived at the lake in the 1790s and 1800s. Early industries in the area included lumbering and farming, but it became well known as a summer resort in the latter part of the 1800s and into the 1900s. It was also used as a water supply in the early 1900s. However, the lake began to develop significant environmental problems in the 1960s and a total maximum daily load was created for it in 1994. Since 1968, the lake has been located in the borough of Harveys Lake. Geography Harveys Lake dam Harveys Lake is the largest natural lake in Pennsylvania by volume and the second-largest by surface area. It has a surface area of 621.5 acres and an average depth of 36 feet (11 meters), as well as a maximum depth of . The lake's shoreline is long. By surface area, it was approximately twice its current size when it was first surveyed in the late 1700s. Harveys Lake is situated in the borough of Harveys Lake, and it is northwest of the city of Wilkes-Barre. Harveys Lake is of glacial origin. It is surrounded by steep hills on all sides. At their highest point, to the south of the lake, the hills reach above the lake's elevation. The lake has a gravel bottom. The main outflow of Harveys Lake is Harveys Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna River. The lake's major inflows include two unnamed streams with widths between and depths of . Springs also feed into it. The lake's elevation is above sea level. The lake is located in north- central Luzerne County, in the Lower North Branch Susquehanna drainage basin and the Upper Susquehanna - Lackawanna basin. A 1921 book described the shape of Harveys Lake as \\"very irregular\\". The lake has a maximum length of and a maximum width of . It has a capacity of . Harveys Lake is dammed by a stone masonry dam with two spillways. The dam is long and high. Harveys Lake was described as \\"one of the most beautiful\\" lakes in Pennsylvania in Henry C. Bradsby's 1893 book History of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. Watershed Satellite imagery of Harveys Lake Harveys Lake from the north Harveys Lake is situated in the United States Geological Survey quadrangles of Harveys Lake and Noxen. The watershed of the lake has an area of . Most of the watershed is in Luzerne County, but its northeasternmost portion is in Wyoming County. The vast majority () of the watershed of Harveys Lake is forested land. Developed land and farmland comprise and , respectively. Unpaved roads make up of the watershed. The majority of the developed land in the watershed is directly on the shoreline and nearly all is within of the lake. Most of the developed land is used for residential and commercial purposes. One developed area in the watershed is known as Hemlock Gardens, which occupies an area of and has 26 homes. The development had steep slopes (8 to 18 percent grade), unpaved roads, and no infrastructure for dealing with stormwater. However, a nutrient-separating baffle box and a water polishing unit were installed in the development, reducing the phosphorus load of Harveys Lake by an estimated per year. The shoreline of Harveys Lake is entirely surrounded by a paved road, which is atypical for a lake shoreline. Homes and cottages are situated on the road opposite the lake, and significant development has occurred in the vicinity of the lake. A ditch and outlet drainage structure made of concrete at Wardens Place drains into the lake; its purpose is to control small-scale local road flooding. Hydrology Although Harveys Lake's waters were described as having \\"great purity\\" in 1893, the lake has experienced nutrient pollution, especially from phosphorus since at least the mid-20th century. Algae blooms occurred on the lake and caused a reduction in water quality throughout the latter half of the 20th century. A sewage system was installed in the borough of Harveys Lake in the summer of 1976, but this did not completely stop the algae blooms. However, the phosphorus load in the lake has been reduced by 29 percent. The lake was identified as impaired in 1994, with the cause of the impairment being large algae blooms and sedimentation in some areas. It is an anoxic lake. In the 1990s, the concentration of phosphorus in the waters of Harveys Lake was measured to be 0.031 milligrams per liter. The annual load of phosphorus was per year. The lake's total maximum daily load for phosphorus is 0.024 milligrams per liter and per year. In the 1990s, of the annual phosphorus load of Harveys Lake came from internal loading, came from groundwater, came from developed land, and came from shorelines. Smaller sources of phosphorus included farmland ( per year), forests ( per year), septic systems ( per year), and unpaved roads ( per year). The hydraulic residence time of Harveys Lake is 1116 days. The lake causes substantially reduced peak flood flows on Harveys Creek. Visibility in the lake is typically approximately . However, it can be as low as or as high as . History and recreation Boats on Harveys Lake Harveys Lake was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1200085. Lake Township is named after the lake. Harveys Lake is named after Benjamin Harvey, a member of the Sons of Liberty and among the first settlers of the Wyoming Valley. Harvey inadvertently discovered the lake in 1781, while returning home after being held as a prisoner of war in Fort Niagara. The first resident in the vicinity of the lake was Matthew Scouten, who arrived in the early 1790s, but the first settlers were the Worthingtons, who arrived in 1806. The lake was first surveyed by Christopher Hurlbert in 1794, and the first person of European descent to explore the lake by canoe was Andrew Bennett, in 1800. The early settlers in the vicinity of Harveys Lake mainly engaged in lumbering and farming, which was a common occupation. At one point during the 1800s, the mills of Hollenback & Urquhart were cutting more than a million board feet of lumber annually at the lake. However, by 1853, summer resorts used by Wyoming Valley residents began appearing near the lake. Hotels such as the Lake House Hotel and later the Rhoads Hotel, the Lake Grove Hotel, and the Grand Hotel Oneonta were among the hotels on the lake in the late 1800s. Grand Hotel Oneonta was especially prominent in the early 1900s, and former United States President Theodore Roosevelt visited the hotel in August 1912. In the early 1900s, there were three hotels, two hundred cottages, and sixty boathouses on the lake, most of them at least above the water line. The Harvey Lake and Towanda Branch of the Lehigh Valley Railroad was constructed in the late 1800s. It ran directly from Wilkes-Barre to Harveys Lake. In the 1890s, railroad lines were constructed from the lake to the communities of Pittston and Towanda. Harveys Lake has been popular for recreational purposes since the late 1800s. Places such as Warden Place and Sandy Beach were popular recreational areas near the lake in the early 1900s. Around this time period, there were four steamboats on Harveys Lake. They were used for carrying passengers and freight. Recreational steamboat rides on the lake were popular between 1900 and 1920. A 60-foot (18-meter) high Shoot the Chute was built in the area by Charles Shelley in 1910. It was one of the largest attractions in the lake's vicinity. A casino near the lake was opened by Frank Devlin in May 1924, but was demolished in 1980. Devlin also opened the largest bowling alley in northeast Pennsylvania near the lake. Throughout the 20th century, prior to and after World War II, the lake attracted thousands of visitors yearly. In the early 1900s, Harveys Lake was used as a water supply for Nanticoke, as a private ice supply, and as a summer resort. Harveys Lake has been the subject of scientific studies since the late 1940s, when C. B. Reif conducted limnological studies on it. By the 1960s, Harveys Lake began to develop environmental problems. It was the subject of a number of studies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These studies indicated that the lake was eutrophic. Algae blooms caused it to be closed to swimming in 1981 and 1990. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection completed a phosphorus TMDL for the lake in 2002. In modern times, the main recreational uses of Harveys Lake include swimming, fishing, and boating. However, it lacks public access locations for SCUBA diving. According to its TMDL document, the lake is \\"one of the most heavily used lakes in the area\\". It has been situated within the borough of Harveys Lake since January 1, 1968, when the borough was incorporated. In 2004, a plan to dredge and develop a patch of wetland for 30 boat slips near the lake was opposed due to safety concerns (poor visibility) as well as environmental concerns. =Historical gallery= File:East Side Harveys Lake, PA.jpgA view of the east side of Harveys Lake, ca 1907.

Numerous rare or endangered plant species have been observed in the vicinity of Harveys Lake. Plants in the vicinity of the lake include Vasey's pondweed, flat-leaved pondweed, grassy pondweed, broad-leaved water-milfoil, and Beck's water- marigold. However, exotic and invasive plants such as fanwort and aquatic coontail also inhabit the area and have altered the habitat in the vicinity of the lake. Second-growth forests occur in the area surrounding the lake. Algae blooms have occurred on Harveys Lake due to high levels of nutrients in the water. Harveys Lake is inhabited by various species of native fish of Pennsylvania. In 1972, Field and Stream noted that the lake was inhabited by rainbow trout, sockeye salmon, and some lake trout. As the basin of Harveys Creek upstream of the tributary Pikes Creek is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery, the lake itself has the same designation. Harveys Lake has regulations permitting a creel limit of three trout per day, with only one being allowed to be more than long. Various bird species have been observed in the vicinity of Harveys Lake. These include surf scoters and black scoters, which have been observed there in the winter. Although greater scaups are rare in Pennsylvania away from Lake Erie, one was observed at the lake in July 1992. Franklin's gulls have also been observed near the lake, as have snow buntings and black-legged kittiwakes, and ruddy ducks. Nine brant geese were observed on the lake in May 1997.

First founded as the North Carolina Historical Commission in 1903, the State Archives has undergone multiple changes in organization, title, and relation to other state agencies. Since May 2012, it has been known as the Division of Archives and Records within the North Carolina Department of Natural & Cultural Resources' Office of Archives and History. The State Archives includes four sections: Collection Services, Government Records, Digital Services, and Special Collections. The Outer Banks History Center (Manteo, N.C.), Western Regional Archives (Asheville, N.C.), and the main site at 109 East Jones Street in Raleigh account for the Archives' three locations open to the public. The State Archives' Government Records Section is responsible for administering records management services to state government agencies, local government agencies, and state-supported institutions of higher education in North Carolina, in accordance with its legislative mandates in General Statutes 121 and 132.G.S. 121, Archives and HistoryG.S. 132, Public Records As part of its records management program, the Government Records Section is responsible for managing the State Records Center. The State Archives houses over 50,000 linear feet of materials documenting North Carolina history, including government records and non-government materials. Government materials include records from state agencies, counties, and limited municipal records. Special collection materials (non-government materials) include individual and family papers (including extensive military collections), organizational records, records of defunct North Carolina educational institutions, and audio-visual collections. The State Archives currently collects government records in all formats, including born-digital materials ranging from documents, photographs, and videos to web archives and social media archives. It collaborates with the State Library of North Carolina to manage the North Carolina Digital Repository, which provides long-term archival preservation for born-digital and digitized government and non-government records and materials. History =Founding= The earliest predecessor of the State Archives was the North Carolina Historical Commission, founded in 1903 by the General Assembly in response to a request by the State Literary and Historical Association. North Carolina's Historical Commission was the third state historical agency founded in the U.S., following the 1901 founding of the Alabama Department of Archives and History and the 1902 founding of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. Originally composed of five gubernatorial appointees and given an annual budget of $500, the Historical Commission was asked to \\"collect, edit and publish valuable documents elucidating the history of the State.\\" It gained its first secretary R. D. W. Connor in 1907. Connor would go on to serve as the first Archivist of the United States. =Legislation= 1903 - The North Carolina Historical Commission was formed by Chapter 767 of the North Carolina Public Laws. 1907 - Among other changes, an amendment to the original act charged the commission with new duties, including marking and preserving historic sites and encouraging the study of North Carolina history. 1935 - The General Assembly charged the commission with a new duty, to safeguard public records that no longer had \\"significance, importance, or value.\\" This new responsibility was codified in Chapter 265 of Public Law, \\"An Act to Safeguard Public Records in North Carolina,\\" which defined public records within North Carolina and made it illegal to sell, loan, or destroy public records without the permission of the Historical Commission.An Act to Safeguard Public Records in North Carolina, ch. 265, 1935 N.C. Sess. Laws 288 (codified as amended at N.C. GEN. STAT. ¬ß¬ß 132-1 to -10); accessible online at http://digital.ncdcr.gov/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll22/id/240561. This act served as the state's first public records law. For a more in-depth review if North Carolina public records law, see Thomas H. Moore, You Can‚Äôt Always Get What You Want: A Look at North Carolina‚Äôs Public Records Law, 72 N.C. L REV. 1527 (1993) 1961 - Chapter 132 of the NC General Statutes (G.S. 132), known as the Public Records Act, replaced the 1935 legislation as the state's public records law. Along with defining public records (including electronic records) and specifying rules for the management of those records, the act expanded the State Archives' responsibilities for records management. 1973 - Chapter 121 of the NC General Statutes (G.S. 121), known as the Archives and History Act, made the Department of Cultural Resources (the new parent agency of the State Archives) the official \\"archival and historical agency of the State of North Carolina.\\" The law defined the powers and duties of the department, including the programs of the State Archives. G.S. 121, along with G.S. 132, set forth the legislative mandates of the State Archives. =Name changes= In 1943, the General Assembly changed the name of the Historical Commission to the State Department of Archives and History. The newly minted Department continued to have a governing board, which would now be called the Executive Board of Archives and History.Wegner, Ansley (2003). History for All the People: 100 Years of Public History in North Carolina. Raleigh, NC: North Carolina Office of Archives and History. p. 27. In 1971, Governor Scott initiated an administrative reorganization to consolidate state agencies. As part of this consolidation, in February 1972, the Department of Archives and History merged with several other departments to form the new Department of Cultural Resources (briefly known as the Department of Art, Culture, and History from February 1972 to May 1973). Under this new department, the former Department of Archives and History came to be known as the Division of Archives and History, now a unit within the Department of Cultural Resources.Wegner, Ansley (2003). History for All the People: 100 Years of Public History in North Carolina. Raleigh, NC: North Carolina Office of Archives and History. p. 57 - 58. The new Division of Archives and History was a large and expanding division, and in 1972 several sections were formed, including the Archives and Records Section.Wegner, Ansley (2003). History for All the People: 100 Years of Public History in North Carolina. Raleigh, NC: North Carolina Office of Archives and History. p. 66. The Archives and Records Section, informally known as the \\"State Archives,\\" continued operating under this name through May 2012, when the State Archives became its own departmental division, the Division of Archives and Records. During a similar period, the State Archives began referring to itself as the State Archives of North Carolina (instead of the North Carolina State Archives, which was often confused with the North Carolina State University archives).See the difference between the March 23, 2012 version of the website (North Carolina State Archives): https://wayback.archive- it.org/all/20120323232925/http://www.archives.ncdcr.gov/ with the May 14, 2012 version (State Archives of North Carolina): https://wayback.archive- it.org/all/20120514224913/http://www.archives.ncdcr.gov/ =Bill of Rights= In 1865, North Carolina's copy of the United States Bill of Rights was stolen from the state Capitol building by a Union soldier in William Sherman's army, who took the document home to Tippecanoe, Ohio, as a souvenir of the war. The soldier, whose name is unknown, sold the Bill of Rights to a Charles A. Shotwell of Troy, Ohio, for $5.00. It was not returned to North Carolina until Governor Mike Easley and state Attorney General Roy Cooper worked with the U.S. Attorney to obtain the document through an FBI sting operation in 2003. Online Resources Much of the State Archives' materials can only be accessed at one of its three sites. However, a large body of materials can be found online, and online finding aids and catalog can help researchers identify materials that are available only onsite. =North Carolina Digital Collections= The North Carolina Digital Collections portal contains over 90,000 historic and recent photographs, state government publications, manuscripts, and other resources on topics related to North Carolina. The collections are free and full-text searchable, and bring together content from the State Archives of North Carolina and the State Library of North Carolina. =Catalog= The State Archives online catalog is called MARS, the Manuscript and Archives Reference System.

The blade of the Sword dates back to the 10th century, to the times of St. Wenceslaus. Together with the Coronation Cross it is sometimes considered to be a part of the Bohemian Crown Jewels. Unlike the proper crown jewels, the sword and the cross are permanently displayed as part of the Treasury of St. Vitus Cathedral in the Holy Cross Chapel at the Prague Castle.  History  St. Wenceslas Sword Until the 19th century it was believed that the sword was an authentic weapon used by Duke Wenceslas in the 10th century. Later, the sword was considered to be Gothic, made in the 14th century probably by Charles IV who made the new ceremonial crown, which was also dedicated to the main Czech patron saint, St. Wenceslaus. However, a recent detailed technological examination of the sword confirmed that the sword blade was made in the early Middle Ages (probably in the 10th century) and the sword thus really could have belonged to St. Wenceslas. The cross on the blade was probably made later in the Middle Ages and the guard and pommel were added perhaps in the 13th century. In the treasure of St. Vitus Cathedral there are preserved also a helmet and mail shirt, which most likely are Wenceslas‚Äô original armor as well. The sword was first mentioned in 1333 in the articles of inventory of the Treasury of the St. Vitus Cathedral. It is not clear when the sword was first used during coronations but in the Coronation Ordo written by Charles IV (maybe in 1347), the sword already had its ceremonial role. The sword was carried by the supreme marshal of the Bohemian Kingdom in front of the king alongside the other crown jewels in the ceremonial procession to the main altar of Prague Cathedral. Before the king was crowned, he was given the blessed sword for a while and after the coronation itself, the sword was used for the purpose of granting knighthoods at the end of the coronation Mass.  Description  The Coronation Sword as part of the Czech Crown Jewels The iron blade length is 76 cm, at the widest point is 45 mm and has a ripped hole in a cross shape (45 x 20 mm). The wooden handle is covered with yellow-brown fabric and velvet embroidered with the ornament of laurel twigs with thick silver thread.

The book was originally written as an entertainment for Riley's wife and two recently bereaved friends, the Bolton sisters, to be read to them in weekly episodes during 1911 and 1912. The story concerns young artist and photographer, Grace Holden, who moves from London to spend a year in the small Yorkshire village of Windyridge. In 1928 Riley wrote a sequel, Windyridge Revisited, which remained in print until 1949. Riley's obituaries on his death in 1961 described him as \\"the famous Bradford-born author of Windyridge and 34 other novels\\" and \\"the author who established himself with his first novel, Windyridge\\". After moving to Silverdale in 1919, Riley renamed his house there \\"Windyridge\\", a name it still retains. The name became fashionable as a house name and was widely used.

She claimed he had secretly married her three years earlier in a private contract. She was known to carry a small- caliber Colt revolver in her purse and did not hesitate to threaten all who crossed her. The divorce case and related law suits set legal precedent and spawned numerous spinoff lawsuits that dragged on for nearly a decade. Two months after Sharon died, she married her attorney David S. Terry.  Early years  Hill was born in Pleasant Hill, Missouri, the daughter of attorney Samuel H. Hill and Julia Sloan. Her older brother was Hiram Morgan Hill, for whom the California town of Morgan Hill is named. Both of their parents died while they were minors, leaving them to be cared for by relatives. When they came of age, they received $20,000 (or about $ today) each as their inheritance from their parents.Robin C. Johnson, Enchantress, Sorceress, Madwoman: The True Story of Sarah Althea Hill, Adventuress of Old San Francisco (California Venture Books, 2014). . In 1871, at the age of 21, Hill came to San Francisco with her brother, where they lived with their relatives, William and Ada Bryan. In 1880, she had a love affair with attorney Reuben H. Lloyd. When he ended the affair, she attempted suicide on May 10, 1880 in his office by drinking poison. She was saved when her stomach was pumped.  San Francisco socialite  In the fall of 1880, at age 30, Hill met millionaire Senator William Sharon, the president of the Bank of California, the owner of the Palace Hotel, and other properties. At the time, he was 60, a widower, and one of the richest men in the country. He gave her $500 (about $ today) per month and a room in the San Francisco Grand Hotel, adjoining the Palace Hotel where he lived, for the pleasure of her companionship. After just over a year, he tried to end the relationship, but she would not agree. He finally evicted her from the room by having the carpets ripped up and the door hinges removed, along with a $7,500 (around $) payment. When he began a relationship with another woman, she claimed to be his wife and sued him for divorce, claiming adultery. One of her attorneys was David Terry. Sharon claimed he had hired Hill merely as his mistress. Hill produced a marriage contract dated August 20, 1880, and said Sharon had sworn her to secrecy for two years. His reasons, she testified, were that he was up for re-election and could not afford the scandal that would result when his mistress back east heard about the marriage.‚ÄúSharon‚Äôs Dirty Duds,‚Äù San Francisco Chronicle, 19 March 1884, p. 4. Sharon countersued, claiming that the marriage contract she produced was fraudulent.In Re Neagle  Sharon vs. Sharon  As was the custom at the time, U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Fields was assigned to assist the California Circuit Court. He was coincidentally assigned to the Sharon vs. Sharon case. After William Sharon died on November 13, 1885, his son and son- in-law carried on the case. Hill/Sharon produced a handwritten will that she said she had found in his desk. Many were suspicious of its authenticity. It gave her all of Sharon's estate. Hill's expenses were primarily bankrolled by her friend, Mary Ellen Pleasant, an elderly black entrepreneur. The lawsuit propelled Hill into the national spotlight and earned her the nickname, The Rose of Sharon. She married her attorney Terry on January 7, 1886 in Stockton.DeArment, Robert K. Lawman Neagle Ably Defended a Judge U.S. Census Year: 1880; Census Place: Tucson, Pima, Arizona; Roll: 36; Page: 334D; Enumeration District: 039 In January 1886, a U.S. Circuit Court Judge and a U.S. District Court Judge sitting as a Circuit Judge rendered a decision against the defendants. They ruled that the marriage contract was a forgery and required the plaintiffs to turn over the document so that it could be nullified by the court. The Terrys refused to comply with the Court's order and were jailed. They returned to the court in March 1888, seeking further relief. On September 3, 1888, Field delivered the final Circuit Court opinion. He ruled that the will was a forgery. Sarah Althea Hill suddenly stood up, screamed obscenities at the judge, and fumbled in her handbag for her revolver. When Marshal John Franks and others attempted to escort her from the courtroom, attorney Terry rose to defend his wife and drew his Bowie knife. He hit Franks, knocking out a tooth, and the marshals drew their handguns. Spectators subdued Terry and led him out of the courtroom, where he pulled his Bowie knife and threatened all around him. David Neagle was among the Marshals present and put his pistol in Terry's face. Both Terrys were subdued and placed under arrest. Justice Field had them returned to the courtroom and sentenced both to jail for contempt of court. David Terry got six months in jail, and Sarah Terry got one month.‚ÄúTerry‚Äôs Petition,‚Äù Daily Alta California, 18 September 1888, p 1. While being transported to jail and while serving their sentences, Terry and his wife repeatedly threatened Justice Field. The Terrys suffered several more setbacks. Both David and Althea were indicted by a federal grand jury on criminal charges arising out of their behavior in the courtroom before Justice Field. In May 1889, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the order that invalidated Althea Terry's marriage contract with Senator Sharon. Then, in July, with only one of the four judges who had earlier ruled in their favor, the California Supreme Court reversed itself. It ruled that because Althea Terry and Sharon had kept their alleged marriage a secret, they were never legally married. While in jail or shortly afterward, pregnant Althea suffered a miscarriage. Hill initially won the first case in December 1884. Judge Jeremiah F. Sullivan declared her the legal wife of William Sharon and awarded her alimony and the right to half of his accumulated wealth since the date of their marriage.‚ÄúThe Sharon Case,‚Äù San Francisco Chronicle, 25 December 1884, p. 3. Because of continuing counter- suits and appeals, Hill never received any of Sharon's money. William Sharon died in November 1885. Hill produced a handwritten will, supposedly made not long before his death, that she said she found in his desk. Those who knew Sharon doubted it's authenticity. It gave Sharon's entire estate to Hill and nothing to his son Frederick and son-in-law Frank Newlands. On January 7, 1886, Hill married one of her lawyers, former California Supreme Court Justice David Smith Terry. Terry was well known for killing Senator David C. Broderick in a duel in 1859. Hill and Terry were married at St. Mary's Church in Stockton, California, Terry's home town.‚ÄúMrs. Terry,‚Äù Daily Alta California, 8 January 1886, p. 1. The Sharon family continued to fight Hill.

Lathrop, California rail road station in 1889 = Attack expected = The newspapers followed the case and repeatedly speculated about the likelihood of an attack on Field. When Field returned to California as a circuit riding judge for the 9th Circuit Court again the next year, U.S. Attorney General William Miller instructed Marshal Franks on May 6, 1889 to appoint Neagle as a Marshal with the responsibility to protect Field. = Terry killed = When David and Althea Terry were released from jail, they returned to Fresno. On August 14, 1889, they boarded a train in Fresno on which unknown to them Field and Neagle were returning from Los Angeles. At 7:10 am, all of the passengers disembarked the train to eat breakfast in the railroad station dining room at Lathrop, California. After entering the dining room, Althea Terry saw Field. She quickly exited and returned to her railroad car, apparently to fetch her satchel in which she was known to carry a pistol. When her husband saw Field, he walked behind him and slapped Field twice with such force that his glasses were knocked off. Neagle, who was 5'7\\" tall and weighed 145 pounds, testified that the 6'3\\", 250-pound Terry recognized Neagle from the earlier confrontation in the courtroom. Neagle later said he saw a look of determination and victory on Terry's face. Neagle rose from his chair and said, \\"Stop that! I am an officer.\\" Terry drew back his hand again and Neagle drew his .45-caliber revolver and shot Terry at point-blank range in the heart. Neagle announced to the 80 to 100 people in the dining room, \\"I am a United States Marshal and I defy anyone to touch me!\\" Field told them that Terry had assaulted him \\"and my officer shot him.\\" Alexander E. Wagstaff, Life of David S. Terry (San Francisco: Continental Publishing Company, 1892 Althea Hill Terry had been held at the door by one of the dining room proprieters, who had searched the satchel and found a gun within it. She screamed and pushed her way through the crowd, throwing herself over her husband's body. Neagle thought he saw her covertly remove David Terry's knife from his vest. She challenged the crowd to search his body, insistent he was unarmed. The knife was later found in her satchel with the pistol.David Neagle kills David Terry August 21, 1889 The San Francisco Examiner (San Francisco, California) Newspapers.com  Declared insane  After her husband's death, Sarah Terry became obsessed with spiritualism, hiring medium after medium to put her in touch with David Terry. Eventually, since she had no money to hire lawyers, the Sharon case gradually came to an end as the final cases were either dismissed or quickly decided against her. By February, 1892, newspapers were reporting that Mrs. Terry was insane. She wandered aimlessly in the streets of San Francisco, ignoring her appearance. She constantly talked to \\"spirits,\\" especially that of her husband, and could not sleep. She had periods of violence and believed that she was being tormented by electricity and hypnotism.‚ÄúHopelessly Unbalanced,‚Äù San Francisco Call, 14 February 1892, p. 8. Abandoned by her relatives since the beginning of the Sharon case, Terry's fate was left to the only friends she had left, R. Porter Ashe and Mary Ellen Pleasant. Pleasant initiated action to have Terry committed to an insane asylum.Robin C.

He was born in Bayswater, London and died at Hastings, East Sussex. Richardson was educated at Tonbridge School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, from where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1869. He later received a Master of Arts degree from the same college in March 1900. A right-handed middle- order batsman, occasional wicketkeeper and even more occasional bowler of unknown style, he played first-team cricket for his school from the age of 15. At Cambridge in 1866, however, he played in only one first-class match. But when the university season was over, he appeared in five matches for Kent, and scored 50 in the second innings of his first game for the county, against Sussex. He improved on that with an innings of 92 in a return match later in the season. In the three seasons from 1867 to 1869, Richardson played regularly for the Cambridge first team and in the first two of these years was successful as a batsman; he played in all three years in the University Match against Oxford University. From 1868 he also started keeping wicket for Cambridge in occasional games and he retained that position in the 1869 season, though he did not keep wicket for other teams. In the 1869 University Match, he made four stumpings and two catches, but he was unsuccessful with the bat in all of his games against Oxford. His best season with the bat was 1868 when he scored his only century, an innings of 143 for Cambridge University against Surrey at The Oval. In the same season he played against Surrey on two other occasions too, once each for Kent and Middlesex, and also appeared in two Gentlemen v Players games. Richardson played no more first- class cricket after single matches in both 1870 and 1871. He went into business in Mumbai, then called Bombay, and was later chairman of the Anglo- Egyptian Bank and cited as an expert on trade in Egypt.
