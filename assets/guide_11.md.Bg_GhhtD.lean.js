Most of his educational administrative career, however, was spent at his alma mater, Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.  Background  Prescott was one of six children born to Ben Prescott, I (1835-1914), and the former Kate Taylor (1838-1878). The second oldest son (a brother died in infancy), he was born during the American Civil War in Mansfield, the parish seat of DeSoto Parish in northwestern Louisiana, south of Shreveport. Before he was a year old, the Battle of Mansfield was fought in DeSoto Parish, a rare Confederate victory at that phase of the ongoing Civil War. Ben Prescott, an LSU graduate, was a sugar planter in his native of Washington in St. Landry Parish near Opelousas in South Louisiana. Kate Taylor Prescott was a native of the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C.Henry E. Chambers, A History of Louisiana, Vol. 2 (Chicago and New York City: American Historical Society, 1925), pp. 313-314 Prescott was educated privately in St. Landry Parish. In 1883, he received his Bachelor of Arts degree from LSU, from which he subsequently obtained his Master of Arts as well. As an undergraduate, he was a member of Kappa Alpha fraternity. His first teaching assignment was for one year in Port Allen in West Baton Rouge Parish. The next year, he was a school principal in Marshall in East Texas.  Academic career  In 1887, Prescott was named commandant of the student cadet organization at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which capacity he acquired the rank of colonel, a designation by which he was thereafter usually addressed. He left the position with the UV cadets in 1893, and the next year became the first president of Louisiana Tech though there were no actual classes until September 1895. His salary was $1,500 per year, nearly twice that of most of the five original faculty members. One of those faculty members, the mathematics professor W. C. Robinson, would serve for a year as Prescott's presidential successor.Ruston Daily Leader, October 11, 1933, p. 20 Originally known as Louisiana Industrial Institute and then Louisiana Polytechnic Institute, Louisiana Tech is an outgrowth of the former Ruston College, begun in the middle 1880s by W. C. Friley, a Southern Baptist clergyman who was subsequently the first president from 1892 to 1894 of Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, and the second president of Louisiana College in Pineville from 1909 to 1910. Louisiana State Representative George M. Lomax of Lincoln Parish pushed for the enabling legislation for the college, Act 68, and the first $20,000 start-up appropriation. Arthur Prescott is the father of the Louisiana Tech Prescott Memorial Library, which began as a reading room of \\"Old Main\\", the Tech administration building, with all initial 125 volumes donated from Prescott's personal collection of mostly studies in engineering, philosophy, religion, science, art, and history. A three-story Prescott Library building opened in 1961; years later it was linked in expanded facilities with the adjacent Wyly Tower of Learning. Louisiana Tech also honors Prescott with the Distinguished Arthur T. Prescott Professorship, an award once held by, among others, former Tech President Daniel Reneau. In 1899, he returned to LSU as professor of government and constitutional law. Like his father, Prescott was an active Democrat. He served on the Louisiana State Tax Commission under Governor Newton C. Blanchard. He was a member of the American Political Science Association and the Academy of Political Science in New York City. Prescott was also a member of the Chamber of Commerce, a director of the Commercial Securities Company and the Union Homestead Association, and a vice president of the Union Bank & Trust Company. During World War I, Prescott worked in drives to promote the sale of war bonds and lectured soldiers awaiting departure to war at Camp Beauregard near Pineville, Louisiana. Because of his interest in public law, Professor Prescott in 1904 was the first to propose the establishment of what became in 1906 the Louisiana State University Law Center, with an original enrollment of nineteen students, subsequently named in honor of law professor Paul M. Hebert. After the retirement of LSU President Thomas Duckett Boyd, the board of supervisors in 1926 and 1927 considered Prescott for the top position. He was the choice of Boyd and virtually all of the faculty. However, it was determined that Prescott, then sixty-four, was \\"too old\\" for the post, an oddity considering that some may have thought him \\"too young\\" at thirty-one when he was named the founding Louisiana Tech president. Prescott continued at the time as the secretary of the supervisors and as university dean of arts and sciences. After their first choice was unable to serve because of military retirement considerations, the supervisors settled on Thomas Wilson Atkinson, a professor of engineering. Prescott Hall at LSU is named in his honor; it is on the National Register of Historical Places. Family and death Prescott was a member of the Masonic lodge; he was a communicant of St. James Church in Baton Rouge, a Protestant Episcopal congregation. On January 4, 1888, Prescott married Nellie Daugherty (1866-1933), also an Episcopalian and the daughter of John A. Daugherty and the former Lucy Stewart, both of Baton Rouge. The Prescotts had six children, the Baton Rouge veterinarian Arthur Prescott Jr. (1892-1968); Lucy Stewart King (1896-1986), the wife of Clifford H. King (1898-1939), a real estate agent in Baton Rouge who died early in life, Allen Worden Prescott (1889-1954), Ben Prescott, II (1899-1975), who in 1924 was a banker in Paris, France, and two younger daughters, Kate Taylor Prescott and Elvira Garig Prescott, unmarried in 1924; married names not available. Elvira married Howard Davidson Muse. Arthur and Nellie Prescott, children Arthur Jr., Allen, Ben, Elvira, Lucy and son-in-law Clifford King, are all interred at Roselawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Baton Rouge. A year before his death, the Louisiana State University Press published Prescott's lengthy volume with even a long sub-title, Drafting the Federal Constitution.

This is the third and final chapter in Kudo's Samurai Revolution trilogy. The plot is a samurai epic with a loose historical basis. \\"The young Lord Nariatsu was probably modeled after the real life figure of Matsudaira Nariyoshi, also known as Matsudaira Tokunosuke (1819-1839),\\" who was the 19th or the 20th son of the Sh≈çgun Ienari (1787-1837) and the younger brother of the Sh≈çgun Ieyoshi (1837-1853). \\"Nariyoshi died when he was 19 years old--a perfect fit for this story. The circumstances surrounding his death are obscure, which is also very convenient for dramatic purposes.\\" Plot This black and white film is set in November 1839, during the final decades of Japan's Tokugawa shogunate. The retired Sh≈çgun's youngest son, Lord Nariatsu, crosses into the neighboring Oshi fief, while he's hunting. Confronted by the Clan Lord Abe Masayori for trespassing in his lands of Oshi, Nariatsu kills him in a fit of pique and rides home. The Oshi fief retainers appeal to the Sh≈çgun's Council of Elders for justice. Not wishing to embarrass the Sh≈çgun's Tokugawa Clan, Chief Secretary Mizumo rewrites the event with Clan Lord Abe in the wrong and Lord Nariatsu defending himself. For this \\"attack,\\" the Oshi fief is to be abolished at the end of the month, and the lands will be given to Lord Nariatsu as compensation. Angered by this gross injustice, Chief Retainer Tatewaki approaches childhood friend, Sengoku Hayato, and asks him to avenge their Lord's murder. Hayato agrees to assemble a small band of loyal samurai. Hayato and nine Oshi fief samurai vow to trade their lives for justice. They locate Nariatsu in Edo (feudal Tokyo). They are joined by Ido Daijuro, a r≈çnin (wandering samurai) with a similar thirst for revenge. Hayato and his ten followers pursue Nariatsu from the brothels of Edo as he travels home to the safety of his fortified castle in the Tatebayashi fief. As they are about to ambush Nariatsu and his bodyguards, Hayato receives a letter from Tatewaki. He orders Hayato not to kill Nariatsu, because the Council is reconsidering the decision to abolish the Oshi fief. Some samurai refuse to obey. Hayato enforces Tatewaki's order, because obedience is a samurai's first duty. Later, Daijuro tells the others that Hayato has more reason to disobey than they do. His wife, Lady Orie, has already committed jigai in anticipation of Nariatsu's death and the retired Sh≈çgun's wrath. When Tatewaki discovers that Councilor Mizumo lied, he rides to Hayato and orders him to kill Nariatsu. Ashamed that he was duped, Tatewaki commits seppuku. The eleven samurai ride hard and catch Nariatsu and his bodyguards at a river crossing. A great battle ensues. Hayato kills Nariatsu. At the end, only Hayato and Gyobu are standing. Since they are both disgraced and masterless samurai, they have no duty or purpose in life except to kill each other. Daijuro appears‚Äîhe has dispatched the last of the bodyguards. Daijuro cuts off Nariatsu's head and walks away, happy in his vengeance. When the rumors of the kataki-uchi (vendetta) spread, the Oshi fief is restored to the Abe clan. And, the Council of Elders releases a statement that the retired Sh≈çgun's youngest son has died of an illness.

He worked with the influential G. Stanley Hall at Clark University. One year after his death, the George Everett Partridge Memorial Foundation was incorporated in 1954 by the Partridge family to memorialize his life's work in the study and treatment of mental and personality disorders. The Foundation focused on developing programs to promote treatment centers for mentally disabled children, often referred to as the \\"forgotten children.\\" Partridge schools were established. The first of which was in Herndon, Virginia, for older boys with moderate mental retardation resulting from brain damage. However, the foundation was forfeited in 1991. Early work Partridge's PhD and early work focused on the psychology of using alcohol and other intoxicants. He surveyed historical patterns of use, including in religious and social contexts, and considered why there may be a human 'intoxication impulse'. He conducted his own research experiments on the effects of alcohol, in which he found opposite effects to those reported by the influential German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin. Partridge's interest stemmed from a \\"desire to test the value of psychological methods in dealing with certain ethical problems. Any one of a large number of impulses which are important because they determine morbid conduct might have been chosen for similar study, as for example, the gambling impulse, envy and jealousy, or the sexual impulse.\\"Studies in the Psychology of Alcohol George E. Partridge, Pgs 318-376, The American Journal of Psychology, Vol. 11, No. 3, Apr., 1900 (Free Full PDF) He published a short book in 1910 concerning the philosophical and scientific issue of individuality, and how teachers can learn each child's unique character, temperament and potential.An outline of individual study (1910) Partridge, G.

Stanley Hall G. E. Partridge, Granville Stanley Hall, Sturgis & Walton Company, 1912 He began writing a book during the final months of World War I, published in 1919, in which he analyzed motives for war \\"in the light of the general principles of the development of society\\", and addressed the likely effects of the war on countries and the 'world-consciousness'.The Psychology of Nations: A Contribution to the Philosophy of History G.E. Partridge, New York, The Macmillan Company, 1919 Psychopathy studies Starting in 1928 he published a series of studies conducted at The Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital in Baltimore on the 'psychopathic personality' ‚Äî a broad category used somewhat differently from some predominant definitions today. He postulated three subtypes: delinquent (commonly in males), inadequate (commonly in females), and the generally incompatible or emotionally unstable. He speculated that the first two were likely more biologically determined while the latter appeared to be more linked to early upbringing.1928: A Study Of 50 Cases Of Psychopathic Personality; Psychopathic Personalities Among Boys In A Training School For Delinquents; Psychotic Reaction In The Psychopath. 1931: Sociopathic Behavior in Women: A Study of Nine Cases He then published a brief paper in 1929 outlining the negative social effects of the \\"legion of deviates\\" vaguely classed as having psychopathic personalities, while noting the difficulty in discerning the interaction between cultural patterns and personality patterns, and suggesting that groups as a whole could also become pathological, perhaps most strikingly so in national motivations for war. He concluded: \\"The thesis here is that the thorough and adequate investigation of the individual consciousness in its pathological manifestations yields us precisely the background needed for the study of the group consciousness ‚Äî that is, for the development of a scientific socio-pathology.\\"Psychopathic Personality and Personality Investigation George E. Partridge, The American Journal of Psychiatry. 1929 May; 6(85):1053-1055 Sociopathy concept In a 1930 review from the Research Service of the Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital, Partridge identifies confusion in the definition and application of the diagnosis of psychopathy, as at the time the term could cover almost any kind of personality deviation acutely or chronically, or only certain more specific conditions, or act virtually as a holder for any otherwise unclassified mental disorder. He also argues that the practice, then common, of calling psychopathy \\"constitutional\\" was speculative (in fact very little being known about its causes); and that bisecting personality into the \\"normal\\" and \\"abnormal\\" is simplistic for something complex, finely nuanced, and individual. However, he concludes that a consistent factor linking most cases is persistent social maladjustment with a motivation towards behavior with adverse effects on others, and he suggests that sociopathy would therefore be a more accurate and appropriate term. Partridge suggests that the term psychopathy no longer be used at all, having no usefulness in application to the antisocial group more accurately described as \\"sociopathic,\\" nor much use for the various remaining conditions not inherently chronically antisocial, and certainly not to cover both groups at once.Current Conceptions of Psychopathic Personality G. E. Partridge, The American Journal of Psychiatry. 1930 July; 1(87):53-99International Handbook on Psychopathic Disorders and the Law, Volume 1, Alan Felthous, Henning Sass, 15 Apr 2008Psychopathy in the Treatment of Forensic Psychiatric Patients: Assessment, Prevalence, Predictive Validity, and Clinical Implications Martin Hildebrand, Rozenberg Publishers, 16 Jun 2005Epitome of Current Literature: Current Conceptions of Psychopathic Disorder by Partridge, G.E., M. Hamblin Smith, The British Journal of Psychiatry (1930) 76: 838 The Oxford English Dictionary (2011) definition of sociopath quotes from his 1930 article: \\"We may use the term ‚Äòsociopathy‚Äô to mean anything deviated or pathological in social relations\\" and \\"We may exclude from the class of essential sociopaths those whose inadequacy is primarily related to physical weakness, fear, hypersensitiveness, shyness and self-blame.\\" In fact, however, the first part of the quotation in full is: \\"If we may use the term ‚Äòsociopathy‚Äô to mean anything deviated or pathological in social relations, whether of individuals with one another, or within or towards groups, and also in the relations of groups to one another, we have a fairly communicable meaning, and a term which may apply descriptively to a great number of persons.\\" The phrase essential sociopath was Partridge's attempt to describe the type with the most deep- rooted chronic antisocial motivations.Psychopathy, a History of the Concepts Henry Werlinder, Uppsala Universitet/Acta Universitatis Uppsaliensis, 1978 The American Psychiatric Association created a diagnosis of \\"Sociopathic Personality Disturbance\\" in the first edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1952, which included four subtypes dubbed \\"reactions\\": antisocial, dyssocial, sexual, and addiction. The antisocial description was shaped by criteria advanced by psychiatrist Hervey Cleckley, who used the term psychopath. The DSM-II in 1968 moved the diagnosis of antisocial personality into a new section on personality disorders, below which dyssocial behavior was also listed. In 1976 psychiatrist Richard L. Jenkins (who wrote the child and adolescent behavioral disorders section of the DSM-II) pointed out that although sociopathy had become widely used as a diagnosis, it was not a diagnostic term per se in the DSM-I or II.Was \\"Sociopathy\\" Ever a Diagnosis? Richard L. Jenkins, Am J Psychiatry 1976;133:456-457. In 1980 the full term Antisocial Personality Disorder was listed, with some of Cleckley's traits removed and new behavioral criteria in their place. Nevertheless, the term psychopath gradually came into wider clinical use, partly through the influence of Canadian psychologist Robert D. Hare's Psychopathy Checklist, which revived and modified Cleckley's criteria in a criminological context. Both the DSM-IV and DSM-5 noted: \\"The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others that begins in childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. This pattern has also been referred to as psychopathy, sociopathy, or dyssocial personality disorder.\\"  Select bibliography  * An Outline of Individual Study.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 29, 2013. It was written by Stephanie Gillis and directed by Bob Anderson. It guest-stars Kristen Wiig as Annie Crawford and Kevin Michael Richardson as an unnamed FBI agent. The episode's title and plot is a reference to the Primetime Emmy Award-winning TV series Homeland. Plot Homer leaves the house to attend a nuclear power convention in Boise, Idaho with Lenny and Carl. The three use the occasion as an excuse to drink heavily, starting during the drive to the airport, and collect as much free merchandise as they can. Even though they are thrown out of the convention for their bad behavior, they attend the post-closing party. The rest of the Simpson family waits to greet Homer at the airport, but his failure to appear shocks them. Lenny and Carl ineptly try to console the Simpsons, and Patty and Selma do so with malicious glee. Homer returns several days later, but with noticeable changes in his behavior: he no longer strangles Bart for making sarcastic remarks, he refuses to eat pork chops or drink beer, and he prostrates himself on what appears to be a prayer mat while facing toward the Middle East. He has occasional short flashbacks of entering an unmarked van and sitting in a chair with headphones on and his wrists clamped down, as if being tortured. Overhearing a conversation between Chief Wiggum and Apu about rumors of a terrorist operative in Springfield, Lisa begins to suspect that Homer had been kidnapped and indoctrinated as a Muslim in order to carry out an attack. When she sees him looking at blueprints of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, her fears drive her to notify the FBI. Agent Annie Crawford, who suffers from bipolar disorder, fields Lisa's call and leads a team to investigate. She infiltrates a sleepover that Bart and Milhouse are having, then slips into bed with Homer and Marge to tell him that she knows what he is planning. The next day, Homer brings a large, tarp-covered device through the security gate and into the plant, and sets it up in the basement. Lisa races to the plant in an effort to prevent Homer from destroying it, but he tells her that he is only going to ensure that the plant will not do any more damage to the environment. His device is actually a tank filled with sour milk and spoiled chicken, which he plans to pump into the air conditioning system so that the stench will drive everyone off the property. Homer had overslept and missed his flight home from Boise. The van he climbed into was used by a group of ecological activist hippies, who gave him a ride back to Springfield. Along the way, they persuaded him to become a vegetarian, convinced him of the plant's destructive effects on the environment, and put him through an alcohol detoxification treatment that involved listening to Grateful Dead music and sitting in a sauna for days on end (hence the headphones and chair with wrist clamps). The mat Lisa saw Homer using was a rug marked with affirmations in very small print, forcing him to kneel in order to read them. Annie and her team burst in and restrain Homer, but Lisa activates the device in order to complete his work, realizing that they have at least one thing in common now - a desire to see the plant shut down for good. The mission fails because the air conditioning system never worked properly in the first place, but since this is a safety violation, the plant must be shut down temporarily to correct it and Mr. Burns is arrested. Lisa hopes that Homer might retain his new behavior, but he quickly reverts to his old ways upon drinking a Duff beer that floats down from the sky on a parachute, under the control of a cackling Moe. Annie takes a large dose of medication for her bipolar disorder, turning the dreary city block into a vivid rainbow daze, and pushes Ralph Wiggum to the ground as she walks away from the plant. Reception The episode received generally positive reviews. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode B‚Äì, saying \\"In the end, there are some funny lines, the gimmick doesn‚Äôt completely overwhelm the narrative, and things are back in place for the next episode. It‚Äôs not the worst omen for a new season of The Simpsons. I'm looking forward to it with guarded optimism and an open mind.\\" Teresa Lopez of TV Fanatic gave the episode four out of five stars -- signifying a positive review -- saying \\"The Simpsons has always done an excellent job with parody, and tonight was no exception. First, the show opened with clever Springfield version of the Homeland opening, before creating the perfect amount of creepiness of Homer's change.

Although from a rural area and farming family, he studied art at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\" and has traveled extensively in Europe and Asia, which has influenced his work. His art has changed styles from generally contains multiple elements and saturated colors. Life Maciel was born in the small village of La Soledad de Maciel, located in the municipality of Petatl√°n, Guerrero on Mexico‚Äôs Pacific coast. He was born to a farm working family, in a palapa near the ocean. His family is of mixed African, Asian and indigenous roots, not uncommon for that region, the Costa Grande of Guerrero. He is a tall thin man, from family of tall people, stating that his great-grandparents were two meters tall or taller. One of these was Margarita Romero, called Negra Margarita who was African-indigenous ethnicity. He spent his early childhood on beaches and among mangroves. He began to draw and paint early, with his father encouraging him even though the region does not have a strong artistic tradition. His father also taught him to appreciate literature and he is fond of Hispanic-American literature and authors such as Alejo Carpentier, Pablo Neruda and Miguel Angel Asturias, which has affected his artistry. He attended primary school for four years and at age ten went to Mexico City where he attended more classes up to high school but he did not study art although he had been drawing since he was a young child. Instead he worked odd jobs and sold some works that he drew or painted. These came to the attention of the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\". He received a scholarship, studying there from 1958 to 1962. He believes it is necessary for artists to see as much of the world as possible and be exposed to the work of other artists. His first journeys outside of Mexico included New York and Iceland, where he experienced an aurora borealis. He also spent three years in Europe, but did not use the time to visit museums and other artists. In 1995, he made an eight-month journey through Asia in countries such as India, Bali, Thailand, China and Malaysia as well as the various Pacific islands. Elements of what he saw during this trip were then included into his work. In 2007 he worked on a project to document the cuisine of his native region which inspired a number of paintings. He lived in Tepoztl√°n from the 1980s into the 1990s and today he lives in his native Guerrero state. Career Maciel has had over forty individual and collective exhibitions of his work in countries such as Brazil, France, the United States and Portugal as well as Mexico. His first individual exhibition was as the Galer√≠a Exc√©lsior in 1964. His other individual exhibitions include the Galer√≠a Pl√°stica de M√©xico in Mexico City (1964), Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana (1970), Reykjavik Museum of Contemporary Art (1971), Galer√≠a Segr√≠ in New York (1972), Instituto Franc√©s de Am√©rica Latina in Mexico City (1972), Galer√≠a Lourdes Chumacero in Mexico City (1974), Galer√≠a Arvil in Mexico City (1974), Galer√≠a Uno in Puerto Vallarta (1974), Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros (1974,1981), Museo Mexicano de San Francisco (1974), Picasso Museum in Antibes, France (1979), the Galer√≠a Aura in Mexico City (1983), Museo de Arte Contemporaneo in Morelia (1984, 1996),the Palacio de Bellas Artes (1985), the Scott Alan Gallery in New York (1986), Casa del Lago in Mexico City (1988), Hospicio Caba√±as in Guadalajara (1990), the Museo de Santa Teresa in Mexico City (1990), Galer√≠a Alberto Misrachi in Mexico City (1993, 1995), Galer√≠a Irma Valerio in Zacatecas (1994), San Antonio Cultural Center Texas (1996),Museo Guadalupe Posadas in Aguascalientes (1999) and Taller Siqueiros in Cuernavaca (2000), the Museo de la Ciudad de M√©xico (2003), Museo Mural Diego Rivera (2011) and the Museo Nacional de San Carlos in 2011. His important collective exhibitions include ‚ÄúArt-Expo‚Äù in New York, Er√≥tica ‚Äô82 at the Galer√≠a Jos√© Clemente Orozco and Contemporary Mexican Painters at the Picasso Museum in Antibes, France. He participated in the Myth and Magic of Latin America Biennal in Rio de Janeiro in 1979. His work can be found in the collections of the Museo de Arte in Havana, the Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo in Managua, Nicaragua, the Modern Art Museum in Reijkiavik and the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City. Maciel has created illustrations for children‚Äôs books and short stories, and for works by Francisco Hinojosa, Nicole Gir√≥n and Susana Dubin as well as stage and costume design for the theater. Recognitions for his work include membership in the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana, retrospectives at the Museo del Carmen in Mexico City (2001) and the Museo de la Ciudad de M√©xico (2003) . In 2007 his home municipality had a ceremony to honor him. Artistry Maciel began his artistic career in the 1950, and like others of the Generaci√≥n de la Ruptura, decided to abandon muralism for liberty of expression. Ra√∫l Anguiano classified him as ‚Äúone of the greats‚Äù calling him one of his disciples. Maciel defines himself as a hedonistic painter believing that, suffering should not rule human existence, but rather eroticism, celebration, play, laughter or, in other words, the sheer joy of living. He tried to transmit this through his painting. He is quoted as saying ‚ÄúWhat is beautiful in life sometimes is expressed with color, other times with movement and in some cases by means of objects, plants and animals.‚Äù Even generally serious topics can have elements of irony. Maciel did a series based on the Passion of Christ. But the images are not always solemn as in traditional depictions. His works generally contain a number of elements, often in saturated colors which are related to magical realism. Maciel has changed styles frequently and sometimes abruptly, with works showing African influence, others of a very traditional and academic style and ones using symbolic coloring and even hyper-realism. One reason for this is his travel experience, for example the inclusion of Asian elements is work after traveling there in the 1990s. His work varies from abstract to figurative, with his academic training apparent in his experimentation with materials.

The mill is a well-preserved example of a small-scale grist mill operation that was once common in Michigan. The mill and nearby Parker House (located at 4540 Geddes Road) were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History On this site in 1824, Robert Fleming built a sawmill, located on a rise above the creek which now bears his name. The mill, known as the \\"Fleming Sawmill,\\" was eventually abandoned and fell into disrepair. In 1863, English immigrant William Q. Parker and his wife Mary purchased the site and 61 acres of the surrounding farmland. In 1873, Parker built the current grist mill on the site of the previous sawmill, which had \\"long since gone to ruin.\\" At around the same time built a cabin for mill workers to stay in. In 1887, he constructed the nearby cider mill. The Parkers initially ground flour for their own use and that of their neighbors. They also pressed their own cider, but an apple blight in the early 1900s caused the use of the cider mill to be discontinued after 1914. In 1910, William Parker died, and his son George took over operation of the mill. George began selling products to the local markets in Ann Arbor under the brand \\"Flemings Creek Mills,\\" and soon the mill became well known locally for its pancake mix, whole wheat flour, and buckwheat flour. In the 1920s, Geddes Road was widened and paved, and the Parkers raised the foundation of the grist mill. George Parker died in 1956, and commercial operations at the grist mill ceased. George's son Dale kept milling for personal use, but mill operations ceased entirely in 1959. Soon afterward, the farm and mill were acquired by the Matthei family. At some point in the 1960s, the original dam was washed away. In 1983, Frederick Matthei sold 26 acres around the mill site, including both mills and the cabin, to the Washtenaw County Parks and Recreation Commission for $165,000 (well under the market value). The family retained the Parker House as a private residence. The Commission restored the mill and opened the site as a park in 1984. Additional trails were added to the park. As of 2013, the mill site is still a Washtenaw County park. The house is now a private residence. Description The Parker Mill Complex consists of two mills (a grist mill and cider mill) along with a log mill-worker's house, the Parker farmhouse, and various outbuildings. The 1873 grist mill is a three-story structure set into the hill near Fleming Creek. The mill has a frame third floor, clad with board and batten siding, set atop a two-story stone foundation. The mill still contains the original milling machinery, which is in operable condition. The 1887 cider mill, located adjacent to the grist mill, is a two-story structure, with a gabled frame second story atop an ashlar first floor foundation. The cider mill is now used as a small museum. The mill-worker's house is a log cabin located behind the mills. The Parker house is located west of the mill site along Geddes Road. It is a masonry Italianate structure with a hip roof. The house is not part of the Parker Mill Park.

Due to the ethnicities of the perpetrator and the victims, it was speculated that the crime was politically motivated, but the investigation proved this to be untrue: Zavistonoviƒçius suffered from severe mental illness. Shooting At approximately 4 p.m. on Sunday, Zavistonoviƒçius armed himself with a Russian hunting rifle IZH-12 and a Czech carbine ZKK-601 with telescopic sight ‚Äì both weapons were held legally with permit renewed less than a year prior to the incident. Within the next half-hour, he went to four houses where he killed nine of his neighbours and their relatives, all of them with single shots to the head or chest. Zavistonoviƒçius first went to the most distant farm from his house. Its owner, Jonas Bareika, was shot and killed in his bed. He also shot Bareikas' partner Marytƒó Rutkauskienƒó who at the time was making broom stalls. Afterwards, he approached Bareikas' neighbour Leonas Garbataviƒçius, whom he shot dead at the front door of his house. His next stop was at the Vrubliauskas farm, where he killed Vytautas Vrubliauskas and wounded his mother Jadvyga and sister Zofija. Zofija Vrubliauskaitƒó, who lived in ≈†irvintos and came to visit the family on the weekend, died the same night in ≈†irvintos hospital while undergoing surgery. Jadvyga Vrubliauskienƒó died a week later in Vilnius Red Cross Hospital. The perpetrator then moved to Raudeli≈´nas' home, which was closest to his own house. The next victims were Vanda Raudeli≈´nienƒó and her visiting daughter Dalia Kalibatienƒó, who was a senior lieutenant with the Ministry of National Defence. The Kalibaitis family lived in Salininkai near Vilnius and were visiting the family. Zavistonoviƒçius also killed a dog which attempted to defend the women. He fetched a mattress from his own house so he would not have to lay down on cold winter ground and took cover to ambush Antanas Raudeli≈´nas, his son-in-law Mindaugas Kalibatas, and his grandsons Vilius and Tadas. The men were gathering wood in a nearby forest. They heard the shots but were not immediately concerned as they thought it was hunters who frequented the forests. When the four men came out of the woods, Zavistonoviƒçius first shot Mindaugas Kalibatas in the chest, but the bullet grazed, ripping a piece of flesh but not causing more serious internal damage. The perpetrator then shot Vilius as he ran to help his father. When the gunman approached them, Kalibatas and his other son Tadas attacked him, grabbed his rifles and beat him until he collapsed. Since no one in the village had phones, Mindaugas Kalibatas drove himself and his son Vilius to hospital in ≈†irvintos located about away; however, Vilius died en route. The hospital alerted the police and sent ambulances to the village. Zofija Vrubliauskaitƒó and Jadvyga Vrubliauskienƒó were found still alive. Zavistonoviƒçius was taken into custody and died around 10 p.m. in hospital (cause of death: fracture in the base of skull).

It occurred on the eve of the 80th anniversary of the Act of Independence of Lithuania. Zavistonoviƒçius was a member of the Polish minority in Lithuania, which continues to have strained relationships with the Lithuanian government, while his victims were Lithuanian. Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius assembled a special commission to investigate the circumstances of the crimeGunman slays eight neighbours in Lithuanian village, Reuters (February 16, 1998) while press secretary of the Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas attempted to convince the media to delay the news until Polish President Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski departed the celebrations in Vilnius. Minister of the Interior Vidmantas ≈Ωiemelis was sent to deliver government condolences in person. The government paid for the funerals of the victims. The funeral of the Kalibatis family in Salininkai was attended by many dignitaries, including Minister of National Defence ƒåeslovas Stankeviƒçius, members of the Seimas, and officers of the Lithuanian Army. The results of the investigation were that the shooting spree was caused by a mental illness (chronic delusions similar to schizophrenia), and not a political agenda. Zavistonoviƒçius held a gun for hunting since 1975. The permits were periodically renewed. As part of the renewal process, Zavistonoviƒçius had to pass an examination by a psychiatrist. None of the psychiatrists who examined Zavistonoviƒçius noticed anything suspicious, a fact which caused much controversy. During the investigation it was uncovered that in 1985 Zavistonoviƒçius had been referred to and examined by the Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital. Zavistonoviƒçius was married three times. The third wife separated from him just ten months before the shooting and described his morbid jealousy and persecutory delusions, even though neighbors saw him as an intelligent and helpful man. Relatives had begun noticing various symptoms since 1978, which may have been related to a car crash in 1976. In light of these findings, the prosecutor's office explored a possibility of charging the seven doctors who signed off on Zavistonoviƒçius' gun permit with negligence. However, it was determined that the doctors were not negligent: without a centralized database, they could not know that Zavistonoviƒçius was treated at a psychiatric hospital, and in public his symptoms were masked and controlled well enough to pass the brief examination without suspicion.

He is based in Amherst, Massachusetts. Originally a developer of 3D graphics and virtual reality software, Andresen became involved in developing products for the bitcoin market in 2010, and was declared by Satoshi Nakamoto as the lead developer of the reference implementation for bitcoin client software after Nakamoto had announced his departure. In 2012 Andresen founded the Bitcoin Foundation to support and nurture the development of the bitcoin currency, and by 2014 left his software development role to concentrate on his work with the Foundation. Career Andresen graduated from Princeton University in 1988. He began his career working on 3D graphics software at Silicon Graphics Computer Systems. In 1996, he co-authored the VRML 2.0 specification, and later published a reference manual for VRML 2.0. Since leaving Silicon Valley in 1996, Andresen has tackled a wide variety of software-related ventures, including CTO of an early voice-over-the-Internet startup and co-founder of a company that made multiplayer online games for blind people and their sighted friends. =Bitcoin= Andresen was the lead developer for a part of the bitcoin digital currency project, working to create a secure, stable \\"cash for the Internet.\\" Andresen discovered bitcoin in 2010, considering its design to be brilliant. Soon after he created a website named The Bitcoin Faucet which gave away bitcoin. In April 2011, Forbes quoted Andresen as saying, \\"Bitcoin is designed to bring us back to a decentralized currency of the people,\\" and \\"this is like better gold than gold.\\" After joining the developers contributing to Bitcoin along with Satoshi Nakamoto, he went on to become lead developer of the client software for the bitcoin network which is now known as Bitcoin Core. He stepped back as lead maintainer in 2014. Andresen also created ClearCoin, an escrow-type of service, which was closed on about June 23, 2011. After several years working on the software, Andresen left the role of lead developer of bitcoin to work on the strategic development of its technology. He conceived of the Bitcoin Foundation which became reality in 2012. In May 2016 Andresen stated that the Australian programmer and entrepreneur Craig Wright was Satoshi Nakamoto, but later expressed regret getting involved in the \\"'who was Satoshi' game.\\" Andresen has not contributed to Bitcoin Core since February 2016. He had become critical of the failure of bitcoin developers to increase network capacity, and helped put together Bitcoin XT as alternative software. His commit access to Bitcoin Core on GitHub was revoked in May 2016 after stating Wright was Satoshi Nakamoto. In November 2017, Andresen expressed support for rival currency Bitcoin Cash, stating \\"Bitcoin Cash is what I started working on in 2010\\".

It originally aired on MTV on May 31, 2009. In the episode, Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt prepare for their upcoming wedding, while Lauren Conrad and Lo Bosworth move out of their house. After much deliberation, Conrad decides to attend the nuptials, where she reconciles with Montag after being estranged with one another since the third season. It is the final episode in which Conrad appears, and also marks the entrance of her replacement Kristin Cavallari. \\"Something Old, Something New\\" was produced by Adam DiVello, Liz Gateley, Kristofer Lindquist, Sara Mast, and Sean Travis. After the season was retroactively divided into Part I and Part II, respectively separating installments featuring Conrad and Cavallari, the episode became the conclusion of Part I. Additionally, it is the second episode in the series' history with a one-hour running time, the first being \\"Paris Changes Everything\\" in the third season. \\"Something Old, Something New\\" was met with generally mixed reviews from critics, who felt that Cavallari's introduction overshadowed Conrad's departure. According to Nielsen ratings, it was watched by 2.7 million viewers in its original airing. The episode was released on DVD on October 6, 2009, packaged with the remainder of Part I of the fifth season. Plot Lauren and Lo decide to host a farewell party as they prepare to move out of their house. As wedding preparations continue, Stephanie becomes upset after learning that Heidi has chosen her sister Holly as her maid-of-honor. During the bridal shower, Stephanie assumes the responsibilities after she becomes increasingly displeased with Holly's poor performance. After she makes amends with Spencer, Darlene gives him her blessing for the nuptials. While out for dinner, Brody tries to convince Lauren to attend the wedding, knowing that Heidi would appreciate her presence. In a later outing, Spencer tells Brody of his couples' therapy sessions with Heidi, but is displeased that he is not taken seriously. At the fashion public relations firm People's Revolution, Lauren tells Kelly that she will be leaving the company, which Kelly advocates as a smart decision that will help her to determine her next career endeavors. As an intoxicated Holly displays erratic behavior at Heidi and Spencer's rehearsal dinner, Stephanie is dismayed by her lack of irresponsibility. After Spencer explains that her behavior was inappropriate, Holly tearfully leaves the restaurant. The next morning, she apologizes to Heidi for her actions, and confirms that an invitation has been sent to a special guest. Charlie later tells Spencer that he invited Stacie, the bartender that Heidi clashed with for flirting with Spencer, to the wedding. Meanwhile, Brody and Stephanie make peace at Lauren and Lo's farewell party, while Lauren tells Stephanie that she will not be attending the ceremony. The following morning, the day of the wedding, Heidi and Spencer are getting ready, while guests begin entering the church. Lauren surprises Heidi in her dressing room and explains that Heidi's happiness is important to her. Meanwhile, Kristin Cavallari unexpectedly walks into the church and sits next to Justin, to the surprise of the attendees. After leaving Heidi, Lauren appears displeased after Lo tells her that Kristin is seated across from them. After the wedding has finished, Kristin tells Lo that she needs help finding a boyfriend, and to Audrina's disapproval, adds that Justin seems to be a \\"stand up guy\\". Lauren makes her final appearance on the series quietly leaving the church, while Kristin catches Heidi's bouquet. Production \\"Something Old, Something New\\" was produced by Adam Divello, Liz Gateley, Kristofer Lindquist, Sara Mast, and Sean Travis. The episode became the second in the series' history with a one-hour running time, preceded by \\"Paris Changes Everything\\" in the third season. Despite presenting Conrad and Bosworth's house departure as taking place the evening prior to Montag and Pratt's nuptials, the former event was filmed in January 2009, while the latter took place on April 25, 2009. Conrad first indicated that she wished to leave The Hills upon the conclusion of its fourth season in December 2008, looking to pursue other career opportunities. She commented that \\"five years on TV is a really, really long time\\", adding that she was \\"ready to walk away\\". However, per the producers' requests, Conrad filmed ten episodes for the fifth season, in which she closed her storylines. She added that the season was potentially its last, stating that series personnel felt her presence would \\"give the show some sort of closure\\". In the July 2009 issue of Cosmopolitan, Conrad stated that producers had pressured her into a reconciliation with Montag throughout the season, adding that she was displeased when they would not allow otherwise. \\"Something Old, Something New\\" was initially billed as the fifth season finale. However, in April 2009, MTV announced an extension of the season, and confirmed Cavallari as Conrad's replacement the following month. Consequentially, the first ten episodes of the season were retroactively labeled Part I, while Cavallari's forthcoming episodes were titled Part II. Reception and release \\"Something Old, Something New\\" was met with generally mixed reviews from critics, many of whom were ambivalent towards Conrad's departure and Cavallari's introduction. Emma Rosenblum from New York was pleased with Conrad's exit, commenting that she was emotional watching her \\"moving on and distancing herself from the follies of her overexposed youth\\". However, she opined that Cavallari's appearance at the wedding \\"does not bode well for the future of The Hills\\". A writer for Entertainment Weekly described the reconciliation between Conrad and Montag an \\"ideal end\\" to the series, and noted Cavallari's addition as a \\"questionable choice\\". Furthermore, it was included on the magazine's list of \\"25 TV Shows That Missed Cue for a Graceful Exit\\". In contrast, Jim Cantiello of MTV News noted that Conrad \\"came to the realization that she had been replaced\\", and complimented the manner in which Cavallari was integrated into the series. Carrie Bell from People was pleased that \\"the bitch [Cavallari] is back and [she could] already tell it‚Äôs going to make for some great trashy TV\\". In its original broadcast in the United States on May 31, 2009, \\"Something Old, Something New\\" was watched by 2.7 million viewers. It experienced a 10-percent ratings drop from the season premiere \\"Don't Cry on Your Birthday\\", which garnered 3 million viewers on April 6, 2009. In the country, Season 5, Part I was released as a two-disc DVD set on October 6, 2009.

Cockcroft (academia.edu) school of thought precursor of the Mexican Revolution of 1910. It is mainly based on the ideas of Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n, Magonismo, anarquismo en M√©xico his brothers Enrique and Jes√∫s, and also other collaborators of the Mexican newspaper Regeneraci√≥n (organ of the Mexican Liberal Party), as Pr√°xedis Guerrero, Librado Rivera and Anselmo L. Figueroa. History of Magonism Magonism and anarchism Cover of Regeneraci√≥n, with portraits of the organizing board of PLM and European anarchists (1910) The Mexican government and the press of the early 20th century called as magonistas people and groups who shared the ideas of the Flores Mag√≥n brothers, who inspired the overthrow of the dictatorship of Porfirio D√≠az and performed an economic and political revolution. The fight against tyranny encouraged by the Flores Mag√≥n contravened official discourse of Porfirian Peace by which the protesters were rated as the Revoltosos Magonistas (i.e. \\"Magonist rioters\\") to isolate any social basis and preserve the image of peace and progress imposed by force.National Archive of Mexico, Governance Branch: Revoltosos Magonistas (1906) Both of Flores Mag√≥n's brothers, like other members of the Mexican Liberal Party (PLM), used the term magonistaMagonistas at Oxford Reference to refer to the libertarian movement that promoted; as they felt they were fighting for an ideal and not to elevate in power to a boss or a group, they called themselves \\"liberals\\", as they were organized in the PLM, and later \\"anarchists\\". The same Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n affirmed: Liberal Party members are not magonistas, they are anarchists!. In his literary work Verdugos y V√≠ctimas (i.e. \\"Executioners and Victims\\"), Verdugos y V√≠ctimas from the Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n Archive one of the characters responds indignantly when he was arrested and judged: I'm not a magonist, I am an anarchist. An anarchist has no idols. Magonist thinking was influenced by anarchist philosophers such as Mikhail Bakunin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and others such as √âlis√©e Reclus, Charles Malato, Errico Malatesta, Anselmo Lorenzo, Emma Goldman, Fernando Tarrida del M√°rmol and Max Stirner. They were also influenced by the works of Marx, Gorky and Ibsen. However, the most influential works were the ones of Peter Kropotkin The Conquest of Bread and Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution, at the same time they were influenced by the Mexican liberal tradition of the 19th century and the self-government system of the indigenous people. Magonism; Historical Perspectives of a Mexican Anarchist Model Magonism and indigenous movement Magonistas in Tijuana in 1911 Indigenous peoples, since the Spanish conquest of Mexico, searched to preserve the practice of direct democracy, decision-making in assembly, rotation of administrative charges, the defense of communal property, mutual aid as the community exploitation and rational use of natural resources, shared anarchist principles raised by the magonists. Magonism and Indigenous Movement in Mexico The direct influence of indigenous thought in magonism were the teachings of Teodoro Flores, The Indian in the Magonist Movement mestizo Nahua, father of the Flores Mag√≥n brothers, and the coexistence of other members of the PLM with indigenous groups during periods of organization and insurrection of PLM, between 1905 and 1910, such as the Popoluca in Veracruz, the Yaqui and Mayo in Sonora, and the Cocopah in Baja California. Fernando Palomares, a Mayo indigenous, was one of the most active members of the Liberal Party who took part in the Cananea strike and libertarian campaign of 1911 in Mexicali and Tijuana. Legacy Citizen Year of Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n poster (1997) After the end of the armed phase of Mexican Revolution, and after the death of Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n in 1922, began the rescue of magonist thought, mainly due to trade unionists in Mexico and the United States. In the post-revolutionary Mexico, the figures of Flores Mag√≥n brothers was recollected by governments, considering them precursors of the revolution. Both the insurrection of 1910 as social rights enshrined in the Mexican Constitution of 1917 was due largely to the magonistas, which since 1906 took up arms and drafted an economic and social program. Program of the PLM However, although the demands that led to the revolution in theory were resolved in the Constitution and in the speeches of the revolutionary governments, there was no significant change in the lives of the most vulnerable populations. Also the magonistas considered not fighting to change the administrators of the state, but to abolish them. For this reason, the survived magonistas continued to spread anarchist propaganda. Librado Rivera was persecuted and imprisoned during the government of Plutarco El√≠as Calles and Enrique Flores Mag√≥n, who believed that the Mexican social revolution is not yet over,Enrique Flores Mag√≥n: Aclaraciones a la vida y obra de Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n, La Protesta, Argentina, 30 March 1925 could enjoy security until the presidency of L√°zaro C√°rdenas. The Mexican Anarchist Federation, founded in 1941 and active for about 40 years, edited the newspaper Regeneraci√≥n and spread Magonist thought. In the 1980s Magonism survived among some youth anarcho-punk groups. The Biblioteca Social Reconstruir, founded in 1980 by the Spanish anarchist in exile Ricardo Mestre and located in Mexico City, was a library where to find anarchist literature and works on Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n or copies of Regeneraci√≥n. Article about the Biblioteca Social Reconstruir In 1994, when the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) took up arms in Chiapas, claimed the ideas of the Flores Mag√≥n brothers.

In addition, IMA is registered with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). History IMA World Health, also known as Interchurch Medical Assistance, was formed in 1960 as a coalition of a number of faith-based relief and development agencies. IMA's aim was to centralize and oversee requests for gifts-in-kind from pharmaceutical and medical supply manufacturers and appropriately channel them to healthcare facilities, refugee centers, and disaster relief programs. The organization began distributing the donations from a warehouse in Maryland. The warehouse was operated by one of IMA's sponsors, the Church of the Brethren. To date, the organization has managed over $1 billion in supplies and shipped them to 52 countries. In addition to the distribution of needed medical supplies, IMA has provided medical services to people in areas devastated by civil strife and natural disaster. In 2010, three of the agency's own employees, including then-CEO Rick Santos, narrowly escaped death while working to end Lymphatic Filariasis (Elephantiasis) in Haiti. The workers spent 50 hours trapped in the rubble of a hotel in Port-au-Prince after an earthquake struck the region, but they were ultimately rescued. The organization responded to the disaster by providing medicine boxes and hygiene kits. In the late 1990s, IMA World Health expanded its efforts to include the management of healthcare service projects in developing nations. The organization worked to build basic health systems and services, control diseases including HIV/AIDS and NTDs (Neglected Tropical Diseases), and foster local faith-based support. IMA also recruits personnel to serve in areas of need. Its workers are involved in projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Southern Sudan, and Tanzania.

With the opening of shipping lanes and other economic activity in the Arctic, the organization says, the region \\"is moving to center stage and is playing a significant role in issues such as globalization, economic development, energy exploration, environmental protection and international security.\\"  Assemblies and Forums  The Arctic Circle held its first open assembly October 12‚Äì14, 2013, in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, at the Harpa Reykjav√≠k Concert Hall and Conference Centre. Held every October since then, the event is described as \\"a new mechanism for existing institutions, organizations, forums, think tanks, corporations and public associations to reach a global audience in an efficient way.\\" According to the organization's website, the Arctic Circle holds smaller events in different locations around the world, \\"so that participants can become familiar with the challenges, needs and opportunities presented by these unique environments.\\" Arctic Circle forums have been held in Alaska, and Singapore, Greenland, Quebec City, and Washington, D.C. The organization will also help facilitate smaller meetings of organizations and individuals to discuss Arctic matters. Speakers to have attended the Arctic Circle Assembly have included Ban Ki-moon, Nicola Sturgeon, Aleqa Hammond, Lisa Murkowski, Philippe Couillard, and Fran√ßois Hollande, who delivered a keynote speech at the 2015 Assembly as President of France. During his speech, Hollande discussed the importance of the Arctic as an arena for international climate action. Situating the Arctic on the front lines of anthropogenic planetary warming, President Hollande expressed optimism that global leaders would make an agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions at the then-upcoming 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, and urged global leaders to strengthen their commitments towards an accord, given the remaining progress that must be made before the conference. Angela Merkel, Hillary Clinton, Philip Hammond, Al Gore and Jos√© √Ångel Gurr√≠a have addressed the Assembly via video messages.  The Arctic Circle Prize  The Arctic Circle Prize was awarded for the first time at the 2016 Arctic Circle Assembly to Ban Ki-moon, then-Secretary-General of the United Nations. In awarding the prize, √ìlafur Ragnar Gr√≠msson explained that the prize recognized Mr. Ban‚Äôs leadership in international climate diplomacy, which he described as ‚Äúan act of extraordinary statesmanship, courage and vision‚Äù given political opposition at the time he took up his mandate. The Prize is intended to honor ‚Äúindividuals, institutions, or associations whose work has been of critical importance to the future of the Arctic.‚Äù The decision to award the Prize to Ban Ki-moon was attributed to the Secretary-General‚Äôs key role in the success of the COP21 Paris Climate negotiations. Upon accepting the Prize, the Secretary-General acknowledged his own efforts in climate negotiations, but emphasized the important contributions from governmental and civil society leaders, whom, he argued, deserved to share the prize with him. Accepted the prize ‚Äúon behalf of tens of thousands of dedicated leaders‚Äù in ‚Äúbusiness, civil society, and NGOs‚Äù who have worked with the United Nations in the climate change endeavors, he urged Arctic Circle Assembly participants to ensure that indigenous peoples, their rights and their sociocultural contributions, remain central as we address these shared challenges.  Compared with the Arctic Council  Reykjav√≠k University, where the Arctic Circle Secretariat is housed. As part of its mission, the Arctic Circle aims to convene \\"as many international partners as possible to interact under one large 'open tent,'\\" as well as to \\"support, complement and extend the reach of the work of the Arctic Council by facilitating a broad exchange of ideas and information.\\" In contrast, the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental body established in 1996, includes only eight countries with a speaking role: Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States. The establishment of the Arctic Circle has raised concerns that the organization may give countries such as China, India, and Singapore a greater voice in Arctic affairs. The Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail called it \\"a move that seems certain to irk some northern nations\\" and added that it \\"will be seen as complicating, if not challenging, the primacy of the Arctic Council in the rapidly changing north.\\" \\"The question,\\" wrote environmental journalist Irene Quaile, \\"is which forum will turn out to be the best placed to effectively protect the sensitive ecosystems and traditional lifestyles of indigenous groups in the Arctic at the time when international commercial interest is growing steadily.\\" As the 1996 Ottawa Declaration, a founding document of the Arctic Council, explicitly stipulates that the Council \\"should not deal with matters related to military security,\\" a 2014 RAND Corporation publication suggested that security dialogue \\"leverage existing international conferences, such as that run by the Arctic Circle Assembly, where participation can be ad hoc and security is already an item of discussion.\\"  Board members  The Arctic Circle's honorary board is chaired by √ìlafur. Other honorary board members include Prince Albert II of Monaco, Premier of Quebec Philippe Couillard Russian polar explorer Artur Chilingarov, former Greenland Prime Minister Kuupik Kleist, and U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. The organization's advisory board is led by Alice Rogoff, former publisher of Alaska Dispatch, and is composed of business leaders, scientists, indigenous representatives, heads of environmental organizations and policymakers.

Its members included the operators of railway track switches and those who coupled train cars in railway yards. Organized in 1886, the union came to its demise in July 1894 with rise of the American Railway Union and the smashing defeat it was delivered in the 1894 Pullman Strike. The organization was succeeded in October 1894 with the establishment of the Switchmen's Union of North America. History =Establishment= James L. Monaghan, first Grand Master of the SMAA. The first trade union of American railway switchmen was a local organization founded in the city of Chicago during the tumultuous labor struggles of 1877. In June of that year James Cullerton, a switchman for the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railway, sent word to the various rail yards of the city asking for three delegates from each to be dispatched to an organizational meeting.\\"Old-Time Switchmen,\\" Switchmen's Journal, vol. 1, no. 2 (June 1886), pg. 51. A total of 15 delegates showed up for the meeting, which launched a short-lived organization called the Switchmen's Brotherhood. This was supplanted by a new organization on August 18 of the same year called the Switchmen's Union, with Cullerton again playing a leading role. This organization continued in existence at least through 1881, failing to expand outside of Chicago but nevertheless providing a nucleus for development of a future union.John A. Hall, The Great Strike on the Q. Chicago: Elliott and Beezley, 1889; pg. 20. Cullerton's pioneering effort finally saw growth in 1884 with increased local membership and activity in Chicago and expansion of the concept to other local organizations in railroad cities in the Midwest. These autonomous local Switchmen's Unions began to feel the need for a national organization and a call was issued for a founding convention, to be held February 22, 1886, in Chicago. A well-attended organizational convention lasting 8 days followed, with the body electing officers, establishing a monthly magazine, and carrying on extensive discussions in secret session.Hall, The Great Strike on the Q, pg. 21. A follow-up convention was scheduled to begin September 20, 1886, in Kansas City, Missouri. This gathering was known as the First Annual Convention of the SMAA and was attended by delegates from 25 lodges affiliated with the organization.Hall, The Great Strike on the Q, pg. 22. The main business of the gathering was consumed in the writing of a constitution and bylaws for the governance of the organization. James L. Monaghan, a graduate of the Philadelphia school system who had studied law for two years, was elected the first Grand Master of the organization. Monaghan would be elected to the Illinois State Legislature in November 1888, to be succeeded as head of the SMAA by Minneapolis resident Frank Sweeney. The Second Annual Convention of the SMAA was gaveled to order September 19, 1887, in Indianapolis. The gathering was noteworthy for its elevation of another mainstay of the SMAA to prominence when it elected 26-year old Chicago native William A. Simsrott as Grand Secretary and Treasurer of the organization.Hall, The Great Strike on the Q, pp. 23-24. Together with Sweeney, Vice Grand Master John Downey, and Switchman's Magazine editor John A. Hall, these would comprise the top leaders of the SMAA during its comparatively brief existence. =Chicago, Burlington & Quincy strike of 1888= Throughout the 19th and much of the 20th Century, railway workers were divided into innumerable subdivisions based upon craft, with the engineers participating in the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (B of LE), the firemen who broke and shoveled coal to fuel the trains part of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen (B of LF), the conductors part of the Order of Railway Conductors (ORC), the brake operators part of the Brotherhood of Railroad Brakemen (BRB), and so forth. The SMAA was part of this myriad of organizations ‚Äî a diffusion of decision-making authority and range of competing institutional interests which made unity of action during strikes extremely difficult. In January 1888, disaffected engineers of the B of LE and firemen of the B of LF who were part of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy (CB&Q;) system of lines came together to discuss joint action against their employer ‚Äî which they perceived as abusive ‚Äî with respect to wages, job security (requiring cause for termination), job classification, and work conditions.See John A. Hall, The Great Strike on the Q, pp. 29-34 for a verbatim list of the demands. A negotiating committee was appointed, which presented the unions' case to railway officials, who declined to make any substantive changes.Hall, The Great Strike on the Q, pg. 45. Heads of the two organizations, Grand Chief Peter M. Arthur of the B of LE and Grand Master Frank P. Sargent of the B of LF were called in and together with a reorganized negotiating team further meetings were conducted with the railway still unwilling to increase wages or to alter working conditions. Final appeals to the General Manager and President of the railway were similarly unproductive.Hall, The Great Strike on the Q, pp. 46-47. A strike was called. At 4 pm on February 27, 1888, all locomotives of the CB&Q; system were delivered to their terminal points and all engineers and firemen of the railway walked off the job and a protracted strike was begun.Hall, The Great Strike on the Q, pg. 47. Shortly after the beginning of the strike, the CB&Q; began to move its cars via other parallel railways.Hall, The Great Strike on the Q, pg. 50, citing a brief history of events in a June 1888 Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers circular. A meeting was held in Chicago on March 5 between the two striking organizations, at which it was agreed that the engineers and firemen of these parallel lines should notify their employers that while they would continue to perform all of their other duties, they would henceforth no longer handle CB&Q; cars on the trains which they operated. Strikebreakers were hired by the railway in order to keep the line open, many of whom had little railway experience, making the already dangerous job of coupling and uncoupling cars performed by switchmen in the yards and on the sidings even more deadly.Hall, The Great Strike on the Q, pp. 49-50. Consequently, the strike against the CB&Q; was joined on March 23 by the members of the SMAA.Hall, The Great Strike on the Q, pg. 48. The railway brakemen remained on the job, however, helping to operate the trains of the CB&Q; while the three brotherhoods of the running trades were on strike, although the level ill feeling on the part of striking engineers, firemen, and switchmen towards the brakemen was said to be comparatively small.Hall, The Great Strike on the Q, pg. 56. The strike was ultimately lost by the unions, lending to a general sense of unease with the efficacy of the diffused craft form of labor organization. =Federation efforts= Members of the SMAA, Lodge No. 116 (Kensington, Illinois) during a holiday celebration in the early 1890s. During the summer and fall of 1888, following the loss of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy strike, officials of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and the Switchmen's Mutual Aid Association began discussions intended to bring about a broad and permanent federation of the brotherhoods of the rolling crafts ‚Äî engineers, firemen, switchmen, brakemen, and conductors.Paul Michel Taillon, Good, Reliable, White Men: Railroad Brotherhoods, 1877-1917. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2009; pg. 98. Articles of confederation were adopted between the two groups. In February 1889, officers of the extremely pro-federation B of LF, including Grand Master Frank Sargent and Grand Secretary-Treasurer and magazine editor Eugene V. Debs met in Philadelphia to explore an even broader labor alliance, engaging in discussions with representatives of the venerable Knights of Labor (KoL) and the fledgling American Federation of Labor (AF of L) with a view to uniting workers in the railroad industry with the wider population of organized. American workers.Taillon, Good, Reliable, White Men, pp. 98-99. Little more than a bland and impotent circular calling for greater labor union emerged from this Philadelphia session.Taillon, Good, Reliable, White Men, pg. 99. It was not long until Sargent and Debs' work bore fruit, however, when on June 6, 1898, a new railway federation was established in Chicago called the Supreme Council of the United Orders of Railway Employees. Charter brotherhoods in this organization included the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, the Brotherhood of Railway Brakemen, and the Switchmens' Mutual Aid Association. The two leading brotherhoods, organizations of the comparatively highly paid railway conductors and engineers, chose to stand aside from this new organizing effort. The Supreme Council was a top-down organization, which centralized the authority of the executive officers of the railway brotherhoods and to thus make possible countervailing power against the centralized railroad systems, united in their own associations, the American Railway Association (ARA) and the General Managers' Association (GMA), established in 1885 and 1886, respectively. =Battle with the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen= =Demise= See also * Switchman * Switchmen's Union of North America * American Railway Union * United Transportation Union Footnotes Further reading * John A.

The thief stole gemstones and watches ultimately valued at $136 million (‚Ç¨103 million/¬£89 million). (Initial estimates had only reached $53 million (‚Ç¨37‚Äì38 million/¬£33-34 million), as they had not taken into account another room in the hotel.)  Theft  The valuables were stolen from a private hotel salon, which was very poorly guarded, the guards having no weapons. The jewels were present due to a display by Lev Avnerovich Leviev, the Israeli billionaire. The armed thief was described as having a baseball cap and scarf, carrying a handgun. The theft initiated a manhunt but no arrests were made. Milan Poparic, a known member of the Pink Panthers, an organized crime gang, has been suggested as a potential suspect, having escaped prison days before the heist. According to reporting by investigative journalist Ryan Jacobs, most believe the thief was unlikely to be acting on his own. The thief, carrying an automatic pistol, entered the salon through a french door, which might have been forced or left open, and picked up a sack containing 72 jewels, 34 of which have been described as exceptional, in a suitcase. The heist has been called the biggest heist ever in France, and possibly the biggest heist of all time. The theft was at the same hotel where Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 film To Catch a Thief was set. The robbery was the third in the Riviera over a short period, following the theft from the Cannes Film Festival of jewels worth $1.4 million, and the theft of a $1.9 million necklace. = Reward = 10 days after the heist SW Associates, working for the insurers Lloyd's of London, offered a $1.3 million (‚Ç¨1 million) reward to the first person to give information leading to recovery of the stolen items, and released images of some of the stolen jewellery.

Today, part of the building is used for retail and office space. History During World War I, Allentown, Pennsylvania was the home of a large Army training camp, Camp Crane, where thousands of recruits were indoctrinated into the military as ambulance drivers before being sent overseas to France. The Lyric Theater, located at 23 North 6th St was primarily a stage theater, however it was adapted to show silent films to entertain the troops that came into the city for recreation.Hellerich, Mahlon H, and Pennsylvania) Lehigh County Historical Society Allentown. Allentown, 1762‚Äì1987 : a 225-year history. Allentown, Pennsylvania: Lehigh County Historical Society, 1987Historic 1917-era theater gets a new owner in Allentown, Pa. Oliver \\"Ollie\\" Gernert, the treasurer of the Lyric, took note that when the Lyric showed a movie, it was packed with soldiers, but when it presented a play or Vaudeville show, many seats were empty. Gernert believed that a cinema-only theater would be extremely profitable, and if it owned by someone who worked for the Lyric, there would be no conflict of interest as the Lyric could continue to present stage shows. Named \\"The Strand\\", construction was financed by some local businessmen, including a local dentist, Dr. Benjamin Stuckert, who became Gernert's business partner. The cinema was erected during the summer of 1917, and it opened to a full auditorium on 8 October of that year. The first film shown in the theater was Betsy Ross, with Alice Brady, John Bowers and Lillian Cook.Changes Due On Allentown's 8th St. Strand To Become Parking Lot, Offices, Stores, The Morning Call, October 01, 1986 A headline in the local newspaper The Morning Call stated that \\"Strand, Beautiful Play-House, Open. It was noted that the Strand would be an exclusive modern full-time movie theater, like those in New York and Philadelphia\\". Unlike the Lyric, it would not present vaudeville stage shows or plays. It was reported that \\"... The interior decorations of the theater are everything that has been claimed for them... the lighting system is unique for a playhouse in this city, the screen is exceptionally large and the picture areas as clear as life.\\" To accompany the silent films, the theater had a large organ with a full-time organist.Microfilm reels, Allentown Public Library of \\"The Morning Call\\" Newspsper The beliefs of Oliver Gernet turned out to be correct, as The Strand was a popular theater after World War I when the city returned to a peacetime economy. It adapted itself to sound movies about 1929/30, showing the popular films of the day. It also developed an automatic curtain control system which raised the curtain in front of the screen using electric motors, controlled from the projection booth. Prior to that it was done manually by stagehands. The Allentown Devices Company patented the technology and it was sold to cinemas around the country. In 1930, the property was leased to an A.R. Boyd Enterprises, and it was renamed \\"The Cinema\\", who operated the theater for the next 23 years. After World War II, the advent of television affected the movie theater industry, and by 1953, the \\"Cinema\\" was showing films to a largely-empty auditorium. The Royal African Rifles opened in September 1953 with Louis Hayward, Veronica Hurst and Michael Pate. It was the last film shown in the theater, and it was closed. =Post cinema uses= In early 1954, the property was sold by the Gernert and Stuckert estates to the Farr Brothers, Company. The Farr family had been in the shoe manufacturing and retail business in Allentown since June 1862, and owned a large retail and office building across the street. The Farr company converted the theater lobby into a shoe repair shop and the auditorium was converted into a large warehouse, shipping and receiving facility for the shoes manufactured by the company. Later, the shoe repair shop was converted into various retail stores in the lobby section which operated separately from the Farr warehouse operations in the former auditorium. In the late 1980s, the Farr family was getting out of the shoe business, and the Strand property was sold in 1986 for $140,000 to Donald P. Miller, owner of the \\"Park & Shop\\" company that operated a series of parking lots in the downtown Allentown central business district. Miller had previously purchased the adjacent property at 18 North 8th and the former Earle Theater*** at 20 North 8th which had been operated as a Park & Shop parking lot since 1961. Miller combined the three properties and tore down the auditorium portion of the Strand Theater building to expand the parking lot. However, the front lobby section of the Strand building would be retained as retail space (it was, at the time, a book store), and the two upper stories would be rented to become professional offices. Miller also stated that he would eventually sell the building and retain the parking area. When the auditorium section was being torn down in 1987, photos taken at the time show that the seats were removed in 1954 to accommodate the warehouse space, however the interior walls with ornate plaster, remained until the demolition. Also the entrance from the lobby was only walled off with some plywood, and a single steel door remained between the lobby and auditorium. *** The Earle Theater opened on 15 December 1927 at 20 North 8th Street, two doors north of the Strand. It was notable as the Earle was the first cinema in Allentown equipped with the first synchronized sound system for films.The '20s Roared With Sound On The Screen, Music On The Radio, The Morning Call, May 16, 1999 =Current use= In 2005, the remaining building, now reduced in size, was purchased by Steve Stelzman, a mortgage broker. It was purchased for $165,000 and plans were made to renovate the property and to turn it into office space. The interior of the building was completely gutted and rebuilt. \\"The Cinema\\" marquee, dating to the late 1940s, formerly having red letters with white interior lights along its top edges was used afterwards for advertising the various retail stores that were located in the former theater lobby was still attached to the front of the building. Unfortunately by 2005, it had deteriorated to the point that it had to be removed. Today, the remains of the 1917 building is fully renovated inside and with a new glass facade on the outside. The traditional front of the building as constructed in 1917 remains \\"The Strand\\", still in carved stone remains along the top of the roofline, with the masonry restored and repointed.

Louisiana state district court In 1835, Josephine Louise, a slave, was transported by the defendant Marot from Louisiana to France, a country in which slavery was not tolerated. Josephine's mother, Marie Louise, a freed black, argued on her daughter's return to Louisiana that her daughter had been subject to immediate emancipation on her arrival in France and could not be reduced again to slavery. The case was tried in Louisiana state district court in June 1835. At trial, the evidence established the facts as alleged. The judge delivered instructions to the jury as follows: > That if the plaintiff's daughter, Josephine, was taken by the person > claiming her services as a slave to a foreign country, where slavery does > not exist, and is not tolerated, and by the laws of which such slave would > be entitled to her liberty, for the purpose of residence, even temporarily, > that is, for any other purpose than mere passage through such country, and > perhaps even then, the person so taken to such country would become free, > and that freedom once impressed upon an individual was indelible; and the > status, or condition in society of such party could not be changed. Presiding Judge of the Louisiana Supreme Court George Mathews, Jr. > It is for the jury to decide the fact, whether the plaintiff's daughter, > Josephine, was taken to France on a mere passage through the country, or for > the purpose of temporary residence. That in the opinion of the court, it > makes no difference, that the donee or owner of the slave, as the defendant, > was a minor at the time of the voyage to France, and could give no legal > consent; because the condition of freedom was de facto impressed on the > person held to service, so carried to a foreign country, without having ran > away or escaped...; but the right to personal freedom by such residence, in > such foreign country, was acquired by, and stamped upon the person so > previously held to such service, and such a person is entitled to freedom. The jury returned a verdict that \\"Josephine is entitled to her freedom.\\" The defendants appealed the case, which was heard by the Louisiana Supreme Court. Louisiana Supreme Court The Louisiana Supreme Court heard the appeal in May 1836. The facts of the case were reviewed by the court. Presiding Judge George Mathews, Jr., writing for a unanimous court, affirmed the judgment of the district court in a single paragraph, holding that Josephine Louise was free and could not be re-enslaved: > This fact [concerning the nature of French law] was submitted to the > consideration of the last jury, who tried the cause under a charge of the > judge, which we consider to be correct, and was found in favor of the party > whose liberty is claimed.

Sandford US Supreme Court Justice John McLean The precedent was relied upon by US Supreme Court Justice John McLean 21 years later in the landmark decision of Dred Scott v. Sandford by the US Supreme Court. Justice McLean dissented from the court's decision that a slave was a piece of property that could be transported by his owner from a state into a territory that banned slavery without losing his slave status. He cited Marie Louise v. Marot as precedent. Seven of the nine justices did not abide by the precedent in what has been considered the worst decision ever made by the Supreme Court.

It was described by Tschitscherine in 1899. A. alluaudi is found in Cote d'Ivoire, Africa. A. alluaudi is a shiny black beetle, with an unusual upper jaw (mandible) which is more likely found in Caelostomus species. Taxonomy and Phylogeny A. alluaudi is named after the French entomologist Charles A. Alluaud who first collected the species. Description =Colour and Markings= A. alluaudi is a shiny black colour with iridescent wings. The line of the junction between the prothorax and the wings and the associated lateral edges, have a reddish tinge. The legs and mouth feelers are a dull yellow brown to red in colour. The antenna are a dark reddish-brown. =Head features= Upper jaw is very slightly arched, similar to Celostomus species. Head is of medium size and smooth with short frontal impressions. Rear of the beetles head strongly diverges from the base. Female beetles have convex and protruding eyes. A. alluaudi has long antennae extending from the shoulders with a large first segment, which is at least as long as the next two combined. Distribution and Habitat The species was originally collected by Charles A. Alluaud from Assinie, Cote d'Ivoire, Africa. No other locations are known. Very little is known about the habitat of A. alluaud, however, based on the collection records, the species is predominately found in a tropical savanna climate (Aw). Tropical savannas comprises of grassland with isolated trees and shrubs and are generally found between tropical rainforest and desert biomes.

Background In 1919 Simko Shikak has started his first and foreign-backed revolt against Iranian government. His expeditions resulted with regional plunder and massacres of Assyrians, Alevis and even Kurdish tribes. After three years of revolt he was defeated, but in 1924 Reza Khan pardoned him and he returned to Iran from exile. When Reza Khan had become Reza Shah in 1925, Simko pledged eternal loyalty to him and Iranian state.See: * * However, next year Simko allied himself with Haji Agha of Herki and tribal chiefs of Begzadeh, regained control of his tribe and begun another rebellion. Revolt Short military confrontation has started in October 1926 in Salmas (a.k.a. Dilman or Shahpur) where rebels started encircling the city. Shortly after, Iranian forces were dispatched from Urmia, Sharafkhaneh and Khoy, engaged rebels and defeated them. During engagement half of Simko's Shikak troops defected to the tribe‚Äôs previous leader and Simko himself fled to Mandatory Iraq. Aftermath In 1926, another unrelated Kurdish tribal revolt occurred in Kurdistan Province. Kurdish insurgency and seasonal migrations in late 1920s, along with long-running tensions between Tehran and Ankara, resulted in border clashes and even military penetrations in both Iranian and Turkish territory. In 1930, the commander of Iranian Army General Hassan Muqaddam sent a letter to Simko, who was residing in the village of Barzan, and invited him for a meeting in the town of Oshnaviyeh. After consulting with his friends, Simko along with Khorshid Agha Harki went to Oshnaviyeh and were invited to the house of local army commander, Colonel Norouzi and were told to wait for the Iranian general. Colonel Norouzi convinced Simko to go to the outskirts of the town to welcome the general's arrival. However, this was a trap and Simko was ambushed and killed on the evening of June 30, 1930. Simko's revolts are considered as attempt by a powerful tribal chief to establish his personal authority vis-√†-vis the central government throughout the region. Although elements of Kurdish nationalism were present in this movement, historians agree these were hardly articulate enough to justify a claim that recognition of Kurdish identity was a major issue in Simko's movement. It lacked any kind of administrative organization and Simko was primary interesting in plunder. Government forces and non-Kurds were not the only ones to suffer in the attacks, the Kurdish population was also robbed and assaulted. Simko's men do not appear to have felt any sense of unity or solidarity with fellow Kurds. On other hand, Reza Shah's military victory over Simko and Turkic tribal leaders initiated with repressive era toward non-Iranian minorities.

Sandvik Coromant is headquartered in Sandviken, Sweden and is represented in more than 150 countries with some 7900 employees worldwide. It is part of the business area Sandvik Machining Solutions within the global industrial group Sandvik.  Metalworking focus  Sandvik Coromant produces an extensive range of metal cutting tools for a large number of applications. *Turning, including general turning, heavy turning, small part machining, parting and grooving, hard part turning and threading *Milling, including face milling, shoulder milling, profile milling, turn milling, high feed milling, chamfering, slot milling and thread milling *Drilling, including general drilling, step and chamfer drilling, composite drilling and tapping *Boring, including rough boring, fine boring and reaming *Tool holding, including tools for turning centres and lathe tools, machining centres, multi- task machines and sliding head machines *Digital machining, including advanced software and tools that support digital manufacturing, from design and planning to machining and machining analysis  History in brief  Sandvik Coromant museum in Gimo 1942: The company begins as a small production unit for cemented carbide tools in Sandviken, Sweden when Wilhelm Haglund is assigned the job as manager of the unit. However, new innovations and manufacturing methods lead to the establishment of a more industrialized unit in Gimo, Sweden, in 1951. 1957: Scrapers become the first product with mechanically clamped ‚Äúindexable inserts‚Äù or ‚Äúthrow-away inserts‚Äù, as they were called at the time. The birth of the T-Max holder and use of indexable inserts is the start of a big change in the practice and productivity in machining. 1969: Heat-resistant Gamma Coating, or GC, is introduced as a grade, revolutionizing turning, milling and drilling with previously unmatched metal cutting performance. 1972: The Multi-Service marketing campaign sees the light of day, and the yellow coat becomes an important symbol. Tool-pool, machine- adapted tool recommendations and mini-catalogues are made available. 1990: Coromant Capto, a single holding system for both rotating and stationary spindles, is introduced. This ground-breaking invention provided a new and efficient means of combining and organizing tooling, while reducing tool- changing time in machinery. Today Coromant Capto (Latin for ‚ÄúI am gripping‚Äù) is an established system and an ISO standard around the world. 1997: Sandvik Coromant offers to repurchase used cemented carbide inserts for recycling, underlining the company's commitment to environmental responsibility. 2008: Sandvik Coromant acquires Norwegian anti-vibration tool developer Teeness. The unique Silent Tools damping adaptors allow for increased cutting parameters and a more secure, vibration-free process. 2013: Sandvik Coromant researchers discover that it is possible to control coating crystals at an atomic level to create uniform, tightly-packed, thermal-protected coating for new levels of hardness: Inveio coating technology is introduced. 2016: CoroPlus makes its first appearance, enabling connected solutions for increased security and efficiency in the design, planning, monitoring of machining performance and the optimization of machining processes. 2017: PrimeTurning is introduced, a new methodology enabling turning in all directions. 2019: The production unit in Gimo, Sweden, is officially announced as a \\"lighthouse\\" by World Economic Forum as an role model in industry 4.0.  Standards and certifications  Sandvik Coromant has received certification for international standards such as the ISO 26623 standard for tool holding systems, the ISO 13399 standard for simplifying the exchange of data for cutting tools between different systems such as CAD, CAM, CAE and PDM/EDM, as well as the ISO inserts, around which an industry-leading recycling program was created.  Research and development  The white villa, a part of Sandvik Coromant in Gimo Sandvik Coromant invests extensively in R&D; with more than 500 people working at fully equipped research and development centres around the globe. In total, some 60 research and testing facilities work in close cooperation with machine tool manufacturers, machining tool agents and customers across a wide range of industries to drive cutting tool development forward.  Training and education  Training More than 20 Sandvik Coromant centers worldwide offer customers, distributors, employees and students theory-based training courses, seminars and live demonstrations. Among its e-learning courses Sandvik Coromant offers Metalcutting Technology Training; some 35000 users are registered for the programme. EducationWillhelm Haglunds Gymnasium that is 90% owned by Sandvik Coromant Part of the organization's mission is the continued advancement of industry knowledge and education, Sandvik Coromant is thus involved with several educational facilities and organizations across the globe. * Sandvik AB founded the technical upper secondary school G”ßranssonska Skolan in Sandviken, Sweden in 2002 to provide students with the technical competences needed to bridge the skills gap the manufacturing industry is facing. * Wilhelm Haglund's Gymnasium is a joint project between Sandvik AB and √ñsthammar Municipality, founded in 2007. It is a technical upper secondary school in Gimo, Sweden, which provides students with three years of technical education in preparation for workforce entry. * In 2008, the Sandvik Coromant Centre for Machinist Technology opened at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology. This facility increased the school's capacity for training machinist apprentices. * Sandvik Coromant is also engaged in various R&D; projects at the Chalmers University of Technology Materials and Manufacturing Technology and Applied Mechanics.

It was described by L. Peringuey in 1899. A. emeritus is a small beetle shiny black in colour with reddish mouth feelers and pitchy black legs and antennae. A. emeritus is very rare with only one known published account of collection. Very little is known about its habitat, however it is found in the subtropical highlands of Zimbabwe. Taxonomy and Phylogeny The species name emeritus is from latin meaning 'to deserve' or merit. The reason this name was given to the species is unknown but suggests that A. emeritus deserves to belong to the genus Abacetus. The holotype specimen is a female and was collected by G. A. K. Marshall with the collection date some time in the 1890s. A. emeritus is similar to Abacetus nigrinus. S. Straneo examined the holotype specimen at the South African Museum in the 1940s. Straneo was unable to examine other specimens of the species as none of the specimens received from Museums and private individuals coincided with the typical specimen. =Species Key= From the species key developed by L. Peringuey A. emeritus can be identified as follows: GROUP. Species in which the inner spur of the front tibiae is simple or slightly split. :Sub-group. Species which have antennal joints of normal thickness. ::Abacetus emeritus. The prothorax is sub-heart shaped and intervals of wings are moderately raised on the disk. Description =Size= L. Peringuey described the sole adult specimen as 9mm in length and 4mm in width. =Colour and Markings= The beetles are black and shiny, the mouth feelers (palpi) are slightly reddish (sub- rufrescent). The three basal antennal joints and the foot (tarsi) are pitchy black (piceous). Straneo noted that the stripes of the species are perfectly smooth, without any trace of scalloping (crenulation). =Legs= Inner spur on the shank portion of the leg (tibiae) which when viewed from the front (anterior) is intact (simple) or very slightly split (bifid). The hind tibiae have three grooves (tri-sulcate), and so have the hind and intermediate feet (tarsi). =Thorax= The first thoracic segment (Prothorax), which is the segment closest to the head, is nearly heart-shaped (sub-cordate) and hairless (glabrous). The Prothorax is broad as long, curved like a bow (arcuate) on the side (laterally) from apex to base, but broader in the front (anterior) than in the back part (posterior) where it does not have any curvilinear indentations (not sinuate), but the basal angle is sharp and projects, the outer margin is bent backward (reflexed). On the Prothorax the side groove (lateral sulcus) is narrow and reaches from the front (anterior) angle to the basal pore and is not continued along the basal margin to the basal longitudinal groove (sulcus), the space along the base between the grooves (sulci) and the median longitudinal line is not punctured (impunctate), the front part of the disk which is broadest across the median part is slightly convex and the sides of the rear (posterior) are not depressed or bent backwards (reflexed) on the site (laterally). =Wings= Intervals of the wings (elytra) are moderately raised on the central upper surface (disk). The wings are also hairless. The wings are rectangular (oblong), narrower than the base of the prothorax but with the shoulder part (humeral) slanting, the longitudinal depressed line (striae) is deep and not punctured (impunctate) and the intervals plane, the puncture on the third interval is about the middle (median). Distribution and Habitat A sole individual was collected from Mashunald province, Salisbury (now Harare) in Zimbabwe. No other locations are known. Based on the sole collection record, A. emeritus is predominately found in subtropical highlands with a dry winter (Cwb).

Life He was born, probably in Kennington, London, the eldest son of hosier Thomas Johnson Howes and Augusta Mary Bond, daughter of George Augustus Bond, a captain in the East India Company's service. Howes was assistant professor of zoology at the Normal School of Science from 1885. From 1895, Howes was first professor of zoology at the Royal College of Science in South Kensington. After being introduced to Thomas Huxley in 1874, his skill as a draughtsman and enthusiasm as a naturalist led to his being employed as assistant to Huxley. He was tasked with developing a system of practical instruction in biology at the Normal School of Science and the Royal School of Mines at Kensington, where he was appointed demonstrator of biology in 1880. Howes was an eminently gifted teacher. The comprehensiveness of the biology courses at the Royal College of Science attested to his knowledge and thoroughness. He invested much of his energy in founding and supporting societies concerned with the natural sciences, serving as office bearer in many of these. His drawing skills were well above average: the Atlas of Elementary Biology (1885) was illustrated entirely with his drawings. Howes's main interest lay with the comparative anatomy of the Vertebrata, a field to which he made significant contributions. An important account, which Howes co- authored with H. H. Swinnerton, dealt with the development of the skeleton of the Norfolk Island reptile, the Tuatara or Sphenodon and appeared in Transactions of the Zoological Society, 1901. John Edmund Sharrock Moore worked within Howes's laboratory from 1892 - 1905. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1897, Legum Doctor at St Andrews in 1898, and Doctor of Science at Manchester in 1899. He was President of the Malacological Society of London (1895-1896), Treasurer of the Anatomical Society, Zoological Secretary of the Linnean Society and a Member of the Council of the Zoological Society of London.

The Countess of Guiche, and called \\"the beautiful Corisande\\", she was known for having been a royal mistress of King Henri III of Navarre (the future Henri IV of France) between 1582 and 1591. Biography She was the daughter of Marguerite of Cauna and of Paul, Baron of Andoins, Lord of Lescar, Viscount and later Count of Louvigny. She later became one of the wealthiest heiresses of B√©arn. Emancipated on 6 August 1567 (at the age of 13), she was married on Thursday 21 November 1568 to Philibert of Gramont, Seneschal of B√©arn, Count of Gramont and of Guiche, Viscount of Aster and of Louvigny, Lord of Lescure, and Governor of Bayonne (1552-1580) who was, at the time only 15 himself. Philibert died of a wound received in 1580 during the siege of La F√®re in Picardy, and Diane found herself a widow at the age of 26. She was the mother of Antoine II, Duke of Gramont, and a daughter, Catherine. A woman renowned for great beauty and no less extensive culture, she was particularly acquainted with Montaigne. She fell in love with courtly literature, and it was in the chivalric romance Amadis de Gaula that she found a heroine that she could identify with, and whose name she adopted: \\"Corisande\\". Henri III of Navarre met her, probably thanks to the friendship between her and his sister Catherine de Bourbon (despite their difference of religion, Catherine being a Calvinist while Diane was Catholic) and he courted her persistently. She had a great influence on him between 1582 and 1590, when she, unlike his other mistresses, was a partner in his business dealings. The countess, in return, remained devoted to him all his life. During the Wars of the League, she sold her diamonds for him, pawned her possessions, and went so far as to send out to him an army of 20,000 Gascons whom she had enlisted at her expense. Henry wrote to her \\"with his blood\\" a promise of marriage, according to an anecdote told by Agrippa d'Aubign√©, but he did not keep his word. She was probably the cause of the disfavor of Fran√ßoise de Montmorency-Fosseux (Henry's previous mistress from 1579 to 1581) and Protestants worried about the influence of this Catholic on the sovereign of B√©arn. Certain genealogists attribute a son, Antonin, to this affair, but the information is doubtful. She died in February 1621 in her castle of Hagetmau.

Biography =Beginnings (2006-2009)= Ideamen was created in late 2006 shortly after keyboardist Tim Swanson ended his short stint as keyboardist for Dog Fashion Disco and then teamed up with vocalist Dave Solar and bassist Mark Vasquez, following the dissolution of local Chicago-area bands Duct Tape Mustache and Solvasq. Guitarist Dan Figurell and drummer Phil Goodrich rounded out the lineup, and in 2007, the band debuted with the release of their EP Progress. The EP attracted the label Rotten Records (of whom Dog Fashion Disco was signed to when they dissolved), and Rotten signed Ideamen in 2008. =May You Live in Interesting Times & support touring (2008-2011)= In August 2008, Ideamen began working on their debut album. Their debut album, titled May You Live in Interesting Times, was released on October 27, 2009 on Rotten Records. A second guitarist, Phil Miller, joined the band in time for touring in October 2010. Throughout the next two years, the band toured with the likes of Polkadot Cadaver (which contains former fellow DFD members), Look What I Did, and Tub Ring. =Second album, Delays & release (2011-Pres.)= A mash-up of the Mr. Bungle song \\"Retrovertigo\\" and Radiohead's \\"Paranoid Android\\" titled \\"RetroVertigoidAndroid\\" (a live favorite for the group), was recorded in the studio and released in early 2011 as a free download to anyone who signed up for the band's newsletter. The follow up to Interesting Times had been given tentative release dates for as early as Spring of 2012. However, constant touring, Solar's bout with Ketoacidosis in fall of 2011, Goodrich's ear problems forcing him to take time off from touring, Figurell's relocation to Bloomington, and multiple issues with the final mix and mastering of the album all contributed to the extended delay of the album's release.http://www.iloveideamen.com/biography Figurell ended his tenure with the band after recording his guitar parts for the album, and has been replaced by Greg Millikan. The album, titled Schemata, was released in February 2014. Swanson is once again a member of DFD. They plan to release their next album, \\"Trained When We're Young\\" in August 2017...
