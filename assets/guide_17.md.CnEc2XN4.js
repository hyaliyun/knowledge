The American Mathematical Monthly, 1 (1894), 219–222 Ancestry and early life  Elisha Scott Loomis, of English–Scottish and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry, was born in a log-cabin in Wadsworth, Ohio, which at that time was a village in Medina County. He was the eldest son of Charles W. Loomis, a descendant of the pioneer Joseph Loomis of Windsor, Connecticut. His mother was Sarah Oberholtzer, descendant of pioneer Jacob Oberholtzer, of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. When Loomis was 12 his father died. By that time he had six younger brothers and a sister, and for seven years from the age of 13 he helped his mother make ends meet by working as a farm labourer during summertime. Four months each winter he attended district schools, working for his board while doing so. During his schooldays he wished to learn algebra, and as his district school teacher knew no algebra, he walked several miles to a neighbouring town where he bought Ray's Elementary Algebra.Ray, Joseph. Elementary algebra 1850. May be downloaded from https://archive.org/details/abu8350.0001.001.umich.edu He proceeded to master the material without any support except encouragement of his mother, who had had too little schooling to learn to write. Loomis proved to be a sufficiently apt scholar to become a teacher himself in 1873. He taught during the summer and managed not only to save enough money to help his mother support her family, but also for himself to attend and assist at Baldwin University at Berea, Ohio, during the winter. His industry and thrift enabled him to buy a home, in Shreve, Ohio, where he established his mother and brothers the fall of 1876. This was partly possible because of his abstemious habits, eschewing both tobacco and strong drink. He joined the Presbyterian church early in his adult life, but later converted to Methodism. After he attained his B.S. degree in mid-1880, Loomis married a teacher from Loudonville, Ohio, Miss Letitia E. Shire. Further education and career While teaching, Loomis continued his own studies and earned postgraduate degrees. While in Berea, studied civil engineering and became the village engineer. He attained his B.S. at Baldwin University in 1880 under Professor Aaron Schuyler, and then his A.M. in 1886 and Ph.D. in 1888 from Wooster University, Ohio. In 1900 the Cleveland Law School awarded him the LL.B. degree, and he was admitted to the State Bar, June, 1900. From 1880 to 1885 he served as principal, first at the Burbank Academy in Burbank, Ohio, then at the Richfield Township High School, in Summit County, Ohio. In 1885, he accepted the chair of mathematics in Baldwin University, succeeding Professor Aaron Schuyler, where he served for ten years. In 1895, he accepted the post of head of the Mathematics Department at West High School, Cleveland, Ohio, where he taught for 29 years, not retiring until 1923 as required by law for Ohio state teachers. In writing his own obituary he estimated that in his 50 years as a teacher he had ploughed \\"habit-formation grooves in the plastic brains\\" of over 4000 boys and girls and young men and women and said that he prized the title of \\"Teacher\\" more than any other honour. Written works His written works included his thesis for his Ph.D. degree in metaphysics: \\"Theism the Result of Completed Investigation\\", a genealogy of \\"The Loomis Family in America\\", and \\"The Genealogy of Jacob Oberholtzer and His Descendants\\"'. He also wrote \\"The Teaching of Mathematics in High Schools\\", and \\"Original Investigation Or How to Attack an Exercise in Geometry\\". Possibly his best-known work however, is \\"The Pythagorean Theorem\\", in which he collected, classified, and discussed 344 proofs. The book is still a work of reference.Loomis, Elisha Scott, The Pythagorean Proposition: Its Demonstration Analyzed and Classified and Bibliography of Sources for Data of the Four Kinds of ‘Proofs’, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Washington, DC, 1968 Also he prepared in manuscript, ready for publication, books and articles estimated to number over one hundred, but it is not clear how many of them ever were printed. Titles that he mentioned include: \\"Recollections and Reflections of a Log-Cabin Boy\\", \\"This and That, from 50 Years of Experience as a Teacher\\", a genealogy of his family, a biography of Dr. Aaron Schuyler, and many articles on educational, mathematical and genealogical subjects. He held that true teaching, worth- while education and right living consist in ethical and moral habit formation to control one's social contributions throughout life; and that service should guide one's action rather than profits. At the time of his death he had a son, Elatus G. Loomis of Cleveland, Ohio, a daughter, Mrs. R. L. Lechner of Buenos Aires, and three grandchildren.

Vadakkeshwaram Temple is the common name of the temple from ancient time, but some of the local people addresses the temple as Ikkare Kottiyoor as it is on the bank of the river close to the Kottiyoor village, to differentiate it from the shrine in the other side of the river. Thruchherumana Kshetram is also another name by which temple is known. The temple is a special category temple under Malabar Devaswom board. There are two temples in Kottiyoor - one on the western bank of the Vavali river - and the other one on the eastern bank of the Bavali river. The shrine on the east bank (Kizhakkeshwaram or Akkare Kottiyoor) is a temporary hermitage (Yaga shrine) opened only during the Kottiyoor Vysakha Mahotsavam. The Vadakkeshwaram or Ikkare Kottiyoor (The Thruchherumana Temple) on the western bank of the river is a permanent temple complex like all other temples. It remains closed throughout the year except for the 27 days of Vysakha festival. The temple is situated in a densely forested area amidst a sacred grove that covers about 80 acres. Mythology says that Akkare Kottiyoor, the shrine on the eastern bank of the river, was the location of Daksha Yaga, at the conclusion of which, Sati Devi immolated herself and thus committed suicide in this place. The Kottiyoor Perumal Temple was, in its heyday, the second-wealthiest Temple in the entire Kerala region (second only to the Padmanabhaswamy Temple which even with its smaller five vaults opened, lays claim to the largest collection of gold and precious stones ever, as well as being the wealthiest place of worship in the world).https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/13886/13/13_appendix.pdfhttp://lsi.gov.in:8081/jspui/bitstream/123456789/5747/1/27978_1981_CAN.pdf The Kottiyoor Perumal also owned over 30,000 acres of forest-lands in Kannur District.https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/13886/13/13_appendix.pdfhttp://lsi.gov.in:8081/jspui/bitstream/123456789/5747/1/27978_1981_CAN.pdf The Thruchherumana Temple was built after the Swayambhoo lingam was found; however the exact date of construction of temple is not known, the pilgrimage has been taking place for many centuries. Significance Ikkare Kottiyoor temple with scared tree in the front. Inside the shrines varanda. The Kottiyoor Temple is highly revered in Kerala and neighboring areas of adjoining states. The legend goes that the shrine is blessed with the divine presence of The Holy Trinity or The Trimurthy (Brahma - Vishnu - Shiva) and the primordial Mother Goddess (Bhagavathy), due to this Kali (the personification of Kali Yuga), has promised Parashurama in the presence of Trimurthy in not entering the premises of the holy shrine. Kottiyoor is one of the most sacred shrines of Shakti. There are very few shrines in India for Sati Devi among which Kottiyoor is one. As it is forbidden to build any permanent structures abiding by religious principles, there are only temporary and simple-looking structures, which resemblance what would look like hermits of sages. As there is no sanctum-sanatorium, Sati is worshiped as Shakti in 'Ammarakkalu Thara', a raised platform adjacent to the Swayambhoo linga where Sati Devi is believed to have committed suicide. This is believed to be the temple of the origin of the Shakti Peethas. As it is the confluence of the presence of all the known Hindu Divinities, the place is called Kottiyoor from Koodi and Uuru meaning Meeting Precinct.http://kottiyoordevaswom.com/about.html The temple is well known for its old structure and is not renovated so as to not disturb the old customs and traditions of the temple. =Social participation= Odappu, a \\"flower\\" made of bamboo pieces instantly is a thing every devotee buys from the temple to his home to be hung there for a year. Here is a shop selling the same. The Kottiyoor Pilgrimage has far reaching participation from the entire society. The Hindu communities in the region bring the raw materials as a ritual each year from even more than a hundred of kilometer away by walking. Each community have been delegated specific duty by the Kottayam (Pazhassi) royal family, and has not been re-delegated from the inception. They consider this as a right given to them and exercise their part as a duty. This has been happening as a ritual for ages and is centuries of years old tradition. The pilgrimage has become a part of their culture. The temple is located in a serene dense forest which is now declared as a Wild Life Sanctuary by Government of Kerala. The rites and rituals of the festival is a symbol of Shaiva-Vaishnava-shakteya communal harmony. Rohini Aradhana is considered as one of the sacred ritual during the Vysakha Mahotsavam where the head of the Vaishnavite family named 'Kurumathoor', conduct 'Aalingana pushpanjali' to the Swayambhoo linga, this is to commemorate Vishnu embracing Shiva to pacify him, who was in deep sorrow when he found the burned dead body of his beloved wife Sati Devi. =Thruchherumana Temple origin= The 'Prathishta'(i.e. the installation of idol) of the Thruchherumana Temple, was done by Parashurama on the opposite river bank of the Swayambhuu linga. The Thruchherumana Temple has its objective to worship Shiva for the entire year as the Swayambhoo linga on the other bank of the river can only be worshiped during 27 days of a year. Sankaracharya had classified the rites and rituals of the temple. He came to the Thruchherumana temple and worshiped there but he did not cross the river and worshiped the Swayambhoo linga as it was not the period of Vysakha pilgrimage. This belief is strictly followed until this time, of not going to the premises of Swayambhoo linga or Akkare kottiyoor if it is not the Vysakha pilgrimage time. Sankaracharya made ablutions in the Vavali river and prayed from the west bank of the river without crossing and continued his journey. Legends A pious Namboothiri of Kalakkatt Illam (one of the four major Mantravada(Sorcery) lineages of Kerala) was returning from Kottiyoor. To pray for Sandhya vandanam in Manathana Shrine he took bath in the pond, after which a young lady from the adjacent bay offered him Taali(herbal shampoo), and told that she would apply it onto his forehead. He immediately recognized that she was none other than Bhadrakali and showing his head would meand his death. He folded his hand in-front of her and said any thing given by The Mother is nectar. He took the shampoo and drank it. Devi was pleased with him and presented him with three sacred insignia which he installed in three temples in the Kannur region. Associations with other Temples The Puffed rice(Pori or Malaru) is prepared at \\"Pullancheri Illam\\", and handed over to the temple from Narasimhaswamy temple, Pala, near Muzhakunnu Kottiyoor Temple is also closely associated with the Tirunelli MahaVishnu Temple in Wayanad District, about 54 km from Kotttiyoor It was from Tirunelli that rice was given to Kottiyoor for Vysakha Mahotsavam and returned after the festival. This has been discontinued but rites are performed in both temples to continue the tradition.http://thirunellitemple.com/temples_nearby.php It is believed that Bhuta Ganas carry the presents of Tirunelli Perumal to Vysakha Mahotsavam. Once a Bhuta tried to steal a present and the Perumal cursed him to become a rock.http://thirunellitemple.com/temples_nearby.php The Sacred sword of Veerabhadra is brought for the Kottiyoor Festival from \\"Mutherikavu\\" a nearby temple. Tons of fire woods are used for the Kottiyoor festival in the shrine. Not even for a single year until now has it been required to remove the excess ash from the altar. All the essentials needed for Ammarakkal Tara is brought from Manathana shrine. Sacred swords also come from Chapparam Bhagavathi temple. Pooja vessals, ornaments etc., come from Karimbanagopuram. Rites and Rituals schedule Present day rituals of Kottiyoor were set out by Sri Shankaracharya. With his spiritual vision, he felt the presence of Shiva at 'Akkare Kottiyoor' and not willing to pollute the holy ground with the touch of his feet, prayed from 'Ekkare Kottiyoor' and left. Bamboo flower maker The Vaisakha Maholsavam festival is held every year during the months of May - June. The twenty eight-day festival commences with the 'Neyyattam' ritual on the 'chodi' Day in Edavam (rishabham) and concludes with the Thrikkalashaattu. The Vaisakha Maholsavam celebrations begin with the ritual of bringing a sword from Muthirerikavu from Wayanad. On the following day, on Visakham star, Bhandaram Ezhunnallath ritual is held. Ornaments and Pooja vessels of pure gold and silver are brought from the nearby Manathana village to Kottiyoor.http://kottiyoordevaswom.com/bhandaram-yezhunnallathu.html The bridge An important ritual during the festival is the 'Elaneer Vayppu' or submitting tender coconuts before the swayambhu Shiva linga. On this special day, thousands of tender coconuts carried from different parts of Kerala by the devotees are submitted. The following day, the Namboothiris of the temple collect water from tender coconuts in pure gold and silver pots and then the Chief Priest pours the collected coconut water on to the idol in what is known as 'Elaneeraattam', also called the 'Rashi velli'.http://kottiyoordevaswom.com/ilaneerattam.html Rohini Aaradhana is a very important ritual which is not seen in any other temple. Kurumathur Brahman (The senior most member of Kurumathur family considered as the embodiment of Vishnu in the ritual) embraces the swayambhu Shiva linga as part of the ritual. This is symbolic of Vishnu pacifying Shiva Who is saddened by the loss of Sati. As a part of the festival, a procession (Ezhunnallippu) is held with two elephants carrying the idols of Shiva and Parvathi. After the procession, the elephants are fed well (Aanayootu) and given a formal farewell.http://kottiyoordevaswom.com/index.php/rituals The 'Thammangadan Nambiar' Family (The Vediyara Chandrothu Family), a sub-branch of the Thiruvithamkur/Kolathiri Royal Family), used to (and still do) have by tradition, exclusive right to being the first to have their Ghee offered to the Deity for 'Abhishekam', during the \\"Naallam Thurakkal\\" ritual, at the Kottiyur Shiva Temple, believed to be the site for the famous Yajna of Daksha. \\"Villippalan Kurup\\" is the name, by which the member of this Family, performing the ghee-offering ritual is known.

The first tropical storm and the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, it developed on June 20 in the western Caribbean Sea off Honduras. For the next two days, it moved generally northward into the Gulf of Mexico. Reaching hurricane intensity on June 23, it then turned northeast toward the Florida peninsula. It made landfall in the Big Bend on June 24, then weakened to a tropical storm over land. Minor damage was reported in Florida, but the storm produced heavy, though beneficial, rains that eased one of the state's worst recorded droughts. Upon entering the Atlantic Ocean, it re-intensified into a hurricane and paralleled the East Coast. On June 26, it struck the Outer Banks of North Carolina as a minimal hurricane, producing minor damage but heavy rainfall. Continuing northeast, the cyclone delivered gale-force winds to New York and southern New England, causing traffic accidents and minor wind damage. Heavy rains drenched the area, and high waves offshore caused ships to need rescue. One man died in a traffic accident; some people were rescued on Long Island Sound. Peak winds on land were at Nantucket, forcing ships to remain in port. The U.S. Coast Guard sought to escort ships at sea into safe harbor. Overall, the impact of the storm was minor, though temperatures fell almost 20 °F the day after the storm. Meteorological history On June 19, a tropical disturbance was detected between Swan Island and the Honduran coast. However, surface data in the vicinity did not indicate a closed circulation until 12 UTC on June 20. At 14 UTC that day, an Air Force reconnaissance plane located near 24°N 84°W reported gale-force winds of (). At the time, this was taken to indicate that a tropical storm had formed about northwest of Swan Island. Reanalysis by the Hurricane Research Division in 2013, however, determined that a tropical storm formed farther northwest, near 19°N 86°W. Squally weather, and winds of moderate tropical storm force, was reported in connection with the tropical storm as it moved generally northward, toward the Yucatán Channel. Little strengthening occurred over the next two days, until after 12 UTC on June 22. At that time, a period of rapid deepening commenced: within 24 hours, the cyclone increased its winds from to . At the same time, its track made a sharp bend toward the northeast, threatening the Florida peninsula. While no central pressure was recorded, Hurricane Hunter aircraft flew into the storm on June 23 and reported winds of at 2015 UTC. As with most early reconnaissance data, such readings are suspect; however, based upon the reconnaissance measurement, the storm was originally listed in the Atlantic hurricane database as a Category 3 hurricane. Later, reanalysis lowered this estimate to , equal to Category 2 on the modern Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, due primarily to the absence of corroboration. After peaking late on June 23, the storm quickly lost intensity. The hurricane continued northeast and made landfall at 08 UTC on June 24, north of the Tampa Bay Area. Although observations were sparse near the eye, the system was estimated to have had winds of , though only minor impacts were reported as few people lived in the landfall area. After making landfall, the center tracked inland between Brooksville and Dunnellon, near the Hernando–Citrus county line. About an hour before 18 UTC, the cyclone returned to water off the Atlantic coast of Florida, passing between St. Augustine and Daytona Beach. Due to interaction with land, maximum sustained winds by then had decreased to . After moving offshore, however, the cyclone quickly regained force. Within seven hours, it re-intensified into a minimal hurricane and paralleled the Southeastern United States, following the warm Gulf Stream. Early on June 26, the northeast-moving hurricane approached the North Carolina coast, and made a second landfall at 01 UTC near Beaufort, North Carolina. Passing very near to Cape Hatteras, the eye of the storm moved offshore at Oregon Inlet, near Wanchese. The storm maintained hurricane intensity as it moved over and northeast of the Outer Banks. At 06 UTC on June 27, the cyclone finally lost tropical characteristics, but still retained winds of hurricane force for another 12 hours. Continuing to the northeast, the extratropical low passed south of Nova Scotia and hit Miquelon, Miquelon-Langlade, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, with winds of . The system survived another four days, only to lose its identity near Iceland at 12 UTC on July 4. Preparations and impact As early as June 19, the U.S. Weather Bureau began sending reconnaissance missions to monitor the developing storm in the Caribbean. The regular reports sent by the airplanes provided valuable data about the intensity of the small cyclone. At 16 UTC (10:00 a.m. local time) on June 23, the U.S. Weather Bureau in New Orleans advised residents from Mobile, Alabama, to Cedar Key, Florida, to prepare for gale-force winds. Areas from Tampa to Grand Isle, Louisiana, were placed under a storm warning. The center of the storm was expected to strike land early on June 24 between Mobile and Panama City, Florida. As the storm intensified into a hurricane, forecasters shifted their predicted landfall point eastward; early on June 24 the Weather Bureau expected the storm to strike between Tampa and Cross City, Florida. Hurricane warnings were issued for the coastline between Tampa and Carrabelle, Florida; meanwhile, storm warnings were issued from Punta Gorda to Titusville. The city of Tallahassee prepared to receive evacuees, and evacuations were ordered for coastal communities in the Big Bend. The Florida Highway Patrol warned local residents to leave the area, and soldiers were transported out of Carrabelle. As the hurricane moved closer to the Big Bend, storm warnings were extended up the Eastern Seaboard to Savannah, Georgia. Between 300–400 military aircraft were flown out of Florida to Birmingham, Alabama. Once the storm left Florida, additional evacuations commenced between Georgetown, South Carolina, and Cape Hatteras, including the North Carolina communities of Wilmington, Morehead City, and nearby resort towns. Large-scale evacuations from the Wilmington area alone involved 5,000 people and were credited with reducing loss of life. Meanwhile, storm warnings were extended northward to Norfolk, Virginia; however, only minor impacts occurred in Carolinas and Virginia. Nevertheless, the cyclone continued to parallel the East Coast, so storm warnings were eventually extended to Atlantic City, New Jersey; small watercraft in the Northeastern United States were advised to stay in port. Winds in the Tampa Bay Area reached tropical storm force, , at 05 UTC on June 24. At that time, the \\"center\\" of the storm was estimated to be across. Near the point of landfall, the hurricane defoliated citrus trees and downed power lines, and flash floods washed out roadways. Throughout its path, the hurricane generated prolific rains. Peak rainfall along the path totaled at Lake Alfred; West Palm Beach recorded of rain within a 24-hour period. Rainfall in Orange County exceeded , which proved beneficial to dry orange groves; the heavy rains ended one of the worst droughts in Florida's history. Overall, damage in the Miami area was described as being slight, totaling $75,000 (1945 USD). The hurricane also produced two tornadoes in Florida, one near LaBelle and another near Melbourne. Along the Georgia coast, the hurricane produced only fringe impacts, including strong winds and heavy rain. Wind gusts to were reported from Tybee Island, and portions of coastal North Carolina received up to of rain. In New York and New England, the outer bands of the hurricane produced gale-force winds and high surf; peak winds were reported at up to on Long Island Sound, and large waves caused some boats to capsize and people to need rescue. Offshore, even higher velocities were reported: a weather station on Nantucket, Massachusetts, measured a peak wind of , and in the Atlantic Ocean winds reaching battered Coast Guard vessels. The Coast Guard nevertheless sought to escort troubled ships into port. Heavy rainfall fell across coastal New England, peaking at on Nantucket. The heavy rains and gale-force winds hindered normal traffic; a vehicle struck and killed a man at Warwick, Rhode Island. At least 10,000 telephone lines were taken out of service, 7,000 of them in the Cape Cod region. Besides causing power outages, the stormy conditions damaged trees, buildings, and crops; in the Boston area, high winds knocked down trees and chimneys. A strong temperature gradient existed between the cyclone and the Northeast U.S.: in New York City, the daily high on June 26 was almost 20° F lower than on the preceding day.

It was created in the year 1997. The sketch has been performed by Pramod Kamble who is a creative painter and sculptor.Drawing on Wall He created it as a tribute to the nation on the occasion of 50 years of independence. It was painted on the specially prepared wall of Mahavir Art Gallery in Ahmednagar. Pramod has portrayed Bharat Mata (goddess of Indian Independence) and 500 great people born out of Indian culture.http://www.ahmednagarpride.com/pramod_kamble_ahmednagar.html This is supposed to be the world's biggest pencil sketch. This is the only fixed asset in India which was made as a part of India's 50th Independence day celebration. Background The project was started with the vision of contributing on the occasion of 50th year of Indian independence. Attracting attention of the tourist towards Ahmadnagar was also one of the aims. Initially it was decided to portray some pictures which depict the struggle of Indian Independence. Later it was decided to draw pictures of some great Indian personalities. The team of friends comprising from various fields helped Pramod in finalizing the list of people to be included. Initially sketches of 250 people were planned but later it reached to number 500. Categorization was done of these 500 personalities, which was a part of preparation of the project. The various categories made were – sages, deities, freedom fighters, Bharat Ratna awardees, Dadasaheb Phalke awardees, GyanPeeth awardees, Param Vir Chakra recipients and the masters in various fields of life that includes sportspersons, musicians, dancers, painters, theater personalities, singers, social activists, pioneer industrialist etc. Various sources including encyclopedias, magazines, books were referred. Sakal, a Marathi newspaper, helped in getting some rare sketches which were not easily available. Project execution The project preparation started in the year of 1996. The actual work of drawing pencil sketch started in May 1997. It got completed on the eve of independence day of 1997. (15 Aug 1997). It took 72 consecutive days, which was 1728 hours of work. Pramod dedicated 3 months for this project. He had to work at night to reduce disturbance of street watchers. The artist believes that this pencil sketch was the turning point in his life. Expenses made for this painting were 500,000 Rs. It included preparations of the wall, painting of the wall and other procedures to make the wall ready for pencil drawing. Swati Kamble, Mandar Kulkarni had supported for identification of right people for drawing as a part of project. Initially, the pencil required for the sketch were sponsored by Camlin (A pencil company) till the completion of the project. The drawing came very nice due to this and with right contribution/support to Pramod Kamble by members. Project details The top of the sketch comprises the sages. These include Ram, Krishna, Vyas, Dnyaneshwar, Tukaram, Gautam Buddha, Gurunanak etc. The Bharat mata at the center is holding the tri-colour map of India. The Bharat mata means country India. The later part contains freedom fighters of India. The Bharat Ratna Laureates are just besides that. Various sports personalities are drawn on the left side and various singers and music artists are drawn on the right. Sketches of the artists (like dancers) are made along with their poses. Sketches of musical artists are made along with their musical instruments. For easy identification, sport personalities are also drawn with their famous poses or sport instruments. No water color or any special material is used for this project.

He is also a former professor of pharmacology at the medical school at said university. He received his bachelor's degree in chemistry, at Brown University, 1948. He received a master's degree and a PhD in physiological chemistry at the University of Rochester, where he published some scientific studies about the synthesis of isoalloxazine ring-containing compounds. He did a postdoctoral with Nobel Laureate Arthur Kornberg in the department of biochemistry at Stanford University School of Medicine. He has done sabbatical scholar-in-residence at MIT and at the University of California at San Diego. He is best known for his pioneering work on Succimer and Unithiol in the treatment of arsenic, mercury, lead and other heavy metals leading to FDA approval of succimer in childhood lead poisoning at levels over 40 ug/dl. Previous posts he had held include at Vanderbilt, Tufts University, and the University of Maryland. His views about mercury in vaccines and in dental amalgams go against the consensus of the medical community and are controversial. Research Aposhian's first academic appointment was to Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, and he was an instructor there from 1954 to 1956. Some of his research has been published in the Journal of Virology, and in the autism omnibus trial he testified that he was \\"the first one to show that a virus could transfer genetic information that was not in it originally.\\" He also testified that he acted as a biochemical geneticist from 1959 until he went to teach at Tufts University in 1967, during which time he was affiliated with Stanford University. He would leave Tufts in 1970 to become department chair at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. He has published more than 100 peer-reviewed studies on heavy metal poisoning. In 1964, Aposhian, along with, notably Arthur Kornberg, both of whom were affiliated with Stanford University at the time, published \\"Enzymatic Synthesis of Deoxyribonucleic Acid\\" in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. Kornberg would go on to win the Nobel Prize for discovering the biological mechanism by which DNA is synthesized. His more recent research has focused on the metabolism of arsenic compounds, in particular, deciphering polymorphisms in the gene that codes for glutathione S-transferase, which is involved in arsenic detoxification. Some of this research he has authored along with his wife, Mary M. Aposhian, who died in 2009. Professor Aposhian is one of the world's leading authorities and has carried out extensive research and written many publications on the toxicology of heavy metals, in particular arsenic and mercury. This has included the enzymology of arsenic biotransformation; the study of human populations in Chile, Inner Mongolia, Romania, Mexico and rural Southwest China as to their body burden of arsenic or mercury; the human metabolism of chelating agents; and biochemical genetics in particular gene transfer in mammalian cells. Views on mercury exposure Aposhian has advocated for the view that thimerosal-containing vaccines cause autism, and testified before the Institute of Medicine in 2004 before they issued a review concluding that the evidence favors rejecting a vaccine-autism link. The World Health Organisation (W.H.O.) on the other hand are adamant in their view that thimerosal (aka thiomersal) is a serious threat to human health and are pushing for a worldwide ban. =Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services= In the 2007 court case Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Aposhian was the first witness called to the stand by the claimant's lawyers. In his testimony, Aposhian elaborated on a potential hypothesis as to how MMR and thimerosal-containing vaccines might have worked together to cause autism. The proposed mechanism involved something known as \\"mercury efflux disorder\\", and Aposhian testified that \\"The hypothesis was made less than three or four weeks ago.\\" He also stated that efflux disorders have been documented before, and described them as \\"problems with getting a metal, in this case mercury, out of a cell\\", citing Wilson's disease as an example thereof. Aposhian also testified, with regard to the concept of a dose- response relationship, that \\"This is an ancient form of quotation that until recently we taught in medical schools, and in undergraduate school, and in graduate school. We now have to consider the hyper susceptibility of people.\\" According to Arthur Allen, author of the book Vaccine, \\"On cross examination, Aposhian acknowledged there was no record of any child becoming autistic as a result of mercury exposures prior to the thimerosal theory.\\" In the end, the special master decided that \\"The reports and advice given to the Cedillos by Dr. [Arthur] Krigsman and some other physicians, advising the Cedillos that there is a causal connection between Michelle’s MMR vaccination and her chronic conditions, have been very wrong. Unfortunately, the Cedillos have been misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment\\". The decisions in the case implied that doctors who base their treatments on them are unscientific and unethical. Dental amalgam controversy In addition to being opposed to mercury in vaccines, Aposhian has also voiced concern about the safety of mercury in dental amalgam fillings. On July 11, 1994, Aposhian was interviewed for a BBC program entitled \\"Poison in the Mouth.\\" The host of the program, Tom Mangold, said that Aposhian's research had shown that two-thirds of the mercury in the body came from dental amalgam fillings. Additionally, when a meeting, \\"Mercury in Medicine: Are we taking unnecessary risks?\\", was held on July 18, 2000, Aposhian said, \\"The mercury amalgams in your mouth, the so-called silver fillings, contain 48 to 50 percent of elemental mercury. These fillings continuously emit mercury vapor, which will go to the brain and is converted to mercuric mercury….Certain fish contain methylmercury; again, very rapidly taken up from the GI tract, transported quickly to the brain, and converted very slowly to mercuric mercury….thimerosal which again will be taken up by the brain and quickly converted to mercuric mercury – all three forms are neurotoxic. By neurotoxic, we mean it will damage nerve and it will damage brain tissues.\\" These concerns are supported by Aposhian's \\"research\\", which has concluded that there exists \\"a positive correlation between the amount of amalgam in the teeth and the amount of amalgam in the body\\" of subjects who were given the widely discredited \\"provoked testing\\" chelating agent 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid. This method however has been proven to provide unreliable results which do not reflect the true \\"body burden\\" of heavy metals in the patient.

Biography Chris Stephens describes Edgar Hubert as having produced 'some of this country's most radical abstract paintings of the 1930s'. Born Norman Edgar Hubert on 1 June 1906 in Billingshurst, West Sussex, he spent his boyhood in Clevedon, Somerset. He studied art at the Reading School of Art (now University of Reading) and, from 1926 to 1929, at the Slade School of Fine Art. Henry Tonks was one of his tutors at the Slade and he shared rooms with William Townsend (who wrote of Hubert in his journals and other papers) during his time there. In the late 1930s, due to ill health, Hubert left London to live with his family in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. He was deeply affected by the deaths, between 1936 and 1947, of his father and two brothers. He continued to live with his mother until her death in about 1960. He then moved to Seaford, East Sussex. Hubert's lifelong shyness and introversion contributed to a neglect of his work in histories of twentieth century British art. When his close friend and colleague Geoffrey Tibble died in 1952, Hubert became reclusive and withdrew from the art world. Hubert continued to paint until shortly before his death on 25 January 1985. Style Hubert's early work was figurative, developing into both abstract and semi-figurative styles. Between 1933 and 1936, Hubert was a significant figure in the Objective Abstraction movement with Graham Bell, William Coldstream, Rodrigo Moynihan and Geoffrey Tibble. Hubert's 'Painting 1935-6' at the Tate is from this period. Many of the artists involved in Objective Abstraction went on to be part of the realist Euston Road School but Hubert continued to work in both abstract and semi- figurative styles. Influenced by Surrealism and geometric abstraction, his wartime paintings were of post-Cubist figures and abstractions of geometrical linear patterns. His later paintings included more organic forms, together with geometric patterns (several in black and white). Exhibitions In 1930, Hubert exhibited in the First Exhibition of the Young Painters Society, New Burlington Galleries. Between 1931 and 1947, Hubert regularly exhibited with the London Group. In 1942 his work was shown at the Lefevre Gallery, in 1946 at the London Gallery and the Anglo-French Art Centre, and in 1948 and 1953 at the Mayor Gallery. He had one-person exhibitions at the Mayor Gallery in 1946 and in 1948. Also in 1948, with encouragement from Lawrence Alloway, Hubert submitted his work to the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) exhibition 40 Years of Modern Art 1907-1947. In 1958, the ICA held a one-person exhibition Paintings by Edgar Hubert. In Paris, his work was shown at the British Council's La Jeune Peinture en Grande Bretagne (1948) and the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles (1949). Hubert was included in the exhibition British Art and the Modern Movement 1930-40 held by the National Museum of Wales Cardiff in 1962. The Fine Art Society exhibition Edgar Hubert 1906-1985 was held in 2005, reviving interest in his work. In 2014, one of Hubert's works was acquired by the Jerwood Foundation for the Jerwood Collection of 20th and 21st century British art.

As the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe rejected the names proposed by the Maltese Government, Bonello's term was extended, in terms of article 23 para. 1 3 CON of the European Convention on Human Rights, until 19 September 2010.Yearbook of the European Convention on Human Rights. 1959. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers. In 1990, he was nominated Chief Justice and President of the Constitutional Court but declined the appointment. Bonello has been considered a \\"liberal\\" judge. He has been the first judge whose separate opinions were published during his tenure, later also the separate opinions of the Portuguese judge Paulo Pinto de Albuquerque were also published in Italy. Judge (later Court President) Nicolas Bratza and leading authority on Human Rights Law Michael O'Boyle published them with Wolf Legal Publishers of the Netherlands. His separate opinions were also collected in the book When Judges Dissent, published in 2008. Bonello has published several history books.Bonello, Giovanni (2000). Art in Malta - Discoveries and Recoveries. Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti. p. 17. . . He also wrote a series of articles for the Times of Malta, celebrating the life of Caterina Scappi, founder of the first hospital exclusively for women in Malta: \\"For her absolutely pioneer social commitment, for this revolutionary philanthropy, Scappi deserves the monument she never got. Only an obscure and overlooked tombstone in the Carmelite church in Valletta today bears witness to her existence, her feminist vision and her generous, farsighted altruism.\\" Upon his retirement from the European Court of Human Rights, Court president Jean-Paul Costa said “Vanni” brought “robust independence of spirit and unflagging commitment to the protection of human rights”. He displayed such qualities time and again in numerous separate opinions given in his unique and memorable style, which was “elegant as it is forceful”, using “vocabulary as rich as it is rare”. In fact, his opinions led Judge Bonello to attain “near-legendary” status among all those who followed Strasbourg case law, he said. President Costa said Judge Bonello was a true gentlemen who gained the respect and affection of all those who worked with him, whether they agreed with him or not. He was a marvellous ambassador for his profession and his country. “Along with his professional achievements, Vanni is a man of broad and deep culture, a connoisseur of great art and a distinguished historian. Now that he can finally take his leave of the Court, he can and will dedicate himself more fully to these intellectual and aesthetic pursuits.” The president recounted an anecdote about the man he befriended during his long term at the Court. He said he had tried making a modest personal contribution to Judge Bonello’s historical studies about the French occupation of Malta during the Napoleonic era, however, he soon realised his assistance was almost useless because Judge Bonello knew virtually everything there was to know on the subject.

Born in Bellavista (El Callao, Peru) on 28 September 1913. During the Second World War he was assigned by the Swiss consulate to oversee the interests of Peruvian citizens living in Munich, Germany. During that time Ernesto Pinto-Bazurco issued visas that allowed some Jewish families to leave Germany.Cfr. Rittler, Hildegard. Ángeles en el infierno, Madrid: LID Editorial, 2010  Biography  Ernesto Pinto-Bazurco was born on 28 September 1913 to Moises Pinto-Bazurco and Rosa, née Alcalde. Moises Pinto-Bazurco was a master in mathematics and an officer in the Peruvian navy. Rosa Alcalde was a founder of a transport passenger business in Lima. In 1934 Ernesto Pinto-Bazurco travelled to Germany, contracted by the pharmaceutical company Bayer to study medicine. Pinto-Bazurco participated in various activities at the Casa Peru in Munich, which was a Multi-Cultural centre frequented by mainly Peruvians, Latin Americans and locals to the region of Bavaria, Germany. That is where Pinto- Bazurco met his future wife Hildegard Rittler, native of Rosenheim, Bavaria, with whom he had 3 children: Rosa, born in 1942; Oscar Aurelio, born in 1945 and Ernesto, born in 1946. = World War II = At the start of World War II many Latin-Americans immigrants in Germany fled to other countries. Ernesto Pinto-Bazurco decided to stay in Munich, serving gratitude to the country that allowed him to study medicine and realizing that during war times the demand for doctors would be high. During the first years of World War II Pinto- Bazurco worked as a doctor in a Munich hospital (Allgemeines Krankenhaus). The Nazi regime denied his 3 marriage attempts to Hildegard Rittler suggesting that it wasn’t acceptable that German women would marry a Peruvian where they were so many German men with whom she could marry.Cfr. Rittler, Hildegard. Cuando el amor vence la guerra, In early 1942, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Peru broke its relations with countries under the Axis alliance and withdrew its diplomats from Germany. The Peruvian consulate in Munich was transferred to Switzerland. On 17 February, Ernesto Pinto-Bazurco was arrested by the Gestapo on the accusations of spying in the favour of the allies, on the grounds that his father was a Navy officer for a nation that was in opposition to the Nazi regime and the fact that he was one of a few Peruvians that stayed after the war had started. He was first imprisoned in the Munich Police station and then he was transferred to a fort in the city of Laufen very close to the Austrian border. He was liberated on 14 May of the same year without any arrest charges.Cfr. Diario El Comercio, 30 de agosto de 2009, pág. b5 = Swiss Consulate Post = As soon as Peruvians relations broke with Germany, the Swiss Confederation assumed representation of Peru in Germany.Cfr. Del Campo, Juan. El Tercer Reich visto por Torre Tagle, Lima, 2012. The Swiss consulate in Germany assigned Ernesto Pinto-Bazurco to represent the interests of Peruvian citizens living in Munich. Under these circumstances, Pinto-Bazurco is wanted by some Jewish families who were in hiding and who asked Pinto-Bazurco for help to escape Nazi persecution. When he asked one of these Jewish families (they were escaping to Argentina) why they sought his help, they told him that the surname Pinto is of Sephardic Jewish origin. Pinto-Bazurco granted the necessary documentation without asking for any payment or benefit in return. Furthermore, Ernesto Pinto- Bazurco took care of some Jewish families, who dared not go to a public hospitals for fear of being arrested by the Nazis. When the Second World War ended, the Peruvian ship Rimac repatriated some Peruvians who had stayed during the war. Among them was the Pinto-Bazurco family. In Peru, Hildegard Rittler carried out peaceful activities and promoted the positives that German culture had to offer, earning her the German \\"Cross of Merit\\". Hildegard Rittler wrote her testimonial about those years lived with Ernesto Pinto- Bazurco in the novels \\"Angels in Hell\\" and \\"When love conquers war\\".

It was founded and built in 1817 by Hugh Munro on his estate of Teaninich Castle. Despite an initial difficulty of procuring barley whisky owing to a high demand from illegal distilleries, by 1830 Teaninich produced 30 times more spirit than it did at its founding. At that point Munro sold the distillery to his younger brother Lieutenant- General John Munro. As an officer he spent most of his time in India, so he decided to rent the distillery out to Robert Pattison in 1850. The lease lasted to 1869 after which Munro leased it to John McGilchrist Ross. Ross relinquished the lease in 1895, and in 1898 Robert Innes Cameron took a stake in the distillery, and Munro and Cameron renovated and extended the distillery, investing £10,000 in to the renovations. In 1904 Cameron, who also owned stakes in Benrinnes, Linkwood and Tamdhu, took over the distillery completely. After Cameron died in 1933 the distillery was sold to Scottish Malt Distillers. The distillery suspended production between 1939 and 1946 due to barley shortages during World War II. In 1970 the distillery was greatly expanded, and an entire new building with six new stills was taken in operation. The four older stills remained in operation alongside the new stills. The old side of the distillery was then updated over the next decade. First, new installations for milling, mashing and fermentation were built in 1973, and in 1975 the distillery added a dark grains plant, which produces cattle feed from the draff. In 1984 the old side of the distillery was mothballed, and the new side followed the next year, temporarily ending production entirely. The new side of the distillery resumed production in 1991. The old side didn't resume production, and was demolished in 1999. In 2000 a mash filter press was installed in the distillery, which is unique in Scottish malt whisky production; all other Scottish whisky distilleries use mash tuns. In April 2013 owner Diageo announced a new renovation of the distillery. They also announced a new distillery with 16 new stills will be placed next to the old distillery. The new distillery is planned to have a different name than Teaninich, and produce a separate whisky. The distillery mainly produces malts for blending, and it is used in Johnnie Walker Red Label. There are no official bottlings of the malt. Since 1992 a 10-year-old malt has been available in the flora and fauna series.

A Roman road, Sarn Helen, runs along its entire northeast–southwest ridge-line, a route followed by a modern-day byway. To its west is Cwm Dulais and to its southeast is the Vale of Neath. The northern end of the ridge falls away to a broad upland vale containing the Afon Pyrddin and beyond which is the Brecon Beacons National Park. The larger part of the hill is afforested with conifers. In between the plantations are areas of past or present opencasting for coal.  Geology  The upper parts of the hill are formed from the hard-wearing sandstones and intervening mudstones of the Pennant Sandstone. Beneath these are the mudstones and coal seams of the South Wales Coal Measures. All the strata are tilted in a generally southerly direction towards the axis of the South Wales Coalfield syncline though there is significant local variation, due in part to the proximity of the eastern slopes of the hill to the Neath Disturbance.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 map sheet 231 Merthyr Tydfil & accompanying memoir  Burial cairn  The Bronze Age Carn Cornel Round Cairn is on the shoulder of hillside, west of the ridge and Roman road.

() is a 2013 Swedish drama film written and directed by Lukas Moodysson and adapted from the graphic novel Never Goodnight by his wife, Coco Moodysson. The film was screened in the Special Presentation section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot 1982 Stockholm: Bobo and Klara are 13-year-old girls ostracized by their peers for their love of punk rock. Androgynous, with short hair and baggy clothes, they endure the wrath of condescending teen boys who play in a rock band called Iron Fist at their youth center. The girls start their own band to irritate the boys, though neither can play an instrument. Bobo feels neglected by her single mother and uses punk as a means of escape. Klara is angry and political and writes the sardonic lyrics she sings. The duo ask a shy and friendless Christian girl, Hedvig, to join their band after seeing her classical-guitar performance at their school talent show. Hedvig teaches them to play chords and sing harmonies. She's a respectful and patient teacher even though Klara tries to convince her not to believe in God. Bobo and Klara talk Hedvig into letting them cut her hair into a short, punk style. Hedvig's mother threatens to report this to the police unless they go to church with her for a few weeks. Bobo and Klara refuse, Klara's father having told them that what they did was not a crime. At school, Hedvig avoids Bobo and Klara; they think this is because she is angry at them. In fact, they learn, Hedvig is just embarrassed by her mother's behavior and assuming that Bobo and Klara are angry at her. They remain friends. Klara then suggests that Hedvig needs an electric guitar. Lacking the necessary funds, they panhandle at the mall, but spend the money they receive on sweets instead. After seeing a magazine interview with a local punk band consisting of three similarly aged boys from Solna, they call up one of its members, Elis. He agrees to meet them at the train station, but reveals that they are now just a duo after kicking out their third member. The three girls, Elis, and his bandmate Mackan go to his band's rehearsal space. Klara and Elis pair off, and Mackan gravitates toward Hedvig. Bobo is frustrated at being left out. Later she calls Elis and meets up with him. After she confesses this to Klara, they fight, but Hedvig makes them reconcile. One of the youth counselors attempts to teach Hedvig to play electric guitar but she proves to be a better player than he. Bobo is frustrated playing drums and angry that Klara won't let her try the bass. The youth counselors book Iron Fist and the girls' band at a small gig in Västerås. After the audience heckles them, Klara changes the lyrics of their song \\"Hate the Sport!\\" to \\"Hate Västerås!,\\" causing a minor riot. This earns them Iron Fist's respect. On the bus back to Stockholm, Bobo, Klara and Hedvig declare, \\"We are the best!\\" The youth counselors respond that they are the worst, but the girls laugh and carry on. The film ends with Klara's father playing clarinet on the toilet.

Written by Hanif Kureishi, the film is the fourth collaboration between Michell and Kureishi, who both began developing the story seven years prior during a weekend trip to Montmartre. It was screened in the Special Presentation section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot A married academic couple from Birmingham celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary, Nick (Jim Broadbent) and Meg Burrows (Lindsay Duncan) arrive in Paris from England. Meg finds the lodging selected by Nick to be unsuitable and they book a room at much more expensive hotel. Their relationship vacillates, with conflict more often in evidence than affection. Among other things Meg is frustrated by a phone call from their son which reveals Nick's repeated willingness to take the idle son back into their home. Over the weekend Nick and Meg spend time in the hotel and visiting bars and restaurants. During a lunch, Nick reveals that he has been instructed to take early retirement and Meg reveals that she has been considering leaving Nick to be free to take up new interests. They bump into Morgan (Jeff Goldblum), with whom Nick went to university and who is now a wealthy writer. Morgan's success stands in sharp contrast to Nick and Megs' plodding careers and lives. Leaving the hotel on one of their excursions, Nick pauses and comments on a favorite movie (the dance scene from Bande à part) that is playing on the TV. All efforts at thrift put aside, Nick and Meg visit an expensive restaurant. On seeing the bill Meg asks Nick to wait outside. Meg descends to the basement and finds a way out without paying the bill. Emerging at street level, Meg calls Nick over to break open a grille to let her out. Nick and Meg attend a dinner party at Morgan's place. Before dinner is served Meg agrees to meet another man later and tells Nick about the planned meeting. When dinner is served Morgan makes a toast to Nick, giving tribute to Nick's formative influence on him when they were younger, and Nick's successes in personal life. Nick rises and tells the entire dinner party that he has not had academic success, his wife has a date with another man, and he is financially distressed. Meg then rises and says tells of a recent call overheard by a friend who, given Meg's bright demeanor, asked Meg whether she was talking to her secret lover. The call, she said, was with her husband. Nick and Meg leave the party arm-in-arm. The next day Nick handles a second call from their son telling him he cannot return to the home that is now just he and Meg. When they return to their hotel they learn that they have exceeded their credit card limit. They bolt and ask Morgan to come to their aid. He arrives at the cafe bringing sympathy and the possibility of help. The movie ends as Nick puts a familiar tune on the jukebox. Nick dances in the midst of the cafe where Meg joins him, followed by the always curious Morgan, recreating the scene from Bande à part.

He was credited with being an innovator in the television news industry, breaking away from the conventional mold that had been used by other independent stations. His approach ended up being a success, first in Miami and then in Boston.

Ansin was sent back to Massachusetts for preparatory school at Andover Academy. After two years at Harvard University, he graduated in 1957 from the University of Pennsylvania with a BS in Economics. His brother is former Massachusetts commerce commissioner Ronald Ansin. Ronald bought Anwelt Shoe from his father in 1966. Career In 1962, Ansin and his father formed Sunbeam Television Corporation after Sidney Ansin purchased the license for Miami's NBC- affiliated television station, WCKT, for $3.4 million. Ed Ansin became an executive vice president at Sunbeam; after his father's death in 1971, he became Sunbeam's president. WCKT changed its call letters to WSVN in 1983, and at the end of 1988, WSVN lost its affiliation with NBC and Ansin, after rebuking then CBS chairman Laurence Tisch's offer to purchase the station, found himself without network affiliation. The station affiliated with the up- start Fox network, and supplemented its local news broadcasts with content from the newly launched CNN satellite network. Rather than follow the conventional approach used by successful independent stations (morning kids' shows, afternoon game shows, evening movies, and syndicated sitcoms), Ansin instead decided to focus on news. Instead of dry and stoic presentation, he and his news director, Joel Cheatwood, created the now ubiquitous 'Miami News style' with fast-paced reporting, crime-led stories, live breaking coverage, and pretty presenters. \\"If it bleeds, it leads\\" became an industry catch phrase. The approach was wildly successful and WSVN news soon became the market leader. WSVN reported $96 million in revenues in 2011. In 1993, Ansin bought Boston's WHDH Channel 7. He shortened the time spent on individual news stories, relied heavily on video and audio effects, and emphasized \\"on-the- spot\\" reporting. In 2006, Sunbeam Television purchased Boston's WLVI, a CW Television Network affiliate, from Tribune Broadcasting.; Sunbeam Properties, a subsidiary of Sunbeam Television, developed the 400-acre Miramar Park of Commerce, the largest business park in Broward County.South Florida Business Journal, \\"Younger Ansin gains accolades for development\\", Lois Perdue February 28, 2000 Philanthropy Ansin was the only person who has received the United Way's Alexis de Tocqueville Award for philanthropy in three different cities.

Depending on the source, his death was either a suicideDavid Felix, Protest: Sacco-Vanzetti and the Intellectuals (1965), 75-76, 80 or a homicide;McCormick, Charles H., Hopeless Cases, The Hunt For The Red Scare Terrorist Bombers (2005), Lanham Maryland: University Press of America, p. 60 nevertheless, the case was widely debated both for its unclear nature and for its consequences on the Bureau and was one of the premises of the Sacco and Vanzetti case.The Sacco-Vanzetti Case, University of PennsylvaniaSacco e Vanzetti uccisi con la «sedia elettrica»., La Stampa, April 15, 1981, p. 5. Biography Andrea Salsedo was born in Pantelleria, in the Italian region of Sicily. A committed anarchist since his youth, he soon became involved in local politics, and was part of the anarchist club Circolo Sociale founded by Luigi Galleani, who was in Pantelleria as he had been exiled there. In those years, Salsedo became a personal friend of Galleani. On November 11, 1900, he was tried because of subversive views he had expressed in a letter published in L'Avvenire Sociale, a newspaper published in Messina; the trial, however, did not lead to any conviction. Salsedo then moved to the United States, and after a brief period in Tunisia, he arrived in New York City in 1910. There he met his friend Galleani and supported him in the creation and distribution of his magazine Cronaca Sovversiva. Salsedo also wrote a number of articles for the magazine. The Justice Department of New York included Salsedo in a list of anarchists who fled to Mexico in order to avoid military service.Kurt Vonnegut, Jailbird, Random House, 2011, pp. 175-176. The list also included Nicola Sacco, Bartolomeo Vanzetti, Roberto Elia and Luigi Galleani. All anarchists who were part of Galleani's acquaintances, who were also called Galleanists, were put under surveillance, as they were considered dangerous and possible terrorists. On 25 February 1920, Salsedo, who was working in the Canzani Printshop as a typesetter at the time, was arrested and brought to the BOI offices on Park Row. Salsedo was considered as one of the writers of radical pamphlet Plain Words. At the BOI offices, Salsedo was harshly interrogated and was denied the right to phone his lawyer and his family. According to some sources, he stayed in the offices for eight weeks,Licia Pinelli; Piero Scaramucci, Una storia quasi soltanto mia, Feltrinelli, 2009, p. 141. incommunicado.Philip Dray, There is Power in a Union, Random House, 2010, p. 408. On 3 May 1920, his body was found on the pavement in front of the BOI offices: he had fallen from the 14th floor. How Salsedo died is still unclear. Some sources say that he got up at night, silently walked across the room and jumped out the window, killing himself.Ackerman, Kenneth: Young J. Edgar: Hoover and the Red Scare 1919-1920, 2011, Chapter 40. According to Roberto Elia, Salsedo could have been killed for fear of betraying other fellow anarchists. The Boston Herald reported that before dying, Salsedo gave names of other terrorist plotters.Stevan Chermak; Frankie Bailey, Crimes and Trials of the Century, 2007, p. 23. Other sources, on the contrary, say that Salsedo was severely beaten numerous times during his interrogations,Michael Newton, The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes, Infobase, 2009, p. 9. and was ultimately killed by officers, who hurled him out the window. Salsedo's death happened just two days prior to Sacco and Vanzetti's arrest.

She served primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic. After the war she was sold to the Venezuelan Navy. She was named for Dunvegan, Nova Scotia. Background Flower-class corvettes like Dunvegan serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different to earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which – in the Royal Navy – were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Dunvegan was ordered 22 January 1940 as part of the 1939–1940 Flower-class building program. She was laid down on 30 August 1940 by Marine Industries Ltd. at Sorel and launched 11 December of that year. Dunvegan was commissioned 9 September 1941 at Sorel. She went in for her first refit in December 1941 for repairs which took until January 1942. A second refit took place in October 1943 where, in Baltimore, her fo'c'sle was extended. The refit took until December 1943 to complete. War service After workups, Dunvegan joined Sydney Force. In November 1941 she transferred to Newfoundland Command where she was placed in unit N16 as an ocean escort for a short period. After returning from one of her first convoys, she was sent on to Halifax for repairs. Dunvegan returned to service with N12 of Newfoundland Command before joining Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) group C-2 in March 1942. In June 1942 she joined Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) and in June 1943, assigned to escort group W-8. She served with that group until a major refit took her off duty. After workups in Bermuda, she returned to service with WLEF as a member of escort group W-6 which she served with until the end of the war. On 7 May 1945, Dunvegan was detached from convoy SC 175 to help escort the captured back to port. Postwar service Independencia in Venezuelan Navy service Dunvegan was paid off on 3 July 1945 at Sorel. In 1946 she was sold to Venezuela and renamed ARV Independencia. She served with the Venezuelan Navy into the 1950s until she was broken up in 1953.

The construction of the cabin suggests that it was built during the antebellum period. A 1 1/2-story log building with a gable roof, the cabin consists of one room with a loft above, and a brick and stone chimney. Also found on the northwest side of the property is a wood storage shed, a chicken house, and an outhouse, dating from around 1930.  Cabin description  The cabin sits on a low, random-rubble fieldstone foundation, although portions of the foundation have subsided. The first floor walls are constructed of V-notched logs with the chinking between the logs still mostly intact and in fair to good condition, with evidence of repair. There is a plank door entrance to the right and a 6x6 window to the left on the south side of the cabin. To the north or rear side of the cabin, there is also an entrance with a six-panel door. The east end of the cabin contains a 6x6, double-hung sash wood window centrally placed on the first floor, and a 4x4 wood sash window directly overhead in the gable. All the window and door openings are surrounded with simple wooden frames of flat boards without molded profiles that appear to be mid-twentieth-century. The exterior west wall stone chimney is composed of cut blocks and fieldstone (mid-twentieth- century mortar repair) with a brick chimney-stack in American bond. The stack rises from stone shoulders that begin where the log portion of the wall meets the clapboard section at the base of the gable. Within the first-floor room of the cabin, there is a fireplace at the west end. The fireplace has a solid brick mantel and a small brick firebox. At the opposite end of the room, immediately adjacent to the primary, south entrance, there is a dog-leg stair with two steps rising to shallow landing toward the loft. The stair indicates mild repairs but is primarily in its original condition. The first floor interior walls of the cabin show signs of modernization, possibly in the 1960s, but the loft walls are still unfinished. The cabin flooring has also been replaced, dating early to mid-twentieth center. The roof rafters are exposed with broad planks and a metal roof sitting atop. In the gable ends the studs and interior sides of the weatherboard cladding are exposed. = Historical significance = Associated with slavery, the Civil War, and Reconstruction in Mecklenburg County, Virginia, the Sydnor log cabin was a significant \\"home place\\" for several generations of African Americans from Reconstruction to the mid-twentieth century. and Accompanying four photos The property was first sold to Lovice \\"Vicey\\" Skipwith (1856–1936), a former slave of Prestwould Plantation, from the holdings of the Skipwith family and Prestwould Plantation, in 1888. A purchase of this sort is representative of the histories of African-American families in Mecklenburg County and other parts of Virginia, who established themselves as farmers, after the Civil War, often on the very plantations or land adjacent to the plantations where they were once enslaved. The log cabin that Vicey Skipwith purchased would eventually become a home place to several African-American families in Mecklenburg County's Bluestone District. One such African-American family was that of Patrick Robert \\"Parker\\" Sydnor.  Patrick Robert \\"Parker\\" Sydnor  Parker Sydnor was a stone carver who lived in the area of Cabin Point, Virginia, residing in the log cabin during the 1930s and 1940s. He worked for more than 40 years at his craft, and many African Americans came to him to have gravestones made for their deceased loved ones. Significantly, Sydnor was both literate and an expert stone carver.Angelita Reyes (Arizona State University) interviewed Paul Saunier, a retired University of Virginia Provost to discuss an interview that Saunier conducted in 1946 of Parker Sydnor. Saunier, 96, recalled moments from his 1946 interview of Sydnor, \\"87 Year-Old Tombstone Maker Mixes Own: Finds Market for Homemade Markers Good\\" (The Richmond Time Dispatch, Friday, September 13, 1946, p. 2.), sharing original photos and letters. He was also associated with many African-American families living in the vicinity of Cabin Point during the twentieth and twenty-first century, as well as the African-American churches and funeral parlors in the surrounding area. Although Parker Sydnor and Vicey Skipwith were acquaintances from Bluestone District, they were not biologically related. These two were known to each other as \\"fictive kin,\\" a term which refers to individuals who are unrelated by either birth or marriage, but who have an extended significant relationship to one another, which takes on the characteristics of a family-oriented relationship.  Background  The restored antebellum plantation of Sir Peyton Skipwith (1740–1805) and Lady Jean Skipwith (1748–1826) in Mecklenburg County, Virginia is well known for both its historical and architectural significance established by its listing as a National Historic Landmark in 2007. A National Historic Landmark (NHL) is a building, site, structure, or object that is officially recognized by the United States government for its national-level historical significance. A historic map of Prestwould plantation documents that the Sydnor log cabin property, about a mile from the manor house of Prestwould, was once a part of the original Prestwould estate.1798 John Hill Plat of Prestwould located at eh Prestwould Foundation archives in Clarksville, Virginia and the Library of Virginia; 1864 Gilmer Civil War map of Meckenburg County Prestwould's legacy began in 1708 with the completion of the Prestwould manor and the expansion of Sir Peyton Skipwith's land holdings that demonstrated his power and wealth in Mecklenburg County. Upon Sir Peyton Skipwith's death, the Prestwould estate was transferred to his oldest son, Humberston Skipwith (1791-1863). After the death of Humbertson, Fulwar Skipwith (1836-1900), inherited much of the Prestwould holdings, including Prestwould plantation in 1863. During Reconstruction, however, Fulwar Skipwith sold most of the land associated with the original estate due to financial ruin. It was during this time of liquidation of Fulwar Skipwith's property that many African-American families in Mecklenburg County became landowners as tracts and small parcels of plantation farmland were sold to both male and female, black and white individuals with the financial means to purchase property. According to the 1870 U.S. Census, Vicey Skipwith along with six members of her family were tenants at the property site.In the U.S. Census of 1870 Vicey Skipwith's name is recorded as \\"Lovice.\\" Thereafter, any records pertaining to her are recorded with the name \\"Vicey.\\" Informants of oral histories also recall the name Vicey and make no mention of Lovice. The log cabin has sheltered many African-American families since that early beginning of African-American property ownership.

In 328, Constantine the Great constructed a bridge across the Danube and built fortifications in the territory of Oltenia and Wallachia. This caused a migration of the Thervingi and Taifali to the west into Tisza Sarmatian controlled areas. The Sarmatians joined forces with Constantine, who appointed his son Constantine II to campaign against the Goths in late winter 332, reportedly resulting in the deaths of approximately one hundred thousand people due to the weather and lack of food. Ariaric was forced to sign a treaty or foedus with Constantine in 332. Yet some scholars dispute that this treaty was a foedus, but more like an act of submission.From Roman Provinces to Medieval Kingdoms. Thomas F. X.

The memorial was designed by the Israeli artist Dani Karavan Official website of Dani KaravanThe German foundation \\"Foundation Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe\\" and consists of a dark, circular pool of water at the centre of which there is a triangular stone. The triangular shape of the stone is in reference to the badges that had to be worn by concentration camp prisoners. The stone is retractable and a fresh flower is placed upon it daily. In bronze letters around the edge of the pool is the poem 'Auschwitz' by Roma poet Santino Spinelli, although the monument commemorates all Roma and Sinti murdered during the Porajmos: > Gaunt face dead eyes cold lips quiet a broken heart out of breath without > words no tears Information boards surround the memorial and provide a chronology of the genocide of the Sinti and Roma.  History  The establishment of a permanent memorial to Sinti and Roma victims of the Nazi regime was a long-standing demand of the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma and the German Sinti Alliance. In 1992 the Federal Government agreed to build a monument but the memorial faced years of delay and disputes over its design and location. The city of Berlin initially wanted to place it in the less prominent district of Marzahn, where hundreds of Roma and Sinti were held in terrible conditions from 1936. In 2001 it was agreed to site it in the Tiergarten close to other Holocaust memorials but work did not officially commence until 19 December 2008, the commemoration day for victims of the Porajmos. The memorial was completed at a cost of 2.8 million euros and unveiled by Angela Merkel on 24 October 2012.

It was released through Early Access on Steam for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X on December 13, 2013, and for Linux on November 22, 2014. Versions for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were released in 2016 through Telltale Publishing, but are no longer being developed. Story The game's events happen during aftermath of a nuclear Third World War that destroyed an extremely large part of the world, except for some areas such as the fictional county of Navezgane, Arizona. The player is a survivor of the war who must survive by finding shelter, food and water, as well as scavenging supplies to fend off the numerous zombies (hinted to be the consequence of nuclear fallout) that populate Navezgane. Though there is no real objective except surviving at this moment, the developers promised a dynamic storyline in the Kickstarter and stretch goals. The video with more explanation has since been removed by the developer. Gameplay In 7 Days to Die, the player spawns into a randomly-generated world or the preset world of Navezgane, Arizona, with the objective of surviving for as long as possible against the elements and the zombie hordes. As a survival game, the player character is in constant need of water and food for sustenance, as well as being vulnerable to injury and illness. The game is voxel-based (similar in some aspects to Minecraft, but with smooth terrain), allowing for simple building, and destruction of objects in a physics-simulated environment (for example, building a structure with no support such as pillars and walls can lead to its collapse). Objects in the world degrade through use, so the player has to search for or make new tools as the game progresses. The player can also gather and create materials—from nature and the remnants of human civilization—to construct these necessary items. While the game includes wildlife that can be hunted for food or will hunt the player, the main hazard is zombies, which are affected by the game's day/night cycle—during the day they are relatively slow-moving and easy targets that can only detect the player at relatively close ranges, but at night they become feral, which makes them move much faster and thus greatly increases their threat. As the in-game days progress, tougher and more aggressive variants begin to appear. Stealth and distraction can be used to avoid unnecessary conflict, while carrying foods that have a smell (such as raw meat) will attract zombies. They are also drawn to areas of human (i.e. player) activity, and will relentlessly attack anything that impedes their movement until they are killed or the obstacle is destroyed—this includes player fortifications. Should they detect the player, zombies will apply the same single-minded pursuit until the player is either dead, or leaves the immediate area. The game's title is a reference to an important Blood Moon event that occurs every seventh day of in-game time, whereby hordes of zombies and wild infected animals attack the player's current location en masse—unless sufficient preparation has been made and defences constructed, the player will quickly be overwhelmed. The world of Navezgane is composed of multiple biomes, or geographic areas. These include dry deserts, temperate forests, snowy fields, as well as a scorched wasteland. Each biome has unique resources that can be obtained, thus encouraging exploration across the map by players. =Multiplayer= Multiplayer is available through player-hosted servers and enables multiple players to interact and communicate with each other on a single world. Interactions can be cooperative or hostile depending on the used server options. Players can run their own servers or use a hosting provider. Single player worlds have local area network support, allowing players to join worlds on locally interconnected computers without a server setup. Players are also able to provide Wide Area Network support via single player worlds. 7 Days to Die servers can run on consoles, Windows and Linux. There are two supported game modes for multiplayer: Survival (both randomly generated and standard) and Creative. The console version of the game supported split screen cooperative multiplayer. Development The Windows alpha version of the game was released on August 16, 2013, for people who pre-ordered the game on either Kickstarter or PayPal. As of August 11, 2013, development of the game is ongoing with a Kickstarter campaign ending on August 15. The estimated release date was May 2014 for Microsoft Windows; Macintosh and Linux versions were planned for later in the year. The game was also greenlit on Steam after 23 days getting over 75,000 yes votes, 8,340 followers, and 8,700 favorites. It was number one on Steam Greenlight, after only 16 days with over 56,000 votes. The Mac version was released on September 13, 2013 at the same time as update Alpha 1.1. The developers have a standing forum rule called Doom and Gloom that is related to ongoing development concerns in the community. = PC = 7 Days To Die was released to the public on Alpha 1.0. Only users who had backed the game via the Kickstarter Campaign or who bought it via PayPal had access to the Alpha until Alpha 5.0 which was released on Steam as an Early Access game on December 13, 2013. Since the Alpha release of 7 Days To Die, there were multiple game changing updates that contained features such as a new snow biome, forging systems, new weapons, general graphical changes and smoother terrains which would be completed by Alpha 8. Alpha 7.8 was released on April 4, 2014 and was promptly followed by Alpha 7.9 on April 8, 2014. Alpha 7.10 was later added on April 19, 2014. Alpha 8 was released on May 7, 2014 which updated the visuals to zombie animations and smoothed the terrain for a final time. Alpha Version 9 was released on August 19, 2014 and added random generated worlds, new injuries, new light effects, and new graphics. Alpha Version 10 was released on November 22, 2014 and added a new character creation system with face/body morphing and visible clothing, a new zombie horde world heat map system and a new wellness system. Alpha Version 11 was released on April 2, 2015, where the developers updated to Unity 5, which includes many graphical improvements, a new quality range system for guns, weapons, tools and armor and a new Zombie called \\"Feral\\". Alpha 12 was released on July 3, 2015, and added a new vehicle system with a Mini Bike, first weather system, new sound and physic systems, among other fixes and additions. Alpha 13 was released on December 10, 2015, adding temperature survival elements, a skill system, and a redesigned crafting system. The difficulty of the game has increased, but it continues to be popular. Alpha 14 was released on March 26, 2016, with further improvements and more features, a lot of bug fixes, as well as some performance and graphic optimizations. Alpha 15 was then released on October 5, 2016 with major improvements to random generated maps, a trader system, a new difficulty scaling and several more features. The UMA-Zombies that were introduced in this Alpha would be removed in Alpha 16. On June 6, 2017, Alpha 16 was released. This release added electricity to the game for the first time and introduced various traps including electric fences and spinning blades. On November 19, 2018, Alpha 17 was formally released which added a quest system as well as new vehicles and numerous system overhauls. On October 2, 2019, Alpha 18 was released, which optimized and balanced the changes from Alpha 17, and also added new things to the game (Improved Random World Gen, new infection system, weapons and schematics, locations and POIs, zombie enrage mode etc.). On June 27, 2020, Alpha 19 was released, which added a new loot system, new weapons and tools, candy, new critical hit system, new POI's, new texture overhauls for the zombies, and much more. = Console = In April 2016, the game was announced for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It was published by Telltale Publishing and released in June and July 2016. The most recent update for the console versions, Patch 13, was released on December 13, 2017. This patch updates the PlayStation 4 version of the game to version 1.18, and the Xbox One version of the game to version 1.0.18.0.  Telltale's Closure  On September 21, 2018, Telltale Games abruptly laid off most of its staff due to financial problems, and on October 11, 2018, began liquidating its assets through Sherwood Partners. A statement by The Fun Pimps on November 13, 2018, via their official online forum stated “upon hearing the news, The Fun Pimps immediately terminated its license agreement with Telltale, which only allowed publishing rights on the console ports of the 7 Days to Die game.” They went on to say that this “also severed Telltale's rights to any future updates or sequels of the 7 Days to Die franchise.” The Fun Pimps released a statement on 16 October 2019, stating that the developer had re-acquired the publishing rights to the game. The future of the console ports, which has not been updated since 2017, is not entirely clear. There is no active development happening.  Reception  The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of 7 Days to Die received \\"unfavorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. As of June 2018, the game scored a \\"very positive\\" review by over 46,000 reviews on Steam and was one of the \\"Top 100 Selling games of 2017\\" on Steam, despite still being in alpha stage development. One reviewer, however, criticised the length of time that the game had spent in an alpha state.

As early as 1817, an ordinary and tavern operated at Buffalo Springs. A resort/spa continued to grow through the mid-19th century. By 1885, Buffalo Springs water was being bottled and distributed nationally and in Europe. Buffalo Springs served as important place for local gathering and socializing through the first several decades of the 20th century. Some of the original property was acquired by the government for construction of the Kerr Reservoir in the late 1940s. The district is included within the Tobacco Heritage Trail.

It emphasizes symbolic computation, functional programming, and rule-based programming and can employ arbitrary structures and data. It is the programming language of the mathematical symbolic computation program Mathematica. History The Wolfram Language was a part of the initial version of Mathematica in 1988.Wolfram (1988). Mathematica, a System for Doing Mathematics By Computer. Judging by MockMMA's 1991 examples, the M-expression syntax has been there ever since, as are the symbolic, functional, and pattern-matching-by-rewriting facilities. Overall, these make Wolfram a Turing complete language, with support for meta-algorithms and superfunctions. Symbolic aspects of the engine make it a computer algebra system. The language can perform integration, differentiation, matrix manipulations, and solve differential equations using a set of rules. Also there in 1988 was the notebook model and the ability to embed sound and images, according to Theodore Gray's patent. An online frontend for the language, WolframAlpha, was released in 2009. Wolfram implemented this website by translating natural language statements into Wolfram-language queries that link to its database. This frontend greatly enlarged the audience of the language, and the work leading to Wolfram Alpha also means that Wolfram's implementation of the language now has built-in access to a knowledge-base as well as natural language processing functions. Wolfram also added features for more complex tasks, such as 3D modeling. A name was finally adopted for the language in 2013, as Wolfram Research decided to make a version of the language engine free for Raspberry Pi users, and they needed to come up with a name for it. It was included in the recommended software bundle that the Raspberry Pi Foundation provides for beginners, which caused some controversy due to the Wolfram language's proprietary nature. Plans to port the Wolfram language to the Intel Edison were announced after the board's introduction at CES 2014. In 2019, a link was added to make Wolfram libraries compatible with the Unity game engine, giving game developers access to the language's high level functions.  Syntax  The Wolfram Language syntax is overall similar to the M-expression of 1960s LISP, with support for infix operators and \\"function-notation\\" function calls. = Basics = The Wolfram language writes basic arithmetic expressions using infix operators. (* This is a comment. *) 4 + 3 (* = 7 *) 1 + 2 * (3 + 4) (* = 15 *) (* Note that Multiplication can be omitted: 1 + 2 (3 + 4) *) (* Divisions return rational numbers: *) 3 / 2 (* = 3/2 *) Function calls are denoted with square brackets: Sin[Pi] (* = 0 *) (* This is the function to convert rationals to floating points: *) N[3 / 2] (* = 1.5 *) Lists are enclosed in curly brackets: = Syntax sugar = The language may deviate from the M-expression paradigm when an alternative, more human-friendly way of showing an expression is available: * A number of formatting rules are used in this language, including for typeset expressions and for language input. * Functions can also be applied using the prefix expression and the postfix expression . * Derivatives can be denoted with an apostrophe . * The infix operators themselves are considered \\"sugar\\" for the function notation system. A formatter desugars the input: FullForm[1+2] (* = Plus[1, 2] *) = Functional programming = Currying is supported. = Pattern matching = Functions in the Wolfram Language are basically a case of simple patterns for replacement: F[x_] := x ^ 0 The is a \\"SetDelayed operator\\", so that the x is not immediately looked for. is syntax sugar for , i.e. a \\"blank\\" for any value to replace x in the rest of the evaluation. An iteration of bubble sort is expressed as: sortRule := {x___,y_,z_,k___} /; y>z -> {x,z,y,k} (* Rule[Condition[List[PatternSequence[x, BlankNullSequence[ , Pattern[y, Blank[ , Pattern[z, Blank[ , PatternSequence[k, BlankNullSequence[ ], Greater[y, z , List[x, z, y, k *) The operator is \\"condition\\", so that the rule only applies when . The three underscores are a syntax for a , for a sequence that can be null. A ReplaceRepeated operator can be used to apply this rule repeatedly, until no more change happens: { 9, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4 } //. sortRule (* = ReplaceRepeated[{ 9, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4 }, sortRule] *) (* = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9} *) The pattern matching system also easily gives rise to rule-based integration and derivation. The following are excerpts from the Rubi package of rules: (* Reciprocal rule *) Int[1/x_,x_Symbol] := Log[x]; (* Power rule *) Int[x_^m_.,x_Symbol] := x^(m+1)/(m+1) /; FreeQ[m,x] && NeQ[m,-1]  Implementations  The official, and reference, implementation of the Wolfram Language lies in Mathematica and associated online services. These are closed source. Wolfram Research has, however, released a C++ parser of the language under the open source MIT License. A number of libraries and functions written in this language are open source, and the reference book itself is open access. In the three-decade-long existence of the Wolfram language, a number of open source third party implementations have also been developed. Richard Fateman's MockMMA from 1991 is of historical note. Modern ones still being maintained include Symja in Java, expreduce in Golang and the SymPy-based Mathics. These implementations focus on the core language and the computer algebra system that it implies, not on the online \\"knowledgebase\\" features of Wolfram. Naming The language was officially named in June 2013 although, as the backend of the computing system Mathematica, it has been in use in various forms for over 30 years since Mathematica's initial release. Before 2013, it was internally referred to by several names, such as \\"M\\" and \\"Wolfram Language.\\" Other possible names Wolfram Research considered include \\"Lingua\\" and \\"Express.\\" See also * Stephen Wolfram * Wolfram Mathematica * Notebook interface * Wolfram Research * Wolfram Alpha * Wolfram Demonstrations Project References External links *Documentation for the Wolfram Language *An Elementary Introduction to the Wolfram Language *The Wolfram Programming Cloud *WolframLanguage.org: a guide to community resources about Wolfram Language *Something Very Big Is Coming: Our Most Important Technology Project Yet: first announcement of the Wolfram Language in Stephen Wolfram's blog Category:Array programming languages Category:Audio programming languages Category:Cloud platforms Category:Computational notebook Category:Computer algebra systems Category:Computer vision software Category:Concatenative programming languages Category:Constructed languages Category:Cross-platform software Category:Data mining and machine learning software Category:Data visualization software Category:Data-centric programming languages Category:Declarative programming languages Category:Dynamically typed programming languages Category:Educational programming languages Category:Finite element software Category:Formula editors Category:Formula manipulation languages Category:Functional languages Category:Functional programming Category:High-level programming languages Category:Homoiconic programming languages Category:Image processing software Category:Linear algebra Category:Literate programming Category:Multi-paradigm programming languages Category:Neural network software Category:Numerical linear algebra Category:Numerical programming languages Category:Object-oriented programming languages Category:Ontology languages Category:Parallel computing Category:Pattern matching programming languages Category:Programming languages created in 1988 Category:Simulation programming languages Category:Social network analysis software Category:Software modeling language Category:SQL data access Category:Statistical programming languages Category:Technical analysis software Category:Term-rewriting programming languages Category:Theorem proving software systems Category:Wolfram Research ","title":"Wolfram Language"},{"id":"40205962","text":"Suleyman Atayev (born 1996) is a Turkmenistani swimmer.http://www.bcn2013.com/en/swimming/detail/member/suleyman-atayev He competed in the 50 m freestyle and 200 m freestyle events at the 2013 World Aquatics Championships.

Ruby is the sister of author and ex-FLDS member Flora Jessop. In Flora's book, Church of Lies, she recounts how, as a fourteen-year-old, Ruby called her asking to help her escape after learning that she was to be married off to her second cousin and step-brother, Haven Barlow. Flora writes that while the authorities were contacted, they were unable to locate Ruby as she was being moved from place to place to avoid contact with Flora. FLDS Prophet Warren Jeffs officiated at the wedding of 14-year-old Ruby and Barlow, who was then in his mid-20s. When the two were married, this made Barlow her brother- in-law, second cousin, step-brother and husband. The intermarrying of Fundamentalist Mormon members is very common, as families have many members and only people inside the faith are deemed marriageable. This can result in inbreeding and can cause genetic defects. After Ruby's escape, a press conference was held by Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne with Ruby and her sister Flora to announce not only the escape, but a probe into the alleged FLDS practice of holding women against their will and an investigation of the police force in Colorado City. Ruby has appeared on Katie Couric, Oprah, Anderson Cooper: 360°, and appears in Jon Krakauer's non-fiction book Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith. Ruby is cousin-by-marriage of Carolyn Jessop, author of the New York Times Best Seller Escape and ex-FLDS member.

The Spitzer resistivity of a plasma decreases in proportion to the electron temperature as T_e^. The inverse of the Spitzer resistivity \\\\eta_{Sp} is known as the Spitzer conductivity \\\\sigma_{Sp}=1/\\\\eta_{Sp}.  Formulation  The Spitzer restitivity is classical model of electrical resistivity based upon electron-ion collisions and it is commonly used in plasma physics.N.A. Krall and A.W. Trivelpiece, Principles of Plasma Physics, San Francisco Press, Inc., 1986 The transverse Spitzer resistivity is given by: :\\\\eta_\\\\perp = \\\\frac{4\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}{3}\\\\frac{Ze^{2}m_e^{1/2}\\\\ln \\\\Lambda}{\\\\left(4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0\\\\right)^2 \\\\left(k_\\\\text{B}T_e\\\\right)^{3/2}} , and the parallel Spitzer resistivity by: :\\\\eta_\\\\parallel = \\\\eta_\\\\perp/1.96 \\\\qquad (\\\\text{for } Z=1), where Z is the ionization of nuclei, e is the electron charge, m_e is the electron mass, \\\\ln\\\\Lambda is the Coulomb logarithm, \\\\varepsilon_0 is the electric permittivity of free space, k_\\\\text{B} is Boltzmann's constant, and T_e is the electron temperature in kelvins. The two resistivities correspond to current perpendicular and parallel to a strong magnetic field (the collision rate is small compared to the gyrofrequency). In an unmagnetized case the resistivity is \\\\eta_\\\\parallel. In CGS units, the expression is given by: :\\\\eta_\\\\perp = \\\\frac{4\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}{3}\\\\frac{Ze^{2}m_e^{1/2}\\\\ln \\\\Lambda}{\\\\left(k_\\\\text{B}T_e\\\\right)^{3/2}}.

Disagreements with observation  Measurements in laboratory experiments and computer simulations have shown that under certain conditions, the resistivity of a plasma tends to be much higher than the Spitzer resistivity. This effect is sometimes known as anomalous resistivity or neoclassical resistivity. It has been observed in space and effects of anomalous resistivity have been postulated to be associated with particle acceleration during magnetic reconnection. There are various theories and models that attempt to describe anomalous resistivity and they are frequently compared to the Spitzer resistivity.

While living there, he found love for art at the Washington Color School and was influenced by Gene Davis and Kenneth Noland paintings. =Career= 19681976 In 1968 he designed the first three-dimensional laser sculpture which can be found in Long Beach, California. He did the same type of sculptures nationwide in 25 cities and later on he represented United States at Expo '70 in Osaka, Japan. In 1969, he and his fellow engineers worked at Hewlett-Packard in California where their job was to develop some environmental sculptures. On one such project he erected lasers at the Mount Wilson's observatory and its beam stretched for eight miles toward Caltech. The same year, he also created laser sculptures for the Gulf of Mexico and St. Petersburg, Florida. In 1974 he set up temporary laser installations aiming beams across the Potomac River onto the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC; and down the McKeldin Mall onto the Administration Building at the University of Maryland. In 1976 he created a laser installation for the National Endowment for the Arts at the Kennedy Space Center called Sun Dog and a year later created The One Night Stand, which was his first fireworks installations.  19781985  In 1978 he created a collage called Green Air at the Fort Worth Art Museum in Texas and in 1979 he did an installation called Still Green at the Disneyland Hotel. In 1980 he created another sculpture called The Source which was erected in Washington D.C. and the same year looked for approval from Secret Service before he can use argon and krypton lasers over the Lincoln Memorial. In 1985 he constructed two sculptures in Maryland one called Crystal Willow which can be found in Bethesda the other one is called The Vine Covered Passarelle which is located in Reisterstown Plaza Metro Station of Baltimore.  19871996  In 1987 he erected a Neo-Green laser installation at the Memorial Art Gallery and the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York. The same year he commissioned The Miami Line bridge over the Miami River. In 1989 he installed St. Patrick's Solar Piece at the St. Patrick's Episcopal Church in Washington D.C. and four years later built The Red River Bridge over Bossier City, Louisiana. In 1994 he created Pegasus Cloud Projection in Sacramento, California and two years later decorated CNN Center in Atlanta, Georgia with the Good Luck World laser projection for the 1996 Summer Olympics. After the Olympics the piece was moved to the Indianapolis Museum of Art where it still remain to this day. 21st century From 2003 till his death he was a member of the Sons of the American Revolution.

The famous landscaper Edward Kemp was employed to design the gardens. Kemp wrote about this task in his book “How to Lay Out a Garden”. The house was described by one newspaper in the following terms: :\\"The mansion which Charles Longman erected at Shandish with its gardens, grounds and various appliances may well be cited as an instance of what can be done by taste skill and perseverance and as a model abode for an English Country Gentleman.\\"Hertford Mercury and Reformer - 11 January 1873, p. 2.

In 1962, he joined the faculty of Brown University as a professor of Linguistics and English. In 1964, he began working on a joint language project of Brown University and Tougaloo College, which lasted through 1968. The project applied linguistic principles in a syllabus of Standard American English for African-American freshmen at Tougaloo College. After the project was completed, he became the chair of the linguistics department, serving in that capacity through 1976. While he officially retired at that time with the title of Emeritus Professor, he continued to teach historical and comparative linguistics and advise students. In 1987, he was appointed chair of Brown's newly established Department of Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences. He taught his last course at Brown in 1990. = Writing = ;Brown Corpus After joining the faculty of Brown, Francis took a course in computational linguistics from Henry Kučera, who taught as a member of the Slavic Department staff. In the early 1960s, they began collaborating on compiling a one-million-word computerized cross- section of American English, which was entitled the Brown Standard Corpus of Present-Day American English, but commonly known as the Brown Corpus. The work was compiled between 1963 and 1964, using books, magazines, newspapers, and other edited sources of informative and imaginative prose published in 1961. Once completed, the Brown Corpus was published in 1964. Each word in the corpus is tagged with its part of speech and the subject matter category of its source. Disseminated throughout the world, the Brown Corpus has served as a model for similar projects in other languages and as the basis for numerous scholarly studies, including Francis and Kučera's Frequency Analysis of English Usage, which was published in 1967. ;Magazine and journal contributions Francis wrote articles that were published in American Speech, College Composition and Communication, College English, Computers and the Humanities, Contemporary Psychology, East Anglian Magazine, English Journal, The Explicator, Language, Language in Society, Lingua, Modern Language Notes, PMLA, The Quarterly Journal of Speech, Speculum, Style, and Word. = Business = In 1977, Francis cofounded the International Computer Archive of Modern and Medieval English (ICAME) at the University of Oslo. The organization became the distributor of the Brown Corpus. Corporate publications entitled ICAME News and ICAME Journal have been dedicated to him twice. In 1986, the newsletter recognized his work on an individual basis, while ten years later, the journal published \\"A Tribute to W. Nelson Francis and Henry Kučera\\". = Speaking = Francis served as a keynote speaker, lecturer, and visiting professor in London; Edinburgh; Cairo; Tokyo; and Trondheim, Norway. He also participated in a Nobel Symposium on computer corpus linguistics in Stockholm.

He united and formed a regiment of over 600 men, among them runaway slaves and imperial freedmen, and eluded capture for more than two years despite pursuit by a force of Roman soldiers under the command of the emperor himself.Brent D. Shaw, \\"Bandits in the Roman Empire,\\" in Studies in Ancient Greek and Roman Society (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 366. The story of Bulla Felix is told by the Greek historian and Roman senator Cassius Dio. However, it is written in a manner that serves to undermine the integrity of Septimius Severus because it casts the emperor in a poor light. In particular it is framed to compare the fair treatment the Emperor Augustus showed the Spanish brigand Corocotta in the 1st century BC in contrast to Severus' punishment of Bulla. Dio's story has several similarities to later legends of \\"good\\" bandits: Bulla \\"combined the attributes of Zorro and the Scarlet Pimpernel (he could never be caught) with a Robin Hood-like concern for social justice and flourished with the support of his community.\\" Bulla is reported to have come from Liguria and was raised by a priest. It was through this priest that he learned how to read and write. Bulla was also drawn to law, theology and philosophy, which he taught himself, as he grew up. Bulla had access to the priest's texts and was able through the priest to access legal texts and scriptures. Somewhat of an oxymoronic endeavour, Bulla actively satirised the Roman judicial system.Frank McLynn, Marcus Aurelius: A Life (Da Capo Press, 2009), p. 482. Dio describes him as \\"never really seen when seen, never found when found, never caught when caught.\\"Cassius Dio 77.10.2. The Latin name Bulla Felix means roughly \\"Lucky Charm\\", and he is likely to be a composite or historical fiction.Grünewald, Bandits in the Roman Empire: Myth and Reality, p. 111 (emphatically regarding Bulla Felix as a fiction); Christopher J. Fuhrmann, Policing the Roman Empire: Soldiers, Administration, and Public Order (Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 135; Shaw, \\"Bandits in the Roman Empire,\\" p. 366. Modus operandi According to Dio, Bulla Felix operated an extensive intelligence network tracking travel and transport into the port at Brundisium and out of Rome. Bulla was a sophisticated and surprisingly educated leader, which helped him organise, plan and gather information on the size of parties making trips from and into Rome and what they were carrying.Cassius Dio 77.10.2; Shaw, \\"Bandits in the Roman Empire,\\" p. 366. His band of 600 brigands included runaway slaves who had been mistreated, and a significant number of imperial freedmen, former slaves of the emperor's household who would have been skilled or educated, and who had been cheated of their compensation.Cassius Dio 77.10.5; Grünewald, Bandits in the Roman Empire, pp. 116–117. These imperial freedmen may have been ousted from privileged positions as a result of the civil wars following the death of Commodus, from which Septimius Severus had emerged to reign as emperor (193–211).Grünewald, Bandits in the Roman Empire, p. 117. Elsewhere, Dio indicates that a band of brigands with this kind of organizational capacity might also include men cashiered from the Praetorian Guard, the followers of usurpers, and those who had lost their property through confiscation during the civil wars. In Dio's view, the Severan reform of the Praetorian Guard that made it no longer a privilege of Italian youth left them at loose ends to become brigands and gladiators.Grünewald, Bandits in the Roman Empire, p. 117. Though engaging in highway robbery, Bulla Felix had an early pre-socialism ideology, as he did not resort to killing, and instead took only part of his targets' wealth before he released them. He then redistributed the wealth amongst the most in need. When the party included artisans ('), he detained them for a time in order to make use of their services. After benefiting from their skills, he gave them a generous gift and let them go.Cassius Dio 77.10.3; Grünewald, Bandits in the Roman Empire, p. 113–114. Disguises and deceptions In Dio's anecdotes, Bulla Felix is a master of deception, though he was also known to bribe his way out of a situation.Cassius Dio 77.10.2. When two of his men have been condemned to the beasts in the arena, Bulla dresses as a provincial governor and visits the prison warden. He says he needs some men, presumably for the hard labor often performed by condemned men,Shaw, \\"Bandits in the Roman Empire,\\" p. 366. and tailors his requirements in such a way that the warden chooses Bulla's own bandits to release to him.Cassius Dio 77.10.3. In another incident, he approached a centurion in command of the Roman force sent to capture him, pretended to be someone else, and offered to reveal the location of the bandits' hideout. The centurion went with him, and walked into an ambush. Bulla convened a mock tribunal, dressed himself as a presiding magistrate, and ordered that the centurion's head be partially shaved in the manner of slaves. He then released him, on the condition that he deliver a message to his \\"masters\\": \\"Feed your slaves, that they might not turn to brigandage\\".Cassius Dio 77.10.4–5. The incident may be fictional, but contemporary concern for the feeding and clothing of slaves is expressed by the jurist Ulpian, who served as assessor to the praetorian prefect who eventually brought Bulla Felix to trial.Grünewald, Bandits in the Roman Empire, p. 116. Challenging authority Bust of Septimius Severus, with modern restorations (Glyptothek, Munich) Dio presents the activities of Bulla Felix as a personal affront to the emperor with a tactical ability as an orator.Shaw, \\"Bandits in the Roman Empire,\\" p. 366. Septimius Severus expresses indignation that while he was winning wars in Britain, one outlaw in Italy had eluded him.Cassius Dio 77.10.6. Bulla is portrayed as opposing unjust authority and social inequality, and administering his own brand of justice. He was regarded as a natural leader, with a strong ability to orate and rally people. Known for being able to instill a sense of heroism into his men to achieve their missions despite being overpowered.Shaw, \\"Bandits in the Roman Empire,\\" p. 366. His band is constituted as an alternative state to Rome, like that of the Lusitanian rebel Viriatus and other \\"bandit states\\" idealized in Roman literature: \\"tightly run, based on the unconditional loyalty of their subjects to their leaders and characterised by absolute discipline\\".Grünewald, Bandits in the Roman Empire, p. 63. Saint Augustine would later argue that a bandit state (latrocinium), as exemplified by the community organized under Spartacus in the Third Servile War, could not be distinguished structurally from a legitimate regnum (\\"rule, kingdom\\"), and a rule could be deemed just if its benefits were shared communally.Augustine of Hippo, City of God 3.26, 4.4–5, 19.2; Oliver O'Donovan and Joan Lockwood O'Donovan, Bonds of Imperfection: Christian Politics, Past and Present (William B. Eerdmans, 2004), pp. 61–62. Bulla Felix presides over a community of 600 men—the same as the number of seats in the Imperial Senate—and like an emperor, he is a patron of the arts, since the term ' for the artisans he employed includes practitioners of the performing and fine arts as well as master craftsmen.Grünewald, Bandits in the Roman Empire, pp. 112–114. The possible meanings of the name Bulla Felix contribute to the fictional or symbolic qualities of the bandit leader. Felix was a cognomen adopted by Roman generals and heads of state from at least the time of the dictator Sulla, and had been used most recently by Severus's predecessor, Commodus. Felix advertised a leader as endowed with felicitas, good fortune that brings success not only for himself, but for those around him.Grünewald, Bandits in the Roman Empire, p. 111; Mireille Corbier, L'aerarium saturni et l'aerarium militare. Administration et prosopographie sénatoriale (Publications de l'École française de Rome, 1974), p. 425. On felicitas as a quality, see also H.S. Versnel, Triumphus: An Inquiry into the Origin, Development and Meaning of the Roman Triumph (Brill, 1970), pp. 343, 348, 361ff.; and J. Rufus Fears, \\"The Theology of Victory at Rome: Approaches and Problem,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt II.17.2 (1981), p. 746. \\"Bulla\\" recalls the bulbous amulet (bulla) worn by children and triumphing generals as a protective charm but is also a surname from liguria, Italy.Grünewald, Bandits in the Roman Empire, p. 111–112. Dio, a Roman senator, may have intended the name to be a further allusion to an intimidating speech recently made by Severus to the senate. Just after he had defeated the usurper Clodius Albinus, who had supporters of senatorial rank, Severus announced that he was disinclined toward the clemency of Pompeius Magnus or Julius Caesar, and would instead favor a policy of severity, like Augustus, Gaius Marius, and Sulla. The similarity of Sulla Felix to Bulla Felix—whether the name was adopted by an actual man, or was Dio's choice for a fictional composite—helps cast the bandit as a satiric mirror image of the emperor.Grünewald, Bandits in the Roman Empire, p. 111–112. Bulla Felix is a model ruler and tactful advocate, uniting people to the cause and only taking a fair portion from the rich to distribute to the community, and distributing funds to creative members of society. He is cast as an avenger of those who suffered from the civil wars and heavy taxation. Dio encapsulates his perception of Severus by contrast with a deathbed anecdote in which the emperor is supposed to have told his sons to \\"enrich the soldiers, and scorn all other men\\".Cassius Dio 76.15.2; Grünewald, Bandits in the Roman Empire, pp. 114, 138. Capture After two years, Bulla Felix was finally captured through a dishonorable betrayal rather than direct confrontation. A military tribune was given command of a substantial force of cavalry and ordered by the outraged emperor to bring Bulla Felix back alive or to face punishment in extremis himself. With the help of informants, the tribune was able to catch Bulla while he was sleeping in a sea cave he used as a hideout in Liguria.Cassius Dio 77.10.1, 6–7; Grünewald, Bandits in the Roman Empire, p. 118. Bulla was brought before the praetorian prefect Papinianus, who demanded to know why he was a bandit. \\"Well, why are you a prefect?\\" Bulla responded, implying that Papinianus himself was no more than a bandit.Thomas N. Habinek, The Politics of Latin Literature: Writing, Identity, and Empire in Ancient Rome (Princeton University Press, 1998), p. 69; Jill Harries, Law and Crime in the Roman World (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 10. The encounter is a variation on a narrative theme found in other interrogations of a social renegade by an authority figure. Alexander the Great is supposed to have asked a captured pirate what drove him to harass the sea; the man replied, \\"The same thing that prompts you to harass the world. I do it with a little boat and am called a bandit; you do it with a big fleet, and are called emperor.\\"Augustine, City of God 4.4, elaborating on a passage from Cicero, as cited by Habinek, The Politics of Latin Literature, p. 69. A similar story was told of the runaway slave Clemens, who was impersonating Agrippa Postumus and leading a band of rebels when he was captured and brought before Tiberius: the emperor asked how he had made himself into Agrippa, and the impostor is reported to have said, \\"The same way you become Caesar\\".Tacitus, Annales 2.40; Cassius Dio, 57.16.4; Habinek, The Politics of Latin Literature, p. 69. A public announcement was made that Bulla Felix had been condemned to death in the arena by wild beasts (damnatio ad bestias). Without their charismaticFuhrmann, Policing the Roman Empire, p. 135. leader, his robber band simply broke up.Cassius Dio 77.10.7. Banditry in the later Roman Empire Roman Imperial historians use the Latin word ' (plural ') or Greek ' (plural ') for more than 80 individuals, in a range of roles wider than English \\"bandit\\" or \\"robber\\" would indicate, including \\"rebel, rival, avenger\\".Grünewald, \\"Bandits in the Roman Empire2, pp. 1–3. The Imperial bureaucracy kept records on crime, and while none of these local archives has survived except for one from Egypt,Grünewald, Bandits in the Roman Empire, p. 8. brigandage had occurred throughout Roman history, and became acute among the social disturbances that characterized the Crisis of the Third Century.Oliver Hekster, Rome and Its Empire, AD 193–284 (Edinburgh University Press, 2008), pp. 17–18. The noble-sounding fiction that Bulla Felix preyed only on the rich, and not those of humble means, reflects the practical reality that there is no reason to rob from those who have little of value.Grünewald, Bandits in the Roman Empire, p. 113. Bandits appear frequently in the fiction of late antiquity, such as Greek romance novels and the Metamorphoses of Apuleius. Latrones in literature are of two character types: common and despicable, or noble and just.Grünewald, \\"Bandits in the Roman Empire\\", pp. 3, 7. The noble bandit, like Bulla Felix, typically can be captured only through treachery; ultimately, however, principled resistance is undone by corrupt authority.Grünewald, \\"Bandits in the Roman Empire\\", p. 108. Dio writes about several glamorous or idealistic bandits, such as Corocotta, active in Roman Spain under Augustus, and a Claudius in Judaea a few years before Bulla Felix.Grünewald, Bandits in the Roman Empire, p. 112. In Roman Palestine, Jewish bandits became symbols of peasant resistance.Richard A. Horsley, \\"Jesus and the Spiral of Violence: Popular Jewish Resistance in Roman Palestine\\" (Fortress Press, 1993), p. 37 (with comparison to Bulla Felix). The depiction of noble bandits by historians such as Dio was clearly influenced by fiction,Grünewald, Bandits in the Roman Empire, pp. 8–9. and the story of Bulla Felix seems designed to sway elite attitudes toward the grievances of the lower classes, as well as to express Dio's social criticisms on the theme of just and moral authority.Grünewald, Bandits in the Roman Empire, pp. 9, 117, 136.

Sturla (Stûrlâ in Ligurian) is a quartiere of Genoa. It began life as an ancient fishing village which developed around a number of small coves - Sturla a Mare, at the mouth of the Sturla river, Vernazzola and Boccadasse (Boccadasse is now included in the neighbouring quartiere of Albaro). Sturla is located in Golfo di Sturla (Sturla Bay). Sturla is part of the Medio Levante municipality, and has a population of 8278 inhabitants (as of December 31, 2010).Notiziario statistico della città di Genova 1/2011 In the 1800s the current quartiere was a commune of San Martino d'Albaro, while the village of Vernazzola was a commune of San Francesco d'Albaro. However, both communes were annexed by Genoa in 1874.  Description of the quartiere  The Medio Levante municipality The area of Sturla is marked out by Corso Europa, Via Orsini, the right bank of the Sturla river (from which it takes its name) and the sea. During the 20th century the neighborhood went through a period of extensive construction, but the centers of the original ancient villages are still recognizable. The neighbouring quarters are Albaro to the west, Borgoratti and San Martino to the north and Quarto dei Mille to the east. The neighbourhood is home to the Villa Gentile athletics arena, as well as several public and private bathing facilities. A water purification plant has been built between Sturla beach and Vernazzola beach. There are several schools in the district. There's a nursery school (Nini Corsanego) as well as a kindergarten (Bartolomeo Chighizola), both on the road leading from Piazza Sturla to Vernazzola beach. There's also a primary school dedicated to Ettore Vernazza, a middle school (Bernardo Strozzi) and the Martin Luther King high school that focuses on the sciences and was built in the 1960s. The Genoese poet, Vico Faggi dedicated the following verse to Sturla:  The maritime villages of Sturla  In the area of Sturla, starting from the early Middle Ages, several maritime settlements arose due to the presence of useful landing places. = Sturla a Mare = To the East of Vernazzola, separated by the small hill between the Vernazza river and the Sturla river, is the historic core of Sturla, a tiny fishing village, as evidenced by some of the place names, which winds around Via del Tritone, Via Tabarca, Via Zoagli, Vico del Pesce and Via del Bragone. Today the village, partly reduced in size by the opening immediately upstream of an enlarged road (Via Dei Mille), consists of a few houses clustered around the ancient Oratorio di San Celso, the existence of which has been documented since 1311 although it was rebuilt in the Baroque period and then completely rebuilt in 2002. = Vernazzola = Genova Sturla Vernazzola Vernazzola is a picturesque fishing village at the mouth of the Vernazza river located a short distance to the east of Boccadasse. The bay in which the village is located is hemmed in by two rocky outcrops named Grosso and Bernardina. The view extends to the east to the Portofino peninsular. As well as being a fishing village, in the past Vernazzola was an important landing ground from where it was possible to climb the Sturla valley, on through the quartiere of Bavari and into the upper Bisagno valley. Immediately behind the houses on the shoreline there once stood a Dominican convent with an adjoining hospital for travellers. In time, behind the coastal buildings there gradually arose grand villas of the aristocratic families of Genoa, and finally, in the early twentieth century, luxurious Art Nouveau villas. However, like Boccadasse, the village still preserves its ancient dwellings, the network of old streets and an atmosphere of a bygone era. Some of the streets around Vernazzola have characteristic names inspired by ancient classical mythology: Argonauti, Giasone, Icarus, Pelio, Urania. These names were chosen at the request of the last mayor of San Francesco d'Albaro, a passionate lover of the classical world, shortly before the annexation of the town to Genoa, in the second half of the 18th Century. Along the road that leads around Capo di Santa Chiara, a distinctive vantage point dominated by the medieval styled Turcke castle,http://www.touringclub.com/monumento/liguria/genova/castelletto- turcke.aspx there are some eighteenth-century villas, the Augustinian convent and the church of Santa Chiara, founded in the sixteenth century. = Boccadasse = Boccadasse is located immediately to the west of Capo di Santa Chiara. Although it’s part of the district of Albaro it can be considered the last of the small fishing villages of the area of Sturla.

The river is ten kilometers long and rarely dry. It starts in the districts of San Desidario and Bavari where it runs through a narrow valley between the slopes of Monte Fasce and Monte Ratti, then coming to the area of Borgoratti. On the way it collects the waters of tributaries such as the Pomà river, the Canè river, the Penego river and other smaller streams. Another stream in the area is the Vernazza river, now completely channeled into tunnels, which flows from the area of the ancient Roman road, Via Aurelia, which is also known as Vernazza, in the district of San Martino, through the small valley containing the Martin Luther King high school, passes under Piazza Sturla and finally flows into the sea in an outlet in Vernazzola.  Sturla beach  Considered by many to be the finest beach in Genoa, Sturla beach spreads out to either side of the mouth of the Sturla river. One of the first free beaches heading east from the city center it attracts vast numbers of people all through the summer months. Many people also come for the many bars and restaurants that open directly onto the beach.

The church was built at the behest of two priests, Pietro Micichero and Domenico Verrucca, who had founded a congregation of secular canons. From 1441 it was officiated by the Canonici di San Giorgio in Alga, popularly called \\"Celestini\\", who remained there until 1668 when the congregation was dissolved by Pope Clement IX. It then passed on to the Order of Saint Augustine, who had to leave in 1797 due to Napoleonic laws which suppressed religious orders.Wikisource:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Suppression of Monasteries in Continental Europe It was then entrusted to secular clergy, becoming a branch of San Martino d'Albaro. It underwent several renovations and expansions, and became a parish in its own right in 1894. In the 1940s the church underwent a major restoration, which involved almost a total renovation of the building.La chiesa della SS. Annunziata di Sturla sul sito dell'arcidiocesi di Genova This reconstruction virtually erased the various reconstructions of the Baroque era to bring the building, at least in its essential structure, back to its original fifteenth-century form, although the restoration was undertaken in an interpretive and not scientifically rigorous fashion.S.S. Annunziata di Sturla - La storia The church has three naves, each complete with its own semi-circular apse. The side naves are separated from the central by four columns on each side connected by semicircular arches. The facade was built freely reinterpreting the original style, with two monofora windows (narrow windows with an arched top and single opening), a central rose window and the original slate architrave above the entrance. It contains notable works of art from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, including a Madonna and Child and Saint Sebastian and Saint Roch (San Rocco). They’re of the Venetian school of the sixteenth century. There is also a Madonna and Child and Saint Anthony by Gregorio De Ferrari (1690) and a sixteenth-century fresco, again depicting Saint Sebastian and Saint Roch. = Oratorio di San Celso = The church of San Celso, the first religious building built in Sturla, located in Vico del Pesce, not far from the mouth of Sturla river, is now the oratory of the Disciplinati di Sturla, under the title of Saint Roch. It was built in the fourteenth century (the first records date back to 1311), restored in 1391 and completely rebuilt in 1594. In 2002 it was completely restored. Already an independent parish, in 1406 it became subordinate to San Martino d'Albaro, under the patronage of the Spinola family. It later became the oratory of the brotherhood named Santi Rocco e Nazario e Celso. There are remarkable preserved frescoes painted between the fourteenth and the seventeenth century, while other works of art, including the altarpiece depicting the Saints Roch, Nazarius and Celsus, Catherine of Siena and Saint Sebastian, by Bernardo Castello, were transferred to the parish church of the Santissima Annunziata. = Oratorio di S. Giovanni Battista e monastero delle Battistine = In Sturla you’ll also find the convent of Sisterhood of St. John the Baptist, a religious order of women founded in the mid-eighteenth century by Giovanna Maria Battista Solimani. The nuns moved here in 1924 from their original location in the centre of Genoa, in the street still called \\"Salita delle Battistine”. Next to the convent is a church dedicated to St. John the Baptist, consecrated on 18 June 1960, containing the tomb of the founder.  History  The historical events of Sturla are closely tied to those of Genoa. Until the start of the 20th century, the area, like the other two municipalities to which it belonged (San Francesco d'Albaro and San Martino d'Albaro), was made up of small settlements of farmers and fishermen, away from the main communication routes of the time. The oldest historical references regarding the area of Sturla refer to the frequent fights between Guelphs and Ghibellines that bloodied Genoa in the Middle Ages. There were also reports of clashes between the Grillo and Vento family in 1179. In 1284, Oberto Doria, Captain of the People and Admiral of the Republic of Genoa, during the war against Pisa, which culminated on August 6 in the same year as the battle of Meloria, deployed his ships in front of the Sturla beach, waiting for the events to unfold. On 26 November 1322 the Guelphs attacked the castle of Sturla, containing the garrison of the Ghibellines, which controlled the Bisagno valley. After two days the besiegers, who also possessed a trebuchet, pummeled the castle walls with stones, fatally weakening them, and the castle constructed by Antonio Doria was forced to surrender.G.Dellepiane, Guida per escursioni nelle Alpi e Appennini Liguri In 1363, during a banquet given by the nobleman Pietro Malocello in honor of Peter I, King of Cyprus, visiting Genoa, the Doge, Simone Boccanegra was mysteriously poisoned. Sturla was once famous for its zavorristi, the men who loaded and unloaded the ballast required by sailing ships to maintain the right balance out at sea.  Infrastructure and transport  = Roads = Via Isonzo Initially Via Aurelia, which was used from the Middle Ages until the Napoleonic era, avoided the sea, passing along Via Antica Romana di Quarto, over Ponte Vecchio di Sturla (a medieval bridge with two arches) and along the streets of Casette, Pontetti and Vernazza. With the road revolution in the nineteenth-century a main road opened up between Genoa, Albaro and Sturla. It was a continuation towards Genoa of the new coastal Via Aurelia, which in 1808 had reached Nervi from Levante. The new road, perpendicular to the ancient creuze (little streets that lead down toward the sea), put an end to the isolation of the city from Levante, reaching Piazza Sturla, heading towards San Martino and then on to Genoa. In the twentieth century more roads were built, starting from Piazza Sturla, that more directly linked Sturla to the centre of Genoa. Piazza Sturla was more recently enlarged with a viaduct that leads from Via Caprera over the valley of the Vernazza river. Small secluded ancient fishing settlements still remain amongst this sea of modern roads. From Piazza Sturla, Via Sturla and Via Isonzo lead to Corso Europa, a road built in the sixties, linking the neighbourhoods to the east of Genoa to the city centre. The nearest motorway exit is Genoa-Nervi, on the A12, 4 miles from Sturla. = Railways = Sturla has a railway station on the Genoa – Pisa line, in which only regional trains stop. It’s used for connections to the other parts of city and the coastal towns Levante Riviera.  Environment  In Sturla there is a Site of Community Importance, as was proposed by the Natura 2000 network of Liguria, for its particular nature and geology. The site is located between Boccadasse, Sturla, Quarto dei Mille, Quinto al Mare and Nervi. It has a very particular habitat formed by Posidonia oceanica (commonly known as Neptune Grass or Mediterranean Tapeweed) and coral formations. Among the animal species are the following fish: tentacled blenny, tompot blenny, seahorse, gray wrasse, brown wrasse, pointed-snout wrasse, east Atlantic peacock wrasse.  Culture  Sturla had one of the most famous groups of singers of Genovese trallalero folk music. The “Canterini Vecchia Sturla” were formed in 1926 but no longer exists.  Sport  La Sportiva Sturla, founded in 1920, is active in water sports (swimming and especially water polo in which they won the championship in 1923, breaking for a single year, a string of successes of their rivals, Andrea Doria, which lasted for twenty years).La mia gente, ed. Il Secolo XIX, 1983, page 198. In more recent times, the water polo team, having missed out on promotion to the A1 league in the early nineties, currently plays in Serie B. La Sportiva Sturla has organized since 1969 the \\"Memorial Morena\\", an international youth swimming meet, which is held every two years, and the \\"Miglio Marino di Sturla\\" swimming competition in the open sea, which has taken place since 1913, which over the years has seen amongst its competitors swimmers of an international standard. Among these we can mention in the men's Mattia Alberico and Marco Formentini, and in the ladies Paola Cavallino and Giorgia Consiglio (the women's race has been held since 1986).Sportiva Sturla - Miglio Marino - Albo d'oro The ASD Urania di Vernazzola, established in 1926, is active in rowing and sport fishing. The Circolo Nautico Sturla, founded in 1981 by some sturlesi is active in sailing, and pesca subacquea (fishing while scuba diving). The CNS is now one of the few clubs in Liguria to be awarded a title of Italian champion teams \\"Fishing SUB second category\\" (1997), and its athlete, Diego Romero, earned a bronze medal in the Laser class at the Beijing Olympics in 2008.

Historical  Single wing offense versus a 6-2. This shows a refinement of the 8 man front, where the cornerback clamps tight on the wingback, presenting a de facto 9 man line to the single wing offense. Yellow triangles are linemen, yellow squares are linebackers, yellow circles are defensive backs. The 6-2 is a defense that became popular in the 1930s due to the demands of the improving passing attacks of the time. In the early 1930s, pro football's passing rules were liberalized.Halas, pp. 167-170. By the late 1930s, the two standard defenses in college and the NFL were the 6-2 and the 5-3. The 5-3 was regarded as a pass defense, and the 6-2, for most teams, was the base defense.Owen, p. 183.Bible, pp. 152-159.Zimmerman, New Thinking Man's Guide to Pro Football, p. 130.Brown and Clary, pp. 82-83 By the 1940s, you could see this defense overshifted or undershifted.Bible, p. 153 Pass defenses were man-to-man, zone, or a combination, the three man secondary lending itself to a Cover 3.Bible, pp. 156-159. Players would pull out of the line, to fall into short zones, as zone blitz teams do today, rushing four and having four players in short zones.Bible, p. 156. Secondary rotations were common as an adjustment to a \\"man in motion\\" from the T. The usage of the 6–2 defense waned as the T formation became more popular and more effective.Zimmerman, The Past is Prelude. By 1950, the base defenses in the NFL were all five man line defenses, either the 5-3 or the 5-2 Eagle.Carroll et al., p. 465. 8 man front defenses were still popular in the college ranks, and the six man line evolved. The defensive lines grew tighter, to gain numerical advantages over the five interior linemen.Smith, Homer, pp. 1-2. Gap control concepts were introduced, and to defend against the original option offense, the Split-T, rotating backfields were introduced.Smith, Homer, p. 3.  Modern Usage  = Types of 6-2 defenses = Steve Belichick differentiates between three fundamental forms of the 6-2, based on the position of the linebackers.Belichick, pp. 56-57. If the linebackers are in the interior of the formation, with three defensive linemen to either side of them, then the formation is called the Split 6. If two guards are found between the two linebackers, then the formation is called the Wide 6 or the Wide Tackle 6. A formation where the linebackers are over the ends, in a fashion akin to the 5-2 Eagle, then the formation is referred to as the Tight 6. Stemming from the Wide Tackle 6 front is the Stacked 6-2. In this formation, the linebackers line up behind the guards instead. = Play of the ends in the six man front = An important function of ends in the original 6-2 or 5-3 defense were as penetrating linemen.Bible, pp. 136-137 Ends were often asked to crash (rush) at 30 to 45 degree angles from the vertical. Even into the early 1940s, as Aldo Forte noted, the crashing ends of the 6-2 could present considerable problems for an opponent.Daly, Chapter 3. Only occasionally were they asked to fall back into pass defense, take on the role of a \\"wide\\" linebacker, or cover an offensive end man-for-man. By the 1950s, however, new contain concepts, such as the \\"five spoke\\" unit emerged.Jones and Wilkinson, Chapter 6. In a \\"five spoke\\" contain strategy, ends, along with the three man defensive backfield, become part of the contain unit. This means that the ends acquire pass coverage responsibilities, and may have to step off the line and away from the defensive tackles to defend against certain pass patterns.Arnsparger, p. 56. So, instead of being pure run defenders and pass rushers, as 4-3 ends are, 6 man defensive ends with contain responsibilities function in ways much like outside linebackers in other defenses.

The Democrats also lost four seats in the Senate, thus resulting in the President's party completely losing control of both houses of Congress, the first time this ever happened in a midterm election. The Democratic Party losses can be traced largely to the Panic of 1893 and the ineffective party leadership of Cleveland. Republicans effectively used the issues of the tariff, bimetallism, and the Cuban War of Independence against Cleveland. The Democrats suffered huge defeats outside the South (almost ninety percent of Northeastern and Midwestern House Democrats lost re-election), and the Democratic Party underwent a major turnover in party leadership.

He and his wife Lucy founded the Inanda Seminary School in 1869. Lindley was pastor to the first Dutch Reformed Church in the Orange Free State. He was a pastor to the Voortrekkers. Description Lindley was born at Ten Mile Creek, Pennsylvania on 24 August 1801. He was the eldest child of Jacob and Hannah Lindley. His father had founded Ohio University so not surprisingly Lindley was educated there and at the Union Seminary in Prince Edward, Virginia. In 1831 he was ordained by the Presbyterian Church. On 20 November 1834 he married Lucy Virginia Allen and they were sent by the American Board of Missions to South Africa. His colleagues on board the Burlington were the medical doctors Newton Adams, Alexander Erwin Wilson, three other missionaries and their wives. When they arrived in Cape Town they still had to cover. Their journey in the company of Alexander Wilson, Henry Venable and their wives took a year by ox cart to get to Matabeleland. Lindley together with other missionaries were to work creating converts amongst the Matabele but their plan was thwarted by the fighting that was taking place between the Dutch and the Matebele. They had to retreat to Natal and from there they were driven away again by the fighting between the Boers and the Zulus. In 1839 Lindley returned and decided that with the Zulus out of reach he should minister to the Boers. He opened a school for their children and was appointed as a pastor. On 31 March 1842, Lindley led the founding congregation of the first Dutch Reformed Church in the Orange Free State.First Dutch Reformed Church in the Orange Free State, SAHistory.org.za, accessed 9 August 2013 These institutions were successful and amongst the first to be confirmed was Paul Kruger who was to be the first President of South Africa. The Lindley family (from L to R): Sarah Adams, James Bryant, Mary Elizabeth, Lucy Virginia, Rev. Daniel Lindley, Clara Louise (in arms), Newton Adams (standing), Mrs. Lucy (Allen) Lindley, Martha Jane, Charles Lutellus (boy), Charlotte Hannah, John and Daniel Allen. In Rochester, New York about 1861. In 1847, Lindley established a station at Inanda, centering his efforts on the Zulus and helping set aside large \\"native locations\\" to protect them from land-hungry settlers. Lindley moved to the Inanda Mission in 1858 with his wife and eleven children. Lindley fired his own bricks to build the mission house which is still standing over 150 years later. The following June Lindley was able to return to the United States. The family returned in October 1862 leaving their third child Sarah behind to take up a position teaching in Rochester, New York. They were away during the American Civil War and whilst they were in Africa their home was razed to the ground. At the Lindleys' retirement in 1873, Zulus and Boers expressed deep regard. The Lindleys retired to the United States in 1874. Lindley died on 3 September 1880 in Morristown, New Jersey. He was buried in the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in New York. School for girls The Seminary. The building that Lindley first built is on the left. The later Edwards Hall is to the right with Lucy Lindley Hall in the background. In 1869 they realised that the Adams School at Adams Mission was successfully creating educated Africans but they had no prospect of finding an educated local wife. They said \\"who are they going to marry? – these naked girls\\".Dumisani Zondi - Educationist from Inanda, ulwazi.org, accessed 15 August 2013 The couple realised this was a problem and founded a school for nineteen girls boarding at Inanda in 1869. The cost of this was borne by the American Missionary Board. The headteacher was brought from Ohio and Mary Kelly Edwards was to serve the school until her death 58 years later. One of the Lindley daughters went on teach at the school but the Lindley family left in April 1873 leaving the organisation that they had established in the hands of the Reverend James Dube. Dube was the son of one of the first Christians in the area. Dube was to die in 1877 but not before he had fathered John Dube who was to found Ohlange High School and take a leading role in creating the African National Congress. Lindley left Inanda having created what would become Inanda Seminary School, the Seminary, a church and several schools based in native huts. Legacy The mission house that Lindley built at the Inanda Mission is still standing and is still used as the main office at the Seminary. Lindley and his wife's major contribution was to establish the school for girls. The Inanda Seminary School is still running and has a good record and noted alumni. In addition, the town of Lindley in the Free State is named after him. A bridge in Pietermaritzburg was named the Daniel Lindley Bridge in 1967.

E-belt model  The E-belt model was developed by William F. Bottke, David Vokrouhlicky, David Minton, David Nesvorný, Alessandro Morbidelli, Ramon Brasser, Bruce Simonson and Harold Levison. It describes the dynamics of an inner band of the early asteroid belt within the framework of the Nice model. = Location and stability = The extended-belt asteroids were located between the current inner boundary of the asteroid belt and the orbit of Mars with semi-major axis ranging from 1.7 to 2.1 astronomical units (AU). In the current Solar System most orbits in this region are unstable due to the presence of the ν6 secular resonance. However, prior to the giant planet migration described in the Nice model the outer planets would have been in a more compact configuration with nearly circular orbits. With the planets in this configuration the ν6 secular resonance would be located outside the asteroid belt. Stable orbits would have existed inside 2.1 AU and the inner edge of the primordial asteroid belt would have been defined by Mars-crossing orbits. = Late Heavy Bombardment = During the migration of the giant planets the ν6 secular resonance would have moved inward as Saturn moved outward. Upon reaching its current location near 2.1 AU the ν6 secular resonance and other related resonances would destabilize the orbits of the E-belt asteroids. Most would be driven onto planet-crossing orbits as their eccentricities and inclinations increased. Over a period of 400 million years impacts of the E-belt asteroids yield an estimated 9-10 of the 12 basin- forming lunar impacts attributed to the Late Heavy Bombardment. = Hungaria asteroids = As their orbits evolved many of the E-belt asteroids would have acquired orbits similar to those of the Hungaria asteroids with high inclinations and semimajor axis between 1.8 and 2.0 AU. Because orbits in this region are dynamically sticky these objects would form a quasi-stable reservoir. As this population of the E-belt asteroids leaked from this reservoir they would produce a long-lived tail of impacts after the traditional end of the late heavy bombardment at 3.7 billion years ago. A remnant representing roughly 0.1–0.4% of the original E-belt asteroids would remain as the current Hungaria asteroids.  Evidence of extended belt  = Problems with alternative sources of LHB = Evidence for the Moon does not support comets from the outer planetesimal belt as the source of the basin- forming lunar impacts. The size frequency distribution (SFD) of ancient lunar craters is a similar to the SFD of main belt asteroids instead of that of comets. Samples recovered from the Moon containing impact melts have a range of ages rather than the sharp spike expected if comets produced the LHB. Analysis of highly siderophile elements in these samples shows a better match for impactors from the inner Solar System than for comets. Studies of the dynamics of the main asteroid belt during giant planet migration have significantly limited the number of impactors originating from this region. A rapid alteration of Jupiter's and Saturn's orbits is necessary to reproduce the current orbital distribution. This scenario removes only 50% of the asteroids from the main belt producing 2–3 basins on the Moon. = Support for E-belt as source of LHB = Examination of samples recovered from the Moon indicates that the impactors were thermally evolved objects. E-type asteroids, an example of this type, are uncommon in the main belt but become more common toward the inner belt and would be expected to be most common in the E-belt. The Hungaria asteroids, which are a remnant of the E-belt in this model, contain a sizable fraction of E-type asteroids. The decay of the population of E-belt asteroids captured onto Hungaria like orbits produces a long-lived tail of impacts which continues past the LHB. The continuation of the bombardment is predicted to generate basin-forming impacts on the Earth and Chicxulub- sized craters on the Earth and Moon. Impact craters on the Moon and impact spherule beds found on the Earth dated to this period are consistent with these predictions. The E-belt model predicts a remnant population will remain on Hungaria-like orbits. The initial population of E-belt asteroids was calculated based on the population of potential basin-forming impactors remaining among the Hungaria asteroids. The result was consistent with calculations based on the recent estimates of the orbital density of the main asteroid belt before the planetary migration.

In 2007, he was convicted of tax evasion stemming from his use of off-shore companies and Swiss banks to hide his financial assets. Early life and education Olenicoff was born in Moscow in 1942.Forbes: \\"The Billionaire With The Empty Pockets\\" by Janet Novack and Tatiana Serafin September 22, 2006 After the war, his family being tsarists, fled the Soviet Union for Iran where he was educated by missionaries. In 1957, his family emigrated to the United States.Global Post: \\"Telling Swiss secrets: The golden goose\\" by Michael Bronner August 5, 2010 In the U.S., his father Michael, an engineer, worked as a janitor, and his mother, Zina, worked as a housekeeper. He graduated from the University of Southern California with an undergraduate degree in corporate finance and mathematics as well as an M.B.A. Olen Properties After school, he worked as a consultant and corporate executive. In 1973, he purchased a 16 unit duplex with his newly founded company Olen Properties. Since then, he has grown the firm and now owns more than 6.4 million square feet of office space and nearly 12,000 residential units in Las Vegas, Arizona, California, and Florida. In 2006, Forbes Magazine estimated his fortune at $1.6 billion, based upon his sole ownership of Olen Properties. However, Olenicoff told the magazine that he did not own the company, claiming that it was owned by an offshore company–incorporated company since 1980. Olen's offshore corporate parent was first headquartered in the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas and Denmark. According to Forbes, the IRS was investigating Olenicoff for tax evasion. The IRS contended that Olenicoff was the sole owner of Olen and used Bahamas-domiciled Sovereign Bancorp Ltd. as an offshore vehicle to hide assets from the IRS and his creditors in order to evade taxes. Olenicoff denied he owned Sovereign, claiming that it was a Russian parastatal investment vehicle established by Boris Yeltsin, and that it had merely lent money to Olen. The IRS hit Olenicoff with a $77 million for back taxes and penalties for the years 1996 and 1997 and was investigating him and Sovereign for the 2002 and 2003 tax years. It was later revealed that Olenicoff was listed on signature cards held by Barclays Bank (Bahamas) as chairman of Sovereign Bancorp and as the president of the National Depository Corporation, Ltd. In 2007, the IRS reported that he also maintained accounts for these two entities at Solomon Smith Barney's British operations, as well as controlled accounts for other offshore companies in Canada and Liechtenstein in which monies from Olen Properties were shifted abroad to avoid taxes. Tax evasion Olenicoff was ensnared in the UBS scandal, in which the Swiss private bank was revealed to have helped American citizens evade billions of dollars in taxes owed to the U.S. government. Olenicoff was recruited to UBS from Barclays Bank by Brad Birkenfeld, who subsequently blew the whistle on UBS's abetting of tax evasion by wealthy Americans. Olenicoff became a client of UBS in 2001, and transferred $200 million to the bank using credit cards supplied by Birkenfeld. In December 2007, Olenicoff pleaded guilty to a single felony count of filing a false tax return for 2002. He admitted to tax evasion and of misleading the IRS about his offshore accounts in the Bahamas, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. As part of his plea bargain, Olenicoff paid a $52 million fine and agreed to repatriate his offshore funds to the United States. In his sentencing on April 14, 2008, Olenicoff blamed his situation on bad financial advice from accountants, bankers, and lawyers and his own thoughtlessness, claiming it was never his intent to defraud the government. On its part, the federal government argued against his serving a prison sentence since he had no prior convictions and his crime had hurt no one financially. Sentencing guidelines called for a prison sentence of up three years, which typically resulted in a sentence of six months, but the federal prosecutors advised against sending Olenicoff to jail. The U.S. probation officer submitted recommended that Olenicoff receive a sentence of one year on probation, while the prosecutor's memorandum recommended probation for three years. While the prosecutor admitted that Olenicoff had cooperated with the government as per the terms of his plea bargain, he had illegally used off-shore banks to avoid taxes since at least 1992.\\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Brett Sagel argued that a shorter probation period would enable the billionaire to speedily repatriate his assets, which currently were out reach of the IRS. U.S. District Court Judge Cormac Carney sentenced Olenicoff to two years on probation and 120 hours of community service. The government had not asked for community service. Carney also fined Olenicoff $3,500 and levied a $100 fee on the felon. He sentenced him to two years probation and 120 hours of community service. The judge specified that the community service had to be separate from Olenicoff's charitable activities. Olenicoff filed a lawsuit against UBS and Birkenfeld in 2008, seeking up to $1.7 billion in damages. Olenicoff alleged that UBS and Birkenfeld had engaged in fraud and conspiracy by giving him bad advice, i.e., that he could avoid paying U.S. taxes by moving his assets to the Swiss bank. American tax law permits residents to have off-shore bank accounts, but they are required to file a Tax Form W9 disclosing the accounts as part of their tax returns. The suit was dismissed in April 2012, with U.S. District Judge Andrew Guilford acting on a motion by UBS and Birkenfeld to dismiss the suit it on the grounds that Olenicoff as a U.S. taxpayer had a duty to know his tax obligations. In his written opinion, Judge Guilford said that Olenicoff since he already pleaded guilty to tax evasion, \\"It is directly inconsistent for him now to claim that he unwittingly relied on UBS's counsel.\\" In August 2012, UBS sued Olenicoff under California law for malicious prosecution. The lawsuit quoted Guilford's decision. The complaint claims, \\"In order to pursue his claim of fraud, he disavowed the sworn statements he made in the criminal case acknowledging his own active deceit, and instead claimed he actually had been unaware that he had lied on his tax returns. This change of his story was done for the purpose of pursuing a false claim of fraud against UBS.\\" UBS is asking for \\"special damages\\" exceeding $3 million plus attorney's fees. Olenicoff publicly responded to the suit by claiming \\"this is some sort of a publicity stunt to chill anyone else's plans to sue UBS.\\" Art forgeries In June 2014, Olenicoff and his real estate company, Olen Properties Corp., were found guilty of copyright infringement by a federal jury and ordered to pay $450,000 in damages to sculptor Don Wakefield, who creates abstract stone sculptures. In 2004, the artist sent emails to Southern California real estate firms, including Olenicoff's real estate company Olen Properties, featuring the image of his amoeba-like sculpture \\"Untitled\\" to see if they were interested in purchasing any of his works. In 2008, Wakefield found a similar sculpture at the Newport Beach, California offices of Olen Properties that he initially thought was the original of his \\"Untitled\\" work. In 2010, he found three more knockoffs of his works at a property in Irvine, California owned by Olen Properties. The company said the works, which were part of a Percent for Art scheme to promote public art, were the work of Chinese sculptor Zhou Hong. In 2011, Olenicoff claimed that the sculpture and three others like it that were on display at other Olen sites had been bought in Beijing during the 2008 Olympic Games. Olenicoff also said he had one of the sculptures modified with the addition of a stainless steel form representing a teardrop. At the time, he refused to confirm or deny whether the sculptures were copies of Wakefield's original work. Wakefield's sculpture would cost $160,000 whereas the Beijing-made knockoffs would cost approximately $35,000 each. Olenicoff also is being sued by sculptor John Raimondi, who was contacted by the real estate tycoon to create versions of two of his extant sculptures as part of a percent-for-art mandate. If Olenicoff had followed through with commissioning the works, Raimondi would have made $100,000 to $250,000. Raimondi had supplied Olenicoff with detailed drawings and photographs of the proposed works, which Olenicof subsequently cancelled. In 2010, Raimondi was informed that sculptures that originally had been submitted to the city of Brea, California as being his works were now credited to a Chinese artist. Raimondi had never authorized the creation or display of the sculptures he had discussed with Olenicoff. A federal jury in June 2014 awarded Wakefield's $450,000 in damages, whilst another federal jury in December 2014 awarded Raimondi $640,000 in damages. Olenicoff has filed a motion that the damages in the Wakefield case be set aside. The \\"Olenicoff Defense\\" Lawyers for billionaire H. Ty Warner, the creator of Beanie Babies, successfully used a defense based on the government's treatment of Olenicoff to spare Warner from a jail sentence. Warner had been convicted of illegally hiding $106 million in offshore accounts, which was revealed when he tried to take advantage of the IRS tax amnesty that was offered in the wake of the 2008-10 UBS tax scandal. The lawyers cited Olenicoff for getting off without a jail sentence when he was sentenced for tax evasion via offshore accounts. Warner's pre-sentencing report that called for a jail sentence said his offshore account was the biggest ever found. In fact, the lawyer's pointed out, Olenicoff had illegally stashed $240 million offshore. The Olenicoff defense worked. On January 14, 2014, District Court Judge Charles P. Kocoras sentenced Warner to two years probation and 500 hours of community service. The judge rejecting the prosecution's recommendation for jail time of one year and one day, to serve as a deterrent to other tax cheats. Olenicoff, who also got two years probation and community service, pleaded guilty to filing a false tax return, a felony. Warner pleaded guilty to the more serious charge of tax evasion. Since Olenicoff was sentenced in 2008, 63% of those defendants in offshore tax evasion cases have not been sentenced to jail. Personal life Olenicoff is married to Jeanne M.

After the death of Tabinshwehti in 1550, the man who started out as a royal household servant of Tabinshwehti in 1516 declared himself king of Prome with the style of Thado Thu (, ), and did not submit to Bayinnaung, Tabinshwehti's chosen successor. His fortified city-state fell to Bayinnaung's forces in 1551 after a six-month battle. He was executed on the order of Bayinnaung, who later regretted the decision. In Thai history, he is identified as the commander who slew Queen Suriyothai on her war elephant during the first Burmese invasion of Siam. Early life The future lord of Prome was a commoner named Shin Nita (). His father was Lord of Kyet-Yo-Bin, a small town.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 100 In April 1516 he was selected to be one of the seven royal servants assigned to Prince Tabinshwehti of Toungoo. He and his family moved into Toungoo Palace precincts where he and other staff, who also consisted of Mingyi Swe and Shin Myo Myat, attended to the crown prince throughout his childhood and youth. The prince in turn had a deep affection and appreciation for his staff. When he became king in November 1530, the 14-year-old king handed out lavish awards and titles to his childhood staff. The new king took two of his childhood playmates, Khin Hpone Soe (daughter of Swe) and Khin Mya (daughter of Nita) as his queens, and awarded both of his fathers-in-law royal titles. Nita was now a royal with the style of Thado Dhamma Yaza.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 183Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 126–127 Viceroy of Prome =Road to viceroyalty= In the next two decades, his career would track the fortunes of Toungoo, and the former commoner would enter the Burmese and Thai history books. From 1534 to 1549, Tabinshwehti and his deputy Bayinnaung, the eldest son of Mingyi Swe, would bring war to all their neighboring kingdoms and build the largest polity in Burma since the fall of Pagan Empire in 1287. But the main contribution of Thado Dhamma Yaza (and that of his longtime colleague Mingyi Swe) was not military leadership.Neither man appeared to have had any meaningful military experience or training. (Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 109): Chronicles only speak of Tabinshwehti, Bayinnaung and other young men at the palace receiving an extensive military education throughout their youth. Though Thado Dhamma Yaza did command a regiment in the 1538–39 campaign,Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 190 his main role, like Mingyi Swe's, was to help administer the kingdom while the king and his armies were out on their annual campaigns. He was twice entrusted to guard the capital Pegu (Bago) during the 1540–1541 campaign against Martaban (Mottama) and during the 1541–1542 campaign against Prome (Pyay).Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 197, 204 Then in May 1542, Toungoo forces conquered Prome, and the king appointed Thado Dhamma Yaza viceroy of the strategically important city.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 213 It was only the third viceroyship appointment (after Mingyi Swe at Toungoo in 1540 and Saw Lagun Ein at Martaban in 1541) by the king, who placed only his most trusted men at key strategic cities.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 175, 185, 199 Indeed, Prome remained a contested city. In the following dry season (1543–1544), the city came under a massive attack by the Confederation of Shan States. Though Toungoo forces fought off the invasion, the city remained on constant guard. When Toungoo forces invaded Arakan in 1546–47, he remained at Prome to guard the rear. (Mingyi Swe also remained at Toungoo for the same reason.)Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 229 =Siamese campaign= A Thai painting depicting Queen Suriyothai (center) on her war elephant putting herself between King Maha Chakkraphat (right) and Thado Dhamma Yaza (left). In 1548, however, both Thado Dhamma Yaza and Mingyi Swe were asked to join in the invasion of Siam. At the start of the invasion, the two viceroys commanded a regiment each in the rearguard army. (The vanguard and main armies were commanded by Bayinnaung and Tabinshwehti respectively.)Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 240–241 But the rearguard men were soon to see action. Thado Dhamma Yaza was featured prominently in two of the major battles reported in the Burmese chronicles. In the first battle, which took place near the Siamese capital of Ayutthaya, possibly at Intaburi,Harvey 1925: 159 the Burmese command placed Thado Dhamma Yaza's army as a decoy while the two main armies lurked on the right and left flanks. The Siamese forces led by their king himself rushed to attack. Thado Dhamma Yaza allowed the Siamese army to press on, enabling Bayainnaung's army to encircle the vanguard of the Siamese army, which was subsequently wiped out. According to Siamese sources, Thado Dhamma Yaza cut down a disguised Queen Suriyothai, who on her war elephant rushed in front of her husband the king's elephant, to receive the blow which severed her from shoulder to heart.(Harvey 1925: 159) citing J. Taylor Jones's 1836–38 publication of \\"Chinese Repository\\" Vol. 5, Chapter: \\"Siamese History\\". p. 162. However, this incident is not found in any of the Burmese chronicles.Chronicles (Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 181–192) and (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 238–248) devote a detailed account of the invasion, down to the names of war elephants the high royalty rode on. Thado Dhamma Yaza rode the war elephant named Ye Htut Mingala (Hmannan Vol. 2 2033: 244). If he was victorious in combat against any enemy of significance, such a story with a favorable outcome would likely have been included in the chronicles. The second battle in which he had a prominent role took place near Kamphaeng Phet c. February 1549. The Burmese forces had been forced to retreat after an unsuccessful month-long siege at Ayutthaya, and had also failed to take Kamphaeng Phet, a fortified town on the route of retreat.Phayre 1967: 101 The battle ensued when Siamese armies came out of fortifications to follow up on the retreating invaders, who in turn stopped to engage the pursuers. In that battle, Thado Dhamma Yaza was entrusted to command an army (1500 men, 300 horses, 50 elephants) that guarded the right flank. The Burmese won the battle and captured two of the most senior Siamese princes. It turned out to be the last battle of the war as the Burmese negotiated a safe retreat in exchange for the return of the princes and other prisoners of war.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 243–244Harvey 1925: 160 King of Prome Just over a year after the Siamese campaign, on 30 April 1550, King Tabinshwehti was assassinated by one of his advisers. Instead of submitting to Tabinshwehti's chosen successor Bayinnaung, vassal rulers of major regions as well as those of small remote towns all declared themselves independent. The kingdom Tabinshwehti had arduously built up in the previous 16 years appeared ruined.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 258Phayre 1967: 102–103 Thado Dhamma Yaza was no exception. He declared himself king of Prome, with the style of Thado Thu. His rule was brief. Nine months into his reign, he came under Bayinnaung's crosshairs. On 11 January 1551, Bayinnaung captured his ancestral city of Toungoo from his own brother, and picked Prome as his next target. In March 1551,The chronicle Maha Yazawin (Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 202) gives Friday, 8th waxing of Late Tagu 912 ME as the date when the Prome campaign began. The date (though not the day of the week) was corrected by later chronicles Yazawin Thit and Hmannan Yazawin (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 266) as Friday, 2nd waxing of Late Tagu 912 ME. Both dates are slightly off with respective to the day of the week given: Hmannan's 2nd waxing of Late Tagu 912 ME translates to Sunday, (not Friday), 8 March 1551 while Maha Yazawin's 8th waxing of Late Tagu 912 ME translates to Saturday (not Friday), 14 March 1551. Bayinnaung's armies (9000 troops, 300 horses, 25 elephants) attacked the city but Prome's musket and artillery fire repelled repeated enemy charges. On 19 June 1551,Both Maha Yazawin and Hmannan chronicles give Wednesday, 2nd waning of Waso 913 ME, which actually translates to Friday, 19 June 1551. Bayinnaung's forces retreated.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 265–266Kala Vol. 2 2006: 202 But the relief was temporary. Bayinnaung returned with another army of similar strength (made up of fresh recruits from central Burma) on 21 August 1551.Chronicles give as Thursday, 6th waning of Tawthalin 913 ME, which was Friday, 21 August 1551. They attacked the city after hours on 29 August 1551. The city's defenses were breached around midnight by a battalion led by Minkhaung II, who is said to have forced the break-through by ramming his war elephant through a broken part of the wooden gates of the wall.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 267–268 Thado Dhamma Yaza tried to flee the scene but was captured. When Bayinnaung found out that Thado Dhamma Yaza was preparing to leave for Arakan, he ordered the execution right away. The king is said to have regretted the decision. He had known the former Shin Nita all his life, and the fallen pretender was like an uncle to him.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 262–263 Bayinnaung then appointed his second eldest younger brother viceroy of Prome. The brother became known as Thado Dhamma Yaza II of Prome.

Peaches' Lament was a 15-minute piece for four dancer/musicians who danced both together and alone, both in silence and to music they performed on four keyboards. In the January 1979 issue of Dance Magazine, Amanda Smith wrote that Peaches' Melisma created a “slightly eerie limbo” through which the work slowly emerged. Peaches' Beacon (1976) was a one-hour piece for a large ensemble, with the themes of being lost, communication in unknown realms, rescue, and codes. All of the vocals, piano, and percussion in Peaches Beacon was performed by the cast of eighteen dancer/actor/musicians.

The film is an episodic narrative displaying examples of humankind's brutality, from the story of Cain and Abel through the Hague Convention of 1907. Summary Another promotional still of the film, showing the Parisian apaches. The film's first ten episodes feature Cain and Abel, the Druids, Nero and Locusta, the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire, the pillories of the Middle Ages, the Gibbet of Montfaucon, torture processes in the Middle Ages, Louis XIII, contemporary Parisian apaches, and the Hague Convention of 1907.Malthête & Mannoni, p. 229. The Hague scene ends with the convention collapsing into chaos, with the delegates, who had convened to limit the power of armies, directly attacking each other. The eleventh and final scene, titled \\"Triumph,\\" shows an Angel of Destruction hovering over a battlefield covered with dead and wounded soldiers. Production Prud'hon's Justice and Divine Vengeance Pursuing Crime Humanity Through the Ages was made in response to successful historical films such as The Last Days of Pompeii, and directed in a highly serious style contrasting sharply with most of Méliès's work. Méliès made two appearances in the film, as a druid and as a judge in the Spanish Inquisition.Malthête & Mannoni, p. 228. The first scene includes a moment staged by Méliès to recreate Pierre-Paul Prud'hon's 1808 painting Justice and Divine Vengeance Pursuing Crime. The Méliès scholars Paul Hammond and John Frazer have noted that the film's highly pessimistic tone is unusual among Méliès's work; both scholars have suggested that the pessimism derives from the intense commercial pressure Méliès felt from competitors during the making of the film. Release and reception The film was released by Méliès's Star Film Company as its first film of 1908Malthête & Mannoni, p. 31. and numbered 1050–1065 in its catalogs. It was registered for American copyright at the Library of Congress on 7 February 1908. According to the film historian Jay Leyda, the film created a sensation when it was released in Russia. Méliès's son, André Méliès, reported that Humanity Through the Ages was the film his father felt proudest of. It is now presumed lost.

One source states that in 1732, Lord Fairfax granted William Snodgrass a tract of land in what is now Berkeley County, West Virginia, upon which he began building the tavern.Fuss 1972, p. 2. However, other sources claim John Ford began the original construction, selling the land at some point to the Rawlings family, who then sold the land to Robert Snodgrass in 1779.Taylor 2005, p. 9.Snodgrass Tavern Nevertheless, the Snodgrass name became associated with the tavern. Beginning around 1742, construction of the building was begun.Taylor 2005, p. 2. The first section built was a -story square log structure of side length . This was followed about fifteen years later by a separate two-story log structure approximately 10 feet to the west of the first structure. Eventually these separate structures were connected, and the first section was increased to a full two stories. Around 1813, the last addition to the tavern was added along the entire length of the northern side of the structure and was constructed from sandstone.Taylor 2005, p. 6. The building has twin chimneys on both ends, which is considered an unusual feature in the area.Fuss 1972, p. 5. A veranda spans the full length of the building's front side.Capace 1999, p. 207. Although the exact date when the structure became a tavern is uncertain, it is believed to have become such gradually and at an early date.Fuss 1972, p. 3. The tavern room was by in dimension, which was exceptionally large for tavern rooms of that era. The tavern was located approximately halfway between Martinsburg and what is now known as Berkeley Springs. This led to the property being referred to as the Halfway House. The tavern lasted until 1847, when James Snodgrass, who refused to sell liquor (causing business to dwindle), began renting out the tavern and eventually sold it. The building became a private residence, in which state it remains. The tavern received several notable visitors throughout its existence. George Washington visited the tavern on multiple occasions. The first visit occurred in 1750, when Washington was surveying land for Lord Fairfax. Another visit was recorded in Washington's diary on September 5, 1784. Washington also stopped at Snodgrass when traveling to Berkeley Springs (also known as Bath) on other occasions. Noted politician Henry Clay visited Snodgrass Tavern while visiting friends in the area during July 1827, at which time he was the U.S. Secretary of State. The tavern was originally listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 24, 1973. On March 22, 2006, the property's boundaries were extended from an original area of (the tavern itself)Fuss 1972, p. 4. to .Taylor 2005, p. 4. This expansion was done to include other historic structures and sites on the property, including a slave cemetery and various outbuildings.Taylor 2005, pp. 7-8. Snodgrass Tavern is one of the oldest buildings still standing in West Virginia.

Club career =AS Monaco= Born in Meaux, France, Tisserand began his career at INF Clairefontaine before leaving for Monaco when he was thirteen. In June 2013, he signed his first professional contract with Monaco, having spent four years at the reserve side. Following this, he was called up by the first team for the pre-season tour with Monaco by manager Claudio Ranieri. Ranieri was impressed with his ability in training and took him to the pre-season with the club. Tisserand made his professional debut at 10 August 2013 against Bordeaux in the first Ligue 1 game for AS Monaco in the 2013–14 season. On 5 October 2013, he made his first Monaco start, playing in the left–back position, in a 2–1 win over Saint-Étienne. On 19 December 2013, he signed a contract extension with the club, keeping him until 2018. However, he struggled in the first team, being relegated to the substitutes bench due to competition from Layvin Kurzawa and making six appearances in the 2013–14 season. After ending his two–year loan spell at Toulouse, Tisserand returned to Monaco and expressed desire to play in the Monaco’s first team in the 2016–17 season. In the 2016–17 season, he only made one appearance for the club, in a 1–0 win over Nantes on 20 August 2016. Loan to Lens After being told by the club’s management that he was allowed to leave the club in the winter transfer window, Tisserand joined Ligue 2 side Lens on loan for the rest of the season on 20 January 2014. Upon joining Lens, he expressed hope the move would help him earn a first-team chance at Monaco next season. Tisserand made his Lens debut on 27 January 2014, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–1 win over Auxerre. On 8 March 2014, he scored his first professional goal in a 1–0 win over Metz. From that moment on, he became a first-team regular under Manager Antoine Kombouaré for the rest of the season going on to help the club achieve promotion to Ligue 2 (which was later invalidated). Despite setbacks from injury and suspension, Tisserand made a total of twelve appearances for the club, all of which were starts. At the end of the 2013–14 season, the club was keen on signing him on loan for a second time. However, they did not succeed in re-signing him citing financial problems. Loan to Toulouse Expecting to be loaned out again, Tisserand was loaned once again to fellow Ligue 1 side Toulouse in July 2014. At the start of the season, he suffered an injury that ruled him out for several matches. In September, he returned to first-team training and made his Toulouse debut on 23 September 2014, starting in a 3–0 win over Rennes. At end of 2014, he suffered a further injury setback and at one point, was ineligible to play against his parent club, Monaco, despite request from Toulouse. After returning to the first team, Tisserand provided an assist for Aleksandar Pešić to score the only goal in 1–0 win against Reims on 31 January 2015. In a 3–2 loss against Metz on 4 April 2015, he was sent off for a second bookable offence and served one-match suspension as a result. Despite suffering setbacks towards the end of the season, Tisserand went on to make 22 appearances in all competitions in the 2014–15 season. In the 2015–16 season, Monaco manager Leonardo Jardim stated he was keen on using Tisserand in the first team this season, due to his good performance in the previous season. On 21 July 2015, however, Tisserand was loaned out to Toulouse again for the season. He made his season debut in the opening game of the season, playing as a right–back in a 2–1 win over Saint- Étienne. He was sent off for a second bookable offence in the second half of a 3–0 win over Troyes on 2 December 2015, and was suspended for two matches. On 24 January 2016, Tisserand started against his parent club, Monaco, where he played for 67 minutes, in a 4–0 loss. He scored his first Toulouse goal on 23 April 2016, in a 3–2 loss against Lyon. Having become a first team regular in his second season at the club, Tisserand went on to make 36 appearances scoring once in all competitions. Reflecting on his time at Toulouse, Tisserand credited Manager Pascal Dupraz for helping the side avoid relegation, where they finished 17th place. =Ingolstadt= On 31 August 2016, Tisserand signed a four-year contract with Bundesliga side Ingolstadt. The transfer fee paid to Monaco was reported as €5.5 million. Tisserand made his Ingolstadt debut on 10 September 2016, making his first start, in a 2–0 loss against Hertha. Since then, he became a first team regular at Ingolstadt until he left for his international commitment. Following DR Congo’s elimination in the Africa Cup of Nation, he returned to the first team on 11 February 2017, in a 2–0 loss against Bayern Munich. Following this, Tisserand continued to regain his first team place for the rest of the season. However, FC Ingolstadt 04 was relegated to 2.Bundesliga after drawing 1–1 against SC Freiburg on 13 May 2017, which he set up a goal for Maximilian Philipp to score the opener in the game. At the end of the 2016–17 season, Tisserand went on to make twenty–nine appearances in all competitions. =Wolfsburg= It was announced on 22 August 2017 that Wolfsburg signed Tisserland on a season–long loan deal for the rest of the 2017–18 season. It came after when FC Ingolstadt 04 dropped both him and Florent Hadergjonaj from the first team until the end of August. Tisserand made his VfL Wolfsburg debut, starting the whole game, in a 1–0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt on 26 August 2017. However, he suffered a thigh injury that kept him out for two matches and didn’t return until on 22 September 2017, starting the whole game, in a 2–2 draw against Bayern Munich. Since returning from injury, Tisserand regained his first team place, playing in the centre–back position under the management of Andries Jonker and performed impressively in a number of matches, especially in the left–back position. It was announced on 28 November 2017 that the club had taken up options to sign Tisserand on a permanent basis. Shortly after, Tisserand was sidelined with an illness and fitness that kept him out for three matches. It wasn’t until on 16 December 2017 when he returned from the sidelined, coming on as a substitute in the second half, as they lost 1–0 against 1. FC Köln. Since returning from injury, Tisserand regained his first team place, playing in either the centre–back and left–back position throughout January. However, he tore his tendon and had to be substituted during a 2–1 loss against FC Schalke 04 in the quarter–final of the DFB-Pokal, resulting in him being sidelined for two months. It wasn’t until on 20 April 2018 when Tisserand returned from injury, coming on as a substitute for John Brooks, in a 3–0 loss against Borussia Mönchengladbach. But his return was short–lived when he tore his tendon, ruling him out for the rest of the 2017–18 season. At the end of the season, he went on to make nineteen appearances in all competitions. Tisserand remained on the sideline at the start of the 2018–19 season, as he continued to recover from his tendon injury. His first appearance of the season came on 5 October 2018, starting a match before coming off as a substitute in the 86th minutes, in a 2–0 loss against Werder Bremen. Tisserand appeared four matches between 27 October 2018 and 9 November 2018, playing in the centre–back position. However, he suffered a thigh injury that saw him sidelined for months. It wasn’t until on 13 April 2019 when Tisserand returned to the starting line- up, playing in the right–back position, as the club lost 2–0 against RB Leipzig. He regained his first team place, playing in the right–back position once before playing in the centre–back position for the remaining games of the 2018–19 season. Tisserand then scored his first goal for the club, in a 2–0 win over 1. FC Nürnberg on 4 May 2019. At the end of the 2018–19 season, he went on to make twelve appearances and scoring once in all competitions. Ahead of the 2019–20 season, Tisserand was linked a move away from VfL Wolfsburg, as clubs, such as, Toulouse, Augusburg and Espanyol interested in signing him. But in the end, he stayed at the club. Having missed the start of the 2019–20 season, due to injury, Tisserand’s first appearance of the season came on 13 September 2019, starting the whole game, in a 1–1 draw against Fortuna Düsseldorf. Since returning to the first team from injury, he quickly became a first team regular, playing in the centre–back position. Tisserand then scored his first goal of the season, in a 1–0 win over Mainz on 28 September 2019. = Fenerbahçe = On 15 September 2020 he joined Turkish side Fenerbahçe. International career While born in France to a French father and a Congolese mother, Tisserand represented Congo DR U19 in 2012 and was the captain of Congo DR U20 in the 2013 Toulon Tournament. In March 2016, he was called up to the provisional squad of the senior Congo national team before being dropped due to administrative issues. Tisserand subsequently stated that he desired to play for the DR Congo. The following month, he debuted for the DR Congo in a friendly 1–1 tie with Romania in May 2016. The following January, Tisserand was called up to the squad for the Africa Cup of Nations. He played on match day 1 of the group stage, in a 1–0 win over Morocco on 16 April 2017. He went on to make five appearance in the tournament, as DR Congo were eliminated in the quarter–finals by Ghana. Two years later, Tisserand was called up to the DR Congo squad for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. He played all the matches, including being a captain against the tournament host, Egypt on 26 June 2019. However, DR Congo were eliminated from the tournament after losing to Madagascar in the Round of 16 of the African Cup of Nations. Career statistics Personal life Tisserand grew up in Meaux, France, and supported Paris Saint-Germain. He has an older brother, Patrick, who is also his agent, as well as two brothers, who are engineers, and a sister, who is an accountant. In addition to speaking French, Tisserand speaks Lingala and understands Kongo language, something he learned from his grandmother. Since moving to Germany, he also speaks German, having taken lessons to learn the language.

The first shale gas well in England was drilled in 1875. A number of wells have been drilled, and favourable tax treatment has been offered to shale gas producers. In July 2013 UK Prime Minister David Cameron had claimed that, \\"fracking has real potential to drive energy bills down\\". \\"Shale gas is a resource with huge potential to broaden the UK's energy mix,\\" said the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne. \\"We want to create the right conditions for industry to explore and unlock that potential in a way that allows communities to share in the benefits. This new tax regime, which I want to make the most generous for shale in the world, will contribute to that. I want Britain to be a leader of the shale gas revolution – because it has the potential to create thousands of jobs and keep energy bills low for millions of people.\\" However, in November 2013 representatives from industry and government, such as former BP Chief Executive and government advisor Lord Browne, Energy Secretary Ed Davey and economist Lord Stern said that fracking in the UK alone will not lower prices as the UK is part of a well connected European market. In July, Osborne said: \\"This a real chance to get cheaper energy for Britain … a major new energy source that can reduce energy bills.\\"In August, Cameron said: \\"If we don't back this technology, we will miss a massive opportunity to help families with their bills … fracking has real potential to drive energy bills down.\\" In November, \\"the chairman of the UK's leading shale gas company\\", Lord Browne, said \\"Fracking is not going to reduce gas prices in the UK\\". \\"The statement by Lord Browne, one of the most powerful energy figures in Britain, contradicts claims by David Cameron and George Osborne that shale gas exploration could help curb soaring energy bills.\\" \\"North Sea gas didn’t significantly move UK prices – so we can’t expect UK shale production alone to have any effect,\\" Mr Davey said, pointing out that Britain is just one part of the wider European gas market. He said it was \\"far from clear that UK shale gas production could ever replicate the price effects seen in the US\\", where the shale gas boom has seen prices plummet. The comments stand in stark contrast to those of David Cameron, who wrote in the Telegraph last month that \\"fracking has real potential to drive energy bills down\\" , there has been no commercial production of shale gas in the UK. Areas The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) originally identified large areas of eastern and southern England as having the \\"best shale gas potential\\": However the British Geological Survey report released in October 2014 said that there was little potential for shale gas in the Weald Basin as the field has not yet reached thermal maturation, however may exhibit oil-shale potential. (see 'Weald Basin' below) =Bowland Basin= As of June 2013, the Bowland Basin was the only area in the UK where wells have been drilled specifically for shale gas. Four wells have been drilled by Cuadrilla Resources, and one by IGAS Energy. None of the wells have produced gas. Cuadrilla started drilling Britain's first shale gas exploration well, the Preese-Hall-1, in August 2010. The well penetrated 800m of organic-rich shale. The company hydraulically fractured the well in early 2011, but suspended the operation when it triggered two seismic events of magnitudes (ML) 2.3 and 1.5, the larger of which was feltA spokesman for Blackpool Police said: \\"We started to get calls at around 3.35am. Some may have thought it was an April Fool prank, but staff here felt the building move.\\" by at least 23 people at the surface.\\"Twenty-three reports of the shaking caused by the earthquake were used to determine earthquake intensity. We find a maximum intensity of 4 EMS close to the epicentre. This is consistent with a magnitude 2.3 earthquake at a depth of 3.5 km, however, the limited nature of the data means that this is also poorly constrained.\\" Work on the well stopped in May 2011, and the government declared a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing that was sustained until December 2012, subject to additional controls to limit seismic risk. In September 2011, Cuadrilla announced a huge discovery of 200 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas in place under the Fylde Coast in Lancashire. Cuadrilla stated that it would be happy if it could recover 10–20% of the gas in place. Lord Browne ignored this latter point in media interviews, claiming that the Lancashire discovery could satisfy the UK's gas consumption \\"for 56 years\\", Browne gets his headline- grabbing figure of 56 years by simply dividing the size of the entire Lancashire find, about 5.6 Tcm, by annual UK gas consumption, currently around 0.1 Tcm. Such a calculation takes no account of the fact that only a minority of the Lancashire discovery is recoverable. with similar, sensational media reports claiming that the find was \\"so rich it could meet Britain's needs for decades\\", or that it had \\"the potential to do more for Lancashire than the cotton industry.\\" (For comparison, the cotton industry in Lancashire employed, at peak penetration in 1811, 37% of the county, or about 70,000 people; Cuadrilla believes fracking will create 1,700 jobs in Lancashire, current population 1.1m). The British Geological Survey—responsible for producing inventories of the UK's mineral resources, and far more cautious in its estimates—felt prompted, however, to re-evaluate its projections in light of the find, which Cuadrilla believes could provide 5,600 jobs in the UK at the peak of production. Industry estimates suggest shale gas in Lancashire alone could deliver £6bn of gas a year for the next three decades. In July 2013, Cuadrilla applied for a permit to hydraulically fracture its previously drilled well at the Grange Hill site. In April 2014, Cuadrilla published news of their continuing consultation with residents shale gas exploration sites in the Fylde. In 2011 and 2012, IGas Energy drilled a deep well to evaluate shale gas, and found gas shows in the Bowland Shale, with total organic content averaging 2.7%. The formation was reported to be thermally mature, in the wet gas window. IGAS bought large blocks of gas licences in 2011, much of which is reportedly prospective for shale gas. IGas announced that it would drill a well to evaluate shale gas at Barton, near Manchester. Drilling would begin in October 2013, and take two to three months. IGas has not applied for a permit to hydraulically fracture the well. In 2019 Lancashire Constabulary estimated the cost of policing fracking in the county, between June 2017 and June 2019, as £11.745m. =Weald Basin= A BGS/DECC report from May 2014 indicates that there is little potential for shale gas fracturing in the Weald Basin, south of London. It does suggest that there is the possibility for the extraction of light tight oil from shales (LTO) Subsequent exploration showed a potentially major oil field near Gatwick Airport, from which oil is being extracted via a conventional technique at a well known as Horse Hill. Initial forecasts of a flow rate of 1000+ barrels per week were not realised, and on 11 April 2019 the firm involved issued a regulatory news release indicating that the initial flow rate achieved had been 360 barrels per week, this had dropped to 220 barrels a week, and as at the date of the news release, the well was being shut down for 60 hours to allow the oil pressure around the well to build back up. This production at Horse Hill is strictly speaking of tight oil from Kimmeridge micrites (Jurassic limestone bands), not of oil from shales. Drilling at Broadford Bridge in May 2018 gave a non-commercial outcome (only trivial amounts of oil could be extracted from the hole [the potential well] drilled). The firm involved has indicated that it will drill 4 more test holes at Horse Hill in an attempt to boost production, one or more new test holes at Broadford Bridge in the hope of a better result there, and a test hole at a site not yet acquired/identified in licensed block PEDL143, also known as the Holmwood block, after buying a controlling interest from other onshore oil firms in exploration licence there. All of these exploration activities relate to tight oil from Kimmeridge micrites (Jurassic limestone bands), not to oil from shales as such. =Northern Ireland= According to February 2013 reports from PricewaterhouseCoopers, there could be £80 billion in reserves in Northern Ireland, although these claims were criticised as being sensationalist. =National Parks= The Durham Energy Institute has examined the likelihood of drilling in National Parks. The parks with geologies of interest are the North York Moors, the Peak District, the South Downs and to the south of the Yorkshire Dales. \\"This research has found that, of the 15 national parks in Britain, there are: 4 (North Yorks Moors, Peak District, South Downs, and Yorkshire Dales) with rocks of possible interest to companies looking to frack for shale gas, shale oil, or coalbed methane\\" Resource estimates According to a 2011 report of the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, \\"Shale gas resources in the UK could be considerable—particularly offshore—but are unlikely to be a \\"game changer\\" to the same extent as they have been in the US, where the shale gas revolution has led to a reduction in natural gas prices.\\" The Committee's chairperson, Tim Yeo, revised his personal opinion in 2012, however, and argued shale gas is a \\"game changer\\" that could \\"transform the UK's energy independence\\". Interest in fracking came just as imports of gas to the UK had surpassed domestic production in 2011 for the first time since the 1960s. Estimating the size of recoverable resource is difficult due to the uncertainty of the usually small percentage of shale gas that is recoverable. In addition, companies may embrace large estimations of reserves to boost share prices. In the United States, companies had been subpoenaed in 2011 on suspicion that the projections they provided to investors, including press-release figures, were inflated. In 2012, national agencies in the U.S and Poland revised dramatically downward their estimates of shale gas resources. Part of the problem in evaluation is also the uncertainty of decline curve analysis from early data: shale gas wells can fall off sharply during the first year or two, then level off to a slower decline rate; the shape of the curve, and therefore the ultimate recovery, is difficult to predict from early production rates. A typical well in North Dakota's seemingly prolific Bakken shale oil and gasfield, for example, may produce more than 1,000 barrels of oil per day in year [one], but only 200 in year two, according to Lynn Helms, director of the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources. Existing fracking methods are capable of extracting only 5 per cent of the oil content of the shale. This can be raised to 15 per cent by multiple extractions from each wellhead. Even then, 85 per cent of the oil remains below ground. Before drilling, IGas estimated gas in place of 4.6 Tcf in the Ince Marshes site, though it was unlikely that more than 20% of it could be recoverable; After drilling their first well, IGas announced that the estimated gas in place was at least double their previous estimate. In early 2012, Celtique Energie estimated that there might be as much as 14 Tcf of recoverable reserves in countryside south of Horsham, West Sussex. Preliminary estimates in 2011 suggested that there may be £70bn worth of shale gas in South Wales, and 1.5bn bbl oil equivalent in Northern Ireland according to a report by PwC. =British Geological Survey= In June 2013, the British Geological Survey estimated the gas in place within the Bowland Shale of central Britain to be within the range of 822 Tcf to 2281 Tcf, with a central estimate of , but did not estimate how much of the gas was likely to be recoverable, and cautioned: :\\"Estimates of the amount of recoverable gas and the gas resources are variable. It is possible that the shale gas resources in UK are very large. However, despite the size of the resource, the proportion that can be recovered is the critical factor.\\" Industry estimates were that about 10% of gas in place could be extracted. 130 Tcf would supply Britain's gas needs for about 50 years. Comment from the British Geological Survey suggested even more substantial shale gas reserves offshore. =US Energy Information Administration= In June 2013, the US Energy Information Administration issued a worldwide estimate of shale gas, which included an incomplete estimate of recoverable shale gas resources in the UK. The Carboniferous shale basins of North of England and Scotland, which include the Bowland Basin, were estimated to have 25 trillion cubic feet of recoverable shale gas. The Jurassic shales of the Wessex Basin and Weald Basin of southern England were estimated to have 600 billion cubic feet of recoverable shale gas and 700 million barrels of associated oil. The agency noted that the UK shale basins are more complex than those in the US, and therefore more costly to drill. On the other hand, as of June 2013, the price of natural gas in the United Kingdom was reported to be more than double the price in the US and Canada by one source and three times higher by other sources. Regulation In 2012, a joint report by the Royal Society and Royal Association of Engineers (RS/RAE), commissioned by the government to identify the problems and advise regulatory agencies, emphasised that regulation \\"must be fit for purpose\\" with a focus on maintaining \\"regulatory co-ordination and capacity\\" and \\"the way in which risks scale up should a future shale gas industry develop nationwide.\\" The government responded with a paper that outlined the requirements of the regulatory framework. In January 2014, an impact assessment by the European Commission concluded that existing legal and regulatory environments for shale gas exploration and development were insufficient, and recommended a new directive with specific requirements for high volume hydraulic fracturing to address: \\"environmental risks and impacts\\"; allay \\"public concerns\\", and; \\"enable investments\\". In August 2016, the Environment Agency followed up their 2013 draft consultation with their final version on guidance for \\"flow testing and well stimulation, including hydraulic fracturing\\" for onshore operators in England. Late in 2018, a former labour MP and parliamentarian of the year 2013, Natascha Engel, was appointed as the \\"UK commissioner for fracking\\". At about the same time, 49 geologists wrote joint letters to British broadsheet newspapers arguing that a limit of 0.5 on earthquakes around an active fracking site, above which fracking must cease, was too low. Cuadrilla, an oil and gas exploration firm, was unable to continue its fracking operation in Lancashire because minor earthquakes above this limit were occurring; they could not be detected by residents, but could by instrumentation, and were pretty clearly associated with the fracking activities, given their timing. On 28 April 2019, the commissioner for \\"fracking\\" has resigned, saying that development of fracking (in Lancashire area and the Bowland shale) was being \\"throttled\\" by rules preventing mini earthquakes of 0.5. =Criticism= In 2012, the joint Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering report was critical of current regulation which failed to ensure independence of the well examiner scheme by ensuring that the well examiner was independent of the operating company.] The government responded: \\"there are a few well operators who wish to use in-house examiners, and that option is legally open to them if they can fulfil the DCR (Design and Construction Regulations) requirements of an appropriate level of impartiality and independence from any aspects of the well design/construction/operation.\\"(paraphrase this instead of using quote) Climate change Shale gas is largely methane, a hydrocarbon fuel. As such the carbon dioxide it produces contributes to global warming, although less so than coal. Of more concern is leaking or fugitive emissions of unburned methane, which is a greenhouse gas. It has been argued that, in opening a new source of hydrocarbons, it may reduce the incentive and financing of renewable sources of energy. The 2008 Climate Change Act committed the UK to reducing CO2 emissions by 50% in 2030, and by 80% by 2050. In 2013, the UK generated 36% of its electricity from coal. According to , replacing coal with shale gas would be one possible solution that provides reliable on demand electricity as it has a greenhouse gas equivalent value of about half that of coal. The UK is much smaller than the USA, and European energy markets are different, so we extrapolate from the American studies with caution. That said, if shale gas were extracted in the UK, and if the price of shale gas were low enough, one would expect, as in America, (a) an increase in demand for gas; (b) a switch of electricity production from coal to gas; and (c) that UK shale gas production would substitute for a mix of UK production and imports, the latter of which could be by pipeline from Norway or the Continent or as LNG. Because the UK has strong links to the North West European gas market, production from unconventional gas in the UK alone is unlikely to have a significant impact on the wider European market price59 so the increase in gas demand and the coal- to-gas substitution are expected to be small. The first-order effect of the switch of electricity production from coal to gas would be to reduce the emissions-rate of the electricity production sector. Since this sector falls within the emissions trading scheme, there might be no effect on the overall emissions rate in the EU ETS (the reduction in electricity emissions would cause the value of emissions permits to fall slightly, and emissions-reduction effort in other sectors in the EU ETS would decline such that the emissions rate remained at the level set by the cap). A 2011 study based in the United States found that, due to the fugitive emissions of methane, shale gas may produce more greenhouse gas emissions than coal. The study was criticised by other researchers,, but the authors argue that their data has since been corroborated by other studies. A 2013 government-sponsored study of the effect of large-scale natural gas development in Britain concluded that emissions from shale gas could be consistent with meeting climate change targets so long as the emissions were counteracted by similar size reductions elsewhere in the world, although the authors suggest that 'without global climate policies...new fossil fuel exploitation is likely to lead to an increase in cumulative carbon emissions and the risk of climate change'. In April 2014, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its 5th Assessment report. With regard to natural gas, and the shale gas debate, it states \\"GHG emissions from energy supply can be reduced significantly by replacing current world average coal‐fired power plants with modern, highly efficient natural gas combined‐cycle power plants or combined heat and power plants, provided that natural gas is available and the fugitive emissions associated with extraction and supply are low or mitigated (robust evidence, high agreement). In mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 ppm CO2eq concentrations by 2100, natural gas power generation without CCS acts as a bridge technology, with deployment increasing before peaking and falling to below current levels by 2050 and declining further in the second half of the century (robust evidence, high agreement)\\". In November 2014, the UK Energy Research Centre issued a report that stated \\"gas could play an important role as a ‘bridging fuel’ to a low-carbon economy, but warns that it won't be long before gas becomes part of the problem rather than the solution\\". It noted that the UK imports more than half its gas, and that \\"gas use beginning to fall in the late 2020s and early 2030s, with any major role beyond 2035 requiring the widespread use of carbon capture and storage\\" It also states \\"Instead of banking on shale, UKERC recommends rapidly expanding investment in alternative low-carbon energy sources and investing in more gas storage, which would help protect consumers against short-term supply disruption and price rises\\" Environmental impact In 2012, the jointly published Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering Shale Gas Review included recommendations on groundwater contamination, well integrity, seismic risk, gas leakage, noise pollution, water usage and disposal, management of environmental risk, implementation of best practice, with well integrity being \\"of key importance\\". =Air pollution= There are concerns, originating in the USA that drilling could lead to pollution from hydrocarbon based chemicals. Regulations in the UK call for total fluid and gas security meaning that in routine operations, no unburnt gases would be emitted. Venting of unburnt gas is only permitted for safety reasons or in an emergency. Flaring =Groundwater contamination= The British Geological Survey, in reviewing the US experience with hydraulic fracturing of shale formations, observed: \\"where the problems are genuinely attributable to shale gas operations, the problem is with poor well design and construction, rather than anything distinctive to shale gas.\\" Contamination of groundwater by methane can occur after the abandonment of the well: \\"Gas and other contaminants may accumulate slowly in these cracks, enter shallow strata or even leak at the surface many years after production or well abandonment. Even the presence of surface casing provides no assurance against gas leakage at the surface from the surrounding ground.\\" =Land usage= Directional drilling allows a large hydrocarbon reservoir to be accessed using a single well pad, such as in Europe's biggest onshore oilfield, Wytch Farm. Likely well spacing visualised by the December 2013 DECC Strategic Environmental Assessment report indicated that well pad spacings of 5 km were likely in crowded areas, with up to 3 hectares per well pad. Each pad could have 24 separate wells. This amounts to 0.16% of land area. In 2016, the Chartered Institute for Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) stated that shale gas fields will potentially be \\"more extensive\\" than conventional onshore fields, using around 3.6 ha per shale gas well pad compared to 1.9 ha for conventional well pads, and that after \\"completion or abandonment\\" of a shale gas well pad, \\"it may not be possible to fully restore sites\\" \\"in areas of high agricultural, natural or cultural value\\". \\"Shale gas formations typically cover much wider lateral extent than conventional gas reservoirs and will require multiple surface entry points. Surface installations require an area of approximately 3.6 hectares per pad for high volume hydraulic fracturing during the fracturing and completion phases, compared to 1.9 hectares per pad for conventional drilling. This opens the possibility of more extensive gas fields. Following the completion or abandonment of a well it may not be possible to fully restore sites particularly in areas of high agricultural, natural or cultural value. Over a wider area, with multiple installations, this could result in a significant loss or fragmentation of valuable farmland or natural habitats, which must be considered during the planning process.\\" =Well integrity= According to Professor Mair, who chaired the joint review by the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering, \\"well integrity is of key importance\\". In the first UK shale gas well, Preese Hall 1, the cement bond log (CBL) showed some places with poor cement behind the casing in the lowest 100 feet of the well, between zones in the production hole section, which were repaired to achieve better zone isolation. Without repair, production would have been compromised, but not the integrity of the well. The magnitude 2.3M coseismic slip of 1 April 2011 caused casing deformation in \\"the lower section of the reservoir productive zone\\" of the Preese Hall 1 well. Well \\"integrity was not considered a risk\\" due to the \\"integrity of the casing, and the cement, in the upper completion\\", \\"confirmed by surface gas measurements and annular pressure readings\\". Well leak concerns It is commonly believed that '6% of wells leak immediately, 50% of wells leak after some time and all wells will leak eventually'. This is not an issue specific to shale gas exploration and production, it is a concern with every well that is drilled. This originates from a document that sells solutions for this problem to oil and gas companies. This often relates to 'SCP', or Sustained Casing Pressure This is a 'well barrier' issue, but could also include casing 'integrity' (external) leaks. Regulation calls for baseline monitoring to determine if any leak issues are related to the drilled well.Preese Hall well report If a well were to leak, workover operations can usually fix leaks, by, for instance, perforating the casing above and below a poorly cemented zone, and 'squeezing' cement behind the pipe. The cement is drilled out and a pressure test is performed until pressure integrity is good. In 2013, data from DECC was released concerning offshore and onshore well leaks from operating and abandoned wells and of the approx 2000 onshore wells, and approx 6500 offshore wells, the number of reported leaks between and 2008 and 2013 was zero,{{clarifyreason=FOI states in the last five years, although there was a need for two well integrity repairs. Decc stated in the last five years:\\"As far as DECC OGED is aware, there have been no reports of leaks from abandoned wells in the last 5 years\\" In March 2014, ReFINE published a report that investigated well leak concerns, involving UK's producing, suspended, old, abandoned, and 'orphaned' wells. It included a large number of data sets, from around the world, including some very old well data. There are issues of 'well barrier', where an internal leak is found, that does not leak to the environment, and 'well integrity' where external leaking/venting is an issue. The data provided often puts the two data sets together. In the ReFINE abstract, the percentage of wells that have had some form of well barrier or integrity failure is highly variable (1.9% to 75%).The ReFINE report does also indicate that there is no meaningful data on the bulk of the land based wells, and that only the 143 producing wells have been examined. The industry trade and advocacy group UKOOG welcomed the ReFINE report, stating that well leaks in the UK were little problem, and contrasted the small number of orphan wells with the estimated 250,000 abandoned mines. Looking at the most recent results In a separate study of 3533 Pennsylvanian wells monitored between 2008 and 2011, there were 85 examples of cement or casing failures, 4 blowouts and 2 examples of gas venting. A November 2013 paper states Well-integrity failure occurs when all barriers fail and a leak is possible. True well-integrity failure rates are two to three orders of magnitude lower than single-barrier- failure rates.. Another paper from 2012 indicates that the bulk of the environment code violations in recent activity in Pennsylvania are nothing to do with well leaks.Environmental Impacts Consodine et al A research paper by Watson and Bachu from 2009 indicates: Low cement top or exposed casing was found to be the most important indicator for sustained casing vent flow (SCVF)or gas migration (GM)SCVF/GM. The effect of low or poor cement was evaluated on the basis of the location of the SCVF/GM compared to the cement top. The vast majority of SCVF/GM originates from formations not isolated by cement. The current regulations from the HSE are designed to mitigate these concerns, and seal wells back to the surface. Concern has been raised about some wells drilled before the latest guidelines that do have potential leak paths. An internal memo shows on page 3 that there is no cement from 1200 feet to the surface aquifer, and as such there is a potential leak path. If the casing were to leak due to corrosion or other reason, there would be a leak path from deep salty formations into the aquifer. In addition the aquifer is only protected by one layer of (uncemented) casing. Information from the US Groundwater Protection Council shows that there is a failure rate of around 1 every 3500 wells, or 0.03%.State Oil and Gas Agency Groundwater Investigations =Use of radioactive sources= There has been concern from anti-fracking activists about use of radioactive sources in wells. The difference between radiation dose and Radioactive contamination seems to be poorly understood. Well logs involving radioactive sources are a legal requirement. Political issues Shale gas development has brought with it various challenges for Britain's political parties. That is particularly the case for the Conservative Party, where there are tensions between the aspirations of the leadership – who tend to view shale gas in terms of economic benefit, energy independence, and a means of reducing carbon emissions – and the priorities of many of its supporters who are hostile to the process, especially those who live in areas likely to be explored for shale gas. The Liberal Democrats, in 2013 in a coalition government with the Conservative government which strongly supported shale gas development, began taking a position downplaying prospects for a \\"shale gas revolution\\", issuing several position papers on climate change which minimized the role of shale gas in favour of renewables. The Labour Party has been more reticent, but MPs have indicated they are receptive to shale gas development if environmental safeguards and an appropriate regulatory regime are in place. By contrast, UKIP is enthusiastic about shale gas development, a stance that is partly derived from its hostility to wind farms. The UK Green Party's energy policy EN264 states that: \\"We will halt the development of coal-bed methane, shale gas and similar hydrocarbon exploitation since it is not needed to meet UK energy demands, is environmentally destructive, and will lead to increasing GHG emissions\\". As of 2013 the government was solidly behind development of the fossil fuel shale gas industry and was offering to give shale gas companies favourable tax treatment for the unconventional energy source. Also they stated they would turn 100% of business tax proceeds over to local councils instead of the usual 50% which has been seen as controversial in some parts of the media.\\"Government accused of bribing local councils\\", The Independent. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said of the government's proposal to turn the business taxes gained from shale gas development over to the local councils: \\"It looks like the government is bribing local councils and it shows how desperate it is to get fracking accepted locally.\\" The House of Lords report \\"The Economic Impact on UK Energy Policy of Shale Gas and Oil\\" from the Economic Affairs Committee was published in May 2014.House of Lords report It took evidence on a wide variety of subjects from a wide variety of sources. It concludes that shale gas exploration and development should go ahead urgently, and that the regulatory regime was complex, and a hindrance to growth. In May 2014, the prospect of drilling under peoples homes was put out for consultation and the resulting report in October 2014 indicated that 99% of 40,000 responses were opposed to this.Govt response to consultation The Infrastructure bill, which became law in February 2015, included an amendment that this was to be permitted. The National Farmers Union issued this statement that indicated concerns with property prices, long term environmental issues and payment for access in line with other industries.Daily Telegraph and farmers The chemical firm Ineos has proposed that they would pay 6% of income in payments for local people, farmers, and landowners. Ineos chairman Jim Ratcliffe said \\"Giving 6% of revenues to those living above Britain's shale gas developments means the rewards will be fairly shared by everyone.\\" Friends of the Earth said this was a \\"transparent attempt to bribe communities\\" =Conflicts of interest= There have been a number of concerns raised regarding conflicts of interest between policy makers and financial links to shale gas development, notably: *Lord Browne of Cuadrilla - The former BP boss is chairman of Cuadrilla, which is exploring for shale gas in Lancashire and West Sussex. He is lead \\"non-executive\\" across Government. *Baroness Hogg - The non-executive for the Treasury sits on the board of BG Group, which has significant shale gas assets in the United States. *Sam Laidlaw - The non-executive to the Transport Department is also chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, which recently bought a 25 per cent stake in Cuadrilla's most promising shale gas prospect. *Ben Moxham - A former executive at BP when Lord Browne was at the helm, he followed the peer to Riverstone Holdings, which owns 42 per cent of Cuadrilla. Moxham was energy adviser at No 10 but quit in May 2013. *Lord Howell - George Osborne's father- in-law is also president of the British Institute of Economics, whose backers include BP and BG Group. *Viscount Ridley - The House of Lords Commissioner for Standards found that \\"Lord Ridley breached the Code of Conduct by not declaring his interests in Weir Group, whose activities include shale gas production, when speaking on the Energy Bill.\\" *House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs potential conflicts of interest with regards to shale gas development: *Baron Hollick: Has shares in Samson resources a US company with shale gas investments. *Lord Skidelsky: invested in Janus Capital who hold stakes in oil and gas firms *Lord Mcfall: Held investments in FTI consulting, fracking industry advisers *Baroness Noakes: had shares in at least 3 firms with interests in shale gas. *Lord MacGregor or John MacGregor as he was previously known is the current Chairman of 'The British Energy Pension Fund Trustees and Chairman, Eggborough Power Ltd Pension Fund Trustees, both now part of EDF Energy. CPRE Northumberland's Chairman David Montag-Smith is also chairman of the board of directors of Rathlin Energy Ltd who are exploring Yorkshire for shale gas. =Moratoria= In July 2014, the Scottish Government issued an Expert Scientific Panel Report on Unconventional Oil & Gas which investigated the technical, and environmental challenges of this technology. After the third reading of the Infrastructure bill in January 2015, Scotland imposed a moratorium, pending another environmental review. This prompted negative comment from the original report authors. The Welsh Government stated that applications from drilling companies must be referred to ministers from February 2015. \\"Planning applications for the exploration, appraisal, or extraction of unconventional oil and gas which would utilise unconventional techniques (including hydraulic fracturing) must be referred to the Welsh Ministers, where local planning authorities are minded to approve them\\" =Public opinion= Quarterly \\"Wave\\" polling, originally commissioned by DECC (now BEIS), has been monitoring public opinion on shale gas with its Energy and Climate Change Public Attitudes Tracker since Wave 8 (December 2013). The eighth wave showed 27% supported \\"extracting shale gas to generate the UK’s heat and electricity\\", while 21% opposed. As of Wave 20 (December 2016), that position has shifted with 18% supporting extraction of shale gas and 31% opposed. The University of Nottingham ‘Survey of Public Attitudes to Shale Gas Extraction in the UK’ has been running since March 2012. This series of polls shows that public support for the extraction and use of shale gas (from those who correctly identified shale gas in the gateway question), has fallen from a peak of 58.3% in July 2013 to just over 37.3% by the twelfth poll in October 2016. In the same time period opposition is shown as having grown from 18.8% to 41.1%. The October 2016 poll was \\"a milestone\\" according to its authors as for the first time a majority of respondents were opposed to its development in the UK. Moreover, across the survey there had been an increase in respondents associating shale gas with negative environmental impacts. As concerns about the environmental impacts of shale gas have increased the poll's authors say they have seen the UK public become less convinced of its benefits to the economy and the energy security of the UK. A survey by YouGov for Friends of the Earth, published in August 2016, found that 33% of people would support fracking in their local area if individual households received a payment of up to £10,000. According to the research, 43% said they would oppose fracking despite the payment and 25% said they didn't know. July 2016 Polling by ComRes for Remsol showed support for shale gas at 26% with opposition at 46%, with shale gas being the least popular energy source when compared to solar, onshore wind, nuclear, biomass and electricity storage. Both the 2016 YouGov and ComRes polling showed that while men in the UK were evenly divided about fracking, women were strongly against it; DECC/BEIS wave polling has shown that support for renewables has consistently been stronger than support for fracking, with support for on-shore wind having increased from 66% to 71% between Waves 1 and 19. A January 2014 Guardian poll found that a majority support shale gas extraction, but by a somewhat narrower margin than previously. To the question \\"Should shale gas extraction be allowed?\\" 53% said yes (down from 58% in July 2012), and 27% answered no (up from 19% in July 2012). A poll conducted by Opinium/Observer in August 2013 showed that while men in the UK were evenly divided about fracking taking place in their area, women were strongly against it; the population as a whole preferred renewables such as wind farms. An ICM poll in August 2013 found that public opinion in the UK was in favour of hydraulic fracturing in general, by 44% in favour to 30% opposed. However, when asked if they favoured hydraulic fracturing in their own area, the public split evenly, 40% in favour to 40% against. Support for fracking was stronger among men, older people, and conservatives.Fiona Harvey, \\"Fracking splits public opinion down the middle, poll finds\\", The Guardian, 13 August 2013.

History The house was built for Sir Astley Paston Cooper, a surgeon, who moved there in 1811. In around 1840 Cooper commissioned an iron bridge as part of the approach to the site. The house passed down the Paston- Cooper family until it became Gadebridge Park School in 1914. Although the site accommodated a temporary army camp during World War I, the house remained a school until 1963 when the school was forced out of its premises by the Commission for New Towns as part of its development of the new town. The house was demolished and Kodak built a Marketing Education Centre on the site: the centre was itself demolished in 1995 and the site is now used for housing.

When he was born, he was in line to receive the earldom of Guilford, since the current earl, Frederick North, 5th Earl of Guilford, had no son, and neither did Brownlow's uncle, Francis North. However, due to Brownlow's \\"youthful extravagances\\", Francis remarried on the death of his wife, and did have a son, thus denying Brownlow the earldom.

He lived for a while with his great uncle Frederick on Corfu, and fought with Dom Pedro's army in Portugal, before eventually settling in Scotland.Moody-Stuart, p. 10. North lived a life of pleasure, being fond of hunting and gambling, broken only by a period at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, when he considered taking holy orders. North experienced a religious conversion in November 1854, and began to attend Elgin Free Church. He proceeded to engage in public preaching. In 1859, he was appointed as an evangelist by the Free Church of Scotland.

Nonlinear Anal. 4 (1980), no. 4, 677–681. named after Haïm Brezis and Thierry Gallouët, is an inequality valid in 2 spatial dimensions. It shows that a function of two variables which is sufficiently smooth is (essentially) bounded, and provides an explicit bound, which depends only logarithmically on the second derivatives. It is useful in the study of partial differential equations. Let \\\\Omega\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^2 be the exterior or the interior of a bounded domain with regular boundary, or \\\\mathbb{R}^2 itself.

Olate Dogs (originally Olate Family's Dogs) is an American dog trick act featuring father-and-son trainers Richard and Nicholas Olate. The group won the seventh season (2012) of America's Got Talent, claiming the US$1,000,000 first prize. Richard Olate grew up in Santiago, Chile, where he adopted a stray dog and taught it tricks. He soon adopted more dogs and started a dog act. His brother Jose joined the act and the two caught the attention of a circus promoter. They came to America in 1989 and found success as part of Circus Vargas. Richard got married and eventually his wife Rebecca and son Nicholas joined the act. Olate Dogs performed in the Big Apple Circus and Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. They appeared in TV commercials and on multiple morning programs before becoming national stars on America's Got Talent. Subsequently, they have toured the country and performed during NBA halftimes. Olate Dogs features four different five-minute acts that include numerous tricks such as dogs jumping rope, going down slides, and riding scooters. The act also features a doggy conga line and a pooch that does back flips. Up to 10 of their 22 dogs perform during each show. Background Richard Olate is a third-generation circus performer who grew up in Santiago, Chile. The second youngest of 22 children, he grew up in poverty. As a young child, he found a stray dog in the street, adopted it, and began to teach it tricks. Soon he adopted two more dogs and trained them as well. By age 12, he was supporting his family with a dog act, performing in schools and small circuses. Richard's brother Jose joined the act and the duo caught the attention of circus promoters. In 1989, Richard and Jose Olate brought their act to the United States. That year, the Chicago Tribune described their Circus Vargas performance as \\"clever and comical\\". Shortly after coming to America, Richard Olate met Rebecca Smith, a circus performer who performed as a human cannonball. The two fell in love, despite speaking different languages, and got married. Rebecca gave up her act and began assisting with the dog act instead. Richard and Rebecca had three children. The older two Olate children returned to Chile, where Richard's daughter and her fiancé run a circus, and his older son works as a chef. His younger son, Nicholas, grew up with the dogs and became an integral part of the act at age 15. Nicholas Olate was hyperactive as a child, learning dance and tumbling at a young age. A dog prepares to ride a scooter during an Olate Dogs performance on February 16, 2013. While in Florida, a talent scout spotted the Olates and brought them to California. They worked in commercials and films, and performed for celebrities. Using mostly rescue dogs, the Olates continued to build up their act. To train his dogs, Richard uses imitative play and a lot of patience. He demonstrates the trick and then puts the dog into proper position over and over again. Eventually, the dog starts to try to emulate what Richard is doing. The Olates use physical and verbal cues to let the dogs know which trick to do. The family adopted an extra dog solely as a pet so that the performance dogs were not too distracted from casual play. In 2001, the Olate act, then called the Olate Family's Dogs appeared in the Big Apple Circus. They did a variety of tricks including walking on two legs, going down slides, pushing scooters, and jumping over hurdles. The New York Times called the act a crowd pleaser. In 2007, the Olate dog act was featured in the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, performing tricks such as jumping rope, riding a scooter, and doing a conga line. They have appeared on The Today Show and Live! With Regis and Kelly, winning a \\"Relly\\" award for favorite specialty performance on the latter. By 2012, Jose had left the act. Olate Dogs, based in Houston, Texas, have four distinct acts featuring a variety of tricks. The acts are about 5 minutes long and feature up to 10 dogs at a time. In total they have 22 dogs – 10 active and 12 either in training or retired. According to the Olates, the hardest trick is the back flip. America's Got Talent When the Olates were traveling in Orlando in 2012, they heard that America's Got Talent (AGT) was in town for auditions. Friends urged them to try out, but Richard Olate, then aged 55, thought it would just be a hassle and go nowhere. Nicholas, then 19, convinced his father to audition. The auditioning was difficult - the Olates had to carry the dogs everywhere - but was worth it when they got a standing ovation. Their dog act impressed the judges enough to be put them straight through into the top 48, bypassing Vegas week. Appearing in what was described as the \\"toughest quarterfinal\\" of AGT, Olate dogs finished in the top three of the public vote and moved on to the semifinals. In the semifinals, the act featured a dog riding a scooter, an all dog conga line, and the return of their back flipping poodle. A new dog, Bella, made her debut on the show doing a tumbling act with both trainers. The public vote placed Olate Dogs in the top two, sending them to the finals. In the finale of America's Got Talent, Olate Dogs began with a dog \\"driving\\" a car onstage. Other tricks included dogs walking on just their hind legs, jumping tricks, and back flips. With one of the dogs in her lap, judge Sharon Osbourne said she was watching \\"pure love on that stage\\" and said the act made her \\"so happy.\\" In her recap, Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times called Olate Dogs \\"the most talented puppies on the planet.\\" In the public vote, Olate Dogs finished first, beating out comedian Tom Cotter and musician William Close to claim the US$1,000,000 first prize. After America's Got Talent Olate Dogs headlined the America's Got Talent Live in Las Vegas stage show at The Palazzo Theatre in the fall of 2012 and again in early 2013. The 90-minute show featured a return of fan-favorite routines from AGT plus new routines and never before seen dogs. They appeared on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno on November 2. On the show, they did several jumping tricks, had three dogs ride a scooter, and performed a three dog conga line. One dog jumped rope on its hind legs and another did back flips. They concluded with the trainers doing a tumbling act with one of the dogs. From February through April 2013, Olate Dogs appeared in The America's Got Talent Live - All Star Tour, a cross-country tour featuring top acts from seasons six and seven. Subsequently, they performed during halftime of several NBA games. During the summer, they toured various county fairs. The son of Jose Olate, Juan, joined the act. Nicholas Olate is recording a music album \\"Think Big\\" to be released from Domo Records on October 8, 2013. On September 11, 2013, Olate Dogs returned to \\"America's Got Talent\\" as a guest performer during the Top 12 results show. They released their holiday album \\"The Olate Dogs' Christmas\\" from Domo Records on October 29, 2013. In 2014 Olate Dogs made their movie debut by starring in \\"Le Sauvetage (The Rescue)\\", a short film that premiered at the Sonoma International Film Festival, and selected for the Festival de Cannes Court Métrage. The film is a part of the #RescueFilm series, presented by Halo, Purely for Pets and created by Peter McEvilley to celebrate rescue pets and promote pet adoption. The series also include “Dog’s Best Friend” and “A Holiday Tail”. http://halopets.com/inside-halo-pets/key- programs/rescuefilm-series/ On Thanksgiving night of the same year, Olate Dogs performed on the TV special Fox’s Cause for Paws: An All-Star Dog Spectacular, which was co-hosted by Jane Lynch and Hilary Swank. During the program, celebrities such as Miranda Lambert, P!nk, Sharon Osbourne, Paula Abdul, and Betty White introduced adoptable dogs to viewers, providing them the opportunity to provide a new home. http://olatedogs.com/2014/11/foxs-cause- for-paws-an-all-star-dog-spectacular/ In December, Olate Dogs launched the ‘Holiday Rescue Tour’ and toured Northern California as they combined the dog’s tricks with Nicholas’ live music performance and comedy acts. They performed in Fresno, Salinas, Livermore, Sonoma, Healdsburg and Vacaville. To this day, the Olate Dogs continue to tour and perform at various venues throughout the country, including states such as Florida, Texas, Arizona, Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, California, and New York.

Early life and career Francis H. Cone was born on September 5, 1797, to Joshua Cone and Chloe Chapman in East Haddam, Connecticut. He graduated from Yale University in 1818, and subsequently moved to Greene County, Georgia to practice law. During this time, Cone came to know Alexander Stephens, who practiced law in nearby Taliaferro County. On January 8, 1829, Cone married Jane Williams Cook, a ward of US Senator William Crosby Dawson.Cone, p. 110 In 1841, Cone was elected Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia. Four years later, he was elected to the position once again. =Stephens assault= Alexander Stephens Like many other Democrats, in 1848, Cone became furious at the Whig politician Alexander Stephens for tabling the Clayton Compromise, and publicly denounced Stephens as a traitor to the South. When Stephens confronted Cone over this charge in August 1848, Cone discounted the rumors. However, Cone immediately regretted retracting his statements about Stephens. On August 26, Cone wrote a letter to Stephens demanding that Stephens apologize for the confrontation.Schott, pp. 87-92 In September, Cone encountered Stephens on the piazza of the Thompson's Hotel in Atlanta. Cone approached Stephens and again demanded that he apologize, to which Stephens responded coldly. Cone proceeded to verbally insult Stephens, and in response, Stephens struck Cone in the face with his walking cane. The enraged Cone drew a knife and started slashing at Stephens. As Stephens was extremely small in stature, Cone immediately gained the advantage in the fight. Cone was eventually pulled away from Stephens' body by a crowd of bystanders, but not before he had stabbed Stephens six times.Knight, pp. 38-39 Stephens was seriously wounded in the fight, and had to be immediately treated in the hotel. He was forced to stay in bed for several weeks, and never regained full use of his right hand. Despite these injuries, however, Stephens opted not to press charges against Cone, who later pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of stabbing and was fined eight hundred dollars.Schott, p. 93 Later life In 1856, Cone was elected State Senator of Georgia. He served three years before his death on May 18, 1859.

Personal life Mirta Toledo was born in the Almagro neighborhood of Buenos Aires. She is the oldest daughter of Toribio Toledo (Afro-Guarani) and Eva García Román (Spaniard). Since early childhood she was conscious of the ethnic diversity within her own family that later on influenced her artwork. Toledo cites her father as the driving force in her art, who \\"instilled in her qualities of strength, ambition and values, normally reserved for men in her society. = Marriage and family = In January 1977 Toledo married Dr. Mauricio R. Papini in Buenos Aires, Argentina. From 1980–82 they stayed in the United States in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where their sons were born (1981). They returned to Buenos Aires from 1982–1988, moved to Honolulu from 1988–1990, and then to Fort Worth, Texas from 1990–2000. In 2000 she moved to Austin, Texas where she continued working in her artwork and had solo shows. In 2007, Toledo returned to Buenos Aires where she currently resides and works.  Education  Toledo obtained a MFA in Visual Arts with a Major in Painting, from the National University of the Arts in 2011. In 1985 she completed a residency with master sculptor Antonio Pujía in the National College of Fine Arts Ernesto de la Cárcova. She earned a degree as a Professor of Painting (1974) and Professor of Sculpture (1982) from the National School of Fine Arts Prilidiano Pueyrredón, and a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts (Drawing) from the School of Fine Arts Manuel Belgrano (1973). Toledo completed two residencies specializing in hand-made fine art serigraphy at Coronado Studio in Austin,Texas: Serie Project V (1998) and Serie Project IX (2002). She also was an artist in residency at Stone Metal Press in San Antonio, Texas (2002). Toledo was a Class 2002 Alumni of the NALAC Leadership Institute of the National Association of Latino Arts and Cultures.  Artistic life  = Sculpture and pottery: 1977–93 = In the late 1970s she focused on sculpture, winning her first awards in that medium from the SAAP (Argentine Society of Visual Artists), the Ministry of Culture of Argentina, and the Dirección General de Educación Artística (1979). His father transmitted to her legends and beliefs of his culture and he was who awakened her love for art. Her themes and inspiration are often similar. The sculptures have indigenous faces, they are people who affirm her past, and they are the characters of hundreds of stories that he told her as a child. Her works affirm her ethnicity. In 1980 Toledo traveled to the United States for the first time. In 1982 she had her first Solo Show On Angels, Women and Machines at the North Star Gallery of the University of Minnesota in Saint Paul. With those works \\"she tried to express the transformations our world is passing through in three aspects of our everyday life experience: Religious, Humane and Technological and representing these aspects are the angels, women and machines\\". In 1982 she returned to Argentina, and continued working in sculpture, participating in numerous competitions and achieving awards. Toledo moved back to the United States to Honolulu, Hawaii in 1988 where she joined the Hawaii Potters' Guild working on both figurative sculpture and vessel- oriented raku pottery, the latter embellished with designs inspired by the indigenous people of her homeland. Before leaving Hawaii in 2002, she had a Solo Show From the Earth at Backus Gallery of Fine Arts. Toledo exhibited pottery and figurative sculptures that allows her more range in developing metaphorical potential. Busts of Pachamama, Coquena, Anahí, Sisa-Huinaj are appealing personifications of deities linked to various aspects of Earth's rhythms. Once established in Fort Worth, she continued working in pottery and sculpture for three more years, until she decided to devote herself entirely to painting. = \\"Pure Diversity\\": 1990–present = This series of paintings deepen in her belief that cultural differences are the \\"treasure of humanity\\". Pure diversity reflects the focus of the artist and shows her awareness of the ethnic, cultural and individual diversity within society and her own experience and heritage. Every society has its own characteristics, values and culture, but I feel that after the twentieth century, with the mass media invading our homes, the whole world has been exposed to \\"universal\\" values that we are learning and adopting not only as the truth, but also, as our own. There is not such a thing as \\"universal beauty\\", Toledo said. These works envision a society that is equal: \\"People tell me that I am an idealist, that I dream and I have hopes for a better society. I always said that it is my answer to the vision of a submissive Latin America and the assurance of seeing a diverse evolving world without racism\\". She approaches different themes to celebrate the difference among the world's society. Diversity in Religion (portraying gods and goddess from prehispanic Latin America, Caribbean, Africa and European saints). Pure Diversity: Children and Dolls (portraying the ethnic and cultural differences in between children´s and the reflection on the dolls created in their own society) and Pure Diversity: Flowers, Women and Birds ( portraying women from all over, symbolically using birds and flowers to give hidden messages about them). Toledo´s works attest to her identity and the identity of all those fragmented between two cultures, who have had to reconfigure their history on ongoing basis in order to incorporate new voices, while maintaining old voices, so they do not forget the origin of their trip. This series were displayed in Solo Shows at Texas Christian University and Texas Women's University. She gave invited conferences on her theme at several universities including Barnard College in New York (1995), the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1996), the University of Maryland at College Park (1995), TCU (1998) and Southwest Texas State University (2001). In such conferences her message was clear, that \\"diversity is a global phenomenon and the only hope and reality for the future\\". \\"Traveling through the paintings of Mirta Toledo is to enter into the celebration of diversity. As if it were a huge hug to a diversity present full of beauty, she is moving away from those fears and rejection that causes all the unknown, even if it is close to us. She is oblivious to the theories of racial purity, she questions the idea of \\"pure\\" as opposed to the \\"different\\". In 1997 she was awarded Estrella Award for Outstanding Hispanic Woman in the Arts, by the Hispanic Women's Network of Texas. In 2002 she had a Solo Show with her Pure Diversity: Children and Dolls at DiverseArts Little Gallery in Austin, Texas. The flavor of an open mind,Toledo believes that there's only one race, The Human Race, so, if you truly believe it, then you have to believe that the human race is pure diversity. Placing it in terms she was familiar with, she considered how multicultural her doll collection had become and how dolls were a common element in all societies, past and present. Pondering the whole idea gave birth to her signature theme, people and diversity, and to her series, children and dolls. \\"I try to show that there is hope and beauty,\\" she remarks. \\"We have to embrace ourselves as a human race, accept the way we are, and we are diverse. Since then, that theme has been the topic of Toledo's short stories and conferences, and it represents the intellectual level of her paintings during the past 14 years. Her dolls have assumed the role as ambassadors of diversity. Her art was on permanent display at Mi Casa Gallery, located in Austin's famous South Congress Cultural District. =\\"Track of Feelings\\": 1994–present = Reacting to the California Proposition 187, in 1994 Toledo created a mixed media triptych of big dimensions: \\"The Key Word is LOVE \\" (1994). The three canvasses presented glued and hand sewn collages of her drawings about Aztec, Mayan and African significant art, and the portrait of family members. There were also empty panels where immigrants were invited to write about their feelings and experiences in the country. This piece marked the beginning of the series Track of Feelings. In these works not only changes her approach to express the world´s daily historical events, but also her technique.The Colors in the paintings do not blend, but bleed. There is orange and there is blue and the ugly compromises we must make, the shades of meaning where people equivocate and bury the past, these things are not there. The moldy blending of hue is traded for sharp contrast, clarity, the exact point where night and day play shell games is now captured, again, in a reflection of what has collected in the brushes of Mirta Toledo. \\"No Outlet\\" (1997) is the footprint of the so common torture exerted by the military during Argentina's Dirty War. Silhouettes of men and women who once were alive but had no outlet. To the left of the canvas is glued a newspaper article where a woman related how she was tortured while a priest near her was praying. The red acrylic stroke left by the glued brush symbolizes the blood leaving and covering an Argentine ID ... and that human being disappears completely ... not even the person's name exists anymore. In a corner of the canvas a phrase reads: \\"I was full of life.\\" A shape. A shadow. The weight of memory. Also from 1997 is \\"Justice and Memory\\" referring to the AMIA bombings. This work shows colorful bodies silhouettes of men, women and children of all sizes and colors (made with the Mexican hand cut paper technique) glued to the canvas on a blood red background. There is also a color blue sky section, where a photograph of a black wall shows in white letters a claim: Justice and Memory, along with the list of victims of the attack. As falling from the black wall there are three signs of \\"Fragile\\" and, again, the black wall with white lettering claiming \\"Justice and Memory\\", and, below, a request: \\"Neither hypocrisy, nor complicity!\\" Toledo´s most complicated art adheres fabric, paper, stamps, news prints and the tools of artistic trade to multilevel paintings that contain references to social or political conditions. In \\"Lost Mail\\" (2000) she incorporates printings of her sister Claudia´s poem \\"Is Scary to Return\\" with postmarked mailings, framed in black, then blue, then brilliant orange. This series of artworks was first exhibited in the year 2000 at LanPeña Gallery in Austin, Texas. Many of the mixed media pieces were looking back from Argentina to Texas, with a developed visual vocabulary meriting a full \\"Retrospectiva\\". At the time of her Solo Show, Argentine filmmaker Jorge Coscia was visiting the US and did a documentary on Toledo's artwork: Lecciones de Vida: El arte de Mirta Toledo (October 2000). = Mail Art: 2007–present = Newly moved to Buenos Aires,Toledo began to work immediately in Mail Art. What it is Mail Art? It is essentially non commercial art sent out via the postal system. This art takes the form of envelopes, post cards and often 3-D objects, anything that makes it through the mail. Mail Art is International, with an extensive network of people involved in this compelling form of artistic communication. Mail Art is also democratic and nonjudgmental. Her first participation was in October 2007 in the call: TeeToTuM 1st. International Art Exhibition \\"The Philosophy Day\\". Her painting Tatina Cori was exhibited in the Art Space Vlassis, in Thessaloniki, Greece. Continuing with her diversity theme, she sent two portraits to the Zadarama 2008 call: Cutzalán Woman and African American Teenager. Those were exhibited at Ceske Budejovice International Art Festival in Zadar, Croatia. In the same line of her paintings and drawings about the women murdered with impunity in Juarez, Toledo answered a call about the \\"Elimination of Violence Against Women\\" participating with four artworks: I hit you because I love you, say the abusers, Elimination of Violence Against Women's Stamps, Mother of Juarez Limited Edition Stamp Collection and a Stop Violence Envelope. The exhibition took place at the Technological Educational Institute of Central Macedonia in November 2008. Her paintings investigate the enigma of the self, propose possible worlds, and questions the complex situation of women's in today's world. How do women see themselves? And how do others view them from childhood? Thus, a range of women seem to look back at the spectators asking, \\"What do you see when you look at us?\\" Toledo has participated with her Mail Art in Australia, Brazil, Belgium, Bangladesh, Canada, Colombia, Chile, Finland, Hawaii, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Portugal, Spain, Ukraine and the United States. In May 2008, Raices Culturales Latinoamericanas (in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) invited Toledo to have a Solo Show. With the body of artwork that she called ...with the letter M, she conveys her message of the 90's: Art is a magical tool that I use ... We, humans, do not see what is beyond the simple things, not with a pure look. What I see beyond these beliefs full of prejudice are my motivation... And the message of my work is fighting for the tolerance of diversity. The same year, during the months of September and October, the LatinArt Gallery of Philadelphia (now closed) inaugurated its art rooms with a solo exhibition of Mirta Toledo, displaying a retrospective of her work, which includes paintings, sculptures and mixed media. In 2011 her print The tree of life: portrait of my parents was featured in Arte Tejano: de campos, barrios y fronteras an exhibit at OSDE Espacio de Arte (sponsored by the U.S. Embassy in Argentina together with The Smithsonian Latino Center and Fundación OSDE). This exhibition was curated by Cesáreo Moreno. = Invisible Argentine Heroes of African Descendants: 2012– present = True to her celebration of diversity, Toledo painted a series of portraits of Argentine of African descendants who, even though contributed in many fields to the making of the nation, were invisible by the Argentina history. Sponsored by IARPIDI, this set of portraits of over twenty African descendants Argentinian Heroes are part of a traveling exhibition that began in the Golden Hall of the House of Culture (2013) and has exhibited in five Districts of Buenos Aires City ever since (2014). This art presentation also crossed the borders of the Federal Capital of Argentina to show in the Art Gallery of the Honorable Council of San Isidro. Dr. Carlos Castellano, (President of the HCSI) expressed his view: To tell you the truth, is a beautiful project that shows the African roots in Argentina, part of a story that unfortunately has been lost for many reasons. Argentina´s history itself has a lot to do with it: the many wars for our independence and wars against adjacent countries which are like brothers, like Paraguay. On those wars many African descendants lost their lives. But besides, this is also great because show us portraits of artists as Salgán, and heroes as Rivadavia. Essentially this exhibit seeks to work in this so important for democracy that is the process of cultural integration.  Writing  Mirta Toledo started to send her manuscripts to literary magazines in 1990, while living in Fort Worth, Texas. Even though she always has focused on her career as a visual artist, never stop writing and publishing. Her first book is a novel, La Semilla Elemental (1993). In this book Toledo addresses issues of continued relevance, related to the search for identity and lost blood line of ancestors. The characters are experiencing the anguish and agony of a painful transplant, and they hear the urgent call of the ancestral voice, the impulse to shake the dust of the generations that hides their true Hispanic / Latin American root. Every story present here speaks about two cultures colliding, found with one goal: domination. The arrival of the conqueror, powers, rights, relations with the inhabitants of the New World, mutual respect, ignorance, neglect, disaster, are some of the peaks on these stories. It is largely a work of denunciation. With the perspective that only the distance can provide, the author makes a deep look into her national and personal wealth: miscegenation. Spanish blood mixed with Guarani Indians and Blacks, the \\"new mud\\" in which the protagonist of the epilogue (written, unlike the all novel, in first person) discover \\"the elementary seed.\\" Her short story Jacinto (about the forced disappearance) was chosen to be a part of the Historia de Mujeres, I Antología (1994). Mirta Toledo, sculptor and painter casually tells us something terrible in her \\"Jacinto\\". Her ability to lead us to the unexpected end, speaks volumes in favor of her good fabulating and exquisite connoisseur of individual psychologies, like Ana Lía Gabelli, whose inquiries and particularly her special fondness will result in an area of difficult outlet. Eleven of her short stories (previously published in literary magazines of Canada, United States, Brazil and Argentina) came together in the book Dulce de Leche (1996). The introit of Dulce de Leche is a clear warning to the reader, in which a painful awareness slips to cultural crossroads: \\"The letters that fail to arrive, is because they do not write, because for my family and friends, I'm just an absence, a memory that does not belong to Buenos Aires anymore ...\\" The pain of being uprooted in a preliminary catharsis, the one of Mirta Toledo, Argentine narrator, that is \\"in between\\" , between her current life in Texas and her own memories. To put it more precisely, memories that are the treasure of her writing, provided with a poetic imagination convener. In 1996 A Century After, one of her short stories, was a finalist of the VIII Award Ana María Matute. In her stories most of the characters are marginal, like Juancito, a boy from a slum (Magic Slips); or Griselda, living between marginalization and the look of a compassionate eye (The Hunchback); or the child who writes with his left hand and traumatizes his father who considered that hand \\"evil\\" (The left hand). But the story that was published more times in different countries (Argentina, Canada, United States and Spain) is In Between. Written in Spanish (but with the original title in English) since 1999 is a part of every edition of the Spanish Instructor Manual ¡A que sí! In Between was also translated into English, and together with The Hunchback is part of the book Cruel Fictions, Cruel Realities, Short Stories by Latinamerican Women Writers, edited and translated by Kathy Leonard (1997). Chamamé in the air (the only story for children that wrote so far), was published in 2006 in Saltimbanqui3 El libro de los sueños, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. As she has done it with Mail Art, Toledo responded to the Second International Call Women Cry, in tribute to women and against violence. Nearly six hundred Spanish speaking women poets from more than twenty countries submitted their poems for the Second Call for International Women Poets in honor of the International Poetry Festival of Women Cry performed worldwide by Women Poets International Movement (MPI) INC. Some three hundred voices were selected, Mirta Toledo, with her poem \\"...with the letter M\\" was one of them. This call was developed in conjunction by the Library of Great Nations run by Xabier Susperregi Gutiérrez and Women Poets International. The two organizations together edited the book Ecos del grito – Volume I.

As a two-year-old he won the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot by six lengths and then won the Futurity Stakes, before going on to record his first Group 1 win in the Dewhurst Stakes. In his first run as a three-year-old he finished down the field in the 2000 Guineas. He was subsequently beaten in two other Group One races as a three-year-old before being retired to stud where he has proved a successful young sire. In his racing career he was trained by Aidan O'Brien and owned by Joseph Allen, Mrs John Magnier, Michael Tabor and Derrick Smith. Background War Command is a bay colt with a white star bred by Joseph Allen and foaled on 27 April 2011. He was sired by War Front who won the Alfred G. Vanderbilt Handicap in 2006. Since retiring he has also sired Queen Anne and International Stakes winner Declaration of War, Del Mar Oaks winner Summer Soiree and Malibu Stakes winner The Factor. War Command's dam is Wandering Star, a daughter of Red Ransom, who won the Atalanta Stakes and E. P. Taylor Stakes in 1996. The colt is trained by Aidan O'Brien. Racing career =2013: Two-year-old season= War Command's first start came on 7 June 2013 in a seven-furlong maiden race at Leopardstown, which he won by a neck from the pre-race favourite Intensified. Eleven days later War Command travelled to Royal Ascot for the Coventry Stakes. He was an outsider for the race and started at the price of 20/1, with his trained Aidan O'Brien also having two more fancied runners in the colts Stubbs and Sir John Hawkins. War Command's jockey Seamie Heffernan, held him up near the rear of the field in the early stages of the race, before moving closer to the leaders with two furlongs left to run. He took the lead with over one furlong before the finish and pulled clear to win by six lengths from Parbold. War Command's stable-mate Sir John Hawkins finished three quarters of a length behind Parbold in third place. After the performance he was priced as short as 5/1 for the 2014 running of the 2000 Guineas Stakes. War Command then stepped up to Group 1 level for the Phoenix Stakes at The Curragh. He started as the 2/5 favourite of the field of five. Ridden by Joseph O'Brien, he could only manage to finish third, one length behind winner Sudirman. War Command returned to The Curragh on 24 August for the Futurity Stakes. After again starting as an odds-on favourite he took the lead inside the final furlong and pulled clear to win by three lengths from Mustajeeb. On 12 October, War Command was sent back to England to contest Britain's most prestigious two- year-old race, the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. Ridden by Joseph O'Brien, he started the 10/11 favourite against a field which included the July Stakes winner Anjaal and the Champagne Stakes winner Outstrip. He raced behind the leaders before taking the lead a furlong from the finish and winning by one and a quarter lengths from the 20/1 outsider Cable Bay. In November, War Command was narrowly defeated by Kingston Hill in the voting for Champion Two-year-old Colt at the Cartier Racing Awards. =2014: Three-year-old season= War Command began his three year old season in the 2000 Guineas in which he was ridden by Ryan Moore. He entered the race at odds of 8/1 and could only finish ninth of the fourteen runners five and a quarter lengths behind 40/1 winner, Night of Thunder. His next engagement was the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot, in which he finished fourth behind Kingman, Night of Thunder and Outstrip. In July he was matched against older horses for the first time in the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlong at Sandown Park Racecourse. Starting at odds of 8/1 he finished seventh of the nine runners behind the five-year-old Mukhadram.

The house remains in the ownership of the Halsey Family. History The land upon which the Golden Parsonage sits, was once a part of the King's Langley Priory, having been owned on the Orders behalf by the Prioress of Dartford. Part of this land was farmed by John Halsey who tenanted at the site from 1520 onwards. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the Priory closed and the land passed to The Crown. In 1544, the land was purchased for £174 13s 4d by William Halsey, John's son. The land was subsequently passed down the Halsey family. One of John's descendants, Thomas Halsey emigrated to Southampton, New York and in 1660 built Halsey House. Halsey House now stands as a museum and is one of the oldest buildings in New York. The Golden Parsonage as it now stands is credited to Thomas Halsey (1655-1715), a Tory Member of Parliament for Hertfordshire, having been built in 1705. Thomas was married Anne, the daughter of noted alchemist, statesman and co-founder of the Royal Society, Thomas Henshaw. The avenue of Lime Trees was planted by Thomas's son, Henshaw Halsey, a monument for whom stands in St John the Baptish Church in Great Gaddesden, created by Flemish Sculptor John Michael Rysbrack. In 1768, Thomas Halsey feeling that the Golden Parsonage was out of date, commissioned James Wyatt to design and build a new seat for the Halsey family in the style of a Palladian Villa. This would become Gaddesden Place. The family would live in Gaddesden Place until 1950, when Sir Thomas Halsey would return the family to the Golden Parsonage. Further alterations to the Parsonage would be made in 1869, when Frederick Halsey would build a Billiard room. With the Halsey family living at Gaddesden Place, the Golden Parsonage was used for other purposes. Most notably for sixty years starting in 1875, the house served as a boys prep school, of which Thomas J. Bata was a notable student.Thomas J. Bata. Bata: Shoemaker to the World, page 18. pub.

During his seven years in the insurance industry, he was promoted to manager. He was in his early 30s when he started teaching a night class to aspiring insurance agents, and realized that he really wanted to teach. Gamble enrolled again at Fresno State, and began to pursue a degree in law. But he switched to linguistics, and received a master's degree in 1971. By this time, Gamble had married and had children. He continued with his education and obtained a Ph.D. in linguistics from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1975. His specialty was Native American languages. Early academic career After receiving his doctorate, Gamble served as a Fellow at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., for a year. He then obtained a full-time teaching position in 1976 at Washington State University (WSU) in Pullman, Washington. He taught in the anthropology department for the next 12 years. Gamble was appointed interim vice provost for academic affairs at WSU in 1987. He was appointed to the job permanently in 1988, where he oversaw budgetary and personnel matters, planning, and implementation. One of his achievements as vice provost was to integrate WSU's satellite campuses more closely with the main campus. Gamble left WSU in 1998 to accept a position as provost and senior vice president at the University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont.Anez, Bob. \\"Gamble Named New MSU President.\\" Associated Press.

Gamble says that he was not sought out for the job. Rather, he applied for the position after friends and colleagues urged him to do so. Gamble was named the 11th president of Montana State University on October 5, 2000. More than 60 applicants sought the position. Gamble won the job over two other finalists — Dr. Larry Branen, Dean of the School of Agriculture at the University of Idaho, and Dr. Ann Weaver Hart, provost and vice president at Claremont Graduate University. (Dr. Hart was subsequently named the president of Temple University and is currently the president of the University of Arizona.) The vote to select Gamble was unanimous. Gamble's starting salary was $133,000 a year, and he assumed his position as president on December 1, 2000. =Achievements= Gamble was president of MSU from 2000 to 2009. Gamble's presidency was marked by openness and a consultative style of governance. He made it a goal to interact with faculty, staff, workers, and students as much as possible, and maintained an \\"open door\\" policy that permitted almost anyone to make an appointment to see him. He also doubled the size of the president's executive council to make it more representative. He assigned the university provost to attend the weekly Faculty Senate meetings , and met privately with faculty and administrative leaders about governance issues on a weekly basis. He established a new 25-member University Planning, Budget and Analysis Committee to establish the university budget, and made its deliberations and decisions accessible to the media. Gamble laid down one budgetary rule, however: The university would not initiate projects without having the money in-hand to complete them. Gamble also sought to turn Montana State University into a research university. He encouraged faculty to conduct research and to apply for federal research grants, and the school actively sought out federal research money to renovate campus buildings. This effort was largely successful: Between 2000 and 2009, federal research funding at MSU grew by 61 percent to $98.4 million. In 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009, MSU was the only university in Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming to be classified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as having \\"very high research activity\\" — putting Montana State among such elite institutions as Harvard University, Johns Hopkins University, Oregon State University, the University of Washington. and Yale University.\\"MSU Has Record Enrollment.\\" Big Sky Business Journal. October 6, 2009. Accessed 2013-08-10. Gamble also pressed for the university to be designated the \\"University of the Yellowstone\\" to reflect the high level of research MSU conducted in the greater Yellowstone National Park ecosystem. The university applied for a trademark on the name, and Gamble worked to establish and enlarge the Big Sky Institute in Big Sky, Montana (an interdisciplinary research and public outreach institute).Schontzler, Gail. \\"Montana State Eyes Profile as University for Yellowstone Region.\\" Bozeman Daily Chronicle. August 15, 2007.The Big Sky Institute did not survive past Gamble's presidency. MSU shut it down in late 2011. See: Allen, Tyler. \\"What Happened to the Big Sky Institute?\\" Explore Big Sky. December 15, 2012. Accessed 2013-08-10. Gamble made enhancement of diversity a major effort of his presidency. The university lost a 1974 gender discrimination lawsuit brought by female faculty members. Gamble sought out women for leadership training activities, and encouraged their promotion within the university hierarchy. He appointed Cathy Conover to be vice president for communications and public affairs — making her the university's first permanent female vice president. By the time of his retirement, women outnumbered men among MSU's deans by five to four. Gamble also sought to integrate tribal colleges into MSU's teaching and governance structure as well. He appointed Dr. Henrietta Mann (chair of the MSU Department of Native American Studies) as a special assistant to the president's office. He also made Dr. Mann (one of the most prominent Indian educators in the United States) his personal representative to the seven tribal colleges which participate in the Montana University System.On July 1, 1994, Montana restructured the Montana University System. Eastern Montana College in Billings, Montana Northern College in Havre, and the Vocational- Technical Center in Great Falls lost their independence and were made satellite campuses of Montana State University. Although Montana's seven tribal colleges remained independent (as they are sponsored by sovereign nations), the state required them to integrate their teaching, operations, and academic operations with both Montana State University and the University of Montana in order to continue to receive state funding. Gamble also created a Council of Elders to bring leaders of the tribal colleges together twice a year at MSU to discuss governance, academics, funding, and integration issues. Native American enrollment at MSU rose 79 percent (to a historic high of 377 students) during Gamble's time in office. Legislatively, Gamble adopted an approach whereby university officials promoted MSU's accomplishments, praised legislators for their financial support (even when it was not forthcoming), and spoke of state funding for the university in terms of investment that led to economic and job growth. According to Conover, MSU's chief legislative lobbyist, Gamble's style was \\"a sea change\\" that led the Republican-dominated state legislature to rave about him. Montana State University also implemented the \\"Core 2.0 curriculum\\" during Gamble's tenure as president. This program encourages undergraduate students to engage in research or practice their art prior to graduation. Gamble also started a new tradition for the university president. Known as \\"Move-In Day\\", the president and other volunteers spend the first day of school helping students move into their dorm rooms. =Sports scandal= In 2006, a major sports scandal engulfed Montana State University. MSU hired successful football coach Mike Kramer away from Eastern Washington University in 2000. By 2002, Kramer's Bobcats football squad was tied for first in its league and made it to the NCAA Division I-AA first round playoffs. Kramer's team succeeded in tying again for first in its league and making the playoffs in 2003, tied for first in its league again in 2005, and tied for second place in its league and made it to the NCAA Division I quarterfinal playoffs in 2006. By most measures, Kramer was a highly successful football coach. On June 23, 2006, however, the body of local Bozeman man Jason Wright was discovered lying in an MSU experimental agricultural field on the edge of the MSU campus. He'd been kidnapped, beaten with a blunt object, and shot 10 times. Seven days later, former MSU basketball player Branden Miller and former MSU football player John LeBrum were charged with Wright's murder.Miller played basketball for MSU from 2004 to 2005. Lebrum played football for MSU in the fall of 2003.Ewan, Jeremy. \\"Wright Murder: Many Hands Helped Break Case.\\" Belgrade News. July 4, 2006.

Wright, a known cocaine dealer, was believed to have been murdered for drug-related reasons. After an 18-month investigation, six additional current and former MSU athletes — including former basketball player Aaron Rich, former football cornerback Andre Fuller, and former football wide receiver Rick Gatewood — were charged with buying and selling cocaine. Three of the six were charged with running a cocaine smuggling ring that sold of cocaine in Bozeman between June 2005 to May 2007. Court records later revealed that the murder weapon was stashed in a locker in an MSU gymnasium, leading investigators to question whether the killers had help from current MSU staff or students. As the investigation deepened, a former MSU assistant basketball coach admitted that he knew Miller had carried handguns in his athletic bag at school, that Miller was using Wright's identity card, and that Miller had secreted the murder weapon and other handguns in Brick Breeden Fieldhouse.\\"Montana State President to Respond to Murder Crisis.\\" Associated Press.

Montana State University, once nicknamed \\"Moo U.\\" for its agricultural focus, was now being called \\"Murder U.\\" The crimes committed by the student-athletes led to an automatic, routine investigation by the NCAA. The NCAA found no recruiting violations by the school, although it cautioned that many recruiting practices were lax. However, the investigation revealed significantly lower graduation rates for MSU football and basketball players under football coach Mike Kramer as well as men's basketball coach Mick Durham, and a large number of athletes on or flirting with academic probation.\\"Former Montana State Head Coach Mike Kramer in Hot Water at Idaho State.\\" Bozeman Daily Chronicle.

In 2009, Gamble said his hardest time as president was dealing with the sports scandal. =Criticisms= Gamble's tenure as president was not without criticism. Faculty members Ed Mooney and Gary Harkin argue that Gamble's focus on research led to increased costs for undergraduates and less focus on high-quality undergraduate teaching. An internal university \\"report card\\", created by Gamble, showed that faculty and administrative fell under Gamble fell to just 78 and 73 percent, respectively, of the national average for like-sized universities. When he retired, Gamble admitted that he failed to achieve some goals. These included launching the MSU Foundation's $100 million capital fundraising campaign, and raising $8 million to build a Native American Student Center. Post-MSU activities Geoff Gamble was 58 years old when he was appointed president of Montana State University. Gamble and his wife, the former Patricia Moneyhan, decided before accepting the position that Gamble would retire in 2009 at the age of 67.\\"MSU President Announces Plans for Retirement.\\" MSU News Service.

Two endowments were made. One was the Florence and Monty Moneyhan Scholarship Endowment, created in honor of Patricia Gamble's parents. The other was an endowment for the Geoff and Patricia Gamble Center for Student Success. The center will assist students in learning habits and skills that will keep them in school as well as provide training to faculty to improve the quality of teaching. The two endowments totaled more than $2 million, and were called \\"unprecedented\\" for an MSU president. The Gambles attributed their wealth to the highly successful insurance career Geoff Gamble had in the 1970s, a lifetime of saving, and prudent investments. In October 2010, the Gambles announced a $1 million gift to California State University, Fresno. One part of the gift will endow the Dr. Geoffrey and Patricia Gamble Professorship in Linguistics/Endangered Languages. The other part will establish the Dr. Geoffrey and Patricia Gamble Endangered Languages Program Endowment, which will provide financial support to scholars studying languages in danger of disappearing.

The church is in the ecclesiastical parish of Borley and Liston, one of the Fifteen Churches of the North Hinckford Benefice in the Diocese of Chelmsford of the Church of England. The church is a Grade I Listed building, notable for its topiary walk and a large monument to Sir Edward Waldegrave (a member of Mary I of England's privy council) and his wife. Description and history The church (dedication unknown) is a small building of stone; the nave may date to the 11th century. Later renovations have resulted in the mainly perpendicular style of the mid-14th to 16th centuries, still visible in the chancel and the western tower. The church as it now stands consists of chancel, nave, south porch and a crenellated western tower containing three bells, two of which were cast by Alfred Bowell of Ipswich in 1926, and one from 1574 cast by S II Tonni. They hang in their original oak frame with evidence a fourth bell may once have been present. There is a topiary walk leading to the porch, with bushes once shaped like Indian chess pieces. The path use to be flag stones, however as of 2017 a new brick, wheelchair friendly path has been installed with side lights. It is designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. Grade I is the highest of the three grades of listing, granted to buildings that \\"are of exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important\\". Not long after 1545 the manor was granted to Sir Edward Waldegrave (knighted in 1553 at the coronation of Queen Mary, died in the Tower of London on 1 September 1561) by Henry VIII. After the death of Edward, he was admitted to Queen Mary's privy council and granted the manor of Navestock, where he moved the family seat. In addition Waldegrave was Master of the Wardrobe for Queen Mary and her husband, Philip II of Spain. The chancel contains a monument to John Durham of Norfolk. Several tombs of the Waldegrave family are found within the structure, including a monument 14 feet high, 9 feet long, and 5 feet wide, with a cornice supported by six pillars of the Corinthian order, beneath which lie full-length marble figures of Sir Edward Waldegrave and his wife Lady Frances Waldegrave née Neville (died 1599). Both tombs bear a marginal inscription in Latin and a record of other alliances of this family. On the chancel's north wall is a devotional statue of Magdala Southcote, Walgrave's daughter, who died 8 September 1598 (Nikolaus Pevsner notes it, but calls it \\"not good\\"). The church contains memorials to two 19th-century rectors, John Philip Herringham and his son William Herringham. John Philip was a Pembroke graduate and one of the signees of a declaration protesting the Maynooth Grant in 1845; William entered Peterhouse, Cambridge. The glebe was in the mid-19th century; in both 1821 and 1831 the parish had 195 inhabitants.

His arrangements of traditional hymns continue to be popular in the Christian community, with favourities including his arrangements of 'Londonderry Air' and 'Blaenwern' ('Love Divine All Loves Excelling'). These arrangements use alternative and sometimes surprising chords to adjust the music and emphasise the emotional quality of certain words or themes. He is also the composer of the well-known hymn tune 'Old Yeavering'- written for Michael Perry's 'Like a Mighty River Flowing', and several widely-adopted arrangements of popular hymns including 'A Purple Robe' by Timothy Dudley-Smith.

Angus, \\"Technique and enlightenment: Limits of instrumental reason\\" (Book Review),\\" Husserl Studies, Vol. 3 (3) (January 1986):245-246. His subsequent work branched into a wider conception of the problem of modernity in critical engagement with discourse theory, post-structuralism, and rhetorical theory. In Primal Scenes of Communication (2000) \\"the complex linguistic model Angus has created regards the immanent link of identity creation involved in communication theories, but ... his concerns deal with this struggle for, and the shaping of, our faculties of attention.\\"Norman Madarasz, \\"Delivering our Attention: Ian Angus’ Primal Scenes of Communication,\\" Symposium: Journal of the Canadian Society for Hermeneutics and Postmodern Thought, Vol. V, no. 2 (Fall 2001): 256-7. = Canadian social philosophy = Angus' commitment to Canadian social and political thought was a consequence of his estimation in the 1970s that the left wing of Canadian nationalism contained the possibility for a transformation of Canadian society in a more egalitarian direction. In his most influential book in the area of Canadian studies, A Border Within (1997), he works toward thinking English Canadian identity in relation to internal diversity and environmental-local embeddedness. He does so by exploring the question: \\"What are the possibilities for an English-Canadian national identity in an age of corporate globalization- a phenomenon that appears to undermine national identities around the world?\\" Angus rejects the tendency to wholly situate identity as simply constructed locally or universally, but instead maintains that it is in the very acknowledgement of otherness, both environmental and ethnic, that an English Canadian identity could be rethought.Thomas Dunk, \\"National Culture, Political Economy and Socio-Cultural Anthropology in English Canada,\\" Anthropologica, Vol.42, No. 2 (2000): 131-145. His subsequent book Identity and Justice (2008) traces political thought and cultural politics insofar as they are integrated into philosophy. \\"It is not a book about Canadian philosophy, but rather a philosophical book that self-consciously situates itself in a particular place, in order to talk about this place.\\"Graeme Nicholson, \\"Review of Identity and Justice by Ian Angus,\\" Modern Horizons June 20, (2012), http://www.modernhorizonsjournal.ca/June%202012.html In 2013, Angus published a collection of essays on Canada under the title The Undiscovered Country: Essays in Canadian Intellectual Culture through Athabasca University Press in which he collected together his critiques of Canadian thinkers and emphasized that a philosophy which does not criticize empire becomes ideology. = Love the Questions = Angus' work on the university draws on years of activism and public deliberation on the issues surrounding it.Maria Guglietti. \\"The University and a New Definition of Enlightenment,\\" Topia 28 (2012): 306. He applies philosophical critique on an institutional level. This allows him to examine the transformation of knowledge as it relates to the external pressures of network capitalism and technoscience.A selection from Chapter 6, \\"The Transformation of Knowledge,\\" was printed in Truthout Magazine under the title, \\"Does the University Have a Future in Network Society?\\" (http://archive.truthout.org/does-university-have-a-future-network- society58477 The contemporary university can be defined by \\"three separate questions focusing on teaching, research and application, and technological change.\\"Bob Hanke. \\"Ian Angus in Conversation with Bob Hanke,\\" Canadian Journal of Media Studies Vol. 7 June (2010): 1-16. Maria Victoria Guglietti's review explains that \\"the transmission of knowledge...undermines enlightenment because it discourages any enquiry into the nature and limits of knowledge.\\"Maria Guglietti. \\"The University and a New Definition of Enlightenment,\\" Topia 28 (2012): 307. This amounts to the university losing its \\"critical and self reflexive role\\"Alan Bourke. \\"Review of Ian Angus. Love the Questions: University Education and Enlightenment,\\" Canadian Journal of Sociology On-Line Vol. 35 No. 3 (2010): 2. because its main purpose is to feed the specific needs of the larger system. This corporate arrangement of the university produces an anxiety as it relates to self-knowledge because of the explicit integration of education into the commodity form. Angus concludes with a realistic but hopeful analysis of the possibilities for the construction of new forms of enlightenment within the university. Though his work is primarily on the Canadian university, it has been widely praised for its applicability to the situation in the UK and US.

Gomez teased a preview of the song in her official YouTube account on July 15, 2013 but the full song was leaked with the rest of the album a few days before. The song was written by Peter Thomas and Bebe Rexha, along with Australian duo Daniel James and Leah Haywood, who handled production and the vocal production under their stage name Dreamlab and Thomas co-produced the track. The song has writing credits of 1995 Buju Banton's song \\"Champion\\" in the name of Mark Myrie and Leroy Sibbles. Driven to create a unique sound for herself, the singer focused on the song production of the song, being an uptempo dancehall track, along with influences of funk, reggae, jamaican music and soca. The production features a Bajan accent on Selena vocals, an islandy feel and a Latin percussive beats. The track is a self-empowerment anthem that contains reflections of \\"living the moment\\" and of self-confidence. \\"Like a Champion\\" received by music critics, many comparisons to the works of Rihanna. The track is the third song to be performed on the Stars Dance Tour.  Background  After the end of the When the Sun Goes Down era, Gomez announced that she would pause her musical career to focus on her film roles. After that, the singer confirmed the end of the band Selena Gomez & the Scene, after three studio albums. Gomez announced in October 2012 that she had started the preparation of her new album. Gomez invited various producers including Leah Haywood and Daniel James from the Australian production team Dreamlab, who produced “Hit the Lights” for Selena's early band, to work on new material for her new album. They produced about six tracks including “Write Your Name”, “Music Feels Better” and “Like a Champion”, the last being the first track to be produced by them. On June 3, 2013, the singer participated in a live chat promoted by YouTube, which revealed that the album would be titled Stars Dance and its release date, as well as talk about the songs of the record; about \\"Like a Champion\\" Gomez said \\"being able to travel is one of my favorite parts of my job, because I get to see beautiful places [...] I get to hear new music and new sounds and I toured South America which was incredible and beautiful and I kinda got this islandy feel when I was there, so I wanted to put that kinda vibe into this album and I didn't know how to do it and I heard this song called \\"Like a Champion\\" [...] I wanna make sure that it kinda had a little bit almost a Spanish but a little bit of reggae style [...] makes you definitely going to make you feel like you want to go to Jamaica or South America\\". A week before the record hit stores, the artist unveiled previews of all the songs on the album on her channel. \\"Stars Dance\\" could be heard in its full version by the public on July 16, 2013, the date which the album was released to be listened on iTunes Store.  Recording and composition  \\"Like a Champion\\" was written by Bebe Rexha (pictured). Firstly, Bebe Rexha recorded a demo of the song, which was originally produced by Peter Thomas and written by Rexha and Thomas; after that, Thomas gave the song to Dreamlab and they played for Gomez. Selena liked the song and it was re-written and re-produced by Dreamlab. At the end, \\"Like a Champion\\" was credited with Daniel James, Leah Haywood, Peter Thomas, Bebe Rexha, Mark Myrie and Leroy Sibbles as the songwriters of the song, Dreamlab was credited as the producer and the vocal producer and Peter Thomas as a co-producer. Rob Ghost and Simon French were the assistant engineers while Joe Pringle was the studio assistant. The song's recording sessions took place at Dreamlab Studios and at Glenwood Studios in Los Angeles and it was mixed at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach by Serban Ghenea and John Hanes served as the mix engineer. Finally, the track was mastered in Sterling Sound at New York City by Chris Gehringer. \\"Like a Champion\\" is an uptempo dancehall song with influences of funk, jamaican music, reggae and soca music that lasts for a total of two minutes and fifty- five seconds. The song is composed in the key of C major and features a moderate tempo of 90 beats per minute. Gomez's vocal range spans from the low tone of G3 to the high note of G4. The song opens with a sample of Buju Banton 1995 song \\"Champion\\", before transitioning into a more dancehall influenced sound. Gomez said the song was inspired by the trips that she made to South America during the We Own the Night Tour. The track is a self-empowerment anthem that contains reflections of \\"living the moment\\" and of self- confidence.  Critical reception  The song has compared to Rihanna's works (pictured). Andrew Hampp of Billboard compared the song with Rihanna's works by saying \\"The Rihanna-esque portion of \\"Stars Dance\\" kicks in with \\"Like A Champion,\\" a reggae-lite confection from co-writer Peter Thomas [...] that ultimately falls victim to too many references to the Barbadian pop princess — right down to the lyric \\"shine like diamonds in the sky.\\" Though a little island flair ultimately suits Gomez well, \\"Like A Champion\\" doesn't do much for establishing her own musical identity\\". Love Is Pop said that the song is \\"the album’s magnificent self-empowerment anthem\\" they also said that \\"[it] has an air of reggae to it, both in terms of the percussion and the way Selena sings it [...] the song actually begins with a guy who sounds like a genuine reggae artist singing the chorus, so I’m not imagining that\\". Idolator said that the song is \\"absurdly charming\\" and the described the song has a \\"faux island swagger\\" Kia Makarechi of The Huffington Post was critical of \\"Like a Champion\\" by saying \\"the biggest offender of accent and cultural appropriation on \\"Stars Dance\\" goes to this incredibly horrible song\\". Live performances \\"Like a Champion\\" was performed on November 28 during the Dallas Cowboys Thanksgiving Halftime Show. Gomez performed the song as the first portion of a medley featuring \\"Come & Get It\\" and \\"Slow Down\\". The song was added to the set list of Gomez's iHeartRadio Jingle Ball performances, along with four other songs. Gomez performed the songs using a hand-held microphone in a red \\"floor-length, lacy gown\\". The track is the third song to be performed on the Stars Dance Tour. Selena performed the song dressed in white stretchy pants, a white crop top vest, and a long, sleeveless white coat. Before the song begins Selena welcomes everyone to the show and asks the audience for help singing the song.

History =Academic Center history= In 2000, an idea was floated to create an academic center that would house an academic support program that would blend state-of-the-art technology with an appropriate study environment. LSU looked to Richard Manship, longtime Tiger football booster and CEO of Capital City Press and WBRZ-TV, to head the fundraising for the massive project. Manship, along with the Tiger Athletic Foundation, put together the Academic Center Development Council who was in charge of locating donors. Together with a $5.5 million donation by Cox Communications, more than $14 million was donated by private contributors and supporters of LSU Athletics. In November 2002, the LSU Cox Communications Academic Center for Student-Athletes idea came to fruition. =Building history= After Huey P. Long became Governor of Louisiana in 1928, he worked with LSU President Thomas Wilson Atkinson to find ways to obtain funding to build new facilities on LSU's campus. A priority was placed on a facility for large student gatherings. President Atkinson proposed a combination Gym/Armory and secured $250,000 from the Louisiana legislature for its construction. Completed in 1930 and built on the edge of the bluff, the main floor was the gymnasium and the lower floor was the armory. Both floors were located on ground level. The gymnasium had a stage at one end and could be converted into an auditorium by placing four thousand folding chairs on the gymnasium floor and another fifteen hundred in the balcony. When not set up as an auditorium, it provided an open space for basketball games, dances and other events. The second floor provided space for locker rooms, a trophy room and a dance studio. The Gym/Armory was home to the LSU Tigers basketball team after it moved from the old downtown campus. It was replaced by the John M. Parker Agricultural Coliseum in 1937, though for several years both the Gym/Armory and the coliseum were used for LSU basketball games. Over the years, the original building was renovated many times. The 20 foot ceilings were dropped to 8 and 9 foot ceilings to accommodate air conditioning and had multiple uses throughout its history.

He was active in pre-war Yugoslav politics, becoming a member of the Serbian Muslim cultural organization Gajret and serving as the mayor of Konjic, a town in northern Herzegovina. He is also said to have been candidate for Vladko Maček's electoral list, but was left without a job in the Yugoslav state government after the creation of the Banovina of Croatia in August 1939. Following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Popovac joined the Chetnik movement of Draža Mihailović. Popovac was a proponent of Bosnian Muslim cooperation with the Chetniks and suggested that they recruit Muslims into their ranks. In October 1942, he enlisted Italian aid in fighting the communist Partisans, and later visited Prozor to discourage further bloodshed after a Chetnik massacre that took the lives of as many as 2,500 Muslim and Croat civilians. In early 1943, he led an attack against a Muslim village. Later that year, he was killed in disputed circumstances near the town of Trebinje. Early life Ismet Popovac was a physician and lawyer by profession. He was a Bosnian Muslim and hailed from the town of Nevesinje. Popovac finished medical school in Belgrade and was a vocal South Slav nationalist throughout the interwar period. Prior to the outbreak of World War II, he was the mayor of Konjic, a town in northern Herzegovina. He was also a member of the pro-Serb and pro-Karađorđević Muslim cultural society known as Gajret, whose members experienced persecution at the hands of non-Serbs in interwar Yugoslavia due to their political inclinations. Popovac is also said to have been a candidate for Vladko Maček's electoral list, but was left without a job in the state government following the creation of the Banovina of Croatia in August 1939. World War II The Axis invasion of Yugoslavia was ordered by Adolf Hitler in late March 1941, in response to a palace coup that deposed the country's regent, Prince Paul, and placed his teenaged nephew Peter on the throne. The invasion commenced on 6 April 1941. Yugoslavia was overwhelmed by the combined strength of the Axis powers and surrendered in less than two weeks. The government and royal family went into exile, and the country was occupied and dismembered by its neighbours. The Croatian nationalist and fascist Ante Pavelić, who had been in exile in Benito Mussolini's Italy, was appointed Poglavnik (leader) of an Ustaše-led Croatian state, the Independent State of Croatia (; NDH). The NDH combined almost all of modern-day Croatia, all of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern-day Serbia into an \\"Italian-German quasi-protectorate.\\" With weeks of its establishment, the NDH authorities initiated a campaign of genocide against the Serbs, Jews and Roma living within its borders. Two resistance movements emerged following the invasion: the communist-led, multi-ethnic Partisans, and the royalist, Serbian nationalist Chetniks, although during 1941, within the occupied territory, even the Partisans consisted almost entirely of Serbs. The Partisans were led by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito, while the Chetniks were led by Colonel Draža Mihailović, an officer in the interwar Royal Yugoslav Army. The two movements had widely diverging goals. Whereas the Partisans sought to turn Yugoslavia into a communist state under Tito's leadership, the Chetniks sought a return to the pre-war status quo, whereby the Yugoslav monarchy—and, by extension, Serb political hegemony—would be restored. =Joining the Chetniks= Following the invasion, Popovac joined a Serb rebel band, subsequently swearing allegiance to the Chetniks. According to the historian H. James Burgwyn, Popovac hoped to achieve independence for Bosnia and Herzegovina through his cooperation with the Chetniks. He quickly became one of the most prominent pro-Chetnik Muslims, alongside Mustafa Pašić and former Sarajevo police chief Fuad Musakadić. Such affiliation was rare, as the Chetniks increasingly considered Muslims their enemies and began committing atrocities against Muslim civilians in the late spring of 1941. Due to these actions, and due to Muslims, especially those in eastern Bosnia, being branded by the Chetniks as \\"Turks\\" and \\"Ustaše cronies,\\" the Chetniks found few Muslim recruits. On 21 July 1942, Popovac wrote a letter to Mihailović, extolling the merits of recruiting Muslims into the Chetniks' ranks. \\"Muslims have never as a whole, or via any kind of qualified forum, recognized the Croatian state,\\" Popovac wrote. He proposed that Muslim troops \\"be gathered in either a joint or a specific Chetnik detachment\\". Popovac suggested that Mihailović should \\"adopt a prominent Muslim, who has a good voice and political roots among the people, and give him an appropriate rank as Muslim representative and advisor on all questions that relate to the areas in which Muslims live.\\" This proposal was met with support from pro-Serb, anti-communist Muslim leaders in several towns. =Muslim People's Military Organization= In October 1942, Popovac visited Prozor to discourage further bloodshed following a Chetnik massacre of Muslim and Croat civilians In late September or early October 1942, Popovac met with Chetnik leaders Dobroslav Jevđević and Petar Baćović. The three agreed to form a Muslim Chetnik militia. In October, Popovac enlisted Italian aid in fighting the Partisans. Popovac's Muslim Chetniks were soon \\"legalized\\" by the Italians and listed as part of their Anti-Communist Volunteer Militia (; MVAC). Popovac and Pašić became the political leaders of the Muslim Chetniks, whose militia was formally called the Muslim People's Military Organization (; MNVO). Musakadić was appointed the military leader of all the Muslim Chetniks. Another Muslim, Mustafa Mulalić, became the vice- chairman of the Chetnik's Central National Committee. The creation of the MNVO complied with the Chetniks' strategy of turning the Croats and Muslims of eastern Herzegovina against one another. According to Marko Attila Hoare, a historian specializing in the Balkans, the MNVO was part of a greater Muslim autonomist movement. In September 1942, an assembly of Herzegovinian Muslim notables in Mostar declared: \\"We Herzegovinians and Bosnians are nobody's property and we recognize the right of nobody to persecute us. So, insofar as our brothers in Zagreb do not wish to accede to our demands, we shall seek protection of our interests from other big powers from the ranks of our allies.\\" Vladimir Zečević, one of Mihailović's main agents in Herzegovina, believed that Popovac's \\"main goal was to protect the Muslims, rather than to struggle for the Serb nation and Serb affairs.\\" Popovac's close connections with the Muslim Chetnik leader Suljaga Salihagić, one of the authors of the Muslim Memorandum to Adolf Hitler in December 1942, appear to support this assertion. In October 1942, Popovac issued an appeal to Muslim Partisans, urging them to join the Chetniks and turn against the Ustaše. In a report to Mihailović dated 3 November, Popovac wrote: > I have to emphasize to you the intimate cooperation between the Muslims and > Orthodox in the Stolac district from where, through the joint struggle of > the Muslims and Orthodox, the Croat inhabitants, who were largely Ustaša- > inclined, have been expelled. In that way, from Gabela to Mostar the entire > left bank of the Neretva has been cleansed, and the number of refugees has > been estimated at 12,000 people. It was reported that Popovac had \\"won the majority of the Muslims to his purpose\\" in the Mostar, Konjic, Nevesinje and Gacko districts. Eventually, he came to be seen as one of \\"the principal representatives of the pro-Chetnik Muslim current\\" in Bosnia. In October 1942, during Operation Alfa, a joint Chetnik–Italian attack against the Partisans, the Chetniks killed between 543 and 2,500 Bosnian Muslim and Croat civilians in Prozor. Several days later, Popovac arrived in the town to console the Muslim population and advise the Chetniks there against committing further atrocities. He also attempted to recruit new Chetnik fighters from among the local Muslim population, but was unsuccessful due to the extent of Chetnik atrocities against them. On 31 December, in the face of widespread Muslim opposition, Popovac and his MNVO drafted a resolution vowing allegiance to Yugoslavia's exiled King Peter and to Mihailović, claiming Bosnian Muslims as \\"an integral part of Serbdom\\" and the MNVO as \\"part of the Chetnik movement led by Draža Mihailović, Minister of the Army, Navy and Air Forces.\\" In January 1943, Popovac led the MNVO in an attack which resulted in the capture of a communist village predominantly inhabited by Muslims. That same month, the Chetniks carried out a number of massacre against the Muslims, especially in Eastern Bosnia, in the areas of Koraj, Bijeljina, Srebrenica, Višegrad, Foča, Goražde, and Vlasenica. Between January and March 1943, Popovac's Chetniks fought the Partisans as part of the Axis-led military operation known as Case White, but did not distinguish themselves. During the operation itself, the Chetniks committed further atrocities against the Muslims. Nonetheless, Popovac and Pašić continued seeking Muslim recruits. They declared in their \\"Address to the Brethren Muslims of Čajniče and Other Nearby Districts\\" that the main goal of the Chetniks was \\"the intelligent and honest protection of Muslim interests\\". The Chetniks, they claimed, would \\"secure a safe future for our people with the highest principles of Islam: freedom of religion, holiness of the family, respect for private property, social justice, and democratic political freedom.\\" They denied that Muslims were collectively responsible for Ustaše crimes, writing: \\"Muslims are bound to the brethren of the Orthodox religion by blood and land.\\" =Demise= Popovac was killed on 21 August 1943. The exact circumstances of his death are disputed. Hoare states that Popovac was killed by members of the Partisan 10th Herzegovinan Brigade. The historian and economist Jozo Tomasevich writes that Popovac was killed by an assassin. The historians Zdravko Dizdar and Mihael Sobolevski claim that he was killed by the Chetniks in the vicinity of Trebinje after objecting to the killing of Muslims. By December 1943, it is estimated that 4,000 of Mihailović's Chetniks were Muslims, accounting for eight percent of all Chetniks in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1944, Mihailović appealed to Muslims to fight against the communists, citing the example of Popovac and other Muslim Chetniks.

The tournaments feature competitors organized into teams of six- eleven members. The teams compete in one or two day tournaments, depending on location. The beach will be split into different soccer field for the tournament to be played on. This series was created in 2006. Chris Lemay is credited for the existence of these tournaments. Soccer in the sand tournaments also provide skills clinics the Friday before a tournament. Not only do they hold clinics, they also donate money to organizations locally of where the tournament was held. A tournament benefit is held and players are encouraged to bring the whole family and spend time on the beach. This tournament is becoming a very attended event. The tournament held at Grand Haven, Michigan hosts 20,000 people including players, coaches, and fans. The host's of the tournaments encourage everybody to come to the tournament. Locations Tournaments are held at the following locations: * Kirra Beach, Gold Coast, Australia *Santa Barbara, California *San Diego, California *Clearwater Beach, Florida *Chicago, Illinois *Michigan City, Indiana *Detroit, Michigan *Grand Haven, Michigan *Muskegon, Michigan *Traverse City, Michigan *Rochester, New York *Cleveland, Ohio *Seaside, Oregon *Erie, Pennsylvania *Racine, Wisconsin Format The series is composed of fifteen separate annual tournaments of soccer played in the sand starting in early June and running through November. Each tournament features different competitors of soccer players that are grouped into different divisions and teams based on age, and gender. When registering the oldest player of the team is how it is determined what age group the team should be in. Females may play in either the female or male division, but boys may only play in the boys division. To be able to play for more than one team, the player must be playing on two teams in either different age groups, or different divisions. Each team can't have more than eleven players on it, unless it is a coed team, then the roster limit is twelve. Soccer in the sand consists of two tournaments that are either a one day tournament or a two day tournament depending on the location. Each team is guaranteed three games in the original bracket they are placed in. The time of the games varies depending on if it is a one day or two day tournament. For two day tournaments the games consist three eleven minute periods with two minute breaks between the periods. Meanwhile if it is a one day tournament games get two halves consisting of twelve minutes each with a two minute half time. The number of players on the field varies by location, some tournaments play a 6v6 including the goalkeeper and some are 5v5 including the goalkeeper. One player from each team will compete in either \\"rock, paper, scissors\\" or a coin toss to compete for the first kickoff or their choice of side to defend. If it is a two day tournament the referee will again flip a coin between periods two and three for the same thing to occur as it did at kickoff. The tournament is set up into different brackets. In the tournament the winning team of the game gains three points, a tie gets both teams one point, and the losing team receives zero points. In order to advance out of the original bracket and into playoffs the team must have the most points from their wins or ties. If two teams are tied on points to advance out of the bracket they can settle it by either a head to head, total goal differential of the tournament, or a shoot out.

Between 1951 and 1953, after the establishment of AFSOUTH, Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces Southern Europe, initially Admiral Robert Carney of the United States, also held the title of Commander, Allied Naval Forces Southern Europe. With the creation of Allied Forces Mediterranean in 1953, a British-led major NATO Subordinate Command that was responsible for maritime operations in the southern region the command and title was disestablished. In 1967 the NATO Military Command Structure was reorganised with the disbandment of Allied Forces Mediterranean. Established in partial recompense was NAVSOUTH, reactivated on 5 June 1967. The first commander of the reactivated organisation was Admiral Luciano Sotgiu of the Italian Navy. Its headquarters was located on Nisida island, Naples, Italy. NAVSOUTH's tasks were the control of the sea, a 24-hour surveillance of its area of responsibility, the protection of the sea lines of communication, as well as the naval control of shipping in the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. On 28 May 1969 the future establishment of the Naval On-Call Force Mediterranean (NAVOCFORMED) was approved by the NATO Defence Planning Committee.NAVOCFORMED was activated 43 times between 1970 and 1991. Source: http://www.jfcnaples.nato.int/page1170302.aspx [consulted on 27 February 2015]. The ships were to be called together and exercised at least once a year. Later the force was upgraded to standing status and renamed Standing Naval Force Mediterranean. Also formed later was the Mine Counter Measures Mediterranean Force (MCMFORMED) At the end of the Cold War the structure of Allied Naval Forces Southern Europe was as follows: * Allied Naval Forces Southern Europe (NAVSOUTH), in Naples, Italy, with the following national commands of Mediterranean NATO members: ** Commander Gibraltar Mediterranean (COMGIBMED), in Gibraltar, under a Royal Navy Rear Admiral and Flag Officer Gibraltar ** Commander Western Mediterranean (COMMEDWEST), under a French Navy admiral, until 1962 in Algiers, then Toulon, after France left NATO's integrated command structure in 1966 the command was absorbed by NAVSOUTH ** Commander Central Mediterranean (COMEDCENT), in Naples, under an Italian Navy admiral ** Commander Eastern Mediterranean (COMEDEAST), in Athens, under a Greek Navy admiral ** Commander South-Eastern Mediterranean (COMMEDSOUTHEAST), under a British admiral in Malta, after the disbanding of the Mediterranean Fleet, the command was absorbed by NAVSOUTH ** Commander North-eastern Mediterranean (COMEDNOREAST), in Ankara, under a Turkish Navy admiral (includes the Black Sea) In 2004, NAVSOUTH became Allied Maritime Command Naples. Operations From 1992 to 1996, COMNAVSOUTH led the joint Western European Union (WEU)/NATO maritime operation known as Operation Sharp Guard in support of NATO operations in the Balkans. The operation replaced naval blockades Operation Maritime Guard (of NATO; begun by the U.S. in November 1992) and Sharp Fence (of the WEU). It put them under a single chain of command and control (the \\"Adriatic Military Committee\\", over which the NATO and WEU Councils exerted joint control), to address what their respective Councils viewed as wasteful duplication of effort. Some maintain that despite the nominal official joint command and control of the operation, in reality it was NATO staff that ran the operation.

She graduated from the painting department of the Vilnius Academy of Arts in 1993. For a couple of years after graduation she participated in the emerging Lithuanian fashion scene, experimenting with the incorporation of non-traditional materials and humorous associations in designs which were intended to shock the public.Kreuger, Anders, Self Esteem.

These include For Virginia (1994), a dress made of dried jasmine petals sewn together, and Hairy (1994), an all-over suit knitted from synthetic fabric which has the appearance of curly dark hair, and which covered the whole body, leaving only apertures the eyes, nose and mouth, as well as those areas where hair is \\"legitimate\\" on a woman—the head and the crotch.Šepetytė, Danutė, \\"Gražu tai, kas išnyksta\\", Julius, 23 March 1996, p.5Jomantienė, Irena, \\"Taking art by the short and curlies\\", Lithuania in the World, No.3, 2001, p.49 Eglė Rakauskaitė - For Guilty without Guilt.

Chocolate Crucifixes (1995) was another landmark work; a sculpture composed of chocolate crucifix figurines each 42 cm high, fixed onto the wall to form a decorative pattern. First shown in Lithuania with just 42 crucifixes (exhibition New Works at the Vilnius Contemporary Art Centre (CAC)), the work was increased to a heroic scale with 1090 pieces in 2000 when it was shown in the exhibition L'autre moitié de l'Europe at the Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume in Paris.Jomantienė, Irena, \\"My sweet chocolate Lord and others\\", The Baltic Independent, January 20–26, 1995, p.11Urmonaitė, Edita, \\"Tūkstantis šokoladinių krucifiksų kitoje Europos pusėje\\", Mūzų malūnas (supplement to Lietuvos Rytas), No.7(428), 15 February 2000 =Body art and performance= With In Honey (1996) the artist's body was incorporated within the work for the first time, and it is also one her first uses of the video medium. Categorised as a videoperformance, the work has been presented as the video documentation of a performance in which the artist lay in a sort of hammock half-immersed in honey (due to the density of honey the human body floats in it) breathing through a tube.Pankūnaitė, Birutė, \\"A Tender Revolt\\", in Linara Dovydaitytė (ed.), Emisija 2004 - ŠMC, Vilnius, 2005, p.114 From In Honey followed on In Fat (1998), another videoperformance. For this work, Rake lay fully immersed in a glass tank filled with melted lard, again breathing through a tube, until the fat cooled down and solidified. The work was presented in an installation where three aligned television monitors, each showing a third of the artist's body and together forming a nearly life-size image, are fitted in blankly dark premises, raised on a platform with their backs turned to the spectator; in front of the screens a pane of shop-window glass is hung obliquely, so that the view from the screens is reflected in the glass. The final video is twenty-minutes long, during which small movements of the body, most notably a hand, are perceptible while the fat gradually becomes lighter in colour and increasingly more opaque.Jomantienė, Irena, \\"Taking art by the short and curlies\\", Lithuania in the World, No.3, 2001, p.50Jablonskienė, Lolita, \\"Eglė Rakauskaitė\\", in Mika Briški (ed.), Body and the East: From the 1960s to the Present, Ljubljana, 1998, p.102 Later years (1998–2003) =Video art and installation= Towards the end of the 1990s a notable shift in Rake's art is perceptible as she turns her sight from the exploration of unconventional materials and her own body as a medium to the observation of her social context.Pankūnaitė, Birutė, \\"A Tender Revolt\\", in Linara Dovydaitytė (ed.), Emisija 2004 - ŠMC, Vilnius, 2005, p.114 At the same time, video becomes her main form of expression.

A synchronised two-channel video installation, it shows the faces of various people Rake encountered in professional and personal situations during that period.

This species grows to a length of SL, though most do not exceed TL. This fish can also be found displayed in public aquaria. This species is the only known member of its genus. Description The arrow goby is a small, pale grey, translucent fish which grows to in length. It has two dorsal fins; the first is the shorter and has 4-5 spines while the dorsal fin has 15-17 soft fin rays. The anal fin is about equal in length to the second dorsal fin and has 14-17 fin rays. Like other gobies, the caudal fin is rounded and the pectoral fins form a cone which the goby uses to prop the anterior part of its body above the substrate. Its scales are minute, and the mouth extends beyond to the eye. The dorsal fins have short horizontal stripes and the body is pale brownish-grey in colour with darker mottling. Distribution Arrow gobies are found along the Pacific Coast of North America, from the Rivers Inlet in British Columbia to Baja California. Habitat and biology The arrow goby occurs in sand or mud substrates, where it uses burrows created by invertebrates as shelters when it is threatened and as a refuge at low tide. Some of the species which make burrows used by arrow gobies include the shrimps Neotrypaea californiensis and Upogebia pugettensis and the fat innkeeper worm Urechis caupo. It is a common species of estuaries, lagoons and tidal sloughs, and it has been reported in freshwater. The adults feed on diatoms, green algae, tintinnids, eggs and young of the host shrimp or prawn. This species will place large food items close to crabs so that the crab will tear it into smaller pieces. Arrow gobies are prey for Sebastes, staghorn sculpin, whitespot greenling and terns. This species does not build a nest or provide any care for its offspring, and the eggs are dispersed into the water column. The underside of this goby is silvery, and when threatened, they use this to make a brief signal to other gobies before quickly taking refuge in the burrow. This is also used to signal for mates. The individuals of this species are protogynous hermaphrodites; young adults are females and as they mature they become male. Etymology The generic name Clevelandia honours the lawyer Daniel Cleveland (1838–1929), who was a founder and president of the San Diego Natural History Society and who made significant contributions to the knowledge of the flora and fauna of southern California. Over a dozen plants – including the Cleveland sage and another genus Clevelandia – were also named after him. The specific name ios is an Ancient Greek word for an arrow: . It refers to the slender fish's long body that is reminiscent of an arrow.

The community is located south of Eagle Lake near the junction of FM 102 and FM 950\\\\. The settlement was named for a man who owned an area plantation before the American Civil War. By 2013, the school, post office, businesses and railroad line that once served Matthews were gone, but the number of silos in the neighborhood indicated that the land was still being intensively farmed. Geography According to the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), Matthews is located at both and . The first location is just south of the intersection of FM 102 and Strickland Lane. The second location is where Matthews Store Road crosses the former railroad right-of-way. A third location is given by the Texas State Historical Association, which describes the community as being situated at the junction of FM 102 and FM 950. The third location is northwest of the first GNIS site and south of the second GNIS location. Matthews Store Road is an east–west connector of FM 102 and the parallel FM 3013\\\\. Matthews is south of Eagle Lake and northwest of Wharton on FM 102\\\\. The community is northeast of Garwood on FM 950. History In 1827, John Matthews purchased acreage from James Nelson, one of the Old Three Hundred who were granted land in Stephen F. Austin's colony. Matthews started a successful plantation that owned 140 slaves by 1860. The community that formed in the area served Matthews' and other nearby plantations. After the end of the Civil War, many of the freed slaves stayed in the area. Freed slaves who were descendants of James Montgomery's plantation slaves from Matthews stayed in and around the area and have gone on to great heights. Rev. Daniel Whitley, one of Montgomery's slaves who was emancipated after the American Civil War, went on to be a minister in both Columbus and in Eagle Lake. His grandson, John Whitley, who was raised in the house of Whitley's daughter Cordelia and her husband after both his father and mother had died, became a noted art restorer and intimate of J. Frank Dobie who at one time restored all of the paintings hanging in the Texas Capitol. Cordelia's husband, Daniel Whitley's son-in-law, Cicero Howard, was the second black man elected to public office in Colorado County at the county level, and the first black Colorado County Commissioner. The Matthews Community settlement boasted a blacksmith shop, a cotton gin and a store in 1880. The community acquired a post office in 1895 with Mary McRee serving as postmaster. In 1898 the Cane Belt Railroad was chartered. By June 1899, the railroad stretched from Eagle Lake to Wharton. The Cane Belt was bought by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in 1904.Osborn (1998), p. 308 In 1900, Matthews had four commercial establishments, a school and 100 residents. The post office closed in 1905 and mail began to be delivered from Eagle Lake. The population remained steady until the 1960s when the hand-picked cotton harvests were replaced by mechanized rice and corn production. By the mid-1980s there was only one local business. The railroad through the area was abandoned in 1992 and the tracks removed. The former railroad right-of-way running parallel with FM 102 near Matthews can be easily seen in satellite views.

Originally commissioned into the Royal Navy, she served as an ocean escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. Background Flower-class corvettes like Fennel serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail- driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which – in the Royal Navy – were named after flowering plants. Construction Fennel was ordered by the Royal Navy on 22 January 1940 as part of the 1939–1940 Flower-class building program. She was laid down 29 March 1940 by Marine Industries Ltd. at Sorel, Quebec and launched 20 August later that year. Fennel was towed to Liverpool, Nova Scotia and was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 16 January 1941. She was finished enough to make an ocean crossing as part of HX 113 and was completed at Greenock, United Kingdom. On the 15 May 1941 Fennel was one of ten corvettes loaned to Canada. She could be told apart from other Canadian Flowers by her lack of minesweeping gear and the siting of the after gun tub amidships. Fennel had four major refits during her career as a warship. The first took place at Halifax for a brief two-month refit beginning in October 1941. The second took place at New York from mid-July 1942 until late September 1942. The third major refit took place at Baltimore that began in June 1943 and lasted until September of that year. During this refit, the fo'c'sle was extended. Fennel final refit took place in August 1944 at Pictou, Nova Scotia and took two months to complete. War service =Royal Navy= After completing at Greenock, Fennel was sent to Tobermory, the site of the ocean escort training facilities, to work up. Upon completion, she was assigned to Western Approaches Command until June 1941 when she was reassigned to Newfoundland Command. This was after being loaned to Canada in May 1941. =Royal Canadian Navy= Joining Newfoundland Command in June, Fennel was assigned to escort group 22N until September 1941 and then group N11 from December 1941 until March 1942 as an ocean escort. Beginning in April 1942 she had a brief spell as a member of Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) escort group C-1 before transferring to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) in June of that year. She remained a part of WLEF until June 1943. In June 1943, Fennel joined MOEF group C-2 for one escort assignment before heading off for a refit. Upon completion of workups, she returned to C-2. She remained with this group until December 1944. On 6 March 1944, after unsuccessful attempts at towing the boat to port U-744 was sunk in the North Atlantic, in position 52°01′N, 22°37′W, after being torpedoed by the British destroyer HMS Icarus. U-744 was attacked for over 30 hours by depth charges from the Fennel, along with HMS Icarus, the frigate HMCS St. Catharines, corvettes HMCS Chilliwack and HMS Kenilworth Castle, destroyers HMCS Chaudiere and HMCS Gatineau. Not all these ships fought at the same time, as Gatineau and Kenilworth Castle both had to leave with mechanical defects during the battle. In December 1944, Fennel transferred to MOEF escort group C-1. She remained with that group for the rest of the war. On 12 June 1945, Fennel was paid off and returned to the Royal Navy. Post-war service After lay up, Fennel was sold for mercantile conversion in 1946. In 1948 she was registered under a Norwegian flag as Milliam Kihl. She was rebuilt as buoy-boat in October 1948. She was refitted as whaler in 1951 in Kiel, West Germany. Laid up in 1960/1961, her last drifting season was in 1964/1965. She was laid up again in Sandefjord and sold to Norwegian shipbreakers in Grimstad in 1966.

He is one of the founders of museum education and the art education movement.  Background and career  Front Dike 9, Hamburg-Reitbrook, Lichtwark's birthplace. Alfred Lichtwark was the son of Herr Johann Karl Ernst Lichtwark, a minor lord who owned the Reitbrook Mill. From his father's first marriage he had three half- siblings. Alfred Lichtwark's mother Johanne Helene Henrietta (née Bach) (1829–1909) was believed to be a direct descendant of the composer Johann Sebastian Bach. Lichtwark had a happy childhood in the countryside with his siblings Hans and Marianne (1857–1930) until 1858, when his father was forced to sell the mill for financial reasons. The family moved to Hamburg, where his father ran an inn which fared poorly, and the family lived in poverty. Lichtwark, who attended the civil school, proved to be very talented and versatile, helping students after school as an assistant teacher. In 1873 he took the Abitur at the Christianeum in Altona. A grant by Justus Brinckmann helped finance his studies in arts and education in Dresden, Leipzig, and Berlin. After finishing his studies he worked at several primary and civil schools in Berlin. Lichtwark was very disenchanted with the educational system that existed at that time in Imperial Germany, which led him to the idea of a new kind of school or pedagogy.  Director of the Kunsthalle Hamburg  A portrait of Alfred Lichtwark, painted by Leopold Karl Walter Graf von Kalckreuth, 1912. It is unclear why Lichtwark was asked in 1886 whether he wanted to take over as the director of the Kunsthalle Hamburg (an art museum in Hamburg), which was previously managed only by a member of the Senate. He became the first director of the Kunsthalle Hamburg on December 3, 1886, after which he systematically developed its collection. The current collection is still largely based on the foundations set by Lichtwark. Lichtwark collected Hamburg's medieval art (especially the works of Master Bertram and Master Francke) on the one hand, and also sought and acquired works of German romantics on the other hand (Caspar David Friedrich, Philipp Otto Runge). He also collected the works of contemporary artists of the late 19th century such as Lovis Corinth, Wilhelm Leibl, Adolph Menzel, Pierre Bonnard, and Édouard Vuillard. With the museum's busy purchasing practices and his intense public relations work, Lichtwark succeeded in broadening the understanding of the then-contemporary art. In addition to his heavy interest in French Impressionism, he advocated strongly for the Hamburg art scene. He initiated the establishment of the Hamburgischer Künstlerklub and awarded contracts to painters such as Gotthardt Kuehl and Wilhelm Trübner. His aim of creating an artistic monument for his hometown of Hamburg led to contracts with painters such as Max Liebermann and Theodor Hagen, from whom he received several harbor pictures. During his tenure Lichtwark undertook several trips to Dresden, Weimar, Frankfurt, Geneva, Paris, London, and Stockholm, where he looked for numerous art motifs. He also brought back the Grabow Altarpiece of Master Bertram, which used to be the altar of St. Peter's Church in Hamburg, from the church in Grabow back to Hamburg. This was first displayed in 1906 at the Kunsthalle Hamburg. Lichtwark criticized the class divisions in German society and other parts of Europe during that time. His educational ideas eventually led to the founding of the Lichtwark school, an educational reform school in Hamburg-Winterhude. He led exercises on the contemplation of works of art in which he systematically discussed his museum's artworks with students. He published the resultant findings in several papers and books. He is thus one of the founders of the field of museum education. Alfred Lichtwark was a friend of Max Liebermann, Hans Olde, and Max Predöhl, mayor of Hamburg, and a supporter of Count Harry Kessler. The founding and design of the Hamburg Museum, as well as art education for young children, were results of his initiative. In 1896 he opened an exhibition in the Kunsthalle Hamburg on the topic of how children think and paint. Lichtwark remained the director of the Kunsthalle Hamburg until his death in 1914. He died of stomach cancer and was buried in the Old Hamburg Memorial Cemetery, part of the Ohlsdorf Cemetery. His successor at the museum was Gustav Pauli.  Lichtwark Prize  The Lichtwark Prize was started in 1951 by the Senate of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg on the occasion of the 100th birthday of Alfred Lichtwark.Press archive at hamburg.de It is awarded every five years to a painter, draftsman, sculptor, or other artist whose works have produced a significant impact in the world of visual arts.

He is known for his college career at Georgetown University, where he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine after helping the Hoyas to the 1984 NCAA championship. Graham, a 6'9\\" power forward from Spingarn High School in Washington, D.C., signed with future Hall of Fame coach John Thompson at Georgetown. As a freshman in 1983–84, Graham became a key player for the Hoyas. He provided rugged defense and rebounding, appearing in all but two of the team's 37 games - starting 17. While his regular season statistics were pedestrian, Graham became a key player for the Hoyas in their quest for a national championship. In the 1984 Final Four, Graham scored 22 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and led the Hoyas to a victory over the Houston Cougars for the national championship. In the championship game, Graham scored 14 points on 7-9 shooting and was one of two Georgetown players to be named to the All-Final Four team along with Most Outstanding Player Patrick Ewing. Following the championship win, Graham – whose fiery demeanor and shaved head were seen as personifying the Hoyas' aggressive playing style – appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine. Following the championship season, Graham had academic difficulties and was suspended from the Georgetown team. He ultimately transferred to the University of the District of Columbia in an attempt to play Division II basketball, but ultimately declared for the 1986 NBA draft without playing a game for the Firebirds. Graham was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics in the fourth round of the draft (76th pick overall), but did not make the Sonics' final roster. He played several seasons in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), for the Albany Patroons, Charleston Gunners, Wyoming Wildcatters, Rochester Flyers, Tulsa Fast Breakers and Columbus Horizon. In his four CBA seasons, Graham averaged 7.8 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. Graham also played in Europe and South America.

The suspect was later identified by authorities as 40-year-old James DiMaggio, owner of a home in Boulevard, California, about an hour away, where Anderson, her mother Christina and brother Ethan had been overnight guests the previous evening. The bodies of Christina and Ethan Anderson and the family dog, Cali, were later found in DiMaggio's burned home. An AMBER alert was issued for Hannah Anderson, who was found alive in Cascade, Idaho on August 10, a week after she was abducted. DiMaggio was killed by FBI agents during a shootout at the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness in Idaho, where he had been hiding Anderson at a campsite. Abduction and manhunt =Boulevard murders= James DiMaggio had invited Christina Anderson and her children to his home at 2071 Ross Avenue in Boulevard, ostensibly to say goodbye because he was planning to move to Texas. The Anderson family, who lived about away in Lakeside, stayed over at his home. The children's father, Brett Anderson, was on a three-month job in Tennessee at the time. On August 4, a fire was reported at DiMaggio's house in Boulevard, where firemen found the bodies of Anderson's mother, Christina, her eight-year-old brother Ethan, and the family dog Cali. Christina Anderson died of blunt force trauma, believed to have been caused by a crowbar. She was apparently tortured, and her body covered with a tarp. Cali was shot dead and covered with a sleeping bag. An arrest warrant was issued for DiMaggio. In late September 2013, the San Diego County Medical Examiner's office released results of the autopsies of Christina and Ethan Anderson. The autopsy of Christina Anderson found that a plastic cable tie had been used to bind her ankles, and that duct tape was wrapped around her neck and mouth. Her right arm and both legs were fractured, and there was a cut on her neck. She had been struck at least twelve times in the head. The autopsy of Ethan Anderson determined that the boy died because of the fire, though he also had skeletal fractures that could have been caused by events during the day of the murders. =Abduction reported= On August 4, 2013, Anderson's grandparents called the police and reported their grandchildren missing, prompting police to issue a statewide AMBER Alert, the first alert sent out to cellphones in California. As the child's body found in the burned-out home was burned beyond recognition, the AMBER Alert included both Hannah and Ethan Anderson. The manhunt stretched along the Pacific Coast from British Columbia, Canada to Baja California, Mexico. =Sightings in Idaho= On August 7, two people matching the description of DiMaggio and Anderson were seen by horseback riders in Cascade, Idaho. The next day, authorities were notified of this sighting after the riders watched a news report about the abduction. =Shooting and rescue= According to Anderson, James DiMaggio, while they were fugitives, had threatened to kill her and anyone who tried to rescue her. On the same day that the sightings were reported, DiMaggio's car, a blue Nissan Versa, was discovered near the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness. The car's license plates had been removed and brush was used to hide the vehicle. On August 10, police discovered DiMaggio's campsite and an FBI tactical agent killed DiMaggio near Morehead Lake around 5:00 p.m. DiMaggio fired at least one shot at the officers, causing the officers to fire back, killing him. DiMaggio was shot six times in the head, arms, and upper torso. Anderson had no visible injuries, but was taken to a local hospital for crisis counseling. Afterwards, when asked if she was glad James DiMaggio was dead, Hannah Anderson responded, \\"Absolutely yes\\". Perpetrator James Everet Lee DiMaggio, Jr. (January 17, 1973 – August 10, 2013), age 40, was a telecommunications technician in San Diego. According to a friend of DiMaggio, his father, James Everet Lee Sr., died exactly 15 years to the day before his son. The friend said the elder DiMaggio, who was accused of attempting to kidnap the 16-year-old daughter of an ex-girlfriend in 1988, committed suicide on August 10, 1998, though public records indicate that his suicide was instead committed on August 10, 1995. DiMaggio was said to be the best friend of Christina's husband, Brett Anderson, and he was like an uncle to the children. He had helped them with various tasks, such as driving Hannah and a friend from a gymnastics meet, during which he had unnerved her by saying he would like to date her, if they were the same age. During a trip to Los Angeles with Anderson, DiMaggio also complained she \\"wasn't paying enough attention to him.\\" Anderson's friends said she did not like being alone with him and was \\"creeped out\\" by his comments on the drive from the meet. DiMaggio listed Brett Anderson's mother as the beneficiary to his life insurance in 2011, while he lived with her. He intended the $112,000 for Hannah and Ethan, but did not trust their parents to handle the inheritance. This revelation prompted members of DiMaggio's family to request a paternity test to determine if he fathered the Anderson children. Brett called the suggestion \\"disgusting\\" and an Anderson family spokeswoman said DiMaggio had not met Christina until she was six months pregnant with Hannah. The DiMaggio family later withdrew their request for DNA testing. According to released warrants, DiMaggio received letters from Hannah Anderson which were found in his home by investigators, and exchanged over a dozen calls with her before the murders occurred. However, San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said Hannah Anderson was \\"a victim in every sense of the word\\" and did not willingly go with DiMaggio. Investigators do not suspect any complicity on her part. Gore also suggested that authorities may never be able to fully determine the reason for DiMaggio's crime rampage.

Early history After Huey P. Long became Governor of Louisiana in 1928, he worked with LSU President Thomas Wilson Atkinson to find ways to obtain funding to build new facilities on LSU's campus. A priority was placed on a facility for large student gatherings. Due to budget constraints, President Atkinson proposed a combination Gym/Armory and secured $250,000 from the Louisiana legislature for its construction. It was built on the edge of the bluff, the main floor was the gymnasium and the lower floor was the armory. Both floors were located on ground level. The gymnasium had a stage at one end and could be converted into an auditorium by placing 4,000 folding chairs on the gymnasium floor and another 1,500 in the balcony. When not set up as an auditorium, it provided an open space for basketball games, dances and other events. The second floor provided space for locker rooms, a trophy room and a dance studio. The Gym/Armory was home to the LSU Tigers basketball team after it moved from the old downtown campus. It was replaced by the John M. Parker Agricultural Coliseum in 1937, though for several years both the Gym/Armory and the coliseum were used for LSU basketball games. The facility was also the home of the LSU Tigers wrestling team until moving to the Pete Maravich Assembly Center and has also hosted LHSAA state wrestling tournaments. Over the years, the original building was renovated many times. The 20 foot ceilings were dropped to 8 and 9 foot ceilings to accommodate air conditioning and had multiple uses throughout its history. Cox Communications Academic Center for Student-Athletes In 2000, an idea was floated to create an academic center that would house an academic support program that would blend state-of-the-art technology with an appropriate study environment. LSU looked to Richard Manship, longtime Tiger football booster and CEO of Capital City Press and WBRZ-TV, to head the fundraising for the massive project. Manship, along with the Tiger Athletic Foundation, put together the Academic Center Development Council who was in charge of locating donors. Together with a $5.5 million donation by Cox Communications, more than $14 million was donated by private contributors and supporters of LSU Athletics. In November 2002, the LSU Cox Communications Academic Center for Student-Athletes idea came to fruition. The goal of the academic center is to offer a comprehensive framework tailored to improve the academic skill set of each student-athlete. The 54,000 square foot Academic Center for Student-Athletes is complete with an entry/atrium, 1,000+-seat Bo Campbell auditorium, computer labs, instructional technology lab, resource library with tech center, study area, tutorial center, meeting rooms, classrooms, student learning center, Shaquille O'Neal life skills labs and offices, Eric Hill communications studio, career center and Academic Hall of Fame.

Risk assessment is used for uncertain events that could have many outcomes and for which there could be significant consequences. Risk is a function of probability of an event (a particular hazard occurring) and the consequences given the event occurs. Probability refers to the likelihood that a hazard will occur. In a qualitative assessment, probability and consequence are not numerically estimated, but are evaluated verbally using qualifiers like high likelihood, low likelihood, etc. Qualitative assessments are good for screening level assessments when comparing/screening multiple alternatives or for when sufficient data is not available to support numerical probability or consequence estimates. Once numbers are inserted into the analysis (either by quantifying the likelihood of a hazard or quantifying the consequences) the analysis transitions to a semi-quantitative or quantitative risk assessment. Qualitative techniques There are several techniques when performing qualitative risk analysis to determine the probability and impact of risks, including the following: * Brainstorming, interviewing, Delphi technique * Historical data * Strength, weakness, opportunity, and threats analysis (SWOT analysis) * Risk rating scales Developing rating scales Assigning probability and impacts to risks is a subjective exercise. Some of this subjectivity can be eliminated by developing rating scales that are agreed upon by the sponsor, project manager, and key team members. Some organizations, particularly those that have project management offices responsible for overseeing all projects, have rating scales already developed.Kim Heldman, PMP, Project Manager's Spotlight on Risk Management,p125,126  External Links  * Current Intelligence Bulletin 69: NIOSH Practices in Occupational Risk Assessment.

This was the first comprehensive sewer system in the United States. He is responsible for the plan to raise Chicago, construction of the first water crib in Chicago, and designing the Boston water distribution system. The water system he designed for Chicago is on the National Register of Historic Places and has been designated a Historical Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. Early life and career Chesbrough was born in 1813 in Baltimore, Maryland to Isaac M. Chesbrough and Phrania Jones. Chesbrough's father was originally a farmer in Massachusetts, but he pursued other means of business, which mostly failed. One of these failed ventures forced Chesbrough to abandon regular schooling when he was nine. Chesbrough spent the next few years working for mercantile houses in Baltimore. Chesbrough's father became a surveyor for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1828, and Chesbrough became a surveyor for the city of Baltimore later that year through his father's job. Chesbrough moved to Pennsylvania in 1830 to become a surveyor for the Allegheny Portage Railroad under the command of Colonel Stephen Harriman Long. From 1831 to 1842, Chesbrough worked on the construction of railroads under the command of William Gibbs McNeill and his brother-in-law George Washington Whistler, the father of the artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler. Chesbrough worked as a farmer between 1842 and 1844 as the effects of the Panic of 1837 deprived him of employment as an engineer. After he returned to his profession, Chesbrough became the engineer for the water systems of Boston, and helped to build the Cochituate Aqueduct. He was named the first city engineer of Boston in 1851. Work in Chicago In the late 1840s, Chicago was growing rapidly and was plagued with health issues: the majority of the city sat at water level, which meant water was unable to drain out of the city. The problem was fully realized in the summer of 1849, when a cholera epidemic struck Chicago. In response, the public held meetings and demanded that the City Council rid the city of filth. The legislature of Illinois created the Board of Sewerage Commissioners on February 14, 1855, leading to the appointment of Assistant health officers to aid the cleanup, and by August the Council resolved to build a sewage system. Chesbrough was appointed engineer of the Board of Sewerage Commissioners because of his work on Boston’s water distribution system. From an engineering standpoint, the main problems were moving waste water out of the city and keeping it from polluting the city's drinking water supply, drawn from Lake Michigan. His plan was twofold: first, to build the sewer system above ground, and then raise all of the city buildings as much as ten feet using an elaborate system of jacks. The new sewer system featured innovations such as manhole covers, which eased access to and cleaning of the sewers. However, sewage still flowed into the lake and polluted the city's drinking water. In 1864, work began on a two-mile Chicago lake tunnel, sixty feet under the lake, out to a new intake crib. This allowed drinking water to be drawn from farther out in the lake, past the contaminating sewage. Eventually, however, sewage water seeped all the way to the crib, giving Chesbrough a third chance. Plans were made to reverse the flow of the Chicago River, leading water away from Lake Michigan and carrying Chicago's sewage into the Mississippi River. In the late 1860s, the Illinois and Michigan Canal was dredged and deepened to expand its ability to handle the city's sewage and move it away from the lake, but continued population growth quickly outstripped the canal's waste management capacity. The project of reversing the river was completed after Chesbrough's death by the Sanitary District of Chicago (now The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District), created in 1889, which undertook the construction of the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal.

The Great Hanging at Gainesville was the execution by hanging of 41 suspected Unionists in Gainesville, Texas, in October 1862 during the American Civil War. Two additional suspects were shot by Confederate troops while trying to escape. Some 150–200 men were captured and arrested by state Confederate troops in and near Cooke County at a time when numerous citizens of North Texas were opposed to the new law on conscription. Many suspects were tried by a \\"Citizens' Court\\" organized by a Confederate officer. It made up its own rules for conviction and had no status under state law. Although only 11% of county households owned slaves, seven of the 12 men on the jury were slaveholders, determined to suppress dissent. The suspects were executed one or two at a time. After several men had been convicted and executed, mob pressure built against remaining suspects. The jury gave the mob 14 names and these men were lynched without trial. After having been acquitted, another 19 men were returned to court and convicted, with no new evidence; they were hanged, all largely because of mob pressure. Most of the victims were residents of Cooke County. In total, this is claimed to be the largest mass hanging in the history of the United States.Loewen 1999, pp. 177–82 The Confederate and state courts ended the Citizens Court activities; President Davis had already dismissed General Paul Octave Hébert as military commander of the state, but Confederate military abuses continued in North Texas. In the 21st century,a privately organized, annual commemoration of the hangings has been held since 2007. The Cooke County Heritage Society planned a formal commemoration in 2012 to mark the 150th anniversary of the Great Hanging. They cancelled it when the mayor objected, but a private event brought together descendants of several victims at a family reunion organized with speakers to discuss the event. In 2014, a memorial was installed near the execution site that commemorates the event and its victims. Background Gainesville in Cooke County, Texas Colonization of North Texas, situated on the Forks of the Trinity River, began in 1841 with an agreement between William S. Peters and the Republic of Texas in 1841. Peters enticed settlers by promising to supply them in exchange for half their land. Cooke County was created in 1848, and the next year, US Army Captain Randolph B. Marcy surveyed a trail that crossed the Red River and ran through the county. Early settlement was difficult. Peters did not send any support and was generally distant; settlers generally resorted to vigilante justice. Henry O. Hedgecoxe, sent by Peters to press for his share of the land, was run out of North Texas in July 1852. As a result, Texas Governor Peter H. Bell called a session of the Texas Legislature in January 1853 that forced Peters to settle all disputes with the settlers in their favor. On 26 January 1854, Gainesville was officially designated the seat of Cooke County. The first stagecoach of the Butterfield Overland mail route arrived through Gainesville on September 20, 1858. The route brought a rapid rise in Gainesville's population to 280 people in 1860. The majority of settlers from the Butterfield route settled in homesteads concentrated in either the East Crosswoods, the Elm Fork of the Trinity to Gainesville's south, or on the Red River to the north.McCaslin 1994, pp. 9–13, 14 Of the 421,294 free citizens of Texas as counted in the 1860 Census, nearly two- thirds were born outside of Texas. The majority of Texans came from the Upper South, but slaveholding Lower Southerners were pre-eminent and disproportionately represented in Texas's government. The production of cotton, which had exploded over seven-fold in Texas over the 1850s, made slaveholders rich and connected the state's leaders to the future Confederacy. Cooke County had a similar transition of power, while its population remained overwhelmingly nonslaveholding. By 1860, only 10.9% of Cooke County households owned slaves. Among them were the county's chief justice, sheriff Alexander Boutwell, and three out of the four county commissioners. Other important slaveholders were Daniel Montague and James G. Bourland, a former Texas state senator, and James W. Throckmorton, a member of the Texas Legislature who was critical to the settlement with Peters in 1853. The slaveholders also controlled the volunteer state militias and often led them on expeditions against nearby Native Americans raiding Cooke and other North Texas counties. Extralegal violence against Natives was commonplace and cyclical, as was vigilante justice enacted on suspected white collaborators and abolitionists.McCaslin 1994, pp. 10, 11, 14 15–16, 18–19 New arrivals brought by the Butterfield Overland route were either suspected of abolitionism, or were abolitionist. Among the latter were Methodist preachers who did not recognize the 1844 schism in the church over slavery and were consequently violently repressed by vigilantes. When a series of fires caused significant damage to North Texas, tensions flared and then exploded into violence that resulted in three slaves hung in Dallas, a Methodist minister by the name of Anthony Bewley lynched,Bewley, Anthony a hundred others whipped, and many free Northern Texans who had not already murdered or chased out of Texas by vigilantes. Despite growing secessionism in Texas, Cooke County increasingly cast its lot against the incumbent Southern Democrats. Nearby US Army forts, which did business with North Texan slaveholders, provided protection against Native American raids. Cooke County residents, furthermore, did not have an economic dependence on slavery, and were unwilling to sacrifice their security to defend it. In the 1859 gubernatorial elections, 73% of Cooke County residents voted for Unionist Sam Houston, who downplayed the fires and posed himself as a moderate against Democrat Hardin Runnels, whose border security policies Houston decried as a failure. As in the rest of the antebellum South, however, John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry and the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States eliminated backlash against secession in Texas. In North Texas, slaveholders began holding secessionist rallies in late 1860, though the sentiment was not unanimous in Cooke County nor the governments of Texas and United States. The January 1861 session of the Texas Legislature overwhelmingly voted in favor of secession, to which Throckmorton was a leading opponent. A referendum, marred with secessionist violence and intimidation, was held in February; 61% of Cooke County votes were for staying in the Union, making it one of 18 of 122 Texas counties to vote against secession.McCaslin 1994, pp. 16, 19–20, 22–26, 27-28, 29, 32-34 Texas seceded from the Union on 4 March 1861. When Governor Sam Houston refused to pledge allegiance to the Confederate States of America, he was deposed and replaced by the Lieutenant Governor Edward Clark. With secession, North Texans left the state by the hundred for free soil. This exodus gave Confederate officials and supporters the false belief that opposition to secession in North Texas had \\"vanished\\", as was reported in The Times- Picayune, in New Orleans. Discontent with the Confederacy had, in fact, grown in the region with the arrival of refugees from other areas of the Confederacy. Many of these were men fleeing conscription and thereby contributing to a feeling of cynicism and suspicion settling over North Texas. Many more yet were slaves, whose masters only made up a third of the free refugees. Confederate policies exacerbated that discontent. The Sequestration Act of 1861 called for the seizure and sale of the property of \\"alien enemies\\" and those who aided them. This was to fund the Richmond government, but the lion's share of procured funds in North Texas were absorbed by the local authorities. War taxes — in effect a year before they were law in the Confederacy — and impressment of local firearms and men were hated, but most offensive was conscription, passed 16 April 1862.McCaslin 1994, pp. 35–38, 39–40 In April, 30 men of Cooke County formed a Union League and signed a petition to Richmond objecting to the government's policy of exempting large slaveholders from the draft. A \\"Peace Party\\" was still active, although the state had joined the Confederacy by this time. Its members pledged to resist Confederate conscription. Area slaveholders claimed to fear that the group was colluding with pro-Union forces from out of state and notified local authorities about the incidents. Trials, executions, and lynchings Site of the Great Hanging, 2016 On the morning of October 1, 1862, state troops led by the local provost, Colonel James G. Bourland, began arresting suspected Unionists in the area. Some 150 men were arrested in 13 days.McCaslin 1994, p. 73 Nearly 200 were ultimately arrested. Bourland appointed Col. William Young, also a major slaveholder, to appoint a jury. He formed a \\"Citizens Court\\" of 12 jurors (seven were slaveholders) in Gainesville, the county seat. This \\"court\\" had no legal status in Texas law. Bourland and Young together had reason to want to suppress dissent, as they owned more than one-quarter of all slaves in the county. The jury began trying the suspects for insurrection and treason, with conviction by a simple majority vote.McCaslin 1994, p. 74 After eight convictions, the jury decided to require a two-thirds majority vote for conviction. This resulted in reversal of the last conviction.McCaslin 1994, p. 76 Those convicted were sentenced to be hanged within two days. Some were executed within hours.McCaslin 1994, pp. 81–3 After the jury acquitted several men, a mob threatened to lynch all of the remaining prisoners. The head of the jury gave them 14 names. These men were taken from jail and, without benefit of any trial, were lynched on October 12 and 13. The court adjourned.McCaslin 1994, pp. 81–3 On October 16, Colonel William C. Young, who some say had attempted to moderate the proceedings, was killed while pursuing a group who had killed another man along a creek. Young's death resulted in public outrage, as some feared abolitionists had killed him. Two jurors who had left were replaced on the jury by hard-line Confederates. The jury reversed the acquittals of 19 prisoners, although hearing no new evidence. They convicted the men and sentenced them to death. These 19 were hanged, with their executions supervised by Capt. Jim Young, the son of the colonel. The court released 50 to 60 men before Confederate and state courts finally halted its activities altogether.McCaslin 1994, pp. 84–6 A total of 41 men had been hanged in Gainesville in October 1862, and at least three others were shot to death.McCaslin 1994, p. 94 They left \\"42 widows and about 300 children.\\" Reaction Texas newspapers and Governor Francis Richard Lubbock praised the hangings. Pressure increased on dissenters in the state and the military was responsible for more deaths. Northern newspapers treated the events at Gainesville as an outrage when they learned of them later. President Jefferson Davis remained silent, having already dismissed General Paul Octave Hébert on October 10 as military commander of Texas for his imposition of martial law and harsh measures in enforcing conscription. Confederate law had no punishment for men who failed to report for the draft.McCaslin, \\"Great Hanging of Texas\\"McCaslin 1994, p. 113 Davis felt Hébert did not sufficiently control local commanders and provosts, and had allowed military atrocities to take place.Parker & Boyd, 16 October 2012 He appointed General John Bankhead Magruder to try to bring the state under control.Texas Library and Archives Commission, Under the Rebel Flag Troubles continued for a time in North Texas, though, with hundreds of families fleeing the state to escape the violence and chaos. \\"Military commanders alternately helped lynch mobs or tried to quell them.\\" In Decatur, Capt. John Hill supervised the hanging of five men. A group of men was arrested in Sherman, Texas, but Brig. Gen. James W. Throckmorton intervened and was able to save all but five who had already been lynched. Separately in Sherman, E. Junius Foster, the editor of the Sherman Patriot, was murdered by Capt. Jim Young, the son of the late Col. Young, for publicly \\"applauding the death of his father.\\" In Denton, another partisan shot a prisoner dead. Legacy Gainesville War Memorial, Leonard Park A state historical marker erected by the Texas Historical Commission in 1964, during the Civil War centennial commemorations, defends the arrest and execution of these 42 men. It claims the \\"Peace Party\\" had \\"sworn to destroy their government, kill their leaders, and bring in federal troops.\\" The speediness of the trial is defended as necessary due to \\"fears of rescue.\\" This narrative is known to have been based on incomplete material, as records had been lost or misplaced. Controversy about the event has continued in the 21st century. Gainesville, a city of 16,000, was named in 2012 by Rand McNally as \\"the most patriotic small town in America\\". That year, the Cooke County Heritage Society planned an October event in Gainesville to mark the 150th anniversary of the Great Hanging, as part of Civil War history. It was cancelled after the mayor objected to marketing about it. The city provides funding to the society's museum, and directors feared losing support. The mayor wanted to emphasize the city's new \\"patriotic\\" status and the annual Depot Days, instead. Descendants of the victims of the hanging were angry that the event would not be acknowledged. A member of the Cooke County Heritage Society said, \\"Gainesville has been hiding from the Great Hanging since it happened.\\"Star Telegram, 8 October 2012 Colleen Carri, a heritage society board member, decided to combine the commemoration with the annual Clark family reunion already planned for October 13. She expected 220 attendees, including descendants of six other hanging victims. They called the event \\"Remembering Our Past, Embracing Our Future.\\" Richard B. McCaslin, a history professor at University of North Texas, was scheduled as a speaker at the event. He wrote Tainted Breeze: The Great Hanging at Gainesville, Texas 1862 (1994), considered the \\"first comprehensive study\\" of this event. At the same time, members of the local chapter of Sons of Confederate Veterans, who include some descendants of hanged men, had created a video, Black October 1862. They said some of the victims were not innocent but \\"traitors\\" for passing information to the enemy. McCaslin says no evidence was found of such activities. The SCV planned to screen their film October 13, 2012 at the Masonic Lodge in Gainesville. Some people in the city have led annual commemorations since 2007. A memorial for the victims of the Great Hangings was privately constructed in 2014. Consisting of two 5- x 6-ft granite slabs, it was installed at a small park, which had been donated to the city near the site of the hangings. One slab is inscribed with the names of the 42 victims; the other gives a full account of events, based on documented history.Texas Observer, 17 November 2014 See also * Marais des Cygnes massacre * Nueces massacre Notes References Further reading   * External links * Category:Texas in the American Civil War Category:Capital punishment in Texas Category:Political repression in the United States Category:19th-century executions of American people Category:Gainesville, Texas Category:Riots and civil disorder in Texas Category:1862 in Texas Category:Massacres of the American Civil War Category:Confederate war crimes Category:October 1862 events ","title":"Great Hanging at Gainesville"},{"id":"40208937","text":"Puerto Rico Airport (, ) is a public airport serving Puerto Rico, in the Pando Department of Bolivia.

History The keel was laid in Richmond, Maine. She was registered there in 1880 after having been launched in November 1879. Abandonment The Jamestown left Maine on 10 November, 1880, bound for Liverpool carrying a cargo of high- quality lumber. No sooner was the ship out of port than four of the crew jumped ship, and Captain William E. Whitmore had to find replacements. Then a windlass broke and the ship had to stop in Eastport, Maine for repairs. Finally underway across the Atlantic in early December, the ship encountered heavy seas and the rudder was torn away. After being battered by the seas for several weeks, the captain and crew were rescued by the Anchor Line steamer Ethiopia and left the Jamestown to drift at . In total, 27 people were rescued, including the captain's wife and child. (Apparently also published in Skjoeldur Issue No. 34. Vol. 10. No. 4, 2001.) The crew arrived safely in Glasgow on 16 February 1881, but their ship didn't reach its final resting place for another four months. On the morning of 26 June, residents of Hafnir woke to find that the enormous vessel had run aground the night before. The cargo of timber was particularly valuable in Iceland, which suffered almost complete deforestation in the several hundred years following the initial Viking settlement in 874. As such, the cargo was unloaded and one third of it was reserved for those who had participated in the salvage operation. The rest was auctioned off, bringing in about DKK 10,000. This is equivalent to US$62,000 in 2012 dollars.Take DKK 10,000 and divide by 3.73 based on the DKK/USD exchange rate in 1881. Then calculate the equivalent in 2012 dollars using the Measuring Worth website. Aftermath In October 1881, the wreck of the Jamestown was visited by George H. Wadleigh, Commander of the . He wrote a report to the United States Navy explaining the ship's location and condition. The Alliance was passing through Iceland on its way to look for survivors from the ill-fated Jeannette expedition which had also been wrecked that June.

The bridge represented a major engineering achievement that was unique in the region at the time. The bridge was of great strategic importance during the first half of the 20th century and was repeatedly damaged and repaired as a result. Structure The bridge has 11 pillars and 12 spans with a total length of 1255.20 meter and a width 9.4 meters. History The bridge was a conceived as a key infrastructure element for the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. On January 13, 1908 the Qing government signed the \\"Tianjin Pukou Railway Loan Agreement\\". Work on the railway was split between German and British companies. The Luokou Yellow River Railway Bridge was part of the German portion that ran from Tianjin to Hanzhuang in Shandong and had a length of 626 km. The site of the bridge was selected after careful exploration and was placed at a site where the course of the Yellow river was constrained by Que Hill to the north and an existing dam to the south. The bridge was built by MAN (M.A.N.-Werk Gustavsburg bei Mainz), with the contract being signed on August 12, 1908 and the groundbreaking ceremony held on October 15 in the same year. Construction work began in July 1909 and was completed on November 16, 1912 when the official opening ceremony was held. The total construction cost for the bridge was 11.66 million German marks. In 1928, during the Northern Expedition, the local warlord Zhang Zongchang, an ally of the Manchurian warlord Zhang Zuolin, tried to halt the Kuomintang forces by detonating explosives at the 8th pillar. The pillar was damaged over a length of 3.8 meters, but the bridge was repaired within eight months. In 1930, during the Central Plains War the bridge was again damaged by artillery fire exchanged between the troops of Chiang Kai-shek on one side and the troops of Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang on the other. The artillery shells damaged many steel beams. In 1931, the Jin-Pu Railway Administration repaired the bridge at a total cost of 26,700 yuan. In November 1937, the bridge was severely damaged again by explosives when the Kuomintang governor Han Fuju tried to halt the advance of the Japanese troops after evacuating his own forces south of the Yellow River. When the Japanese forces attacked the northern bridge head, more than 50 villagers that lived around Que Hill were killed (). In January 1938, the repair work on bridge was undertaken by a Japanese car company. The work lasted for six months, cost a total of 3.76 million yuan, and involved 4,000 tons of steel. The last time the bridge was damaged in fighting was in February 1949, during Chinese Civil War, when Kuomintang aircraft fired on the bridge and inflicted minor damage that was easily repaired. The bridge was in danger again during the Yellow River flood of 1958, when Premier Zhou Enlai rushed to Jinan on August 6 to spur on the defense of the bridge. In 1959, a major overhaul of the bridge was undertaken. During the second half of the twentieth century the Beijing–Shanghai railway was gradually duplicated and options for duplication of the tracks at the Yellow River began to be considered in 1958. Although the bridge had originally been designed for two tracks, it was not considered structurally sound to support two tracks. A new bridge, the Caojiaquan Yellow River Bridge to carry the Beijing–Shanghai railway, was completed on 39 June 1976. On 21 April 1991, the bridge was closed for passenger trains, because of the dangers posed by silt that had built up around it. However, in the following year (1992) it was decided to build a new railway line between Jinan and Handan and to investigate further use of the Luokou Yellow River Railway Bridge. As a result, work on reinforcing the bridge began in 1998 and the bridge was again opened to traffic on May 31, 2000.

The bout took place on June 28, 2008 at the Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. Pacquiao defeated Diaz via technical knockout in the ninth round. The fight sealed Pacquiao's status as the best pound-for-pound fighter after he was elevated to the #1 spot because of the retirement of the undefeated five-division champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. weeks prior to the fight and put Pacquiao's name in the history books as the only Asian fighter to win five world titles in five weight classes. Full Boxing match Watch: http://bit.ly/2Y3MwoU  Background  Pacquiao came into the fight following a close bout on March 2008 split decision victory over Juan Manuel Marquez for a super featherweight title. Top Rank CEO Bob Arum matched Pacquiao against Diaz when Pacquiao decided to move up to lightweight division. Diaz, the WBC champion made his last 2 title defense by beating Ramon Montano and Pacquiao's most recent conqueror, Erik Morales, via unanimous decision in August 2007.  Fight summary and aftermath  Pacquiao was stronger and faster than Diaz, pounding him with big punches from the first round on. Early in the bout, Pacquiao would step in and rip off three and four punch combinations at a time. He cut the nose of Diaz in the second round and a few rounds later he opened a gash above the right eye of Diaz, turning the fight into a bloody affair. The cut was bad enough to prompt the referee to have the doctor look at it twice during the fight. Pacquiao hurt Diaz with an uppercut in round eight and in the ninth round, a jab followed by a left hand that Diaz never saw coming, sent him down face first to the mat and the referee jumped in to stop the action. Having The Ring and WBC super featherweight titles as well as the latter's lightweight version, Pacquiao decided to vacate his super featherweight titles. Light welterweight champion Ricky Hatton is eyed by Pacquiao as his next opponent.  Business  Arum reported that the fight had made 12.5 million dollars (250,000 pay-per-view subscriptions at $49.95 each), earning Diaz his best payday of 850,000 dollars, whilst Pacquiao earned at least 3 million dollar.

His nickname comes from a large locust invasion of the country that happened during his reign ( most probably in 1539) and led to harvest loss, and famine. Stephen was born after July 1496 in the capital city of Suceava, as the posthumous son of his father Alexandru of Moldavia, then the older son and heir of Stephen III the Great. His mother was Maria Asenina-Palaiologina a native Constantinopolitan of Byzantine imperial heritage. About 1–2 years after his birth due to succession for the throne ambitions by his step grand-mother, Maria Voichița (3rd wife of Stephen III) who wanted to secure it to her son Bogdan-Vlad (future Bogdan III the One- Eyed), his mom takes him back to Constantinople where he will spend most part of his life before acceding to the throne at age 42. Based on his maternal origin and uprising in the Christian community of Constantinople as well as his direct nomination by the sultan he can be considered the first Phanariote ruler of Moldavia.Matei Cazacu - Strategies Matrimoniales et Politique des Cantacuzenes de la Turcocratie - Revue des Etudes Roumaines vol XIX-XX 1995-1996 In the summer of 1538 he is appointed by sultan Suleiman the Magnificent as \\"Voievode & Hospodar\\" of Moldavia and he will participate in the campaign against his predecessor & uncle Petru IV Rareş.

As punishment for his predecessor's disobedience Suleiman also annexed the fortress of Tighina with surrounding area, a further territorial loss for Moldavia after prior conquest of Kilia & Cetatea Alba (Asprokastron) in 1484. This extended country's vulnerability to attacks from South-West& caused discontent among the boyar elite and wider population. However otherwise the sultan renews Moldavia's autonomy & self rule and keeps unchanged the tribute at 10,000 gold coins annually.Cu privire la domnia lui Stefan Lacusta, by Acad. Ioan A Pop His reign was noted mostly for the financial difficulties brought on by the locust invasion, but he appears to have made the best efforts to renew diplomatic relations with Hungary & Poland and, at the end of summer of 1540, took an increasing antiOttoman stance and even sanctioned a raid against Tighina which resulted in the death of about 150 Ottomans & confiscation's per Polish contemporary accounts, of about 68,000 sheep. In the meantime his ousted predecessor Petru IV Rareş after public supplication in front of the sultan and after having paid the biggest bribe yet for a Romanian prince is re- appointed in early December by Suleiman after he received the news of Moldavian raid against his subjects.Cu privire la domnia lui Stefan Lacusta, by Acad.

They will receive their punishment soon thereafter once Petru reached Suceava, although in between these 2 events there will be a 5-6 week rule by Alexandru Cornea, another grandson of Stephen III the Great. Stephen V is the first ruler of Moldavia assassinated by his boyars. Stephen's V wife, Cheajna (who's origin and age we don't have information), was pardoned & she was allowed to retain quarters within the princely palace but she had passed months thereafter and was interred at the Bistrița Monastery where Stephen V himself might have been buried as well.Rezachevici, Constantin (2001).

Personal life Walter Matthew Gallichan was born in St. Helier, Jersey, the son of John Gallichan, an antiques dealer, and his wife, Elizabeth, a music teacher. After his family moved to Reading, Berkshire, he was educated there privately. Gallichan married multiple times. He was married firstly in 1889 to Ada Elizabeth White, daughter of Henry White the librarian of the Royal Society until her death in 1895. In March 1901 he was recorded in the Welsh census as being married to a \\"Mary Gallichan\\", but six weeks later he is recorded as marrying the author and art historian Catherine Gasquoine Hartley at Chelsea Registry Office in London. Hartley and Gallichan divorced in 1915. In February 1916 he married for the final time, again in London, to divorcee Norah Kathleen Finberg (née Mutch). After his divorce Gallichan's marriage to Hartley was glossed over in his Who's Who entry, which only listed his marriages to White and Mutch, and this version of his marital situation was also followed later by The Times in his obituary. In 1934 Gallichan was awarded a Civil List pension. He died on 27 November 1946 in Weston-super- Mare, Somerset. Career Gallichan made his name as a journalist, being one of the earliest members of the staff of the Daily Mail, and was later a pioneer in sex education in Britain. Gallichan's earliest works were released under the pseudonym Geoffrey Mortimer, including a number of novels and some essays on sex and morality. Several of his early non-fiction works were published by the so-called University Press of Watford. This controversial publisher was known for publishing contentious material, and had been prosecuted for obscenity after its 1897 publication of Havelock Ellis's Sexual Inversion. His works covered a very wide variety of subjects, from outdoor pursuits and ornithology to eugenics and criticism of the women's movement. His work on outdoor pursuits were particularly concerned with his personal interests in angling and bird-watching in Britain and abroad. His contemporary political works included his 1909 objection to the women's movement, entitled Modern Woman and How to Manage Her, and his 1929 work on eugenics, The Sterilization of the Unfit. In addition to these works, however, he also wrote extensively on sex education and marriage during the 1920s, publishing A Text- Book of Sex Education for Parents and Teachers in 1919, Youth and Maidenhood, or, Sex Knowledge for Young People in 1920, and later works like Sexual Apathy and Coldness in Women (1927) and The Poison of Prudery (1929). His later works were released with titles that were intentionally designed to seek controversy. Although he released five novels over his lifetime these received little critical notice and he is mostly remembered for his journalism and his controversial essays. =Works= Fiction * (1895).

The Tyson–Tillman fight was the second fight of a doubleheader event that also featured George Foreman taking on Adilson Rodrigues. The fight Tyson charged at Tillman once the opening bell sounded, causing Tillman to quickly retreat. Tillman offered very little offense during the fight, instead spending the first minute of the fight circling the ring in an effort to avoid Tyson's powerful punches. Tyson eventually caught up to Tillman and began throwing powerful combinations at Tillman, causing Tillman to clinch several times whenever Tyson would mount a substantial amount of offense. With around 25 seconds left in the round, Tyson trapped Tillman in the corner. Tillman attempted to throw a jab, but Tyson countered with a strong right hand that dropped Tillman to the mat.

The anime has been licensed by Funimation in North America, Madman Entertainment in Australia and by Anime Limited in the United Kingdom. The series premiered in the United States before Japan on January 4, 2014 at 11:30 pm on Adult Swim's Toonami block. The series began airing in Japan on Tokyo MX at 11:00 pm on January 5, 2014, followed by TV Osaka, TV Aichi, BS Fuji and AT-X. The series is simulcasted in South East Asia at the same time as Japan on Animax Asia. The series has also been broadcast in Australia on SBS 2 since 3 October 2015.

The 13 episodes of the first season aired from January to March 2014, and the second season (also with 13 episodes) premiered on July 5, 2014. Plot The space opera follows the misadventures of Dandy, an alien bounty hunter who is \\"a dandy guy in space\\", in search for undiscovered and rare aliens with his robot assistant QT and his feline-like friend named Meow. Though he and his crew act with the best intentions, despite being normally dimwitted and next to useless, Dandy is unaware that he is being pursued by Dr. Gel of the Gogol Empire. The series has loose continuity, with several episodes featuring the main protagonists and antagonists dying, getting turned into zombies, or getting trapped in different dimensions for periods of time, only for them to show up as normal in the next episode. There are also many references to older science fiction, music, anime and Internet culture. Characters The crew of the Aloha Oe. From left to right: Dandy, Meow, and QT. ; : :Space Dandy is an easygoing and forgetful young man working as an alien hunter whose job is to discover new alien life forms across the galaxy and have them registered with the Space Alien Registration Center. He is the captain of the , his personal spaceship. The cockpit of the Aloha Oe can split off into an escape pod dubbed the and it displays the ability to transform into a robot called the . Dandy regularly visits an intergalactic Hooters-type restaurant known as where he indulges in his posterior fetish and dreams of someday buying out the franchise. Dandy is also shown to have many hidden talents, including being a prodigal surfer capable of surfing on abstract concepts such as time and having a deep understanding of physics, such as figuring that when a person \\"warps\\" on ships, they are actually moving their consciousness to a universe that is slightly further ahead in the same timeline rather than moving to a different area of the same universe. Unbeknownst to him, Dandy is targeted by the Gogol Empire due to his connection to a reality-defying element called pyonium. Ultimately, after the universe comes to an end, Dandy is revealed to be, unbeknownst to even himself, an omnipresent figure who exists in any and all hypothetical timelines (with his various skillsets belonging to other previous Dandies). Dandy is then told by the current God that the nature of his existence means that he is to replace him as the god of the new multiverse, an order which Dandy turns down (because as a bodyless god, he wouldn't be able to go to BooBies), leaving the current universe with the words \\"Stay dandy, baby.\\" The series ends where it began (with Dandy and QT heading to BooBies, where they will meet Meow for the first time), except Dandy has retained his memories from the previous multiverse. Dandy then wonders if his many adventures have changed him, and asks himself if he is still the same person that he once was. ; : :A member of Dandy's crew, a robot that resembles and also operates as a vacuum cleaner. QT boasts being more intelligent and competent than its fellow crewmates, but its usefulness is stymied by problems caused by its outdated hardware such as memory shortages and battery outages. Despite being feminine in voice and some of its mannerisms, QT is referred to as a male by Dandy and Meow on several occasions and seems to self-identify as such. It is capable of feeling a wide range of emotions, but for the most part sees them as confusing, extraneous, and unnecessary for computing. QT is also obsessed with everything being peaceful and orderly, and as a result is shown to be an avid fisher due to the zen-like nature of it. QT is also shown to be capable of feeling love, having fallen in love with a sentient coffee making robot in the season one finale, but gave up after it realized the robot was itself in love with the store's sentient cash register, who QT was forced to fight to after the register turned out to be part of an anti-human extremist terror organization. QT is then shown drinking a cup of coffee in remembrance of its lost love. QT appears with Dandy in the new universe, unaware of the adventures that they have yet to undertake and acting puzzled by Dandy's sudden introspection. ; : :A dimwitted cat-like who is brought aboard the Aloha Oe after Dandy and QT mistake him for a new species of alien. His real name is Me#$%* (pronounced Merowmreowreow), and is called Mew by his friends back at home. His name, \\"Meow\\", is given to him by Dandy as neither he nor QT could comprehend his real name. Aside from lounging around the Aloha Oe, he aids Dandy by giving him advice on where to find rare aliens through social media, to varying degrees of success. Meow also displays many earth cat-like tendencies, such as an aversion to dogs, spending an entire episode angrily shunning a dog-like alien, before breaking down in tears when she died after he realized that she still liked him despite his spiteful attitude towards her. Meow comes from a family lineage of metalworkers, and was set to inherit the family company before leaving Betelgeuse to become an alien hunter due to his frustration at living a monotonous existence, but after spending time there with Dandy and QT while caught in a timeloop, Meow learns to appreciate his home and family. ; : :A gorilla-like scientist working for the Gogol Empire, Dr. Gel endlessly pursues Dandy from his spaceship, which resembles the head of the Statue of Liberty with a ball gag in her mouth that can attach to a robot body. However, despite getting close to capturing Dandy on some occasions, Gel always ends up failing in a humiliating fashion or going down with his ship. Once Gel captured Dandy, he ends being fatally wounded by Bea and lives long enough to see the universe undone. His character resembles Jet Black from Cowboy Bebop. and Dr. Gori from Spectreman ; : :Dr. Gel's right-hand assistant, a diminutive alien whose head resembles an eggplant. In reality, Bea is actually an agent of the Jaicro Empire who spied on the Gogol Empire until he betrays both factions once Dandy is captured with the intention to become a god. However, Bea gets crushed to death by Gel after Bea fatally shot him. ; : :The ruler of the , which is at war with the Jaicro Empire for control of the universe. He sends Dr. Gel to capture Dandy, claiming he is the key to the future of the universe. His public appearance is that of a skull-headed figure with miniature \\"planets\\" orbiting around his head while there is a cosmos within his cloak, it is a hologram that conceals his true appearance: a middle aged human in a business suit. ; : :A blonde-haired \\"blockhead\\" whose actual name is Lady Nobra and is half-Cloudian. Working as a waitress, or , at the BooBies restaurant, or rather , Honey seems to enjoy the Aloha Oe crew's usual visits all the time. While captured by Dr. Gel, Honey's lineage is revealed while Dandy attempted to go after her older half-brother Gentle Nobra, who in turn launched an attack on Gel's ship that destroyed his cloud while she escaped harm in midst the chaos similar of the same name of honey cutey. ; : :A collected, no nonsense inspector at the space alien registration center tasked with evaluating the aliens brought by Dandy and paying him accordingly when he brings her a worthy specimen. She is also a skilled fighter and can easily see through Dandy's tricks when he attempts to deceive her. She also has shown romantic interest in Dandy on more than one occasion throughout the series, along with a history of failed romances that include her stalker ex-boyfriend Dolph. ; : :Johnny is the commander of the Jaicro Empire, a rival of the Gogol Empire. Also revealed to be an aspiring musician, concealing his identity from them, Johnny once formed a rock band with the Aloha Oe crew called the \\"Dropkix.\\" Though their band was short lived and remembered as a one-hit wonder, Johnny's responsibility to the Dropkix indirectly lead to a cessation of hostilities between the two empires. When news of Dandy's capture reaches him, Johnny leads an attack on the Gogol Empire before being erased along with the universe. ; : :Professor Duran is a Jaicro imperial scientist who specializes in researching Pyonium energy. He was brought before the court during Dandy's trial when he found evidence of the supposed murder was revealed to have a Pyonium influence, he realizes that Dandy was more than he appeared and reported his capture to Johnny. ; : :The omnipotent and omniscient being that narrates the show, which is revealed in the final episode to be \\"God\\". The Narrator observed the crew's misadventures, sometimes telepathically interacting with the characters. In the finale, beginning to fade away as the universe is undone, the Narrator attempted to have Dandy replace him as the God of the new universe, but is shocked when Dandy refuses before completely fading from existence.

Other media =Manga= A manga adaptation began serialization in Square Enix's Young Gangan magazine on December 20, 2013. The first tankōbon volume was released on March 25, 2014. Yen Press licensed the series for release in North America, with the first volume released on June 28, 2016, and the second volume released on September 27, 2016. =Video game= A video game Space Galaga (based on the arcade game Galaga) was released on Android on January 24, 2014 and on iOS on February 6, 2014. Reception The series received generally positive reviews. Writer Alasdair Wilkins of the A.V. Club gave Space Dandy a B+, stating: \\"This is a proudly frivolous show, one that delights in its juvenile sense of humor and sneers at the very idea of an ongoing storyline. The show is a surreal throwback to a bygone era of science fiction, like an old Flash Gordon serial or a wacky Superman comic from the Silver Age – if the heroic protagonist were obsessed with butts and breasts. That doesn't mean Space Dandy is a disappointment.\\" Paul and Caroline Daley of Three If By Space wrote, \\"Dandy himself both in look and personality, combines Elvis Presley, Zap Brannigan, and Han Solo. While Dandy may come off inept or silly at times, he often does possess the skill needed to save the day (or at least their skins). This makes him very watchable because you never know which Dandy you’ll get.\\" and \\"Space Dandy feels like a throw-back. No, not like throw it back, like something out of another time. The bright colors, the music, and especially the main character, the titular Space Dandy, all remind me of a time when adventures didn’t have to make total sense and political correctness wasn’t really a thing yet.\\" Brandon Postal of Capsule Computers gave Space Dandy Season 1 Blu-Ray a 7.5 rating and wrote, \\"Space Dandy is a fun romp but not exceptionally so. It’s an enjoyable look at Japanese comedic portrayals of different science fiction tropes and styles, but ultimately only good for laughs. If you’re looking for a hard sci-fi series, or even a comedy with a strong narrative, then you might want to look somewhere else. Funimation has done a good job with the dub, making this enjoyable for a wide range of anime fans. I enjoyed some of the characterizations and the takes on various science fiction tropes. I would recommend giving this a watch as long as you don’t take it seriously.\\" Laurent Backman of Slug Magazine wrote in a Space Dandy Season 2 DVD Review, \\"Space Dandy is just such a show. It’s over the top, at times crass, nonsensical, and seeing as it comes from the creative team behind Cowboy Bebop, not without its fair share of great music.\\" and \\"There’s not much over-arching narrative for the season, and episodes are their own self- contained storylets, but the formula works perfectly, letting Space Dandy mess around with a bunch of different ideas while never straying too far from its strong comedy backbone.\\" References External links * (Japanese) *Funimation's Official Space Dandy Page (English) * Category:2013 manga Category:2014 anime television series Category:2014 video games Category:Adventure anime and manga Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Anime with original screenplays Category:AT-X (TV network) original programming Category:Bandai Namco franchises Category:Bandai Visual Category:Bones (studio) Category:Comedy anime and manga Category:Fixed shooters Category:Funimation Category:Gangan Comics manga Category:IOS games Category:Science fiction anime and manga Category:Seinen manga Category:Tokyo MX original programming Category:Toonami Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Yen Press titles Category:Space Western anime and manga ","title":"Space Dandy"},{"id":"40209853","text":"Colombia is competing at the 2013 World Championships in Athletics in Moscow, Russia, from 10–18 August 2013.

It was located just off State Route 9, about 2 miles (3 kilometers) south of the city of Piedmont. Approximate coordinates were (33.887824, -85.626027). Built around 1900 (although some sources say it was built in the 1908), the 61-foot (19-meter) covered bridge was a rare construction of Multiple King-post truss with Town Lattice over a single span. The Coldwater Covered Bridge, also located in Calhoun County, has a similar resemblance. Its WGCB number is 01-08-03. The bridge was originally located near Wellington, Alabama and moved to its current location in 1975. Unfortunately, no additional information regarding the Tallahatchee Covered Bridge is mentioned since that period. It was shown on a list of covered bridges published by the Alabama Historical Commission in either the late 1970s or early 1980s. No date was on the document. There is a possibility that the bridge may still be in private use today although no specifics are currently available. It was originally maintained by the Calhoun County Commission. History The Tallahatchee Covered Bridge was built over Tallasseehatchee Creek (also called Tallahatchee Creek) by county bridge builder Jim P. Nunnally, with the help of Mose A. Prickett, on what is now Old Sulphur Springs Road southeast of Wellington (Coordinates (33.815959, -85.873202))...a couple miles off U.S. Route 431. This was about 23 miles (37 kilometers) southwest of the current location. Concrete piers were added to support the bridge in 1908. The covered bridge was open to motor vehicle traffic, primarily for local farm use, until a modern low hip steel bridge bypassed it in 1954. Having high tourist potential due to its unique construction, the Tallahatchee Covered Bridge was semi-preserved by the Calhoun County Commission although it had slowly decayed over the years due to its remote location and lack of public concern. A deed offer was made to both the Alabama Historical Commission and the Calhoun County Historical Society, but it wasn't until 20 years later when the bridge once again had significant interest. Brothers Larry K. Martin and Stanley M. Martin, formerly of Anniston, Alabama, purchased the bridge for their Nances Creek Restoration Project just south of Piedmont on an 80-acre tract along Choccolocco Mountain. The bridge would eventually span a pond near the creek once completed. Preparations were made for transportation in late November 1974, but inclement weather delayed the venture until the following year. In early September 1975, the Tallahatchee Covered Bridge was moved by tractor trailer from Wellington to Piedmont and placed in a pasture near Nances Creek to become part of a reconstructed pioneer village and Appalachian crafts center. The Martin brothers had already begun preserving other historic items within the South prior to this acquisition as part of their settlement. It has been made clear though that the Nances Creek Restoration Project could take a number of years to be fully completed. Currently, no information about the Tallahatchee Covered Bridge after the move or of its continued existence is mentioned. The property location is privately owned and should be respected. Photos of the Tallahatchee Covered Bridge can be found on ADAH Digital Collections (linked below). The Old Union Crossing Covered Bridge near Mentone, Alabama has also been called the Tallahatchee Covered Bridge, but this is actually a different bridge. An older landmark originally located near Lincoln, Alabama, it was moved to Lookout Mountain in 1972.

Starring Lucas Till, Crystal Reed, and Sarah Bolger, it follows a popular high school student portrayed by Till who finds himself being stalked. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States on April 9, 2013. It received mixed reviews from critics and generated $8.12 million over a $1.2 million budget. Plot High school student Scott gains popularity among his classmates for his prowess on the soccer field, which he seeks to turn into an athletic scholarship. Although he possesses artistic talent, Scott continues to focus on soccer, even after a leg injury threatens to jeopardize his playing days. His best friend Jules harbors romantic feelings for him, but Scott resists her advances to prevent ruining their friendship. Also romantically interested in Scott is Bess, a shy student who recognizes his artistic abilities. Bess herself becomes a love interest of her classmate Jeffrey, although she does not return his feelings as she develops an unhealthy obsession with Scott. An unknown stalker emerges in Scott's life, who begins demonstrating disturbing behavior. The stalker's actions turn violent when Mrs. Brown, a teacher who flirted with Scott, is attacked and seriously injured, while Jules is nearly killed by the stalker during a party. Scott suspects Bess is responsible, aware of her feelings for him, but recognizes that he cannot prove that she is his stalker. Later, while driving, Scott accidentally hits Bess' co-worker Andie and offers to take her home upon noticing that she sustained a leg injury. However, Andie knocks Scott out when he enters her house, revealing herself as the stalker, before trapping him in her basement. Scott attempts to escape after he awakens, but Andie agitates his leg injury. After Andie kills her boss David when he arrives at the house, Scott makes another escape attempt and manages to crawl out of the basement, despite sustaining further leg injuries. Bess visits the house soon afterwards, where she discovers Scott and David's body, prompting Andie to attack her. Although Andie gets the upper hand, Jeffrey shows up to help overpower her and Scott kicks Andie into the basement, knocking her out. Unable to play soccer because of his injuries, Scott begins to work on applying for art school while he enters into a relationship with Jules. Bess and Jeffrey also begin their own relationship. Andie is visited by her attorney Mr. Graham, to whom she admits her killings began at an early age and warns that she will not remain in custody for long. Cast * Lucas Till as Scott * Crystal Reed as Bess * Sarah Bolger as Jules * Caitriona Balfe as Andie ** Ashleigh Craig as Young Andie * Reid Ewing as Jeffrey * Leigh Whannell as David * Holt McCallany as Mike * Derrick Kemp as Brock * Camille Guaty as Mrs. Brown * Michael Landes as Mr. Graham * Isaiah Mustafa as Coach Evans Additionally, Meredith Salenger appears as Bess' mother and Nikki SooHoo appears as Maya. Cody Hamilton portrays the boy killed by Andie at the beginning of the film. Critical reception Writing for FEARnet, Scott Weinberg praised the acting of the three leads but criticized the film's \\"paper-thin premise\\" and script for being derivative (pointing out Mallhi's previous work on 2011's The Roommate), and said \\"Even putting aside the casual plagiarism in Mallhi's screenplays, there's nothing here in the way of character, suspense, intensity, or surprises. It's just someone telling the same old story with slightly different character.\\" Ian Sedensky of Culture Crypt gave the film a score of 45/100 and judged: \\"The young cast is attractive, the production is well put together, and the twist, however absurd, might be genuinely shocking and entertaining to some. But this is a movie about a crush. And buying into the thin motivations behind this obsession requires a level of crazy reserved exclusively for the characters in this movie.\\" John Strand of Best-Horror-Movies awarded the film 2.5/5 \\"Freakheads\\" (the site's rating system), and concluded the film is \\"A neat little thriller that will appeal to teens and young adults who are not interested in scares and gore, but like a fairly executed, albeit predictable, storyline.\\" References External links  Category:2010s thriller films Category:2013 direct-to-video films Category:2013 films Category:Direct- to-video thriller films Category:Intrepid Pictures films Category:Backwoods slasher films Category:American slasher films Category:American films ","title":"Crush (2013 film)"},{"id":"40209966","text":"The Legend of Buddha is a 2004 Indian animated film directed by Shamboo Falke, produced by Stalin Saravanan and written by Caarthick Raju and Ramesh Karthikeyan.

The twenty-first episode of the series is written by Mark Richard and directed by David Von Ancken. In the episode, Cullen Bohannon attempts to obtain engineer control of the Union Pacific Railroad, while an imprisoned Thomas C. Durant (Colm Meaney) wishes to prevent that. Elam (Common) and Eva (Robin McLeavy) welcome their new baby. Plot Alone in his snow-covered burned-out caboose, Cullen hallucinates seeing Doc Whitehead (Grainger Hines), who tells him that his candle will soon go out. Cullen runs outside to a riverbank, splashes water on his face, and hears a wolf howl. Cullen fends off its attack and scares it off. Cullen finds the train engineer frozen to death and takes his tobacco pipe. He then walks to the train engine, breaks ice away, and starts a fire in its firebox. With the engine cranked up, he drives it away from the destroyed town. He arrives in Omaha, Nebraska and describes Elam and Eva to ask their location. He finds a shotgun in his face when he knocks on Elam's door. A very-pregnant Eva lies on a bed behind Elam. Cullen orders him to accompany him to New York or lose his place on the railroad. Eva insists Elam go as they need the work. In New York City, Clement Beale (Ben Ratner), Secretary of Crédit Mobilier, greets Cullen and Elam with news that the Chief Engineer position has already been filled. Cullen has Clement take him to see Thomas Durant in Hudson Prison, where Cullen asks Durant to vouch for him to Crédit Mobilier. Durant refuses. They won't listen to him and, besides, Cullen is not a Yankee. Cullen buys new suits for himself and Elam. The Irish shop owner tells Cullen where to find railroad workers. At the Credit Mobilier office, Congressman Ames tells Cullen the job belongs to Senator Metcalf's (Wayne Duvall) son-in-law. A determined Cullen presents the board with detailed plans and designs. He is awarded the job with Union Pacific stock as payment. He and Elam talk with Three Piece Duffy (Scott Michael Campbell) about hiring railroad workers. Cullen refuses Duffy's wanting gold upfront. A gang circles and Elam reaches for Cullen's gun. Cullen must get the two out of the situation. In their hotel room, Cullen reprimands Elam for grabbing his gun and mocks Elam for thinking he's truly free. They fight but are interrupted by a telegram about Eva having the baby. Cullen later enters a church. Alone, he repents for the things he's done and those he's left undone. In his cell, Durant criticizes Senator Metcalf for failure to oust Bohannon. He warns the senator that his fall will be greater if Durant is not returned to the railroad. Beale shows Cullen to Durant's former railroad car. Collis Huntington (Tim Guinee), head of Central Pacific Railroad, awaits Cullen and tells him the Union Pacific is broke. He offers Cullen an opportunity to cross the California border, promising gold as payment, but Cullen declines. At home, Elam greets his newborn daughter. At the Omaha train station, Sean McGinnes (Ben Esler) tells Cullen that the many workers arrived after hearing Cullen was back. Ruth Cole (Kasha Kropinski) prays in front of the train as Elam and Eva pack their belongings. Mickey McGinnes (Phil Burke) talks to a group of prostitutes. Durant leaves the prison in a carriage with Metcalf. Cullen tosses his hat in the air as the train takes off.

Its population was 179 as of the 2010 census. Seboyeta had a post office from February 5, 1885, to January 7, 1995. In 1746, Padre Juan Menchero persuaded several hundred members of the Navajo Tribe to settle at Cebolleta. A mission was established for the purpose of converting the Navajo to Christianity. The community was formally established in 1749, under the name of \\"Cebolleta\\", a word meaning \\"little onion.\\" It was named for the nearby Cebolleta Mountains, now called the San Mateo Mountains. But in 1750, the Navajo rejected the efforts and returned to their own lands. On January 23, 1800, Governor Fernando Chacon granted a request by Francisco Aragon and twenty-nine others who wished to settle at Cebolleta and establish a town there. Chacon ordered Alcalde Jose Manuel Aragon of the Pueblo of Laguna to formally transfer the approved area to the receivers of the grant. As New Mexico was still under the control of Spain, and the Alcalde was appointed by the Spanish king, this order had the force of a royal command. The colonists had been granted an area bordered “On the north, by the San Mateo Mountains; on the east, by the Zia Road and Pedro Padilla Valley; on the south, by the Mesa del Bagilan, which adjoins the Paquate ranch; and on the west, by the San Mateo Mountains.” In 1801, the Navajo returned, believing the land to be theirs, and forced the colonists to leave. They fled to Chihuahua, in New Spain. In 1803, the colonists were forced by the Spanish government to return to Cebolleta and ordered to remain there under penalty of death. They had accepted a grant from the Spanish king and no legal right to abandon it. In 1805, the Navajo again attacked the settlement. This second attack would have ended in a massacre, but the Laguna Tribe came to the defense of the colonists. In gratitude, the inhabitants of the Town of Cebolleta, recognized the Laguna claim to certain lands to the south, known as the Rancho de Paquate, which the colonists had previously considered their own. To smooth the negotiations, Laguna agreed to purchase the houses, barns, and other improvements the colonists had made to these lands. In 1826, after control of New Mexico had passed from Spain to the newly formed nation of Mexico, Governor Antonio Narbona formally approved the agreement with a grant to the Laguna Pueblo. In 1846, control of New Mexico passed to the United States. A military post was established at Cebolleta in 1849, but in 1862, General Edward Canby ordered this post moved to San Rafael, New Mexico, in 1862 and it was renamed Fort Wingate.Fort Wingate @NewMexicoHistory.org In 1859, the heirs of the original Spanish land grant, petitioned the United States government, in the person of Surveyor General William Pelham to recognize their claims to the land. Pelham agreed to the terms of the petition, but formal recognition required the approval of Congress. The outbreak of the Civil War delayed these proceedings until 1869. A formal patent, approving the claim, was issued on January 27, 1882. In 1885, a post office was established for the town. There were already several places using the name \\"Cebolleta\\" in the Post Office directory, so the variant spelling of Seboyeta was used instead.

O'Reilly; Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation, 1943-1945; Lexington Books; 2001; p.218 Peter Hebblethwaite wrote that, by early 1944, some 20,000 partisans had emerged from Catholic Action. Known as the \\"Green Flames\\", they were supported by sympathetic provincial clergy in the North, who pronounced the Germans to be \\"unjust invaders\\", whom it was lawful and meritorious to repel. \\"Bishops tended to be more cautious\\", wrote Hebblethwaite, Maurilio Fossati, the Cardinal Archbishop of Turin \\"visited partisan units in the mountains, heard their confessions and said Mass for them.\\"Peter Hebblethwaite; Paul VI - the First Modern Pope; Harper Collins Religious; 1993; pp.194-5 The Fiamme Verdi did not belong to the approximately 4% of Italian Resistance groups that were formal Catholic organisations, but instead was classed in the 21% of resistance groups that were \\"independent\\", in which, like the Osoppo group and others, the Fiamme Verdi was not formally a Catholic group, but had a very strong Catholic presence. Nevertheless, just as there were militant Catholics within the Garibaldi Brigade, so there were non- Catholics within the Fiamme Verdi. 191 priests were killed by fascists and 125 by the Germans, while 109 were killed by partisans. Though some priests joined pro-fascist bands, the Vatican backed the so-called anti-Fascist 'partisan chaplains' and 'red priests' fighting with the partisans, hoping that they would provide religious guidance to partisans being exposed to Communist propaganda.Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire - Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ; pp.504 The Fiamme Verdi was sometimes associated with the Democrazia Cristiana Party and was particularly active in Emilia and Lombardia.

In the past the religious building has been transformed into a warehouse by the local Macedonian authorities. A thorough reconstruction was undergoing for several years, and finally it was fully put into service and opened to public in November 2016. History The mosque was commissioned by Haydar Bey, then beylerbey of Rumelia Eyalet, the largest Ottoman administrative territory, with Manastir as a regional centre. According to the inscription in Arabic on the stone plaque above the door, the mosque was built in 969 he (1561/62 AD). The mosque is a domed building with massive walls of about 1.4 meters thick. The builders came from a small village in the region of Manastir but the project was most probably prepared by an unknown Islamic architect, influenced by the work of famous architects of that time, such as Kodja Sinan. In the description of Evlia Celebi's travels through the Balkans in the 17th century, this mosque was considered as one of the most beautifully decorated. Study of the remains show that the Haydar-Kadi Mosque was the only mosque in Bitola with two minarets. Marble decorations adorn the mihrab and the triangle-shaped tromps. A stone bas-relief can be seen on the portal, capitals and on the mimbar. Colourful geometrical designs can be found around the windows, on the arches, as well as on the tromps. The wood-carved door is executed in bas-relief. The most distinctive motif is the stylized Arabic letter \\"elif'. This type of woodcarved doors can be seen in Istanbul mosques. The mosque was repaired in 1890. We also know that all the mosques of the town were restored before the visit of the Mehmed V in 1910, a fact confirmed by certain elements of the interior decoration painted at that time.

Subsequently, Trịnh Cối and his family surrendered to the Mạc Court. Lê Anh Tông then appointed Trịnh Tùng (see page 141) as ...\\" Through his reign, Anh Tông was just a nominal emperor of south Đại Việt, with actual governing and military power possessed by the Trịnh, a warrior house from Thanh Hóa. Although the Lê house was namely the main enemy of the Mạc house in the north, Lê troops fighting the northerners were actually commanded by Trịnh warlords. Lê Anh Tông eventually grew hostile against those warlords, who he saw as occupying too much power. The emperor made a plot against one of them, Prime Minister Trịnh Tùng. The plot failed at the cost of Anh Tông's life. However, after Anh Tông's death, Trịnh Tùng decided to maintain the Lê imperial house by keeping Anh Tông's youngest son Lê Duy Đàm (Lê Thế Tông) as figurehead emperor.  Biography  Lê Duy Bang was born in 1532 in Thanh Hóa. According to the Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư, the official historical chronicle of Đại Việt under the Revival Lê dynasty, he was the fourth generation descendant of Lê Trừ, the second brother of Lê Thái Tổ, the Lê dynasty's founding emperor. It was recorded that Duy Bang's father was Lê Duy Khoáng and his mother was an unnamed woman from Thanh Hóa. In 1556, emperor Lê Trung Tông died at an early age without any heir. That spelled the extinction of Lê Thái Tổ's direct lineage. Grand Chancellor Trịnh Kiểm, who had been the virtual ruler of south Đại Việt since the reign of Lê Trang Tông, decided to select Duy Bang as the new emperor. Since 1533, Đại Việt entered a fierce civil war that divided the nation into two parts. The territory from Chinese border to Thanh Hóa was governed by the Mạc dynasty. The realm from Thanh Hóa to Thuận Hóa was nominally ruled by Lê emperors, with actual authority exerted by Generalissimo Nguyễn Kim, and, after Kim's death in 1545, his son-in-law Trịnh Kiểm. Therefore, having become emperor, Lê Anh Tông/Lê Duy Bang had to cooperate with Trịnh Kiểm in conducting the war with the Mạc house in order to unite Vietnam. With the help of Trịnh Kiểm and capable general, Lê Cập Đệ, emperor Anh Tông achieved several victories against the Mạc forces. However, the Mạc army guided by Mạc Kính Điển, an exceptionally talented prince and military leader, managed to hold large portions of the north. The constant battles between the two imperial houses caused heavy damage to the agricultural economy of Đại Việt. In 1565, Anh Tông organized an imperial examination to select Confucianist scholars as civil officials. Ten scholars passed the examination at highest grades. In 1570, Trịnh Kiểm died. Anh Tông appointed Kiểm's eldest son, Trịnh Cối as Generalissimo, controlling both the government and army of the Lê realm. Trịnh Cối soon proved to be an incompetent ruler, and was overthrown by his younger brother Trịnh Tùng. Under the resourceful command of Trịnh Tùng and Lê Cập Đệ, Lê forces repelled an offensive of Mạc Kính Điển in Thanh Hóa lowlands in 1570. In spring 1571, Lê Anh Tông appointed Trịnh Tùng as Prime Minister. In the same year, the northern court ordered Mạc Kính Điển to invade Nghệ An while another Mạc general conducted a amphibious offensive on Thuận Hóa, the Lê realm's extreme south prefecture, in order to open a second battlefront against the Lê dynasty. Mac forces landed on Thuận Hóa but were utterly defeated by general Nguyễn Hoàng, Trịnh Tùng's uncle-in-law. On the Nghệ An front, Lê Anh Tông's forces led by Trịnh Tùng managed to repulse Mạc Kính Điển's army. Lê Anh Tông and Trịnh Tùng defeated another offensive of Mạc Kính Điển in 1572. Throughout his 16 years reign, Emperor Lê Anh Tông changed his era name three times. The era names he used were respectively Thiên Hựu (天祐; 1557), Chính Trị (正治; 1558-1571) and Hồng Phúc (洪福; 1572-1573). In 1573, Anh Tông began to feel uneasy at the fact that Trịnh Tùng governed every aspect of the state. The emperor cooperated with Lê Cập Đệ to make a plot against Trịnh Tùng. The plot failed and Trịnh Tùng promptly killed Lê Cập Đệ. Anh Tông abandoned the imperial capital, Vạn Lại (Thanh Hóa) and escaped with his four eldest sons Bách, Lựu, Ngạnh and Tùng to Nghệ An. Trịnh Tùng organized a council with state ministers to announce that emperor had listened to unworthy persons and left the state in chaos. As Tùng claimed, the nation could not survive for even one day without an emperor, so Tùng decided to find the 5 year old youngest son of Anh Tông, Lê Duy Đàm, and raised Đàm to the throne. That was emperor Lê Thế Tông. In the next move, Tùng ordered his trusted lieutenants to come to Nghệ An and persuade Anh Tông to return to the capital. On his way to the capital, Lê Anh Tông was assassinated by Tùng's protégé Tống Đức Vị. The court, guided by Trịnh Tùng, officially announced that Anh Tông had committed suicide. The emperor died at 42 years old and was buried in the Bố Vệ mausoleum, Thanh Hóa. It was after his death that he was given temple name Anh Tông (英宗) and posthumous name Tuấn Hoàng đế (峻皇帝).

It was the first notable battle of the Gothic War of 376–382.\\"Cascading Failure: The Roman Disaster at Adrianople AD 378 - Part 2 of 3\\" by Jeffrey R. Cox Military History Online accessed 13 August 2013 After a failed Roman attempt to assassinate the Gothic leadership at a banquet in Marcianople, the Roman commander Lupicinius gathered all available troops, some 5,000 men, and attacked the 7,000–8,000 Tervingi Goths under Fritigern nine miles to the west of the town. While the Romans adopted a defensive posture on the battlefield, the Goths launched an immediate, all-out assault and bashed and slew the Romans with their shields, swords, and spears. Lupicinius fled as more than half of his army was killed on the spot. The Goths then re-armed themselves with Roman weaponry.  Background  = Introduction of the Goths into the Empire = In A.D. 376, after the death of Ermanaric's successor Vithimiris in battle against the Huns and the disintegration of the Ostrogothic kingdom, the west-Goths were forced to retreat before the feared Asian invaders. After the attempt to hold the Dniester against the enemy ended in failure and near encirclement and destruction, the Thervingi retreated; a part into Romania under Athanric, while the rest led by Fritigern fell back to the Danube, where they asked permission from the Roman Emperor Valens to be allowed to cross the river, which they thought could be held against the fearsome Asian barbarians.Edward Gibbon, The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire, (The Modern Library, 1932), chap.XXVI., pp. 921, 922 Valens, then emperor in the east, yielded his consent, but on the terms that their wealth, arms, and a certain number of their high-born youth, should be surrendered to him as pledges of their loyalty; and that they were to become the faithful servants of the Empire, subject to the obligations as well as the benefits of residence within her boundaries; the desperate barbarians eagerly accepted his conditions, and close to a million Goths, including 200,000 effective warriors, according to Gibbon, were ferried across the Danube by the governors of Thrace.Gibbon, Ibid. pp. 923, 924 Eunapius states their number as 200,000 including civilians, but Peter Heather estimates that the Thervings may have had only 10,000 warriors and 50,000 people in total, with the Greuthungi about the same size.Heather, 2005, pp. 145, 507. = Their disaffection = Trouble arose, however, when the corruption of Valens' local ministers came into play. Incapable of resisting the temptation presented by a multitude of desperate, suppliant, and increasingly famished victims, Valens' ministers shamelessly extorted from the Goths their property and even the persons of their wives and daughters, in return for the bare means of subsistence, which Valens had engaged to supply with a liberal hand. At the same time, they failed to disarm the Goths as intended, and their camp on the Danube was soon filled with the noise of war. Increasingly alarmed, Valens' generals resolved to disperse the Goths throughout the provinces, and gave orders for Fritigern, their leader, to march to Marcianopolis, where the respective places for each colony would be assigned. Fritigern, apparently still compliant, immediately hurried to obey the order.Gibbon, Ibid. pp. 925, 926  Battle  Having assembled the Goths near the city, Lupicinus, the Roman provincial commander in Thrace, who had himself played a conspicuous role in the exploitation and intolerable exactions to which the Goths had been subjected, invited their principal chiefs to a sumptuous feast, prepared in the hopes of conciliating them, and perhaps by bribery to discourage their revelation of his peculations to the emperor.Gibbon, Ibid. P. 927 In the midst of the entertainment, however, the main body of the Goths which had been ordered to encamp outside the city, in the attempt to obtain some provisions from the inhabitants, broke into a disorderly struggle with the Roman garrison, which denied them entrance. As soon as the noise of the fighting reached Fritigern in Lupicinus's palace, he broke out with the rest of the chiefs, swords drawn, and rejoined the Gothic camp outside the city. War was at once declared upon the Empire. Lupicinus immediately assembled the entire forces at his disposal, resolved to march on the enemy and crush the revolt on its inception. The Goths met him about nine miles from Marcianopolis, and obtained a decisive victory. The veteran legions fought with marked bravery, but were deserted by their feckless leader, and ultimately succumbed to the numbers and ferocity of the enraged barbarians, who promptly fell to devastating the country, burning and desolating what they did not appropriate.Gibbon, Ibid. p. 928 Citations References * Marcianople Marcianople Category:376 Category:370s in the Byzantine Empire Category:Gothic War (376–382) ","title":"Battle of Marcianople"},{"id":"40210444","text":"Andi Sultan Daeng Radja (1894-1963) was an Indonesian politician, who is now regarded as the National Hero of Indonesia.

He took a team of 7, including himself and a documentary crew led by Chinese filmmaker Cao Yang, and drove from Chengdu to the headwaters of Yangtze River (Jianggudiru Glacier on the border between Qinghai and Tibet) and collected a chunk of ice. Preserved in portable refrigerating equipment, the ice was sent in the cross country vehicles with the fastest speed to the marine outfall of Yangtze River in Shanghai, and gradually melted on the East China Sea. During the process, the team documented the rural areas to the west of China, erotic cultures in Tibetan areas, and the remains and reviving of the city after Yushu earthquake, as well as the prosperity of the cities to the east of China, and the grand 2010 Shanghai Expo.Proposal of Meditation on Floating Ice, Artintern.the first two days of Meditation on Floating Ice, Artintern.Artist Xing Xin's Guide on His Meditation on Floating Ice Documentation Exhibited in Suzhou True Color Museum, iOnly.  Personal statement of the work  In recent years fierce debates over climate concerns have been heard across the entire world. These issues over low carbon emission living, low carbon economies, and low carbon tariffs, etc., have led to constant political and economic disputes between impoverished nations, developing countries and developed countries. The frequency and intensity of listening to this discussion inevitably made me consider the topic deeply. Two centuries ago the Industrial Revolution brought to mankind an unprecedented acceleration to the experience of life and altered our original way of life forever. While indulging ourselves in the bliss of this acceleration, mankind has wandered off course and into a maze, and the danger of this excess is unquestionably demonstrated by these increased carbon emissions! Today, more and more people around the world agree that man is only a part of nature, not above the natural laws. And they have come to realize that we are just few drops of water in the ocean; if we flaunt our superiority and raise a storm, we will just accelerate the process of evaporation and vanish into thin air like so much dust. The Yangtze River is derived from the mountain glacier. The ice and snow mel into streams, and streams become torrents, rushing into the East China Sea. Afterwards, the currents of warm air take the water vapour back to the mountain, and the process starts all over again. It is the water naturally flowing in cycles that silently bears the mysterious taoism of \\"climate\\" and \\"acceleration\\"! Therefore, I've decided to attempt to alter the natural water cycle on land. Together with a crew of other artists and myself, we will drive to the headwaters of the Yangtze River (the Jianggendiru glacier on the border of Qinghai Province and Tibet) to collect a chunk of ice, and take it to the Yangtze River's marine outfall. The ice will slowly melt and dissolve into the East China Sea. This may seem quite ridiculous, like the old Chinese story of \\"the Foolish Old Man, who removed the mountains\\". Even so, we hope the audience can get something from the half foolish efforts of a bunch of regular guys (and gal). = How Many Hair My Father Owns on His 59th Birthday = Compared to the other grand projects of Xing Xin's, his work How Many Hair My Father Owns on His 59th Birthday (Chinese: 《父亲五十九岁生日时还拥有多少根头发》) performed in 2011 in A4 Contemporary Arts Center in Chengdu looks quite \\"simple\\": one table, two chairs, and a set of laboratory apparatus. However, it drew wide attention from the Chinese audience. In the traditional Chinese philosophy of Confucianism, there's something quite special about family, and the relationship between father and son. This work is quite a wake-up call for the Chinese society in modern days.Counting, How Many Grey Hairs Father Left, Chengdu Business Daily. In the interview, Xing Xin says, \\"I only counted 3,000 hairs today. With the estimation of 60,000 in total, it might take me more than 20 days to finish this work. But I will hold on to the last, and forever keep these hairs. Of course it is not necessary for my father to keep me company. He has already been sitting there for 3 hours. It is too hard for him.\\" Speaking of how this work is conceived, Xing Xin says, \\"in recently years, I suddenly realized the aging of my parents, especially their headful of grey. It also made me realize the ruthlessness of time, and the transiency of life. Therefore, I wanted to express such feeling with a work. It happens that my father is having his 59th birthday this month, and I hope to give him something to remember by with this performance.\\" He also says that, \\"in fact my father doesn't understand what I do, or what significance this work will bring. But with his trust to his son, as a father, he has shown great support to this work. Moreover, from the start to end, he never questioned me about the significance of this work, and I'm deeply moved.\\"Quite a Special Performance Art Work: Son Counts \\"How Many Hair His Father Owns\\" , West China City Daily. = 2011, I Exhibit Myself In A Western Exhibition = 2011, I Exhibit Myself In A Western Exhibition (Chinese: 《2011年，在一个西方的展览上展出我自己》) was created in 2011 in Personal Structures exhibition in Palazzo Bembo, a collateral event of the 54th Venice Biennale,PERSONAL STRUCTURES 54TH International Art Exhibition la Biennale di Venezia, PalazzoBembo.org.] in which he was imprisoned daily during exhibition opening hours in a small cell within the palazzo; naked to the waist, he wore only a pair of white tailored trousers - his shirt and jacket hung on the wall.  Personal statement of the work  I name this work, \\"2011, I exhibit myself in a western exhibition\\": in the exhibition PERSONAL STRUCTURES, as part of the 54th Biennale di Venezia 2011, I exhibit myself. In the scene, I’m locked in a small, empty room, behind iron “prison” bars. I’m only wearing tailored trousers, being half naked to the waist; my tailored shirt and coat are tidy hung on the wall. Every day from 10 am to 7 pm (opening hours of the exhibition at Palazzo Bembo), I stay here, doing nothing. People are free to look at me, a Chinese artist, a Chinese. At 7 pm, I put on my tailored shirt and coat and leave my room. People are still free to look at me, I’m still the artwork itself. The next morning, at 10 am, I’ll enter the room again. This action will span 30 days. This is a work of simplicity, as what I do is simply to exhibit myself. However, it is saturated with my current thought about ‘living space’ and my own existence today. Flourishing and prosperous China is today. Considering the past century, hardly anyone could resist the urge of going with the favorable wind of the current economy. With the continuing Reformation and Opening Policy, the world economy battles to gradually take a place in this nation, China, which for decades had applied planned economy policy. The ups and downs of the stock market and real estate constantly feed people’s appetite for money, while the accelerating inflation triggers their discussions and participation on “economics”! (Hereby, I don’t mean to question the rightness of reformation and opening, with which I actually agree, our Chinese society, ideology, etc. will therefore become more humanistic.) As you can imagine: when even the chitchat on every family’s dinner table—I mean EVERY family—were occupied with investment, rewards, and benefits, where could we still make our serenity? The schools? Of course not! In these times, professors deservedly cast their green eye to the colleagues oversees. As a “human”, I cannot agree that only this is the value of my life! Knowing this, makes me feel depressed! Therefore, I chose my life, chose to be an artist! I fight, fight with the unseen. I’m perplexed, by my family, my lovers, and my friends! As an artist, I constantly feel lost and I feel I am facing horror! I’m lost, in the Chinese contemporary art world, which only seems to be dealing with the total, instead of treasuring any individuals to light the world. I believe: I am human. In my eyes, the flourishing of contemporary art is nothing more than a mixture between the curiosity of the Westerners and the speculations of the New Rich in the East! In this society where humanity encounters economics, in these times when speculation invades, I force to engage myself with the Allies: “The fact is, that since the moment that I was born, I only wish to fight my way through the noise; thus to become free and easy, until my whole life will be over, will be lit!”Xing Xin, 2011 I Exhibit Myself in a Western Exhibition = Pushing My Car and Galloping in the City = In 2012, when the Diaoyudao incident was still feverish, some extreme and angry citizens smashed and burnt Japanese cars in streets, Xing Xin pushed his car with sophisticated antecedents across the city, bearing the name Pushing My Car and Galloping in the City: Approx. 30 Miles to the East (Chinese: 《推着汽车在城市里奔跑——至西向东约30公里》).Anti-Japanese Protests Flare in China Over Disputed Islands, Bloomburg Businessweek.Anti-Japanese Demonstrations in China, imgur.  Inspiration  Some day in the August of 2012, the car couldn’t start suddenly. It wasn’t the first time for such similar problems. I had faced plenty of problems since I bought it that I couldn’t even express with words. But the summer was too hot for me to deal with yet another problem. Therefore, it was abandoned by the street until October. Some other day when I had to take a taxi again, an image suddenly appeared in my head: against the autumn wind, I solitarily pushed the car across the city, all the way to a place somewhere. Therefore, conceived the work Pushing My Car and Galloping in the City: Approx. 30 Miles to the East.Pushing My Car and Galloping in the City: Approx. 30 Miles to the East, Artintern.net.  Process  From the spot where the car is now parked, with the shortest and most practicable route I push the car to the special maintenance center. The spot where the car is now park (which is also my home) is in the northwest corner of the city, while the special maintenance center is in the southeast corner of the city (which is the only special maintenance center in the city because my car is a niche model). The linear distance between the two spots are approximately 30 miles. I presume to send the car to the special maintenance center non-stop, with regular diet, regardless of the weather.  Antecedents of the car  This is my first car in life, a three-door version SUV left the factory in 2005. Its body is pure yellow, and the inner space consists of black and red. I bought it on a second-hand car market in the middle of 2008. I can’t tell it is Made-in-China or Made-in-Japan. It is not because when I bought it the former owner had already changed the original car logo into another Japanese car logo under which trademark has another car identical in appearance but different in performance with this one, but because that the Chinese manufacturer of this car has used Japanese production line and pattern die to produce the car almost identical to Japanese car in China, which means the car is not some product surrogated by Japanese company to manufacture or sell in China. Considering the relatively tense relationship between China and Japan recently, I think I have to make some assistive clarification about the individual case of the car. = Stand-Up Waiting in the Drainage Pipe = March 28, 2013, Xing Xin attended Tomorrow Contemporary Sculpture Award, and exhibited his sculpture/performance art work, Stand-Up Waiting in the Drainage Pipe (Chinese: 《站在下水道管里等待》). The audience were intrigued by Xing Xin's special \\"sculpture\\", which is highly unusual to be seen in a sculpture exhibition. The curator believes that, the notion of sculpture should be dynamic, and it is not just about stiff and confirmed objects.Coverage Issued by China Sculpture Institute.  Inspiration  March 3, 2013, in Chengdu MOCA (Chengdu Museum of Contemporary Art), the work Stand-Up Waiting in the Drainage Pipe for the Advent of 32 Hours Later according to the original plan was supposed to stand in a drainage pipe for 32 hours. However, 47 minutes after I was put into the pipe I could stand it any longer. It wasn't because of my lack of strength or willpower, but that during the preparation I ignored the principle of ventilation. I directly deposited the drainage pipe on the floor and sealed its end, and it caused the carbon dioxide couldn't be discharged from the space of 40 cm diameter and 200 cm high, which is barely enough for a person to stand in. And eventually it nearly killed me. During the last 30 minutes in the pipe when I felt lack of oxygen and waited like for a lifetime to be rescued, my head was filled with the images of the rescue scenes during the \\"May 12 Wenchuan earthquake\\", that and various coalmine mishap scenes. At that moment, I think I finally understood the \\"fragility of life\\"! I ceaselessly told myself, \\"Breathe! Breathe! I could be out just a little bit later...\\" Finally, I got out from the drainage pipe which I could never escape all by myself. I feel really really lucky that I am still alive like all the other people who came out from any catastrophes! Again today, I stand in the drainage pipe which almost killed me. It might be out of sensationalization purposes, or maybe because of my faces, or that I simply want to conquer it. Anyway, I decide to unravel to the people the course of my mind and heart.  Declaration of performance art  In China, the term performance art is usually demonized and the practice of performance art in China verges on semi-legal and illegal. In order to set straight the development course of performance art in China, Xing Xin publicly announced his Declaration of Performance Art on August 26, 2012.Controversy over New Performance Art Course in Sichuan Fine Arts Institute.Artist Sentenced Re-education through Labor for One Year for Performance Art of Sexual Behavior, Beijing Youth Daily. = Contents = I firmly believe that, human behaviours guided by anything else but art could in no way be called performance art. Human behaviors guided by art may be just artistic behaviour also. Performance art is not simply a display of behaviours in the name of art. Art workers' daily or non-daily behaviors can not be included into the perimeter of performance art. I personally contend that any behaviour accords with the following circumstances could not be called performance art. * 1\\\\. PERFORMANCE ART IS NOT POLITICAL EVENT Any event including war, massacre, assassination, threatening abuse, revenge, etc. in order to defend one's own interests is political violence. It's not art, let alone performance art. Performance art works could include political discussions into its content, but it is never political event itself. * 2\\\\. PERFORMANCE ART IS NOT A TOOL TO CATER FOR RADICAL MOVEMENTS A parade, demonstration, or protest, is the parade, demonstration, or protest itself. It won't change its property with artist's participation. It won't change its property with anyone's nudity or blending in any aesthetic elements. Such events have nothing to do with performance art. Performance art works could include parade, demonstration, or protest into its content, but it shouldn't be as simple as directly participating in it. * 3\\\\. PERFORMANCE ART IS NOT COMMERCIAL PERFORMANCE Body painting, body photography, body runway show, body street dance, living sculpture, acrobatics, or any peculiar-looking behaviors in coordination with activities such as opening of real estate, auto expo, market promotion, and holiday celebrations, are nothing but shows, not performance art. Performance art could reference or use the forms of body painting, body photography, body runway show, body street dance, living sculpture, and acrobatics to present the contents of the work, but it shouldn't make a show of the show on purpose. * 4\\\\. PERFORMANCE ART IS NOT ARTTISTIC BEHAVIOR The process of the already categorized painting, plastic arts, photography, performing arts, music, and competitive sports could not be seen straightly as performance art. Performance art could reference or use any techniques and/or forms from categories such as fine art, art, sport, etc. to supplement its own creation. * 5\\\\. PERFORMANCE ART ISN'T ANY SUBCULTURAL GROUP BEHAVIOR Subcultural behaviors such as homosexuality, Sadism & Masochism, body piercing, tattoo, autosadism, autotomy, etc. are only about individual and personal fondness and sexual orientations. Such behaviors do not directly connect to performance art. Performance art works could include cultures such as homosexuality, S & M, body piercing, and tattoo into its content, but behaviors presented by these cultures do not stand for performance art. * 6\\\\. PERFORMANCE ART ISN'T RUMOUR OR RANDOM SPOOF Personal privacy divulgence, deliberately and publicly manufactured spoofing photos or videos are just appetisers for universal voyeuristic desire and curiosity, but the incident itself is not performance art. The subject of a performance art work could be about hot issues, and it could be presented as parody, but it should not be a parodistic action just in order to seek public attention. * 7\\\\. PERFORMANCE ART IS NOT JUST A COMBINATION OF ART WORKER'S FUNNY APPEARANCE AND INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIORS Wearing a wig, mustache, or plait, or completely shaved head, no matter how peculiar the art worker's appearance is, or how he or she responds to questions with mystifying answers, they are just kicking up a cloud of dust to get public attention. Such behaviours are not performance art. Performance art work is not about the art worker's peculiar appearance, neither is their incoherent style of conversation, or any flashy showmanship with a combination of both. * 8\\\\. PERFORMANCE ART IS NOT AN EXCUSE FOR ANY MALEFACTION Homicide, robbery, sexual abuse, and any other crime committed on others are only malefaction.

Biography Marthen Indey was born in Doromena, Jayapura Regency, Netherlands New Guinea on March 16 1912. After his primary education he attended the police school in Sukabumi, West Java, and joined became a police officer working for the Dutch in the infamous Boven-Digoel concentration camp. It was in 1941, when he was overseeing a cadre of independence activists being interned in the camp, that he became converted to their cause. However, as a government employee he followed Dutch official figures into exile in Australia during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies. In April 1944, as the Japanese were losing the war, members of the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration, who intended to re-establish Dutch control over the colony, landed in New Guinea. Among those NICA staff were Sugoro, a former Boven- Digoel prisoner who was now employed by the Dutch as an advisor on education and religion, as well as a number of Papuans, including Marthen Indey, Frans Kaisiepo, Silas Papare, and others. That group within the NICA forces remained sympathetic to the Indonesian independence movement and plotted to strike against the Dutch in New Guinea on December 25 1945. Unfortunately, the Dutch heard about the plot and imprisoned its leaders, including Sugoro, Indey, Silas Papare, and Luksa Rumkorem. In October 1946, Indey joined the Komite Indonesia Merdeka (Indonesian: Free Indonesia Committee), an anti-Dutch force in Papua; he became chairman and was subsequently imprisoned by the Dutch for in a remote part of Boven Digoel Regency. In 1962 he was involved in a guerilla effort to rescue RPKAD members, Indonesian commandos, who had landed in Dutch-controlled Papua during Operation Trikora.

Therefore, he is sometimes considered an early figure in the Indonesian National Awakening. In 1973 he was declared a National Hero of Indonesia. Biography Wahidin was born on January 7 1852 in Sleman, Yogyakarta, in the Dutch East Indies. Although he was mainly of Javanese Priyayi (noble) descent, he was also descended from Daeng Kraeng Nobo, an aristocrat from Makassar who left for Java during the conquest of the Mataram Sultanate by the Dutch. In his youth, he studied in the Tweede Europesche Lager School in Yogyakarta before studying at the STOVIA school in Batavia and becoming a medical doctor. After graduating from there, he was obliged to work for ten years as a government doctor. During this time he became well known for his efforts to improve the health of the common Javanese people. After retiring as a medical doctor, Wahidin took an interest in improving educational opportunities for elite Javanese youth. He was not a radical anti-colonialist, but believed that Javanese culture could be brought up to a higher level with access to European-style education. This fit with the Dutch policy of the time, called Ethical Policy, which aimed to selectively improve education for elite Indonesians. In 1907, while touring to raise funds for the aforementioned educational goals, he visited the students in STOVIA in Batavia, where he met Soetomo, who was a young student there at the time. This encounter was to lead to the foundation of Budi Utomo in May 1908. In the first congress of Budi Utomo, Wahidin was elected as president of the organization after Raden Atmodirono stood aside from the final vote. However, before long he stood aside to allow younger leaders to take charge of the organization. He died on May 26 1917 in Yogyakarta. In 1973, he was declared a National Hero of Indonesia.

It was released in 2013 independently after a successful crowd-funding effort on the website Indiegogo. Background and concept The Titan EP was released independently by Oh, Sleeper with funding assistance via Indiegogo. This new concept is about a campaign (Titan) that is taking over the world, town by town, offering synthetic upgrades (mechanical hearts, eyes, lungs, limbs) in exchange for time served in their service. Every upgrade costs a time commitment (contract) where you must do the bidding of Titan. The idea is that anything is possible: if one wants to be a doctor and do not want to work for it, one can have a skill download from Titan with a brain augmentation and have it instantly. The only cost is that one is now a part of Titan until the time-debt has been paid. If one wants to be a marathon runner, have new legs, etc. The catch is that these upgrades need servicing and the only people who can service them are the Titan technicians, the only currencies accepted are time-contracts. The older one is, the less time one has to spend. If one has a debt when they die, it transfers to the next of kin. Song descriptions \\"Naofumi Mitsuhashi\\" is the first song on the EP. The song is the name given by the user who donated the largest single donation on Oh, Sleeper's Indiegogo campaign. It bears no relation to EP's transhumanist concept. \\"The Pitch\\" is the second song, in which a boy age 16 who dreams of being a pilot but cannot under normal circumstances due to him being born blind, is \\"pitched\\" the sale of bodily augmentation to achieve his dream. In return, as payment he must agree to a 6 years \\"time contract\\" for the services rendered. In this case he will receive a new set of eyes and in return he must spend his time doing whatever the group asks of him using his augmentations. Driven by his desire, he accepts the eyes but not until after some persuasion by the group. At the end of the song he is convinced. In the third song, \\"Death From Above\\", the boy awakens with his new eyes and is given the option to join the piloting program offered by the Titan group. He spends his 6-year contract being a pilot doing the Titan's tasks appointed to him. He is ecstatic about his new life and is learning from the program. At the end of his 6 years he is promoted to the \\"collectors program\\". He is now responsible for finding augmentees fleeing from their time debts. He is tasked with a dangerous raid on a rogue hideout. \\"Heavy Hands\\" is the fourth song. During the raid on the rogue hideout, the boy's eyes malfunction and he is captured and tortured by the rogue augmentees. They beat him for information but he does not talk. The rogues send him back to Titan as a message. On his way to the drop point one of the augmentees asks him, \\"What would happen if nobody resisted the Titan?\\" Beaten within an inch of his life, Titan does another operation giving him a new heart and another 18 years to his Titan debt. That night the augmentee's words ring through his head and he begins to doubt and regret the Titan program. In the fifth song, \\"The Rise\\", he is awakened by explosions and sirens as the facility is being attacked by the rogue augmentees. He is commanded to secure the breach. As he approaches he sees a truck fleeing and in the back is the rogue who left him with those echoing words. He spots a motorcycle and all of his being is telling him to get on it and flee. He follows the truck and after a long chase the trucks veers off the road immediately following a loud screech and flash of light. His eyes go black and he crashes. He awakens in a cell. Still blind he hears the rogue ask him why he followed. He answers and says that a Titan debt was never meant to be repaid. The rogue responds by asking if he is ready to join their cause. He quickly replies that he will do anything he can to bring an end to Titan. The rogue responds by saying that he could never stand by their side, even though his mind and spirit is willing, his eyes will always be loyal to Titan. The rogue leaves and drops a metal object on the ground. His eyes power back on and all he sees is a flag with a pentagram-like symbol being held by a scorpion and a knife on the ground. He grabs the knife and with a firm grip carves out his eyes, sending an unmistakable message of resistance to Titan.

Originating from the Yapen Islands, Papare trained and worked as a nurse prior to the Second World War, during which he organized local resistance and gathered intelligence against occupying Japanese forces. While he initially held pro-Dutch views after the war, this shifted after he was not delegated to the Malino Conference and he was influenced by Sam Ratulangi into founding the pro-Indonesian Indonesian Irian Independence Party. Following a failed uprising against the Dutch, he was imprisoned before he left Papua in 1949, only once returning in 1950. He became a legislator between 1954 and 1960 and had participated in the Round Table Conference and the New York Agreement. Papare then began criticizing the Indonesian government's actions in Papua throughout the 1960s and was briefly arrested, though he later returned to the legislative body. He died in 1979, and was made a National Hero in 1993. Early life and education Silas Ayari Donrai Papare was born in the town of Serui, in the Yapen Islands, on 18 December 1918, from father Musa Papare and mother Dorkas Papare. At the time, Serui was one of the most exposed parts of Papua to external influences and ideas. He enrolled at the local village school (Volkschool) at the age of nine and graduated in 1930, working at his parents' farm for a year before pursuing further education at a nurse school in Serui starting in 1931. Papare was among some of the first to be educated in the Dutch civil servant schools in Papua, which were established in 1944. Career After he completed school in 1935, Papare worked in Serui for some time before moving to work at the Dutch oil firm NNGPM's company hospital at Sorong in 1936, where he was a head nurse. Due to personnel shortages in Serui, Papare was reassigned there in 1940. During the Pacific War, Papare became known as a middleman between Allied authorities and Papuans, and he sided with the Allies throughout the conflict. He organized local resistance against Japanese forces around the Cenderawasih Bay area and provided intelligence to allied forces there, particularly after the Battle of Hollandia. After the war, he was awarded the Bronze Lion by the Dutch government, and was given the military rank of a sergeant. =Indonesia= Sam Ratulangi (bottom row, second from left) influenced Papare during the former's exile in Serui Immediately after the war, once Dutch authorities took over Papua's administration from the Allies, Papare became the head nurse in Serui. At that time, his anti-Indonesian views were known, stemming from his observations of Indonesian civil servants in Papua being submissive to Japanese authorities while being repressive against Papuans. Due to this, Dutch authorities decided to send Frans Kaisiepo instead of Papare to the Malino Conference to represent Papua in the formation of the State of East Indonesia, a decision which slighted Papare. In June 1946, Sam Ratulangi (the Indonesian Republican Governor of Sulawesi) was exiled to Serui, where he made contact with Papare. Papare's newfound dislike for the Dutch, coupled with Ratulangi's background as a medical practitioner by trade, resulted in Papare developing pro-republican views, and by November 1946 Papare had founded the Indonesian Irian Independence Party (Partai Kemerdekaan Indonesia Irian, PKII). Ratulangi became the general adviser to the party, which was then the largest and most active political party in West Papua. By 17 August 1947 (the second anniversary of the proclamation of Indonesian independence), Papare had led an Indonesian flag-raising ceremony in Manokwari. Papare attained a sort of a messianic reputation locally, regarding being a savior from Dutch colonialism into an imagined utopia under Indonesian rule. In December 1946, Papare and Marthen Indey influence the Papuan Battalion to launch a revolt against Dutch authorities, which was foiled by the Dutch due to information leakage. As a result, Papare and Indey were arrested and imprisoned in Hollandia. Papare was later moved to Biak. Papare escaped and moved to Indonesia in 1949, leaving PKII leaderless. In Yogyakarta in October 1949, he founded the Irian Revolutionary Body (Badan Perjuangan Irian) and he later attended the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference. He briefly returned to Papua in 1950 as the Indonesian delegation in the Dutch–Indonesian Commission surveying the region. Papare would not return to Papua, though PKII remained the dominant party in Papua throughout the 1950s. KRI Silas Papare (386) Between 1951 and 1954, Papare worked in hospitals in Jakarta, before he was appointed to the Provisional People's Representative Council on 24 March 1954 to replace the deceased Rajiman Wediodiningrat. He was reappointed to the body in 1956, as one of the delegations from Papua. He maintained his parliamentary seat until his pensioning in 1960. During this period, he joined the Irian Bureau, intended to become the future provincial government for Papua. He declared an autonomous province of Papua under Indonesia in 1956, though before long the Indonesian government announced a distinct province. Canadian researcher David Webster claimed that in 1961 Papare told the American Ambassador to Indonesia at the time that he intended to return to Papua to support the growing independence movement, and that he was threatened with arrest for his criticism of Sukarno, despite Papare being considered as the future Indonesian governor of Papua at that time. In 1962, he was sent to New York City as part of the Indonesian delegation discussing West Papua, and the negotiations culminated with the New York Agreement. Papare was arrested in 1962, though he had been released by 1963 and he returned to the parliament.

Career Robert Rede was born at Asham's Hall, Beccles, Suffolk, a son of Ann and Thomas William Rede, a Naval officer. and spent much of his early life in France, also visiting many other European States. He arrived in Australia around 1852, at the height of the Gold Rush, and was soon digging at Forest Creek and Bendigo. He had a fair knowledge of medicine, and became popularly known as the \\"little doctor\\". He was shortly engaged by J. A. Panton, resident Commissioner at Bendigo, as his assistant, was appointed commissioner at Mount Korong and Jones's Creek, then at Ballarat. He earned a reputation as a solid administrator and was particularly successful in resolving disputed claims.http://www.thecourier.com.au/story/576055/robert-rede-eurekas-villan- or-victorian-patriot/ At that time, a monthly fee of 30 shillings was required of diggers on Victorian goldfields for a Miner's Licence. Rede was in the invidious position of having to enforce this unpopular and inequitable tax, having charge of both civilian police and militia and with no guidelines as to how to deploy them except \\"use your discretion\\". This meant that regular raids were made by troops and police to apprehend those who had not paid their licence fee. By October 1864, on the orders of Sir Charles Hotham, these raids were being conducted twice weekly, and the level of discontent rose among the diggers, many of whom daily carried pistols. After the death of digger James Scobie, and the exoneration of hotel-keeper Bentley by a bench consisting of Rede, Dewes (a magistrate for whom Rede had little affection, and suspected of corruption) and Johnstone/Johnston? (Rede's assistant), meetings were called which resulted in more unrest. Rede was rumoured to be a secret partner in Bentley's hotel. Rede was attending a dinner in honour of the visiting American Consul, Tarlton/Tarleton? (whom he praised for his generous speech, while suspecting him of ulterior motives),http://wiki.prov.vic.gov.au/index.php/Eureka Stockade:Rede reports on a dinner held for the American Consul and states his mistrust of the Americans and had been allocated the honour of proposing the loyal toast, but he received news that a contingent of troopers being deployed to the goldfields had been set upon by diggers. He hurried to where a couple of soldiers had been wounded, but the culprits had vanished. On 29 November the diggers, some 12,000 in number, held a meeting at Bakery Hill, condemning the treatment they had suffered at the hands of the Victorian government. Johnstone/Johnston?, led a party of police to the \\"Gravel Pits\\" diggings in a determined raid to apprehend unlicensed miners, and were met with a shower of stones and the occasional pistol shot. Rede and the few police and militia not already engaged in the affray arrived on the scene. Rede reminded them that a commission of enquiry had been promised them to find a more equitable system, and urged restraint. He then read the Riot Act. Peter Lalor urged resistance and the miners marched to Eureka goldfield and erected the famous Eureka Stockade. On 3 December Captain John Wellesley Thomas and his men attacked the stockade, resulting in the death of 22 miners and nearly as many severely wounded. Knowing that his actions against the miners made him a likely target, Rede requested a transfer, and was give the post of deputy sheriff of Geelong, and promoted to sheriff in July 1857. There, as Major Rede, he organized the Geelong Rifles and, by the time he retired from the militia, had been promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. By 1869 his area of responsibility had expanded to encompass also Ballarat, Ararat and Belfast districts. He was appointed Sheriff of Melbourne around 1888 and retired in December 1889. Family Robert Rede was married twice: first in 1859 to Isabella Strachan ( – 18 December 1862), a daughter of J. F. Strachan; then on 9 January 1873 to Margaret Geraldine Clendinning (ca.1847 – 18 August 1936) of Ballarat.

Beginning in 2010, a series of her articles dealing with state-level corruption in Azerbaijan caused great controversy as they explicitly named Azerbaijan's current President Ilham Aliyev, his wife Mehriban Aliyeva and their children as engaging in corruption. The government never issued a comment with regard to any of these reports. Two of these articles were named best investigative reports of 2010 and 2011 by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Azerbaijan's media is strictly controlled by the government Thus, this sort of investigative reporting is highly unusual. Following the March 2010 publication of a Washington Post article, not written by Ismayilova but which used her previous work as background information, which alleged that the eleven-year-old son of Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev owned real estate in the United Arab Emirates worth 44 million USD, Ismayilova co-published an article based on her investigation which shed light on the business activity of other members of the President's family and the family's close circle of friends. The article specifically described Ilham Aliyev's younger daughter Arzu Aliyeva's activities, as she reportedly owned a bank that had never been privatised since its establishment. Arzu Aliyeva was also reported a co-owner of a holding that had been winning unannounced tenders and seized control of all profitable services of Azerbaijan Airlines, such as airport taxi, duty- free, on-board catering, and airplane technical support, without any transparent financial reporting. Ismayilova's next controversial publication in June 2011 revealed the names of offshore companies which had been registered in the names of Aliyev's daughters. This report also alleged that the Aliyev daughters owned one of the mobile operators and the 3G monopolist of Azerbaijan. It also claimed that the mobile operator had been falsely naming Siemens as its legal owner in order to be able to participate in state tenders to evade the Azerbaijani law not allowing newly registered companies to do so. In an investigation report co-authored by Ismayilova and published in May 2012, it was alleged that the AIMROC consortium in charge of extracting gold and silver worth 2.5 billion USD from the Chovdar mine is owned by three Panamanian companies (different from the ones mentioned in the previous report), with the wife and daughters of the president as their senior managers. The president's office refused to comment on the matter. On 12 June 2012, the National Assembly of Azerbaijan adopted amendments to three laws, stipulating that from then on, information on the ownership of companies, including names and share of the owners, can only be released either on court orders or as part of a police investigation, on the orders of a financial monitoring agency, or by consent of the company owner only. According to Azerireport, this was the government's response to Khadija Ismayilova's journalist investigations which brought the corruption of the Azerbaijani government to public attention. Opposition member Ilgar Mammadov also linked the adoption of the amendments to the corruption scandal caused by the reports and said it would turn Azerbaijan itself into a corruption-friendly offshore zone. It is noteworthy that almost simultaneously, on 13 June 2012, the National Assembly passed a law granting all ex-Presidents and ex-First Ladies lifelong legal immunity. Another investigative report came in October 2012 as part of the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, for which Khadija Ismayilova cooperated with two Czech journalists and in which claimed that high-ranking officials of Azerbaijan and their family members have companies registered in their names in the Czech Republic and through those companies own luxury real estate in Karlovy Vary. Names of Arzu Aliyeva (who reportedly owns a one-million-dollar villa), Ilham Aliyev's father-in-law Arif Pashayev, Sheikh ul-Islam of the Caucasus Allahshukur Pashazadeh, his brother Member of Parliament Javanshir Pashazadeh, Member of Parliament Adil Aliyev and the latter's brother Allahverdi Aliyev were mentioned among Azerbaijani company owners in the Czech Republic who in turn owned property there. According to a Freedom House report, Azerbaijani law prohibits government officials, including the president, from owning businesses, but there are no such restrictions on family members. In the report, Ismayilova quoted Vasif Movsumov, executive director of the Baku-based Anti-Corruption Foundation, as saying the ownership of the said companies by Parliament Members is a violation of law. Opinions and views In an interview to Gunaz TV, Khadija Ismayilova said she believed that Islamists affiliated with Iran's intelligence were directly responsible for the assassination of publicist Rafiq Tağı. Ismayilova condemned the murder of Gurgen Margaryan by Azerbaijani officer Ramil Safarov by calling it an \\"awful act\\" and said unlike some, she did not consider him a hero. In August 2012, she mentioned on her Facebook account that the warm welcome Safarov had received in Azerbaijan after being extradited and pardoned stemmed from the fact that \\"the people of Azerbaijan lost the war, lost the territory to occupants, became refugees, lost their siblings including civilians and they were stopped and banned from restoring justice on the battle field\\". She also criticised President Aliyev for not exercising his right to pardon a convicted criminal in the proper manner, which made Azerbaijan an easy target of criticism by the international community. In August 2013, while commenting on the release of the list of people declared personae non gratae in Azerbaijan for visiting the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, Ismailyova noted that some of the people whose names appear on the list, especially those for whom no reason for the ban has been listed, are in fact journalists and human rights activists who apparently were barred from entering Azerbaijan for criticising the Azerbaijani government in their articles, as it is not evident if they have ever visited Nagorno-Karabakh. Sex tape and blackmail On 7 March 2012, Ismayilova received what appeared to be snapshots of a footage from a camera hidden in her bedroom capturing her engaged in sexual intercourse with her boyfriend. Attached was a letter containing threats of \\"public humiliation\\", if Ismayilova did not \\"behave\\". Similar snapshots were received by her boyfriend, some relatives and a number of opposition media outlets. Ismayilova publicly refused to give in to the blackmailers. On 14 March, the original footage of the intercourse scene was posted on a website posing as the website of the opposition party Musavat. The party officials stated the website did not represent them and condemned the act. Ismayilova blamed the government, primarily the Presidential Administration, for ordering her sex-taped and launching a smear campaign to retaliate for her investigative activity. Ismayilova submitted a report to the Attorney General's Office on the day after receiving the snapshots, but the office did not start an investigation until after the video was publicised. Numerous local and international organizations showed their support for Ismayilova and condemned attempts to blackmail her, among them the Institute for Media Rights (Azerbaijan), Institute for Reporters' Freedom and Safety (Azerbaijan), Amnesty International, Committee to Protect Journalists, Association of Women Journalists (Azerbaijan), the local Helsinki Committee for Human Rights and others. In her letter to President Ilham Aliyev, OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media Dunja Mijatović insisted that those responsible for the blackmail be identified and prosecuted. In April 2012, British pop singer Sandie Shaw joined an Amnesty International campaign to end human rights abuses in Azerbaijan. Shaw stated on behalf of Ismayilova's case: \\"That anyone would stoop so low in an attempt to silence an independent journalist is sickening. The people behind this appalling blackmail and smear campaign must be brought to justice. And the persecution of independent journalists in Azerbaijan must stop.\\" On 26 April 2012, the Attorney General's office released the names of all those who lived or visited the apartment where the sex-taping took place. Ismayilova criticised this act, saying that instead of carrying out an investigation, the Attorney General's office is echoing the blackmailers in intervening in her personal life by doing this. Meanwhile, Ismayilova carried out her own personal investigation. She claimed that the stamp shown on the letter containing the snapshots and supposedly sent from Moscow was fake. In addition, according to her, a neighbourhood maintenance worker said that an additional telephone line had been installed in her apartment in July 2011 by technicians from the telephone exchange. The telephone exchange, in turn, said the technicians acted on the orders of the Ministry of National Security which owns an office there that the exchange has no control of. Ismayilova added that in July 2011, she had been abroad and that according to the maintenance worker, an unidentified man had met him at the door claiming to be the owner of the apartment. While the official investigation is currently in progress, similar footage of Ismayilova, recorded at a different time, was published on a different website on 26 July 2013, accompanied by a comment attributed to blogger Emin Milli in which he allegedly said that \\"the videos featuring Khadija Ismayilova have done serious damage to the general democratic movement\\". Emin Milli denied making that statement and referred to it as \\"blatant provocation\\". On 2 August 2013, a group of journalists initiated a silent walking protest in support of Ismayilova. Thirty of them were detained and later released. A number of international human rights organisations signed a collective letter addressed to President Ilham Aliyev and Attorney General Zakir Garalov, calling on them to ensure proper investigation in order to put an end to the ongoing smear campaign against Khadija Ismayilova and have its perpetrators punished. The letter was signed by ARTICLE 19, Civil Rights Defenders, Human Rights House Foundation, Human Rights Watch, International Media Support, Media Diversity Institute, Norwegian Helsinki Committee, Open Society Foundations, PEN International, People in Need Organisation, Reporters Without Borders. 2013 arrest and community service On 26 January 2013, Khadija Ismayilova was among dozens of peaceful protesters who were detained for participating in an unsanctioned protest action in Baku in support of the Ismayilli rioters. She refused to pay the 500 AZN fine, claiming she had not violated the law. Instead, in June 2013, the Binagadi District Court sentenced her to 220 hours of community service, namely sweeping the streets. Ismayilova said she was pleased with the verdict, as \\"clearing this country of rubbish\\" is something she is used to. However, soon afterwards, many of Ismayilova's supporters expressed their wish to join her in sweeping the streets. Immediately, the executive power of the district ceased the service, saying they would replace the sweeping option with indoor service. On 15 August 2013, the Binagadi Court of Appeal upheld the previous decision, after which Ismayilova stated she would only perform community service in public, out of fear for her safety. 2014 harassment An article published on 13 February 2014 on a pro- government website accused Ismayilova of passing along information discrediting members of Azerbaijan's political opposition to two U.S. congressional staffers who were in Baku, allegedly to gather intelligence. On 14 February 2014, Ismayilova posted a scan to her Facebook page that appears to be a contract used by the Ministry of National Security to hire an informer. Stipulating terms and threatening blackmail, the document suggests evidence of the government's efforts to infiltrate the political opposition. On 18 February and 19 February and 20 February 2014, the prosecutor's office called her in for disseminating secret documents. In September 2014, a campaign began claiming that Ismayilova worked with Armenians to organize a protest at the Warsaw OSCE Summit. Ismayilova was notified that the authorities would be waiting for her to return to Baku on October 3, and while she was detained for five hours, with a focus on a camera SD card possibly containing documents against the state, later found empty, she was not arrested. Soon after, a lawsuit was filed against Ismayilova, charging her with criminal defamation and insult, based on the 14 February document noted above. 2014 arrest and trial  In February 2014, Ismayilova posted a list of requests to her supporters in case of her arrest and made a video in October 2014 discussing why she believed that she would be arrested. On 5 December 2014, Ismayilova was arrested. She was summoned to appear in the Sabayil District court in Baku on December 5, accused of provoking a man to attempt suicide. She was sentenced to two months of pre-trial detention on the charge of Article 125 of the Criminal Code, accused of inciting her former colleague Tural Mustafayev to suicide, facing a prison sentence of three to seven years if convicted. Some note that her arrest came one day after the head of the Presidential Administration of Azerbaijan Republic, Ramiz Mehdiyev published a manifesto in which Ismayilova was named \\"the best example\\" of journalists working against the government. \\"She puts on anti-Azerbaijani shows, makes absurd statements, openly demonstrates a destructive attitude towards well-known members of the Azerbaijani community, and spreads insulting lies\\" and accused Ismayilova of treason. In February 2015, Ismayilova was additionally charged with tax evasion and abuse of power.Journalist Khadija Ismayilova Wrote Another Letter from Prison. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. 11 March 2015. Retrieved 24 January 2016. According to Reporters Without Borders, Ismayilova's lawyer, Fariz Namazly, said the authorities were trying to compensate for the flimsiness of the initial charges brought against her. The new charges are boilerplate in nature, inasmuch as human rights defenders such as Intigam Aliyev, Rasul Jafarov and Anar Mammadli are being held on similar ones. In April 2015, Tural Mustafayev, who had been allegedly incited to suicide by Ismayilova, revealed in an interview that he no longer wished to pursue a case against Ismayilova. He stated that beginning in December 2014, he had contacted the Office of the Attorney General asking to withdraw his original complaint which he had filed while \\"going through psychologically difficult times\\". He denied being pressured by a third party into filing it, but did briefly mention that he was \\"detained\\" back in December soon after leaving a message on his Facebook page in which he expressed his intent to withdraw the complaint. Mustafayev's request was ignored, and he refused to comment on the reasons for this refusal. In September 2015, Khadija Ismayilova was found guilty on the counts of tax evasion and abuse of power, but acquitted on the count of inciting to suicide. She was sentenced to 7.5 years in prison. She had previously filed a case with the European Court of Human Rights stating that she had been held in prison beyond the pre-trial detention of two months following her December 2014 arrest.Who Will Compensate Khadija's Two Months?. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. 7 September 2015. Retrieved 24 January 2015. In January 2016, Amal Clooney announced that she would like to represent Ismayilova at the European Court of Human Rights. Ismayilova accepted the proposal.Khadija Agreed to Be Represented by Amal Clooney. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. 21 January 2016. Retrieved 24 January 2016. Ismayilova's arrest was condemned by the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media Dunja Mijatović, Reporters Without Borders, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe President Anne Brasseur, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, the U.S. Department of State, Amnesty International, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, Human Rights Watch, Freedom House, the Human Rights House Foundation, Index on Censorship, The Committee to Protect Journalists, the Civil Rights Defenders, the International Women's Media Foundation, the Civic Solidarity Platform, the International Press Institute, the European Union, the Global Investigative Journalism Network, and the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights. Travel ban Khadija Ismayilova was detained in December 2014 and sentenced in September 2015 to seven-and-a-half years in prison on trumped-up charges. She was conditionally released in May 2016, but three and a half years later, still remains subject to a travel ban and has been unable to leave the country despite numerous applications to do so. Lawyers will be seeking permission for Ismayilova to travel to the UK to give evidence in the trial of Paul Radu, a Romanian journalist who is co-founder and executive director of investigative reporting group OCCRP (the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project). Radu is being sued for defamation in London by Azerbaijani MP, Javanshir Feyziyev, over two articles in OCCRP’s award-winning Azerbaijan Laundromat series about money-laundering out of Azerbaijan. Ismayilova, OCCRP’s lead reporter in Azerbaijan, is a key witness in the case.Reporters Without Borders, Index on Censorship and Transparency International UK urge Azerbaijan to lift journalist’s travel ban Awards * 2012 (May 24) - Gerd Bucerius Free Press of Eastern Europe Award by Zeit-Stiftung in Hamburg, Germany.

Geography The Nemiscau River flows into Lake Nemiscau. The Nemiscau River flows over a hundred kilometers north-east to south-west in the Nord-du-Québec (administrative region) passing south of the hamlet of Nemaska. The river takes its waters from a set of lakes to the east and southeast of the Eastmain Reservoir; the upper lake is 5.7 km south of Eastmain or at the east of a highest peak at 450 meters. In this very complex headwaters, the river passes through numerous lakes and marshes, such as Cramoisy lakes, Teilhard, Biggar and Mountains. Neighboring hydrographic watersheds are: * North side: Pontax River, Eastmain River, Eastmain Reservoir; * South side: Rupert River; * West side: Lake Nemiscau. At the end of its course, the river flows in norther edge of Lake Nemiscau, which matches the shape of a U open towards the northeast. The other end of this U receive waters from Rupert River. The Lake Nemiscau is located north of Lake Giffard and Lake Evans, and to the south of the Jolliet Lake. Toponymy In 1672, the explorer Charles Albanel (Catholic priest) had given the name \\"Nemiskausipiou\\" to name what is today the Rupert River. During his 1679 trip, Louis Jolliet was also used \\"Nemisco\\" to describe the current Rupert River. Handwritten notes indicate Jolliet, \\"My land was entered by the Saguenay, which comes close to a large lake, named \\"Timigaming\\" (the Lake Mistassini), the source River Némiskau (ie Rupert), which discharges into the North Bay (the James Bay), on which I made my way to the sea.\\" The \\"Nemiscau\\" name designating the current river has been in use since the 1940s. Because of upwelling, this river became the Nemiscau Lake, before the waters join the Rupert River. In 1982, the Commission de toponymie du Québec (English: Quebec Names Board) formalized the movement toponymique pointing this river \\"Rivière Nemiscau\\". In 1690, maps refer to the name \\"Rupert\\" which refers to the river and the fort. Subsequently, the maps of Claude-Charles Bacqueville de La Potherie use the spelling \\"R. Rupert\\" and those of Father Laure in 1731-1732 \\"R. Rupert.\\" In 1744, Nicolas Bellin also uses graphieu \\"R. Nemiscau\\". Later, the name \\"Rupert River\\" prevailed until the twentieth century. The place name Nemiscau was recovered, but moving to the northeast to identify the branch of the river remained unnamed until the 1940s.

The photo of the reverse (pictured) shows half of Paragraph III, and some of the signs (out of focus). The letter is from King Burra-Buriyaš of Babylon (furthest country writing to Egypt) and is to the Pharaoh of Egypt (Egypt named Misri at Amarna letters time). Of note, the Pharaoh is named Neb- Kheper-Ra, (meaning King-Manifested-Ra), (King-transformed-(as)-Ra), and is spelled in cuneiform signs, Né-(ni)-eB iK-Pa-Ri, Ri-(iya), for \\"Neb-Kheper- Ra-(mine)\\", \\"(My) King, manifested Ra\\". The introductory, and salutory Paragraph I, highlights, peace (šalāmu-shu-ul-mu) for King Burnaburiash, and wishes peace, and well-being to the Pharaoh, and on the many contingents of the Pharaoh's charge, wife, army, the country, etc. Paragraph II highlights the need for gold, for building a mausoleum for Burnaburiash's father, and is an involved paragraph discussing the ancestor father-king's relationships, and the desire for continued good relations, and the exchange of peace gifts between the 'brother kings'. Paragraph III highlights the intrigues of economic and country relationships. Ascending country emissaries, and the vying for trade, and economic trading rights. A dialogue is contained in the paragraph, between the history, and what Burnaburiash would like to see done in the future. The Amarna letters, about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are a mid 14th century BC, about 1350 BC and 20 years later, correspondence. The initial corpus of letters were found at Akhenaten's city Akhetaten, in the floor of the Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh; others were later found, adding to the body of letters.

Early career Robins finished his medical training and residencies at Harvard, where he worked under biologically-oriented psychiatrist Mandel E. Cohen who would greatly influence his career and with whom he first developed ideas about operational definitions for psychiatric conditions (the theory of operationalization having been recently advanced by Harvard physicist and philosopher of science Percy Williams Bridgman). Robins rejected the then dominant psychoanalysis, having personally undergone it for a year as was the norm in training, describing it as 'silly' (he also had a relative who committed suicide at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital while being treated with psychoanalytic methods).The Making of DSM-III: A Diagnostic Manual's Conquest of American Psychiatry Hannah Decker, Oxford University Press, 13 June 2013. Chapter 3. Move to St. Louis Robins moved to the psychiatric department at Washington University in St. Louis in 1949, initially as a pharmacology fellow working in the lab of biochemist Oliver H. Lowry, author of the most cited scientific paper ever (on a method for measuring proteins).A Tribute to Eli and Lee Robins - Citation Superstars. A Citationist Perspective on Biological Psychiatry Institute for Scientific Information, 1989 Throughout his career he published on brain neurochemistry and histology. He would be author on more than 175 peer-reviewed articles, including on suicide, hysteria, homosexuality and depression. In 1956/57 he conducted a large-scale community-based study of suicides in St Louis which involved detailed structured interviews with people who had been in regular contact with the person beforehand. This has been noted as the first completed example of a practice that was shortly thereafter termed psychological autopsy by researchers in Los Angeles (coiner Edwin S. Shneidman).Assessment and Prediction of Suicide Ronald W. Maris, American Association of Suicidology, Guilford Press, 1992. Chapter 8: Assessment in absentia.

Robins became department head in 1963, despite having early signs of what would later be diagnosed as probable multiple sclerosis. He was married to Lee Robins, a sociologist associate of psychiatry at Washington. Developing diagnostic criteria Robins formed a close working trio with Samuel Guze and George Winokur, and from the late 1950s they developed criteria sets for a 'medical model of psychiatric disorders'Training at Washington University School of Medicine in Psychiatry in the late 1950s, from the perspective of an affective disorder researcher. Clayton PJ., J Affect Disord. 2006 May;92(1):13-7. Influential psychiatrist Gerald Klerman approvingly dubbed the approach \\"neo-Kraepelinian\\" in 1978. The trio were influenced by the classification system and diagnostic principles of German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin, and more recently by a textbook Clinical Psychiatry by British psychiatrists, principally Willy Mayer-Gross who had previously worked in Germany at the same institute as Kraepelin. Led by Robins, the trio published with several others in 1972 the so-called Feighner Criteria (named after the then junior psychiatrist John Feighner who was lead author on the paper, which would become the most cited in psychiatry). This led through into the Research Diagnostic Criteria developed with Robert Spitzer and others, which ultimately shaped the influential third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association. His wife Lee was also involved in the developments.

The L.I was a large biplane with a wingspan of . The wing was straight edged and of constant chord and divided into two outer bays on each side by three sets of parallel interplane struts and diagonal flying wires. Ailerons were fitted to both upper and lower planes, projecting behind the upper trailing edge and externally rod connected. On each side a square section tailboom or fuselage was joined to the wing structure between the innermost interplane struts and the central nacelle by more complicated bracing.

NILIS focuses on graduate education in Library Science, and Information Management. Objectives It is estimated that Sri Lanka has about 10,000 libraries and information centres are there, scattered in the higher education, education, government, semi- government, local government, private,NGO and other sectors. Up to the year 2000 only University of Kelaniya provided degree and postgraduate courses at university level in the field. With the establishment of NILIS, the postgraduate and general training facilities in the field has been expanded. The primary objective of the institute is to train the human resources required for the huge school library sector in the country. In addition it has been empowered by the NILIS Ordinance of 1999 to conduct other postgraduate programmes in the Library and Information Science (LIS) field and produce the necessary high quality human resources for universities, research institutes, government departments, local government authorities and other library and information sectors in the country. Another major objective is to develop a continuing professional development (CPD) programmes for LIS professionals to update and upgrade their skills and knowledge. History The National Institute of Library and Information Sciences (NILIS), University of Colombo was established in 1999. The purpose of the institute is to provide postgraduate and general training facilities in the Library and Information Science field with special attention to the school/teacher librarianship. The establishment of the institute was a result of the World Bank funded General Education Project 2, (GEP 2). The purpose of the GEP 2 was to improve the different education sectors in Sri Lanka including the School Library sector. Under the project 4,000 school libraries were developed. When the World Bank mission was working in close cooperation with the National Library and Documentation Services Board (NLDSB) which was the local counterpart of the School Library sub sector, the NLDSB proposed to establish a training institute to support the school library development programme at the latter part of the project. The proposal was accepted and the World Bank advisory team of the project invited the NLDSB to submit a suitable proposal for consideration. Then NLDSB developed the NILIS project proposal with the help of a local consultant (Prof. W B Dorakumbura) who prepared the proposal with the assistance of the professional staff of NLDSB. They used the initial University Grants Commission (UGC) Inter University Committee of Librarians (IUCL) proposal to establish a Postgraduate Institute in Library and Information Science. However, they developed a new proposal to meet the special requirements of the school library sector and LIS sector in general with special attention to the objectives of the GEP 2 project. This proposal was accepted by the authorities with minor modifications and became the foundation of the NILIS.

During a 13-year professional career he amassed Primeira Liga totals of 112 games and two goals in 11 seasons, representing five clubs including Sporting and Benfica. Club career Born in Singen, Germany to Portuguese parents, Marinho returned to the land of his ancestors and joined Sporting Clube de Portugal's youth system at the age of 13. Initially a midfielder, he made his competitive debut on 8 March 1989 in a game against F.C. Vizela for the Taça de Portugal, after coming on as a substitute for Paulo Silas. In the following year, manager Raul Águas converted Marinho into a right back, where he went on to appear in most of his 81 competitive games, eventually beating competition from Fernando Nélson. However, after playing in only ten league games in his last two seasons combined, he signed for crosstown rivals S.L. Benfica in 1995 as a replacement for Abel Xavier. He played his first game for Benfica in a home draw against Salgueiros on 6 September 1995 and went on to make 24 appearances in all competitions, helping them win the 1995–96 Taça de Portugal. He remained in starting eleven in 1996–97, appearing in 21 games. but with the rise of José Sousa in the following year, he was deemed surplus to Manuel José and joined fellow Primeira Liga side S.C. Campomaiorense. He featured rarely for that team and his following, C.F. Estrela da Amadora, this being interspersed by two years of inactivity. International career Marinho represented the under-21 side of the national team at the 1992 Toulon Tournament, playing three games and helping them win the competition.

He was a tail-end left-handed batsman and a left-arm fast-medium in-swing bowler who played first-class cricket for Leicestershire from 1937 to 1952. He was born in Thornton, Leicestershire and died there as well. Pre-war cricket Sperry was a miner at Bagworth colliery who was 27 before he appeared in senior cricket. He made his first-class debut for Leicestershire in a single match in 1937 when he made little impression, failing to take a wicket and not being required to bat. In 1938, with the decline and imminent retirement of George Geary, who had been the mainstay of the bowling attack since before the First World War, Leicestershire gave Sperry an extended trial in the second half of the season and he responded with 27 wickets. The 1939 season was a very poor one for Leicestershire, who finished at the bottom of the County Championship, but Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted \\"notable advancement\\" by Sperry who, it said, often endured long spells of work\\". In all matches, he was the county's biggest wicket-taker, with 78 wickets at an average of 23.88. Leicestershire won only one match all season, and Sperry was at the heart of it: in the match against Hampshire, he took seven-second innings wickets for 19 runs, to give match figures of 10 for 71 – the innings figures would remain the best of his career. After the game, Sperry was presented with the ball, inscribed by the Leicestershire County Club committee; he was also awarded his county cap in the 1939 season. Post-war cricket The Leicestershire club that Sperry returned to in 1946 after the Second World War was a rather different side from that of 1939: other seam bowlers such as William Flamson and Haydon Smith were either dead or retired, and the attack centred on the spin bowling of Jack Walsh and Vic Jackson. Sperry played regularly in the first six post-war seasons as often the only regular seam bowler, sometimes having Jackson's off-breaks as the other opening bowler. His best return was in the 1948 season, when he took 81 wickets in all matches at an average of 23.55; his average was better in 1951, when his 62 wickets cost just 22.70, but in some other seasons he averaged more than 33 runs per wicket, high for a regular bowler in the period in which he played. He retired at the age of 41 after the 1951 season but returned for two games in 1952 when he was granted a benefit match by Leicestershire. Sperry's only first-class match that was not for Leicestershire came in 1947, when he appeared in a festival match at Harrogate in which two teams composed largely of county rather than Test players played a game organised by Maurice Leyland, who had retired from full-time cricket the previous year. In his obituary in the 1998 edition of Wisden the Leicestershire cricket historian Philip Snow was quoted: \\"(Sperry) appeared frail, but would bowl loyally until the point of fatigue. A rather lugubrious, pallid countenance hid unfailing amiability. He was a man of excellent team spirit.\\" References Category:1910 births Category:1997 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:Leicestershire cricketers ","title":"James Sperry"},{"id":"40211479","text":"Kyllinga nemoralis, the white water sedge or whitehead spikesedge, is a plant species in the sedge family, Cyperaceae.
