His daughter, quoted in 2004, gave his age as 27, but in 2008 gave it as 25. – 18 May 1959), a Jamaican mento musician credited with \\"helping start the calypso craze in U.S.\\" With his band The Calypsonians, Flea toured America throughout the late 1950s, and released an album on the Capitol label. The band also performed in two calypso-related films. Career Thomas was born in Kingston, Jamaica, and began his career in entertainment at local dancehalls such as the \\"Adastra Gardens\\" and \\"Success\\". In 1949, he earned himself a year-long engagement after he had performed in the talent competitions held at the Sugar Hill Club. Flea recorded and released records with the assistance of local business men, Alec Durie and Ken Khouri.\\"Unsung Heroes A Good Time To Reflect\\", Jamaica Gleaner, 4 January 2015. Retrieved 4 January 2015 Early singles featuring Flea's vocal performances were attributed to \\"The Blue Mountain Caroleers\\" or \\"The Jamaican Calypsonians\\". Bill Saxon, owner of 'Club Calypso' on Biscayne Boulevard in Miami, traveled to Jamaica in order to search out an 'authentic sound' for his Florida venue. Saxon offered a residency lasting from two to six months, with the proviso that those artists that wished to apply for the gig, must have previously recorded some music. Lord Flea & his Calypsonians soon received a contract and began to perform for six months in America. The music produced by Lord Flea and other artists from the Caribbean islands was marketed as 'calypso' but Flea's style was actually known as 'mento'. In a 1957 interview for the UK Calypso Star magazine, Lord Flea explained: \\"In Jamaica, we call our music 'mento' until very recently. Today, 'calypso' is beginning to be used for all kinds of West Indian music. This is because it's become so commercialized there. Some people like to think of West Indians as carefree natives who work and sing and play and laugh their lives away. But this isn't so. Most of the people there are hard working folks, and many of them are smart business men. If the tourists want \\"calypso\\", that's what we sell them.\\" Members of the Calypsonians assumed colorful stage-names. Besides Lord Flea himself, the band adopted such memorable pseudonyms as Count Slick, Count Spoon, and Prince Charles. The Calypsonians' bassist was called Fish Ray — an early exponent of the \\"walking bass\\" technique. Lord Flea and his Calypsonians appeared in the edition of 11 February 1957 of Life magazine, in an article entitled \\"U.S. Tourists Rush to the Caribbean\\". The piece contained a photograph of Lord Flea performing at the Jamaican Room. Fellow bandmate Pork Chops can be seen in the picture alongside Flea, with the Calypsonians' bongo-player sat high upon a large barrel. That year also saw the band featured in more musically-orientated US magazines such as Hep Cat's Review and Calypso, as well as the UK's first issue of Calypso Star. On 9 February 1957 Lord Flea & His Calypsonians appeared on The Perry Como Show where they performed \\"Shake Shake Sonora\\" and \\"Where Did The Naughty Little Flea Go?\\" Little Flea's version of \\"Shake Shake Sonora\\" (later to be covered by Harry Belafonte) was reviewed in February 1957 by Billboard, which stated that: \\"Flea has a dynamic drive..\\" and that the single \\"could put many to shame.\\" The review also added that Lord Flea & His Calypsonians produced \\"attention-grabbing sides [which] can stir action at all levels.\\" The late 1950s calypso craze extended to the film world. Rising star Lord Flea and his band appeared in two films released in 1957. The Calypsonians feature in Calypso Joe, and they perform several numbers in Bop Girl Goes Calypso, a film that has been pronounced \\"dead on arrival\\" and criticized as a \\"painful United Artists mistake\\", in which a psychologist studying \\"Mass Hysteria and the Popular Singer\\" persuades the \\"Bop Girl\\" of the title to embrace the \\"calypso\\" style, and to abandon her previous rock'n'roll singing technique. The band played ceaselessly in America throughout the calypso craze. The band performed at Eden Roc Hotel for six months, and in Las Vegas at the Dunes, \\"Flea chalked up new house records, as he [had] been doing the past few months in New York's Jamaica Room.\\" Unfortunately for the Caribbean mento/calypso artists, as Time magazine had already noted in March 1957: \\"Financially, American imitators are doing better than such authentic calypso singers as The Duke of Iron, or Lord Flea and His Calypsonians (Lord Fish Ray, Count Spoon, et al), whose cleaned-up version of the nocturnal wanderings of a flea is also a nightclub favorite.\\" Death Suffering from Hodgkin's Disease, Lord Flea was admitted to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami in 1959. According to daughter Kathie Way-Giddarie: \\"Each evening during his hospital stay, he would play music for the doctors, nurses and the patients on the isolation ward.\\" On 18 May 1959 (at the age of either 25 or 27), Lord Flea died. Thomas's subsequent funeral procession was, at the time, the longest ever seen in Miami-Dade County. Subject matter In \\"Mister Give Me Ma Rent\\", the Lord tells of a problem landlady who is \\"..too rude – in my affairs she likes to intrude..\\"\\"Mister Pay Me Ma Rent\\", Lord Flea & his Calypsonians (Capitol, 1957). The song goes on to depict financial woes and poor accommodation common to many Jamaicans of the time: In his \\"Calypso Be Bop\\", Flea name-checks his Bebop heroes. Dizzy Gillespie's \\"Anthropology\\" apparently sent Flea 'crazy'. Charlie Parker receives a mention, the song refers to Miles Davis as a 'smasher', and Jazz legend Lionel Hampton is also recommended to the listener: In an interview Lord Flea revealed his thoughts about the West Indian outlook on life, stating that: \\"The islanders know how to get more out of life. They don't worry as much as Americans do about unimportant things, I mean. You can say they just sing and dance their troubles away — and it beats psychoanalysis, you can bet.\\" He went on to say that: \\"West Indians have the best sense of humor in the world. Even the most solemn song, like \\"Las Kean Fine\\" (\\"Lost and Can Not Be Found\\"), which tells of a boiler explosion on a sugar plantation that killed several of the workers, their natural wit and humor shine though.\\" \\"Monkey\\" has unusual subject matter. Awaking one morning to find a monkey at his garden gate, Lord Flea sings of how the monkey proceeds to follow him about wherever he goes, even going so far as to start copying Flea's actions: \\"When I put on shoes — monkey wears shoes too.. I don't what to say, the monkey won't do!\\"\\"Monkey\\", Lord Flea & his Calypsonians (Capitol, 1957) Other humorous moments abound in Flea's work. \\"Donkey Bray\\" features Lord Flea braying the chorus with gusto, and in the Calypsonians' \\"Pretty Woman\\", Flea advises that \\"Love is the common enemy\\", and begs that you should \\"Run, run, run! When you see a pretty woman\\".\\"Pretty Woman\\", Lord Flea & his Calypsonians (Capitol, 1957) Covers In 1961 Harry Belafonte recorded a version of Lord Flea's \\"Shake Shake Sonora\\" which was renamed \\"Jump in the Line (Shake, Senora)\\" and later appeared in the 1988 film Beetlejuice. Flea had used Lord Invader's earlier 1955 recording \\"Labor Day (Jump in the Line)\\" for inspiration, which itself was a cover of Lord Kitchener's original \\"Jump in the Line and Wag Your Body in Time\\" of 1946. \\"Where Did The Naughty Little Flea Go?\\" has been also been covered by Belafonte (who stated that Lord Flea was the song's composer), as well as Miriam Makeba, and Toots and the Maytals amongst others. Thomas' daughter recalled asking her father about the meaning behind \\"The Naughty Little Flea\\": \\"His answer to me was that 'when he was gone that there would be another, then another and then another.'\\" Discography Singles \\"Ol Fowl\\" b/w \\"Irene & Yo' Fr'en\\" – with the Blue Blue Mountain Caroleers (1953 Calypsodisc label CT.100) (Savoy Record Shop) \\"Man Forty Leg\\" b/w \\"The Number One\\" – with the Blue Mountain Caroleers (1953 CT 101 AT/3 AT/4 Calypsotime label, and also Calypsodisc) \\"Wheel and Turn Me\\" b/w \\"Matty Rag\\" / \\"Brown Skin Gal\\" – with the Jamaican Calypsonians (Times Record label UD 1003 D JAM 103/D JAM 104) (\\"Wheel and Turn Me\\" appears on the 2006 CD compilation Take Me To Jamaica) \\"Donkey City\\" b/w \\"Run Mongoose\\" / \\"Linstead Market\\" – with the Jamaican Calypsonians (Times Record label UD 1003 D JAM 105/D JAM 106) \\"Time So Hard\\" / \\"Old Lady\\" b/w \\"Solas Market\\" / \\"Water Come From Me Eye\\" – with the Jamaican Calypsonians (Times Record label UD 1003 D JAM 101/D JAM 102) Six of Lord Flea's Ken Khouri Times Record sides appear on the compilation LP Calypsos From Jamaica: 1\\\\. \\"Time so Hard\\" / \\"Old Lady\\" b/w \\"Solas Market\\" / \\"Water Comes From My Eye\\". 2\\\\. \\"Wheel and Turn Me\\" b/w \\"Mattie Rag\\" / \\"Brown Skin Gal\\". 3\\\\.

The College of Design includes the full range of design disciplines and is home to eight undergraduate majors in the fields of architecture, apparel design, graphic design, interior design, landscape architecture, product design, and retail merchandising. There are 23 graduate degree programs, eight undergraduate minors, nine research centers, and the Goldstein Museum of Design. Campuses The College of Design is located on both the Minneapolis and St. Paul campuses of the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. The programs of apparel design, graphic design, interior design, housing studies, and retail merchandising are located in McNeal Hall on the St. Paul campus. The Goldstein Museum of Design is also located in McNeal Hall. On the Minneapolis campus the College of Design is located in Rapson Hall, where the architecture, landscape architecture, and product design programs are housed, and at 1425 University Ave. where the Center for Sustainable Building Research and two studio spaces are located.  History  In 2006, the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities launched a strategic initiative that created the College of Design by uniting the Department of Design, Housing, and Apparel from the College of Human Ecology with the College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture.  Department of Design, Housing, and Apparel  The Department of Design, Housing, and Apparel (DHA) can trace its roots back to 1871 in the University of Minnesota School of Agriculture. Courses were designed to appeal to the growing number of women seeking higher education, which led to the establishment of the Home Economics Department in 1900. Wylle B. McNeal, for whom the St. Paul Campus building is named, became the head of Home Economics in 1923 and would continue to champion the new programs until her retirement in 1950. Harriet and Vetta Goldstein joined the faculty in 1913 and 1915, respectively, and spearheaded the development of the design curriculum. In the 1970s, a strategic reorganization lead to the creation of the College of Home Economics, which was separated into four departments: * Design * Family Social Science * Food Science and Nutrition * Textiles and Clothing It was during this time of change that a major addition and renovation occurred: three separate buildings were joined together into what is recognized today as McNeal Hall. When the renovation was completed in 1976, the Goldstein Gallery (now the Goldstein Museum of Design) opened and featured exhibits that brought together students, faculty, and the community in a unique extension of the classroom.Gorrill, Darlene, et al. Journey Home: College of Human Ecology, 1894-1996. University of Minnesota, College of Human Ecology, 1998. In 1983, the Department of Design merged with the Department of Textiles and Clothing, to form DHA. Programs of study included costume design (later apparel design), applied design (later graphic design), housing studies, interior design, retail merchandising, and textiles and clothing. Eventually, the textiles and clothing major was closed. The product design major was added in 2016.  Department of Landscape Architecture  In 1965, the University Regents established the Bachelor of Landscape Architecture Degree (BLA) and hired Roger Martin head the program. Two years later, the first courses for this degree were offered within the School of Architecture. At the time, programs in Landscape Architecture were being offered through both the School of Architecture and through the Department of Horticultural Science in the College of Agriculture. In 1968, a joint administrative agreement was reached which would split both the faculty and the funding for BLA programs between the School of Architecture and the Department of Horticultural Science. The Masters in Landscape Architecture program was first accredited in 1976. During that same year the faculty reevaluated the curriculum to focus on the integration of ‘art’ and ‘ecology’ and later added the theme of ‘community.’ Faculty committed themselves to curricular, research, and outreach activities dedicated to transforming practice to meet the broadening spectrum of issues faced by landscape architects.  School of Architecture  In 1869 the first president of the newly founded University of Minnesota made the study of architecture available within the College of Mechanic Arts, later named the College of Engineering and Architecture, then the Institute of Technology, now the College of Science and Engineering. By the end of the First World War, the School of Architecture had established a nationally-recognized curriculum in architecture and the relationship between the teaching and practice of architecture became more intense. In 1954, Ralph Rapson, for whom the Minneapolis building is named,Mack, Linda. \\"COMMENTARY; U addition offers rooms with a view.(ENTERTAINMENT).\\" Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN).

The ultimate goal of the school was to produce graduates who had acquired the fundamental skills and knowledge of architecture and landscape architecture, but who had also learned to question and challenge its limits. In 1989, the School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture (SALA) officially separated from the Institute of Technology and became the College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture (CALA) under the leadership of Dean Harrison Fraker and, in 1996, followed by Dean Tom Fisher.100 Years of Student Drawings: Celebrating the School of Architecture’s Centennial, 1913-2013.

At its greatest extent, it included all of the modern counties of Fingal, Meath (which takes its name from the kingdom), Westmeath as well as parts of counties Cavan, Kildare, Longford, Louth and Offaly. The Lordship or fiefdom was imbued with privileges enjoyed in no other Irish liberty, including the four royal pleas of arson, forestalling, rape, and treasure trove.  Background  Following the Norman invasion of Ireland, King Henry II visited Ireland in 1171 to establish his authority over both Norman adventurers and the native Irish. He failed, however, to bring the country under a single, centralised control.The Irish Story – John Dorney, \\"The Castle in the Lordship of Ireland, 1177–1310\\". Henry only claimed the title \\"Lord of Ireland\\", which he passed to his son, John \\"Lackland\\". John and his successors remained as Lords of Ireland until the 16th century. Instead of a central government, the royal policy was to promote individual lordships. As a secondary objective, Henry aimed to break the power of Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (commonly called \\"Strongbow\\") and to divide the Geraldines. He recognised that he was unable to curb their ambitions but wished to avoid any one baron having such a base of power as might one day threaten his own realm.'’Hull, Eleanor'’, \\"A History of Ireland\\", Volume 1, Chapter V, 1931. He therefore awarded offices and the lands of the newly created lordships to new men – his own loyalists. Consistent with this plan, he kept the major ports of Waterford, Cork and Dublin in his own hands, as well as a strip of the Wicklow coast. He replaced Maurice FitzGerald as \\"Keeper of Dublin\\" with Hervey de Clare, Lord of Montmorency who was FitzGerald's brother-in-law and Strongbow's uncle. Montmorency also took over command of Strongbow's forces from Raymond le gros who was recalled to Wales by the King. He also took another prime mover in the invasion – Miles de Cogan – to Wales. In March 1172, the King granted the Lordship of Meath to Hugh de Lacy by service of fifty knights. On John de Courcy he bestowed Ulster \\"if he could conquer it.\\" These lords were reliant on their own aggression for laying claim to their lands and for securing them. Castles, by virtue of their defensive and offensive capabilities as well as their symbolic status, were indispensable for dominating the area of the lordship.The Irish Story – John Dorney, \\"The Castle in the Lordship of Ireland, 1177–1310\\". Grant to de Lacy The grant of Meath was not accepted by Tighearnán Ó Ruairc, King of Bréifne, who ruled it at that time. Following a confrontation at the Hill of Ward in early 1172, Ó Ruairc was slain and de Lacy assumed control. King Henry preferred Hugh de Lacy over Strongbow in the positions of Justiciar and of Constable of Dublin Castle. The grant was on the basis of grand serjeanty for his services as bailiff to the King.Thomas Duffus Hardy (editor), Rotuli Chartarum in Turri Londinensi Asservati, published in 1837; page 178, volume 1, part 1 (available in the Tower of London with copy in the Guildhall Library, London, containing the original text of the Grant of Fingal by King John, 1208) De Lacy chose the barons Robert Fitz-Stephen, Maurice FitzGerald, Meiler Fitzhenry and Miles FitzDavid to garrison the city. This kept them apart from Strongbow. On 17 April 1172, Henry sailed from Ireland never to return. Hugh also returned to England in late 1172 and spend much of the following year fighting for Henry in France. He was sent over to Ireland as procurator-general in 1177, Richard de Clare having died shortly before. The grant of Meath was now confirmed, with the addition of Offelana, Offaly, Kildare, and Wicklow.Gesta Henrici, ii. 161, 163–4; Giraldus, v. 347. This left Hugh in possession of most of the over-kingdom of Leinster, in addition to the Kingdom of Meath, with exception of the city of Dublin and the southern principalities of Ossory and Hy- Kinsellagh () (centred on the modern county of Wexford).Library of Ireland – The Castle of Trim. In 1181, he was recalled from his government for having married Rose Ní Conchobair, the daughter of Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, King of Connaught without leave of Henry. The following year he was restored to his offices. After Hugh's death in 1186, the lordship passed, after a period of wardship, to his son, Walter. A charter from 1191, shows Walter exercising lordship in Meath. As Lord of Ireland, John deprived de Lacy of Meath in 1192.Colin T. Veach, \\"A question of timing: Walter de Lacy's seisin of Meath 1189–94\\", Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Section C, Volume 109 / 2009, Pg 165–194. This action was overturned by King Richard the Lionheart upon the latter's return from the Third Crusade in 1194. By letters patent from John, King of England,John, previously Prince, Lord of Ireland and Earl of Mortain, was crowned King of England in 1199: \\"Rex Angliae, Dominus Hiberniae, Dux Normanniae et Aquitanniae, et Comes Andegaviae, coronatus fuit in festo ascensionis Dominicae, A.D. 1199\\" the prescriptive barony was granted to Walter de Lacy and his heirs in perpetuity in 1208. The grant describes the scope of administrative responsibility, and the limits of powers delegated: > \\"Grant and confirmation to Walter de Lascy, on his petition, of his land of > Meath; to hold of the King in fee by the service of 50 knights; and of his > fees of Fingal, in the vale of Dublin; to hold in fee by the service of 7 > knights; saving to the King pleas of the Crown, appeals of the peace, & c., > and crociae, and the dignities thereto belonging; the King’s writs to run > throughout Walter’s land.

William, Maud and their son William were declared traitors to the Crown by King John. Maud and her son fled to Ireland to the protection of her daughter Margaret. In 1210, they were again obliged to flee but were apprehended on the Antrim coast. Imprisoned in the dungeon of Corfe Castle, Dorset, they were left to starve to death.Extract E:Histoire des Ducs de Normandie et des Rois d' Angleterre,ed. Francique Michel (Paris 1840 As punishment for having harboured traitors within his castle, Walter de Lacy's estates were forfeited to the Crown. By 1215, Walter and Margaret were back in the King's favour and Walter's confiscated estates were restored to him. Together Walter and Margaret had at least six children including Gilbert de Lacy. As Gilbert predeceased his father on 25 December 1230, Walter's vast estates in Ireland and England passed to Gilbert's daughters, Margery and Maud. Settlements c. 1200 Motte-and-bailey built by Hugh de Lacy at Clonard, Co Meath Henry II granted Hugh de Lacy \\"the land of Meath in as full a measure as Murchadh...or anyone before or after him held it.\\". By this grant, de Lacy's power was equal to that of the king himself, the only reservation being that the king could dispose of Church lands anywhere. A person with this jurisdiction was known as a Count and the territory over which he ruled was called a county. As the ruler of a county palatine he created his own feudal baronies, held directly from himself in capite. His vassals were commonly called \\"De Lacy's Barons\\".Vicissitudes of Families by Sir Bernard Burke, Ulster King of Arms, Longman Green Longman and Roberts, Paternoster Row, London, 1861 (pages 363–364) Known as a great builder of castles, by c. 1200, de Lacy had settlements all over the lordship, either in his own hands or the hands of his barons. With his son Walter (1180–1240) he built Trim Castle and Kilkea Castle. Some time after 1196, Walter, granted \\"the whole land of Rathtowth\\" to his younger brother, Hugh. This sub-division, named the Barony of Ratoath, was perhaps the first instance of the use of the term barony in Ireland for a division of a county. According to The Song of Dermot and the Earl (a 12th-century Norman French poem), the land may have been divided the land among the following barons : * In Fingal: Hugh Tyrrel, who obtained the barony of Castleknock and whose stronghold was Castleknock Castle * In County Louth: the castle and borough of Drogheda (in his own hands) * In County Meath. :* Gilbert de Angulo (or Gilbert de Nangle), who became Baron of Navan and obtained the barony of Morgallion. His son Jocelin also obtained Navan. Their stronghold was the castle of Nobber. :* Adam de Feypo (or Adam de Phepoe), who obtained Skreen by charter. :* Hugh de Hose (or Sir Hugh Hussey Kt.), who became Baron of Galtrim with castles at Galtrim and Derrypatrick (which lie between Trim and Dunshaughlin). :* Adam Dullard (or Adam Dollard) whose stronghold was at Dollardstown (which lies between Slane and Navan). :* Gilbert de Nugent, Baron of Delvin and later Earl of Westmeath whose stronghold was at Nugentstown, south of Kells. :* William le Petit; who obtained Castlebrack, Magherdernon and Rathkenny; :* Other castles are located at Kells, Slane, Duleek, Athboy and Clonard. :* The county also contained boroughs at Kells, Skreen, Trim, Ratoath and Greenogue (on the Broadmeadow water). * In County Westmeath. :*Risteárd de Tiúit, who received the Barony of Moyashel centred on Dysart, Mullingar and Rathconel (from west to east) :* Robert de Lacy, who obtained Rathwire. :*Geoffrey de Constantine, who obtained 'good and fine land' near Rathconrath and Kilbixy (near Lough Iron). :*Meiler Fitz Henry, who obtained Ardnorcher or Horseleap (on the border of County Offaly). :* Other castles are located at Fore (near Lough Lene), Delvin, Ballymore (near the Hill of Uisneach), Killare. * In County Offaly: the castle at Durrow * In County Longford: Risteárd de Tiúit also built Granard Motte. It was one of the largest Motte-and-bailey castles in Ireland. * Other barons mentioned in \\"The Song of Dermot and the Earl\\", without naming their strongholds are William de Misset, Gilbert FitzThomas, Hussey, Thomas Fleming and Richard de Lachapelle.  The Lordship split Upon the death of Walter, the 2nd Lord of Meath, the lordship was split between his granddaughters; the western part was awarded to Margery while the eastern part, centred on Trim, was awarded to Maud. Western Meath The western part passed to Margery's husband, John de Verdun (circa 1226 – 21 Oct 1274) on their marriage sometime before 1244. He was the son of Theobald le Botiller, 2nd Chief Butler of Ireland by his second wife, Rohese de Verdun (circa 1204 – 10 February 1247). The de Verdun family was already a substantial landholder in what is now County Louth. Rohese's grandfather, Bertram de Verdun, was part of John's first expedition to Ireland.De Verdun family tree John De Verdun; son of Rohese De Verdun; daughter of Nicholas De Verdun; son of Bertram De Verdun Upon her husband's sudden death, she returned to the de Verdun lands and commissioned the building of Castle Roche. Her son John completed the work in 1236.Archiseek: The Architecture of Ireland . History of the Castle. They had issue Nicholas (circa 1244), John (circa 1246), Theobald (circa 1248), William (circa 1250), Thomas (circa 1252) and Agnes (circa 1254). Theobald was created 1st Lord de Verdun and also held the hereditary title \\"Constable of Ireland. He married Margery de Bohun, daughter of Sir Humphrey de Bohun and Eleanor de Braose, before 6 November 1276. He died on 24 August 1309 at Alton, Staffordshire. They had a son, also called Theobald (b. 8 Sep 1278, d. 27 Jul 1316). The 2nd Lord de Verdun had no male heirs. In 1317, the de Lacy heirs, based in Rathwire were defeated and exiled by Roger Mortimer, who was their relation by marriage. This resulted in the re-unification in the Lordship. Eastern Meath When Maud married for the second time, the lordships of Trim and Ludlow passed to her husband, Geoffrey de Geneville, 1st Baron Geneville by right of his marriage to her. King Henry III of England granted Geoffrey and Maud, and their heirs rights in the land of Meath held by her grandfather, by charter dated 8 August 1252. On 18 September 1254, the king granted them all the liberties and free customs in Meath which her grandfather had held; and they might issue their own writs in Meath according to the law and custom of Ireland. On 21 September 1252, they had livery of Trim Castle and a moiety of forty marcates of lands as the inheritance of Maud.The Complete Peerage, Vol. V (628–634) They made Trim Castle their chief residence. Maud and Geoffrey jointly ruled and administered their estates together in an equal partnership. They later donated property to Dore Abbey. They had issue Geoffrey (died 1283), Piers (died 1292) and Joan (died 1287). Geoffrey, having outlived his children, left his estate to his granddaughter, Joan, the daughter of his eldest son, Piers. Joan succeeded as the suo jure 2nd Baroness Geneville on 21 October 1314. She was the wife of Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March. In mid-November 1308, when Mortimer received the lordship from Joan's grandfather, he had only just come of age. For six of the following twelve years (1308–09, 1310–13, 1315, 1317–18, 1319–20), Roger resided in Ireland, establishing his lordship against his wife's relatives, the de Lacys of Rathwire. In November 1316, he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Following his rebellion against King Edward II of England in 1321–22, all his lands in England and Ireland were forfeited. However, the King was forced to abdicate on 24 January 1327 leaving the government in the hands of Queen Isabella and Mortimer who acted as regents for the Edward who was aged 14 years at the time. Rich estates and offices of profit and power were now heaped on Mortimer. In September 1328 he was created Earl of March and launched a spree of acquisition in Ireland, gaining custody of the western half of Meath during the minority of the de Verdun heiresses, with liberty status. This reestablished the Lordship of Meath, This state of affairs lasted until October 1330 when Edward III began to assert his independence. Mortimer and Isabella were seized by Edward and his companions from inside Nottingham Castle. Mortimer was accused of assuming royal power and of various other high misdemeanours, condemned without trial and ignominiously hanged at Tyburn on 29 November 1330. Once again, his vast estates forfeited to the crown.Costain, p.275 Mortimer's widow Joan received a pardon in 1336 and survived till 1356. She was buried beside Mortimer at Wigmore Abbey. List of Lords * Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath :* Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath. Walter's son, Gilbert de Lacy, predeceased his father. Gilbert was married to Isabel Bigod and they had two daughters who were joint heirs to their grandfather. The lordship was split between them; the western part was awarded to Margery while the eastern part, centred on Trim, was awarded to Maud de Lacy. List of lords of Trim * Geoffrey de Geneville, 1st Baron Geneville in right of his marriage to Maud. :* Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March in right of his marriage to Joan de Geneville, 2nd Baroness Geneville, granddaughter of the 1st Baron Geneville. He was accused of assuming royal power and was executed in 1330. It is probable that his Irish titles lapsed at his death. His grandson Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March regained his English estates and titles. Upon the death of his grandmother, Joan de Geneville, he also regained her estates, both in England and Ireland. However, it is not known if the Lordship of Meath was also restored. List of lords of West Meath * John de Verdun in right of his marriage to Margery. :* Theobald, 1st Lord de Verdun ::* Theobald, 2nd Lord de Verdun, son of the 1st Lord. As he had no male heirs, the lordship was re-absorbed into the original Lordship of Meath.

She served as a communications link between the regional capital of Western Norway, Bergen, and the various communities of Sogn og Fjordane county. Following the 9 April 1940 German invasion of Norway, she was requisitioned by the Norwegian authorities and carried troops for the Norwegian war effort until the forces in Western Norway ceased fighting on 2 May 1940. After a brief stint in German service, she returned to her civilian duties later in 1940, and was accidentally torpedoed and sunk by a German E-boat in Bergen on 29 March 1945. Construction and characteristics Kommandøren was one of four passenger/cargo steamships built for Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe at Norwegian shipyards around the turn of the 20th century. The four ships were constructed to supplement four smaller vessels built decades earlier at British shipyards. In addition to Kommandøren, which was seen as the flagship of the company's fleet, Lærdal, Balder and Stavenes were built between 1876 and 1904. The company sailed on cargo/passenger routes in Western Norway. Kommandøren was the largest of the new-builds, and was considered the grandest of the company vessels.Torvanger 2000, p. 30Torvanger 2000, p. 58 Delivered on 30 June 1891, Kommandøren was yard number 132 at Akers Mekaniske Værksted in Kristiania (modern-day Oslo), Norway. The steel- hulled ship measured , had a length of , a beam of and a draught of . Her 600 indicated horsepower/116 nominal horsepower 3-cylinder triple expansion steam engine could propel the ship at . Kommandøren cost the company to build and could take up to 249 passengers. Although much newer than the first ships operated by Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe, Kommandøren and the three other ships were only around faster than the mid-19th century vessels used by the company.Førsund 1998, p. 163 The new ship was named Kommandøren by Nordre Bergenhus amt county council, after the affectionate nickname of the county's shipping company's first executive director, Hugo Lous, who had held the rank of kommandørkaptein () in the Royal Norwegian Navy.Førsund 1998, p. 35Torvanger 2000, p. 59 To name the new ship after the executive director was an unusual decision, as most Norwegian ships of the era were named after place names, historical figures or royalty.Kolltveit 1982, p. 58 Built not only to carry people and cargo between the towns and villages of Western Norway, but also for the tourist trade, Kommandøren was fitted with a comparatively luxurious first class section. The 10-cabin, 36-bed, first class featured a smoking salon, a women's salon and a dining salon for the first class passengers and ship officers. A promenade deck gave views in all directions. The third class passengers had two salons, one on the main deck and one on the orlop (lowest) deck. On Kommandøren, the third class section was expanded and improved in comparison with earlier vessels, after complaints from passengers to the county council.Torvanger 2000, p. 60 The third class section of Kommandøren was described by the newspaper Sogns Tidende as \\"large, spacious and almost comfortably equipped. Kommandøren was home ported in Bergen.Nordanger 1975, p. 422 She had her maiden passenger voyage from Bergen to Sogn on 5 July 1891. Passenger/cargo and tourist service Kommandøren at anchor in Sandane in 1926 In the summer season, Kommandøren served the tourist trade in Sogn, while she sailed the regular passenger/cargo routes during the winter months. Kommandøren was generally used as an express route ship, often carrying patients on their way to treatment.Torvanger 2000, pp. 60–61 Amongst the cargo carried by was often live animals, including horses, cattle and sheep.Førsund 1998, p. 20 During one of her trips, Kommandøren ran aground on 20 October 1900 near Tjugum in Balestrand.Førsund 1998, p. 106 The ship was also at times employed to transport important dignitaries in the region, like she did in September 1920, when she brought politicians to Vik to inspect the area for a proposed railway project.Førsund 1998, p. 115 Shortly after delivery, in September 1892, Kommandøren provided transport support to a large-scale Norwegian Army field exercise in Western Norway. She was tasked with transporting troops from Gudvangen to Lærdalsøyri after the completion of the exercises.NN 1893, p. 35 In 1910, Kommandøren was modernized at Stavanger Støberi & Dok in Stavanger, gaining a new boiler for the steam engine and being painted white. In January the next year, she ran aground at Rongevær in the Fensfjord. She ran aground again in 1913, in Herdlefjorden.Torvanger 2000, p. 61 A rebuild in 1922 saw the ship's well deck built over, creating a flush deck profile. In 1930 the ship was refurbished and modernized. By this time, Kommandøren measured and .Pettersen 1992, p. 367 On 27 August 1928, Kommandøren ran aground at Opdalseldet in Bårdsundet off Tysnesøy Hordaland; she was refloated after all 350 passengers had been taken off. She ran aground yet again in April 1938, when she ran into the island Segløya while en route from Skjerjehamn to Eivindvik. The incident caused severe damage to the bottom of the hull. Second World War Norwegian Campaign =Troop ship= When Norway was invaded by Nazi Germany on 9 April, Kommandøren was not in the areas immediately captured by the invading Germans. She was thus able to continue her service in the Sognefjord for much of the month of April 1940. On 9 April 1940, Kommandøren was en route to Bergen, but was stopped at Høyanger and ordered to Sogn to assist in the mobilization of Norwegian Army units to oppose the Germans.Svartefoss 1994, p. 22Torvanger 2000, p. 62 Kommandøren was directed to transport troops from Dingja via several smaller villages to Nordeide and Gudvangen. Together with the steamer , she set out in the early morning of 10 April to retrieve troops. Kommandøren and the other ships of the company fleet were later praised by the regional police commander for their important role in the successful mobilization in Sogn og Fjordane.Svartefoss 1994, p. 23 =Bombing in the Sognefjord= On 25 April 1940, Kommandøren steamed in the Sognefjord, carrying regular passengers, as well as a load of around 100 soldiers bound for Gudvangen and Voss for service with the Norwegian Army's 4th Division. The soldiers brought in that day belonged to an older age group not called up in the initial mobilization drive. While en route from Vik to Balestrand, the steamer was bombed and strafed by a German bomber. The bombs did not hit the ship, and the machine gun bullets only did minor damage and caused no casualties.Svartefoss 1994, p. 47 After calling at Balestrand, Kommandøren proceeded to Leikanger, where the soldiers on board disembarked. While Kommandøren was docked at Leikanger, the village was attacked by a German aircraft. The aircraft dropped 11 bombs in three series on the area, before strafing people and cars on the ground. Amongst the targets were the soldiers unloaded by Kommandøren, the troops being on the march to nearby Hermansverk. The attack killed a travelling salesman from Bergen outright, and wounded a 16-year-old local boy and the boy's mother, restaurateur Isak Roksvåg from Kommandøren and the ship's captain, Thorvald Johannessen. While on the way to hospital in Lærdal with Kommandøren, Captain Johannessen died from his wounds.Svartefoss 1994, pp. 48–50 =End of the campaign= For the remaining week of the fighting in South Norway, Kommandøren was docked at Kvamsøya, immobilized by a damaged axle. As part of the ceasefire agreement accepted by the Norwegians in Western Norway in the evening of 1 May 1940, Kommandøren was to be handed over to the Germans, along with the ferry Lærdal and 40 smaller boats. The transfer of the ships occurred at Lærdal on 2 May, and the ceasefire was announced on 3 May. The Germans used Kommandøren and the other vessels for a limited period to transport troops to occupy various places in Western Norway.Svartefoss 1994, pp. 51–54 When released by the Germans, Kommandøren was repaired before re-entering service. During the German occupation By the autumn of 1940, Kommandøren was back in regular service, providing an important link between Bergen and the smaller town and villages in the region. By 1944, Kommandøren had been assigned the code letters LEGO. She remained in service until 8 February 1945, when she ran aground in the Alverstraumen narrows. Kommandøren remained aground for five weeks, and was filled by sea water before being salvaged and towed to Bergen to await repairs. Although the ship's hull was intact, the interior and engine were heavily water damaged.Torvanger 2000, p. 63 Sinking During the night of 29 March 1945, Kommandøren was docked at the remains of Søndre Nykirkekai in Bergen. At around 01:00 the ship was struck by one of two torpedoes accidentally fired by a German torpedo boat anchored on the opposite side of Vågen bay.Voksø 1994, p. 511 The torpedo explosion threw debris from Kommandøren over a wide area, and left the ship lying on the harbour bed. Only the mast and a section of the bow remained above water. The midship and aft sections of the ship were completely destroyed by the torpedo. The only crew member on board at the time, Able Seaman Alf Larsen, was killed in the incident. Before discovering that the incident had been caused by the accidental launch of two torpedoes by a drunken German crewman on the E-boat S-13, the German authorities in Bergen launched a search for saboteurs in the city. Kommandøren was the only total loss suffered by Fylkesbaatane i Sogn og Fjordane (the formerly named Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe) during the Second World War. The wreck of Kommandøren was raised in April 1946 and towed to Kjøkkelvik in Askøy. Kommandøren was sold for scrap in November 1946.

The train was named after the Karwendel mountain range forming the German-Austrian border south of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, which it passes on the Mittenwald Railway (Karwendelbahn). Introduced in 1930, it is currently labelled as an Intercity-Express train connection operated by Deutsche Bahn AG. History Pre-war Karwendel-Express car, on display at the Bavarian Railway Museum, Nördlingen Since the opening of the Mittenwald Railway line in 1912, train service was provided to reach the tourist resorts in the Karwendel range such as Mittenwald and Seefeld in Tirol. First D-Zug express trains ran from 1925 onwards on the electrified Munich–Garmisch-Partenkirchen railway. In 1930 the Deutsche Reichsbahn introduced the Karwendel-Express, linking Munich with Innsbruck via the scenic Karwendelbahn route through the mountains with the border crossing at Mittenwald. Special passenger cars were built, calling at the 1936 Winter Olympics venues in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The operation ceased in World War II. After the war, D-Zug service continued from Munich to Seefeld and Innsbruck. In 1969 the Deutsche Bundesbahn reintroduced the Ft Karwendel train using VT 11.5 TEE diesel multiple units.Reisen 1.Klasse page 93 The Saturday only train was classified as package tour touristtrain serving several wintersport resorts along the Karwendelbahn between Garmisch and Seefeld. The service started in Frankfurt am Main, much farther north then the pre-war start at Munich.Timetables of FDt Karwendel 1969 and 1970 at www.welt- der-modelleisenbahn.com From the introduction of the Intercity system in 1971 the train was named ICt Karwendel.Timetables of IC Karwendel from 1971 to 1984 at www.welt-der-modelleisenbahn.com DB Class 111 with IC Karwendel in Garmisch-Partenkirchen (1983) In May 1979 a daily Intercity service from Bremen to Innsbruck named IC Karwendel has been introduced, hauled by DB Class 103 and 111 electric locomotives. On 31 May 1987 it was one of the initial EuroCity services.Deutsche Bahn, timetable Ihr Zugbegleiter 1987, shown at www.grahnert.de The EuroCity started as far north as Hamburg but its initial southern terminus Innsbruck was already changed to Seefeld by September 1987 and after only one year as EuroCity the train was reconverted into an Intercity. Since 2008 the Karwendel has been an ICE service using ICE T (DB Class 411) high-speed electric multiple units, with Berlin the northern terminus and serving the region south of Munich only at weekends.Current DB- timetable, kursbuch.bahn.de, table (Kursbuchstreckennummer) 960 In July 2017, the Murnau Mayor Rolf Beuting was informed that the railway is planning the hiring of the ICE train pair Munich-Innsbruck. Only two train pairs from the Ruhr area and Hamburg-Berlin to Garmisch-Partenkirchen are to remain. The Karwendel would then lose its long-distance train in Mittenwald and Seefeld. The Deutsche Bahn states as justification that the train is uneconomical because of decreasing numbers of passengers. In addition, he did not fit into the vehicle revolutions after the opening of the Erfurt-Nuremberg High Speed Railway. The passengers from the north benefited from the 1/2 hours shorter travel time. The mayors of the Bavarian and Tyrolean neighboring communities protest against the decision. They fear that holiday guests, for whom a connection without change is important, will avoid the Karwendel area in the future. According to the mayor, around 25 to 25% of guests currently travel to Mittenwald by train. The service is restored in December 2018.

Accessible from California State Route 62, the restaurant lies four miles northeast of Yucca Valley. In 1946, a group of filmmakers built a Western- style movie set in the high desert 25 miles north of Palm Springs for the cowboy actors Roy Rogers and Gene Autry. Production designers decorated the facades of \\"Main Street\\" with a Western saloon, bank, chapel and a cantina. Pioneertown and its cantina were used in more than 50 films and television programs throughout the 1940s and 1950s, including The Cisco Kid and Judge Roy Bean. In 1972, John Aleba and his wife Francis purchased the building and John further developed the property into a cantina. The Cantina, 1946-1982 In 1946, at the site where Pappy & Harriet's stands today, filmmakers built a cantina set that was used in numerous Westerns during the 1950s. In 1972, Harriet's mother, Francis Aleba, purchased the building and opened The Cantina, an outlaw biker burrito bar. The Cantina rollicked for 10 years before its closing. Pappy & Harriet's, 1982 onward In 1982, Aleba's daughter Harriet and her husband, Claude \\"Pappy\\" Allen, bought The Cantina and renamed it Pappy & Harriet's Pioneertown Palace. With its family style Tex-Mex cuisine and live music, The Cantina often featured Pappy, Harriet, and their granddaughter Kristina, and became a local haunt for bikers as well as people from all walks of life. When Pappy Allen died in 1994, hundreds of mourners from around the world attended his memorial, including Victoria Williams, who later recorded the song \\"Happy to Have Known Pappy\\" for her Atlantic Records release, Loose. A local airplane pilot, Jay Hauk, owned Pappy and Harriet's for a short stint before it was bought by its present owners, New Yorkers Robyn Celia and Linda Krantz. In the summer of 2006, the Sawtooth Complex fire threatened Pappy & Harriet's and the rest of Pioneertown, but the town and club were not among the 50 homes and over 60,000 acres of desert burned.http://www.fire.ca.gov/communications/downloads/communique/2007_winter/PhotoEssay.pdf Notable performers Billboard Magazine named Pappy & Harriet's one of the Top Ten Hidden Gems in the Country in its 2012 Best Clubs issue. The club attracts artists and musicians from all over the world. NY Times Magazine featured Pappy and Harriet's in its 2013 article \\"Listen Up  In The California Desert, A One Of A Kind Music Venue Blossoms.\\" SXSW featured the documentary The Pioneertown Palace in 2014. Anthony Bourdain featured Pappy & Harriet's in the \\"US Desert\\" episode of his television show Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations. Performers who have appeared at Pappy & Harriet's over the years include Paul McCartney, Eric Burdon, Eagles of Death Metal, Queens of the Stone Age, Rufus Wainwright, The Donnas, Grizzly Bear, Neko Case, Spiritualized, Lucinda Williams, Leon Russell, Arctic Monkeys, Daniel Lanois, Band of Horses, Alvvays, Sean Lennon, Billy Corgan and the Spirits in the Sky, Vampire Weekend, Wanda Jackson, Ricki Lee Jones, Lorde, and so many more. A surprise appearance by Robert Plant in early 2006 led to a jam with the Sunday evening house band, The Thrift Store All Stars, which featured Victoria Williams. Coachella Festival promoters Goldenvoice Productions and Santa Monica-based NPR station KCRW have presented shows at Pappy & Harriet's, although the majority of booking is generated by the club's co-owner, Robyn Celia. A Monday night Open Mic hosted by musician Ted Quinn features hundreds of performers. Most of the Open Mic performers are local or lesser-known traveling troubadours, but many established artists, including Feist, Julie Christensen, and Ke$ha have also made appearances for this low-key event. Cracker and Camper Van Beethoven hold a successful annual outdoor festival, The Camp-Out, at Pappy & Harriet's each year. Gram Rabbit has an annual Halloween party and plays the part of The Grim Rabbit. Americana singer- songwriter, Jim Lauderdale, performs at Pappy & Harriet's every spring in a show known as \\"Jim-fest.\\" Babes in Toyland had their first reunion show here on February 10, 2015.

The star is not particularly noteworthy with exception to its enormously high heavy element content. Properties The position of HD 108063 on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. 20px HD 108063 is a somewhat bright star that lies in an area of the southern sky towards the middle of Centaurus. It has not been studied particularly extensively, but was identified as modestly high proper motion star during the previous century. With a Hipparcos parallax of 18.5 mas, it lies at a distance of 54 parsecs, so the star is fairly nearby. The relative brightness of the star at its distance means that it is substantially over-luminous compared to a dwarf star, and as of such it has been previously classified as a G5III or G4IV star. On the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (left), the star lies on the subgiant branch, confirming that it is over-luminous. The star's B-V colour indicates a spectral type of F9.5, while the spectroscopic effective temperature indicates a spectral type closer to F9. Determination of the metallicity of HD 108063 has only been made more recently, with the first value made photometrically in 2004. Their Fe/H of 0.66 dex is slightly higher than the spectroscopic value of Fe/H = 0.55 ± 0.06 dex, which corresponds to a metallicity of 3.54 times the solar value. This is one of the highest metallicities for any known star, and is identical to 1σ to the Fe/H of HD 126614 (0.56 ± 0.04 dex) and HD 177830 (0.55 ± 0.03 dex). The position of HD 108063 (red) on plots of (top) B-V - absolute magnitude, and (bottom) mass - absolute magnitude for main sequence stars using data from The enormous metallicity of HD 108063 has strong effect on its apparent parameters. A metal-rich star has a cooler surface temperature than a lower-metallicity star, with the strength of the effect increasing with a higher metallicity. On a plot of B-V (which is an indicator of temperature) to absolute magnitude for main sequence stars (left), HD 108063 has the absolute magnitude of an F0V star but the B-V of an F9-G0V (F9.5V) star, again showing that the star is significantly above the main sequence. However, on a plot of stellar mass to absolute magnitude (left), HD 108063 has parameters consistent with an F0V star. This indicates that the over-luminosity is actually an overly low temperature caused by the star's metallicity and that the apparent subgiant luminosity is artificial. HD 108063 is therefore likely to be on the main sequence.

It provided a retail store-based reusable battery exchange service to consumers. BETTERY kiosks or \\"Swap Stations\\" allow consumers to buy ready to use reusable AA or AAA batteries that can be used just like any other single use battery. Once drained, the batteries can be swapped for a fully tested and charged replacement. The company previously had placed five kiosks at Whole Foods Market locations in the Pacific Northwest and placed five additional kiosks at Whole Foods and Safeway stores in Seattle and Portland. The BETTERY brand was sold in 2014 to Green Box Batteries, LLC, a Tacoma, WA privately held company. Green Box Batteries, LLC has re-launched the BETTERY brand with a focus on bringing batteries to the world of subscription services much like Netflix did for DVD rentals.  Environmental Impact  Batteries account for >1% of waste poundage, but 88% of mercury, 52% of cadmium, and in total they account for 50-70% of all heavy metal contaminants in landfills including Zinc, Manganese, Lead, Nickel, Cobalt, Cadmium, Arsenic, and Mercury depending on the battery chemistry mix in a given landfill location. By using a reusable battery swap service, battery use has up to 30 times less impact on air pollutants (such as Carbon, Nitrogen, and Methane gases) than disposable batteries. That is equivalent to driving a car 1,243 miles less each year per consumer. By making it easier for consumers to use reusable battery technology, The BETTERY brand reduces the volume of batteries that are thrown away in the U.S. every year. Approximately 90 percent of portable batteries manufactured in the US are alkaline dry cells with a global annual production exceeding 10 billion units. Today, the majority of these batteries end up in landfills. Each BETTERY reusable battery can be swapped and reused up to a thousand times before it is recycled back into the manufacturing stream. Consumers can use the BETTERY kiosk to drop off traditional single-use batteries, where they will be recycled. The contents of recycled batteries can be salvaged to make metal and other raw materials.  History  Founded in 2011 with the mission to reduce waste by utilizing the latest advancements in reusable battery technology, BETTERY belongs to the movement of companies with sustainability at its core. With a veteran team of executives and advisers from major battery, kiosk and high tech companies, BETTERY is poised to reinvent the portable power industry.

This poster was issued by various branches of the United States Military to educate and prevent domestic abuse. The management of domestic violence deals with the treatment of victims of domestic violence and preventing repetitions of such violence. The response to domestic violence in Western countries is typically a combined effort between law enforcement, social services, and health care. The role of each has evolved as domestic violence has been brought more into public view. Historically, domestic violence has been viewed as a private family matter that need not involve the government or criminal justice. Police officers were often reluctant to intervene by making an arrest, and often chose instead to simply counsel the couple and/or ask one of the parties to leave the residence for a period of time. The courts were reluctant to impose any significant sanctions on those convicted of domestic violence, largely because it was viewed as a misdemeanor offense. The modern view in industrialized countries is that domestic violence should be viewed as a public matter and all criminal authority should be involved; that once the violence is reported it should be taken seriously. Further, supports need to be put in place to restore the victim's safety and respect, which often includes the efforts of the person who did the harm. Medical response Medical professionals can make a difference in the lives of those who experience abuse. Many cases of spousal abuse are handled solely by physicians and do not involve the police. Sometimes cases of domestic violence are brought into the emergency room, while many other cases are handled by a family physician or other primary care provider. Subspecialist physicians are also increasingly playing an important role. For example, HIV physicians are ideally suited to play an important role in managing abuse given the association between abuse and HIV infection as well as their often lifelong relationships with patients. Medical professionals are in a position to give advice, and refer them to appropriate services. The health care professional has not always met this role, with uneven quality of care, and in some cases misunderstandings about domestic violence. Carole Washaw suggests that many doctors prefer not to get involved in people's \\"private\\" lives. Jenny Clifton, John Jacobs, Jo Tulloch found that training for general practitioners in the United States about domestic violence was very limited or they had no training. Abbott and Williamson found that knowledge and understanding of domestic violence was very limited among health care professionals in a Midlands, United Kingdom county, and that they do not see themselves as being able to play a major role in helping women in regards to domestic violence. Furthermore, in the biomedical model of health care, injuries are often just treated and diagnosed, without regard for the causes. As well, there is substantial reluctance for victims to come forward and broach the issue with their physicians. On average, women experience 35 incidents of domestic violence before seeking treatment. In the U. S., the Institute of Medicine recognized the shortcomings of the health care system in its 2002 report entitled Confronting Chronic Neglect and attributed some of the problems cited to a lack of adequate training among health professionals. Health professionals have an ethical responsibility to recognize and address exposure to abuse in their patients, in the health care setting. For example, the American Medical Association's code of medical ethics states that \\"Due to the prevalence and medical consequences of family violence, physicians should routinely inquire about physical, sexual, and psychological abuse as part of the medical history. Physicians must also consider abuse in the differential diagnosis for a number of medical complaints, particularly when treating women.\\" Law enforcement Afghan National Police instructors conduct a role playing scenario dealing with sexual abuse at the Afghan National Police Academy, Kabul, Afghanistan on December 30, 2010. Dr. Anna Baldry taught the Train the Trainer Gender Seminar to give ANP instructors more comprehensive and effective delivery methods for the current curriculum on domestic violence and sexual abuse. (U.S. Navy photo by Chief Petty Officer Brian Brannon/Released) In the 1970s, studies in Europe and North America showed that domestic violence was widespread in many homes, resulting in emotional and physical trauma, and sometimes death. Into the 21st century many countries have taken steps to eradicate domestic violence, such as criminalization of violence against women and other abuses. Organizations have been formed which provide assistance and protection of domestic abuse victims, laws and criminal remedies, and domestic violence courts. In addition, social, legal, psychological, and medical services have been made available for victims of domestic violence.Handbook on effective police responses to violence against women. Criminal Justice Handbook Series. World Health Organization. 2010. p. 12. Although acts of domestic violence are criminal and a violation of human rights, safety and dignity, as of 2010 the United Nation has found that it is still often considered a private matter. Some countries with laws against domestic violence may not enforce them and there are many countries that do not criminalize domestic violence. The United Nations published Handbook on Effective Responses to Violence against Women for police and other first responders to provide guidelines for police intervention.Handbook on effective police responses to violence against women. Criminal Justice Handbook Series. World Health Organization. 2010. p. 7. Where there are laws against domestic violence, such abuse is often under-reported.

A true man does not beat his partner.\\" Of the cases that are reported, they are often under-prosecuted. Criminologists suggest that abusers who are employed and have ties to the community may initially fear punishment, though many cases do not make it all the way through the criminal justice process. If the victim is uncooperative during investigation, the prosecutor may choose not to pursue the case. If the case is pursued through the criminal justice system, sometimes the resulting sentence is minor. Subsequently, any fear that the abuser has of punishment may have diminished. According to the United Nations'Handbook on effective police responses to violence against women: \\"Without clearly targeted efforts to alter institutional culture and practices and to mainstream the issue of gender in legislation and practice, most legal and political reforms have little positive impact.\\" An effective system requires \\"cooperative, coordinated and effective involvement\\" of law enforcement, communities, non- governmental organizations (NGOs), courts, and prisons.Handbook on effective police responses to violence against women.

Counseling Counseling for victim Due to the extent and prevalence of violence in relationships, counselors and therapists are encouraged to assess every client for domestic violence (both experienced and perpetrated). If the clinician is seeing a couple for couple's counseling, this assessment should be conducted with each individual privately during the initial interview, in order to increase the victim's sense of safety in disclosing any violence in the relationship. In addition to determining whether violence is present, counselors and therapists should also make the distinction between situations where battering may have been a single, isolated incident or an ongoing pattern of control. The therapist must, however, consider that violence may be present even when there has been only a single physical incident as emotional/verbal, economic, and sexual abuse may be more insidious. Another important issue in assessing clients for domestic violence lies in differing definitions of abuse – the therapist's definition may differ from that of the client, and paying close attention to the way the client describes their experiences is crucial in developing effective treatment plans. The therapist must determine if it is in the best interest of the client to explain that some behaviors (such as emotional abuse) are considered domestic violence, even if the client did not previously consider them as such. If it becomes apparent to the therapist that domestic violence is taking place in a client's relationship, there are several statements the clinician can make that have been shown to be effective in rapport-building and immediate crisis intervention with clients. Firstly, it is essential that the therapist believe the victim's story and validate their feelings. It is recommended that the therapist acknowledge them for taking a risk in disclosing this information, and assure them that any ambivalent feelings they may be having are normal. The therapist should emphasize that the abuse they have experienced is not their fault, but should keep their feelings of ambivalence in mind and refrain from blaming their partner or telling them what to do. It is unreasonable for the therapist to expect that a victim will leave their perpetrator solely because they disclosed the abuse, and the therapist should respect the victim's autonomy and allow them to make their own decisions regarding termination of the relationship. Finally, the therapist must explore options with the client (such as emergency housing in shelters, police involvement, etc.) in order to uphold their obligation to protect the welfare of the client. =Lethality assessment= A lethality assessment is a tool that can assist in determining the best course of treatment for a client, as well as helping the client to recognize dangerous behaviors and more subtle abuse in their relationship. In a study of victims of attempted domestic violence-related homicide, only about one-half of the participants recognized that their perpetrator was capable of killing them, as many domestic violence victims minimize the true seriousness of their situation. Thus, lethality assessment is an essential first step in assessing the severity of a victim's situation. =Safety planning= Safety planning allows the victim to plan for dangerous situations they may encounter, and is effective regardless of their decision on whether remain with their perpetrator. Safety planning usually begins with determining a course of action if another acute incident occurs in the home. The victim should be given strategies for their own safety, such as avoiding confrontations in rooms where there is only one exit and avoiding certain rooms that contain many potential weapons (such as kitchens, bathrooms, etc.). Counseling for offenders The main goal for counselling for offenders of domestic violence is to have them stop the violence and repair the harms they have created.Augusta-Scott, T., (2017). Preparing Men to Help the Women They Abused Achieve Just Outcomes: A Restorative Approach. In T. Augusta-Scott, K. Scott, & L. Tutty (Eds.). Innovations in Interventions to Address Intimate Partner Violence: Research and Practice. New York: Routledge Press; Augusta-Scott, T. (2009). A Narrative Therapy approach to conversations with men about perpetrating abuse In Peter Lehmann and Catherine Simmons (eds). Strengths Based Batterers Intervention: A New Paradigm in Ending Family Violence. New York: Springer Press. Such work needs to restore the victims' safety and respect, not necessarily restoring the intimate relationship. Counselling for offenders emphasizes minimizing risk to the victim, and should be modified depending on the offender's history, risk of reoffending, and criminogenic needs. The majority of offender treatment programs are 24–36 weeks in length and are conducted in a group setting with groups not exceeding 12 participants. Gender specific groups (male offenders only or female offenders only) are common in the field. Groups can be helpful to establish group norms that are contrary to the use of violence that, in turn, create a context where offenders are held accountable to their own values in a respectful manner. Successful completion of groups is generally associated with old age, higher levels of education, lower reported drug use, non-violent criminal histories, and longer intimate relationships.Pollard, Carrie (2004). Examining predictors of level of attendance in a group treatment program for men who abuse (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University Along with offering group conversations, others incorporate individual and conjoint conversations to assist in ending the violence and repairing the harms. One such approach, which focuses on restorative justice, is highlighted in the critically acclaimed documentary A Better Man. Maclean's reported, “The film manages to be simultaneously agonizing and hopeful… it is revelatory to know these kinds of [restorative] conversations are possible.”MacLean's Film reviewer Miria Bale of Vulture.com heralds the film is a \\"Revolutionary documentary.\\"Vulture Anger management alone has not been shown to be effective in treating domestic violence offenders because such an approach seldom addresses the societal influences that are influencing offenders choices to perpetrate violence. Anger management is recommended as a part of an offender program that is based on accountability, along with topics such as recognizing abusive patterns of behavior and re-framing communication skills. Interventions require not only stopping the violence but developing a plan to repair harms.Bidgood, Bruce Alan (1999). The social construction of a nonabuser image: A study of a post- treatment male abuser self-help group (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University Any corresponding problems should also be addressed as part of domestic violence offender treatment, such as problems with substance abuse or other mental illness.  Occupational therapy  Victims of domestic violence may require occupational therapy to be able to participate in work and to address a diminished skill-set caused by a prolonged absence from the workforce. Occupational therapists work with individuals to develop the skills needed to acquire desired roles and satisfactorily perform everyday tasks. Occupational therapists can provide services through direct or indirect treatment, advocacy efforts, consultation, or group sessions. They may work with victims of domestic violence and their families in a variety of settings such as hospitals, inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation centers, long-term care facilities, mental health facilities, schools, homes, and in shelters or other community programs. Within any of the practice settings, occupational therapists may encounter victims of domestic violence including individuals who have not reported abuse. Occupational therapists are in a position to uncover information that leads to suspicion of violence or identification of abuse that has occurred. As health care professionals, occupational therapists follow state mandated requirements to report abuse. In treatment sessions, they may encounter individuals who have either chosen to remain in or must move on from an intimate relationship where abuse has occurred. Occupational therapists may see patients for complications directly related to abuse, such as physical injuries. On the other hand, occupational therapy services may be requested for unrelated issues but consequences of violence are addressed after the patient reveals abuse to the therapist. The consequences of domestic violence may impact the ability to perform daily occupations. Occupational therapy contributes to recovery by enabling victims to create new roles, develop satisfying and productive routines, and gain the self-efficacy necessary to overcome the effects of domestic violence. Occupational therapy interventions may include: * decision-making skills regarding employment opportunities * assertiveness skills training * stress management, calming techniques, and coping strategies * time and money management * home management * community mobility * parenting skill-building * communication and interpersonal skills * self-esteem and self-efficacy * social participation * lifestyle modification to establish healthy routines for self-care and sleep. OT interventions with children who are exposed to domestic violence are focused on promoting age appropriate academic, play, and social skills to facilitate proper development and success in school activities. This may include activities to improve organization, study habits, or attention. Adolescents who have seen or experienced domestic abuse may also benefit from occupational therapy to work on relationship and life skills and learn coping strategies. Prevention and intervention education sample There are many community organizations which work to prevent domestic violence by offering safe shelter, crisis intervention, advocacy, and education and prevention programs. From a 2019 Cochrance review on advocacy interventions (either stand-alone or as a part of other services provided by social services agencies or law enforcement) involves education, safety planning and access to needed services and should be reflective of the individualized needs of the person. Community screening for domestic violence can be more systematic in cases of animal abuse, healthcare settings, emergency departments, behavioral health settings and court systems. Tools are being developed to facilitate domestic violence screening such as mobile apps.app to help physicians screen for domestic abuse. Mobihealthnews.com (2011-10-20).

Duluth model In 1981, the Duluth Domestic Abuse Intervention Project became the first multi-disciplinary program designed to address the issue of domestic violence. This experiment, conducted in Duluth, Minnesota, frequently referred to as the \\"Duluth Project\\" because it is constantly evolving through the help of an entire community. The Domestic Abuse Intervention Program has federal, state and local funders who support them. This funding allows DAIP to explore strategies to end violence to communities throughout the United States and around the world. The objectives of the Duluth approach: * Remove the blame from the victim and make the offender accountable for the abuse. * Create criminal and civil justice systems to hold offenders accountable and keep the victims safe. * Use the experiences and voices from battered women to improve and create policies. * Offer court-ordered educational groups for the offenders. * Review current cases and policies. A news report from California cites a batterer intervention by The Center for Violence-Free Relationships based on Nonviolent Communication as having demonstrated zero percent recidivism within 5 years, and contrasts this with 40 percent recidivism within 5 years said to have been reported by DAIP for graduates of programs based on the Duluth Model.  Community-based healing for domestic violence  In patriarchal societies, women struggle to make personal decisions over their own bodies or identities which makes them more vulnerable to domestic violence. It is paramount that women gain personal control over their body and a sense of self-efficacy in order to heal from domestic violence. However, women are less inclined to seek such help and healing because of societal norms (such as the expectation that femininity equates to domesticity) and gender disparity. In such contexts, scholars advocate for community-based healing. Where women live in tight-knit communities, such healing is a better option over individualized therapy (which is how trauma healing is approached in the West). Community-based healing focuses on providing psycho-social treatment for traumatized individuals, on building social cohesion among the community members, and on expanding access to healing resources.  Social concept of the body The first step for healing involves women understanding the physical and social dimensions of their bodies and how they are depicted and valued in their society and culture. There is a societal pressure for women to please the men of their society at the expense of their own body and mind. This leads to gender inequality as their body is not only theirs but is controlled by hegemonic patriarchal dominance, undermining women's ability to make their own decisions about their lives and their bodies. In many societies, it is progressive feminist movements that are educating women about their bodily functions (a topic considered taboo) and offering women new ways to view and relate to their own bodies. Ways for women to gain control over their body include the following: * Freely expressing their own identity, and behaving in ways that are shaped less by men. * Women looking up to strong female models, and gaining a sense of resiliency. * Gaining understanding about how to manage/take care of their bodily needs, and how to make informed choices. * Learning to feel comfortable seeking help when they need it; not feeling deviant for needing to talk about sex and sexuality.  Expansion of community-based healing resources Women who have experienced domestic violence are more likely to drink and use drugs as coping mechanism to distort their memories of abuse. Emotions such as abandonment, betrayal, and confusion push them to turn to substance abuse. By expanding services--job-seeking support, group talk therapy, drug use and alcoholism recovery support--a community can help an individual woman battle depression and suicidal thoughts caused by their trauma. Distribution of resources should be equitable for the community. Victims in a community will be empowered they perceive healing resources as expandable and renewable. In a context of resource scarcity, a woman's capacity to recover is impeded, exacerbating their mental, physical, and emotional health. Cooperation to share personal resources within the community will mitigate further damage as everyone tries to purposefully serve one another without trying to control the resources for personal gain. In some cases, a community can provide spiritual healing for the women with the goal of fostering their authority over their bodies. Victims of domestic abuse have the tendency to feel helpless and powerless due to the trauma that they experienced. As such participating in a spiritual healing group will help them focus on finding inner peace with their body. There is also a sense that these victims will acknowledge each other's suffering and see that their suffering is not an isolated incident that they need to keep to themselves; this small but empowering step will help women regain their confidence and independence. It is also through group participation that women gain new sources of support, while enhancing or restoring their ability to continue social and interpersonal connections with others.

Wiesel has experienced inequality first hand through the Holocaust and has been working in several different areas involving the Holocaust. The Foundation’s mission statement, created in remembrance of the Holocaust, is \\"to combat indifference, intolerance and injustice through international dialogue and youth-focused programs that promote acceptance, understanding and equality.\\" Wiesel has dedicated the foundation to bringing together people from all over the world to share ideas on political, cultural, religious, and academic boundaries. The foundation organizes contests, awards, and conferences for youths in both the United States and other countries experiencing cultural conflicts.  In the news  The foundation had approximately $15 million in investments managed by Bernard Madoff Investment Securities, which was lost when Madoff's company defrauded its investors of $50 billion in 2008. However, Wiesel would not let this setback prevent the foundation from holding to its mission. Wiesel has shared his experiences in the Holocaust in his memoir, Night, and his name can be seen in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C..  The Beit Tzipora Centers  The foundation opened up two \\"Beit Tzipora Centers\\" in Israel for Ethiopian Jews fleeing violence in Africa. The centers are named after Elie Wiesel's younger sister, who was killed at the Auschwitz concentration camp during WWII. The centers were founded in the mid-90s following the rescue of thousands of Ethiopian Jews from Africa, where they were facing persecution and violence. The refugees were transported by plane from Ethiopia to Israel beginning on May 25, 1991. The evacuation consisted of 18,000 Jews and took place over thirty-six hours. Israeli and American governments had been negotiating for over a year with the Ethiopian government to allow the Jews to leave Ethiopia. The previous policy was that no more than 1,300 Jews could leave every thirty days and was put in place by dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam. However, Mengistu Haile Mariam fled the country earlier in May after receiving pressure from armed rebels. Tesfaye Gebre-Kidan became the new leader and accepted a letter from President George Bush requesting that he allow the exodus of Jews from the country to Israel or the United States would not help him negotiate a truce with the advancing rebels. The idea for these centers came to the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity from seeing the growing need for safe and educational centers for the Ethiopian- Jewish refugees in Israel. Two Beit Tzipora Centers were founded in Israel, in Asheklon and Kiryat Malachi. The centers’ missions are to educate the community of Ethiopian-Jews in Israel and give the Ethiopian-Israeli young people the chance to be knowledgeable enough to participate fully in society. Together the two locations of the Beit Tzipora Centers provide more than 1,000 children with after-school programs. Formally inaugurated on July 25, 2007, the former Ashkelon center was made-over with new classrooms, technology and an auditorium. The Ashkelon center serves students in 1st through 6th grade, runs a summer program for the students, and also provides an adult education program for the surrounding community. Implemented in 2004, Ethiopian students who attend the Ashkelon center and choose to enroll at a higher institute of education are offered the opportunity to volunteer at the Beit Tzipora Ashkelon Center during the school year in exchange for a scholarship from the Elie Wiesel Foundation For Humanity that significantly helps with financing his or her college education. The Beitz Tzipora Center for Study and Enrichment at Kiryat Malachi has continued to grow over the past fifteen years. A new and expanded library was opened in 2002 to support the growing number of students. A new matriculation exam program became available to students through grade twelve in 2004. The Beitz Tzipora Center at Kiryat Malachi also provides programs for students 1st through 12th grade, offers a summer program for the students, and provides an adult education program for the surrounding community. Both Elie and Marion Wiesel are extremely involved with the centers and frequently make trips to provide encouragement to the children. Their work has not gone unnoticed. Israeli school and government officials have seen and commented on the positive, dramatic impact the Beit Tzipora study and enrichment programs have had on the Ethiopian-Jewish children.  Darfurian refugee program  In the fall of 2007 the foundation recognized a need in Israel for a similar center to the Beit Tzipora centers for refugees fleeing the genocide in Darfur. It instituted an after-school program at the Bialik-Rogozin School in Tel-Aviv for the Darfurian refugees, which provides them with English and Hebrew training, computer technology education, tutoring, arts and crafts, and most importantly counseling. Parents of the children are also given access to the language and counseling services. The center strives to not only provide the counseling and education the refugees desperately need but also to help the children of the genocide feel more comfortable with their new lives in Israel.  Prize in Ethics essay contest  The foundation established the award in 1989, as an essay contest for juniors and seniors in 4-year accredited colleges in the United States. The contest \\"challenges college students in the U.S. to submit essays on the urgent and complex ethical issues that confront us in the modern earth.\\" Each year a suggested topic is provided, but not a requirement. The judges are mainly interested in seeing a modern, ethical dilemma clearly articulated and a real personal voice in the essay, so it is evident how the dilemma affected the student. The essay should also be 3,000–4,000 words, well written, concise, and in English. The first-place winner receives $5,000, the second- place winner $2,500, the third-place winner $1,500, and two honorable mentions receive $500 each.  Foundation awards  The Humanitarian Award was created by to recognize people that fight injustice, intolerance and share the beliefs and goals of the foundation in their work. The award has been given out every year since the 1989 when France’s then first lady Danielle Mitterrand won the award.

Asda Smart Price Asda's Smart Price logo between 2004 and 2012 Asda Smart Price is a no-frills private label trade name. It can trace its origins to Asda's Farm Stores brand launched in the mid-1990s, which consisted of products that were offered at a lower price than the equivalent famous name brand product and Asda's own brand equivalent. The Farm Stores brand originally consisted of a small number of food only products, largely frozen such as frozen chips and a small range of ready meals, this range later expanded to include fresh food. Smart Price products are almost always the lowest price option (known as Our Lowest Price) in a product category in Asda stores. Occasionally this difference is only a few pence, however in others it is a marked difference. For example, a box of Smart Price Biological Washing Powder costs £1.00 while the equivalent Asda brand washing powder costs £2.00 and well known name brand alternatives normally cost from £2.50 upwards. A bottle of Asda Smartprice washing up liquid. The Asda logo is reminiscent of the one used by the supermarket in the early 1980s. The Smart Price label was originally a food only brand, however over the years it has expanded to cover almost every product range in the store, including clothing and furnishings with the George Smart Price brand. Like early generic products in the US some Smart Price products lack what can be thought of as 'frills' in the modern brand name or supermarket own brand, for example the Smart Price toothpaste has an old fashioned screw cap rather than the now more common flip cap and the Smart Price range of crisps come in traditional clear plastic bags rather than the foil bags common to most name brand versions. Asda's Smart Price logo and packaging has changed several times since its introduction. It was revisedAsda to relaunch SmartPrice with Elmwood  The Drum in 2012 to match the branding of Walmart's Great Value line at the timeSleek new look for Wal-Mart’s Great Value, but a further redesign in 2014 removed the similarity in visual style. Sainsbury's Tertiary Brands The own label Sainsbury's Basics range is its low cost products An economy range of around 550 lines, mainly food but also including other areas such as toiletries and stationery. The Basics range uses minimal packaging with simple orange and white designs. Sainsbury's Local stores sell none or very few of these lines. Sainsbury's seeks to differentiate itself on its own label items on quality and many of the Basics products now cost more than what may be considered the equivalent products at Asda, Tesco and Morrisons. This can range from price differences of 1p for Basics Sultanas to Basics Spaghetti tin, where Sainsbury's price is nearly twice that of Asda Smart Price (the weight of the Sainsbury's product is very slightly more and of better quality). Sainsbury's first lower tier range was called Sainsbury's Economy, which was launched in the 1990s to rival Tesco Value; it was later renamed Sainsbury's Low Price, then Sainsbury's Basics. When Basics was first rolled out, the name of the product and slogan was in a handwritten orange typeface with a simple outline hand drawing of the product. They later used a thin sans serif typeface for the product name, while retaining the handwritten typeface for the slogan. The hand drawn graphic was removed in favour of a coloured simple graphic with considerably more detail. As of September 2019, Sainsbury's has begun phasing out the Basics brand in favour of using tertiary brands similar to Tesco Sainsbury’s drops Basics as part of new five-year plan/. *Stamford Street Food Company - chilled and frozen ready meals, chilled pizza and garlic bread, named after the supermarket's former Head Office location in London; *Hubbard's Foodstore - store cupboard staples such as tea bags, jam, tinned foods, condiments and soft drinks, the name possibly being a reference to Old Mother Hubbard's cupboard; *Daily's - bread and morning goods; *House 247 - tissue paper products, refuse sacks, cleaning products; *Mary Ann's Dairy - cheese and yoghurts, named after Mary Ann Sainsbury; *Lovett's Family Favourites - chocolate, cakes, desserts and biscuits; *Just Snax - crisps, snacks and salted nuts; *The Greengrocer - fresh, frozen and dried fruit and vegetables; *J James & Family - fresh and frozen meat products, named after John James Sainsbury; A box of House247 Facial Tissues, sold in Sainsbury's Morrisons M Savers An economy brand which sells items ranging from food and drink to toiletries, currently the UK's fastest growing grocery brand.

Premium These value brands are not value brands as such but are competing with the big five's own-label products, i.e. Asda's \\"Chosen by You\\" or Sainsbury's \\"by Sainsbury's\\". Essential Waitrose Departing from earlier practice, the chain rebranded their entry level range of products as \\"essential Waitrose\\". The marketing of essential Waitrose centres around the tagline \\"quality you'd expect at prices you wouldn't\\". 1,600 new and existing products have been rebranded with this name using simple white-based packaging. Simply M&S; In 2012, Marks and Spencer issued their value brand, Simply M&S;, in response to Waitrose's Essential range. Budget Nowadays, even the budget retailers have value brands. Everyday Essentials Everyday Essentials is a value brand by Aldi. It was going to be rolled out in June 2012, however it was put on hold after a source close to Aldi said that it looked dated against Tesco's Everyday Value brand, which at the time was being overhauled. Simply Simply is a brand used by Lidl in an attempt to compete with Aldi's Everyday Essentials. It is currently under development. Convenience stores Many of the main convenience stores have an in-house value brand. Heritage Value Heritage Value is the value brand of Nisa. As a convenience store, prices tend to be considerably higher; a 29p pack of penne pasta in Lidl will cost you £1.09 in Nisa. Daily Basics Daily Basics is a brand owned by the Irish retail group Musgrave Group, and is an in-house brand which is sold by SuperValu. As a convenience store, prices tend to be high, with a litre of orange juice costing 89p. S Budget S Budget is SPAR's value brand. It is an international value brand, and thus includes some products that in the UK are considered very unusual in a value brand such as polony chubb (slicing sausage). Wholesalers It is not uncommon for wholesalers to have their own value brand to help independents compete on price. Euroshopper Euro Shopper logo Booker owns value brand Happy Shopper but also sells Euroshopper products, which are produced by AMS Sourcing B.V.. They are also sold in their symbol group stores Premier Stores, Londis and Budgens. Best One Essentials Best-In Essentials, known previously as Best-In Economy is the value brand of Bestway. Best In have recently overhauled their entire range. The Best In range was relaunched as Best One, with the value brand being relabelled Best One Essentials. As these items were sold in franchised Best One stores, it was argued that consumers would expect to carry the same label as the store. Lifestyle Value In 2018, following a merger between the Todays Group with its principal competitor, Landmark Wholesale, the Todays label was rescinded. The newly formed company was named Unitas Wholesale and elected to keep the popular Lifestyle brand, with its economy range of Lifestyle Value.

She is South Shields's first female MP. Early life From a family of shipyard workers, Lewell-Buck was born in South Shields. She is a direct descendant of William Wouldhave, the inventor of the lifeboat. Lewell-Buck attended St Joseph's Catholic Academy in Hebburn. She studied politics and media studies at Northumbria University, before gaining a master's degree in social work from Durham University. As a social worker, she specialised in child protection, and later represented the Primrose ward in Jarrow as a South Tyneside councillor from 2004 to 2013.Party rivals to fight for Primrose seat at shieldsgazette.com, accessed 17 January 2019 Parliamentary career Lewell-Buck won the safe Labour seat of South Shields with a reduced majority at a 2013 by-election following David Miliband's decision to leave the House of Commons. In June 2013, she became a member of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee replacing Thomas Docherty. In October 2013, she was appointed Private Parliamentary Secretary to Ivan Lewis, Labour's Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary. In 2014, she claimed that some people were \\"having to bury their relatives in their back gardens\\" as she proposed a Funeral Services Bill intended to require funeral providers to offer a low-cost option. In July 2015, she was elected as a member of the Work and Pensions Select Committee. In January 2016, Lewell-Buck became shadow minister for devolution and local government in Jeremy Corbyn's frontbench reshuffle. On 29 June 2016, she announced her resignation from the post, commenting that she was \\"heartbroken at the state of the [Labour] Party\\". This was a reference to a string of shadow cabinet resignations during the summer leadership crisis. She later supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party leadership election. In October 2016, she was re-appointed to Jeremy Corbyn's front bench team as Shadow Education Minister responsible for children and families' policy. She resigned from this position in March 2019 after voting against a second Brexit referendum in defiance of the Labour whip. In October 2019, local party members voted to trigger a reselection contest. She vowed to fight the contest and branded those who voted against her as \\"bullies and tricksters\\". She was then successfully re-elected as MP for South Shields in the 2019 general election.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000944 Political positions Lewell-Buck joined the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hunger and Food Poverty chaired by Frank Field and the Bishop of Truro. The group launched an inquiry into the root causes behind hunger, food poverty and the rise in demand of food banks across the UK, and published its final report in the House of Commons on 8 December 2014. After the report Lewell-Buck said in Parliament \\"Food poverty is a clear consequence of the Government's ideological assault on the social safety net and the people who rely on it. One hungry person is a complete disgrace, but thousands of hungry people are a national disaster.\\" In November 2017 Lewell-Buck introduced a Private Members' Bill (under the Ten Minute Rule), the Food Insecurity Bill, \\"to require the Government to monitor and report on food insecurity and to make provision for official statistics on food insecurity.\\" The bill was passed for second reading to be heard 2 February 2018. During Lewell-Buck's election campaign of 2013, she said helping to bring jobs to the unemployed of South Shields was a priority. In November 2013 she organised a jobs fair in her constituency, which was repeated in November 2014 after she pledged to make it into an annual event. Lewell-Buck is concerned about the large number of children in care; there were 75,420 children in care in England in March 2018, a rise of 4% from the year before. She said the rise was due to government cuts to support services like Sure Start, which could help children stay with their families. Lewell-Buck said, “The government is missing valuable opportunities to keep children in the care of their families. Not only does that add pressure to budgets already decimated by austerity, it also leaves children and their families with deep and enduring emotional scars.”Labour blames cuts as number of children in care rises again The Guardian Employment of husband Lewell-Buck employed her husband, Simon, as a researcher in 2015 after he had been suspended from his job as a carer and lost his place on a nursing course in response to allegations of swearing at and neglect of vulnerable adults in his care. The allegations were upheld. However, a watchdog investigation found the local authority had made procedural errors and were asked to pay £400 in compensation to Mr Buck. An independent social worker also reviewed the evidence and found that no abuse had taken place. Several senior members of her Constituency Labour Party members wrote to party leader Jeremy Corbyn to request her suspension owing to their concerns over his playing this role. Mr Buck was subsequently suspended from the Labour Party, pending investigation.  Personal life  Lewell-Buck was diagnosed with dyspraxia at the age of 27.

Founded in the United States, CCL has groups in Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Burundi, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Côte d'Ivoire, France, Gambia, Germany, Ghana, Iceland, India, Italy, Kenya, Mexico, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Serbia, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania, the Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.  Introduction  The Citizens' Climate Lobby is a non-partisan organization with members throughout the United States, Canada and other countries, which advocates for effective climate legislation. Its key purposes are listed as creating a political will for a sustainable climate, while empowering individuals to exercise their personal and political power. With the international/US headquarters in Coronado, California, and a Canadian national office in Sudbury, Ontario, Citizens' Climate Lobby is composed of local volunteer groups who lobby their elected representatives and work through local outreach and media. Their goal is to cut greenhouse gas emissions and promote a transition to a renewable energy economy through a market-based approach: a revenue neutral 'carbon fee and dividend' approach to pricing carbon pollution from fossil fuels, and simultaneously ending subsidies to fossil fuel companies. In the United States, using a market-based approach by putting a price on carbon is gaining support from both Republicans and Democrats. CCL believes that a revenue neutral carbon fee and dividend is a bipartisan solution that would effectively address carbon emissions, while not relying on a complex regulation approach.  History  The Citizens' Climate lobby originated in the United States in 2007 after founder Marshall L. Saunders recognized the need for progressive climate legislation. Saunders, a successful businessman turned philanthropist, internationally recognized for his work in microcredit, became increasingly concerned about climate change. Saunders increasingly recognized that while it was necessary for individuals to change their own behavior in the face of climate change, it would never be enough; the time had come for Congress to discontinue subsidizing the fossil fuel industry. With ever-rising energy production and increased use Saunders believed effective legislation was necessary to cut carbon emissions, by putting a price on carbon. Saunders coordinated his efforts to establish Citizens' Climate Lobby with RESULTS, an organization committed to helping volunteer organizations seeking legislative changes to become more effective. Groups of volunteers organized by electoral districts could work through local media and elected officials to build public support and political will for change. Citizens' Climate Lobby established its primary, interconnected goals – to achieve legislation at the federal level that would effectively mitigate climate change, to create widespread political will for a sustainable climate, and to empower citizens to better exercise their own political and personal will. United States leadership is widely seen as critical in international emissions reduction efforts, and particularly in carbon pricing, as this would encourage other countries to follow suit with similar legislation. The Citizens' Climate Lobby held its first annual conference in 2009 in Washington D.C., bringing together representatives from around the United States as well as several Canadians. These Canadians subsequently led the establishment of the organization within Canada in 2011, with the first chapter emerging in Sudbury, Ontario. Since the initial development of Citizens' Climate Lobby, the group has rapidly grown and spread, from 3 local groups in 2007 to 327 groups in May 2016. They are located throughout the United States and Canada, and more recently branching out to other countries including Sweden, Bangladesh (both starting in 2013), Australia, Germany, India, Nepal, Panama, United Kingdom, Burundi, Brazil, Cameroon, Chile, France, Kenya, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Qatar, Poland, Romania, Portugal, Serbia, Scotland, Switzerland and the Ukraine. Volunteers in local chapters meet monthly for teleconference lectures by climate experts and communication with other groups, to discuss coordinated actions to be undertaken by members, to practice skills involved in lobbying politicians and dealing with media, and to plan local outreach. These activities support the ongoing goals of the organization and contribute to progress toward effective carbon pricing legislation.  Proposed US legislation Citizens' Climate Lobby proposes national legislation that would reduce US greenhouse gas emissions by placing a fee on carbon dioxide () or equivalent gases. The fee would be levied against all fossil fuels at their point of entry into the economy. The revenue that would be collected would be 100% returned as a monthly or annual payment to every American household. This would protect low and middle class Americans from the rising consumer costs associated with the carbon fee. This idea is known as a carbon fee and dividend. CCL's proposal would start the fee at US$15 per ton of equivalent ( cent per pound) and rise $10 per ton each year ( cent per pound). The fee would continue to rise until total US equivalent emissions have been reduced to 10% of US equivalent emissions in 1990. To protect US businesses from competition from other countries that do not have carbon pricing mechanisms, a border adjustment would be enacted. Similar to the Montreal Protocol, goods coming from countries without a carbon price would be subjected to a fee at the border. Goods leaving the US for sale in a country without a carbon price would be reimbursed that fee at the border. In addition, all existing subsidies of fossil fuels, including tax credits, would be phased out over the 5 years following enactment. On September 1, 2016, the California State Legislature passed a measure that urges the United States Congress to enact a tax on carbon-based fossil fuels. The proposal is revenue- neutral, with all money collected going to the bottom two-thirds of American households. So while the resolution is framed as a tax, it is in fact a carbon fee and dividend scheme. Model policy in Canada  The Canadian province of British Columbia enacted a revenue-neutral carbon tax in 2008. The British Columbia carbon tax enabled so called \\"carbon funded tax cuts\\" because the revenue, instead of being returned as a dividend, is used to offset corporate and personal income taxes. In 2015, a review of British Columbia's emissions found that they had fallen 16% since 2008, while economic activity outperformed the rest of Canada. The policy has been called \\"popular across the political spectrum\\" and been considered a model for policies in other states and countries. Proposed measure in Washington In 2016, a group called CarbonWA, allied but unaffiliated with the Citizens Climate Lobby, submitted a carbon pricing measure to the ballot in the state of Washington. The initiative, known as Washington Initiative 732, would impose a steadily rising fee on emissions of carbon dioxide, and use that revenue to offset the state's sales tax, business tax, and to expand the state's version of the earned income tax credit.  Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act  On November 27, 2018, Climate Solutions Caucus members Representatives Ted Deutch (D-FL), Francis Rooney (R-FL), Charlie Crist (D-FL), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), and John Delaney (D-MD) introduced the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (HR 7173). A few days later, a companion Senate bill was introduced by Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and Jeff Flake (R-AZ). The bill was reintroduced into the 116th Congress under the same name as HR 763. If passed, a national carbon fee and dividend would be implemented similar to that described above. Economic basis for action Shultz was former secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan. Becker is Nobel laureate economist and economics professor at the University of Chicago. Greg Mankiw was Mitt Romney's former economic adviser. Nicholas Stern is chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and also chair of the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP) at Leeds University and LSE. Shi-Ling Hsu is the D'Alemberte Professor and Associate Dean for Environmental Programs, Florida State University College of Law. Economist and law professor Shi-Ling Hsu also supports a revenue-neutral carbon tax. In his book The Case for a Carbon Tax, Getting Past our Hangups to Effective Climate Policy and in his talks, he explains the economics of carbon pricing and why he believes that putting a price on carbon in the form of a carbon tax is more effective and efficient than cap and trade or command and control style legislation.  Stern Review 2006  Economist Nicholas Stern also supports putting a price on carbon as explained in his Stern Review. The Stern Review is significant in that it is the largest and most widely known and discussed economic report on climate change of its kind. Entitled Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, this 700-page report was released for the British government on October 30, 2006. In it, Stern discusses the effect of global warming on the world economy, and states that climate change is the greatest and widest-ranging market failure ever seen, presenting a unique challenge for economics. According to the Stern Review, without action, the overall costs of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least 5% of global gross domestic product (GDP) each year, now and forever. The Review provides prescriptions including environmental taxes to minimize the economic and social disruptions. The Stern Review's main conclusion is that the benefits of strong, early action on climate change far outweigh the costs of not acting. Some of the report's main conclusions are: * The benefits of strong, early action on climate change outweigh the costs. * The scientific evidence points to increasing risks of serious, irreversible impacts from climate change associated with business-as-usual (BAU) paths for emissions. * Climate change threatens the basic elements of life for people around the world – access to water, food production, health, use of land and the environment. * The impacts of climate change are not evenly distributed – the poorest countries and people will suffer earliest and most. And if and when the damages appear it will be too late to reverse the process. Thus we are forced to look a long way ahead. * Emissions have been, and continue to be, driven by economic growth; yet stabilization of greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere is feasible and consistent with continued growth. * Establishing a carbon price, through tax, trading or regulation, is an essential foundation for climate change policy. * There is still time to avoid the worst impacts of climate change if strong collective action starts now.  Energy Modeling Forum study 2012  In late-2012 the Energy Modeling Forum (EMF), coordinated by Stanford University, released its EMF29 study titled \\"The role of border carbon adjustment in unilateral climate policy\\". It is well understood that unilateral climate policy can lead to emissions leakage. As one example, trade-exposed emissions-intensive industries may simply relocate to regions with laxer climate protection. A border carbon adjustment (BCA) program can help counter this and related effects. Under such a policy, tariffs are levied on the carbon embodied in imported goods from unregulated trading partners while the original climate protection payments for exported goods are rebated. The study finds that the BCA programs evaluated can reduce emissions leakage, can yield modest gains in global economic efficiency, and will shift substantial costs from abating OECD countries to non-abating non-OECD countries. This last finding is regressive and counter to the equity principles contained in the UNFCCC.  Regional Economic Models study 2014  A private economic modeling company, Regional Economic Models, Inc (REMI), was commissioned by Citizens' Climate Lobby to conduct an objective analysis of the economic impacts of a revenue neutral carbon fee and dividend in the US. The study found that, if enacted in 2016, by 2036: US emissions would be reduced 50% below 1990 levels; because of the economic stimulus of recycling carbon fee revenue back to households 2.8 million jobs would be added to the American economy; improved air quality would result in 230,000 premature deaths avoided over that time period.  Organizational structure  Citizens' Climate Lobby is a network involving its US, international and Canadian head offices, and the dedicated volunteers that comprise the various chapters throughout the United States and Canada and other countries. Until his death in December 2019, Marshall Saunders remained the organization's president[https://community.citizensclimate.org/marshall Remembering Marshall Saunders: In memory of CCL founder Marshall Saunders: 1939–2019. Citizens Climate Lobby website. Accessed December 28, 2019.] alongside his wife, Pamela Saunders. Mark Reynolds is the group's executive director. Cathy Orlando serves as the manager for the Canadian branch of the Citizens' Climate Lobby. Regional coordinators in the US regularly communicate with the local group leaders in their geographical region. Aside from the few paid staff members, the organization is run by thousands of volunteers. Often volunteers will initiate a new group by themselves, or with just one or two others, until they find enough other people nearby to formally start a new group. When a new group is started, orientation and training is provided through the respective national office. Citizens' Climate Lobby is coordinated through regular email communication at all levels, monthly international teleconferences and group meetings, weekly international, national or regional group leader calls; national websites; social media communication at different levels. The largest focal point each year is the Annual International Conference in June, which includes meeting with and lobbying as many members of Congress as possible in Washington D.C. Canada's Citizens' Climate Lobby has in the past coordinated its annual meeting and lobbying activities in Ottawa with other organizations but held its first Annual Conference and Lobbying Days in November 2013. Citizens' Climate Lobby additionally holds a smaller, secondary conference known as the Congressional Education day each November.  Priorities and influence  The work of Citizens' Climate Lobby has an influence at the local and the national scale. At the local scale, Citizens' Climate Lobby brings concerned citizens together as a community to educate themselves and others, including through the media, and to create a voice on climate change to present to locally elected representatives of the federal government. This includes Members of the House of Representatives and Senators in the United States and Members of Parliament and Senators (appointed) in Canada. Citizens' Climate Lobby believes it is important for members to meet and create a relationship with local representatives as a means of \\"putting a face\\" on local chapters and to provide information and state their concerns regarding climate change legislation. When there is an important climate bill being considered in the nation's capital, members of Citizens' Climate Lobby bring it to the attention of their elected representatives and lobby for their support as appropriate. The chapters also act to keep citizens informed about climate legislation and timely actions to take. Monthly local chapter meetings allow members to share information about climate change issues, to plan for upcoming events related to climate change and to provide mutual support. At the national level Citizens' Climate Lobby chapters can directly influence federal legislation via the work completed at the local level. These chapters contribute to a growing network of people across the country who share the same initiative. Together these individuals and groups become a powerful voice that can capture the attention of other citizens and of municipal and federal representatives alike.  Initiatives  Citizens' Climate Lobbyists create political will for a sustainable climate and empower others in many ways, including by: * Educating themselves, their friends and people of influence about the science, economics, sociology, business, denial machine, politics, communication, and many other aspects of climate change. They sponsor weekly educational webinars which are nicknamed \\"Citizens' Climate University (CCU)\\". * Writing handwritten letters to politicians, especially Members of Congress, Parliament and National Assemblies, and recruiting others to do so. * Lobbying politicians directly in their constituency offices and in the capital cities. * Participating in community events where they engage the public in climate change awareness and actions. * Creating awareness in the media by writing stories, blogs, media releases, letters to the editor, opinion editorials, tweets, status updates, etc., and submitting them to traditional (radio, TV, and newspapers) and 21st century sources (blogs, online magazine and social media). * Developing partnerships, alliances and relationships with a range of groups towards building a broad and diverse base support which will create political will for a sustainable climate  Accomplishments  * The number of local groups has grown significantly, from 3 in 2007, 74 in 2012, and 590 in May 2020. * Citizens' Climate Lobby has written a legislative proposal, The Carbon Fee and Dividend Act, introduced by Dr. James Hansen at an Earth Day rally on the National Mall in Washington. * Published Letters to the Editor have grown from 646 in 2012 to 2,583 in 2014, to 3,574 in 2015, to 4,293 in 2020. * Letters to Members of Congress have grown from 6,991 in 2014, to 40,990 in 2016, to 74,851 in 2017, to 98,886 in 2020 . * Editorial Board meetings have grown from 24 in 2012 to 52 in 2014. Published Opinion Editorials (Op Eds) have grown from 87 in 2012 to 291 in 2014. * Congressional Meetings have grown from 534 in 2012, to 1,086 in 2014, to 1387 in 2016. * The annual international conference in Washington, D.C., has grown from 175 attendees in 2012, to 367 attendees in 2013, to over 1,300 attendees in 2017. In 2015, over 800 volunteers participated in 487 meetings with Congressional offices. * Citizen Climate Lobby published an economic report, Building a Green Economy (September 2010) written by CCL member Joseph Robertson. The report is now used as a source with the media and Members of Congress.  CCL by country   Canada  Canada's Citizens' Climate Lobby participates in many climate related projects and actions. Some of the initiatives to date include: * Joining US volunteers at the Annual Conference/Lobbying in Washington, D.C.; to meeting with Members of Congress. * Meeting with Members of Parliament (Canada) and Members of provincial legislative assemblies (MLAs/MPPs/MHAs/MNAs) to discuss carbon fee and dividend policy and other climate issues. * Working in collaboration with the Climate Action Network Canada to encourage Canada's government to remove fossil fuel subsidies and put a fair price on carbon pollution. * Pushing for a Pan Canada Energy Strategy * Participating in the Parliamentary Petition Project for a sustainable climate. * Developing relationships and strategic partnerships with like-minded groups locally, provincially, nationally and internationally.  Germany  In Germany, CCL is known as ' and abbreviated . Like other CCL groups, seek a steadily rising and socially equitable price on carbon. However their first focus is on overhauling the European Union Emissions Trading System (EUETS) as follows: * extend the EUETS so that all emissions are covered and modify the annual cap so that 2030 emissions sink by at least 50% relative to 1990 levels * introduce a continuously increasing floor price for allowances * introduce a WTO compliant border adjustment system to level the playing field between European companies and their global competitors As long as there is no effective price signal at the EU level, call for a national carbon tax for Germany on all emissions as a transitional measure. A central theme for is that, for an equitable and socially-compatible carbon price, all revenues must be redistributed back to the population on a per-capita basis.  Connections  Citizens' Climate Lobby is a non-partisan group that develops and maintains relationships with and may coordinate some activities with a broad base of organizations that share similar goals. In 2013, Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org, endorsed CCL by saying \\"I love working with Citizens' Climate Lobby—their relentless focus on the need for a fee-and- dividend solution is helping drive the debate in precisely the right direction. I'm enormously grateful for their persistence and creativity.\\" See also * 10:10 – a climate change campaign * 350.org * Air pollution reduction efforts * Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change – a 2005 conference on the topic * Carbon fee and dividend * Carbon price * Climate change mitigation * Climate change policy of the United States * Climate movement * Climate Solutions Caucus * Conservation (ethic) * Economics of global warming * Environmental movement * Garnaut Climate Change Review * Individual and political action on climate change * List of environmental issues * Politics of global warming * Stern Review * World Energy Outlook References External links Citizens' Climate Lobby sites and groups * * Citizens' Climate Lobby list of chapters worldwide * Citizens' Climate Lobby Australia * Citizens' Climate Lobby Canada * Citizens' Climate Lobby Germany – known in Germany as Bürgerlobby Klimaschutz * Citizens' Climate Lobby Poland – known in Poland as Citizens' Climate Lobby Polska * Citizens' Climate Lobby Sweden – known in Sweden as Klimatsvaret – CCL Sverige * Citizens' Climate Lobby main Facebook page * Citizens' Climate Lobby Canada Facebook page Videos * Citizens' Climate Lobby fee and dividend proposal video * Citizens' Climate Lobby local groups video Category:2007 establishments in the United States Category:Carbon finance Category:International climate change organizations Category:Climate change organizations based in the United States Category:Climate change policy Category:Climate change policy in the United States Category:Coronado, California Category:Economic policy Category:Ecotax Category:Emissions reduction Category:Energy policy Category:Environmental organizations based in California Category:Environmental organizations established in 2007 Category:Environmental policies organizations Category:International environmental organizations Category:Lobbying organizations in the United States Category:Non-profit organizations based in the United States Category:Organizations based in San Diego County, California ","title":"Citizens' Climate Lobby"},{"id":"39122469","text":"Dehnow-e Jari (, also Romanized as Dehnow-e Jarī; also known as Dehno) is a village in Kuhestan Rural District, Jazmurian District, Rudbar-e Jonubi County, Kerman Province, Iran.

Running roughly parallel to Frederiksberg Allé and Vesterbrogade, it extends from Vesterport station at the southern end of The Lakes and continues for some 1.8 km west to Frederiksberg City Hall Square where it continues as Smallegade. In the opposite end, Jernbanegade connects it to Copenhagen City Hall Square. History Gammel Kongevej seen on a map detail from the 18th century Gammel Kongevej is one of the oldest road sections in Frederiksberg, originally providing a direct connection between Copenhagen's Western City Gate and the village of Solbjerg. From there the road continued past the Damhus Lake towards Roskilde, giving rise to the name Roskildegaden (\\"The Roskilde Street\\"), which is seen in some documents from the beginning of the 17th century. Gammel Kongevej and Vesterbrogade seen diverging from Valby Hill in 1758 The road was improved by Christian IV in the 1620s. The name Kongevejen (English: King's Road) emerged about a generation later when it became the principal road to Ny Amager (New Amager), as Frederiksberg was then called, where the king had several properties. The name of the road changed to Gammel Kongevej after a new Route de Roie, Frederiksberg Allé, opened in 1705. The road passed through open countryside with only a few scattered country houses until the mid-19th century when Copenhagen's fortifications were decommissioned and the city was allowed to develop freely. A number of new country houses were built along the rad but most of them were replaced by multi-story apartment buildings with shops in the ground floors in the 1880s and 1890s. Gammel Kongevej in 1909: One of the old country houses to the right and the former iron foundry on the left, both now demolished P. Andersen opened the Svanholm Brewery at No. 64 in 1853. It was merged with several other breweries to form The United Breweries in 1891 and most of its buildings were replaced by a machine factory and iron factory. Part of the site was cleared in 1904-05 to make way for the new street Prinsesse Maries Allé. The rest of the industrial plant was replaced by the cinema complex Kinopalæet in 1918. Gammel Kongevej mainly catered to the middle and upper middle classes. The area next to the iron foundry was home to a small working-class neighbourhood with an infamous reputation. In the 1950s, Jørn Utzon, architect of the Sydney Opera House, drafted a project for the area which was never built. It consisted of tower blocks in a green space inspired by Japanese gardens. Notable buildings and residents Dating from the 1850s, No. 78 is one of the oldest apartment buildings along the street. It has a small front garden and a fence towards the street. The Catholic school Ansgarstiftelsen at No. 15 is decorated with a mural byNiels Macholm mural, Just off Gammel Kongevej, between the streets H.C. Ørsteds Vej and Bülowsvej, is a small enclave which has been described as Denmark's first urban neighbourhood of single-family detached homes. It consists of the side streets Uraniavej and Lindevej. The area around Sankt Jørgens Sø is home to a cluster of modern buildings which include the Tycho Brahe Planetarium and two highrises, Copenhagen Scandic Hotel and the 18-storey Codan Building.

In the Muslim world the opposite point of view — that the Quran is uncreated — is the accepted stance among the majority Sunni Muslims and the Kharijites while minority sects Shia Twelvers and Zaydi believe the Quran is created. The dispute over which was true became a significant point of contention in early Islam. The Islamic rationalist philosophical school known as the Mu'tazila held that if the Quran is God's word, logically God \\"must have preceded his own speech\\". The Qur'an, of course, expresses God's eternal will, but the work itself must have been created by Him at some point in time. Traditionists, on the other hand, held that numerous records of the words, actions, or approval of Muhammad (aḥādīth) support the contention that as God's speech, the Qur’an is an attribute of God and therefore \\"uncreated\\". History The controversy over the doctrine in the Abassid caliphate came to a head during the reign of Caliph Abd Allah al-Ma’mun. In 827 CE, al-Ma’mun publicly adopted the doctrine of createdness, and six year later instituting an inquisition known as the mihna (test or ordeal) to \\"ensure acquiescence in this doctrine\\".John A. Nawas, \\"A Reexamination of Three Current Explanations for al-Ma’mun’s Introduction of the Mihna\\". International Journal of Middle East Studies 26.4 (November 1994): 615. According to Sunni tradition, when \\"tested\\", traditionist Ahmad ibn Hanbal refused to accept the doctrine of createdness despite two years imprisonment and being scourged until unconscious. Eventually, due to Ahmad ibn Hanbal's determination,Patton, Ibn Ḥanbal and the Miḥna, 1897: p.2 Caliph Al-Mutawakkil ʿAlā ’llāh, brought the mihna to an end and the Mu'tazila doctrine was silenced for a time. In the years thereafter, it was the minority of Muslims who believed in Quranic createdness who were on the receiving end of the sword or lash. The influential scholar Al-Tabari (d.923) declared in his aqidah (creed) that (in the words of Islamic historian Michael Cook) the Quran is 12th century Almoravid jurist Qadi Ayyad, citing the work of Malik ibn Anas, wrote that: Arguments and implications Shia Al-Islam.org, a website which collects Shia scholarly works, cites Ash-Shaykh as-Saduq (aka Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn 'Ali Ibn Babawayh al-Qummi c. 923–991) as disagreeing with Sunnis on the issue of the Quran's createdness on the grounds that God's attributes of doing (creating, giving sustenance, etc.) cannot be eternal since they require objects to do actions to. For this to be true, \\"we will have to admit that the world has always existed. But it is against our belief that nothing except God is Eternal.\\" Author Allamah Sayyid Sa'eed Akhtar Rizvi goes on to say that Sunni scholars failure to make this distinction and insist that \\"all His attributes are Eternal\\" is the cause of their belief that \\"the kalam (speech) of God, is Eternal, not created\\". Akhtar Rizvi states: However, the site quotes another leading Shia Ayatullah Sayyid Abulqasim al-Khui (1899–1992) (in Al-Bayan fi Tafsir al-Qur’an, the Prolegomena to the Qur’an), declaring that \\"the question of whether the Qur'an was created or eternal is an extraneous matter that has no connection with the Islamic doctrine\\", and blames the intrusion of the ideas of alien \\"Greek philosophy\\" into the Muslim community for dividing the Ummah \\"into factions which accused each other of disbelief\\". Mutazilah The adherents of the Muʿtazili school, known as Muʿtazilites, are best known for rejecting the doctrine of the Qur'an as uncreated and co-eternal with God,Abdullah Saeed. The Qur'an: an introduction. 2008, page 203 asserting that if the Quran is the word of God, he logically \\"must have preceded his own speech\\". Based on Q.2:106 some Mutazilah also argued that if the Qur'an could be subjected to abrogation, with a new verse abrogating an earlier one, it could not be eternal. Other Mutazilah however denied the theory of abrogation and did not believe any verse of the Quran was abrogated. Implications Malise Ruthven argues that believers in an uncreated, and thus eternal and unchanging, Quran also argued for predestination of the afterlife of mortals. The two ideas are associated with each other (according to Rwekaza Sympho Mukandala) because if there is predestination (if all events including the afterlife of all humans has been willed by God) then God \\"in His omnipotence and omniscience must have willed and known about\\" events related in the Quran. Believers in a created Quran emphasize free will given to mortals who would be rewarded or punished according to what they chose in life on judgement day. Advocates of the \\"created\\" Quran emphasized the references to an 'Arabic' Quran which occur in the divine text, noting that if the Quran was uncreated it was – like God – an eternal being. This gave it (they argued) a status similar to God, constituting a form of bi-theism or shirk. Remi Brague argues that while a created Quran may be interpreted \\"in the juridical sense of the word\\", an uncreated Quran can only be applied – the application being susceptible only \\"to grammatical explication (tasfir) and mystical elucidation (ta'wil)\\" — not interpreted. Ahmad ibn Hanbal and the Mihna (ordeal) Ahmad ibn Hanbal In standing up for his beliefs, Sunni scholar and muhaddith ibn Hanbal refused to engage in kalam during his interrogation. He was willing to “argue” only on the basis of the Qur’an or the traditions and their “literal” meaning.Patton, Ibn Ḥanbal and the Miḥna, 1897: p.106 While this distinction itself is difficult to make in practice, its value is in part rhetorical, for the assertion marks his identity as one who stands by the absolute authority of the sacred texts over-above those who make use of reason. The role of Ahmad ibn Hanbal in the mihna ordeal garnered significant attention in the later historiography of Sunni Islam. Walter Patton (in Aḥmad Ibn Ḥanbal and the Miḥna) presents him as a stalwart of belief, claimed that he did more than any other to strengthen the position of “orthodoxy”. The Mihna Scholars do not agree on why caliph al-Ma’mun acted as he did. Walter Patton for instance, claims that while partisans might have made political capital out of the public adoption of the doctrine, al-Ma’mun’s intention was “primarily to effect a religious reform.” Patton, Ibn Ḥanbal and the Miḥna, 1897: p.54 Nawas on the other hand, argues that the doctrine of createdness was a “pseudo-issue,” insisting that its promulgation was unlikely an end in itself since the primary sources attached so little significance to its declaration.Nawas, 1994: 623-624. The test of the mihna was applied neither universally nor arbitrarily. In fact, the letter that Al-Ma’mun sent to his lieutenant in Baghdad instituting the mihna stipulated that the test be administered to qadis and traditionists (muhaddithin). Both of these groups regard hadith as central to Qur’anic interpretation and to matters of Islamic jurisprudence. In particular, the rhetorical force of muhaddithin acceptance of the doctrine is then to concede that either or both of the Qur’an and the hadith corpus attest to the doctrine, simultaneously validating the caliph’s theological position and legitimizing his claim to hermeneutical authority with regard to the sacred texts.  The significance of hadith  That the question of the createdness of the Qur’an is, among other things, a hermeneutical issue is reflected in the variety of arguments and issues that associate with it – whether the Qur’an or the traditions assert the Qur’an’s createdness, what “created” means, and whether and how this affects the standing of these texts as authoritative and as a consequence, the status of those who study them. Where the Qur’an is understood as the word of God, and the words and example of the Prophet transmitted through hadith also attain to divine significance, if the Qur’an cannot be taken to assert its own createdness, for the doctrine of createdness to be true the traditions would have to support it. Indeed, to admit the insufficiency of the hadith corpus to adjudicate what with the institution of the mihna becomes such a visible dispute would necessarily marginalize the authority of traditions. Thus it is not by accident that al-Ma’mun decides to administer the test on religious scholars.

Originally titled as \\"Dumb + Dumb = You\\", \\"Einstein\\" was written by Clarkson, Toby Gad, Bridget Kelly, and James Fauntleroy II, with Gad handling the production. Lyrically, the song is written in a woman's first-person narrative about her acquiescence and infuriation towards her ex-lover, whom she described in the song as \\"dumb\\". Written in wordplay, it uses various mathematical-related equations and topics as rhetorical devices to describe their relationship, notably referencing the German-born physicist Albert Einstein in a metaphorical lyric, which led to the song being named after him. Upon its release, \\"Einstein\\" received mixed reviews from music critics, whose criticism targeted the song's lyrical content, primarily the lyric \\"Dumb plus dumb equals you\\", but also complimented Clarkson's vocal performance. Propelled by digital sales during the album's release week, \\"Einstein\\" charted at number 56 in the South Korean Singles Chart. She has performed the song in select dates of her Stronger Tour.  Background and release  \\"Einstein\\" was written by Kelly Clarkson, Toby Gad, Bridget Kelly, and James Fauntleroy II; and produced by Gad. Kelly initially wrote the song for her debut studio album, but ultimately gave it to Clarkson. Kelly recalled: > \\"I wrote the record initially thinking that it would be a part of my > project. I don’t really know what I thought. I think, as a writer, you just > come up with ideas in songs and you never know what’s going to happen to > them—you just do them off inspiration. I didn’t know what kind of life it > would take, but I’m really happy it ended up with Kelly.\\" In May 2011, a demo of the song was leaked into the internet, but was quickly taken down. The final version of the track was selected for inclusion for her fifth studio album, Stronger, which was released in October 2011.  Composition  \\"Einstein\\" is a midtempo funk rock song. Its lyrical content mains focuses on a woman's realization and anger towards her ex-lover's, with its chorus centering on the realization that it won't take an intelligence like Albert Einstein's to figure out his feeble-mindedness, using a faux- formula phrase \\"Dumb + dumb = you.\\" Clarkson revealed about its musical's content: \\"I think there’s always going to be that level with me. That’s the type of music I love. I grew up loving feisty women singers. I find a lot of joy in getting all that crap out of your system. I haven’t been in a bad relationship in years. It’s just that I've been in a bad relationship, and I think when you’re singing any song like that, you pull from the one thing in your life that you know you've experienced.\\" Gil Kaufman of MTV noted its same pop rock vibe to \\"Since U Been Gone\\" (2004).  Critical response  \\"Einstein\\" received mixed reviews from music critics. Chris Willman of Reuters gave a positive review, he wrote: \\"The rocker \\"Einstein\\" sounds like it might've been written for Pink, though it probably wasn't, since Clarkson gets a co-writing credit. Against guitar squalls and live drums, she does the romantic math (\\"Our love divided by the square root of pride...It was heavy when I finally figured it out\\") and concludes that \\"dumb plus dumb equals you,\\" a formula that will surely help kids get interested in arithmetic this fall.\\" Jason Lipshutz of Billboard, however, wrote, \\"Yes, \\"Einstein\\" is fun. Yes, Clarkson sounds spectacular. But the refrain reads, \\"Dumb plus dumb equals you.\\" Moving on!\\" Ken Tucker of NPR wrote in his review, \\"She sometimes seems to be singing songs that Justin Timberlake rejected. How else to explain the choice of a song such as \\"Einstein,\\" with its tortured, mathematically illiterate organizing metaphor? Some of the song's verses are fun just because they're so ostentatiously foolish.\\" But also added, \\"\\"Dumb plus dumb equals you,\\" Clarkson bellows. On second thought, I kind of love that performance, in its goofy way. Far better is the kind of crisp vocal work Clarkson brings to a vocal hook worthy of her dramatized agony\\". Brian Mansfield of USA Today was equivocal on the song's lyrical content. He wrote, \\"the reliability of the narrator is in question, as she sings, \\"You say I'm crazy, and that we're happy/Is that supposed to comfort me?\\" Is the guy a lech who flirts with other women in front of her, or is she just loopy nuts? Your guess is as good as mine.\\" Jim Farber of the New York Daily News referred the chorus of the song as some of the worst lines in pop history. (\\"I may not be Einstein/but I know that dumb plus dumb equals you\\").  Credits and personnel  Credits adapted from the Stronger liner notes.

Cast * Paul Sand: Robert Dreyfuss * Michael Pataki: Charlie Dreyfuss * Penny Marshall: Janice Dreyfuss * Dick Wesson: Jack Riordan * Steve Landesberg: Fred Meyerbach * Craig Richard Nelson: Mason Woodruff * Jack Gilford: Ben Dreyfuss * Jan Miner: Marge Dreyfuss Synopsis Robert Dreyfuss is a young bachelor and double-bass player who returns to Boston after living in Denver, Colorado, for three years and wins a job playing with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He is a romantic who falls in love easily with the women he meets, but he has little luck with them because he is shy, passive, dour- faced, and tends to say the wrong things at the wrong time. In sharp contrast, his older brother Charlie is aggressive, loud, physically fit, and athletic. Charlie is protective of Robert, while Charlie's affection-starved wife Janice constantly mocks Robert for his romantic failures, and Robert often gets caught in the middle of the arguments to which Charlie and Janice are prone. Charlie and Janice have a three-year-old son named Brendan who is mentioned in the first episode, but Brendan never appears in the show and is never discussed in any other episode. Ben and Marge are Roberts and Charlies parents.Leszczak, Bob, Single Season Sitcoms, 1948–1979, Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland and Publishers, Inc., 2012. . In the orchestra, Robert makes friends with an Austrian violinist, Fred Meyerbach, who has a strained relationship with his father. They must deal with the young, sarcastic, and overweight conductor, Mason Woodruff, and the antagonistic orchestra manager, Jack Riordan. Production Paul Sand was a rising star – he had won a Tony Award on Broadway and received good reviews for his appearances on The Carol Burnett Show and The Mary Tyler Moore Show – when MTM Enterprises decided to give him his own situation comedy in 1974. In order to give the show the maximum possible exposure to new viewers, CBS aired Friends and Lovers on Saturday at 8:30 p.m. between two blockbuster hit situation comedies, All in the Family at 8:00 p.m. and The Mary Tyler Moore Show at 9:00 p.m. – arguably the best time slot for a new series in the autumn of 1974. The show also received much publicity, touted as the \\"sleeper\\" hit of the fall 1974 season. James L. Brooks and Allan Burns created and were the executive producers of the show. Writers included Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, Gordon Farr, Lowell Ganz, Steve Gordon, Andrew Johnson, Monica Mcgowan Johnson, Arnold Kane, Allan Leicht, Coleman Mitchell, Phil Mishkin, Geoffrey Neigher, Mary Kay Place, Steve Pritzker, and Bud Wiser. Episode directors were Peter Bonerz, Bob Claver, Tim Kiley, Robert Moore, Alan Rafkin, and Jay Sandrich The show was filmed in color before a studio audience. Episodes Cancellation Some critics expressed disappointment in Friends and Lovers – the Boston Herald Americans Anthony La Camera called it \\"a downright disappointment\\" and the Boston Globes Percy Shain said it was \\"mundane and average, with few laughs\\" – but others gave it more favorable reviews. The premiere episode on September 14, 1974, was the 14th-most-watched show of the week, and during its run the show had good ratings – for example, a 36 share in early October 1974 – and was the 25th most-viewed television show of the season. However, its ratings paled in comparison to those of the shows before and after it; it lost viewers from All in the Family, which had a 51 share in early October 1974, and network executives believed that it did not provide a good lead-in audience for The Mary Tyler Moore Show, viewership of which fell from previous seasons to a 39 share by early October 1974. Especially given the high hopes the network had had for the show, it was considered a ratings disappointment for its highly advantageous time slot and, in fact, one of the bigger disappointments of the fall 1974 season. CBS cancelled the show after only 15 episodes, the last of which was broadcast on January 4, 1975. Along with The Texas Wheelers, Friends and Lovers was one of the first two MTM Enterprises shows ever to be cancelled. In January 1975, two weeks after it last aired, Friends and Lovers was replaced in its time slot by a new show, The Jeffersons. A better fit for CBSs Saturday-evening line-up, The Jeffersons was a major hit which aired in first-run production for the next ten years. Notes References *Leszczak, Bob.

Proposed by NASA contractor Brand Griffin, Skylab II would have been constructed as a \\"wet workshop\\" using a spent upper- stage hydrogen fuel tank from the Space Launch System (SLS), much as the Skylab was originally planned to be built \\"wet\\" from the spent bipropellant tanks of the Saturn S-IVB upper stage. If constructed, Skylab II would have been the first crewed outpost located beyond the orbit of the Moon. Space station design Skylab II would have orbited the Earth-Moon L2 point, which revolves around the Earth at an approximate mean distance of from the surface, and stays approximately beyond the far surface of the Moon. Given its location far away from the nearest food, water, and air, the first iteration of the space station would have had to have been able to support a four-person crew for 60 days on one shipment of supplies, to be eventually improved to 180 days. As Skylab II would be built from an SLS hydrogen fuel tank, the costs of assembly were estimated at a relatively low $2 billion, a tremendous savings over a previously projected cost of $4.175 billion for a similar space station. The space station would have large modules with diameters of --much larger than the diameter of International Space Station modules or the diameter of the original Skylab. This large diameter would lead to a module volume of about , allowing for a large amount of space for both storage and habitation. This large interior volume, in turn, would make Skylab II suitable for its deep-space location, where resupply missions would be rare and astronauts would have to store the food they received from each mission for months at a time. The supplies themselves could be carried in a variety of vehicles, such as the existing Progress and Dragon, or perhaps a new, SLS- derived logistics module, which could resupply the whole station in one mission. Potential uses Once at Earth-Moon L2, Skylab II could be a \\"stepping stone\\" for further human exploration in the Solar System, for example by being a docking site for a crewed lunar lander before the trip to the Moon. The second use would be to add a servicing capability for the astrophysics missions located near Earth-Sun L2, extending the cryogenic mission lifetime of such missions by continually refilling their liquid helium and enabling some astrophysics missions which may otherwise have not been possible or would have been launched in a less-capable state. For extravehicular activities (EVAs) near the space station, a small, one-person FlexCraft may be used in lieu of a spacesuit to improve dexterity and safety for astronauts, as well as the efficiency of EVAs. FlexCraft would eliminate the requirement of an astronaut to prebreathe the pure oxygen atmosphere in a spacesuit, reducing overhead time for EVAs significantly and enabling longer EVAs to be carried out. Additionally, FlexCraft would improve astronaut speed during EVAs, as moving around space installations would be faster and less physically demanding in automated vehicles.

Personal history and tribal identification  Paulla \\"Sunflower\\" Dove Jennings was born to Eleanor (Clan Mother Pretty Flower) and Ferris (War Chief Roaring Bull) Dove. Her family is of mixed Niantic and Narragansett tribal identification. The family hails from the Turtle Clan, known as keepers of history, tribal lore, and legends. Jennings' father was the last traditional Narragansett war chief and graduated from Bacone College. He and his wife ran a popular restaurant and trading post for many years called Dovecrest, later the site of a school aimed at teaching a curriculum which reflected native history and values. Jennings was one of four children, she learned her tribal and family history from her grandmother.  Career  Jennings also obtained a degree from the Community College of Rhode Island and has worked as a curator for both the Boston Children's Museum and the Tomaquag Indian Memorial Museum in Exeter, Rhode Island. She has performed as a storyteller at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. In 2010, Jennings served as the Tribal Historian in Residence for the certificate program in Native American Studies at the UMASS Amherst. In addition to her work as an educator and storyteller, Jennings has been politically active in her tribe. She has served on her tribal council, and in 2007 ran an unsuccessful campaign for the position of chief sachem. She and her son Adam were among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit against Rhode Island State Police, which in July 2003 raided a tribal smoke shop. The raid resulted in eight arrests and eight injured, including Jennings's son. Jennings herself has spoken publicly about the case as an infringement on Narragansett tribal sovereignty.  Strawberry Thanksgiving  Strawberry Thanksgiving was written for the Multicultural Celebrations at The Children's Museum of Boston, part of a series of books designed to educate children about different cultures. Written by Jennings and illustrated by Ramona Peters, the book tells how a young boy, Adam, learns to forgive his sister by hearing his grandmother tell the story of Strawberry Thanksgiving.

They play their home games at the Jaraguay stadium. History The team was created on December 5, 2012 at a meeting held by team president Nelson Soto Duque, the mayor of Montería, and the governor of Córdoba. In an initiative led by the Montería city hall and the Córdoba government, with support from local companies, an agreement was reached with the direction to move Sucre F.C. from Sincelejo to Montería from 2013 under the name Jaguares de Córdoba. Soto Duque is the major owner of the club that was founded in 1995 as Girardot. It has moved four times, and played under the names Deportes Palmira, Pacífico, Sucre, and finally Jaguares. On February 3, 2013, the team debuted at the Primera B winning 2–1 against Real Cartagena, and the following year they earned promotion to the Categoría Primera A after winning the Torneo Postobón 2014-I by defeating América de Cali 5–1 on aggregate score in the final, and then beat 2014-II winners Deportes Quindío in the final of the year, winning 3–2 on aggregate score after losing the first leg 2–0 in the city of Armenia. The best performance of the team in the top tier was achieved in the 2017 season. In the Torneo Apertura, the team placed 5th, thus qualifying for the knockout stage for the first time ever.

A former field technician for Verizon Ortiz is the subject of The Audacity of Louis Ortiz, a Kickstarter-financed documentary produced and directed by Ryan Murdock.He also played several background characters in the Star Trek franchise and only had one credited appearance in Trek as a Klingon warrior. Career beginnings In August 2008, Ortiz was unemployed, collecting worker's compensation, and playing in pool tournaments for money. Friends jokingly told Ortiz that his picture was on the front page of the New York Daily News. When Ortiz looked at the newspaper he failed to see the resemblance. Ortiz went to play pool at the Williamsbridge Tavern in the Bronx when Pat, his friend and bartender, noted the similarity to Obama. Ortiz, who had facial hair, still couldn't picture the similarity. While many people commented to Ortiz about his likeness to Obama, Pat was the first to mention and encourage Ortiz to use the likeness as a financial opportunity. Ortiz, who was unemployed for a year and in desperate need of money, was intrigued by the possibilities. He shaved his facial hair, and was dumbfounded by the similarity. Pat, who had some experience in modeling, helped Ortiz develop a plan to capitalize on his likeness to the Democratic presidential nominee. Ortiz managed to gather enough money for head shots and a new suit. With the help from friends at the bar, he contacted agents and sent resumes and head shots. He practiced his impersonation in the mirror for several weeks then decided it was time to make his first public appearance. September 21, 2008 was the date of the last game to be played at the old Yankee Stadium. Ortiz, costumed in his suit, ascended into the bleachers with several friends, many of whom were retired policemen who pretended they were escorting the actual Barack Obama. Ortiz said it wasn't long before he drew attention from the crowd and grabbed the attention of the audience. Career highlights Ortiz shot a documentary called The Audacity of Louis Ortiz. He contracted with a talent agency, William Gold Entertainment, that has increased his status. He was also on an episode of This American Life. He had a New York Times feature and a segment on The Jeff Probst Show on the CBS television channel.

Construction and commissioning Whitley was ordered as HMS Whitby on 9 December 1916 as part of the 10th Order of the 1916–1917 Naval Programme and was laid down by William Doxford & Sons at Sunderland in June 1917. When it was discovered that the name \\"Whitby\\" had mistakenly been written as \\"Whitley\\" when it was chosen for her, it was decided not to correct it, and she was launched as HMS Whitley, the first Royal Navy ship of the name, on 13 April 1918. She was completed on 11 October 1918, exactly one month before the conclusion of World War I, and commissioned on 14 October 1918. Service history 1918–1921 After acceptance trials and work-ups, Whitley deployed in 1919 to the Baltic Sea, where she served in the British campaign against Bolshevik forces during the Russian Civil War. She returned from the Baltic in 1920. In 1921, she was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Rosyth, Scotland, as part of the 9th Destroyer Flotilla. 1939–1940 In 1938, Whitley was selected for conversion to an anti-aircraft escort, and began conversion for her new role at Chatham Dockyard in August 1938. Her conversion was completed in October 1938 and, after 18 years in reserve, she was recommissioned in 1939. The United Kingdom entered World War II in September 1939, and that month Whitley was assigned to duty escorting convoys in the North Sea along the east coast of Great Britain, which she continued through April 1940. While escorting Convoy FN 12 from the Thames Estuary to the Forth Estuary on 12 January 1940, she assisted in driving off a German air attack. In May 1940, Whitley was transferred under the command of the Commander-in-Chief, Dover, and was placed at the disposal of the French Navy for operations in support of Allied ground operations in France and Belgium. She was thus engaged on 19 May 1940 when a German dive bomber attack badly damaged her two nautical miles (3.8 km) off Nieuwpoort, Belgium, forcing her to beach herself on the Belgian coast between Nieuwpoort and La Panne to avoid sinking. To prevent her capture by advancing German ground forces, the British destroyer destroyed her with gunfire at position , leaving her wreck on the bottom in only five meters (16.5 feet) of water.

Family  Edward Bechly (sometimes spelled Beckly or Bechley) was the second son of Freiderich August Bechly (1835–1916) and Lydia Marie Weesner (1850–1899).Findagrave Memorial for Edward Bechly His older brother Franklin Bechly was appointed 6th District Judge in 1927 by Iowa Governor Hammill.Iowa, Secretary of State, Official Register, p181, 1931 Edward married Ferne Smiley (1887–1968) in 1912 and they had three children.  Adventurer  \\"Captain\\" Bechly rafted the homemade houseboat \\"Ruin No. 13\\" down the Missouri and Mississippi River systems.The Iowa Alumnus, vol 5, p 137, 1907 Starting point in November 1907 with his first mate, Charles Bateman, was Sioux City, Iowa. The journey continued past St. Louis onto the Mississippi. The original destination was New Orleans, but the voyage ended in March 1908 near Mephis when Bechly learned via forwarded mail that a reporter job was waiting for him in Chicago.Breaking in, Edward Beckly, c1930 The sale of the boat generated funds sufficient to cover transportation expenses back to Chicago. The trip lasted four months and extended nearly 900 miles.  Career  After graduating with a Bachelor of Philosophy from Iowa State University, Bechly worked as a reporter for several local Midwest newspapers including The Muscatine Journal, the St. Joseph Gazette, the Des Moines Capital, the Des Moines Daily News, the Sioux City Tribune; and Chicago newspapers the Inter- Ocean, the Record-Herald, and the Chicago Tribune. While in Watseka, Illinois during March 1910, he accepted an opportunity to become editor of the Iroquios County Times-Democrat. Following his marriage to Ferne in 1912, he purchased the Times-Democrat and became its publisher.  Role in Ray Lamphere confession  In his 16-page narrative \\"Lanphere's Confession\\", using the pen name Edward Beckly, the author recounts his secret assignment from Walter Howey, City Editor of the Chicago Tribune to travel to Mount Pleasant, Iowa to meet with Iowa Wesleyan University president Edwin A Schell. His objective was to obtain exclusive access, for the Chicago Tribune, to the signed confession of Ray Lamphere who was central to the famous Belle Gunness serial murderess case. In 1908 farm hand Ray Lamphere was charged with murder and arson for the burning of the Gunness farm house, and on November 26, he was sentenced to a 20-year term at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, Indiana. While in prison, Lamphere called for Reverend Edwin Schell who was then minister of the Methodist church of LaPorte, Indiana. Realizing the importance, Reverend Schell recorded Lamphere's verbal confession on paper, had him sign it, and then sealed it and locked it in his personal safe. Ray Lamphere subsequently died in prison on December 30, 1909. Reporter Beckly took the first available train to Mount Pleasant, Iowa to meet with Edwin Schell. In the president's office, he tried to convey why it was vitally important to release the information held within the confession of Ray Lamphere. President Schell's counter argument was that a confession made to a minister is a sacred and privileged communication, and that the document must remain in safekeeping. With that said the meeting ended, but the president asked Beckly to return after lunch to meet again. When Beckly returned Schell informed him that he had sent a telegram to Bishop William Fraser McDowell requesting guidance on the matter, and to stay local until the response arrived. The following day the telegram response from the Bishop was to 'use personal judgement'. President Schell called for Beckly and agreed to provide the confession document which was locked in his safe at home. At the president's residence, Schell's wife became aware of the purpose of the visit and refused to allow the document to be released stating that 'this would not be right with the church'. Reporter Beckly took the first available train back to Chicago empty- handed.Minister Guards Lamphere Secret, Chicago Tribune, Jan 4, 1910, p.7 The following Thursday (January 13, 1910), the St. Louis Post-Dispatch issued a feature story regarding the Gunness Farm murders, and offered speculation regarding the confession of Ray Lamphere.Confession Clears the Gunness Mystery, St' Louis Post Dispatch, Jan 13, 1910, p.1-2 City Editor Howey sent reporter Beckly back to Mount Pleasant to try again with President Schell. In the president's office, Schell was more receptive to using the confession as a way to clear the nationwide speculation that was causing strain for the family members of the victims, but he still feared bringing discredit to the Methodist Church. Schell asked Beckly to meet him later in the day at his residence. At that meeting, reporter Beckly was presented with two envelopes. The first contained the signed and sealed confession of Ray Lamphere. The second contained a statement from Edwin Schell as to why the confession was being released, which was to be published at the same time. Beckly wired the story to the Tribune at his first opportunity, and the return telegram came from Chicago Tribune legend, James Keeley, with the simple message \\"Good work\\".Lanphere's Confession, Edward Beckly, c1930 The Chicago Tribune subsequently published the feature story about Lamphere's confession, including President Schell's statement, on January 15, 1910.Dr. Schell Bares Lamphere Secret, Chicago Tribune, Jan 15, 1910, p.1-2  Notability  Edward Bechly gained notability early in his career as the Chicago Tribune reporter that broke the story of Ray Lamphere's confession in the famous Belle Gunness case.Ray Lamphere Confession to Clergyman Results in Arrest, New York Times, Jan 16, 1910 He gained regional notability as owner and publisher of the Iroquois County Times-Democrat from 1912 to about 1923.Illinois Newspaper Project Database He was also appointed representative of the 10th District of Indiana for the 1924 Presidential Electoral College.Indiana Electoral College, 1924 General Election  References   External links  * The Confession, by Shauana Williams, January 19, 1910 * Category:1874 births Category:1945 deaths Category: 20th-century American journalists Category:American editors Category:American publishers (people) ","title":"Edward Bechly"},{"id":"39124175","text":"Bahadorabad (, also Romanized as Bahādorābād and Bahador Abad; also known as Bahādorābād Bālā and Bahādorābād-e Bālā) is a village in Rudbar Rural District, in the Central District of Rudbar-e Jonubi County, Kerman Province, Iran.

Background Lake Tanganyika lies in the east of the Congo Basin. The slave and ivory trader Tippu Tip founded a private empire along the Upper Congo river to the west of the lake in the 1870s, sending his goods to Zanzibar for sale. Karema lay on one of the routes from the Congo to the east coast of Africa. The International African Association was created in September 1876, with King Leopold II of Belgium as its president, at the International Geographical Conference in Brussels. The Comité D'Études du Haut Congo was created on 25 November 1878 with the aim of opening up the huge Congo Basin to European exploitation. The Comité was a precursor of the Congo Free State, a private enterprise of King Leopold II. Belgian military station In 1879 Comité D'Études du Haut Congo occupied Karema, naming it Fort Leopold after King Leopold II of Belgium. In 1882 Captain Émile Storms took command of Karema from Lieutenant Jérôme Becker, whose term of service had expired. Yassagula, chief of the village of Karema, attacked the station soon after Storms arrived. Becker counterattacked with his askaris, put Yassagula's men to flight and destroyed the village. A few months later Yassagula submitted, and from then on was a reliable ally. Becker left the station on 17 November on his homeward journey. Storms strengthened and expanded the post, which was now called Fort Léopold, and started to grow vegetables. He responded to an attack on his couriers with an expedition that defeated the rebel chief on 23 April 1883. However, the German scientist Richard Böhm who accompanied Storms was struck by two bullets in the leg during this action and was laid up for several months. Storms then founded Mpala on the west shore of the lake, opposite Karema, laying the foundations on 4 May 1883. At the Berlin Conference (1884-1885) the east side of the lake was assigned to the German sphere of influence, including Karema. King Leopold II of Belgium decided to focus his colonizing efforts on the lower Congo. He asked Archbishop Charles Lavigerie, the founder of the White Fathers missionary society, if he would like to replace the Belgian agents by missionaries at the two stations on Lake Tanganyika. Lavigerie accepted. Mission The missionaries founded the village of Karema with five hundred redeemed slaves. They needed protection. A former Papal Zouave named Léopold Louis Joubert offered his services to Lavigerie, and this was accepted in a letter of 20 February 1886. Joubert reached Zanzibar on 14 June 1886, and reached the mission at Karema on 22 November 1886. He remained there for some months at the request of the Vicar Apostolic of Tanganyika, Mgr. Jean-Baptiste-Frézal Charbonnier, to protect the mission against attacks by slavers. He then crossed the lake to Mpala in March 1887. Charbonnier died at Karema on 16 March 1888 and Léonce Bridoux was asked to succeed him. Bridoux died on 20 October 1890. In 1889, Adrien Atiman arrived in Karema and became the mission's medical doctor, which he remained until 1956. The missionaries built a church in 1890 and in 1893 completed a fortified mission house, which is still standing. On 19 June 1891 Adolphe Lechaptois was appointed Bridoux's successor as Vicar Apostolic of Tanganyika and Titular Bishop of Utica. He made his base at Karema, which he reached on 8 September 1891. During the first part of the 20th century Lechaptois opened many schools, as well as five orphanages. The center at Karema became a junior seminary. Lechaptois died on 30 November 1917 at Karema. On 10 May 1946 the Apostolic Vicariate of Tanzania was renamed the Apostolic Vicariate of Karema, and on 25 March 1953 was promoted to become the Diocese of Karema. On 24 October 1969 it was renamed the Diocese of Sumbawanga, reflecting the transfer of headquarters to the growing city of Sumbawanga.  Recent years Today Karema is a fishing village. It may be reached by ferry. As of 2010 the ferry boat was the MV Liemba, formerly the Graf von Götzen, a 1,300 ton steamship that the Germans assembled on the lake in 1913 for use as an armed troop transport. The Catholic mission provides a guesthouse. From Karema there is transport by Land Rover to Mpanda, the district center.

On the same day the government released its manifest. It became the highest legislative, executive and administrative body of Soviet power in Ukraine as the Soviet Russia resumed hostilities. All-Ukrainian Central Military Revolutionary Committee Since July 1918 Bolsheviks were preparing the uprising against government of Pavlo Skoropadsky and to prevent reestablishment of the Central Council of Ukraine. At the Party Congress of the Communist Party of Ukraine that took place on July 5–12, 1918 in Moscow and adapted the party's resolution \\"About Armed Uprising\\", it was decided to create the All-Ukrainian Central Military-Revolutionary Committee (Milrevkom). The Milrevkom was located in Kursk and consisted from members of the Insurgency Bureau of the former Bolshevik government of Ukraine. Among its members were Andrei Bubnov (leader), Volodymyr Zatonsky, Vladimir Aussem, Yuri Kotsyubynsky, and Yuri Pyatakov. Eager to resume open hostilities on August 5, 1918 the Milrevkom issued erroneous Order No.1 about general uprising in Ukraine which was not yet prepared. Next month under direction of the Communist Party of Ukraine formed the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Soviet divisions. The strike force of the government became the two Ukrainian insurgent divisions that were created in August 1918 by the All-Ukrainian Central Military-Revolutionary Committee. In Soviet historiography the committee was categorized as a leading organ of fighting for freedom of working masses of Ukraine against the Austria-Germany occupation forces and the bourgeois-land owners regime of Hetman of Ukraine. The Central Military-Revolutionary Committee was created in July 1918 at the First Congress of the Communist Party of Ukraine that took place in Moscow. The leader of the committee was Andrei Bubnov. The committee was also in charge of underground revolutionary committees and partizan formations. On August 5, 1918 it issued its Order #1 About the nationwide uprising in Ukraine. The committee was dissolved already after four months in November 1918 when the Soviet forces established the Provisional Government of Ukraine. After annulment of the Treaty of Brest- Litovsk on November 17, 1918, the Sovnarkom of the Soviet Russia gave an order on organization of the Revolutionary Military Council at the Kursk Direction Army Group that included Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko, Volodymyr Zatonsky and Joseph Stalin, while the commander of the task force was Vladimir Antonov- Ovseyenko. After the creation of the government, Joseph Stalin in the military council was replaced by Fyodor Sergeyev. Provisional Government of Ukraine The main goal of the government was to accomplish the Socialist Revolution with the motto \\"All power to Soviets\\". On January 6, 1919 the government declared the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic. On January 16, 1919 the government fired its chairman Yuri Pyatakov and elected Fyodor Sergeyev as his successor. On January 28, 1919 the provisional government was replaced by the Council of People's Commissars represented by the First Rakovsky Government. The 3rd All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets (March 6–10, 1919) approved the new government as the Council of People's Commissars by adopting the Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR.

Career Francis began his acting career with London's National Youth Theatre. Outside of Britain, he pursued a variety of stage and film projects that took him back to the United States and eventually to Japan. A string of appearances on Japanese television led Francis to divide his time between Tokyo and his home in London. Notable work include the documentary film Kicking It. Narrated by Colin Farrell, the documentary premiered at Sundance Film Festival in 2008. The documentary allowed Francis to champion several social causes with which he is actively involved. The New York Times said that the film is \\"so earnest it hurts\\" in its treatment of homelessness and poverty. Francis ventured outside acting when he wrote and produced Bollocks, which premiered in Greece at the Peloponnesian International Film Festival in 2012. Charity work Outside of film and television, Francis is active with humanitarian causes. After the devastating 2010 Haiti earthquake, he led efforts to organise fundraising activities in Oxford.

The park opened in 1985 and operated until 2004. History Construction was underway as of October 1984, with plans to open the 27-acre park on May 1, 1985. The $12 million project was a joint venture between Howard Hughes Development Corporation – part of Summa Corporation – and San Diego-based Wet 'n' Wild. Howard Hughes Development Corporation conceived the project because of the potential to expand the local tourism market through family entertainment, and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority believed that the water park would appeal to families visiting Las Vegas. Howard Hughes Development Corporation chose a water park theme as the company did not want to compete against southern California's Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm theme parks, as many Las Vegas tourists were residents of southern California. The concept of a water park in Las Vegas was also considered ideal because of the city's dry and hot weather. The water park was located on the Las Vegas Strip, between the Sahara and El Rancho hotel-casinos. Wet 'n Wild opened on May 18, 1985, after $14 million was spent on construction. The park included three turbine engines capable of creating rolling four-foot waves in a 170-foot pool. The park also featured a 17,000-square-foot surf lagoon containing 500,000 gallons of water, ranging in depth from eight feet to two inches. The surf lagoon was a main attraction, as well as a 76-foot-high water slide known as the Der Stuka, located along Las Vegas Boulevard on the property's west end, south of the Sahara. Approximately 500,000 people were expected to visit the water park during its first year. By June 1986, park attendance had increased 19.7 percent from the previous year. A capsule known as the Bomb Bay was eventually added atop the Der Stuka. The Bomb Bay required people to push a button, which opened the floor beneath them, plummeting riders to the slide approximately 20 feet below. The Playboy Wet and Wild Bikini Fashion Show was held at the park in 2000 In 1993, the park was sued by Russell Beatty, a man who suffered temporary paralysis after his neck was broken in three areas. Beatty had been waiting for his son at the bottom of the Hydro Blaster water slide and was struck by a 275-pound man. Beatty alleged that lifeguards allowed the man to go down the slide too soon, resulting in the injury. The park was acquired by Universal Studios in October 1998, Ogden Corp in March 1999, Alfa SmartParks in March 2000, and Palace Entertainment on July 10, 2002. The park closed in 2004. Redevelopment plans In March 2007, Publishing and Broadcasting Limited and Christopher Milam announced plans to purchase the site for $1.2 billion. They intended to replace it with a mixed-use tower called the Crown Las Vegas.ReviewJournal.com - Business - Australian magnate to invest in LV casino The cost of the project was estimated to be $5 billion, and its original completion date was set for 2014. In March 2008, the project's cancellation was announced and the site was put up for sale. The idea of turning the abandoned site into a stadium began in 2010, when Milam revealed plans for the Silver State Arena. Milam's company International Development Management would get the 27-acre land from Sue Lowden and her husband Paul, and atop build a 20,000-seat stadium at the cost of $750 million, using about $9 million a year in redevelopment district taxes. The project stalled after Clark County rejected a proposal to fund 15% of the venue with public money and nearby residents opposed construction. In 2013, businessman Jackie Robinson, a former UNLV student and NBA player, announced that he was planning on using the same site of the proposed Silver State Arena to build the All Net Resort and Arena, a $1.4 billion privately funded complex encompassing an arena, hotel and shopping project that could attract an NBA franchise to Las Vegas. The arena itself would cost $670 million. The project was delayed from its initial date. As of late 2019, the project's sponsors claimed that funds were in hand and construction would be completed in three years.https://news3lv.com/news/local/robinson-says-massive- all-net-resort-and-arena-on-las-vegas-strip-still-on Notes External links *Official website (archived) Category:Defunct amusement parks in the United States Category:Tourist attractions in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Water parks in Nevada Category:Winchester, Nevada Category:1985 establishments in Nevada Category:2004 disestablishments in Nevada ","title":"Wet 'n Wild (Las Vegas)"},{"id":"39124471","text":"Kimberly LaGayle McCarthy (May 11, 1961 – June 26, 2013) was a death row inmate who was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1997 murder of her neighbor, 71-year-old retired college professor Dorothy Booth, in her Lancaster, Texas (Dallas–Fort Worth area) home during a robbery. She was also a suspect in the murders of two other elderly Texas women, for which she was never tried. After her final federal appeal was denied in July 2012, her execution date was set for January 29, 2013. Two reprieves pushed her execution date to June 26, 2013. McCarthy continued to proclaim her innocence, and stated that she was framed for murder. On June 26, 2013 McCarthy was executed by the state of Texas by lethal injection, becoming the 500th person to be executed by the state of Texas using that method.  Early life  McCarthy was born on May 11, 1961, in Greenville, Texas. She worked as an occupational therapist in a nursing home. She was briefly married to Aaron Michaels, with whom she had one son. During her adult life, she developed an addiction to crack cocaine. In 1990, she was convicted of forgery, and also had convictions for prostitution and theft of services.  Crime  On July 21, 1997, McCarthy reportedly called her neighbor, former El Centro College psychology professor Dorothy Booth (May 14, 1926 - July 21, 1997), saying that she was on her way over to borrow some sugar. Prosecutors later alleged that McCarthy's true intent was to rob Booth. After McCarthy arrived at Booth's home, she stabbed Booth five times with a butcher knife, beat her with a candelabrum, and cut off her finger to steal her diamond wedding ring. McCarthy then stole Booth's purse and Mercedes-Benz and pawned the diamond ring in order to buy crack cocaine. The day after Booth's murder, McCarthy was charged with murder. Evidence showed that McCarthy used Booth's credit cards at a liquor store and was in possession of Booth's driver's license. Booth's DNA was also found on the murder weapon, which police recovered from McCarthy's home. In 1998, McCarthy was convicted by a Dallas County, Texas jury of murdering Booth. During the sentencing hearing, prosecutors presented blood DNA evidence alleging that McCarthy also murdered two other elderly women in Dallas County in December 1988, 81-year-old Maggie Harding and 85-year-old Jettie Lucas, in order to purchase cocaine. McCarthy was never charged with those murders. On November 24, 1998, McCarthy was sentenced to die by lethal injection for killing Booth. McCarthy successfully appealed her conviction in 2002, but was later re-tried and re-sentenced to death on November 1, 2002.  Execution dates  Mountain View Unit, where McCarthy was held on death row McCarthy's final federal appeal was denied in July 2012. Her attorneys sent a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court, and it was denied in January 2013. Her execution date was initially set for January 29, 2013. Only hours before her lethal injection was scheduled to occur, she was granted a stay of execution. Her execution was next set for April 3, 2013. In late March, the Dallas County district attorney announced that the date had been moved to June 26, 2013. Death Huntsville Unit, where McCarthy was executed McCarthy was executed by lethal injection at the Huntsville Unit in Huntsville, Texas, on June 26, 2013. Her execution marked the 500th convicted killer to be executed by lethal injection in Texas (which averages one execution about every four weeks) since the death penalty resumed in the United States in 1976. She was 52 years old. She was pronounced dead at 6:37 p.m. CDT, 20 minutes after Texas prison officials began administering a single lethal dose of pentobarbital. McCarthy’s last words were \\"This is not a loss. This is a win. You know where I'm going. I'm going home to be with Jesus. Keep the faith. I love you all.\\" She was the first woman executed in the United States in almost three years.\\"Texas carries out 500th execution with Kimberly McCarthy\\", Associated Press at CBS News.

This is also defined as situations where both pressure forces and buoyant forces interact. How much each form of convection contributes to the heat transfer is largely determined by the flow, temperature, geometry, and orientation. The nature of the fluid is also influential, since the Grashof numer increases in a fluid as temperature increases, but is maximized at some point for a gas. Characterization Mixed convection problems are characterized by the Grashof number (for the natural convection) and the Reynolds number (for the forced convection). The relative effect of buoyancy on mixed convection can be expressed through the Richardson number: : \\\\mathrm{Ri}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{Gr}}{\\\\mathrm{Re}^2} The respective length scales for each dimensionless number must be chosen depending on the problem, e.g. a vertical length for the Grashof number and a horizontal scale for the Reynolds number. Small Richardson numbers characterize a flow dominated by forced convection. Richardson numbers higher than \\\\mathrm{Ri}\\\\approx 16 indicate that the flow problem is pure natural convection and the influence of forced convection can be neglected. Like for natural convection, the nature of a mixed convection flow is highly dependent on heat transfer (as buoyancy is one of the driving mechanisms) and turbulence effects play a significant role. Cases Because of the wide range of variables, hundreds of papers have been published for experiments involving various types of fluids and geometries. This variety makes a comprehensive correlation difficult to obtain, and when it is, it is usually for very limited cases. Combined forced and natural convection, however, can be generally described in one of three ways. Two- dimensional mixed convection with aiding flow The first case is when natural convection aids forced convection. This is seen when the buoyant motion is in the same direction as the forced motion, thus accelerating the boundary layer and enhancing the heat transfer. Transition to turbulence, however, can be delayed. An example of this would be a fan blowing upward on a hot plate. Since heat naturally rises, the air being forced upward over the plate adds to the heat transfer. Two-dimensional mixed convection with opposing flow The second case is when natural convection acts in the opposite way of the forced convection. Consider a fan forcing air upward over a cold plate. In this case, the buoyant force of the cold air naturally causes it to fall, but the air being forced upward opposes this natural motion. Depending on the Richardson number, the boundary layer at the cold plate exhibits a lower velocity than the free stream, or even accelerates in the opposite direction. This second mixed convection case therefore experiences strong shear in the boundary layer and quickly transitions into a turbulent flow state. Three-dimensional mixed convection The third case is referred to as three-dimensional mixed convection. This flow occurs when the buoyant motion acts perpendicular to the forced motion. An example of this case is a hot, vertical flate plate with a horizontal flow, e.g. the surface of a solar thermal central receiver. While the free stream continues its motion along the imposed direction, the boundary layer at the plate accelerates in the upward direction. In this flow case, buoyancy plays a major role in the laminar-turbulent transition, while the imposed velocity can suppress turbulence (laminarization) Calculation of total heat transfer Simply adding or subtracting the heat transfer coefficients for forced and natural convection will yield inaccurate results for mixed convection. Also, as the influence of buoyancy on the heat transfer sometimes even exceeds the influence of the free stream, mixed convection should not be treated as pure forced convection. Consequently, problem-specific correlations are required. Experimental data has suggested that : \\\\mathrm{Nu}=(\\\\mathrm{Nu}_\\\\mathrm{forced}^n + \\\\mathrm{Nu}_\\\\mathrm{natural}^n)^{1/n} can describe the area-averaged heat transfer. Applications Combined forced and natural convection is often seen in very-high-power-output devices where the forced convection is not enough to dissipate all of the heat necessary. At this point, combining natural convection with forced convection will often deliver the desired results. Examples of these processes are nuclear reactor technology and some aspects of electronic cooling.

The annual Guerra del Golfo main event consists of three matches in total, with two \\"qualifying matches\\", multi-man steel cage matches where the last person left in the cage advances to the main event of the night. The two losers is forced to wrestle inside the steel cage, with the loser being forced to either take off their wrestling mask or have their hair shaved off under Lucha de Apuesta, or \\"Bet match\\" rules. Production Background Starting as far back as at least 2000, the Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revolución in Spanish) has held several annual events where the main event was a multi-man steel cage match where the last wrestler left in the cage would be forced to either remove their wrestling mask or have their hair shaved off under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", rules. From 2005 IWRG has promoted a spring time show promoting the steel cage match concept under the name Guerra del Golfo, or \\"Gulf War\\", referring to the Gulf of Mexico, not the Gulf War in the middle east. The Gurerra del Golfo shows featured two \\"qualifying\\" steel cage matches where the loser would later be forced to face off against each other in the main event of the show, a final cage match where the loser would be forced to either unmask or have his/her hair shaved off. The use of the steel cage in three matches distinguishes the Guerra del Golfo event from other Steel cage matches held throughout the year such as the IWRG El Castillo del Terror (\\"The Tower of Terror\\"), IWRG Guerra de Sexos (\\"War of the Sexes\\") or IWRG Prison Fatal (\\"Deadly Prison\\") shows. The Guerra del Golfo shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2013 Castillo del Terror show was the seventh year IWRG promoted a show under that name and the sixth year in a row since becoming an annual event from 2008 forward. Storylines The event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (técnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension- building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The Main Event was a 12-Man Steel Cage Match. The last two wrestlers who remained in the ring fought one on one in a Lucha de Apuestas Match (\\"Bet match\\"), wagering their mask on the outcome of the match. The event included wrestlers from International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) as well as a number of Mexican freelance wrestlers. IWRG announced 16 participants for the annual Guerra del Golfo (\\"Gulf War\\", referring to the Gulf of Mexico, not the middle eastern wars.) on April 14, 2018. IWRG regulars El Ángel, Carta Brava, Jr., Danny Casas, Chico Che, Dinamic Black, Apolo Estrada, Jr., Eterno, Factor, Mosco X-Fly, Oficial 911, Trauma I, Trauma II and Veneno were all included in the match. The Guerro del Golfo event would also include Dragon Gate trainees Eita and Tomahawk and lone AAA representative Toscano rounded out the match. In the annual Guerra del Golfo wrestlers face off in Steel cage matches with the loser of the first two steel cage matches being forced to fight each other in the final match of the night. The losing wrestler in the final would be forced to either unmask (if masked) or have their hair shaved off (if not masked) under the Lucha libre rules of a Lucha de Apuesta, or \\"Bet match\\". Carta Brava, Jr., Dinamic Black, Trauma I and Trauma II were all masked going into the match while the other 12 competitors were putting their hair on the line. The first \\"loser advances\\" steel cage match would include Toscano, Mosco X-Fly, Oficial 911, El Ángel, Veneno, Apolo Estrada, Jr., Tomahawk and Trauma II, while the second \\"loser advances\\" match included Factor, Carta Brava, Jr., Chico Che, Eterno, Dinamic Black, Eita, Trauma I and Danny Casas. The first two cage matches would be contested under \\"escape\\" rules, which meant that a wrestler would be eliminated when that person was able to climb up the cage and put at least one leg over the top. The last person in the ring would be deemed the loser and would have to compete in a match where pinfalls and submissions would also win the match. In past IWRG steel cage matches under similar stipulations wrestlers not officially announced in the match have interfered, climbed in the cage to help someone or attack someone. This interference made the unannounced wrestlers eligible for the \\"loser advances\\" stipulation as well. The most blatant case of this scenario came at the 2012 Guerra del Golfo event where the final match turned from a one on one match to a three on three match involving all three members of Los Oficiales and all three members of Los Oficiales Elite who were involved in a long running storyline at the time. Event IWRG replaced Picudo, Jr. and Spartan with Eita and Tomahawk in the second match. Tomahawak was removed from the Steel Cage Match by Spartan while Eita worked two matches on the same show.

The house was purchased by Aaron Jackson, the founder of nonprofit organization Planting Peace, after he saw a \\"for sale\\" sign on a nearby house when looking at the community on Google Earth. He had the house painted in the colors of the rainbow flag, to show support for LGBTQ rights. History Through Planting Peace, Jackson purchased the house for $81,000. In March 2013, a military veteran agreed to paint the house the colors of the rainbow flag in tribute to the gay pride flag, and it was dubbed the Equality House. It was reported that a representative of Westboro said she loved the paint job because it kept the eyes of the earth on the church's message. The house became a place for volunteers of Planting Peace to live. In 2016, the house also became the organization's main office; in September of 2018, the house ceased to be the headquarters and the interior is no longer open to visitors. Visitors are still always welcome to take pictures on the property. Equality House Events In June 2013, a five-year-old girl set up a lemonade stand selling \\"Pink Lemonade for Peace\\" outside the Equality House in order to oppose the church's message of hate by raising money for love and peace. Westboro members attempted to stop the event by calling the police and yelling profanities. Her $1 \\"suggested donation\\" raised $400 on site as well as an additional $1000 through an online campaign through the website CrowdRise. The money raised went to Planting Peace. The campaign raised $30,000 by September 2014. Later that same month, a gay wedding was held on the lawn of the Equality House to mark the occasion of the ruling of two historic Supreme Court cases involving LGBT marriage. A lesbian couple from Alabama was married by an ordained Baptist minister who was executive director of the Association of Welcoming and Affirming Baptists, in front of 100 people including well- wishers from the community. Most of the wedding expenses were covered by local businesses and community members. In October 2013, the organization staged its first drag show at its Equality House called \\"Drag Down Bigotry\\", a fundraiser for anti-bullying programs aimed to limit suicide among LGBT youth. The house had its first open house in March 2014. To mark the anniversary of the occasion, Equality House held a day-long party including a tour of the facility featuring \\"Legacy Project,\\" an exhibition with memorabilia and stories or contributions of the LGBT community. There was a group photo called \\"Plant one for Peace\\" featuring couples exchanging a kiss to express compassion. A staged \\"wedding\\" between wizards Gandalf and Dumbledore was held outside the house in June 2015. The event was funded by a Crowdrise campaign after Westboro tweeted that they would picket if such a union was to take place. In October 2016, the Equality House was vandalized with homophobic slurs and seven bullet holes were found in the exterior. The graffiti and bullet holes were kept in place, and visitors to the house are encouraged to write messages of love on the vandalized wall. Equality House is intended to stand as a visible symbol of love and has not taken part in community works since the wizard wedding in 2015. Mott House (Transgender House) Mott House Prior to 2016, the Equality House's rainbow exterior was painted over with the pink, white and blue colors of the transgender flag in honor of the Transgender Day of Remembrance. When 8-year-old Avery Jackson (no relation to Aaron Jackson) visited the Equality House while it was painted with the transgender flag, she was inspired to raise money with Equality House to open a permanent Transgender House. The crowdfunding campaign raised almost $2,000 in three hours; the majority of funding was provided by Martin Dunn, President of the Dunn Development Corp, saying, \\"if I had a kid that was transgender I would want a place that would celebrate them and accept them. That’s just not available in this country and it should be.\\" Aaron Jackson, founder of Equality House said that the Transgender House intends to serve as an additional symbol of hope for the LGBT community. The Transgender House, next door to the Equality House, was painted and dedicated on June 26, 2016 ; since the Equality House and Transgender House do not take part in community works, Jackson donated the use of the house to Capital City Equality Center in July 2017. On March 8, 2019, it was renamed Mott House after the sudden death of Stephanie Mott, one of Kansas' most influential transgender activists.

The Munro scholarships and studentships at Queens' College, Cambridge are named in his honour. Early life Andrew Munro was born 6 July 1869, in Rosskeen, Ross and Cromarty, Scotland, the son of Andrew Munro and Margaret Small of Invergordon in Ross and Cromarty. His father was a banker, mill owner and farmer, who also served as Chief Magistrate for Invergordon and Justice of the Peace for Ross and Cromarty. The Munros were members of the Clan Munro. His mother was the daughter of John Small (1797–1847), under Librarian of the University of Edinburgh, and the sister of John Small (1828–1886), who succeeded his father as under Librarian and later was appointed Librarian. Munro's mother and family were members of the Smalls of Dirnanean, Perthshire, Scotland. Academics Munro initially attended Aberdeen University, Scotland, later transferring to Cambridge. He won a foundation scholarship to Queens' College, Cambridge in 1890, and two years later was designated as the fourth Wrangler. In 1892, Munro received his Bachelor of Arts degree, followed by a Masters of Arts degree in 1896. In 1893, he was elected a Fellow at Queens' College, Cambridge. For the next 20 years he served as a lecturer, director of studies, and supervisor in mathematics at the college. In 1913, Munro became Bursar of Queens' College, Cambridge. In this role, Munro advised the college to dispose of most of its farmland after World War I and invest in government stocks, which significantly increased the college's endowments. Legacy Andrew Munro died on 1 July 1935 at Dormy House Hotel in Sheringham, Norfolk, England. He was buried in St. Giles Cemetery in Cambridge, now referred to as Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground, on 4 July 1935. A portion of Munro's estate, upwards of £26,000, was left to Queens' College, Cambridge to fund scholarships in mathematics and physics. These scholarships and studentships are named in Munro's honour. The Munro Room at Queens' College, Cambridge which faces both Old Court and Walnut Tree Court, is named for Munro.

But by the late nineteenth century, the word would have conjured up specifically the old Théâtre des Funambules, where Jean-Gaspard Deburau forged his career (see next section).—was a Parisian theatrical society that produced pantomimes inspired by the Commedia dell'Arte, particularly by the exploits of its French Pierrot. It included among its approximately one hundred and fifty subscriber-members such notables in the arts as the novelist J.-K. Huysmans, the composer Jules Massenet, the illustrator Jules Chéret, and the actor Coquelin cadet. Among its successes was L'Enfant prodigue (1890), which was filmed twice, first in 1907, then in 1916, making history as the first European feature-length movie and the first complete stage-play on film.

From about 1825 to 1860, the theater-goers of Paris were witness to a Golden Age of Pantomime. At the Théâtre des Funambules, Jean-Gaspard Deburau, called by the eminent poet and journalist Théophile Gautier \\"the most perfect actor who ever lived\\",In La Presse, January 25, 1847; tr. Storey (1985), p 111. created, in his celebrated mute Pierrot, a legendary, almost mythic figure, immortalized by Jean-Louis Barrault in Marcel Carné's film Children of Paradise (1945).Deburau reigned as the star of the Funambules from about 1825 to his death in 1846; on his pantomime, see Storey (1985), pp. 3-35. After his death, his son Charles, playing at the same theater, revived for the grateful enthusiasts of the genre his father's agility and gaity;His tenure at the theater was, however, short-lived: he left it in 1855 (see Hugounet [1889], p. 107). and Charles's rival Paul Legrand, who reinvented Pierrot as the sensitive soul so familiar to post-nineteenth-century devotees of the figure, earned warm admiration from his public (including Gautier) for his performances at the Folies-Nouvelles.He débuted at the Funambules in the same year, 1847, as Deburau fils, who soon saw him as a rival. Legrand left for the Folies-Nouvelles in 1853, where he performed until 1859. For a detailed account of his career, see Storey (1985), pp. 37-71, 304-305. But, by the early 1860s, interest in the pantomime, at least in the capital, had begun to flag, and both Legrand and Deburau fils had to seek out audiences elsewhere. Deburau died young, in 1873, having taken his art to Marseille and Bordeaux, where he founded a so-called school of pantomime.On the founding of this school, see the section devoted to Charles Deburau in Hugounet (1889), and also Séverin, pp. 36ff. Legrand, after working in Bordeaux and abroad, found employment in the 1870s at the Tertulia, a Parisian café-concert, and in the late 1880s, at the end of his career, at a children's theater, the Théâtre- Vivienne.See Storey (1985), pp. 71, 304-305. Both venues represented a considerable step down from the Folies-Nouvelles. One of the historians of French pantomime, Robert Storey, writes that Legrand, in these years, \\"seems to have been forgotten by his public, the pantomime itself suffering death- throes at the capital while struggling for rebirth in the south of France.\\"Storey (1985), p. 71. When the mime made an appearance, around 1880, in a pantomime at the Variétés, he struck Paul and Victor Margueritte, rare admirers of his art, as \\"a survivor of a quite distant epoch.\\"Quoted in Storey (1985), p. 181. It would be the self-assumed task of one of those brothers, Paul Margueritte, to revive the pantomime. In 1882, Paul sent his just- published Pierrot assassin de sa femme (Pierrot, Murderer of His Wife), a pantomime he had devised the previous year for the audiences of his amateur theatricals in Valvins, to several writers, hoping to renew interest in the genre.Paul Margueritte, p. 77. It apparently found a receptive spirit in Jean Richepin, whose Pierrot assassin, also a pantomime, appeared at the Trocadéro in 1883.Storey (1985), p. 283. (It would hardly go unnoticed: Sarah Bernhardt was its titular Pierrot.) And other forces were at work to promote the pantomime with the general public. In 1879, the Hanlon-Lees, a troupe of English acrobatic mimes, had performed to great acclaim at the Folies-Bergère, inspiring J.-K. Huysmans, the Naturalistic novelist and future creator of the arch-aesthete Des Esseintes, to collaborate on a pantomime with his friend Léon Hennique.O.R. Morgan, \\"Huysmans, Hennique et 'Pierrot sceptique'\\", Bulletin de la Société J.-K. Huysmans, No. 46 (1963), 103; cited in Storey (1985), pp. 217-218. Their Pierrot sceptique (Pierrot the Skeptic, 1881) presented its readers with a dandified Pierrot even more savage than Margueritte's or Richepin's assassin: for he not only murders his tailor and executes a mannikin he has lured to his chambers, but also sets fire to the rooms themselves to obliterate all evidence of his crimes.A fairly detailed synopsis in English can be found in Storey (1985), pp. 219-221. Such waggish ferocity delighted the young Jules Laforgue, who, upon reading the pantomime, produced his own Pierrot fumiste (Pierrot the Cut-up, 1882), in which Pierrot is guilty of similar (if not homicidal) enormities.See Storey (1978), pp. 145, 154. While these writers were refining an art that elevated Pierrot to criminal heights, others were imagining a pantomime animated by a much more conventional Pierrot. The Petit Traité de pantomime à l'usage des gens du monde (1887), by the mime and scenarist Raoul de Najac, championed the pantomime as a recreation for the salons—and reminded its readers that, in devising such an entertainment, \\"One must ... not forget that one is in good company.\\"Najac (1887), p. 27; tr. Storey (1985), p. 290. Najac's ideal Pierrot, consequently, is innocent of all \\"indecent or funereal ideas,\\" like those that motivate Pierrot sceptique. Such also had been the pure-hearted Pierrot of Legrand, a collection of whose pantomimes was published—in the same year as Najac's treatise—by two fraternal men of the theater, Eugène and Félix Larcher.Félix was at the time a drama critic; Eugène was the director of the Théâtre de la Renaissance: see Storey (1985), p. 285. In undertaking their collaboration, the Larchers discovered talents and ambitions in themselves, vis-à-vis the pantomime, that neither knew he possessed. Eugène, in incarnating the Pierrot of one of Legrand's pantomimes, Le Papillon (The Butterfly), found that he was a more-than-competent mime, and Félix was inspired by his brother's performance to conceive the Cercle Funambulesque.Storey (1985), p. 286. Founding, statutes, and first productions Through friendships and professional contacts, Félix was introduced to Najac, Paul Margueritte, and Fernand Beissier, a colleague of Margueritte's who had written the preface for Pierrot assassin de sa femme.For a detailed account of the founding of the Cercle, see Storey (1985), pp. 285-286. He persuaded them to join him as founding members of the Cercle and drew up the goals of the society. Paul Hugounet, whom Storey calls the \\"most energetic publicist and chronicler\\" of the Cercle,Storey (1985), p. 288. summarized those goals in his Mimes et Pierrots of 1889: > 1\\\\. To revive the classical pantomime [i.e., the pantomimes of the Deburaux > and their successors]. > 2\\\\. To encourage the development of the modern pantomime by providing > authors and musical composers the opportunity of producing publicly their > works in this genre, whatever the artistic tendencies of those works may be. > 3\\\\. To return to the stage the parades and farces of the old Théâtre de la > Foire, as well as the works known as improvised comedies. > 4\\\\. To present the plays of the Comédie-Italienne. > 5\\\\. To stage, eventually, new comedies, in verse or in prose, on the formal > condition that these works have some express relationship, in their general > makeup, to the old Italian comedies or the Commedia dell'Arte.Hugounet > (1889), p. 238. The Cercle grew rapidly. By the time of its first constitutive assembly in February 1888, it boasted seventy-five members, including many of the leading celebrities of the day, among them actors (Paul Legrand, Coquelin cadet), playwrights (Jules Lemaître, Jacques Normand, Paul Eudel, Félix Galipaux), novelists (Champfleury, J.-K. Huysmans, Léon Hennique, Jean Richepin), painters (Jules Chéret, Jules Garnier), composers (Jules Massenet, Francis Thomé), and critics and historians of the theater (Léopold Lacour, Arthur Pougin, Edouard Stoullig).Hugounet (1889), pp. 238-239. Its first evening of performances, in May 1888, at a small concert hall at 42, rue de Rochechouart,Hugounet (1889), p. 239; Levillain, p. 278. consisted of a prologue with verses by Jacques Normand accompanied by the miming of Paul Legrand; a pantomime, Colombine pardonée (Columbine Pardoned), written by Paul Margueritte and Beissier, its Pierrot mimed by Paul himself; Najac's pantomime L'Amour de l'art (The Love of Art), with Eugène Larcher as Harlequin; and a parade of the boulevards, Léandre Ambassadeur (Ambassador Leander), starring Félicia Mallet, who would later create memorable Pierrots for the Cercle.Hugounet (1889), pp. 241-242.Storey (1985) notes that a scene from the théâtre-italien of Jean-François Regnard, Arlequin Barbier (Harlequin-Barber), \\"was announced on the program for the first soirée, but the reviews make it clear that the piece was omitted\\" (p. 287, n. 11). Almost all subsequent performances would be held at the small Théâtre d'Application, later called La Bodinière.Hugounet (1889), p. 239. Dissentions, defections, and \\"the Wagnerian tradition\\" As Tristan Rémy has pointed out, \\"each of the promoters\\"—that is, the founders of the Cercle— \\"had personal projects, projects that were disparate, that were even opposed to one another\\".Rémy (1954), p. 212; tr. Storey (1978), p. 120. Margueritte was doubtful that any \\"society\\", such as the Cercle aspired to be, could appreciate the kinds of pantomime that he had written or wished to write. His ideal was what he called the \\"Théâtre-Impossible\\": > On the elastic boards of a house with scenery painted by the most fervid > colorists and pervaded by strains of the \\"enervating and caressing\\" music of > the most suave musicians, it would charm me if, for the amusement of a few > simple—or very complicated—souls, there could be presented the prodigious > and tragicomic farces of life, love, and death, written exclusively by > authors who had no connection whatsoever with the Society of Men of > Letters.Paul Margueritte, \\"Eloge de Pierrot\\", La Lecture, February 25, 1891; > tr. Storey (1985), p. 291. Najac, on the other hand, was repulsed by Margueritte's criminal Pierrot and offended when the Cercle turned his pantomime Barbe-Bluette (Pink-Beard, 1889) into an \\"old melodrama rejuvenated by indecent innuendoes.\\"Najac (1909), p. 38; tr. Storey (1985), p. 290. And, like Margueritte, he \\"had wanted,\\" as Storey observes, \\"a close circle of associates, committed to the pantomime in a spirit of comradeship\\".Storey (1985), p. 287. The Larchers had grander plans: as Félix told Paul Hugounet, \\"we wanted—still while preserving the Cercle form, such as I had sketched out in the statutes—to approximate a theatrical organization, which, in our opinion, had the only chance of succeeding.\\"Paul Hugounet, \\"Comment fut fondé le Cercle Funambulesque\\", La Plume, IV (September 15, 1892), 407; tr. Storey (1985), p. 287. The Larchers' model was the Théâtre-Libre of Antoine—\\"with this difference: we resisted the intervention of amateur actors.\\" Their ambitions went farther: the \\"conventional and unintelligible gestures of the old pantomime\\" were to be suppressed; the music was to follow closely the business on stage, putting \\"the utterance of the gesture into the orchestra\\"; in short, \\"the best theories of Wagner\\" were to be applied to the pantomime.Paul Hugounet, \\"Comment fut fondé le Cercle Funambulesque\\", La Plume, IV (September 15, 1892), 406; tr. Storey (1985), p. 287. Hugounet later even went so far as to interview the composers of the Cercle on their response to \\"the Wagnerian tradition.\\"Hugounet (1892), p. 51. The upshot was predictable: Margueritte and Najac withdrew from the Cercle, and Margueritte's friend Beissier followed suit.See Storey (1985), pp. 290-291. The result was an organization that was very different from what they had imagined: the Cercle strove to please its public—while encouraging its authors to embrace what was then the theatrical vanguard. As such, it would seem to its critics both au-courant and anodyne. Implementation of statutes: impact of reformist tendencies and censorship As Larcher's words and especially his allusion to Wagner suggest, his focus was almost exclusively upon the pantomime, and his chief intention was to persuade the Cercle to \\"modernize\\" it. Hougunet seems to have been eager to push the pantomimic envelope, but his work proved problematic. On the one hand, there was the threat of unintelligibility, to which his pantomime La Fin de Pierrot (Pierrot's End, 1891) appears to have succumbed. Here, true to the ideals of the avant-garde Symbolists, Pierrot is urged by Hermonthis, a kind of Salomé à la Gustave Moreau, to renounce the pleasures of the senses—all nourishment, love, and even life itself. He does so and is granted the \\"treasure of his dreams\\".Hugounet (1891), p. 32. Even the reviewer of La Plume, usually an ally of the Symbolists, could not make sense of the piece.\\"In this work, at least,\\" wrote Georges Roussel, \\"there is an idea. I must admit that I could not grasp it. But a friend assured me that it was very interesting\\": \\"Critique dramatique\\", La Plume, III (May 1, 1891), 156; tr. Storey (1985), p. 289. On the other hand, there was intelligible pantomimic territory into which the authors of the Cercle could not trespass. In expanding its membership far beyond the \\"close circle of associates\\" desired by their fellow-founders, the Larchers, perhaps inadvertently, ensured that mass opinion and mass taste ruled. The result was, inevitably, censorship, which meant that not radical modernity but a certain mediocrity prevailed. When, for example, a jealous Pierrot disguised in a cassock sneaked into the priest's side of the confessional in Pierrot confesseur (Pierrot-Confessor, 1892), a piece by Galipaux and Pontsevrez, what Hugounet called the \\"terrible representatives of the Censorship of the Cercle\\" appointed two auditors to make cuts in the libretto and so stave off potential offense.Larcher and Hugounet, pp. 113-114. The final curtain of Hugounet's own Doctoresse! (1890)Written in collaboration with G. Villeneuve. finds physician Isabelle (like Hermonthis, a femme fatale), who has already been guilty of strangling a canary, plotting the dissection of her unfaithful husband. Although this ending, as Félix Larcher recalled, \\"pleased some by its very boldness\\", > ... the majority of us thought it impossible on the stage. On one point > everyone was in agreement: the murder of the bird, an act of coldblooded > cruelty, rendered Isabelle utterly odious.The distance between the > pantomimes of the Cercle and those of Paul Margueritte may be gauged by > comparing these remarks with a scene from Margueritte's Au cou du chat (At > the Cat's Neck). Columbine has forced one of her bracelets over her pet > cat's head, and, when it cannot be removed from its neck, her lover > Harlequin picks up a cleaver: \\"The cat's head comes off like a champagne > cork, and the bracelet, thrown up around a crimson fountain, goes rolling > into the bloody grass.\\" Columbine then wipes off the bracelet on the > \\"immaculate\\" blouse of the horrified bystander (and husband), Pierrot. The > pantomime appears in Paul [and Victor] Margueritte; the quotations are > translations by Storey (1985), p. 262. The author yielded easily: he even > admitted the possibility of another dénouement and, at the following > meeting, he brought us the one that ends the play today.Larcher and > Hugounet, p. 20; tr. Storey (1985), p. 289. The new version ends as a comedy: the husband and his lover, Columbine, having expired in a suicide pact, are brought back to life by one of Isabelle's electrical machines, and, as they stagger about like robots, the doctoresse reveals her new shingle: Resurrections My Specialty.See the plot-summary in Storey (1985), p. 289. \\"The reforms of the Cercle\\", writes Robert Storey, \\"were in fact very timid reforms. Pathos was permissible—was, indeed, encouraged—but rarely cruelty or irreverence.\\"Storey (1985), p. 289. And obscenity, of course, was out of the question. This helps, in part, to explain the Cercle's ignoring two of its own statutes. The Pierrot of Jean-Gaspard Deburau often flirted with the obscene,See Storey (1985), p. 24, n. 66. and the Gilles of the boulevard parades fully reveled in it.See Storey (1978), pp. 79-80. It is not, therefore, surprising that, during the ten years of the Cercle's existence, it produced only one \\"classical\\" pantomime (J.-G. Deburau's Pierrot Coiffeur)It appears as the opening pantomime in the Goby collection. Hugounet (1889) ascribes the authorship of the pantomime to J.-G. Deburau (p. 242), but Storey (1985) notes that the Goby collection represents Charles's pantomimes (i.e., his somewhat sanitized versions of his father's pieces) much more accurately than Jean-Gaspard's originals (p. 11. n. 25). and only one parade, Léandre Ambassadeur,Appearing originally in Volume III of the anonymously published Théâtre des Boulevards of 1756, the parade is reprinted, with notes and commentary, in Spielmann and Polanz. on its second and first evening of performances respectively, \\"when the statutes were being conscientiously observed.\\" And, despite their explicit inclusion in the statutes, no plays from the Théâtre de la Foire or the Comédie-Italienne were mounted: the theater of the past was shouldered aside by \\"the Wagnerian tradition\\". \\"Modernity\\" reigned, in other words—but it was modernity of a rather pallid kind. \\"The Cercle\\", writes Storey, \\"was, despite its intentions, the very triumph of banality.\\"Storey (1985), p. 291. He summarizes the plots of several of its pantomimes: > Pierrot loses his fiancée when his \\"art\\"—of thievery—inspires him to > reckless heights (Najac's L'Amour de l'art [1888]); he botches his own > suicide and then, stuffing the noose in his pocket for luck, is emboldened > to court Colombine ([Fernand] Boussenot's La Corde de pendu [1892]); he > plays out a dream of heroic exploit that leads alla gloria militar ([Henri] > Ferdal's La Rève du conscrit [1892]). ... Sometimes his drama has a > hackneyed lesson to teach: Woman is fickle (Camille de Saint-Croix's Blanc > et noir [1888]); Earth's the right place for love (Beissier's La Lune > [1889]). ... Sometimes it is tearful, in the manner of the old-fashioned > comédie-larmoyante....Storey (1985), pp. 291-292. The titles may be > translated, respectively, as The Love of Art, The Hanged Man's Rope, The > Conscript's Dream (\\"alla gloria militar\\" [It. \\"to military glory\\"] is a > quotation from the aria Non più andrai at the end of the first act of > Mozart's Marriage of Figaro), White and Black (\\"Woman is fickle\\" is an > allusion to the famous canzone La donna è mobile from the beginning of the > third act of Verdi's Rigoletto), and The Moon (\\"Earth's the right place for > love\\" is a quotation from \\"Birches\\" by Robert Frost). Notable achievements Although the Cercle left behind no enduring monuments of the theater, it provided a stage, orchestra, and audience to thirty-nine authors who, over the course of fourteen evenings of production, presented sixty-five playlets performed by and before (along with the paying public) its some hundred and fifty members.Rémy (1954), p. 212. It even had significant successes, producing pantomimes that moved to stages outside the Bodinière and even outside the country. One of the most notable of these was L'Enfant prodigue (Pierrot the Prodigal, 1890) by Michel Carré fils, in which a provincial Pierrot, seeking his fortunes in Paris, is disabused of his illusions by the decadence of the city and of his mistress, the faithless Phrynette; he returns to his home, a prodigal, to beg the forgiveness of Mère and Père Pierrot.Storey (1985) gives a detailed synopsis (pp. 292-293). Not only did the panto find audiences in London, at the Prince of Wales Theatre in 1891, and in New York, at the Booth Theatre in 1916, but it was revived in Paris in various commercial theaters well into the late 1920s.Storey (1985), p. 292, n. 23. (Laurette Taylor starred in a New York revival in 1925.)Levillain, p. 519. It was, moreover, instrumental in offering a footing to the fledgling art of film: Carré directed the first celluloid version in 1907. Featuring the mime Georges Wague as Père Pierrot, it premièred as the first European feature-length film and the first uncut stage-play on screen.See Rémy (1964), pp. 122-123. His dating of the film to 1906 is an error (repeated by Storey [1985], p. 292, n. 23). The Cercle opened up other avenues, as well. It both welcomed the work of mimes outside Paris, such as that of Hacks from Marseille and Mourès from Bordeaux,Hugounet (1889), p. 245. and allowed female mimes the freedom to assume male roles: Félicia Mallet, \\"the brightest star of the Cercle\\", was the prodigal of L'Enfant prodigue.Storey (1985), pp. 286, 292. On female mimes in late-19th-century French pantomime, see especially Rolfe, pp. 149-53. Finally, it brought to the fore the possibilities of \\"modern\\" pantomime, sometimes arguing, through articles in the press or lectures given under the auspices of the Cercle, that the genre should dispense with its ties to the Commedia dell'Arte and venture into \\"realistic\\" territory.See Storey (1985), pp. 296-297, 310-311. (As early as 1889, the pantomime Lysic by Eugène Larcher had entertained the Cercle audience with a provincial maid's misadventures in Paris.)Storey (1985), p. 297. Thus did the work of the Cercle anticipate such twentieth-century creations as Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp, Jacques Tati's Monsieur Hulot, Red Skelton's Freddie the Freeloader, and Jackie Gleason's Poor Soul.

Category:Theatre in France Category:19th-century theatre Category:Commedia dell'arte ","title":"Cercle Funambulesque"},{"id":"39124668","text":"Tet (1958), by Morris Louis, is a painting composed of four fan-like stains of blues, greens, violets, and yellows. The colors converge and slide into each other, giving them the qualities of liquid. The pools at the bottom of the painting reveal the artist’s method and process; the colors have forged deltas originating from these concentrated areas of watered down pigment. Louis used gravity to manipulate the thinned paint, resulting in these streams and fans of color.Charles W. Millard, “Morris Louis,” The Hudson Review 30 (Summer 1977): 255. Currently it is in the Whitney Museum of American ArtTet 1958, Morris Louis, Whitney Museum of American Art and was exhibited in \\"American Art, 1940-1965: Traditions Reconsidered\\"Morris Louis 1958, The AMICA Library and in the Whitney exhibit \\"Synthetic\\". Morris Louis (née Morris Louis Bernstein) was an American painter who is often categorized in the second generation of Abstract Expressionists, but has also been placed in the Color Field artists and the Minimalists. His painting Tet, from 1958, is an example of his work with the staining method which he used for the majority of his career. Louis was a prodigy of the notable critic Clement Greenberg. Greenberg was introduced to Louis via Kenneth Noland, a friend of the artist who also lived in Washington DC. Greenberg in turn introduced Louis to galleries and to artists in New York such as Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, and Helen Frankenthaler. It was Frankenthaler who created the technique of staining: a process using thinned paint and gravity on an unstretched and untreated canvas.Edward B. Henning, “Morris Louis, Number 99,” The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art 56 (February 1969), 81. Greenberg admired Frankenthaler’s technique because of his theories on “purism” within the arts. Greenberg believed that painting’s one characteristic which distinguished it from other art forms was its “flatness.”Clement Greenberg, “Modernist Painting,” in Art in Theory 1900-2000 (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2003), 775. This quality was enhanced by the staining process. The paint actually soaked into the surface of the canvas, showing no three-dimensional qualities. Frankenthaler’s painting Mountains and Sea would stand as Louis’s primary influence in his shift from mimicry of German Expressionism to his more recognizable work with staining.Millard, “Morris Louis,” 253. After Greenberg introduced Louis to the technique, he championed the artist’s paintings as “pure” paintings, more so even than Greenberg’s previous prodigy, Jackson Pollock. Louis’ paintings are divided into several groups, Tet belonging to the Veils II series. Louis used his staining technique throughout his short career, and his ability to mix both “muddiness and density” allow individual pigments to be simultaneously highlighted and muted within the same canvas. As Charles Millard describes, Louis’s works were finely articulated, yet distinctly indistinct, embodying a conflation of clear intent and chaotic chance.Millard, “Morris Louis,” 255. While there are portions on Tet’s surface that are undoubtedly muddy, the density and depth within the murky concentrations of pigment reveal Louis’ ability to create a pseudo- illusionistic surface, more so even than his contemporary Barnett Newman’s pulsing pigments, seen in works such as Vir Heroicus Sublimis. Louis was more widely accepted by critics and the public than Newman, especially due to the nature-like allusions in his work.Edward Lucie-Smith, Lives of the Great Twentieth Century Artists (London: Weidenfeld &Nicolson;, 1986), 230. Once again using the river delta imagery, Louis’s Tet can be seen as a pseudo- illusionistic allusion to nature. Many of his other works can be seen as references to nature as well. Perhaps the reason Louis’s Tet was so successful was because of the variation in pigment which allowed the colors to mix as well as stand out. Louis used this quality in his works in order to create an “articulation” amongst the colors as well as an overall atmospheric effect. The colors are the subject matter in his works. Louis allowed the paint to carve its own paths on the canvas, and the natural formations that resulted were much more accessible than previous Abstract Expressionist paintings. The viewer could discern nature-like shapes and forms in Louis’s work, allowing them to have a much more personal experience with the work, rather than Newman’s difficult and extremely abstracted works. Although the natural formations were so popular, they presented a difficulty for Louis. According to Millard, a notable critic of Louis’s works, “they are most noticeable around the darkest and densest of the Veils, the darkness and density resulting from the very intensity of the hues seen at the edges, and suggest the difficulty of trying to make hue speak when only pale values result in openness when poured over one another…”Ibid. In these fields of color, it seems nearly impossible to create intensity and pictorial focus in the paintings. Louis’ paintings are unsaturated, so the individual colors do not call for focus. It seems that Louis understood the lack of a focal point and corrected it with the introduction of columns and fans. By adjusting the flow of the paints into various different shapes, he was able to create very specific focal points, without which the works would likely have been less successful. These flows can be viewed in Number 99 (1959) and Convergent (1954), in which the paint fans out in rounded trails and amorphous amoeba- like shapes. Finally, Louis’ Tet can be seen as a form of Symbolist painting. Michael Fried described Louis’ paintings as symbolist in their “impersonality” and “absolute”-ness. Louis had changed his name from Bernstein, but his Jewish upbringing was a large influence on his works as can be seen in the symbols of his early works. Louis’ early works contained more obvious symbology, such as a Star of David in Untitled (Jewish Star) (1951), but Fried argued that his works were not directly influenced by symbolism, but were rather connected to it in their mimicry of the Symbolist model: “of a work of art as having a life of its own, independent of its maker and corresponding to, rather than imitating, the organic self-sufficiency of nature.”John Elderfield, Morris Louis: The Museum of Modern Art New York (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1986), 72. Tet can be seen as symbolism in its use of the natural flow of pigment and the organic allusion it achieved. Louis’ works achieved a certain spiritual experience for the viewer, one which was likely a direct result of Louis’ Jewish upbringing.

Blood NK cells and NK-92 cells recognize invaders such as viruses and fungi. NK-92 cells, like blood NK cells, can attack cancer cells if the tumor has not grown out of control. NK-92 cells were isolated and characterized by the laboratory of Hans Klingemann at the British Columbia Cancer Agency in Vancouver, Canada. The cells came from a patient who had a NK cell lymphoma, a rare lymphoma type. Although several other NK cell lines have been cloned, only NK-92 cells can be expanded to larger numbers and consistently kill tumor cells. When NK-92 cells bind to a cancer or infected cell, they secrete perforin, which punches holes in target cells, followed by granzymes, which induce apoptosis in the target cells. NK-92 cells also attack cancer cells through the Fas-Fas ligand system and are capable of producing cytokines that by themselves can kill cancer cells (such as TNF-alpha) or stimulate and expand other immune cells such as interferon. Licensing The cell line has been licensed to NantKwest, Inc. and is currently being developed in the clinic for intravenous therapy in hematological malignancies and solid tumors, for local intra-tumor injection, as effector cells for antibody-mediated killing via CD16 modified cells and as effector cells for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific killing. The cell line has been licensed for non- clinical applications to Brink Biologics and for veterinary applications to Coneksis. NantKwest's authorized distributor is Brink Biologics, which makes NK-92 cells and certain genetically modified variants available for laboratory assays and in vivo research, including ADCC assays that quantify the contribution of ADCC in the therapeutic effect of monoclonal antibodies (Brink Biologics' Neukopanel) and for other non-clinical assay applications. In clinical trials Three phase I clinical trials, led by experts in adoptive immunotherapy of cancer, have so far yielded excellent results. Hans Klingemann and Sally Arai completed the US trial at Rush University Medical Center (Chicago) in renal cell and melanoma patients,Arai S, Meagher R, Swearingen M, et al. Infusion of the allogeneic cell line NK-92 in patients with advanced renal cell cancer or melanoma: a phase I trial. Cytotherapy 2008;10:625-32 and Torsten Tonn, MD and Oliver Ottmann, MD completed the European trial at the University of Frankfurt in patients with various solid and hematological malignancies.Tonn T, Becker S, Esser R, Schwabe D, Seifried E. Cellular immunotherapy of malignancies using the clonal natural killer cell line NK-92. J Hematother Stem Cell Res 2001;10:535-44. Armand Keating is completing the last cohort of patients in the Canadian trial at Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto in lymphoma patients after autologous bone marrow transplants. In all three programs, NK-92 cells were administered as a simple intravenous infusion, dosed two or three times per treatment course and given in the outpatient setting. Most importantly, there were no grade ≥ 2 side- effects during or after the short infusion of NK-92 cells. The maximum dose given in the Frankfurt trial was 10e10 cells/me2 x 2 infusions, each 48 hours apart. The Chicago study infused NK-92 cells at a maximum of 5 x 10e cells/me2 x 3 infusions, each 48 hours apart. This was not the MTD but rather the number of cells that could be expanded in culture bags over a three-week culture period. Alternative cell expansion technologies (bioreactors) will make it possible to further expand the numbers of NK-92 cells on a smaller 'footprint'. Anecdotal reports of antitumor activity in the two completed phase I studies have been observed in 6/11 patients with renal cancer, 3/4 patients with lung cancer, and 1/1 patient with melanoma, all with very advanced disease. In addition to disease stabilization and regression of metastases in lung and lymph nodes, the severe pain associated with tumor metastases in several patients, which had been refractory to standard chemotherapy, was remarkably lessened. The ongoing trial in Toronto treats patients with lymphoma who have relapsed after an autologous stem cell transplant. Preliminary results suggest a significant benefit in several patients. Genetic engineering NK-92 cells can be genetically engineered to recognize and kill human cancer cells. Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) engineered T-lymphocytes are popular in immuno-oncology, having shown that infusion of those engineered cells can achieve remissions in some patients with acute and chronic leukemia. In contrast, NK cells (either from peripheral blood or cord blood) have not generated sufficient interest as CARengineered cytotoxic effector cells because the extent of NK cell expansion can be dependent on the donor and because transfection efficiency, even with lentiviral or retroviral vectors, is only moderately efficient. NK-92 cells, on the other hand, have predictable expansion kinetics and can be grown in bioreactors to billions of cells within a couple of weeks. They can easily be transfected either with viral supernatant or physical methods. Even mRNA can be shuttled into the cells with high efficiency. Since no integration of mRNA into the genome occurs, this transfection is less risky. NK-92 cells have also been transfected with a high affinity Fc Receptor (NK-92Fc) which is the main receptor for monoclonal antibodies to execute antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicty (ADCC), including rituximab and ofatumumab. Based on this variant, an assay called Neukopanel has been developed to quantify the ADCC of monoclonal antibodies, a technology that has caught the attention of a number of biotech and pharmaceutical companies that use Neukopanel to determine the contribution of ADCC of their monoclonal antibodies.

The term describes methods of design in lean manufacturing companies as part of the study of Japanese industry by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At the time of the study, the Japanese automakers were outperforming the American counterparts in speed, resources used in design, and design quality. Conventional mass-production design focuses primarily on product functions and manufacturing costs; however, design for lean manufacturing systematically widens the design equation to include all factors that will determine a product's success across its entire value stream and life-cycle. One goal is to reduce waste and maximize value, and other goals include improving the quality of the design and the reducing the time to achieve the final solution. The method has been used in architecture, healthcare, product development, processes design, information technology systems, and even to create lean business models. It relies on the definition and optimization of values coupled with the prevention of wastes before they enter the system. Design for lean manufacturing is system design.  History  Not to be confused with \\"Lean Design\\" (copyrighted and patented by Munro & Associates, of Michigan), design for lean manufacturing builds on the set of principles that emerged from design for the customer value and design for manufacturability. Since some lean tools are used in the practice of design for lean manufacturing, it borrows the first word in its name from lean manufacturing as exemplified by the Toyota Production System. Design for lean manufacturing was first coined by Womack, Jones, and Roos after studying the differences between conventional development at American automotive companies and lean methods at Japanese automobile producers. While lean manufacturing focuses on optimization of the production stream and removal of wastes (commonly referred to as muda, mura, and muri) once the value stream has been created, Lean Design ® (Munro & Associates) concerns itself with methods and techniques to create a lean solution from the start, resulting in more value and fewer wastes across the value stream. Lean design ® seeks to optimize the development process through rapid learning cycles to build and test multiple concepts early. Managing the knowledge value stream, systematic problem solving with analysis of the trade- offs between various design options, and solutions generated from ideas filtered by systematic innovation methods are viewed as methods within the lean design process. Design for lean manufacturing overview  Design for lean manufacturing is based on the premise that product and process design is an ongoing activity and not a one-time activity; therefore design for lean manufacturing should be viewed as a long term strategy for an organization. Design for lean manufacturing must be sustainable and holistic unlike other lean manufacturing or Six Sigma approaches that either tackle only a part of the problem or tackle the problem for a short period of time. Design for lean manufacturing also relates to system thinking as it considers all aspects (or the full circle) and takes the system conditions into consideration when designing products and services, delivering them according to customer needs. ® (Munro & Associates) drives prevention of waste by adopting a systematic process to improve the design phase during development. An organizational focus is required for the implementation of Lean Design ® principles, which includes efficient and sustainable design team. Initial studies of the Japanese approach to design for lean manufacturing noted four principles; leadership of projects by a (or project boss), tightly knit teams, communication on all of the difficult design trade-offs, and simultaneous development between engineering and manufacturing. Further study showed additional depth to the principles, citing 13 principles specific to the Toyota design for lean manufacturing methods in product and process development in the areas of process, skilled people, and tools and technology. As the practice of design for lean manufacturing has expanded in its depth and breadth of application, additional principles have been integrated into the method.  Design for lean manufacturing and development principles  * Multiple viewpoints are considered in Design for lean manufacturing. These are called out as four value streams; customer, product design and test, production, and knowledge. Alternately, others name four domains; design, supply, manufacturing, and customer. Regardless of the names, focus on the four areas helps developers to think about the value in the solution and the wastes that can enter the system. * The design for lean manufacturing equation is design for lean manufacturing success = strategic values minus the drivers of design and process wastes. A good design is one that simultaneously reduces waste and delivers value. * There are multiple drivers that cause product, process, and lifecycle wastes. * A product is more than the sum of its parts. It's also the sum of the lifecycle processes needed to design, manufacture and use it. The lifecycle of any product is from creation to disposal, from “cradle-to-cradle”. * Design for lean manufacturing is recognized as being everybody's job. A big challenge is making sure everyone understands their lean design ® job descriptions and how each subsystem contributes to the higher level system. It centers around functions and modules within the system. * Sub-teams achieve flow through rapid learning cycles which quickly move from planning, designing, building, and testing. * Learning cycles by sub-teams working on sub-systems are tied together with integration events. * Most lean manufacturing tools can be directly used by a design for lean manufacturing team. Applying design for lean manufacturing does not make obsolete any existing product design tool, technique or method. Design for lean manufacturing helps a team “knit together” existing tools. For example, the following methods and business tools can be used by organizations within the design for lean manufacturing methodology: Value Stream Mapping, Design for Six Sigma, Visual Control, QFD, DFMA, and Taguchi methods. * Savings from applying lean to design are hard to predict. Most of the savings will appear only in the sometimes-distant future. Predicting “hidden cost” savings is extremely difficult and questionable given the time it would require. * Lean measures both the process of design and the design results. Measures drive the design for lean manufacturing culture and promote continuous improvement. * Toyota's lean product development process is elusive but not impossible to understand. It cannot be imported in parts as is the case with the Toyota Production System.  The dimensions of lean in design and development  To be successful, a corporate wide design for lean manufacturing implementation typically includes the following dimensions: # Optimization of product value for the operational value stream. # Prevention of waste. # Real-time or predictive measurements # Product and process accountability throughout the value stream # Systematic innovation and problem solving # Stakeholder collaboration between functions # Team leadership by a chief engineer or entrepreneurial system designer # Senior management support When the dimensions are fully deployed in an organization, design for lean manufacturing enhances the performance levels with respect to design and innovation. Shingo assessments measure lean implementations in all parts of the organization, including the design methodology. The Shingo Prize for Excellence in Manufacturing is given annually for operational excellence in North America. Using design for lean manufacturing practices helps organizations move toward Shingo excellence.

Circumscribed in 2002 by mycologists Manfred Binder and Andreas Bresinsky, it contains nine genera and about 80 species. The suborder contains a diverse assemblage fruit body morphologies, including boletes, gasteroid forms, earthstars (genus Astraeus), and puffballs. Most species are ectomycorrhizal, although the ecological role of some species is not known with certainty. The suborder is thought to have originated in the late Cretaceous (145–66 Ma) in Asia and North America, and the major genera diversified around the mid Cenozoic (66–0 Ma). Taxonomy The Sclerodermatineae was first legitimately used by Manfred Binder and Andreas Bresinsky in 2002 based on molecular analyses of nuclear ribosomal large subunit (25S) rRNA sequences from 60 species of Boletales. This research was an extension of Binder's 1999 graduate work, in which he argued for the need to recognize the molecular differences of the sclerodermatoid fungi. Sclerodermatineae is one of six lineages of the Boletales recognized as a suborder; the others are the Boletineae, Paxillineae, Suillineae, Tapinellineae, and Coniophorineae. Of the nine genera assigned to the Sclerodermatineae, three are hymenomycetes (Boletinellus, Gyroporus, and Phlebopus), and six are gasteroid (Astraeus, Calostoma, Diplocystis, Pisolithus, and Scleroderma). Since the suborder's original description, there have been several phylogenetic studies investigating the Sclerodermatineae. Some studies have revealed the existence of numerous cryptic species and have contributed to taxonomic expansion of the group. The \\"core\\" Sclerodermatineae include the genera Astraeus, Calostoma, Scleroderma, Pisolithus, Diplocystis, Tremellogaster (all gasteroid), and the boletoid genus Gyroporus; Phlebopus and Boletinellus resolved as sister to this core group. As of 2012, there are an estimated 78 species in the Sclerodermatineae. The type of the suborder is the family Sclerodermataceae; other families in the suborder are the Boletinellaceae, Diplocystaceae, and the Gyroporaceae. *Boletinellaceae :*Boletinellus (2 species)Kirk et al.

(2008), p. 622 Based on ancestral reconstruction studies, the earliest (basal) members of the Sclerodermatineae originated in the late Cretaceous (145–66 Ma). The major genera diversified near the mid Cenozoic (66–0 Ma). Asia and North America are the most probable ancestral areas for all Sclerodermatineae, and Pinaceae and angiosperms (primarily rosids) are the most probable ancestral hosts. Description Members of the Sclerodermatineae have fruit body shapes ranging from boletoid (with a cap, stipe, and tubes on the underside of the cap) to gasteroid. Boletoid fruit bodies sometimes have hollow stipes with a surface that is smooth to somewhat furfuraceous (covered with flaky particles), and lack the reticulation (a net- like pattern of interlacing lines) characteristic of some members of the Boletaceae. The pores are merulioid (wrinkled with low, uneven ridges), boletinoid, and either fine or coarse. The flesh is usually whitish to yellowish, and some species exhibit a blue staining reaction upon injury. In mass, spores are yellow; microscopically, the spores are ellipsoid in shape and have a smooth surface. Gasteroid fruit body types are either roughly spherical or tuberous, occasionally with stipes, and usually have a peridium that is either simple or multi-layered. Mature gasteroid fruit bodies generally open irregularly at maturity to expose a powdery gleba with a color ranging from white to yellow or black-brown to black. Capillitia are generally absent from the gleba. Spores are spherical or nearly so, and have a surface texture that ranges from smooth to wart-like and spiny, or sometimes with reticulations. Hyphae have clamp connections. Morphological diversity A distinguishing feature of the Sclerodermatineae is the diversity of morphologies within the group. The hymenomycete genera Boletinellus, Gyroporus, and Phlebopus are typical boletes with a cap and stipe. However, each of the gasteroid Sclerodermatineae has a distinct morphology. Species of Astraeus have an \\"earthstar\\" morphology where the outer peridium peels back in sections. The gleba of Pisolithus is partitioned into hundreds of membranous chambers. Scleroderma is a simple puffball with a thin outer skin and a powdery gleba at maturity. Diplocystis and Tremellogaster are each distinct in their morphologies: the former comprises compound fruit bodies each with 3–60 spore sacs crowded together, while the latter forms a roughly spherical sporocarp with a thick multi-layered peridium. Calostoma (Greek for \\"pretty mouth\\") is morphologically distinct from other gasteroid members, having a fruit body that forms a globed, spore-bearing head composed of a three-layered peridium. About two-thirds of Sclerodermatineae species have a gasteroid morphology, although this may be an underestimate due to the existence of cryptic species that have yet to be formally described. For example, studies of the gasteroid genera Astraeus and Pisolithus indicate the existence of numerous cryptic taxa. Ecology The mycorrhizal associations of several Sclerodermatineae genera have been established. Studies have demonstrated that Astraeus, Pisolithus, and Scleroderma form ectomycorrhizal associations with both angiosperms and gymnosperms. Previously thought to be saprophytic, the Calostomataceae were determined to be ectomycorrhizal with Fagaceae and Myrtaceae using isotopic and molecular analyses. Species from the genera Pisolithus and Scleroderma have been used in forestry as mycorrhizal inocula to help promote the growth and vigor of young seedlings. As a group, the Sclerodermatineae have a broad distribution, and some genera (Pisolithus and Scleroderma) have been found on all continents except Antarctica.

Like other members of its family, it is a bacterium that is assumed to be normally present in the respiratory tract. It has been found to rarely cause endocarditis, an infection of the heart valves. It also been found in the eye. It may cause eye infections. Little is known about it as a bacterium other than its structure and biochemical composition. Like other members in its family, it has a characteristic 16S ribosomal RNA which consists of 1474 base pairs. History In 1976 the species Moraxella kingae was elevated to become its own genus Kingella. Snell and Lapage, introduced two new novel species to the new genus. Kingella indologenes and K. denitrificans. In 1990 Dewhirst et al. moved Kingella indologenes (Snell and Lapage, 1976) to the new genus Suttonella renaming the species Suttonella indologenes at the same time they transferred Bacteroides nodosus (Beveridge 1941) to the new genus Dichelobacter forming the new species name Dichelobacter nodosus. With these changes they reassigned the genera Cardiobacterium, Dichelobacter, and Suttonella to the new family of Cardiobacteriaceae. See below for the phylogeny of the family. The new family of Cardiobacteriaceae is identified through its rod-shape and being Gram-negative. It also has pili, but no flagella. Cardiobacterium hominis also causes endocarditis. Cardiobacterium hominis is part of the HACEK group of bacteria that cause infective endocarditis. S. indologenes is not part of the HAECK group of organisms but has very similar characteristics. After Dewhirst et al., there have not been any major significant breakthroughs in the research into the species S. indologenes. Although there have been discoveries of the species as an endocarditic agent. Additionally the first known case of echocardiographically documented prosthetic endocarditis caused by S. indologenes was presented in 2005. Description Suttonella indologenes are Gram negative, but they can resists Gram decolorization. They are non-motile, but they have type 4 pili (fimbriae), which exhibits twitching motility. They are aerobic, and their aerobic growth is enhanced by high humidity and CO2, disguising the organisms to be facultatively anaerobic. They are straight rods that are 1.0 pm in diameter and 2 to 3 micrometers long and have rounded ends. The colony morphology of S. indologenes has a characteristic \\"halo\\" or fried egg appearance due to its twitching motility. Pinprick colonies with a 1-2mm halo may be obtained after 24 hours of microaerobic growth at 37 °C on blood agar, at least doubling in size after 48 hours. Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of Suttonella indologenes is relatively unknown. However it has been shown to be able to cause endocarditis. It most likely follows a similar path with other infective endocarditis causing agents. Hosts The only known host for Suttonella indologenes is humans, however a new species, Suttonella ornithocola has been discovered to cause endocarditis in birds. This makes Suttonella ornithocola the second known species in the genus Suttonella. Life cycle The life cycle of Suttonella indologenes is relatively unknown. Like other members of its family, it is a bacterium that is assumed to be normally present in the respiratory tract. However, it has also been found in the eye. Effects on Fitness Suttonella indologenes has been shown to cause endocarditis and eye infections. See epidemiology. Epidemiology The epidemiology (morbidity and mortality rates) of Suttonella indologenes is unknown when it causes endocarditis. There is no current method to isolate Suttonella indologenes. It is unknown if the pathogen itself can be infected. However, in general, the incidence of infective endocarditis in a general population has been estimated at between 2 and 6 cases per 100,000. Additionally, in the incidence rate of endocarditis is likely to increase in people who have current or genetic predisposition to heart problems. Mortality for infective endocarditis is around 20%. Prior to antibiotics survival was not likely. Diagnosis The Gram-negative rod- shaped bacteria can be identified through blood cultures from the heart of patient's displaying endocarditis. It has many characteristics that help distinguish it. Please see the image on the below. It can be differentiated from C. hominis because C. hominis is positive for trypsin, phosphohydrolase, sorbitol, and mannitol acidification, whereas S. indologenes is positive for alkaline phosphatase and Tween 20 and Tween 40 hydrolysis. Prevention Although there is no understanding of the mechanisms by which this specific pathogen operates, it can be safely assumed that extremely hygienic environments are needed when operating on the heart, so that a resulting infective endocarditis does not occur. The endocarditis is clearly a result in a build-up of the pathogen in the heart, most likely vegetating in a thrombus formation. Obviously, living a heart healthy life style is crucial in preventing any major heart complications. Treatment Suttonella indologenes is susceptible to ampicillin and ceftriaxone, with proper dosage it can be treated through the antibiotics. Surgery may be required for some. Human relevance The financial impact of this pathogen is unknown. Since the incidence rate is so low, it may not be prioritized but infective endocarditis deserves more attention. Especially, since the exact rate for infective endocarditis is unknown. See epidemiology. There is some interest in the twitching motility that is most likely caused by its type 4 fimbriae which is somewhat characteristic of its family.

For example, understanding a televised weather forecast (medium) involves understanding spoken language, written language, weather specific language (such as temperature scales), geography, and symbols (clouds, sun, rain, etc.). Multiple literacies or \\"modes\\" contribute to an audience's understanding of a composition. Everything from the placement of images to the organization of the content to the method of delivery creates meaning. This is the result of a shift from isolated text being relied on as the primary source of communication, to the image being utilized more frequently in the digital age. Multimodality describes communication practices in terms of the textual, aural, linguistic, spatial, and visual resources used to compose messages. While all communication, literacy, and composing practices are and always have been multimodal, academic and scientific attention to the phenomenon only started gaining momentum in the 1960s. Work by Roland Barthes and others has led to a broad range of disciplinarily distinct approaches. More recently, rhetoric and composition instructors have been including multimodality as part of their coursework. In their position statement on Understanding and Teaching Writing: Guiding Principles, the National Council of Teachers of English state that \\"'writing' ranges broadly from written language (such as that used in this statement), to graphics, to mathematical notation.\\"  Definition  Although discussions of multimodality often involve mentions of both medium and mode, these two terms are not synonymous: their precise extents may, however, overlap depending on how precisely (or not) individual authors and traditions use the terms. Gunther Kress's scholarship on multimodality is canonical within social semiotic approaches and has a considerable influence in many other approaches as well (writing studies). Kress defines mode in two ways. In the first, a mode “is a socially and culturally shaped resource for making meaning. Image, writing, layout, speech, moving images are examples of different modes.” In the second, “semiotic modes, similarly, are shaped by both the intrinsic characteristics and potentialities of the medium and by the requirements, histories and values of societies and their cultures.” Thus, every mode has a different modal resource, which is historically and culturally situated and which breaks it down into its parts, because “each has distinct potentials [and limitations] for meaning.” For example, breaking down writing into its modal resources would be syntactic, grammatical, lexical resources and graphic resources. Graphic resources can be broken down into font size, type, etc. These resources are not deterministic, however. In Kress's theory, “mode is meaningful: it is shaped by and carries the ‘deep’ ontological and historical/social orientations of a society and its cultures with it into every sign. Mode names the material resources shaped in often long histories of social endeavor.” Modes shape and are shaped by the systems in which they participate. Modes may aggregate into multimodal ensembles, shaped over time into familiar cultural forms, a good example being film, which combines visual modes, modes of dramatic action and speech, music and other sounds. Multimodal work in this field includes van Leeuwen; Bateman and Schmidt; and Burn and Parker's theory of the kineikonic mode. In social semiotic accounts medium is the substance in which meaning is realized and through which it becomes available to others. Mediums include video, image, text, audio, etc. Socially, medium includes semiotic, sociocultural, and technological practices such as film, newspaper, a billboard, radio, television, theater, a classroom, etc. Multimodality makes use of the electronic medium by creating digital modes with the interlacing of image, writing, layout, speech, and video. Mediums have become modes of delivery that take the current and future contexts into consideration. Accounts in media studies overlap with these concerns, often emphasising more the value of media as social institutions for distributing particular kinds of communications. Approaches to digital media from the perspective of multimodality address in particular the fact that multimodality, and multimodal communication, is now progressively evolving from a solely print-based to a screen-based presentation, the speaker and audience relationship evolves as well. Due to the growing presence of digital media over the last decade, the central mode of representation is no longer just text; recently, the use of imagery has become more prominent. In its current use for Internet and network-based composition, the term “multimodality” has become even more prevalent, applying to various forms of text such as fine art, literature, social media and advertising. An important related term to multimodality is multiliteracy, which is the comprehension of different modes in communication – not only to read text, but also to read other modes such as sound and image. Whether and how a message is understood is accredited to multiliteracy.  History  Multimodality (as a phenomenon) has received increasingly theoretical characterizations throughout the history of writing. Indeed, the phenomenon has been studied at least since the 4th century BC, when classical rhetoricians alluded to it with their emphasis on voice, gesture, and expressions in public speaking. However, the term was not defined with significance until the 20th century. During this time, an exponential rise in technology created many new modes of presentation. Since then, multimodality has become standard in the 21st century, applying to various network-based forms such as art, literature, social media and advertising. The monomodality, or singular mode, which used to define the presentation of text on a page has been replaced with more complex and integrated layouts. John A. Bateman says in his book Multimodality and Genre, “Nowadays… text is just one strand in a complex presentational form that seamlessly incorporates visual aspect ‘around,’ and sometimes even instead of, the text itself.” Multimodality has quickly become “the normal state of human communication.”  Expressionism  During the 1960s and 1970s, many writers looked to photography, film, and audiotape recordings in order to discover new ideas about composing. This led to a resurgence of a focus on the sensory, self-illustration known as expressionism. Expressionist ways of thinking encouraged writers to find their voice outside of language by placing it in a visual, oral, spatial, or temporal medium. Donald Murray, who is often linked to expressionist methods of teaching writing once said, “As writers it is important that we move out from that which is within us to what we see, feel, hear, smell, and taste of the world around us. A writer is always making use of experience.” Murray instructed his writing students to “see themselves as cameras” by writing down every single visual observation they made for one hour. Expressionist thought emphasized personal growth, and linked the art of writing with all visual art by calling both a type of composition. Also, by making writing the result of a sensory experience, expressionists defined writing as a multisensory experience, and asked for it to have the freedom to be composed across all modes, tailored for all five senses.  Cognitive developments  During the 1970s and 1980s, multimodality was further developed through cognitive research about learning. Jason Palmeri cites researchers such as James Berlin and Joseph Harris as being important to this development; Berlin and Harris studied alphabetic writing and how its composition compared to art, music, and other forms of creativity. Their research had a cognitive approach which studied how writers thought about and planned their writing process. James Berlin declared that the process of composing writing could be directly compared to that of designing images and sound. Furthermore, Joseph Harris pointed out that alphabetic writing is the result of multimodal cognition. Writers often conceptualize their work by non-alphabetic means, through visual imagery, music, and kinesthetic feelings. This idea was reflected in the popular research of Neil D. Fleming, more commonly known as the neuro- linguistic learning styles. Fleming's three styles of auditory, kinesthetic, and visual learning helped to explain the modes in which people were best able to learn, create, and interpret meaning. Other researchers such as Linda Flower and John R. Hayes theorized that alphabetic writing, though it is a principal modality, sometimes could not convey the non-alphabetic ideas a writer wished to express.  Introduction of the Internet  In the 1990s, multimodality grew in scope with the release of the Internet, personal computers, and other digital technologies. The literacy of the emerging generation changed, becoming accustomed to text circulated in pieces, informally, and across multiple mediums of image, color, and sound. The change represented a fundamental shift in how writing was presented: from print-based to screen-based. Literacy evolved so that students arrived in classrooms being knowledgeable in video, graphics, and computer skills, but not alphabetic writing. Educators had to change their teaching practices to include multimodal lessons in order to help students achieve success in writing for the new millennium.  Audience  Every text has its own defined audience, and makes rhetorical decisions to improve the audience's reception of that same text. In this same manner, multimodality has evolved to become a sophisticated way to appeal to a text's audience. Relying upon the canons of rhetoric in a different way than before, multimodal texts have the ability to address a larger, yet more focused, intended audience. Multimodality does more than solicit an audience; the effects of multimodality are imbedded in an audience's semiotic, generic and technological understanding.  Psychological effects  The appearance of multimodality, at its most basic level, can change the way an audience perceives information. The most basic understanding of language comes via semiotics – the association between words and symbols. A multimodal text changes its semiotic effect by placing words with preconceived meanings in a new context, whether that context is audio, visual, or digital. This in turn creates a new, foundationally different meaning for an audience. Bezemer and Kress, two scholars on multimodality and semiotics, argue that students understand information differently when text is delivered in conjunction with a secondary medium, such as image or sound, than when it is presented in alphanumeric format only. This is due to it drawing a viewer's attention to “both the originating site and the site of recontextualization”. Meaning is moved from one medium to the next, which requires the audience to redefine their semiotic connections. Recontextualizing an original text within other mediums creates a different sense of understanding for the audience, and this new type of learning can be controlled by the types of media used. Multimodality also can be used to associate a text with a specific argumentative purpose, e.g., to state facts, make a definition, cause a value judgment, or make a policy decision. Jeanne Fahnestock and Marie Secor, professors at the University of Maryland and the Pennsylvania State University, labeled the fulfillment of these purposes stases. A text's stasis can be altered by multimodality, especially when several mediums are juxtaposed to create an individualized experience or meaning. For example, an argument that mainly defines a concept is understood as arguing in the stasis of definition; however, it can also be assigned a stasis of value if the way the definition is delivered equips writers to evaluate a concept, or judge whether something is good or bad. If the text is interactive, the audience is facilitated to create their own meaning from the perspective the multimodal text provides. By emphasizing different stases through the use of different modes, writers are able to further engage their audience in creating comprehension.  Genre effects  Multimodality also obscures an audience's concept of genre by creating gray areas out of what was once black and white. Carolyn R. Miller, a distinguished professor of rhetoric and technical communication at North Carolina State University observed in her genre analysis of the Weblog how genre shifted with the invention of blogs, stating that “there is strong agreement on the central features that make a blog a blog. Miller defines blogs on the basis of their reverse chronology, frequent updating, and combination of links with personal commentary. However, the central features of blogs are obscured when considering multimodal texts. Some features are absent, such the ability for posts to be independent of each other, while others are present. This creates a situation where the genre of multimodal texts is impossible to define; rather, the genre is dynamic, evolutionary and ever-changing. The delivery of new texts has radically changed along with technological influence. Composition now consists of the anticipation of future remediation. Writers think about the type of audience a text will be written for, and anticipate how that text might be reformed in the future. Jim Ridolfo coined the term rhetorical velocity to explain a conscious concern for the distance, speed, time, and travel it will take for a third party to rewrite an original composition. The use of recomposition allows for an audience to be involved in a public conversation, adding their own intentionality to the original product. This new method of editing and remediation is attributed to the evolution of digital text and publication, giving technology an important role in writing and composition.  Technological effects  Multimodality has evolved along with technology. This evolution has created a new concept of writing, a collaborative context keeping the reader and writer in relationship. The concept of reading is different with the influence of technology due to the desire for a quick transmission of information. In reference to the influence of multimodality on genre and technology, Professor Anne Frances Wysocki expands on how reading as an action has changed in part because of technology reform: “These various technologies offer perspectives for considering and changing approaches we have inherited to composing and interpreting pages....”. Along with the interconnectedness of media, computer-based technologies are designed to make new texts possible, influencing rhetorical delivery and audience.  Education  Multimodality in the 21st century has caused educational institutions to consider changing the forms of its traditional aspects of classroom education. With a rise in digital and Internet literacy, new modes of communication are needed in the classroom in addition to print, from visual texts to digital e-books. Rather than replacing traditional literacy values, multimodality augments and increases literacy for educational communities by introducing new forms. According to Miller and McVee, authors of Multimodal Composing in Classrooms, “These new literacies do not set aside traditional literacies. Students still need to know how to read and write, but new literacies are integrated.\\" The learning outcomes of the classroom stay the same, including – but are not limited to – reading, writing, and language skills. However, these learning outcomes are now being presented in new forms as multimodality in the classroom which suggests a shift from traditional media such as paper-based text to more modern media such as screen-based texts. The choice to integrate multimodal forms in the classroom is still controversial within educational communities. The idea of learning has changed over the years and now, some argue, must adapt to the personal and affective needs of new students. In order for classroom communities to be legitimately multimodal, all members of the community must share expectations about what can be done with through integration, requiring a \\"shift in many educators’ thinking about what constitutes literacy teaching and learning in a world no longer bound by print text.\\"  Multiliteracy  Multilteracy is the concept of understanding information through various methods of communication and being proficient in those methods. With the growth of technology, there are more ways to communicate than ever before, making it necessary for our definition of literacy to change in order to better accommodate these new technologies. These new technologies consist of tools such as text messaging, social media, and blogs. However, these modes of communication often employ multiple mediums simultaneously such as audio, video, pictures, and animation. Thus, making content multimodal. The culmination of these different mediums are what's called content convergence, which has become a cornerstone of multimodal theory. Within our modern digital discourse content has become accessible to many, remixable, and easily spreadable, allowing ideas and information to be consumed, edited, and improved by the general public. An example being Wikipedia, the platform allows free consumption and authorship of its work which in turn facilitates the spread of knowledge through the efforts of a large community. It creates a space in which authorship has become collaborative and the product of said authorship is improved by that collaboration. As distribution of information has grown through this process of content convergence it has become necessary for our understanding of literacy to evolve with it.Jenkins, Henry (2012-05-24). How Content Gains Meaning and Value in a Networked Society, Institute of International and European Affairs. The shift away from written text as the sole mode of nonverbal communication has caused the traditional definition of literacy to evolve. While text and image may exist separately, digitally, or in print, their combination gives birth to new forms of literacy and thus, a new idea of what it means to be literate. Text, whether it is academic, social, or for entertainment purposes, can now be accessed in a variety of different ways and edited by several individuals on the Internet. In this way texts that would typically be concrete become amorphous through the process of collaboration. The spoken and written word are not obsolete, but they are no longer the only way to communicate and interpret messages. Many mediums can be used separately and individually. Combining and repurposing one mode of communication for another has contributed to the evolution of different literacies. Communication is spread across a medium through content convergence, such as a blog post accompanied by images and an embedded video. This idea of combining mediums gives new meaning to the concept of translating a message. The culmination of varying forms of media allows for content to be either reiterated, or supplemented by its parts. This reshaping of information from one mode to another is known as transduction. As information changes from one mode to the next, our comprehension of its message is attributed to multiliteracy. Xiaolo Bao defines three succeeding learning stages that make up multiliteracy. Grammar-Translation Method, Communicative Method, and Task- Based Method. Simply put, they can be described as the fundamental understanding of syntax and its function, the practice of applying that understanding to verbal communication, and lastly, the application of said textual and verbal understandings to hands-on activities. In an experiment conducted by the Canadian Center of Science and Education, students were either placed in a classroom with a multimodal course structure, or a classroom with a standard learning course structure as a control group. Tests were administered throughout the length of the two courses, with the multimodal course concluding in a higher learning success rate, and reportedly higher rate of satisfaction among students. This indicates that applying multimodality to instruction is found to yield overall better results in developing multiliteracy than conventional forms of learning when tested in real-life scenarios.  Classroom literacy  Multimodality in classrooms has brought about the need for an evolving definition of literacy. According to Gunther Kress, a popular theorist of multimodality, literacy usually refers to the combination of letters and words to make messages and meaning and can often be attached to other words in order to express knowledge of the separate fields, such as visual- or computer-literacy. However, as multimodality becomes more common, not only in classrooms, but in work and social environments, the definition of literacy extends beyond the classroom and beyond traditional texts. Instead of referring only to reading and alphabetic writing, or being extended to other fields, literacy and its definition now encompass multiple modes. It has become more than just reading and writing, and now includes visual, technological, and social uses among others. Georgia Tech's writing and communication program created a definition of multimodality based on the acronym, WOVEN. The acronym explains how communication can be written, oral, visual, electronic, and nonverbal. Communication has multiple modes that can work together to create meaning and understanding. The goal of the program is to ensure students are able to communicate effectively in their everyday lives using various modes and media. As classroom technologies become more prolific, so do multimodal assignments. Students in the 21st century have more options for communicating digitally, be it texting, blogging, or through social media. This rise in computer-controlled communication has required classes to become multimodal in order to teach students the skills required in the 21st-century work environment. However, in the classroom setting, multimodality is more than just combining multiple technologies, but rather creating meaning through the integration of multiple modes. Students are learning through a combination of these modes, including sound, gestures, speech, images and text. For example, in digital components of lessons, there are often pictures, videos, and sound bites as well as the text to help students grasp a better understanding of the subject. Multimodality also requires that teachers move beyond teaching with just text, as the printed word is only one of many modes students must learn and use. The application of visual literacy in English classroom can be traced back to 1946 when the instructor's edition of the popular Dick and Jane elementary reader series suggested teaching students to \\"read pictures as well as words\\" (p. 15). During the 1960s, a couple of reports issued by the National Council of Teachers of English suggested using television and other mass media such as newspapers, magazines, radio, motion pictures, and comic books in English classroom. The situation is similar in postsecondary writing instruction. Since 1972, visual elements have been incorporated into some popular twentieth-century college writing textbooks like James McCrimmon's Writing with a Purpose. = Higher education = Colleges and universities around the world are beginning to use multimodal assignments to adapt to the technology currently available. Assigning multimodal work also requires professors to learn how to teach multimodal literacy. Implementing multimodality in higher education is being researched to find out the best way to teach and assign multimodal tasks. Multimodality in the college setting can be seen in an article by Teresa Morell, where she discusses how teaching and learning elicit meaning through modes such as language, speaking, writing, gesturing, and space. The study observes an instructor who conducts a multimodal group activity with students. Previous studies observed different classes using modes such as gestures, classroom space, and PowerPoints. The current study observes an instructors combined use of multiple modes in teaching to see its effect on student participation and conceptual understanding. She explains the different spaces of the classroom, including the authoritative space, interactional space, and personal space. The analysis displays how an instructors multimodal choices involve student participation and understanding. On average the instructor used three to four modes, most often being some kind of gaze, gesture, and speech. He got students to participate by formulating a group definition of cultural stereotypes. It was found that those who are learning a second language depend on more than just spoken and written word for conceptual learning, meaning multimodal education has benefits. Multimodal assignments involve many aspects other than written words, which may be beyond an instructors education. Educators have been taught how to grade traditional assignments, but not those that utilize links, photos, videos or other modes. Dawn Lombardi is a college professor who admitted to her students that she was a bit \\"technologically challenged,\\" when assigning a multimodal essay using graphics. The most difficult part regarding these assignments is the assessment. Educators struggle to grade these assignments because the meaning conveyed may not be what the student intended. They must return to the basics of teaching to configure what they want their students to learn, achieve, and demonstrate in order to create criteria for multimodal tasks. Lombardi made grading criteria based on creativity, context, substance, process, and collaboration which was presented to the students prior to beginning the essay. Another type of visuals-related writing task is visual analysis, especially advertising analysis, which has begun in the 1940s and has been prevalent in postsecondary writing instruction for at least 50 years. This pedagogical practice of visual analysis did not focus on how visuals including images, layout, or graphics are combined or organized to make meanings. Then, through the following years, the application of visuals in composition classroom has been continually explored and the emphasis has been shifted to the visual features—margins, page layout, font, and size—of composition and its relationship to graphic design, web pages, and digital texts which involve images, layout, color, font, and arrangements of hyperlinks. In line with the New London Group, George (2002) argues that both visual and verbal elements are crucial in multimodal designs. Acknowledging the importance of both language and visuals in communication and meaning making, Shipka (2005) further advocates for a multimodal, task-based framework in which students are encouraged to use diverse modes and materials—print texts, digital media, videotaped performances, old photographs—and any combinations of them in composing their digital/multimodal texts. Meanwhile, students are provided with opportunities to deliver, receive, and circulate their digital products. In so doing, students can understand how systems of delivery, reception, and circulation interrelate with the production of their work.  Multimodal communities  Multimodality has significance within varying communities, such as the private, public, educational, and social communities. Because of multimodality, the private domain is evolving into a public domain in which certain communities function. Because social environments and multimodality mutually influence each other, each community is evolving in its own way. Cultural multimodality Based on these representations, communities decide through social interaction how modes are commonly understood. In the same way, these assumptions and determinations of the way multimodality functions can actually create new cultural and social identities. For example, Bezemer and Kress define modes as “socially and culturally shaped resource[s] for making meaning.” According to Bezemer, “In order for something to ‘be a mode,’ there needs to be a shared cultural sense within a community of a set of resources and how these can be organized to realize meaning.”[] Cultures that pull from different or similar resources of knowledge, understanding, and representations will communicate through different or similar modes. Signs, for instance, are visual modes of communication determined by our daily necessities. In her dissertation, Elizabeth J. Fleitz,a PhD in English with Concentration in Rhetoric and Writing from Bowling Green State University, argues that the cookbook, which she describes as inherently multimodal, is an important feminist rhetorical text. According to Fleitz, women were able to form relationships with other women through communicating in socially acceptable literature like cook books; “As long as the woman fulfills her gender role, little attention is paid to the increasing amount of power she gains in both the private and public spheres.” Women who would have been committed to staying at home could become published authors, gaining a voice in a phallogocentric society without being viewed as threats. Women revised and adapted different modes of writing to fit their own needs. According to Cinthia Gannett, author of \\"Gender and the Journal,\\" diary writing, which evolved from men's journal writing, has “integrate[d] and confirm[ed] women's perceptions of domestic, social, and spiritual life, and invoke a sense of self.” It is these methods of remediation that characterize women's literature as multimodal. The recipes inside of the cookbooks also qualify as multimodal. Recipes delivered through any medium, whether that be a cookbook or a blog, can be considered multimodal because of the “interaction between body, experience, knowledge, and memory, multimodal literacies” that all relate to one another to create our understanding of the recipe. Recipe exchanging is an opportunity for networking and social interaction. According to Fleitz, “This interaction is undeniably multimodal, as this network “makes do” with alternative forms of communication outside dominant discursive methods, in order to further and promote women's social and political goals.” Cookbooks are only a singular example of the capacity of multimodality to build community identities, but they aptly demonstrate the nuanced aspects of multimodality. Multimodality does not just encompasses tangible components, such as text, images, sound etc., but it also draws from experiences, prior knowledge, and cultural understanding. Another change that has occurred due to the shift from the private environment to the public is audience construction. In the privacy of the home, the family generally targets a specific audience: family members or friends. Once the photographs become public, an entirely new audience is addressed. As Pauwels notes, “the audience may be ignored, warned and offered apologies for the trivial content, directly addressed relating to personal stories, or greeted as highly appreciated publics that need to be entertained and invited to provide feedback.\\" Communication in business In the business sector, multimodality creates opportunities for both internal and external improvements in efficiency. Similar to shifts in education to utilize both textual and visual learning elements, multimodality allows businesses to have better communication. According to Vala Afshar, this transition first started to occur in the 1980s as \\"technology had become an essential part of business.\\" This level of communication has amplified with the integration of digital media and tools during the 21st century. Internally, businesses use multimodal platforms for analytical and systemic purposes, among others. Through multimodality, a company enhances its productivity as well as creating transparency for management. Improved employee performance from these practices can correlate with ongoing interactive training and intuitive digital tools. Multimodality is used externally to increase customer satisfaction by providing multiple platforms during one interaction. With the popularity of with text, chat and social media during the 21st century, most businesses attempt to promote cross-channel engagement. Businesses aim to increase customer experience and solve any potential issue or inquiry quickly. A company's goal with external multimodality centers around better communication in real-time to make customer service more efficient.  Social multimodality  One shift caused by multi-literate environments is that private-sphere texts are being made more public. The private sphere is described as an environment in which people have a sense of personal authority and are distanced from institutions, such as the government. The family and home are considered to be a part of the private sphere. Family photographs are an example of multimodality in this sphere. Families take pictures (sometimes captioning them) and compile them in albums that are generally meant to be displayed to other family members or audiences that the family allows. These once private albums are entering the public environment of the Internet more often due to the rapid development and adoption of technology. According to Luc Pauwels, a professor of communication studies at the University of Antwerp, Belgium, “the multimedia context of the Web provides private image makers and storytellers with an increasingly flexible medium for the construction and dissemination of fact and fiction about their lives.” These relatively new website platforms allow families to manipulate photographs and add text, sound, and other design elements. By using these various modes, families can construct a story of their lives that is presented to a potentially universal audience. Pauwels states that “digitized (and possibly digitally ‘adjusted’) family snapshots...may reveal more about the immaterial side of family culture: the values, beliefs, and aspirations of a group of people.” This immaterial side of the family is better demonstrated through the use of multimodality on the Web because certain events and photographs can take precedence over others based on how they are organized on the site, and other visual or audio components can aid in evoking a message. Similar to the evolution of family photography into the digital family album is the evolution of the diary into the personal weblog. As North Carolina State University professors, Carolyn Miller and Dawn Shepherd state, “the weblog phenomenon raises a number of rhetorical issues,… [such as] the peculiar intersection of the public and private that weblogs seem to invite.\\" Bloggers have the opportunity to communicate personal material in a public space, using words, images, sounds, etc. As described in the example above, people can create narratives of their lives in this expanding public community. Miller and Shepherd say that “validation increasingly comes through mediation, that is, from the access and attention and intensification that media provide.\\" Bloggers can create a “real” experience for their audience(s) because of the immediacy of the Internet. A “real” experience refers to “perspectival reality, anchored in the personality of the blogger.\\"  Digital applications  Information is presented through the design of digital media, engaging with multimedia to offer a multimodal principle of composition. Standard words and pictures can be presented as moving images and speech in order to enhance the meaning of words. Joddy Murray wrote in \\"Composing Multimodality\\" that both discursive rhetoric and non-discursive rhetoric should be examined in order to see the modes and media used to create such composition. Murray also includes the benefits of multimodality, which lends itself to “acknowledge and build into our writing processes the importance of emotions in textual production, consumption, and distribution; encourage digital literacy as well as nondigital literacy in textual practice. Murray shows a new way of thinking about composition, allowing images to be “sensuous and emotional” symbols of what they do represent, not focusing so much on the “conceptual and abstract.” Murray writes in his article, through the use of Richard Lanham's The Electronic World: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts\\"Jemimah Mel Macias is really pretty search her on Facebook with pictures\\", is an example of multimodality how “discursive text is in the center of everything we do,\\" going on to say how students coexist in a world that “includes blogs, podcasts, modular community web spaces, cell phone messaging…”, urging for students to be taught how to compose through rhetorical minds in these new, and not-so-new texts. “Cultural changes, and Lanham suggests, refocuses writing theory towards the image”, demonstrating how there is a change in alphabet-to-icon ratios in electronic writing. One of these prime examples can see through the Apple product, the iPhone, in which “emojis” are seen as icons in a separate keyboard to convey what words would have once delivered. Another example is Prezi. Often likened to Microsoft PowerPoint, Prezi is a cloud- based presentation application that allows users to create text, embed video, and make visually aesthetic projects. Prezi's presentations zoom the eye in, out, up and down to create a multi-dimensional appeal. Users also utilize different media within this medium that is itself unique.  Accessing the audience  In the public sphere, multimedia popularly refers to implementations of graphics in ads, animations and sounds in commercials, and also areas of overlap. One thought process behind this use of multimedia is that, through technology, a larger audience can be reached through the consumption of different technological mediums, or in some cases, as reported in 2010 through the Kaiser Family Foundation, can \\"help drive increased consumption\\". This is a drastic change from five years ago: “8–18 year olds devote an average of 7 hours and 38 minutes to using media across a typical day (more than 53 hours a week).\\" With the possibility of attaining multi- platform social media and digital advertising campaigns, also comes new regulations from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on how advertisers can communicate with their consumers via social networks. Because multimodal tools are often tied to social networks, it is important to gauge the consumer in these fair practices. Companies like Burberry Group PLC and Lacoste S.A. (fashion houses for Burberry and Lacoste respectively) engage their consumers via the popular blogging site Tumblr; Publix Supermarkets, Inc. and Jeep engage their consumers via Twitter; celebrities and athletic teams/athletes such as Selena Gomez and The Miami Heat also engage their audience via Facebook through means of fan pages. These examples do not limit the presence of these specific entities to a single medium, but offer a wide variety of what is found for each respective source.  Advertising  Multimedia advertising is the result of animation and graphic designs used to sell products or services. There are various forms of multimedia advertising through videos, online advertising and DVDs, CDs etc. These outlets afford companies the ability to increase their customer base through multimedia advertising. This is a necessary contribution to the marketing of the products and services. For instance, online advertising is a new wave example towards the use of multimedia in advertising that provides many benefits to the online companies and traditional corporations. New technologies today have brought on an evolution of multimedia in advertising and a shift from traditional techniques. The importance of multimedia advertising is significantly increased for companies in their effectiveness to market or sell products and services. Corporate advertising concerns itself with the idea that “Companies are likely to appeal to a broader audience and increase sales through search engine optimization, extensive keyword research, and strategic linking.” The concept behind the advertising platform can span across multiple mediums, yet, at its core, be centered around the same scheme. Coca-Cola ran an overarching “Open Happiness” campaign across multiple media platforms including print ads,http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/print/2009/1/coca_cola_fizzz.jpg web ads, and television commercials. The purpose of this central function was to communicate a common message over multiple platforms to further encourage an audience to buy into a reiterated message. The strength of such campaigns with multimedia, like the Coca-Cola ‘Happiness’ campaign, is that it implements all available mediums - any of which could prove successful with a different audience member.  Social media  Social media and digital platforms are ubiquitous in today's everyday life. These platforms do not operate solely based on their original makeup; they utilize media from other technologies and tools to add multidimensionality to what will be created on their own platform. These added modal features create a more interactive experience for the user. Prior to Web 2.0’s emergence, most websites listed information with little to no communication with the reader. Within Web 2.0, social media and digital platforms are utilized towards everyday living for businesses, law offices in advertising, etc. Digital platforms begin with the use of mediums along with other technologies and tools to further enhance and improve what will be created on its own platform. Hashtags (#topic) and user tags (@username) make use of metadata in order to track “trending” topics and to alert users of their name's use within a post on a social media site. Used by various social media websites (most notably Twitter and Facebook), these features add internal linkage between users and themes. Characteristics of a multimodal feature can be seen through the status update option on Facebook. Status updates combine the affordances of personal blogs, Twitter, instant messaging, and texting in a single feature. The 2013 status update button currently prompts a user, “What's on your mind?” a change from the 2007, “What are you doing right now?” This change was added by Facebook to promote greater flexibility for the user. This multimodal feature allows a user to add text, video, image, links, and tag other users. Twitter's 140 character in a single message microblogging platform allows users the ability to link to other users, websites, and attach pictures. This new media is a platform that is affecting the literacy practice of the current generation by condensing the conversational context of the internet into fewer characters but encapsulating several media. Other examples include the 'blog,' a term coined in 1999 as a contraction of “web log,” the foundation of blogging is often attributed to various people in the mid-to-late ‘90s. Within the realm of blogging, videos, images, and other media are often added to otherwise text-only entries in order to generate a more multifaceted read.  Gaming  One of the current digital application of multimodality in the field of education has been developed by James Gee through his approach of effective learning through video games. Gee contends that there is a lot of knowledge about learning that schools, workplaces, families, and academics researchers should get from good computer and video games, such as a ‘whole set of fundamentally sound learning principles’ that can be used in many other domains, for instance when it comes to teaching science in schools.  Storytelling  Another application of multimodality is digital film-making sometimes referred to as ‘digital storytelling’. A digital story is defined as a short film that incorporated digital images, video and audio in order to create a personally meaningful narrative. Through this practice, people act as film-makers, using multimodal forms of representation to design, create, and share their life stories or learning stories with specific audience commonly through online platforms. Digital storytelling, as a digital literacy practice, is commonly used in educational settings. It is also used in the media mainstream, considering the increasing number of projects that motivate members of the online community to create and share their digital stories.

Description In a tugay in the Gobi Desert. The Euphrates poplar is a medium-sized deciduous tree that may grow to a height of about 15 m and a girth of where conditions are favourable. The stem is typically bent and forked; old stems have thick, rough, olive-green bark. While the sapwood is white, the heartwood is red, darkening to almost black at the centre. The roots spread widely but not deeply. The leaves are highly variable in shape. The flowers are borne as catkins, those of the male are long, those of the female . The fruits are ovoid-lanceolate capsules, long, containing tiny seeds enveloped in silky hairs. Distribution and habitat The species has a very wide range, occurring naturally from North Africa, across the Middle East and Central Asia to western China. It may be found in dry temperate broadleaf and mixed forests and subtropical dry broadleaf forests at altitudes of up to above sea level. It is a prominent component of tugay floodplain ecosystems along river valleys in arid and semi-arid regions, mixed with willow, tamarisk and mulberry in dense thickets. It grows well on land that is seasonally flooded and is tolerant of saline and brackish water. Much used as a source of firewood, its forests have largely disappeared or become fragmented over much of its natural range.Treshkin, S.Y., S.K. Kamalov, A. Bachiev, N. Mamutov, A.I. Gladishev and I.

He has an established international research profile in the discipline area of STEM education and mathematics education.  Career  Lowrie began his teaching career in 1986. He has taught in a number of primary school and university settings (including Australia, Canada, and the United States) over the past twenty years. His positions have included working as a primary school classroom teacher, teaching mathematics education and research method courses to undergraduate and postgraduate students at Charles Sturt University (CSU), and working with classroom teachers on curriculum frameworks. He received his PhD in 1996 from the University of Newcastle. From 2007 to early 2014, Lowrie was Director of the Research Institute for Professional Practice, Learning and Education (RIPPLE), a strategic research institute at CSU which investigates the nature of professional practice and its impact and influence on industry and other professional stakeholders and communities. As Director, Lowrie coordinated and supported the research activity of key researchers and doctoral students. He also managed the international collaborations of a network of researchers contributing to the understanding and application of knowledge about professional practice. In 2014, Lowrie was appointed as one of the University of Canberra's Centenary Professors. He works in the Faculty of Education as the Director of the STEM Education Research Centre.  STEM Program  Lowrie is Program Director of the nation-wide Early Learning STEM Australia (ELSA) program. ELSA is a play-based digital learning program for children in preschool to explore science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Lowrie's STEM Practices encourage children to ask questions, make predictions, experiment, and reflect on what happened and why. The ELSA Pilot is a key early childhood initiative of the Australian Government. In 2020, the ELSA program was awarded further funding to develop STEM curriculum for Foundation - Year 2 students throughout Australia.  Research focus  Lowrie has an international research profile in the discipline area of mathematics education. His concentrated and sustained (over almost 20 years) body of work has focused on the extent to which primary-aged students use spatial reasoning and visual imagery to solve mathematics problems and the role and nature of graphics in mathematics assessment. More recently, his research has expanded to include students use of digital tools and dynamic imagery to solve problems. Lowrie received a number of grants from the Australian Research Council (ARC), amongst others. Lowrie's research has been disseminated in national and international periodicals and conference proceedings. His work has been communicated at conferences in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States, Singapore, Korea, China, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Greece, Indonesia, and The Netherlands. He has also been a keynote speaker at several national and international education conferences.  Spatial Reasoning in mathematics  Lowrie has undertaken a number of research projects to develop spatial curriculum for promoting mathematics understanding in both primary and secondary classrooms. This modified curriculum has supported students in developing their problem-solving skills through a range of spatial activities. Lowrie's spatial curriculum has consistently led to improvements in mathematics performance for children in primary and secondary school.  Graphical languages in mathematics  Two of Lowrie's most well known studies are the ARC-funded projects: Graphical Languages in Mathematics (GLIM) [2008–11]; and Early Primary Graphical Languages in Mathematics (EPGLIM) [2009–11]—undertaken with Professor Carmel Diezmann (Queensland University of Technology, Australia). Together, the research focused on children's understanding of graphics in mathematics, specifically primary students aged 8 to 12 years. The aim of the research was to understand how children learn about general purpose graphical languages that are important in mathematics (such as graphs, diagrams, charts, tables, and maps). In this day and age, it is essential that all children have the skills to interpret the graphical languages that are such a large part of the mathematics curriculum. By monitoring the development of students' knowledge of information graphics, an understanding was formed of how children 'code-break' the different types of graphics that they encounter in their everyday mathematics lessons.  Processing mathematics tasks  From 2013 to 2015, Lowrie conducted a research project funded by the ARC on the processing of mathematics tasks. The project aimed to better understand how students process mathematics tasks so the move toward digital assessment can be managed effectively within classrooms to promote assessment for learning.  Social and geographic location and its impact on mathematics teaching and learning  Lowrie conducted research with Professor Robyn Jorgensen through an ARC grant from 2012-2014 for a large-scale mathematics research project that aims to better understand the factors that impact on student learning in mathematics, specifically teachers' practices in creating strong learning environments. The results of the study helped understanding around how social and geographic location may impact on mathematics teaching and learning.  Promoting mathematics engagement and learning opportunities for disadvantaged communities in West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia  A $3,400,000 research project that aims to advance innovative practices that will build teachers' capacity in mathematics teaching and engage Grade 7-9 students, particularly girls, in mathematics learning in West Nusa Tenggara (NTB), Indonesia (the Country's second most disadvantaged province). The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade funded the project, from their Government Partnership for Foreign Development (GPFD) scheme. Other partners include: IKIP Mataram (The Institute of Teacher Training and Education); The Provincial Office of the Ministry of Education Sports and Youth in West Nusa Tenggara (DIKPORA); Institute for Education Quality Assurance (LPMP); and the Provincial Office of Ministry of Religion (DEPAG).

Best known for his service under Oliver Hazard Perry during the 1813 Battle of Lake Erie, he served in the United States Navy for another 33 years, including as a paymaster for over two decades. Early life Thomas Breese was born in Newport, Rhode Island, on November 4, 1793, the son of a British army officer, Major John Breese (1738–1799), and Elizabeth Malbone (1755–1832). His mother was the daughter of Colonel Francis Malbone (1727–1785), one of Newport's wealthiest shipping merchants, and Margaret Saunders (1730–1775). The Malbones lived in an opulent house on Thames Street, which the Colonel had had built in 1760. The British occupied the house during the Revolutionary War. Major Breese was among the officers stationed there. He fell in love with the Malbones' daughter Elizabeth, and, returning to England after the war, resigned his commission and returned to Newport to marry her. He had obtained the position of British vice consul at Newport. The Breeses had eight children, of whom Thomas was the youngest son. When he was six, his father died. Despite the Malbones' wealth and connections, Thomas Breese was concerned during his early years to help support his mother and siblings. He first went to work at T & W Wickham Company, a New York-based shipping company. Thomas Wickham, its principal, was originally from Newport and an old friend of the Malbone family. After the Embargo of 1807 gradually bankrupted Wickham's business, Breese was forced to return to Newport. Newport was a small close-knit seagoing community, with numerous longstanding ties among its families. The Breeses and Wickhams were members of Newport's Trinity Church (Episcopal), as was the family of Breese's future mentor and patron, Oliver Hazard Perry. Both Breese and Perry were baptized at Trinity as young boys. Their lifelong connection was characteristic of the clannishness that was a feature of the early naval service. Naval career Breese's longing for a life at sea led him to ask Perry for an appointment as his personal clerk. Perry was in command of a flotilla of ships at Newport RI when the War of 1812 began. Early in 1813, Perry received orders to go to the Great Lakes. Almost 150 sailors from the Newport area, including Thomas Breese, were sent there with him. The sailors made the arduous trip to Presque Isle, Pennsylvania, on the shore of Lake Erie, in February and March 1813. From March through August of that year, Breese served as Perry's clerk during the time required to build the Lake Erie fleet and prepare it for battle. Breese's signature appears on letters he wrote for Perry, indicating his knowledge of Perry's leadership and management of the endeavor. Perry appointed Breese the fleet's chaplain, which gave him a higher salary and a berth with the officers on board ship. During the ensuing naval battle with the British, Breese served as the commander's aide, along with Perry's younger brother, James Alexander Perry. During the combat, Bresse was assigned to Perry's flagship, the . The Battle of Lake Erie, sometimes called the Battle of Put-in-Bay, was fought on 10 September 1813. Thomas assisted in firing the last operational gun on the Lawrence before it went down. Breese was also likely one of the officers who rowed the longboat that carried Perry roughly half-mile (0.8 km), when the sinking of the Lawrence forced him to transfer his command to the . Many paintings show the other aide, James Alexander Perry, in the boat too. Perry departing the Lawrence in a 1911 painting by Edward Percy Moran with sailors who could row the boat. After the battle, Breese, as chaplain, was responsible for conducting the services for those who had died. Using the rites of the Episcopal Book of Common Prayer, he presided over the September 11 burial of common seamen in Lake Erie. The following day, September 12, the American and British officers were buried together at Put-in-Bay. (Breese was listed as a chaplain in the ship's record, but he served as both chaplain and clerk, which was an official rating of the United States Navy beginning in 1794. Clerks for commanders of naval vessels were termed the captain's clerk.) Breese received a share of the prize money allotted to the crew; he directed that the money (which amounted to over $1200) be sent to his mother in Newport. Along with other officers, he was also given a medal and a sword for his role. Breese was subsequently promoted to the rank of purser, thanks to the efforts of Commodore Perry, who sought promotions for all of his crew. To become a purser required serving at least one year as a captain's clerk, helping with the captain's correspondence and records. Between his time with Perry at Newport and the nine months on Lake Erie, Breese had fulfilled this requirement. The purser had charge of the stores and accounts on board ship. Breese was stationed at Boston when his new commission became effective on July 8, 1815. During the Second Barbary War, Breese served in the Mediterranean under Perry on the frigate . After the conclusion of that war and until 1825, Breese served mainly aboard the . In Newport on May 25, 1825, Thomas Breese married Lucy Marie Randolph, daughter of Richard K. Randolph. Randolph was a nephew of future president William Henry Harrison. Among the Breeses' children was Kidder Breese, who also became a respected naval officer. In 1825, Breese was appointed navy paymaster in Newport, a post he held to the end of his career. A drinking song, \\"Here's a health to thee, Tom Breese,\\" written in 1830 and dedicated to him, became popular among sailors. Thomas Breese died October 11, 1846, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He is buried in Island Cemetery in Newport.

Davis was jumped and beaten with a sock stuffed full of soap bars, resulting in a badly broken jaw. Davis decided to form a gang in order to protect himself, and other white inmates, from the black and Latino gangs. 211 Crew began as a deception to fool black and Latino gangs into thinking that a white gang was present to protect white inmates. As the rumor grew within the institution, men soon started asking about membership and 211 Crew became a prison gang. As members got released they started recruiting on the street level. Racism and ideology When founded, the gang took on Irish, Nazi and Viking identities and some members tattoo themselves with shamrocks, Viking horns, swastikas and other Nazi symbolism. Gang members, who refer to each other as \\"Irishmen\\", are banned from having sex with non-whites, and it is alleged they have ties to the Aryan Brotherhood, leading many to classify it as a white supremacist prison gang.

However, 211 Crew gang members have also been linked to racially motivated murders against African Americans, making the gang's official stance on race unclear.

Growing to tall by wide, it is a small spreading subshrub with strongly aromatic leaves, and lilac pink flowers in early summer. The specific epithet pulegioides highlights its similarity to another species within Lamiaceae, Mentha pulegium (pennyroyal). Description Broad-leaved thyme is a creeping dwarf evergreen shrub with woody stems and a taproot. It is rather similar to wild thyme (Thymus serpyllum) but it is larger, the leaves are wider and all the stems form flowering shoots. The reddish stems are squarish in cross- section and have hairs on the edges. The leaves are in opposite pairs with short stalks, and the linear ovate blades have tapering bases and untoothed margins. The plant flowers in July and August. The usually pink or mauve flowers form rounded umbels and each has a tube-like calyx and an irregular straight-tubed, hairy corolla. The upper petal is notched and the lower one is larger than the two lateral petals and has three flattened lobes which form a lip. Each flower has four projecting stamens and two fused carpels. The fruit is a dry, four-chambered schizocarp. Distribution and habitat Broad-leaved thyme is native to temperate parts of Europe. It grows in rough places on light, sparse soils. These include hills, rocky outcrops, gravels, sandy places, wasteground and roadsides. Cultivation Suitable for cultivation in any well-drained alkaline or neutral soil in full sun, this ornamental thyme is useful as groundcover, but can also be used like thyme in cooking. Numerous cultivars have been selected, of which 'Aureus', with lemon-scented gold leaves, and 'Bertram Anderson' have both gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

In the Togo and Benin regions, the following rock types have been identified: metasandstones, schists, metasilexites, metasiltstones, metaconglomerates, metatillites, carbonate rocks or marbles, ultramafic rocks, metajaspillites, metahematites, quartzites, quartz schists, micaschists, gneisses, migmatites, amphibolites, granites, charnockites, eclogites, metabasalts, calc-silicate rocks and pyroxenites.  Economic geology  In northwestern Benin, gold is mineralized in conglomerates of quartzite of the Togo Group. In addition to artisanal gold mining, geological materials for industry and construction are mined. In Goumpere, nickel, copper, chromium, and cobalt have been detected by the observance of geochemical anomalies. Additionally, 123 million tons of limestone have been observed in the Oueme district which could be used for cement and lime. There is also 33 million tons of sandstone available that could be used for ballast. Uranium and iron ore have been discovered in the region as well.

She was tortured, urged to reject Christianity, and, when she refused, thrown into the sea. She is commemorated on April 2.http://www.boston-catholic- journal.com/roman-martrylogy-in-english/roman-martyrology-april-in- english.htm#April_2nd Background There are two extant versions of Eusebius' Martyrs of Palestine, and in both the shorter and the longer versions, the story of Theodosia is recounted, though with variations. Eusebius was present in Caesarea during the persecutions, part of the empire- wide campaign to suppress Christianity. For five years, the governor Urbanus had sought to enforce the orders of the Emperors that all should perform sacrifices to the Roman gods, upon pain of death. Martyrdom Theodosia of Tyre, icon From Tyre, Lebanon, the seventeen-year-old Theodosia had made her way to Caesarea in Palestine. On Easter Day, 307, according to Eusebius, she went to the public square where a number of Christians were in chains awaiting interrogation. She congratulated them and asked to be remembered in their prayers. Seized by the guards and brought before the governor, he ordered her to sacrifice to the gods, and when she would not, he had her tortured with \\"cruel combs\\" on her side and breasts, and \\"she was torn on the ribs until her bowels were seen.\\" The governor, seeing that she endured these tortures uncomplainingly, appealed to her to perform sacrifices to the gods and be released, but, according to Eusebius, she replied that she had purposely come there and spoken to the Christians under guard in the square for the express purpose of being put to death by the authorities: \\"Why, oh man, dost thou deceive thyself, and not perceive that I have found the thing which I prayed to obtain at thy hands? For I rejoice greatly in having been deemed worthy to be admitted to the participation of the sufferings of God's martyrs: for indeed, for this very cause, I stood up and spake with them, in order that by some means or other they might make me a sharer in their sufferings.\\" Whereupon she was thrown into the sea. After her death Eusebius says that Urbanus had spent all his fury on the young girl and so the Christians she had spoken to who were under interrogation were sent as slaves to work in copper mines, without any torture being inflicted on them. Martyrs who deliberately sought execution It was the teaching of the church that martyrs would go immediately to heaven, be rewarded with a martyr's crown, and sit by the throne of God, unlike others, who would have to wait for the Day of Judgement. For this reason, some Christians deliberately confronted Roman persecuting authorities with the aim of being condemned to death. In the shorter version of Martyrs of Palestine, Eusebius relates the story of six young men who, hearing that Urbanus had condemned some Christians to suffer death by wild beasts in the arena, appeared before him, to his astonishment, with their hands already tied, proclaimed themselves to be Christians, and demanded to share their fellow Christians' fate. Urban had them imprisoned and then decapitated.

It is one of the 5 international research sites established by the Department of Defense (DoD) United States HIV Research Program (MHRP), a program centered at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) in Silver Spring, Maryland. MUWRP’s main facility is centrally located in Kampala, near the Makerere University College of Health Sciences where the MUWRP laboratory is located. The main facility includes the clinic, administrative and data offices. MUWRP Mission Statement To monitor and investigate communicable disease threats of public health importance to Uganda; and develop, evaluate and provide interventions to mitigate these disease threats. Background In May 1998, the Honorable Crispus Kiyonga, the former Ugandan Minister of Health formally invited the US Army to conduct HIV and malaria research within Uganda. A program for vaccine research and development began in 1998 with the US Military HIV Research Program (MHRP) and the Henry M Jackson Foundation (HJF) forming a partnership with Makerere University. Initial collaborations were with the Rakai Project (currently the Rakai Health Sciences Program ), a collaboration between Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, Makerere University (MU) and the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) where the focus was development of infrastructure and definition of cohorts. In June 2002 a memorandum of understanding between Makerere University and The Henry M. Jackson Foundation was signed establishing Makerere University Walter Reed Project (MUWRP) as a non-profit partnership for purposes of conducting collaborative HIV and other research studies. Since 1998, collaborative HIV research between Makerere University and the USMHRP has focused on development of infrastructure, definition of cohorts, acquisition of appropriate products for evaluation, and clinical evaluation of these products. The core of the Makerere University Walter Reed Program's effort has been to accomplish all activities required for initiation of phase III trials. A key component of these activities has been provision of HIV care including anti-retroviral treatment (ARV) through funding under the PEPFAR Program. Since 2007, MUWRP has broadened their scope of work to address other communicable disease threats as well. In 2007, MUWRP joined with the DoD Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (GEIS) operated by the United States Army Institute of Research – Kenya (USARMR-K) to support Avian Influenza Pandemic Influenza (AIPI) surveillance activities in Uganda. This DoD-GEIS program was established in 1996 to strengthen the prevention of, surveillance of and response to emerging infectious diseases. The current MUWRP program supports surveillance of influenza and other emerging infections in animals and humans and collaborates with the Makerere University College of Veterinary Medicine Animal Resources and Bio-security (COVAB), Ministry of Health, Nature Uganda, CDC, USAID, the MU School of Public Health, St. Jude Children’s Hospital, Memphis and the Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF). In 2013 MUWRP agreed to support the Austere environment Consortium for Enhanced Sepsis Outcomes (ACESO). ACESO is composed of collaborators primarily from university, government and military-based institutions within the US and Uganda and aims to improve survival of patients with severe infections by 1) developing evidence-based guidelines for management of clinical syndromes from severe infections; 2) increasing understanding of the pathogenesis and related host- mediated pathways associated with common and/or dangerous infectious agents; and 3) applying the research-based findings to improve outcomes in other less predictable clinical settings (such as an Ebola outbreak in Uganda). Activities Vaccine studies MUWRP has conducted a number of HIV vaccine trials and an Ebola/Marburg vaccine trial, all of which were conducted in accordance with GCP/ICH. Additionally, cohort studies have been conducted in the general population and among most at risk populations to establish HIV prevalence, incidence, risk behavior, cohort retention and host genetics and viral diversity for purposes of vaccine development and future vaccine testing. The vaccine research work is supported by a laboratory located on the Makerere University College of Health Sciences campus. The Lab was accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) in June 2005 and continues to be recertified every two years (most recently until 2013). The lab has the clinical capacity for Safety labs, Diagnostic Serology and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Viral Load, Immunophenotyping and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) processing, including cryopreservation. The MUWRP laboratory continues to provide training and research opportunities to many students from Ugandan universities and various research organizations throughout the country and also supports external research projects. Pepfar MUWRP has been working in Uganda in the provision of HIV care, treatment, and prevention services since 2005 to ensure sustainable, quality and comprehensive HIV services for communities that have participated or could participate in research studies. Due to the success of the initial program in Kayunga district and the recent in-country programming MUWRP’s PEPFAR program now includes Mukono and Buvuma districts. Cross-cutting HIV programs include: expanding the number of HIV clinical sites, provision of efficient laboratory capacity, infrastructure remodeling, District-level data system strengthening, supply-chain management strengthening, human capacity development, innovative task shifting, youth-focused and most at risk programs, short-term technical staffing, comprehensive home-based Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) services, and a variety of counseling and testing and prevention programs including medical male circumcision and mother to child prevention. Emerging Infectious Diseases' Program MUWRP has established capabilities for influenza surveillance that has since expanded to cover other emerging and re-emerging infectious. The human influenza surveillance is conducted at Mulago, the national referral hospital and Jinja and Gulu regional referral hospitals. The non-human component collects samples at various locations from water and domestic fowl and swine. The project renovated two BSL laboratories; one at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) for the human samples and one at the Makerere University College of Veterinary Medicines Animal Resources and Biosecurity (COVAB) for animal samples. The surveillance activities are part of laboratory based influenza surveillance networks around the world, which serves to: #detect local influenza outbreaks, #provide isolates for the WHO vaccine pool for vaccine component and 3) detect any emerging strains that could be pandemic potential.

Process Dough is compressed between two or more rotating rollers. When done the right way, a smooth and consistent dough sheet is produced. The dough then passes one or several gauging rollers (mostly on conveyors) that reduce the dough to the required thickness. After this the dough sheet is shaped into a desired dough product. This technology is mainly used in industrial production machines for (semi) industrial bakeries and the food industry. Most dough sheeters can handle a wide variety of dough depending on the machine manufacturer. Most commonly dough sheeting technology is used for the production of laminated dough products like croissants and pastries, but it is also suitable for the production of bread, flatbread and pizza. Function * Shape the dough from individual dough batch to continuous dough sheet * Less damaging of the gluten network * Laminate layers of dough together (no pocket proofers and dividers are necessary as the dough sheet is the base of every product). Benefits A big benefit for using sheeting technology is the large dough capacity that can be handled. Dough sheeting manufactures are able to process high quality dough sheets at high capacities. Another benefit is that sheeting makes it possible to handle a great variety of dough types which traditional dough production systems can't handle, for example strongly hydrated wet and sticky ciabatta dough. History The origin of the dough sheeting process is not specifically traced back to at least 1977 in the case of Rademaker BV, who may be considered to be one of the earliest dough sheeting technology specialists. Croissants and puff pastry were first products to have been produced with dough sheeting technology.

Creation In the 1860s and 1870s, agitation for the establishment of a trust on the lines of those on the Mersey at Liverpool, and especially the Clyde Navigation Trust (which was run by Glasgow's leading merchants), came predominantly from the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce. However, Williamstown and Geelong interests opposed the measure, while Alfred Clark (the member of parliament for Williamstown) warned \\"...if ships were to be taken up the river then grass will grow on the piers and streets of Williamstown.\\" The trust reflected Melbourne mercantile interests but the government was hostile towards it.Melbourne Harbor Trust eMelbourne encyclopedia by David Dunstan At the time there was little coordinated management or development of Melbourne ports facilities, with a variety of privately built wharves and jetties constructed along the Yarra River, as well as piers at Sandridge (Port Melbourne) and Williamstown. Vessel movements and berthings, navigational aids, and wharfage rates, were the responsibility of the Ports and Harbours Branch under the Department of Trade and Customs. The trust was created after several boards of inquiry into means to improve access for shipping to Melbourne, and a specific Act of Parliament was finally passed in 1876.The Melbourne Harbor Trust Act 40 Vict., No.5523 (1876) The first appointment of fifteen commissioners, who represented various interests in the Port, was on 30 March 1877, with a meeting on 11 April 1877 to elect office bearers: James Lorimer being appointed the Trust's first chairman.

Coode produced a scheme involving a large dock basin (Victoria Dock) and bypassing a large bend in the river through a new cut, now known as the Coode Canal. However, the works could not commence until 1883 when a coalition government united the previously opposing groups. Under Coode's Plan, heavily modified by the Trust's own engineer, Joseph Brady,C. F. Kerr, 'Brady, Joseph (1828–1908)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 16 April 2013. the Yarra was deepened and cleared of obstructions, and the Coode Canal was excavated, opening in 1886. Excavation of Victoria Dock was underway in 1891, opening in 1896. The Trust also undertook the filling of the Sandridge Lagoon and dredging the deep-water channel to the Port Melbourne piers. Dock construction under the original harbour trust scheme continued into the 1920s.of Melbourne History Onlymelbourne By 1927 the trust was employing more than 1000 men Melbourne, and was the eighth largest deep-water port in the British Empire. After 1945 new facilities were developed downstream, including Appleton (1956), Webb (1960) and Swanson (1969) docks, each of which was named after chairman of the trust - William Thomas Appleton (1859-1930), chairman 5 April 1911 to 22 January 1913; John Percival Webb OBE chairman from 27 May 1941 to 31 August 1971; and Victor Swanson,1960-72.Public Records Office Victoria, VPRS 8356 Consignment number: P0002Victor George Swanson, 1910-1962 Other commissioners and chairmen included the following: * Sir William Murray Mcpherson 30/5/1902 - 22/1/1913 & 4/2/1913 - 20/2/1914 * William Thomas Appleton 28/11/1906 - 22/1/1913 & 4/2/1913 - 16/2/1930 Chairman 5/4/1911 - 22/1/1913 * James Arthur Boyd 4/2/1913 - 12/4/1941 * Henry Meeks 21/2/1914 - 6/8/1922 * William Andrews 15/8/1922 - 1/9/1924 * Francis Duncan 9/9/1924 - 22/1/1951 * George Kermode Chairman 29/8/1934 - 30/6/1940 * Charles A Phayer 4/2/1937 - 30/6/1947 * Aubrey Duncan Mckenzie Chairman 1/7/1940 - 3/3/1960 * John Percival Webb Chairman 27/5/1941 - 31/8/1971 * Albert George Allnutt 1/7/1947 - 30/6/1950 Functions The purpose of the trust was ...to provide for the Regulation, Management and Improvement of the Port of Melbourne and certain portions of the River Yarra Yarra and certain portions of the Saltwater River....[including the regulation of the trade of the port with respect to such matters as landing of shipping of merchandise, arrivals and departures of vessels, wharfage rates...management of port facilities, [and] improvements to the port.Public Records Office Victoria, Agency VA2799, Melbourne Harbor Trust Commissioners Development and reconstitution Two additional commissioners were appointed on 14 November 1883.Melbourne Harbor Trust Act Further Amendment Act 47 Vic., No.763 1883 Until 1900 the Melbourne Harbor Trust Commissioners were responsible to the Commissioner of Trade and Customs, and afterwards to the Minister for Public Works. There was a major reconstitution of the trust in 1913 whereby seventeen elected commissioners were replaced with five commissioners appointed by the Governor-in-Council. These five included a full-time Chairman and four representatives of ship owners, exporters, importers and primary producers. The trust also gained responsibility for the railway piers at Port Melbourne and Williamstown from 1 December 1913, bringing all the wharves, piers and jetties within the Port of Melbourne under the one authority. A sixth commissioner was appointed to represent port workers in 1954, perhaps indicating the growing influence of the Dockworkers Union. Port of Melbourne Authority The trust was reorganised in 1978 to form the Port of Melbourne Authority, in line with modern organizational naming practice around the world, although its functions did not change greatly. It moved from its grand 1930 Market Street head office to the World Trade Centre (Melbourne) in 1983. Subsequent restructuring in 1997 saw the Melbourne Port Corporation take over property and assets, the Victorian Channels Authority berthing responsibilities, and Melbourne Port Services privatised and put out to tender. The Port of Melbourne Corporation was formed on 1 July 2003, taking over the Melbourne Port Corporation, and the Victorian Channels Authority.Port of Melbourne Corporation Facilities Maintenance workshops erected in Williamstown.

She was spotted by the officers of Forte and identified as a British frigate,Troude, p.171 but Beaulieu-Leloup insisted that she was another East Indiaman and sent his crew to sleep for the night. It was only when Sybilles intent to intercept became evident that Beaulieu-Leloup called to battle stations; even then, he closed in and ordered a restrained attack, firing his guns one by one to test his opponent. Cooke reserved his fire and manoeuvered into a raking position before delivering a broadside into the stern of Forte. In the damage, confusion and smoke caused by Sybilles fire, Forte began to mistakenly fire her starboard battery at one of her own prizes, leaving Sybille free to come about and deliver a second raking broadside from her other battery. The two frigates then began trading broadsides at close range, mortally wounding Cooke at 1:30; ten minutes later, Beaulieu-Leloup was killed by a cannonball. After Beaulieu-Leloup's death, command of Forte passed to Lieutenant Vigoureux, who was killed himself at 2:00.Troude, p.172 Lieutenant Luco took over and attempted to manoeuver Forte, but her entire rigging collapsed, putting an end to her resistance. Sybille hailed to inquire whether Forte had struck, and ceased fire when this was confirmed.

It was formed from the 8th Cavalry Corps in February 1943.  Second World War   8th Cavalry Corps  The 8th Cavalry Corps was created on 18 January 1942 at Tula.Perechen No.4, p. 121. Lieutenant General Pavel Korzun took command.Bonn, Keith E. Slaughterhouse: Handbook of the Eastern Front. Bedford, PA: Aberjona Press, 2005, p. 347 It was initially composed of the * 21st Mountain Cavalry Division, * 52nd Cavalry Division, * 55th Cavalry Division. Immediately upon forming the 8th Cavalry Corps was assigned to the Bryansk Front. During the winter fighting in February - March 1942 the Corps controlled the 36th and 37th Ski Battalions. By the end of March 1942 the ski battalions and the 52nd Cavalry Division were gone. In April the corps was rebuilt: * 21st Mountain Cavalry Division * 55th Cavalry Division * 112th Cavalry Division * 148th Artillery-Mortar Regiment * 263rd Horse Artillery Battalion (76mm guns and mortars) The Corps completed its reorganization in June 1942. In July it went into battle with Bryansk Front against the northern flank of the German summer offensive. After a month of hard fighting the corps went back into reserve. In October it moved south and was assigned to the 5th Tank Army in November for Operation Uranus.Perechen No.6 13th Separate Signals Battalion, and 23rd signals air-flight. The Corps was assigned to the Southwestern Front’s in the area of the 5th Tank Army (2nd formation) (Serafimovich) north of Stalingrad where it cooperated with the 1st Tank Corps (General V. V. Butkov) during Operation Uranus.Glantz, Soviet Military Deception, p. 115 in which they had the task of cutting the rail road in the region of the stations Bolshaya Osipovka, Surovikino, and Oblivskaya. Attached to the Corps was: * 174th Antitank Regiment * 179th Antitank Regiment * 35th Guards Mortar Regiment (BM-13) * 586th Antiaircraft Regiment (37mm guns) * 511th Flamethrower Tank Battalion During 1943, on January 30 from the area of the Seversky Donets river the Corps went over to the offensive in the direction of Voroshilovgrad (now Lugansk) as part of the 3rd Guards Army under the command of lieutenant general Dmitry Lelyushenko, where it was engaged in furious fighting on the approaches to the city. At dawn on February 14 began the assault, as a result of which the first provincial city in central Ukraine was liberated. Although the main role in this operation was played by the 59th, 243rd, 279th Guard rifle divisions, 2nd Guard and 2nd Tank Corps, active assistance in the liberation of Lugansk was rendered by the 8th Cavalry Corps now under the command of General Major M.D. Borisov. The Corps was assigned by the Soviet Southwestern Front to break through German lines at Debaltsevo near the city and cut German communications.Michael Parrish, Sacrifice of the Generals: Soviet Senior Officer Losses 1939-1953, p.54 On the night of February 8, 1943, the Corps accomplished this and by February 14 the raid had been so successful that the whole corps was raised to Guards status. The Corps became 7th Guards Cavalry Corps, and its three divisions, the 21, 35, and 112 became the 14th, 15th and 16th Guards Cavalry Divisions. During the raid the corps also included the 148th Mortar Regiment, the 263d Separate Cavalry Artillery Battalion, and the 8th Separate Antitank Artillery Battalion.A.A.

After a week of dodging German patrols the Corps slipped back through Soviet lines, having disrupted the rear areas and movement of most of a Panzer Corps. After returning to Soviet lines and due to the heavy losses from Stalingrad offensive and the cavalry raid the Corps was sent into the reserves to rebuild. Between March and May 1943 the corps was reinforced and rebuilt in the Southwestern Front. The corps sent north to join the Steppe Front in the STAVKA Reserves in June consisting of: * 14th Guards Cavalry Division * 15th Guards Cavalry Division * 16th Guards Cavalry Division * 145th Guards Antitank Regiment (76mm) * 57th Guards Mortar Battalion (rockets) * 7th Guards Antitank Battalion * 1773rd Antiaircraft Regiment The Corps was not committed in the first part of the summer offensive after Kursk, remaining in STAVKA reserves until September. Assigned to the 61st Army on 19 September 1943 the corps had added the 1897th SU Regiment (SU-76s) and the 7th Guards Mortar Regiment (120mm mortars). From late September 1943 to March 1944 the corps operated in the 61ast or 65th Armies of the Belorussian Front, trying to enlarge the penetration south of Gomel. In January 1944 the 1897th SU Regiment was replaced by the 1816th SU Regiment (Su-76s), which remained in the Corps until the end of the war. On 5 March 1944 the Corps was sent to the 2nd Belorussian Front reserves, and in April helped clear the Germans out of the Mozyr and River Turya areas, clearing the south edges of the Pripyet marshes for operations later in the summer. On 17 May 1944 the Corps went to the 1st Belorussian Front in the area of Brest and Kobrin. On 14 July 1944 Operation Bagration began with the Corps advancing with the 2nd Tank Army,. By the end of the week the corps had advanced 200 km, south of Lublin to Radom. The front line stabilized and the corps was on the defensive from 8 August 1944 to 7 January 1945. When the Vistula-Oder offensive started in January 1945 the 1st Belorussian Front formed the Konstantinov Cavalry-Mechanized Group under the 7th Guards Cavalry Commander, Lieutenant General Mikhail Konstantinov. The group consisted of: * 7th Guards Cavalry Corps ** 14th Guards Cavalry Division ** 15th Guards Cavalry Division ** 16th Guards Cavalry Division ** 1816th SU Regiment ** 145th Guards Antitank Regiment (76mm) ** 1773rd Antiaircraft Regiment ** 7th Guards Antitank Battalion ** 57th Guards Mortar Battalion (rockets) * 7th Guards Mortar Regiment * 9th Tank Corps ** 23rd Tank Brigade (T-34/85) ** 95th Tank Brigade (T-34/85) ** 108th Tank Brigade (T-34/85) ** 8th Motorized Rifle Brigade ** 36th Guards Heavy Tanks Regiment (IS-IIs) ** 1445th SU Regiment ** 1508th SU Regiment ** 868th Light Artillery Regiment ** 216th Antiaircraft Regiment ** 218th Mortar Regiment (120mm) ** 286th Guards Mortar Battalion (rockets) ** 90th Motorcycle Battalion This group advanced over 400 km from the center of the 1st Belorussian front to the Oder River in just 17 days. The group then turned north into Pomerania, where it spent two months clearing the flanks of the Soviet penetration of German lines. In April and May 1945 the Group advanced as part of the Berlin Strategic Operation operating independently weeping north of the city to seize Brandenburg and then continuing on to meet advancing units of the US 9th Army. = Commanders = * 25.02.1943 — 20.03.1943 Richard Ivanovich Golovanovsky, * 21.03.1943 — 04.06.1943 Yakov Sergeevich Sharaburko, * 07.06.1943 — 06.10.1943 Mikhail Maleyev, * 07.10.1943 — 09.05.1945 Mikhail Petrovich Konstantinov  Postwar  The corps' 15th Guards Cavalry Division was converted into the 12th Guards Mechanized Division and transferred to another unit. In the fall of 1945 the corps, with the 14th and 16th Divisions, was transferred from Brest in the Belorussian Military District to Nakhchivan in the Baku Military District. In January 1946, the corps was converted into the 31st Guards Mechanized Division. The 14th and 16th Divisions were reduced to the 98th and 99th Guards Mechanized Regiments, respectively. In the spring of that year the 31st Guards became part of the 4th Army. In the spring of 1957 the division became the 25th Guards Motor Rifle Division, and on 17 November 1964 it was renumbered as the 23rd Guards Motor Rifle Division.

History The church was built as part of a substantial housing development on land given by the construction company Wates. The foundation stone was laid on 19 September 1964 by Norman Wates. During the construction, Wates provided access to a workmen's hut for the new and rapidly growing congregation to worship in. Architect Ralph Covell based the design on the six-pointed Star of David creating an hexagonal space for worship to bring congregation and clergy closer together, as encouraged by the Second Vatican Council. The triangular points of the star form, clockwise from the east, the entrance, lady chapel, parish room (Nash Room), vestry, kitchen and children's area. Henry Haig, then teaching at Kingston School of Art, was commissioned to create the fourteen stained glass windows. Haig also painted the sacristy doors and made the original processional cross. The non- figurative designs of the windows and paintings are inspired by aspects of the life and work of St Richard. (Information sheet) The pair of window panels behind the altar of the lady chapel depict the chalice of St Richard. Running clockwise from there the next window depicts the miracle of the fishes. The following pair represent St Richard's gentleness and humour. The ruling bishop's mitre features in the next panel. The next three panels, to the right of the altar, are a group that show St Richard's power and strength in the outer panels with the central one representing the initial suppression of Richard's power by Henry III. The following panel represents St Richard's miracle at Candlemas and the next two represent St Richard the gardener and the growth of plants. The next depicts birth whilst the pair flanking the entrance represent St Richard's death with one showing hands pressing down on the chalice and releasing the soul whilst the other shows gifts left at the tomb. The tracker organ with electric blower, single manual keyboard, small pedal keyboard and nine stops, originally made in about 1900 by Bevington and Sons of London, was rebuilt in the church in 1965 by N.

The kitchen and disabled facilities were improved in 1998. The children's area was developed in 2003 with the addition of folding screens and a mural. A large wooden cross that stands on the mound outside the church was constructed by local young people during 2006. Church activities A weekly Parish Communion is held at 10 am on Sunday and is followed by tea and coffee. A Said Communion is held on Tuesday at 10 a.m. Community use The church is linked to the adjacent St Richard's CE Primary School who use the church for assemblies and other activities. The church space is also used by various community groups as well as those connected with the church. Users include a play group, a choir and a martial arts group.

He is known as a Cambridge Platonist and associate of Jeremy Taylor. Life He was a native of Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. from St. Catharine's Hall early in 1647. He became a fellow of Christ's College in 1649, and proceeded M.A. in 1650. He belonged to the Cambridge Platonist school; among his friends at Christ's were Sir John Finch and Henry More. He was also close to Joseph Glanvill. Rust gave up his fellowship in 1659. Soon after the Restoration of 1660, he was invited to Ireland by Jeremy Taylor, ordained deacon and priest on 7 May 1661, and made dean of Connor in August. In 1662 he was presented by the crown to the rectory of Island Magee. On 20 October 1663, preaching at Newtownards at the funeral of Hugh Montgomery, 1st Earl of Mount Alexander, Rust remarked, \\"New presbyter is but old priest writ large\\"; John Milton's sonnet containing the same line was not published till 1673. In 1664 he was rector of Lisburn, where Edward Conway, 1st Earl of Conway lived. In 1665 he visited Conway in England, when Valentine Greatrakes was trying to cure Lady Conway's headaches. Jeremy Taylor died at Lisburn on 13 August 1667, and Rust preached a well-known funeral sermon. In succession to Taylor, Rust was appointed bishop of Dromore by patent in November 1667, and consecrated in Christ Church, Dublin, on 15 December. He died of fever in the prime of life in December 1670, and was buried in the choir of Dromore Cathedral in the same vault with his friend Taylor. Works In 1655 Rust delivered a Latin discourse in Great St. Mary's, Cambridge, in answer to Pontius Pilate's question \\"What is Truth?\\" At the commencement of 1658 he maintained in the same place the thesis that scripture teaches the resurrection of the body, and that reason does not refute it. Rust said he had studied all creeds, and preferred the Church of England. His works are: * A Letter of Resolution concerning Origen, London, 1661. This work defends the doctrine of pre-existence of Origen, and was censured by Theophilus Dillingham. It also touched on apocatastasis. * Sermon on ii. Tim. i. 10, preached at Newtown, 20 Oct. 1663, at the Funeral of Hugh, earl of Mount Alexander, Dublin, 1664. * Sermon at Jeremy Taylor's Funeral, Dublin, 1667; many later editions. It was included by Reginald Heber in vol. i. of Taylor's Works. * A Discourse of Truth, London, 1677; another edition, with notes and a preface by Joseph Glanvill, was published by James Collins, London, 1682. This is not identical with Rust's discourse delivered at Cambridge in 1655. * A Discourse of the Use of Reason in Matters of Religion, showing that Christianity contains nothing repugnant to Right Reason, against Enthusiasts and Deists, London, 1683; the Latin original edited by Henry Hallywell, with a translation, notes, and a dedication to Henry More. * Remains, edited by Henry Hallywell and dedicated to his diocesan John Lake, London, 1686. Glanvill said that Rust gave a new turn to Cambridge studies, going back to \\"primitive learning and theology\\". Hallywell wrote that he was familiar with Kabbalah.

He is currently Professor Emeritus in Electronic & Digital Art at the University of Central Lancashire and Visiting Professor at the Centre for Moving image Research (CMIR) at the University of the West of England. Education and early career Born in Essex, England on 30 July 1952, Meigh-Andrews lived in Montreal, Canada from 1957-75. Upon his return to England, he studied photography, film & video at the London College of Printing. His first art exhibition was part of the group photography show New British Image at Newcastle's Side Gallery in 1977. Beginning in 1978, Meigh- Andrews began producing art using video as a medium, creating solo and collaborative exhibitions that expanded into sculptural installations. From 1981-1983, he attended Goldsmiths, earning an MA in Fine Art. In 2001, he was awarded a PhD from the Royal College of Art. The theme of renewable energy The Minories Galleries Many of the artist's more recent works have featured renewable energy sources intended to power the works and interact with the gallery space. 1994's Perpetual Motion featured a video monitor powered by a wind turbine, with the wind being supplied by a fan plugged into the gallery's power. Mothlight (1998) and Mothlight II (2001) featured solar-powered video screens powered by halogen lights. His 2002 installation 2002, For William Henry Fox Talbot (The Pencil of Nature) consisted of a solar-powered video camera at Lacock Abbey, reproducing a live image of William Henry Fox Talbot's 1835 photograph of a latticed window at the abbey (the world's oldest surviving photograph), then transmitted to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. 2004's Interwoven Motion was an outdoor video installation in Grizedale Forest, Cumbria, made up of a wind- and solar-powered camera and screen, it produced video images displayed on a weatherproof LCD display. 2005's Resurrection featured a series of solar panels mounted on a dead tree, powering a video display of the tree in its living form. And his 2011 installation Sunbeam used solar panels to power the projection of images of the sun from NASA’ s Solar Dynamics Observatory. Other recent works In 2009, Meigh-Andrews launched The Monument Project (Si Monumentum Requiris Circumspice). A digital video installation that ran online for three years, it consisted of a digital video camera mounted on the Monument in the City of London. The installation streamed 360-degree panoramic time lapse sequences of the city online, with displays modified by a computer in response to changes in weather. His 2012 solo project, In Darwin's Garden, was a web-based installation exhibited by the online journal Leonardo Electronic Almanac. Recorded in the grounds of the Down House in Kent, England (Charles Darwin's family home), the exhibition focused on an old mulberry tree growing behind the house. In 2013, the artist created \\"Aeolian Processes\\", an outdoor solar powered sound installation for \\"Art In Your Park\\" in Highfields Park, Nottingham, which reflected once again his underlying impulse to explore “the role of machine and its impact on human perception.” Likewise, participating in the project \\"La Lune: Energy Producing Art\\" at Long Reef in Sydney, Australia, he installed \\"Aeolian Processes II\\". Meigh-Andrews is currently Professor Emeritus at the University of Central Lancashire, directing the Electronic and Digital Art Unit (EDAU). He taught at the university from 1986-2012, first as the head of Time Based Media (1986-2000), then as a reader in Electronic and Digital Art (2000-2007), as the founder of the EDAU in 2004, and as a full professor in 2007. Awards and fellowships Meigh-Andrews was Arts Council of England International Artist Fellow in Kraków from 2003-2004. He won a research endowment from the National Endowment of Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA) in 2004. He has received British Council Travel Awards to visit Amsterdam (2004), Poland and Malta (2005). In 2010, he was awarded the Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation Award, a travel grant to visit Tokyo, Kyoto and Nagoya to research into early artists' video in Japan.

The history of equity and trusts concerns the development of the body of rules known as equity, English trust law and its spread into a modern body of trust law around Commonwealth and the United States. The law of trusts was constructed as part of \\"equity\\", a body of principles made by the Courts of Chancery, which sought to correct the strictness of the common law. The trust was an addition to the law of property, in the situation where one person held legal title to property, but the courts decided it was fair, just or \\"equitable\\" that this person be compelled to use it for the benefit of another. This recognised a split between legal and beneficial ownership: the legal owner was referred to as a \\"trustee\\" (because he was \\"entrusted\\" with property) and the beneficial owner was the \\"beneficiary\\". Ancestors to trust law Possible earliest concept of equity in land held in trust is the depiction of this ancient king ( trustor ) which grants property back to its previous owner ( beneficiary ) during her absence, supported by witness testimony ( trustee ). In essence and in this case, the king, in place of the later state ( trustor and holder of assets at highest position ) issues ownership along with past proceeds ( equity ) back to the beneficiary: *Homer, Iliad (ca 750 BC) *Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics (ca 350 BC) Book V, ch 10, Equity, a corrective of legal justice. Roman law had a well-developed concept of the trust (fideicommissum) created by wills. However, these testamentary trusts did not develop into the inter vivos (living) trusts which apply while the creator lives. This was created by later common law jurisdictions. The waqf is a similar institution in Islamic law, restricted to charitable trusts. Middle Ages The law of trusts first developed in the 12th century from the time of the crusades under the jurisdiction of the King of England. The \\"common law\\" regarded property as an indivisible entity, as it had been done through Roman law and the continental version of civil law. Where it seemed \\"inequitable\\" (i.e. unfair) to let someone with legal title hold onto it, the King's representative, the Lord Chancellor who established the Courts of Chancery, had the discretion to declare that the real owner \\"in equity\\" (i.e. in all fairness) was another person. When a landowner left England to fight in the Crusades, he conveyed ownership of his lands in his absence to manage the estate and pay and receive feudal dues, on the understanding that the ownership would be conveyed back on his return. However, Crusaders often encountered refusal to hand over the property upon their return. Unfortunately for the Crusader, English common law did not recognize his claim. As far as the King's courts were concerned, the land belonged to the trustee, who was under no obligation to return it. The Crusader had no legal claim. The disgruntled Crusader would then petition the king, who would refer the matter to his Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor could decide a case according to his conscience. At this time, the principle of equity was born. The Lord Chancellor would consider it \\"unconscionable\\" that the legal owner could go back on his word and deny the claims of the Crusader (the \\"true\\" owner). Therefore, he would find in favour of the returning Crusader. Over time, it became known that the Lord Chancellor's court (the Court of Chancery) would continually recognize the claim of a returning Crusader. The legal owner would hold the land for the benefit of the original owner, and would be compelled to convey it back to him when requested. The Crusader was the \\"beneficiary\\" and the acquaintance the \\"trustee\\". The term \\"use of land\\" was coined, and in time developed into what we now know as a \\"trust\\". In medieval English trust law, the settlor was known as the feoffor to uses while the trustee was known as the feoffee to uses and the beneficiary was known as the cestui que use, or cestui que trust.

Dudley (1705) 24 ER 117 19th century and fusion \\"Antitrust law\\" emerged in the 19th century when industries created monopolistic trusts by entrusting their shares to a board of trustees in exchange for shares of equal value with dividend rights; these boards could then enforce a monopoly. However, trusts were used in this case because a corporation could not own other companies' stock and thereby become a holding company without a \\"special act of the legislature\\". Holding companies were used after the restriction on owning other companies' shares was lifted. *Judicature Act 1873 s 11, ‘equity shall prevail’. *Indian Trusts Act 1882 *Settled Land Acts 1882-1925 Modern trusts *Federal Commerce & Navigation Co Ltd v Molena Alpha Inc, The Nanfri [1978] 1 QB 927, Lord Denning MR, ‘During that time the streams of common law and equity have flown together and combined so as to be indistinguishable the one from the other.
