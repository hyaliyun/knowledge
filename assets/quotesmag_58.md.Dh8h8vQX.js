His name is sometimes incorrectly written and pronounced as \\"Zhongli Mei\\" (ÈçæÈõ¢Êòß or ÈçæÈõ¢Áúõ). Rebelling against the Qin dynasty Zhongli Mo was from Yilu Village (in present-day Guanyun County, Lianyungang, Jiangsu). He joined Xiang Liang's rebel force in around 208 BC when uprisings erupted throughout China to overthrow the Qin dynasty. Initially a common soldier, he was later promoted to the rank of general for his outstanding bravery and prowess on the battlefield. After Xiang Liang was killed in action at the Battle of Dingtao in late 208 BC, Zhongli Mo continued to serve Xiang Liang's nephew, Xiang Yu, and became one of Xiang Yu's two most important subordinates, along with Long Ju. Zhongli Mo was a close friend of Han Xin, then serving as a low-ranking soldier in Xiang Yu's army. Zhongli Mo noticed Han Xin's talent and often recommended Han Xin to Xiang Yu, asking Xiang to promote Han to higher ranks, but Xiang disagreed with Zhongli's view and did not put Han in high regard. Han Xin left Xiang Yu later and defected over Xiang Yu's rival, Liu Bang. Han Xin's talent was recognised by Liu Bang and he was appointed by Liu as a general. Chu‚ÄìHan Contention Following the collapse of the Qin dynasty in 207 BC, Xiang Yu and Liu Bang began to engage in a power struggle for supremacy over China, historically known as the Chu‚ÄìHan Contention. Xiang Yu initially had an advantage over Liu Bang in terms of military strength, but gradually lost popularity and the tide turned in favour of Liu by 203 BC. Xiang Yu fell for a ruse by Liu Bang's strategist Chen Ping and began to doubt Zhongli Mo's loyalty towards him. Seeing that his lord no longer trusted him as before, Zhongli Mo left Xiang Yu's camp during the Battle of Gaixia, and Xiang lost the battle and committed suicide after his defeat. Liu Bang emerged victorious in the Chu‚ÄìHan Contention and unified China under his rule. He was proclaimed \\"Emperor\\" and he established the Han dynasty. Death In the meantime, Han Xin was conferred the title of \\"King of Chu\\" and was granted a vassal kingdom by Liu Bang in recognition of his contributions to the founding of the Han dynasty. Zhongli Mo became a fugitive, wanted by the Han government, and he went to join Han Xin to evade arrest. Han Xin accepted Zhongli Mo and protected him from being captured. When Liu Bang heard that Zhongli Mo had escaped and was hiding in Han Xin's house, he ordered Han to arrest Zhongli, but Han defied the order. In 201 BC, Liu Bang heard rumours that Han Xin was planning to rebel against him and intended to lead his army to attack Han. Chen Ping suggested to Liu Bang to take Han Xin by surprise instead, by disguising the attack on Han's domain as an inspection tour. One of Han Xin's followers suggested to him to capture Zhongli Mo and present him to the emperor to prove his innocence, but Han refused. Zhongli Mo told Han Xin later that both of them would die if Han captured him and presented him to the emperor, because the emperor already had suspicions about Han's loyalty. Han Xin refused to listen and Zhongli Mo committed suicide in anger. Han Xin brought Zhongli Mo's head to meet Liu Bang later, and the emperor had Han Xin arrested on charges of treason. Although Liu Bang released him later, Han Xin was still demoted to the rank of \\"Marquis of Huaiyin\\" and was eventually executed on charges of treason by Empress L√º Zhi.

The ship, named for the island of Sardinia, was laid down in La Spezia in October 1885, launched in September 1890, and completed in February 1895. She was armed with a main battery of four guns and had a top speed of ‚Äîalbeit at the cost of armor protection‚Äîand she was one of the first warships to be equipped with a wireless telegraph. Sardegna spent the first decade of her career in the Active Squadron of the Italian fleet. Thereafter, she was transferred to the Reserve Squadron, and by 1911, she was part of the Training Division. She took part in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911‚Äì1912, where she escorted convoys to North Africa and supported Italian forces ashore by bombarding Ottoman troops. During World War I, Sardegna served as the flagship of the naval forces defending Venice against a possible attack from the Austro-Hungarian Navy, which did not materialize. After the city became threatened following the Battle of Caporetto in November 1917, the ship was withdrawn to Brindisi and later Taranto, where she continued to serve as a guard ship. She took part in Allied operations in Turkey in 1919‚Äì1922, and after returning to Italy in 1923, she was broken up for scrap. Design Line-drawing of the Re Umberto class Sardegna was long overall; she had a beam of and an average draft of . She displaced normally and up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of a pair of triple-expansion steam engines, each driving a single screw propeller, with steam supplied by eighteen coal- fired, cylindrical fire-tube boilers. She was the first Italian warship to be equipped with triple expansion engines. Her propulsion system produced a top speed of at . Specific figures for her cruising radius have not survived, but the ships of her class could steam for at a speed of . She had a crew of 794 officers and men. Sardegna was one of the first warships equipped with Marconi's new wireless telegraph.Gardiner, p. 342 Sardegna was armed with a main battery of four 30-caliber guns, mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one on either end of the ship. She carried a secondary battery of eight 40-cal. guns placed singly in shielded mounts atop the upper deck, with four on each broadside. Close-range defense against torpedo boats was provided by a battery of sixteen guns in casemates in the upper deck, eight on each broadside. These were supported by twenty 43-cal. guns and ten guns. As was customary for capital ships of the period, she carried five torpedo tubes in above-water launchers. The ship was lightly armored for her size. She was protected by belt armor that was thick, an armored deck that was thick, and her conning tower was armored with of steel plate. The turrets had 4 in thick faces and the supporting barbettes had thick steel. Service history Sardegna at anchor Sardegna was named after the island of Sardinia. She was built by the Arsenale di La Spezia in La Spezia, with her keel being laid down on 24 October 1885. She was launched on 20 September 1890, and completed on 16 February 1895. After entering service, Sardegna was assigned to the 2nd Division of the Reserve Squadron as its flagship, along with the older ironclad and the torpedo cruiser . At the time, the ships of the Reserve Squadron were based in La Spezia.\\"Naval and Military Notes ‚Äì Italy\\", pp. 89‚Äì90 Sardegna joined the ironclads , Ruggiero di Lauria, and and the cruisers , , and Partenope for a visit to Spithead in the United Kingdom in July 1895.Neal, p. 155 Later that year, the squadron stopped in Germany for the celebration held to mark the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. While there, Sardegna accidentally ran aground in front of the canal, blocking the entrance for several days.Sondhaus, p. 131 For 1903, the Active Squadron was on active service for seven months, with the rest of the year spent with reduced crews.Brassey (1903), p. 60 In 1904‚Äì1905, Sardegna and her sisters were in service with the Active Squadron, which was kept in service for nine months of the year, with three months in reduced commission.\\"Naval Notes ‚Äì Italy\\", p. 1429 The following year, the ships were transferred to the Reserve Squadron, along with the three s and the ironclad , three cruisers, and sixteen torpedo boats. This squadron only entered active service for two months of the year for training maneuvers, and the rest of the year was spent with reduced crews.Brassey (1905), p. 45 Sardegna was still in the Reserve Squadron in 1908, along with her two sisters and the two s. By this time, the Reserve Squadron was kept in service for seven months of the year.Brassey (1908), p. 52 Italo-Turkish War Map showing the bombardment of Tripoli On 29 September 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire in order to seize Libya.Beehler, p. 6 At the time, Sardegna and her two sisters were assigned to the Training Division, along with the old armored cruiser , under the command of Rear Admiral Raffaele Borea Ricci D'Olmo.Beehler, p. 10 On 3‚Äì4 October, Sardegna and her sisters were tasked with bombarding Fort Sultanje, which was protecting the western approach to Tripoli. The ships used their 6-inch guns to attack the fort to preserve their stock of 13.5-inch shells. By the morning of the 4th, the ships' gunfire had silenced the guns in the fort, allowing landing forces to go ashore and capture the city.Beehler, pp. 19‚Äì20 The ships of the Training Division thereafter alternated between Tripoli and Khoms to support the Italian garrisons in the two cities; this included repulsing a major Ottoman attack on Tripoli over 23‚Äì26 October, where Sardegna and Sicilia supported the Italian left flank against concerted Ottoman assaults.Beehler, pp. 34, 37 During this engagement, Sardegna used a spotter aircraft to help direct the fire of her guns, the first time aircraft had been used in that role.Erickson, p. 349 By December, the three ships were stationed in Tripoli, where they were replaced by the old ironclads and . Sardenga and her sisters arrived back in La Spezia, where they had their ammunition and supplies replenished.Beehler, p. 47 In May 1912, the Training Division patrolled the coast, but saw no action.Beehler, p. 77 The following month, Sardegna and her sisters, along with six torpedo boats, escorted a convoy carrying an infantry brigade to Buscheifa, one of the last ports in Libya still under Ottoman control. The Italian force arrived off the town on 14 June and made a landing; after taking the city, the Italian forces then moved on to Misrata. Sardegna and the rest of the ships continued supporting the advance until the Italians had secured the city on 20 July.Beehler, p. 81 The Training Division then returned to Italy, where they joined the escort for another convoy on 3 August, this time to Zuara, the last port in Ottoman hands. The ships covered the landing two miles east of Zuara two days later, which was joined by supporting attacks from the west and south. With the capture of the city, Italy now controlled the entire Libyan coast.Beehler, pp. 90‚Äì91 On 14 October the Ottomans agreed to sign a peace treaty to end the war.Beehler, p. 95 Later career Sardegna around 1895 Italy had declared neutrality at the start of World War I, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers.Halpern, p. 140 Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the threat from Austro-Hungarian submarines and naval mines in the narrow waters of the Adriatic was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way.Halpern, p. 150 Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. For their part, the Austro-Hungarians adopted a similar strategy, as they too were unwilling to risk the heavy units of their fleet.Halpern, pp. 141‚Äì142 She was the flagship for the Northern Adriatic Naval Forces after Italy entered the war. The Northern Adriatic Naval Forces also included the two old Ammiraglio di Saint Bon-class battleships, two cruisers, and several smaller craft. The ships were tasked with defending Venice from Austro-Hungarian attacks; this service lasted until 15 November 1917. Since neither the Italians or Austro-Hungarians were willing to risk the main units of their fleets, Sardegna had an uneventful career during the war.Sondhaus, p. 274 The ship was thereafter transferred to Brindisi for use as a harbor defense ship. The reason for her withdrawal was the major Italian defeat at the Battle of Caporetto; the German and Austro-Hungarian advance threatened to continue to Venice.Sondhaus, pp. 312‚Äì313 Here, all of her secondary and light guns were removed, leaving her with only her main battery guns. She was equipped with a small battery of anti-aircraft guns, consisting of four /40 guns and two machine guns. On 10 June 1918, Sardegna was moved to Taranto, where she continued serving as a guard ship. She took part in Allied operations in Constantinople after the end of the war, from 7 November 1919 to 5 April 1922.Gardiner & Gray, p. 256 The ship did not remain in service long after returning to Italy. She was stricken on 4 January 1923 and subsequently broken up for scrap. FootnotesReferences  * Brassey, Thomas A., ed. (1908). The Naval Annual (Portsmouth: J.

After briefly attending Brooklyn College, Suall joined the Merchant Marines in 1945, for three years. While a Merchant Marine, he visited Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe living in squalor in Shanghai. This experience left an indelible impression on him. After his stint in the Merchant Marines, Suall studied at Ruskin College, Oxford on a Fulbright scholarship. He graduated with a BA in political science in 1950. Suall joined the Young Peoples Socialist League as a teenager.The Jewish Daily Forward. New York: August 21, 1998. Vol. CII, Iss. 31,198; p. 6 When he returned to the U.S. after studying in England, he briefly worked as head of public relations for the Jewish Labor Committee, education director for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and national secretary for the Socialist Party‚ÄìSocial Democratic Federation. In the latter capacity, he was instrumental in convincing Norman Thomas and others to allow individual members of the Independent Socialist League, sometimes known as Shatchmanites, to join with the party. During that period, Suall was ejected from the Soviet consulate in New York when he and William Lusk tried to present a protest to Arkady Sobolev, the USSR's representative to the United Nation's. They were protesting the execution of Imre Nagy, Nicolas Gimes and other Hungarians. In 1957, Suall replaced Herman Singer as Executive Secretary of the Socialist Party of America. He would remain in that role until 1968. The Arab‚ÄìIsraeli 1967 Six-Day war had a profound effect on him. He visited Israel shortly thereafter and returned to the U.S. \\"a changed man\\" according to ADL head Abraham Foxman. His attitude towards socialism apparently changed, and he \\"began to realize that his efforts on behalf of democracy and human dignity were part of a larger Jewish struggle\\". He became fact-finding director of the ADL that year and his work \\"reinforced his growing awareness of the intimate linkages between extremism, totalitarianism, and anti-Semitism\\". Meanwhile, Suall was still active in the factional struggles within the Socialist party. He became aligned with a Shactmanite faction against the \\"new politics\\" wing led by Michael Harrington and others. At the Socialist Party's final convention in December 1972, he and James Glazer presented a majority report urging that the group's name be changed to Social Democrats, USA (SDUSA). This action was approved by a 73‚Äì34 vote. Afterwards, Harrington resigned his SDUSA membership and founded the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee. Suall remained as head of the Anti-Defamation Leagues fact-finding department until 1997, when his fight with emphysema forced him to retire. His work with the ADL was not without controversy. He was sued by the Lyndon LaRouche lead US Labor Party. Judge Michael Dontzin granted ADL summary judgement and dismissed the lawsuit in April, 1979 and upheld ADL‚Äôs right to label the group ‚Äúanti- Semitic.‚Äù He was also criticized for expanding the focus of his activities to Black nationalist, Arab and leftist groups as well as far-right organizations.

It was from the Woodford Corps, Essex, that he entered the International Training College in 1937 and was commissioned the next year as Assistant Cadet Sergeant-Major, followed by British Territory corps appointments. Within a few months of his marriage to Captain Kathleen Ward in 1940, they set sail for Muckden in Manchukuo but, because of political unrest, found themselves transferred to the Boys' home in Singapore in 1941. Early in 1942, invading forces reached Malaysia. With other officers of the command, Captain Cottrill was interned in the prisoner of war camp on Changi, Singapore, and Mrs Cottrill, with their small son, was evacuated to Australia. For the next three and a half years, they were to have no contact with each other. They came to regard even the experiences of these difficult years as a high privilege. Following Captain Cottrill's release in September 1945, he returned to Malaysia with Mrs Cottrill to probation and prison work, the command of the Singapore Central Corps and Manager of the Boys' Home.

He is portrayed by Luke Pasqualino. In the third series, he is involved in a love triangle with Effy Stonem and his best friend James Cook. This causes a conflict between him and Cook, as well as their other best friend JJ. In the fourth series he continues his relationship with Effy and attempts to help her through her depression. Characterisation Freddie is best described as a laidback and sensible character who enjoys skateboarding and smoking cannabis. His best friends are Cook and JJ; they call themselves \\"The Three Musketeers\\" because of their close friendship. Freddie cares deeply for both his friends, most of the time helping JJ through his social problems because of his Asperger syndrome and attempts to control Cook's wild, if often uncontrollable behaviour with varying degrees of success. Despite his friendly nature, his home life is particularly difficult as he doesn't get along well with his father and sister. He dislikes how his sister, Karen McClair uses her mother's death as leverage to win sympathy and popularity in a talent competition. His relationship with his father is also poor, as he believes Karen gets preferential treatment over him. By the fourth series, Freddie significantly matures and he becomes closer with his family as well as Karen, having resolved their differences, although it is revealed in his central episode that his mother took her own life, making him paranoid that Effy will do the same. Freddie is portrayed as a sensitive character that falls in love with Effy Stonem. In series three his friendship with Cook deteriorates. Cook's wild image has become unbearable and exacerbates Freddie's concern for him as well as Cook eventually sleeping with Effy and boasting about it to Freddie. However Effy chooses Freddie in the series finale and Freddie is willing to reconcile with Cook, showing his capacity for forgiveness. Starting from the second episode in series 4, Freddie is in a relationship with Effy, which becomes troubled when the latter develops psychotic depression. In the penultimate episode of the series, Freddie is murdered by Effy's psychiatrist Dr. Foster, and the last episode's main plot sees the gang investigate Freddie's disappearance. His death was foreshadowed multiple times in series 3, such as when he asked Cook \\"Do you want to die?\\" in the latter's central episode when criticising his reckless behaviour, and during his own central episode when Naomi tells the story of Hamlet while looking at him, finishing with \\"somebody has to kill him\\". Character history=Series 3 In ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äù, Freddie starts his first day at college and is smitten by Effy and consequently competes for her attention against his best friends Cook and JJ. Effy proposes whoever breaks the college rules first gets to have sex with her, which Cook completes. In ‚ÄúCook‚Äù, Freddie gets a call from Karen interrupting Cook's birthday outing only to discover she wants drugs. Freddie discovers she's at an engagement party and the gang go there only for Cook to cause trouble. Freddie admits he cannot take care of him anymore although Cook reconciles with him at the episode's end. In ‚ÄúFreddie‚Äù, he watches Karen reach the final of a talent show but is disgusted at how she uses their mother's death to further her progress in a singing competition, and is implicitly uncomfortable with the sexual presentation of his sister, which is only aggravated by Cook's comments. At home Effy arrives and talks to Freddie in his shed whilst smoking weed. However Cook and JJ arrive only for Cook to demand Effy leave after she turns down his offer of sex. Later Freddie returns her bracelet and hints at a relationship but she rebuffs him, stating that she would ‚Äúbreak his heart‚Äù. As Karen begins to further her progress in the singing competition, Freddie gets increasingly annoyed with how things are turning out - from his father converting his shed into a dance studio for Karen to forcing Freddie into supporting his sister during a televised interview, which he ruins. To calm himself down, Freddie opts to meet up with Cook and JJ at a pub, where JJ inadvertently reveals that Cook had sex with Karen, angering Freddie. Later in the episode, Freddie seeks out Effy at a park where they share a passionate kiss in the water. He confesses he loves her. After a confrontation with his father and Karen, and feeling that his father has a point, he eventually offers Karen his support through the competition finale. After Karen loses the competition by 15 votes, Cook, without any hesitation, admits that he got his uncle's pub to vote entirely against Karen as revenge for stealing the shed, infuriating Freddie to the point where he even attacks Cook, ending their friendship. Nonetheless, the end of the episode shows Cook around Effy's where Freddie sees them in her bedroom window. Effy appears emotionless as Freddie walks away. In ‚ÄúJJ‚Äù, JJ is motivated by Emily to confront Freddie about the ruination of their once-strong friendship with Cook. There, he discovers that Freddie has developed a relationship with Katie Fitch, Emily's twin sister, and inadvertently reveals Emily's homosexuality to her. In the ensuing meeting he has with JJ, Freddie informs him that he must choose between him or Cook, which upsets JJ. It is also revealed that Freddie has his shed back after the events of his central episode. Cook later takes some of JJ's prescription medication which compels him to tell the truth. After seeing Cook getting attacked, Freddie berates JJ for being careless, though the two eventually manage to rescue Cook. Cook groggily admits to Freddie that he loves Effy, and that Freddie discovers Effy does not love Cook back which gives him some hope. In ‚ÄúEffy‚Äù, Freddie is continuing his relationship with Katie Fitch to Effy's dismay. At a camping trip most of the gang attend, Freddie grows distant from Katie, flirting with Effy after her apparent rejection of Cook. Katie confronts Effy's behaviour but because of Effy's consumption of magic mushrooms (and subsequent bad trip), she knocks Katie out with a rock after she was pushed and pinned to the ground. Effy wanders back to the camp-site; she is too scared to tell the others of Katie and proceeds to have sex with Freddie. Katie is eventually found and taken to hospital where she reveals Effy hit and left her (although conveniently left out the reasons why she did so). Nonetheless this disgusts Freddie and a disgraced Effy leaves Bristol with Cook. In ‚ÄúKatie and Emily‚Äù, Freddie and JJ run into the Fitch twins at a clothes shop. Freddie talks to Katie and apologises for his behaviour at the camp-site, Katie forces Freddie to take her to the prom and volunteers Emily to go with JJ. Freddie jokes that JJ would love to go with Emily after the two had sex. This causes problems for the Fitches and Emily's relationship with Naomi. In the series finale, Freddie gets a call from Effy, who states her concern for Cook and how his father manipulates him. She tells Freddie where they are, who takes JJ with him and travels there. The town host an annual race which the boys enter, stating the winner takes Effy. JJ surprisingly wins the race using his intelligence and uses the occasion to take charge and demand Effy picks one of them. Whilst she does not say anything, her gaze lingers at Freddie which angers Cook, who leaves. Cook gets in an argument with his dad, who threatens to burn Cook's face off. Freddie arrives to knock Cook Senior out, helping his friend. The four travel back to Bristol, where the problem seemingly remains unsolved despite Freddie temporarily patching up his differences with Cook. Series 4 In ‚ÄúThomas‚Äù, the suicide of Sophia plunges the gang into mistrust. However Freddie is not affected by this, he is dwelling on Effy's refusal to come back to college, and has been out of contact with her for some time. In ‚ÄúEmily‚Äù, Effy returns to college and speaks to Freddie. They discuss where Effy had been before she leaves, stating she missed Freddie the most. Freddie is doubtful when he sees her hugging Cook. When Emily questions Freddie whether he can trust her, he fails to answer. Later at a house party, Freddie and Effy kiss making a watchful Cook lash out at a fellow party-goer out of rage and jealousy. They promptly leave. In ‚ÄúCook‚Äù it is revealed that Cook's mother, Ruth, had given Freddie a blowjob at Cook's 15th birthday party. Freddie reveals this when he goes to see Cook having been concerned about his recent behaviour, and feeling sorrow for Cook being expelled from college. After Cook is arrested, Effy visits him in prison and informs him that she loves Freddie. On the date of his hearing, Freddie, Effy and JJ visit him and await the trial conclusion only to discover Cook is being held in custody. In ‚ÄúFreddie‚Äù, Effy and Freddie live a hedonistic lifestyle away from their family. Freddie's education and interaction with his other friends suffer as a result. He is persuaded to see a school counselor, which proves ineffective. However, Freddie notices Effy's psychotic tendencies and after a talk with his grandfather Norman, Freddie is motivated to look after her and not make the mistakes his father did with Freddie's deceased mother. A trip outside with Effy starts well but eventually Effy is scared and loses Freddie in a street parade. Surprisingly it is Katie, part of the parade, who notices Effy and despite their past, she helps Effy find Freddie. They take Effy to Norman's but after being left alone, Effy attempts suicide by slitting her wrists, only for Freddie to find her and take her to hospital. There, he meets Anthea (Morwenna Banks), Effy's mother, and tells her Effy needs her mother, not him. Cook, now escaped from custody, convinces Freddie not to give up on Effy. In ‚ÄúEffy‚Äù, Effy returns home from hospital with a new schedule and a new reserved personality. She visits Freddie and they talk about her psychiatrist Dr. Foster (Hugo Speer) who has removed Effy's bad memories and forbids Effy from seeing Freddie as part of the treatment. Freddie is understandably upset Effy had bad memories of him. Later the gang announce their A-Level results. Freddie attains 2 Cs and an A, grades that are slightly better than Katie's and Emily's. Effy declares the results are unimportant to her and leaves. When Freddie next sees her and they argue, Effy's personality changes as Dr. Foster's psychological work makes her forget everyone she has loved. However, after she talks with Cook (who saves her life in the process) she realises who she is and goes to Freddie and tells him to tell Dr. Foster to leave her alone. Freddie orders Dr. Foster to leave Effy and subsequently stays with Effy for the night and she tells him ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù several times and he cries and says ‚ÄúI love you too so so much and I will see you in the morning‚Äù. This is the last time she sees Freddie. Freddie receives a phone call from Dr. Foster and as a result he goes to confront the doctor personally. Freddie does not tell anyone about his decision. When he reaches Dr. Foster's house, he demands that Foster leaves Effy alone. The doctor admits to him that getting too personal with Effy was a mistake. However, when Freddie attempts to leave he finds the door is locked. Dr. Foster approaches him and informs Freddie that Effy means much more to him, and says that \\"she really loves [him]\\" and \\"that's why [he] can't let [him] go\\". Dr. Foster then proceeds to brutally murder Freddie with a baseball bat. In the series finale, Cook discovers Freddie's concern about Dr. Foster and follows the doctor back to his house. Cook breaks into John Foster's basement where he finds Freddie's blood stained clothes and shoes. Cook then seemingly hears Freddie's ghostly voice warning him to leave before Foster comes, this spooks Cook and he turns on a light just before Foster arrives with his baseball bat. John hits him in the stomach almost knocking him to the ground with his bat and verbally taunts him. Cook gets up laughing and admits he is a \\"waste of space\\" and a criminal, but then he tells John that he knows he killed Freddie. He then gets angry and holds his fist up ready to beat him and screams out \\"I'm Cook!\\" and launches himself at John as the season ends. As it is later revealed in Series 7, Cook killed Foster avenging Freddie‚Äôs death.

Between 30 July and 16 August Black Joke participated in the unsuccessful expedition to Walcheren and the adjacent Scheldt islands. On 22 April 1810 she recaptured Francis. Another account has the recapture taking place on 18 April. Francis had been sailing from Fayal to Liverpool when she was captured. She arrived at Scilly on 26 May.Lloyd's List, no.4484, - accessed 10 November 2013. Salvage money for Francis was due for payment on 20 October 1810. On 1 June the French captured Black Joke in the Channel.Hepper (1994), p.132.Gossett (1986), p.52. Black Joke had been carrying dispatches from Constantinople and Malta, and possibly overland dispatches from India, at the time of her capture. Lloyd's List described her as carrying only four guns, and reported that two French privateers had captured her and taken her into Algiers.Lloyd's List, 14 August 1810 - accessed 10 November 2013. She may have been the same vessel as the Hired armed cutter Black Joke. In his narrative of his voyages in the Mediterranean between 1810 and 1814, Charles Robert Cockerell reports traveling with Lieutenant Cannadey in April 1810 to Constantinople and the retaking of Francis en route.Cockerell (1903), p.2. He further reports that Black Joke was an old vessel, having been at the Battle of Camperdown, which is consistent with one of the first mentions of the cutter Black Joke. Cockerell has her being captured off Algiers by two French privateers, one of 10 and one of 8 guns.Cockerell (1903), p.13. Lord Byron describes Black Joke as having 6 guns and a crew of 27 men. He further writes that Captain Sir Robert Barrie of Pomone reported that two privateers had captured Black Joke off Sardinia, but not until after she had lost seven men of her crew killed resisting them and Cannadey had succeeded in throwing his dispatches overboard.Cochran p.63 In 1811, Cannadey is listed as the captain of the lugger , in the Downs.

Tournefort suggested that the term Flores papilionacei originated with Valerius Cordus, who applied it to the flowers of the bean. Structure=Corolla The flowers have a bilateral symmetry with the corolla consisting of five petals. A single, large, upper petal is known as the banner (also vexillum or standard petal). The semi-cylindrical base of the banner embraces and compresses two equal and smaller lateral wings (or alae). The wings in turn enclose a pair of small keel petals, that are situated somewhat lower than the wings, but are interior to them. They have concave sides and correspond with the shape of the wings. The two keel petals are fused at their bases or stuck together to form a boat-shaped structure that encloses the essential flower organs, namely the androecium and gynoecium. Typically these flowers have a vexillary (i.e. descendingly imbricate or overlapping) aestivation. Stamens The stamens often have a diadelphous morphology, meaning that they are united in two sets with a distinct filament shape in each set. The inferior set forms a membranous sheath at its base, that envelops the single, superior pistil in a tube. The tube divides into nine filaments, which trace the base of the keel petals that enclose them. The single free filament lies above them. In Smithia the two sets are equal, with 5 stamens in each. Many papilionaceous flowers however have ten distinct stamens. Genera that conform to the latter morphology include Sophora, Anagyris, Cercis, Daviesia, Dillwynia, Gompholobium, Mirbelia and Pultenaea. Biology Charles Darwin observed that the fertility of plants with papilionaceous flowers depend to an important extent on visits by bees, and it is accepted that this corolla structure evolved under selective pressure of bee pollinators. Linnaeus remarked that they produce hardly any scent, but the flowers of Spanish broom, sweet pea, scorpion vetch, European yellow lupine, fava bean and various species of clover are notable exceptions. Four different mechanisms of pollen release are known in papilionaceous flowers, which are respectively known as the explosive, valvular, piston and brush mechanisms. In the explosive or tripping mechanism (cf. alfalfa, common broom, ox-eye bean) all pollen is instantly released when pressure on the staminal column is permanently released (usually by an insect) causing it to snap against the standard petal. In the valvular mechanism pollen is released repeatedly when pollinators unseal the upper rim of the keel petals, and force them downwards. In the piston mechanism (cf. scorpion senna) pollen is released repeatedly when the keel tip is moved by an insect so as to release pollen through a hole in the tip. The brush mechanism employs a pistil which is longer than the stamens, so as to avoid self-pollination. When a pollinator presses against the standard and wing petals, a brush on the temporarily lifted pistil brushes pollen onto the pollinator, while the stigma receives external pollen. Examples and exceptions Well-known plant genera in the Faboideae which exhibit this corolla morphology include beans, peas, sweet peas, alfalfa (lucerne), clovers, lupines, smoke trees, black locusts, locoweeds and coral trees. The flowers of coral trees are diadelphous and are considered papilionaceous, but the wings are much reduced, suggesting a flower with three petals. Their keel petals are elongate, fused together and sometimes tubular to facilitate pollination by certain bird groups, while secondary compounds in their nectar seem to repel bees. The false indigo genus, though belonging to the Faboideae, does not exhibit a papilionaceous corolla morphology, as it has only one petal per flower, namely the banner. The corolla of clovers tends to be monopetalous, as all five petals are often fused below to form a tube. 2011-07-25 21-30-17-flower.jpgCommon bean flower Vicia faba.jpgFava bean flowers with purple banners and pied wings Starr 081009-0043 Pisum sativum var. macrocarpum.jpgPea flower with pink banner and maroon wings Medicago sativa (5183007138).jpgAlfalfa flowers with staminal column of central flower tripped Other legume subfamilies To the contrary, plants in the Mimosoideae subfamily of legumes have the petals reduced, and have numerous stamens arranged in showy spikes.

The original community event was created by the staff of the City Parks and Recreation Department who included, D. Martin Piepenbrok (event founder), Debra Bozich, Susan Kebbe, Michael Kostrzeba, Terry Carlson, Gordon Lonie, Helen Cerny, Cheryl Cameron, Cindy Guzi and others, under the leadership of Thomas L. Chappelle, Director of Parks and Recreation. The festival continued to grow over the years to become one of the most highly anticipated summer festivals in southeast Michigan. From the humble beginnings of evening concerts and dance parties, to kids relay events, to buskers, to classic car shows, to hot- air balloon liftoffs, and day-long Saturday mini-stage shows, the festival became larger and drew greater attendance. An Arts and Crafts Fair was added to Summerfest that was coordinated in collaboration with the City's Community Relations Department. The festival was renamed the Sterlingfest Art and Music Fair and today it offers a wide variety of outstanding activities n a street fair-like setting with multiple performance stages, a Kidzfest activities and entertainment venue, headliner main stage concerts, carnival rides, the juried art show, restaurant row, 5K Run, and much, much more.

He also attained the rank of major general as Adjutant General of the Vermont National Guard. Early life Peck was born in Burlington, Vermont. He attended local schools and was prepared to attend the University of Vermont when he opted instead to enlist for the Civil War.Carleton, 1903, pp. 490‚Äì195Vermont Historical Society, 1921, pp. 280‚Äì281 He tried to enlist into the military on four previous occasions, but in every case he was turned down because he was too young.Dodge, 1913, p. 285 Military career In 1861 he applied for military service a fifth time and was appointed a private in Company F, 1st Vermont Volunteer Cavalry.Ward, 1886, p. 306 He took part in engagements at Middletown and Winchester, Virginia, in May, 1862.Ullery, 1894, pp. 304‚Äì305 In June, 1862 he was appointed regimental quartermaster sergeant of the 9th Vermont Volunteer Infantry. He was with the regiment when it was captured at Harper's Ferry in September, 1862. The 9th Vermont was paroled and sent to Camp Douglas (Chicago) in January, 1863, after which it guarded Confederate prisoners. Peck accepted a commission as a second lieutenant in January, 1863. In March, 1863 the regiment returned to the Army of the Potomac and joined the siege of Suffolk, Virginia. In July and August, 1863 Peck saw action at Yorktown and Gloucester Court House, and he was involved in combat at Young's Crossroads, North Carolina in December, 1863. On February 2, 1864 he took part in an engagement at Newport Barracks, North Carolina, for which he received Medal of Honor. He participated in several other battles throughout 1864 and was promoted to captain. He was wounded at Fort Harrison, Virginia in September, 1864, but remained with his unit. In late 1864 and early 1865 Peck assumed temporary command of a battalion in the 9th Vermont, and was then appointed acting regimental quartermaster and adjutant. In late 1864 he also served in New York City as part of a force sent to prevent civil unrest during that year's presidential election. He then moved to 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, XVIII Army Corps, serving as assistant adjutant general, aide-de-camp and brigade quartermaster. In March, 1865 he was appointed assistant quartermaster of 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, XXIV Army Corps. He was present at the capture of Richmond, and was among first to enter city after it fell. Peck was mustered out in May 1865, having twice declined commissions in the regular Army. Medal of Honor action He (Peck) received a medal of honor from Congress for gallantry in action at Newport Barracks, N. C., February 2, 1864. On that day the Union troops, comprising some seven hundred and fifty men, with one piece of artillery, were attacked by the Confederate General Martin with about five thousand infantry, accompanied by fourteen pieces of artillery and four hundred cavalry, which had outflanked our small force from the commencement of the engagement. The left of the Union line lay near the river, while the right was in the woods and was commanded by 1st Lieutenant T. S. Peck, Company H, 9th Vermont Volunteers. The line was continually pressed back by the enemy, and made eleven different stands before reaching the Newport River, over which there were two bridges, one a railroad bridge, and the other called the \\"county bridge,\\" located about a quarter mile above the former. The Confederates pressed so closely that there was barely time to fire the railroad bridge with turpentine and tar. Lieutenant Peck, with his men, was ordered to fire the county bridge, and was told that he would find on the opposite side the bridge-head two companies cavalry with plenty of turpentine and tar for his use as soon as had crossed but the bridge must be burned at all hazards and the enemy prevented from crossing, for it was well known throughout the entire command that their salvation depended upon the burning of both these bridges; if either was left undestroyed and the enemy permitted to cross, the chances were that what was left of the Union forces would be captured. Lieutenant Peck had made a desperate fight all the afternoon, and had been the farthest out toward the enemy the entire time, holding them in check until they had broken through the line on his left. At this time the Union troops had mostly crossed the railroad and county bridges, and were rapidly falling back down the county road toward Beaufort, while Lieutenant Peck's rear guard was hotly engaged with the Confederates who were close at his heels. He had sent a noncommissioned officer to the bridge to see if everything was in readiness to fire the same after he had crossed it. The sergeant had just reported that there was no tar, no turpentine, and no cavalry; in fact, there was nothing‚Äîall had fled. Lieutenant Peck, leaving one half of his men with their officers fighting the enemy, with the other half ran down the hill to the bridge, determined to destroy the same if possible. Finding that some of the planks were not spiked down, he had these torn up, and, being fortunate in finding plenty of dry grass in the vicinity, which his men pulled from the ground, he had the same placed in readiness for burning the bridge, then ordered his men who were fighting to stop firing and rush across. This order was instantly obeyed, although some were killed and wounded in leaving the enemy, who came forward on the run, increasing their musketry fire. As soon as our men from the hill had crossed the bridge, they commenced firing upon the enemy, while the others of the party ignited the dead grass. The Confederates brought up a battery and poured in grape and canister, but the rear guard of the 9th stood to the bridge until it was destroyed and the enemy prevented from crossing. The river at this point, although narrow, was very deep, and the enemy was obliged to construct a bridge before crossing the stream, which gave the Union men an advantage of about three hours, and saved the command.

The story tells of a young nurse and her marriage to a farmer fifteen years her senior. Typical of romance comics of the era, the tale expresses male viewpoints on female behavior, domesticity, love, sex, and marriage, and advocates female self-sacrifice for the sake of a lasting marriage.  Background  Following World War II, adult readership of comic books increased but caped crime fighters and superheroes were dismissed as pass√©. Joe Simon and Jack Kirby attempted to fill the void in adult comics material by launching the romance comic book, Young Romance, in 1947. The venture was a great success and the two creators followed the title in 1949 with Young Love. Romance comic books became a cultural sensation with dozens of titles hitting newsstands and drug store racks in the early 1950s.  Plot  Nurse Nancy, a city dweller, and Bill Toomey, a war-wounded veteran and farmer fifteen years her senior marry. When Bill takes a job with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the two journey to Washington, DC but Bill is unhappy in the city. He returns from work every night tired while Nancy wants to attend parties and shows. One night, she vents her frustrations and goes out alone. When she returns home, she finds a note from Bill telling her he has left for his farm and is willing to grant her a divorce because she is obviously unhappy with him. Nancy breaks into tears and bewails her selfishness. She leaves her job in the city and goes to Bill's farm to renew her marriage on Bill's terms.  Analysis  Typical of the other stories in the first issue of Young Romance, and typical of the many romance comic book stories to follow in the years to come, \\"The Farmer's Wife\\" is told by the female protagonist but is written by males and expresses male perspectives on female behavior, gender roles, love, sex, and marriage. The story is a cautionary morality tale that investigates the perils of female independence, celebrates domesticity, and advocates female self-sacrifice for the sake of a lasting marriage.

They are commonly found on black-and-white recordings of television programs originally made in color. Chroma dots were once regarded as undesirable picture noise, but recent advances in computer technology have allowed them to be used to reconstruct the original color signal from black-and-white recordings, providing a means to re-color material where the original color copy is lost. Background Analogue color video signals comprise two components: chrominance and luminance. The luminance component describes the brightness of each part of the picture, while the chrominance component describes the color tone. When displayed on a black-and-white monitor, the luminance signal produces a normal black-and-white image, while the chrominance signal manifests as a fine pattern of dots of varying size and intensity overlaid over the black-and-white picture. A related phenomenon is dot crawl, which can produce visual artifacts in color pictures. History In the early days of color television, it was common practice for broadcasters to produce black- and-white film copies of color programs for sale and transmission in territories lacking color broadcast facilities or employing different color television systems. During the telerecording process, it was normal practice to insert a filter circuit between the color video output and the black-and- white monitor input in order to remove the color signal and prevent the formation of chroma dots. In many cases, however, the filter was not used and the chroma dot patterning is permanently burned into the resulting film recording. Use in restoration In 1994, James Insell, a BBC engineer, noticed that when playing back a copy of a black-and-white telerecording through color video equipment, spurious color was generated by the presence of chroma dots in the picture. He theorised that it might be possible to use the chroma dots to reconstruct the original color signal, and in 2007 set up a working group to carry out further research. In 2008, it was announced that members of the working group had successfully managed to restore the Dad's Army episode \\"Room at the Bottom\\" using information from the chroma dot patterning. The process has since been used to restore other programs including the pilot episode of Are You Being Served? and various episodes of Doctor Who. (Planet of the Daleks, episode 3; Invasion of the Dinosaurs, episode 1; and episodes 2-6 of The Mind of Evil) The working group hope that the technique may enable the restoration of many other programs for which no color copy is known to exist.

It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function. The idea of gradient boosting originated in the observation by Leo Breiman that boosting can be interpreted as an optimization algorithm on a suitable cost function. Explicit regression gradient boosting algorithms were subsequently developed by Jerome H. Friedman, simultaneously with the more general functional gradient boosting perspective of Llew Mason, Jonathan Baxter, Peter Bartlett and Marcus Frean. The latter two papers introduced the view of boosting algorithms as iterative functional gradient descent algorithms. That is, algorithms that optimize a cost function over function space by iteratively choosing a function (weak hypothesis) that points in the negative gradient direction. This functional gradient view of boosting has led to the development of boosting algorithms in many areas of machine learning and statistics beyond regression and classification.  Informal introduction  (This section follows the exposition of gradient boosting by Li.) Like other boosting methods, gradient boosting combines weak \\"learners\\" into a single strong learner in an iterative fashion. It is easiest to explain in the least-squares regression setting, where the goal is to \\"teach\\" a model F to predict values of the form \\\\hat{y} = F(x) by minimizing the mean squared error \\\\tfrac{1}{n}\\\\sum_i(\\\\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2, where i indexes over some training set of size n of actual values of the output variable y: * \\\\hat y_i = the predicted value F(x) * y_i = the observed value * n the number of samples in y Now, let us consider a gradient boosting algorithm with M stages. At each stage m (1 \\\\le m \\\\le M) of gradient boosting, suppose some imperfect model F_m (for low m, this model may simply return \\\\hat y_i = \\\\bar y, where the RHS is the mean of y). In order to improve F_m, our algorithm should add some new estimator, h_m(x). Thus, : F_{m+1}(x) = F_m(x) + h_m(x) = y or, equivalently, : h_m(x) = y - F_m(x) . Therefore, gradient boosting will fit to the residual y - F_m(x). As in other boosting variants, each F_{m+1} attempts to correct the errors of its predecessor F_m. A generalization of this idea to loss functions other than squared error, and to classification and ranking problems, follows from the observation that residuals h_m(x) for a given model are the negative gradients of the mean squared error (MSE) loss function (with respect to F(x)): : L_{\\\\rm MSE} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(y - F(x)\\\\right)^2 : h_m(x) = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L_{\\\\rm MSE}}{\\\\partial F} = y - F(x) . So, gradient boosting could be specialized to a gradient descent algorithm, and generalizing it entails \\"plugging in\\" a different loss and its gradient.  Algorithm  In many supervised learning problems one has an output variable and a vector of input variables described via a joint probability distribution P(x,y). Using a training set { (x_1,y_1), \\\\dots , (x_n,y_n) } of known values of and corresponding values of , the goal is to find an approximation \\\\hat{F}(x) to a function F(x) that minimizes the expected value of some specified loss function L(y, F(x)): : \\\\hat{F} = \\\\underset{F}{\\\\arg\\\\min} \\\\, \\\\mathbb{E}_{x,y}[L(y, F(x))]. The gradient boosting method assumes a real- valued and seeks an approximation \\\\hat{F}(x) in the form of a weighted sum of functions h_i (x) from some class \\\\mathcal{H}, called base (or weak) learners: : \\\\hat{F}(x) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^M \\\\gamma_i h_i(x) + \\\\mbox{const}. In accordance with the empirical risk minimization principle, the method tries to find an approximation \\\\hat{F}(x) that minimizes the average value of the loss function on the training set, i.e., minimizes the empirical risk. It does so by starting with a model, consisting of a constant function F_0(x), and incrementally expands it in a greedy fashion: :F_0(x) = \\\\underset{\\\\gamma}{\\\\arg\\\\min} {\\\\sum_{i=1}^n {L(y_i, \\\\gamma)}}, :F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \\\\underset{h_m \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,min}} \\\\left[{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n {L(y_i, F_{m-1}(x_i) + h_m(x_i))}}\\\\right], where h_m \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H} is a base learner function. Unfortunately, choosing the best function at each step for an arbitrary loss function is a computationally infeasible optimization problem in general. Therefore, we restrict our approach to a simplified version of the problem. The idea is to apply a steepest descent step to this minimization problem (functional gradient descent). If we considered the continuous case, i.e. where \\\\mathcal{H} is the set of arbitrary differentiable functions on \\\\R, we would update the model in accordance with the following equations :F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) - \\\\gamma_m \\\\sum_{i=1}^n { abla_{F_{m-1}} L(y_i, F_{m-1}(x_i))},\\\\gamma_m = \\\\underset{\\\\gamma}{\\\\arg\\\\min} {\\\\sum_{i=1}^n {L\\\\left(y_i, F_{m-1}(x_i) - \\\\gamma abla_{F_{m-1}} L(y_i, F_{m-1}(x_i)) \\\\right)}}, where the derivatives are taken with respect to the functions F_i for i \\\\in { 1,..,m }, and \\\\gamma_m is the step length. In the discrete case however, i.e. when the set \\\\mathcal{H} is finite, we choose the candidate function closest to the gradient of for which the coefficient may then be calculated with the aid of line search on the above equations. Note that this approach is a heuristic and therefore doesn't yield an exact solution to the given problem, but rather an approximation. In pseudocode, the generic gradient boosting method is: Input: training set {(x_i, y_i)}_{i=1}^n, a differentiable loss function L(y, F(x)), number of iterations . Algorithm: # Initialize model with a constant value: #: F_0(x) = \\\\underset{\\\\gamma}{\\\\arg\\\\min} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n L(y_i, \\\\gamma). # For = 1 to : ## Compute so-called pseudo-residuals: ##: r_{im} = -\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\partial L(y_i, F(x_i))}{\\\\partial F(x_i)}\\\\right]_{F(x)=F_{m-1}(x)} \\\\quad \\\\mbox{for } i=1,\\\\ldots,n. ## Fit a base learner (or weak learner, e.g. tree) h_m(x) to pseudo-residuals, i.e. train it using the training set {(x_i, r_{im})}_{i=1}^n. ## Compute multiplier \\\\gamma_m by solving the following one-dimensional optimization problem: ##: \\\\gamma_m = \\\\underset{\\\\gamma}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,min}} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n L\\\\left(y_i, F_{m-1}(x_i) + \\\\gamma h_m(x_i)\\\\right). ## Update the model: ##: F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \\\\gamma_m h_m(x). # Output F_M(x).  Gradient tree boosting  Gradient boosting is typically used with decision trees (especially CART trees) of a fixed size as base learners. For this special case, Friedman proposes a modification to gradient boosting method which improves the quality of fit of each base learner. Generic gradient boosting at the m-th step would fit a decision tree h_m(x) to pseudo-residuals. Let J_{m} be the number of its leaves. The tree partitions the input space into J_{m} disjoint regions R_{1m}, \\\\ldots, R_{J_{m}m} and predicts a constant value in each region. Using the indicator notation, the output of h_m(x) for input x can be written as the sum: : h_m(x) = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{J_{m}} b_{jm} \\\\mathbf {1}_{R_{jm}}(x), where b_{jm} is the value predicted in the region R_{jm}.Note: in case of usual CART trees, the trees are fitted using least-squares loss, and so the coefficient b_{jm} for the region R_{jm} is equal to just the value of output variable, averaged over all training instances in R_{jm}. Then the coefficients b_{jm} are multiplied by some value \\\\gamma_m, chosen using line search so as to minimize the loss function, and the model is updated as follows: : F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \\\\gamma_m h_m(x), \\\\quad \\\\gamma_m = \\\\underset{\\\\gamma}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,min}} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n L(y_i, F_{m-1}(x_i) + \\\\gamma h_m(x_i)). Friedman proposes to modify this algorithm so that it chooses a separate optimal value \\\\gamma_{jm} for each of the tree's regions, instead of a single \\\\gamma_m for the whole tree. He calls the modified algorithm \\"TreeBoost\\". The coefficients b_{jm} from the tree-fitting procedure can be then simply discarded and the model update rule becomes: : F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \\\\sum_{j=1}^{J_{m}} \\\\gamma_{jm} \\\\mathbf {1}_{R_{jm}}(x), \\\\quad \\\\gamma_{jm} = \\\\underset{\\\\gamma}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,min}} \\\\sum_{x_i \\\\in R_{jm}} L(y_i, F_{m-1}(x_i) + \\\\gamma).  Size of trees  J, the number of terminal nodes in trees, is the method's parameter which can be adjusted for a data set at hand. It controls the maximum allowed level of interaction between variables in the model. With J = 2 (decision stumps), no interaction between variables is allowed. With J = 3 the model may include effects of the interaction between up to two variables, and so on. Hastie et al. comment that typically 4 \\\\leq J \\\\leq 8 work well for boosting and results are fairly insensitive to the choice of J in this range, J = 2 is insufficient for many applications, and J > 10 is unlikely to be required.  Regularization  Fitting the training set too closely can lead to degradation of the model's generalization ability. Several so-called regularization techniques reduce this overfitting effect by constraining the fitting procedure. One natural regularization parameter is the number of gradient boosting iterations M (i.e. the number of trees in the model when the base learner is a decision tree). Increasing M reduces the error on training set, but setting it too high may lead to overfitting. An optimal value of M is often selected by monitoring prediction error on a separate validation data set. Besides controlling M, several other regularization techniques are used. Another regularization parameter is the depth of the trees. The higher this value the more likely the model will overfit the training data.  Shrinkage  An important part of gradient boosting method is regularization by shrinkage which consists in modifying the update rule as follows: : F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + u \\\\cdot \\\\gamma_m h_m(x), \\\\quad 0 < u \\\\leq 1, where parameter u is called the \\"learning rate\\". Empirically it has been found that using small learning rates (such as u < 0.1) yields dramatic improvements in models' generalization ability over gradient boosting without shrinking ( u = 1). However, it comes at the price of increasing computational time both during training and querying: lower learning rate requires more iterations.  Stochastic gradient boosting  Soon after the introduction of gradient boosting, Friedman proposed a minor modification to the algorithm, motivated by Breiman's bootstrap aggregation (\\"bagging\\") method. Specifically, he proposed that at each iteration of the algorithm, a base learner should be fit on a subsample of the training set drawn at random without replacement.Note that this is different from bagging, which samples with replacement because it uses samples of the same size as the training set. Friedman observed a substantial improvement in gradient boosting's accuracy with this modification. Subsample size is some constant fraction f of the size of the training set. When f = 1, the algorithm is deterministic and identical to the one described above. Smaller values of f introduce randomness into the algorithm and help prevent overfitting, acting as a kind of regularization. The algorithm also becomes faster, because regression trees have to be fit to smaller datasets at each iteration. Friedman obtained that 0.5 \\\\leq f \\\\leq 0.8 leads to good results for small and moderate sized training sets. Therefore, f is typically set to 0.5, meaning that one half of the training set is used to build each base learner. Also, like in bagging, subsampling allows one to define an out-of-bag error of the prediction performance improvement by evaluating predictions on those observations which were not used in the building of the next base learner. Out-of-bag estimates help avoid the need for an independent validation dataset, but often underestimate actual performance improvement and the optimal number of iterations.Ridgeway, Greg (2007). Generalized Boosted Models: A guide to the gbm package.Learn Gradient Boosting Algorithm for better predictions (with codes in R)  Number of observations in leaves  Gradient tree boosting implementations often also use regularization by limiting the minimum number of observations in trees' terminal nodes. It is used in the tree building process by ignoring any splits that lead to nodes containing fewer than this number of training set instances. Imposing this limit helps to reduce variance in predictions at leaves.  Penalize complexity of tree  Another useful regularization techniques for gradient boosted trees is to penalize model complexity of the learned model.Tianqi Chen. Introduction to Boosted Trees The model complexity can be defined as the proportional number of leaves in the learned trees. The joint optimization of loss and model complexity corresponds to a post-pruning algorithm to remove branches that fail to reduce the loss by a threshold. Other kinds of regularization such as an \\\\ell_2 penalty on the leaf values can also be added to avoid overfitting.  Usage  Gradient boosting can be used in the field of learning to rank. The commercial web search engines YahooCossock, David and Zhang, Tong (2008). Statistical Analysis of Bayes Optimal Subset Ranking , page 14. and YandexYandex corporate blog entry about new ranking model \\"Snezhinsk\\" (in Russian) use variants of gradient boosting in their machine- learned ranking engines.  Names  The method goes by a variety of names. Friedman introduced his regression technique as a \\"Gradient Boosting Machine\\" (GBM). Mason, Baxter et al. described the generalized abstract class of algorithms as \\"functional gradient boosting\\". Friedman et al. describe an advancement of gradient boosted models as Multiple Additive Regression Trees (MART); Elith et al. describe that approach as \\"Boosted Regression Trees\\" (BRT). A popular open-source implementation for R calls it a \\"Generalized Boosting Model\\", however packages expanding this work use BRT. Commercial implementations from Salford Systems use the names \\"Multiple Additive Regression Trees\\" (MART) and TreeNet, both trademarked.

Although Ya øqob is included in traditional lists of primates of the Church of the East, his existence has been doubted by J. M. Fiey, one of the most eminent twentieth-century scholars of the Church of the East. In Fiey's view, Ya øqob was one of several fictitious bishops of Seleucia-Ctesiphon whose lives were concocted in the sixth century to bridge the gap between the late third century bishop Papa, the first historically attested bishop of Seleucia- Ctesiphon, and the apostle Mari, the legendary founder of Christianity in Persia.Fiey, Jalons, 64‚Äì5  Sources  Brief accounts of the life of Yaqob are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (floruit 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century), Amr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth- century).

Character background Kelly is a nightclub singer/vaudevillian who had mediocre success as part of an acrobatics double act with her sister Veronica until, when she catches Veronica with her husband Charlie while on tour, she presumably kills them both (though she denies remembering it). She is sent to the Cook County Jail where she hires the best soliciting lawyer, Billy Flynn, a master of turning cases into a media circus to free his clients. The attention prompts an offer from the William Morris Agency to pay her more than fourteen times what she had made as her share of the proceeds from the double act with Veronica‚Äîonce she is acquitted. Kelly's plans are upended when Roxie Hart, a failed vaudeville aspirant accused of murdering her paramour, arrives in the jail and hires Flynn, who promptly shifts the media circus to Hart and away from Kelly. William Morris drops their offer, and Kelly remains resentful of Hart for the rest of the show, though she begrudgingly concedes that her act needs a partner and that Roxie fits the bill. Kelly is ultimately acquitted offstage; she and Roxie end up co-headlining a vaudeville tour. Historical basis Velma Kelly's character was based on a woman named Belva Gaertner. Belva was a cabaret singer who had been married and divorced twice. After those men had come and gone, she had a lover named Walter Law, who she thought was the right man for her. On March 11, 1924, Belva shot Law, who was already married with one child. Law was found in the front seat of Belva's car with a bottle of gin and a gun beside him that had discharged three cartridges. The next day, she was found at her apartment with bloody clothes on the floor. She claimed that she had been drunk and couldn't remember what had happened. She was arrested for the murder of Walter Law on March 12, 1924. During her interview with Maurine Watkins, Gaertner told Watkins that \\"gin and guns‚Äîeither one is bad enough, but together they get you in a dickens of a mess, don't they.\\" Her defense in court was that he could have committed suicide, and she was released in June 1924. She remarried her husband William Gaertner and was later convicted of drunk driving in 1926. In 1927, she attended the opening of Watkins' play Chicago in Chicago, Illinois. For the musical, Kelly's mannerisms were based upon Texas Guinan, one of the most famous vaudeville performers of the era. Notable portrayals Women who have portrayed Velma on the Broadway stage include: Chita Rivera, Caroline O'Connor, Bebe Neuwirth, Reva Rice, Pia Douwes and Ute Lemper. She was portrayed by Lisa Kelly in the Irish production. Samantha Barks starred as Velma in the 2013 Hollywood Bowl production. In 1999, Neuwirth had to go back on stage and play Velma Kelly with only two days' notice because Lemper, who was supposed to play her, was battling laryngitis and the flu for two weeks so her doctor recommended that she take some time off to rest.Van Gelder, Lawrence. \\"FOOTLIGHTS\\", The New York Times, January 14, 1999; accessed March 21, 2010. In 1997, Neuwirth won a Tony Award, a Drama Desk Award, and a Fred Astaire Award for her performance as Velma Kelly. Neuwirth came back 10 years later and played the other murderess, Roxie Hart. In 2014, she appeared in a limited engagement as Mama Morton. The 2002 film version of the musical features Catherine Zeta-Jones as Velma Kelly. She received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and a BAFTA Film Award for her role. Prior to the 1975 debut of the stage musical, Kelly appeared in the earlier incarnations of Watkins' story. In the original non-musical play that debuted on December 30, 1926, and in the silent film version released on December 27, 1927, Velma had no last name and was a smaller role, billed as a \\"stylish divorc√©e\\" among the other inmates at the jail. This version of Velma was played by Juliette Crosby in the stage playChicago (1926 play) details, ibdb.com; accessed October 3, 2015. and by Julia Faye in the silent film.Chicago (1927 film) details, imdb.com; accessed October 3, 2015. In the 1942 film Roxie Hart, she was given the last name Wall and portrayed by Helene Reynolds.Roxie Hart (1942 film) details, imdb.com; accessed October 3, 2015. Musical numbers Throughout the musical, Velma Kelly has many songs and dances that she performs, whether it be by herself or with an ensemble of people.

Sources Brief accounts of the life of Ahadabui are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (floruit 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century), Amr (fourteenth- century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century). These accounts differ slightly, and these minor differences are of significance for scholars interested in tracing the various stages in the development of the legend. Although Ahadabui is included in traditional lists of primates of the Church of the East, his existence has been doubted by J. M. Fiey, one of the most eminent twentieth- century scholars of the Church of the East. In Fiey's view, Ahadabui was one of several fictitious bishops of Seleucia-Ctesiphon whose lives were concocted in the sixth century to bridge the gap between the late third century bishop Papa, the first historically attested bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, and the apostle Mari, the legendary founder of Christianity in Persia.Fiey, Jalons, 64‚Äì5 Life The following account of the life of Ahadabui is given by Bar Hebraeus: > After Yaqob, Ahadabui. He was given this name because of his striking > similarity to his father. Shortly before he died Yaqob instructed two of his > disciples, Ahadabui and Qamisho, to go to Antioch, so that the patriarch of > Antioch could consecrate whichever of them he chose and send him back. They > did so, and when they both arrived in Antioch they were lodged in the house > of a certain believer. But they were shortly afterwards denounced to the > governor of Antioch as Persian spies, and were imprisoned in the house in > which they were staying. Ahadabui was able to flee to Jerusalem, but Qamisho > and his host were arrested and crucified as spies. When the patriarch of > Antioch heard that Ahadabui was hiding in Jerusalem, he sent letters to the > bishops of that region, asking them to lay hands on him and send him into > the East. They did so, and sent him to Seleucia. Thereafter the Western > bishops allowed the Eastern bishops to elect and consecrate a new leader > after the death of the old one without him needing to go to Antioch, and > wrote them a letter to this effect, that the grand metropolitan of the East > might be proclaimed catholicus and patriarch; although the patriarch of > Antioch was greatly displeased with the whole idea. Ahadabui departed to the > Lord after fulfilling his office for fifteen years, and was buried in the > church of Seleucia. Bar Hebraeus, Ecclesiastical Chronicle (ed. Abeloos and > Lamy), ii. 24‚Äì6 This story is regarded patently fictitious, as the cuoinage 'patriarchate of Antioch' is a later attribution to the holder of the lineage, and not applied by the third century AD. The legend of Ahadabui and Qamisho was probably concocted in the sixth century to buttress the claim of the Church of the East to be an autonomous and independent church. The patriarch Joseph (551‚Äì67) is known to have forged much of the early history of the Church of the East, and he may have invented the story.Bar Hebraeus, Ecclesiastical Chronicle (ed.

Edinburgh, Scotland; d. London, England) was a Boston, Massachusetts, bookseller and publisher in the time before the American Revolution. Mein started Boston's first circulating library, and with his business partner, John Fleeming, Mein published the Loyalist newspaper, the Boston Chronicle, the first semi-weekly in New England. Early years Mein, son of John Mein, was born in Edinburgh where he received a good education before entering the bookselling business. In 1754, he apprenticed to Edinburgh bookseller, John Trail, and in 1760, he became Burgess and Guild Brother of Edinburgh. In 1761, Mein advertised a variety of children's books, and in November 1763, he announced that he would give up his business the following year. Career Mein emigrated to Boston in October 1764 with a large quantity of books and linens. With Robert Sandeman (nephew of Robert Sandeman the theologian), Mein opened a store advertising English and Scottish prayer books, and beer from Edinburgh. Within the year, Mein dissolved the partnership with Sandeman. Mein then opened his own bookstore that he named The London Bookstore, and began the first circulating library in Boston.For context, see: List of libraries in 18th century Massachusetts His catalog advertised twelve hundred books, and he offered various payment schedules: \\"One Pound, Eight Shillings, lawful Mondey, per Year; Eighteen Shillings per Half-Year; or Ten and Eight Pence per Quarter.\\" He sold the catalog for a shilling, and restricted loans to one book at a time.Shera (1949), pp.134-136 The library collection included works of history, literature, travel, law, medicine, and the like, in English and French, by authors such as: * Joseph Addison * Aesop * Nathan Bailey * Jane Barker * Gilles Augustin Bazin * Aphra Behn * Robert Beverly * William Biggs * Thomas Blacklock * Humphrey Bland * Giovanni Boccaccio * Jacques-B√©nigne Bossuet * Henry Brooke (writer) * George Buchanan * Edmund Burke * Gilbert Burnet * Thomas Burnet * John Campbell (author) * Miguel de Cervantes * Pierre Fran√ßois Xavier de Charlevoix * Fran√ßois de Chassepol * William Rufus Chetwood * John Cleland * Mary Collyer * William Congreve * Claude Prosper Jolyot de Cr√©billon * Campbell Dalrymple * Daniel Defoe * Pierre Desfontaines * W.H.

Fleeming (or Fleming), the other partner in the firm, Mein and Fleeming, was also a \\"Scotchman\\". They also printed several books and almanacks, including the almanac Mein and Fleeming's register for New-England and Nova Scotia. Bickerstaff's Boston Almanack, 1769. Printed by Mein and Fleeming, and to be sold by John Mein at the London Book-Store, North-side of King-Street, Boston King-Street, Boston The Boston Chronicle was a Tory paper and began by publishing articles from London critical of William Pitt who was the Whig‚Äôs hero. The Boston Gazette responded with a letter (01/18/1768) probably written by James Otis attacking the views of the Chronicle. Mein visited the office of the Gazette (01/25/1768) demanding to know who wrote the article. Benjamin Edes would not reveal the source of the letter. A day later Mein ran into Edes on the street and attacked him. James Otis representing Edes won an award of ¬£70. Opposed to boycotting goods subject to stamp duties, Mein wrote in the Chronicle in support of the colonial policy of the British government including, in 1769, lists of names that accused colonial merchants of breaking a British nonimportation agreement. In retaliation, Mein's name appeared on a list of merchants who violated the trade agreement. Mein responded by publishing another letter, this time accusing the Merchants' Committee of using the nonimportation agreement for illegal profiteering. The irritated public ransacked the Chronicle and Mein's office in October 1769. In the scuffle, Mein shot a grenadier. He sought safety on a ship in the harbor which sailed for Great Britain a few days later. Previously in July 1769 Thomas Longman a supplier of books to both Mein and John Hancock wrote the latter for a suggestion of a representative in Boston who would represent him in his attempts to obtain payment for books owed to him by Mein. Hancock seeing this as a golden opportunity offered himself. In October while Mein was travelling east to London, the Power of Attorney was travelling west to John Hancock. Mein left New England 2000 pounds in debt. Upon reaching England, he made contact with Lord Dartmouth and gave his perspective of affairs in colonial Massachusetts. Thereafter, Mein spent a year in King's Bench Prison. Upon release, he wrote against the patriot movement in various London newspapers. He returned to Boston where he was convicted for failing to meet his financial obligations, with no mention of the grenadier. He made an attempt at re- establishing his bookseller and library business with limited success. After spending some time in Boston's prison, Mein returned to England. The Boston Chronicle was being operated by Mein‚Äôs partner John Fleeming and had stopped publishing the attacks on the patriots. In March, 1770 John Hancock represented by John Adams was granted an attachment of ¬£2000. The Sheriff subsequently accepted the pledges of Mein‚Äôs friends and the Chronicle stayed in business. Finally in September 1770 Mein, unable to come to terms with his creditors realized he had lost. In November the Inferior Court ruled against him and the Supreme Court ruled against his appeal. John Hancock disposed of all of his assets but the creditors still received only 50% of what they were owed. John Hancock however had a great victory as he had destroyed a critic while undermining freedom of the press.

He was born November 25, 1829 in Versailles. He was educated at Lyc√©e Bourbon. He came with his father to the California Gold Rush. He married Louise Constantin (1827‚Äì1894) August 14, 1852 in San Francisco, and worked for a French language newspaper, L'echo du Pacifique founded by √âtienne Derbec. He and his family arrived on the Restless from San Francisco February 18, 1855 in Honolulu. He accepted a position as translator to Louis Emile Perrin the Consul (diplomatic rank below that of ambassador) from France to the Kingdom of Hawaii. he became friends with Scot Robert Crichton Wyllie who spoke several languages due to his travel throughout South America and the Pacific. At that time France and Great Britain were allies in the Crimean War. In 1857 he traveled to the island of Hawaii with German Hermann von Holt. They toured Kƒ´lauea volcano, and visited the rancher John Palmer Parker. They hired the guide \\"Jack\\" Purdy who told the story of earlier adventurer Julius Brenchley. Purdy then led them in an ascent of Mauna Kea, the highest mountain in the Pacific. When Perrin died in 1862 he became acting Consul from France. In July 1863 he visited the island of Kauai, including a visit of the Princeville sugarcane plantation owned by Wyllie. On December 7, 1863 he was appointed to the Privy Council for King Kamehameha V and on 14 to become the Minister of Finance. Immediately the new king caused a political crisis by refusing to take an oath to the constitution. After a constitutional convention did not agree with his proposal, Kamehameha V proclaimed his own 1864 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Varigny generally supported the new constitution, which gave both the king and cabinet ministers more power, and limited voters with property requirements. From 1864 through 1868 he served in the House of Nobles of the legislature. On January 21, 1865 he was appointed to the Bureau of Immigration and Bureau of Public Instruction. After the death of Wyllie Varigny became Minister of Foreign Affairs on December 21, 1865. One of his first acts was to call off the efforts of John Bowring for negotiating a three-way treaty between France, Great Britain, and the United States. Varigny instead favored an individual reciprocity treaty with each country. Charles Coffin Harris had negotiated a tentative treaty with American Commissioner Edward Moody McCook. However, in the meantime the under Captain William Reynolds had arrived February 9, 1867 and refused to leave in response to rumors that France was going to take over the islands. Harris lodged a protest to Secretary of State William Henry Seward. Seward had just completed the Alaska Purchase. Rumors circulated that the U.S. was ready to invade, and some Americans on the islands indicated they would support such a move. On August 28, 1867 Reynolds claimed possession of Midway Atoll. The Captain's clerk leaked letters to the Hawaiian government alleging a conspiracy for starting a rebellion. Varigny forwarded the letters to the U.S. State Department, who then requested to have the clerk arrested. In March 1868 an increase in volcanic activity resulted in the 1868 Hawaii earthquake and resulting tsunami that caused damage throughout the islands. Varigny helped organize bringing aid to the victims. On May 6, 1868 the Lackawanna sailed back to San Francisco and the clerk was court-martialed. He was found guilty, but quietly had his sentence suspended, probably to avoid any embarrassing publicity. Later in 1868 he returned to France. He tried to negotiate treaties between Hawaii and European powers, but the conflicts leading up to the Franco-Prussian War prevented much progress. A short treaty with Russia was signed June 19, 1869. He also negotiated treaties with the North German Confederation and Denmark, but these were rejected by the Hawaiian government because they did not allow for any other reciprocity agreements. His leave of absence expired in November 1869. He asked to continue as envoy, but by the fall of 1870 as relieved of any connection with Hawaii. Harris took over the ministry of foreign affairs, while John Mott- Smith replaced Harris as minister of finance. He published a series of articles about his voyages starting in 1873. He then expanded these stories into a book about his 14 years in the islands, followed by others about his experiences in California and other parts of the Pacific. He died November 9, 1899 in Montmorency, Val-d'Oise near Paris. His son Henry Charles de Varigny was born 1855 and became a biologist.

A few days later, Flowers confirmed to him that she was actually serious about that idea. She was then introduced to a young French producer, Aur√©lien Simon, whose musical project caught her enthusiasm. He introduced her to electro, trained her in DJing techniques and helped her build her image. She progressively began to develop her own mixing style, with influences from some of her favorite artists, including Freddie Mercury, The Black Eyed Peas, and several other top names in the music business. Her first gig was in front of a crowd of celebrities such as Lenny Kravitz and Mariah Carey, during the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, at the Villa Murano.

The film was Lara Polop's last as a director, and continues the themes of eroticism and horror found throughout his works.Francisco Lara Polop, IMDb.com Synopsis The film begins in 18th century Spain, with Father Lorenzo (Paul McGann) and Mother Agueda (Isla Blair) being tried before the Spanish Inquisition, and Lorenzo agreeing to confess and tell his story in order to escape torture. The setting then turns to the past, where Lorenzo is a charismatic and admired priest. He listens to a confession by a young nun named Sister Ines (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), who has become pregnant, and reports her to the covenant's leader, Mother Agueda, despite the girl's pleas for help. After this, a young monk named Juan reveals to Lorenzo she is actually a woman, Matilde de la Venegas (Sophie Ward). Matilde is a wealthy orphan who fell in love with Lorenzo while attending one of his sermons, and entered his covenant in disguise in order to be near him. Lorenzo goes to report her and she threatens to commit suicide, claiming she does not care about the damnation this act would bring her. Elsewhere in the covenant, the nuns are gathered and debating what to do with Sister Ines. Some of the nuns want to report to her the Inquisition, following protocol and ensuring the girl a fair trial, but Agueda, angered by Ines's denials of her advances, convinces the nuns that the girl's obvious guilt allows the covenant to deal with her themselves, and they imprison Ines in a cell beneath the monastery. Matilde continues to pursue Lorenzo, though he still wants her to leave, as he is attracted to her and afraid of breaking his priestly vows. She agrees to go, but as Lorenzo reaches into the garden to give her a goodbye rose, he is bitten by a snake. He recovers only to discover Matilde saved his life by sucking the venom from his wound, poisoning herself gravely ill in the process. Lorenzo is overcome by her love for him and they make love, breaking Lorenzo's vows. Ramon (Mark Elstob), a young nobleman and Ines‚Äô lover, coming looking for her at the covenant, but is turned away. When he later returns with a papal order for Ines‚Äô release from the covenant, Agueda lies to him that Ines died from a sudden illness. Lorenzo becomes the confessor for an elderly member of his congregation, and impassioned by his regained sexuality, begins pursuing the woman's innocent daughter Angela (Sophie Linfield). He becomes distant from Matilde and confronts Angela, but she denies him and he is thrown out of the house. Matilde convinces Lorenzo to continue after Angela, saying she will do anything to make him happy, and reveals she knows black magic. Lorenzo agrees to her plan, and in a Satanic ritual Matilde creates a potion that will leave Angela helpless to Lorenzo. That night Angela's mother discovers Lorenzo administering the potion to her sleeping daughter, and Lorenzo kills her to keep her from crying out. Matilde appears to Lorenzo in a demonic form, and instructs him to cover up the murder by making it appear as though she committed suicide. While Lorenzo is attempting to rape Angela in the bedchamber of the covenant, Ramon arrives with the Inquisition and discovers Ines imprisoned in the basement. Needing to hide from the Inquisition, Matilde attempts to kill Angela but is stopped by Lorenzo, who regrets aloud conspiring with Matilde in the first place. The inquisition discovers them in the act and the story returns to the present, where Lorenzo is still being tried before the Inquisition. Agueda is imprisoned for life for her illicit confinement of Ines, and Lorenzo is convinced of devil-worship, and is burned at the stake. Cast Paul McGann (Father Lorenzo Rojas) Sophie Ward (Matilde de la Venegas/Juan) Sophie Linfield (Angela Dauphin) Isla Blair (Mother Agueda) Freda Dowie (Sister Ursula) Mark Elstob (Ramon de Madeira) Aitana Sanchez-Gijon (Sister Ines) Laura Davenport (Dona Elvira Dauphin) Marina Saura (Jacinta) Variance from source text There are a number of differences between the film and the original novel. Lorenzo is named Ambrosio in Lewis's novel, and Angela is named Antonia. The film version leaves out multiple subplots, such the bleeding nun and Lorenzo's sister, and has Lorenzo burned at the stake, omitting the majority of the book's conclusion, which has Lorenzo instead sell his soul to the Devil in order to escape the Inquisition, only to be denied repentance and condemned to eternal torment.

Although Shahlufa is included in traditional lists of primates of the Church of the East, his existence has been doubted by J. M. Fiey, one of the most eminent twentieth- century scholars of the Church of the East. In Fiey's view, Shahlufa was one of several fictitious bishops of Seleucia-Ctesiphon whose lives were concocted in the sixth century to bridge the gap between the late third century bishop Papa, the first historically attested bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, and the apostle Mari, the legendary founder of Christianity in Persia.Fiey, Jalons, 64‚Äì5  Sources  Brief accounts of the life of Shahlufa are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar-Hebraeus (fl. 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century), Amr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century). These accounts differ slightly, and these minor differences are of significance for scholars interested in tracing the various stages in the development of the legend.  Life of Shahlufa  The following brief account of the life of Shahlufa is given by Bar-Hebraeus: > After Ahadabui, Shahlufa. He was a native of Kashkar. After the death of > Ahadabui, the Eastern bishops assembled and consecrated him. He was the > first catholicus to be consecrated by the Eastern bishops.

It binds cannabinoid receptors, acting as an inverse agonist at CB1 receptors. Longer forms of hemopressin containing 2-3 additional amino acids on the N-terminus have been identified in extracts of mouse brain. These longer hemopressin peptides, named RVD-HpŒ± and VD-HpŒ±, bind to CB1 receptors and were originally reported to be agonists. In addition to the Hp peptides from alpha hemoglobin, a related peptide from beta hemoglobin has been found in mouse brain extracts; this peptide, named VD-HpŒ≤, is also an agonist at CB1 cannabinoid receptors. Hemopressin is not an endogenous peptide but rather an extraction artefact [Bauer M, Chicca A, Tamborrini M, Eisen D, Lerner R, Lutz B, Poetz O, Pluschke G, Gertsch J.

Epub 2015 Mar 31.] The original Hp peptide reduces sensitivity to painful stimuli in an experimental model of hyperalgesia. Hp also reduces food intake in mice. However, it remains to be shown if Hp is an endogenous brain peptide. The original purification used boiling acid to extract the peptide from rat brain, and hot acid can specifically cleave D-P bonds. The N-terminally-extended forms RVD-HpŒ± and VD-HpŒ± may represent the true endogenous forms. Role in diet Scientists at the University of Manchester have discovered that hemopressin could be used as an appetite suppressant without having the side effects of many other drugs that are used for this purpose. In laboratory tests hemopressin was administrated to mice and rats, which significantly reduced food intake.

In 1960 Heidi Weber had the vision to establish a museum designed by Le Corbusier ‚Äì this building should exhibit his works of art in an ideal environment created by the architect himself in the then Centre Le Corbusier or Heidi Weber Museum. In April 2014 the building and museum went over to the city of Z√ºrich, and was renamed in May 2016.  Location  The building is located on the Z√ºrichsee lake shore nearby Z√ºrichhorn in the Seefeld quarter. It can be reached by foot (20 minutes from Bellevueplatz‚ÄìSechsel√§utenplatz) or by public transportation: Trams 2 and 4 and bus line 33 to stops H√∂schgasse or Fr√∂hlichstrasse, or bus lines 912 and 916 from Bellevue to Chinagarten, or by the Limmat boats operated by the Z√ºrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (ZSG) towards Z√ºrichhorn.  Centre Le Corbusier building  It is the last building designed by Le Corbusier marking a radical change of his achievement of using concrete and stone, framed in steel and glass, in the 1960s created as a signpost for the future. Le Corbusier made intensive use of prefabricated steel elements combined with multi-coloured enamelled plates fitted to the central core, and above the complex he designed a 'free-floating' roof to keep the house protected from the rain and the sun.

The total ground surface measures 12 x , consisting of welded metal sheets and having a weight of 40 tons. The roof was prefabricated and thereafter, in the biggest possible units, transported to the building site, where it was assembled on the ground. The two finally welded parts of the roof were then lifted to their final height () by a crane and fixed on the pillars. With the frame thus completed, the construction process benefited from the independent roof protection which was at that time already in its proper place. It consists of cubes 2.26 x which were assembled on the site. Walls, windows, ceilings and floors were then screwed onto the steel frame. The walls consist of enamelled panels measuring x . The placing of these enamel panels was planned according to a particular rhythmic system. Finally, the entire building complex was placed on a concrete ground floor. The building has two floors ‚Äì five single- storied and one double-storied rooms. When constructing the building complex, more than 20,000 bolts were used.  Museum  The Centre Le Corbusier can be considered a Gesamtkunstwerk, i.e. a total work of art, and reflects the harmonic unity of Le Corbusier's architecture, sculptures, paintings, furniture designs and his writings, which is unique and possibly the only one such existing structure in the world. In 1968/69 J√ºrg Gasser's comprehensive photographic survey related to Chandigarh was exhibited; the Z√ºrich photographer had visited the new capital of India's constituent state of Punjab on behalf of Heidi Weber. While Heidi Weber removed Le Corbusier's sculptures, designs and mementos in mid-May 2016 for personal reasons, the city of Z√ºrich as the new owner replaced these items from others sources respectively collections.  History  In 1960 Le Corbusier was mandated by Heidi Weber, a Swiss art collector and patron, to conceive a public exhibition building. One year later, the first drawings for a building to be constructed in concrete were presented, in 1962 the concept was changed to a steel building. Two years later the construction was started. In 1965 Le Corbusier died, and on 15 July 1967, the Centre Le Corbusier was officially inaugurated. On 13 May 1964 the city government presented the plot of land for the museum in construction law for 50 years free of charge. Therefore, on 13 May 2014 the building became the property of the city of Z√ºrich represented by the newly created public Heidi Weber Foundation ‚Äì Centre Le Corbusier. The board of trustees is represented by the city as well as by Mrs Heidi Weber: I welcome this solution. It helps me to be able to enter the house in new hands. By April 2016 the Heidi Weber Foundation ‚Äì Centre Le Corbusier preserved the last building designed by Le Corbusier, organized exhibitions, and collected and documents related to the architect's work. In an interview end of May 2016, Heidi Weber stated that she's disappointed that the city of Z√ºrich renamed the museum and building in Pavillon Le Corbusier, while ignoring the well- established name Heidi Weber Museum. Otherwise, municipal officials stated that the museum's name Centre Le Corbusier ‚Äì Heidi Weber Museum was damned by Mrs Weber. In mid-May 2016 Heidi Weber vacated the museum and removed images, sketches, sculptures, tapestry, furniture, the original models of the building, and an archive of Corbusier's letters and notes, after negotiations with the city of Z√ºrich failed from her perspective. An agreement with Heidi Weber had failed at their price expectations, the mayor's office annotated. Weber has pursued legal action to have her name restored to the museum. Mid-2016 the museum was admininistered by the cultural department of the city of Z√ºrich, after the establishment of a foundation no longer was to realize, according to the city's officials, due to changes in the law. While a plaque at the museum's entrance points Weber's merits and hold the gratitude of the city of Z√ºrich, Weber negotiates with the cities of Shanghai and Santiago de Chile on the opening of a Corbusier-house, her son complemented in the interview end of May 2016. The museum was run by Eva Wagner from 2014 to 2017. During this period, there were four temporary exhibitions on the work and personality of Le Corbusier, as well as works by the Swiss architect. Since then, the pavilion has attracted a total of around 35,000 visitors in the summer months. On 1 October 2017 the museum closed and the interim operation ended.  Reorganisation and renovation  The listed pavilion will be renovated until spring 2019. From then on, the Museum f√ºr Gestaltung will operate the pavilion. A jury of experts unanimously chose the concept of the museum in September 2017 because it convinced with an \\"attractive, tailor-made programme for exhibitions and accompanying events\\". In December 2016, the city parliament had approved operating subsidies of CHF 500,000 per annum for the new sponsorship for the years 2019 to 2022. In addition, the city will be exempted from rent of CHF 220,000 per annum.  Cultural heritage of national importance  The museum is listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class A object of national importance.

He is traditionally believed to have sat from 377 to 399, though these dates have been disputed by some modern scholars. Like several other early bishops of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, he is included in the traditional list of patriarchs of the Church of the East.  Sources  Brief accounts of Qayyoma's episcopate are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (floruit 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth- century),  øAmr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century). His life is also covered in the Chronicle of Seert. In all these accounts he is anachronistically called 'catholicus', a term that was only applied to the primates of the Church of the East in the fifth century. Modern assessments of his episcopate can be found in Wigram's Introduction to the History of the Assyrian Church and David Wilmshurst's The Martyred Church.Wigram, Assyrian Church, 84‚Äì85; Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church, 17‚Äì18  Qayyoma's episcopate  The following account of Qayyoma's episcopate is given by Bar Hebraeus: > After Tamuza, Qayyoma.

Five years after his consecration a peace > was made between Arcadius, the emperor of the Greeks, and Yazdegerd, the > king of the Persians, who had also persecuted the Christians. Marutha, > bishop of Maiperqat, a wise man of admirable learning, was sent as an > ambassador for this business, and on his arrival peace was restored for the > Christians. Then Qayyoma gathered all the Eastern bishops in the presence of > Marutha, and persuaded them to depose him as unfit for his office. 'I only > accepted the office because I was compelled to do so, as none of you wanted > to be in charge.

He is included in the traditional list of patriarchs of the Church of the East. Biography The following account of Ahha's reign is given by Bar Hebraeus: > After Isaac, Ahai. His name derives from 'brotherhood', and he was so called > because in his homilies and exhortations he frequently called his people his > brothers. Just as today the chanters say 'My loved ones' or, when using the > plural, some say 'My brothers', he used to take over that habit for the > singular, and say 'My brother'. In Greek he is called Achaeus. He was a man > of outstanding virtue and learning, given to fasting and oratory, and > hospitable, who led a monastic life throughout his catholicate. After > fulfilling his office for seven years he departed to his Lord and was buried > at Seleucia.Bar Hebraeus, Ecclesiastical Chronicle (ed. Abeloos and Lamy), > ii. 52 A slightly longer and more circumstantial account is given by Mari: > Ahai. The leadership fell to this man by the common consent of the faithful. > It was his custom to eat only bread and vegetables, cooked and in small > quantities, and only just to taste it, so that he preserved a perpetual > fast. Before he assumed his patriarchal responsibilities he made a > pilgrimage to see the monuments of the martyrs who suffered for Christ under > Shapur, and wrote their acts, and edited an entire volume on their deeds and > why each one was martyred. He also wrote a history of Mar Abda. He died > after fulfilling his office for seven years and a few months. In his time > the relics of Stephen the martyr were found and displayed in Jerusalem. > Hormizd also accepted baptism, and built churches and protected the > Christians. He built a very large church in the place where the bones of > Stephen lay, in which miracles were performed. The times thus turned > favourable for Ahai. He was buried in al-Mada√Øn [Seleucia-Ctesiphon].Mari, > 31 (Arabic), 27 Latin  Sources  Brief accounts of Ahha's reign are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (floruit 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century), Amr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century). In all these accounts he is anachronistically called 'catholicus', a term that was only applied to the primates of the Church of the East towards the end of the fifth century.

Shils most significant contribution to Penn was the 1973 founding of the Wharton Entrepreneurial Center, renamed in 1985 to the Sol C. Snider Entrepreneurial Center, at Penn's Wharton School of Business. While entrepreneurship is widely accepted as an academic discipline today, the Center was the first of its kind in the world. Shils served as the Center's director until 1986. Shils described the impetus in founding the center as, \\"I felt the way to get students interested in creating things was to hear from people who had been successful creating them.\\" \\"I found that most of these huge corporations had all the seeds of bureaucracy in them. They really wanted 'me too' guys and gals rather than people who would challenge what they were doing.

The first three degrees (Bachelors, Masters, Doctorate) were all earned in the normal course. However, after a long career as a professor and chair of the management department at Wharton and founding the Entrepreneurial Center, Shils returned to law school and received his law degree and two other degrees from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He subsequently passed the Pennsylvania Bar Exam and operated a law practice from his Center City consulting office. For 50 years, Shils served as Executive Director of the Dental Manufacturers of America and the Dental Dealers of America. After his death, the dental industry established the Edward B.

The film documents environmentalists' opposition to the mine as unsympathetic to the needs and desires of the locals, prevents industrial progress, and consequently locks the people of the area into lives of poverty. Film content The documentary follows Gheorghe Lucian, a 23-year-old unemployed miner from the Ro≈üia MontanƒÉ in northern Romania, whose chance of a new job disappeared after an anti-mining campaign orchestrated by foreign environmentalists. The contested mining project was expected to bring in a $1 billion investment and generate 600 jobs in an area where unemployment is 70 percent. After investigating the Romanian mine, the director McAleer and Lucian then travel to other impoverished communities in Madagascar and Chile that are also waiting for large mining projects. In the documentary, Lucian meets Mark Fenn from the World Wildlife Fund, who is shown living in luxurious conditions, at one point showing off his $35,000 sailboat to the cameras, all the while advocating the value of living a simplistic, village life. Stated purpose Director Phelim McAleer has stated in interviews that the film, in its essence, is not really at all a story about mining, but rather, \\"It is a story about human rights. The human right to a job, the human right to have your children educated, the human right to see your child reach their first birthday.\\" He cites among other serious concerns, the fact that high infant mortality rates are closely correlated with the sort of poverty that afflicts the region. The film notes that the foreign environmentalists who are barring the industrial development of the area are, at best, too far removed from the people of Ro≈üia MontanƒÉ to understand their true needs and desires, and at worst, cognizant of the serious problems, and still stubbornly denying them of their right to decide the fate of their own land for themselves. McAleer points out the hypocrisy of the western environmentalists' opposition to the mining of the mineral resources, while the western world itself was built by riches that it pulled from the Earth; to deny the people of Ro≈üia MontanƒÉ the same sort of development and prosperity, he concludes, is the height of casuistry. To respond to the claim that the mining operation would destroy Ro≈üia MontanƒÉ's \\"quaint\\" appeal, McAleer also points out that one of the Romanian government's stipulations was that Gabriel Resources would be required to clean up the existing pollution (the soil and water near the village contain high levels of cadmium and lead), and also would be required to maintain a fund with $30 million to be used for further clean-up of the area after the mining company discontinues its operations there. Criticisms Criticisms of the film included the claim by environmentalist groups that the film was partly funded by Gabriel Resources, the Canadian mining company behind the proposed project, a fact which the filmmakers readily admit. The filmmakers disputed the implication that this funding affected the content of the film, claiming the funders had \\"absolutely no control\\" over the film and never saw any parts of the film before it was complete, allowing him to create what he called the \\"most independent documentary [he had] ever made.\\" The president of Gabriel Resources, Alan Hill, said at the first screening of the movie, \\"Before, the environmentalists would lob mortars at us and we would keep our heads down. Now, there is a big push back.\\" See also * Not Evil Just Wrong * FrackNation ReferencesExternal links  Trailer Category:2006 films Category:Documentary films about mining Category:Documentary films about business Category:Irish documentary films Category:Irish films Category:English-language films Category:2006 documentary films Category:Sponsored films Category:American independent films Category:American films Category:Environmentalism in Europe Category:Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ Project ","title":"Mine Your Own Business"},{"id":"26651027","text":"Hilliard Gerald (\\"Jerry\\") Adler (October 30, 1918 - March 13, 2010) was a harmonica player whose performances have been used in numerous film soundtracks.

The Bill for the Benefit of the Indigent Insane (also called the Land-Grant Bill For Indigent Insane Persons, formally the bill \\"Making a grant of public lands to the several States for the benefit of indigent insane persons\\") was proposed legislation that would have established asylums for the indigent insane, and also blind, deaf, and dumb, via federal land grants to the states. The bill was vetoed by president Franklin Pierce. The bill was the signature initiative of activist Dorothea Dix, and passed both houses of Congress in 1854. However, it was vetoed on May 3, 1854 by President Franklin Pierce, the first of his nine vetoes. Pierce argued that the federal government should not commit itself to social welfare, which he believed was properly the responsibility of the states.Tiffany, Francis. (1890). The Life of Dorothea Lynde Dix. Boston: The Riverside Press. pp. 180. The main provision of the bill was to set aside of federal land: for the benefit of the insane, and the remainder to be sold for the benefit of the \\"blind, deaf, and dumb\\", with proceeds distributed to the states to build and maintain asylums. The initial request, on June 23, 1848, had been for five million acres (20,000 km¬≤), which was subsequently expanded.  Context and legacy  The bill was part of the first wave of public mental health initiatives in the United States, which saw the establishment of asylums. The bill is seen as a landmark in social welfare legislation in the United States. Pierce's veto established a precedent for federal non- participation in social welfare that lasted over 70 years, until the emergency legislation and New Deal of the 1930s Great Depression. Compare instead the county institution of the poor farm. No further federal legislation on mental health occurred for over 90 years until 1946 when the National Mental Health Act was passed, establishing federal mental health policy.

She is engaged to another, but when her fiance leaves on a business trip, Harry asks her to join him for dinner.

He initially served with the British Army as an interpreter during the Mesopotamian campaign of the First World War. Captured by the Ottomans after the disastrous Siege of Kut, he was eventually released and found his way back into the employ of the British. After the war, he became a politician in the Kingdom of Iraq and worked to support the cause of the Assyrians both domestically and globally. During the early 1930s, when Iraq was granted independence by the British, Malek worked to petition the British government for a firmer response to Iraqi atrocities such as the Simele massacre of 1933. After Malek was forcefully expelled from his office after independence, he went into exile in Cyprus. Malek later published a book, The British Betrayal of the Assyrians, in which he criticized the British government for their \\"betrayal\\" of the Assyrians and abandoning them to the massacres of the Iraqis. Malek died in 1959, his vision of an independent Assyria unfulfilled. Early life and career=Malek as a youth Yusuf Malek was born in Baghdad on March 28, 1899 to Assyrians from Tel Keif in the district of Nineveh, the ancient Assyrian capital. He eventually gained the nickname of \\"Tel Kef's son\\" among his fellow Assyrians. There, he attended the Latin college. He had also attended the American college in Basra before World War I broke out. During the British occupation of Basra in 1914, Yusuf was working as an interpreter for them. This military service ended on November 25, 1915 when British troops, Yusuf among them, attempted to capture Ctesiphon, a city 26 miles southeast of Baghdad. This was the first attempt to capture Baghdad from the Ottoman Empire and it had failed. After the Ottomans had routed the British, they besieged them for five months at Kut el-Amara, ending in a British surrender along with 10,000 casualties. The survivors, including Yusuf, were sent on a death march to Turkey to work in railroad chain gangs. Remarkably, Yusuf was able to escape Turkey two months later and was re-employed by the British in 1917. Political beginnings After the war ended, Yusuf was appointed as an assistant to the governor of Samara. But since Yusuf's belief that a future Assyria depended on the sale of oil to Western nations from Bet-Nahrein (which coincided with French and British political developments in that region), he was able to get promotion to Secretary Inspector for the State of Nineveh. Because this sale would also benefit the newly established Turkey, a perpetrator of the Assyrian genocide during the First World War, Yusuf worked with other Assyrian leaders to establish an autonomous and sovereign Assyrian nation. Equally pressing was the formation of the new country, Iraq, in 1921 that could mean the end of any hope to establish an Assyrian country. Placed as the ruler of Iraq by the British was Faisal Al Husain, whom Yusuf would come to hate in later years.http://www.aina.org/books/bbota.pdf Discontent with the government=Betrayal Nineveh was given to Iraq in the 1924 Conference of Constantinople. Hakkari though, also had a great many Assyrians living there. Being in Turkish territory, the Turks have decided to drive them out of Hakkari and into Northern Iraq. Trying to resolve the issue, the League of Nations mandated that the Mosul Vilayet was to be ceded to the British and that Hakkari was to stay as part of Turkey. The Assyrian homeland was thus split in two. On August 16, 1930 Yusuf was promoted to mayor of Sheehan in Northern Iraq. Two days later, the Minister of the Interior ordered Yusuf to be transferred to Nassiriya, at least 400 miles southeast of Yusuf's current station. Because there was really no reason as to why he must do this, Yusuf refused, thus angering the officials in the Iraqi government. Yusuf was not able to hold his position for long. Three months later in November, the U.K. decided to hand over control of Iraq to the Arab majority, not the Christian- Assyrian minority. This resulted in many high ranking Assyrian officials to be removed from office, Yusuf included. Fighting back Much embittered by how much the British had abandoned the Assyrians, Yusuf left Sheehan and went to Beirut, a city under French rule, where he wrote publications attacking the British and Iraqi governments. Only a few days after the Simele massacre occurred, where Assyrians in Northern Iraq were killed under the orders of Faisal, Yusuf went into exile in Cyprus in 1933.http://www.aina.org/books/bbota.pdf There, he met with the patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East, Mar Ishai Shimun, and went to Europe to speak for the \\"Assyrian Cause\\". Although he was turned down for an audience in Switzerland, London, and France; Yusuf lectured many politicians on what was happening in the Middle East. The \\"Assyrian Cause\\", though, would only become international with the release of his book. \\"The British Betrayal of the Assyrians\\" Published in 1935, \\"The British Betrayal of the Assyrians\\" allowed for the \\"Assyrian Cause\\" to reach the eyes and ears of a global audience. Blaming the British government for supporting an incompetent ruler such as Faisal, he further expressed his anger at the British for their lackluster response to the Simele Massacre of 1933. Although he stated that he \\"personally [knew] many English gentlemen who had done all in their power to make the Assyrian position tolerable and are now ashamed to find the Assyrians persecuted\\", the British government had erred in their support of the \\"cruel\\" Arabs and abandonment of their Assyrian allies. He also criticized the British suppression of the Kurdish revolt against the Iraqis, stating that the British should have supported the vision of an independent Kurdistan instead of supporting Faisal no matter the cost for the sole purpose of protecting their oil interests in Iraq. Malek expressed outrage that the British had neglected to fulfill their promise of an independent nation, leaving the Assyrians to be helplessly murdered by the Arabs.http://www.aina.org/books/bbota.htm  See also  * Assyrian Levies * Our Smallest Ally References Category:People from Baghdad Category:Ottoman Assyrian politicians Category:Assyrians of the Ottoman Empire Category:Interpreters Category:1959 deaths Category:1899 births ","title":"Yusuf Malek"},{"id":"26651464","text":"The Afghan President Hamid Karzai announced the holding of a consultative grand council called the Afghanistan's National Consultative Peace Jirga (NCPJ)\\"Afghanistan needs continued global support during critical transition period ‚Äì UN\\" or shortly Peace Jirga in his inauguration speech on 19 November 2009,\\"Inauguration Speech by His Excellency Hamid Karzai President\\" after winning elections for a second term, to end the ongoing Taliban insurgency. At the International Afghanistan Conference in London on 28 January 2010, he announced that the government would hold the event in April or May 2010, intended to bring together tribal elders, officials and local power brokers from around the country, to discuss peace and the end of the insurgency. \\"Jirga\\" is a word in the Pashto language that means \\"large assembly\\" or \\"council\\". It is a traditional method in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan of resolving disputes between tribes or discussing problems affecting whole communities.\\"Q+A: What is Afghanistan's \\"peace jirga\\"?\\" President Hamid Karzai organized the event on 2‚Äì4 June 2010, that was presided by the former Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani, despite the Taliban rejecting any overtures. However, after a nine-year U.S.-led war with no clear victory in sight, there were signs many Afghans, including victims of the Taliban's 1996-2001 rule, would be increasingly tempted by the idea of negotiations with the hardline islamists. The event was billed as an attempt to gain consensus on how to approach peace talks with insurgents, but had already met skepticism and even a boycott from some Afghan leaders. About 1,600 delegates, including 300 women, tribal elders, religious leaders and members of parliament from all over the country attended the NCPJ. The three-day assembly represented the first major public debate in Afghanistan on how to end the war. The jirga was meant to be a consultative forum, aimed at the building of a national consensus on a peace plan, likely to be presented to the Kabul Conference on July 20, a gathering of the ministers of foreign affairs of over 70 partner countries of Afghanistan, international and regional organizations and financial institutions. The NCPJ was expected to be comparable to the two loya jirgas that had been held in Kabul since the collapse of the Taliban regime end of 2001; the first one to confirm Hamid Karzai as a transitional leader and the second in 2003/2004 to approve the constitution of the newly founded Islamic Republic of Afghanistan after the ousting of the Taliban regime. The event was hoped to become a start of a new chapter in Afghanistan‚Äôs political life, bringing the country together and strengthening the position of President Karzai.\\"NATO Has High Hopes for Afghan Peace Council\\" Background Article 110, Chapter Six, of Afghanistan‚Äôs constitution recognises the Loya jirga as ‚Äúthe highest manifestation of the will of the people of Afghanistan‚Äù. The constitution also lays down the composition of jirga in general. The Afghans trace the history of jirga to time immemorial, while historically the term \\"Loya jirga\\" has never been used before the second decade of 20th century. On the celebrations of Nowruz, New Year's Day, of 1389 (21 March 2010, Western calendar) in Mazar-i-Sharif in Northern Afghanistan, the Afghan Vice President Mohammad Qasim Fahim reached out to militants. He declared that, with their input, the coming national conference would lay the foundations for a peace that would end the Taliban insurgency. He called on resistance forces to participate in a jirga, or assembly, planned for late April or early May. He pledged that the Afghan government \\"will try to find a peaceful life for those Afghans who are unhappy,\\" a euphemism for militants, though he didn't mention the Taliban by name. Afghans had travelled from across the country to Mazar-i-Sharif united behind the wish that the advent of a new year would bring them peace. According to the police, up to half a million people are in the city to mark the spring equinox and the first day of the traditional Persian new year and celebrated across Central Asia and Iran. Mazar is at the heart of one of the most peaceful regions of the country. City police chief Abdul Rauf Taj said that 4,000 security personnel had been deployed against insurgent attacks and that all visitors were being screened at seven check points around the city perimeter.\\"Afghans celebrate new year with hopes for peace\\" Harun Zarghun, chief spokesman for Afghanistan's second largest insurgent group Hezb-e-Islami led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, said that a five-member delegation was in Kabul to meet with government officials and that there were also plans to meet with Taliban leaders somewhere in Afghanistan. Khalid Farooqi, a member of the parliament from Paktika province, confirmed that two delegations from Hizb-i-Islami had shown up. Zarghun, the group's spokesman in Pakistan, said that the delegation had a 15-point plan that called for the retreat of foreign forces in July 2010 - a full year ahead of President Barack Obama's intended withdrawal. The plan also called for the replacement of the current Afghan parliament in December 2010 by an interim government, or shura, which then would hold local and national elections within a year. Zarghun said that a new Afghan constitution would be written, merging the current version with ones used earlier.\\"Militant group in Kabul with draft peace deal\\"\\"13 die in Afghanistan amid calls for peace talks with insurgents\\"\\"Militant group in Kabul with draft peace deal\\"\\"Afghan Militants Seek Peace Deal\\" The event would bring together lawmakers, provincial council chiefs, tribal and religious leaders, and members of civil society‚Äîa total of some 1,600 Afghans‚Äîto talk about a political resolution to the insurgency. Many Afghans said their hopes for the NCPJ were low, while organizers played down its aims by emphasizing that it is just one step in a long process. Critics said that the list of invited delegates was stacked with Karzai backers who were not representative of Afghanistan. They also said that the purpose was not clear and that talk of peacemaking means nothing if the Taliban were not present. The main political opposition bloc, the National Front, complained that its members were intentionally left off the list of invitees. \\"This sounds like a PR exercise to show that we are making an effort to achieve peace in this country\\", said Abdullah Abdullah, the bloc's candidate in the 2009 presidential election.\\"For Karzai, Afghan peace meeting is key chance to regain political legitimacy\\" Postponement The NCPJ was originally scheduled to start in early May. It was pushed back until late May to allow Karzai to visit Washington and speak with U.S. President Barack Obama about the event. During May 2010, the Afghan government said \\"technicalities\\" forced it to delay the gathering again, this time until June 2. According to a spokesman for the jirga, Gul Agha Ahmadi Wardak, it was difficult trying to arrange the logistics for bringing so many local and regional delegates to Kabul from across the whole country. A minority of about 45 of the 249 members of the Wolesi Jirga (Lower House) threatened to boycott the NCPJ unless Karzai responded to their demand to submit names of new cabinet nominees to replace those rejected by the parliament in January 2010. The president submitted his list of cabinet nominees to the parliament twice, but many of the proposed ministers did not receive a vote of confidence from the parliament. The Parliament had refused to confirm 11 of Karzai's 25 nominees. Although no senior members of the Taliban were expected to attend the NCPJ, the gathering was meant to include some other supporters of the insurgency, including delegates with ties to extremist leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.\\"Afghanistan's Peace Jirga Pushed Back Until June\\" Absence of Taliban and Hezb-i-Islami The Taliban publicly rejected the NCPJ, terming it a phony reconciliation process aimed at securing the interests of foreign powers. They reiterated their stance of not holding peace talks until foreign troops left Afghanistan (in May 2010 NATO had 130,000 troops in the country, likely to rise to 150,000 by August 2010) and announced the launch of a new offensive against foreign and Afghan troops, diplomats, and government workers. In spite of previous openings, not only the Taliban but also the Hezb-i-Islami led by warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, as well as several other insurgent leaders, dismissed the jirga. Hekmatyar announced to open talks with the Afghan government after US President Barack Obama and other Western leaders mentioned the possibility of troop withdrawal as early as July 2011. Some of Hekmatyar's demands ‚Äì such as foreign troop starting to withdraw already by July 2010 and early elections ‚Äì were unlikely to be accepted by the US and the Afghan government. The 15-point peace plan that his organization delivered in March included several controversial demands. The government would keep its current form after the troops left and the newly elected parliament would review the Constitution. The group hinted a promise to prevent Al Qaeda from operating in the country.\\"Afghanistan warlord Hekmatyar shuns peace jirga but offers own deal\\" Attack Some 12,000 security personnel were on guard against attack from the Taliban, but could not prevent that attacks launched by the Taliban targeted the opening session of the NCPJ on June 2. President Hamid Karzai's speech was interrupted by gunfire and nearby rocket explosions. The first rocket attack struck near the jirga site during his opening address. A gunfight then ensued as police attacked suspected suicide bombers attempting to detonate explosives near the tent where the assembly was held, and a second rocket was later launched. There were no reported casualties among the approximately 1,600 delegates who attended the NCPJ. The Afghan police said they had shot and killed two suspected suicide bombers and taken a third into custody. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. A Taliban spokesman claimed they had sent four suicide bombers to target the assembly, and said they were shooting rockets into the tent from the roof of a nearby building. The attack marked a major failure of the security effort for the meeting. Given the presence of the country's top leaders and foreign diplomats at the venue, the attacks on the NCPJ were seen as a major security failure. Nevertheless, Karzai called on the insurgents to give up their arms. In his speech he called the Taliban ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù and ‚Äúdear Talibs‚Äù. He described their flight to Pakistan and their fighting as an understandable reaction to injustices done by local Afghans who had ‚Äúdisturbed them‚Äú and by foreign troops. ‚ÄúTo those Taliban compelled to flee by the government‚Äôs and foreign troops‚Äô mistakes, they are welcome and can come and join us‚Äù he said. Not welcome were those connected to Al Qaeda and those who have harmed innocent Afghans.\\"Taliban Attacks Shake Afghan Peace Gathering\\"\\"Afghanistan Taliban attack Hamid Karzai's 'peace jirga'\\"  The meeting  When the NCPJ actually took place, on 2‚Äì4 June 2010, the three-day meeting's ending was marked by debate on the plan of the Afghan government to end the country's long civil war and a bombing attempt in the streets of Kabul. There was little indication that the Taliban were inclined to negotiate. Their key demand, expressed outside the jirga, is that all foreign forces withdraw from Afghanistan before any negotiations can begin. President Karzai wanted to use the conference to enlist support for his plan to offer economic incentives to reformed militants. He has proposed offering amnesty and reintegration incentives to people who leave the organization. He also offered to negotiate the removal of some individual Taliban members from a U.N. blacklist and to give certain leaders asylum in another Islamic country to enable peace talks. Participants of the NCPJ pressed for the release of some detainees in U.S. custody. The jirga said that insurgent prisoners should be released, as a goodwill gesture that would precede peace talks with the Taliban. It also emphasized that insurgents who want to participate in the peace process had to cut their ties with foreign terrorist groups, such as al-Qaeda. Karzai's plan to seek a truce with the Taliban drew support of the Afghan leaders present at the NCPJ, but no solid negotiation blueprint emerged. The delegates also called for the international force to take greater steps to avoid civilian casualties.\\"Afghan delegates back talks with Taliban\\"\\"Afghan 'peace jirga' enters final day\\"  Results  After the NCPJ, President Karzai ordered a review of all cases of Taliban suspects being held in Afghan jails and said that those being detained on doubtful evidence should be released. This step was his first official response to the council, that had recommended that Taliban prisoners being held in Afghan custody and by the U.S. military should be released if they were being held on \\"inaccurate statements or unsubstantiated allegations.\\" At the moment of the jirga, hundreds of Taliban and other militant suspects were being held in Afghan jails across the country. Hundreds more, including al- Qaeda operatives suspected of involvement in terrorism, were being held in U.S. military jails in Afghanistan and Cuba. Karzai ordered the formation of a special delegation including officials from the Afghan Supreme Court, a government-backed reconciliation commission, the Justice Ministry and other judicial officers. The delegation had to \\"identify those prisoners who are in jails with not enough evidence\\".\\"Karzai orders review of Afghan Taliban detentions\\" Since October 15, 1999, UN Security Council Resolution 1267 had blacklisted 142 Taliban figures as well as 360 others with ties to Al Qaeda, ordering their bank accounts seized and prohibiting them from crossing international borders.\\"Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) concerning Al-Qaida and the Taliban and Associated Individuals and Entities\\" On 27 January 2010, five Taliban insurgents were de-listed before the London Conference on Afghanistan,\\"SC/9852 - Security Council Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee Approves Deletion of Five Entries from Consolidated List\\" leaving 137 still blacklisted.\\"Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) concerning Al-Qaida and the Taliban and Associated Individuals and Entities\\" Since then, President Karzai had been arguing to remove all Taliban names from the blacklist. He suggested that de-listing should include even the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar and the warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. On 12 June 2010, at a news conference, Staffan di Mistura, the secretary general‚Äôs special representative to Afghanistan, said the United Nations was responding to the call to remove the names of Taliban leaders from the international terrorist blacklist, A delegation from the Security Council‚Äôs Al Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Committee would study the composition of the terrorist blacklist and make recommendations to the Security Council about possible changes. American officials had argued for removal from the blacklist on a case-by-case basis; Russia and China had objected as well to a broad de- listing of the Taliban.\\"United Nations Could Hasten Removal of Taliban Leaders From Terror Blacklist\\"\\"U.N. reviews Taliban, al-Qaeda blacklist\\"\\"U.N. reviewing Taliban blacklist after Afghan jirga\\" In July 2010, Richard Barrett, since March 2004 the coordinator of the monitoring team of the so-called 1267 Committee on al-Qaida and the Taliban, said that removing former Taliban members from the sanction list was a key issue for both the Afghan government and the Taliban. There was a list of 10 candidates to be removed.\\"UN to cautiously review Afghan delisting request: official\\" Already in June, several Taliban suspects were actually released. A new commission was formed to release suspected Taliban prisoners. This commission set free 14 detainees primarily from U.S. custody, two of them boys, and more than two dozen more releases became imminent. The five-member committee had no representation from the intelligence service or any other security agency. Thousands could be freed under the deal, with the warden of Afghanistan's notorious Pul-e-Charkhi prison saying 1,000 Taliban could now be freed from his jail alone.\\"New Afghan commission sets free Talivan suspects\\" Interior Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar passing by Afghan National Police honor guards shortly before he stepped down after the NCPJ On the same day that the review of cases of detained insurgents had been ordered, the chief of the National Directorate of Security Amrullah Saleh and interior minister Hanif Atmar resigned, to take responsibility for their failure in the security of the event,Saleh: I accept I failed as militants had been able to launch an attack during the opening speech of Karzai. Saleh, considered as a hardliner who has railed against Karzai‚Äôs desire for reconciliation efforts to bring the Taliban to the table, was temporarily replaced by Engineer Ibrahim Spinzada. The Interior Ministry revealed that the Taliban had been planning a much larger attack against the NCPJ, that entailed 14 suicide bombers and three other militants. Nine militants equipped with suicide bomb vests and other weapons were arrested before they could enter Kabul. Before the jirga started, police also arrested three other insurgents, one of whom was from Tajikistan and another from Russia, who allegedly were planning suicide attacks.\\"Afghan interior minister, top security official resign - They take the blame for the Taliban's attack on a peace assembly organized last week by President Hamid Karzai\\"\\"Afghan Leader Forces Out Top 2 Security Officials\\" A few days after the jirga, Karzai summoned Hanif Atmar and Amrullah Saleh to explain why they were not able to prevent the attacks but Saleh and Atmar could not come out with a good answer so they decided to resign. He said later that the main reason for his disagreement was Karzai's ordering of the remission of Taliban prisoners.\\"Former Afghanistan Intelligence Chief Says He Quit Because of President Karzai's 'Soft' Policy on Taliban, Says: 'This Soft Behavior Makes the Enemy's Intention Even Stronger and Makes the Confidence of Friends Shaky'\\" Discussion on women's rights Before the event, gender activists pressed the administration of President Karzai for a part in any deal-making with Taliban fighters and leaders. \\"We have not been approached by the government,\\" said Samira Hamidi, director of the Afghan Women's Network. The Taliban's repression of women helped galvanize international opposition in the 1990s, and by some measures democracy had revolutionized Afghan women's lives. They feared that behind closed doors and desperate for a peace settlement, the Afghan government might not be able to force Taliban leaders to accept women's rights.\\"Peace deal could erode Afghan women's progress\\" See also * Politics of Afghanistan * Karzai administration * Operation Moshtarak References Category:2010 in Afghanistan Category:Political history of Afghanistan Category:History of Afghanistan (1992‚Äìpresent) Category:Hamid Karzai ","title":"Afghan Peace Jirga 2010"},{"id":"26651526","text":"Velim is a municipality and village in Kol√≠n District in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic.

The cells, antibodies, and organs of the immune system work to protect and defend the body against not only tumor cells but also bacteria or viruses. Cell division in any living organism is an integral part of life, as worn out cells have to be replaced by newly generated cells. This process of generating new cells varies between organs and the mechanisms involved are highly complex which include the nature and capability of the underlying stem cells, their environment, metabolism, physical and allied biological factors the organ or tissue is subjected to etc., Aberrant cell division takes place that ends up in a cancer cell and such aberrance may be due to faulty stem cell, abnormal genetic components or any other factor such as radiation or a constant irritation. Cancer is still a leading cause of death in the world yet much is still not known about its mechanisms of establishment and destruction. While surgery and/or chemo- and radiotherapies are various treatment modalities available, still in many cases they don‚Äôt offer a permanent cure. Another major point to be addressed about this killer disease is the relapse rate which is very high. Researchers have found that these cells mainly target the cancer cells and not the healthy cells whereas in chemotherapy and radiotherapy the healthy cells are also getting destroyed. Mechanism of action Cancer cells are formed in our body almost every day but we are not affected by them. This is because they are immediately destroyed by the body's immune system. The immune system is a complex network of cells and organs comprising lymphocytes, macrophages, Dendritic cells, Natural Killer cells (NK Cell), Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL), etc., that work together to defend the body against attacks by \\"foreign\\" or \\"non-self\\" invaders including cancer cells. Immediately after a cancer cell is recognized, the Lymphocytes and/or the NK cells attack the cancer cell to kill it. When the immune system is weaker then cancer evolves as a disease and starts growing. Each type of cancer needs a specific combination of treatments aimed at that particular kind of cancer. When the extent of spread of cancer is deep, total removal of the cancer growth by surgery may not be possible. At times, after surgical removal of a part of the cancer, radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy may be necessary to treat the remnant portion of cancer. It is widely known that Chemotherapy has profound toxic side effects and has limitations in efficacy. Radiotherapy is also a very effective mode of treatment in certain types of cancer, but it has its own adverse effects as well. These two modalities affect not only the cancer affected cells, but also the normal cells Now in AIET, specific types of cells mainly the NK cells and T lymphocytes are isolated from the peripheral blood of the cancer patients (during remission in patients who undergo chemotherapy) by proven methods, expanded to 25‚Äì30 fold and activated and then reinfused back into the patient‚Äôs body. These cells act against the cancer cells effectively and recharge the immune system. Upon encountering a tumor cell, the activated NK cell attaches to the membrane of the cancer cell and injects toxic granules which dissolve the target cell. In less than five minutes, the cancer cell dies and the NK cell moves on to its next target cancer cell. A single NK cell can destroy up to 27 cancer cells within its lifespan. This is the mechanism by which AIET is effective in cancer therapy. History Adoptive Immuno cell therapy of cancer was first introduced by Steven Rosenberg and his colleagues of National Institute of Health USA. In the late 80s, they published an article in which they reported a low tumor regression rate (2.6‚Äì3.3%) in 1205 patients with metastatic cancer who underwent different types of active specific immunotherapy (ASI), and they suggest that AIET with specific chemotherapy or radiotherapy as the future of cancer immunotherapy. In the beginning Immunotherapy treatments involved administration of cytokines such as Interleukin. with an aim of inducing the lymphocytes which will carry their activity of destroying the tumour cells. Thereafter the adverse effects of such intravenously administered cytokines lead to the extraction of the lymphocytes from the blood and culture-expand them in the lab and then to inject the cells alone enable them destroy the cancer cells. Till date different kinds of autologous and allogenic immune cells such as lymphokine-activated killer(LAK)cells, Natural killer (NK) cells, Activated Cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTLs), Dendritic cells(DCs), Gene manipulated autologous and allogenic Immune cells have been used in clinical applications of Immunotherapy. The present technology of AIET was developed by Japanese scientists and it is being widely practised in several Asian countries which uses autologous natural killer (NK) cells and activated T lymphocytes to treat various cancers. This treatment modality has been in practice since early 90s and has several random clinical trials in lung cancer, gastric cancer, Ovarian cancer and Liver cancer. which has been published with significant disease free survival rates. One of the largest studies in 1400 patients. has proven that the cell based immunotherapy when combined with conventional treatment the efficacy improves by 20‚Äì30%. A recent finding published about a relapsed stage IV ovarian cancer treated successfully with this methodology has found its place in the Global medical discovery. Status of immunotherapy worldwide Though the concept of this treatment started in the US in 1980s, full-fledged clinical treatments on a routine basis have been in practice in Japan since 1990. Randomized controlled studies in different cancers with significant increase in survival and disease free period have been reported.

Explore 'Killer Cell' Treatment to Cure rare Cancers Relevance to Auto-Immune Diseases Auto-Immune diseases like the Auto-Immune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) have been known to be associated with malignancies. In general lower Natural Killer (NK) profile has been associated with development of cancers by earlier studies. Recently an article has been published in which it has been described that the in vitro expansion of NK cells is decreased in cancer patients who have concomitant Auto-immune Diseases like the AIHA. This study also throws questions on whether AIHA is a complication of malignancies, due to the lower NK cell profile in cancer which would have given rise to the AIHA due to some common antibody between NK cells and Red Blood Cells (RBCs) or whether the AIHA lowers the NK cell profile which in turn causes the cancer. This warrants further investigations into the identification of common antibodies between NK cells & RBCs and also finding new Immuno- therapeutic strategies which can tackle both cancer and auto-immunity References Baskar S, Dedeepiya V D, Terunuma H, Manjunath S R, Senthilkumar R, Sivaraman G, Pandian A, Abraham S.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 24, 2010. In the episode, Kyle, Stan, Kenny, and Cartman write a vulgar book with the sole intention of getting it banned. When Stan's parents discover the manuscript, the boys accuse Butters of writing it, then are enraged when it becomes hailed as a literary masterpiece. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It serves as a satire of pop culture criticism, and mocks people who find hidden messages in works which are not intended to be analysed. The episode includes other themes, including the lack of interest in reading among American youths, and also mocks the idea that a book alone can inspire someone into committing violent crimes. The novel The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger plays a major part in the episode, as the South Park boys are inspired to write their own book when they feel Salinger's book does not live up to its controversial reputation. The episode also mocks actress Sarah Jessica Parker and the Kardashian family. \\"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs\\" received generally positive reviews, with many commentators praising the episode's themes of the over-analysis of works of culture. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by 3.24 million viewers. After the episode aired, Kim, Kourtney, and Khlo√© Kardashian praised their portrayal and on-screen kill-offs.  Plot  The students at South Park Elementary are assigned to read The Catcher in the Rye, and (especially the four main boys) grow excited when Mr. Garrison tells them that the book has caused so much controversy, it has been banned from public schools in the past. However, after reading the book, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick are disappointed to find the content completely inoffensive, and feel the school has \\"tricked\\" them into reading. They decide to write their own offensive novel, The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs (which they originally called The Tale of Scrotie McDickinass), with the intention of disgusting as many people as possible. Later, Stan's parents find the first draft and read it. They find it so disgusting that they repeatedly vomit while reading. However, they both absolutely loved the book. In fear that they will get into trouble for the book's content, Stan and the boys trick Butters Stotch into thinking that he actually wrote the book. Butters believes them because ever since reading The Catcher in the Rye, he feels as though he has been entering into \\"altered states of consciousness\\" that make him want to kill John Lennon, before he finds out (from his father) that Lennon is already dead (\\"Dangit!\\"). Later on, after learning that The Catcher in the Rye also inspired someone to shoot Ronald Reagan, Butters at first goes out to kill him too but is told that he is dead as well, much to his dismay. Butters confesses to writing the novel himself. However, Stan and the boys are furious to learn that not only do the South Park adults love the book, a publisher has agreed to sign Butters for a book deal. The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs becomes a huge success, and everybody who reads it vomits profusely, but declares it a masterpiece nonetheless. As Butters becomes a literary icon, the four boys unsuccessfully campaign to have the book banned. They are angered to find readers interpreting passages from the novel as allegories for contentious political issues, even though the boys never intended to convey such messages. Since the book constantly denigrated actress Sarah Jessica Parker, Cartman and Kenny plan to get her killed, believing the media attention would cause the book to be banned. They dress Parker as a moose (by simply putting antlers on her head), then leave her out in the woods during hunting season. Butters soon does, in fact, write a novel of his very own, The Poop That Took a Pee, which consists solely of simple descriptions of coprophilia combined with some toilet humour. The four boys are convinced the book will be a disaster and publicly expose Butters as a fraud over the first book. However, much to their surprise, readers actually find it an even deeper, more profound book, and continue inserting their own allegorical messages into the text. After finishing the book, one crazed reader storms onto the set of reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians and murders the entire Kardashian family with a pump-action shotgun. Both The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs and The Poop That Took a Pee are banned as a result, and Butters is devastated, mainly because he saw Kim Kardashian as \\"the most beautiful woman in the world\\". Stan and Kyle suggest that rather than reading books and mindlessly discovering nonsensical messages in them, people should simply watch television instead. Cartman also tricks Butters into thinking that he dressed Sarah Jessica Parker in a moose costume, and was therefore responsible for her being shot in the woods. Butters starts to panic at first, but calms down because of \\"how ugly she was anyway\\". Production and theme South Park co-creator Trey Parker wrote \\"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs\\" \\"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs\\" was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA in the United States. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 24, 2010. The episode serves primarily as a satire of pop culture criticism. Although the South Park boys wrote The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs simply to shock and offend people, readers delve too deeply into the meaning behind the book, finding hidden allegories and symbolism that the actual authors insist are not present. People with conflicting philosophies, including liberals and conservatives, and pro-choice and pro-life advocates, attempt to claim that the same work conveys and validates their own ideology. The script serves as a criticism of people who take such works of pop culture too seriously. Although this is demonstrated specifically through literary criticism in the episode, the theme can be extended to film criticism and television criticism as well. The episode suggests people are so desperate for inspiration, they are willing to impose their hopes and dreams into works of art, even if they completely lack those qualities. Some commentators thought South Park creators Parker and Matt Stone were implicitly mocking the amount of analysis into deeper meaning South Park itself often receives in its reviews. Others have suggested this over- analysis is a reference to the number of adult themes identified in the Harry Potter and Twilight young adult novel series. \\"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerBalls\\" portrays young children as almost entirely uninterested in reading. The South Park boys only exhibit excitement for their reading assignment based on the promise of offensive and controversial material in the book. Rather than finding any merit in the book, the boys are angry when they find the material inoffensive, prompting Cartman to declare he has been \\"tricked\\" into reading an entire book. Through the rise and fall of Butters' career as an author, the episode also demonstrates the perils of literary success and hoaxes. The episode also lampoons the notion that a book can be identified as the sole reason for a reader to kill somebody, particularly through Butters' reaction to The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs. Butters experiences blackouts after reading The Catcher in the Rye and chanting \\"Kill John Lennon/Ronald Reagan!\\", until he disappointingly learns they are already dead. Later, a reader of The Poop That Took a Pee murders the Kardashian family.. Cultural references The Catcher in the Rye, the 1951 novel about teenage confusion and alienation by J.D. Salinger, plays a central role in the episode, which references the controversy that book had generated in the years since its publication, owing to its risqu√© elements and use of foul language. Mr. Garrison tells the students the book has only recently been lifted from South Park Elementary's banned books list, a reference to past censorship the book has received in public schools. The episode also refers to the role that the book played in inspiring Mark David Chapman to shoot and kill musician John Lennon, and John Hinckley, Jr. to attempt to assassinate former U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Lennon, a former member of The Beatles and long-time peace activist, is referred to by Cartman as \\"the king of hippies\\". Butters and the eventual murderer rail against 'phonies' in the same manner as Holden Caulfield does in Salinger's book. \\"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs\\" aired two months after the death of author J.D. Salinger, and just weeks after letters by J.D. Salinger went on display at The Morgan Library & Museum in New York City. The episode also prominently features the Kardashian family, who are the focus of the E! reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Sarah Jessica Parker, an actress who has been mocked on South Park before, is also lampooned in the story. During one scene, Butters appears on Today, a morning talk show on NBC (referred to as HBC in the episode, but with NBC's peacock logo), to promote his book. Television hosts Matt Lauer and Meredith Vieira are featured in the scene, during which both vomit for a particularly long time in response to some of the more vulgar passages in The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs. Morgan Freeman, an actor known for his narration work, conducts a reading in the episode of Butters' second book, The Poop That Took a Pee. Trey Parker provided the voice of Freeman in \\"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs\\". During one scene, Butters' father can be seen reading a newspaper with a front-page story about a historic health care bill passing, a reference to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was passed and signed the same week the South Park episode first aired. Release and reception In its original American broadcast on March 24, 2010, \\"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs\\" was watched by 3.24 million viewers, according to the Nielsen Media Research, making it the most watched cable television show of the night. The episode received an overall 1.9 rating/3 share. Among viewers between ages 18 and 49, it received a 1.8 rating/5 share, and among male viewers between 18 and 34, it received a 3.5 rating/12 share. As a result of the episode, the phrase \\"Scrotie McBoogerballs\\" was the top trending topic for March 25 on the social networking and microblogging website Twitter. \\"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park's fourteenth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on April 26, 2011. The episode was also released on the two-disc DVD collection A Little Box of Butters. \\"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs\\" received generally positive reviews. Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine called the episode a potential classic and a \\"phenomenal follow up showing\\" to the season premiere \\"Sexual Healing\\", which he did not enjoy. Delgado said the script was intelligent and praised the theme of over- analyzing art. He also praised the vomiting jokes, and said he could not remember the last time he laughed so hard during a South Park episode. Entertainment Weekly television columnist Ken Tucker said it was better than the season premiere, which he also praised. Tucker particularly enjoyed the satire of pop culture criticism, and wrote, \\"I'd compare the Scrotie episode to the work of Rabelais, Henry Miller, and Dennis Cooper, but then I'd be part of the boys' satire, wouldn't I?\\" TV Fanatic said the episode was not as strong as previous seasons, but an improvement over \\"Sexual Healing\\". The site praised the emphasis on Butters and the pop culture references to The Catcher in the Rye, John Lennon, Sarah Jessica Parker and \\"the useless Kardashian Klan\\". The A.V. Club writer Sean O'Neal said he \\"chuckled a few times\\", but found the vomit jokes acted like a substitute for \\"actual dialogue\\". However, O'Neal praised the satire of people looking too deeply into the meaning of meaningless art, and how easily that theme can be applied to South Park itself. Not all reviews were entirely positive. Ramsey Isler of IGN said Butters was \\"awesome, as usual\\", and thought the jokes about the Kardashians were funny, but that the positive elements of the episode were \\"not enough to balance out the failures\\". He particularly criticized the Sarah Jessica Parker jokes as \\"flat and random\\", and the constant vomiting as \\"just one long- running 'joke' that was just plain awful\\". The day after \\"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs\\" aired, members of the Kardashian family responded positively to their portrayal and on-screen deaths. On her blog, Kim Kardashian wrote that the family found the episode very funny and were honored to be featured in the episode. She wrote, \\"We were all dying when we saw this clip from South Park that aired last night... literally, LOL. They killed us all!!!\\" She also wrote, \\"I managed to survive the longest... of course!\\" Kourtney Kardashian joked on her Twitter page, \\"How rude! Southpark!!\\", Khlo√© Kardashian wrote she did not know about her appearance on the show until she suddenly received numerous messages on her Twitter page. Khlo√© also said she found the scene funny, and laughed at how unattractively she and her sisters were portrayed, although she said the Bruce Jenner cartoon looked very realistic.

History Assyrian Scouting and Guiding was founded around 1912 in the Assyrian areas of the Ottoman Empire, then later developed abroad among the refugees who had survived the genocide of 1914-1920 and among those that had fled. The history of Scouting in Iraq started with the British Mandate of Mesopotamia in the early 1920s, when Scouting got started in several areas and was well entrenched. RAF Habbaniya opened in 1937, on the Euphrates 40 miles west of Baghdad as the permanent Royal Air Force headquarters for Iraq. As well as the military part of the station, there was a civil cantonment for civilians working on the station and their families. The population was very mixed, with a comparatively high proportion of Assyrians. In 1940 the schoolmaster wished to start a Scout organization and was assisted by the Royal Air Force servicemen stationed there. The Iraqi Scout Organization was run on British lines, consisting of seven troops each with a British and an Assyrian instructor, a Senior Scout troop, and an Assyrian Rover crew.

These polytopes were studied by Constantin Carath√©odory, David Gale, Theodore Motzkin, Victor Klee, and others. They play an important role in polyhedral combinatorics: according to the upper bound theorem, proved by Peter McMullen and Richard Stanley, the boundary Œî(n,d) of the cyclic polytope C(n,d) maximizes the number fi of i-dimensional faces among all simplicial spheres of dimension d ‚àí 1 with n vertices.  Definition  The moment curve in \\\\mathbb{R}^d is defined by :\\\\mathbf{x}:\\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^d, \\\\mathbf{x}(t) := \\\\begin{bmatrix}t,t^2,\\\\ldots,t^d\\\\end{bmatrix}^T. The d-dimensional cyclic polytope with n vertices is the convex hull : C(n,d) := \\\\mathbf{conv}{\\\\mathbf{x}(t_1),\\\\mathbf{x}(t_2),\\\\ldots,\\\\mathbf{x}(t_n) } of n > d \\\\ge 2 distinct points \\\\mathbf{x}(t_i) with t_1 < t_2 < \\\\ldots < t_n on the moment curve. The combinatorial structure of this polytope is independent of the points chosen, and the resulting polytope has dimension d and n vertices. Its boundary is a (d ‚àí 1)-dimensional simplicial polytope denoted Œî(n,d).  Gale evenness condition  The Gale evenness condition provides a necessary and sufficient condition to determine a facet on a cyclic polytope. Let T := {t_1,t_2,\\\\ldots,t_n}. Then, a d-subset T_d \\\\subseteq T forms a facet of C(n,d) iff any two elements in T \\\\setminus T_d are separated by an even number of elements from T_d in the sequence (t_1,t_2,\\\\ldots,t_n). Neighborliness Cyclic polytopes are examples of neighborly polytopes, in that every set of at most d/2 vertices forms a face. They were the first neighborly polytopes known, and Theodore Motzkin conjectured that all neighborly polytopes are combinatorially equivalent to cyclic polytopes, but this is now known to be false... Number of faces The number of i-dimensional faces of the cyclic polytope Œî(n,d) is given by the formula : f_i(\\\\Delta(n,d)) = \\\\binom{n}{i+1} \\\\quad \\\\textrm{for} \\\\quad 0 \\\\leq i < \\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{d}{2}\\\\right\\\\rfloor and (f_0,\\\\ldots,f_{\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{d}{2}\\\\right\\\\rfloor-1}) completely determine (f_{\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{d}{2}\\\\right\\\\rfloor},\\\\ldots,f_{d-1}) via the Dehn‚ÄìSommerville equations. Upper bound theorem The upper bound theorem states that cyclic polytopes have the maximum possible number of faces for a given dimension and number of vertices: if Œî is a simplicial sphere of dimension d ‚àí 1 with n vertices, then : f_i(\\\\Delta) \\\\leq f_i(\\\\Delta(n,d)) \\\\quad \\\\textrm{for}\\\\quad i=0,1,\\\\ldots,d-1. The upper bound conjecture for simplicial polytopes was proposed by Theodore Motzkin in 1957 and proved by Peter McMullen in 1970. Victor Klee suggested that the same statement should hold for all simplicial spheres and this was indeed established in 1975 by Richard P.

It spanned 26 episodes (each 26 minutes in length) and was based on the comics The Adventures of Carland Cross, by Belgian natives Olivier Grenson and Michel Oleffe. Carland Cross tells the story of a fictional British private investigator specializing in curious and inexplicable cases. The series aired late 1996 under the French-language title Carland Coss and in other markets, such as Spanish, as Las aventuras de Carland Cross. Of the 26 episodes, only 3 stories of the original print comic were used: 'The Golem', 'The Monster Under Sea' (The Tunnel), and 'The Mysteries of The Loch Ness'. Although the television series remains unknown in international television, the animated television series was a success in the late 1990s to early 2000s in European countries such as Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland. However, it was also popular in South America, and especially in Argentina.  Background = Plot  Carland Cross, a typical British private detective from the 1930s era, is called upon to investigate cases of the strange and mysterious. Cross attempts to solve cases involving ancient ruins, forbidden regions, strange inexplicable murders, criminal Satanic curses, deserted cities and an array of unimaginable monsters. The central storyline is set in the United Kingdom, mainly London, which is depicted as a mysterious drowned city of fog where crime is prevalent, and with it, apprehension and danger.  Characters = Protagonist  Carland Cross: A calculated and methodical British private investigator from Baker Street in London, working alongside the police officials. He shares his investigations with his pupil, Andy White, the aristocrat fervent admirer Medwenna Simpson, and is often helped by the Superintendent Marmaduke Wingfield. =Heroes= Note:Written as if characters are real * Andy White: Born in Whitechapel in 1916, Andrew White is Cross's hotheaded pupil. Although the teenager is angry and feisty, he is considered a promising young amateur detective with a heart of gold. His essential function in the series is to seek explanations, by undertaking the writing of the memoirs of his master Carland Cross, who is a depicted as a loner to the viewers. His clumsiness also serves as a source of unexpected action for audiences. * Mrs. Stone: Approximately sixty years of age, Mildred Stone is a sympathetic governess and an admired cook. She ensures that Cross and White are fed, and oversees the detective. Mrs. Stone disagrees with the occupation of her two proteges. * Medwenna Simpson: Partially inspired by Medwenna McGuire, Simpson is a good-looking aristocrat with green eyes and red mane, whose occupation is as a novelist. Since her unexpected encounter with Carland Cross in The Derby, Miss Simpson got the idea to write the biography of the great detective. To do this, she investigates constantly, which leads to her and Cross becoming close collaborators. * Marmaduke Wingfield: One of the London Superintendents of Police. He is gruff, grumpy, and nervous, In the series, Marmaduke Wingfield embodies the authority and force only the rank of Superintendent can mobilize when the circumstances and necessities of the investigation so require. His relations with Carland Cross are complex. Often complicit, they may also be viewed as competitors. =Villains= * Murdock: The main antagonist in most series and Carland Cross' sinister arch-enemy. Murdock is a Prussian international adventurer, mercenary, smuggler and spy, wounded in the left hand by Carland Cross in 1914 whilst fighting for the Kaizer. He has long silver hair, wears a monocle, a cigarette holder and a weapon. He is a ruthless, stateless, and venal sociopath who is opposed to any form of law and discipline, instead thirsting for power, conspiracy and revenge. Murdock has a score to settle with England because of Carland Cross. * Snoops: Murdock's brutish henchman, Bardolph Snoops is a big, thick skulled man, with long black hair. He is somewhat intelligent, a bit na√Øve and cowardly, and has limited conversation.  Conception and history  Carland Cross's crime comics, created in 1990, were inspired by works of well-known authors of the time, such as Agatha Christie, Arthur Conan Doyle, William Hope Hodgson and Jean Ray. In 1994, Olivier Grenson had the idea to make a computer animation of Carland Cross. With a friend, owner of the studio ASAP, he began to select a series of images in albums and edit them into a short sequence in which he added some effects and a soundtrack to a text by Michel Oleffe. After contacting the Belgian animation professional studio ODEC-Kid Cartoons, they started the filming. They quickly decided to produce an animation pilot. Michel Oleffe provided a scenario from the Mystery of Loch Ness. The pilot was presented at a congress of animation, the Azores, in 1995. Given the interest generated by the pilot, a financial arrangement was concluded quickly and Odec-Kid Cartoons with French and Canadian partners got into production. Olivier Grenson and Michel Oleffe, the creator and the publisher, later released their comics in a rare 3D animated series for kids and adults that contained influences from the crime, suspense, and supernatural genre, as well as some cryptic themes. The series, which had 26 episodes of 26 minutes, was completed in 1997.

Sanderson has served as the minister for Child Protection in the Marshall Ministry since 22 March 2018. Background and early career Sanderson's family moved from Melbourne to Adelaide in 1983, settling in Prospect, an inner northern suburb of Adelaide. Sanderson attended St Peter's Collegiate Girls' School. Sanderson graduated from the University of South Australia with a Bachelor of Arts in Accountancy. She worked for a chartered accountant, a finishing school and then a modelling agency as a financial manager. In 1994 Sanderson established a modelling agency and training school, Rachel's Model Management. Sanderson sold her management agency in April 2013, citing her full-time occupation as being a member of parliament. Political career Sanderson was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Adelaide at the 2010 state election, receiving a 14.5-point two-party swing on a margin of 4.2 points against the Labor incumbent, Jane Lomax-Smith.Adelaide - 2010 SA election results: ABC At the 2014 state election she suffered a 1.8-point two-party swing against her finishing with a reduced margin of 2.4 points against the Labor candidate, David O'Loughlin.Adelaide - 2014 SA election results: ABC 2016 redistribution campaign Upon the release of the 2016 draft electoral redistribution, Sanderson organised the mass distribution of a pro forma document in the two inner metropolitan suburbs of Walkerville and Gilberton, which aimed for residents to use the pro forma document to submit their objection to the commission in support of Sanderson's campaign to keep the two suburbs in her seat of Adelaide, which in the draft would have been transferred to neighbouring Torrens. Sanderson's position however was at odds with her own party's submission which in fact agreed with the commission that Walkerville should be transferred to Torrens. Under the commission's draft proposal, the Liberal margin in Adelaide would have been reduced from 2.4 percent to 0.6 percent, but would have also resulted in the Labor margin in Torrens reduced from 3.5 percent to 1.1 percent. Of a record 130 total submissions received in response to the draft redistribution, about 100 (over three quarters of all submissions) were from Walkerville and Gilberton. As a result, the commission reversed the draft decision in the final publication. The 2016 electoral redistribution added the rest of Collinswood to the seat, and moved the seat's northern boundary from Regency Road to several blocks south of Regency Road, losing a significant amount of northern Prospect. This increased the Liberal margin from 2.4 percent to an estimated 3.0 percent. 2018 election Despite suffering a further ‚àí2.0 percent two-party swing, Sanderson narrowly held onto Adelaide at the 2018 election on a marginal 51.0 percent two-party vote. With the Liberals winning government after 16 years in opposition, Sanderson now sat in the Liberals' second most marginal seat.Adelaide, 2018 SA election: Antony Green ABC Sanderson was appointed as Minister for Child Protection on 22 March 2018.

See Mithraic mysteries for the main article. The Roman cult of Mithras had connections with other pagan deities, syncretism being a prominent feature of Roman paganism. Almost all Mithraea contain statues dedicated to gods of other cults, and it is common to find inscriptions dedicated to Mithras in other sanctuaries, especially those of Jupiter Dolichenus.Clauss, M., The Roman cult of Mithras, p.158. Mithraism was not an alternative to other pagan religions, but rather a particular way of practising pagan worship; and many Mithraic initiates can also be found worshipping in the civic religion, and as initiates of other mystery cults. However, in popular culture and especially among the New Atheist movement, the most widely discussed element of Mithras in the context of comparative religion is his relationship with Christianity. Connections with the figure of Jesus himself have even been posited but are generally ignored by scholars . More widely discussed are a few apparent similarities between early Christian liturgical practice and the Mithraic rites, similarities which were noted in antiquity by Christian writers and have been subject to varying interpretations over time . Comparisons with contemporary Roman gods=Phanes Orphic speculation influenced the cult of Mithras at times.Clauss, M., The Roman cult of Mithras, p. 70 In Orphism, Phanes emerged from the world egg at the beginning of time, bringing the universe into existence. There is some literary evidence of the syncretism of Mithras and Phanes. A list of the eight elements of creation appears in Zenobius and Theon of Smyrna; most of the elements are the same, but in Zenobius the seventh element is 'Mithras', in Theon it is 'Phanes'.Zenobius Proverbia 5.78 (in Corpus paroemiographorum Graecorum vol. 1, p.151) (Clauss, p.70 n.84). Theon of Smyrna gives the same list but substitutes Phanes. See Albert de Jong, Traditions of the Magi: Zoroastrianism in Greek and Latin literature, p.309 on this; quoted on Pearse, Roger Zenobius on Mithras and Who is Theon of Smyrna?. A Greek inscription on a statue base from a Mithraeum in Rome reads \\"to Deus Sol Mithras Phanes\\". A relief from Vercovium (Housesteads) on Hadrian's Wall shows Mithras emerging from the cosmic egg, which is represented both as such and by the shape of the zodiacal ring.Clauss, M. The Roman cult of Mithras, p. 70, photo p.71. The relief (Vermaseren 860) is now at the University of Newcastle. Ulansey adds: :\\"The identification between Mithras and Phanes indicated by CIMRM 860 is also explicitly attested by an inscription found in Rome dedicated to 'Zeus-Helios- Mithras-Phanes' and another inscription dedicated to 'Helios-Mithras- Phanes'.\\"Ulansey, David, The Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries, pp.120-1. Excerpts here . Another syncretistic relief is in Modena. This shows Phanes coming from an egg with flames shooting out around him, surrounded by the twelve signs of the zodiac, in an image very similar to that at Newcastle.Vermaseren, M., The miraculous birth of Mithras, p.287 n.10. The relief is in the Estense Museum in Modena, Italy. See also F. Cumont, \\"Mithra et l'Orphisme\\", RHR CIX, 1934, 63 ff; M. P. Nilsson, \\"The Syncretistic Relief at Modena\\", Symb. Osi. XXIV, 1945, 1 ff. Further references also exist.Vermaseren 695: marble relief from Mutina or Rome; V 475: Greek inscription from Rome, dedication by a Father and priest to Zeus-Helios- Mithras-Phanes Helios/Sol/Sol invictus Mithras stock epithet is Sol Invictus, \\"invincible sun\\". However, Mithras is distinct from both Sol and Sol Invictus, and they are separate entitites on Mithraic statuary and artwork such as the tauroctony scenes, in Mithras hunting scenes, and in the Mithraic banquet scenes in which Mithras dines with Sol. Other scenes feature Mithras ascending behind Sol in the latter's chariot, the deities shaking hands and the two gods at an altar with pieces of meat on a spit or spits. One peculiar scene shows Sol kneeling before Mithras, who holds an object in his hand, interpreted as either a Phrygian cap or the haunch of the bull. Different gods being each other is a feature of Hellenistic syncretism however and the distinct imagery sometimes is intended to convey such ideas. Mithras shaking hands with Helios affirms their identity as the same underlying deity. Unlike Helios / Sol, who was part of the traditional state-sponsored Roman religious system, and also unlike the Sol Invictus cult, which became an official state- sponsored cult under Aurelian in 274 CE, the Mithraic cult (as all other mystery cults) did not receive state sanction. Under Commodus' rule (r. 180‚Äì192 CE), the title invictus became a standard part of divine and imperial epithets, but this adapted from Hercules Invictus, not from either Sol or Mithras. Jupiter Dolichenus The Mithraea at Carnuntum appear to have been constructed in close association with contemporary temple of Jupiter Dolichenus,Clauss, M., The Roman cult of Mithras, p.44. and there seem to have been considerable similarities between the two cults; both being mystery cults with secret liturgies, both being popular in the military, and having similar names for their officials and initiates. Two large Mithrea have been discovered in Doliche itself (modern Gaziantep in Turkey), which have been proposed as being unusually early. Mithraism and Christianity Cautes riding a bull (Sibiu/Hermannstadt, Romania). The idea of a relationship between early Christianity and Mithraism is based in part on a remark in the 2nd-century Christian writer Justin Martyr, who accused the Mithraists of diabolically imitating the Christian communion rite.Justin Martyr, First Apology, ch. 66: \\"For the apostles, in the memoirs composed by them, which are called Gospels, have thus delivered unto us what was enjoined upon them; that Jesus took bread, and when He had given thanks, said, \\"This do ye in remembrance of Me, this is My body; \\"and that, after the same manner, having taken the cup and given thanks, He said, \\"This is My blood; \\"and gave it to them alone. Which the wicked devils have imitated in the mysteries of Mithras, commanding the same thing to be done. For, that bread and a cup of water are placed with certain incantations in the mystic rites of one who is being initiated, you either know or can learn.\\" Based upon this statement, Ernest Renan in 1882 set forth a vivid depiction of two rival religions: \\"if the growth of Christianity had been arrested by some mortal malady, the world would have been Mithraic.\\"Renan, E., Marc-Aurele et la fin du monde antique. Paris, 1882, p. 579 Scholar Edwin M. Yamauchi criticized Renan's inference, which he claimed, \\"published nearly 150 years ago, has no value as a source. He [Renan] knew very little about Mithraism.\\"Edwin M. Yamauchi cited in Lee Strobel, The Case for the Real Jesus, Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2007, p.175 Anti-Christian author and originator of the Christ myth theory Charles- Fran√ßois Dupuis was the first to set out to prove the Mithraic origins of Christianity. Christian apologists, among them Ronald NashRonald Nash, \\"Mystery Religions of the Near East,\\" Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics, 1999. and Edwin Yamauchi,Edwin M. Yamauchi, \\"Easter: Myth, Hallucination, or History?\\" March 29, 1974. have suggested a different interpretation of Mithraism's relationship to Christianity. Yamauchi, pointing out that most of the textual evidence for Mithraist doctrine was written after the New Testament was in broad circulation, posits that it is more likely that Mithraism borrowed from Christianity than the other way around. However, Persian scholar and art historian, Abolala Soudavar cites Plutarch, MITHRAIC SOCIETIES From Brotherhood Ideal to Religion‚Äòs Adversary writing, \\"that in the year 67 BC, pirates who had more than a thousand sails and had captured more than four hundred cities, \\"offered strange rites of their own at Mount Olympus, and celebrated there, certain secret rites, among which those of Mithras continue to the present time, having been first instituted by them‚Ä¶\\"\\" Soudavar submits that Plutarch pins Mithraic worship in Rome long before the birth of Christ, and it is therefore improbable that Christian traditions informed Mithraic, but rather the opposite. The philosopher Celsus in the second century provides some evidence that Ophite gnostic ideas were influencing the mysteries of Mithras.Clauss, M. The Roman Cult of Mithras, p.17, referencing Origen, Contra Celsum book 6, cc.22-24 where a ladder of seven steps is described, similar to one used by the Ophites. Clauss states that the borrowing was by the Mithraists, but nothing in Contra Celsum seems to say so. Miraculous birth Maithras was born from a rock. David Ulansey speculates that this was a belief derived from the Perseus myths, which held he was born from a cavern.Ulansey, David (1991). The Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries: Cosmology and Salvation in the Ancient World. Oxford University Press. pp. 35‚Äì36. . 25th of December Bas-relief of Mithras looking to Sol Invictus as he slays the bull. Inscription top line: Soli Invicto Deo. It is often stated (e.g. by Encyclopaedia Britannica, the Catholic Encyclopedia, et al.) that Mithras was born on December 25. But one person, Roger Beck, argued in a 1987 article that this is unproven, calling this assertion \\"that hoariest of 'facts'\\". He continues: \\"In truth, the only evidence for it is the celebration of the birthday of Invictus on that date in Calendar of Philocalus. Invictus is of course Sol Invictus, Aurelian's sun god. It does not follow that a different, earlier, and unofficial sun god, Sol Invictus Mithras, was necessarily or even probably, born on that day too.\\", p. 299, n. 12. (Note that Sol Invictus played a prominent role in the Mithraic mysteries, and was equated with Mithras.Ulansey, David. (1989). The Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries, p. 107\\\\. Oxford University Press.Salzman, Michele Renee. (2004). Pagan and Christian Notions of the Week in the 4th Century CE Western Roman Empire In Time and Temporality in the Ancient World, p. 192\\\\. University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.Alvar, Jaime, tr. Gordon, Richard (2008). Romanising Oriental Gods: Myth, Salvation, and Ethics in the Cults of Cybele, Isis, and Mithras, p. 100\\\\. Brill.) Unusually amongst Roman mystery cults, the mysteries of Mithras had no 'public' face; worship of Mithras was confined to initiates, and they could only undertake such worship in the secrecy of the Mithraeum. Clauss states: \\"the Mithraic Mysteries had no public ceremonies of its own. The festival of natalis Invicti [Birth of the Unconquerable (Sun)], held on 25 December, was a general festival of the Sun, and by no means specific to the Mysteries of Mithras.\\".Clauss, Manfred. Mithras: Kult und Mysterien. M√ºnchen: Beck, 1990, p. 70.\\"... erw√§hnenswert w√§re dass das Mithras-Kult keine √∂ffentlichen Zeremonien kannte. Das Fest der natalis Invicti, der 25. Dezember, war ein allgemeines Sonnenfest und somit keineswegs auf die Mithras-Mysterien beschr√§nkt. Es gab also im Mithras-Kult nichts vergleichbares zu den gro√üen Feiern und Festlichkeiten anderer Kulte ...\\" Steven Hijmans has discussed in detail whether the general natalis Invicti festival was related to Christmas but does not give Mithras as a possible source. However, in the original homeland of Mithra, one of the world's oldest continuously practiced religions still celebrates his birthday. The present-day Iran Chamber Society's Ramona Shashaani shares traditional 'Persian' (i.e. 'Parsee' = Zoroastrian) culture and history: :While Christians around the world are preparing to celebrate Christmas on Dec. 25th, the Persians are getting ready to tribute one of their most festive celebrations on Dec. 21st, the eve of winter solstice, the longest night and shortest day of the year. In Iran this night is called SHAB-E YALDAA, also known as SHAB-E CHELLEH, which refers to the birthday or rebirth of the sun. :... YALDAA is chiefly related to MEHR YAZAT; it is the night of the birth of the unconquerable sun, Mehr or Mithra, meaning love and sun, and has been celebrated by the followers of Mithraism as early as 5000 B.C. :... But in the [Roman-controlled area's] 4th century A.D., because of some errors in counting the leap year, the birthday of Mithra shifted to 25th of December and was established as such. Salvation A painted text on the wall of the St. Prisca Mithraeum (c A.D. 200)http://www.hums.canterbury.ac.nz/clas/ejms/out_of_print/JMSv2n1/JMSv2n1Roll.pdf in Rome contains the words: et nos servasti (?) . . . sanguine fuso (and you have saved us ... in the shed blood). The meaning of this text is unclear, although presumably it refers to the bull killed by Mithras, as no other source refers to a Mithraic salvation. However, the servasti is only a conjecture.Panciera, Il materiale epigrafico dallo scavo del mitreo di S. Stefano Rotondo, in: Mysteria Mithrae (conference 1978 published 1979). According to Robert Turcan,Turcan, Robert, \\"Salut Mithriaque et soteriologie neoplatonicienne,\\" La soteriologiea dei culti orientali nell'impero romano,eds. U. Bianchi and M. J. Vermaseren, Leiden 1982. pp. 103-105 Mithraic salvation had little to do with the other-worldly destiny of individual souls, but was on the Zoroastrian pattern of man's participation in the cosmic struggle of the good creation against the forces of evil.Beck, Roger, Merkelbach's Mithras, p.301-2 According to Akhondi and Akbari, red was a color of prominence. The sacrifice of the bull's holy blood was a sign of fertility and life, much as in Christianity red wine can symbolize the sacrifice of Christ. In addition, white was an important color for the cult. The bull always remained white because it was a symbol of purity and holiness. Moon and stars painted in gold and white were also important symbols to the cult and later incorporated into Christian architecture and other decorations. Mithraists believed that one day Mithra's works would be complete on earth and that he would return to heaven. Symbolism of water Monuments in the Danube area depict Mithras shooting a bow at a rock in the presence of the torch-bearers, apparently to encourage water to come forth. Clauss states that, after the ritual meal, this \\"water-miracle offers the clearest parallel with Christianity\\".Clauss, M. The Roman Cult of Mithras, p.71-2. Sign of the cross Tertullian states that followers of Mithras were marked on their forehead in an unspecified manner.Tertullian, De praescriptione haereticorum 40: \\"if my memory still serves me, Mithra there, (in the kingdom of Satan, ) sets his marks on the foreheads of his soldiers; celebrates also the oblation of bread, and introduces an image of a resurrection, and before a sword wreathes a crown.\\" There is no indication that this mark was made in the form of a cross, or a branding, or a tattoo, or a permanent mark of any kind.Per Beskow, \\"Branding in the Mysteries of Mithras?\\", in Mysteria Mithrae, ed. Ugo Bianchi (Leyden 1979), 487-501. He describes the entire idea as a \\"scholarly myth\\". See also FAQ by Dr. Richard Gordon. The symbol of a circle with a diagonal cross inscribed within it is commonly found in Mithraea, especially in association with the Leontocephaline figure. Mithraic motifs and medieval Christian art From the end of the 18th century some scholars have suggested that certain elements in medieval Christian art reflect images found in Mithraic reliefs. pp. 507‚Äì17. p.507 Franz Cumont was among these scholars, although he studied each motif in isolation rather than in context. pp. 507‚Äì17. p.508 Cumont suggested that after the triumph of the Christian church over paganism, artists continued to make use of stock images originally devised for Mithras in order to depict the new and unfamiliar stories of the bible. The \\"stranglehold of the workshop\\" meant that the first Christian artworks were heavily based on pagan art, and \\"a few alterations in costume and attitude transformed a pagan scene into a Christian picture\\". pp. 227‚Äì8. A series of scholars have since discussed possible similarities with Mithraic reliefs in medieval Romanesque art. pp. 507‚Äì17. p.509 Vermaseren stated that the only certain example of such influence was an image of Elijah drawn up to heaven in a chariot drawn by fiery horses. pp. 104‚Äì6. Deman stated that to compare isolated elements was not useful, and that combinations should be studied. He also pointed out that a similarity of image does not tell us whether this implies an ideological influence, or merely a tradition of craftmanship. He then gave a list of medieval reliefs that parallel Mithraic images, but refused to draw conclusions from such parallels, since these would be subjective. pp. 507‚Äì17. p.510 Mithraea re-used in Christian worship Several of the best preserved Mithraea, especially those in Rome such as at San Clemente and Santa Prisca, are now to be found underneath Christian churches. It has been suggested that these instances might indicate a tendency for Christians to adopt Mithraea for Christian worship, in a similar manner to the undoubted conversion into churches of temples and shrines of civic paganism, such as the Pantheon. However, in these Roman instances, the Mithraeum appears to have been filled with rubble prior to the erection of a church over the top; and hence they cannot be considered demonstrable examples of deliberate re-use. A study of early Christian churches in Britain concluded that, if anything, the evidence there suggested a tendency to avoid locating churches on the sites of former Mithraea. On the other hand, there is at least one known example of a Mithraic carved relief being re-used on a Christian church, in the early 11th-century tower added to the church of St Peter at Gowts in Lincoln, England. A much-weathered Mithraic lion-headed figure carrying keys (presumably from a ruined Mithraeum in Roman Lincoln) was incorporated into the church tower, apparently in the mistaken belief that it was an ancient representation of the Apostle Peter. Elsewhere, as in one of the Mithraea in Doliche, there are instances where the tauroctony of a cave Mithraeum has been replaced by a cross, which suggests later use as a church; but again the date of re-use cannot be determined, and hence it is by no means certain how far the Christian occupiers were aware of their cave's Mithraic past.

Sylvan Simon. It is the first of three films starring Red Skelton as Wally \\"the Fox\\" Benton, who writes and acts in radio murder mysteries. Wally is kidnapped by a greedy cult leader (played by Conrad Veidt), who threatens to kill Wally's girlfriend (portrayed in all three films by Ann Rutherford) and another young woman unless he concocts a perfect murder. The film was based on the Broadway play of the same name by Laurence Gross and Edward Childs Carpenter. Uncredited contributing writer Elliott Nugent wrote and directed the earlier film adaptation of the same name. The two sequels are Whistling in Dixie (1942) and Whistling in Brooklyn (1943). Plot Wally Benton (Red Skelton) is the star of a mystery series on radio, The Fox, which he writes himself, inventing for each episode a crime that has \\"only one loophole\\" so the criminal can be caught. He is about to elope with Carol Lambert (Ann Rutherford), but his agent (Eve Arden) tells him he must go out with the sponsor's daughter, Fran Post (Virginia Grey), or risk his show being canceled. Outside the city, at a mansion called Silver Haven, Joseph Jones (Conrad Veidt) runs a cult that promises serenity and contact with the dead, but is really just a scam to collect donations. He learns that a member has died and bequeathed a life interest in $1,000,000 to her nephew Harvey Upshaw (Lloyd Corrigan), with the principal going to Silver Haven on Upshaw's death. Jones, angry that she did not leave the money directly to his cult, determines to have Upshaw killed at once, but he must avoid suspicion. Some of Jones's henchmen are fans of The Fox and admire Benton's plots, so he gets the idea to kidnap Benton and make him invent a real crime with no loopholes. Learning that two different women are expecting to meet Benton that night and one is his fianc√©e, he has Lambert and Post kidnapped as well. Benton tries to protect the women, but is out of his depth. After a bumbling escape attempt through a secret passage fails, he decides he needs to come up with a plot as Jones demands. He has the idea to substitute poison for the tooth powder that Upshaw will undoubtedly take along as he flies overnight to meet his aunt's lawyer. The women are aghast at Benton's cooperation, but when the poison is brought to Benton, he puts it in a packet but then substitutes another harmless one. However, this gets lost and another packet is made up with real poison: Upshaw is in real danger. And so are Benton, Lambert, and Post, as Jones will have no reason to let them live once the plot succeeds. Benton finds a hidden telephone, but before he can reach the police, he is seen and the phone is ripped from the wires. Jones leaves and Benton is locked in with the women in the same room. He touches the telephone wires together to simulate dialing 0, but cannot talk to the operator without a telephone. But, noticing a radio in the room, he uses his knowledge of radio to improvise a way to use it as a phone: the loudspeaker will double as a microphone if they swap the right wires back and forth each time he starts or finishes talking. He reaches the telephone operator and tries to get a message sent to Upshaw's flight, but Jones's man on the flight finds a way to disable the aircraft radio, and contact is lost. Benton then has the operator contact his radio station, where it is almost time for The Fox. They patch his phone call through to the transmitter and he begins telling all his listeners what has been happening. But they have to speak loudly, and the one dim-witted guard who was left outside the door bursts in. They save themselves by convincing him they are just passing the time by pretending to do a radio show.

They wrote all the songs that the band performed in numerous gigs across Manchester and Liverpool until Frampton had to leave in 1984 to complete his medical training (he was to become a well known GP in Ormskirk) Auditions to replace his distinctive voice produced the line-up of Martin Wright (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Ian Bendelow (guitar), Martin Mittler (bass guitar), and Spencer Birtwistle (drums, later a member of The Fall).Strong, Martin C.

They signed to MCA Records and hit the lower reaches of the UK Singles Chart with their first release, \\"Dream Some Paradise\\". Two follow-up singles fared similarly, and in late 1991 the band's debut album, Intastella and the Family of People was issued. The band's momentum was lost after Grundy broke her arm in a motorcycle accident, and they were dropped by MCA, returning in 1993 on the Planet-3 label with the Drifter EP, on which they worked with Shaun Ryder. The band's biggest hit came in 1995, with \\"The Night\\" reaching #60 in the UK, preceding their second album, What You Gonna Do featuring Manchester Harpist Katie Brett on the track \\"I'll Be Forever\\". Further singles followed during 1996 and 1997 but none repeated their earlier success. One of these, \\"Grandmaster\\", was used on the soundtrack of the 1997 film Love in Paris. A final album, Nuphonia, was released in 1997. Grundy later emerged with a new band, Stella & the Doggs. On 30 November 2019, the death of Anthony Green, Little Anthony was announced.

Hamodia News, October 11, 2007, p. A18. also spelled Paltzinsky, Platchinsky and Platinsky, was a rosh yeshiva in Jerusalem for nearly 60 years. Biography He was born on 28 Cheshvan 5673 (November 18, 1912) in the town of Vishki, Vitebsk Governorate, at the time in the Russian Empire, today in Latvia. His father, Rabbi Shlomo Yehuda Leib Palchinsky, was the av beis din (head of the rabbinical court) of Vishki. Palchinsky's maternal grandfather was Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel (the Alter of Slabodka). At age 10 Palchinsky traveled to Riga, where he learned under Rabbi Menachem Mendel Zaks, the Rav of that city, for a year. At age 11 he returned home to study with his father until his bar mitzvah. During his teens, he learned for three years at Yeshivas Knesses Yisrael in Slabodka, Lithuania. During this period, Rabbi Meir Simcha (the Ohr Somayach), Rav of Dvinsk, died and Palchinsky's father succeeded him in the city's rabbinate. Palchinsky would spend every Pesach intercession break in Dvinsk, where he maintained a regular study session with the Rogatchover Gaon. His close relationship with the Rogatchover Gaon continued for 10 years, until the latter's death. Palchinsky went on to study for a year and half in Riga under Rabbi Mordechai Pogramsky, and four years at the Mir yeshiva in Poland, where he became known as an outstanding student. In 1937, he was selected by the rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Eliezer Yehuda Finkel, to join an elite group of Mir students sent to learn under the Brisker Rav in Brisk. This group included Rabbi Aryeh Leib Malin and the Brisker Rav's future son-in-law, Rabbi Yechiel Michel Feinstein. Palchinsky became a prot√©g√© of the Brisker Rav, a relationship which continued when the two arrived in Jerusalem. Afterwards Palchinsky returned to the Slabodka yeshiva. Palchinsky survived the Holocaust through the efforts of Rabbi Mordecai Dubin, an Agudath Israel activist. He immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1940. In the early 1940s he studied together with other noteworthy scholars such as Rabbi Shneur Kotler, Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth, and Rabbi Elazar Goldschmidt. In 1944 he married Ettel, the daughter of Rabbi Aryeh Levin, a prominent figure in the Old Yishuv in Jerusalem. This match made him a brother-in-law to Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv. He and his wife had six daughters and one son. In the mid-1940s, Palchinsky undertook a correspondence of over 80 letters with the Chazon Ish of Bnei Brak. In 1946, his uncle, Rabbi Issac Sher, called on him to re-establish the Slabodka Yeshiva in Bnei Brak. In 1948, he joined the staff of Yeshivas Beis Aryeh, founded by his father-in-law, Rabbi Aryeh Levin, in Jerusalem. Levin asked that Palchinsky be appointed rosh yeshiva. In addition to teaching in the yeshiva, Palchinsky delivered mussar (ethics) talks to students from Hebron Yeshiva and Mir Yeshiva. These students included Rabbi Aviezer Piltz, Rabbi Baruch Mordechai Ezrachi, Rabbi Mattisyahu Solomon, Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, Rabbi Chaim Sarna, and Rabbi Moshe Shapiro. During the 1948 War of Independence, Palchinsky delivered shiurim at Yeshivas Heichal HaTalmud in Tel Aviv. In the 1960s and 1970s, Palchinsky also served as rosh yeshiva of the Tomchei Temimim system in Kfar Chabad and Lod. In 1972 he was asked to deliver a shiur klali (general lecture) in Yeshivas HaNegev and its kollel. Palchinsky established Kollel Shalom Yehuda in Kiryat Sanz, Jerusalem, in memory of his father. He died on October 6, 2007, at the age of 94. He was buried on the Mount of Olives. Works Palchinsky published two Talmudic works, one on Seder Nashim and one on Seder Moed, each entitled Shalom Yehuda () in memory of his father. He also left unpublished writings. * * ReferencesExternal links *Pictures of Rabbi Eliezer Palchinsky in \\"The Brisker Rav\\" *Yeshiva Beis Aryeh * Photo of Rabbi Eliezer Palachinsky delivering a lecture on Tractate Kiddushin Category:Rosh yeshivas Category:Latvian Orthodox rabbis Category:Haredi rabbis in Israel Category:People from Daugavpils Municipality Category:People from Jerusalem Category:20th-century rabbis Category:21st- century rabbis Category:1912 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Burials at the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives ","title":"Eliezer Palchinsky"},{"id":"26652702","text":"The Scottish Democratic Alliance (SDA) is a political organisation formed in 2009 as the successor to the Scottish Enterprise Party (SEP).

The SDA also propose a scheduled ferry service between Aberdeen and Norway to promote tourism. History The Scottish Enterprise Party was a centre-right political party in Scotland which supported Scottish independence and withdrawal from the European Union. It was formed in July 2004 to provide an alternative to the largely social democratic Scottish National Party for centre-right voters who support independence. The party opposed Scottish membership of the European Union and any prospective membership of the euro; it supported the principle of a constitutional monarchy and elections conducted through the Single Transferable Vote. The SEP backed the constitutional view that parliamentary sovereignty does not apply in Scotland, because sovereignty in Scotland resides with the people, as set out in the Declaration of Arbroath. The party fielded three candidates in the 2007 Scottish Parliamentary elections, obtaining a total of 1,025 votes and winning no seats. The party was eventually superseded by the Scottish Democratic Alliance in 2009. The SDA was registered with the Electoral Commission in June 2009, and the SEP was simultaneously wound up. Activists from the SDA carried a banner at the March and Rally for Scottish Independence in September 2013 which read: \\"a vote for independence is not a vote for the SNP\\". The SDA fielded James Trolland in a series of elections in 2013 and 2014. Trolland contested the 2013 Aberdeen Donside by-election, campaigning on issues like the European Union, road accidents, potential police station closures, and school closures, and received 35 votes (0.15%).

It has roughly triangular, lobed leaves, and pale pink-red and cream, inconspicuous flowers. A rare species, it is known only from a single location in the south- west of Western Australia. It was discovered in 1968, and immediately brought into cultivation, but it would not be formally published and named until a decade later. Description Adenanthos ileticos grows as an erect, spreading lignotuberous shrub, usually up to 2 m (7 ft) high, but occasionally to 3 m (10 ft). It has roughly triangular leaves, up to 10 mm long and around 5 mm wide, with three lobes across the top. The flowers, which appear between August and November, are pale pink-red and cream, with a style which is about 32 mm long. It is somewhat similar in appearance to A. cuneatus and A. forrestii, but the former has much larger leaves, and the other much deeper lobes, than A. ileticos. Taxonomy This species was first collected by John Wrigley of the Australian National Botanic Gardens in 1968. Wrigley took cuttings and the plant was established in cultivation at the gardens. Later, Ernest Charles Nelson worked with Wrigley while developing a comprehensive taxonomic revision of Adenanthos. He recognised the cultivated plants as an undescribed species, and in 1973 revisited Wrigley's collection location to collect further native specimens. When he eventually published his revision in 1978, he gave this species the specific epithet ileticos from the Greek word for wriggle, as a pun on Wrigley. Wrigley states \\"his Irish sense of humour showed through when assigning the... name\\". Nelson followed George Bentham in dividing Adenanthos into two sections, placing A. ileticos into A. sect. Adenanthos because its perianth tube is fairly straight, and not swollen above the middle. He further divided the section into two subsections, with A. ileticos placed into A. subsect. Adenanthos for reasons including the length of its perianth. However Nelson discarded his own subsections in his 1995 treatment of Adenanthos for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. The placement of A. ileticos in Nelson's arrangement of Adenanthos may be summarised as follows: :Adenanthos ::A. sect. Eurylaema (4 species) ::A. sect. Adenanthos :::A. drummondii :::A. dobagii :::A. apiculatus :::A. linearis :::A. pungens (2 subspecies) :::A. gracilipes :::A. venosus :::A. dobsonii :::A. glabrescens (2 subspecies) :::A. ellipticus :::A. cuneatus :::A. stictus :::A. ileticos :::A. forrestii :::A. eyrei :::A. cacomorphus :::A. flavidiflorus :::A. argyreus :::A. macropodianus :::A. terminalis :::A. sericeus (2 subspecies) :::A. √ó cunninghamii :::A. oreophilus :::A. cygnorum (2 subspecies) :::A. meisneri :::A. velutinus :::A. filifolius :::A. labillardierei :::A. acanthophyllus The species is said to be not closely related to any other species, with its closest relatives probably being A. cuneatus and perhaps A. forrestii. Common names The common name most often reported for A. ileticos is Club-leaf Adenanthos. However Nelson regards this as a \\"concocted\\" common name, \\"rather crudely made up from an English word or two tagged on to unitalicized Adenanthos\\". He notes that the leaves of this species resemble neither a cudgel nor the symbol of the clubs card suit, making club-leaf a misnomer; and he adds that Wrigley's \\"would have respectfully preserved the associations intended by the original author\\". Distribution and habitat This species is known only from a single location around 10 to 30 km (5‚Äì20 mi) south of Salmon Gums on the Coolgardie‚ÄìEsperance Highway in southern Western Australia. It is locally quite abundant there, growing in sandy soil amongst open woodland of Eucalyptus and Hakea multilineata. Conservation status Though locally abundant within its range, A. ileticos is only known from a single location. The habitat there is very badly disturbed and is threatened by use of the area for agriculture and road construction. It was gazetted as rare in 1980, thus affording it legislative protection under the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950; but it has since been downgraded to \\"Priority Four - Rare\\" on the Department of Environment and Conservation's Declared Rare and Priority Flora List. This means that the species is considered to be rare, but there do not appear to be any serious threats to its survival. It is highly susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. Cultivation Adenanthos ileticos is considered a suitable background plant because of its unusual leaf shape, but its flowers are not at all showy. It is easily struck from cuttings, and grows well in well-drained soils. It is hardy to frost, but intolerant of high summer humidity.

It was established by the Florida Legislature in Chapter 627.351(6) Florida Statutes as a not-for-profit insurer of last resort, headquartered in Tallahassee, Florida, and quickly became the largest insurer in the state. The company has no connection to Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, the equivalent entity in Louisiana, or several similarly named \\"for-profit\\" subsidiaries in the Hanover Insurance Group. History=Catastrophe Hurricane Andrew in 1992 was the costliest storm the United States had experienced, with $26.5 billion in damage. It took a huge bite out of the reserves for claims held by 30 insurance companies doing business in Florida. Eleven insurance companies were bankrupted, while others stopped writing or renewing property insurance policies in the state. Those that remained raised premiums and deductibles across the board and limited the number of high-risk policies they wrote. Almost 1 million coastal homeowners were unable to find any company willing to insure their homes, so the Florida Legislature authorized the formation of the Florida Residential Property and Casualty Joint Underwriting Association (FRPCJUA) and the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association (FWUA) as the insurers of last resort. The Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund was also created and managed by the state as a resource for Florida consumers and insurers. It is funded by assessments to every property insurance policy in the state. Post Andrew Hurricane damage between 1992 and 2003 was relatively manageable, with none or one major hurricane each year except 1998 (which had two). During that time, new insurance companies were started and existing carriers began writing policies again. By 1999, Florida Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson stated that FRPCJUA and FWUA were close to shifting most of their 711,000 policies to private insurers. In 2002, the Florida Legislature passed legislation to merge the Florida Residential Property and Casualty Joint Underwriting Association (FRPCJUA) and the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association (FWUA). This resulted in the creation of Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (Citizens), whose goal is to more efficiently and effectively provide insurance to, and serve the needs of, home-owners in high-risk areas and others who cannot find coverage in the open, private insurance market. High activity There were four major storms in 2004 that made landfall in Florida, with total damages exceeding $57 billion. The following year brought five major storms, including Katrina, the most expensive Atlantic hurricane of all time. Once again, several companies pulled out of the Florida market due to an extraordinary number of hurricane and new sinkhole related claims. Citizens became not just the insurer of last resort, but the insurer of only resort for many Floridians. As of 2005, Florida owed almost $5 billion, which would be recovered through insurance policy assessments. The cost of insurance and its availability became an important \\"hot button\\" issue in Florida, especially in the 2006 elections. http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/03/11/1523471/strengthen-citizens- insurance.htmlhttp://www.insurancejournal.com/magazines/southeast/2004/10/11/partingshots/48941.htm Through 2006, Citizens Insurance charged its customers the highest rate approved by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation to avoid competing with private carriers. Insurance agents were prohibited from writing policies through Citizens if there was a private (not surplus lines) carrier that would write the risk. If a qualified insurance company was willing to take a group of policies, Citizens Insurance would transfer them to that company and cancel coverage. Customers had no recourse. Legislation Florida Senate Bill 2498, known as the Glitch Bill, was signed into law by Governor Crist on June 11, 2007. This legislation permitted agents to write a Citizens policy for customers if the premium for a comparable policy offered by a private carrier was 15% (instead of 25%) more expensive. Customers were also allowed to stay with Citizens Insurance if they were notified that their policy was being assigned to a private carrier. After 2010, eight global insurance carriers, including State Farm, entered or re-entered the Florida market. While the cost of reinsurance fell by 10% in 2010 and was expected to decrease more in 2011, the cost of insurance to consumers remained the same. Current situation In 2010, State Farm and Renaissance jointly formed DaVinci Reinsurance Ltd. in Bermuda, which covered more than 3.5 million Florida homes in 2010. That same year, Japan-based Tokio Millennium Re Ltd. became an approved Florida reinsurance vendor. As of 2011, Citizens had cash and investment totaling $11.3 billion and 1.3 million policyholders. The Florida Council of 100 published a position paper in 2010 entitled, \\"Into the Storm: Framing Florida's Looming Property Insurance Crisis\\". Chief among problems identified was that Citizens Insurance was undercapitalized and charges \\"rates that are not actuarially sound\\". The study also found that low-risk property owners were subsidizing high risk policies. They concluded that rates must be based on risk factors, including \\"geographical location, age of structure, and construction type\\". Florida House Bill 1495, passed in 2009, allows Citizens to raise rates gradually over five years to become actuarially sound. This was intended to shift the risk from taxpayers to the private sector. In the spring of 2012, Florida Governor Rick Scott stated in a survey with the Florida Council of 100 that Citizens Insurance had $504.8 billion in risk and just $6.1 billion in cash reserves. PolitiFact Florida, a fact checker of the Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald, researched Scott's claims. They concluded that while the company did have $500 billion in exposure, storms would have to damage or destroy every Citizens-insured home in all 67 Florida counties. A \\"century storm\\", with a 1% chance of occurring in any year, would generate no more than $21 billion in claims. Regarding the resources available to pay claims, the Citizen's own website states that their \\"Claims‚ÄêPaying Ability\\" is $19.5 billion. There is a $1.5 billion disparity, prompting the governor to order Citizens to reduce its risk. Barry Gilway was hired on June 18, 2012 as President and Chief Executive Officer of Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, replacing Tom Grady. With 42 years of experience in the insurance industry, he has a reputation as a turnaround specialist. He was keenly aware that his first priority was to shrink the number of Citizens policies. Throughout 2012, Citizens asked 174,000 of its nearly 1.4 million policyholders to move their policies to five private insurers. Approximately 25,000 of that group chose to remain with Citizens, http://articles.sun- sentinel.com/2012-09-26/business/fl-insurance-company- reviews-20120926_1_citizens-policies-private-insurers-citizens-customers but Florida's consumer insurance advocate Robin Smith Westcott warned that, \\"For the consumer, there really isn't enough information.\\" The state determined that those five private insurers were financially sound and able to absorb more customers, but issues such as higher premiums, customer responsiveness and number of consumer complaints must be determined by the policyholder. Florida law gives the consumer 30 days from notification to decline their policy transfer before it is assumed by a private firm. On February 8, 2013, Senator Jeff Brandes filed Florida Senate Bill 724, a comprehensive bill to overhaul Florida property insurance law to avoid new \\"hurricane taxes\\" which would be necessary if another catastrophic hurricane ravaged the state. The proposal is unpopular among many Citizens customers because it would mandate more rate increases to what they consider to be already high premiums. A similar bill was defeated in 2012. However, businessman, and former US Representative Tom Feeney commented, \\"It is unfair to continue to require 77 percent of Florida homeowners to subsidize Citizens policies, in addition to 100 percent of businesses, charities, religious institutions, renters, automobile policyholders, local governments and school boards.\\" The bill did not make it out of the Senate Banking and Insurance Committee before the Legislature adjourned in May, 2013. Takeout policies In an effort to encourage more private companies to acquire homeowners policies serviced by Citizens (known as takeout policies), Florida's Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR) was authorized to provide monetary incentives based on the number of Citizens policies acquired. In May 2013, just three of the eight members of the Citizens Board of Governors approved a deal in which Heritage Property and Casualty Insurance, formed in 2012, was offered $52 million to take over 60,000 accounts ($867 per policy). Florida CFO Jeff Atwater admitted that Heritage did not have the financial strength to take over the policies without the incentive, but Citizen's President Barry Gilway insisted that Heritage was \\"one of the most well-capitalized\\" in Florida. In March 2013, while negotiations were in progress, Heritage made a $110,000 donation to the re- election campaign of Governor Scott. A spokesman for the governor stated that the Citizens deal was not influenced by the governor. State leaders criticized the deal as \\"corporate welfare for a politically connected startup\\". Former Chief Financial Officer of Florida Alex Sink criticized the transaction, noting that Florida law limited the incentive to $100 per policy. She was also concerned that Heritage's reinsurance may not contain full risk transfer. New insurance companies in Florida must be approved by the Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR), which reviews the firm's business plan, projections and financial condition. The judgment of the OIR has been questioned because six of the 18 companies licensed to write \\"takeout\\" policies between 2007 and 2011 failed, even though Florida had no major hurricanes during that time frame. Florida taxpayers were forced to cover $400 million in losses. Despite concerns about the OIR, \\"State regulators have approved six property insurers to remove up to 151,000 policies from state-run Citizens Property Insurance Corp. in February [2014]. [...] Florida's Office of Insurance Regulation last month approved First Community Insurance Co. to take out as many as 51,249 Citizens policies, while Safepoint Insurance Co. may remove up to 40,000 policies. Elements Property Insurance Co. and Heritage Property Casualty Insurance Co. each have been approved for up to 20,000 policies. Southern Fidelity Insurance Co. and Southern Fidelity Property & Casualty can remove 10,000 each. Private insurers have taken out more than 312,000 Citizens policies this year. [Citizens] President Barry Gilway has said the goal is to trim Citizens down to about 800,000 policies.\\" As of April 2014, Citizen policies fell below one million, to 940,000. Cash reserves totaled $7.6 billion, a record. Model change Since the 2005 pull back by insurance giants Allstate, State Farm, etc., small, in-state companies have been taking a larger share of policies. These start-ups have not followed the traditional insurance model by accumulating cash reserves to cover expenses in high claim years. Instead, they pay as much as half of the policy premium for reinsurance to offshore companies to cover claims. In the seven years since the last major Florida hurricane, profits have risen, but many small companies shifted that money into affiliated businesses and ignored the need for a reserve. Insurance rates were based on the company making a reasonable profit after expenses, which included funding a reserve. The OIR suggests that insurance companies have reserves and reinsurance to cover a once in 100-year storm. Many firms in past years purchased less, and if claims exceeded reinsurance and reserves, they were taken over by the state, who paid off remaining claims. As the 2013 season started, pressure on insurers to lower rates was high because reinsurance costs fell by 15% since 2012, which also had lower costs. Claim expenses were down thanks to seven years without a major hurricane, and rate hikes during those years increased revenue from premiums.

Founded in 1888 as the Anglo-Chinese Girls School, they are among the oldest primary and secondary schools in Singapore. Their current premises are at the neighbourhood of Dover in Queenstown, Central Singapore.  History = Founding  The Beginning = Miss Sophia Blackmore, a 32-year-old Australian missionary from the Methodist Women's Foreign Missionary Society, had just established her first school in Singapore. Meanwhile, several influential Chinese families were persuading her to teach their daughters. A widow later offered Blackmore her home along Cross Street for teaching. On August 1888, the Anglo-Chinese Girls' School began with just eight Peranakan girls. = Contradicting accounts = However, there have been conflicting and differing stories on how the school really started, especially from the history book, Singapore: A Biography. According to the sources, Fairfield was started in August 1888 by Miss Sophia Blackmore, a 31-year-old missionary from the Methodist Mission. Her mandate in 1888 was to start a girls' school in Singapore in an enclave called Telok Ayer. She finally managed to start a class for eight Nonya girls in a little room at Cross Street. During that time, education for girls was definitely not favoured by the early traditional Chinese immigrants, even among the liberal- thinking Baba merchants. Miss Blackmore then started going house to house, trying to persuade families to enroll their girls in her school. However, little by little, they suspected that she was a government spy sent to catch them secretly gambling at cards. They had started to pass the word that the young missionary lady was in fact a 'mati-mati' agent who was helping the British government enforce its new law against gambling. Miss Blackmore's habit of asking for the women's names and writing them down in her notebook seemed to have alarmed the women. This was actually done as a record of who she visited, but still, the parents were suspicious of her. In spite of the differences and even suspicion from parents, Miss Blackmore persevered in her vision for a girls' school, and found that the parents were starting to welcome her more cordially, and would even invite her to sit down and chat over a cup of tea. They started to become more receptive to the idea that it would be good for their daughters to get a little education. In June 1888, Miss Blackmore finally managed to get her first pupil. She recalls, > How pleased we were when one little girl, hearing of the school, clapped her > hands and begged her mother to let her attend. She had been nicknamed > 'Ganadolf', which means bald, because her head had been shaved during > sickness. Not much knowledge entered that little bald head, but her own > willingness to come to school helped others to decide. After Ganadolf's mother agreed to send her daughter to school, a few other mothers followed her lead. Altogether, seven more pupils were signed on. Soon, she managed to rent out the front room of Nonya Boon, a rich widow's front room. The Anglo-Chinese Girls' School was finally founded. Early years The school was soon renamed Telok Ayer Girl's School. It is a common misconception that it was the original name the school was founded as. However, it is currently unknown when the name change took place. In 1893, the new principal, Emma Ferris, found that the furniture had been removed because the landlady had decided to rent the room out to someone else to be used as a shop. She managed to find a new site for the school in a corner house along Telok Ayer Road. By then, the school had 30 students. In 1905, the school moved from the corner house at Telok Ayer into a larger house at Neil Road. The principal, Miss Olson, realised that she required more space in the building and tried to raise funds for a new building. The biggest donation (US$5,000) came from a Mr James Fairfield from New England (patron of New England Branch of Women's Foreign Missionary Society or \\"WFMS\\"). This allowed the school to construct a new school building on a site provided by the government at Neil Road. The school moved from Telok Ayer into the new premises on Neil Road in 1912, and was promoted to a 'first-rate school' by the British Government. The relocated school was renamed Fairfield Girls' School. By 1917, the growth of the school had forced a hundred Fairfield girls to study in a dark shophouse. In response to this, a new block extension was completed, consisting of six classrooms and a chapel hall in 1924. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore, the school was shut down. It only reopened in 1945. Between 1942 and 1944, the school building was taken over by the Japan Military Force. In 1958 the school was renamed to Fairfield Methodist Girl's School.  On to Dover  FMS(P) Students, 2008 In 1983, the school moved to its current Dover campus to accommodate a larger population of students. Concurrently, the school went co-educational, becoming the first Methodist School in Singapore to do so, and became two separate schools, Fairfield Methodist Primary School and Fairfield Methodist Secondary School, each with its own administration, but still under the Fairfield Methodist School Board of Management. The schools also saw its first intake of boys as well. Both schools remain housed in the same campus and share common facilities. = Fairfield (Primary) = To highlight the common history, heritage and close relationship of the Fairfield Methodist Schools, the name of the school was changed from Fairfield Methodist Primary School to Fairfield Methodist School (Primary), effective from January 2009. = Fairfield (Secondary) = Fairfield Methodist Secondary School was granted autonomous status in 1996, for its academic and co-curricular achievements. Like its Primary counterpart, the school was renamed Fairfield Methodist School (Secondary) in January 2009.  Buildings of Fairfield  Fairfield Methodist School (Primary)  Achievements = Fairfield Primary  Fairfield Secondary  In 1987, Fairfield Methodist Secondary set up its Pioneer batch of The Boy's Choir, headed by Mrs Seet.

The school's Symphonic Band won a Gold award in the 2008 National Band Competition. Also in 2008, the school won Gold with Honours in the National Chinese Short Play competition, and 2nd prize in the Drama of History competition. The school's Boys Brigade won Gold in the JM Fraser Award for Excellence. The school's choir won Gold in the SYF 2007.

It is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It usually grows to 1 metre high, and has bright red flowers that appear mostly between August and December. The species was first formally described in 1839 by English botanist John Lindley in A sketch of the vegetation of the Swan River colony. Description Adenanthos barbiger grows as an upright or spreading small shrub, up to 1 m (3 ft) in height, often with many stems arising from an underground lignotuber. Young branches are covered in hairs, but these are lost with age. The leaves are long and thin (up to 8 cm long but only about 7 mm wide), oval-shaped, and lack a petiole. The flowers, which appear between August and December, consist of a bright red tubular perianth about 25 mm long, covered in silky white hairs; and a style about 40 mm long. Taxonomy This species was first published under the name Adenanthos barbigera by John Lindley in his 1839 A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. The specific epithet is from the Latin barba (\\"beard\\"), in reference to the white hairs on the perianth. Lindley did not specify a type specimen, but his herbarium contains a sheet designated as the type for the species. This sheet contains two specimens. One was collected by James Drummond, but both the date and the location of the collection is uncertain. The other is labelled \\"Vasse River... Mrs. Capt. Molloy, 1839.\\" These were most probably collected from Busselton in 1837 by John Molloy, not his wife Georgiana, who didn't visit Busselton until 1839. Georgiana Molloy sent them to James Mangles in London in 1838; they arrived early in 1839, and were immediately sent on to Lindley. In 1870, George Bentham published the first infrageneric arrangement of Adenanthos in Volume 5 of his landmark Flora Australiensis. Bentham divided the genus into two sections, placing A. barbigera in A. sect. Eurylaema, defined as containing those species with perianth tubes that are curved and swollen above the middle. In 1921, Carl Hansen Ostenfeld published Adenanthos intermedia (now A. intermedius), based on specimens found at Yallingup with leaf shape intermediate between those of A. barbiger and those of A. obovata. This was rejected in 1978 by Ernest Charles Nelson, who argued that leaf shape is inappropriate grounds for erecting a new species in this context, and that, in terms of systematically important characteristics, A. intermedius is indistinguishable from A. barbiger. He therefore synonymized A. intermedius with A. barbiger, but noted the possibility that A. intermedius is of hybrid origin. A. barbigera was retained in A. sect. Eurylaema in Ernest Charles Nelson's 1978 revision of Adenanthos, and again in his 1995 treatment of the genus for the Flora of Australia series. By this time, the ICBN had issued a ruling that all genera ending in -anthos must be treated as having masculine gender. At least one publication subsequently referred to it as Adenanthos barbigerus, but Nelson's 1995 treatment called it Adenanthos barbiger, and this is now the accepted name. The placement of A. barbiger in Nelson's arrangement of Adenanthos may be summarised as follows: :Adenanthos ::A. sect. Eurylaema :::A. detmoldii :::A. barbiger :::A. obovatus :::A. √ó pamela ::A. sect. Adenanthos (29 species, 8 subspecies) Distribution and habitat Adenanthos barbiger occurs between the west coast of Western Australia and the Darling Range, from Toodyay in the north, south to Manjimup. It is common in the north and south of its range, but appears to be quite uncommon in central parts. It mostly occurs in jarrah forest, but is sometimes found in more open habitats. It survives in a range of soils. It is highly susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. Cultivation This species is known to have been introduced into cultivation in Great Britain in 1845, but it not now much cultivated. It is a good bird attractor and tolerates frost. Propagation is from cuttings; new shoots can be removed from the lignotuber and will root well under mist. The species requires a well-drained soil in full or half sun.

An Indian, Jusepe Gutierrez, was the only survivor and the source of fragmentary information about the expedition. The route Humana and Leyva followed can not be determined with certitude, but it probably included traveling to what is today Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Background In 1593, Antonio Guti√©rrez de Humana (also spelled Umana) recruited Jusepe Gutierrez (usually called just Jusepe) in Culiac√°n, Mexico, to join him on an entrada (expedition) to what would become New Mexico. At the time, the Viceroy of New Spain was planning to authorize an official expedition and colonization of New Mexico. The expedition of Humana and his partner, Francisco Leyva de Bonilla (also spelled Leyba), was therefore illegal. After recruiting Jusepe, Humana and Leyva found additional Spanish and Indian soldiers and servants in Santa Barbara, Chihuahua and proceeded onward into what is today New Mexico. They remained there, among the Pueblo Indians near the Rio Grande, about one year. At the time there were no Spanish settlers in New Mexico, although there may have been other fortune-seekers and slavers living among the Pueblos. The expedition Jusepe told the story of the expedition to Juan de O√±ate.Hammond, George P. and Rey, Agapito, eds. Don Juan de O√±ate, Colonizer of New Mexico, 1595-1692.‚Äô‚Äô Albuquerque: U of NM Press, Vol.5, 1953, 416-419. Humana and Leyva and an unknown number of Spanish and Indian soldiers and servants left New Mexico to explore eastwards, presumably in search of rich kingdoms which were rumored to be just over the horizon. Their route led them by the Indian pueblo at Pecos and out onto the Great Plains of Texas where they met the Vaquero (Apache) Indians. They found numerous rancher√≠as, some of them abandoned, and herds of bison, the American buffalo. Jusepe said they found abundant water in many marshes, springs, and arroyos (brooks) as well as great numbers of plum trees and nuts. At some point they turned toward the north. The further they went the more abundant the bison became. After traveling 45 days, they crossed two big rivers and beyond was a very large Indian settlement ten leagues long (about 26 miles) and two leagues wide. One of the two rivers flowed through the settlement. Jusepe gave a brief description of the \\"Great Settlement.\\" The houses were built on a frame of stakes with straw roofs. They were built close together, separated by narrow pathways and, in some places, between the houses were fields of maize, pumpkins, and beans. The people of the settlement received the Spanish in peace and provided them with food. They depended upon buffalo hunting and also agriculture. Leaving the Settlement, three days to the north they came upon a \\"multitude of buffalo,\\" but no more Indian settlements. Discord between the leaders broke out. Humana spent an afternoon and morning in his tent apparently writing up his account of the dispute and then sent a soldier, Miguel P√©rez, to summon Leyva. Leyva came to Humana's tent, dressed in shirt and breeches only. Humana \\"drew a butcher knife which he carried in his pocket, unsheathed it, and stabbed Captain Leyba twice.\\" Leyva died and was quickly buried. Then Humana showed \\"some papers\\" to his men. He said that because Leyva had threatened to give him a \\"beating with a stick\\" he had killed him. The expedition continued, reaching a very large river ten days beyond the Great Settlement. The river was one-fourth of a league wide (about two-thirds of a mile, or one kilometer), deep and sluggish. \\"They did not dare to cross it.\\" It was here that five of the Indians, including Jusepe, deserted. Three became lost on the plains and Indians killed another. Jusepe was taken captive by Apaches and lived with them for a year until he escaped or was set free and made his way back to New Mexico. By this time (1596) O√±ate and a large group of settlers had arrived in New Mexico and Jusepe took up residence at the San Juan Bautista Pueblo. On February 16, 1599, O√±ate interviewed him concerning the Humana and Leyva expedition. According to later accounts from Indians, Humana and the other members of the expedition were killed by Indians 18 days beyond the Great Settlement.Bolton, Herbert Eugene, Spanish Exploration in the Southwest, 1542-1706. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1916, 261 Etzanoa, the \\"Great Settlement\\"  In 1601, Jusepe guided Juan de O√±ate, the founder of New Mexico and governor of the new colony, on a large expedition to the Plains. He took O√±ate to the same area where he had gone with Humana and Leyva. They found the ‚ÄúGreat Settlement‚Äù or Etzanoa, which was located along the Walnut River in Arkansas City, Kansas.Vehik, Susan C. \\"O√±ate's Expedition to the Southern Plains: Routes, Destinations, and Implications for Late Prehistoric Cultural Adaptations, Plains Anthropologist, Vol. 31, No, 111, 1986, 13-33 The people of the Great Settlement were almost certainly Wichita Indians whom O√±ate later called Rayados. The large river where Jusepe deserted the expedition may have been the Missouri, perhaps near Kansas City. The Missouri is about 500 yards wide at this point, not as wide as Jusepe estimated, but the largest river that could be reached in about 10 days travel from the Great Settlement.Washington University News Room, 9 Nov 2006; http://news.wustl.edu/news/Pages/8070.aspx This would be the first known visit of Europeans to the Missouri River. What does not fit very well with this possible route is Jusepe's comment that three days beyond the Great Settlement that they came upon \\"such a multitude of buffalo that the plain‚Äîwhich was level, for there are no mountains‚Äîwas so covered with them that they were startled and amazed at the sight.\\" If the Great Settlement were at Wichita or Arkansas City, three days travel toward the Missouri River would place the expedition in the rocky and rolling Flint Hills not a plain. Moreover, in historic times buffalo were most abundant in the shorter grass prairies west of longitude 97¬∞ rather than the tall grass prairies to the east. Thus, the contradictions in Jusepe's account will continue to provoke speculation. Conceivably the \\"great river\\" was the Kansas, which during high water would have been deep and wide. The Platte River in Nebraska has also been suggested, but that would require a major recalculation of the route of Humana, Leyva, and O√±ate and the location of the Great Settlement.Bolton, 201 ReferencesExternal links * titolo=Francisco Leyva de Bonilla and Antonio Gutierrez de Humana on New Mexico Office of the State Historian Category:Spanish explorers of North America Category:Explorers of the United States Category:1590s in New Spain Category:1590s in New Mexico Category:16th-century explorers Category:People of New Spain Category:Colonial United States (Spanish) Category:Colonial New Mexico Category:Spanish Texas Category:Pre- statehood history of Kansas Category:Pre-statehood history of New Mexico Category:Pre-statehood history of Oklahoma Category:Pre-statehood history of Texas Category:Spanish colonization of the Americas ","title":"Humana and Leyva expedition"},{"id":"26653235","text":"Dalida is a French and Italian two-parts-film for television directed by Joyce Bu√±uel released on TV in 2005.

Pre-World War II life and career Born in Kristiania (present-day Oslo) and named Edvard Kreutz, he changed his surname in the early 1900s. Initially, he used \\"Sylow-Kreutz\\" and \\"Sylou Kreutz\\" interchangeably. He was however sued by Colonel Carl Christian Weinwich Sylow in 1911, who claimed that he did not have the right to use the Sylow family name. Kristiania City Court concluded the case on 2 October 1911, with the verdict being that, according to the Norwegian name law, he could not use the Sylow name. The court found that he would however be allowed to use the name Sylou, which he claimed had been the surname of an early 19th-century ancestor who had emigrated to Norway. He studied in Norway under the supervision of Agathe Backer-Gr√∏ndahl, Catharinus Elling and Iver Holter, and also for several years abroad, in Berlin, Germany, and Vienna, Austria-Hungary. He made his concert debut in 1910, went on nationwide tours in his early career, and was a music critic for the newspaper Morgenbladet from 1919. He also toured in France, giving concerts in Paris. Sylou-Creutz and his wife Signe Jonson had two sons, born in 1908 and 1910. Before World War II he worked as a pianist and composer, writing songs and piano pieces. He had been involved in the pioneer years of Norwegian radio in the 1920s.Dahl, 1978: p. 301 He accompanied the vocals of Dagny Schelderup in one of the earliest broadcasts of Kristiania Broadcasting on 12 April 1923, the first ever concert in Norwegian radio, featuring music by among others the Norwegian composers Edvard Grieg, Giacomo Puccini and Christian Sinding. Among the other artists Sylou-Creutz collaborated with as an accompanist was the renowned Norwegian opera singer Kirsten Flagstad. In 1936 Sylou-Creutz joined the Norwegian Society of Composers, and from 1934 to 1939, he taught the piano at the Oslo Conservatory of Music. Early on in his career, Sylou-Creutz offered private piano lessons in his home in Pilestredet, Oslo. Wartime collaboration Sylou-Creutz was a member of the Fascist party Nasjonal Samling. In March 1940 he applied for a job in radio broadcasts from Germany to Norway, and he was hired as program presenter and news reader, based in Bremen. These broadcasts were propagandistic, and started on 1 April 1940, having been preceded by German broadcasts to Sweden from 20 November 1939 and to Denmark from January 1940. Sylou-Creutz worked anonymously in this job.Dahl, 1978: p. 129 The aim of the German broadcasts was to sway the generally pro-British Norwegian public opinion in favour of Germany, at which the broadcasts were not successful.Dahl, 1991: p. 174 Syloud-Creutz continued his broadcasts after the German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940.Dahl, 1978: p. 128 In the second half of April, the broadcasts switched from conveying German views on Norway (and often omitting Norway altogether, in favor of other war news) to being responses to British propaganda news.Dahl, 1978: p. 130 This shift was especially caused by the speech made by J. H. Marshall-Cornwall on 13 April, which called for Norwegian sabotage against the Germans. Sylou-Creutz also lamented the absence of German-friendly Victor Mogens as a foreign news commentator in Norwegian radio.Dahl, 1978: p. 131 Mogens had been pressured to resign in 1936. By late April and early May 1940, preparations were made to close the Germany-based broadcasts to Norway, and instead make use of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. Sylou-Creutz moved to Norway in early June after his last broadcast on German soil, and continued his career in Norway.Dahl, 1978: p. 133 Via contacts in the German Reichskommissariat Norwegen (which was the highest authority over the Broadcasting Corporation), Sylou-Creutz also managed to see his music get a lot of airtime. On 28 September 1940, the Nazis took more control over the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation; the pre-war director Olav Midttun was fired, and Edvard Sylou- Creutz and Eyvind Mehle were installed as program directors.Dahl, 1978: pp. 289‚Äì290 Sylou-Creutz was also responsible for music.Dahl, 1978: p. 186 While being program directors, Mehle and Sylou-Creutz were subordinates of commissary president Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie.Dahl, 1978: p. 294 There was a considerable rivalry and antagonism between Christie and Mehle, Christie and administrative director Carl B√∏dtker, and to a lesser degree between Mehle and Sylou-Creutz.Dahl, 1978: pp. 294‚Äì297 Among other things, Mehle and Sylou- Creutz bickered over the right to the largest office.Dahl, 1978: p. 307 More importantly however, Mehle and Sylou-Creutz were on the same side in that they were German-friendly. By December 1941, reports of the internal quarrels involving Sylou-Creutz had reached the Norwegian-language American newspaper Nordisk Tidende, which described them as a \\"showdown between the Germans' errand boys\\". In 1940 Sylou-Creutz made announcements stating that Jewish music should be banned from Norwegian airwaves and all performers should also be members of Nasjonal Samling. Among the conflicts Sylou-Creutz was involved with during his time as program director, was in connection with the radio broadcasting of church services. Sylou-Creutz demanded to be informed in advance of who would speak at the services, and to be given a veto. In 1941 this led to a conflict between the Church of Norway and the Nazi-led Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, with increasing attempts at censorship from the Nazi authorities and boycotts from the priests. By the fall of 1941, the German occupational authorities had confiscated the radios from all Norwegians who were not members of Nasjonal Samling. This increased the boycott of the radio broadcasts by the priests. Sylou-Creutz, having failed in his attempt at making performing in the radio a legal obligation for Norwegian artists, on 27 August 1942 banned six artists belonging to the concert company Br√∏drene Hals' Konsertbyr√• from renting the Aulaen Hall of the University of Oslo. The artists banned were Robert Riefling, Jan W√∏lner, Frithjof Backer-Gr√∏ndahl, Amalie Christie, Rolf St√∏rseth and Kari Glaser. The ban attracted great controversy, with the national music consultant Geirr Tveitt resigning in an 18-page protest letter to minister Gulbrand Lunde. Tveitt called Sylou-Creutz' actions \\"... madness... for it can lead to nothing but the destruction of all musical life.\\" Voks√∏ 1994: p. 260 The ban was reversed on 26 September 1942. Amidst towering intrigue, Sylou-Creutz was let go from the Broadcasting Corporation on 28 October 1942.Dahl, 1978: p. 298 In connection with the 100th anniversary of the birth of the famous Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg on 15 June 1943 Sylou-Creutz was to hold the official Grieg concert in Stavanger. The city's orchestra had been offered in public funds to perform with him, but declined. Sylou-Creutz ended up playing alone for an audience of 48 people, 40 of whom had been given free tickets. The paying members of the audience were asked to move from the gallery to the front benches. In comparison, non-Nazi artist Ivar Johnsen performed a single piece of Grieg's music in the park Forn√∏yelsesparken in Stavanger in storming rain with an audience of between 1,000 and 2,000 people the same day.Voks√∏ 1994: p. 338 At yet another concert, organized by the Norwegian-German Society in Larvik on 23 November 1943, almost no audience attended the concert hall. Sylou-Creutz performed works by Grieg, Franz Schubert, Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner, as well several of his own compositions. The Nazi-censured newspaper Larvik Dagblad stated at the time that it was to Sylou-Creutz's credit \\"both as a human being and an artist\\" to be able to perform \\"under these circumstances\\". Sylou-Creutz died on 11 May 1945 in Oslo, and was buried at the cemetery Vestre gravlund in Oslo on 18 May 1945. In the post-war legal purge in Norway, a file on the late Sylou-Creutz was compiled by the Norwegian authorities. His widow, Signe Sylou-Creutz, was convicted of treason in June 1947, being fined and ordered to pay a further in damages by Oslo City Court.

Alexander, wife of the First Lord of the Admiralty on 23 March 1944 and completed on 11 August 1944. After the war she was transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy and renamed Pukaki. Service history=As Loch Achanalt (K424) Loaned to the Royal Canadian Navy, the ship was commissioned on 31 July 1944, and joined the 6th Canadian Escort Group at Derry for convoy defence and anti-submarine operations in the North-Western Approaches. On 16 October Loch Achanalt and engaged and sank the off the Faroe Islands. In January 1945 the 6th Escort Group was transferred to convoy defence duties in the English Channel based at Portsmouth. From 14 March to 20 April, the group were deployed from Plymouth to the English Channel and South-Western Approaches on convoy defence duties.Rohwer, p. 400 Later in April they sailed to Halifax for convoy defence duties. Following the German surrender, the Group was disbanded on 23 May 1945. Loch Achanalt was returned to the Royal Navy in July and put into reserve at Sheerness. In March 1948 Loch Achanalt was sold to Royal New Zealand Navy with five other Loch- class frigates. On 13 September 1948 she was formally transferred and renamed HMNZS Pukaki (F424). As Pukaki (F424) On 15 October 1948 Pukaki sailed from Portland with three other Loch-class frigates, arriving at Auckland in January 1949 to join the 11th Frigate Flotilla for patrols and exercises. On 25 June 1950 Pukaki was placed at the disposal of the UN Forces in Korea. In August Pukaki and sister-ship arrived at Sasebo to join the UN naval command. Initially attached to Task Group 96.5 for escort duties between Japan and Korea, in September she was transferred to Task Group 90.7 to support of landings by the US 1st Marine Division at Inchon, rejoining Task Group 96.5 in October to protect minesweeping operations prior to the landings at Wonsan. In November she was relieved by the frigate and returned to Auckland to refit, after which she was placed in reserve. Recommissioned in December 1952 for service in the 11th Frigate Flotilla, Pukaki was assigned to detached service with the Royal Navy's Far East Fleet 4th Frigate Squadron based at Singapore in September 1953. In January 1954 the frigate was deployed in the Yellow Sea for trade protection and as back-up to UN forces in Korea if required. In May she was transferred to Singapore for anti-terrorist operations in the Malayan Emergency, returning to Auckland in September. She rejoined the 4th Frigate Squadron in the Far East Fleet in June 1955, for trade protection and Korean coast guard ship duties, while also carrying out joint exercises with United States Navy ships, returning to Auckland in May 1956. In December she escorted the supply vessel during the initial stage of the journey to McMurdo Sound in Antarctica. In 1957 and 1958 the ship was deployed as a weather reporting ship during the \\"Operation Grapple\\" nuclear tests at Christmas Island. Between 1959 and 1962 she once more joined the Far East Fleet for SEATO exercises and patrols. From 1963-1965 she supported the United States \\"Operation Deep Freeze\\" Antarctic operations. Pukaki alternated with an American DER picket frigate operating from Dunedin in summer months to track United States Navy Lockheed C-130 Hercules deployments and other flights from Harewood airport in Christchurch to McMurdo Base in the Ross Dependency, offering the potential for search and rescue in the Southern Ocean and service to the weather station on Campbell Island. Sea conditions probably shortened by two years the service life of Pukaki and the other surviving Loch-class frigate, Rotoiti. This forced the United States Navy to deploy two Edsall-class DERs to Dunedin for the final three deployments in 1966-68. Put into reserve in May 1965 Pukaki was sold in October. The ship was towed to Hong Kong and scrapped in January 1966.

Situated on just under 30 acres, Bruyn Estate has two residential dwellings totaling eight bedrooms. It is on the east side of the Shawangunk Kill at the Ulster/Orange Counties line. Wallkill Avenue is north of the building with the Shawangunk Kill east of it. The one half story frame farmhouse with a partially exposed cellar and interior end chimneys was constructed c.1835 on a site overlooking the Shawangunk Kill. The northwest facade of the five-bay center hall structure has 6/6 sashes with plain window heads and sills. The center entry, framed by pilasters which support a full entablature, has three-paned sidelights. Bruyn Estate at Red Mills Farm (Historic Farmhouse) is significant as a distinctive example of Greek Revival style architecture. It is also significant as a surviving component of an industrial complex originating in the eighteenth century. The architectural integrity of the house is embodied in its form, original materials, unique iron grill work, elaborate interior woodwork and door moldings. The farmhouse at Red Mills known as 'Red Mills Farm' was built c.1835 by Roe and Arminda Coleman on this site overlooking the Shawangunk Kill. The early mill site included a sawmill and gristmill which were in proximity to the miller's house (only the miller's house survives). The location allowed the miller a view of mill operations, and the height of the water in the mill could also be monitored. The sawmill and gristmill were destroyed by fire in the mid- twentieth century, leaving only remnants of a dam and mill race channel, and the existing miller's house. (The mill site is located on a separate parcel.) The site was originally owned by the patentee, Abraham Jansen. Roe Coleman purchased the land in 1835 and began construction of the mill buildings and the house. (A date stone set in the garden wall which surrounds the house reads, 'Erected by M. Webb / July 4, 1839'. This may refer to the date the wall was constructed since it does not relate to the house or it may have come from one of the other mill buildings.

It was the most active of the first group of N-alkyl naphoylindoles discovered by the team led by John W Huffman, several years after the family was initially described with the discovery of the N-morpholinylethyl compounds pravadoline (WIN 48,098), JWH-200 (WIN 55,225) and WIN 55,212-2 by the Sterling Winthrop group. Several other N-alkyl substituents were found to be active by Huffman's team including the n-butyl, n-hexyl, 2-heptyl, and cyclohexylethyl groups, but it was subsequently determined that the 2-methyl group on the indole ring is not required for CB1 binding, and tends to increase affinity for CB2 instead. Consequently, the 2-desmethyl derivative of JWH-007, JWH-018, has slightly higher binding affinity for CB1, with an optimum binding of 9.00 nM at CB1 and 2.94 nM at CB2, and JWH-007 displayed optimum binding of 9.50 nM at CB1 and 2.94 nM at CB2. Another drug similarly named JHW-007 (not JWH) is a cocaine analog (the di-para-fluoro benztropine, being essentially a hybrid between benzatropine and difluoropine; with fluorine groups in the former or being descarbmethoxy in the latter) and atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor, but is distinct from and not the same as this JWH-007.  Legal status  In the United States, all CB1 receptor agonists of the 3-(1-naphthoyl)indole class such as JWH-007 are Schedule I Controlled Substances.

It is located at 36 St Andrew Square, in the city's first New Town. The building was completed in 1774 as a private town house for Sir Lawrence Dundas by the architect Sir William Chambers. Much altered internally and extended over the years, today it is the registered office of the Royal Bank of Scotland and its parent, NatWest Group and is protected as a category A listed building. Background The site was previously occupied by a rural tavern known as \\"Peace and Plenty\\".http://www.oldedinburghclub.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/BOEC- OS/Volume-22.pdf This stood on the road from Edinburgh to Stockbridge, later called Gabriels Road, and still extant at its extremities. When the town council made plans for a New Town drawn up by James Craig in 1767, the site of Dundas House was shown as a proposed church, St. Andrew's (hence the name of the square), acting as a counterpart to St. George's Church on what became Charlotte Square (originally to be called George Square but another scheme to the south of the Old Town had taken that name first). The two were separated by the New Town itself laid out on a formal grid centred on George Street along which the two churches were to face each other. Sir Lawrence Dundas saw the layout and decided the church site would make a good location for a prestigious town mansion, and in 1768 he acquired the land. Initially, he invited designs from the architects John Carr and James Byres, but their proposals were not adopted. Dundas then turned to Sir William Chambers who drew up plans for the mansion in early 1771. The designs were agreed, and soon afterwards construction began on the house. The building was completed by January 1774. In 1780 Hugo Arnot described the building as \\"incomparably the handsomest townhouse we ever saw\\". The proposed St Andrew's Church was subsequently built at a less prominent site at 13 George Street. Commercial use Lord Dundas died in 1781 and his son Sir Thomas Dundas, 2nd Baronet inherited the house. Having no great desire to live here (then the site was in the midst of a huge building site as the New Town construction began) he sold the house to the government in 1794 who converted it to the Excise House, which opened in 1795. At this stage it gained the royal coat of arms of the British Customs and Excise in its pediment. Dundas House was acquired by the Royal Bank of Scotland in 1825 for ¬£35,300. The interior was altered in 1825 and 1828 by Archibald Elliot the Younger, and in 1836 by William Burn. Much of these alterations were removed by John Dick Peddie in 1857 when a banking hall with a distinctive pierced dome was added to the rear of the existing house. In 1834, a statue of John Hope, 4th Earl of Hopetoun, who had served as Governor of the Bank 1820‚Äì23, was placed in the garden in front of Dundas House. The statue was originally commissioned in 1824 by a group of high ranking persons in Edinburgh, led by James Gibson Craig, from the sculptor Thomas Campbell. Campbell created it in Rome and it was shipped to Britain in 1828. The current position was agreed by the architect in January 1830, and an appropriate plinth was designed to respect the frontage of Dundas House. Although several sources state that the statue was designed for Charlotte Square, there is no evidence of any plans for locating on that site, and Hope's link to the Royal Bank make Dundas House a more obvious first choice. In 1972 the 19th-century banking screens and counters were removed and replaced by white marble counters. Architecture Boardroom ceiling, Dundas House The ornate entrance hall The starry domed ceiling over the banking hall in Dundas House Dundas House is a free-standing house designed in the Palladian style. It was modelled on Roger Morris's 1729 Palladian villa Marble Hill House in Twickenham, London but is much grander. The house is built of cream sandstone ashlar, weathered to light grey, from Ravelston Quarry some three miles to the west. It is fronted with a set of Corinthian pilasters supporting a large central pediment. The house is faced with ashlar with a rusticated ground floor. The large, opulent banking hall, added by Peddie in 1857, is covered by a large circular blue dome which is pierced by 5 tiers of star-shaped gold-rimmed coffered skylights radiating out from the central oculus which diminish in size towards the centre, representing the firmament. An illustration of this star pattern featured on Royal Bank of Scotland's \\"Islay\\" series of banknotes which were in circulation 1987‚Äì2016. Future use In plans unveiled by the International Music and Performing Arts Charitable Trust Scotland (IMPACT Scotland) in 2017, a new concert hall called the Impact Centre will be built behind Dundas House, replacing a block of banking offices that was built in the 1960s. Dundas House will be retained as a bank branch, accessible to the public.

It was manufactured mainly by the Obukhov State Plant (OSP) in St. Petersburg, as well as under licence by Vickers Limited in Great Britain. The gun was used as medium artillery on several Russian dreadnoughts and as main artillery on cruisers, as well as coastal artillery. It was succeeded by the 130 mm/50 B13 Pattern 1936 naval gun, which became the standard destroyer gun of the Soviet Navy during World War II. History In 1911 OSP received an order to design a semi-automatic 130 mm/60 caliber naval gun for the Main Shipping Administration. The order asked for two prototypes, one for cartridges, one for rounds. On 12 July 1912 the cartridge-version with a 55 caliber barrel was approved. In September 1912 it was decided to go with the hydro-spring rather than the hydro-pneumatic recoil system. Earlier an OSP designed semi-automatic breech mechanism was rejected in favor of a Vickers design. In 1913 an initial order of 471 guns was placed with OSP. By 1 January 1917 143 guns had been delivered, with 96 due until the end of that year. The remaining 282 guns were supposed to be delivered in 1918. The first charge of guns was used to equipped the cruiser Svetlana and the Imperatritsa Mariya- class battleships of the Black Sea Fleet. Another order of 100 guns was placed in 1913 with Vickers Ltd., of which 24 were ready for delivery by 16 September 1914. Of these 7 were shipped to Arkhangelsk in October 1914. A further 12 guns destined for Russian cruiser Varyag were delivered to Russia on the same route as the repairs of Varyag were delayed, where they were put to the defense of Saaremaa island. The Soviet Navy retained the 130mm/55 Pattern 1913 naval gun and produced additional guns under the designation B-7, as the OSP had been renamed Works No. 232 \\"Bolshevik\\" in 1922. In 1923, 12 guns had been placed in four coastal batteries, one in Odessa and three along the Caucasian coast. In 1930 a minor modernizations were made to a few guns at the \\"Bolshevik\\" works, improving the loading mechanism and enhancing elevation to +40¬∞.

The Bulgarians won after invading at the right time; they met little resistance in the north because of the Byzantines fighting the Arabs in AnatoliaTheophanes Continuatus, p. 312., cited in Vasil'ev, A. (1902) (in Russian). Vizantija i araby, II. pp. 88, p. 104, pp. 108‚Äì111 but eventually the Byzantines concluded peace with the Arabs. They sent their whole army against the Bulgarians but were decisively defeated in the battle of Achelous in 917. After several more victories Simeon I of Bulgaria prevailed. Petar switched sides to the Byzantines and was deposed and sent to Bulgaria; Pavle Branoviƒá was instated by the Bulgarians in 917, ruling until 920‚Äì921. Rule Serbia during the 10th century. Zaharija was sent in 920 by Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 920‚Äì944) to retake the throne (as the rightful prince) but was captured by Pavle and sent to Symeon in Bulgaria. After this, the Byzantines sent envoys to Pavle, trying to make him a Byzantine ally; in the meantime, the Bulgarians tried to indoctrinate Zaharija. The Byzantines seem to have given much gold to Pavle in order to win him over, showing the danger a strong Bulgaria posed to Serbia. The Bulgarian troops were concentrated in Thrace, where Symeon besieged cities. In 921, Pavle was won over to the Byzantines, and he began to prepare an attack on Bulgaria. Symeon was interrupted during the campaign and was warned; he spared a few troops, sending them with Zaharija, and promising him the throne if he would defeat Pavle. The intervention was successful; Zaharija gained control of Serbia by spring 922. Once again, a Bulgarian ally was on the Serbian throne, but not for long. Zaharija, who had long lived in Constantinople where he had been heavily influenced by the Byzantines, probably resented the Bulgarians after his capture, and was not truly won over. It was natural that the Serbs were pro-Byzantine and anti-Bulgarian; the Byzantines were distant and offered greater independence, while powerful Bulgaria interfered with its neighbour. Zaharija resumed his original alliance with the Byzantine Empire. Zaharija started to unite several Slavic tribes along the common border to rebel against Bulgaria. In 923, Symeon sent an insufficient number of troops to quell the rebels; several Bulgarian generals were killed, and their heads and weapons were sent by Zaharija as gifts to the Byzantines.Byzantine style, religion and civilization: in honour of Sir Steven Runciman, p. 349-350 It was after Symeon tried and failed to ally himself with the Fatimids in a naval siege on Constantinople, and when he lost the battle against Zaharija, that he decided to meet with Romanus. In September 923, Symeon arrived at Constantinople, demanding a meeting with the Emperor. During the meeting Romanus managed to stir up Symeon, asking how the Bulgarian could live with so much blood on his hands. Peace was discussed, but Symeon left before any terms were signed or sworn. Presumably Symeon wanted keep the Greeks at peace so that he could tackle the problem posed by Zaharija. In 924, a large Bulgarian army was sent into Serbia, led by ƒåaslav, his second cousin. The army ravaged a good part of Serbia, forcing Zaharija to flee to Croatia. Symeon summoned all the Serbian dukes to pay homage to their new prince, but, instead of instating ƒåaslav, he took them all captive, and annexed Serbia. Bulgaria now considerably expanded its borders, neighbouring its ally Michael of Zahumlje and Croatia, where Zaharija was exiled. Croatia at this time had one of its most powerful leaders in history, Tomislav. ƒåaslav took the throne with Byzantine aid in 927, ruling Serbia until the 950s. No more is heard of Zaharija.

It was developed as a fork of , following controversy surrounding the game's development. The game runs on a heavily modified version of the Quake engine known as the DarkPlaces engine. Its gameplay is inspired by and , but with various unique elements. Gameplay deathmatch gameplay video Xonotic gameplay screenshot Screenshot of the Xonotic main menu - Version 0.8.2 Title Music \\"Rising of the Phoenix\\" There are sixteen different game modes in , including classic modes like deathmatch and capture the flag. In order to unlock more game modes, players must complete different levels of gameplay. To score points, players must kill enemies using futuristic weapons while completing objectives. The gameplay is very fast-paced, due to players being able to move at high speed and jump erratically. While the basic concept is inspired by other games of the same genre, there are several unique elements. Emphasis is placed on movement and player physics, with a focus on gaining speed, jumping great distances, and conquering the level geometry. This is done with classic techniques including strafe jumping, bunny hopping, and rocket jumping. Weapons have special abilities such as multiple fire modes, which increase the tactical options available to the players. The game features a futuristic aesthetic, with maps set in high-tech environments and in space. The game runs on the DarkPlaces engine and thus supports bloom, dynamic lighting and shadowing, offset mapping, and high-dynamic-range rendering. The developers claim that the graphics quality is comparable to commercial video game titles released between 2006 and 2007. Players can also personalize their HUD according to their exact preferences. Development In March 2010, a controversy arose over the original being licensed to IllFonic game studios in order to create a commercial version. The original creator, Lee Vermeulen, secretly made a deal with a company known as IllFonic according to which the latter got the hold over the trademark. Since this turn of events was unexpected by the community and most developers, they promised to create a fork controlled by a community in an open manner. Approximately seven months later the source code was published via Git. A preview version was released on 23 December 2010. Version 0.5 was released on 8 September 2011. It featured multi-language support, seven new maps, vehicle support, and enhancements to weapons and player movement, among other changes. Since the release of this version, Team Xonotic's stated aim has been to \\"create the best possible fast- paced open-source FPS game\\". Version 0.6 was released on 8 March 2012. It comes with sRGB lightmap rendering, a new menu interface, 4 new maps, an integrated statistics system (XonStats), a Sandbox editing mode and the long- awaited feature of ClientSide QuakeC (CSQC) networked players. Bug fixes and optimizations have also been made. Version 0.7, was released on 8 June 2013. It features a client-side rendering of players, 4 new maps and a complete re- write of the in-game chat system. Additionally, the team has migrated to the gmqcc QuakeC compiler which generates faster, more optimized program files. The next major release of , version 0.8, was released on January 16, 2015. It includes, among the other things, a new weapon, monsters, buffs and new maps. The most recent releases were two minor releases: version 0.8.1, which was released on August 26, 2015 and 0.8.2 on April 1, 2017. They added new maps, new themes for the menu, and new gameplay features. In addition, the codebase of Xonotic was refactored. Reception Phoronix praised 's gameplay and graphics, and declared the game \\"one of the most visually-impressive open- source games available for [multiple platforms]\\". Larabel said, \\"For being a community-backed open-source game without the support of any major game studio, is doing great.\\" Xonotic was also deemed \\"the Best Free Multiplayer FPS Linux Can Muster\\" by Softpedia.

Green-Works enables organisations to create social and environmental benefits from their disposal of large quantities of office furniture. Green-Works recycles used and unwanted furniture from UK businesses. In 2011 Green-Works was taken over by London Re-use Limited. History The company started off in 2000 with a ¬£400 capital and a van. In 2007, its turn-over was ¬£2.1 million. In the Autumn of 2011 Green-Works was taken over by London Re-use Limited and now forms the commercial division of that organisation. Social impact In 2006, DELCE Primary School had purchased new furniture for its reception area, as well as other furniture for staff and they purchased it at an affordable price without being detrimental to the education of children. Townsend School in Southwark had 40 children's desks relaminated with a vinyl finish by Green-Works. Since starting up in 2000, Green-Works has taken more than 60,000 tonnes of furniture that may have otherwise ended up in landfill. When a product cannot be sold, it is dismantled and recycled. This procedure has landed Green-Works a coveted Queen's Award. Schools, small businesses and charities have all saved around ¬£2.5 million from buying their furniture from Green-Works. Recycling not only prevents landfill and methane emissions but it can also provide a much-needed education. This is the case when Green-Works along with NGO Construction & Development Partnership (CODEP), and Build on Books (BoB) delivered 200,000 books to 100 schools in Waterloo, Sierra Leone. This has helped reduce the number of children who are illiterate due to insufficient resources in the country. A further 500,000 books are to be delivered in 2010 to enhance the 'book to person' ratio in the country. Purchasing furniture from Green-Works not only allows organisations to save funds but also helps Green-Works to increase its existing workforce by providing employment opportunities or voluntary opportunities to help those who are at a disadvantage in the employment market. Green-Works exports to the developing world by donating huge consignments of second-hand furniture to a range of projects.

Greek War of Independence According to some Greek historians, he was born in the Greek-speaking town of Delvinaki, Epirus, when the region was under Ottoman rule.Detorakis, Turkish rule in Crete, p. 383 Consequent research, however, by other Greek historians disputes this fact. Nevertheless, all agree that he was born in Epirus. Alexander Mammopoulos attributes his birthplace conclusively to an Albanian-speaking village of the same name in modern P√´rmet District, while Stavros Karkaletsis, claims that he was born in the Greek-speaking village of Bularat, in Dropull. He grew up in Trieste, where his father worked as a merchant. In 1816 he became a member of the Greek patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia. In March 1826, while the War of Independence was in full swing, he participated, together with other revolutionary leaders (Nikolaos Krieziotis, Vasos Mavrovouniotis and Stavros Liakopoulos), in an attempt to create an alliance with the Emir of Lebanon, Bashir Shihab II, against the Ottoman Empire. However, when Dalianis landed in Beirut to incite a revolt there, the local emir was far from certain that he would defy the Ottomans.

Ekdotike Athenon, 1997. , p. 286 In an attempt to revive the revolution there, Dalianis, with 700 men (600 on foot, 100 with horses and mules), landed initially at Gramvousa on 5 January 1828, but decided to restart their expedition from Sfakia. In March, he took possession of Frangokastello castle, a 14th-century Venetian fortification in the Sfakia region. The local Ottoman ruler, Mustafa Naili Pasha, gathered an army of 8,000 men in order to suppress the revolt. The castle's defence was doomed when Mustafa's Ottoman force of 8,000 men and 300 cavalry arrived on 13 May 1828. After several days, the fortress fell back into Ottoman hands, and Dalianis perished along with 385 men.Dana Facaros, Michael Pauls. Crete. New Holland Publishers, 2003. , p. 148. Mustafa's force also lost 800 men.

History Rex was born in England, in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, and came to Toronto as a young man in 1920 and studied at the Ontario College of Art. After graduating, Woods worked in various Toronto art studios. In 1928 he married Etheldreda Jeanne Mott, a ballet dancer with the Metropolitan Opera Company. Sometime in the 1930s, Woods decided to work independently and quickly became one of Canada's most successful and sought-after illustrators. He contributed on a regular basis to popular magazines such as Maclean's and the Canadian Home Journal, and drew advertisements for many of Canada's leading companies. He painted one of the most iconic Canadian images of the twentieth century, The Macdonald's Lassie, used for decades by Macdonald Tobacco on their Export \\"A\\" brand of cigarettes. Not so widely known is his important monumental group portrait of the Fathers of Confederation, a copy of the original by Robert Harris destroyed in the fire on Parliament Hill in 1916. The copy is a liberal recreation in which Woods added three figures to the original composition. The picture was commissioned by Confederation Life Assurance and donated as a centennial gift to the country in 1967. It hangs in Parliament. Woods's commercial illustrations are indicative of several threads in the popular culture of Canada between 1930 and 1950. His magazine covers often objectify and idealize women but this work is perhaps more reflective of his clients and their market than the artist's own attitude. Certainly he was watching the work of major American illustrators such as JC Leyendecker, since Woods borrows some of Leyendecker's trademark white-on-white brushstrokes and New Year's baby themes. Unlike Norman Rockwell, to whom he has also been logically compared, some of Woods's pictures, such as The Vision of the Cross (1935, ROM 998.86.110) are profoundly disturbing and are indicative of his long-standing objections to war.'Vision of the Crosses', Canadian Home Journal (November, 1935). From the time it was newly built, Woods lived with his wife in the same Toronto apartment. Long-standing residents of the building reported that the apartment became a repository for a huge body of his work. Woods's obituary was published in the Toronto Star on 19 November 1987.Online link to the Toronto Star archive given below. Jeanne died in 1996 without heirs or successors; much of Woods's material came as a gift from her estate to the Royal Ontario Museum. Woods's style was instantly recognizable in his own time and his work was widely circulated in almost every part of Canada. After he ceased to be active, however, Woods fell into virtual oblivion. In recent years there has been a revival of interest in Woods and his imagery. An untitled display, with few interpretive panels, appeared at the Royal Ontario Museum in the winter of 2009‚Äì10, and comprised 17 works, chiefly Canadian Home Journal cover art. Collections and archives The main collection of Rex Woods material is held in the Royal Ontario Museum with key pieces illustrated in ROM Images, the museum's online collection service.http://images.rom.on.ca/public/index.php?function=query&action;=smpl&keywords;=%22Rex%20Woods%22 However the archive, which is extensive and includes photographs, documents and other works, has not been catalogued and is not accessible to the public or specialist researchers.

German South West Africa was a German colony in Africa, established in 1884 with the protection of the area around L√ºderitz and abandoned during World War I, when the area was taken over by the British. The postal history of the colony started on 7 July 1888 at Otjimbingwe, when the regular postal service began using German postage stamps and postmarks reading OTYIMBINGUE. The service continued in this fashion for a number of years, eventually expanding to additional post offices in Windhoek (1891) and Swakopmund (1895). First stamps The first stamp issue for the colony consisted of overprints applied to German stamps in May 1897, reading \\"Deutsch- / S√ºdwest-Afrika\\" at an angle. On 15 November 1898, the overprint was changed to \\"Deutsch- / S√ºdwestafrika\\" dropping the hyphen. Yacht issue In 1900, the omnibus Yacht issue included stamps for South West Africa, printed on watermarked paper after 1906. The last of these was a 3 Mark value, printed in 1919, but never put on sale in the colony. Some values, such as the 3 and 5 Pfennig Yachts, are readily available today, with prices of around US$1. The others range up to several hundred dollars. The high values of the watermarked Yachts saw very little usage before the colony was captured, and genuinely used stamps are up to 10 times more valuable; but many of the used stamps are known to have forged cancellations.

Life and work Sayyid Ahmed Gailani's family are descended from Abdul-Qadir Gilani, the founder of the Qadiriyyah. His father, Sayyid Hasan Gailani, was born in Baghdad before moving to Afghanistan in 1905 in order to establish the Qadiriyyah order in that country. Amir Habibullah Khan gave him land in Kabul and eastern Nangarhar Province.Edwards, p.255 Ahmed Gailani was born in the Surkh-R≈çd District of eastern Nangarhar Province of Afghanistan, where he remains a significant figure. He studied at Abu Hanifa College in Kabul, before graduating at the Faculty of Theology of Kabul University in 1960. In 1952, he reinforced his family's close ties to the Afghan royal family by marrying Adela, a granddaughter of Amir Habibullah. Prior to the war, Gailani invested more time in his business career than in the leadership of his Sufi tariqah, often travelling to France and England. Through his connection with the monarchy, he was able to obtain the Peugeot dealership in Kabul. In 1979, after the communist PDPA had come to power, Pir Gailani fled to Pakistan where he created the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan, a moderate royalist faction. This party was one of the seven used by the Pakistani ISI for distributing CIA-funded weapons to the mujahideen fighting the Soviet occupation. NIFA had the most liberal stance of all the Peshawar parties, and it supported the return of King Zahir Shah from exile. Representing the interests of the pre-war Pashtun establishment, it rejected both communism and Islamism, in favour of \\"nationalism and democracy.\\" Gailani's constituency was drawn from the following of the Qadiryyah, and his group functioned like a Sufi order, greatly hampering its efficiency as a political and military organisation. The followers of the pir always expected to interact with him personally, which meant that the party functioned like a court, centered on Gailani and his children, rather than like a modern party. No decision was ever delegated. The quantity of weapons a NIFA mujahideen commander could expect to receive depended mostly on his personal relation with the pir. Also the pir's tradition of generosity led to many abuses, with many party officials receiving essentially fictitious posts through personal contacts.Edwards, p.274 Despite this, NIFA remained the most popular party among the Afghan refugees living in Pakistan. A poll carried out in 1987 revealed that 456 refugees out of a sample of 2,000 supported NIFA, which was the highest score of any of the mujahideen parties. By contrast, the Pakistanis, judging the group inefficient allocated NIFA only 10-11 percent of the weapons procured by the CIA, with a much larger share going to Islamist groups, in particular Hekmatyar's Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin. However, the sample of this survey has been noted as suspect, since it mostly included \\"educated\\" refugees and thereby ignored the many refugees that were illiterate or poor. The educated class was more favourable towards Zahir and thereby NIFA. (Citation, Gilles Dorronsoro, Revolution Unending, 2005). Outside of the ISI Gailani had few links with foreign patrons (unlike the Islamists who had ties in the Arab world), but he did receive some support from American conservative lobbying groups such as the Committee for a Free Afghanistan, an emanation of the Heritage Foundation, and Freedom House.Rubin, p.210 He was also associated with Lord Bethell of the London-based Radio Free Kabul. In October 2001, Pir Ahmed Gailani headed a group of Afghan leaders, the Assembly for Peace and National Unity of Afghanistan, which attempted to win over moderate elements in the Taliban.

Born in Santos, S√£o Paulo, Rhael grew up listening to Brazilian funk. Inspired by Valesca Popozuda and Tati Quebra- Barraco, in 2014, Rhael became the drag queen \\"Lia Clark\\", working as DJ known to play funk. Two years later, the artist came to prominence as a singer after the release of \\"Trava Trava\\". A hit on Spotify and YouTube, it led to a national tour and to the release of the extended play (EP) Clark Boom in 2016. In the following year, the EP spawned hits like \\"Chifrudo\\", \\"TOME CUrtindo\\" and \\"Boquet√°xi\\". The first two marked collaborations with trans singer and drag queen Pabllo Vittar respectively, while the latter was involved in a polemic when its YouTube video was restricted because of alleged improper sexual content. During 2018, Clark's singles \\"Tipo de Garota\\", \\"Q.M.T.\\" and \\"Bumbum no Ar\\" anticipated the release of the album, √â da Pista. The latter song gained notoriety because of the partnership with Wanessa Camargo and its politically motivated music video. Biography=1992‚Äì2015: Early life and musical influences Rhael Lima de Oliveira was born on February 15, 1992, in Santos, S√£o Paulo. Clark, who identifies as gender fluid, was \\"effeminate kid\\" who was bullied and felt bad for this. Without positive LGBT role models as a child, \\"I felt I was somehow wrong and I struggled a lot to understand that I was normal too\\". The singer grew up in Macuco, a suburban neighborhood where Brazilian funk could be frequently listened, becoming a fan of Valesca Popozuda and Tati Quebra-Barraco. In addition to national singers, the artist was highly influenced by Britney Spears and Nicki Minaj. In 2014, Clark was studying production engineering and working on a company of importation and exportation but was not satisfied with it. In the same year, Clark started to work as a DJ; already under the alias of \\"Lia Clark\\", the artist became known as \\"the drag who plays funk\\". After leaving the course in the following year, Clark started to think about recording funk songs. 2016‚Äì2017: \\"Trava Trava\\" and Clark Boom Clark started a career as a singer in 2016 by releasing the single \\"Trava Trava\\" in February. Before its official release, Clark took the song to play on dance clubs of S√£o Paulo. Produced by Pedrowl with a remix of Azealia Banks' \\"Chasing Time\\" and a sample of Anitta's \\"Show das Poderosas\\", the song became a hit. It reached the second place in Spotify's viral chart and its YouTube video, directed by Gabriel Riccieri, reached 30,000 views on the first day. Because of the song's success, Clark went on a national tour. Despite the success and in spite of criticism on the singer's vocals, Clark declared, \\"Since the beginning of my career, I always said that I'm not a singer. I'm someone making music for people to have fun\\". The artist's focus was to create music \\"for people to have fun and dance in the clubs and at the concerts\\". In September 2016, Clark released the single and music video \\"Clark Boom\\" (directed by Alexandre Mort√°gua); with lyrics written by Banda U√≥'s Mateus Carrilho and a sample of \\"Rap das Armas\\", the song announced the release of an extended play (EP). In the same month, the seven-track Clark Boom was released; produced by Pedrowl with lyrics by Clark, Pedrowl and Carrilho, among the songs were \\"Chifrudo\\" (featuring Mulher Pepita), \\"TOME CUrtindo\\" and \\"Boquet√°xi\\". In December 2016, Clark released the Christmas- themed single \\"Ceia (Vem Pap√° Noel)\\". Later, the Brazilian counterpart of MTV choose Clark among the ten best new artists of the year. In January 2017, Clark released the music video for \\"Chifrudo\\", and it became one of the hits of that year Carnival. The success of the clip, directed by Riccieri, led to a partnership with Avon that created the Carnival parade \\"Baile de Boneca\\". In May, Clark was featured in the music video of Ludmilla's \\"Cheguei\\" as a friend of the singer in the Mean Girls-inspired video. Some days later, Clark released a lyric video of a remixed version of \\"TOME CUrtindo\\"; sampling Nicki Minaj and Beyonc√©'s \\"Feeling Myself\\", the new version featured Pabllo Vittar and was produced by DJ Brabo. The video, that got 180,00 views in the day of its release, featured 3D scans of the singers along with the lyrics on programming language and, according to director Rodrigo de Oliveira, mixed the aesthetics of The Matrix, Ghost in the Shell and Westworld. In the following July, the singer released \\"Boquet√°xi\\" on YouTube; featuring a sample of Ang√©lica's \\"Vou de T√°xi\\", it became a trending topic on Twitter the day of its release. In the video, directed by Riccieri, Clark uses costumes inspired by Christina Aguilera's \\"Dirrty\\". On the following day, however, the video was classified as \\"restricted\\" after users' complaints of its sexual nature. Clark deemed it a homophobic action as there is no such restriction for other funk artists with equally sexually explicit lyrics. Later, the video was definitely removed from YouTube; as a new, \\"2.0\\" version without the reference to Ang√©lica's song was released in October, media speculated it was a copyrights issue. 2017‚Äìpresent: √â da Pista In September 2017, Clark announced to be working on a debut album and that it was already on pre-production. In December of that year, Clark was featured along with Tati Quebra-Barraco in the music video for \\"Berro\\", a song by Heavy Baile. In January 2018, Clark released the music video for \\"Tipo de Garota\\", which was also the first single for the upcoming album. The video, directed by Rodrigo de Carvalho, featured fans invited to attend the recording in a S√£o Paulo bar and a reference to the restriction of the artist's previous videos. In April, Clark released a new single, \\"Q.M.T.\\", which was produced by Heavy Baile and whose music video, released in May, was directed by Os Primos. The piece was inspired by Britney Spears' 2000s videos, especially the one for \\"Womanizer\\", and also by Quentin Tarantino's film Kill Bill. In September, Clark released \\"Bumbum no Ar\\", a song featuring pop singer Wanessa Camargo, and whose music video was a political statement against Jair Bolsonaro's presidential campaign. The video features the two singers as hit women who try to kill a presidential candidate with a background of actions against the LGBTQ community, racial minorities and women. Although it was the director Felipe Sassi's idea, Clark embraced it \\"since I am one of the people who is being silenced in this political process\\". Moreover, the singer affirmed it was the role of every artist, \\"especially the ones whose audience is the LGBTQ community and those who come from a working-class background\\", to use their image to spread \\"kindness, love and respect\\". In November 2018, Clark released the ten-track album √â da Pista. To promote the album, \\"Tu Aguenta\\", featuring DJ Thai, was released as a single and another music video directed by Riccieri was produced for the song.

What distinguishes a knowledge commons from a commons of shared physical resources is that digital resources are non-subtractible; that is, multiple users can access the same digital resources with no effect on their quantity or quality.  Conceptual background  The term 'commons' is derived from the medieval economic system the commons. The knowledge commons is a model for a number of domains, including Open Educational Resources such as the MIT OpenCourseWare, free digital media such as Wikipedia, Creative Commons‚Äìlicensed art, open-source research,Joshua M. Pearce, \\"Open Source Research in Sustainability\\", Sustainability: the Journal of Record, 5(4), pp. 238-243, 2012. DOI free and open access and open scientific collections such as the Public Library of Science or the Science Commons, free software and Open Design. According to research by Charlotte Hess and Elinor Ostrom, the conceptual background of the knowledge commons encompasses two intellectual histories: first, a European tradition of battling the enclosure of the \\"intangible commons of the mind\\", threatened by expanding intellectual property rights and privatization of knowledge. Second, a tradition rooted in the United States, which sees the knowledge commons as a shared space allowing for free speech and democratic practices, and which is in the tradition of the town commons movement and commons-based production of scholarly work, open science, open libraries, and collective action. The production of works in the knowledge commons is often driven by collective intelligence respectively the wisdom of crowds and is related to knowledge communism as it was defined by Robert K. Merton, according to whom scientists give up intellectual property rights in exchange for recognition and esteem. Ferenc Gyuris argues, that it is important to distinguish \\"information\\" from \\"knowledge\\" in defining the term \\"knowledge commons\\". He argues that \\"knowledge as a shared resource\\" requires that both information must become accessible and potential recipients must become able and willing to internalize it as 'knowledge'. \\"Therefore, knowledge cannot become a shared resource without a complex set of institutions and practices that give the opportunity to potential recipients to gain the necessary abilities and willingness\\".  Copyleft  Copyleft licenses are institutions which support a knowledge commons of executable software. Copyleft licenses grant licensees all necessary rights such as right to study, use, change and redistribute‚Äîunder the condition that all future works building on the license are again kept in the commons. Popular applications of the 'copyleft' principle are the GNU Software Licenses (GPL, LGPL and GFDL by Free Software Foundation) and the share-alike licenses under creative commons.

Generally a player may begin playing a CCG with a pre- made starter deck, and then customize their deck with a random assortment of cards acquired through booster packs, or from trading with other players, building up their own library of cards. As a player obtains more cards, they may create new decks from scratch from their library. Players are challenged to construct a deck within limits set by the CCG's rules that will allow them to outlast decks constructed by other players. Games are commonly played between two players, though multiplayer formats are also common. Gameplay in CCG is typically turn-based, with each player starting with a shuffled deck and on their turn, drawing and playing cards to attack the other player and reduce their health points to zero before their opponent can do the same to them. Dice, counters, card sleeves, or play mats are used to complement gameplay. CCG tournaments exist for expert players to compete for prizes. CCGs are typically themed around fantasy or science fiction genres, and have also included horror themes, cartoons, and sports, and may include licensed intellectual properties. Cards in CCGs are specially designed sets of playing cards. Each card within the CCG represent an element of that theme geared towards the gameplay of the CCG, and can fall in categories such as creatures, enhancements, events, resources, and locations. All cards within the CCG typically share the same common backside art, while the front has a combination of proprietary artwork or images to embellish the card along with instructions and flavor text for the card. Expansion sets are used to extend CCGs, introducing new gameplay strategies and narrative lore through new cards in starter decks and booster packs. Successful CCGs typically have thousands of unique cards through multiple expansions; Magic: The Gathering, initially launched with 300 unique cards, has accumulated more than 20,000 cards through such expansions . The first CCG, Magic: The Gathering, was developed by Richard Garfield and published by Wizards of the Coast in 1993 and its initial runs rapidly sold out that year. By the end of 1994, Magic: The Gathering had sold over 1 billion cards, and during its most popular period, between 2008 and 2016, it had sold over 20 billion cards. Magic: The Gatherings early success led other game publishers to follow suit with their own CCGs in the following years. Other successful CCGs include Yu-Gi-Oh! which sold over 25 billion cards as of March 2011, and Pok√©mon which has sold over 28.8 billion cards as of September 2019. Other notable CCGs have come and gone, including Legend of the Five Rings, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Vampire: The Eternal Struggle, and World of Warcraft. Many other CCGs were produced but had little or no commercial success. Recently, digital collectible card games (DCCGs) have gained popularity, spurred by the success of online version of CCGs like Magic: The Gathering Online, and wholly digital CCGs like Hearthstone. CCGs further have influenced other card game genres, including deck-building games like Dominion, and \\"Living card games\\" developed by Fantasy Flight Games.  Overview  A collectible card game (CCG) is generally defined as a game where players acquire cards into a personal collection from which they create customized decks of cards and challenge other players in matches. Players usually start by purchasing a starter deck that is ready to play, but additional cards are obtained from randomized booster packs or by trading with other players. The goal of most CCGs is to beat one's opponent by crafting customized decks that play to synergies of card combinations. Refined decks will try to account for randomness created by the initial shuffling of the deck, as well as opponent's actions, by using complementary and preferably efficient cards. The exact definition of what makes a CCG is varied, as many games are marketed under the \\"collectible card game\\" moniker. The basic definition requires the game to resemble trading cards in shape and function, be mass-produced for trading and/or collectibility, and have rules for strategic gameplay. The definition of CCGs is further refined as being a card game in which the player uses his own deck with cards primarily sold in random assortments. If every card in the game can be obtained by making a small number of purchases, or if the manufacturer does not market it as a CCG, then it is not a CCG. CCGs can further be designated as living or dead games. Dead games are those CCGs which are no longer supported by their manufacturers and have ceased releasing expansions. Living games are those CCGs which continue to be published by their manufacturers. Usually this means that new expansions are being created for the game and official game tournaments are occurring in some fashion. Customized Card games that should not be mistaken for CCGs: *Deck-Building Games - Games like Dominion where construction of the player's deck in the midst of the game is the main focus. Deck-building games ship with all the cards required to play, and may offer expansions with fixed contents to add more variety to play. Dominion, the first such deck-building game, was directly inspired by Magic: The Gathering and thus have similar concepts. *Collectible Common-Deck Card Games - Games like Munchkin where players share a common deck to draw from, expandable through fixed-content expansions and boosters, rather than their own personal deck. Consequently, no customization of decks, trading, or Metagaming occurs, and there is little interest in individual collection of the cards. *Non-Collectible Customizable Card Games - Games like Android: Netrunner where each player selects one of multiple pre- made decks packaged with the game, eliminating randomness while acquiring the cards. However, after more non-random expansion packs are purchased, players can customize their decks according to certain deckbuilding rules, allowing for much exploration of the game's themes and mechanics. Each deck typically represents a different character and their skills, items, and weaknesses. Some games of this type are Expandable Card Game (ECG) that allow the game to be expand with additional pre-made decks. ** Living Card Games (LCGs) - Non- collectible customizable card games like The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game where players select a pre-deck that comes with the game or through expansions, but will start the game using only a subset of these cards. As the game proceeds, the player will add, remove, and swap cards with those from the selected deck not in play, commonly representing character growth, equipment gains, or other \\"permanent\\" changes, hence the \\"living\\" factor in these games. \\"Living Card Game\\" is a registered trademark of Fantasy Flight Games who are generally associated as the main publisher of these types of games. LCGs do not use the randomized booster packs like CCGs and instead are bought in a single purchase or fixed-set expansions, and are generally marketed for costing much less than collectibles. Many CCGs have also been remade into digital collectible card games (DCCGs), taking advantage of the wide availability of the Internet for online play as well as for the potential of computerized opponents. DCCGs can exist as online counterparts of existing CCGs, such as Magic: The Gathering Online for Magic: the Gathering, as wholly original card games that take advantage of the digital space, such as Hearthstone, or in many other forms. Gameplay mechanics Players engaged in a game of Magic: The Gathering with sleeved cards Each CCG system has a fundamental set of rules that describes the players' objectives, the categories of cards used in the game, and the basic rules by which the cards interact. Each card will have additional text explaining that specific card's effect on the game. Many games utilize a set of keywords to simplify the card text, with keywords referring to common gameplay rules. For example, Magic: The Gathering has about 25 common keywords such as \\"flying\\", meaning the creature can only be blocked by other creatures with flying. Each card also generally represent some specific element derived from the game's genre, setting, or source material. The cards are illustrated and named for these source elements, and the card's game function may relate to the subject. For example, Magic: The Gathering is based on the fantasy genre, so many of the cards represent creatures and magical spells from that setting. In the game, a dragon is illustrated as a reptilian beast, has higher stats than smaller creatures, and has the forementioned \\"flying\\" keyword. Flavor text on cards is frequently used to provide narrative for story-driven games or sometimes as humorous asides. The bulk of CCGs are designed around a resource system by which the pace of each game is controlled. Frequently, the cards which constitute a player's deck are considered a resource, with the frequency of cards moving from the deck to the play area or player's hand being tightly controlled. Relative card strength is often balanced by the number or type of resources needed in order to play the card, and pacing after that may be determined by the flow of cards moving in and out of play. Resources may be specific cards themselves, or represented by other means (e.g. tokens in various resource pools, symbols on cards, etc.). Unlike traditional card games such as poker or crazy eights in which a deck's content is limited and pre- determined, players select which cards will compose their deck from any available cards printed for the game. This allows a CCG player to strategically customize their deck to take advantage of favorable card interactions, combinations and statistics. While a player's deck can theoretically be of any size, a deck of fortyfive or sixty cards is considered the optimal size, for reasons of playability, and has been adopted by most CCGs as an arbitrary 'standard' deck size. Deck construction may also be controlled by the game's rules. Some games, such as Magic: the Gathering, limit how many copies of a particular card can be included in a deck; such limits force players to think creatively when choosing cards and deciding on a playing strategy. Cards in CCGs come in several broad categories. Common categories, in addition to the aforementioned resource cards, include creatures that are summoned into battle who attack the opposing player and block their creatures' attacks, enchantments that buff or debuff these creatures' attributes and abilities, events like magic spells that may have immediate or ongoing resolution to one or more cards in play, and locations or story cards that present specific conditions impacting all actions. Each match of a CCG is generally one-on-one with another opponent, but many CCGs have variants for more players. Typically, the goal of a match is to play cards that reduce the opponent's life total to zero before the opponent can do the same. Some CCGs provide for a match to end if a player has no more cards in their deck to draw. After determining which player goes first by coin flip or other means, players start by shuffling their decks and drawing an initial hand, with many CCG's allowing for a player to take a mulligan on this if they do not believe their starting hand is good. Players then take turns, and while the turn format is wildly different depending on the CCG, typically is broken into distinct phases of resetting all of their resources so they may be used that turn, drawing a card, playing any number of cards by drawing from available resources, making one or more attacks on the opponent, and then a cleanup step including discarding cards to reach a maximum hand size, if necessary. Many CCGs have rules where opposing players can react to the current player's turn; an example is casting a counter-spell to an opponent's spell to cancel it such as in Magic: The Gathering. Games with such reaction systems typically define rules to determine priority of reactions as to avoid potential conflicts between card interpretations. Other CCGs do not have such direct reaction systems, but allow players to cast face-down cards or \\"traps\\" that automatically trigger based on actions of the opposing player. Distribution Specific game cards are most often produced in various degrees of scarcity, generally denoted as fixed (F), common (C), uncommon (U), and rare (R). Some games use alternate or additional designations for the relative rarity levels, such as super-, ultra-, mythic- or exclusive rares. Special cards may also only be available through promotions, events, purchase of related material, or redemption programs. The idea of rarity borrows somewhat from other types of collectible cards, such as baseball cards, but in CCGs, the level of rarity also denotes the significance of a card's effect in the game, i.e., the more powerful a card is in terms of the game, the greater its rarity. A powerful card whose effects were underestimated by the game's designers may increase in rarity in later reprints. Such a card might even be removed entirely from the next edition, to further limit its availability and its effect on gameplay. Most collectible card games are distributed as sealed packs containing a subset of the available cards, much like trading cards. The most common distribution methods are: * Starter deck ‚Äî An introductory deck that contains enough cards for one player. It may contain random or a pre- determined selection of cards. * Starter set ‚Äî An introductory product that contains enough cards for two players. The card selection is usually pre- determined and non-random. * Theme deck or Tournament deck ‚Äî Most CCGs are designed with opposing factions, themes, or strategies. A theme deck is composed of pre-determined cards that fit these motifs. * Booster packs ‚Äî The most common distribution method. Booster packs for CCGs usually contain 8 to 15 cards, usually with an assured number of cards of specific rarities, but otherwise randomly packaged. Because of the rarity distribution of cards, many popular CCGs have a secondary marketplace, with players buying and selling cards based on perceived value. Many purchases are made to acquire rarer cards to help build competitive decks, while others are just for collection purposes. In some cases, early cards in a CCGs run or which have been banned from play can become of high value to collectors such as Magic: The Gatherings Power Nine. History=Early history (Pre-1990s) Allegheny's prototype of The Baseball Card Game from 1904, a precursor to the CCG that was never released Regular card games have been around since at least the 1300s. The Base Ball Card Game, a prototype from 1904, is a notable precursor to CCGs because it had a few similar qualities but it never saw production to qualify it as a collectible card game. It is not known if the game was intended to be a standalone product or something altogether different like Top Trumps. The game consisted of a limited 112 cards and never saw manufacture past the marketing stage. Early Batter-Up Baseball deck, c. 1949, with instruction sheet/diamond diagram The first pre-CCG to make it to market was the Baseball Card Game, released by Topps in 1951 as an apparent followup to a game from 1947 called Batter Up Baseball by Ed-u-Cards Corp. Players created teams of hitters, represented by cards, and moved them around a baseball diamond according to cards representing baseball plays drawn from a randomized deck. Like modern CCGs, the game cards for Topps' Baseball Card Game were sold in randomized packs and were collectible, but unlike them, the game itself required no strategic play. Interaction between the two players was limited to who scored the most points and was otherwise a solitaire-like function since players could not play simultaneously. Other notable entries that resemble and predate the CCG are Strat-O-Matic, Nuclear War, BattleCards, and Illuminati. Allen Varney of Dragon Magazine claimed the designer of Cosmic Encounter, published in 1979, Peter Olotka, spoke of the idea of designing a collectible card game as early as 1979.  Magic: The Gathering and CCG craze (1990‚Äì1995) Richard Garfield (pictured in 2014) designed Magic: The Gathering taking elements from the board game Cosmic Encounter. The game was released in 1993 Prior to the advent of the CCG, the market for alternative games was dominated by role-playing games (RPG), in particular Dungeons & Dragons by TSR. Wizards of the Coast (Wizards), a new company formed in Peter Adkison's basement in 1990, was looking to enter the RPG market with its series called The Primal Order which converted characters to other RPG series. After a lawsuit from Palladium Books which could have financially ruined the company, Wizards acquired another RPG called Talislanta. This was after Lisa Stevens joined the company in 1991 as vice president after having left White Wolf. Through their mutual friend Mike Davis, Adkison met Richard Garfield who at the time was a doctoral student. Garfield and Davis had an idea for a game called RoboRally and pitched the idea to Wizards of the Coast in 1991, but Wizards did not have the resources to manufacture it and instead challenged Garfield to make a game that would pay for the creation of RoboRally. This game would require minimal resources to make and only about 15‚Äì20 minutes to play. In December 1991, Garfield had a prototype for a game called Mana Clash, and by 1993 he established Garfield Games to attract publishers and to get a larger share of the company should it become successful. When designing Magic: The Gathering, Garfield borrowed elements from the board game Cosmic Encounter which also used cards for game play. In 1993 a \\"new kind of card game\\" appeared. It was different because the player could not buy all the cards at once. Players would first buy starter decks and then later be encouraged to buy booster packs to expand their selection of cards. What emerged was a card game that players collected and treasured but also played with. The first collectible card game created was Magic: The Gathering, invented by Richard Garfield, and patented by Wizards of the Coast in 1993. The game has remained popular, with Wizards of the Coast claiming it to be the most widely played CCG as of 2009. It was based on Garfield's game Five Magics from 1982. Originally, Mana Clash was designed with Wizards in mind, but the suit between Palladium Books and Wizards was still not settled. Investment money was eventually secured from Wizards and the name Mana Clash was changed to Magic: The Gathering. The ads for it first appeared in Cryptych, a magazine that focused on RPGs. On the July 4th weekend of 1993, the game premiered at the Origins Game Fair in Fort Worth, Texas. In the following month of August, the game's Limited core set was released (also known as Alpha) and sold out its initial print run of 2.6 million cards immediately creating more demand. Wizards quickly released a second print run called Beta (7.3 million card print run) and then a second core set called Unlimited (35 million card print run) in an attempt to satisfy orders as well as to fix small errors in the game. December also saw the release of the first expansion called Arabian Nights. With Magic: The Gathering still the only CCG on the market, it released another expansion called Antiquities which experienced collation problems. Another core set iteration named Revised was released shortly after that. Demand was still not satiated as the game grew by leaps and bounds. Legends was released in mid-1994 and no end was in sight for the excitement over the new CCG. What followed was the CCG craze. Magic was so popular that game stores could not keep it on their shelves. More and more orders came for the product, and as other game makers looked on they realized that they had to capitalize on this new fad. The first to do so was TSR who rushed their own game Spellfire into production and was released in June 1994. Through this period of time, Magic was hard to obtain because production never met the demand. Store owners placed large inflated orders in an attempt to circumvent allocations placed by distributors. This practice would eventually catch up to them when printing capacity met demand coinciding with the expansion of Fallen Empires released in November 1994. Combined with the releases of 9 other CCGs, among them Galactic Empires, Decipher's Star Trek, On the Edge, and Super Deck!. Steve Jackson Games, which was heavily involved in the alternative game market, looked to tap into the new CCG market and figured the best way was to adapt their existing Illuminati game. The result was Illuminati: New World Order which followed with two expansions in 1995 and 1998. Another entry by Wizards of the Coast was Jyhad. The game sold well, but not nearly as well as Magic, however it was considered a great competitive move by Wizard as Jyhad was based on one of the most popular intellectual properties in the alternative game market which kept White Wolf from aggressively competing with Magic. By this time however, it may have been a moot point as the CCG Market had hit its first obstacle: too much product. The overprinted expansion of Magic's Fallen Empires threatened to upset the relationship that Wizards had with its distributors as many complained of getting too much product, despite their original over-ordering practices. In early 1995, the GAMA Trade Show previewed upcoming games for the year. One out of every three games announced at the show was a CCG. Publishers other than game makers were now entering the CCG market such as Donruss, Upper Deck, Fleer, Topps, Comic Images, and others. The CCG bubble appeared to be on everyone's mind. Too many CCGs were being released and not enough players existed to meet the demand. In 1995 alone, 38 CCGs entered the market, among them the most notable being Doomtrooper, Middle-earth, OverPower, Rage, Shadowfist, Legend of the Five Rings, and SimCity. Jyhad saw a makeover and was renamed as Vampire: The Eternal Struggle to distance itself from the Islamic term jihad as well as to get closer to the source material. The Star Trek CCG from Decipher was almost terminated after disputes with Paramount announced that the series would end in 1997. But by the end of the year, the situation was resolved and Decipher regained the license to the Star Trek franchise along with Deep Space Nine, Voyager and the movie First Contact. Enthusiasm from manufacturers was very high, but by the summer of 1995 at Gen Con, retailers had noticed CCG sales were lagging. The Magic expansion Chronicles released in November and was essentially a compilation of older sets. It was maligned by collectors and they claimed it devalued their collections. Besides this aspect, the market was still reeling from too much product as Fallen Empires still sat on shelves alongside newer Magic expansions like Ice Age. The one new CCG that retailers were hoping to save their sales, Star Wars, wasn't released until very late in December. By then, Wizards of the Coast, the lead seller in the CCG market had announced a downsizing in their company and it was followed by a layoff of over 30 jobs. The excess product and lag in sales also coincided with an 8-month-long gap in between Magic: The Gathering's expansions, the longest in its history. In Hungary, Power Cards Card Game, or HKK, was released in 1995 and was inspired by Magic: The Gathering. HKK was later released in the Czech Republic. HKK is still being made.  Wizards of the Coast domination (1996‚Äì1999)  Stabilization and consolidation (1996‚Äì1997) = Dragon Dice was one of the attempts at a collectible dice game in the 90s In early 1996, the CCG market was still reeling from its recent failures and glut of product, including the release of Wizards' expansion Homelands which was rated as the worst Magic expansion to date. The next two years would mark a \\"cool off\\" period for the over-saturated CCG market. Additionally, manufacturers slowly came to understand that having a CCG was not enough to keep it alive. They also had to support organized players through tournaments. Combined with a new dichotomy between collectors and players especially among Magic players, more emphasis was placed on the game rather than the collectibility of the cards. Plenty more CCGs were introduced in 1996, chief among them were BattleTech, The X-Files, Mythos, and Wizard's very own Netrunner. Many established CCGs were in full swing releasing expansions every few months, but even by this time, many CCGs from only two years ago had already died. TSR had ceased production of Spellfire and attempted another collectible game called Dragon Dice which failed shortly after being released. On June 3 of 1997, Wizards of the Coast announced that it had acquired TSR and its Dungeons & Dragons property which also gave them control of Gen Con. Wizards now had its long sought role-playing game, and it quickly discontinued all plans to continue producing Dragon Dice as well as any hopes of resuming production of the Spellfire CCG. Decipher was now sanctioning tournaments for their Star Trek and Star Wars games. Star Wars was also enjoying strong success from the recently rereleased Star Wars Special Edition films. In fact, the CCG would remain the second best selling CCG until the introduction of Pok√©mon in 1999. Wizards continued acquiring properties and bought Five Rings Publishing Group, Inc., creators of the Legend of the Five Rings CCG, Star Trek: The Next Generation collectible dice game, and the soon to be released Dune CCG, on June 26. Wizards also acquired Andon Unlimited which by association gave them control over the Origins Convention. By September, Wizards was awarded a patent for its \\"Trading Card Game.\\" Later in October, Wizards announced that it would seek royalty payments from other CCG companies. Allegedly, only Harper Prism announced its intention to pay these royalties for its game Imajica. Other CCGs acknowledged the patent on their packaging. 1997 saw a slow down in the release of new CCG games. Only 7 new games came out, among them: Dune: Eye of the Storm, Babylon 5, 'Shadowrun', Imajica and Aliens/Predator. Babylon 5 saw moderate success for a few years before its publisher Precedence succumbed to a nonrenewal of its license later on in 2001. Also in 1997, Vampire: The Eternal Struggle ceased production. However, Wizards of the Coast attempted to enter a more mainstream market with the release of a watered-down version of Magic, called Portal. Its creation is considered a failure along with its follow up Portal Second Age released in 1998. = Wizards of the Coast dominates, Hasbro steps in (1998‚Äì1999) = A collection of Pok√©mon and Yu-Gi-Oh! cards By February 1998, one out of every two CCGs sold was Magic: the Gathering. Only 7 new CCGs were introduced that year, all but two being Wizards of the Coast product. C-23, Doomtown, Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Legend of the Burning Sands and Xena: Warrior Princess were those five, and only Doomtown met with better than average reviews before its run was terminated and the rights returned to Alderac. C-23, Hercules, and Xena were all a part of a new simplified CCG system Wizards had created for beginners. Called the ARC System, it had four distinct types of cards: Resource, Character, Combat, and Action. The system also utilized the popular \\"tapping\\" mechanic of Magic: The Gathering. This system was abandoned shortly afterwards. Despite limited success or no success at all in the rest of the CCG market, Magic had recovered and Wizards learned from its lessons of 1995 and early 1996. Players still enjoyed the game and were gobbling up its latest expansions of Tempest, Stronghold, Exodus and by year's end, Urza's Saga which added new enthusiasm to Magic's fanbase in light of some of the cards being \\"too powerful.\\" In early 1999, Wizards released the English-language version of the Pok√©mon TCG to the mass market (the original Japanese version of the game having been released by Media Factory in 1996). The game benefited from the Pok√©mon fad also of that year. At first there wasn't enough product to meet demand. Some retailers perceived the shortage to be, in part, related to Wizards's recent purchase of the Game Keeper stores where it was assumed they received Pok√©mon shipments more often than non- affiliated stores. By the summer of 1999, the Pok√©mon TCG became the first CCG to outsell Magic: The Gathering. The success of Pok√©mon brought renewed interest to the CCG market and many new companies began pursuing this established customer base. Large retail stores such as Walmart and Target began carrying CCGs and by the end of September, Hasbro was convinced on its profitability and bought Wizards of the Coast for $325 million. A small selection of new CCGs also arrived in 1999, among them Young Jedi, Tomb Raider, Austin Powers, 7th Sea and The Wheel of Time.  Franchising (2000- 2002) Transitions and refining of the market (2000)= By 2000, the ups and downs of the CCG market were familiar to its retailers. They foresaw Pok√©mon's inevitable fall from grace as the fad reached its peak in April of that year. The panic associated with the overflooding of the CCGs from 1995 and 1996 was absent and the retailers withstood the crash of Pok√©mon. Yet CCGs benefited from the popularity of Pok√©mon and they saw an uptick in the number of CCGs released and an overall increased interest in the genre. Pok√©mon's mainstream success in the CCG world also highlighted an increasing trend of CCGs being marketed with existing intellectual properties, especially those with an existing television show, such as a cartoon. New CCGs introduced in 2000 included notable entries in Sailor Moon, The Terminator, Digi-Battle, Dragon Ball Z Collectible Card Game, Magi-Nation and X-Men. Vampires: The Eternal Struggle resumed production in 2000 after White Wolf regained full rights and released the first new expansion in three years called Sabbat War. Wizards of the Coast introduced a new sports CCG called MLB Showdown as well. Decipher released its final chronological expansion of the original Star Wars trilogy called Death Star II and would continue to see a loss in sales as interest waned in succeeding expansions, and their Star Wars license was not being renewed. Mage Knight was also released this year and would seek to challenge the CCG market by introducing miniatures into the mix. Though not technically a CCG, it would target the same player base for sales. The real shake up in the industry however, came when Hasbro laid off more than 100 workers at Wizards of the Coast and ended its attempts at an online version of the game when it sold off their interactive division. Coinciding with this turn of events was Peter Adkisson's decision to resign and Lisa Stevens whose job ended when The Duelist magazine (published by Wizards of the Coast) was cancelled by the parent company. With Adkisson went Wizards' acquirement of Gen Con and the Origins Convention went to GAMA. Hasbro also ceased production of Legends of the Five Rings in 2000 and it resumed production when it was sold to Alderac in 2001. = Franchise trends continue (2001‚Äì2002) = As seen in 2000, the years 2001 and 2002 continued on with the CCG market being less likely to take chances on new and original intellectual properties, but instead it would invest in CCGs that were based on existing franchises. Cartoons, movies, television, and books influenced the creation of such CCGs as Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, A Game of Thrones, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Yu-Gi-Oh! and two Star Wars CCGs: Jedi Knights and a rebooted Star Wars TCG, by Decipher and Wizards of the Coast. They followed the demise of the original Star Wars CCG by Decipher in December of 2001, but they would see very little interest and eventually the two games were cancelled. Other niche CCGs were also made, including Warlord and Warhammer 40,000. Upper Deck had its first hit with Yu-Gi-Oh! The game was known to be popular in Japan but until 2002 had not been released in the United States. The game was mostly distributed to big retailers, with hobby stores added to their distribution afterwards. By the end of 2002, the game was the top CCG even though it was no where near the phenomenon that Pok√©mon was. The card publisher Precedence produced a new CCG in 2001 based on the Rifts RPG by Palladium. Rifts had top of the line artwork but the size of the starter deck was similar in size to the RPG books. Precedence's other main CCG Babylon 5 ended its decent run in 2001 after the company lost its license. The game was terminated and the publisher later folded in 2002. The release of The Lord of the Rings CCG marked the release of the 100th new CCG since 1993, and 2002 also marked the release of the 500th CCG expansion for all CCGs. The Lord of the Rings CCG briefly beat out sales of Magic for a few months. Magic continued a steady pace releasing successful expansion blocks with Odyssey and Onslaught. Decipher released The Motion Pictures expansion for the Star Trek CCG, and also announced that it would be the last expansion for the game. Decipher then released the Second Edition for the Star Trek CCG which refined the rules, rebooted the game, and introduced new card frames. Collectible miniature games continued their effort to take a slice of the pie away from the CCG market with the releases of HeroClix and MechWarrior in 2002 but saw limited success. A second wave of new CCGs (2003‚Äì2005) The next few years saw a large increase in the number of companies willing to start a new CCG. No small thanks to the previous successes of Pok√©mon and Yu-Gi-Oh!, many new CCGs entered the market, many of which tried to continue the trend of franchise tie-ins. Notable entries include The Simpsons, SpongeBob SquarePants, Neopets, G.I. Joe, Hecatomb, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and many others. Duel Masters was introduced to the United States after strong popularity in Japan the previous two years. Wizards of the Coast published it for a couple years before it was cancelled in the U.S. due to weak sales. Two Warhammer CCGs were released with Horus Heresy and WarCry. Horus Heresy lasted two years and was succeeded by Dark Millennium in 2005. Also, two entries from Decipher were released, one that passed the torch from their Star Wars CCG to WARS. WARS kept most of the game play mechanics from their Star Wars game, but transferred them to a new and original setting. The game did not do particularly well, and after two expansions, the game was cancelled in 2005. The other new CCG was .hack//Enemy which won an Origins award. The game was also cancelled in 2005. Plenty of other CCGs were attempted by various publishers, many that were based on Japanese manga such as Beyblade, Gundam War, One Piece, Inuyasha, Zatch Bell!, Case Closed, and YuYu Hakusho. Existing CCGs were reformatted or rebooted including Dragon Ball Z as Dragon Ball GT and Digimon D-Tector as the Digimon Collectible Card Game. An interesting CCG released by Upper Deck was called the Vs. System. It incorporated the Marvel and DC Comics universes and pitted the heroes and villains from those universes against one another. Similarly, the game UFS: The Universal Fighting System used characters from Street Fighter, Soul Calibur, Tekken, Mega Man, Darkstalkers, etc. This CCG was obtained by Jasco Games in 2010 and is currently still being made. Another CCG titled Call of Cthulhu was the spiritual successor to Mythos by the publisher Chaosium. Chaosium licensed the game to Fantasy Flight Games who produced the CCG. Probably one of the biggest developments in the CCG market was the release of Magic's 8th Edition core set. It introduced a redesigned card border and it would later mark the beginning of a new play format titled Modern that utilized cards from this set onward. Another development was Pok√©mon, originally published in English by Wizards, having its publishing rights transferred to Pokemon USA, Inc. in June 2003. This would start a slow revival for the brand, though never reaching the 1999 craze. The CCG renaissance continues (2006‚Äìpresent) The previous years influx of new CCGs continued into 2006. Riding on the success of the popular PC Game World of Warcraft, Blizzard Entertainment licensed Upper Deck to publish a TCG based on the game. The World of Warcraft TCG was born and was carried by major retailers but saw limited success until it was discontinued in 2013 prior to the release of Blizzard's digital card game Hearthstone. Following previous trends, Japanese-influenced CCGs continued to enter the market. These games were either based on cartoons or manga and included: Naruto, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Bleach, Rangers Strike and the classic series Robotech. Dragon Ball GT was rebooted once again in 2008 and renamed as Dragon Ball. Many other franchises were made into CCGs with a few reboots. Notable ones included Cardfight!! Vanguard, Conan, Battlestar Galactica, Power Rangers, 24 TCG, Redakai, Monsuno, and others, as well as another attempt at Doctor Who in the United Kingdom and Australia. Publisher Alderac released City of Heroes CCG based on the City of Heroes PC game. Another video game, Kingdom Hearts for the PS2, was turned into the Kingdom Hearts TCG by Tomy. A few other CCGs were released only in other countries and never made it overseas to English speaking countries, including Monster Hunter of Japan, and ' of Indonesia. By the end of 2008, trouble was brewing between Konami, who owned the rights to Yu-Gi-Oh! and its licensee Upper Deck. Meanwhile, strong sales continued with the three top CCGs of Pok√©mon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and Magic: the Gathering. The Warhammer series Dark Millennium ended its run in 2007. Magic: the Gathering saw a large player boom in 2009, with the release of the Zendikar expansion. The spike in the number of Magic players continued for a few years and leveled off by 2015. Interest also developed with their multiplayer format called Commander. This increase in the player base created a Magic subculture based on finance speculation. New players entering the market from 2009 to 2015 desired cards that were printed before 2009 and with smaller print runs. Demand outstripped quantity and prices of certain cards increased and speculators started to directly manipulate the Magic card market to their advantage. This eventually attracted the interest of the controversial figure Martin Shkreli, former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, for a brief period of time. Prices of cards from previous sets increased dramatically and the American market saw an influx of Chinese counterfeits capitalizing on the demand. This created a unique situation where the most desirable and expensive cards could be printed by counterfeiters, but not by the brand owner, due to a promise made with collectors back in 1996 and refined in 2011. In 2015, Wizards of the Coast implemented more anti- counterfeit measures by introducing a holographic foil onto cards with specific rarities, in addition to creating a proprietary font. Between the time period of 2008 to 2016, Magic: the Gathering sold over 20 billion. A rise in tie-in collectible card games continued with the introduction of the My Little Pony Collectible Card Game. It was licensed to Enterplay LLC by Hasbro and published on December 13, 2013. The collectible cards, according to president Dean Irwin, proved to be moderately successful, so Enterplay reprinted the premiere release set mid-February 2014. Other tie-in games released included the Final Fantasy Trading Card Game and Star Wars: Destiny which after a 3 year run ended production in early 2020. Force of Will was released in 2012 in Japan and in 2013 in English, but as an original intellectual property. One of the longest running CCGs, Legend of the Five Rings, released its final set Evil Portents for free in 2015. After a 20 year run, the brand was sold to Fantasy Flight Games and released as an LCG. In March 2018, it was announced that PlayFusion and Games Workshop would team up to create a new Warhammer trading card game. Reception In 1996 Luke Peterschmidt, designer of Guardians, remarked that unlike board game and RPG players, CCG players seem to assume they can only play one CCG at a time. Often, the less popular CCGs will have localized sales success; some cities a CCG will be a hit, but in many others it will be a flop. Patent for \\"Trading Card Game Method of Play\\" A patent ( US patent number 5,662,332 (A)) originally granted in 1997 to Richard Garfield was for \\"a novel method of game play and game components that in one embodiment are in the form of trading cards\\" that includes claims covering games whose rules include many of Magic's elements in combination, including concepts such as changing orientation of a game component to indicate use (referred to in the Magic and Vampire: The Eternal Struggle rules as \\"tapping\\") and constructing a deck by selecting cards from a larger pool. Garfield transferred the patent to Wizards of the Coast. The patent has aroused criticism from some observers, who believe some of its claims to be invalid. Peter Adkison, CEO of Wizards at the time, remarked that his company was interested in striking a balance between the \\"free flow of ideas and the continued growth of the game business\\" with \\"the ability to be compensated by others who incorporate our patented method of play into their games\\". Adkison continued to say they \\"had no intention of stifling\\" the industry that originated from the \\"success of Magic.\\" In 2003, the patent was an element of a larger legal dispute between Wizards of the Coast and Nintendo, regarding trade secrets related to Nintendo's Pok√©mon Trading Card Game. The legal action was settled out of court, and its terms were not disclosed. Claims of the invention Details of the patent are as follows: * 1. A method of playing games involving two or more players, the method being suitable for games having rules for game play that include instructions on drawing, playing, and discarding game components, and a reservoir of multiple copies of a plurality of game components, the method comprising the steps of: **A. Each player constructing their own library of a predetermined number of game components by examining and selecting game components from the reservoir of game components; **B. Each player obtaining an initial hand of a predetermined number of game components by shuffling the library of game components and drawing at random game components from the player's library of game components; and **C. Each player executing turns in sequence with other players by drawing, playing, and discarding game components in accordance with the rules until the game ends, said step of executing a turn comprises: ***a. making one or more game components from the player's hand of game components available for play by taking the one or more game components from the player's hand and placing the one or more game components on a playing surface; and ***b. bringing into play one or more of the available game components by: (i) selecting one or more game components; and (ii) designating the one or more game components being brought into play by rotating the one or more game components from an original orientation to a second orientation.

It connects the capital of Lower Saxony, Hanover via Wunstorf, Stadthagen and B√ºckeburg with Minden, Osnabr√ºck, Amsterdam and the Ruhr. History  The line was opened on 15 October 1847 by the Royal Hanoverian State Railways. It opened up the Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe, including its capital city, B√ºckeburg and provided a continuous link between Hanover and the Rhineland. On 23 December 1847, a branch was opened from Wunstorf to Bremen, which has ever since formed one of the main railway of Germany because it connects Bremen with southern industries. More connections and access routes are (or were) provided by the Stadthagen‚ÄìStolzenau Railway, the Weser‚ÄìAller Railway to Rotenburg an der W√ºmme, the Cologne-Minden trunk line, which continues the line to the Rhineland, the Rinteln‚ÄìStadthagen Railway, the Minden District Railway and the Bad Eilsen Light Railway from B√ºckeburg to Bad Eilsen and briefly via Meissen to Minden. Development of high-speed railway  The first Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan (1973) identified the Dortmund‚ÄìHannover‚ÄìBrunswick line as one of eight railway development projects. In 1984, a 23.5 kilometre section between B√ºckeburg and Haste was cleared for scheduled speeds of 200 km/h. In 1985, a 13.0 kilometre stretch between Hanover and Wunstorf followed. Rail services The whole line is continuously electrified and served by Intercity-Express, InterCity, Regional- Express and S-Bahn services. In addition, there is heavy freight traffic. Between Minden and Hanover hourly RE trains run (Braunschweig to Bielefeld or Rheine) as doubledeck sets and S-Bahn line S1 (Haste‚ÄìHannover‚ÄìMinden). On the Wunstorf‚ÄìHanover section, services are supplemented by line S2 (Haste‚ÄìHanover‚ÄìNienburg). This route is also served by RE trains on the Hanover‚ÄìBremen‚ÄìNorddeich route. The line has six tracks between Hannover- Nordstadt and Seelze, between Hannover Hbf and Hannover-Nordstadt there are separate S-Bahn-tracks and between Seelze and Wunstorf there are four tracks. However, there are only two tracks on the Wunstorf‚ÄìMinden section. Therefore, freight traffic on this section needs to go into sidings from time to time to allow faster passenger trains to pass through. The provision of four-tracks as already exists on the adjacent Hamm-Minden railway line to the west is planned. However, it is still being debated as whether the existing line will be rebuilt, or whether a new high-speed line will be built between Haste and Seelze, bypassing Wunstorf, with the line west of Haste being rebuilt on its existing route. The construction of one or two S-Bahn tracks between Seelze and Wunstorf by the Hanover region is also under discussion.

It was named after Guido of Arezzo, who pioneered today's conventional musical notation 1,000 years ago. GUIDO was first designed by Holger H. Hoos (then at Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt, Germany, now at University of British Columbia, Canada) and Keith Hamel (University of British Columbia, Canada). Later developments have been done by the SALIERI Project by Holger H. Hoos, Kai Renz and J√ºrgen F. Kilian. GUIDO Music Notation has been designed to represent music in a logical format (with the ability to render to sheet music), whereas LilyPond is more narrowly focused on typesetting sheet music. *The basic idea behind the GUIDO design is representational adequacy which means that simple musical concepts are represented in a simple way and only complex notions require more complex representations. GUIDO is not primarily focused on conventional music notation, but has been invented as an open format, capable of storing musical, structural, and notational information. GUIDO Music Notation is designed as a flexible and easily extensible open standard. In particular, its syntax does not restrict the features it can represent. Thus, GUIDO can be easily adapted and customized to cover specialized musical concepts as might be required in the context of research projects in computational musicology. More importantly, GUIDO is designed in a way that when using such custom extensions, the resulting GUIDO data can still be processed by other applications that support GUIDO but are not aware of the custom extensions, which are gracefully ignored. This design also greatly facilitates the incremental implementation of GUIDO support in music software, which can speed up the software development process significantly, especially for research software and prototypes. GUIDO has been split into three consecutive layers: Basic GUIDO introduces the main concepts of the GUIDO design and allows to represent much of the conventional music of today. Advanced GUIDO extends Basic GUIDO by adding exact score-formatting and some more advanced musical concepts. Finally, Extended GUIDO can represent user-defined extensions, like microtonal information or user defined pitch classes.  Example of a GUIDO input file  Basic GUIDO notation is similar to that of the LilyPond input format. Two obvious differences are the specification of octaves and durations, as shown in the example below. Both formats are to some extent inspired by the LaTeX format for typesetting text.

Master of the autobiographical style, his writing charts the internal emotional landscape of the evolving 20th century man. Lally started out playing piano and reading his poetry in coffeehouses and bars in 1959. In 1962 he joined the United States Air Force, where he spent more than four years as an enlisted man, and later used the G.I. Bill to attend the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. While living in Iowa Lally‚Äôs devotion to political reform extended beyond editorials. In the fall of 1968 he actively campaigned for the position of Johnson County Sheriff as part of the Peace and Freedom Party ticket.

Acting career He moved from New York to Los Angeles in 1982 to find work acting in movies and TV (as Michael David Lally), mostly as a bad guy and the occasional good guy. He was seen in films including Basic Instinct (1992), White Fang (1991) and Cool World (1992), as well as on TV as Captain Bubb in Deadwood (2004), Walter Hoyt on NYPD Blue (1995‚Äì97) and Detective Frank Costa on JAG (1997‚Äì98).https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0482470/?ref_=nmbio_bio_nm His writing found its way into several movies including .

Background Walsh was a native of Gurteen, Ballinasloe, County Galway, and joined the force on 21 April 1965. Incident at Cabinteely Walsh was on patrol on 11 July 1967, in Cabinteely, Dublin. At 2.45 a.m., he went to investigate a car parked at a filling station, but it made off at high speed. A high-speed chase, over a distance of some two and a half miles, ensued, ending when the car crashed into a wall. A man fled the scene, and on being tackled by Walsh began to assault the garda, who found that the man was much larger. The man used a foot-long metal tool to hit Walsh on his left, causing him to retreat. Returning, Walsh removed the tool only to find that the assailant had a screwdriver; however, he was able to disable him long enough to detain him at a doorway and ring a doorbell, looking for assistance. > \\"But the assailant then made a frantic effort to free himself.

It honors the best online short stories. The award is structured to be egalitarian allowing for anyone to nominate a story including readers, authors, editors and publishers; prize money is donated by readers and writers; and the winners are selected by public vote from a short-list of entries selected by judges. Overview The Million Writers Award was founded by author Jason Sanford in 2003 at a time when the literary establishment \\"didn't believe online magazines were legitimate places to publish fiction,\\" seeing it as a fad. Sanford set out to honor and highlight online only publications and stories with the award. Stories eligible for the award include those first published in online literary journals, magazines, and e-zines that have an editorial process. The award has a variable cash prize, in 2011 for example it was $600 for the winner, $200 for the runner-up and $100 for third place. Prize money is raised through donations from writers, editors and readers and thus fluctuates each year. Anyone can nominate up to one story, while editors and publishers can nominate three stories. Stories must be at least 1000 words. The award has become one of the premier online literary awards and was named a Hot Site by USA Today. The award was profiled in a six-page feature interview with editor Jason Sanford in the 2005 Novel and Short Story Writer's Market\\"Personal Views: Jason Sanford On the Million Writers Award\\" by Mary Cox, 2005 Novel and Short Story Writer's Market Writer's Digest Books, 2004, p. 23. and mentioned in The 100 Best Trends, 2006: Emerging Developments You Can't Afford to Ignore as an example of the emerging online literary movement.The 100 Best Trends, 2006: Emerging Developments You Can't Afford to Ignore by George Ochoa and Melinda Corey, Adams Media Corporation, 2005, p. 55.

She worked briefly as an advertising copywriter while studying acting with teachers such as the Central School's legendary Elsie Fogerty and in 1937 she made her repertory debut at the Brixton Theatre in A Bill of Divorcement. Theatre She worked with director Alec Clunes at the Arts Theatre Club during its heyday in the 1940s and 1950s. What the actor-manager sought for the little underground playhouse in London's Great Newport Street was an audience \\"eager for intelligent and entertaining plays\\". Laird's acting went from strength to strength in Farquhar, Ibsen, Chekhov, Shaw and other modern plays. While at the Arts Theatre, she periodically returned to \\"commercial\\" theatre, playing Rose in The Recruiting Officer (1943) and Nora in A Doll's House (1945). As Ellie, in the revival by Californian John Fernald of Shaw's Heartbreak House (1950), she revealed, one critic wrote, \\"an enchanting combination of youth and firmness.

She published illustrations under her maiden name Olive Allen and her married name Olive Biller. She briefly attended art school in Liverpool, then the Lambeth School of Art, London, and finally, from 1900, the Slade School of Art, London. She studied most notably with Henry Tonks of whom she made a satirical drawing (now in the collection of the Strang, University College London). From 1901, as Olive Allen, she was an illustrator of magazines, children's books and Christmas annuals, chiefly for T. C. & E. C. Jack of London.For example, E. Johnson, Fact and Fable (London, 1901) [illus. by Olive Allen]; M. Edgeworth, retold and illus. by O. Allen,, The Birthday Present (London, 1908). Some titles were translated into German and enjoyed wide circulation. After marrying John Biller in 1912, she emigrated to Canada. Her commercial work virtually ceased at this point, but she continued to illustrate her life and surroundings in letters and sketchbooks. After her husband‚Äôs death in World War I, Biller settled with her two children on James Island in 1919. In 1927 she moved to Victoria, where she was an active member of the Island Arts and Crafts Society founded by Josephine Crease.Victoria, British Columbia, Archives & Record Service, Department of Visual Records, documents and records of the Island Arts and Crafts Society, 1909‚Äì41. A copy of the exhibition list is also in the Department of Prints and Drawings, British Museum. Japanese Kindergarten (between 1934 and 1939, Private Collection) Relocating to Vancouver in 1934, she studied oil painting with Jock Macdonald, Fred Varley and life drawing with Tonshek Ustinov (1903‚Äì90) at the British Columbia College of Art. This short-lived art school was formed in 1933 by artists disgruntled with the Vancouver School of Decorative and Applied Arts, forerunner of the Vancouver School of Art. Biller‚Äôs later work consists primarily of landscapes and genre scenes in an expressionist style, akin to but more lyrical than her contemporary Emily Carr. Her early illustrations owe much to Arthur Rackham and his circle. Biller exhibited at the Vancouver Art Gallery and other Canadian venues. A substantial corpus of her work was donated by Jill Simms, the artist's daughter, to the University of British Columbia. Other examples of her paintings and drawings are in the BC Archives, the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, University College London and private collections in Canada and the UK.

Duncan, the architect of Grant's Tomb, it was built at a time that Columbus Circle was expected to become a theatre district. Initially, the theatre, which seated about 1,355 and hosted original musicals and operettas, including The Wizard of Oz and Babes in Toyland, and some plays. It was renamed Park Theatre in 1911, opening with The Quaker Girl, and it again presented plays, musicals, and operettas. The Shuberts, Florenz Ziegfeld, and Billy Minsky, in succession, owned the house but did not find success there. In 1925, it was purchased by William Randolph Hearst, renamed Cosmopolitan Theatre, and played movies as well as live theatre. During the period it was used as a playhouse, its last name was amended to include International Theatre.\\"International Theatre\\", Internet Broadway Database, accessed June 8, 2013 In 1949, NBC leased the theatre, and made it into a television studio rechristened as NBC International Theatre, with the Admiral Broadway Revue being one of the first TV shows aired from this location.

Education  Bartlett grew up in Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania, where he attended Cheltenham High School and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Classics from Brown University in 1988 and a second Bachelor of Arts in Literae Humaniores from New College, Oxford in 1991. While at Brown University, Bartlett answered hot lines at Rhode Island Project AIDS. Life and works He was director of the SafeGuards Gay Men's Health Project in Philadelphia from 1991‚Äì2001, where he developed innovative programs addressing the broader health needs of gay and bisexual men beyond HIV and AIDS.Tuller, David, The New York Times, August 14, 2001, p. F5. \\"For Gay Men, Health Care Concerns Move Beyond the Threat of AIDS\\" In his early research, he directed a survey of over 1400 gay and bisexual men in the Philadelphia region in order to assess their risk for HIV, STDs and other health challenges.Whyte J., Green E., Bartlett C.

In 2003, Bartlett collaborated with gay activist Eric Rofes to create the Gay Men's Health Leadership Academy, a national center for excellence for leadership development of gay and bisexual men and their allies based at the White Crane Institute. The Academy hosts biannual retreats on the East Coast (Greenwich, New York) and the West Coast (Guerneville, California) of the United States, and also works with organizations and governments to strengthen their cadres of gay leadership. Since Rofes' death, the program has been co- facilitated by Kevin Trimell Jones of Philadelphia, PA; Fred Lopez of San Francisco, CA; Scott Pegues of Denver, CO; and Kaijson Noilmar of Seattle, WA.

The Shroud of Turin Research Project (often abbreviated as STURP) refers to a team of scientists which performed a set of experiments and analyses on the Shroud of Turin during the late 1970s and early 1980s. STURP issued its final report in 1981. Joe Nickell of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry has pointed out that \\"STURP‚Äôs leaders served on the executive council of the Holy Shroud Guild, which is devoted to the ‚Äúcause‚Äù of the reputed relic.\\" The origins of the group go back to the experiments of physicist John P. Jackson, thermodynamicist Eric Jumper and photographer William Mottern in 1976. Using the ideas invented in aerospace science for building three dimensional models from images of Mars, Eric Jumper built initial devices to test the photographs of the Shroud of Turin. These were the first experiments relating to the shroud performed by scientists.Bernard Ruffin, 1999, The Shroud of Turin -page 79 In March 1977, Jackson, Jumper and Mottern invited a few other scientists to join them to form a team for the analysis of the Shroud. The first meeting took place in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The group had no official sponsorship and the scientists funded their own activities. They also managed to arrange gifts and loans of technical equipment whose value was estimated at over $2 million. Nuclear physicist Tom D'Muhala headed STURP. Apart from Jackson, Jumper, and Motten the team included thermal chemist Raymond N. Rogers, and Ron London, and Roger Morris, all from Los Alamos National Laboratory. Other team members included Don Lynn of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, biophysicist John Heller, photographers Vern Miller and Barrie Schwortz, optical physicist Sam Pellicori, and electric power experts John D. German and Rudy Dichtl, as well as forensic pathologist Robert Bucklin. STURP included no experts on medieval art, archaeology, or textiles. To commemorate the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the shroud in Turin, it was displayed to the public in Turin from 27 August to 8 October 1978, with about 3 million visitors attending the exposition under bullet-proof glass. For the next 5 days after the exposition the STURP team analyzed the shroud around the clock at the royal palace adjoining Turin Cathedral, some scientists sleeping while others worked. A team of European scientists headed by Luigi Gonella supervised the activities.Bernard Ruffin, 1999, The Shroud of Turin -page 80-83 The team gathered sticky tape samples of material from several points on the surface of the shroud.The orphaned manuscript: a gathering of publications on the Shroud of Turin by Alan D.

Rogers, 2008 In 1981, in its final report, STURP wrote:http://www.shroud.com/78conclu.htm > \\"We can conclude for now that the Shroud image is that of a real human form > of a scourged, crucified man.

Background Canavan was a native of Tuam, County Galway, and joined the Irish police force in 1978. He was awarded the Scott Medal in recognition of his valour in the arrest of Sean \\"Bap\\" Hughes of the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), on 16 May 1997. Incident at Foxford Canavan was off duty when he observed a man acting suspiciously enter the Bank of Ireland, following which there was a shotgun blast, after which bank customers fled the building. Pausing only to open a pub door asking the owner to call the garda, Canavan turned back to find the robber running towards a parked car, where he caught him. The robber threatened the life of Canavan, reached into his pocket but was grabbed at the wrist. During the violent struggle the robber entered the car, and grabbing a shotgun on the back seat, aimed it at Canavan, who pushed the barrel upwards and eventually subdued the suspect. It was later determined that the robber did indeed have a pistol in his pocket and a live round in the shotgun. The robber was identified as Sean \\"Bap\\" Hughes of the INLA, who was wanted in connection with the disappearance of Seamus Ruddy near Paris in 1985, and the murder of Garda Patrick Gerard Reynolds in Dublin in 1982. Hughes was acquitted on the charge of murder but imprisoned on the charge of robbery. Minister of Justice, John O'Donoghue, awarded Canavan the Scott Medal at Templemore on 23 July 2003.

David Kusek and Don Williams et al. at Passport Designs originally created it, continuation of marketing and development by GVOX, and, as of Aug. 8, 2013, by Passport Music Software, LLC.http://www.passportmusic.com/products/master-tracks-pro/ History MTP originated in the middle ‚Äô80s for the Commodore and Apple II machines, and when the Atari ST implemented its MIDI support. It has continued to be one of the more popular proprietary sequencers, but hasn't seen any major updates since 2003 (after having been acquired by GVOX) other than 6.8.4 for Windows, which is reputed to have compatibility issues of its own. However, MTP's user- friendly interface and ease of use long made it one of the better packages for managing MIDI. See the Passport Designs Wiki for more details. GVOX sold the Passport software to Passport Music Software, LLC, in the second half of 2013. Future Passport Music Software, LLC, had announced plans to show MasterTracks Pro 7 at the 2015 NAMM show, but as of January 2019, the latest version offered on its website was Version 6.8.4 for Windows. Capabilities MTP's default data rate is 240 ppqn (time base, pulses per quarter note), or can use 480960, for higher resolution. A child window is not limited within a parent, but can be placed anywhere on the screen. The user can save this layout by invoking Setup  Save preferences, which creates a new PREFER683.MTP with this information. MTP's Anastasia font is used for rendering the Notation window's two-stave piano score, and also provides symbols for guitar-tablature display of chording. Its fixed-size Conductor window at bottom center left in the screen shot allows flexing of tempo, offsetting in real time, by dragging the slider thumb. The also fixed-size Transport strip-window to its right provides controls analogous to those of a tape deck, to start-stop, index, etc.; displays measure  beat  clock information for the sequence currently being played; and shows the file name on its title bar. MTP's windows can display continuous data either as a linear curve or filled below, and one can thin MIDI data according to need. It can handle as many as 16 MIDI interfaces, and supports the MCI on Windows, has remote capabilities, a ‚Äúbig counter‚Äù mode for visibility at a distance during performance or recording, and also punch- in and -out capabilities. MTP can insert and manage markers, information about which can be imported into its Notepad along with track information, as well as handle quite complex meter layouts, as long as beats per measure is less than 17. Appearance and functionality A GUI application, it uses a hierarchy of windows as listed here: * A master, non-closeable, but resizable/positionable stripe-window at the top in the screen shot at right, which supervises the application's overall user interface via a standard menu with drop-down functions: ** File, for standard handling functions, which include saving to its own native .MTS file format (which appears to conflict with other multimedia formats), and also saves to generic .MID, or .RMI (RIFF), of either types 0 & 1\\\\. This menu also provides notation-print capabilities. ** Edit, for context-sensitive MIDI-editing functions ** Change, for changing parameters within track data, such as filtering, quantizing/humanizing, etc. ** The Windows menu provides access to such for each main MIDI data type (all of which the user can position and size within reasonable limits, which values are stored in its configuration file, PREFER683.MTP, found in MTP's installation directory): *** A Track Editor that can manage up to 64 tracks. Its hideable left half displays global data for each track such as flags, and the right displays track measures as horizontal rows of rectangles (dark-blue if a measure is non-empty, else white) by default numbered in multiples of four, which increment can be changed. *** The Notation window displays a track's MIDI in a WYSIWYG notation format on a two- stave piano tablature using code derived from Passport's notation application Encore (which requires the font Anastasia, provided in TrueType and Type 1 formats). The inter-staff split point for notes can be reset, to adjust ledger-line behavior. The user can click on and edit notes in this mode, such as flatting or sharping on a note-by-note basis. *** The Piano Roll window displays a track's MIDI note and program-change data in a window that resembles a player piano roll: It shows notes as multi-pixel-thick, dark-blue line segments. The user can edit data using many useful mechanisms, such as being able to turn on note-velocity display, which is then shown as a thin vertical line at the left of note segments, click-dragging entire notes, or their ends for length, etc. *** The Event Editor presents all a track's data as a raw vertical alphanumeric, filterable list, which permits direct entry of data or editing it piecemeal, or by selected region. *** A Master Fader allows the user to control overall volume from one place. *** The Pitch Bend window displays such data graphically, and allows it to be entered and edited that way in an interactive manner, with the mouse. *** The Channel Pressure window functions similarly for that data type. *** The Key Pressure window functions similarly for that data type. *** The Modulation window functions similarly for that data type. *** The Controllers window functions similarly for data of that type for each MIDI specified controller ‚Äî e.g., dynamic contours as controlled via #7 volume, L-R pan via #10. *** The Velocity window separates and displays notes‚Äô velocity data in a graphical format without distracting note data, to permit easier visualization of velocity-related dynamics. *** The Tempo Map window allows fine-scale WYSIWYG graphical editing of this MIDI- file data track, for controlling rubato, accel- and ritardando, etc. ‚Äî as opposed to the coarse, basic control provided by the Conductor function on the Info drop-down menu (q.v., below). ** Songs, for managing multiple open files, playing them as program sets, opening and saving such, re-ordering them, etc. ** Layout, for controlling options for display of data. ** Options, for controlling program operational functionality. ** Setup, for controlling program parameters like *** Sysex (system-Exclusive, for sending/receiving such data to/from an external device, and saving to a file) *** Remote (which music-keyboard keys control what program features, remotely) *** MIDI setup (driver channels, etc.) *** Sync (internal or external) *** Click (which notes/channels to use for this) *** Thru (for behavior & channels for this) *** Chase Controllers (which to chase, etc.) *** Record filter (block data from being recorded, etc.) *** Punch (in/out points) *** Time Base (240 [default], 480, or 960, plus conversion options) *** Save Preferences (.MTP file) ** Info, for displaying system and sequence parameters, including an editable notepad for the sequence. ** Help, which invokes a compiled help file.

Highlighting the publication of theoretically-based empirical > articles and case studies of significant theoretical trends that are taking > place within the field of economic geography, the journal serves as a forum > for high-quality and innovative scholarship. In keeping with the > international scope and impact of this work, Economic Geography focuses upon > the exciting new research ideas and analyses emerging from scholarly > networks throughout the world. Its aims and scope are further clarified: > Economic Geography is an internationally peer-reviewed journal committed to > publishing original research that makes leading-edge advances within and > beyond the sub-discipline of economic geography. We publish high-quality, > substantive work that is theoretically rich and informed by empirical > evidence that deepens our understandings of the geographical drivers and > implications of economic processes, broadly considered. We welcome > submissions that focus on a wide range of topics, deploy primary evidence in > support of theoretically significant interventions, and contribute key > insights regarding pressing economic, social, development, and environmental > questions and challenges. All reviewable submissions are assessed by at > least three external referees, as well as an editor, and we adhere to a > rigorous peer-review process in order to ensure that only the highest > quality manuscripts are published annually. Owned by Clark University since > 1925, Economic Geography plays a central role in supporting the activities > of the field globally both through publications and other forms of support > for scholarly activities. The journal is published currently as five issues > per year, in January, March, June, August, and November.  Overview of topics  In its early decades (1920s through 1950s), Economic Geography mostly published articles regarding natural resource extraction and trade statistics of various countries and regions, reflecting the more regional focus of the discipline of geography in that period. More generally, the journal also published descriptions and statistics of various industries and overviews of population trends in various areas. Beginning in the 1960s, reflecting the influence of the quantitative revolution and the emergence of the field of regional science, articles describing theoretical economic patterns and empirical analyses of economic and population phenomena began to appear. Through the 1970s, the journal continued to publish regionally-focused articles, although empirical studies remained increasingly prevalent. During the 1980s, the journal began publishing articles discussing social justice, globalization, and global flows of capital, following strains of Marxist geography that had arisen during the 1970s and which contrasted with the primarily empirical and descriptive papers it has typically published. Additionally, articles began to reflect an increased interest in studies of innovation diffusion, urbanization, and suburbanization, and the 1980s also brought several special issues dedicated to specific topics. Today, publications in the journal cover a wide range of topics that reflect the growth and diversification of the field of economic geography including: global production networks, evolutionary economic geography, feminist economic geography, labor geographies, marketization studies, financialization, urban and regional studies, and sustainability transitions. The geographical diversity of this scholarship has increased significantly in the past decade as increasing attention has been paid to economic geographies of and in the Global South. In addition to original research, each issue published since the journal's inception typically contains reviews of scholarly books on various subjects related to economic geography.

Congregation Kol Ami is a Reform synagogue in Frederick, Maryland, United States. History The congregation was founded on February 21, 2003, by a group of eight families as the Reform Jewish congregation in Frederick. Services are held at Unitarian-Universalist Church on Elmer Derr Road. In 2004, the congregation received a Torah for use in worship. In 2005, Kol Ami hired Student Rabbi Daniel Sikowitz. The same year, Kol Ami began its religious school. In November of that year, Kol Ami had been accepted as members in the Union for Reform Judaism. In 2007, Kol Ami offered and Rabbi Dan Sikowitz accepted the position as first rabbi in Kol Ami's short history. In October 2007, a group of women at Kol Ami celebrated their bat mitzvahs. The women, who varied in age, were older than the traditional age for such a celebration, but had never had such an opportunity themselves since the tradition was not popular when they were that age. In 2008, Kol Ami received a Torah saved from the Holocaust from Lviv, Ukraine. It was the first Torah scroll of the congregation, and they paid $20,000 for it.http://www.fredericknewspost.com/sections/news/display.htm?StoryID=72262 Members of the congregation, some of whom are of Ukrainian descent, assisted in writing the Torah.http://wjz.com/local/torah.synagogue.frederick.2.693682.html The congregation frequently participates in social action programs such as the Frederick food bank.  The Torah  Prior to World War II, Lvov was a major center of Jewish life with over 200,000 Jewish inhabitants. The Jews represented the vast array of Jewish practice, from Reform Jews to the Orthodox. When the Nazis invaded Ukraine, they let the Ukrainians round up all the Jews and lock them in their synagogues. They then set fire to them. A brave priest saved the several Torahs from destruction. It laid in the basement of a monastery for decades. Then, an arts dealer bought the Torahs from the church. He then ripped it apart and sold the parchment for canvas to artists. A rabbi, Menachem Youlus from Save a Torah (an organization that brings forgotten Torahs to welcoming congregations) asked the arts dealer for Torah parchment. The man said you have the weekend to assemble all the Torahs and pay for what you have. In the storeroom there were piles of ripped up Torahs and the rabbi assembled twenty-two of them. One of the Torahs was reassembled and found a home at Kol Ami. However, an investigation by the Washington Post has cast doubt on the authenticity of this and other Torah scrolls purportedly discovered to have survived the Holocaust and been recovered by Menachem Youlis and the Save a Torah Foundation.

Mears (born January 11, 1935) is an American journalist, author, and teacher. He was one of the reporters, featured in the 1973 book The Boys on the Bus, who covered the 1972 presidential election between Richard Nixon and George McGovern. He won the 1977 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for his coverage of the 1976 Presidential campaign and election. Mears retired from his career as a political reporter, editor, and news executive in 2001. In 2016 he joined the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Duke University, as a volunteer instructor, teaching classes on election campaigns; he had previously taught undergraduate classes in journalism. Education Mears graduated from Middlebury College in 1956 and received an honorary Doctor of Letters in 1977. He served on the Board of Trustees from 1980 to 1984 and was the recipient of the Alumni Award in 2011. Mears served as the editor-in-chief of the school newspaper, the Campus, and referred to his four years of work with the paper as his \\"journalism school\\".  Career  Mears began working as a newsman with the Associated Press (AP) immediately after graduation in 1956. He reported on national politics from 1960 to 2001. Throughout his career in journalism, he covered 11 presidential elections, and his stories have appeared in almost every American newspaper. Mears was such a well known and established news reporter that he was featured in Doonesbury comics; one Trudeau comic strip, published on February 5, 1973, depicted Mears questioning Richard Nixon's so-called \\"Energy Czar\\", John A. Love, during the embargo and oil crisis. Mears retired from the newspaper business in 2001. Occasionally, he publishes articles on his AP blog. Mears authored the book Deadlines Past: Forty Years of Presidential Campaigning: A Reporter's Story, which was published in 2003. He co-authored two more books with a colleague, John William Chancellor: The News Business (1993) and The New News Business: A Guide to Writing and Reporting (1995). He also worked for two years with reporters of the Associated Press in writing Breaking News: How the Associated Press Has Covered War, Peace and Everything Else (2004). He has won several awards over the course of his career. In 1973 he won the Associated Press Managing Editors Associations Top Performance Award, and in 1986 he won the Associated Press, Robert R. Eunson Distinguished Journalist Award. In 1977, after winning the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting, the AP awarded him a membership to the Burning Tree Club.  Political and philosophical views  Mears believed the newspaper business had a duty to report facts and maintain a neutral point of view; he believed that personal opinions had no place in good journalism. Even after retiring, he continued to encourage transparent campaign coverage and spoke about the need for good background and fact checking, especially in the digital age of reporting. He believed that \\"print news is the best place to look for information\\". In 2004, two questions were directed to Mears during the first session of a bloggers conference sponsored by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. The questioner, David Weinberger, wanted to know whom Mears supported for president; Mears refused to say, asking \\"How could you trust what I write?\\" In response, Mears was asked how could he be trusted in what he writes about on his blog. Mears responded to the second question in his AP blog by speaking to the importance of transparency and ethics in campaign reporting. He decried the lack of content and accuracy in much of today's reporting. He wrote about the need to \\"get the facts straight\\", and, while he acknowledged the difference and difficulties in reporting between his days and now, he implicitly responded to the question asked by Weinberger by explaining how to earn trust. Mears' point in the blog was emphasized by Bill Mitchell and Bob Steel in a report for The Poynter Institute after the conference. During his years of reporting and after, Mears was critical of all candidates, no matter their political affiliation. Earlier in 2004, speaking at Montgomery College's Lycem series, he called the political conventions \\"all show and no decision\\". During a question-and-answer session, he said the word media \\"had become convoluted in the context of 24-hour cable news and the 'echo chamber' it [had] created\\". In a 2016 interview for Duke Today, when questioned about \\"getting the journalism that our democracy needs\\", Mears responded: In the same interview, he was questioned about the presidential election campaign. Mears remained analytical in his responses. When asked about Trump speeches and if they reminded of him of an earlier era, Mears compared him to populist senator Huey Long, citing historical comparisons, rather than conjecture and opinion, by saying: Huey Long had popular support for and considered running for president against FDR in 1936. In 2019, Mears described his views on the impeachment hearings of Donald Trump in the context of previous hearings of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.  Personal life  Mears was born in Lynn, Massachusetts. Mears' first wife died in a house fire in the early 1960s. He met his second wife, Frances \\"Fran\\" Richardson, in 1994. Frances was also a reporter, editor, and bureau chief with the Associated Press. Following Mears' retirement in 2001, the couple moved to Arlington, Virginia. After his book Deadlines Past was published, they left the Washington, D.C., area in 2005 and moved to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, retiring to the Governors Club, a private community, seeking a more relaxed lifestyle. Frances died from cancer in 2019. ReferencesExternal links * **Booknotes interview with Mears on Deadlines Past: Forty Years of Presidential Campaigning -- A Reporter's Story, January 11, 2004.

He was also the first Professor of Psychiatry at the medical school from its opening in 1893 until 1905. Early life Hurd was born in Union City, Michigan, the son of a physician. At age fourteen, he entered Knox College but soon moved to the University of Michigan, receiving a B.S. in 1863. He began the study of medicine at Rush Medical College in Chicago and, after a year, returned to the University of Michigan Medical College graduating with an M.D. in 1866. He worked as a dispensary physician and practiced medicine in Chicago until 1890 when he moved to Kalamazoo to accept a post as assistant physician at the Michigan Asylum for the Insane. He became assistant Superintendent in 1878 but left a few months later to become the superintendent of the newly opened Eastern Michigan Asylum in Pontiac where he remained for 11 years. In 1881 he visited asylums in Europe. During his stay at Pontiac, he advocated and introduced measures to lessen restraint of patients, to provide occupations for patients and to improve education of nurses. He was served as Secretary of the National Medico-Psychological Association (now the American Psychiatric Association) from 1892‚Äì97 and as President (1898‚Äì99). In 1895 the University of Michigan awarded him the LL.D. degree. Career Psychiatry lodged in the country‚Äôs mental hospitals was not a strong discipline in American medicine but when the Trustees of the newly built Johns Hopkins Hospital sought a director, Hurd was selected and assumed the post in 1889. Johns Hopkins, a Quaker philanthropist in Baltimore, died in 1873, leaving his fortune for the building of a hospital and medical school, stipulating that the two facilities must work together and be devoted to scientific observation, experiment, and personal observation; a new approach to medical training and patient care. The Trustees were fortunate to have the services of John Shaw Billings, physician, Civil War veteran, librarian, and hospital administrator to assist in organizing and planning the new hospital. When Hurd was appointed director, he worked closely with Billings. In 1895, the two published a small volume titled Suggestions to Hospital and Asylum Visitors. The Johns Hopkins Hospital and Medical School (1893) quickly assumed a leadership role in American medicine. Publication of its work began with the Johns Hopkins Hospital Bulletins and the Johns Hopkins Reports (discontinued in 1926). Hurd was Editor of Publications, producing seventy-two issues of the Bulletin (1899‚Äì1906) and sixteen volumes of the Reports. His own publications covered four main areas: psychiatry, hospital management, nursing education, and medical education. Hurd served also on the editorial boards of the American Journal of Insanity and Modern Hospital. He was President of the American Academy of Medicine in 1896 and of the American Hospital Association in 1912. Hurd will be especially remembered for his Editorship of the monumental four-volume work titled Institutional Care of the Insane in the United States and Canada (1916). Hurd wrote the entire first volume (497 pages) which deals with the history of American psychiatry. The other three volumes describe every public and private asylum and include bibliographies of prominent psychiatrists. The work was undertaken at the request of the American Medico-Psychological Association by a committee of six asylum superintendents with Hurd as Editor in Chief. Legacy At the dedication of Hurd Hall in 1932, an addition to the hospital, Judge Henry Harlan, a trustee, said of Hurd, ‚Äúhis statesmanship, tact, kindness, and breadth of vision; his harmonizing influence and generous appreciation and admiration created between Hospital and University a spirit of cooperation and admiration for achievements of the other and marked the relationship of the hospital and medical school.‚Äù An associate said of Hurd, ‚ÄúIf he had any faults, I‚Äôve forgotten them‚Äù.

Jerome.Drei Mann in einem Boot (1961) Filmlexikon. The film is also known as Drei Mann in einem Boot. Vom Hunde ganz zu schweigen (long West German title).  Plot summary  The advertisement salesmen Harry Berg und Jerome, named \\"Jo\\", Sommer are on holiday at the Bodensee alone. Jo is trying to catch the young girl Grit and Harry wants to get rid of his intrusive girlfriend Julitschka. When she suddenly appears, Harry and Jo are trying to buy a boat to drive away. They also find a dog and call him \\"Sputnik\\". Also the art salesman Georg Nolte is trying to have holiday but his wife Carlotta and his daughter Grit are not allowing him it. In a bar he's listening to Harry's and Jo's talk about the boat and asks them to join them, he offers himself as a cook. Both agree and the three of them are calling the trip \\"Three Men on a boat, not to forget about the dog\\", in reference to a well-known book. They also call the boat \\"Marianne\\". When the wives discover the missing of their husbands they are trying to follow them. Julitschka even is hiring a Swiss detective Georg offers to travel over the Rhine, so he can be at an auction in Amsterdam to buy a painting by Renoire and sell one by Brueghel. On the boat Georg and Harry are named Captains (Georg claimed that he was on a battleship, however he told later that he was only a visitor) and Jo the first maid. But things change after they have an accident at the Rheinfall, where Georg doesn't noticed it, so he becomes the first maid instead of Jo. Later they have another accident with another ship, where one of the crew, the maid Betje is falling over board and is saved by the three men from the \\"Marianne\\". During the travel they also stop in K√∂nigswinter, where Georg finds his daughter and he realized that Jo was after her, but he allows him. He hasn't seen his wife and tells her over the phone to wait in Amsterdam. Meanwhile, Harry is trying to catch his luck with Betje. In Amsterdam Harry and Jo go to the auction but Georg is late, because he's stopping the boat at a place for carriage boats. When he comes to the auction he's told that the Renoire is sold very cheap to a young guy. Apparently Jo accidentally bought the paining, because he didn't knew the hand-raise-rule of the auction. Harry told Georg about it in the way, that Jo did a great bluff. Georg is impressed with Jo and at the end everybody is happy. At the end Julitschka doesn't want Harry any more and starts dating the detective. Meanwhile, Harry and Georg are on the boat with Betje and Carlotta, while the boat is tied by a rope to a car with Jo and Grit inside. At the end Jo said, \\"Would be good to get rid of them\\", not noticing that the rope got ripped. The movie ends with that scene.  Differences from novel  The location is changed from the Thames to the Rhine River, the story differs substantially and is set to happen in 1960. The main connection to the novel is the basic idea of three friends travelling downriver in a boat and the names are of the characters are similar. The novel itself is also mentioned in a dialog.

The movie Alter Kahn und junge Liebe, starring Roy Black contains slight similarity with the plot of this movie (travel on a boat from Bodensee to Amsterdam, a crew of three, two men and a girl, and a dog, problems at the Rheinfall), however the main plot is too different to put this as a remake.

The album was preceded by four singles: \\"Inner Child\\", \\"Is it You?\\", \\"I Am/Innocence\\" and \\"Samurai Drive\\", with the latter three reaching the top ten of the Oricon chart. \\"Samurai Drive\\", promoted as Huma-rhythm's lead single, became Hitomi's highest peaking entry at number three and is considered to be one of her signature songs. She later performed it at the 52nd K≈çhaku Uta Gassen'. At the 43rd Japan Record Awards, Hitomi received an Excellent Work accolade for \\"Is it You?\\". Huma-rhythm was a commercial success, peaking at the top of the Oricon charts and charting for eight consecutive weeks, selling over 521,000 copies in total. The album was supported by the nationwide Hitomi Live Tour 2002 Huma-Rhythm, which visited twenty-one cities and closed out at the Nippon Budokan. At the time of the album's release, Hitomi viewed it as a \\"culminative work\\" which would allow her to pursue \\"different possibilities\\", a sentiment she would repeat in developing her second greatest hits album Self Portrait released later that year.  Background and development  In June 2000, Hitomi released the single \\"Love 2000\\", which became widely successful after marathon runner Naoko Takahashi stated that the song helped to raise her tensh≈çn („ÉÜ„É≥„Ç∑„Éß„É≥) or \\"excitement\\" before races, leading to a Gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics. The single became Hitomi's longest-charting entry at twenty-six weeks, and its parent album Love Life (2000) sold over 766,000 copies at the end of 2001. The success of \\"Love 2000\\" prompted her first performance at the 51st K≈çhaku Uta Gassen. Despite this newfound popularity, a sense of dissatisfaction began to pervade her thoughts. Hitomi developed her follow up from the notion that, \\"the wave of my 2000 self came crashing against the wall of my existence\\". In a February 2002 interview with Beat Freak magazine, she explains: While Hitomi stated that she always tried to write lyrics as truthfully as she could, she noted a growing desire to \\"pursue the core of [her] being\\" and set the word \\"humanity\\" as her personal theme during the album's development. The title Huma-rhythm itself is coined from \\"human\\", meant to express individuality, and \\"rhythm\\" to represent joy and freedom. The title further articulates her view that \\"[one] should be able to live happier with these [concepts]\\", which retailer HMV further notes as \\"symbolizing her position in living according to her roots.\\" Hitomi listened to Strawberry Flower, Fantastic Plastic Machine, A Tribe Called Quest, and Bran Van 3000 during its recording, though she affirmed that none of these artists influenced Huma-rhythm directly. \\"Innocence\\" was recorded as an image song („Ç§„É°„Éº„Ç∏„ÇΩ„É≥„Ç∞) for the Fuji TV coverage of the 28th Berlin Marathon, which Takahashi was a participant of, and it is said that the department's producer asked Hitomi personally. When asked by Yuko Ayakawa of Groovin' how she felt \\"[being] supported by so many woman of [her] own age,\\" and if she's aware of it when creating music, Hitomi stated: \\"Very happy... I can‚Äôt say I don‚Äôt [think of it] at all. I am a woman too.\\"  Recording and composition  The album was recorded over the period of a year, in which several \\"large impact\\" singles were released, influencing her decision to balance Huma-rhythm with a selection of \\"relaxed\\" songs. Hitomi stated that she fixated less on sounding \\"rock\\" and leaned towards \\"a rather programming-style\\" in regards to its arrangement. As she approached her vocals with the idea of giving each track \\"a different atmosphere\\", she found difficulty in \\"making the switch emotionally between songs\\". The album opens with the intro \\"Cosmic World\\", which Hitomi intended to evoke the image of \\"Space equals air, Earth equals myself and living creatures.\\" It then delves into \\"Ele Pop\\", CD Journal commenting: \\"A flashy and cute up-tempo pop number whose arrangement combines retro video game-like electronic and disco sounds.\\" Hitomi states, \\"I took each shredded phrase and connected them into one piece.\\"  Release  The album was announced on December 21, 2001; a press release through Tower Records detailed a first press limited edition sold exclusively through their stores with a special cover. A short preview of Hitomi's next single \\"Understanding\\" is affixed as a hidden track to the end of \\"Little More\\" („É™„Éà„É´„É¢„Ç¢) on these editions, which was subsequently released in full two weeks after the album. Its material re-appears on Hitomi's greatest hits album Self Portrait (2002), with four singles and an album track. The compilation charted at number one and Self Portrait was awarded Rock & Pop Album of the Year at the 16th Japan Gold Disc Awards.  Singles  \\"Inner Child\\" was released as the album's first single on April 18, 2001, nearly five months after Love Life (2000). It underperformed compared to Hitomi's previous singles; peaking at number sixteen and charting for five weeks, selling 51,000 copies in total. The music video features Hitomi performing in a balloon-enclosed space with foreign models working the microphone equipment; the balloons eventually lift to reveal Hitomi standing on a beach. \\"Inner Child\\" appeared in commercials for the Gunze brand Body Wild a month in advance, which became a topic as Hitomi was featured donning men's underwear. \\"Is it You?\\" was released on August 22, 2001, the same day as her Live Tour 2001 Love Life DVD. Despite this, \\"Is it You?\\" was a substantial improvement over its predecessor, peaking at number four and becoming Huma-rhythm's longest-charting and highest-selling single at nine weeks with 191,000 copies in total. Its music video features Hitomi in an ushanka traversing across a moonscape as she searches for a series of keys: one attached to a cherry blossom tree and one in a pool of water; she unlocks a room to free a caged bird before walking into the light herself. \\"Is it You?\\" was the theme song to the Fuji TV drama Shotgun Marriage, which began airing on July 2, 2001. Furthermore, the single's B-sides \\"Open Mind\\" and \\"Why?\\" re-appear on Huma-rhythm. \\"I Am\\" and \\"Innocence\\" were issued as a double A-side single on October 24, 2001. The release charted at number seven, spending six weeks on the Oricon with 96,000 copies sold. Hitomi is photographed with a baby monkey on her shoulder for its cover. \\"Innocence\\" received a video treatment which features an all-black clad Hitomi singing in an atrium, intercut with all-white scenes of her and a chimpanzee in a spacesuit. \\"I Am\\" was the opening theme to the latter half of Inuyasha's second season, appearing from episode 35 on July 16, 2001. \\"Innocence\\" was the image song for the Fuji TV coverage of the 28th Berlin Marathon, which aired on September 30, 2001. \\"Samurai Drive\\" was released on January 9, 2002, a month ahead of Huma-rhythm. It was promoted as the album's lead single, and became Hitomi's highest-peaking entry on the Oricon Weekly Singles chart ever at number three. Though spending only seven weeks on the chart and selling 146,000 copies, less than \\"Is it You?\\", \\"Samurai Drive\\" nonetheless became known as one of Hitomi's signature songs. A reviewer for CD Journal commented: \\"The title is samurai but the music and lyrics don‚Äôt sound Japanese?! [...] The CD jacket with the crazed maiko wearing a punkish kimono has quite the impact.\\"  Promotion and tour  Hitomi covered fifteen magazines from December 2001 to February 2002, including Popteen, Seventeen and An An. She held impromptu performances described as a \\"secret fashion show live circuit\\" around Shibuya, Harajuku, and Aoyama on January 15, 2002, where she performed in front of 30,000 people in total. From the weekend of February 2 to 3, 2001, Tower Records partnered with Hitomi to erect a large display in front of its nine-story Shibuya building. The design mimicked the covers of \\"Samurai Drive\\" and Huma-rhythm, featuring its \\"planet key point\\". Tickets for the Hitomi Live Tour 2002 Huma-Rhythm were made available on March 9, 2002. Hitomi embarked on its first date at the Ichiharashi City Hall (Â∏ÇÂéüÂ∏ÇÂ∏ÇÊ∞ë‰ºöÈ§®, Ichihara-shi Shimin Kaikan) on April 28, 2002, and continued with two dates each in Nagoya and Osaka. For a total of twenty-three performances, its final stop visited the Nippon Budokan on June 14, 2002, which was filmed. Its DVD release coincided with her Self Portrait compilation on September 4, 2002, which features a live recording of then-unreleased single \\"Flow\\" from the tour. The tour was subsequently broadcast on Wowow on October 9, 2002.  Critical performance  The album received positive remarks from critics at the time of its release. A writer for CD Journal noted, \\"She has a strong reputation not just as a singer but a female icon of the times. Ignoring the views of those around her, she decided to express her inner, personal struggles with her sixth album. The lively atmosphere here displays her humanity. The high quality is an accomplishment.\\" HMV opined, \\"Her sixth album has arrived with its feet firmly planted in the ground. It‚Äôs introspective and very much Hitomi throughout the fourteen tracks that create her world. It's a next level masterpiece. [...] She knows exactly what she wants to sing about, sounds she wants to make, and the collaboration with Watanabe Zentaro creates a world overflowing with blinding innocence. With this album she amply displays she not only is an opinion leader but has the ability to strongly lead the scene in Japan.\\"  Chart performance  According to SoundScan Japan, Huma-rhythm opened with 179,017 copies in its first week, charting at number one. The album held steady within the top five in its second and third week, and marked 387,818 copies in total before it dropped out of the top twenty in its sixth week. Similarly, the album debuted at number one on the Oricon Album Charts, charting for eight weeks and selling 520,940 copies in total at the end of 2002. It was the 28th highest-selling album of the year. Huma-rhythm peaked at number two on the Japan Top Albums chart according to the February 16, 2002, edition of Billboard magazine.

He refuses to take his fiancee Gilian (Eve Gray) along, but she decides to go anyway and report on the story for a rival paper.

His primary field of interest is The Philosophy of Religion. More recently, however, his work has concentrated on the philosophy of atheism, culminating in his authorship of The Atheist's Creed (2010), The Atheist's Primer (2012) and the projected Atheism for Beginners (due 2013).http://www.lutterworth.com Michael Palmer was educated at Lancing College (1958‚Äì1963), St John's College, Durham University (1964‚Äì67, 70-72), and McMaster University in Canada (1970‚Äì71). His doctorate - on the Theology of Paul Tillich - was supervised at Durham by a Tillich pupil, Professor John Heywood Thomas. After leaving university, Palmer taught for three years at Marlborough College in Wiltshire (1974‚Äì77) and it was here that he introduced Philosophy as a Sixth Form subject. 1977 Palmer was the recipient of the prestigious Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship, which enabled him to study at the University of Marburg in Germany. Here Palmer studied with Professor Carl-Heinz Ratschow - a friend of Tillich's - and it was he who saw to the publication of Palmer's first book, published by De Gruyter of Berlin: Paul Tillich's Philosophy of Art. Palmer's distinction as a Tillich scholar was crowned by his selection as the only English editor of the comprehensive six-volumed edition of Tillich's Main Works, published by de Gruyter in 1990. On his return to England in 1980 Palmer became the founding Head of the Department of Religion and Philosophy at The Manchester Grammar School, the first Department of its kind in the country.The Creation of this Department is described in the article 'Philosophy at Manchester Grammar School', Cogito, 3, No.1, 1989, pp. 72-76. Here Palmer initiated a compulsory Philosophy course for all Sixth Formers. This course was subsequently published by The Lutterworth Press in 1991 as Moral Problems, and it remains the most successful School philosophy textbook since the War, still widely in use.http://www.lutterworth.com/product_info.php?products_id=1280 Its companion volume, Moral Problems in Medicine, was published in 1999.http://www.lutterworth.com/product_info.php?products_id=1278 From 1991-1995 Palmer taught at the University of Bristol. Two sets of his lectures - Freud and Jung on Religion (1997) and The Question of God (2001) - were subsequently published by Routledge. In 2008 The Lutterworth Press published Palmer's two volumed work The Philosophy of Religion.http://www.lutterworth.com/product_info.php?products_id=1342 More recently Palmer has become best known for his work on Atheism, and in particular in 2010 for his book The Atheist's Creed.http://www.lutterworth.com/product_info.php?products_id=1358 His Credo, which stands at the beginning of this book, has attracted considerable publicity. It reads:- The Atheist's Creed, Cambridge, The Lutterworth Press, 2010 . An adapted edition of The Atheist's Creed, The Atheist's Primer has just been published by The Lutterworth Press (2012).http://www.lutterworth.com/product_info.php?products_id=1779 Another volume on atheism - Atheism for Beginners - is projected for 2013.

It is owned and driven by the national electricity company ZESA Holdings (Pvt) LTD. It was built in two stages and consists of 4 units of 120 MW each and 2 units of 220 MW each. Engineering Consultants, Merz & McLellan, were employed for the design and supervision of the construction of the power station. Construction of Stage 1 commenced in 1973, but was suspended in 1975 due to economic sanctions imposed on Rhodesia. Stage 1's units were commissioned from 1983 to 1986 with Stage 2's units following in 1986/87. A reliable source of water lies further north, in the Zambezi River. From there, through a 44 kilometre long pipeline, water for the Boilers and Cooling Towers is drawn by both high and low lift pumps to a storage reservoir located adjacent to the station and conveyed by gravity to the station. About 107,000 cubic meters of raw water can be provided per day; while the demineralisation plant has a capacity of 5,420 cubic metres per day. A 3.5 kilometre conveyor belt brings about 1,750 tonnes of coal per hour from the nearby Wankie colliery open cast mine, and 250,000 tonnes of coal are stockpiled on site. Coal reserves estimated to support 1,200 MW for an estimated 30 years are concealed beneath the vast expanse of the coal mine. Technical problems due to neglect of maintenance, part replacement and upgrading make the plant prone to frequent production stops. In 2009, Namibia's NamPower made agreements to help ZESA to revive the plant's capacity in exchange for power deliveries. The extensive problems are however continuing and have even led the government to considering a full close-down of the plant. In April 2008, Chadha Power of India secured a contract to refurbish four units at the power plant. In December 2015 China agreed to provide a $1.2 billion loan to add 600 MW of generating capacity to the Hwange stationZimbabwe: China promises $1.2bn loan for Hwange thermal power plant upgrade with two additional units.

Career Dana Knutson has had a long career as an artist on role- playing games. He worked at FASA for 10 years, producing art on numerous works for their Star Trek and Shadowrun RPGs. He came to work for TSR in 1993 to produce artwork for the Dungeons & Dragons game, initially largely with the Planescape line. He created the Lady of Pain from one of his doodles. David \\"Zeb\\" Cook, designer of Planescape, explained Knutson's role in developing the setting: \\"It was at this early stage that I had my biggest idea - I needed an artist. I could think and write about these things, but the setting needed a look. [...] Foolishly, people believed in me, and Dana Knutson was assigned to draw anything I wanted. I babbled, and he drew - buildings, streets, characters and landscapes. Before any of us knew it, he drew the Lady of Pain. I'm very fond of the Lady of Pain; she really locks up the Planescape look. We all liked her so much that she became our logo.\\" According to Shannon Appelcline, Planescape was \\"built around a strong artistic concept, thanks to Dana Knutson's conceptual art and Tony DiTerlizzi's final drawings\\". When TSR was purchased by Wizards of the Coast, he also illustrated cards for Magic: The Gathering.

This newspaper was notable for three reasons: 1\\\\. It used the then cutting-edge technology of photo-typesetting at a time when the old 'hot metal' process was the norm. 2\\\\. It was one of the few non-national newspapers to publish six days a week. 3\\\\. It was neither national nor local, but a regional newspaper covering three counties (Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire). From launch, the paper flourished and grew, attaining a circulation of over 90,000 copies per night at its peak. Background to launch Launched initially as two papers, the Evening Post and Evening Echo, it was an attempt by the Thomson Organization, then Britain's biggest newspaper group, to break the Beaverbrook and Northcliffe domination of the London-Home Counties evening paper market. Two other papers ‚Äì the Slough Evening Mail and the Reading Evening Post ‚Äì were part of this strategy. Lord (Roy) Thomson invested millions in the experiment, which he believed would profit from what he saw as huge advertising potential in prosperous communities north and west of London. His efforts were thwarted from the start by demands from the print unions, which insisted on unsustainable manning levels. Thomson management was less robust than it might have been because it feared union repercussions at Times Newspapers, publishers of the Times and Sunday Times. Journalists Many Fleet Street figures such as Peter Wright cut their teeth at the newspaper, which was edited in its early days by Ivor Lewis (former Sunday Times) and Richard Parrack, who was later to become a senior executive with News International. Other outstanding journalists worked on the Post-Echo in its heyday. They included Melanie Phillips (Daily Mail), Stephen Pile (Sunday Telegraph), David Francis (Mail on Sunday), Cliff Barr (The Sun, Daily Express), Lee Harrison and John Cathcart (National Enquirer), Anthony Holden (Sunday Times and The Observer), Maurice Chittenden (Sunday Times), Jean Ritchie (The Sun), Mark Milner (The Guardian),Michael Bilton ( Sunday Times ) and David Felton (The Independent). The Post-Echos assistant editor, John Marquis, who worked in London for both Reuters and Thomson Newspapers, became one of the few newspaper editors ever credited with bringing down a national government while editing The Tribune in Nassau, Bahamas, in 2007. While on the Post-Echo he won the Provincial Journalist of the Year award for exposing negligence at two hospitals. Melanie Phillips won the Young Journalist of the Year award the following year (1975). Former Worcestershire and Young England cricketer Ivan Johnson trained and worked as a reporter and news sub-editor on the Post-Echo. Bahamas-born Johnson went on to work as a staff sub-editor on The London Sun and the Daily Star. Johnson founded and launched The Punch newspaper, a bi- weekly London-style popular quality tabloid, in Nassau, Bahamas, in February 1990. Johnson is the editor, owner and publisher of The Punch newspaper. The Punch was credited with bringing down the Old PLP Government of the late Bahamas Prime Minister Sir Lynden Pindling in August 1992. The Punch is considered by many to be The Bahamas' most read and controversial newspaper. Several Post-Echo journalists became authors. Stephen Pile wrote The Book of Heroic Failures, Melanie Phillips the controversial Londonistan, Jean Ritchie a book about murderess Myra Hindley, and Ashley Walton The Duke of Hazard about Prince Philip. Anthony Holden became a biographer and also wrote a book about professional poker called Big Deal. John Marquis wrote Blood and Fire, about the famous murder of Sir Harry Oakes, and Papa Doc, about the Haitian dictator Fran√ßois Duvalier. Michael Bilton wrote books about the Falklands War, the My Lai Massacre and the Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper. Design and photography In its early days, the Post-Echo won many design awards, using offset printing to produce bold broadsheet pages with imaginative use of pictures. It regularly outshone its London rivals, the Evening News and Evening Standard, on the newsstands and was seen by many Fleet Street observers of the day as the future of newspapers. One of the Evening Post photographers, Alun John went on to become the award winning launch Picture Editor of The Independent. Famous articles and awards In 1973 it published a powerful and much-praised series of articles about the poisoner Graham Young which resulted in a book by Tony Holden called The St Albans Poisoner. He was one of a four-man investigation team led by Marquis, which included Lee Harrison and reporter Philip Smith, both of whom later worked on The National Enquirer in the United States. However, it was Marquis's hospitals investigation the following year which landed the Post-Echo its first major writing award, with Phillips taking her award 12 months later. Demise Despite its editorial excellence, the Post-Echo eventually bowed to the inexorable rise of freesheets and their demands on advertising revenue and the deep recession of the early 80s eventually saw its demise. It closed in 1983 with the loss of 470 jobs. At the time of its closure, the editor was Trevor Wade, who went on to edit the Reading Evening Post.

The Isle of Man is a self-governing British Crown dependency in the Irish Sea between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland. The island is about long and, at its widest, wide. It has been inhabited for over 8,500 years. The capital is Douglas. English is the main language spoken but the island has its own Manx language which is of Celtic origin. The Isle of Man parliament, known as Tynwald, is believed to be the oldest continuous parliamentary body in the world. The postal history of the island pre-dates introduction of the first postage stamps in 1840. The island used British stamps until 1958 when regional issues began. The Isle of Man Post Office was founded in 1973 to secure postal independence and, since then, the island has issued its own stamps. Postal history An Isle of Man Post Office employee with a sheet of stamps issued in 2015 to mark the 175th anniversary of the issue of the Penny Black. It is known that there was an official packet boat service between Whitehaven and Douglas after 1765 when the island was reclaimed by the British Crown, having been in private hands previously. The post office in Douglas was established as a sub-office of Whitehaven until 1822 when Douglas became a postal town in its own right after the packet boat service was transferred from Whitehaven to Liverpool. The earliest known handstamp from Douglas is dated c.1767. Handstamp markings were similar to those used in Great Britain except they were worded Isle of Man. A local Penny Post system was introduced in 1832 with additional receiving offices opening in Castletown, Peel and Ramsey. Like the rest of the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man began using British postage stamps on 6 May 1840. The island's postmark was a Maltese Cross to 1844 when Douglas office was allocated the numeral 407. In 1851, numerals 036 and 037 were allocated to Ramsey and Castletown respectively. During the two World Wars, the Isle of Man housed several prisoner-of-war camps and one of these, at Knockaloe, had a post office. The others all had cachets for transmission to Knockaloe. The Isle of Man was included in the North West Postal Region and continued to use British stamps until the first regional stamps were issued by the Royal Mail on 18 August 1958. They were a red twopence halfpenny and a lilac threepence, both featuring a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II encompassed by a Celtic ring chain. In common with UK practice, the stamps were not inscribed with the country's name but did depict the Manx triskelion to enable identification with the Isle of Man. Similar regional stamps for the same values were issued in Guernsey and Jersey. Other regionals were issued in each Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales but for a wider range of values. On 5 July 1973, postal independence was granted. The Isle of Man Post Office was created and began issuing its own stamps from that day. The first issue was a fifteen pence commemorative which depicted the Vikings landing on the island in 938. Campaign for postal independence The island's first stamps were issued approximately 50 years after campaigning for them had started. They had been perceived as promotional tools for the Manx identity. In the absence of stamps, postage labels ‚Äì some measuring ‚Äì were affixed over the rear flaps of envelopes. Campaigning for stamps in the 1920s led to the first official approaches to the General Post Office between 31 May and 5 June 1930 when the GPO laid the Island's first submarine telephone cable. The idea was rejected because of fears that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would want their own stamps too. To promote the fact that the Isle of Man was no longer isolated telephonically, therefore, Tynwald‚Äôs Publicity Board produced a postage label depicting a girl making a telephone call; the slogan, 'A Holiday Call from the Isle of Man'. The Island's first experimental airmail service was started by a Railway Air Services Dragon Rapide on 20 August 1934. This operated between Manchester and Belfast. Letters weighing less than were carried at no extra cost. The first regular airmail service from Liverpool was started on 1 February 1935 by Blackpool and West Coast Air Services Ltd. British postal strike The Island's first officially authorised postage stamps were issued during Britain's first postal strike (20 January ‚Äì 7 March 1971). Tourist souvenir supplier, Gordon Quirk, launched Post Manninagh on 20 January and was authorised on 27 January, though restricted to deliveries within the island. He adapted illustrated match box covers as stamps, guillotining from their edges words such as 'Foreign ‚Äì Average Contents 30'. Quirk's first authorised mail deliveries outside the island began on 1 February. His first specifically designed stamp was produced on 15 February. Others followed. Post Manninagh's first airmail service started on 1 March, six days before the strike ended. Isle of Man Post Office stamps After several years of negotiation, the Isle of Man Post Office Authority was launched on 5 July 1973. Spink and Son Ltd produced the first stamp essays but the Authority preferred to initiate its own designs. The Manx design was inspired by Isle of Man Art Society chairman, Victor Kneale, who had produced 18 designs to show what could be done. His membership of an advisory committee meant exclusion from being the official designer but when self-taught artist John Nicholson was appointed as designer what he produced reflected Kneale's proposals. Subsequently, Kneale would be the first chairman of Isle of Man Post and Nicholson would design the latter's first stamps.
