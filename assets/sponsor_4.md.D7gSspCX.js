Exothermic welding, also known as exothermic bonding, thermite welding (TW), and thermit welding, is a welding process that employs molten metal to permanently join the conductors. The process employs an exothermic reaction of a thermite composition to heat the metal, and requires no external source of heat or current. The chemical reaction that produces the heat is an aluminothermic reaction between aluminium powder and a metal oxide.  Overview  In exothermic welding, aluminium dust reduces the oxide of another metal, most commonly iron oxide, because aluminium is highly reactive. Iron(III) oxide is commonly used: :\\\\mathrm{Fe_2O_3 + 2 \\\\ Al \\\\longrightarrow 2 \\\\ Fe + Al_2O_3} The products are aluminium oxide, free elemental iron, and a large amount of heat. The reactants are commonly powdered and mixed with a binder to keep the material solid and prevent separation. Commonly the reacting composition is five parts iron oxide red (rust) powder and three parts aluminium powder by weight, ignited at high temperatures. A strongly exothermic (heat-generating) reaction occurs that via reduction and oxidation produces a white hot mass of molten iron and a slag of refractory aluminium oxide. The molten iron is the actual welding material; the aluminium oxide is much less dense than the liquid iron and so floats to the top of the reaction, so the set-up for welding must take into account that the actual molten metal is at the bottom of the crucible and covered by floating slag. Other metal oxides can be used, such as chromium oxide, to generate the given metal in its elemental form. Copper thermite, using copper oxide, is used for creating electric joints: :\\\\mathrm{3 \\\\ Cu_2O + 2 Al \\\\longrightarrow 6 \\\\ Cu + Al_2O_3} Thermite welding is widely used to weld railway rails. One of the first railroads to evaluate the use of thermite welding was the Delaware and Hudson Railroad in the United States in 1935\\"Welding Rails Together Takes Out Clicks\\", Popular Mechanics, October 1935. The weld quality of chemically pure thermite is low due to the low heat penetration into the joining metals and the very low carbon and alloy content in the nearly pure molten iron. To obtain sound railroad welds, the ends of the rails being thermite welded are preheated with a torch to an orange heat, to ensure the molten steel is not chilled during the pour. Because the thermite reaction yields relatively pure iron, not the much stronger steel, some small pellets or rods of high-carbon alloying metal are included in the thermite mix; these alloying materials melt from the heat of the thermite reaction and mix into the weld metal. The alloying beads composition will vary, according to the rail alloy being welded. The reaction reaches very high temperatures, depending on the metal oxide used. The reactants are usually supplied in the form of powders, with the reaction triggered using a spark from a flint lighter. The activation energy for this reaction is very high however, and initiation requires either the use of a \\"booster\\" material such as powdered magnesium metal or a very hot flame source. The aluminium oxide slag that it produces is discarded. When welding copper conductors, the process employs a semi-permanent graphite crucible mould, in which the molten copper, produced by the reaction, flows through the mould and over and around the conductors to be welded, forming an electrically conductive weld between them. When the copper cools, the mould is either broken off or left in place. Alternatively, hand-held graphite crucibles can be used. The advantages of these crucibles include portability, lower cost (because they can be reused), and flexibility, especially in field applications.  Properties  An exothermic weld has higher mechanical strength than other forms of weld, and excellent corrosion resistance It is also highly stable when subject to repeated short-circuit pulses, and does not suffer from increased electrical resistance over the lifetime of the installation. However, the process is costly relative to other welding processes, requires a supply of replaceable moulds, suffers from a lack of repeatability, and can be impeded by wet conditions or bad weather (when performed outdoors).  Applications  Exothermic welding is usually used for welding copper conductors but is suitable for welding a wide range of metals, including stainless steel, cast iron, common steel, brass, bronze, and Monel. It is especially useful for joining dissimilar metals. The process is marketed under a variety of names such as Harger ULTRASHOT, American Rail Weld, ERICO CADWELD, Quikweld, Tectoweld, Ultraweld, Techweld, TerraWeld, Thermoweld, Ardo Weld, AmiableWeld, AIWeld, FurseWeld, CADWELL TVT and Kumwell. Because of the good electrical conductivity and high stability in the face of short-circuit pulses, exothermic welds are one of the options specified by ¬ß250.7 of the United States National Electrical Code for grounding conductors and bonding jumpers. It is the preferred method of bonding, and indeed it is the only acceptable means of bonding copper to galvanized cable. The NEC does not require such exothermically welded connections to be listed or labelled, but some engineering specifications require that completed exothermic welds be examined using X-ray equipment.  Rail welding  Tram tracks being joined Tram tracks recently joined History Modern thermite rail welding was first developed by Hans Goldschmidt in the mid-1890s as another application for the thermite reaction which he was initially exploring for the use of producing high-purity chromium and manganese. The first rail line was welded using the process in Essen, Germany in 1899, and thermite welded rails gained popularity as they had the advantage of greater reliability with the additional wear placed on rails by new electric and high speed rail systems. Some of the earliest adopters of process were the cities of Dresden, Leeds, and Singapore. In 1904 Goldschmidt established his eponymous Goldschmidt Thermit Company (known by that name today) in New York City to bring the practice to railways in North America. In 1904, George E. Pellissier, an engineering student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute who had been following Goldschmidt's work, reached out to the new company as well as the Holyoke Street Railway in Massachusetts. Pellissier oversaw the first installation of track in the United States using this process on August 8, 1904, and went on to improve upon it further for both the railway and Goldschmidt's company as an engineer and superintendent, including early developments in continuous welded rail processes that allowed the entirety of each rail to be joined rather than the foot and web alone. Although not all rail welds are completed using the thermite process today, it still remains a standard operating procedure throughout the world today. Process Typically, the ends of the rails are cleaned, aligned flat and true, and spaced apart . This gap between rail ends for welding is to ensure consistent results in the pouring of the molten steel into the weld mold. In the event of a welding failure, the rail ends can be cropped to a gap, removing the melted and damaged rail ends, and a new weld attempted with a special mould and larger thermite charge. A two or three piece hardened sand mould is clamped around the rail ends, and a torch of suitable heat capacity is used to preheat the ends of the rail and the interior of the mould. The proper amount of thermite with alloying metal is placed in a refractory crucible, and when the rails have reached a sufficient temperature, the thermite is ignited and allowed to react to completion (allowing time for any alloying metal to fully melt and mix, yielding the desired molten steel or alloy). The reaction crucible is then tapped at the bottom. Modern crucibles have a self-tapping thimble in the pouring nozzle. The molten steel flows into the mould, fusing with the rail ends and forming the weld. The slag, being lighter than the steel flows last from the crucible and overflows the mould into a steel catch basin, to be disposed of after cooling. The entire setup is allowed to cool. The mould is removed and the weld is cleaned by hot chiselling and grinding to produce a smooth joint. Typical time from start of the work until a train can run over the rail is approximately 45 minutes to more than an hour, depending on the rail size and ambient temperature. In any case, the rail steel must be cooled to less than before it can sustain the weight of rail locomotives. When a thermite process is used for track circuits ‚Äì the bonding of wires to the rails with a copper alloy, a graphite mould is used. The graphite mould is reusable many times, because the copper alloy is not as hot as the steel alloys used in rail welding. In signal bonding, the volume of molten copper is quite small, approximately and the mould is lightly clamped to the side of the rail, also holding a signal wire in place. In rail welding, the weld charge can weigh up to . The hardened sand mould is heavy and bulky, must be securely clamped in a very specific position and then subjected to intense heat for several minutes before firing the charge. When rail is welded into long strings, the longitudinal expansion and contraction of steel must be taken into account. British practice sometimes uses a sliding joint of some sort at the end of long runs of continuously welded rail, to allow some movement, although by using a heavy concrete sleeper and an extra amount of ballast at the sleeper ends, the track, which will be prestressed according to the ambient temperature at the time of its installation, will develop compressive stress in hot ambient temperature, or tensile stress in cold ambient temperature, its strong attachment to the heavy sleepers preventing buckling or other deformation. Current practice is to use welded rails throughout on high speed lines, and expansion joints are kept to a minimum, often only to protect junctions and crossings from excessive stress. American practice appears to be very similar, a straightforward physical restraint of the rail. The rail is prestressed, or considered \\"stress neutral\\" at some particular ambient temperature. This \\"neutral\\" temperature will vary according to local climate conditions, taking into account lowest winter and warmest summer temperatures. The rail is physically secured to the ties or sleepers with rail anchors, or anti-creepers. If the track ballast is good and clean and the ties are in good condition, and the track geometry is good, then the welded rail will withstand ambient temperature swings normal to the region. Remote welding Remote exothermic welding is a type of exothermic welding process for joining two electrical conductors from a distance. The process reduces the inherent risks associated with exothermic welding and is used in installations that require a welding operator to permanently join conductors from a safe distance from the superheated copper alloy. The process incorporates either an igniter for use with standard graphite molds or a consumable sealed drop-in weld metal cartridge, semi-permanent graphite crucible mold, and an ignition source that tethers to the cartridge with a cable that provides the safe remote ignition.

She is sometimes called Carma and Carmabelle (her Instant Messaging username) or Carmeena in the book, and is a sensitive and caring half-Puerto Rican with a bad temper. Her parents are divorced, and she lives with her mother, Christina. She is the organized one, but sometimes she thinks too much. She is the one most insistent on keeping the sisters together through the Traveling Pants, which she first found. She is the \\"glue\\" keeping the Sisterhood together. She is portrayed by America Ferrera in the 2005 film adaptation of the first book, and the 2008 sequel, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2. Family Christina: Carmen has a close relationship with her mother, Christina, whom she has lived with since her parents' divorce. Carmen admits that she can be bratty with her mother, though Christina suggests this may be because she knows it is easier to get mad at people you love because you can trust them to still love you. Carmen can also be possessive of her mother and is worried both when Christina begins dating and when she gets pregnant. She does not want her mother to leave her. Albert: Carmen looks up to her father; she wanted to follow in his footsteps and go to Williams College. However, her parents' divorce hit her hard and she is initially concerned that his marrying Lydia was an attempt to replace her and Christina with a perfect, beautiful family. She resolves most of these issues in the first book and afterwards often calls her father for advice or guidance. David: Carmen's stepfather. She was originally hostile toward David when he began dating Christina because she thought her mother was making a fool of herself and rushing into the relationship too quickly. Though she doesn't develop a very close relationship with him, she admits that he makes her mother happy; her only complaint about him is that he is a workaholic. Lydia: Carmen's stepmother. Carmen does not know of her until she goes to stay with her dad during the first novel. She gets off on the wrong foot with her stepmother due to their many differences. Lydia is blonde, and a \\"Southern belle\\" who has a perfectly neat house and is very religious. Because of how different Lydia's lifestyle is from her mother's, Carmen is at first angry with Lydia and her father and feels she is being replaced. Later, she achieves a more civil relationship with her stepmother, especially after realizing that Lydia and Christina actually get along. Paul: Carmen's older stepbrother. Carmen gets along very well with Paul and admires his honesty and lack of egotism. She e-mails and phones him regularly. The books mention that Paul regards Carmen and her temper with a sort of awe, and never understands the motivations behind her insane outbursts. Carmen is originally nervous that if Paul falls in love with Lena, he will forget about her. However, after noticing how the two look at each other and how alike they are, she eventually encourages their relationship. She also keeps on talking to Lena about Paul. Krista: Carmen's younger stepsister. They originally talked very little as Krista's preppy, flaky, superficial attitude was very different from Carmen's explosive, colorful personality. She felt that since Krista was the direct opposite of her that her father was \\"upgrading.\\" After confronting her father about the issue, she and Krista get along much better. Krista grows to admire Carmen's independent attitude; in the second book, she runs away from home and seeks sanctuary with Carmen and Christina. Ryan: Carmen's younger half- brother. She is slightly bad-tempered about his birth and jealous of her mother's attention to him. Later, she gets over this, enjoys being a big sister and role model to him. Friends Carmen is the youngest member of the sisterhood. Lena Kaligaris, Tibby Rollins, and Bridget Vreeland are the other members of the sisterhood. She considers herself \\"the Puerto Rican with the bad temper\\" in the group. She also sees herself as \\"the glue\\" that keeps the friends together. Ann Brashares says that she believes Carmen gets the bigger picture of their friendship, whereas the other girls are more \\"in the moment.\\" Romantic Relationships Winthrop \\"Win\\" Sawyer: Carmen meets Win at the hospital with Lena's grandmother. She is initially attracted to him, and the two have several other chance meetings. Win is a volunteer at the hospital and is two years older. Carmen is initially worried that she is deceiving him, as he keeps catching her doing charitable things and is scared that he won't like her as much when he learns about her bad temper. She tells him about her worries, but he resolves that he likes her anyway and the two kiss in the hospital. She lets the relationship drop off on purpose due to confidence issues. Carmen also briefly dates a boy in the second book who had a massive crush on her, Porter, but she was too distracted by issues with her mother; Porter eventually decided that he was tired of being led on. She also maintained a flirtatious relationship with one of the actors she worked with in the fourth book. Their relationship is not focused on in this book, though it mentions that he often played with her hair, flirted with her, and kissed her before the play's opening night. This relationship is more prominent in the second movie. The Second Summer of the Sisterhood Christina starts to date a young attractive man named David. Carmen is jealous of the time she spends with him and also embarrassed because Christina's relationship is so passionate. She believes her mother is humiliating herself and falling in love too quickly. Carmen sabotages the relationship out of spite, but once she realizes how happy David makes her mother, she helps the two get together. A subplot during this book is Carmen's relationship with a boy, Porter, from her school. She goes on several dates with him but neglects him during each date due to her worries about her mother. Carmen is originally optimistic about the relationship because she has the Traveling Pants for their first date, but Porter becomes tired of Carmen \\"stringing him along\\" and stops dating her. On her final date with him, she brings Paul and a heartbroken Lena along. She notices how attracted Paul is to Lena and gives Lena the pants, encouraging her to go after Paul and Paul to see Lena. Girls in Pants: The Third Summer of the Sisterhood Carmen learns that Christina is pregnant with David's child. Carmen is originally hostile, believing that since the baby will be born just after she leaves for college that she is being replaced. Carmen also gets a job looking after Valia, Lena's grandmother, and meets a guy named Win 'Winthrop' at the hospital. She and Win maintain a flirtatious relationship, but she believes that she is deceiving him because he keeps catching her doing charitable things, and that he will be disappointed when he learns about her arguments with her mother. Carmen eventually realizes that since David works so much, she will have to be there for the child and makes amends with her mom. At the end of the book, Christina goes into labor four weeks early while David is away on business. Carmen and Win go hunting for David to bring him home. Meanwhile, Tibby helps Christina give birth. Carmen returns to the hospital where she meets her baby brother and tells Win that she doesn't think she deserves him. Win announces that it doesn't matter, and the two share a kiss. Forever in Blue: The Fourth Summer of the Sisterhood Carmen arrives at college where she falls into a sort of depression. She has let the relationship with Win drop off due to confidence issues. She gains weight and shrinks away from making new friends and from the sisterhood. She befriends a beautiful and sophisticated actress named Julia Beckwith; together, they go to a special acting camp. Carmen mistakenly auditions for the main play, although she originally tagged along only to be with Julia and work on sets. She wins the sought-after lead role in a play with several professional actors, and Julia becomes bad-tempered and surly. Julia tries to \\"help\\" Carmen with the part but really gives her bad advice in an attempt to sabotage an inexperienced Carmen. As a result, Carmen becomes depressed again, but finally realizes that Julia was not a friend to her because she fed off of Carmen's insecurities to boost her own confidence. Carmen stars in the play brilliantly and confronts Julia. Sisterhood Everlasting Carmen is a semi-successful actress in New York who is engaged (to a sometimes pretentious man her friends dislike). She is now obsessed with her work, worries about her wedding and her busy schedule. On her long trip to an audition, she meets a man named Roberto Moyo who is traveling with his two young children. Carmen befriends Roberto and is struck by his sad story, she also grows very fond of his kids. At the end of the book, Carmen breaks off her engagement. She is the only one of her friends who is not romantically involved with anyone; however, she is very satisfied with her life. She is very sad when Tibby died.

It is a resident breeder in central and southern Africa. This species is found in open, lightly wooded habitats, such as hillsides with trees or scrub and forest edges. In South Africa it occurs mainly in coastal areas, inhabiting coastal bush, shrubs along streams, gardens, and areas with rank vegetation. It is not truly migratory, but undertakes some seasonal movements. Taxonomy In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the brimstone canary in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected at the Cape of Good Hope. He used the French name Le gros-bec du Cap de Bonne Esp√©rance and the Latin Coccothraustes Capitis Bonae Spei. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the brimstone canary. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Loxia sulphurata and cited Brisson's work. The specific name sulphurata is Latin word for \\"sulphurated\\". The brimstone canary was subsequently placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the brimstone canary were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra which had been introduced in 1827 by the English ornithologist William John Swainson. Three subspecies are recognised: *C. s. sulphuratus is the nominate race of southwestern and southern Cape Province *C. s. wilsoni of eastern Cape Province to southern Mozambique is smaller, relatively smaller billed, and paler or more yellowish green than the nominate form. The underparts are entirely yellow. *C. s. sharpii of northern Mozambique to Kenya is smaller and paler or more yellowish green than the nominate form. Its bill size is intermediate between the other two races. Description C. s. sharpii The brimstone canary is 15‚Äì16 cm in length with a heavy bill, which is short, conical and very stout at the base. The bill is light brown with a pinkish or yellowish base. The legs and feet are pinkish- brown. It has yellow-green upper parts with dark green streaking, yellow-green ear coverts and malar stripe, and two yellow wing bars. The underparts are yellow, with a greenish wash on the flanks, and breast. The sexes are similar, but the male is brighter, with a bigger bill, better defined face pattern, brighter yellow wing bars and a greenish rump. Young birds are duller, greyer and less yellow below than the adults. The degree to which this bird is green or yellow varies considerably across regions. Southern birds are greener than northern birds, even within subspecies, notably with C. s. sharpii. For an overview of finch phylogeny (including canaries) see the entry on finches. The brimstone canary can be confused with the yellow-fronted canary, but that species is smaller billed with a much more defined head pattern and a bright yellow rump. The yellow canary, with overlapping range, is also a known confusion species. The call notes of the brimstone canary in the south of its range are a trilled, deeply pitched swirriwirrit or chirrup. The song is a jumble of chirps, whistles, warbles and trills, with the same deep pitch as the call. Northern birds have a faster, higher, less jumbled and more tuneful version of the song. Behaviour=Breeding The brimstone canary breeds from August to October. The nest is an open cup built from thin stems and other plant material and lined with plant down. It is placed in a leafy bush or a tree. Feeding The brimstone canary is less gregarious than other canaries. It tends to be found singly or in pairs, or occasionally in small groups, and is a common visitor to gardens. It feeds on fruit, seeds, flowers and shoots. Hard seed cases are cracked with the stout bill.

They were known as Gurjaras during the medieval times, a name which is believed to have been an ethnonym in the beginning as well as a demonym later on. Although traditionally they have been involved in agriculture (most famously, dairy and livestock farming), Gurjars are a large heterogeneous group that is internally differentiated in terms of culture, religion, occupation, and socio-economic status. The historical role of Gurjars has been quite diverse in society, at one end they have founded kingdom, districts, cities, towns, and villages, and at the other end, they are also nomads with no land of their own. The pivotal point in the history of Gurjar identity is often traced back to the emergence of a Gurjara kingdom in present-day Rajasthan during medieval times (around 570 CE). It is believed that the Gurjars migrated to different parts of the Indian Subcontinent from the Gurjara kingdom. Previously, it was believed that the Gurjars did an earlier migration from Central Asia as well, however, that view is generally considered to be speculative. Historical references speak of Gurjara warriors and commoners in North India in the 7th century CE, and mention several Gurjara kingdoms and dynasties. The Gurjaras started fading way from the forefront of history after 10th century CE. Thereafter, several Gurjar chieftains and upstart warriors are mentioned in history, who were rather petty rulers in contrast to their predecessors. The modern forms \\"Gurjar\\" and \\"Gujjar\\" were quite common during the Mughal era, and documents dating from the period mention Gurjars as a \\"turbulent\\" people. The Indian states of Gujarat and Rajasthan were known as Gurjaradesa and Gurjaratra for centuries prior to the arrival of the British power. The Gujrat and Gujranwala districts of Pakistani Punjab have also been associated with Gujjars from as early as the 8th century CE, when there existed a Gurjara kingdom in the same area. The Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh was also known as Gujarat previously, due to the presence of many Gujjar zamindars, or land holding farmer class, in the area. Gurjars are linguistically and religiously diverse. Although they are able to speak the language of the region and country where they live, Gurjars have their own language, known as Gujari. They variously follow Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism. The Hindu Gurjars are mostly found in Indian states of Rajasthan, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab Plains and Maharashtra. Muslim Gujjars are mostly found in Punjab, Pakistan where they make up 20% of the population, mainly concentrated in Northern Punjabi cities of Gujranwala, Gujrat, Gujar Khan, Jehlum and Lahore, Afghanistan and Indian Himalayan regions such as Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Garhwal and Kumaon divisions of Uttarakhand. The Gurjars are classified as Other Backward Class (OBC) in some of India's States and UTs; in Jammu and Kashmir and some parts of Himachal Pradesh they are categorised as a Scheduled Tribe. Hindu Gurjars were assimilated into various varnas in the medieval period.  Etymology  The word Gurjar represents a modern caste group in India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, locally referred to as jati, zaat, qaum or biradari The history of the word Gurjar can be confidently traced back to an ancient ethnic and tribal identity called Gurjara, which became prominent after the collapse of Gupta Empire. A literal or definitive meaning of the word Gurjara is not available in any of the historical references. The oldest reference to the word Gurjara is found in the book called Harshacharita (Harsha's Deeds), a biography of king Harshavardhana written around 630 CE. Banabhatta, the author of Harshacharita, mentions that Harsha's father Prabhakravardhana (560-580 CE) was \\"a constant threat to the sleep of Gurjara\\"‚Äîapparently a reference to the Gurjara king or kingdom. Inscriptions from a collateral branch of Gurjaras, known as Gurjaras of Lata, claim that their family was ruling Bharakucha (Bharuch) as early as 450 CE from their capital at Nandipuri. Based on these early dates, it has been proposed by some authors that Gurjara identity might have been present in India as early as the 3rd century CE, but it became prominent only after the fall of Guptas. It has been suggested by several historians that Gurjara was initially the name of a tribe or clan which later evolved into a geographical and ethnic identity following the establishment of a janapada (tribal kingdom) called 'Gurjara'. This understanding has introduced an element of ambiguity regarding ancient royal designations containing the word 'gurjara' such as 'gurjaraeshvara' or 'gurjararaja', as now its debatable whether the kings bearing these epithets were tribal or ethnic Gurjaras. A study by Gujjar Scholar Javaid Rahi on the origin of the word Gurjar suggested that 'Gujjar' is the same word as Turkish ' G√∂√ßer' (nomad), and that Gurjar or Gurjara are its Sanskritized forms. He revealed that some part of the Gujjar tribe, presently known as Konar-G√∂√ßer and G√∂√ßer Arƒ±cƒ±lƒ±k still exits in Turkey. The word 'Gurjara' is often traced by historians from groups that invaded India in early medieval times, such as Khazars also known as Guzars, or Kushans also known as Gaussuras. Some Indian historians, especially of a nationalistic orientation, argue that there is nothing in the historical records to suggest that Gurjaras had a foreign origin, as even the earliest members of this group were steeped in Indian religion and culture.  History = Origin  Historians and anthropologists differ on the issue of Gurjar origin. According to one view, the ancient ancestors of Gurjars came from central Asia via Georgia from near the Caspian Sea; that Sea's alternate name of the Bahr-e-Khizar caused the tribe to be known as Khizar, Guzar, Gujur, Gurjara, or Gujjar. According to this view, between 1 BCE and 1 CE, the ancient ancestors of Gurjars came in multiple waves of migration and they were initially accorded status as high- caste warriors in the Hindu fold in the North-Western regions (modern Rajasthan and Gujarat). Aydogdy Kurbanov states that some Gurjars, along with people from northwestern India, merged with the Hephthalites to become the Rajput clan. According to scholars such as Baij Nath Puri, the Mount Abu (ancient Arbuda Mountain) region of present-day Rajasthan had been an abode of the Gurjars during the medieval period. The association of the Gurjars with the mountain is noticed in many inscriptions and epigraphs including Tilakamanjari of Dhanpala. These Gurjars migrated from the Arbuda mountain region and as early as in the 6th century A.D., they set up one or more principalities in Rajasthan and Gujarat. The whole or a larger part of Rajasthan and Gujarat had been long known as Gurjaratra (country ruled or protected by the Gurjars) or Gurjarabhumi (land of the Gurjars) for centuries prior to the Mughal period. In Sanskrit texts, the ethnonym has sometimes been interpreted as \\"destroyer of the enemy\\": gur meaning \\"enemy\\" and ujjar meaning \\"destroyer\\"). In its survey of The People of India, the Anthropological Survey of India (AnSI) ‚Äì a government-sponsored organisation ‚Äì noted that Irawati Karve, the Indologist and historian, believed that the Gurjars position in society and the caste system generally varied from one linguistic area of India to another. In Maharashtra, Karve thought that they were probably absorbed by the Rajputs and Marathas but retained some of their distinct identity. She based her theories on analysis of clan names and tradition, noting that while most Rajputs claim their origins to lie in the mythological Chandravansh or Suryavansh dynasties, at least two of the communities in the region claimed instead to be descended from the Agnivansh. A 2009 study conducted by Tribal Research and Cultural Foundation, under the supervision of Gurjar scholar Javaid Rahi, claimed that the word \\"Gojar\\" has a Central Asian Turkic origin, written in romanized Turkish as G√∂√ßer. The study claimed that according to the new research, the Gurjar race \\"remained one of the most vibrant identity of Central Asia in BC era and later ruled over many princely states in northern India for hundred of years.\\"  British rule  In the 18th century, several Gurjar chieftains and small kings were in power. During the reign of Rohilla Nawab Najib-ul-Daula, Rao Dargahi Singh Bhati, the Gurjar chieftain of Dadri possessed 133 villages at a fixed revenue of Rs. 29,000. A fort in Parikshitgarh in Meerut district, also known as Qila Parikishatgarh, is ascribed to a Gurjar king Nain Singh Nagar. During the revolt of 1857, the Gurjars of Chundrowli rose against the British, under the leadership of Damar Ram. The Gurjars of Shunkuri village, numbering around three thousand, joined the rebel sepoys. According to British records, the Gurjars plundered gunpowder and ammunition from the British and their allies. In Delhi, the Metcalfe House was sacked by Gurjar villagers from whom the land was taken to erect the building. The British records claim that the Gurjars carried out several robberies. Twenty Gurjars were reported to have been beheaded by Rao Tula Ram for committing dacoities in July 1857. in In September 1857, the British were able to enlist the support of many Gurjars at Meerut. The colonial authors always used the code word \\"turbulent\\" for the castes who were generally hostile to British rule. They cited proverbs that appear to evaluate the caste in an unfavorable light. A British administrator, William Crooke, described that Gurjars seriously impeded the operations of the British Army before Delhi.Everyday life in South Asia By Diane P. Mines, Sarah Lamb, Published by Indiana University Press, 2002, pp.206 Reporter Meena Radhakrishna believe that the British classified the Gurjars along with others as \\"criminal tribes\\" because of their active participation in the revolt of 1857, and also because, they considered these tribes to be prone to criminality in the absence of legitimate means of livelihood.  Culture = Afghanistan  Gurjar children in Afghanistan, 1984 Small pockets of Gurjars are found in Afghanistan's northeastern region, particularly in and around the Nuristan province.  India  Today, the Gurjars are classified under the Other Backward Class category in some states in India. However, in Jammu and Kashmir and parts of Himachal Pradesh, they are designated as a Scheduled Tribe under the Indian government's reservation program of positive discrimination. Hindu Gurjars were assimilated into several varnas. = Haryana = The Gurjar community in Haryana has set elaborate guidelines for solemnizing marriages and holding other functions. In a mahapanchayat (\\"the great panchayat\\"), the Gurjar community decided that those who sought dowry would be excommunicated from the society. = Rajasthan = Fairs of Shri Devnarayan Bhagwan are organized two times in a year at Demali, Maalasheri, Asind and Jodhpuriya Sri Sawai Bhoj Bagaravat, one of the 24 Gurjar brothers collectively known as Bagaravats, at Dev Dham Jodhpuriya temple. Songs pertaining to Krishna and Gurjars were documented in Gurjar-inhabited areas during the British Raj, the connection being that Nand Mihir, the foster- father of Krishna, is claimed to be a Gurjar. Radha, the consort of Krishna, was also a Gurjar. The Rajasthani Gurjars worship the Sun God, Devnarayan (an avatar of Vishnu), Shiva and Bhavani. In Rajasthan, some members of the Gurjar community resorted to violent protests over the issue of reservation in 2006 and 2007. During the 2003 election to the Rajasthan assembly, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) promised them ST status. However, the party failed to keep its promise after coming to the power, resulting in protests by the Gurjars in September 2006. In May 2007, during violent protests over the reservation issue, members of the Gurjar community clashed with the police. Subsequently, the Gurjars protested violently, under various groups including the Gurjar Sangarsh Samiti, Gurjar Mahasabha and the Gurjar Action Committee. The protestors blocked roads and set fire to two police stations and some vehicles. Presently, the Gurjars in Rajasthan are classified as Other Backward Classes. On 5 June 2007, Gurjars rioted over their desire to be added to the central list of tribes who are given preference in India government job selection as well as placement in the schools sponsored by the states of India. This preference is given under a system designed to help India's poor and disadvantaged citizens. However, other tribes on the list oppose this request as it would make it harder to obtain the few positions already set aside. In December 2007, the Akhil Bhartiya Gurjar Mahasabha (\\"All-India Gurjar Council\\") stated that the community would boycott BJP, which is in power in Rajasthan. But now in 2009 all Gurjars were supporting BJP so that they can be politically benefitted. Kirori Singh Bainsla fought and lost at BJP ticket. In early 2000s (decade), the Gurjar community in Dang region of Rajasthan was also in news for the falling sex ratio, unavailability of brides, and the resulting polyandry. = Madhya Pradesh = , the Gurjars in Madhya Pradesh are classified as Other Backward Classes. = Maharashtra = Dode Gujars and Dore Gujars are listed as Other Backward Classes in Maharashtra. = Gujarat = Gurjars are one of the 6 main carpenter (Suthar) castes of Gujarat, and are believed to be of Central Asian descent. They are listed among the Other Backward Classes of Gujarat. The Kutch Gurjar Kshatriya (also known as Mistri) and Gurjar Kshatriya Kadia are minority communities of Gujarat which are listed among the Other Backward Classes of Gujarat. A few scholars believe that the Leva Kunbis (or Kambis) of Gujarat, a section of the Patidars, are possibly of Gurjar origin. However, several others state that the Patidars are Kurmis or Kunbis (Kanbis); Gurjars are included in the OBC list in Gujarat but Patidars are not. The Gurjars are a subtype of Kumhar and Prajapati community of Gujarat and are listed among the Other Backward Classes of Gujarat. Gurjars of North Gujarat, along with those of Western Rajasthan and Punjab, worship Sitala and Bhavani. = Himachal Pradesh = , the Gurjars in parts of Himachal Pradesh were classified as a Scheduled Tribe. = Jammu and Kashmir = Gujjars, Bakerwals tribes of Jammu and Kashmir were declared Scheduled Tribe (ST) in 1991. In the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, the concentration of Gurjars is observed in all but largely found in Rajouri, Poonch, Reasi, Kishtwar district and, followed by, Anantnag, Udhampur and Doda districts. It is believed that Gurjars migrated to Jammu and Kashmir from Gujarat (via Rajasthan) and Hazara district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. , the Gurjars and the Bakarwals in Jammu and Kashmir were classified as Scheduled Tribes constitute 12% of the total population of Jammu and Kashmir but Gujjars / Bakerwal claim that they constitute more than 20%, as when the Census held in, 2001 and 2011, more than 50% of their population is in upper reaches of Himalaya in connection with by annual tribal migrations and accordingly seek special census of tribal. According to 2011 Census of India, Gurjar is the most populous scheduled tribe in J&K;, having a population of 1493299 . Around 99.3 percent population of Gurjar and Bakarwal in J&K; follow Islam. The Gurjars of Jammu and Kashmir in 2007 demanded to treat this tribal community as a linguistic minority in the State and provide constitutional safeguards to their language Gojri. They also impressed upon the state government to take up the matter with Delhi for inclusion of Gojri in the list of official languages of India. In 2002, some Gurjars and Bakarwals in J&K; demanded a separate state (Gujaristan) for Gurjar and Bakarwal communities, under the banner of All India Gurjar Parishad. = Uttarakhand - Van Gurjars = The Van Gurjars (\\"forest Gurjars\\") are found in the Shivalik hills area of Uttarakhand. The Van Gurjars follow Islam, and they have their own clans, similar to the Hindu gotras. They are a pastoral semi-nomadic community, practising transhumance. In the winter season, the Van Gurjars migrate with their herds to the Shivalik foothills, and in summer, they migrate to pastures high up in the mountains. The Van Gurjars have had conflicts with the forest authorities, who prohibited human and livestock populations inside a reserved park, and blamed the Van Gurjar community for poaching and timber smuggling. After the creation of the Rajaji National Park (RNP), the Van Gurjars in Deharadun were asked to shift to a resettlement colony at Pathri near Haridwar. In 1992, when they returned to the foothills, the RNP authorities tried to block them from the park area. The community fought back and finally the forest authorities had to relent.  Pakistan  Gujjars are a major tribe in Pakistan and compromise as much as twenty percent of the country's population. Several cities in Punjab, Pakistan are named after them including Gujranwala, Gujar Khan and Gujrat. Due to migrations, large Gujjar population can also be found in Islamabad, Sialkot, Lahore and Faisalabad. Majority of Gujjars in Pakistan speak Punjabi. Punjabi Gujjars typically use the prefix Chaudhry as a courtesy title.

Events An attempted appeal, asserting that a noise had caused him to make the mistake, was dismissed, ending his chance to defend the 400 m Olympic title. This prompted widespread debate, with former swimmer Shane Gould asserting that the selection policy should be relaxed to maximise Australia's chances by selecting Thorpe, while Talbot, head coach Leigh Nugent and Kieren Perkins defended the selection policy. Public debate was also widespread, with Prime Minister of Australia John Howard describing the situation as a \\"tragedy\\". Despite the intense media spotlight, Thorpe won the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events in times of 48.83s and 1 min 45.07s respectively to ensure his selection for Athens. Craig Stevens, who had claimed the second qualifying position in the 400 m event, subsequently faced immense public pressure to relinquish his position to Thorpe, with The Australians front-page headline reading \\"Only one man can come to the rescue\\". Although Thorpe said that Stevens should not be pressured into stepping aside, he was also criticised by columnists who felt that he was implicitly pressuring Stevens, for not unequivocally ruling himself out. Stevens later relinquished the position, in an interview with the Seven Network, who paid him A$130,000 for the rights to broadcast his announcement. This generated ethical debate as to whether Stevens had made a decision in the national interest or sold Thorpe a gold medal, with The Sydney Morning Heralds headline reading \\"It's your race, Ian, at $325 a metre\\". Thorpe accepted the position and was further attacked by Perkins, who described the affair as \\"grubby\\" and \\"a very, very sad tale for Australian sport\\", saying the pressure put upon Stevens was \\"disgusting\\".Hunter (2004), pp. 354‚Äì359.

When the post was redesignated as Camp Drum in 1951, parts of the hospital remained in order to support the reserve training mission of the installation. At that time, the facility was called the U.S. Army Health Clinic, Camp Drum, and staffed by military personnel and a civilian nurse. The facility provided medical support for the installation until the Wilcox Health Clinic was dedicated in November 1980. During the 1980s, the clinic expanded to support the 10th Mountain Division when it was reactivated at Fort Drum in 1985. In 1987, the clinic became a United States Army Medical Department Activity (USA MEDDAC), and construction began on the Consolidated Troop Medical Clinic and an Ambulatory Health Clinic. Guthrie Ambulatory Health Care Clinic opened in January 1991, and in May was dedicated to the memory of Dr. Samuel Guthrie (U.S. physician). The clinic today is unique in that it supports an Army division but has no inpatient capabilities. Its 35,000 beneficiaries receive emergency and inpatient care at local civilian hospitals. Routine care is provided at the main clinic, the Conner Troop Medical Clinic, and the Wilcox Health Clinic. The lack of inpatient care is mainly for political reasons; it was believed that several established hospitals in the area would lose too many patients to a military-run facility.

MacDonald (born 21 February 1959) is a Scottish businessman, best known for his work within the Scottish tartan industry as owner of Houston Traditional Kiltmakers, Paisley. He currently serves as a Vice Chairman of the Scottish Tartans Authority and Deacon of the Incorporation of Weavers of Glasgow. Early life Ken MacDonald was born on 21 February 1959 in Paisley to Hugh Lawson MacDonald and Eileen Douglas MacDonald (n√©e Houston). MacDonald was educated at Dardenne Preparatory School, Kilmacolm and then Keil School, Dumbarton before, at the age of 16, joining the family business Wm Houston Gentlemen‚Äôs Outfitters now known as Houston Traditional Kiltmakers in Paisley, Scotland. Houston Kiltmakers are world-renowned as a leading authority of all Scottish highland wear and etiquette. Business career W M Houston Gentlemen‚Äôs Outfitters was founded in 1909 by Mr William Houston of Paisley, the grandfather of Ken. The business was originally purchased by the Houston family in 1924 with only 2 shillings and sixpence in the till. The Shop operated for over 50 years as a traditional gentlemen‚Äôs outfitter, providing gentlemen of the day with pinstripe suits and bowler hats. Since then, the Houston and then MacDonald families have evolved and grown the business in Paisley, where the business is located. After entering the family business, in 1975, MacDonald built up its reputation as a leading retailer of quality menswear. In 1986 he became Scottish Chairman of the Menswear Association of Britain, In 1988 he was responsible for designing the Glasgow Garden Festival staff uniform and retailed on the festival site. MacDonald later incorporated the uniform colours of grey, yellow and red into the Glasgow's Miles Better tartan. Kilts in this tartan were made for Prince William and Prince Harry and presented by him to Charles, Prince of Wales. Other noted tartans designed by MacDonald include the Bute Heather tartan collection which was registered with the Scottish Register of Tartans in 2004. The range includes the variations on Bute Heather colours, all woven on the Isle of Bute. MacDonald famously designed the American National Tartan which was presented to George W. Bush from the people of Scotland to the people of America to commemorate Tartan day. Aside from his role in the highland wear industry, MacDonald is a Director of Paisley First (Business Improvement District), and past member of the Paisley Vision Board whose remit was to lead the regeneration of Paisley town centre. He is serving his second term as Deacon of the Incorporation of Weavers Glasgow, a role which he took up in November 2014 Today Ken MacDonald runs the business, the 3rd generation of the MacDonald family to operate the business. Houston‚Äôs handmade kilts are all produced in Scotland and shipped around the world to the USA, Japan, Indian and Australia as well as servicing the domestic market in Scotland, the UK and Europe. Ken is a leading authority on Highlandwear, tartans and tailoring. He has over 40 years of experience working directly with all the main Scottish tartan mills, sporran suppliers and many other expert manufactures. His knowledge in the industry is unparalleledand many hold Ken as one of the leading authorities. Ken is also Vice Chairman of the Scottish Tartan Authority which advises all aspects of tartan and retailers worldwide. The STA's main aims is to implement an international tartan centre and to introduce a quality/authenticity mark on all Scottish Woven Tartans in order to preserve, promote and protect Scottish tartans for future generations.

Located at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, south of Washington D.C., the hospital is part of an integrated health care system under the National Capital Region Medical Directorate (NCR MD) (formerly Joint Task Force National Capital Region Medical (JTF CapMed)) providing health care to members of the United States Armed Forces and their families. The $1.03 billion, 1.3 million-square-foot facility replaced DeWitt Army Community Hospital located on Fort Belvoir and integrated various aspects of the former Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, D.C., officially in August 2011 in accordance with 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Law. History The former DeWitt Army Community Hospital at Fort Belvoir, Va., which Fort Belvoir Community Hospital replaced, was named in honor of Brigadier General Wallace DeWitt, Sr., (1878‚Äì1949), a surgeon who served in World War I and World War II. The DeWitt Army Community Hospital opened in 1957, having cost $4.5 million to construct. It was the second of nine hospitals planned by the Army during the building program following the Korean War. DeWitt was a 46-bed Joint Commission-accredited facility and the only military inpatient facility in Northern Virginia. It was the center of the DeWitt Health Care Network, which featured the Andrew Rader Army Health Clinic at Fort Myer, Fort A.P. Hill, and the Family Health Centers of Woodbridge and Fairfax in Virginia. As part of a Base Realignment and Closure announcement on May 13, 2005, the Department of Defense proposed closing Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) and merging it with the National Naval Medical Center located in Bethesda, MD, and DeWitt Army Community Hospital. Moving nearly half of Walter Reed's services to DeWitt would greatly expand the hospital's mission. In November 2007, ground was broken on Fort Belvoir's South Post golf course for the new Fort Belvoir Community Hospital. As part of the effort to transform service specific medical facilities into joint service facilities, Fort Belvoir Community Hospital's staff includes Army, Navy, and Air Force medical personnel, making it one of the first joint medical facilities within the Department of Defense. Structure The modern, 120-bed facility was designed by HDR, Inc. and incorporates natural elements and themes. Fort Belvoir's new hospital has a seven-story main structure, flanked on each side by two outpatient clinic areas providing both primary and specialty care. In total, it consists of five total buildings, 3500 parking spaces, 44 clinics, expanded pharmacy services, 430 exam rooms, 10 operating rooms, two DaVinci surgical systems, two linear accelerator cancer/oncology systems, and one of the military's only dedicated substance abuse programs. Inpatient services were tripled in volume over the old hospital, and the expanded outpatient specialty care center offers services as a more local and convenient alternative than Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, which is located over 30 miles away on congested highways. The hospital incorporates evidence-based design principles in its treatment approach. Visits/Capacity Department of Defense officials project the eligible beneficiary population will increase to more than 220,000 with approximately 40 percent of the expanded health care system enrolled population consisting of retirees and their family members. The anticipated outpatient workload is expected to grow to more than 600,000 visits per year in primary, specialty and ancillary clinics. Selected specialty clinics such as Cardiology, Medical Oncology, Pulmonary, Radiation Oncology and Urology alone will generate approximately 54,000 appointments per year. The hospital's Labor and Delivery service delivered 104 babies in its first month of operations.

There are three distinct ways that precipitation can occur. Convective precipitation is generally more intense, and of shorter duration, than stratiform precipitation. Orographic precipitation occurs when moist air is forced upwards over rising terrain, such as a mountain. Precipitation can fall in either liquid or solid phases, or transition between them at the freezing level. Liquid forms of precipitation include rain and drizzle and dew. Rain or drizzle which freezes on contact within a subfreezing air mass gains the preceding adjective \\"freezing\\", becoming known as freezing rain or freezing drizzle. Frozen forms of precipitation include snow, ice crystals, ice pellets (sleet), hail, and graupel. Their respective intensities are classified either by rate of fall, or by visibility restriction. Phases Precipitation falls in many forms, or phases. They can be subdivided into: * Liquid precipitation: ** Drizzle (DZ) ** Rain (RA) ** Cloudburst (CB) * Freezing precipitation: ** Freezing drizzle (FZDZ) ** Freezing rain (FZRA) ** Rain and snow mixed / Slush (RASN) ** Drizzle and snow mixed / Slush (DASN) * Frozen precipitation: ** Snow (SN) ** Snow grains (SG) ** Ice crystals (IC) ** Ice pellets / Sleet (PL) ** Snow pellets / Graupel (GS) ** Hail (GR) ** Megacryometeor (MC) The parenthesized letters are the METAR codes for each phenomenon.  Mechanisms  Precipitation occurs when local air becomes saturated with water vapor, and can no longer maintain the level of water vapor in gaseous form. This occurs when less dense moist air cools, usually when an air mass rises through the atmosphere. However, an air mass can also cool without a change in altitude (e.g. through radiative cooling, or ground contact with cold terrain). Convective precipitation occurs when air rises vertically through the (temporarily) self-sustaining mechanism of convection. Stratiform precipitation occurs when large air masses rise diagonally as larger-scale atmospheric dynamics force them to move over each other. Orographic precipitation is similar, except the upwards motion is forced when a moving air mass encounters the rising slope of a landform such as a mountain ridge.  Convectional  A violent electrical storm results from convective cumulonimbus clouds. Convection occurs when the Earth's surface, especially within a conditionally unstable or moist atmosphere, becomes heated more than its surroundings and in turn leading to significant evaporation. Convective rain and light precipitation are the result of convective clouds, for example cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus. In the initial stages of this precipitation, it generally falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited vertical and horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective; however, it has been suggested that stratiform and convective precipitation often both occur within the same complex of convection-generated cumulonimbus.B. Geerts. Convective and stratiform rainfall in the tropics. Retrieved on 2007-11-27. Graupel and hail indicate convection; when either are present at the surface, it is indicative that some form of precipitation is extant at the freezing level, a varying point in the atmosphere in which the temperature is 0¬∞C.Glossary of Meteorology. Graupel. Retrieved on 2009-01-02. In mid-latitude regions, convective precipitation is often associated with cold fronts where as it is often found behind the front, occasionally initiating a squall line.  Cyclonic  A weather front is the boundary of two air masses Frontal precipitation is the result of frontal systems surrounding extratropical cyclones or lows, which form when warm and tropical air meets cooler air. Frontal precipitation typically falls out of nimbostratus clouds. When masses of air with different densities (moisture and temperature characteristics) meet, the less dense warmer air overrides the more dense colder air. The warmer air is forced to rise and, if conditions are right, creates an effect of saturation, causing precipitation. In turn, precipitation can enhance the temperature and dewpoint contrast along a frontal boundary. Passing weather fronts often result in sudden changes in environmental temperature, and in turn the humidity and pressure in the air at ground level. Warm fronts occur where warm air pushes out a previously extant cold air mass. The warm air overrides the cooler air and moves upward dud . Warm fronts are followed by extended periods of light rain and drizzle due to the fact that, after the warm air rises above the cooler air (which remains on the ground), it gradually cools due to the air's expansion while being lifted, which forms clouds and leads to precipitation. Cold fronts occur when a mass of cooler air dislodges a mass of warm air. This type of transition is sharper, since cold air is more dense than warm air. Precipitation duration is often shorter and generally more intense than that which occurs ahead of warm fronts. A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass.  Orographic  Orographic precipitation occurs when moist air is forced upwards by terrain. Orographic or relief rainfall is caused when masses of air are forced up the side of elevated land formations, such as large mountains (often referred to as an upslope effect). The lift of the air up the side of the mountain results in adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward (downwind) side.

It lies immediately south of the suburb of Forrestdale, and south-east of Jandakot Airport. It is a still largely natural wetland, with some adjoining native vegetation, surrounded by land developed for housing and agriculture, that regularly supports large numbers of shorebirds and other waterbirds. History and recognition=Traditional usage Before European settlement the lake was used by Aboriginal people as an important site for tortoise hunting, with campsites occupied for long periods. It is associated with the Waugal, a powerful and important water serpent in Noongar mythology that created rivers and lakes, and maintains the flow of waters to its resting places. European settlement The first non-Aboriginal settlement occurred in 1885, when William and Alfred Skeet were granted a 'Special Occupation' license for adjoining the lake, as well as licences to cut and sell timber. Farming around the lake began in 1893; much of the land was cleared, crops were trialled along with dairy and poultry farming. By 1898, the area around the lake had been set aside for a township with recommendations made for its subdivision. The Jandakot region started producing vegetables, apiary products and dairy produce for the Fremantle markets. From the 1920s agriculture gave way to sheep and cattle grazing, which continued through the next 50 years. During the 1940s the west side of the lake was heavily grazed by livestock, particularly during the drier summers when the lake's fringing vegetation served as supplementary fodder. As a result, the land on the west side of the lake lacks native understorey plants and is infested with introduced plants such as arum lilies. The lake was gazetted as an A-class Nature Reserve in 1957 for the protection of flora and fauna, as well as for recreation, particularly sailing. The population in the Forrestdale area increased rapidly in the late 1960s as the townsite blocks to the north-west of the lake were taken up. Since then the population has gradually increased to about 1350. Protection Originally Lake Jandakot, it was renamed Forrestdale in 1973. It was listed on the Commonwealth Register of the National Estate in March 1978. With the similar Thomsons Lake to the west, it forms the Forrestdale and Thomsons Lakes Ramsar Site, designated under the Ramsar Convention on 7 June 1990 and recognising it as a wetland of international importance. In 1998 the purpose of the reserve was changed to simply \\"Conservation of Flora and Fauna\\". It is registered as Nature Reserve 24781, vested in the Conservation Commission of Western Australia and managed by the Department of Conservation and Land Management. It is mainly used for birdwatching, nature walks, horse riding and general recreation by surrounding residents. Description Forrestdale Lake is a shallow, brackish, seasonal lake with a large area of open water when full. It has extensive fringing sedgeland typical of the Swan Coastal Plain, and is a major breeding site, migration stop-over and semi- permanent drought refuge area for waterbirds. It usually dries out by mid- summer. The area to the north-east is suburban with houses only from the lake. Land to the west has been developed for agriculture or housing to about from the shoreline. There is a large area of natural open woodland on the eastern side. Geology and hydrology The lake lies on the eastern edge of the gently undulating Bassendean Dune System, which is formed mainly of leached grey-white siliceous sands. It is a deflation basin bordered by low sand ridges up to five metres high. On the north-eastern edge of the lake there is a rocky sandstone outcrop. The lake bed sediments are up to two metres thick and include clay, silt, peat, diatomite, marl and freshwater limestone. It also lies on the eastern margin of the Jandakot Mound, a region of elevated water table beneath the Swan Coastal Plain, where the mound intersects the Perth Groundwater Area. Water levels in the lake were much higher in the 1970s and 80s, and have been declining steadily since 1992. Groundwater levels have also decreased since records began in 1996 and are about below the levels of the 1970s and 1980s. The lake is now drying out earlier than in previous wetter years. Flora and fauna Orange wattle Acacia saligna Long-toed stint Long-necked tortoise There is often a dense mat of fennel pondweed, stoneworts, and ditch grasses in the water of the lake. Surrounding the open water is an almost continuous belt of the introduced bulrush Typha orientalis, behind which various sedges, rushes and reeds grow. Beyond these is a belt of trees, mainly paperbarks and swamp banksia backed by orange wattle and flooded gum. The higher sandy ground on the eastern side supports open woodland dominated by candlestick banksia. Some 351 vascular plants from 77 families have been recorded from the nature reserve, of which 99 are introduced weeds. Twenty six species of algae have also been recorded. More than 20,000 waterbirds have been recorded on Forrestdale Lake. It regularly supports more than 1% of the national population of five shorebirds: red-capped plover (with up to 1,300 recorded at any one time), black-winged stilt (3,840), red-necked avocet (1,113), long-toed stint (up to 80), and curlew sandpiper (2,000). In some years it supports more than 10,000 ducks, including Australian shelduck (up to 1,650 counted), Pacific black duck (5,500), grey teal (9,000), Australasian shoveler (2,000), and hardhead (1,053). The lake is one of the few sites in Western Australia where little ringed plover and little stint have been recorded more than once, and it is the only location in the state where white-rumped sandpiper has been recorded. As well as the uncommon skink Lerista lineata, Forrestdale Lake supports six frog species and at least 62 aquatic invertebrate taxa. The long-necked tortoise is present. The critically endangered Australian native bee, Neopasiphae simplicior, is thought to occur only as a single population within the bushland of the Forrestdale Lake Nature Reserve adjacent to the lake and the Armadale Golf Course. Conservation=Threats The use of pesticides to control chironomids (non-biting midges) is a potential threat to aquatic invertebrate and bird life; in 1984 about 220 shorebirds were killed at the lake as a result of such spraying. Increased groundwater abstraction may exacerbate already declining water levels. The area of bulrushes in the fringing vegetation has increased and threatens its ecological character by changing its floristics, reducing the amount of open water, and reducing the area of mudflat available to migratory shorebirds. Disturbance of waterbirds by humans and dogs may occur, especially in late summer and autumn when the lake is drying out. Increasing urbanisation of the catchment may change the water balance or increase the already high nutrient level.

Odinochnoye plavanie) and also known as The Russian Hero is a 1985 Soviet military action film, directed by Mikhail Tumanishvili. In official U.S. Navy parlance, the term \\"–æ–¥–∏–Ω–æ—á–Ω–æ–µ –ø–ª–∞–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ\\" corresponds to \\"independent steaming\\". Plot The movie is set during the Cold War. A television news journalist aboard the American aircraft carrier U.S.S. Nimitz explains the scenario of current fleet exercise of the U.S. Navy in the central Pacific Ocean. During a live broadcast from the bridge of the Nimitz, the correspondent points out a fleet of \\"Russian\\" (Soviet) warships on the horizon commanded by Vice Admiral Chernov. At the same time, a plainclothed man, later identified as a CIA operative, meets U.S. Army Major Jack Hessalt, a crazed Vietnam War veteran, who is suffering wartime flashbacks and seems ready to dispatch on his own private crusade against the Soviets. The CIA man employs Hessalt to gain control over the U.S. missile facility in the Central Pacific and launch a false flag attack on a third-party ocean liner, sink it, and make it look like the Soviets have done that. While the American and Soviet ships track each other in the Pacific, a Soviet frigate with a detachment of Soviet Naval Infantry aboard, under command of Major Shatokhin, is 1,500 miles to the south and prepares to return to their home base from a detached mission (independent steaming exercise). After arriving at the U.S. military base, Hessalt receives a secret order to launch a missile with a conventional warhead at a passenger cruise ship. A group of CIA and military officers goes golfing together with influential American military industrialists and plans this operation as a part of conspiracy to frame the Soviet Navy with the sinking of a civilian liner. The aim of the operation is to derail an upcoming Soviet-American disarmament summit in order to assure continued profitability of certain U.S. defense contractors. After Hessalt finds out that he and his men are actually expendables most likely to be assassinated immediately after the completion of their mission, he goes ballistic and takes full control of the base, arming a cruise missile with a nuclear warhead instead of conventional one, and prepares to strike the Soviet eskadra so he and his henchmen could escape from the island and disappear among the ensuing chaos. Meanwhile, an American hipster-lookalike couple, local airline pilot and his wife, spends honeymoon on the island near the missile base, Hessalt orders his men to eliminate the unnecessary witnesses. Woman has been killed, but the man managed to escape, shortly thereafter teams up with the Soviets to punish the villains. After the Soviet Chief of Naval Staff found out that Hessalt acts on his own, he orders Major Shatokhin and his detachment to procced upon a search and destroy mission, find and neutralize the missile launch site. The Soviets face the difficult task to prevent possible World War III. Significance The Detached Mission was filmed and released shortly after the second Rambo installment was released, and according to many observers was the Soviet Union's response to that film. According to the lead actor, Mikhail Nozhkin, this was the last anti-American Soviet propaganda movie filmed before the Soviet leadership ordered an end to anything that might irritate the U.S. Government. In a 2006 interview, Nozhkin said, > ...they didn't let us film, Gorbachev was already in power, which means > chaos had started. A movie on a military theme, and we couldn't get arms, > they say, \\"Here's a Makarov pistol, that's it.\\" They wouldn't give us > anything in order to avoid offending the overseas \\"friends\\": we are all for > peace and so on.

In 1940, two mobilization hospitals were constructed along Dixie Street, and were used until the current multi-storied concrete structure opened in 1957. The current hospital facility was named in honor of Major General Merritte W. Ireland, a surgeon and U.S. Army Surgeon General from October 30, 1918, to May 31, 1931.

Major services include general medical and surgical care, adult and pediatric primary care clinics, specialty clinics, clinical services, wellness and prevention services, and a VA clinic. Remote on-post clinics include the Aviation Medical Clinic, One Stop Medical, Nelson Troop Medical Clinic, Reception Medical Processing, and the RCF Clinic. The activity is the center of a larger area of responsibility which serves an isolated active duty population in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin. Off- post clinics in this six-state area include Bluegrass Army Depot, Camp Atterbury Troop Medical Clinic, Fort McCoy Troop Medical Clinic, Rock Island Health Clinic, and Selfridge Health Clinic. The hospital was slated to lose its inpatient facilities as a result of BRAC 2005, but was removed from the list when panel members raised concerns about the distance soldiers and their families would have to travel to receive inpatient medical care. It is reorganizing in 2017 without a hospital and instead become a super clinic.

Career Jupp played in several Southend bands after leaving art college in 1962 and was in the R&B; group the Orioles (1963 to late 1965), which included Mo Witham (guitar, vocals) and Bob Clouter (drums), but the band were never recorded. After a break from music, Jupp formed Legend in 1968, who were signed to Bell Records. They released an eponymous album Legend, playing a mix of pop, rockabilly and blues rock styles using no electric instruments. The original band: Nigel Dunbar (drums), Chris East (guitar, vocals and harmonica) and Steve Geere (string bass and vocals), who recorded this album with Jupp (guitar, piano and vocals), split soon afterwards, so Jupp assembled a new line-up, with Mo Witham on guitar, John Bobin on bass and Bill Fifield on drums. A recording deal with Vertigo produced a second album, in 1970, using the same line-up. Confusingly, this album was also called Legend, but is usually referred to as the \\"Red Boot\\" album, after the cover picture. Fifield left to join T.Rex (where he was renamed Bill Legend, after the band he had left, by Marc Bolan), and was replaced on drums by Bob Clouter who had played with Jupp in the Orioles. This line-up recorded the second Vertigo album Moonshine issued in 1972 (and re- released on CD in 2007), after which the band broke up. Returning to Southend, Jupp pursued a low-key existence until the pub-rock revolution (spearheaded by local bands such as Dr. Feelgood, for whom he wrote the hit single \\"Down at the Doctors\\") created a fresh interest in rock and roll. He signed to Stiff Records in 1978, and they initially released a compilation album of the first three Legend albums, which was also called Legend, giving three albums with this title. This was followed by his first solo album, Juppanese, an album in two different styles. The first half was recorded with Rockpile and produced by Nick Lowe, and is in a simple raw style, whereas the second half, produced by Gary Brooker of Procol Harum, was slicker. The album had a cover photo of Jupp sitting at a table of oriental food, pulling at the corners of his eyes. Jupp had a long-standing connection with Procol Harum; Brooker, then with R&B; group the Paramounts, was one of his early idols. When Procol's bassist David Knights went into management, Legend were his first act. He also produced their final album Moonshine. Robin Trower also produced Legend's second single \\"Georgia George Part 1\\" which was actually Jupp backed by Mo Witham and Procol's Matthew Fisher and B.J. Wilson.Liner notes to Repertoire Records Legend CD The follow-up album Long Distance Romancer was produced by Godley and Creme, and has a slick, highly produced, sound, which was generally seen as less successful. Jupp went on to release a further seven solo albums, some appearing on Swedish and German labels. His songs have been recorded by Rick Nelson, Elkie Brooks, the Judds, Chris Farlowe, Delbert McClinton, Nick Lowe, Dave Edmunds, Gary Brooker, the Hamsters, Dr. Feelgood, Roger Chapman, and the Searchers. At one time the Mickey Jupp Band had Joy Sarney as its vocalist. In February 2009 the early Legend line-up of Chris East, Mo Witham, John Bobin, Bob Clouter and Mickey Jupp self-released a new album, Never Too Old To Rock, featuring a selection of Jupp‚ÄìEast songs written over the previous twenty years. Appreciation On 6 February 2015, most of a two-hour edition of the Belgian radio show Dr Boogie on Classic 21 was dedicated to Jupp who was described (in French) as a 'hidden treasure of rock', a 'white Chuck Berry'. and a musician 'almost without ego'.

Development Arado's response to a requirement by the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM) for a light / emergency fighter aircraft, was the Ar 76 which was evaluated against the Heinkel He 74, Focke-Wulf Fw 56, the Henschel Hs 121 and Hs 125 in 1935. Although the Fw 56 was selected for the main production contract, the RLM was sufficiently impressed by the Ar 76 to order a small number of production aircraft as well. Design The Ar 76 was a parasol-wing monoplane with fixed, tailwheel undercarriage. The wings were constructed of fabric- covered wood, and the fuselage was fabric-covered steel tube.

It can be reached from Zermatt by the Gornergrat rack railway (GGB), the highest open-air railway in Europe. Between the Gornergrat railway station () and the summit is the Kulm Hotel (). In the late 1960s two astronomical observatories were installed in the two towers of the Kulmhotel Gornergrat. The project ‚ÄúStellarium Gornergrat‚Äù is hosted in the Gornergrat South Observatory. Overview It is located about three kilometers east of Zermatt in the Swiss canton of Valais. The Gornergrat is located between the Gornergletscher and Findelgletscher and offers a view of more than 20 four-thousand metre peaks, whose highest are Dufourspitze (Monte Rosa massif), Liskamm, Matterhorn, Dom and Weisshorn. This is the last stop of the Gornergrat train, opened in 1898, which climbs almost through Riffelalp and Riffelberg. At the terminus on the south-western tip of the ridge is a hotel. The station forms part of the Zermatt ski area. From 1958 to 2007Stockhorn lifts on Seilbahn Nostalgie (in German)End of Gornergrat tram service - Funimag.com there was a cable car from Gornergrat over the Hoht√§lli () to the Stockhorn () which, until the construction of the Klein Matterhorn cable car, was the highest mountain station in Zermatt.

It is currently the fourth largest car maker in India after Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai and Mahindra. On 7 June 2012, Vice Chairman of the company revealed that the company is planning to enter the healthcare sector and its first hospital would open in Karnataka in May 2013.  History  Toyota Motor Corporation entered India in 1997 in a joint venture with the Kirloskar Group. Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) holds 89% of the share and the remaining 11% is owned by Kirloskar Group.Toyota Kirloskar Motor Ltd., Toyota Kirloskar Motors, Toyota Qualis, Toyota Innova, Toyota Corolla, Toyota Camry, Toyota Plado  Manufacturing facilities  TKMPL's current plant at Bidadi, Karnataka is spread across 850 acres and has a capacity of 110,000 vehicles per annum. TKMPL's second manufacturing plant on the outskirts of Bangalore, Karnataka has a capacity of 210,000 vehicles per annum. Total production capacity is 320,000 vehicles per annum. On 16 March 2011, it announced that it was increasing production to 210,000 vehicles per annum due to increase in demand for its models especially the Etios and Fortuner. With effect from 1 June 2012, Toyota Kirloskar Motor will be increasing the prices of Etios diesel and Innova by 1 per cent and Fortuner and Etios Liva diesel by 0.5 per cent. The price hike is on account of the weakening of Rupee. Toyota announced that Etios sedan and the Liva hatchback has posted sales of over 100,000 units, hence Toyota is all set for giving its production a big boost. Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) plans to hike the production capacity of its Etios series models by 75% by early 2013. Toyota Kirloskar Motors would launch its motor racing series in 3 cities in India next year.  Industrial relations  On 16 March 2014, Toyota Kirloskar Motor temporarily suspended the production at two of its assembly plants in Bidadi, Karnataka whose production capacity was 310,000 units annually and has employee strength of 6,400. Cause for the shutdown was failure to reach an agreement with the union over the issue of wages, deliberate stoppages of the production line by certain sections of the employees and abusing & threatening of supervisors thereby disrupting the production for the past 25 days. Toyota Kirloskar Motor announced on 21 March 2014 to lift the lockout at the plants effective from 24 March 2014 with subject to an acceptance of a service condition which requires all the employees signing an undertaking on good conduct. On 22 April 2014, employees called off the strike after 36 days of standoff and resumed full operations.  Etios motor racing  Toyota India started a One make racing series in India with the Etios car called the 'Etios Motor Racing Series'. The series started in 2012, it witnessed an overwhelming response from the Indian youngsters, with 3300 applicants. They held 2 rounds of exhibition races in 2012, one at a purpose built race track in Chennai called the Sriperumbudur race track and other in the form of ROC (Race of champions) in Gurgaon. The 25 selected drivers then competed in the main championship held in the later half of 2013. The cars were prepared by Red Rooster Performance (based in Bangalore), and designed by TRD (Toyota Racing Development). With stock engines producing almost 100 bhp, the cars were a good platform for youngsters to step from karting to touring cars. Also the relatively cheaper budget of just $3216 for the entire series which includes an entire OMP racing kit makes it one of the best one-make series to compete in.

Best known to history as the Archbishop of Dublin from 1317 until his death in 1349, his career involved extensive diplomatic missions for the King and the holding of numerous civil and ecclesiastical offices in Ireland, including Lord Treasurer of Ireland (1307‚Äì1309) and Lord Chancellor of Ireland.  Early life and career  De Bicknor's date of birth is unclear. Numerous mentions of an Alexander de Bicknor can be found in Gloucestershire records in the late 13th century and in the first decade of the 14th century. Both Gallagher and Phillips consider these to be the same man as the later archbishop, surmising a birthdate in the 1260s. The earliest mention appears to be as bailiff of Gloucester in 1273,Gloucester: Bailiffs, 1200‚Äì1483, pp. 371‚Äì74 which puts this conclusion in some doubt, though there is a fairly continuous trail of records connecting this Alexander with the man who would become Archbishop of Dublin. Whether this is a case of unusual longevity for the period (he would have had to have been over 80 years old at his death) or two presumably related individuals of the same name is unclear, though there can be little doubt that de Bicknor was already a mature adult when elected archbishop in 1310. The career of this or these Alexander de Bicknors in Gloucestershire involved the wool trade at least one pointCal. Pat. Rolls 1292‚Äì1301 p. 299-300 as well as extensive activity in civil offices, including tax collection, service on commissions of oyer and terminer, and service as one of the two bailiffs of Gloucester for eight different years. De Bicknor was also among nine men of Gloucester charged with evasion of taxes on the wine trade in 1287, which would suggest a breadth of commercial interests.Medieval Gloucester, p. 22 Given their presence in Gloucester, the de Bicknor family may have derived their toponymic surname from English Bicknor in Gloucestershire (the \\"English\\" qualifier did not generally appear until later). The Catholic Encyclopedia however associates him with another town named Bicknor in Kent, but in one instance in 1297 he is explicitly called \\"Alexander de Bykenore of Gloucester.\\"Cal. Pat. Rolls 1292‚Äì1301 p. 300 Confusing the issue, there were indeed contemporary persons surnamed de Bicknor who were clearly associated with Kent (such as the knight and chief falconer of Edward I, John de BicknorPrestwich, p. 115), so the issue remains in some doubt. According to the Patent Rolls,Cal. Pat. Rolls 1307‚Äì13, p. 355A a licence to crenellate a structure in Ruardean, around four miles from English Bicknor, Glos., was granted to Alexander de Bicknor (almost certainly the archbishop in this case) by the King in 1311, which corroborates the identification with the de Bicknors of Gloucestershire and also indicates that he must have possessed a fairly substantial dwelling there. Fragments of this structure, now often referred to as \\"Ruardean Castle\\"Ruardean Castle, United Kingdom can still be seen today.Parker, p. 344; Davis  Election to the Archbishopric  De Bicknor was originally elected to the archbishopric in 1310 by the unanimous chapters of St. Patrick's Cathedral and Christ Church,Phillips, p. 664 at which time he was Treasurer of Ireland and Prebendary of Maynooth, one of several prebendaries he held during his life. For reasons which are unclear, this election was set aside (secondary sources differ as to whether this was on the Pope's or the King's initiative) in favour of the chapter of Dunkeld's election of John de Leche, who thus served a brief but active term as archbishop of Dublin from 1311 to his death in 1313. After Leche's death, the succession was contended between de Bicknor and then-Lord Chancellor of Ireland Walter de Thornbury, but after Thornbury died in a shipwreck en route to France, the choice fell clearly on de Bicknor. Sources differ on whether he was consecrated at AvignonWalsh, p. 117, who says that Nicholas de Prato, Cardinal of Ostia performed the consecration on 22 July 1317; Phillips agrees that the site was Avignon, but gives instead a date of 20 August 1317 or Rome,Catholic Encyclopedia, which agrees on the date of 22 July 1317 but after close to seven years, he was consecrated archbishop of Dublin.  St. Patrick's University project  One of the more positive achievements of de Bicknor's tenure was the founding the first new colonial (there were many others in Ireland earlier) Irish University at St. Patrick's Cathedral in 1320, based on a charter obtained by his predecessor, Archbishop Leche. While it had some limited early success, the institution did not survive into modern times, but scattered historical references show that it persisted in some form up until the time of the Reformation.  Tallaght Castle  de Bicknor founded Tallaght Castle as a means of protection of Tallaght in 1324.  Early tenure: the rebellion of Isabella and Mortimer and the accounting scandal  De Bicknor came to the Dublin see during a time of considerable domestic and foreign troubles, including the continuous chafing of the Gaelic Irish against English rule (of which Bicknor was a chief representative) and the struggles between the Scots under Robert Bruce and the English crown, which frequently spilled over into Ireland. De Bicknor was one of the archbishops who promulgated the excommunication of Bruce in 1318. Among the most notable domestic disturbances was the rebellion of Edward II's queen, Isabella of France, against the King and his favourites, the Despensers in 1324. During the early 1320s, de Bicknor was actively engaged in diplomacy on several missions to France. During one of these, facing a French siege and general military and diplomatic debacle, he advised the Earl of Kent to surrender the fortress of La R√©oleThe Catholic Encyclopedia, contrary to most other sources names it as La Rozelle to the French, in effect recognising the defeat of the English attempting to defend the Duchy of Aquitaine. Shortly thereafter de Bicknor went over to side of the Queen, who had openly taken the powerful and ambitious English noble Roger Mortimer as a lover while in France. The archbishop at one point even declared that he would have challenged Hugh Despenser the Younger to a duel, if it had not been contrary to his ecclesiastic position.Sumption, p. 96 Edward responded with an extensive list of most likely legitimate accusations to the Pope of various sorts of malfeasance in office, including his attacks on the Despensers.Catholic Encyclopedia These opened the door to the discovery of extensive problems in de Bicknor's accounts, and in particular substantial arrears to the Church itself, non-payment of which in part led to de Bicknor's excommunication.Gallagher But in the end, de Bicknor had chosen the winning side, and Edward was forced to abdicate in 1327 in favour of his son Edward III, at the time still controlled by Isabella and Mortimer. The former king is thought to have been executed under uncertain circumstances later in the same year. In the late 1320s, the darkest period of de Bicknor's career began to unfold, when further accounting fraud during his administration was uncovered, or at least ceased to be tolerated. If de Bicknor had expected his support for the new regime to excuse him, he was disappointed, as his assets and holdings were seized by the crown. After this point, de Bicknor's role in national politics diminished substantially. His difficulties became only deeper when he apparently attempted to falsify a royal pardon (ironically, for the crime of fraud). When Edward III came of age in 1330, he had Mortimer brutally executed and Isabella was forced to live out the rest of her life under what was, in essence, house arrest, so de Bicknor's fate was relatively mild compared to that of his erstwhile patrons and allies. More remarkably, he eventually obtained an authentic pardon from Edward III.  Later ecclesiastical disputes  De Bicknor's later tenure as Archbishop after the accession of Edward III was also plagued by disputes, though of a less mortal nature. In particular de Bicknor conducted a protracted feud with the Bishop of Ossory, Richard de Ledrede, best remembered for his role in the Kilkenny Witch Trials. The long- standing dispute over the Primacy of All Ireland between the Archbishop of Dublin and the Archbishop of Armagh also flared up periodically, and in 1349 Archbishop Richard FitzRalph of Armagh entered Dublin to assert his primacy, causing a considerable stir.  De Bicknor genealogy  The genealogist Gustav Anjou claimed, based on uncertain sources,Gustav Anjou, \\"Buckner Family,\\" The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Family History Library Microfilm FHL US/CAN Film 908083 Item 10 that the de Bicknor surname eventually evolved into the modern English surname Buckner, but this claim is doubtful and Anjou's reputation for flattering patrons with dubious claims of distinguished medieval ancestry casts further doubt upon it. There is also a reference to a niece of Alexander de Bicknor named Margery on whom he settled the manor of Ruardean in 1311 at her marriage to Geoffrey of Langley.History of the County of Gloucester: Volume 5, pp. 231‚Äì247 Notes and referencesBibliography     * * External links * Catholic Encyclopedia Article * Article on the Occasional University at Dublin Founded by de Bicknor Category:13th-century births Category:1349 deaths Category:Archbishops of Dublin Category:14th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Lord Chancellors of Ireland Category:Pre-Reformation bishops in Ireland Category:Lords Lieutenant of Ireland ","title":"Alexander de Bicknor"},{"id":"10906433","text":"Arflex is an Italian company that makes and sells contemporary furniture. History Foam rubber Arflex. By Paolo Monti photographer, 1975. Armchair by Arflex. By Paolo Monti photographer, 1975. In 1947 after the war, a group of researchers and entrepreneurs that began to work on two new upholstering materials ‚Äì foam rubber and elastic tape made by Pirelli ‚Äì presented the technical specifications of the new products to Marco Zanuso, who saw the huge potential of the new materials in interior furnishings. Zanuso initiated an experimental programme of operations that went on until 1950. Between 1951 and 1954, Arflex produced various models of car seat designed by Carlo Barassi. These could be fitted into the vehicle instead of standard production seats and offered outstanding comfort, thanks to the use of foam rubber and elastic tape. The covers could be removed and the seatbacks were adjustable. Arflex strove to make its contribution to the comfort of those Italians who were beginning to travel just after the war. The most successful of those car seats were the \\"MilleMiglia\\" and the \\"Sedile Lettino\\", a seat that could be turned into a makeshift bed. Both were designed for the Fiat Topolino.  Designers  Marco Zanuso became a symbol of the developing design culture in post-war Italy, a generation of designers whose social commitment was coloured by the ideological heritage of the Modern Movement. And so the collection of Arflex products is first and foremost an overview of the fruitful collaboration of manufacturer and designer. Marco Zanuso (as a designer) and Arflex (as a manufacturer) started out together, the only such case in the history of furnishings in Italy. The number of designers who contributed to the Arflex range increased steadily: Franco Albini, De Carlo, , Peressutti, Roger, Carboni, Pulitzer, Menghi, Joe Colombo, Casati, , Tito Agnoli, Marenco, Cini Boeri, Carlo Colombo, Cristof Pilelt, Vincent Van Duysen, Michele De Lucchi, Ettore Sottsass, Marco Piva, Paola Vella, Pieter De Bruyne and many others.

Originally broadcast on Channel Four in 1984, the single series was spread over six half-hour episodes plus a one-hour final episode. It was written by playwright Alan Bleasdale. The drama is notable for featuring many of the Liverpool football club first-team squad of that era. The estate parts were filmed in Longsight, Manchester, on the 'Anson Road' Estate. Also some scenes were filmed in Wythenshawe m22 Manchester. Scully's house is situated on Bluebell Lane in Huyton, Knowsley, Several parts were also filmed on roads off Princess Drive, Dovecot. The school building featured is the 'Central High School for Boys' (demolished) on Pink Bank Lane, which is off Kirkmanshulme Lane in the Belle Vue/Gorton area of Manchester. The extras used in the school/classroom scenes were pupils of the school. Francis Scully (played by Andrew Schofield) is a teenage boy who has his heart set on gaining a trial match for Liverpool to hopefully fulfil his ambition of playing for the club. Francis, in everyday situations during his waking hours, occasionally \\"sees\\" famous Liverpool players such as Kenny Dalglish when they are not really there. These dream-like sequences recur throughout the episodes. The main plotline concerns the efforts of Scully's school teachers to persuade Scully to appear in the school pantomime which they attempt by promising him a trial with his beloved Liverpool if he will cooperate. When Scully and his friends are not in school making trouble for the teachers and the school caretaker, they are seen roaming the local streets upsetting the neighbours and getting into trouble with the police. Scully sometimes has visions of the school caretaker appearing as a vampire due to the caretaker's nickname being Dracula. These frequent waking dream sequences give the show a somewhat surreal atmosphere. English musician and songwriter Elvis Costello played Scully's brother. Costello also wrote and performed the show's theme song \\"Turning The Town Red\\". The complete series was released on DVD in 2006 as a two-disc set from Network DVD.

A memorial ceremony is held by the Turkish army annually on 23 December at the Martyr Kubilay Memorial () located on a hill over-looking Menemen; in remembrance of Lieutenant Mustafa Fehmi Kubilay and the two municipal watchmen Bek√ßi Hasan and Bek√ßi ≈ûevki who were killed in the incident. The monument features a tall sculpture by Ratip A≈üir Acudoƒüu which was erected in 1932. The Kubilay Memorial is a part of Kubilay Barracks, but open to the public. The area is landscaped and illuminated at night. A military honor guard stands continuous watch at the memorial site, which contains the graves of several Turkish soldiers who were killed in the line of duty. In the aftermath 28 people were hanged by the neck. Rebellion Following the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, the Republican People's Party of Turkey pursued a somewhat liberal policy towards Islam, promoting secularism while not taking a hard line against Islamic institutions and practices, believing that the secularism of their ideology was already taking root. This confidence was shaken on 23 December 1930, when Dervish Mehmet Efendi, a member of the Naqshbandi (Turkish: Nak≈üibendi) order, created a protest by rallying an armed crowd against the policies of the secular government and calling for the restoration of Sharia and the Caliphate. A squad of soldiers from the local garrison was sent to quell the demonstration. One of the soldiers fired (using wooden bullets) upon the demonstrators and a riot ensued. The crowd then killed and beheaded the commanding officer of the squad, Lieutenant Mustafa Fehmi Kubilay, and placed his severed head on a pole with a green flag before parading through town with it. Two municipal watchmen; Bek√ßi Hasan and Bek√ßi ≈ûevki were also killed by the demonstrators. Several rioters were also killed. Government reaction The new republican government of Turkey was shocked by the demonstration of religious fervor and by how readily it was embraced by some Turks, as it was completely antithetical to secularism. A state of emergency was declared and courts- martial were established which meted out sentences ranging from death at the gallows or life imprisonment to one years confinement. There were also several acquittals. Sufi members were arrested around the country. Furthermore, it demonstrated that secularism was taking hold neither as quickly nor as deeply as the government would have liked. This spurred the government to action, and they began a more aggressive secularization reforms in response to the Menemen incident. The government carried out this policy by attempting to nationalise Islam through performing the Adhan (Turkish: Ezan) or call to prayer, in Turkish rather than Arabic. The government furthered secularization in schools by having the Quran translated from Arabic into Turkish and read to the people on the radio and in the mosques in Turkish. These attempts reflected a comprehensive effort by the government to remove Islamic influences and entrench nationalism more deeply in Turkish culture. These efforts also reflected a larger attempt on the part of the government to consolidate Turkish traditions and promote aggressively Turkish nationalism to replace the last vestiges of nostalgia for the abolished Caliphate and the broken-up Ottoman Empire in the aftermath of World War I.

Early life Sewing machine mod. 1102 (Fratelli Borletti). Compasso d'oro Award. Photo by Paolo Monti, 1956 Armchair Martingala (Arflex). Photo by Paolo Monti, 1975. Marco Zanuso was born in Milano (Italy) 14 May 1916. He was one of a group of Italian designers from Milan shaping the international idea of \\"good design\\" in the postwar years. Trained in architecture at the Politecnico di Milano university, he opened his own design office in 1945. From the beginning of his career, at Domus where he served as the editor from 1947‚Äì49 and at Casabella where he was editor from 1952‚Äì56, he helped to establish the theories and ideals of the energetic Modern Design movement. As a professor of architecture, design and town planning at the Politecnico from the late 1940s until the 1980s, and as one of the founding members of the ADI in the 1950s, he also had a distinct influence over the next design generation coming out of Italy. Career In 1957 Zanuso partnered with German designer Richard Sapper. One of their first projects was a small, stackable child's chair (1961) in non-reinforced plastic. This piece was light, functional and playful, manufactured in several bright colors and it was among the furniture designs responsible for convincing people that plastic was a viable and appropriate material for the modern home. Zanuso and Sapper were hired in 1959 as consultants to Brionvega, an Italian company trying to produce stylish electronics that would, at least outwardly, best those being made in Japan and Germany. They designed a series of radios and televisions that became enduring icons of an aesthetic known as \\"techno- functionalism\\". Their rounded, compact and portable \\"Doney 14\\" (1962) was the first completely transistor television. Working with the language of sculptural minimalism they designed the successful folding \\"Grillo\\" telephone for Siemens (1966). This was one of the first phones to put the dial and the earpiece on the same unit. In a 1972 they designed a series of dwellings for the \\"New Domestic Landscape\\" show at the MoMA. Each stacking unit, like ultramodern teepees, unfolded to a living area complete with all the facilities and many of the accessories of a small apartment. Zanuso wrote that they were \\"designed for all situations that require immediately available, easily transportable living quarters.\\" As with the rest of their work, the hallmarks of these designs were elegance and imagination. Works The major pieces of his career run a broad spectrum from early experiments in bent metal to luxurious, plush furniture to sleek industrial designs in plastic. The underlying motif throughout each phase of his work is that he was pioneering the use and market accessibility of every different material he worked with. Some of his first work to be shown at all, and certainly to be shown outside of Italy, was at the Low-Cost Furniture competition sponsored by the MoMA in 1948. His design featured a metal frame chair that used a breakthrough method to join the fabric seat to the frame. In 1948 Pirelli opened a new division, Arflex, to design seating with foam rubber upholstery. They commissioned Zanuso to produce their first models. His \\"Antropus\\" chair came out in 1949, followed by the \\"Lady\\" chair, which won first prize at the 1951 Milan Triennale. Zanuso lauded the new material, \\"One could revolutionize not only the system of upholstery but also the structural manufacturing and formal potential...our prototypes acquired visually exciting and new contours...with industrial standards that were previously unimaginable.\\" Different items of his work in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, Triennale Milano, Triennale Tokyo, Vitra Museum, Arflex Museum and Kartell Museum.

Standard economic theory assumes that preferences are transitive. However, many people have argued that intransitive preferences are quite common, and often observed in real world settings. A cognitive bias is called the focusing effect: people focus on one characteristic which stands out in order to make decisions In choosing potential mates, candidate A is more beautiful/handsome than candidate B. B is wealthier then C. C is far better attuned on a personal level than A ‚Äì the hearts meet. Then choices could be intransitive because instead of evaluating the whole package, people focus on one characteristic which distinguishes between two candidates to make decisions. Example The original example of the Money Pump was published by Davidson, McKinsey and Suppes in 1955. It was based on gambling games. In their example, there are two \\"tickets\\", each of which entitles the bearer to play a gambling game once. Any money paid to obtain the ticket does not count towards the stake for the game. An example of the type of tickets available are: * Ticket A gives a chance to play a game where you stake $1 for a 50:50 chance of winning $5. * Ticket B gives a chance to play a game where you stake $1 for a 1:20 chance of winning $100. McKinsey and Suppes found that most players would rate the ticket with the higher chance of winning (A) as more desirable, but the ticket with the higher prize (B) as more valuable, thus representing intransitive preferences. This would theoretically allow a \\"money pump\\" to operate as follows: * The operator offers the customer a chance to buy ticket B at a fairly negotiated price, P. * The operator then offers the customer ticket A in exchange for ticket B, on the grounds that they desire it more. * The operator then offers to buy ticket A back for a fairly negotiated price, P'. Since A is considered less valuable than B, P' should be less than P. But after all these transactions, all that has happened is that (P-P') dollars have been transferred from the customer to the operator in exchange for ultimately nothing.  Reactions  There are many counter-arguments which can be made to this. One of the simplest was made by Cubitt. His paper shows that the argument rests on some very strong assumptions and is tautological: to say that X acts as a money pump is no different from saying that X has intransitive preferences, and does not add anything to evidence for or against the existence of intransitive preferences. A second argument is more fundamental, and this rests on the possibility of incomparability. This differentiates between choice and preference. Forced to choose between A and B, I may choose A, yet the two may really not be comparable choices, thus we cannot conclude that I must have preferred A to B. See section on incommensurability in article on \\"Dynamic Choices\\" in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy for a more detailed discussion. If choices are not comparable, then again the money pump argument fails. A more complex and sophisticated version of this argument occurs in the context of subjective probability, where it is known as the Dutch book argument. There it is shown that rational behavior involves making choices over bets in such a way that they correspond to subjective probabilities. If someone fails to satisfy this condition (that is, fails to have subjective probabilities), then his preferences over lotteries will be intransitive and he can be made to act as a money pump. Thus the argument is used to justify the existence of subjective probabilities as a requirement for rational behavior. Again there are many possible counter-arguments.

Career  At the Palazzo dei Diamanti, Ferrara. A design created by Cini Boeri in collaboration with Marco Zanuso Boeri earned her degree at the Politecnico di Milano university in 1951. At that time, there were more female interior designers than architects because it was thought that women were too fragile to work outside. After collaborating with Marco Zanuso from 1951 through 1963, she started an independent architectural practice. Her main focuses in architecture were civil and interior architecture, as well as industrial design. In the 1970s, Boeri began designing showrooms for Knoll in Europe and America. She also designed a variety of sofas and chairs for the company, some of which are still in production today. In addition, she worked for a variety of other design companies, including lighting company Artemide, furniture company Arflex, and the housewares company Rosenthal. Some do not know that Boeri was a trained architect because of her work for Knoll and Arflex. Different examples of her work can be found in museums and international exhibitions.  Prizes and awards  Boeri was awarded many prizes; among those, in 1979 a Compasso D'Oro (strips product design for arflex) and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Italian Cultural Institute of Los Angeles in 2008.

It lies on that city's Royal Route and links Nowy ≈öwiat (New World) Street, to the north, with Ujazd√≥w Avenue to the south. Much of the square's area is devoted to a major thoroughfare. History Until the 18th century, the area now occupied by the square was little more than sparsely-populated open terrain south of the then-city limits of Warsaw. During the reign of King Augustus II the Strong, between 1724 and 1731, a \\"road to Calvary\\" (Stations of the Cross) was created, with the first station being located near the present square, and the last station next to Ujazd√≥w Castle to the south. The first station featured two golden crosses. In 1752 Grand Marshal of the Crown Franciszek Bieli≈Ñski erected a statue nearby of St. John of Nepomuk, also holding a cross. On account of the three crosses, the populace took to calling the area \\"Rozdro≈ºe z≈Çotych krzy≈ºy\\"‚Äî\\"the Crossroads of the Golden Crosses\\". In the Square stands the neoclassist St. Alexander's Church, designed 1818‚Äì25 by the Polish architect Chrystian Piotr Aigner.\\"Aigner, Chrystian Piotr,\\" Encyklopedia Polski, p. 12.\\"Aigner, Chrystian Piotr,\\" Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN (PWN Universal Encyclopedia), volume 1, p. 32. Originally the square itself also bore the name of Saint Alexander. The square takes its present name from three crosses: one atop St. Alexander's Church, and two atop columns several dozen meters away, facing the church's entrance. Contrary to common belief, there are more than three crosses in the square. Apart from the three mentioned above, there are two atop the northern and southern fa√ßades of the church, as well as one in front of the Institute for the Deaf (which was erected in 1827 and initially run by the Catholic Church). During the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, the square and most of the surrounding buildings were destroyed or deliberately demolished by the Germans. After 1945 the Institute for the Deaf was rebuilt, and the church was rebuilt to its pre-19th-century appearance. The square now hosts exclusive retail stores ‚Äî Hugo Boss, Burberry, Church's, Ermenegildo Zegna, Max Mara, Coccinelle, W. Kruk, JM Weston, Franscesco Biasa, Escada, MAX & Co., Lacoste, Emporio Armani and Kenzo. Adjacent to the square is the Warsaw Stock Exchange, an HSBC Premiere office, and a Sheraton Hotel.

History  Initially the building, which was built during the late Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644), was home to a rich salt merchant, but it was turned into theatre in the last years of the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (1711‚Äì1799) in the Qing dynasty and showed Beijing opera performances as late as the 1970s. After that, audiences dwindled despite attempts to regain visitors by organizing dances and film screenings in the 1980s and the theatre fell into disuse; Since the reform and opening up, many old theaters have been turned into ashes in the bulldozers of urban construction, but Guanghe Building has been spared from disaster.

It also offers preparatory courses for GCE 'O' level and 'A' level examinations via its subsidiary MDIS College, which is registered under the Committee for Private Education Singapore (CPE). History= Before 1995  1955: A group of personnel managers got together to discuss industrial relations problems. The coming-together sparked off the formation of the Supervisory and Management Training Association of Singapore (SAMTAS). Understanding that supervisors were probably the best people to identify and solve any labour problems, training was catered primarily to these supervisors on aspects from job relations to industrial safety. Certified courses, seminars, lectures, film shows and excursions were organised. The inaugural meeting was held on 29 November 1955 where Mr Loke Wan Tho was named its first President. In April 1956, SAMTAS was formalised.http://www.mdis.edu.sg/mdis-heritage '- MDIS Heritage: 1956 SAMTAS Formed 1963: SAMTAS pioneered the Training-Within-Industries (TWI) courses in Singapore. In line with the Singapore government's plans to promote industrialisation in the country, these were courses on supervisory skills initiated by the then Ministry of Labour. 1984: The plan to upgrade SAMTAS' status to that of a professional institute was initiated in 1982. The change of name from SAMTAS to MDIS, or the Management Development Institute of Singapore, was made official on 8 February 1984. The purpose of this move was to give a more professional image and to upgrade the individual membership by allowing the use of designatory letters. SAMTAS, and then MDIS, is the oldest professional institute in Singapore today. MDIS has collaborated with universities in the UK, the USA and Australia to offer certified courses. Besides its certified courses from Certificate to Master's level, MDIS conducts seminars, in-house training and consultancy services and offers membership services and privileges.  1995 to 2007  An International Affairs Department was set up in 1998 to handle the affairs of foreign students studying with MDIS. In March 2001, the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Singapore announced that MDIS is a recognised educational institute in China. To date, MDIS has helped almost 3,000 foreign students attain academic qualifications through its courses. MDIS was accorded charity status on 23 August 1996 under the Charities Registration Act, 1994. On 19 November 1997, MDIS was awarded the ISO 9001 certification. On 7 November 2000, MDIS received the People Developer Standard certification. The MDIS Education Trust Fund received its Institution of a Public Character and Charity status in 2002.

She was a close companion of the writer Samuel Johnson, who stated that he was \\"very desolate\\" when she died. Life Charterhouse Hospital, engraved by Toms, c.1770.. Early life She was born at Rosemarket, Pembrokeshire to Zachariah Williams (1668/73‚Äì1755), a scientist and physician, and his wife, Martha. Her father provided her with a wide artistic and scientific education, Italian and French. In 1726‚Äì27, the family moved to London, staying at the Charterhouse, where Anna helped her father while he experimented with magnetism in pursuit of the longitude prize and became his home-help, when he became bedridden and hospitalised in 1745. Despite failing sight in the 1740s, she was able to sew, and in 1746 published a translation of a French life of the emperor Julian. Life with Johnson In 1748 her father was ejected from hospital and they appealed to Dr Johnson, who had taken an interest in Williams's experiments and assisted him in publishing his theory of longitude. Later, Johnson also arranged for Samuel Sharp to operate on Anna's cataracts. After this failed, she became a member of his household, until just before her death, living with Johnson in all his various residences. The only exception is the period from 1759‚Äì65, when he moved from Gough Street into the Inner Temple, during which time she lodged in Bolt Court, Fleet Street ‚Äì there Johnson drank tea with her \\"every night... before he went home, however late it might be, and she always sat up for him.\\"Boswell, Life, 1.421 In August 1763, Boswell proudly made good his \\"title to be a privileged man\\" by being \\"carried by [Johnson] in the evening to drink tea with Miss Williams\\". In 1765 Williams moved back into Johnson's household in 7 Johnson's Court, Fleet Street, and then from March 1776 until her death in 8 Bolt Court, supervising his household management and expenses from a ground-floor apartment in both houses. Regularly helping Johnson when he entertained at home, she also accompanied him on visits, or if not, had a dish sent home to her by him. Knowing a variety of literary works, she could express herself well, and having lived long with Johnson, knew his habits and how to draw him out into conversation,Boswell, Life, 1.463 whilst Johnson was not above playfulness towards her: Frances Reynolds records that he would \\"whirl her about on the steps\\" when visiting.Johnsonian Miscellanies, 2.273 Anna had annual gifts of money from acquaintances, including Lady Philipps of Picton Castle, an old family friend, but had this income was supplemented by Johnson.

Last days and death As Williams grew old and frail she became more and more intolerant towards other members of the household, although this did not affect Johnson's care for her. He wrote a prayer for her in her last illness, and after her death wrote, \\"Her curiosity was universal, her knowledge was very extensive, and she sustained forty years of misery with steady fortitude. Thirty years and more she has been my companion, and her death has left me very desolate.\\"Letters of Samuel Johnson, 3.74 His circle, while noting her peevishness, also acknowledged her learning and intelligence.

It is on the northern bank of the River Nene, at the junction of the A141 with the A47. The population is included in the civil parish of Wisbech St Mary. History According to A Dictionary of British Place Names, Guyhirn, which was 'La Gyerne' in 1275, derives from the Old French 'guie', which means \\"a guide\\" (referencing the control of tidal flow or a \\"salt-water ditch\\"), with the Old English 'hyrne', which means an \\"angle or corner of land\\".Mills, Anthony David (2003); A Dictionary of British Place Names, Oxford University Press, revised edition (2011), p.217. According to folklore, recorded in the early nineteenth century, Guyhirn was the site of \\"a severe engagement between a Saxon King and the abbot of Ely... the legend informs us that 5000 men were brought into the field... it arose from disputes respecting the boundaries of property.\\" The village is on the opposite bank of the River Nene to Ring's End where John Morton, Bishop of Ely, erected a tower house to oversee his new drain, Morton's Leam, one of the oldest fenland drains, in the late fifteenth century. Guyhirne railway station on the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway was opened in 1867. The railway required the building of the first bridge across Morton's Leam and the River Nene at Guyhirn. The railway bridge incorporated a foot bridge, which allowed free passage between Guyhirn and Ring's End. The first road bridge across the River Nene at Guyhirn was opened in 1926. Religion Chapel of Ease, Guyhirn The first chapel in Guyhirn originated in a chantry founded in 1337 by John de Reddik. Between the seventeenth and early nineteenth centuries, Guyhirn was home to a sect of religious dissenters known as the Culymites. They were named after their founder, David Culy, the son of a Huguenot family who had moved to Guyhirn, and who became known as the 'Bishop of Guyhirn'. Their beliefs were said to differ little from those of Anabaptists. It was recorded that \\"most of the inhabitants of [Guyhirn] became his followers, and many also from Whittlesea, Wisbech St. Mary's, Outwell and Upwell\\" has been estimated that his followers came to number more than 700. A Methodist Chapel was built in 1849 and rebuilt in 1868 by the Primitive Methodists with pews for 147 worshipers. This building has been demolished. The parish church of St Mary Magdalene was built in 1878, by architect George Gilbert Scott. Since 31 October 1983 it has been designated a Grade II listed building. Now a redundant church, it was put for sale in 2018 for ¬£75,000. Guyhirn Puritan Chapel, also known as Guyhirn Old Church, or the Chapel of Ease, is a small rectangular building constructed of brick and Barnack stone, with five windows of clear leaded glass set in stone mullions. Designed at the end of the Cromwellian Commonwealth, it was not completed until 1660 when the Restoration had returned Anglicanism as the official religious observance and because of this the Chapel was probably never consecrated. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust, and the 'Friends of the Guyhirn Chapel of Ease' formed in 1973 under the presidency of Sir John Betjeman, and later, Edward Storey.

New Zealand He was appointed by the Colonial Office on the advice of Justice Lord Coleridge on 2 September 1857, and arrived in Auckland, New Zealand, on the brig Gertrude on 19 February 1858. He was Chief Justice from 1858 to 1875. He was appointed Administrator of the Government under Governor Sir George Bowen on 1 October 1869 and assumed office on 21 March 1873. Arney administered the country for three months between the departure of Sir George Bowen and the arrival of Sir James Fergusson. Arney retired from that role on 14 June 1873 with the arrival of Fergusson. He was appointed to the Legislative Council on 20 February 1858 (the day after his arrival in the country) and remained a legislative councillor until his resignation on 13 June 1866. Arney was knighted in 1862 while Chief Justice. Governor George Grey resigned Arney's judgeship in 1875. Arney retired to Torquay. His brother, Colonel Arney, who had previously served with the 58th Regiment in New Zealand, died on 6 April 1879 in Cheltenham. Arney received a significant inheritance from his brother. Death and commemoration The tomb of Sir George Arney in Salisbury cathedral He died in Torquay on 7 April 1883. Arney Street in Paeroa, which is part of State Highway 26, is named for him.

William Marshall (fl. 1617‚Äì1649) was a seventeenth-century British engraver and illustrator, best known for his print depicting \\"Charles the Martyr\\", a symbolic portrayal of King Charles I of England as a Christian martyr. Early career Nothing is known of Marshall's life beyond references to his career as an engraver. Marshall's earliest known work is the frontispiece to the book A Solemne Joviall Disposition Briefly Shadowing the Law of Drinking, which was published in 1617. In the 1630s he produced a number of portrait engravings and book frontispieces, depicting Puritan divines, poets, and figures associated with the High Church establishment of the day, such as William Laud.National Portrait Gallery, William Marshall prints His most ambitious work was the highly elaborate frontispiece to George Wither's 1635 Collection of Emblemes, Ancient and Moderne, an unusually complex example of the Emblem book. Wither left the design to Marshall, having given general instructions, but expressed himself exasperated with the result, on the grounds that its symbolism was thoroughly incoherent.Wither, George, A Collection of Emblemes, Introduction by Rosemary Freeman; Bibliographical notes by Charles S. Hensley, Columbia: published for the Newberry Library by the University of South Carolina Press, 1975. As he wrote, Wither's lengthy poem on the engraving claims that its apparently inconsistent symbolism revealed, unintentionally, a deeper truth. The lower part of the frontispiece depicts people wandering in confusion in a cave, apparently having emerged from a womb-like pool in which babies are shown swimming. They exit the cave to draw lots given to them by the goddess of Fortune, symbolic of their allotted place in life. They then climb up a mountain, which divides into two peaks, symbolic of the right and the wrong paths in life. The path to the peak on the right appears more attractive at first, but then becomes rocky and finally leads only to death; the path on the left is at first harder, but eventually becomes pleasant and leads to paradise. A Christian church is depicted on the left and a Pagan temple on the right. Marshall also created forty-one of the seventy-nine plates in Francis Quarles's Emblems of the life of man. Marshall's image of Shakespeare for Benson's 1640 edition of his poems In 1640 he created the image of William Shakespeare for John Benson's (notoriously inaccurate) edition of the poet's sonnets. This was an adapted and reversed version of the original Martin Droeshout print. Five years later, he created the image of John Milton surrounded by four muses for Milton's 1645 Poems. The muses are Melpomene (tragedy), Erato, (lyric poetry), Urania, (astronomy), and Clio (history). Like Wither, Milton was unimpressed by Marshall's work, considering the portrait to be deeply unflattering. He had Marshall engrave satirical verses written in Greek underneath the image. It is assumed that this was a practical joke on Marshall, who is unlikely to have known that he was engraving insults directed at himself.Skerpan, Elizabeth Penley, Authorship and Authority: John Milton, William Marshall, and the Two Frontispieces of Poems 1645, Milton Quarterly - Volume 33, Number 4, December 1999, pp. 105-114 The verses read in translation, > Looking at the form of the original, you could say, perhaps, that this > likeness had been drawn by a rank beginner; but, my friends, since you do > not recognize what is pictured here, have a chuckle at a caricature by a > useless artist.Milton, In Effigiei Ejus Sculptorem Eikon Basilike William Marshall's Eikon Basilike print After the end of the English Civil War, when King Charles was put on trial and condemned to be executed, a book was published entitled Eikon Basilike (, the \\"Royal Portrait\\"), The Pourtrature of His Sacred Majestie in His Solitudes and Sufferings. It purported to be a spiritual autobiography written by the King. It was published on February 9, 1649, ten days after the King was beheaded by order of Parliament. Marshall created the image on the frontispiece, which employs symbolism derived from the Emblem Book tradition. This depicts the King as a Christian martyr. So popular was the book and the image that Marshall had to re-engrave the plate seven times.Society of Charles the Martyr The Latin texts read: * IMMOTA, TRIVMPHANS -- \\"Unmoved, Triumphant\\" (scroll around the rock); * Clarior √© tenebris -- \\"Brighter through the darkness\\" (beam from the clouds); * CRESCIT SUB PONDERE VIRTVS -- \\"Virtue grows beneath weights\\" (scroll around the tree); * Beatam & √Üternam -- \\"Blessed and Eternal\\" (around the heavenly crown marked GLORIA (\\"Glory\\")); meant to be contrasted with: ** Splendidam & Gravem -- \\"Splendid and Heavy\\" (around the Crown of England, removed from the King's head and lying on the ground), with the motto Vanitas (\\"vanity\\"); and ** Asperam & Levem -- \\"Bitter and Light\\", the martyr's crown of thorns held by Charles; contains the motto Gratia (\\"grace\\"); * Coeli Specto -- \\"I look to Heaven\\"; * IN VERBO TVO SPES MEA -- \\"In Thy Word is My Hope\\"; * Christi Tracto -- \\"I entreat Christ\\" or \\"By the word of Christ\\"; * Mundi Calco -- \\"I tread on the world\\". In the first edition, the frontispiece was accompanied by Latin and English verses that explain it. The English verses go: The landscape at the left contains the weighted palm tree and the rock buffeted by winds and waves, emblematic of the king's steadfastness. The beam of light from heaven passing through the king's eye illustrates his vision of his heavenly crown of martyrdom, while he picks up the crown of thorns and discards the earthly crown and worldly power (represented by the chart of the world on which he treads). The Eikon Basilike and its portrait of Charles's execution as a martyrdom were so successful that, at the Restoration, a special commemoration of the King on 30 January was added to the Book of Common Prayer, directing that the day be observed as an occasion for fasting and repentance. It is assumed that Marshall died in 1649, since there are no more references to him and the Eikon Basilke plate was reengraved for the eighth time that year by another engraver, Robert Vaughan.Dictionary of National Biography, William Marshall.

At the 2006 census, Lipson had a population of 209. Today, Lipson is little more than a historic tourist attraction, with very few permanent residents. History The township was named after Thomas Lipson, a naval officer born in 1783, who came to South Australia in 1836 and was appointed collector of customs and harbour master at Port Adelaide. Lipson was once a well established town, having a number of facilities including a post office, church, shop and a school. The school opened in 1881 as Yaranyacka school and closed in 1950. Nearby mines produced some of the finest talc in the world, but with the closing of the mines, the town gradually died. The district surrounding Lipson is agricultural, with sheep and cereal crops prevalent. The Ungarra, Butler and Lipson Football clubs merged in 1963 to form the Eyre united Football Club, with the oval now located at Ungarra. Despite the waning of the town, the annual Lipson show has continued, with Tumby Bay residents and tourists flocking to the show each year. In 2004, the show celebrated its 100th year in operation. Lipson Cove Only a few kilometres toward the coast from the town, Lipson Cove is a bay with camping facilities. The cove is renowned for its fishing and the old talc mine is located nearby. This area has exposed granite coastal hills and cliffs that extend from Lipson Cove to Port Neill. Lipson Island can be accessed when the tide is low, but care must be taken not to get stranded. The island and surrounding intertidal zone constitutes the Lipson Island Conservation Park which was proclaimed in 1967. The island is an important rookery for roosting sea birds, including a colony of little blue penguin. Lipson Island also bears the alternative French name of Ile d'Alembert.

The revolt was suppressed using the regular army, 14 peasants were wounded and 7 killed on site, 3 died later of wounds. The military casualties included 13 soldiers wounded and 1 officer killed. 60 of 65 peasant defendants were sentenced to death by a court-martial in Tallinn. Baltic governor-general Suvorov later reduced the sentences of 44 peasants to corporal punishment, 35 of whom were sentenced to exile in Siberia, while the remaining 21 defendants were set free. Historical context In the Governorate of Estonia, serfdom was abolished in 1816 (in comparison, in the whole Russian Empire it was abolished in 1861), however the land was not redistributed among the peasants and the corv√©e labor was preserved (until 1876). The March 19, 1856 manifesto of Tsar Alexander II spoke about further agrarian reforms, but the implementation was slow, and this sparked the unrest, including the Mahtra revolt.

The lower figure is Mercury or Hermes, the god or divine force of magic - as shown by his wings and caduceus. Wiccan views of divinity are generally theistic, and revolve around a Goddess and a Horned God, thereby being generally dualistic. In traditional Wicca, as expressed in the writings of Gerald Gardner and Doreen Valiente, the emphasis is on the theme of divine gender polarity, and the God and Goddess are regarded as equal and opposite divine cosmic forces. In some newer forms of Wicca, such as feminist or Dianic Wicca, the Goddess is given primacy or even exclusivity. In some forms of traditional witchcraft that share a similar duotheistic theology, the Horned God is given precedence over the Goddess.http://www.blue-moon-manor.com/articles/compared-to-wicca.html Some Wiccans are polytheists, believing in many different deities taken from various Pagan pantheons, while others would believe that, in the words of Dion Fortune, \\"all the Goddesses are one Goddess, and all the Gods one God\\". Some Wiccans are both duotheistic and polytheistic, (and sometimes a combination of duotheism, polytheism, and pantheism), in that they honor diverse pagan deities while reserving their worship for the Wiccan Goddess and Horned God, whom they regard as the supreme deities. (This approach is not dissimilar to ancient pagan pantheons where one divine couple, a god and goddess, were seen as the supreme deities of an entire pantheon.) Some see divinity as having a real, external existence; others see the Goddesses and Gods as archetypes or thoughtforms within the collective consciousness. According to several 20th century witches, most notably Gerald Gardner, the \\"father of Wicca\\", the witches' God and Goddess are the ancient gods of the British Isles: a Horned God of hunting, death and magic who rules over an after-world paradise (often referred to as the Summerland), and a goddess, the Great Mother (who is simultaneously the Eternal Virgin and the Primordial Enchantress), who gives regeneration and rebirth to souls of the dead and love to the living. The Goddess is especially connected to the Moon and stars and the sea, while the Horned God is connected to the Sun and the forests. Gardner explains that these are the tribal gods of the witches, just as the Egyptians had their tribal gods Isis and Osiris and the Jews had Elohim; he also states that a being higher than any of these tribal gods is recognised by the witches as Prime Mover, but remains unknowable, and is of little concern to them. The Goddess is often seen as having a triple aspect; that of the maiden, mother and crone. The God is traditionally seen as being the Horned God of the woods. A key belief in Wicca is that the gods are able to manifest in personal form, either through dreams, as physical manifestations, or through the bodies of Priestesses and Priests. Gardnerian Wicca as a denomination is primarily concerned with the priestess or priest's relationship to the Goddess and God. The Lady and Lord (as they are often called) are seen as primal cosmic beings, the source of limitless power, yet they are also familiar figures who comfort and nurture their children, and often challenge or even reprimand them.  Dualism  Wiccan theology largely revolves around ontological dualism. Ontological dualism is traditionally a sacred gender polarity between the complementary polar opposites of male and female, who are regarded as divine lovers. This kind of dualism is common to various religions; for example, Taoism, where it is represented through yin and yang, and Hinduism, where the lingam and the yoni are symbols of the sacred sexual union of a supreme god and goddess (often Shiva and Shakti). Ontological dualism is distinct from moral dualism in that moral dualism posits a supreme force of good and a supreme force of evil. There is no supreme force of evil in Wicca.  The God  In Wicca, the God is seen as the masculine form of divinity, and the polar opposite, and equal, to the Goddess. The God is traditionally seen as the Horned God, an archetypal deity with links to the Celtic Cernunnos, English folkloric Herne the Hunter, Greek Pan, Roman Faunus and Indian Pashupati. This was the God whom Gerald Gardner presented as the old God of the ancient Witches, and who was supported by Margaret Murray's theory of the pan-European witch religion, which has largely been discredited. Horns are traditionally a sacred symbol of male virility, and male gods with horns or antlers were common in pagan religious iconography throughout the ancient world. In Wicca, the Green Man is also often associated with the Horned God, though he does not always have horns. At different times of the Wiccan year the God is seen as different personalities. He is sometimes seen as the Oak King and the Holly King, who each rule for half of the year each. Oak and Holly are two European trees. Another view of the God is that of the sun god, who is particularly revered at the sabbat of Lughnasadh. Many Wiccans see these many facets, such as the sun god, horned god, sacrificial god, as all aspects of the same God, but a minority view them as separate polytheistic deities. The most exhaustive work on Wiccan ideas of the God is the book The Witches' God by Janet and Stewart Farrar. Triple Goddess symbol of waxing, full and waning moon  The Goddess  Traditionally in Wicca, the Goddess is seen as the Triple Goddess, meaning that she is the maiden, the mother and the crone. The mother aspect, the Mother Goddess, is perhaps the most important of these, and it was her that Gerald Gardner and Margaret Murray claimed was the ancient Goddess of the witches. Certain Wiccan traditions are Goddess-centric; this view differs from most traditions in that most others focus on a duality of goddess and god.  Interpretations  Gardner's explanation aside, individual interpretations of the exact natures of the gods differ significantly, since priests and priestesses develop their own relationships with the gods through intense personal work and revelation. Many have a duotheistic conception of deity as a Goddess (of Moon, Earth and sea) and a God (of forest, hunting and the animal realm). This concept is often extended into a kind of polytheism by the belief that the gods and goddesses of all cultures are aspects of this pair (or of the Goddess alone). Others hold the various gods and goddesses to be separate and distinct. Janet Farrar and Gavin Bone have observed that Wicca is becoming more polytheistic as it matures, and embracing a more traditional pagan worldview.Farrar, Janet and Bone, Gavin Progressive Witchcraft Many groups and individuals are drawn to particular deities from a variety of pantheons (often Celtic, Greek, or from elsewhere in Europe), whom they honour specifically. Some examples are Cernunnos and Brigit from Celtic mythology, Hecate, Lugh, and Diana. Still others do not believe in the gods as real personalities, yet attempt to have a relationship with them as personifications of universal principles or as Jungian archetypes. Some Wiccans conceive deities as akin to thoughtforms. Dryghten / The Star Goddess Dryghten, an Old English term for The Lord, is the term used by Patricia Crowther to refer to the universal pantheistic deity in Wicca. Gerald Gardner had initially called it, according to the cosmological argument, the Prime Mover, a term borrowed from Aristotle, but he claimed that the witches did not worship it, and considered it unknowable. It was referred to by Scott Cunningham by the term used in Neo-Platonism, \\"The One\\"; Many Wiccans whose practice involves study of the Kabbalah also regard the Gods and Goddesses they worship as being aspects or expressions of the ineffable supreme One. Some feminist Wiccans such as Starhawk use the term Star Goddess to describe the universal pantheistic deity that created the cosmos, and regard Her as a knowable Deity that can and should be worshipped.Charge of the Star Goddess --StarhawkCharge of the Star Goddess --\\"Book of the Goddess\\" (Co-edited by Julie Ann Rhoads and Ann Forfreedom in 1979-80): Contrary to the popular notion that the term \\"Star Goddess\\" comes from the Charge of the Goddess, a text sacred to many Wiccans, it actually originates from the Anderson Feri Tradition of (non-Wiccan) Witchcraft- of which Starhawk was an initiate. Within the Feri tradition the \\"Star Goddess\\" is the androgynous point of all creation - from which all things (including the dual God and Goddess) emanate.  \\"The One\\" / \\"The All\\"  In addition to the two main deities worshiped within Wicca‚Äîthe God and Goddess‚Äîthere are also several possible theological conceptions of an ultimate (impersonal) pantheistic or monistic divinity, known variously as Dryghtyn or \\"the One\\" or \\"The All.\\" This impersonal ultimate divinity is generally regarded as unknowable, and is acknowledged but not worshiped. This monistic idea of an ultimate impersonal divinity is not to be confused with the monotheistic idea of a single supreme personal deity. (Especially since Wicca traditionally honors its two supreme deities, the Goddess and the God, as equal.) This impersonal ultimate divinity may also be regarded as the underlying order or organising principle within the world, similar to religious ideas such as Tao and Atman. While not all Wiccans subscribe to this monistic idea of an impersonal, ultimate divinity, many do; and there are various philosophical constructions of how this ultimate divinity relates to the physical world of Nature. Unlike religions that place a divine creator outside of Nature, Wicca is generally pantheistic, seeing Nature as divine in itself. (The traditional Charge of the Goddess‚Äîthe most widely shared piece of liturgy within the religion‚Äîrefers to the Goddess as \\"the Soul of Nature\\" from whom all things come, and to which all things return. This theme is also expressed in the symbology of the magic cauldron as the womb of the Goddess, from which all creation emerges, and in which it is all dissolved before reemerging again.) Wicca emphasises the immanence of divinity within Nature, seeing the natural world as comprised both of spiritual substance as well as matter and physical energy. Many Wiccans also embrace the idea of the spiritual transcendence of divinity, and see this transcendence as compatible with the idea of immanence. In such a view, divinity and dimensions of spiritual existence (sometimes called \\"the astral planes\\") can exist outside the physical world, as well as extending into the material, and/or rising out of the material, intimately interwoven into the fabric of material existence in such a way that the spiritual affects the physical, and vice versa. (The conception of Nature as a vast, interconnected web of existence that is woven by the Goddess is very common within Wicca; an idea often connected with the Triple Goddess as personified by the Three Fates who weave the Web of Wyrd.) This combination of transcendence and immanence allows for the intermingling and the interaction of the unmanifest spiritual nature of the universe with the manifest physical universe; the physical reflects the spiritual, and vice versa. (An idea expressed in the occult maxim \\"As Above, So Below\\" which is also used within Wicca.) Given the usual interpretation of Wicca as a pantheistic and duotheistic/polytheistic religion, the monotheistic belief in a single \\"supreme deity\\" does not generally apply. An individual Wiccan's personal devotion may be centered on the traditional Horned God and the Moon Goddess of Wicca, a large number of divine \\"aspects\\" of the Wiccan God and Goddess, a large pantheon of individual pagan Gods, one specific pagan God and one specific pagan Goddess, or any combination of those perspectives. Accordingly, the religion of Wicca can be understood as duotheistic, henotheistic, pantheistic, polytheistic, or panentheistic depending upon the personal faith, cosmological belief, and philosophy of the individual Wiccan. If persons choose to use different personal names for their God or Goddess, such as Hecate (Greek) or Trivia (Roman), it is merely a familiar name to use. Both names refer to the same fundamental Goddess. Because Wicca (as with most neo-Pagan belief systems) is very eclectic there is no \\"right\\" way to practice the craft, no rulebook. The focus is on connecting with the \\"divine\\" however an individual chooses to conceptualise it.  Other  According to current Gardnerian Wiccans, the exact names of the Goddess and God of traditional Wicca remain an initiatory secret, and they are not given in Gardner's books about witchcraft.Philip Heselton, Wiccan Roots However, the collection of Toronto Papers of Gardner's writings has been investigated by American scholars such as Aidan Kelly, leading to the suggestion that their names are Cernunnos and Aradia. These are the names used in the prototype Book of Shadows known as Ye Bok of Ye Arte Magical.Hutton, R. The Triumph of the Moon. For most Wiccans, the Lord and Lady are seen as complementary polarities: male and female, force and form, comprehending all in their union; the tension and interplay between them is the basis of all creation, and this balance is seen in much of nature. The God and Goddess are sometimes symbolised as the Sun and Moon, and from her lunar associations the Goddess becomes a Triple Goddess with aspects of \\"Maiden\\", \\"Mother\\" and \\"Crone\\" corresponding to the Moon's waxing, full and waning phases. Some Wiccans hold the Goddess to be pre-eminent, since she contains and conceives all (Gaea or Mother Earth is one of her more commonly revered aspects); the God, commonly described as the Horned God or the Divine Child, is the spark of life and inspiration within her, simultaneously her lover and her child. This is reflected in the traditional structure of the coven, wherein \\"the High Priestess is the leader, with the High Priest as her partner; he acknowledges her primacy and supports and complements her leadership with the qualities of his own polarity.\\"Farrar, J> and Farrar, S (1981). A Witches' Bible (previously published as The Witches' Way. Custer, Washington: Phoenix. pp.181-2 In some traditions, notably Feminist branches of Dianic Wicca, the Goddess is seen as complete unto herself, and the God is not worshipped at all. Since the Goddess is said to conceive and contain all life within her, all beings are held to be divine. This is a key understanding conveyed in the Charge of the Goddess, one of the most important texts of Wicca, and is very similar to the Hermetic understanding that \\"God\\" contains all things, and in truth is all things.Scott, W. (transl.) (1993). Hermetica Libellus IX, p. 185. Boston:Shamballah. For some Wiccans, this idea also involves elements of animism, and plants, rivers, rocks (and, importantly, ritual tools) are seen as spiritual beings, facets of a single life. A key belief in Wicca is that the gods are able to manifest in personal form, either through dreams, as physical manifestations, or through the bodies of Priestesses and Priests. The latter kind of manifestation is the purpose of the ritual of Drawing down the Moon (or Drawing down the Sun), whereby the Goddess is called to descend into the body of the Priestess (or the God into the Priest) to effect divine possession.  The elements  While they are not regarded as deities, the classical elements are a featured key of the Wiccan world-view. Every manifest force or form is seen to express one of the four archetypal elements -- Earth, Air, Fire and Water -- or several in combination. This scheme is fundamentally identical with that employed in other Western Esoteric and Hermetic traditions, such as Theosophy and the Golden Dawn, which in turn were influenced by the Hindu system of tattvas. There is no consensus as to the exact nature of these elements. One popular system is the ancient Greek conception, where the elements correspond to matter (earth) and energy (fire), with the mediating elements (water, air) relating to the phases of matter (fire/earth mixtures). A more modern conception correlates the four elements to the four states of matter known to science: Solid (earth); Liquid (water); Gas (air); and Plasma (fire); with the akasha element corresponding to pure Energy. The Aristotelian system proposes a fifth or quintessential element, spirit (aether, akasha). The preferred version is a matter of ongoing dispute in the Wiccan community. There are other non-scientific conceptions, but they are not widely used among Wiccans. To some Wiccans, the five points of the frequently worn pentagram symbolize, among other things, the four elements with spirit presiding at the top. The pentagram is the symbol most commonly associated with Wicca in modern times. It is often circumscribed -- depicted within a circle -- and is usually (though not exclusively) shown with a single point upward. The inverse pentagram, with two points up, is associated with the Horned God (the two upper points being his horns), and is a symbol of the second degree initiation rite of traditional Wicca. The inverted pentagram is also used by Satanists; and for this reason, some Wiccans have alternatively been known to associate the inverted pentagram with evil.Crowley, Vivianne Wicca: The Old Religion in the New World. In geometry, the pentagram is an elegant expression of the golden ratio phi which is popularly connected with ideal beauty and was considered by the Pythagoreans to express truths about the hidden nature of existence. The five points of the pentagram have also been seen to correspond to the three aspects of the Goddess and the two aspects of the Horned God. In the casting of a magic circle, the four cardinal elements are visualised as contributing their influence from the four cardinal directions: Air in the east, Fire in the south, Water in the west and Earth in the north. There may be variations between groups though, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere, since these attributions are symbolic of (amongst other things) the path of the sun through the daytime sky. For example, in southern latitudes the sun reaches its hottest point in the northern part of the sky, and north is the direction of the Tropics, so this is commonly the direction given to Fire. Some Wiccan groups also modify the religious calendar (the Wheel of the Year) to reflect local seasonal changes; for instance, most Southern Hemisphere covens celebrate Samhain on April 30 and Beltane on November 1, reflecting the southern hemisphere's autumn and spring seasons.

The school Windsor High School and Sixth Form is a comprehensive school in Halesowen, West Midlands. It is among the largest schools in the region, with capacity for 1,600 pupils aged 11 to 18 and is heavily over-subscribed. The number of admissions for the year commencing 1 September 2007 was 280, which became the approved admissions number. The school has been awarded Artsmark Gold and Sportsmark Gold as well as the National Achievement Award for Improvement in Examinations in recent years. Windsor High School and Sixth Form is currently one of the top schools in Dudley LEA. It is currently ranked 3rd in Dudley, behind Old Swinford Hospital and Bishop Milner Catholic School. In 2005 65% of pupils at the school achieved 5 A*-C grades in their GCSEs. This was topped further by the following year of pupils in 2006/2007, where 90% of pupils achieved an A* grade, this is yet to be achieved by any other academic college, and boosts Windsor's positioning in the Midland school ranking into number 2. The school was erected during the 1930s by Worcestershire County Council as Halesowen County Secondary Modern Boys' School - a secondary modern school. Girls living in the local area attended nearby Halesowen County Secondary Modern Girls' School. During the late 1960s and early 1970s the school was known as the Halesowen County Secondary School for Boys (HCSSB) or more colloquially simply as 'The Boys' School'. The school colours were maroon and yellow. In September 1972, the schools became \\"Richmond Boys' School\\" and \\"Walton Girls' School\\", initially as secondary modern schools providing education for pupils aged 13‚Äì18 years following a reorganisation of education in Halesowen which saw a switch to three-tier schooling. A reorganisation in September 1982 saw both schools convert to 11‚Äì16 age range, with the sixth form being abolished in favour of a move to tertiary education which saw all of Halesowen's post 16 education facilities incorporated into an expanded Halesowen College. In September 1983, the first \\"Windsor High School\\" pupils joined, co-existing with the pupils from last two years of Richmond High School for Boys. Windsor High School came into full existence in September 1985 when the two single-sex schools fully merged into one mixed comprehensive, after this period of dual- school name. This marked the end of single sex state schools in the Dudley borough; all the other remaining single sex schools had been axed in July 1975 to make way for mixed comprehensives from September of that year. The new school existed entirely on the site of the boys' school, though with substantial extensions. In the early 1990s Windsor High became a Grant Maintained school. The Walton site on Bundle Hill was taken over by Halesowen College, who used it as an annexe until July 2003. It was demolished shortly afterwards and replaced by a housing estate. A sixth form centre opened at Windsor High in September 2010 - marking a return of sixth form facilities in Halesowen secondary schools after an absence of nearly 30 years. Recently, Windsor Academy Trust announced that Windsor High School and Sixth Form would receive some new unisex toilet facalities.

Wilkinson was born in Mount Oswald, County Durham, England, the 4th son of the Rev. Percival Spearman and Sophia Mary Anstruther. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and St John's College, Cambridge, gaining a B.A. in 1859. Admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1858, he was called to the Bar in 1861. Wilkinson played sixty one first-class matches between 1862 and 1874. He played nineteen times for Middlesex County Cricket Club (1864-1874), five for Yorkshire (1865-1868), the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) (1867-1871), Gentlemen of the South (1862-1864), Surrey Club (1865-1866), Gentlemen (1865), Gentlemen of Middlesex (1865), Southgate (1866-1868), North of the Thames (1867), Gentlemen of England (1869-1874) and Gentlemen of Marylebone Cricket Club (1870). He also appeared in non first-class cricket for Surrey Club and Ground in 1862. A right-handed batsman, Wilkinson scored 1,351 runs at an average of 13.64, with a highest score of 84 not out against Gentlemen of England. He took 53 wickets, bowling right arm round arm slow, at 22.62 with a best of 6 for 52 against the MCC. He took 43 catches in the field. A good all-rounder, he scored runs in a prolific manner in club cricket and took many wickets. He was chairman of the meeting when Durham County Cricket Club was founded in 1874. A barrister who practised on the North-Eastern Circuit, he became Conveyancing Counsel to the Court of Chancery of the County Palatine of Durham in 1882. In 1877, he married Marion Harriet Jones, eldest daughter of the Rev. Francis Jones, vicar of Moreton Pinkney. A son, Cyril Wilkinson, captained Surrey from 1914 to 1920, playing over fifty matches and captained Surrey to the County Championship title in 1914. Wilkinson died in Anerley, Kent, England in December 1905, aged 70.

Every bounded operator becomes a contraction after suitable scaling. The analysis of contractions provides insight into the structure of operators, or a family of operators. The theory of contractions on Hilbert space is largely due to B√©la Sz≈ëkefalvi-Nagy and Ciprian Foias.  Contractions on a Hilbert space  If T is a contraction acting on a Hilbert space \\\\mathcal{H}, the following basic objects associated with T can be defined. The defect operators of T are the operators DT = (1 ‚àí T*T)¬Ω and DT* = (1 ‚àí TT*)¬Ω. The square root is the positive semidefinite one given by the spectral theorem. The defect spaces \\\\mathcal{D}_T and \\\\mathcal{D}_{T*} are the ranges Ran(DT) and Ran(DT*) respectively. The positive operator DT induces an inner product on \\\\mathcal{H}. The inner product space can be identified naturally with Ran(DT). A similar statement holds for \\\\mathcal{D}_{T*}. The defect indices of T are the pair :(\\\\dim\\\\mathcal{D}_T, \\\\dim\\\\mathcal{D}_{T^*}). The defect operators and the defect indices are a measure of the non-unitarity of T. A contraction T on a Hilbert space can be canonically decomposed into an orthogonal direct sum :T = \\\\Gamma \\\\oplus U where U is a unitary operator and Œì is completely non- unitary in the sense that it has no reducing subspaces on which its restriction is unitary. If U = 0, T is said to be a completely non-unitary contraction. A special case of this decomposition is the Wold decomposition for an isometry, where Œì is a proper isometry. Contractions on Hilbert spaces can be viewed as the operator analogs of cos Œ∏ and are called operator angles in some contexts. The explicit description of contractions leads to (operator-)parametrizations of positive and unitary matrices. Dilation theorem for contractions Sz.-Nagy's dilation theorem, proved in 1953, states that for any contraction T on a Hilbert space H, there is a unitary operator U on a larger Hilbert space K ‚äá H such that if P is the orthogonal projection of K onto H then Tn = P Un P for all n > 0. The operator U is called a dilation of T and is uniquely determined if U is minimal, i.e. K is the smallest closed subspace invariant under U and U* containing H. In fact define :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathcal{H}=H\\\\oplus H\\\\oplus H \\\\oplus \\\\cdots ,} the orthogonal direct sum of countably many copies of H. Let V be the isometry on \\\\mathcal H defined by :\\\\displaystyle{V(\\\\xi_1,\\\\xi_2,\\\\xi_3,\\\\dots)=(T\\\\xi_1, \\\\sqrt{I-T^*T}\\\\xi_1,\\\\xi_2,\\\\xi_3,\\\\dots).} Let :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathcal{K}=\\\\mathcal{H} \\\\oplus \\\\mathcal{H}.} Define a unitary W on \\\\mathcal K by :\\\\displaystyle{W(x,y)=(Vx+(I-VV^*)y,-V^*y).} W is then a unitary dilation of T with H considered as the first component of \\\\mathcal{H}\\\\subset \\\\mathcal{K}. The minimal dilation U is obtained by taking the restriction of W to the closed subspace generated by powers of W applied to H. Dilation theorem for contraction semigroups There is an alternative proof of Sz.-Nagy's dilation theorem, which allows significant generalisations. Let G be a group, U(g) a unitary representation of G on a Hilbert space K and P an orthogonal projection onto a closed subspace H = PK of K. The operator-valued function :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\Phi(g)=PU(g)P,} with values in operators on K satisfies the positive-definiteness condition : \\\\sum \\\\lambda_i\\\\overline{\\\\lambda_j} \\\\Phi(g_j^{-1}g_i) = PT^*TP\\\\ge 0, where :\\\\displaystyle{T=\\\\sum \\\\lambda_i U(g_i).} Moreover, :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\Phi(1)=P.} Conversely, every operator-valued positive-definite function arises in this way. Recall that every (continuous) scalar-valued positive-definite function on a topological group induces an inner product and group representation œÜ(g) = „ÄàUg v, v„Äâ where Ug is a (strongly continuous) unitary representation (see Bochner's theorem). Replacing v, a rank-1 projection, by a general projection gives the operator-valued statement. In fact the construction is identical; this is sketched below. Let \\\\mathcal H be the space of functions on G of finite support with values in H with inner product :\\\\displaystyle{(f_1,f_2)=\\\\sum_{g,h} (\\\\Phi(h^{-1}g)f_1(g),f_2(h)).} G acts unitarily on \\\\mathcal H by :\\\\displaystyle{U(g)f(x)=f(g^{-1}x).} Moreover, H can be identified with a closed subspace of \\\\mathcal H using the isometric embedding sending v in H to fv with :f_v(g)=\\\\delta_{g,1} v. \\\\, If P is the projection of \\\\mathcal H onto H, then :\\\\displaystyle{PU(g)P=\\\\Phi(g),} using the above identification. When G is a separable topological group, Œ¶ is continuous in the strong (or weak) operator topology if and only if U is. In this case functions supported on a countable dense subgroup of G are dense in \\\\mathcal H, so that \\\\mathcal H is separable. When G = Z any contraction operator T defines such a function Œ¶ through :\\\\displaystyle \\\\Phi(0)=I, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\Phi(n)=T^n,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\Phi(-n)=(T^*)^n, for n > 0. The above construction then yields a minimal unitary dilation. The same method can be applied to prove a second dilation theorem of Sz._Nagy for a one-parameter strongly continuous contraction semigroup T(t) (t ‚â• 0) on a Hilbert space H. had previously proved the result for one-parameter semigroups of isometries, The theorem states that there is a larger Hilbert space K containing H and a unitary representation U(t) of R such that :\\\\displaystyle{T(t)=PU(t)P} and the translates U(t)H generate K. In fact T(t) defines a continuous operator-valued positove- definite function Œ¶ on R through :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\Phi(0)=I, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\Phi(t)=T(t),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\Phi(-t)= T(t)^*,} for t > 0. Œ¶ is positive-definite on cyclic subgroups of R, by the argument for Z, and hence on R itself by continuity. The previous construction yields a minimal unitary representation U(t) and projection P. The Hille-Yosida theorem assigns a closed unbounded operator A to every contractive one-parameter semigroup T'(t) through :\\\\displaystyle{A\\\\xi=\\\\lim_{t\\\\downarrow 0} {1\\\\over t}(T(t)-I)\\\\xi,} where the domain on A consists of all Œæ for which this limit exists. A is called the generator of the semigroup and satisfies : \\\\displaystyle{-\\\\Re (A\\\\xi,\\\\xi)\\\\ge 0} on its domain. When A is a self-adjoint operator :\\\\displaystyle{T(t)=e^{At},} in the sense of the spectral theorem and this notation is used more generally in semigroup theory. The cogenerator of the semigroup is the contraction defined by : \\\\displaystyle{T=(A+I)(A-I)^{-1}.} A can be recovered from T using the formula :\\\\displaystyle{A=(T+I)(T-I)^{-1}.} In particular a dilation of T on K ‚äÉ H immediately gives a dilation of the semigroup. Functional calculus Let T be totally non-unitary contraction on H. Then the minimal unitary dilation U of T on K ‚äÉ H is unitarily equivalent to a direct sum of copies the bilateral shift operator, i.e. multiplication by z on L2(S1). If P is the orthogonal projection onto H then for f in L‚àû = L‚àû(S1) it follows that the operator f(T) can be defined by :\\\\displaystyle{f(T)\\\\xi=Pf(U)\\\\xi.} Let H‚àû be the space of bounded holomorphic functions on the unit disk D. Any such function has boundary values in L‚àû and is uniquely determined by these, so that there is an embedding H‚àû ‚äÇ L‚àû. For f in H‚àû, f(T) can be defined without reference to the unitary dilation. In fact if :\\\\displaystyle{f(z)=\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} a_n z^n} for z < 1, then for r < 1 :\\\\displaystyle{f_r(z))=\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} r^n a_n z^n} is holomorphic on z < 1/r. In that case fr(T) is defined by the holomorphic functional calculus and f(T) can be defined by :\\\\displaystyle{f(T)\\\\xi=\\\\lim_{r\\\\rightarrow 1} f_r(T)\\\\xi.} The map sending f to f(T) defines an algebra homomorphism of H‚àû into bounded operators on H. Moreover, if :\\\\displaystyle{f^\\\\sim(z)=\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} a_n \\\\overline{z}^n,} then :\\\\displaystyle{f^\\\\sim(T)=f(T^*)^*.} This map has the following continuity property: if a uniformly bounded sequence fn tends almost everywhere to f, then fn(T) tends to f(T) in the strong operator topology. For t ‚â• 0, let et be the inner function :\\\\displaystyle{e_t(z)=\\\\exp t{z+1\\\\over z-1}.} If T is the cogenerator of a one-parameter semigroup of completely non-unitary contractions T(t), then :\\\\displaystyle{T(t)=e_t(T)} and :\\\\displaystyle{T={1\\\\over 2}I -{1\\\\over 2}\\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-t}T(t)\\\\, dt.} C0 contractions A completely non-unitary contraction T is said to belong to the class C0 if and only if f(T) = 0 for some non-zero f in H‚àû. In this case the set of such f forms an ideal in H‚àû. It has the form œÜ ‚ãÖ H‚àû where g is an inner function, i.e. such that œÜ = 1 on S1: œÜ is uniquely determined up to multiplication by a complex number of modulus 1 and is called the minimal function of T. It has properties analogous to the minimal polynomial of a matrix. The minimal function œÜ admits a canonical factorization :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\varphi(z) = c B(z) e^{-P(z)},} where c=1, B(z) is a Blaschke product :\\\\displaystyle{B(z)=\\\\prod \\\\left[{\\\\lambda_i\\\\over \\\\lambda_i} {\\\\lambda_i -z \\\\over 1-\\\\overline{\\\\lambda}_i }\\\\right]^{m_i},} with :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\sum m_i(1-\\\\lambda_i) <\\\\infty,} and P(z) is holomorphic with non-negative real part in D. By the Herglotz representation theorem, :\\\\displaystyle{P(z) =\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} {1 + e^{-i\\\\theta}z\\\\over 1 -e^{-i\\\\theta}z} \\\\, d\\\\mu(\\\\theta)} for some non-negative finite measure Œº on the circle: in this case, if non-zero, Œº must be singular with respect to Lebesgue measure. In the above decomposition of œÜ, either of the two factors can be absent. The minimal function œÜ determines the spectrum of T. Within the unit disk, the spectral values are the zeros of œÜ. There are at most countably many such Œªi, all eigenvalues of T, the zeros of B(z). A point of the unit circle does not lie in the spectrum of T if and only if œÜ has a holomorphic continuation to a neighbourhood of that point. œÜ reduces to a Blaschke product exactly when H equals the closure of the direct sum (not necessarily orthogonal) of the generalized eigenspaces :\\\\displaystyle{H_i={\\\\xi:(T-\\\\lambda_i I)^{m_i} \\\\xi=0}.} Quasi-similarity Two contractions T1 and T2 are said to be quasi-similar when there are bounded operators A, B with trivial kernel and dense range such that :\\\\displaystyle{AT_1=T_2A,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, BT_2=T_1B.} The following properties of a contraction T are preserved under quasi-similarity: *being unitary *being completely non-unitary *being in the class C0 *being multiplicity free, i.e. having a commutative commutant Two quasi-similar C0 contractions have the same minimal function and hence the same spectrum. The classification theorem for C0 contractions states that two multiplicity free C0 contractions are quasi-similar if and only if they have the same minimal function (up to a scalar multiple). A model for multiplicity free C0 contractions with minimal function œÜ is given by taking : \\\\displaystyle{H=H^2\\\\ominus \\\\varphi H^2,} where H2 is the Hardy space of the circle and letting T be multiplication by z. Such operators are called Jordan blocks and denoted S(œÜ). As a generalization of Beurling's theorem, the commutant of such an operator consists exactly of operators œà(T) with œà in H‚âà, i.e. multiplication operators on H2 corresponding to functions in H‚âà. A C0 contraction operator T is multiplicity free if and only if it is quasi-similar to a Jordan block (necessarily corresponding the one corresponding to its minimal function). Examples. *If a contraction T if quasi-similar to an operator S with :\\\\displaystyle{Se_i=\\\\lambda_i e_i} with the Œªi's distinct, of modulus less than 1, such that :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\sum (1-\\\\lambda_i) < 1} and (ei) is an orthonormal basis, then S, and hence T, is C0 and multiplicity free. Hence H is the closure of direct sum of the Œªi-eigenspaces of T, each having multiplicity one. This can also be seen directly using the definition of quasi-similarity. *The results above can be applied equally well to one- parameter semigroups, since, from the functional calculus, two semigroups are quasi-similar if and only if their cogenerators are quasi-similar. Classification theorem for C0 contractions: Every C0 contraction is canonically quasi-similar to a direct sum of Jordan blocks. In fact every C0 contraction is quasi-similar to a unique operator of the form :\\\\displaystyle{S=S(\\\\varphi_1)\\\\oplus S(\\\\varphi_1\\\\varphi_2)\\\\oplus S(\\\\varphi_1\\\\varphi_2\\\\varphi_3) \\\\oplus \\\\cdots } where the œÜn are uniquely determined inner functions, with œÜ1 the minimal function of S and hence T.

It originally aired from 14 October 2001 to 18 November 2001. Overview The series follows the trials and tribulations of six fictional Australian soldiers interned at the Changi prisoner of war camp in Singapore during World War II. Changi is presented as a frame story, with six older war veterans reuniting in 1999 to share their experiences and memories of their time as young men at the camp. The series is also notable for featuring scenes of toilet humour and black comedy in an otherwise serious production, a deliberate inclusion on the part of writer John Doyle, better known for his comedic alter-ego Rampaging Roy Slaven. Doyle originally envisaged the series as a sitcom with the working title of Worn Out & Weary and he first pitched the idea to the ABC as such. It was only later in the writing phase that he decided to switch to drama, albeit with elements of humour remaining as a prominent feature. A total of 53 sets had to be built for the miniseries, standing in for the camp, parts of Singapore and the Malayan jungle. The series was shot in four locations and in studio sets around Sydney. The ABC invested AUD 6 million (USD ) on the production, a figure representing one- sixth of the ABC's annual drama budget. Two cast members portraying the older versions of the main characters previously served in World War II. Bud Tingwell served as a fighter pilot while Slim DeGrey was actually imprisoned as a POW at the Changi camp after the fall of Singapore to the Japanese. The series was directed by Kate Woods who, at the time, was best known for directing the successful Australian film Looking for Alibrandi (2000) and who, in more recent years, has become a successful television director in the United States.

Six ageing former POWs who spent three and a half years in Changi are each preparing for the reunion of 'The Secret 9', the name of the close-knit group of six POWs whose mutual support and friendship sustained them throughout their experiences in the camp. Since the end of the war, the group have held reunions every nine years and this upcoming one will most likely be their last. As the date of the reunion draws near, each of the veterans find his memories ignited by a sight or sound associated with their traumatic experiences. Reception The series Changi was a ratings success. The final episode, which aired on ABC-TV on Sunday evening on 18 November 2001, was the second-most watched show that night in Australia. Reviews for the series were mixed. Robin Oliver, writing in The Sydney Morning Herald, declared the series to be \\"immensely satisfying\\" and Robert Fidgeon, in Melbourne's Herald Sun, wrote that it was \\"one of the finest pieces of drama ever produced (in Australia)\\" Michael Fitzgerald, writing in Time, said that the series, despite some flaws, was \\"the finest, most thoughtful local drama since Australia's miniseries heyday in the 1980s... The series isn't about the history of Changi, it's about the idea of Changi and how it refracts through the years to become something repressed, mythologised and feared.... Most movingly, it's about the transfer of memory to the next generation.\\" Christopher Bantick, writing in Brisbane's Courier Mail, was scathing in his review about the series. He said that the series \\"is a long way from representing fairly or in a balanced way what went on in the notorious camp and is close to being a profligate waste of public money\\". Bantick referred to Changi as \\"sick\\" and a \\"bomb\\" that \\"deserves to fail.\\" Stephen Garton, writing in 2002 in the Journal of Australian Studies, believed the series to be a missed opportunity. In his view, Changi portrayed \\"an enfeebled narrative of the POW experience ‚Äì narrow, parochial, inward-looking, blind to the complexities of former prisoner's voices but attuned to a nostalgic vision... of the Anzac Legend.\\" Controversy and criticism The series Changi attracted considerable controversy when it first aired in 2001 and drew both praise and criticism from military historians, media commentators and real- life former POWs. Peter Stanley, principal historian at the Australian War Memorial 1987‚Äì2007, was highly critical of the series: \\"It gives viewers a misleading and unrealistic idea of the POW experience and of their captors. The danger is that people either believe what they see on television or don't know what's wrong and right.\\" According to Stanley, the series contained a number of historical inaccuracies. * The massacre of POWs that occurs in the final episode never happened in the real Changi. * POWs are depicted as saluting Japanese officers whereas in reality, they were required to bow. Also, the real-life Changi in-mates had to endure frequent roll-calls ('Tenko') which do not occur in the TV version. * In the series, POWs and Japanese guards mingle frequently but in reality, the prisoners and the Japanese kept apart and rarely saw each other, the POWs having to run the camp themselves. * In the series, the POWs mock their captors in a camp concert but according to Stanley, that could never have happened as 'Japanese guards were very conscious of preserving their dignity. In real POW camps, prisoners dared not make fun of Japanese guards. It just simply wouldn't have happened.' * The camp is portrayed in the series as quite small, housing only a few hundred prisoners but the real Changi was much larger, being a permanent or temporary home to many thousands of Allied POWs. A number of real-life former in-mates of Changi were interviewed for their opinions on the series and the responses varied greatly. Some ex-POWs declared the series to be a moving, accurate portrayal whilst others dismissed it as unrealistic, overly sanitised, inaccurate and guilty of failing to depict the hardships of the real camp. 'Half of its rubbish!', declared one former POW. Historian Michael Cathcart praised the series, calling it 'a moving series that captured the suffering and comradeship that were at the heart of the prisoner of war experience...and a celebration of the powerful egalitarian spirit that is the Australian story' John Doyle defended his work. 'It's a series that runs the risk of offending everyone and satisfying no one'. Doyle argued that the series 'was not history but art ‚Äì an effort to be honest to the spirit not the facts of Changi. When you try to deal with such a tricky subject, you have to abandon naturalism.' Doyle claimed that he wanted the series to show how 'Australian humour and mateship allowed Australians to survive in greater numbers than other groups of prisoners.' Awards The production won the Logie Award for the Most Outstanding Mini Series/Telemovie in 2002. Actors Geoff Morrell, Matthew Newton and Bud Tingwell were also nominated for Most Outstanding Actor Logies, and the mini series also received 3 AFI Award nominations.

She was the youngest daughter of Charles of Valois and his third wife Mahaut of Ch√¢tillon. Early life Blanche grew up at the French court of her cousin Charles IV of France, who was a nephew to her father. She spent much time with Charles' wife Marie, who was an aunt to her future husband. A betrothal between Blanche and Charles, eldest son of John of Bohemia was contracted in 1323.William M. Mahoney, The History of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, (ABC-CLIO, 2011), 49-50. Charles had been staying at the French court as he had been sent by his father to be educated; he had been baptised Wenceslaus but changed his name upon the betrothal in honour of King Charles. The importance of Blanche's position grew when King Charles died without male heirs and so Blanche's brother succeeded as Philip VI of France. He had his son and heir John betrothed and later married to Charles' sister, Jutta. Marriage At Prague in May 1329, Blanche and Charles were married. The couple lived apart for the first several years of marriage as they were both about 13 years old; Blanche lived in Luxembourg whilst Charles was in Italy focusing on securing the Empire with his father. The couple began to live together upon Charles' return in 1334, when they are now about 18 years old, at which time, the couple were made Margrave and Margravine of Moravia. Blanche entered Prague on 12 June with French ladies and courtiers. The couple clashed with the Bohemian nobility who had gained strength because of King John's frequent trips abroad; despite this challenge, Blanche learned Czech and German, had a social life and would remain in Bohemia when Charles traveled abroad. Within the first year of married life, the couple had a short-lived son. Blanche was close to her mother-in-law, Charles' stepmother Beatrice, as French was the native language of both women, they communicated easily however Blanche was more popular at court than Beatrice; she was always compared unfavourably to Blanche and this was possibly because Beatrice never learned Czech or German whilst Blanche did. John put pressure on Blanche due to the birth of only a daughter, Margaret and the absence of a living male child. The pressure resulted in Blanche moving to Brno in 1337; for the next several years, Blanche and Charles had no children. However, the couple had a second daughter in 1342 named Katherine. On 11 July 1346, Charles was elected King of Germany in opposition to Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV. His election was supported by Pope Clement VI, who was at odds with Louis. While the conflict in Germany continued, Blanche's father-in-law John allied himself with Blanche's brother, King Philip. John was killed in the Battle of Cr√©cy (26 August 1346). Charles escaped the battlefield relatively unharmed and succeeded to the Kingdom of Bohemia. Blanche became queen consort. On 11 October 1347, Louis IV died suddenly and Charles gained wider recognition as King of Germany. However, less than a year later on 1 August 1348, Blanche died after a short illness aged thirty-two. Her death was a large blow to Charles who still did not have a son and heir, large political loss with France and a full-fledged marriage. Desperate for a son, Charles remarried the following year to Anna of Bavaria. Seven years after the death of Blanche, Charles became Holy Roman Emperor; he was eventually succeeded by his son Sigismund, whom he had with his fourth wife Elizabeth of Pomerania. Blanche was buried in Saint Vitus, Prague Castle. Children Blanche and Charles had two daughters: * Margaret of Bohemia (1335‚Äì1349). Married Louis I of Hungary.Francis Dvornik, The Slavs in European History and Civilization, (Rutgers University Press, 1962), 52. * Katharine of Bohemia (19 August 1342 - 26 April 1395). She first married Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria,From Famous Empresses to Unspectacular Queens, Karl-Ulrich Jaschke, Queens and Queenship in Medieval Europe, ed. Anne J. Duggan, (The Boydell Press,1997), 102. then Otto V, Duke of Bavaria.

Biography Originally from the family of the Martins of Long Melford, Suffolk, Martin was born in Birmingham. He was born in 1807 and baptised on 22 May 1807. He was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School, Eton, and St John's College, Cambridge. He was appointed Chief Justice by the Colonial Office in January 1841 (warrant under Royal sign manual 5 February 1841; sworn 10 January 1842), and arrived in New Zealand in August 1841.

Martin was appointed one of the two lay members of the council of St. John‚Äôs College in 1850; and acted as a co-examiner with Bishop Selwyn of candidates for ordination in the Anglican church. He wrote protests against the Crown's disregard of its moral obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi and the invasion of Taranaki. He resigned on 12 June 1857, and was knighted in 1860. Martin was one of the authors of a book written in support of the native people of New Zealand called Extracts of letters from New Zealand on the war question. He created it with his wife, Mary Ann, George and Sarah Selwyn, Caroline Abraham and her husband. This book was distributed privately after being printed in London in 1861. He returned to England in 1874, dying at Torquay in 1880. Sir William was survived by family, some of whom still live in Dunedin, and the South Island of New Zealand.

History The bank was formed from the merging of various banks that had existed throughout the decades: * Bian Chiang Bank, established in 1924 in Kuching by Wee Kheng Chiang. Its primary activities were business financing and the issuance of bills of exchange. It was renamed Bank of Commerce Berhad (BCB) following its purchase by the UMNO-owned Fleet Group in 1979. The bank had RM367 million in total assets and total shareholders' funds of RM12.8 million in 1982. * Ban Hin Lee Bank (BHLB), established 1935 in Penang by Yeap Chor Ee. Its original focus was serving local businessmen in their trading and merchant activities. In the 1960s it branched out into real estate and home financing and by 1990 it had become a modern financial institution. It was then listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange on 7 January 1991. * Bank Lippo: founded in 1948 with its headquarters in Tangerang, Indonesia. * Bank Niaga: established as a national private bank in 1955, it later expanded to become a full-service bank in 1974. * Southern Bank Berhad (SBB): founded as Southern Banking Ltd in 1965, starting out in Penang and expanded to Kuala Lumpur. Its products included wealth-management products, credit cards and loans for small and medium enterprises (SME). *Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Berhad (BBMB), incorporated in 1965. Set up in line with government initiatives to increase Bumiputra participation in the national economy, the bank grew to be one of the largest, with branches throughout the country. By 1980 it had become the largest bank in the country in terms of assets and was the first domestic bank to have operations in New York, London, Tokyo, Bahrain and Hong Kong. * United Asian Bank Berhad (UAB), established in Kuala Lumpur in 1972. UAB created out of the merger of the Malaysian operations and branches of three Indian-owned banks: Indian Overseas Bank, Indian Bank, and United Commercial Bank. The Government of India had nationalised the largest banks in India, including these three, and Malaysian law prohibited the operation in Malaysia of branches of government-owned foreign banks. UAB's primary purpose was to encourage enterprise among less prosperous sections of the country. * Pertanian Baring Sanwa Multinational Berhad (PBS); incorporated by Bank Pertanian, Baring Brothers, Multinational Bank of the United Kingdom, and Sanwa Bank of Japan in 1974. It was managed by Baring Brothers and provided corporate advisory and funding services to multinationals. It was renamed Commerce International Merchant Bankers Berhad (CIMB) in 1986 as a result of BCB replacing Bank Pertanian as the controlling shareholder of PBS. Corporate finance remained CIMB's main focus and stock broking was added to its range of services. Bank of Commerce acquired UAB in 1991, in which consequently increased Bank of Commerce's branch network almost fourfold. The listed holding company was then renamed Commerce-Asset Holdings Berhad (CAHB). BBMB merged with CAHB to form the Bumiputra-Commerce Bank in 1999. SBB acquired Ban Hin Lee Bank Berhad and two smaller finance companies, Perdana Finance Berhad and Cempaka Finance Berhad in 2000 as part of a government initiated banking consolidation plan. CIMB was listed on the main board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange in 2003. In the same year, CIMB Islamic was launched providing customers with Syariah compliant solutions. A year later, it acquired 70% of Commerce Trust Berhad (CTB) and Commerce Asset Fund Managers Berhad (CAFM), leading to the formation of CIMB-Principal, a joint venture with the Principal Group of the United States. Then in 2005, CIMB acquired Singapore based G.K. Goh, which was established in 1979 as an international stock broker. This led to the formation of CIMB-GK, CIMB's international investment banking operations. In 2005, CAHB announced a decision to create a universal bank by combining its commercial and investment banks. Following this announcement, Bumiputra- Commerce Group was acquired by CIMB. As part of the exercise, CAHB was renamed Bumiputra-Commerce Holdings and it completed its restructuring exercise in January 2006. The new CIMB Group was known as a universal bank. It made a transition to a full-service banking provider serving corporates to individuals. Then in March, CIMB Group acquired SBB after extensive negotiations. After the acquisition, on 7 September 2006, CIMB Group was launched by the then Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dato' Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. In 2007, CIMB Group launched its presence in both Thailand and USA through the establishment of CIMB-GK Securities (Thailand) Ltd. and CIMB-GK Securities (USA) Inc. In November, CIMB Foundation launched as a not-for- profit organisation that will carry out the group's corporate social responsibility. 2008: CIMB Group entered into an agreement for a 19.99% stake in Bank of Yingkou adding mainland China to the Group's network. In the same year CIMB Group undertook the merger of PT Bank Niaga TBK with PT Bank Lippo Tbk to create the sixth-largest bank in Indonesia. CIMB Group and the Principal Financial Group launched CIMB-Principal Islamic Asset Management also in that year. Lastly, CIMB Group entered into an agreement with Financial Institutions Development Fund to purchase a 42.13% stake in Bank Thai Public Company. In 2009, CIMB Bank and CIMB Islamic moved to a new headquarters, the 39-storey Menara Bumiputra-Commerce which houses CIMB Group's consumer banking franchises. The building site was the location of the bank's predecessors, Bank Bumiputra and the United Asian Bank. In the same year, CIMB Thai was officially launched with its new brand and logo unveiled to the public in May 2009 by Khun Korn Chatikavanji, Thailand's Minister of Finance. In September, CIMB Group set up retail banking services in Singapore through CIMB Bank Singapore. CIMB Group expanded to Cambodia through the fully owned subsidiary CIMB Bank Plc in 2010. The first branch, which also serves as the headquarters, was officially launched in Phnom Penh on 19 November 2010. In 2012, CIMB Group purchased the Asian investment banking business of Royal Bank of Scotland, including the RBS franchise in Australia for GBP173.9 million (MYR849.4 million). CIMB claimed to become the largest investment banking franchise based in Asia Pacific (ex-Japan). CIMB is one of the world's largest Islamic banks.

Biography  Youp was born and raised in the Gooi, an upper-class region to the southeast of Amsterdam. He was one of the founding members of Cabaret NAR (Cabaret Jester). In the early 1980s Cabaret NAR's success declined and Youp moved on as a solo artist. His big break came in 1983 on KRO's \\"De alles is anders-show\\". His energetic performance made him a household name overnight. In his 1989 end-of-year show he ridiculed Buckler, a low-alcohol beer brewed by Heineken, as a result sales plummeted and the brand was eventually withdrawn from the market. Youp has often cited this as the best joke in his career and has subsequently referred to it in all his retrospective shows. Youp van 't Hek is the brother of field hockey international Tom van 't Hek.

The constant factor in his musical backup during almost his entire career has been Ton Scherpenzeel (keyboardist of Kayak), who has composed almost all of his songs. In most of his shows he also worked with multi-instrumentalist Rens van der Zalm. The music to Youp's songs is mostly played on piano, accordion, violin and acoustic guitar, which reflects Youp's preference for classical music. One example of this is his rendition of the song Flappie, ostensibly about a Christmas he experienced in 1961.  Columns and books  Youp has written columns on sports and later on general topics for NRC Handelsblad since 1988. Several collections of these columns have been published by publishing. This company was founded by a friend of Youp, and has printed the texts of Van 't Hek's shows from the very first, unsuccessful days, when publishing them seemed a waste of money. Because of this, Youp never switched publishers.

He is often referred to as \\"Superpippo\\". Baudo has also been the artistic director and president of Teatro Stabile di Catania. Career Baudo was born in Militello in Val di Catania. While studying law at the University of Catania, he became involved in entertainment as an actor and host. He also learned to play the piano. He graduated with a degree in law, despite his interest in entertainment. At the end of the 1950s, he became a singer and pianist for Orchestra Moonlight. In 1959, for the first time, Pippo appeared on Italian TV during a \\"Caravella dei Successi\\" episode, broadcast from Palermo. He gained success hosting several RAI programmes, as well as serving as the artistic director. Pippo signed to Mediaset but has never been able to reclaim his past success. He experienced a resurgence in his career when he hosted \\"Novecento\\" on RAI, which led to re- hosting the popular Sunday-afternoon show named \\"Domenica In\\" and the \\"Festival della canzone italiana\\". In the 1970s, he helped establish and work for the Catania-based private channel \\"Antenna Sicilia\\". In 1987, he hosted \\"Festival\\" on Mediaset after a controversy with RAI president, Enrico Manca. However, years later he worked again for RAI; his show \\"Serata d'Onore\\" having been broadcast on Rai Due. In the opening night of the Sanremo Music Festival 1995, shortly after the beginning of the show a man, Pino Pagano, sat on the edge of the gallery of the theater showed the intention to commit suicide jumping below: he was eventually stopped by Baudo himself amid the applause of the audience. In 1997, he signed again to Mediaset, but his shows \\"La canzone del secolo\\" and \\"Tiramis√π\\" had very little success. In 1999, Baudo was asked by Rai Tre to host a new prime time program, \\"Giorno dopo Giorno\\", it is now called \\"Novecento\\". In 2002, he hosted the Festival di Sanremo, after the 2001 edition had been a fiasco. He chose co-hosts Manuela Arcuri and Vittoria Belvedere. He left RAI in 2004, but he came back in 2005, with the programme \\"Sabato Italiano\\", on Rai Uno. On 2 October 2005 he hosted for the eighth time the Sunday-afternoon program Domenica in (1979-1985, 1991-1992, 2005‚Äì2010). In 2008, he hosted, for his thirteenth time, the Festival di Sanremo, exceeding Mike Bongiorno, who hosted eleven times. Personal life In 2004, Baudo and his wife, Italian soprano Katia Ricciarelli, divorced, who had been married since 1986. He has two children, Alessandro, born in 1962, who lives in Australia, and Tiziana, born in 1970 from his first wife.

The drug was originally developed in the USSR in the 1970s GB Patent 1262830 - NOVEL SYDNONIMINE DERIVATIVE for a variety of indications including asthenia, apathy, adynamia and some clinical aspects of depression and schizophrenia. Mesocarb was used for counteracting the sedative effects of benzodiazepine drugs, increasing workload capacity and cardiovascular function, treatment of ADHD and hyperactivity in children, as a nootropic, and as a drug to enhance resistance to extremely cold temperatures. It is also listed as having antidepressant and anticonvulsant properties. The drug has been found to act as a selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor by blocking the actions of the dopamine transporter (DAT), and lacks the dopamine release characteristic of stimulants such as dextroamphetamine. It was the most selective DAT inhibitor amongst an array of other DAT inhibitors to which it was compared. Mesocarb was sold in Russia as 5 milligram tablets under the brand name Sydnocarb. Hydroxylated metabolites can be detected in urine for up to 10 days after consumption. The drug is almost unknown in the western world and is neither used in medicine or studied scientifically to any great extent outside Russia and other countries in the former Soviet Union. It has however been added to the list of drugs under international control and is a scheduled substance in most countries, despite its multiple therapeutic applications and reported lack of significant abuse potential. Mesocarb had erroneously been referred to as a prodrug of amphetamine but this was based on older literature that relied on gas chromatography as an analytical method. Subsequently, with the advent of mass spectroscopy, it has been shown that presence of amphetamine in prior studies was an artifact of gas chromatography method. More recent studies using mass spectroscopy show that negligible levels of amphetamine are released from mesocarb metabolism. Chemistry Mesocarb is a mesoionic sydnone imine. It has the amphetamine-backbone present, except that the RN has a complicated imine side-chain present. Preparation Mesocarb from feprosidnine.

This is a list of the bird species recorded in Mexico. The avifauna of Mexico included a total of 1122 species as of December 2019, according to Bird Checklists of the World. One additional species has been added as a result of a split. Of these 1123 species, 101 are rare or accidental, 10 have been introduced by humans, 112 are endemic, and five more breed only in Mexico though their non-breeding range is larger. Four species are known to be extinct, 68 are globally vulnerable or endangered, and three of the latter might also be extinct. The total figure includes a number of species which are known only from sight records; they are listed but not especially noted. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. Unless otherwise noted, the species on this list are considered to occur regularly in Mexico as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The tags and notes of population status are from Bird Checklists of the World. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Mexico *(E) Endemic - a species endemic to Mexico *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Mexico as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Tinamous Two subspecies of great tinamou are found in southeastern Mexico. Order: TinamiformesFamily: Tinamidae The tinamous are one of the most ancient groups of bird. Although they look similar to other ground-dwelling birds like quail and grouse, they have no close relatives and are classified as a single family, Tinamidae, within their own order, the Tinamiformes. They are distantly related to the ratites (order Struthioniformes), that includes the rheas, emus, and kiwis. *Great tinamou, Tinamus major (Near-threatened) *Little tinamou, Crypturellus soui *Thicket tinamou, Crypturellus cinnamomeus *Slaty-breasted tinamou, Crypturellus boucardi Ducks, geese, and waterfowl The black-bellied whistling-duck is common and widespread in Mexico.

This is a list of the bird species recorded in Guatemala. The avifauna of Guatemala included a total of 768 species as of December 2019, according to Bird Checklists of the World. Of them, 114 are rare or accidental and five have been introduced by humans. One species (now extinct) was endemic and two non-endemic species have been extirpated. One species has been added as a result of a split. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. Unless otherwise noted, the species on this list are considered to occur regularly in Guatemala as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The tags and notes of population status are from Bird Checklists of the World. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Guatemala * (E) Endemic - a species endemic to Guatemala * (I) Introduced - a species introduced to Guatemala as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Tinamous Great tinamou Order: TinamiformesFamily: Tinamidae The tinamous are one of the most ancient groups of bird. Although they look similar to other ground-dwelling birds like quail and grouse, they have no close relatives and are classified as a single family, Tinamidae, within their own order, the Tinamiformes. They are distantly related to the ratites (order Struthioniformes), that includes the rheas, emus, and kiwis. *Great tinamou, Tinamus major (Near-threatened) *Little tinamou, Crypturellus soui *Thicket tinamou, Crypturellus cinnamomeus *Slaty-breasted tinamou, Crypturellus boucardi Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Black-bellied whistling-duck Blue- winged teal Ruddy duck Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. Skimmers are a small family of tropical tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish.

In July 2010, Preston announced that he was taking a break from the show, initially temporarily for several months to allow him to do some theatre work. However, it was later announced by Executive Producer, Steve November, that a return for the character of Doug wasn't definite. November stated that the door would remain open for Preston to come back to the show but that it was in the actor's hands if and when he decides to discuss a return. On 30 July 2014, it was announced that Preston has reprised the role and Doug is returning to the show as a regular character from September. During a December 2016 episode of the show, Doug was recast temporarily to provide an alternative physical appearance from the viewpoint of dementia patient Ashley Thomas (John Middleton). Creation In October 2006, it was announced that Laurel Thomas' (Charlotte Bellamy) father, Douglas Potts, would be cast in the show. It was then later revealed that actor Duncan Preston had been given the role. He started filming in February 2007 and Douglas Potts arrived in the village on 30 April 2007. Storylines=2007‚Äì2011 Doug is Laurel Thomas' (Charlotte Bellamy) father. He and Laurel's mother, Hilary (Paula Wilcox), come to the village to visit their daughter but after they leave, they are involved in a car accident. Doug suffers minor injuries but Hilary is comatose for several weeks. Laurel immediately goes to look after her father despite being heavily pregnant. Doug tells Hilary after she recovers that Laurel had moved in to take care of him and the house while she was ill. Doug returns with Hilary to meet their grandson, Daniel. Daniel dies of cot death in February 2008 and Hilary asks a devastated Doug to contain his grief for Laurel's sake, and he confides his true feelings to Pearl Ladderbanks (Meg Johnson). Hilary and Doug leave the village after Laurel bans Hilary from attending a memorial service for Daniel. They return a couple of weeks later. Laurel and Hilary resolve things and Hilary and Doug move in with Laurel and her husband, Ashley (John Middleton). Hilary discovers that Daniel was not Laurel and Ashley's son and when she confides her suspicions to Doug, he is reluctant to believe her but she is later proved to be right. Hilary falls out with Laurel over this and leaves but Doug stays to support Laurel, and gets a job at Eric Pollard's (Chris Chittell) furniture factory. In August 2008, Doug makes plans to reunite with Hilary, who had been on a long holiday to Cuba but she telephones him and asks for a divorce. Doug begins suffering a midlife crisis and buys himself a new sports car and sleeps with Bonnie Drinkwater (Sue Jenkins), a friend of Val Lambert's (Charlie Hardwick). Laurel and Ashley tricked Bonnie into leaving the village, but she had unwittingly caused more problems for Doug. In the village shop, Brenda Walker (Lesley Dunlop) notices him scratching his crotch, and assuming he is a pervert, calls the police. Doug is arrested but released without charge when it is revealed he had an STI, passed on to him by Bonnie. The news spreads around the village and Doug feels humiliated. Laurel reassures him that they would both laugh about the event sometime in the future. Doug disagrees but laughs with her. Doug begins building a relationship with Brenda but her daughter, Gennie (Sian Reese-Williams), realises that Brenda has feelings for Bob Hope (Tony Audenshaw). Brenda initially denies it but eventually ends her relationship with Doug, and begins dating Terry Woods (Billy Hartman) instead. Brenda and Doug continue to be friends, and in early 2009 they form Emmerdale Explorers, a playgroup for the local children. They receive some funding from Natasha Wylde (Amanda Donohoe), but they disagree repeatedly over her son, Will (Oscar Lloyd), attending the group. Eventually, Doug returns her money. Doug begins to resent Terry's involvement in the Explorers project, and his jealousy is further increased when he learns that Brenda intends to buy half of Bob's business. Doug convinces Terry and Bob that Brenda only wants to buy into the business to try to win Bob's heart. When Bob reneges on the deal, a furious Brenda pours a pint over Doug's head. Doug later apologises for interfering. Doug continues to work at the factory until Eric Pollard is forced to close it down. As a result of the credit crunch, Doug realises that people did not want new soft furnishings. Doug is disappointed to lose his job but finds a new one, running the Home Farm Fayre shop in the village with Leyla Harding (Roxy Shahidi). In March 2010, Doug becomes attracted to Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen) and asks her out but she turns him down. Doug is unhappy when Charlie Haynes (George Costigan), a friend of Diane's ex-husband, Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower), arrives in the village and begins a relationship with Diane. Fearing Charlie is a con-artist, Doug informs Diane of his suspicions, but Diane does not believe him. In July 2010, Diane discovers that Charlie has fled the village with her money and she forgives Doug for not believing him, but tells him she does not want a romantic relationship. Diane and Doug remain good friends and Doug offers Diane a loan when she faces financial problems as a result of Charlie's actions. Diane is reluctant to accept at first but eventually does so and Doug is pleased to have helped her. In January 2011, Doug tells Diane that he is seeing a woman, but does not reveal details. Doug eventually tells Diane that his new girlfriend is Hilary. He asks Diane to not tell Laurel and explains that he wants to give his marriage another go. On 11 February, Doug tells Laurel that he is going on a cruise with Hilary. He also tells Laurel that he intends to move back in with her at their old home. Laurel is reluctant at first but eventually accepts her father's decision. At the same time Diane realises that she does have feelings for Doug after all and invites him to a romantic meal at The Woolpack. He tells her of his plans and she is disappointed. On Valentine's Day, as Doug is about to leave, Laurel and Diane's sister, Val, arrange for Doug to meet Diane at the pub. Diane tells Doug that she regrets turning him down, and pleads with him to stay and give her another chance. But Doug is dismissive, telling Diane that had Charlie not been a conman then she would have gone to Spain with him and that he was not the sort of man she wanted and that he did not want to settle for second best. Doug then leaves and says farewell to Laurel, Ashley, Leyla and Ashley's father Sandy (Freddie Jones). As he is leaving the pub, Diane follows him outside and wishes him well. They embrace and bid each other farewell, parting on good terms. Doug then gets into his waiting taxi and is driven out of the village. 2014‚Äì2020 Doug returns to the village in September 2014 for Laurel's wedding to Marlon Dingle (Mark Charnock), and he moves in with the couple and their children for a while. He reveals to Laurel and Marlon that Laurel's mother, Hilary, has begun a relationship with an Italian man named Alberto. He rekindles his relationship with Diane, and his friendship with Leyla. He starts a vlog about gardening and builds up a fan base, however other residents find this silly, which humiliates Doug. In early 2015, Doug notices that Laurel is drinking more than normal, and soon realises that she has descended into alcoholism. He tries to stop Laurel from drinking, but his actions result in Laurel throwing Doug out, forcing him to move in with Diane. Doug's worries for Laurel's health grow when she is hospitalised after choking on her own vomit after drinking two bottles of wine. He mentions his concerns regarding Laurel's drinking to Diane numerous times. In July 2015, Doug is upset to hear that Hilary has died from heart failure, but is furious at her funeral when Alberto acts as if he knew Hilary for longer than he did, despite Doug's almost fifty-year marriage to Hilary. In December 2015, Diane is stabbed by Chas, who is sleepwalking due to her undiagnosed PTSD, and Doug is later heartbroken to learn that Diane's cancer has returned in her stomach, which would never have been found if it weren't for the stabbing. Doug supports Diane as she decides to sell her share of The Woolpack. In February 2016, Doug learns from Chas who told everybody in the pub, her ex-husband Gordon Livesy (Gary Mavers) sexually abused their son Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller) when he was a child. At the same time, Doug finds out that Laurel is remarrying Ashley, which concerns him due to Ashley's condition; he has dementia. Laurel later miscarries her and Ashley's baby, and Doug realises he does not agree with Ashley and Laurel's marriage, and tried to talk Laurel out of it, but this only results in a rift in their relationship. They later reconcile on Laurel's hen night party, where Doug also discovers Laurel is still pregnant, and Doug witnesses Laurel and Ashley married the following day. Their happiness is shortlived as Ashley suffers a \\"mini-stroke\\" which results in him losing months from his memory, leading him to believe he is still dating Harriet Finch (Katherine Dow Blyton). Doug gives Laurel a shoulder to cry on, but Ashley suddenly and miraculously remembers his wedding. In March 2016, Diane is off to Spain to look after a sick family member. Beforehand, she and Doug had invested in Eric's B&B; becoming co- owners alongside Eric. At the same time, Diane has sold her share of the pub to returning Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins), a relative of Chas', who promises to get the money for the share. However, Doug doesn't trust her, a view which Chas shares, and they warn Charity not to screw them over. For the time being, Doug assisted Chas and Charity behind the bar whenever he could before going to Spain to help Diane look after an ill Annie Sugden (Sheila Mercier). After returning from Spain, Diane rent and move into Brook Cottage as The Woolpack is full due to Charity, her son Noah Dingle (Jack Downham) and Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele) moving in. Reception On Doug's most memorable moment; a writer from Holy Soap said that \\"despite bringing some real gravitas to the soap, he's best remembered for when he caught an unfortunate STD [...] and was arrested for indecent behaviour in a public place because he was scratching himself.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Character profile at Holy Soap Category:Emmerdale characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2007 Category:Male characters in television Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Fictional factory workers Category:Fictional shopkeepers Category:Fictional cannabis users ","title":"Douglas Potts"},{"id":"10907878","text":"The turquoise-browed motmot is the national bird of El Salvador. This is a list of the bird species recorded in El Salvador. The avifauna of El Salvador included a total of 588 species as of December 2019, according to Bird Checklists of the World. Of them, 133 are rare or accidental and six have been introduced by humans. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. Unless otherwise noted, the species on this list are considered to occur regularly in El Salvador as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The tags and notes of population status are from Bird Checklists of the World. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in El Salvador * (I) Introduced - a species introduced to El Salvador as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Tinamous Order: TinamiformesFamily: Tinamidae The tinamous are one of the most ancient groups of birds. Although they look similar to other ground- dwelling birds like quail and grouse, they have no close relatives and are classified as a single family, Tinamidae, within their own order, the Tinamiformes. They are distantly related to the ratites (order Struthioniformes), that includes the rheas, emu, and kiwi. *Thicket tinamou, Crypturellus cinnamomeus Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

This is a list of the bird species recorded in Nicaragua. The avifauna of Nicaragua included a total of 776 species as of December 2019, according to Bird Checklists of the World. Of the species, 134 are rare or accidental and five have been introduced by humans. None are endemic. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. Unless otherwise noted, the species on this list are considered to occur regularly in Nicaragua as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The tags and notes of population status are from Bird Checklists of the World. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Nicaragua *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Nicaragua as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Tinamous Great tinamou Order: TinamiformesFamily: Tinamidae The tinamous are one of the most ancient groups of bird.

Born in Scarborough, Yorkshire, England, Wilson was a right-handed batsman, who scored 8,053 runs at 27.20, with a best of 208 against Sussex, one of four tons he made against the county. He scored fourteen centuries in all, thirty five fifties, and he took 53 catches in the field. He took two first-class wickets at 139.00 each. He also played for the Yorkshire Second XI from 1902 to 1911, and H. Hayley's XI in 1906. Wilson was a prolific scoring batsman for Yorkshire from 1906 to 1914, but scored slowly at times and was slow in the field. He possessed a strong defence, and could hit hard without any pretense to style. After a modest start, he scored 109 at Headingley against Derbyshire, in his only innings of the 1908 season, and his extended trail in 1909 saw him finish fourth in Yorkshire's batting averages with a four-figure aggregate. He maintained his place as Yorkshire's opening bat, but left the county when hostilities ceased in 1919. He played his early cricket at Scarborough, but before going to coach to Harrow in 1921, he was with Pudsey Britannia C.C. He was at Harrow for eleven years and later went to St. Peter's School, Yorkshire. He coached in New Zealand, and was coach at Harrogate C.C. when he was over 70 years old. Wilson died in September 1957 in Harrogate, Yorkshire. His son, Ben Wilson, played one match for Warwickshire.

An additional 10 species have been added from eBird through June 2020. The 397 species is a remarkable number considering that the island is a mere 53.3 square kilometres. (Additional species known only from the fossil record or speculatively from the time of early exploration are not included.) Ten species were introduced by humans; the mallard also occurs naturally as a non-breeding migrant. Of the 396, 104 are uncommon, 61 are rare, and 15 are very rare, all as defined below. Audubon's shearwater formerly bred in Bermuda but is now only a vagrant; Eskimo curlew is considered extinct. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. Unless otherwise noted, all species listed below are considered to occur regularly in Bermuda as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. These tags are used to annotate some species: * (U) Uncommon - a species \\"recorded in most years but in small numbers\\" per the BAS * (R) Rare - a species \\"not recorded annually\\" per the BAS * (VR) Very rare - a species with fewer than 15 records per the BAS * (I) Introduced - a species present in Bermuda as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae The blue-winged teal is the most common of the migrant ducks. The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating. *Black-bellied whistling-duck, Dendrocygna autumnalis (VR) *West Indian whistling-duck, Dendrocygna arborea (VR) *Fulvous whistling-duck, Dendrocygna bicolor (VR) *Snow goose, Anser caerulescens (U) *Ross's goose, Anser rossii (VR) *Greater white-fronted goose, Anser albifrons (VR) *Brant, Branta bernicla (VR) *Canada goose, Branta canadensis (U) *Mute swan, Cygnus olor (VR) *Tundra swan, Cygnus columbianus (VR) *Wood duck, Aix sponsa (U) *Garganey, Spatula querquedula (VR) *Blue- winged teal, Spatula discors *Northern shoveler, Spatula clypeata (U) *Gadwall, Mareca strepera (U) *Eurasian wigeon, Mareca penelope (U) *American wigeon, Mareca americana (U) *Mallard, Anas platyrhynchos (I) *American black duck, Anas rubripes (U) *Northern pintail, Anas acuta (U) *Green-winged teal, Anas crecca *Canvasback, Aythya valisineria (VR) *Redhead, Aythya americana (VR) *Ring-necked duck, Aythya collaris *Ferruginous duck, Aythya nyroca (VR) (Not on the AOS Check-list) *Tufted duck, Aythya fuligula (VR) *Greater scaup, Aythya marila (R) *Lesser scaup, Aythya affinis (U) *Common eider, Somateria mollissima (VR) *Surf scoter, Melanitta perspicillata (VR) *White-winged scoter, Melanitta deglandi (VR) *Black scoter, Melanitta americana (VR) *Long- tailed duck, Clangula hyemalis (R) *Bufflehead, Bucephala albeola (U) *Common goldeneye, Bucephala clangula (R) *Hooded merganser, Lophodytes cucullatus *Common merganser, Mergus merganser (U) *Red-breasted merganser, Mergus serrator (U) *Ruddy duck, Oxyura jamaicensis (U) Flamingos Order: PhoenicopteriformesFamily: Phoenicopteridae Flamingos are gregarious wading birds, usually tall, found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae. Their oddly shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume and, uniquely, are used upside-down. *American flamingo, Phoenicopterus ruber (VR) Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. *Pied-billed grebe, Podilymbus podiceps *Horned grebe, Podiceps auritus (R) *Red-necked grebe, Podiceps grisegena (VR) *Eared grebe, Podiceps nigricollis (VR) Pigeons and doves Order: ColumbiformesFamily: Columbidae The mourning dove first bred in Bermuda in the 1950s and is now common.

These birds are of variable size with slender bodies, long tails, and strong legs. The Old World cuckoos are brood parasites. *Yellow-billed cuckoo, Coccyzus americanus *Black-billed cuckoo, Coccyzus erythropthalmus (U) Nightjars and allies Order: CaprimulgiformesFamily: Caprimulgidae Nightjars are medium-sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs, and very short bills. Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is camouflaged to resemble bark or leaves. *Lesser nighthawk, Chordeiles acutipennis (VR) *Common nighthawk, Chordeiles minor (U) *Antillean nighthawk, Chordeiles gundlachii (VR) *Eastern whip-poor-will, Antrostomus vociferus (VR) Swifts Order: ApodiformesFamily: Apodidae Swifts are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang. *Black swift, Cypseloides niger (VR) *Chimney swift, Chaetura pelagica (U) *Common swift, Apus apus (VR) *Alpine swift, Apus melba (VR) Hummingbirds Order: ApodiformesFamily: Trochilidae Hummingbirds are small birds capable of hovering in mid-air due to the rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backwards. *Ruby-throated hummingbird, Archilochus colubris (R) Rails, gallinules, and coots Order: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae The common gallinule breeds on most ponds. Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots, and gallinules. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers. *Clapper rail, Rallus crepitans (VR) *Virginia rail, Rallus limicola (U) *Corn crake, Crex crex (VR) *Sora, Porzana carolina (U) *Common gallinule, Gallinula galeata *American coot, Fulica americana *Purple swamphen, Porphyrio porphyrio (VR) *African swamphen, Porphyrio madagascariensis (VR) (Not on the AOS Check-list) *Gray- headed swamphen, Porphyrio poliocephalus (VR) (Not on the AOS Check-list) *Purple gallinule, Porphyrio martinicus (U) *Yellow rail, Coturnicops noveboracensis (VR) *Black rail, Laterallus jamaicensis (VR) Cranes Order: GruiformesFamily: Gruidae Cranes are large, long-legged, and long-necked birds. Unlike the similar-looking but unrelated herons, cranes fly with necks outstretched, not pulled back. Most have elaborate and noisy courting displays or \\"dances\\". *Sandhill crane, Antigone canadensis (VR) Stilts and avocets Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Recurvirostridae Recurvirostridae is a family of large wading birds which includes the avocets and stilts. The avocets have long legs and long up-curved bills. The stilts have extremely long legs and long, thin, straight bills. *Black-necked stilt, Himantopus mexicanus (R) *American avocet, Recurvirostra americana (R) Plovers and lapwings Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Charadriidae Threatened in much of its range, the piping plover has become uncommon in Bermuda. The family Charadriidae includes the plovers, dotterels, and lapwings. They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short thick necks, and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water. *Northern lapwing, Vanellus vanellus (VR) *Black-bellied plover, Pluvialis squatarola *American golden-plover, Pluvialis dominica *Pacific golden-plover, Pluvialis fulva (VR) *Eurasian dotterel, Charadrius morinellus (VR) *Killdeer, Charadrius vociferus *Semipalmated plover, Charadrius semipalmatus *Piping plover, Charadrius melodus (U) *Wilson's plover, Charadrius wilsonia (VR) Sandpipers and allies Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Scolopacidae Semipalmated sandpiper - one of the most common migrant shorebirds. Scolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the sandpipers, curlews, godwits, shanks, tattlers, woodcocks, snipes, dowitchers, and phalaropes. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Variation in length of legs and bills enables multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food. *Upland sandpiper, Bartramia longicauda (U) *Whimbrel, Numenius phaeopus (U) *Eskimo curlew, Numenius borealis (Extinct) *Eurasian curlew, Numenius arquata (VR) *Bar-tailed godwit, Limosa lapponica (VR) *Hudsonian godwit, Limosa haemastica (VR) *Ruddy turnstone, Arenaria interpres *Red knot, Calidris canutus (U) *Ruff, Calidris pugnax (R) *Sharp-tailed sandpiper, Calidris acuminata (VR) *Stilt sandpiper, Calidris himantopus *Curlew sandpiper, Calidris ferruginea (VR) *Red-necked stint, Calidris ruficollis (VR) *Sanderling, Calidris alba *Dunlin, Calidris alpina (U) *Purple sandpiper, Calidris maritima (VR) *Baird's sandpiper, Calidris bairdii (R) *Little stint, Calidris minuta (VR) *Least sandpiper, Calidris minutilla *White-rumped sandpiper, Calidris fuscicollis *Buff- breasted sandpiper, Calidris subruficollis (U) *Pectoral sandpiper, Calidris melanotos *Semipalmated sandpiper, Calidris pusilla *Western sandpiper, Calidris mauri (U) *Short-billed dowitcher, Limnodromus griseus *Long-billed dowitcher, Limnodromus scolopaceus (R) *American woodcock, Scolopax minor (VR) *Common snipe Gallinago gallinago (VR) *Wilson's snipe, Gallinago delicata *Spotted sandpiper, Actitis macularia (U) *Solitary sandpiper, Tringa solitaria *Lesser yellowlegs, Tringa flavipes *Willet, Tringa semipalmata (U) *Common greenshank, Tringa nebularia (VR) *Greater yellowlegs, Tringa melanoleuca *Wood sandpiper, Tringa glareola (VR) *Wilson's phalarope, Phalaropus tricolor (R) *Red-necked phalarope, Phalaropus lobatus (VR) *Red phalarope, Phalaropus fulicarius (VR) Skuas and jaegers Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Stercorariidae The family Stercorariidae are, in general, medium to large birds, typically with grey or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. They nest on the ground in temperate and arctic regions and are long-distance migrants. *Great skua, Stercorarius skua (R) *South polar skua, Stercorarius maccormicki (R) *Brown skua, Stercorarius antarcticus (VR) (not on the AOS Check-list) *Pomarine jaeger, Stercorarius pomarinus (U) *Parasitic jaeger, Stercorarius parasiticus (U) *Long-tailed jaeger, Stercorarius longicaudus (U) Auks, murres, and puffins Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Alcidae Alcids are superficially similar to penguins due to their black-and-white colours, their upright posture, and some of their habits, however they are not related to the penguins and differ in being able to fly. Auks live on the open sea, only deliberately coming ashore to nest. *Dovekie, Alle alle (VR) *Razorbill, Alca torda (VR) *Atlantic puffin, Fratercula arctica (VR) Gulls, terns, and skimmers Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Laridae Ring-billed gulls - common along the coast in winter. Laridae is a family of medium to large seabirds and includes gulls, terns, and skimmers. Gulls are typically grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have webbed feet. Gulls have stout bills while terns have long dagger-like bils. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. Skimmers are a small family of tropical tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish. *Black-legged kittiwake, Rissa tridactyla (R) *Sabine's gull, Xema sabini (VR) *Bonaparte's gull, Chroicocephalus philadelphia (U) *Black-headed gull, Chroicocephalus ridibundus (R) *Little gull, Hydrocoloeus minutus (VR) *Laughing gull, Leucophaeus atricilla (U) *Franklin's gull, Leucophaeus pipixcan (VR) *Black-tailed gull, Larus crassirostris (VR) *Ring-billed gull, Larus delawarensis *California gull, Larus californicus (VR) *Herring gull, Larus argentatus *Iceland gull, Larus glaucoides (R) *Lesser black-backed gull, Larus fuscus *Glaucous gull, Larus hyperboreus (R) *Great black-backed gull, Larus marinus (U) *Brown noddy, Anous stolidus (VR) *White tern, Gygis alba (VR) *Sooty tern, Onychoprion fuscatus (R) *Bridled tern, Onychoprion anaethetus (R) *Least tern, Sternula antillarum (U) *Large-billed tern, Phaetusa simplex (VR) *Gull-billed tern, Gelochelidon nilotica (R) *Caspian tern, Hydroprogne caspia (VR) *Black tern, Chlidonias niger (R) *White-winged tern, Chlidonias leucopterus (C) *Roseate tern, Sterna dougallii (R) *Common tern, Sterna hirundo *Arctic tern, Sterna paradisaea (U) *Forster's tern, Sterna forsteri (U) *Royal tern, Thalasseus maximus (U) *Sandwich tern, Thalasseus sandvicensis (U) *Black skimmer, Rynchops niger (VR) Tropicbirds Order: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae The white-tailed tropicbird or \\"longtail\\" arrives in spring to breed. Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings. *White-tailed tropicbird, Phaethon lepturus *Red-billed tropicbird, Phaethon aethereus (VR) Loons Order: GaviiformesFamily: Gaviidae Loons, known as divers in Europe, are a group of aquatic birds found in many parts of North America and northern Europe. They are the size of a large duck or small goose, which they somewhat resemble when swimming, but to which they are completely unrelated. *Pacific loon, Gavia pacifica (VR) *Common loon, Gavia immer (VR) Albatrosses Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Diomedeidae The albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds, and the great albatrosses of the genus Diomedea have the largest wingspans of any extant birds. *Black-browed albatross, Thalassarche melanophris (VR) Southern storm-petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The storm-petrels are the smallest seabirds, relatives of the petrels, feeding on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. Until 2018, this family's species were included with the other storm-petrels in family Hydrobatidae. *Wilson's storm- petrel, Oceanites oceanicus Northern storm-petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae Though the members of this family are similar in many respects to the southern storm-petrels, including their general appearance and habits, there are enough genetic differences to warrant their placement in a separate family. *Leach's storm-petrel, Hydrobates leucorhous *Band-rumped storm-petrel, Hydrobates castro (VR) Petrels and shearwaters Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae Large numbers of great shearwaters pass offshore between May and July. The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Northern fulmar, Fulmarus glacialis (VR) *Trindade petrel, Pterodroma arminjoniana (VR) *Bermuda petrel, Pterodroma cahow *Black-capped petrel, Pterodroma hasitata (VR) *Cory's shearwater, Calonectris diomedea *Great shearwater, Ardenna gravis *Sooty shearwater, Ardenna griseus *Manx shearwater, Puffinus puffinus *Audubon's shearwater, Puffinus lherminieri (Extirpated as a breeder) (VR) Frigatebirds Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black-and-white, or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. *Magnificent frigatebird, Fregata magnificens (R) Boobies and gannets Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. *Masked booby, Sula dactylatra (R) *Brown booby, Sula leucogaster (R) *Northern gannet, Morus bassanus (R) Cormorants and shags Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags.

They are strong fliers and despite their size and weight, very capable soarers. *White ibis, Eudocimus albus (VR) *Glossy ibis, Plegadis falcinellus (U) New World vultures Order: CathartiformesFamily: Cathartidae The New World vultures are not closely related to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. However, unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have a good sense of smell with which they locate carrion. *Turkey vulture, Cathartes aura (VR) Osprey Order: AccipitriformesFamily: Pandionidae Pandionidae is a monotypic family of fish-eating birds of prey. Its single species possesses a very large and powerful hooked beak, strong legs, strong talons, and keen eyesight. *Osprey, Pandion haliaetus (U) Hawks, eagles, and kites Order: AccipitriformesFamily: Accipitridae Accipitridae is a family of birds of prey, which includes hawks, eagles, kites, harriers, and Old World vultures.

It led to the passing of the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004 and the formation of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority. It produced a code of practice concerned with illegal and unsafe working. It states that \\"It is well known that some labour providers act illegally, by for example employing illegal workers, evading tax and not paying the minimum wage.\\" Employment agencies (called \\"labour providers\\") were audited to check on actual working conditions. Although signing up to the code was voluntary the Association of Labour Providers made it a requirement of membership and the Fresh Produce Consortium and the National Farmers Union recommended it.

Religion Aryankavu Shastha Temple Aryankavu temple (1890) Aryankavu's Ayyappan temple, in Kollam District, is one among the five most important temples dedicated to Lord Ayyappa in Kerala. The shrine is also known as Aryankavu Shastha Temple. Lord Ayyappa is depicted here as a teenager (young boy). Ayyappa is known as Tiru Aryan and therefore the place got the name Aryankavu. Surrounded by forests, the temple is located on the Trivandrum ‚Äì Tenkasi National Highway. Just like in Sabarimala, women from the age 10 to 50 are not allowed inside the Aryankavu Ayyappa Temple. The rituals and pujas followed at Aryankavu Sastha Temple is that of Tamil tradition. The sanctum sanctorum of the temple has idols of Devi, Shiva and Sastha.

The avifauna of the Turks and Caicos Islands included a total of 229 species according to Bird Checklists of the World as of May 2020. Of them species, five have been introduced by humans and 121 are rare or accidental. One species on the list has been extirpated. Four species are globally threatened. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories of occurrence. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in the Turks and Caicos Islands *(I) Introduced - a species introduced directly to the Turks and Caicos Islands or elsewhere in the New world *(Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in the Turks and Caicos Islands although populations exist elsewhere Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

This is a list of the bird species recorded in the Cayman Islands. The avifauna of the Cayman Islands included a total of 260 species, according to Bird Checklists of the World as of January 2020. Of them, 156 are rare or accidental and eight are introduced. One species (Grand Cayman thrush) was endemic to the islands but is now extinct, and one species (Jamaican oriole) has been extirpated.Bradley, Patricia E. & Yves-Jacques Rey-Millet (2013) A Photographic Guide to the Birds of the Cayman Islands, Christopher Helm, London. One additional introduced species which appears to be established has been added through eBird. BirdLife International has reclassified Grand Cayman's endemic Cuban bullfinch subspecies as a full species, the Grand Cayman bullfinch, but the AOS has not yet accepted this. In addition, the islands hold most of the world population of vitelline warbler which otherwise occurs only on the Swan Islands of Honduras. There are 17 endemic subspecies belonging to 14 different species. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories of occurrence. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in the Cayman Islands *(E) Endemic - a species endemic to the Cayman Islands *(I) Introduced - a species introduced by humans either directly to the Cayman Islands or elsewhere in the New World Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating. *Black-bellied whistling-duck, Dendrocygna autumnalis (A) *West Indian whistling-duck, Dendrocygna arborea *Fulvous whistling-duck, Dendrocygna bicolor (A) *Snow goose, Anser caerulescens (A) *Canada goose, Branta canadensis (A) *Wood duck, Aix sponsa (A) *Blue-winged teal, Spatula discors *Northern shoveler, Spatula clypeata (A) *Gadwall, Mareca strepera (A) *American wigeon, Mareca americana (A) *Mallard, Anas platyrhynchos (A) *White-cheeked pintail, Anas bahamensis (A) *Northern pintail, Anas acuta (A) *Green-winged teal, Anas crecca (A) *Redhead, Aythya americana (A) *Ring- necked duck, Aythya collaris (A) *Lesser scaup, Aythya affinis *Hooded merganser, Lophodytes cucullatus (A) *Common merganser, Mergus merganser (A) *Red-breasted merganser, Mergus serrator (A) *Masked duck, Nomonyx dominicus (A) *Ruddy duck, Oxyura jamaicensis (A) Flamingos Order: PhoenicopteriformesFamily: Phoenicopteridae Flamingos are gregarious wading birds, usually tall, found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae.

They have long wings, short legs, and very short bills. Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is camouflaged to resemble bark or leaves. *Common nighthawk, Chordeiles minor (A) *Antillean nighthawk, Chordeiles gundlachii *Chuck-will's-widow, Antrostomus carolinensis (A) Potoos Order: NyctibiiformesFamily: Nyctibiidae The potoos (sometimes called poor-me-ones) are large near passerine birds related to the nightjars and frogmouths. They are nocturnal insectivores which lack the bristles around the mouth found in the true nightjars. *Northern potoo, Nyctibius jamaicensis (A) Swifts Order: ApodiformesFamily: Apodidae Swifts are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang. *Black swift, Cypseloides niger (A) *Chimney swift, Chaetura pelagica (A) *Antillean palm-swift, Tachornis phoenicobia (A) Hummingbirds Order: ApodiformesFamily: Trochilidae Hummingbirds are small birds capable of hovering in mid-air due to the rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backwards. *Ruby-throated hummingbird, Archilochus colubris (A) Rails, gallinules, and coots Order: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots, and gallinules. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers. *Sora, Porzana carolina *Common gallinule, Gallinula galeata *American coot, Fulica americana *Purple gallinule, Porphyrio martinica Limpkin Order: GruiformesFamily: Aramidae The limpkin is an odd bird that looks like a large rail, but is skeletally closer to the cranes.

They are typically grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. Skimmers are a small family of tropical tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish. *Bonaparte's gull, Chroicocephalus philadelphia (A) *Laughing gull, Leucophaeus atricilla *Franklin's gull, Leucophaeus pipixcan (A) *Ring-billed gull, Larus delawarensis (A) *Herring gull, Larus argentatus (A) *Brown noddy, Anous stolidus (A) *Sooty tern, Onychoprion fuscata (A) *Bridled tern, Onychoprion anaethetus (A) *Least tern, Sternula antillarum *Gull-billed tern, Gelochelidon nilotica (A) *Caspian tern, Hydroprogne caspia (A) *Black tern, Chlidonias niger (A) *Common tern, Sterna hirundo (A) *Forster's tern, Sterna forsteri (A) *Royal tern, Thalasseus maxima *Sandwich tern, Thalasseus sandvicensis (A) *Black skimmer, Rynchops niger (A) Tropicbirds Order: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans with exceptionally long central tail feathers.

They are large, black-and-white, or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to- body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. *Magnificent frigatebird, Fregata magnificens Boobies and gannets Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. *Masked booby, Sula dactylatra (A) *Brown booby, Sula leucogaster *Red-footed booby, Sula sula Anhingas Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Anhingas are often called \\"snake-birds\\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape, and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. *Anhinga, Anhinga anhinga (A) Cormorants and shags Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags.

Plumage is typically dark with a metallic sheen. *European starling, Sturnus vulgaris (I) (A) Waxwings Order: PasseriformesFamily: Bombycillidae The waxwings are a group of birds with soft silky plumage and unique red tips to some of the wing feathers. In the Bohemian and cedar waxwings, these tips look like sealing wax and give the group its name. These are arboreal birds of northern forests. They live on insects in summer and berries in winter. *Cedar waxwing, Bombycilla cedrorum (A) Waxbills and allies Order: PasseriformesFamily: Estrildidae The estrildid finches are small passerine birds native to the Old World tropics. They are gregarious and often colonial seed eaters with short thick but pointed bills. They are all similar in structure and habits, but have wide variation in plumage colours and patterns. *Scaly-breasted munia, Lonchura punctulata (I) (A) *Tricolored munia, Lonchura malacca (I) (A) Old World sparrows Order: PasseriformesFamily: Emberizidae Old World sparrows are small passerine birds. In general, sparrows tend to be small plump brownish or greyish birds with short tails and short powerful beaks. Sparrows are seed eaters, but they also consume small insects. *House sparrow, Passer domesticus (I) New World sparrows Order: PasseriformesFamily: Passerellidae Until 2017, these species were considered part of the family Emberizidae. Most of the species are known as sparrows, but these birds are not closely related to the Old World sparrows which are in the family Passeridae. Many of these have distinctive head patterns. *Grasshopper sparrow, Ammodramus savannarum (A) *Chipping sparrow, Spizella passerina (A) *Clay-colored sparrow, Spizella pallida (A) *Dark-eyed junco, Junco hyemalis (A) *Vesper sparrow, Pooecetes gramineus (A) *Savannah sparrow, Passerculus sandwichensis (A) Spindalises Order: PasseriformesFamily: Spindalidae The members of this small family are native to the Greater Antilles. They were formerly classified as tanagers (family Thraupidae) but were placed in their own family in 2017. *Western spindalis, Spindalis zena Yellow-breasted chat Order: PasseriformesFamily: Icteriidae This species was historically placed in the New World warblers (Parulidae) but nonetheless most authorities were unsure if it belonged there. It was placed in its own family in 2017. *Yellow-breasted chat, Icteria virens (A) Troupials and allies Greater Antillean grackle Order: PasseriformesFamily: Icteridae The icterids are a group of small to medium- sized, often colourful, passerine birds restricted to the New World and include the grackles, New World blackbirds, and New World orioles.

Three principal techniques were considered: # Optical Ground Wire (OPGW), which replaced the earth wire that runs across the top of the pylons with a new cable that contained a tubular core in which up to 24 optical fibres could be placed. However this option was expensive to implement as it would mean writing off the capital value of the old earth cable many years before it was due to be replaced as part of the normal operation and maintenance cycle. Installation was also very expensive and methods to reduce costs in this area needed to be developed. # Wrapped Fibre (WF), which involved a new technique of taking a variant of underground cable and wrapping it in a spiral fashion around the earth wire. A specially adapted machine was designed for the job to that made installation cost-effective. The challenge for the company however was how to protect the fibres in the cable from damage caused by starlings pecking at the cable sheath, which split open the cable exposing the fibres to water which would affect the optical transmission properties. # All Dielectric Self Supporting (ADSS) Cable, which consisted of non-metallic suspension components and was already used on low voltage power distribution networks in various parts of the world. However, it was found that at 275 kV and 400 kV, the voltages used on the National Grid infrastructure, the electromagnetic fields from the power cables were sufficient to induce microsparks inside the cable that degraded the dielectric materials causing the cable to fail and collapse. Following various trials, cost-effective installation methods were developed for OPGW and the starling problem was resolved, but no solution was found at that time for the ADSS deterioration problem. These changes made it possible to install a nationwide network within the budget constraints set for the project and approval was given to start. The other technical issues to resolve was what type of optical transmission equipment to use. A few years before a new standard for optical transmission systems called Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) had been developed and ratified as a global standard as a replacement for existing Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH) equipment. As the Telecom Electric Project started manufacturers had started releasing SDH products onto the market and Russ Taylor, the SDH specialist in the TE team, after researching the UK SDH suppliers, recommended the project implement an all SDH network. This was a bold step at the time, but his research showed that with the right combination of suppliers, it was not only feasible, but would lead to a more efficient network with lower operating costs than the previous PDH products widely used and much more effective than starting with PDH and migrating to SDH over time. The team reviewed the research material and recommended to the newly appointed CEO David Dey, that Nortel Networks and GPT be selected as suppliers. Nortel Networks were selected to provide the core backbone SDH systems and GPT the edge access systems for SDH-PDH interfacing with the customer. The decision led what was to become Energis Communications Limited to be the first UK operator install an all-SDH network capable of providing a fully synchronous connection to any customer. This unique selling point was a key differentiator in the marketing strategy for the first five years of operation of the business.

Lothbury is a short street in the City of London. It runs east-west with traffic flow in both directions, from Gresham Street's junction with Moorgate to the west, and Bartholomew Lane's junction with Throgmorton Street to the east. History The area was populated with coppersmiths in the Middle Ages before later becoming home to a number of merchants and bankers. According to Stow, the street was \\"possessed for the most part by founders that cast candlesticks, chafing dishes, spice mortars, and such-like copper or laton works, and do afterwards turn them with the foot and not with the wheel, to make them smooth and bright with turning and scratching (as some do term it), making a loathsome noise to the by-passers that have not been used to the like, and therefore by them disdainfully called Lothberie\\". Lothbury was the location of the Whalebone, a meeting place for the radical Leveller movement in the mid seventeenth-century. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the Great Northern & City Railway planned an underground railway station at Lothbury, but this was abandoned because of financial constraints. Today the nearest London Underground station is Bank, a short way to the south. The nearest mainline railway station is Liverpool Street, with National Rail services towards East Anglia. Buildings The Bank of England moved to its present site on Threadneedle Street in 1734. Lothbury borders the Bank on the building's northern side, and some of Sir John Soane's work dating from 1788 can still be seen there today. Opposite the Bank is the Christopher Wren church St Margaret Lothbury. 41 Lothbury is a particularly noteworthy office building, designed by architects Mewes and Davis, with interior columns, marble walls and floor. It was for many years the head office of National Westminster Bank. The Grade II* listed building was completed in 1932 and replaced a nineteenth-century building designed by Charles Robert Cockerell. People associated with Lothbury Having retired as Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King was made a life peer and now has the title Baron King of Lothbury.

Its re-creation was part of the Singapore Zheng He's 600th Anniversary Celebrations in 2005 Long Ya Men (; Malay: Batu Berlayar) or Dragon's Teeth Gate, is the name Chinese explorer Wang Dayuan recorded for Batu Belayar, a craggy granite outcrop that formerly stood at the gateway to Keppel Harbour in Singapore. In his description, ‚ÄúThe strait runs between the two hills of the Danmaxi (Temasek) natives which looked like dragon‚Äôs teeth.‚Äù From there, the name Long Ya Men or Dragon Teeth‚Äôs Gate was born. The rocky outcrop served as navigational aids to ancient mariners sailing through the swift waters of the narrow channel between them, but was subsequently destroyed by the British in 1848 to widen the channel for larger vessels to sail through. In 2005, a symbolic replica was erected by the Singapore government near its original site to mark the role it played in Singapore's maritime history. Long Ya Men was documented in Wang Dayuan's travelogue Daoyi Zhil√ºe as one of the two settlements of Temasek. It was marked in the Mao Kun navigational map historical maritime annal Wubei Zhi said to date from the voyages of Ming dynasty's Admiral Zheng he. Long Ya Men in the map was also used to refer to the strait between Sentosa island and Labrador Point, and named after a pinnacle of stone that was called Batu Berlayar, which means \\"Sail Rock\\" in Malay. Another suggestion is that it refers to the Singapore Main Strait south of Pulau Satumu. The Long Ya Men's unique features was said to have assisted Zheng He in navigating the waters around Singapore during his seven maritime voyages to the west between 1405 and 1433 AD. History Historically the rocky outcrop was known locally by the Malays in earlier times as \\"Batu Berlayar\\" (\\"Sailing Rock\\") near the present site of Labrador Park, off Pasir Panjang Road. Another rock outcrop used to stand on the opposite shore of Tanjong Rimau on Sentosa Island. These two rock outcrops once formed a gateway at the western entrance to Keppel Harbour. British sailors named the more prominent Batu Berlayar, \\"Lot's Wife\\" in reference to the biblical story of the wife of Abraham's nephew. She was transformed into a pillar of salt when she disobeyed divine orders not to look back at the destruction of Sodom while fleeing from the city.EndNote: Information obtained from on-site information board by NParks. It is argued that the two rocky outcrops are the two hills of Temasek named in Yuan sources as Long Ya Men (Dragon's Teeth Gate) since they resembled two dragon's teeth between which a passage of water runs. Another name Ling Ya Men () is recorded in the Song dynasty work Zhu Fan Zhi, however it is usually considered to be a different place. The famous historical maritime annals, Wubei Zhi depicting Long Ya Men, shown just right of centre on the map, It was recorded that during the Yuan dynasty, envoys were sent to Long Ya Men in 1320 to obtain tame elephants. The people of Long Ya Men then returned in 1325 with a tribute and trade mission to China. In around 1330, the traveller Wang Dayuan was said to have sailed through this passageway. In his travelogue Daoyi Zhil√ºe, he recorded that Long Ya Men was the two hills of Temasek between which a strait runs, and it was so called because the two hills looked like \\"Dragon's teeth\\".

He mentioned that in olden times a chief there found a jewelled head-dress while digging in the ground, and that \\"the beginning of the year is calculated from the [first] rising of the moon, when the chief put on this head-gear and wore his [ceremonial] dress\\". He also said the natives would \\"gather their hair into a chignon, and wear short cotton bajus girded about with black cotton sarongs\\". The description of the people may be the first known record of the Orang Laut who inhabited the region. A different settlement called Ban Zu (Áè≠Âçí), described as being located on a hill behind Long Ya Men, is thought to be a transcription of the Malay Pancur and may be today's Fort Canning Hill. The Keppel passageway was used by Asian and early European sailors and traders for hundreds of years to sail past Singapore. Between 1405 and 1433, Zheng He made seven voyages to more than 30 countries, travelling in fleets of up to 300 ships to the South Pacific, Indian Ocean, Persian Gulf and Africa. The admiral travelled on the order of the Chinese Emperor to establish trade relations with countries west of China. He is believed to have sailed through the waters off Labrador Park, though whether he landed in Singapore is uncertain. In the 17th century, the passageway was abandoned in favour of the wider and more open Main Straits, that lies south of Pulau Satamu, where Raffles Lighthouse stands today. Sir Stamford Raffles of the British East India Company did not know of the \\"Lot's Wife\\", or the deep water harbour it led to when he landed in Singapore in January 1819. William Farquhar, the first British Resident and Commandant of Singapore, wrote to Raffles on 2 September 1819 that he had founded a new harbour west of the settlement. The two rock outcrops were subsequently blown up by the Straits Settlements Surveyor, John Thomson, in August 1848 to widen the entrance to the new harbour. Commemoration In July 2005, a 6m high stone replica of Long Ya Men was put up near its original site by a joint collaboration involving the Singapore Tourism Board, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore and the National Parks Board. This was part of a three-month-long celebration of the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's maiden voyage, which began in Nanjing, China. A storyboard telling Long Ya Men's significance to Singapore and Zheng He's story, was also put up next to the replica. The authorities had initially planned for the replica to replace the red Berlayer Beacon, but the Singapore Heritage Society was against the decision, saying the beacon was itself a heritage site and should not be destroyed because the beacon has been at Labrador Park since the end of World War II. The replica was finally built just meters away from the beacon. The authorities hope the symbolic replica can serve to preserve the memory of Long Ya Men, which is an important part of Singapore's maritime history, for future generations and visitors familiar with the historical voyages of Zheng He.

This is a list of the bird species recorded in Haiti. The avifauna of Haiti included a total of 270 species, according to Bird Checklists of the World (Avibase) as of May 2020. One additional species has been added through eBird. Of the 271 species, 10 have been introduced by humans and 61 are rare or accidental. According to Avibase, two are endemic to Haiti and an additional 26 species are endemic to the island of Hispaniola which Haiti shares with the Dominican Republic. Differing treatments are noted in the list. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories of occurrence. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Haiti *(E-Haiti) Endemic-Haiti - a species endemic to Haiti *(E-Hisp) Endemic-Hisp - a species endemic to the island of Hispaniola *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Haiti as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

He is a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and has served in the House of Representatives since 2007. He represented the Division of Wakefield until its abolition in 2019, when he transferred to the new Division of Spence. Early life Champion was born in Elizabeth in South Australia. He spent his early years in the rural town of Kapunda and completed his secondary education at Kapunda High School while working part-time as a fruit picker. He also previously worked as a cleaner, salesman and trolley collector. He completed an Arts degree and a Graduate Diploma in Communication at the University of South Australia.Nick Champion profile: ALP Champion became a union official at the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) in 1994, serving as an organiser, training officer and occupational health and safety officer. He is aligned with the Labor Right.Wakefield MP's push to remove 'pokies trickery': The Advertiser 13/9/2009 Champion served as South Australian State President of the Australian Labor Party from 2005 to 2006 and was a ministerial adviser to state Labor Minister Michael Wright.Nick Champion: APH Parliament Labor MPs Champion, Mike Rann, Kevin Rudd and Tony Piccolo in Gawler for the Tour Down Under in 2010. Champion won his seat at the 2007 election, defeating incumbent Liberal Party of Australia member David Fawcett. Champion became only the third Labor member ever to win Wakefield at the 2007 election with a 56.6 percent two-party vote. Champion made it a safe Labor seat on paper at the 2010 election with a 62 percent two-party vote, and became the first Labor member to be re-elected to Wakefield. The South Australian federal redistribution in 2011 had the greatest impact on Wakefield where the Labor margin declined by 1.5 percent. Champion retained Wakefield at the 2013 election on a 53.4 percent two-party vote even as Labor lost government, marking the first time the non-Labor parties won government at an election without winning Wakefield. Champion increased his margin at the 2016 election with a 61 percent two-party vote, again making Wakefield a safe Labor seat on paper. Champion served as a shadow parliamentary secretary (shadow assistant minister from 2016) in Bill Shorten's shadow ministry from 2014 to 2019. In August 2019 he called for the nationalisation of Port Darwin following its lease to a Chinese-owned company. Personal life Champion is married to Fiona Webber, a former Labor political staffer.

This is a list of the bird species recorded in the Dominican Republic. The avifauna of the Dominican Republic included a total of 320 species as of August 2020, according to Bird Checklists of the World (Avibase). Four additional species have been added from different sources. Of the 324, 15 have been introduced by humans and 81 are rare or accidental. According to Avibase, one is endemic and additional 28 species are endemic to the island of Hispaniola which the Dominican Republic shares with Haiti. Two species are extinct and another has been extirpated. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories of occurrence. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in the Dominican Republic *(E-DR) Endemic-DR - a species endemic to the Dominican Republic *(E-H) Endemic-H - a species endemic to the island of Hispaniola *(I) Introduced - a species introduced directly to the Dominican Republic or elsewhere in the New World Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

His current focus is on policy research in the fields of good governance, rule of law, national security, governance reform and promotion of human rights. Background and career Dlawer Ala'Aldeen was born in the town of Koya, near Arbil, in Iraqi Kurdistan. His father (Abdul-Aziz) was a primary school teacher and author of several books published in Kurdish, including \\"the life of Mohammad\\" and \\"Exegesis (Tafsir) of Quran\\". Ala'Aldeen grew up in and around the city of Arbil, and studied medicine in Baghdad. He immigrated to the [United Kingdom] in 1984 where he furthered his education and specialised in infectious diseases and clinical microbiology. He studied tropical medicine at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and trained for PhD in molecular microbiology at the MRC Clinical Research Centre, Harrow-London, UK. He was awarded MRC Research Fellowship before being appointed as a clinical academic in the [Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust] in 1992 and Professor of clinical microbiology in 2002. He founded the Meningococcal Research Group in 1995, which then expanded into the Molecular Bacteriology and Immunology Group in [Nottingham University] in 1999.Molecular Bacteriology and Immunology Group. He was also the Founding Director of the MSc course in Clinical Microbiology in Nottingham University Course List - School of Molecular Medical Sciences - The University of Nottingham He was seconded to the Health Protection Agency (later renamed Public Health England) as Deputy Director of the Centre for Infection in Colindale, London. Dlawer was appointed as the Director of Research at the Royal College of Pathologists in 2009. On 28 October 2009, Ala'Aldeen was sworn in as the Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research in Kurdistan Region of Iraq. He left the position as a result of KRG cabinet change on 5 April 2012. After a brief return to his University position in Nottingham, he founded a new policy-research institute (The Middle East Research Institute, MERI ) in Erbil, Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Lobbying for human rights Ala'Aldeen has long lobbied for Kurdish people's human rights and campaigned for a global ban of chemical and biological weapons. His own parents and siblings were among the survivors of the chemical weapons used in Iraq. He was active in the late 1980s and early 1990s, lobbying within the British Parliament, media, and government. With UK-based colleagues, he founded the Kurdish British Scientific and Medical Support Group (KBSMSG) in 1988, which later became the Kurdish Scientific and Medical Association in 1989. He was elected as the founding Secretary and later the Chairman of KSMA, before the organisation expanded into the Kurdistan Medical and Scientific Federation. He was also an active member of the British academic group, The Working Party on Chemical and Biological weapons between 1988-96. Ala'Aldeen met Mrs/ Margaret Thatcher, the former British Prime Minister, and Dr George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in April 1991 and persuaded them to put pressure on John Major (then British Prime Minister)Thatcher urges 'mercy mission' to fleeing Kurds; The Guardian 4/4/1991 and George HW Bush (then President of the USA) to help end Saddam Hussein's attack on the Kurds. This was in the aftermath of the second Gulf War, when almost two million displaced Kurds fled to the borders with Iran and Turkey. As a consequence, a \\"no-fly zone, Safe Haven\\" was established north of 36th parallel north that lasted from April 1991 until the fall of Saddam regime. The Safe Haven allowed the Kurds in Iraq to return to their homes, elect their own Kurdistan Regional Government and Kurdistan Parliament.

Minister of Higher Education & Scientific Research Ala'Aldeen has long been involved in capacity building for Iraqi and Kurdistan Universities and establishing academic links with British universities. On 28 October 2009, he joined Dr Barham Salih's Cabinet of Kurdistan Regional Government as Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research. He initiated a major reform process in the system of Higher Education, with the aim to raise standards and help Universities gain total independence. He led a major and highly transparent scholarship program for sending thousands of students abroad for Masters and PhD studies. His first-year report (A roadmap to quality) in 2010 and a second year report (On route to quality) in 2011 outline the process of reform, including the first introduction of teaching quality assurance in Universities, continuous academic development for teachers, split-site PhD programs, restructuring university management in preparation for independence, introducing electronic system for student applications, converting technical institutes to Polytechnic Universities and modernising postgraduate (specialised) clinical training. He introduced the process of appointing staff on merit via open competition, and took measures to ensure equal opportunity and gender equality in the system of higher education. He submitted two legislative drafts for reforms in higher education and postgraduate clinical training. Ala'Aldeen faced fierce resistance from anti-reformists and interest groups, particularly when he closed down five private dental and pharmacy Colleges in 2010 and four previously licensed private Universities in 2011. Middle East Research Institute Ala'Aldeen is the Founding President of the Middle East Research Institute (MERI), an independent, grant-funded and non- profit think tank which is focused on policy-issues and governance reform in Iraq and Kurdistan Region. MERI became operational on 18 May, 2014 and has been ranked the first in Iraq and 35th in the Middle East and North Africa (among 507 institutions, top 7%) according to the Global Go To Think Tank Index report issued by the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program at the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Lauder Institute. Ala'Aldeen and colleagues have published numerous policy papers and reports on refugees, Internally Displace persons (IDPs), security dynamics in the Middle East, EU policies in the Region, post-ISIS Iraq, conflict resolution (e.g. the future of Kirkuk), promoting human rights (protecting minority's rights, prevention of violence against women prevention of violence against women) and institutional reform (Judiciary system, public prosecution, interior ministry and Ministry of Peshmarga). Scientific work From 1988 to 2014, Ala'Aldeen has worked on pathogenesis, molecular epidemiology and vaccine development of various bacterial pathogens, particularly Neisseria meningitidis (causes meningitis and sepsis) and Campylobacter jejuni (most common cause of food poisoning). He and his research group discovered a number of bacterial virulence factors and identified their human target receptors. They have also studied the human genetic response to bacteria as well as the population genetics and genome evolution of N. meningitidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ala'Aldeen has published extensively in international scientific journals and co-authored three books in microbiology, Staphylococcus Aureus: molecular and clinical aspects; Molecular and Clinical Aspects of Bacterial Vaccine Development; and Medical Microbiology.

Species on this list are combined from the US Virgin Islands and the British Virgin Islands (which also maintain separate lists). It does not include what some call the Spanish Virgin Islands-Vieques, Culebra and minor surrounding islands which can be found on other lists. The avifauna of the Virgin Islands include a total of 276 species, of which 11 have been introduced by humans. 7 species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 2019 edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for the Virgin Islands. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories, but not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in the Virgin Islands *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to the Virgin Islands as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions *(Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in the Virgin Islands although populations exist elsewhere Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

The institute was incorporated as a limited company on 19 July 1972.limited company, 01061923 Governance The ISTC is managed by its Council, with day-to-day running handled by a professional administration company. Members have the opportunity to contribute their ideas, skills and time to specific Steering Groups and can stand for Council. The ISTC is a member of the Professional Associations Research Network (PARN). This organisation provides a network for professional bodies and offers services and events on subjects such as governance, Continuing Professional Development, ethics and standards, and member relations. The ISTC was one of the sponsors of a project in 2006 to explore the issues affecting professional associations as they grow.Williams, C; Woodhead, S: \\"The Growing Pains of Smaller Professional Associations: Key Issues and Interesting Practice\\". PARN, June 2007). The ISTC has a Code of Professional Practice, with which it expects its members to comply. This was developed in accordance with research carried out by PARN and its author was cited in PARN's third book on ethics.Friedman, A: \\"Ethical Competence and Professional Associations\\", pages 109-111. PARN, 2007 (). Membership Technical communication encompasses a wide range of activities, all with the common thread of communicating complex or important information in the most effective way for the reader. Technical communicators create information that affects people in virtually every industry and area of society. Examples of roles that may be involved in technical communication are: * Technical writing * Technical illustration * Indexing * Editing * Instructional design * Information architecture * Single source publishing *Environmental, safety and health communication * Management The ISTC offers several grades of individual membership. There are two corporate grades, Member (MISTC) and Fellow (FISTC), and two non-corporate grades, Associate and Student. Corporate grades are entitled to vote at the ISTC's AGM. Members cite a sense of community as an important factor in their continued membership.Newell, M: \\"Institute of Scientific and Technical Communicators\\", page 4.

Early life He was born Paul Bertrand Wolfgang Hamburger in Berlin, Germany, in 1926. His parents were Richard Hamburger, a paediatrician at the Charit√© Hospital in Berlin, and his wife, Lili, a Quaker of Polish descent. When the National Socialists came to power and his father was forced out of his profession, the Hamburger family who were Jewish moved to London. Upon their arrival, the family lived in St. John's Wood and Paul was educated at St. Christopher's, a Quaker school in Letchworth, Hertfordshire.John Calder, Roy Hattersley and Jeremy Isaacs, \\"Lord Hamlyn: Obituary\\", The Guardian, 3 September 2001, p. 18. His father died in 1940 when Paul was 14. Shortly afterwards he changed his surname to Hamlyn, which he picked out of the telephone directory. Career He began his publishing career in 1949, selling books from a wheelbarrow in Camden, north-west London.\\"Paul Hamlyn\\", Paul Hamlyn Foundation. In 1965 he set up Music for Pleasure records as a joint venture with EMI. He transformed Paul Hamlyn Group and Octopus Publishing Group, now owned by Hachette Livre, into major UK publishing houses. His success was developed on the idea of publishing eye- catching, glossy books in colour that appealed to a non-literary retail market. In 1961, for example, he published Marguerite Patten's seminal domestic cookery book Everyday Cook Book in Colour, a great success that established Hamlyn in the cookery retail market.\\"Paul Hamlyn\\", Publishing Lives, BBC Radio Four, 13 March 2014. The Everyday Cook Book in Colour had sold in excess of one million copies by 1969.Marguerite Patten, Everyday Cook Book in Colour, Hamlyn Books (1969). Hamlyn used colour at a time when it was unusual and expensive for book publishers to do so, accessing printers and publishers in Czechoslovakia, such as Artia,Philip Jarvis and Sue Thomson, \\"Paul Hamlyn: The Must Be A Better Way...\\", in: Richard Abel and Gordon Graham, eds, Immigrant Publishers: The Impact of Expatriate Publishers in Britain and America in the 20th Century, Routledge, 2017 (ebook edition). for the purpose. It was one of several innovations that included selling his books in retail outlets such as supermarkets and hardware shops, in addition to the usual literary outlets. Awards In 1993 Hamlyn became the University of West London‚Äôs first Chancellor, and was also awarded a Royal Society of Arts medal.\\"About the Library\\", University of West London. He was appointed a CBE in the 1993 Birthday Honours and made a British Life Peer on 23 February 1998, taking the title Baron Hamlyn, of Edgeworth in the County of Gloucestershire. Philanthropy and legacy He established the Paul Hamlyn Foundation in 1987 as a focus for his charitable interests, and it is now one of the UK's largest independent grant-giving organisations. The foundation administers Awards for Artists, the objectives of which include to \\"encourage artists to continue to practice despite outside pressures, financial or otherwise\\".\\"About the Awards\\", Paul Hamlyn Foundation. .

It is the earliest such king-list known, probably dating from around 700 AD. The later Baile In Sc√°il is closely related.

Thurneysen later revised this opinion on the basis of the content of the poem, supposing that the poem's \\"Gl√∫nshalach\\" represented 10th-century king Niall Gl√∫ndub.

A one-room schoolhouse was built on donated land and named for T.J. Cashion, a county commissioner. The school became the center of the community. Oil was discovered in 1918, which led to a significant influx of residents. In the 1920s, the Cooper, Friberg, and Bacon school consolidated with Cashion and eventually the campus was expanded to accommodate a four-year high school. Oil production declined in the 1930s and the high school closed in 1936. Its furnishings were auctioned off in 1945 and Cashion area students attended school in the larger community of Burkburnett.

Education and career Tronson was trained in theology at Morling Baptist Theological College in Sydney, 1977-1980. Following pastorates at Croydon Park and Warragamba (1979‚Äì1983), he served as a part- time industrial chaplain until 1992. In 1984-86 he wrote a doctoral dissertation on sports mission, which earned him a PhD from Louisiana Baptist University in association with Morling College. From 1978-1994 he was The Australian newspaper's hockey writer for Olympics, World Cups and Champions Trophies. He founded the Sports and Leisure Ministry in 1982 and Well-being Australia in 2000. Sports and Leisure Ministry Inspired at an international congress on sports mission in Hong Kong (1982) he pioneered the Sports and Leisure Ministry, in association with the Australian Heads of Churches. The Australian Cricket Board was the first to adopt the idea of a Sports Chaplaincy with the appointment of Tronson as their chaplain. Over the next 18 years he extended this ministry also to many other Australian professional sports associations - involving the placement of 150 chaplains - and developing networks of Christian athletes. He also arranged chaplaincies to Executive Ministries as many board members of sports were in the corporate world, also to the Entertainment, Media, and Tourism sectors. Kevan Gosper, the Australian Olympic Committee President, invited Tronson to be a Chaplain at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. At subsequent Olympics, Tronson has appointed Australian Olympic chaplains. In 2000 Tronson was invited to the IOC Lausanne Switzerland to assist in the development of an Olympic Villages Religious Services protocol. Tronson has undertaken numerous study tours on sports mission, speaking at seminars and engaging in evangelism in United States, United Kingdom, South Korea, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Israel, Turkey, Italy and France. Sports Chaplains are well established and since May 2005, SLM has undergone significant changes and is now known as Sports Chaplaincy Australia Inc. Well-Being Australia In 2000 due to ill health, the Heads of Churches released Tronson from the Sports and Leisure Ministry, establishing a new venture - ‚ÄòWell-Being Australia‚Äô. He continues to network with athletes, especially Australian cricketers and developed athlete respite facilities, Basil Sellers Moruya and Basil Sellers Tweed. Recognition In 2005, Tronson was voted as one of Australia‚Äôs 25 most influential Evangelicals by the national evangelical newspaper New Life.

Two of the warehouses are home to Clipper Logistics and the other one is home to an Amazon UK distribution centre.  2019 planned development of 330 new homes  In January 2019, Manor Oak Homes published plans for 330 new homes.Manor Oak Homes - Grange Park Consultation, January 2019 Most of the community are not opposed to the new development but many believe that there are not enough local services to cope with the new homes as the primary school, doctor's surgery, dental practice and pre-school are already at almost full capacity and with the 330 new homes, there are no new plans for further community buildings.  Demographics  The population of Grange Park was 4,404 as of the 2011 Census. Prior to this, according to the 2001 Census the population was just 327 people, however the village was relatively undeveloped at that time. A census is taken every ten years in the United Kingdom, the next one will be in the year 2021. In the 2011 Census, 82.8% of the Grange Park population identified themselves as White British.  Facilities = Schools  Woodland View Primary School is the only school in Grange Park, it caters for children in primary education from reception up until Year 6. For Secondary education, most children go to Caroline Chisholm School but there are numerous other secondary schools in the area that children can go to.  Community  The village has numerous community facilities such as a community centre, a sports pavilion and a religious centre. These are home for numerous clubs and youth groups such as Scouts and sports clubs. There is also a doctors surgery, a dental practice and a daycare for members of the community to use.  Commercial  Grange Park have a Co-op Food supermarket, a Harvester restaurant, a marstons pub and some take away establishments. There are also two hotels in Grange Park which are in a prime location for business persons due to how close the village is to the M1 motorway.  Industrial  There is a small industrial estate in Grange Park which contain numerous warehouses used as distribution centres for logistics companies. There are also three warehouses that are outside of the industrial estate which are operated by Clipper and Amazon. Grange Park is also a prime location as a logistics hub due to how close the M1 motorway and the A45 trunk road are.  Politics = Parish council  Grange Park Parish Council has 12 members who are elected every four years.  District council  South Northamptonshire have two councillors who are responsible for \\"Grange Ward\\". Councillor Andrew Grant and Councillor Adil Sadygov are both members of the Conservative party.  County council  Northamptonshire County Council has one councillor who is responsible for \\"Hackleton and Grange Park Ward\\". The current councillor for this ward is Councillor Michael Clarke, who is a member of the Conservative party.

The site is managed by the Greenwich Foundation for the Old Royal Naval College, set up in July 1998 as a registered charity to \\"look after these magnificent buildings and their grounds for the benefit of the nation\\". The grounds and some of its buildings are open to visitors. The buildings were originally constructed to serve as the Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich, now generally known as Greenwich Hospital, which was designed by Christopher Wren, and built between 1696 and 1712. The hospital closed in 1869. Between 1873 and 1998 it was the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. Origins of the site The Painted Hall of Greenwich Hospital as drawn by Augustus Pugin and Thomas Rowlandson John Michael Rysbrack's George II (1735) in the Grand Square of the Greenwich Hospital This was originally the site of Bella Court, built by Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and subsequently renamed Palace of Placentia by Margaret of Anjou, wife of Henry VI, upon its confiscation. Rebuilt by Henry VII, it was thenceforth more commonly known as Greenwich Palace. As such, it was the birthplace of Tudor monarchs Henry VIII, Mary I, and Elizabeth I, and reputedly the favourite palace of Henry VIII. The palace fell into disrepair during the English Civil War. With the exception of the incomplete John Webb building, the palace was finally demolished in 1694. Greenwich Hospital In 1692 the Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich was created on the site on the instructions of Mary II, who had been inspired by the sight of wounded sailors returning from the Battle of La Hogue. Architectural highlights included the Chapel and the Painted Hall. The Painted Hall was painted between 1707 and 1726 by Sir James Thornhill. The hospital closed in 1869 and the remains of thousands of sailors and officers were removed from the hospital site in 1875 and reinterred in East Greenwich Pleasaunce or \\"Pleasaunce Park\\".Park Explorer- East Greenwich Pleasaunce ,‚Äì East Greenwich Pleasaunce Royal Naval College, Greenwich Badge of the Royal Hospital on the Water Gate of the Royal Naval College In 1873, four years after the hospital closed, the buildings were converted to a training establishment for the Royal Navy. The Royal Navy finally left the College in 1998 when the site passed into the hands of the Greenwich Foundation for the Old Royal Naval College. Greenwich Foundation for the Old Royal Naval College Since 1998, the site has had new life breathed into it through a mix of new uses and activities and a revival of the historic old site under the management and control of the Greenwich Foundation. The buildings are Grade I listed. In 1999 some parts of Queen Mary and King William, and the whole of Queen Anne and the Dreadnought Building were leased for 150 years by the University of Greenwich. In 2000 Trinity College of Music leased the major part of King Charles. This created a unique new educational and cultural mix. In 2002 the Foundation realised its aim of opening up the whole site to visitors. It opened the Painted Hall, the Chapel and the grounds and a Visitor Centre to the public daily, free of charge, with guided tours available. The Old Royal Naval College became open to students and visitors of all ages and nationalities accompanied often by music wafting from Trinity College. As Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote in 1863, \\"the people are sooner or later the legitimate inheritors of whatever beauty kings and queens create\\". In 2005, the room where Nelson's coffin was held prior to his being laid-in-state was opened as the Nelson Room. The little side room contains a statue of Nelson replicating the one in Trafalgar Square, memorabilia, paintings and information. It can be seen on one of the guided tours that also include a visit to the undercrofts, the old skittle alley and crypt. A service is held in the chapel every Sunday at 11 am which is open to all. Public concerts are regularly held here and a wide variety of business and cultural events are held in the Painted Hall. The area is used by visitors, students, local people and film crews in a traffic-free environment that provides a variety of coffee shops, bars and restaurants, all incorporated within the old buildings, as part of a unique \\"ancient and modern\\" blend that support 21st century life in Greenwich. The Old Royal Naval College and the \\"Maritime Greenwich\\" World Heritage site are becoming focal points for a wide range of business and community activities. Trinity College of Music provide a wide range of musicians and ensembles on a subsidised commercial basis to play at events throughout East London and beyond, part of their business and community ‚Äúout- reach‚Äù policy encouraged and part-funded by the Higher Education Funding Council. The site is regularly used for filming television programmes, television advertisements, and feature films. Productions have included Patriot Games, where an attack on a fictional royal family member, Lord Holmes, was filmed, as well as Shanghai Knights, and a 2006 television advertisement campaign for the British food and clothing retailer Marks & Spencer. Other films include Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Madness of King George, The Mummy Returns, The Avengers (1998) and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001). More recent filming has included BBC television's spy-drama Spooks and the dramatisation of Little Dorrit, David Cronenberg's film Eastern Promises, the film adaptation of Philip Pullman's novel Northern Lights and The Wolf Man (2009). The grounds were used extensively during the filming of 2006's Amazing Grace, and 2011's Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows and Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Scenes were shot at the grounds for The King's Speech, where the site doubled for Buckingham Palace, and The Dark Knight Rises, where it doubled for a cafe in the film's final scenes. In April 2012 the site was used for the iconic barricade scenes in the film adaption of the musical Les Miserables. In October 2012 the college was used for filming Thor: The Dark World. In October 2013 the college was used as a set for The Man from U.N.C.L.E.. Also Guy Richie's 2005 film Revolver filmed a scene there. Painted Hall project In 2014 the Old Royal Naval College announced that it was embarking on the next stage of its ambitious plans to restore the Painted Hall. Over three years 3,700 m2 of Thornhill‚Äôs masterpiece was to be conserved. The conservation project focused on the Lower Hall (the Upper Hall having been conserved in 2013). The project included a unique series of public 'ceiling tours' allowing members of the public to get up close to the painted ceiling and see conservators at work. In March 2019, the hall reopened to the public, the project winning awards.

Similar terms could be found in Poland and Belarus. In history of Ukraine and Belarus such associations appeared first as peasant communes, which gathered their meetings for discussing and resolving current issues. In the 19th century there were number of political organization with the same name. Hromada means not only social association of some people, but in broader sense a symbolic unity of any territorial population or the whole national society. The name \\"hromada\\" was frequently used by political and social organizations, as well as newspapers in Ukraine. The Constitution of Ukraine and some other laws, including the \\"Law on local self-governance\\", delegate certain rights and obligations for \\"hromada\\". Types of hromadas include cities, urban-type settlements, rural settlements, and villages. In his draft constitutional amendments of June 2014 Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed changing the administrative divisions of Ukraine, which should include regions, districts and \\"hromadas\\".Poroshenko suggests granting status of regions to Crimea, Kyiv, Sevastopol, creating new political subdivision of 'community' , Interfax-Ukraine (26 June 2014) On 5 February 2015 the Ukrainian parliament adopted the law \\"On voluntary association of territorial communities\\", which creates new \\"united territorial communities\\" or \\"amalgamated hromadas\\", whereby various types of hromadas including settlement councils, rural councils and cities of district significance can merge to form a new unified administrative unit.

Early life Finch-Hatton was born in Eastwell Park, Kent, England, the fourth son of George Finch-Hatton, 10th Earl of Winchilsea and his wife Fanny Margaretta, daughter of Edward Royd Rice of Dane Court, Kent. He was educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, and at 19 years of age went to Queensland to visit his brother Henry Finch-Hatton. He took up land in the Mackay district and later worked on the Nebo goldfields. Returning to England in 1883 he published in 1885 an account of his travels Advance Australia! (2nd ed. 1886). ‚ÄúAdvance Australia!‚Äù publication According to The Times in 1904 this book was written in an entertaining way, but his statements about the Aborigines and his views on Australian politicians must be accepted with caution. To the modern day reader, however, Finch-Hatton's written recollections of his eight years around the Mackay area of Queensland is an instructive, albeit disturbing, account of British colonial life in the Antipodes. Voyage from Singapore to Keppel Bay Finch-Hatton travelled aboard the Somerset which along the way, somewhere in the Indonesian archipelago, ‚Äúran down a native boat and drowned everyone in it.‚Äù They anchored off the pearling station of Somerset on Cape York where ‚Äúblack divers..go down and bring up the mother-of-pearl shells,‚Äù and a couple of white men have taken residence purely ‚Äúto enjoy the society of black women.‚Äù Finch-Hatton writes that the Government Resident was waging an endless war against the local aboriginal clans. He eventually arrived in Keppel Bay off Rockhampton and then made his way to his brother's station near Mackay. Mackay and surrounds A description of the frontier town of Mackay is given, including the various sheep, cattle and sugar industries that were beginning to be established around it. The implementation of the Marsupial Act is depicted where droves of marsupials were entrapped and destroyed to reduce competition for the fodder of the introduced stock. The author writes about the boiling down establishments where thousands of excess sheep and cattle were boiled down to make tallow, which ensured a basement price for all stock at ¬£1 10s a head. Life on the nearby goldfields of Mt Britten and Canoona is described and the difficult life of a bullock driver is mentioned. Aboriginals In a section about the types of hunting available for the sportsman in Australia, Finch Hatton writes that ‚Äúaway up north an occasional raid after the wild Blacks enlivens the monotony of life.‚Äù He says that just about every station has a couple of ‚Äúblack boys‚Äù working stockmen but ‚Äúthey are not much use after they get about 20 years old..they generally get sent away..and sooner or later die of drink.‚Äù Many aboriginals worked on the tobacco plantations and a school had been set up in Mackay to educate some of them. The deliberate mass poisoning of aboriginals at Long Lagoon is recounted as is the practice ‚Äúwhen the blacks are troublesome, it is generally considered sufficient punishment to go out and shoot one or two.‚Äù He further explains that ‚Äúwhether the blacks deserve any mercy at the hands of the pioneering squatters is an open question, but that they get none is certain. They are a doomed race and..they will be completely wiped out of the land.‚Äù Native Police Finch-Hatton also writes about the Native Police, which was a force of black troopers under the command of a white officer, whose job was to ‚Äúdisperse‚Äù groups of aboriginals who speared livestock and, occasionally, shepherds. He narrates that the Native Police officer ‚Äúknows perfectly well that unless he manages to shoot down a decent number of (blacks) before they can escape his services will soon be dispensed with.‚Äù Kanakas and Coolies The issues surrounding labour on the plantations is described at length. The conditions of Kanaka indentured workers kidnapped or recruited from places like the New Hebrides are mentioned. They were paid a lowly wage of ¬£6 a year on a three-year contract, after which they were induced to spend most of this money at stores in town selling ‚Äúthe most utterly worthless‚Äù goods at an astronomical mark-up. Finch-Hatton tells of a riot at the Mackay races between whites and Kanakas, where in response to the Kanakas throwing bottles, the white men climbed upon their horses and charged them wielding their stirrup-irons, killing a few and driving the rest into the canefields. The political struggle between the plantation owners and those calling for compulsory employment of white labour at good wages is explained. To maintain cheap workers, the planters tried importing ‚Äúcoolie‚Äù labour of ethnicities including Singhalese, Malays, Indians and Maltese. Imperial Federation Finch-Hatton was an enthusiastic advocate for Imperial Federation, where all the Englishmen in the British colonies would unite in a close racial, religious and political unity in order to realise an overwhelming global domination. He ends the book deploring the now mostly realised possibility of the Empire disintegrating and England sinking into obscurity. Politics Finch-Hatton was an unsuccessful candidate for the British House of Commons in 1885, 1886 and 1892, but was returned as a Conservative for Newark in 1895. He resigned in 1898 on account of disagreement with the policy of his party of making concessions made to the Liberal Unionists. He was one of the founders of the Imperial Federation League, and when the North Queensland Separation League was formed he was appointed chairman of the London committee. He also worked for the development of the Pacific route to Australia, and was secretary to the Pacific Telegraph Company for the formation of a line from Vancouver Island to Australia. Later life He died suddenly of heart failure at London on 16 May 1904. He was buried in Ewerby, Lincolnshire. He was unmarried. Legacy The town of Finch Hatton, Queensland in Australia is believed to be named after him.

It is found on many Caribbean islands, from the Bahamas in the north to the Grenadines in the south, with an isolated population on Bonaire. At least two subspecies can be distinguished genetically: Margarops fuscatus fuscatus which is found between the Greater Antilles and Antigua and Barbuda, M. f. densirostris, occurring from Montserrat and Guadeloupe southwards. Its main habitat is bushes and trees in mountain forests and coffee plantations. The pearly-eyed thrasher is described as an aggressive, opportunistic omnivore that feeds primarily on large insects, but also feeds on fruits and berries, and will occasionally eat lizards, frogs, small crabs and other bird's eggs and nestlings. It grows to 28 to 30 cm (11 to 11.8 inches) in length. Because this species nests in cavities it is known to compete with the critically endangered Puerto Rican amazon for nesting sites and may even destroy the eggs of this species. Morphology The pearly-eyed thrasher is the largest species in the Mimidae. Taxonomy St John island, Virgin Islands Its genus, Margarops, is considered monotypic today; formerly the scaly-breasted thrasher was placed here too. The present species, however, is now known to be closer to the Cinclocerthia tremblers. There are four subspecies. Immature northern pearly-eyed thrasher (M. f. fuscatus) While this is not a migratory bird, considerable gene flow between populations appears to have taken place at least until fairly recently in its evolutionary history. At least two subspecies can be distinguished genetically: Margarops fuscatus fuscatus which is found between the Greater Antilles and Antigua and Barbuda, M. f. densirostris, occurring from Montserrat and Guadeloupe southwards. When exactly the pearly-eyed thrasher lineage diverged from its relatives cannot be said with reasonable certainty at the moment, as no fossils are known and the standard molecular clock model cannot be applied to the Mimidae as mutation rates seem to have varied over time. Distribution The pearly-eyed thrasher is found in the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Turks and Caicos islands, the Dominican Republic, many of the Lesser Antilles, and Bonaire in the Netherlands Antilles. In Puerto Rico, as well as occupying the main island, it is also found on Mona island. In the Bahamas, it is a breeding species on San Salvador, Exuma, and Long Island, and probably also on Acklins, Mayaguana, and Great Inagua; in addition it is found as a wintering species on Eleuthra and Cat Island (Bahamas).Stattersfield et al. (1998), pp. 152‚Äì153 In the Lesser Antilles, it is a breeding species in the SSS islands (the northern part of the Netherlands Antilles), Barbuda, Antigua, Montserrat, Guadeloupe, Dominica, Martinique, St. Lucia, St. Thomas, St. Vincent, Barbados and the Grenadines; it formerly occurred on Grenada but is now thought to be extinct there.Stattersfield et al. (1998), pp. 164‚Äì167 Birds of the race bonairensis were formerly found on La Horquilla, one of the Hermanos islands, off the north coast of Venezuela, but it is now believed to be extinct there, last having been reported in 1908. Biology It prefers to live in bushes and trees in mountain forests and coffee plantations. The pearly-eyed thrasher is described as an aggressive, opportunistic omnivore that feeds primarily on large insects, but also feeds on fruits and berries, and will occasionally eat lizards, frogs, small crabs and other bird's eggs and nestlings.

Macy's opened in 2002 alongside a new concourse of shops. The Macy's and the additional stores occupied space originally set aside for an ice skating rink on the south side of the mall, which never came to fruition. In 2008, Macy's acquired the former Robinsons- May location, which on June 14 began operating as the Macy's Men's, Children, and Home store. The original location became a Macy's Women's only store. In 2009, a number of developments helped transform the Promenade. Two new parking garages were built between the Edwards Theatres and Macy's, and between them, a row of shops called \\"The Shops on Promenade Drive\\" was added, with a new entrance through the JCPenney wing with shops and restaurants such as White House Black Market, Apple, P.F. Chang's, LOFT, MAC, Chico's, Soma Intimates, Sleep Number, Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar, Coach, Lululemon, Yard House, Pottery Barn, Williams Sonoma, Brighton Collectibles, The Walking Company, Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que, The Studio, Wireless Plus, and Luna Grill.

On November 7, 2019, it was announced that Sears would be closing this location a part of a plan to close 96 stores nationwide. The store closed in February 2020.  Future developments  In 2016, the city of Temecula approved a \\"multi-million\\" dollar renovation project for the property. Plans are for a two-story open-air plaza to cut though the Macy's wing in the southwestern corner of the property. In addition, the plan includes construction of two new restaurants to be built in what is currently the parking lot west of Macy's south building.

In the 1970s, he was a member of several popular hard rock bands, including Free, where he replaced former bassist Andy Fraser before the band's final album Heartbreaker, and the Faces, where he replaced Ronnie Lane and appears on the band's final single, \\"You Can Make Me Dance, Sing or Anything\\", as well as touring with them and playing on the live album Coast to Coast: Overture and Beginners. He also recorded a number of solo albums and did extensive work as a session musician before retiring from the music industry in the late 1990s. Biography Yamauchi was born in 1946 in Fukuoka, Japan. In the late 1960s, he played with Mickey Curtis and his band called Samurai, and this involvement led to him working as a session musician in both Tokyo and London. In London he became close friends with Ginger Baker and Alan Merrill. In 1972, he contributed to the album Kossoff, Kirke, Tetsu and Rabbit with Free guitarist Paul Kossoff and drummer Simon Kirke, together with keyboard player John \\"Rabbit\\" Bundrick. He subsequently joined Free to participate in their final 1973 studio album Heartbreaker, replacing Andy Fraser. In August 1973 Yamauchi replaced Ronnie Lane in the Faces as their bass guitarist, but according to Faces keyboardist Ian McLagan, Yamauchi's recruitment turned out to be a mistake because he was not really the right type of bassist for them, and he had been hired to replace Lane in haste without the band properly auditioning him beforehand. Furthermore, McLagan stated that Yamauchi embraced a drinking and partying lifestyle when he, Rod Stewart, Ronnie Wood and Kenney Jones were now attempting to minimize their own legendary drinking behaviour and become more creative. ‚ÄúWe made a mistake really with Tetsu,‚Äù said McLagan. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt his fault, but he was a party boy and thought he was in for lots of drinks and a little bit of playing, while we were looking for more creation and a lot less boozing.\\" According to Rod Stewart, Yamauchi was \\"a sweet Japanese guy who barely spoke English\\", and because of this communication barrier his bandmates often found it difficult to understand how he was feeling. Even given these alleged issues however, it's arguable that Yamauchi had been handed something of a poisoned chalice to begin with as his predecessor Ronnie Lane was more than simply the band's bassist - he was also their secondary vocalist and songwriter and a boisterous stage presence, and his departure left a void in the band that anyone would have had a hard time filling entirely. Despite any misgivings some of his bandmates may have harboured about his compatibility, Yamauchi nevertheless remained a fully-contributing member of Faces for over two years - appearing on two single releases, the 1974 live album Coast to Coast: Overture and Beginners and participating in a number of global-scale stadium tours - and his association with the band only came to an end when the group itself dissolved at the end of 1975. Following the breakup of Faces, Yamauchi recorded a solo album and continued working as a session musician.Discogs.com Details his releases in the jazz genre In the late 1970s he returned to Japan, continuing to work as a session musician and tour and record with his own bands and with other artists. He retired from the music industry in the late 1990s, and moved to the countryside with his family to live a quiet life.

The avifauna of Anguilla included a total of 179 species, according to Bird Checklists of the World as of February 2020. Of them, four have been introduced by humans and 98 are rare or accidental. One species on this list has been extirpated. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories of occurrence. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Anguilla * (I) Introduced - a species introduced to the New World as a consequence of human actions Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating. *West Indian whistling-duck, Dendrocygna arborea (A) *Fulvous whistling-duck, Dendrocygna bicolor *Snow goose, Anser caerulescens (A) *Wood duck, Aix sponsa (A) *Blue-winged teal, Spatula discors *Cinnamon teal, Spatula cyanoptera (A) *Northern shoveler, Spatula clypeata *Eurasian wigeon, Mareca penelope (A) *American wigeon, Mareca americana (A) *White-cheeked pintail, Anas bahamensis (A) *Northern pintail, Anas acuta (A) *Green-winged teal, Anas crecca (A) *Ring-necked duck, Aythya collaris *Lesser scaup, Aythya affinis (A) *Long-tailed duck, Clangula hyemalis (A) *Hooded merganser, Lophodytes cucullatus (A) *Ruddy duck, Oxyura jamaicensis Guineafowl Order: GalliformesFamily: Numididae Guineafowl are a group of African, seed- eating, ground-nesting birds that resemble partridges, but with featherless heads and spangled grey plumage. *Helmeted guineafowl, Numida meleagris (I) (A) Flamingos Order: PhoenicopteriformesFamily: Phoenicopteridae Flamingos are gregarious wading birds, usually tall, found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae. Their oddly shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume and, uniquely, are used upside-down. *American flamingo, Phoenicopterus ruber Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. *Pied-billed grebe, Podilymbus podiceps (A) Pigeons and doves Order: ColumbiformesFamily: Columbidae Pigeons and doves are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy cere. *Rock pigeon, Columba livia (I) *Scaly-naped pigeon, Patagioenas squamosa *White-crowned pigeon, Patagioenas leucocephala (A) *Eurasian collared-dove, Streptopelia decaocto (I) (A) *Common ground dove, Columbina passerina *White-winged dove, Zenaida asiatica *Zenaida dove, Zenaida aurita Cuckoos Order: CuculiformesFamily: Cuculidae The family Cuculidae includes cuckoos, roadrunners, and anis.

The Old World cuckoos are brood parasites. *Smooth-billed ani, Crotophaga ani *Yellow-billed cuckoo, Coccyzus americanus (A) *Pearly-breasted cuckoo, Coccyzus euleri (A) *Mangrove cuckoo, Coccyzus minor Nightjars and allies Order: CaprimulgiformesFamily: Caprimulgidae Nightjars are medium-sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs and very short bills. Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is camouflaged to resemble bark or leaves. *Common nighthawk, Chordeiles minor *Antillean nighthawk, Chordeiles gundlachii *White-tailed nightjar, Hydropsalis cayennensis *Chuck-will's-widow, Antrostomus carolinensis Swifts Order: ApodiformesFamily: Apodidae Swifts are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang. *Black swift, Cypseloides niger *White-collared swift, Streptoprocne zonaris Hummingbirds Order: ApodiformesFamily: Trochilidae Hummingbirds are small birds capable of hovering in mid-air due to the rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backwards. *Purple-throated carib, Eulampis jugularis (A) *Green-throated carib, Eulampis holosericeus *Antillean crested hummingbird, Orthorhyncus cristatus (extirpated) Rails, gallinules, and coots Order: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots, and gallinules. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers. *Clapper rail, Rallus crepitans *Sora, Porzana carolina (A) *Spotted crake, Porzana porzana (A) *Common gallinule, Gallinula galeata *American coot, Fulica americana (A) *Purple gallinule, Porphyrio martinica (A) Stilts and avocets Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Recurvirostridae Recurvirostridae is a family of large wading birds which includes the avocets and stilts.

Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. *Black-headed gull, Chroicocephalus ridibundus (A) *Laughing gull, Leucophaeus atricilla *Franklin's gull, Leucophaeus pipixcan (A) *Ring-billed gull, Larus delawarensis (A) *Herring gull, Larus argentatus (A) *Lesser black-backed gull, Larus fuscus (A) *Great black-backed gull, Larus marinus *Brown noddy, Anous stolidus (A) *Black noddy, Anous minutus (A) *Sooty tern, Onychoprion fuscata (A) *Bridled tern, Onychoprion anaethetus *Least tern, Sternula antillarum *Gull-billed tern, Gelochelidon nilotica (A) *Roseate tern, Sterna dougallii (A) *Common tern, Sterna hirundo (A) *Royal tern, Chlidonias maxima *Sandwich tern, Chlidonias sandvicensis Tropicbirds Order: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings. *White-tailed tropicbird, Phaethon lepturus (A) *Red-billed tropicbird, Phaethon aethereus (A) Southern storm-petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The storm-petrels are the smallest seabirds, relatives of the petrels, feeding on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. Until 2018, this family's species were included with the other storm-petrels in family Hydrobatidae. *Wilson's storm-petrel, Oceanites oceanicus Northern storm- petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae Though the members of this family are similar in many respects to the southern storm-petrels, including their general appearance and habits, there are enough genetic differences to warrant their placement in a separate family. *Leach's storm- petrel, Oceanodroma leucorhoa Shearwaters and petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Audubon's shearwater, Puffinus lherminieri Frigatebirds Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans.

Some species have feet with two toes pointing forward and two backward, while several species have only three toes. Many woodpeckers have the habit of tapping noisily on tree trunks with their beaks. *Yellow- bellied sapsucker, Sphyrapicus varius Falcons and caracaras Order: FalconiformesFamily: Falconidae Falconidae is a family of diurnal birds of prey. They differ from hawks, eagles, and kites in that they kill with their beaks instead of their talons. *American kestrel, Falco sparverius (A) *Merlin, Falco columbarius (A) *Peregrine falcon, Falco peregrinus Tyrant flycatchers Order: PasseriformesFamily: Tyrannidae Tyrant flycatchers are passerine birds which occur throughout North and South America. They superficially resemble the Old World flycatchers, but are more robust and have stronger bills. They do not have the sophisticated vocal capabilities of the songbirds. Most, but not all, have plain colouring. As the name implies, most are insectivorous. *Caribbean elaenia, Elaenia martinica *Gray kingbird, Tyrannus dominicensis *Fork-tailed flycatcher, Tyrannus savana Vireos, shrike-babblers, and erpornis Order: PasseriformesFamily: Vireonidae The vireos are a group of small to medium-sized passerine birds. They are typically greenish in colour and resemble wood warblers apart from their heavier bills. *Black-whiskered vireo, Vireo altiloquus Swallows Order: PasseriformesFamily: Hirundinidae The family Hirundinidae is adapted to aerial feeding. They have a slender streamlined body, long pointed wings, and a short bill with a wide gape.

Spence Field is a mountain highland meadow in the Great Smoky Mountains, located in the Southeastern United States. It has an elevation of 4,920 feet (1,500 m) above sea level.http://www.nps.gov/grsm/naturescience/mountains.htm The Appalachian Trail traverses the field, and a backcountry shelter just off the trail provides an overnight stopover for through-hikers. Like much of the Smokies crest, Spence Field lies along the Tennessee-North Carolina border, between Blount County and Swain County. It rises above Cades Cove to the north and above Fontana Lake to the south. The \\"field\\" spreads out atop the crest, covering approximately 200 acres (0.8 km¬≤).Alberta and Carson Brewer, Valley So Wild (Knoxville: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1975), 124. Spence Field is a crossroads of sorts of the Western Smokies. The Appalachian Trail crosses the field from east to west, and is joined by the Bote Mountain Trail from the north and the Eagle Creek Trail from the south. The Bote Mountain Trail connects Spence Field with Cades Cove, Little River Road, and Tremont. The Eagle Creek Trail connects Spence with the Benton MacKaye Trail and Fontana Lake. Along the A.T., Thunderhead Mountain is just two miles (3 km) to the east, and Gregory Bald is just over to the west. Spence Field is a grassy bald, a type of meadow found in higher elevations in the Appalachian Mountains. Grassy balds are characterized by thick grass and relatively sparse tree coverage.Carson Brewer, Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Portland, Ore: Graphic Arts Center Publishing, 1993), 21. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Spence Field was roughly at the center of a pasture that stretched across the crest of the Western Smokies from Gregory Bald in the west all the way to Silers Bald to the east.Alberta and Carson Brewer, Valley So Wild (Knoxville: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1975), 124. Since the establishment of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the 1930s, however, wooded plants have started reclaiming much of this stretch, including Spence. The park service currently maintains the grassy balds atop Gregory Bald and Andrews Bald, while allowing the others to return to their natural state.  History  Deer grazing at Spence Field. Spence Field is named after James Spence, a settler who built a cabin at the field in 1830.Durwood Dunn, Cades Cove: The Life and Death of an Appalachian Community (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 43. Spence and his wife, Caroline Law, were connected with the Cades Cove area, but preferred the solitude of the high mountains. They lived and herded livestock at Spence Field during the warmer months, only rarely visiting the lower elevations. Historian Durwood Dunn, describing the Spences' eschewal of the more populated bottomlands, explains: > A few days before the birth of their son Robert in 1840, she (Caroline > Spence) walked alone ten miles to their home in the White Oak Cove in order > to be near neighbors who could assist her. Other than such emergencies as > childbirth and the approach of winter, however, nothing could induce them to > leave their mountain.Durwood Dunn, Cades Cove: The Life and Death of an > Appalachian Community (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 43. John Oliver, the first settler in Cades Cove, claimed that Spence burned trees and cleared Spence Field in the 1830s, lending credence to the argument that Spence Field is not a natural bald.Durwood Dunn, Cades Cove: The Life and Death of an Appalachian Community (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 33. Regardless, the field was still being used as a summer-time pasture in 1900, where thousands of cows, horses, sheep, and goats grazed while the bottomlands were used for planting crops.Carson Brewer, Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Portland, Ore: Graphic Arts Center Publishing, 1993), 21. Arnold Guyot, who surveyed much of the Smokies crest in the late 1850s, measured the elevation of \\"Spence cabin\\" at .Robert Mason, The Lure of the Great Smokies (Boston and New York: Houghton-Mifflen, 1927), 55-56. Author Horace Kephart frequented Spence Field-- specifically a herder's shack at Spence known as \\"Spencer cabin\\"-- in the early 1900s.Horace Kephart, Our Southern Highlanders (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1976), 64.  Access  Looking southeast from Spence Field. The Bote Mountain Trail, which intersects the Appalachian Trail at Spence Field, can be accessed at its trailhead along Little River Road or via several spur trails. From this trailhead, it is approximately to Spence. From the Lead Cove trailhead, also on Little River Road, it is approximately to Spence. From Cades Cove (via the Anthony Creek Trail, which rises out of the campground), it is approximately to Spence Field. The Eagle Creek trailhead is located on the north side of Fontana Dam, and rises to Spence Field. The Jenkins Ridge Trail connects Spence Field with the remote Hazel Creek area, in the southwestern Smokies. The Spence Field Shelter can accommodate 12 backpackers. A permit is required for overnight use. The shelter is located along the Eagle Creek Trail, approximately 100 meters south of the Appalachian Trail junction. The Russell Field and Mollies Ridge shelters are just a few miles to the west.

It depicts the Nineteenth Dynasty Pharaoh Ramesses II wearing the Nemes head-dress with a cobra diadem on top. The damaged statue has since lost its body and lower legs. It is one of a pair that originally flanked the Ramesseum's doorway. The head of the other statue is still found at the temple.  Description  The Younger Memnon is high √ó wide (across the shoulders). It weighs 7.25 tons and was cut from a single block of two-coloured granite. There is a slight variation of normal conventions in that the eyes look down slightly more than usual, and to exploit the different colours (broadly speaking, the head is in one colour, and the body another).  Acquisition = Belzoni  The pair to The Younger Memnon, still at the Ramesseum Napoleon's men tried but failed to dig and remove it to France during his 1798 expedition there, during which he did acquire but then lost the Rosetta Stone. It was during this attempt that the hole on the right of the torso (just above Ramesses's right nipple) is said to have been made. The installation of the Younger Memnon at the BM sculpture gallery Following an idea mentioned to him by his friend Johann Ludwig Burckhardt of digging the statue and bringing it to Britain, the British Consul General Henry Salt hired the adventurer Giovanni Belzoni in Cairo in 1815 for this purpose. Using his hydraulics and engineering skills, it was pulled on wooden rollers by ropes to the bank of the Nile opposite Luxor by hundreds of workmen. However, no boat was yet available to take it up to Alexandria and so Belzoni carried out an expedition to Nubia, returning by October. With French collectors also in the area possibly looking to acquire the statue, he then sent workmen to Esna to gain a suitable boat and in the meantime carried out further excavations in Thebes. He finally loaded the products of these digs, plus the Memnon, onto this boat and got it to Cairo by 15 December 1816. There he received and obeyed orders from Salt to unload all but the Memnon, which was then sent on to Alexandria and London without him. Anticipated by Shelley's poem \\"Ozymandias\\", the head arrived in 1818 on in Deptford. In London it acquired its name \\"The Younger Memnon\\", after the \\"Memnonianum\\" (the name in classical times for the Ramesseum ‚Äì the two statues at the entrance of the mortuary temple of Amenhotep III were associated with Memnon in classical times, and are still known as the Colossi of Memnon. The British Museum sculpture and its pair seem to have either been mistaken for them or suffered a similar misnaming).  British Museum Another view of The Younger Memnon It was later acquired from Salt in 1821 by the British Museum and was at first displayed in the old Townley Galleries (now demolished) for several years, then installed (using heavy ropes and lifting equipment and with help from the Royal Engineers) in 1834 in the new Egyptian Sculpture Gallery (now Room 4, where it now resides). The soldiers were commanded by a Waterloo veteran, Major Charles Cornwallis Dansey, lame from a wound sustained there, who therefore sat whilst commanding them. On its arrival there, it could be said to be the first piece of Egyptian sculpture to be recognized as a work of art rather than a curiosity low down in the chain of art (with ancient Greek art at the pinnacle of this chain). It is museum number EA 19. In February 2010, the statue was featured as object 20 in A History of the World in 100 Objects, a BBC Radio 4 programme by British Museum director Neil MacGregor.

The first tropical cyclone and first hurricane of the hurricane season, Anna developed on July 20 from an easterly wave located in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) over the Windward Islands. Initially a tropical storm, it moved westward across the Caribbean Sea. Favorable environmental conditions allowed Anna to reach hurricane intensity late on July 20\\\\. Early on the following day, the storm strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Intensification continued, and on July 22, Anna peaked with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). The hurricane then weakened slightly while approaching the coast of Honduras. Further weakening occurred; when Anna made landfall in landfall in Belize (then known as British Honduras) on July 24, winds decreased to 80 mph (130 km/h). Anna rapidly weakened over land and dissipated later that day. As a developing tropical cyclone over the Leeward Islands, Anna produced strong winds over Grenada, though damage was limited to some crops, trees, and telephone poles. Other islands experienced gusty winds, but no damage. Passing just north of Venezuela, the hurricane produced strong winds over the country, peaking as high as 70 mph (115 km/h). Strong winds caused widespread damage in northern Honduras. Throughout the country, at least 36 homes were destroyed and 228 were damaged. Severe damage in the Gracias a Dios Department left hundreds of people homeless. Additionally, high winds toppled approximately 5,000 coconut trees. Overall, Anna caused a fatality and $300,000 in damage (1961 USD), primarily in Central America. Meteorological history The origins of Hurricane Anna were likely from an easterly wave located over Africa. On July 16, Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) imagery showed a cloud mass situated about west-southwest of the southernmost islands of Cape Verde. The existence of an easterly wave was not confirmed by United States Navy reconnaissance aircraft and ship reports until the following day, at which time the system was located over 445 miles (715 km) east of Antigua. Although no circulation existed while the wave approached the Windward Islands, significant amounts of deep convection was associated with the system and located near the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Early on July 20, ship reports indicated a developing circulation between Grenada and Trinidad; squalls on the former island produced wind gusts as strong as . According to HURDAT - the North Atlantic hurricane database - the system developed into Tropical Storm Anna at 0000 UTC on July 20, as confirmed by a reconnaissance aircraft flight. Situated about east-northeast of Tobago with an initial wind speed of 40 mph (65 km/h), Anna immediately began to strengthen while moving slightly north of due west. The first advisory on Anna, issued at 1330 UTC on July 20, reported sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Later that day, the storm was upgraded to a hurricane after a reconnaissance aircraft reported hurricane-force winds. Anna then deepened more steadily, becoming a Category 2 hurricane early on July 21\\\\. At 1200 UTC on the next day, Anna attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Early on July 23, Anna weakened to a Category 1 hurricane while approaching the northern coast of Honduras. Around 12:00 UTC on the following day, Anna made landfall in a rural area of Stann Creek District, Belize, with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Late on July 24, the system weakened to a tropical storm and then dissipated. Preparations The United States Weather Bureau issued tropical cyclone watches and warnings for Venezuela, Cura√ßao, Bonaire and Aruba. In Jamaica, meteorologists forecast that the storm would bypass the island to the south without causing any effects. As Anna continued westward, it was predicted to make landfall in either northern Nicaragua or southeastern Honduras. Residents in those countries were advised to take precautions ahead of the storm. Central Americans residing along Gulf of Honduras were also warned about tides and strong winds. As the storm neared Honduras, small boats and other water craft were advised to remain in port. Additionally, a hurricane watch was posted for the Swan Islands. In Belize, the threat of the storm forced 100 residents to evacuate their homes, while numerous businesses were closed down. At Belize Harbor, many ships and boats were moved upstream inland. The hurricane was also forecast to bring heavy rainfall to the mountainous areas of Belize, causing a concern for flash flooding. Additionally, Belize's Church Welfare Service began to ship clothing and other materials in anticipation of the hurricane. Impact The precursor to Hurricane Anna. In Grenada, Anna produced wind gusts of 50 mph (80 km/h). Damage from the storm's impact on Grenada was limited to banana crops, trees, and telephone poles. Winds were light on Barbados and Saint Lucia, reaching only on both islands. Damage on Trinidad was minor. In northern Venezuela and the ABC Islands, the storm produced winds of 50-70 mph (80-113 km/h) in Cura√ßao, Los Hermanos and La Blanquilla; A weather station in Aruba reported winds of 50 mph (80 km/h). In Honduras, damage from Anna was moderate and limited to the Atlantic coast. A weather station in Tela recorded rainfall of 0.29-1.5 inches (7.3-25.4 mm) over a two-day period, and another station in Puerto Cort√©s measured . In Plaplaya, the storm damaged 215 homes. In Trujillo, a number of buildings suffered damage. At Lim√≥n, nine houses were destroyed and eighteen more were left uninhabitable. Serious damage also occurred in Gracias a Dios Department, where hundreds of people were left homeless. On the Bay Islands, nine houses were demolished and thirteen suffered damage. High winds toppled about 5,000 coconut trees on √ötila. Damage from Anna in Honduras amounted to $300,000. The hurricane killed one person and injured 12 others, and victims required food and medical aid in Anna's wake. In Belize, Anna produced waves 7‚Äì10 ft (2.1‚Äì3 m) and gusty winds. Though unspecific, there were reports of considerable damage in the country.

At the age of 16, he joined GM as apprentice in the Opel technical development center in R√ºsselsheim, Germany, and retired at the age of 61 at the end of 2003 as chairman and managing director of Australian GM subsidiary, Holden, having served in a number of managerial positions at Opel, Holden, and General Motors internationally.  Beginnings  Peter spent most of his early career working for GM's Opel division in Germany as a vehicle tester and suspension engineer. In 1976 Hanenberger was approached by GM-Holden Australia to assist with suspension work on their vehicles, and with notice of a month from Opel, he was transferred there. During that year he assisted Holden with a new suspension tuning update for their cars, entitled RTS (\\"Radial Tuned Suspension\\"). Applied firstly to the Holden Sunbird, then to all other Holdens (and the Vauxhall Chevette in New Zealand), it transformed the overall handling dynamics of the entire Holden range for the better in Australian road conditions. Well liked by the people at Holden for his genial and professional manner, Hanenberger left Australia to return to Opel in the early 1980s, becoming GM vice president and group executive of Opel's International Technical Development Centre (ITDC) in R√ºsselsheim, Germany. In 1998, Hanenberger was in line to replace Gary Cowger as the head of Opel. However, the Opel supervisory board rejected Hanenberger and signaled that his contract won't be renewed.  Holden  In 1999, it was announced that Hanenberger was to be the new chairman and managing director of Holden. On assignment with Holden in the 1970s, Hanenberger had assisted Holden engineers with their \\"European look\\" design briefs, and upon his return in 1999, he implemented quality control and improved production engineering principles. After discovering that the prototype Holden Monaro had been built by a group of enthusiastic and dedicated Holden engineers in their free time, Hanenberger encouraged the development of the prototype into production-readiness, and sought out export markets to guarantee the car's production. Hanenberger also consolidated the maker's exports programmes of its VT Commodore/WH Statesman/Caprice platform, and the cars quickly became favorites in the Middle East, winning numerous motoring press awards. In 2003, he announced that he would retire, after spending about 45 years with GM.  Retirement  Hanenberger retired to his home town of Wiesbaden. As a farewell gift from Holden, they made him a once only special Holden Monaro. It is left hand drive (for Europe), with a special Pontiac GTO LS1 V8 engine. There was also a HRT0001 Monaro coupe Hanenberger had built as a special order company car when he was Holden CEO. This was a black Monaro CV8 with the Callaway C4B engine, GTO badging, unique interior trim, HSV brakes and HRT front and rear spoilers (same as HRT427) and was called \\"HRT Coupe 0001\\" this was the only \\"non-HSV\\" car to use a CB4 engine.

Downloaded from http://www.birds.cornell.edu/clementschecklist/download/ Retrieved August 15, 2019 The following tags have been used to highlight some categories of occurrence; the tags are from Bird Checklists of the World. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Germany *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Germany as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions, and has become established Rheas Order: RheiformesFamily: Rheidae The rheas are large flightless birds native to South America. Their feet have three toes rather than four which allows them to run faster. *Greater rhea, Rhea americana (I) (see note)A population of greater rheas in a small area has grown to at least 150 birds from several which escaped from a farm in 2000. However, the Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft (German Ornithologists Society) does not consider them established because three generations have not passed. Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating. Pheasants, grouse, and allies Order: GalliformesFamily: Phasianidae The Phasianidae are a family of terrestrial birds which consists of quails, partridges, snowcocks, francolins, spurfowls, tragopans, monals, pheasants, peafowls, and jungle fowls.

The highway would have connected I-90 in to I-87 and the Albany International Airport in Colonie. I-687 faced opposition from those living in the path of the highway, and ultimately all that was built of the highway was its interchange with I-90 in Albany, which now connects to a surface road, Corporate Woods Boulevard. The project was cancelled in 1973, and I-687 was removed from the Interstate Highway System four years later. A small portion of what would‚Äôve been I-687 is now used as a connector between the Adirondack Northway and the Albany International Airport, however it does not have a route designation and was completed as its own separate project in November 2019. Route description I-687 was to begin between exits 24 and 25 on the New York State Thruway. It would continue north to a diamond intersection with NY-5 (Central Avenue). It would then proceed north and east to an exit with NY-155, and farther to an interchange with Interstate 88, via a connector running on the west side of the airport. I-687 would then have an entrance to the Albany International Airport, the main reason for its existence. Continuing east, I-687 would then have a cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 87 (the Adirondack Northway). Continuing east, I-687 would enter an interchange with a proposed northward extension of NY-85 (the Crosstown Arterial), serving as the northern terminus of NY-85. The highway would then curve southeast into a diamond interchange with Osborne Road. After one final interchange with Everett Road, I-687 would end at exit 5A on I-90, now not associated with the Thruway. This would also include an entrance and exit to North Manning Boulevard, for direct access to Downtown Albany. The highway would have been long. History The initial plans for the Capital District's portion of the Interstate Highway System were drawn up in the late 1950s. One of the highways proposed at this time was I-687, also known as the \\"Northway Connection\\". When the Adirondack Northway (I-87) was completed through Colonie in 1960, a gap was left in the Northway's exit numbering system for an interchange with I-687. The exits with NY 5 (Central Avenue) and Albany Shaker Road were designated as exits 2 and 4, respectively, leaving exit 3 for I-687. No such gap was left on the toll-free section of I-90, where the I-687 exit was numbered exit 5A. The construction of I-687 would have forced hundreds of households from their homes, most of which are located off of Albany Shaker Road (NY-155 east of I-87). By way of comparison, today's Crossing Park in Colonie would have been directly in the path of the highway. As such, the project faced opposition from residents of the town of Colonie. The construction of the road was started despite the controversy surrounding it, and the interchange with I-90 was completed . Construction was halted soon afterward, however, as state and federal funds were diverted away from the project. I-687 and the proposed northward extension of the Crosstown Arterial (NY 85) were both cancelled by the state of New York in late September 1973, at which time the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) requested that I-687 be removed from the Interstate Highway System. The request was granted in 1977. I-90 exit 5A, the only part of the project that was ever constructed, was left as an interchange to nowhere for roughly a decade. The North Manning Boulevard connection was never built. In the early 1980s, the large, freeway-standard trumpet interchange was linked up with Corporate Woods Boulevard, a local, two-lane street leading to an office park located just north of I-90 on Albany Shaker Road. The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) reconfigured the exit 4 and 5 ramps, which helped relieve traffic congestion in this area. On July 9, 2019, it was announced that the new airport connector will become exit 3. Exit 3 gives access to Albany International Airport, exit 4 gives access to Wolf Road, and the exit 5 ramp southbound was realigned to meet directly with the Northway, instead of through the conjoined frontage road. Exit 4 will be relocated, and will become an access exit to Albany Shaker Road and Albany International Airport. Current form While the idea for I-687 is basically dead as of the end of 2019 with only an interchange to nowhere at exit 5A on I-90 built, a new exit 3 flyover ramp from I-87 (the Adirondack Northway) to NY 155 (Albany Shaker Road) called the Albany Airport Connector is currently in use where I-687 would've been built, providing an easier connection between the Northway and the Airport. The connector was completed in November 2019.

Whereas most language learning is guided by teachers and textbooks, data- driven learning treats language as data and students as researchers undertaking guided discovery tasks. Underpinning this pedagogical approach is the data - information - knowledge paradigm (see DIKW pyramid). It is informed by a pattern-based approach to grammar and vocabulary, and a lexicogrammatical approach to language in general. Thus the basic task in DDL is to identify patterns at all levels of language. From their findings, foreign language students can see how an aspect of language is typically used, which in turn informs how they can use it in their own speaking and writing. Learning how to frame language questions and use the resources to obtain data and interpret it is fundamental to learner autonomy. When students arrive at their own conclusions through such procedures, they use their higher order thinking skills (see Bloom's taxonomy) and are creating knowledge (see Vygotsky). In DDL, students use the same types of tools that professional linguists use, namely a corpus of texts that have been sampled and stored electronically, and a concordancer, which is a search engine designed for linguistic analysis. Some tools have been specifically created for data-driven learning, such as SkELL, WriteBetter, and Micro-concord. Micro-concord was the first significant software designed for classroom use. It was developed for the MS-DOS microcomputers by Tim Johns and Mike Scott and published for DOS computers in 1993 by OUP. It evolved into the widely-used WordSmith Tools. Johns (1936 ‚Äì 2009) pioneered data-driven learning and coined the term. It first appeared in an article, Should you be persuaded: Two examples of data-driven learning (1991). His paper, From Printout to Handout,Johns, Tim. \\"From Printout to Handout: Grammar and Vocabulary Teaching in the Context of Data-Driven Learning\\". ELR Journal (Birmingham), Vol. 4, 1991. is reprinted and discussed at length in Volume 2 of Hubbard's Computer-Assisted Language Learning.Hubbard, Philip. Computer-Assisted Language Learning. Routledge, 2009. Thomas' task-based Discovering English with Sketch EngineThomas, James. Discovering English with Sketch Engine. VERSATILE, 2016. exemplifies DDL and acknowledges Johns throughout. Other recent books on DDL which credit Johns as the originator of the approach include those by Anderson and Corbett (2009)Anderson, W., & Corbett, J. Exploring English with online corpora. London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2009., Reppen (2010)Reppen, R. Using corpora in the classroom. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010., Bennett (2010)Bennett, G.

Johns worked at the English for Overseas Students Unit of Birmingham University from 1971 till the end of his career. This was while John Sinclair led a large team of linguists at Birmingham University working on the COBUILD project which delivered the first major corpus-based dictionaries and grammars of English for foreign students. COBUILD however, never tasked students with exploring language data themselves. Johns' referred to his specific DDL approach as kibitzing: when he returned his students' written work, together they would explore the errors using corpus data. A selection of these Kibbitzer tutorials are accessible on Mike Scott‚Äôs website. Despite the widespread awareness of corpora among the major movers and shakers in foreign language teaching, DDL is not widely embraced by its practitioners. One of the main reasons for this is the incompatibility of views on language and language learning: traditional language teachers and textbooks have a prescriptive view of language treating it as a system of rules to be memorised, engaging only lower order thinking skills. A descriptive view of language permits the observation of language patterns and outliers that exist in language itself. DDL positions students to use higher order thinking skills to learn how to learn to make and learn from their own observations. Such guided discovery leads to fuzzy results, which are incompatible with prescriptive linguistics and teaching. There is a considerable body of research conducted into DDL as evidenced by the professional bodies, books, journal articles and conference presentations. TaLC (Teaching and Language Corpora) is a biennial conference that is a platform for corpus-based research that has a pedagogical focus. CorpusCALL is a special interest group within EuroCALL and is mostly active through its Facebook group. The online teaching journal, Humanising Language Teaching hosts a section called Corpus Ideas.

Most contemporary ethologists view the elephant as one of the world's most intelligent animals. With a mass of just over , an elephant's brain has more mass than that of any other land animal, and although the largest whales have body masses twenty times those of a typical elephant, a whale's brain is barely twice the mass of an elephant's brain. In addition, elephants have around 257 billion neurons. Elephant brains are similar to humans' and many other mammals' in terms of general connectivity and functional areas, with several unique structural differences. Although initially estimated to have as many neurons as a human brain, the elephant's cortex has about one-third of the number of neurons as a human brain. Elephants manifest a wide variety of behaviors, including those associated with grief, learning, mimicry, play, altruism, use of tools, compassion, cooperation,BBC: Elephants know how to co- operate http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9417000/9417308.stm self-awareness, memory, and communication. Further, evidence suggests elephants may understand pointing: the ability to nonverbally communicate an object by extending a finger, or equivalent. It is thought they are equal with cetaceans and primates in this regard. Due to such claims of high intelligence and due to strong family ties of elephants, some researchers argue it is morally wrong for humans to cull them. Aristotle described the elephant as \\"the animal that surpasses all others in wit and mind.\\" Structure of the brain=Cerebral cortex The elephant (both Asian and African) has a very large and highly complex neocortex, a trait also shared by humans, other apes and certain dolphin species. Asian elephants have the greatest volume of cerebral cortex available for cognitive processing of all existing land animals. Elephants have a volume of cerebral cortex available for cognitive processing that exceeds that of any primate species, with one study suggesting elephants be placed in the category of great apes in terms of cognitive abilities for tool use and tool making. The elephant brain exhibits a gyral pattern more complex and with more numerous convolutions, or brain folds, than that of humans, other primates, or carnivores, but less complex than that of cetaceans. Elephants are believed to rank equal with dolphins in terms of problem-solving abilities, and many scientists tend to rank elephant intelligence at the same level as cetaceans; a 2011 article published by ABC Science suggests that, \\"elephants [are as] smart as chimps, [and] dolphins\\". Other areas of the brain Elephants also have a very large and highly convoluted hippocampus, a brain structure in the limbic system that is much bigger than that of any human, primate or cetacean. The hippocampus of an elephant takes up about 0.7% of the central structures of the brain, comparable to 0.5% for humans and with 0.1% in Risso's dolphins and 0.05% in bottlenose dolphins. The hippocampus is linked to emotion through the processing of certain types of memory, especially spatial. This is thought to be possibly why elephants suffer from psychological flashbacks and the equivalent of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The encephalization quotient (EQ) (the size of the brain relative to body size) of elephants ranges from 1.13 to 2.36. The average EQ is 2.14 for Asian elephants, and 1.67 for African, with the overall average being 1.88. In comparison to other animals, the La Plata dolphin has an EQ of 1.67; the Ganges river dolphin of 1.55; the orca of 2.57; the bottlenose dolphin of 4.14; and the tucuxi dolphin of 4.56; chimpanzees at 2.49; dogs at 1.17, cats at 1.00; and mice at 0.50. Humans have an EQ of 7.44. Brain size at birth relative to adult brain size Comparing brain size at birth to the size of a fully developed adult's brain is one way to estimate how much an animal relies on learning as opposed to instinct. The majority of mammals are born with a brain close to 90% of the adult weight, while humans are born with 28%, bottlenose dolphins with 42.5%, chimpanzees with 54%, and elephants with 35%. This may indicate that elephants require the second highest amount of learning while developing (next to humans), and that their behavior is less instinctual than taught. This is further supported by the elephant's long juvenile period and large temporal lobes, which are associated in the storage of memories. Spindle neurons Spindle cells appear to play a central role in the development of intelligent behavior. As well as in humans and the rest of the great apes, spindle neurons are also found in the brains of both Asian and African elephants, as well as humpback whales, fin whales, killer whales, sperm whales, bottlenose dolphins, Risso's dolphins, and beluga whales. The remarkable similarity between the elephant brain and the human brain supports the thesis of convergent evolution. Elephant society The elephant has one of the most closely knit societies of any living species. Elephant families can only be separated by death or capture. Cynthia Moss, an ethologist specialising in elephants, recalls an event involving a family of African elephants. ::Two members of the family were shot by poachers, who were subsequently chased off by the remaining elephants. Although one of the elephants died, the other, named Tina, remained standing, but with knees beginning to give way. Two family members, Trista and Teresia (Tina's mother), walked to both sides of Tina and leaned in to hold her up. Eventually, Tina grew so weak, she fell to the ground and died. However, Trista and Teresia did not give up but continually tried to lift her. They managed to get Tina into a sitting position, but her body was lifeless and fell to the ground again. As the other elephant family members became more intensely involved in the aid, they tried to put grass into Tina's mouth. Teresia then put her tusks beneath Tina's head and front quarters and proceeded to lift her. As she did so, her right tusk broke completely off, right up to the lip and nerve cavity. The elephants gave up trying to lift Tina but did not leave her; instead, they began to bury her in a shallow grave and throw leaves over her body. They stood over Tina for the night and then began to leave in the morning. The last to leave was Teresia. Because elephants are so closely knit and highly matriarchal, a family can be devastated by the death of another (especially a matriarch), and some groups never recover their organization. Cynthia Moss has observed a mother, after the death of her calf, walk sluggishly at the back of a family for many days. Edward Topsell stated in his publication The History of Four-Footed Beasts in 1658, \\"There is no creature among all the Beasts of the world which hath so great and ample demonstration of the power and wisdom of almighty God as the elephant.\\" Elephants are believed to be on par with chimpanzees with regard to their cooperative skills. Elephant altruism Elephants are thought to be highly altruistic animals that even aid other species, including humans, in distress. In India, an elephant was helping locals lift logs by following a truck and placing the logs in pre-dug holes upon instruction from the mahout (elephant trainer). At a certain hole, the elephant refused to lower the log. The mahout came to investigate the hold-up and noticed a dog sleeping in the hole. The elephant only lowered the log when the dog was gone. When an elephant is hurt, other elephants (even if they are unrelated) aid them. Cynthia Moss has often seen elephants going out of their way to avoid hurting or killing a human, even when it was difficult for them (such as having to walk backwards to avoid a person). Joyce Poole documented an encounter told to her by Colin Francombe on Kuki Gallman's Laikipia Ranch. A ranch herder was out on his own with camels when he came across a family of elephants. The matriarch charged at him and knocked him over with her trunk, breaking one of his legs. In the evening, when he did not return, a search party was sent in a truck to find him. When the party discovered him, he was being guarded by an elephant. The animal charged the truck, so they shot over her and scared her away. The herdsman later told them that when he could not stand up, the elephant used her trunk to lift him under the shade of a tree. She guarded him for the day and would gently touch him with her trunk. Self-medication Elephants in Africa self-medicate by chewing on the leaves of a tree from the family Boraginaceae, which induces labour. Kenyans also use this tree for the same purpose. Death ritual Scientists often debate the extent to which elephants feel emotion. Elephants have been one of few species of mammals other than Homo sapiens sapiens and Neanderthals known to have or have had any recognizable ritual around death. Elephants show a keen interest in the bones of their own kind (even unrelated elephants that have died long ago). They are often seen gently investigating the bones with their trunks and feet while remaining very quiet. Sometimes elephants that are completely unrelated to the deceased still visit their graves. Elephant researcher Martin Meredith recalls in his book an occurrence of a typical elephant death ritual as witnessed by Anthony Hall-Martin, a South African biologist who had studied elephants in Addo, South Africa, for over eight years. The entire family of a dead matriarch, including her young calf, were all gently touching her body with their trunks, trying to lift her. The elephant herd were all rumbling loudly. The calf was observed to be weeping and made sounds that sounded like a scream, but then the entire herd fell silent. They then began to throw leaves and dirt over the body and broke off tree branches to cover her. They spent the next two days quietly standing over her body. They sometimes left to get water or food, but they would always return. Occurrences of elephants behaving this way around human beings are common throughout Africa. On many occasions, they have buried dead or sleeping humans or aided them when they were hurt. Meredith also recalls an event told to him by George Adamson, a Kenyan game warden, regarding an old Turkana woman who fell asleep under a tree after losing her way home. When she woke up, there was an elephant standing over her, gently touching her. She kept very still because she was very frightened. As other elephants arrived, they began to scream loudly and buried her under branches. She was found the next morning by the local herdsmen, unharmed. George Adamson also recalls when he shot a bull elephant from a herd that kept breaking into the government gardens of northern Kenya. George gave the elephant's meat to local Turkana tribesmen and then dragged the rest of the carcass half a mile (800 m) away. That night, the other elephants found the body and took the shoulder blade and leg bone and returned the bones to the exact spot the elephant was killed. Play Joyce Poole on many occasions has observed wild African elephants at play. They apparently do things for their own and others' entertainment. Elephants have been seen sucking up water, holding their trunk high in the air, and then spraying the water like a fountain. Mimicry Recent studies have shown that elephants can also mimic sounds they hear. The discovery was found when Mlaika, an orphaned elephant, would copy the sound of trucks passing by. So far, the only other animals that are thought to mimic sounds are whales, dolphins, bats, primates and birds. Calimero, an African elephant who was 23 years old, also exhibited a unique form of mimicry. He was in a Swiss zoo with some Asian elephants. Asian elephants use chirps that are different from African elephants' deep rumbling noises. Calimero also began to chirp and not make the deep calls that his species normally would. Kosik, an Indian elephant at Everland Amusement Park, South Korea can imitate up to five Korean words, including sit, no, yes and lie down. Kosik produces these human-like sounds by putting his trunk in his mouth and then shaking it while breathing out, similar to how people whistle with their fingers. Elephants use contact calls to stay in touch with one another when they are out of one another's sight. Female elephants are able to remember and distinguish the contact calls of female family and bond group members from those of females outside of their extended family network. They can also distinguish between the calls of family units depending upon how frequently they came across them. Joyce Poole, of the Amboseli Elephant Research Project, Kenya, has demonstrated vocal learning and imitation in elephants of sounds made by each other and in the environment. She is beginning to research whether sounds made by elephants have dialects, a trait that is rare in the animal kingdom. Tool use Elephants show a remarkable ability to use tools, using their trunks like arms. Elephants have been observed digging holes to drink water and then ripping bark from a tree, chewing it into the shape of a ball, filling in the hole and covering over it with sand to avoid evaporation, then later going back to the spot for a drink. They also often use branches to swat flies or scratch themselves. Asian Elephants have also been known to drop very large rocks onto an electric fence either to ruin the fence or to cut off the electricity, thereby indicating that elephants know which fences are electric and not electric. Asian elephants in India have been known to break electric fences using logs and clear the surrounding wires using their tusks to provide a safe passageway. Art and music An elephant painting Like several other species that are able to produce abstract art, elephants using their trunks to hold brushes create paintings which some have compared to the work of abstract expressionists. Elephant art is now commonly featured at zoos, and is shown in museums and galleries around the world. Ruby at the Phoenix Zoo is considered the original elephant art star, and her paintings have sold for as much as $25,000. Ruby chose her own colors and was said to have a keen sense of which colour she wished to use. The Asian Elephant Art & Conservation Project, an \\"elephant art academy\\" in New York, teaches retired elephants to paint. For paintings that resemble identifiable objects, teachers give the elephants guidance. An example of this was shown in the TV program Extraordinary Animals, in which elephants at a camp in Thailand were able to draw portraits with flowers. Although the images were drawn by the elephants, there was always a trainer assisting and guiding the movement. A popular video showing an elephant painting a picture of another elephant became widespread on internet news and video websites. The website Snopes.com, which specializes in debunking urban legends, lists the video as \\"partly true\\", in that the elephant produced the brush strokes, but notes that the similarity of the produced paintings is indicative of a learned sequence of strokes rather than a creative effort on the part of the elephant. It was noted by ancient Romans and Asian elephant handlers (mahouts) that elephants can distinguish melodies. Performing circus elephants commonly follow musical cues and Adam Forepaugh and Barnum & Bailey circuses even featured \\"elephant bands\\". German evolutionary biologist Bernhard Rensch studied an elephant's ability to distinguish music, and in 1957 published the results in Scientific American. Rensch's test elephant could distinguish 12 tones in the music scale and could remember simple melodies. Even though played on varying instruments and at different pitches, timbres and meters, she recognized the tones a year and a half later. These results have been backed up by the Human-Elephant Learning Project which studies elephant intelligence. An elephant named Shanthi at the National Zoo in Washington D.C. has displayed the ability to play the harmonica and various horn instruments. She reportedly always ends her songs with a crescendo. Recording group Thai Elephant Orchestra is an ensemble of elephants who improvise music on specially made instruments with minimal interaction from their handlers. The orchestra was co-founded by pachyderm expert Richard Lair, who works at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, and David Sulzer (artist name, Dave Soldier) who studies the role of dopaminergic synapses in memory consolidation, learning, and behavior at Columbia University. According to neurobiologist Aniruddh Patel, the orchestra's star drummer named Pratidah, exhibits musicality, stating: \\"Either when drumming alone or with the orchestra, Pratidah was remarkably steady,\\". He also noted that she developed a swing-type rhythm pattern when playing with other elephants. Problem-solving ability Elephant stacking blocks to allow it to reach food Elephants are able to spend substantial time working on problems. They are able to change their behavior radically to face new challenges, a hallmark of complex intelligence.  Problem-solving experiments  A 2010 experiment revealed that in order to reach food, \\"elephants can learn to coordinate with a partner in a task requiring two individuals to simultaneously pull two ends of the same rope to obtain a reward\\", putting them on an equal footing with chimpanzees in terms of their level of cooperative skills. A study by Dr. Naoko Irie of Tokyo University has shown that elephants demonstrate skills at arithmetic. The experiment \\"consist[ed] of dropping varying numbers of apples into two buckets in front of the [Ueno Zoo] elephants and then recording how often they could correctly choose the bucket holding the most fruit.\\" When more than one apple was being dropped into the bucket, this meant that the elephants had to \\"keep running totals in their heads to keep track of the count.\\" The results showed that \\"Seventy-four percent of the time, the animals correctly picked the fullest bucket. An African elephant named Ashya scored the highest with an amazing eighty-seven percent ‚Ä¶ Humans in this same contest managed a success rate of just sixty-seven percent.\\" The study was also filmed to ensure its accuracy. A study on Discovery News found that elephants, during an intelligence test employing food rewards, had found shortcuts that not even the experiment's researchers had thought of.  Adaptive behavior in captivity  In the 1970s, at Marine World Africa, USA, there lived an Asian elephant named Bandula. Bandula worked out how to break open or unlock several of the pieces of equipment used to keep the shackles on her feet secure. The most complex device was a Brummel hook, a device that closes when two opposite points are slid together. Bandula used to fiddle with the hook until it slid apart when it was aligned. Once she had freed herself, she would help the other elephants escape. In Bandula's case and certainly with other captive elephants, there was an element of deception involved during the escapes, such as the animals looking around making sure no one was watching. In another case, a female elephant worked out how she could unscrew iron rods with an eye hole that was an inch (2.5 cm) thick. She used her trunk to create leverage and then untwisted the bolt. Ruby, an Asian elephant at Phoenix Zoo would often eavesdrop on conversations keepers would have talking about her. When she heard the word paint, she became very excitable. The colors she favored were green, yellow, blue and red. Once, a fire truck came and parked outside her enclosure where a man had just had a heart attack. The lights on the truck were flashing red, white and yellow. When Ruby painted later on in the day, she chose those colors. She also showed a preference for colors that the keepers wore. Harry Peachey, an elephant trainer, developed a cooperative relationship with an elephant named Koko. Koko would help the keepers out, \\"prompting\\" them to encourage him with various commands and words that Koko would learn. Peachey stated that elephants are almost predisposed to cooperate and work with humans as long as they are treated with respect and sensitivity. Koko worked out when his keepers needed a bit of \\"elephant help\\" when they were transferring the females of the group to another zoo. When the keepers wanted to transfer a female, they would usually say her name, followed by the word transfer (e.g., \\"Connie transfer\\"). Koko soon figured out what this meant. If the keepers asked an elephant to transfer and it did not budge, they would say, \\"Koko, give me a hand.\\" When he heard this, Koko would help. After 27 years of working with elephants, Peachey firmly believes that they can understand the semantics and syntax of some of the words they hear. This is something thought to be very rare in the animal kingdom. According to one source, elephants can figure out how to retrieve distant objects that they cannot otherwise reach by using a stick.  Adaptive behavior in the wild  In the wild, elephants display clever methods of finding resources. Elephants have keen memories, and when evaluating foraging locations, respond more strongly to long‚Äêterm patterns of productivity than to immediate forage conditions. In times of scarcity, they return to areas which have been reliable over many years rather than the last sites visited. They also favor travelling on dirt roads in the dry season, as easy walking terrain to conserve energy. Although it is common for herbivores to find salt licks or to ingest inorganic matter for sodium, elephants in the Mount Elgon National Park, Kenya, have learned to venture deep into Kitum Cave to utilize its minerals in what has been described as 'quarrying' and 'salt mining'. Although the elephants clearly do not understand that they require salt in their diet, they show interest only in the cation-rich zeolite, tusking it into smaller edible fragments. This activity is performed in groups, and years of tusk marks indicate the knowledge of the cave has been passed down over generations. Poaching has caused the elephants to alter their behavior and avoid the more widely known caves.  Applying the string-drawing task to elephants  In 1956, W. H. Thorpe explained: > \\"The ability to pull up food which is suspended by a thread, the pulled in > loop being held by the foot while the bird reaches with its beak for the > next pull, is doubtfully inborn and it has been subject to many experiments. > The act appears at first sight to be a real and sudden solution of the > problem from the start, and thus to qualify for inclusion under 'insight > learning.' Successful performance in this task has been documented in well > over ten bird species.\\" More recently, Bernd Heinrich and Thomas Bugnyar concluded that ravens' \\"behaviour in accessing meat on a string is not only a product of rapid learning but may involve some understanding of cause‚Äìeffect relation between string, food and certain body parts.\\" String-pulling behavior has been likewise studied in seven Asian elephants by presenting them with a retractable (bungee) cord. In this setup, the cord is tied to a heavy log a few meters away from the elephant. A sugarcane (a favorite elephant treat) is attached to the cord, and can only be retrieved by repeated, coordinated, action of the trunk and another body part. The results were clearcut: > \\"All seven logging elephants fully mastered the string-drawing sequence > within 1-3 experimental sessions. In all cases of retractable rope pulling, > the sequence involved pulling by the trunk, and then securing the rope by > either foot or mouth. After 2-6 coordinated pulls, while still holding the > rope with either mouth or foot, the elephants disengaged the sugarcane from > the rope while still using mouth or forefoot as an anchor, and then consumed > the sugarcane. All elephants seemed to be flexible about the use of anchor, > interchangeably using mouth, foreleg, or both.\\" Self-awareness Elephants have joined a small group of animals, including great apes, bottlenose dolphins and eurasian magpies, that exhibit self- awareness. The study was conducted with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) using elephants at the Bronx Zoo in New York. Although many animals respond to a mirror, very few show any evidence that they recognize it is in fact themselves in the mirror reflection. The Asian elephants in the study also displayed this type of behavior when standing in front of a mirror - they inspected the rear and brought food close to the mirror for consumption. Evidence of elephant self-awareness was shown when the elephant Happy repeatedly touched a painted X on her head with her trunk, a mark which could only be seen in the mirror. Happy ignored another mark made with colorless paint that was also on her forehead to ensure she was not merely reacting to a smell or feeling. Frans De Waal, who ran the study, stated, \\"These parallels between humans and elephants suggest a convergent cognitive evolution possibly related to complex society and cooperation.\\" Self-awareness and culling There has been considerable debate over the issue of culling African elephants in South Africa's Kruger National Park as a means of controlling the population. Some scientists and environmentalists argue that it is \\"unnecessary and inhumane\\" to cull them since \\"elephants resemble humans in a number of ways, not least by having massive brains, social bonds that appear to be empathetic, long gestations, high intelligence, offspring that require an extended period of dependent care, and long life spans.\\" A South African Animal Rights group asked in a statement anticipating the announcement, \\"How much like us do elephants have to be before killing them becomes murder?\\" Others argue that culling is necessary when biodiversity is threatened. However, the protection of biodiversity argument has been questioned by some animal rights advocates who argue that the animal which most greatly threatens and damages biodiversity is humanity, so if we are not willing to cull our own species we cannot morally justify culling another.Brown, Les. 1988. Cruelty to Animals: The Moral Debt.Clarke, Paul A.B. and Andrew Linzey (eds.). 1990. Political Theory and Animal Rights. Winchester, MA: Pluto Press.  Arguments against intelligence  This section summarizes experiments that cannot be readily reconciled with the view that elephants are highly intelligent. These experiments, in turn, rely on pioneering early work with dogs and cats.  Discrimination tasks  Edward Thorndike argued that his cats and dogs escaped puzzle boxes through a mindless process of trial and error. Because understanding something as simple as pulling a loop to open a door must occur rapidly or not at all, it should have induced, at some point during the repeated introductions of his animals into the box, a sudden reduction in escape time. The actual, gradual, slope of the time-curve that he did observe suggested to him that his subjects failed to understand the cause-effect relationships between their actions and escape. In 1957, researchers reported that a young Asian elephant needed 330 trials, over a period of several days, to consistently choose the reinforced response in her first discrimination task. In an experiment which employed another sense modality, an 8-year-old took 7.5 months to distinguish 12 tones. Similarly, in discrimination experiments with Asian elephants in the logging camps of Myanmar, only 13 Burmese elephants mastered black/white or large/small visual discrimination tasks, while 7 elephants failed to master the task. Like Thorndike's cats and dogs, the 13 elephants that did master a black/white or large/small discrimination task did so gradually, over several sessions. The slope of the time-curve again suggested the elephants failed to understand the cause-effect relationships between lid removal and food retrieval. The pre-training that preceded these Myanmar discrimination experiments involved learning to remove a lid from a bucket or to displace a box to uncover a hole in the ground. On average, the 20 elephants required 3.4 sessions to master the pre-training task.  Possible absence of causal reasoning  Thorndike's dogs and cats learned to escape a box by, for instance, pulling a loop attached to a string that opened the box. On subsequent introductions to an open box when string- pulling no longer served a purpose, the animal continued to pull a string before getting out of the box. Thorndike concluded that the animal solved the task mechanically, without understanding the causal link between string- pulling and escaping. A conceptually similar experiment involved pre-training four logging Asian elephants to remove food from a cover-less bucket by inserting their trunk into the bucket. Next, a treat was placed at the bottom of a bucket and, at the same time, the bucket was covered with a lid. The elephants were then trained to obtain the treat by removing the lid. Once this behavioral sequence was established, a treat was placed inside the bucket and, at the same time, the lid was placed on the ground alongside the bucket, so that the lid no longer obstructed access to the food. As in the Thorndike case, if the elephants understand the nature of the task, they should ignore the lid on the ground and retrieve the reward directly, as they used to do in pre-training sessions before the lid was introduced. But if they fail to understand the causal link between lid removal and food retrieval, they might continue to remove the lid before retrieving the food. The observations supported Thorndike's mechanical learning hypothesis.

It was named after the town Paddock Wood in Kent, England. In the early 1900s Mr. Fred Pitts emigrated to the lumberland of Canada. From a log cabin he built there as a home, he set up a post office, collecting letters and parcels on horseback for residents of the settlement. He named the settlement Paddockwood after the village he had left in England. Paddockwood was the home of the first Red Cross hospital in the British Empire, and was set up after the First World War. Paddockwood is served by the Paddockwood Public Library as well as a nine-hole golf course, the Helbig's Forest Course. Paddockwood belongs to the Saskatchewan Provincial Constituency of Saskatchewan Rivers and the Federal Electoral District of Prince Albert.

Reprimanding takes in different forms in different legal systems. A reprimand in custody may be a formal legal action issued by a government agency or professional governing board (e.g. medical board, bar council). It may also be an administrative warning issued by an employer or school.  United Kingdom  From 1998 until 2013 in the UK, young people aged 10‚Äì17 years old could receive a reprimand (provided they had not previously been given a reprimand, a final warning or been found guilty at court). A reprimand was a formal verbal warning given by a police officer to a young person who admitted they are guilty of a 'minor' first offence. The police passed on the details to the local Youth Offending Team of those young people given a reprimand. Sometimes the young person would be referred to the YOT to take part in a voluntary programme to help them address their offending behaviour.

D. Caspar (born January 8, 1927) is an American structural biologist (the very term he coined) known for his works on the structures of biological molecules, particularly of the tobacco mosaic virus. He is an emeritus professor of biological science at the Institute of Molecular Biophysics, Florida State University, and an emeritus professor of biology at the Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, Brandeis University. He has made significant scientific contributions in virus biology, X-ray, neutron and electron diffraction, and protein plasticity. Caspar completed his BA in physics from Cornell University in 1950. He joined Yale University from where he earned his PhD in biophysics in 1955. He was supervised by Ernest C. Pollard. His thesis was on the structure of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) titled The Radial Structure of Tobacco Mosaic Virus. While waiting for his degree he worked under Max Delbr√ºck at the California Institute of Technology as post doctoral student. He worked with James D. Watson, with whom he had close professional association throughout his career. After receiving his PhD, he went to England having been awarded a fellowship at King's College London under Rosalind Franklin and during 1955‚Äì1956 worked with her at Birkbeck College in London. Their meeting was fruitful both personally and professionally. He remained one of Franklin's closest friends during her brief lifetime. In 1956 he and Franklin published individual but complementary papers in the March 10 issue of Nature, together showing that TMV was a hollow rod, rather than a solid structure as generally believed. They also demonstrated that RNA in TMV was wound along the inner surface of the hollow virus. He was not a particularly enthusiastic writer; as a result, Franklin had to write every word of his paper. At Birkbeck one of his colleagues was Aaron Klug with whom he developed research collaborations throughout his career. In 1962, they introduced the concept of quasi-equivalence to account for the arrangement of proteins on the surface of icosahedral virus particles. Caspar-Klug theory has played an important part in shaping the subsequent study of viruses and other macromolecular assemblies. The original concept was based mainly on electron microscope studies, and has now been refined to take account of the atomic resolution structure of viruses, and other details of protein‚Äìprotein interactions that crystallography has elucidated. Quasi- equivalence continues to be an important component of the philosophical basis for how we think about macromolecular assemblies. In 1994 Caspar received the Guggenheim Fellowships. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences. He is an elected member of the Biophysics and Computational Biology section of the National Academy of Sciences since 1994. He received the first Fellow of the Biophysical Society Award in 2000.

History The gun was designed during the First World War by Colonel Louis Filloux to meet an urgent need for modern heavy artillery and became the standard heavy field gun of the French Army from 1917 until the Second World War. It was also adopted by the United States as the M1917 and a close derivative of it was made in and used by the US as the M1918 through the Second World War. The gun was also manufactured in the United States from 1917, after the US switched to metric artillery based on French patterns. It was used by the United States Army and United States Marine Corps as their primary heavy gun as the 155 mm Gun M1917 (French-made) or M1918 (US-made) until 1942, when it was gradually replaced by the 155 mm M1A1 Long Tom. US Army forces in the Far East (USAFFE), including the 301st FA Regiment (Philippine Army), the 86th FA Regiment (Philippine Scouts) and also US Coast Artillery units (91st and 92nd CA Regiments, Philippine Scouts), used this gun against the Japanese in the Philippines Campaign (1941‚Äì42). Some of the guns were originally emplaced in \\"Panama mounts\\" on Corregidor, Caballo and Carabao islands at the entrance of Manila Bay. Some guns were dismounted and used as roving batteries and gave effective counter-battery fire. The gun was later mounted on the M12 Gun Motor Carriage and saw action in 1944‚Äì45. During the Second World War, some US-made guns were used for coast defense of US and Allied territories, such as Australia and Bermuda, typically on \\"Panama\\" mountings - circular concrete platforms with a raised centre section, with the carriage tires pivoting around the center section and the split trails spread out on rails at the edge of the platform. Grande Puissance Filloux (GPF) This gun was designed by Colonel L. J. F. Filloux to fill a vital French Army requirement for a heavy artillery piece. The design proved a success and became the standard heavy field gun of the French from 1917 to the end of World War I. The weapon was pressed into service quickly, to remedy the shortage of such weapons in the French inventory. This weapon became the \\"Canon de 155 Grande Puissance Filloux mle 1917\\", named by French Army as the Canon de 155mm GPF (Model of 1917). During the First World War, the gun was eventually taken on by the American Expeditionary Force as a standard long- range artillery piece. At the beginning of the Second World War the French guns were taken out of storage and 24 of these guns were operational in May‚ÄìJune 1940. M1918 155 mm GPF The US M1918 155 mm GPF was a copy of the French 1917 field gun and used by the US Army, Philippines and US Marines up to 1945. The United States Army paid for and subsequently copied, the Model 1918 (M1918) gun. During the Second World War the 155 mm guns were taken out of storage and used for coast defense on American shores and in Allied territories such as the Philippines and Australia. They were also used in the Philippines, Guadalcanal and North Africa until more modern artillery was available. Ultimately, both the US Army and Marine Corps phased out their M1918 guns for the 155 mm M1A1 \\"Long Tom\\" beginning in 1942. The M1918 was also fitted to the M12 Gun Motor Carriage as a self-propelled gun (SPG) and used from 1944 to 1945. 15.5 cm K 418(f) In 1940, France fielded 450 of these guns.Crawford, Steve; Chant, Chris. Artillery of World War II. p.11 Many of them were captured and used by Germany for the rest of the war. In German service it was known as the 15.5 cm K 418(f); it served with heavy artillery battalions in the Afrika Korps and on coast defense duties. On D-Day in 1944, the German Army had over 50 of the 155 mm French guns in sites on the northern French beaches. A battery of six of these guns near four empty emplacements for larger guns was the cause of the actions at Pointe du Hoc in June 1944. Surviving examples Many of these weapons survive as memorials.

The avifauna of Barbados included a total of 271 species, according to Bird Checklists of the World as of July 2020. Of them, one is endemic, 14 have been introduced by humans, and 183 are rare or accidental. Eight species have been extirpated and one is probably extinct. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories of occurrence. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Barbados * (E) Endemic - a species endemic to Barbados * (I) Introduced - a species introduced by humans either directly to Barbados or elsewhere in the New World * (Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in Barbados although populations exist elsewhere Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating. *White-faced whistling-duck, Dendrocygna viduata (A) *Black-bellied whistling-duck, Dendrocygna autumnalis *West Indian whistling-duck, Dendrocygna arborea (A) *Fulvous whistling-duck, Dendrocygna bicolor *Brant, Branta bernicla (A) *Orinoco goose, Neochen jubata (A) *Common shelduck, Tadorna tadorna (A) *Muscovy duck, Cairina moschata *Wood duck, Aix sponsa (I) *Garganey, Spatula querquedula (A) *Blue-winged teal, Spatula discors *Northern shoveler, Spatula clypeata (A) *Eurasian wigeon, Mareca penelope (A) *American wigeon, Mareca americana (A) *Mallard, Anas platyrhynchos (I) *White-cheeked pintail, Anas bahamensis (A) *Northern pintail, Anas acuta (A) *Green-winged teal, Anas crecca (A) *Common pochard, Aythya ferina (A) *Ring- necked duck, Aythya collaris (A) *Tufted duck, Aythya fuligula (A) *Greater scaup, Aythya marila (A) *Lesser scaup, Aythya affinis (A) *Hooded merganser, Lophodytes cucullatus (A) *Masked duck, Nomonyx dominicus *Ruddy duck, Oxyura jamaicensis (I) New World quail Order: GalliformesFamily: Odontophoridae The New World quails are small, plump terrestrial birds only distantly related to the quails of the Old World, but named for their similar appearance and habits. *Northern bobwhite, Colinus virginianus (I) (Ex) Pheasants, grouse, and allies Order: GalliformesFamily: Phasianidae The Phasianidae are a family of terrestrial birds which consists of quails, partridges, snowcocks, francolins, spurfowls, tragopans, monals, pheasants, peafowls, and jungle fowls. In general, they are plump (although they vary in size) and have broad, relatively short wings. *Red junglefowl, Gallus gallus (I) Flamingos Order: PhoenicopteriformesFamily: Phoenicopteridae Flamingos are gregarious wading birds, usually tall, found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae. Their oddly shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume and, uniquely, are used upside-down. *American flamingo, Phoenicopterus ruber (A) Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. *Pied-billed grebe, Podilymbus podiceps Pigeons and doves Order: ColumbiformesFamily: Columbidae Pigeons and doves are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy cere. *Rock pigeon, Columba livia (I) *Scaly-naped pigeon, Patagioenas squamosa *White-crowned pigeon, Patagioenas leucocephala (A) *Eurasian collared-dove, Streptopelia decaocto (I) *Common ground dove, Columbina passerina *White-winged dove, Zenaida asiatica (A) *Zenaida dove, Zenaida aurita *Eared dove, Zenaida auriculata Cuckoos Order: CuculiformesFamily: Cuculidae The family Cuculidae includes cuckoos, roadrunners, and anis. These birds are of variable size with slender bodies, long tails, and strong legs. The Old World cuckoos are brood parasites. *Greater ani, Crotophaga major (A) *Smooth-billed ani, Crotophaga ani (A) *Common cuckoo, Cuculus canorus (A) *Yellow-billed cuckoo, Coccyzus americanus (A) *Mangrove cuckoo, Coccyzus minor *Black-billed cuckoo, Coccyzus erythropthalmus (A) Nightjars and allies Order: CaprimulgiformesFamily: Caprimulgidae Nightjars are medium-sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs, and very short bills. Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is camouflaged to resemble bark or leaves. *Common nighthawk, Chordeiles minor *Antillean nighthawk, Chordeiles gundlachii (A) Swifts Order: ApodiformesFamily: Apodidae Swifts are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang. *Black swift, Cypseloides niger *White-collared swift, Streptoprocne zonaris (A) *Chimney swift, Chaetura pelagica *Short-tailed swift, Chaetura brachyura (A) *Alpine swift, Tachymarptis melba (A) Hummingbirds Order: ApodiformesFamily: Trochilidae Hummingbirds are small birds capable of hovering in mid-air due to the rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backwards. *Purple-throated carib, Eulampis jugularis (A) *Green-throated carib, Eulampis holosericeus *Antillean crested hummingbird, Orthorhyncus cristatus Rails, gallinules, and coots Order: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots, and gallinules. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers. *Sora, Porzana carolina *Common gallinule, Gallinula galeata *American coot, Fulica americana *Purple gallinule, Porphyrio martinica (A) Thick-knees Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Burhinidae The thick-knees are a group of waders found worldwide within the tropical zone, with some species also breeding in temperate Europe and Australia. They are medium to large waders with strong black or yellow-black bills, large yellow eyes and cryptic plumage. Despite being classed as waders, most species have a preference for arid or semi-arid habitats. *Double-striped thick-knee, Burhinus bistriatus (A) Stilts and avocets Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Recurvirostridae Recurvirostridae is a family of large wading birds which includes the avocets and stilts. The avocets have long legs and long up-curved bills. The stilts have extremely long legs and long, thin, straight bills. *Black-necked stilt, Himantopus mexicanus (A) *American avocet, Recurvirostra americana (A) Oystercatchers Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Haematopodidae The oystercatchers are large and noisy plover-like birds, with strong bills used for smashing or prising open molluscs. *American oystercatcher, Haematopus palliatus (A) Plovers and lapwings Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Charadriidae The family Charadriidae includes the plovers, dotterels, and lapwings. They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short thick necks, and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water. *Northern lapwing, Vanellus vanellus (A) *Southern lapwing, Vanellus chilensis *Black-bellied plover, Pluvialis squatarola *American golden-plover, Pluvialis dominica *Pacific golden-plover, Pluvialis fulva (A) *Killdeer, Charadrius vociferus (A) *Common ringed plover, Charadrius hiaticula (A) *Semipalmated plover, Charadrius semipalmatus *Piping plover, Charadrius melodus (A) *Wilson's plover, Charadrius wilsonia (A) *Collared plover, Charadrius collaris (A) *Snowy plover, Charadrius nivosus (A) Sandpipers and allies Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Scolopacidae Scolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the sandpipers, curlews, godwits, shanks, tattlers, woodcocks, snipes, dowitchers, and phalaropes. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Variation in length of legs and bills enables multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food. *Upland sandpiper, Bartramia longicauda (A) *Whimbrel, Numenius phaeopus (A) *Eskimo curlew, Numenius borealis (A) (probably extinct) *Long-billed curlew, Numenius americanus (A) *Hudsonian godwit, Limosa haemastica (A) *Marbled godwit, Limosa fedoa (A) *Ruddy turnstone, Arenaria interpres *Red knot, Calidris canutus *Ruff, Calidris pugnax (A) *Stilt sandpiper, Calidris himantopus (A) *Curlew sandpiper, Calidris ferruginea (A) *Sanderling, Calidris alba *Dunlin, Calidris alpina (A) *Baird's sandpiper, Calidris bairdii (A) *Little stint, Calidris minuta (A) *Least sandpiper, Calidris minutilla *White-rumped sandpiper, Calidris fuscicollis (A) *Buff- breasted sandpiper, Calidris subruficollis (A) *Pectoral sandpiper, Calidris melanotos *Semipalmated sandpiper, Calidris pusilla *Western sandpiper, Calidris mauri *Short-billed dowitcher, Limnodromus griseus *Long-billed dowitcher, Limnodromus scolopaceus (A) *Jack snipe, Lymnocryptes minimus (A) *Wilson's snipe, Gallinago delicata (A) *Terek sandpiper, Xenus cinereus (A) *Spotted sandpiper, Actitis macularius *Solitary sandpiper, Tringa solitaria (A) *Lesser yellowlegs, Tringa flavipes *Willet, Tringa semipalmata (A) *Spotted redshank, Tringa erythropus (A) *Common greenshank, Tringa nebularia (A) *Greater yellowlegs, Tringa melanoleuca *Wood sandpiper, Tringa glareola (A) *Wilson's phalarope, Phalaropus tricolor (A) Pratincoles and coursers Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Glareolidae The pratincoles have short legs, very long pointed wings, and long forked tails. Their most unusual feature for birds classed as waders is that they typically hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground. Their short bills are an adaptation to aerial feeding. Their flight is fast and graceful like a swallow or a tern, with many twists and turns to pursue their prey. *Collared pratincole, Glareola pratincola (A) Skuas and jaegers Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Stercorariidae The family Stercorariidae are, in general, medium to large birds, typically with grey or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. They nest on the ground in temperate and arctic regions and are long-distance migrants. *Great skua, Stercorarius skua (A) *South polar skua, Stercorarius maccormicki (A) *Pomarine jaeger, Stercorarius pomarinus (A) *Parasitic jaeger, Stercorarius parasiticus (A) Gulls, terns, and skimmers Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Laridae Laridae is a family of medium to large seabirds and includes gulls, kittiwakes, terns and skimmers. They are typically grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. *Black-legged kittiwake, Rissa tridactyla (A) *Bonaparte's gull, Chroicocephalus philadelphia (A) *Gray-hooded gull, Chroicocephalus cirrocephalus (A) *Black-headed gull, Chroicocephalus ridibundus (A) *Little gull, Hydrocoloeus minutus (A) *Laughing gull, Leucophaeus atricilla *Franklin's gull, Leucophaeus pipixcan (A) *Ring-billed gull, Larus delawarensis (A) *Herring gull, Larus argentatus (A) *Yellow-legged gull, Larus michahellis (A) *Lesser black-backed gull, Larus fuscus (A) *Glaucous gull, Larus hyperboreus (A) *Great black-backed gull, Larus marinus (A) *Kelp gull, Larus dominicanus (A) *Brown noddy, Anous stolidus (A) *Black noddy, Anous minutus (A) *Sooty tern, Onychoprion fuscata *Bridled tern, Onychoprion anaethetus *Least tern, Sternula antillarum (A) *Gull-billed tern, Gelochelidon nilotica (A) *Caspian tern, Hydroprogne caspia (A) *Black tern, Chlidonias niger (A) *White-winged tern, Chlidonias leucopterus (A) *Whiskered tern, Chlidonias hybridus (A) *Roseate tern, Sterna dougallii (A) *Common tern, Sterna hirundo (A) *Arctic tern, Sterna paradisaea (A) *Royal tern, Thalasseus maxima *Sandwich tern, Thalasseus sandvicensis (A) *Black skimmer, Rynchops niger (A) Tropicbirds Order: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings. *White-tailed tropicbird, Phaethon lepturus (A) *Red-billed tropicbird, Phaethon aethereus Southern storm-petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The storm-petrels are the smallest seabirds, relatives of the petrels, feeding on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. Until 2018, this family's species were included with the other storm-petrels in family Hydrobatidae. *Wilson's storm- petrel, Oceanites oceanicus (A) Northern storm-petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae Though the members of this family are similar in many respects to the southern storm-petrels, including their general appearance and habits, there are enough genetic differences to warrant their placement in a separate family. *Leach's storm-petrel, Oceanodroma leucorhoa (A) Shearwaters and petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Black-capped petrel, Pterodroma hasitata (A) *Cory's shearwater, Calonectris diomedea (A) *Great shearwater, Ardenna gravis (A) *Sooty shearwater, Ardenna griseus (A) *Manx shearwater, Puffinus puffinus (A) *Audubon's shearwater, Puffinus lherminieri Frigatebirds Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black and white, or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. *Magnificent frigatebird, Fregata magnificens Boobies and gannets Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. *Masked booby, Sula dactylatra (A) *Brown booby, Sula leucogaster (A) *Red-footed booby, Sula sula (A) Anhingas Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Anhingas are often called \\"snake-birds\\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape, and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. *Anhinga, Anhinga anhinga Pelicans Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae Pelicans are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. As with other members of the order Pelecaniformes, they have webbed feet with four toes. *Brown pelican, Pelecanus occidentalis (A) Herons, egrets, and bitterns Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons, and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills. *American bittern, Botaurus lentiginosus (A) *Little bittern, Ixobrychus minutus (A) *Least bittern, Ixobrychus exilis (A) *Great blue heron, Ardea herodias *Gray heron, Ardea cinerea (A) *Purple heron, Ardea purpurea (A) *Great egret, Ardea alba *Little egret, Egretta garzetta *Western reef-heron, Egretta gularis (A) *Snowy egret, Egretta thula *Little blue heron, Egretta caerulea *Tricolored heron, Egretta tricolor (A) *Cattle egret, Bubulcus ibis *Green heron, Butorides virescens *Striated heron, Butorides striata (A) *Black-crowned night-heron, Nycticorax nycticorax *Yellow-crowned night-heron, Nyctanassa violacea (A) Ibises and spoonbills Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Threskiornithidae Threskiornithidae is a family of large terrestrial and wading birds which includes the ibises and spoonbills. They have long, broad wings with 11 primary and about 20 secondary feathers. They are strong fliers and despite their size and weight, very capable soarers. *White ibis, Eudocimus albus (A) *Glossy ibis, Plegadis falcinellus (A) *Eurasian spoonbill, Platalea leucorodia (A) Osprey Order: AccipitriformesFamily: Pandionidae The family Pandionidae contains only one species, the osprey. The osprey is a medium-large raptor which is a specialist fish-eater with a worldwide distribution. *Osprey, Pandion haliaetus Hawks, eagles, and kites Order: AccipitriformesFamily: Accipitridae Accipitridae is a family of birds of prey, which includes hawks, eagles, kites, harriers, and Old World vultures. These birds have powerful hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons, and keen eyesight. *Northern harrier, Circus hudsonius (A) *Eurasian marsh-harrier, Circus aeruginosus (A) *Black kite, Milvus migrans (A) *Broad-winged hawk, Buteo platypterus *Red- tailed hawk, Buteo jamaicensis (Ex) Owls Order: StrigiformesFamily: Strigidae The typical owls are small to large solitary nocturnal birds of prey. They have large forward-facing eyes and ears, a hawk-like beak, and a conspicuous circle of feathers around each eye called a facial disk. *Short- eared owl, Asio flammeus (A) Kingfishers Order: CoraciiformesFamily: Alcedinidae Kingfishers are medium-sized birds with large heads, long pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails. *Ringed kingfisher, Megaceryle torquata (A) *Belted kingfisher, Megaceryle alcyon Falcons and caracaras Order: FalconiformesFamily: Falconidae Falconidae is a family of diurnal birds of prey. They differ from hawks, eagles, and kites in that they kill with their beaks instead of their talons. *American kestrel, Falco sparverius (A) *Merlin, Falco columbarius *Bat falcon, Falco rufigularis (A) *Peregrine falcon, Falco peregrinus New World and African parrots Order: PsittaciformesFamily: Psittacidae Parrots are small to large birds with a characteristic curved beak. Their upper mandibles have slight mobility in the joint with the skull and they have a generally erect stance. All parrots are zygodactyl, having the four toes on each foot placed two at the front and two to the back. *Green-rumped parrotlet, Forpus passerinus (I) (Ex) Old World parrots Order: PsittaciformesFamily: Psittaculidae Characteristic features of parrots include a strong curved bill, an upright stance, strong legs, and clawed zygodactyl feet. Many parrots are vividly coloured, and some are multi- coloured. Old World parrots are found from Africa east across south and southeast Asia and Oceania to Australia and New Zealand. *Budgerigar, Melopsittacus undulatus (I) (Ex) Tyrant flycatchers Order: PasseriformesFamily: Tyrannidae Tyrant flycatchers are passerine birds which occur throughout North and South America.

This is a list of the bird species recorded in Grenada. The avifauna of Grenada included a total of 184 species according to Bird Checklists of the World as of August 2020. Of them, one is endemic, six have been introduced by humans, and 116 are rare or accidental. One species on the list has been extirpated and one is probably extinct. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories of occurrence. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Grenada * (E) Endemic - a species endemic to Grenada * (I) Introduced - a species introduced by humans either directly to Grenada or elsewhere in the New World * (Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in Grenada although populations exist elsewhere Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

Wendela Hebbe (9 September 1808, J√∂nk√∂ping ‚Äì 27 August 1899, Stockholm), was a Swedish journalist, writer, and salon hostess. She was arguably the first permanently employed female journalist at a Swedish newspaper.Berger, Margareta, Pennskaft: kvinnliga journalister i svensk dagspress 1690-1975 [Penholders: Female journalists in Swedish press 1690-1975], Norstedt, Stockholm, 1977 She had a significant place in the radical literary circles of mid 19th-century Sweden and a controversial role model for the emancipated woman.  Early life  Wendela Hebbe was the eldest of three daughters of the parish vicar Anders Samuel √Östrand and Maria Lund. Her father was literary and culturally interested and raised his daughters in the same fashion, and as a child, she was encouraged to read and explore music, art and literature. She was described as talented within music and literature and nicknamed \\"Fr√∂ken Fr√•gvis\\" (\\"Miss Inquisitive\\"). Esaias Tegn√©r was an acquaintance of her father and a common guest in their home. Reportedly, he courted her unsuccessfully from an early age and also after her marriage, and dedicated many of his poems to her. She refused him and offered him friendship, a line she upheld. In 1832, she married the lawyer and writer Clemens Hebbe (1804-1893), with whom she had three daughters. In 1839, her spouse went bankrupt and fled the country: first to England, he eventually emigrated to the United States, and Wendela Hebbe was left to support herself and her daughters alone. She settled in J√∂nk√∂ping, and started to work in the only profession regarded socially acceptable for an educated woman at the time: she became a teacher and gave lessons in music, singing and drawing, which was only barely enough to support herself. Career as a journalist In 1841, her first novel, Arabella, was published by Lars Johan Hierta, the chief editor of the radical newspaper Aftonbladet, and the same year, she was employed at Aftonbladet (she was given a permanent position in 1844). Wendela Hebbe is generally referred to as the first female journalist in Sweden. Women wrote articles and edited papers in the Swedish press at least since Margareta Momma in 1738, most of whom unidentified as they wrote under anonymous pseudonyms, but Wendela Hebbe was likely the first woman reporter to be given a permanent position at a Swedish newspaper and was in that sense a pioneer of her profession: it was not until the 19th-century that the Swedish press employed permanent staff, and Wendela Hebbe is the first woman found in the staff register of any Swedish paper. She is listed in the staff register of Aftonbladet in between 1844 and 1851, followed by Marie Sophie Schwartz at Svenska Tidningen Dagligt Allehanda in 1851-1859. Hebbe was made translator and editor of the culture section responsible for the coverage of culture, music and literature. She reviewed literature and novels, concerts, opera performances and theater plays, and managed the serials section. She is known to have used her section to promote debuting authors by publishing their novels as serials. Outside of her cultural activity, she was also active as a social reporter, and was in fact likely to have been the first reporter in Sweden to introduce social reportage in Sweden. Wendela Hebbe shared the liberal and humanitarian views of Aftonbladet at the time. Because of her sex she was considered suitable for \\"soft questions\\" such as the social misery among the poor, and she gained considerable attention with her first social reportage Biskopens bes√∂k (Visit from the Bishop) in 1843, a piece which contributed to the social debate that had begun around class- differences in Sweden around this time. By her reportage of social injustice, she managed on several occasions to draw the attention to areas in need of reform and assist people in need of help. Literary career Wendela Hebbe retired as a journalist in 1851 to focus on a career as a novelist. Her debut novel Arabella was a conventional love novel, but her later novels are written in a more realistic style. Her novels focus on the intrigue as such rather than at the characters, and are strongly associated with her own time. She included social critic as a message in her novels, and were reportedly inspired by Dickens and British 18th-century literature. Her novel Brudarne has been described as her most notable and referred to as the first \\"novel for girls\\" in Sweden. As a novelist she has been regarded as talented but not original, and never had more than moderate success. She was more successful as a writer of songs and poems for children and teenagers. Her children's poems were influenced by her own idyllic childhood in Sm√•land and depicted children's games, children's rhymes and traditional folklore. Especially her fairy tales about animals was much admired by Bj Bj√∂rnson and S H Grundtvig. Among her songs, the compositions H√∂gt deruppe mellan fj√§llen (High up between the mountaintops) and Linnean (Linnea) became very popular. Outside of her personal production, she made a valuable historical contribution by writing down old traditional folk lore stories and songs. Private life Hebbe had a long term relationship with Lars Johan Hierta. This was common knowledge and lead to caricatures in the press and rumors that she had been given her position as a result of nepotism. Hebbe and Hierta could not marry each other, as they were both married: her own marriage to her exiled spouse was not dissolved until 1864. Wendela Hebbe and Lars Johan Hierta had a son together, Edvard, in 1852. Even a woman as independent as Hebbe did not wish to acknowledge that she had an extramarital child. Edvard was born in secrecy during a trip to France: Hebbe never acknowledged him, but he was periodically a foster son of Hierta under an assumed name, and also visited Hebbe from time to time, until he was given a permanent home in Germany. Her son later became the father of the artist Mollie Faustman. Wendela Hebbe was a central figure in the radical elite in Stockholm particularly during the 1840s and 1850s, and hosted a literary and musical salon which became a center for the liberal literary and artistic world, who gathered to recite, play music and discuss. To her circle of belonged Johan Jolin, Gunnar Olof Hylt√©n-Cavallius and also Magnus Jacob Crusenstolpe, whom she supported in his struggle for freedom of speech. A particular friendship was that of Carl Jonas Love Almquist, whose work as a writer she admired, as they shared an interest in social criticism. She also reportedly played an important part as an adviser and secretary in the creation of the compositions of Almquist, notably his Songes, according to her daughter Signe Hebbe, who remembered her mother and Almquist sitting by the piano during his compositions: \\"In the early 40s, when many of A[lmquist]:s songs were completed, Almqvist demonstrated by a finger on the musical keyboard what tone he desired. It was also H who with her beautiful warm voice presented the new creations to the circle of friends\\". Almqvist celebrated her with the piano composition ¬ªVendelas m√∂rka lockar¬ª (the dark curls of Vendela). According to Signe Hebbe, her mother and Almqvist never had a romantic relationship, but remaining correspondence and behavior of Almqvist suggest that they were very likely more than friends Wendela Hebbe demonstrated her loyal support for Carl Jonas Love Almquist during the scandal of 1851. Her salon was an important part of Stockholm literary life and was regarded as a vital destination for a writer visiting Stockholm: Johan Ludvig Runeberg did so during his short visit in 1851. Her home continued to be a meeting place for decades, even after an illness left her unable to walk in 1878, and she was later to be acquainted with Ellen Key and Herman S√§therberg, whose poems she composed music to. She also accompanied her daughter, the famous opera singer Signe Hebbe, on her European tours. Wendela Hebbe was never to be famed as writer, but she played a great part as a salon hostess, and though she was herself never involved in the work for women's emancipation, she was an early role model for the emancipated woman through her independent and controversial lifestyle. G√∂sta Lundstr√∂m said of her: :\\"As a writer alone, Hebbe can not be given a prominent place in our history. But as a gathering and inspiring force in the cultural life of 19th-century Sweden she is well worth remembering. Also as one of the earliest representatives of women's emancipation in our nation, she defends her place as one of the most noted Swedish women of her century. Though she in many aspects illustrated the \\"soulful\\" women's ideal of the romantic era, she balanced this with her intelligence and clearheaded realism.\\" The writer and journalist Jane Gernandt- Claine described her: :\\"Around her entire ethereal being there was an indescribable air of spiritual refinement, this nobility of the soul, which belongs to the most admirable things in life. You never truly got close to her and never really wanted to, you were only too happy to be at a distance from so much soulful nobility within this fragile and refined shell. Wendela Hebbe was much courted by contemporary male artists but is described as without vanity. She commented about herself and her life that she was born \\"with much longing and much frustration\\". Legacy In 1983 the association Friends of Wendela Hebbe ( was founded to preserve the memory of Wendela Hebbe. The association preserves her summer house in S√∂dert√§lje, which was given to her by Hierta in 1863, and made it a museum. The gymnasium Wendela Hebbegymnasiet in S√∂dert√§lje is named after her.

Republic (1886-1891) The borders between French Guiana and Brazil were not clear. Attempts at negotiations failed, and in 1862 it was decided that the area between the Amazon and the Oyapock was a neutral territory. Paul Quartier who had previously visited the territory in 1883, returned in 1885 and had a meeting with two village chiefs who were hostile to the Brazilians. The gentlemen signed a treaty on 23 July 1886 creating the country of Counani in the disputed area. A government was set up in Counani near Cal√ßoene lead by Jules Gros as President, Guigues as Minister of State and Quartier as Quartermaster. They set about recruiting settlers, and according to Le Gaulois received over 3,000 requests. Both France and Brazil did not like what was happening and released a joint statement on 11 September 1887 stating that the Republic of Counani is not recognized. Gros was later disposed by his officials, and the death of Gros in 1891 resulted in the end of the short lived first Republic. In 1894 gold was discovered in the Cal√ßoene River, and this caused the Brazilian general Francisco Cabral to declare another autonomous state under Brazilian protection which was crushed by the Governor of French Guiana. In 1897, France and Brazil asked Switzerland to settle the dispute, and most of the territory of the former state of Counani was given to Brazil in what is nowadays the state of Amap√°. Free State of Counani (1901‚Äì1904) Flag of the Free State of Counani (1901‚Äì1904) In 1901 a Frenchman named Adolphe Brezet proclaimed himself \\"Pr√©sident de l'√âtat libre de Counani\\". According to newspaper articles based on Brezet's statements, he was elected democratically in 1901. This \\"special\\" State had a constitution, a flag and issued some stamps. It was never recognized by Brazil or France, but the South African Boer Republics opened diplomatic relations with Brezet (who had fought for them previously) during the Boer wars. In 1904, Japan and Russia asked for vessels which Brezet didn't have, and thus exposed himself to France and Brazil. Nevertheless he claimed to be a president until 1911 when he was exiled to London.

The revivers are known in Islam as Mujaddids. Within the Islamic tradition, tajdid has been an important religious concept, which has manifested itself throughout Islamic history in periodic calls for a renewed commitment to the fundamental principles of Islam and reconstruction of society in accordance with the Quran and the traditions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad (hadith). The concept of tajdid has played a prominent role in contemporary Islamic revival. In academic literature, \\"Islamic revival\\" is an umbrella term encompassing \\"a wide variety of movements, some intolerant and exclusivist, some pluralistic; some favorable to science, some anti-scientific; some primarily devotional, and some primarily political; some democratic, some authoritarian; some pacific, some violent\\". Since the 1970s, a worldwide Islamic revival has emerged, owing in large part to popular disappointment with the secular nation states and Westernized ruling elites, which had dominated the Muslim world during the preceding decades, and which were increasingly seen as authoritarian, ineffective and lacking cultural authenticity. It is also motivated by a desire to \\"restore Islam to ascendancy in a world that has turned away from God\\". The revival has been accompanied by growth of various reformist-political movements inspired by Islam (also called Islamist), and by \\"re-Islamisation\\" of society from above and below, with manifestations ranging from sharia-based legal reformsRoy, Failure of Political Islam, 1994: pp. 126‚Äì27 to greater piety and growing adoption of Islamic culture (such as increased attendance at HajjKepel, Gilles, Jihad: on the Trail of Political Islam, Harvard University Press, 2002, p. 75) among the Muslim public.Lapidus, p. 823 Among immigrants in non-Muslim countries, it includes a feeling of a \\"growing universalistic Islamic identity\\" or transnational Islam,described by the French Islam researchers Gilles Kepel and Olivier Roy brought on by easier communications, media and travel. The revival has also been accompanied by an increased influence of fundamentalist preachers and terrorist attacks carried out by some radical Islamist groups on a global scale. Preachers and scholars who have been described as revivalists (Mujaddids) or mujaddideen, by differing sects and groups, in the history of Islam include Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Ibn Taymiyyah, Shah Waliullah, Ahmad Sirhindi, Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab, and Muhammad Ahmad. In the 20th century, figures such as Hassan al-Banna, Abul Ala Maududi, Malcolm X, and Ruhollah Khomeini, have been described as such, and academics often use the terms \\"Islamist\\" and \\"Islamic revivalist\\" interchangeably. Contemporary revivalist currents include Islamic liberalism, which seeks to reconcile Islamic beliefs with modern values; neo-Sufism, which cultivates Muslim spirituality; and neo-fundamentalism, which stresses obedience to Islamic law and ritual observance. Earlier history of revivalism The concept of Islamic revival is based on a sahih hadith (a saying attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad),Neal Robinson (2013), Islam: A Concise Introduction, Routledge, , Chapter 7, pp. 85-89 recorded by Abu Dawood, narrated by Abu Hurairah, who reported that Prophet Muhammad said: Within the Islamic tradition, tajdid (lit., regeneration, renewal) has been an important religious concept. Early on into the Islamic era, Muslims realized that they have not succeeded in creating and maintaining a society that truly followed the principles of their religion. As a result, Islamic history has seen periodic calls for a renewed commitment to the fundamental principles of Islam and reconstruction of society in accordance with the Quran and the traditions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad (hadith). These efforts often drew inspiration from the hadith in which Muhammad states: \\"God will send to His community at the head of each century those who will renew its faith for it\\". Throughout Islamic history, Muslims looked to reforming religious leaders to fulfill the role of a mujaddid (lit., renewer). Although there is disagreement over which individuals might actually be identified as such, Muslims agree that mujaddids have been an important force in the history of Islamic societies. The modern movement of Islamic revival has been compared with earlier efforts of a similar nature: The \\"oscillat[ion] between periods of strict religious observance and others of devotional laxity\\" in Islamic history was striking enough for \\"the Arab historian, Ibn Khaldun to ponder its causes 600 years ago, and speculate that it could be \\"attributed ... to features of ecology and social organization peculiar to the Middle East\\", namely the tension between the easy living in the towns and the austere life in the desert. Some of the more famous revivalists and revival movements include the Almoravid and Almohad dynasties in Maghreb and Spain (1042‚Äì1269), Indian Naqshbandi revivalist Ahmad Sirhindi (~1564‚Äì1624), the Indian Ahl-i Hadith movement of the 19th century, preachers Ibn Taymiyyah (1263‚Äì1328), Shah Waliullah (1702‚Äì1762), and Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab (d. 1792). In the late 19th century, Jamal-al-Din Afghani, \\"one of the most influential Muslim reformers\\" of the era, traveled the Muslim world, advocating for Islamic modernism and pan-Islamism.Sohail H. Hashimi, \\"Afghani, Jamal Al-Din\\" Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World, Thomson Gale, 2004 His sometime acolyte Muhammad Abduh has been called \\"the most influential figure\\" of Modernist Salafism.The New Encyclopedia of Islam by Cyril Glasse, Altamira, 2008, p. 15 In 1928 Hassan al-Banna established the Muslim Brotherhood, the first mass Islamist organization. Other influential revival activists and thinkers include Rashid Rida and Ali Abdel Raziq. In South Asia, Islamic revivalist intellectuals and statesmen like Syed Ahmed Khan, Muhammad Iqbal, Muhammad Ali Jinnah promoted the Two-Nation Theory and the Muslim League established the world's first modern Islamic republic, Pakistan. Abul Ala Maududi was the later leader of this movement who established Jamaat-e-Islami in South Asia. Today it is one of the most influential Islamic parties in the Indian sub-continent, spanning three countries (Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh), although the different national parties have no organisational link between them.Jamaat-e-Islami Whether or not the contemporary revival is part of an historical cycle, the uniqueness of the close association of the Muslim community with its religion has been noted by scholar Michael Cook who observed that \\"of all the major cultural domains\\" the Muslim world \\"seems to have been the least penetrated by irreligion\\". In the last few decades ending in 2000, rather than scientific knowledge and secularism edging aside religion, Islamic fundamentalism has \\"increasingly represented the cutting edge\\" of Muslim culture.Cook, Michael, The Koran, a very short introduction, Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 43 Contemporary revivalism= Causes  A global wave of Islamic revivalism emerged starting from 1970s owing in large part to popular disappointment with the secular nation states and Westernized ruling elites, which had dominated the Muslim world during the preceding decades, and which were increasingly seen as authoritarian, ineffective and lacking cultural authenticity. It was also a reaction against Western influences such as individualism, consumerism, commodification of women, and sexual liberty, which were seen as subverting Islamic values and identities. Economic and demographic factors, such as lagging economic development, a rise in income inequality and a decline in social mobility, the rise of an educated youth with expectation of higher upward mobility, and urbanization in the Muslim world also played a major part. In general, the gap between higher expectations and reality among many in the Muslim world was an important factor. Gulf oil money was also a huge factor, in a phenomenon known as Petro-Islam. The above reasons are generally agreed to be the ultimate causes of the Islamic revival. There were also specific political events which heralded the revival. Major historical turning points in the Islamic revival include, in chronological order: * The Arab defeat in the 1967 Six-Day War helped to convince many Muslims that pan-Arabism failed to deliver on its promises. According to a common assessment offered at the time, \\"the Jews had deserved victory by being truer to their religion than the Arabs had been to theirs\\". After a period of introspection and rise of religious discourse, the Yom Kippur War of 1973 was fought in the name of Islam rather than pan-Arabism and the greater success of Arab armies was seen to validate the change.Sacred Rage: The Wrath of Militant Islam By Robin Wright, p. 65-66 * The energy crisis of the 1970s, which led to the formation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the quadrupling of global oil prices. At first, this led to an expectation that the oil wealth would lead to a long- awaited resurgence of the Islamic civilization, and when this failed to materialize, the mounting frustration with secular regimes made the public more receptive to religious fundamentalism.Wright, Sacred Rage, p. 66interview by Robin Wright of UK Foreign Secretary (at the time) Lord Carrington in November 1981, Sacred Rage: The Wrath of Militant Islam by Robin Wright, Simon and Schuster, (1985), p. 67 Scholar Gilles Kepel, agrees that the tripling in the price of oil in the mid-1970s and the progressive takeover of Saudi Aramco in the 1974‚Äì1980 period, provided the source of much influence of Wahhabism in the Islamic World, in the aforementioned phenomenon of Petro-Islam. * The opening of the first Islamic bank in Dubai. * The rise of the Mujahideen in Afghanistan in the late 1970s. The Mujahideen were a major beneficiary of Petro-Islam, and would ultimately lead to the rise of Al-Qaeda. * Zia-ul-Haq introduces Islamic legal system in Pakistan. * The return of Ayatollah Khomeini to Iran in 1979 and his establishment of an Islamic republic. * The Grand Mosque Seizure of 1979. * The establishment of many Islamic banks in Turkey in the mid 1980s and the government recognition of these banks.  Manifestations  The term \\"Islamic revival\\" encompasses \\"a wide variety of movements, some intolerant and exclusivist, some pluralistic; some favorable to science, some anti-scientific; some primarily devotional, and some primarily political; some democratic, some authoritarian; some pacific, some violent\\". The revival has been manifested in greater piety and a growing adoption of Islamic culture among ordinary Muslims.Lapidus, p. 823 In the 1970s and 80s there were more veiled women in the streets. One striking example of it is the increase in attendance at the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, which grew from 90,000 in 1926 to 2 million in 1979. Among revivalist currents, neo-fundamentalism predominates, stressing obedience to Islamic law and ritual observance. There have also been Islamic liberal revivalists attempting to reconcile Islamic beliefs with contemporary values and neo-Sufism cultivates Muslim spirituality; Many revivalist movements have a community-building orientation, focusing on collective worship, education, charity or simple sociability. Many local movements are linked up with national or transnational organizations which sponsor charitable, educational and missionary activities. A number of revivalist movements have called for implementation of sharia. The practical implications of this call are often obscure, since historically Islamic law has varied according to time and place, but as an ideological slogan it serves \\"to rally support for the creation of a utopian, divinely governed Islamic state and society\\". According to scholar Olivier Roy, > The call to fundamentalism, centered on the sharia: this call is as old as > Islam itself and yet still new because it has never been fulfilled, It is a > tendency that is forever setting the reformer, the censor, and tribunal > against the corruption of the times and of sovereigns, against foreign > influence, political opportunism, moral laxity, and the forgetting of sacred > texts.Roy, Failure of Political Islam, 1994: p. 4 Contemporary Islamic revival includes a feeling of a \\"growing universalistic Islamic identity\\" as often shared by Muslim immigrants and their children who live in non-Muslim countries. According to Ira Lapidus, > The increased integration of world societies as a result of enhanced > communications, media, travel, and migration makes meaningful the concept of > a single Islam practiced everywhere in similar ways, and an Islam which > transcends national and ethnic customs.Lapidus, p. 828 But not necessarily transnational political or social organisations: > Global Muslim identity does not necessarily or even usually imply organised > group action. Even though Muslims recognise a global affiliation, the real > heart of Muslim religious life remains outside politics ‚Äì in local > associations for worship, discussion, mutual aid, education, charity, and > other communal activities.Lapidus, p. 829 Scholarship and fiqh Islamic revivalist leaders have been \\"activists first, and scholars only secondarily\\", emphasizing practical issues of Islamic law and impatience with theory. According to Daniel W. Brown, two \\"broad features\\" define the revivalist approach to Islamic authorities: distrust of Islamic scholarship along with \\"vehement rejection\\" of taqlid (accepting a scholar's decision without investigating it); and at the same time a strong commitment to the Quran and Sunnah. Political aspects Politically, Islamic resurgence runs the gamut from Islamist regimes in Iran, Sudan, and Taliban Afghanistan. Other regimes, such as countries in the Persian Gulf region, and the secular countries of Iraq, Egypt, Libya, and Pakistan, while not a product of the resurgence, have made some concessions to its growing popularity. In reaction to Islamist opposition during the 1980s, even avowedly secular Muslim states \\"endeavoured to promote a brand of conservative Islam and to organise an \`official Islam\`\\".Roy, Failure of Political Islam, 1994: pp. 92‚Äì3 Official radio stations and journals opened up to fundamentalist preaching. In 1971, the constitution of Egypt was made to specify (in article 2) that the sharia was \\"the main source of legislation\\". 1991 the Egyptian Security Court condemned the writer Ala'a Hamid to eight years in prison for blasphemy. By the mid 1990s, the official Islamic journal in Egypt ‚Äì Al-Liwa al-Islami ‚Äì had a higher circulation than Al-Ahram. The number of \\"teaching institutes dependent\\" on Al-Azhar University in Egypt increased \\"from 1985 in 1986‚Äì7 to 4314 in 1995‚Äì6\\". In Pakistan, a bill to make sharia the exclusive source of law of the state was introduced after General Zia's coup in 1977, and finally passed in 1993 under Nawaz Sharif's government. The number of registered madrassas rose from 137 in 1947 to 3906 in 1995. In Sudan, the sharia penal code was proclaimed in 1983. South Yemen (formerly the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen) made polygamy legal with a new Family Code in 1992. In Algeria, the leftist secularist FLN government made Friday an official holy day in 1976. The family law of 1984 \\"re-introduced some sharia elements\\" such as Quranic dissymmetry between men and women, and the official policy of Arabisation led to a de facto Islamisation of education. In secular Turkey, religious teaching in schools was made compulsory in 1983. Religious graduates of ƒ∞mam Hatip secondary schools were given right of access to the universities and allowed to apply for civil service positions, introducing it to religious-minded people. Even the Marxist government of Afghanistan, before it was overthrown, introduced religious programs on television in 1986, and declared Islam to be the state religion in 1987. In Morocco, at the end of the 1990s, more doctorates were written in religious sciences than in social sciences and literature. In Saudi Arabia, the absolute majority of doctorates were in religious sciences. In Syria, despite the rule of the Arab nationalist Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, In many Muslim countries, there has been a growth of networks of religious schools. \\"Graduates holding a degree in religious science are now entering the labour market and tend, of course, to advocate the Islamisasion of education and law in order to improve their job prospects.\\" In Iraq, Ayatollah Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr criticized Marxism and presented early ideas of an Islamic alternative to socialism and capitalism. Perhaps his most important work was Iqtisaduna (Our Economics), considered an important work of Islamic economics .The Renewal of Islamic Law: Muhammad Baqer as-Sadr, Najaf, and the Shi'i InternationalSeyyed Vali Reza Nasr, International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 25, No. 4 (Nov., 1993), pp. 718‚Äì19 Criticism One observation made of Islamization is that increased piety and adoption of Sharia has \\"in no way changed the rules of the political or economic game\\", by leading to greater virtue. \\"Ethnic and tribal segmentation, political maneuvering, personal rivalries\\" have not diminished, nor has corruption in politics and economics based on speculation.Roy, Failure of Political Islam, 1994: p. 26 See also * International propagation of Salafism and Wahhabism * Petro-Islam * Ahmadiyya * Contemporary Islamic philosophy * Islamistan * Islamization of knowledge * Islam and modernity Notes * Further reading * Rahnema, Ali ; Pioneers of Islamic Revival (Studies in Islamic Society); London: Zed Books, 1994 * Lapidus, Ira Marvin, A History of Islamic Societies, Cambridge University Press; 2 edition (August 26, 2002) * Roy, Olivier; Globalized Islam: The Search for a New Ummah (CERI Series in Comparative Politics and International Studies); 1994 * External links * The Islamic revival in Egypt * Islamic revival in Jordan * Africa and Islamic Revival: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives Category:Islamism Category:Political neologisms ","title":"Islamic revival"},{"id":"10909574","text":"Michael Buback Michael Buback (February 16, 1945) is a chemist and professor at G√∂ttingen University.

Peklenica is known for its natural source of crude oil known to local population since at least the Middle Ages. The toponym, first recorded in 1391, is derived from words paklina or pekel, which is how the locals called the greasy substance they used for lubrication of horse-drawn carriages as well as for medicinal purposes. According to Ottoman explorer Evliya √áelebi's writings, the town of Szigetv√°r was burnt during the 1566 siege using oil from Peklenica. The oil was first commercially exploited by count Georg Festetics in 1856, arguably predating the well-known Drake Well in Pennsylvania by three years. From the 1880s to the early 20th century, Viennese entrepreneur Wilhelm Singer drilled dozens of oil wells in the village. Due to diminishing returns, oil exploitation in Peklenica ended in 1967.

College of canons and collegiate church To the east of the road in medieval times stood a college of secular canons of ancient origin, with a collegiate church dedicated to St Martin of Tours. The institution was situated in the City of London parish of St Leonard, Foster Lane.Town & City Historical Maps: Map of Medieval London 2019. According to a somewhat dubious tradition, the college and church dated to the 7th or 8th century and was founded by King Wihtred of Kent.Walter Besant (1906) Medieval London, Vol II: 234History of London (1878) by Walter Thornbury It was, more certainly, rebuilt or founded about 1056 by two brothers, Ingelric and Girard, during the reign of Edward the Confessor. Its foundation was confirmed by a charter of William the Conqueror, dating to 1068.Ben Weinreb and Christopher Hibbert (1983) The London Encyclopedia: 735Dictionary of City of London Street Names The church was responsible for the sounding of the curfew bell in the evenings, which announced the closing of the city's gates. It also had certain rights of sanctuary; these persisted until 1697 and, as such, made the locality a notorious haven for malefactors. One who sought sanctuary here was Miles Forrest, one of the reputed murderers of the Princes in the Tower. The college was taken over by Westminster Abbey in 1503 as part of the endowment granted for the upkeep of the Henry VII Chapel. This was an arrangement allowing the abbey to appropriate the college's revenues, and did not make the latter a monastery. Liberty As the property of a monastery, the college was dissolved by King Henry VIII and demolished for redevelopment in 1548. However, the link with Westminster Abbey meant that the precinct was subsequently regarded as part of the borough of Westminster, and as a liberty: a district outside the jurisdiction of the legal officers of the City of London.

A transmitter was placed on the roof of the Central Telegraph Office on Newgate Street and a receiver on the roof of the General Post Office South on Carter Lane. The distance between the two buildings was 300metres. Later that year the Post Office provided funding for Marconi to conduct further experiments on Salisbury Plain.

For a general overview of the club, see Middlesbrough F.C.. Formation through to the Great War (1876‚Äì1914) Middlesbrough Ironopolis displaying their Northern championships According to Boro folklore, the idea for forming the football club was suggested during a tripe supper at the Corporation Hotel, Middlesbrough,Middlesbrough at football.co.uk and while this has since been discovered by club historian Harry Glasper to be untrue, it is certainly true that like many football clubs of the time (such as The Wednesday), Middlesbrough F.C. were formed by members of the local cricket club wishing to stay fit during the winter.http://www.premierleague.com/middlesbrough.html Indeed, it was at Albert Park on Linthorpe Road where players from Middlesbrough Amateur Cricket Club formed the fledgling team.icTeesside ‚Äì icTeesside : Boro FC : Club History The club retained its amateur status until 1889 when several members of Middlesbrough FC split to form Middlesbrough Ironopolis over a dispute. Both teams made their debuts as professional teams within a week of each other in December 1889. After three years it was clear that both clubs were becoming more successful and club officials knew that only an amalgamation would give them a serious chance of a place in the Football League. On 7 May 1892 an application was made to the Football League under the name of Middlesbrough and Ironopolis Football and Athletic Club. The application failed and both clubs went their separate ways once more, as Middlesbrough FC reverted to their amateur status. They won the FA Amateur Cup in 1895 and again in 1898. The following year, 1899, Middlesbrough turned professional again in an attempt to gain entry to the Football League, and on 18 May 1899, backed by local neighbours Newcastle United and Sunderland, they were admitted to the Second Division, narrowly ahead of Blackpool. Boro's first season in the FL was not a success, as they failed to win an away game, finishing 14th out of 18 teams. The 1901‚Äì02 campaign saw Boro finish second, to gain promotion to the First Division, where they would play their home games in their new ground, Ayresome Park, with a North Stand designed by Archibald Leitch, that would be their home for the next 92 years. This was exactly next to Ironopolis's old stadium, known as The Paradise Ground. By February 1905, Boro had not won an away game for two years, and in an attempt to remedy this the board sanctioned the controversial transfer of Alf Common for a then record fee of ¬£1,000.icTeesside ‚Äì Battling with the Boro for 125 years The following season, Steve Bloomer arrived from Derby County, and by 1907‚Äì08 Boro had secured their highest finish in the top division, finishing sixth, just two points behind runners-up Aston Villa. National scandal was to follow in 1910, when Boro defeated local rivals Sunderland 1‚Äì0. It was to emerge after the match that Boro manager Andy Walker had offered Sunderland's players the sum of ¬£2 each to let Boro win the game. The Sunderland players told their manager and he took it further. Walker was given an indefinite suspension from the FL, and Middlesbrough's season petered out to a drab conclusion. Four years later, Middlesbrough enjoyed their highest finish to date, as they ended the 1913‚Äì14 season in third place, before the First World War intervened. Between the World Wars (1919‚Äì39) After the war, several players were too old to continue, and three had been killed in action. Before the season restarted, Boro were victorious in the Northern Victory League, and looked forward to competitive football again. While striker George Elliott and keeper Tim Williamson were still at the top of their game, the team's chance at the championship had faded and they finished mid-table. They remained there for the next few seasons, before finally slipping to relegation in 1923‚Äì24, finishing 22nd of 22, ten points adrift of their nearest rivals. Three seasons later, they won the Division Two title, despite gaining only one point from their first four games. For their fifth game, injury meant George Camsell, signed from Third Division North side Durham City the previous season, got a start. He was to prove a revelation, and finished with a record 59 league goals, including nine hat tricks. He would continue as top scorer for each of the next ten seasons. Although back in the top flight, the club didn't last long. Despite a good start to the season, Herbert Bamlett was replaced in January 1928, and replaced by former Spurs boss Peter McWilliam. However, following this, the club slipped to bottom of the table and were relegated. They bounced straight back the next season though, winning another Second Division title, remaining in the top flight after that until 1954. After several seasons of milling around the bottom reaches of the table, 1936‚Äì37 saw the emergence of Wilf Mannion, whom Boro had signed from local club South Bank St Peter's. George Hardwick, who came from South Bank East End, also emerged. Both would go on to become England internationals in the years ahead. Boro rose to seventh that season, before moving to fifth, then up to fourth, their highest since before the First World War. Under former Grimsby boss Wilf Gallow, the club looked good to challenge for the 1939‚Äì40 title. In fact, Boro were second-bottom after three games, when war was declared, and broke up arguably their finest ever side. A steady decline (1946‚Äì66) After the war, the club was unable to recover the form of the previous seasons and hovered around mid-table and the early rounds of the FA Cup. With Jamaican-born Lindy Delapenha playing on the wing, Boro climbed to ninth in 1949‚Äì50. The next season, nearing Christmas, Boro headed the First Division table, but a 1‚Äì0 defeat at Leeds knocked confidence and they slipped to sixth. Midway through the season, Hardwick also left the club to become player-manager of Oldham, and afterwards the team began to falter, eventually falling to relegation in 1953‚Äì54. Their first season began awfully, but they managed to recover and finish 12th. A 6‚Äì0 win over West Ham and a 9‚Äì0 defeat to Blackburn showed it was a season of mixed results. Mannion had refused to sign a new contract upon relegation and was transferred to Hull City, where soon afterwards he disappeared into non-league football. This was the start of a 20-year spell outside the top flight, but saw the emergence of another Middlesbrough great ‚Äì Brian Clough. Making his debut in 1955‚Äì56, he helped the club to 14th place. From the next season, he started to establish himself in history. He rattled in the goals ‚Äì 38 in that season, then 40, 43, 39 and 34, gaining his only two England caps in 1959‚Äì60, before inevitably leaving for arch-rivals Sunderland. After 204 goals in 222 games, he would be missed. Over that period, Boro maintained reasonable progress in the Second Division but never looked like gaining promotion. After a 4th-place finish in 1962‚Äì63, the only way for Boro was down. They finished 10th, 17th, then 21st. On the last day of the season, Middlesbrough needed a draw at Cardiff to stay up, who themselves needed a win to remain in the division. A hat-trick from makeshift striker Dickie Rooks couldn't help Boro, who went down 5‚Äì3, and were relegated to the Third Division for the first time. Recovery, success and disaster (1966‚Äì86) It was new manager Stan Anderson's job to return the club to the second flight. After only two wins in their first ten games, fans thought the club was already on the way down to the Fourth Division, but Anderson turned it around and the team finished second. Gordon Jones was captain, and John Hickton arrived, both of whom would go on to be second and third respectively in the club's all time appearances table. After regaining promotion to the Second Division, Boro were on good form. They wouldn't finish below ninth during the next eight seasons. The FA Cup saw the club never get past the quarter-finals, a feat they were yet to accomplish in their history. John Hickton, converted from defence, was proving a revelation up front, while Willie Maddren made his debut in 1969, with John Craggs and Stuart Boam joining three seasons later. Jim Platt had also taken over in goal. With Graeme Souness joining soon after, the spine of the team to gain promotion to the First Division was there. Jack Charlton took over as manager and guided the team back to the top flight at last. They ensured promotion as early as 23 March, and with eight games of the season left, they became runaway champions, finishing with a record 65 points. Middlesbrough spent the next eight seasons in the First Division, finishing 7th in 1974‚Äì75 and were generally a mid-table side in the seasons that followed. Some believe the side lacked the necessary firepower at the time to become serious contenders. However, the club's youth system turned out talent such as David Armstrong, Graeme Souness, Stan Cummins, Craig Johnston and Mark Proctor. Back in the top flight, the team also gained some luck in the cups, albeit still not winning anything. In 1974‚Äì75, Boro reached the sixth round of the FA Cup and the quarter finals of the League Cup. The next season, they reached the semi final of the League Cup, where they lost 4‚Äì1 on aggregate to Manchester City. 1975‚Äì76 however was when Boro won their first silverware as a professional side, lifting the Anglo-Scottish Cup in its first season after a two-legged final win over Fulham. After four seasons in charge, Charlton resigned as boss following three mid-table finishes, with John Neal taking over. In his first season, Boro should have reached the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time, but Second Division Leyton Orient managed to take them to a home replay and win. The club's patchy league form meant they did not climb any higher than mid-table however. After eleven years at the club, David Mills was sold for a then national record of ¬£482,222 to West Bromwich Albion in 1979. Neal left in 1981 and Bobby Murdoch took over. That same year Proctor, Johnston and Armstrong all left the club. Dutch midfielder Heini Otto was signed from FC Twente. The 1981/82 season saw Middlesbrough relegated in last place. In February 1982, chairman Charles Amer and his son Kevin, a director, left the club to be replaced by George Kitching. That season saw Middlesbrough suffer a disappointing relegation back to the Second Division. With Murdoch still as manager, and, after appearing at the World Cup, Jim Platt as captain, led Boro into another disappointing season. In a season in which Tony Mowbray made his debut, the defence was leaking goals. Murdoch was asked to resign, Kitching stepped down to be replaced by Mike McCullagh, and Malcolm Allison became manager. The club eventually finished 16th. Platt left at the end of that season and Stephen Pears came in on loan from Manchester United. Serious financial problems were now staring Boro in the face. Allison was being pressured into off-loading star players and matters came to a head in March 1984 when he claimed it was \\"Better for the club to die than to linger slowly on its deathbed\\". This saw Allison kicked out and replaced by Willie Maddren, temporarily with some help from Jack Charlton. Middlesbrough were dropping down the table though, finishing 19th in 1984‚Äì85. On the opening day of 1985‚Äì86, Maddren named four debutants in the team that lost 3‚Äì0 to Wimbledon, one of whom was Gary Pallister. The cups were not going well either, and Boro were getting knocked out in the early rounds with alarming regularity. McCullagh left the club and was replaced by Alf Duffield, another change in chairmanship. In 1986, Maddren left to be replaced by coach Bruce Rioch. In April the club, fighting for its existence, had to borrow ¬£30,000 from the Professional Footballers' Association to pay wages. The final game of the season saw Boro relegated to the Third Division once more. A near death experience (1986) On 21 May 1986, the club called in the Provisional Liquidator and shortly afterwards, the club was wound up. In August, Rioch and 29 other non-playing staff were sacked by the Official Receiver and the gates to Ayresome Park were padlocked. Some players left, while others stayed under Rioch and coach Colin Todd. Without the ¬£350,000 capital required for Football League registration, the death of the club was announced on Tyne Tees Television, and it seemed inevitable that the club would fold permanently. However, Steve Gibson, a member of the board at the time, brought together a consortium involving Bulkhaul Limited, ICI, Scottish and Newcastle Breweries and London businessman Henry Moszkowicz. With ten minutes to spare, Middlesbrough F.C. avoided missing the deadline and completed their registration with the Football League for the 1986‚Äì87 season with both a change of crest to a circular crest with the lion in the middle and the words \\"Middlesbrough Football Club 1986\\" around the circle, and a change of name to Middlesbrough Football and Athletic Club (1986) Ltd. With the gates to Ayresome Park still closed by the bailiffs, Middlesbrough were forced to play their opening game of the season at Hartlepool United's home ground, Victoria Park. Rioch revival... and more ups and downs (1986‚Äì94) Manager Bruce Rioch and his players pulled together after the takeover and with his young squad including Boro legends Colin Cooper, Gary Pallister and Tony Mowbray finished second in the Third Division behind A.F.C. Bournemouth to win automatic promotion to the Second Division. A year later they won the Second Division promotion/First Division relegation playoffs, after defeating First Division Chelsea to send them down, and achieved a second successive promotion which landed them in the First Division. Middlesbrough showed promise in 1988‚Äì89 and fought themselves to a mid-table place, but a form slump in the second half of the season culminated in relegation on the final day- they had not occupied a relegation place that season before then. Gary Pallister was sold to Manchester United for a then national record transfer fee of ¬£2.3 million.BBC ‚Äì h2g2 ‚Äì Manchester United: The Sir Alex Era ‚Äì Part One Their dismal form continued into the following season and a second successive relegation looked on the cards. Rioch was subsequently dismissed in March 1990 and his successor Colin Todd just managed to save Boro from the drop. The same season saw Middlesbrough play in their first Wembley cup final, suffering a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Chelsea in the Zenith Data Systems Cup. The team was led out at Wembley by an unfit Tony Mowbray. 1990‚Äì91 saw Boro's form improve substantially and a seventh-place finish was enough to qualify for the playoffs ‚Äì this time four promotion places were up for grabs because the First Division was re-expanding to 22 clubs for the 1991‚Äì92 season. But the promotion dream was ended in the semi-finals when Boro lost to eventual playoff winners Notts County. Todd left soon afterwards and was succeeded by Charlton's Lennie Lawrence. Lawrence's first season at the helm was a success, with Boro reaching the League Cup semi finals for the second time and most significantly finishing runners-up in the Second Division ‚Äì booking their place in the inaugural Premier League. Boro were mid table in the Premiership come Christmas 1992, but a run of seven defeats beginning in February dragged them down the table and they were relegated after losing their penultimate game of the season. The board kept faith in Lawrence but he resigned a year later after failing to achieve promotion back to the Premiership. Robson revolution (1994‚Äì2001) Lawrence's successor was 37-year-old player-manager Bryan Robson, who had just ended an illustrious 13-year playing career with Manchester United F.C. and was a former England captain. With assistant manager Viv Anderson, Boro spent big and brought in players like club record signing at the time Neil CoxSteaua Bucharest v Middlesbrough match programme  A Twinge of Remorse with your Success Sir? ‚Äì Why Robbo is the Unsung Hero for ¬£1 million, club captain Nigel Pearson and Norwegian striker Jan √Öge Fj√∏rtoft. His first season was a great success and Boro lifted the Division One title and getting promoted back to the Premiership after a two-year exile. A large part in the promotion push was played by a good loan signing in the form of Uwe Fuchs, scoring 9 goals in 13 league games. 1994‚Äì95 was the club's last season at Ayresome Park, from which they were relocating after 92 years to their new home at the Riverside Stadium on the banks of the River Tees. Boro went on a massive spending spree after their promotion to the Premiership, paying ¬£5.25million for 21-year-old Tottenham Hotspur F.C. winger Nick Barmby and ¬£4.75million for 22-year-old Brazilian midfielder Juninho Paulista. The policy looked to have paid off as Boro stood fourth in the Premiership in October, but a terrible run of form followed and they slid to 12th place in the final table. Boro's dismal away form ‚Äì just 8 goals in 19 games ‚Äì also helped end their dreams of European football. Robson paid ¬£7 million for Juventus striker Fabrizio Ravanelli and ¬£4 million for Brazilian midfielder Emerson for the following season, but Boro spent the season battling relegation instead of chasing a top-five finish. Their difficult task was compounded by a deduction of three points imposed just after Christmas, as punishment for the club's failure to fulfill a fixture against Blackburn Rovers F.C.. The club's explanation was that so many squad members had been hit by a flu virus that it could not field a competitive team; however the Football Association rejected this explanation despite allegedly encouraging the team to do this in the first place. Meanwhile, Boro were building up an impressive cup run and reached the first senior cup final of their history in March, where they faced Leicester City F.C. in the League Cup. The deadlock was not broken until extra time, when Fabrizio Ravanelli's goal looked to have secured the trophy for Boro. But Leicester then scored an equaliser and went on to win the replay, through a goal from Steve Claridge. Boro's three point deduction eventually cost them their Premiership status and they were relegated on the final day of the season after a draw at Elland Road. A week later they lost 2‚Äì0 to Chelsea F.C. in the FA Cup final and became the first English club to lose both major cup finals and be relegated from the top division in the same season. Despite these setbacks, Juninho still managed to finish as runner-up in the Footballer of the Year award to Gianfranco Zola. The board kept faith in Robson and they were rewarded with promotion back to the Premiership as Division One runners-up the following season. While Emerson, Ravanelli and Juninho were all sold, new players such as Paul Merson, Marco Branca and Mark Schwarzer were brought in, helping the club not only gain promotion at the first attempt. Such was Merson's form that he was the only player from outside the top flight to be picked for England's World Cup squad that year.First Artist Management ‚Äì Paul Merson Amazingly, Boro reached the League Cup final for the second consecutive year, unfortunately once again losing to their opponents, Chelsea, 2‚Äì0 after extra time. During this period, Robson also acted as a coach to the England team under Terry Venables. Two more secure mid-table finishes followed, but Boro found themselves battling relegation come the 2000‚Äì01 season. Venables was appointed to work alongside Robson and they comfortably avoided the drop. Reaching new heights under McClaren (2001‚Äì06) In the 2001 close season, Robson left the club by mutual agreement and was replaced by Steve McClaren ‚Äì the Manchester United assistant manager who was regarded as one of the finest coaches in Europe and was also one of the most prominent coaches in the England team. Players such as Franck Queudrue, Mark Wilson, Jonathan Greening and ¬£6 million signing Gareth Southgate were brought in to refresh the squad and blended with promising youth players such as Luke Wilkshire and Robbie Stockdale. His first season saw Boro finish 12th in the Premiership and reach the FA Cup semi finals. The 2002‚Äì03 season held high hopes. After the promise shown in the previous season, fan favourite Juninho returned to the club for a third spell alongside George Boateng and Massimo Maccarone, an ¬£8.15 million signing from Empoli and Italy's first player to be capped having never played in Serie A,Stats Hosted Solution Football was brought in to increase the firepower available to McClaren. Geremi from Real Madrid was also signed in on loan. Pre-season results were encouraging, but a cruciate ligament injury to Juninho just before the start of the season was a massive setback for the club. An 11th- place finish followed, a marginal improvement on the previous season's finish but slightly disappointing considering Middlesbrough's early season form suggested that they could qualify for Europe. The following season, 2003‚Äì04, saw Middlesbrough win their first major trophy. While Geremi opted to sign for Chelsea, Boudewijn Zenden, Danny Mills, and Gaizka Mendieta were brought in on loan to boost the squad. Success was to follow as they finally won a major trophy after beating Bolton Wanderers 2‚Äì1 in the League Cup final. This success also ensured that Boro would qualify for Europe ‚Äì the UEFA Cup ‚Äì for the first time. The season ended on a disappointing note as they were convincingly beaten 5‚Äì1 by Portsmouth on the final day to end a disappointing league campaign. They finished 11th but had been inconsistent with victories against Manchester United at Old Trafford a 5‚Äì3 thriller at home to Birmingham City and a 3‚Äì0 thrashing of Leeds United at Elland Road followed by defeats by Leeds at home & wolves away (both were relegated this season), Four consecutive premiership games without scoring at home, and 4‚Äì0 and 4‚Äì1 thrashings by Arsenal (who went undefeated throughout the league season) proved to be a disappointment ‚Äì but qualification for Europe by winning the League Cup more than made up for this. The following season started very well, hovering around the top six until November, but a horrendous number of injuries almost sucked them into mid-table and out of the UEFA-cup qualifying places. UEFA cup qualification was eventually achieved after a 1‚Äì1 draw with Manchester City F.C. at the City of Manchester Stadium. If City had won then they would have qualified in Boro's place, and they almost made it when they were awarded a penalty kick in the final minute, but Mark Schwarzer saved Robbie Fowler's spot kick. In their inaugural UEFA Cup run, Middlesbrough performed brightly but were eventually knocked out in the fourth round by Sporting Lisbon. 2005‚Äì06 was a mixed season for Middlesbrough. They found an ability to beat the big teams at the Riverside beating Arsenal 2‚Äì1 and thrashing Manchester United 4‚Äì1. However dismal mid-season form saw them sucked into the bottom half of the Premiership, and at one stage they looked in real danger of being relegated (notably after their 7‚Äì0 loss to Arsenal), although a subsequent recovery ‚Äî which included a 3‚Äì0 win over eventual champions Chelsea ‚Äî saw them finish fourteenth. In McClaren's last Premiership game against Fulham, Steve picked an all English 16 with 15 of the players (except Malcolm Christie) coming from the local area and the average age of the team was less than 20 making it the youngest ever Premiership side.Fulham 1, Boro 0 ‚Äì Young guns are blazing ‚Äì Gazette Live Lee Cattermole was the captain for that match making himself Middlesbrough's youngest ever captain of the first team. To complete the set the team was the first all English starting line-up since Bradford City's in 1999 and the first all English matchday squad since Aston Villa's in 1998 to play in the Premiership. On 27 April 2006, Middlesbrough reached the UEFA Cup final in Eindhoven, with a victory over FC Steaua Bucure≈üti 4‚Äì3 on aggregate in stunning fashion, being 3‚Äì0 down on aggregate after 25 minutes of the second leg. This was the second time in the competition that 'Boro found themselves 3‚Äì0 down after 25 mins of the return leg and yet still going through as they beat FC Basel 4‚Äì3 in the Quarter Finals. Boro fans watched from the stands as their Middlesbrough team lost 4‚Äì0 in the final to Sevilla FC. Trailing Sevilla 0‚Äì1 at the break, McClaren opted for a very attacking line-up for the second half with four strikers, which had worked to great effect in the quarter and semi-finals. Nevertheless, Middlesbrough were forced to push on in desperate search of an equaliser. Whilst playing in European matches, a popular chant amongst Middlesbrough fans was \\"We're just a small town in Europe\\". Southgate, relegation and life in the football league (2006‚Äì10) On 4 May, McClaren was chosen to take over as the manager of the England national team after the 2006 World Cup. Martin O'Neill, Tony Mowbray and Alan Curbishley had been linked with the manager's job at Middlesbrough, with Steve Gibson expecting whoever took over to achieve a Champions League place in the near future. Gibson then looked within his own club and decided to make club captain Gareth Southgate the next manager of Middlesbrough F.C. Southgate signed a five-year contract and decided to finish his playing career, at the age of 35, to focus entirely on his new job. This made him the second youngest manager in the Premiership at the time. His appointment was controversial as he does not currently possess the coaching qualifications required to manage a Premiership football club. However, at a Premier League meeting on 22 November 2006, Southgate was granted a dispensation to continue in his role until the end of the season, during which time it was announced that he will study for the Uefa Pro A Licence. George Boateng was appointed captain. Several players, including Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Franck Queudrue and Doriva left the club in the summer while left sided Argentine Julio Arca was signed from local rivals Sunderland A.F.C. for a fee of ¬£1.75m, and young Frenchman H√©rold Goulon from Olympique Lyonnais on a three-year deal. Southgate's competitive debut started with a 3‚Äì2 defeat to newly promoted Reading. After a 4‚Äì0 loss against Portsmouth, Southgate signed two international defenders to strengthen up his backline. England international Jonathan Woodgate joined his home-town team on loan from Real Madrid, Chelsea's German international centreback Robert Huth, and Charlton Athletic's Jamaican international striker Jason Euell were all signed in the closing days of the transfer window. First Team coach Steve Round left the club on 15 December 2006 following a \\"difference in philosophy and ideas\\" with Gareth Southgate, and was replaced by Colin Cooper. Lee Dong- Gook arrived from Pohang Steelers in the January transfer window, while Ray Parlour, Ugo Ehiogu and Massimo Maccarone all left the club for free. Middlesbrough's form in 2006‚Äì07 was indifferent. Positive results such as a surprising home victory over reigning Premier League Champions Chelsea were coupled with the team losing away from home to all three newly promoted Premiership sides this season. Indeed, they registered their first away win of the season at struggling Charlton in mid-January, their first away win since April of the year before. They comprehensively beat Bolton Wanderers 5‚Äì1 at home in January, their biggest victory of the season. Middlesbrough eventually finished twelfth in league on 46 points, with the fact that they were 8 points away from a UEFA Cup spot and 8 points away from getting relegated neatly summing up their season. In the cups, Boro suffered an embarrassing home defeat in the League Cup to Football League Two side Notts County in the second round. Their FA Cup run was decidedly longer, although this was partly due to them being taken to a replay in every round they played.The fans view: Middlesbrough season rests on FA Cup replay Middlesbrough were eventually knocked out by Premier League champions-elect and eventual Cup finalists, Manchester United at Old Trafford after a narrow 1‚Äì0 defeat in their quarter- final replay. 2007‚Äì08 has been similarly uninspiring. Middlesbrough have never been in the hunt for European qualification (their last hope of a UEFA Cup place disappearing when they were eliminated from the FA Cup in the quarter- finals by championship side Cardiff City) and indeed have spent almost all of the season in the bottom half of the table. With two games remaining, they occupy 15th place and are four points clear of the relegation zone, needing only a win in their penultimate game of the Premier League season to confirm their survival. In the 2008/09 season, despite a positive start to the campaign, Middlesbrough were relegated in abject fashion. The following season back in the Championship, Gareth Southgate was sacked despite the team sitting in fourth place. Gordon Strachan was confirmed as his replacement on 26 October 2009. However the club's form got worse and they finished mid-table at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season. Briefly back in the top flight (2010‚Äìpresent) Middlesbrough started the 2010‚Äì11 season as promotion favourites, but had a poor start and Strachan resigned on 18 October, to be replaced by former player Tony Mowbray. However Mowbray left during the 2013‚Äì14 season, to be replaced by Aitor Karanka, a former Spain international defender and assistant coach at Real Madrid to Jos√© Mourinho.Karanka signed a two-year contract and he guided the club back to the Premier League after finishing second in the 2015‚Äì16 season. Karanka was sacked in March 2017 after a poor run of form, and Middlesbrough were eventually relegated after just one season back in the Premier League finishing in 19th place. Since then the club has appointed both Garry Monk who had a brief spell, and Tony Pulis, but have been no nearer to returning to the top flight. Middlesbrough appointed Jonathan Woodgate as their new manager at the start of the 2019‚Äì20 season. Following a rather unimpressive pre-season Woodgate along with his backroom staff including favourite former Karanka stalwart Leo Percovich and Woodgate's former Spurs team mate Robbie Keane, Middlesbrough started off the season with a dramatic 3-3 draw against Luton on Sky Sports on a Friday night. The \\"golden thread\\" that was mooted in Woodgate's unveiling alongside former FA senior adviser Adrian Bevington, which called for an attacking and intense pressing style looked like it might succeed. Utilising new and exciting youth players like Lewis Wing, Hayden Coulson and Djed Spence, Woodgate seemed like he knew how to get the best out of a mix of old heads and youthful exuberance. Given the enthusiasm following Woodgate's appointment was less than spectacular, it seemed like the Boro faithful were ready to give the local lad, and his new style a chance. Middlesbrough went into September with just one victory in seven games, including being dumped out of the League Cup on penalties by Crewe Alexandra. Things didn't get much better for the club in September with another 3 defeats and just 1 win since the start of the season which saw Boro finding themselves languishing just outside the relegation places in 18th. The club picked up just 2 more points in October and Woodgate's men found themselves in 22nd place by the end of October with a grim total of just 12 points, having yet to win away from home in the league. This period was made worse by Woodgate's ongoing PR campaign that the table at that time was in fact not a fair reflection and Boro were actually playing a lot better than the results suggested, much to frustration of fans who had seen nothing to suggest that the team were capable of competing at a higher level. Much of the autumn was a similar story with the club flattering to deceive and wins were still hard to come by. Draws against fellow strugglers, Hull and QPR were marred by a couple of poor performances against Leeds and Derby with the club losing empathically to Woodgate's former club 4-0 away from home. Following the game Woodgate further irked the Boro faithful with more ill timed comments praising the Leeds team. As Middlesbrough entered the winter period, a time when the club always seemed to under perform, they hit a purple patch. Woodgate's men took 13 points from a possible 18 and finished the year as the most in form team in the division for December earning the manager the Manager of the Month award. The period included a rare away win at promotion chasing WBA, which saw a wonder goal from Ashley Fletcher. There were strong signs of improvement for the young team and Boro went into 2020 with renewed belief and optimism. References and notesExternal links Category:Middlesbrough F.C. Middlesbrough F.C.

The final phrase \\"of knowledge falsely so-called\\" (Greek: tes pseudonymou gnoseos genitive case; or nominative case pseudonymos gnosis).Unger, Dominic J., Dillon, John J., St. Irenaeus of Lyons Against the heresies, Vol.1, p.3, 1992 \\"the final phrase of the title \\"knowledge falsely so-called\\" is found in 1 Timothy 6:20‚Äù.Due to its reference to Eleutherus as the current bishop of Rome, the work is usually dated . Schaff, Philip (2001) [] \\"Introductory Note to Iren√¶us Against Heresies\\", Ante-Nicene Fathers, Volume I, Against Heresies, William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company. In it, Irenaeus identifies and describes several schools of Gnosticism, as well as other schools of Christian thought, and contrasts their beliefs with his conception of orthodox Christianity.Only fragments of the original Greek text exist, but a complete copy exists in a wooden Latin translation, made shortly after its publication in Greek, and Books IV and V are also present in a literal Armenian translation. Until the discovery of the Library of Nag Hammadi in 1945, Against Heresies was the best surviving contemporary description of Gnosticism. Today, the treatise remains historically important as one of the first unambiguous attestations of the canonical gospel texts and some of the Pauline epistles. Irenaeus cites from most of the New Testament canon, as well as the noncanonical works 1 Clement and The Shepherd of Hermas; however, he makes no references to Philemon, 2 Peter, 3 John or Jude ‚Äì four of the shortest epistles. Only fragments of the original text in ancient Greek remain today, but many complete copies in Latin, the dates of writing of which remain unknown (third or fifth century), still survive. Books IV and V exist in their entirety in a literal version in Armenian. Purpose Against Heresies can be dated to sometime between 174 and 189 AD, as the list of the Bishops of Rome includes Eleutherius, but not his successor Victor. The earliest manuscript fragment of Against Heresies, P. Oxy. 405, dates to around 200 AD. Irenaeus' primary goal in writing Against Heresies was to attack rival Christian sects that he deemed heretical, mainly the Gnostics and Marcionites. In particular, he sought to disprove what he saw as incorrect interpretations of scripture on the part of Gnostics such as Valentinus. Irenaeus sought to present \\"what was understood as an authentic form of century-old Christian tradition against various forms of Gnosticism.\\" As bishop, Irenaeus felt compelled to keep a close eye on the Valentinians and to safeguard the church from them. In order to fulfill this duty, Irenaeus became well informed of Gnostic doctrines and traditions. His studies of Gnosticism eventually led to the compilation of this treatise. Main ideas Irenaeus argued that his conception of orthodox Christianity was passed down to him from the apostles who knew Jesus personally, while the Gnostics and Marcionites were distorting this apostolic tradition. While the Gnostics offered salvation through secret knowledge available only to a few, Irenaeus contended that the true doctrines of the Christian faith are the same taught by bishops in different areas. While many of the Gnostics viewed the material world as flawed and from which believers sought to escape to an eternal realm of spirit, Irenaeus saw creation as good and ultimately destined for glorification. As Mark Jeffrey Olson points out, is quoted more than any other verse from the letters of Paul in Against Heresies: Both Irenaeus and the Valentinians use this verse to argue for their own understandings of the resurrection of the dead. The Valentinians believed that resurrection was a purely spiritual phenomenon, while Irenaeus insisted that Christians would be raised from the dead in fleshly bodies. According to Irenaeus, this verse was used by the Gnostics to argue that \\"the handiwork of God is not saved.\\"Irenaeus (2001) [] \\"Showing how that passage of the apostle which the heretics pervert, should be understood; viz., 'Flesh and blood shall not possess the kingdom of God.'\\", in Philip Schaff, Ante-Nicene Fathers, Volume I, Against Heresies, Book V, Chapter IX, William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company. Irenaeus also polemicized against Marcion of Sinope, who preached that the creator God of the Hebrew Bible and the Father of Jesus Christ were two different gods. Irenaeus argues that the same god who sent Jesus to the Earth also led man through history by way of the Jewish law and prophets. Contents * Book 1: I.

The northern section of the Brdy is called \\"H≈ôebeny\\" and features one narrow ridge (highest elevation P√≠sek - 690m). The main Brdy range starts south of the Litavka river gorge and consists of several major elevations connected into one plateau, the highest peaks among them being Tok (864m), Praha (862m) or T≈ôem≈°√≠n (827m). Most of the Brdy is covered by forest, and it is one of the largest contiguously forested areas in the interior of the country. Large sections of the massif are designated as a restricted military area and closed to the public. The Brdy military area has been a source of controversy for several decades. Military area The restricted military area was established in 1925, shortly after creation of Czechoslovakia, to cater for the needs of Czechoslovakia's growing armed forces. It was expanded and used extensively by Third Reich military forces from 1939-1945 during the Nazi Occupation of Czechoslovakia. It continued to be used for intensive military exercises in the post-war era, with some additional expansion in the southern sector. After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, a small Red Army base was situated in the south of the area near Mirosov, until the repatriation of the troops in 1993. Military use of the Brdy mountains gradually decreased after the Velvet Revolution in 1989, as a result of military cost-cutting and eventual professionalization in 2005. However, the central part of the Brdy mountain area retains its restricted military status. The Brdy mountains were a focus of negotiations with American negotiators attempting to agree a deal with Czech government to install a Ground-Based Midcourse Defense missile defense radar system in the military area. However, the missile defence plans were reshaped during the Obama administration and the plan was cancelled.  Infrastructure  No substantial development has taken place in the Brdy mountains since 1925. The lack of man-made changes has left the local flora and fauna to flourish undisturbed. The national forestry company (ƒåesk√© lesy) was responsible for maintaining large areas of the mountains, and still is in the central parts, while northern areas have seen restitution to legal ownership. There are several major roads running across the mountains, some of them restricted to vehicles with valid military or forestry permits. There are a few buildings remaining in these mountains, usually in lateral areas or at the most elevated points. As well as several hunting lodges, used by prominent visitors, hunters and forestry workers, these facilities include: * a Cold War military bunker, turned into an Atomic Weapons Museum. * the 194m tall Cukr√°k transmitter, a broadcasting and transmitting tower on the hill Cukr√°k, close to Prague. * , a baroque chapel of Mary Magdalene and monastery on the cliff above the town of Mn√≠≈°ek pod Brdy. * an abandoned Surface-to-Air Missile S-200 (SA-5 Gammon) base known as Klondajk, with three long-range SAM launchers spread over several square kilometers near the town of Dob≈ô√≠≈°. * a Geodetic tower 638m above sea level at Studen√Ω Vrch, near Hostomice pod Brdy, formerly used for military exercises, and currently under the ownership of the Czech Tourist Club. * a Czech air traffic control radar complex, 683m above sea level on the hill P√≠sek, near Jince. * a Meteorological radar belonging to the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (CHMI), 862m above sea level on Praha mountain, monitoring precipitation over Bohemia. This radar is a part of the European NEXRAD network. * a prototype concrete bunker, built in the 1930s at one of the shooting grounds to test weapon efficiency and bunker design, later featured in the Czech film The Elementary School. * a monument to prominent local forester and administrator Gangloff, near T≈ôem≈°√≠n pod Brdy.  Potential future developments  Several studies have been carried out on the future of the Brdy mountains, with particular focus on preserving its natural state. This was contradicted by government plans to create a new US high-security military installation in the military area. In late 2008, press reports indicated that the radar site would be about two kilometres northeast of Mi≈°ov, approximately at . A fierce public debate followed, with the majority of the media and the government supporting the project, and local residents and peace activists opposing it. Public opinion was divided, but a majority of Czechs were opposed. This debate became the focus of the Czech documentary comedy, Czech Peace (2010). In December 2014, the Czech parliament passed a law abolishing the military status of the Brdy mountains, which will come into effect in January 2016. There is an ongoing dispute, as the new legislation includes some other changes, including border changes between the Central Bohemian and Pilsen regions, with Pilsen Region taking over a significant area of the current Central Bohemian Region.

In 1995, Dworkin was awarded a Ph.D. in political philosophy from the Johns Hopkins University. He writes widely on topics where medical research intersects with political control, often focusing on what he sees as obsession with pushing happiness above all else. In other words, society likes to see unhappiness as a disease that must be stamped out with a mixture of drugs and denial. His book, Artificial Happiness published in 2006, lays out the dangers in the blind pursuit of happiness, arguing that it leads us to ignore or avoid some fundamental truths about life. Richard John Neuhaus wrote of the book, > A particular strength of Artificial Happiness is its treatment of the doping > of millions of children with Ritalin and other drugs. We are running the > grave risk of depriving the next generation of experiences that are > essential to growing up.

Florentine Codex, late 16th century. Aztec cuisine is the cuisine of the former Aztec Empire and the Nahua peoples of the Valley of Mexico prior to European contact in 1519. The most important staple was corn (maize), a crop that was so important to Aztec society that it played a central part in their mythology. Just like wheat in much of Europe or rice in most of East Asia, it was the food without which a meal was not a meal. It came in varieties that differed in color, texture, size and prestige, and was eaten as corn tortillas, tamales or ƒÅt≈çlli, maize gruel. The other constants of Aztec food were salt and chili peppers and the basic definition of Aztec fasting was to abstain from these two flavors. The other major foods were beans, squash and New World varieties of the grains amaranth (or pigweed), and chia. The combination of maize and these basic foods would have provided the average Aztec a very well-rounded diet without any significant deficiencies in vitamins or minerals. The cooking of maize grains in alkaline solutions, a process called nixtamalization, significantly raised the nutritional value of the common staple. Water, maize gruels and pulque (iztƒÅc octli), the fermented juice of the century plant (maguey in Spanish), were the most common drinks, and there were many different fermented alcoholic beverages made from honey, cacti and various fruits. The elite took pride in not drinking pulque, a drink of commoners, and preferred drinks made from cacao, among the most prestigious luxuries available. Favored by rulers, warriors and nobles, they were flavored with chili peppers, honey and a seemingly endless list of spices and herbs. The Aztec diet included a variety of fish and wild game: various fowl, pocket gophers, green iguanas, axolotls (a type of water salamander), a type of crayfish called acocil, and a great variety of insects, larvae and insect eggs. They also domesticated turkeys, duck and dogs as food and at times ate meat from larger wild animals such as deer, but none of these were a major part of their diet.Smith, Michael Ernest, The Aztecs Wiley Blackwell, 2nd ed. 2002, p.63 They ate various mushrooms and fungi, including the parasitic corn smut, which grows on ears of corn. Squash (also known as cucurbita) was very popular and came in many different varieties. Squash seeds, fresh, dried or roasted, were especially popular. Tomatoes, though different from the varieties common today, were often mixed with chili in sauces or as filling for tamales. Eating in Aztec culture could take on a sacred meaning, especially as evidenced in ritual cannibalism. The act of eating another human was deeply connected to the Aztec mythology, in which gods needed to consume the sacrificed flesh and blood of humans to sustain themselves, and the world. One way to look at this is that since human flesh was a food of the gods, it was sacred, and consuming sacred food could sanctify an individual and bring him or her closer to the gods. Further, certain warriors, in their afterlife, were believed to have been turned into butterflies and hummingbirds with the ability to fly back to the realm of the living to feed on nectar. From this, the importance the Aztecs ascribed to the act of eating is clear.Carrasco, 447-450 Meals Most sources describe two meals per day, though there is an account of labourers getting three meals, one at dawn, another one at around 9 in the morning and one at around 3 in the afternoon.Coe, 111 This is similar to the custom in contemporary Europe, but it is unclear if intake of ƒÅt≈çlli, maize gruel, was considered a meal or not. Drinking a good amount of the thicker kinds of ƒÅt≈çlli could equal the calories in several corn tortillas, and ƒÅt≈çlli was consumed on a daily basis by most of the population. Feasts Aztec men at a feast. Florentine Codex. Many accounts exist of Aztec feasts and banquets and the ceremony that surrounded them. Before a meal, servants presented fragrant tobacco tubes and sometimes also flowers with which the guests could rub their head, hands and neck. Before the meal would start each guest would drop a little food on the ground as an offering to the god Tlaltecuhtli. As military prowess was highly praised among the Aztecs, table manners imitated the movement of warriors. The smoking tubes and flowers went from the left hand of the servant to the right hand of the guest and the plate accompanying the smoking tube went from the right hand to the left hand. This was an imitation of how a warrior received his atlatl darts and shield. The flowers passed out bore different names depending on how they were handed out; \\"sword flowers\\" went from left hand to hand to left. When eating, guests would hold their individual bowls filled with dipping sauce in the center of the right hand and then dip corn tortillas or tamales (which were served from baskets) with the left. The meal was concluded by serving chocolate, often served in a calabash cup along with a stirring stick.Coe, 100-103 Men and women were separated at banquets and, though it is not entirely clear from the sources, it seems as if only men drank chocolate. The women would more likely have drunk pozolli (maize gruel from finely ground maize) or some type of pulque. Rich hosts could often receive guests sitting in rooms around an open courtyard similar to Middle Eastern caravanserai (or han in Turkish) and senior military men would perform dances. Festivities would begin at midnight and some would drink chocolate and eat hallucinogenic mushrooms so that they could tell about their experiences and visions to the other guests. Right before dawn singing commenced and offerings were burned and buried in the courtyard to ensure the fortune of the children of the hosts. At dawn, the remaining flowers, smoking tubes and food were given to the old and poor that had been invited, or to the servants. As with all other aspects of life, the Aztecs stressed the dual nature of all things, and toward the end of the banquet the host would be sternly reminded by his elders of his own mortality and that he should not be overcome with pride.Coe, 74-81 = Domestic feasts = Aztec private feasts included music singing, storytelling, dancing, incense burning, flowers, tobacco, offerings, and gift- giving. Aztec feasts were a display of material culture and wealth, notes by Friar Bernardino de Sahag√∫n and Friar Diego Dur√°n describe Aztec feasts as events where \\"everything was to be created in abundance\\". Feasts were organized to the point of ritual, there were roles and relationships displayed and reinforced. Hosts needed to meet the obligations of banqueting, in order not to \\"offend\\" their guests, and guests needed to reinforce the hosts' stature. There are multiple important events in Aztec society that called for feasts. Child naming ceremonies involved the ritual calling out of the baby's name and progressed into a large organized feast. This feast could consist of dressed bird or dog, meat and/or maize tamales, beans, cacao bean, and roasted chillis. Izcalli child presentation ceremonies were also important, part of the Aztec agricultural calendar. Izcalli was the last \\"month\\" of the calendar. Every fourth Izcalli celebration included the introduction of children, born during this four year period, to the Aztec community. This feast introduced the child to actions important to their religious life such as singing, dancing, ceremonial drinking, sacrificial bloodletting, and body modification. The food served during this feast was traditionally spicy. Noted by Sahagun was: \\"And the sauce of the tamales was called 'red chilli sauce'. And when the good common folk ate, they sat about sweating, they sat about burning themselves. And the tamales stuffed with greens were indeed hot, gleaming hot.\\" The wedding process also contained many ceremonies, the parents of a young male, when marriage was desired, had to ask permission of his calmecac school leaders. Part of this process was a feast of tamales, chocolate, and sauces. During the wedding itself, there were feasts of pulque, tamales, and turkey meat. Funerary feasts were also common among the wealthy class. Served at these feasts was octli (pulque), chocolate, bird, fruit, seeds, and other foods. = Public feasts = Parts of the 260-day ritual calendar of the Aztecs were veintena. Veintena can be approximated as \\"months\\"; however, they are more aptly described as 20-day public ceremony periods. Each 20-day veintena was a full and complex festival made up of ceremonies dedicated to specific gods and deities of the current veintena. Regional and local ceremonies differed in deities and methods from the official state-sponsored ones at Tenochtitlan. Food was an important part of veintena ceremonies; it was both consumed and adorned by priests. It was noted that during the ceremonies honoring Xipe Totec the priests would adorn themselves in arrays of \\"butterfly nets, fish banners, ear of maize, coyote heads made of amaranth seed, tortillas, thick rolls covered with a dough of amaranth seeds, toasted maize, red amaranth, and maize stalks with ears of green or tender maize.\\" In the ceremonies honouring Mixcoatl, after a \\"great hunt,\\" Aztecs would feast on deer, rabbit, and all other animals killed in the hunt. Hunting was also important to celebrations dedicated to Xiuhtecuhtli when Aztec boys and young men would hunt for ten days. The products of these hunts would then be turned over to priests, who cooked them in large fire flies. Food preparation The main method of preparation was boiling or steaming in two-handled clay pots or jars called xoctli in Nahuatl and translated into Spanish as olla (\\"pot\\"). Ceramics were vital to the cooking process and served at least three major purposes: nixtamal preparation, tamale steaming, and cooking beans, stews, and hot beverages.Rodr√≠guez-Alegr√≠a, 101 The xoctli was filled with food and heated over a fire. It could also be used to steam food by pouring a little water into the xoctli and then placing tamales wrapped in maize husks on a light structure of twigs in the middle of the pot.Coe, 109 Tortillas, tamales, casseroles and the sauces that went with them were the most common dishes. Chili and salt were both ubiquitous and the most basic meal was usually just corn tortillas that were dipped in chilis that had been ground in a mortar with a little water. Dough could be used to encase meat, sometimes even whole turkeys, before cooking. In major Aztec towns and cities there were vendors that sold street food of all kinds, catering to both the rich and poor. Other than ingredients and prepared food every imaginable type of ƒÅt≈çlli could be bought, either to quench one's thirst or as an instant meal in liquid form.Coe, 149; 117-19 Women, in charge of domestic duties in Aztec societies, were also the cooks.Rodr√≠guez-Alegr√≠a, p. 99 Generally, men did not directly participate in cooking. Based on where cooking tools are usually found, it seems that kitchens were a simple, single-room structure separate from the house itself. Most cooking probably took place on a small triangular hearth in the kitchen.Rodr√≠guez-Alegr√≠a, 100  Kitchen tools  Most information regarding Aztec cooking tools comes from finding the tools themselves, as depictions of the tools in art are rare, and when they are featured, they aren't particularly prominent or detailed. Luckily, tools were most often made of stone and ceramics and as such can be found in large quantities in good condition for study. Manos and metates were the tools of choice for grinding nixtamalized maize (nixtamal). It was also used to grind sauce ingredients like peppers, though different sets of manos and metates would likely have been used to avoid getting other flavors in maize dough (masa). The metate is a stone slab that can be slightly concave. Nixtamal was placed on top of the metate and the mano, effectively a rough cylindrical stone, was rolled over it, grinding the nixtamal. The mano and metate is a tool that would have been used every day, since ground nixtamal usually goes bad within a day. Ethnographies of 20th century indigenous communities seem to indicate that women could have spent between four and eight hours a day at a metate grinding nixtamal, but women in a 2007 study at Xaltocan insisted that an experienced woman could grind all she needed for the day in only an hour; regardless, use of a metate for grinding is considered tedious work.Rodr√≠guez-Alegr√≠a, 102Rodr√≠guez-Alegr√≠a, 108-109 The mano and metate remained as the grinding tool of choice in central Mexico, as it tends to grind finer than European- style mills, and tortillas made from masa ground on a mano and metate are still considered of a higher quality, if much more labor-intensive.Rodr√≠guez- Alegr√≠a, 111 However, some argue that the reason women used to and still do grind nixtamal by hand is because it was a way for men to limit the amount of free time women have in an effort to prevent extramarital affairs.Bauer, Arnold J. 1990. Millers and Grinders: Technology and Household Economy in Mesoamerica. Agricultural History 64 (1):1‚Äì17. The molcajete is another grinding tool. It is a bowl made of porous basalt rock, and an accompanying basalt cylinder was used to grind foods into the molcajete. It looks and functions very similarly to a western mortar and pestle. The fact that a molcajete will hold whatever is prepared in it means it would have been ideal for preparing sauces that would spill off the sides of a metate, and molcajetes could also be used as serving vessels.Rodr√≠guez-Alegr√≠a, 104 Comals are a type of ceramic griddle with a smooth top and a porous bottom used for cooking various types of tortillas, as well as for non-maize foods like peppers and roasted squash. It is possible that comales could also have been used as makeshift pot lids for the sake of convenience. There are several references to frying in the accounts of Spanish chroniclers, but the only specification of the Aztec type of frying appears to be some kind of cooking that was done with syrup, not cooking fat. This is corroborated by the fact that no evidence for large-scale extraction of vegetable oils exist and that no cooking vessels suited for frying have been found by archaeologists.Coe, 36 Foods Spirulina could be harvested off the surface of lakes with nets or shovels and was then dried as cakes which could be eaten with corn tortilla or as a condiment. This drawing is a remake of the corn tortilla glyph found in the Codex MendozaMursell, I. (n.d.). Aztec children's clothes. Mexicalore. Retrieved September 8, 2012, from link Aztec staple foods included maize, beans and squash to which were often added chilis, nopales and tomatoes, all prominent parts of the Mexican diet to this day. They harvested acocils, a small and abundant crayfish of Lake Texcoco, as well as Spirulina algae, which was made into a sort of cake called tecuitlatl and was rich in flavonoids.Cowgill, George L. 2001. \\"Central Mexico Classic.\\" In Encyclopedia of Prehistory: Volume 5: Middle America, edited by Peter N. Peregrine and Melvin Ember, 25. Boston, MA: Springer US. doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-0525-9_2. Although the Aztecs' diet was mostly vegetarian, the Aztecs consumed insects such as grasshoppers chapul√≠n (singular) or chapulines (plural), maguey worm, ants, larvae, etc. Insects have a higher protein content than meat, and even now they are considered a delicacy in some parts of Mexico.Ortiz de Montellano, 102-106 Cereals An Aztec woman blowing on maize before putting in the cooking pot, so that it will not \\"fear the fire\\". Florentine Codex, late 16th century. Maize was the single most important staple of the Aztecs. It was consumed at every meal by all social classes, and played a central role in Aztec mythology. To some of the first Europeans, the Aztecs described maize as \\"precious, our flesh, our bones\\".Coe, 89 It came in a vast number of varieties of various sizes, shapes and colors; yellow, reddish, white with stripes of color, black, with or without speckles and a blue-husked variant that was considered to be particularly precious. Other local and regional varieties must have also existed but few were recorded. Maize was revered to such an extent that women blew on maize before putting it into the cooking pot so that it would not fear the fire, and any maize that was dropped on the ground was picked up rather than being wasted. One of the Aztec informants of the Spanish Franciscan missionary and chronicler Bernardino de Sahag√∫n explained the practice in the following way: A process called nixtamalization was used all over America where maize was the staple. The word is a compound of the Nahuatl words nextli (\\"ashes\\") and tamalli (\\"unformed corn dough; tamal\\"), and the process is still in use today. Dry maize grain is soaked and cooked in an alkaline solution, usually limewater. This releases the pericarp, the outer hull of the grains and makes the maize easier to grind. The process transforms maize from a simple source of carbohydrates into a considerably more complete nutritional package; it increases the amount of calcium, iron, copper, zinc that are added through the alkalide or the vessel used in the process and niacin, riboflavin and more protein already present in the corn that is not digestible to humans are made available through the process.Cambridge World History of Food, 108-110 The inhibited growth of certain mycotoxins (toxic fungi) is another benefit of nixtamalization. If the processed maize, the nextamalli, is allowed to ferment, further nutrients, including amino acids such as lysine and tryptophan are made available. Together with beans, vegetables, fruit, chilis and salt nixtamalized corn can form a healthy and diverse diet. Spices A great number of herbs and spices were available to the Aztecs in seasoning food. Among the most important, chili peppers come in a wide variety of species and cultivars, some domesticated and many of them wild. These included a great range of heat intensity depending on the amount of capsaicin present, with some being mild and others being very piquant. The chilis were often dried and ground for storage and use in cooking, some roasted beforehand to impart different tastes. Flavors varied significantly from one type to another, including sweet, fruity, earthy, smoky, and fiery hot. Native species of plants used as seasonings produced flavors similar to Old World spices that often proved to be more easily accessible in cooking after the Spanish conquest. Culantro or Mexican coriander provides a much stronger flavor than its Old World parallel, cilantro, and its leaves can be easier to dry. Mexican oregano and Mexican anise likewise produce flavors reminiscent of their Mediterranean counterparts, while allspice has an aroma somewhere in between nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon. The bark of canella or white cinnamon has a soft, delicate flavor that might have eased the acceptance of the more pungent cinnamon of Ceylon into modern Mexican cuisine. Before the arrival of onions and garlic, subtler but similar wild plants such as Kunth's onion and other southern- ranging species of the genus Allium, as well as the fragrant leaves of garlic vine may have been appropriated. Other flavorings available included mesquite, vanilla, achiote, epazote, hoja santa, popcorn flower, avocado leaf, and other indigenous plants. Drink A painting from Codex Mendoza showing an elderly Aztec woman drinking pulque.  Alcohol  Many different alcoholic beverages were made from fermented maize, honey, pineapple, cactus fruit and other plants. The most common was octli which was made from maguey sap. It is today known as pulque, an Antillean term. It was drunk by all social classes, though some nobles made a point of not downing such a humble beverage. Drinking was tolerated, even for children at some occasions, but becoming intoxicated was not. The penalties could be very stiff, and were stricter for the elite.Coe, 84-87 The first transgression of a commoner would be punished by tearing his house down and sending him off to live in the field like an animal. A noble would generally not get a second chance and could be executed for overindulging in alcohol. Getting intoxicated appeared to have been more tolerated for elderly people; Spanish translations of the Codex Mendoza note that there were specific circumstances that allowed the elderly to get intoxicated: > It is shown how, according to the laws and customs of the lose of seventy > years of age, man or woman, if such old persons had children or > grandchildren. These had license and freedom to use it. This did not prevent the occasional tragedy of nobles who became alcoholics and drank themselves into poverty, squalor and an early death. An informant of Sahag√∫n told the sad story of a former tlacateccatl, a general and commander of over 8,000 troops: ƒÄt≈çle ƒÄt≈çle (), maize gruel, accounted for a considerable amount of the daily calorie intake. The basic recipe for ƒÅt≈çle was eight parts water and six parts maize with lime that was cooked until it softened and then ground. The mixture was then boiled until it thickened. There were many variations of ƒÅt≈çle: a mixture of 1/10 maguey syrup made nequƒÅt≈çle; adding chili ground with salt and tomato would make iztac ƒÅt≈çle; letting maize dough sour for 4‚Äì5 days and then adding more fresh dough with chili and salt would make xocoƒÅt≈çle. Beans, baked corn tortillas with the crust cut off, toasted maize, chia, amaranth and honey could also be added and there was pinolli, ground toasted maize that was carried by travelers in sacks which could be mixed with water on the road for an instant meal.Coe, 117-118 Cacao Cacao had immense symbolic value. It was a rare luxury and an import that could not be grown within the boundaries of the Aztec Empire. There are no detailed descriptions of how cacao solids were prepared, but there are a number of allusions to the fact that it was eaten in some form. Cacao beans were among the most valuable commodities and could be used as a form of payment, although of somewhat low value; 80-100 beans could be used to buy a small mantle or a canoe-full of fresh water if one lived on the salty part of the lakes around Tenochtitlan. Nevertheless, beans were frequently counterfeited by filling empty cacao shells with dirt or mud. Cacao was commonly drunk as cacahuatl, \\"cacao water\\", and was the beverage of warriors and nobles. It was considered a potent intoxicant and something that was drunk with great solemnity and gravity and was described as something \\"not drunk unthinkingly\\" by the Spanish chronicler Sahag√∫n. Chocolate could be prepared in a huge variety of ways and most of them involved mixing hot or tepid water with toasted and ground cacao beans, maize and any number of flavorers such as chili, honey, vanilla and a wide variety of spices.The full list of cacao flavorers is very extensive, but some of the common ones were uei nacaztli (Cymbopetalum penduliflorum); teonacaztli (Chiranthodendron pentadactylon), which had the flavor of \\"black pepper with a resinous bitterness\\" and was commonly used at banquets; mecaxochitl (Piper amalgo), a relation of black pepper; yolloxochitl (the flower of Magnolia mexicana) which had the taste of ripe melon; piztle (the seeds of Calocarpum mammosum), with the flavor of bitter almonds; pochotl (the seeds of Ceipa spp.), described as \\"sweet and tasty\\"; and allspice. One of the most common recipes consisted of mecaxochitl, uei nacaztli, vanilla, softened maize and cacao mixed with tepid water, and was drunk immediately after preparation. The ingredients were mixed and beaten with a beating stick or aerated by pouring the chocolate from one vessel to another. If the cacao was of high quality, this produced a rich head of foam. The head could be set aside, the drink further aerated to produce another head, which was also set aside and then placed on top of the drink along with the rest of the foam before serving. Dietary norms The Aztecs stressed moderation in all aspects of life. European authors and chroniclers were often impressed by what they perceived as exemplary frugality, simplicity and moderation. Juan de Palafox y Mendoza, the bishop of Puebla and viceroy of New Spain in the 1640s reported: Fasting The primary meaning of an Aztec fast was to abstain from salt and chilis and all members of Aztec society engaged in fasting to some extent. There were no regular exceptions from the fast, something that shocked the first Europeans who came into contact with the Aztecs. Though fasting was common in Europe, there were permanent exceptions for the women and small children, the sick or frail and the elderly. Before the New Fire ceremony, which occurred every 52 years, some priests fasted for a whole year; the other priests 80 days and lords 8 days.Coe, 83-84 Commoners engaged in fasts, but less rigorously. There was also a permanent contingent of fasters in Tehuacan. Along with various ascetic rigors like sleeping on a stone pillow, they fasted for periods of four years on one 50-gram corn tortilla (about 2 ounces) per day. The only respite came every 20 days, when they were allowed to eat whatever they wanted. Even rulers such as Moctezuma were expected to cut down on their otherwise luxurious lifestyle and did so with considerable conviction and effort. At times he abstained from luxuries and sex with women and ate only cakes of michihuauhtli and seeds of amaranth or goosefoot. The lord's chocolate was also replaced with water mixed from parched bean powder. This can be contrasted with the fasts of many European nobles and clergy that, while obeying the letter of the religious regulation by replacing meat and animal products with fish, were still luxurious feasts in their own right.Coe, 70 During the fourteenth month, called Quecholli, ceremonies in honor of the hunting god Mixcoatl there would be a large hunt as part of the ritual. To prepare for the hunt Aztecs would fast for five days. The fasting was done, according to Sahagun, \\"for the deer, so that it would be a successful hunt.\\" During the celebrations of the god Tezcatlipoca, his priests fasted for ten, five, or seven days continuously before the main feasts. They were known as \\"those who do penance.\\" During celebrations of Huitzilopoctli it was noted by Friar Duran: \\"I have been assured that they became so weak because of the terrible eight-day fast that for another eight days they were not themselves, nor were they satisfied with eating. Many became gravely ill, and the lives of many pregnant women were in danger.\\" During festivals in honor of Chicomecoatl, there would be a drastic back and forth of gorging and fasting. So much so that people would become ill.  Food and politics  Bernal Diaz del Castillo comments on how the ruler of Tenochtitlan was served food: > His cooks had more than thirty styles of dishes made according to their > fashion and usage, and they put them on small low clay braziers so that they > would not get cold ... if it was cold they made him a fire of glowing coals > made from the bark of certain trees ... the odor of the bark ... was most > fragrant ... they put the tablecloths of white fabric ... They served him on > Cholula pottery, some red and some black ... and from time to time they > brought him some cups of fine gold, with a certain drink made of cacao. Sahagun provides a list of the different types of tlaquetzalli, a chocolate drink served to Aztec lords: > The ruler was served his chocolate, with which he finished [his repast] - > green, made of tender cacao; honeyed chocolate made with ground-up dried > flowers - with green vanilla pods; bright red chocolate; orange-colored > chocolate; rose-colored chocolate; black chocolate; white chocolate.\\" Aztec expansion was targeted in ways to gain or maintain access to foodstuffs need for ceremony and everyday life. The leader's ability to acquire food needed for ritual was important for his political success. Cannibalism A scene depicting ritualistic cannibalism being practiced in the Codex Magliabechiano, folio 73r. The Aztecs practiced ritualistic cannibalism. Victims, usually prisoners of war, were sacrificed in public on top of temples and pyramids by cutting out their hearts. The bodies were then thrown down to the ground where they were dismembered. The pieces were then distributed to the elite, which were mostly warriors and priests. The meat was consumed in the form of stews flavored only with salt and eaten with corn tortillas, but without the otherwise ubiquitous chili.Ortiz de Montellano, 85-86 The veintena Tlacaxipehualiztli was one of intense human sacrifice, it was noted by Sahagun that \\"it was the time when all captives died, all those taken, all those who were made captive, the men, the women, all the children.\\" It began with the sacrifice of captured warriors, the flesh of the sacrificed warriors would be taken to the residence of the Aztec who had captured the warrior. The capturer was forbidden to feast on the flesh of the sacrificed, however his family would eat it. A stew called tlacatlaolli was prepared out of dried maize and into each serving would be placed a piece of the flesh of the captive. In the late 1970s the anthropologist Michael Harner suggested that the Aztecs had resorted to large-scale, organized cannibalism to make up for a supposed protein deficiency in the diet. This idea gained limited support from some scholars, but has been shown to be based on unfounded assumptions about eating habits, agriculture and demographics, making it a highly unlikely scenario.

The project comprises a number of strands that support study of this period of British theatre history, as well as an opportunity to analyse and debate findings through a blog. The Archives Strand The Archives strand has enabled listings to be compiled for four major theatre archives in the British Library Manuscripts Collections. Fully searchable listings are accessible for the archives of Sir John Gielgud, Cedric Hardwicke, Sir Ralph Richardson and Michel Saint-Denis, and each description is preceded by a full biographical introduction prepared by an expert in the field. Manuscript material identified from the listings can be consulted in the Manuscripts Reading Room at the British Library. The Scripts Strand The Scripts strand aims to recover play scripts performed in any licensed British venue after 1968 that were never deposited in the British Library, as stipulated by the Theatres Act 1968 that ended the Lord Chamberlain's power to pre-censor theatre. Between September 2004 and April 2005 over 1,000 missing scripts were identified from fewer than 100 theatres. To date, nearly 300 of these play scripts have been recovered and deposited within the British Library Manuscripts Collections. Further information is available in 'Following the Script' by Kate Dorney. The Oral History Strand The Oral History strand began in November 2003, and aims to interview as many people as possible who visited or worked in the theatre between 1945 and 1968. The original recordings may be consulted via the British Library Archival Sound Recordings where full, searchable transcripts are available. Over 250 interviews have been added to the site, and interviewees include Frith Banbury, Michael Frayn, Trevor Griffiths, Glenda Jackson, Ann Jellicoe, Ian McDiarmid, Peter Nichols, Corin Redgrave, Arnold Wesker, Timothy West. The Blog The Blog was launched at the 'More than just Osborne?' conference, held at the British Library in September 2006. It allows students, researchers, and theatre lovers to address and debate some of the findings of the Theatre Archive Project, and to share views and opinions of the post-War British theatre scene. Recent posts include discussion of Joe Orton, Harold Pinter, and Bertolt Brecht. Further reading *Shellard, D & S. Nicholson & M.

The technology uses computer vision and gesture recognition to process images taken by the camera. This allows players to interact with games using motion and color detection as well as sound through its built-in microphone array. It is the successor to the EyeToy for the PlayStation 2, which was released in 2003. The peripheral was launched in a bundle with The Eye of Judgment in the United States on October 23, 2007, in Japan and Australia on October 25, 2007 and in Europe on October 26, 2007. The PlayStation Eye was also released as a stand-alone product in the United States, Europe, and Australia. EyeToy designer Richard Marks stated that the EyeToy was used as a model for the rough cost design. The device is succeeded by PlayStation Camera for PlayStation 4.  Features =Camera The PlayStation Eye is capable of capturing standard video with frame rates of 60 hertz at a 640√ó480 pixel resolution, and 120 hertz at 320√ó240 pixels, which is \\"four times the resolution\\" and \\"two times the frame-rate\\" of the EyeToy, according to Sony. Higher frame rate, up to 320√ó240@187 or 640√ó480@75 fps, can be selected by specific applications (Freetrack and Linuxtrack). The PlayStation Eye also has \\"two times the sensitivity\\" of the EyeToy, with Sony collaborating with sensor chip partner OmniVision Technologies on a sensor chip design using larger sensor pixels, allowing more effective low-light operation. Sony states that the PlayStation Eye can produce \\"reasonable quality video\\" under the illumination provided by a television set. The camera features a two-setting adjustable fixed-focus zoom lens. Selected manually by rotating the lens barrel, the PlayStation Eye can be set to a 56¬∞ field of view (red dot) similar to that of the EyeToy, for close-up framing in chat applications, or a 75¬∞ field of view (blue dot) for long-shot framing in interactive physical gaming applications. The PlayStation Eye is capable of outputting video to the console uncompressed, with \\"no compression artifacts\\"; or with optional JPEG compression. 8 bits per pixel is the sensor native color depth. Microphone The PlayStation Eye features a built-in four-capsule microphone array, with which the PlayStation 3 can employ technologies for multi-directional voice location tracking, echo cancellation, and background noise suppression. This allows the peripheral to be used for speech recognition and audio chat in noisy environments without the use of a headset. The PlayStation Eye microphone array operates with each channel processing 16-bit samples at a sampling rate of 48 kilohertz, and a signal-to-noise ratio of 90 decibels. Applications Like its predecessor, the EyeToy, the PlayStation Eye enables natural user interface and mixed reality video game applications through the use of computer vision (CV) and gesture recognition technologies implemented in the software. Though initial PlayStation Eye software has mostly been based on the same general techniques as the EyeToy (e.g. simple edge detection and color tracking, Digimask face mapping), since the announcement of the forthcoming camera-based PlayStation Move and Kinect (then known as \\"Project Natal\\") control systems at the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo, Sony has been promoting a number of other technologies available for the PlayStation Eye. Among these are the Vision Library, which can perform advanced facial recognition/analysis and CV-based head tracking, and PSVR (PlayStation Voice Recognition), a speech recognition library intended to support about 20 different languages. According to Sony; the facial technology can identify features such as eyes, mouth, eyebrows, nose, and eyeglasses; read the shape of the mouth and detect a smile;See facial expression capture. determine the position and orientation of the subject's head; and estimate the age and gender of the face. In addition to gaming- oriented uses, Sony has stated that the PlayStation Eye will also feature applications for tasks such as interactive communication and content creation (e.g. movie-making and video blogging). An AV Chat feature allows for audio- visual chat with anyone on a user's PlayStation Network friends list (up to six at once). Additional free content and activities are planned for release via the PlayStation Network. =EyeCreate= The PlayStation Eye features free EyeCreate video editing software, which enables users to capture pictures, video, and audio clips directly to the hard drive of the PlayStation 3 console. EyeCreate features a variety of different capturing modes, including stop motion and time-lapse. Through the software, users can edit, save, and share their own custom images, movies, and audio content. Videos created using the program can be exported as MPEG-4 files for use outside PlayStation 3 consoles. =PlayStation Move= First revealed on June 2, 2009, PlayStation Move is a motion control system for the PlayStation 3 based on video tracking and inertial sensors. Based on a wand controller, PlayStation Move uses the PlayStation Eye to track the wand's position in three dimensions through a special illuminated orb at the end.

It tells the story of Gimpel, a simple bread maker who is the butt of many of his town's jokes. It also gives its name to the collection first published in 1957. David Roskies has put forward the view that the story constitutes a modernist revision of a story by Nachman of Bratslav. The Collection The 1957 collection contains the following stories: * Gimpel the Fool * The Gentleman from Cracow * The Wife Killer * By the Light of Memorial Candles * The Mirror * The Little Shoemakers - Tells the tale of a long line of modest shoemakers in Frampol. Focusing on one age in the line, this story tells the tale of Abba's 7 sons leaving the homeland and emigrating to America in a dynamic time. * Joy * From the Diary of One Not Born * The Old Man * Fire * The Unseen The Unseen The Unseen is all about desires and how far a person is willing to go to get what they desire, even at the expense of others they care about Characters Elka Elka, who is known as the town prostitute, marries Gimpel when he agrees to get the town to take up a collection to raise a dowry for her. She is five months pregnant by another man when they are married, but she tells Gimpel the child is his and, when it arrives four months after their marriage, that it is simply premature. Throughout the story Elka commits numerous infidelities and eventually has six children, none of whom are Gimpel's. On her deathbed she admits her infidelities to her husband and asks him to forgive her. The Spirit of Evil The devil appears to Gimpel the baker and tells him to urinate in the bread intended for the village in order to get revenge for the many injustices the villagers have forced him to endure over the years. He does so, but is scolded by the spirit of his deceased wife. He destroys the tainted bread and becomes a homeless wandering shoemaker; at night he talks with the spirit of Elka.

This is a list of the bird species recorded in Colombia. According to the South American Classification Committee (SACC) of the American Ornithological Society (AOS), the avifauna of Colombia has 1851 confirmed species. Of them, 81 are endemic, three have been introduced by humans, and 62 are rare or vagrants. One of the endemic species is believed to be extinct. An additional 37 species are hypothetical (see below).Remsen, J. V., Jr., J. I. Areta, E. Bonaccorso, S. Claramunt, A. Jaramillo, J. F. Pacheco, C. Ribas, M. B. Robbins, F. G. Stiles, D. F.

American Ornithological Society. http://www.museum.lsu.edu/~Remsen/SACCBaseline.htm retrieved July 29, 2020 The Colombian province of San Andr√©s and Providencia is much closer to Nicaragua than to the South American mainland, so the SACC does not address records there. A 2015 publication adds 17 species whose only Colombian records are from that province and also five species to the mainland list.

The symbols and their meanings, in increasing order of peril, are: = Data deficient = Near threatened = Vulnerable = Endangered = Critically endangered = Extinct Tinamous Order: TinamiformesFamily: Tinamidae The tinamous are one of the most ancient groups of bird. Although they look similar to other ground- dwelling birds like quail and grouse, they have no close relatives and are classified as a single family, Tinamidae, within their own order, the Tinamiformes. They are distantly related to the ratites (order Struthioniformes), that includes the rheas, emus, and kiwis. Seventeen species have been recorded in Colombia. *Tawny-breasted tinamou, Nothocercus julius *Highland tinamou, Nothocercus bonapartei *Gray tinamou, Tinamus tao *Black tinamou, Tinamus osgoodi *Great tinamou, Tinamus major *White-throated tinamou, Tinamus guttatus *Berlepsch's tinamou, Crypturellus berlepschi *Cinereous tinamou, Crypturellus cinereus *Little tinamou, Crypturellus soui *Brown tinamou, Crypturellus obsoletus *Undulated tinamou, Crypturellus undulatus *Gray-legged tinamou, Crypturellus duidae *Red-legged tinamou, Crypturellus erythropus *Choco tinamou, Crypturellus kerriae *Variegated tinamou, Crypturellus variegatus *Rusty tinamou, Crypturellus brevirostris (H) *Barred tinamou, Crypturellus casiquiare Screamers Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anhimidae The screamers are a small family of birds related to the ducks. They are large, bulky birds, with a small downy head, long legs, and large feet which are only partially webbed. They have large spurs on their wings which are used in fights over mates and in territorial disputes. Two species have been recorded in Colombia. *Horned screamer, Anhima cornuta *Northern screamer, Chauna chavaria Ducks Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating. Twenty-five species have been recorded in Colombia. *Fulvous whistling-duck, Dendrocygna bicolor *White- faced whistling-duck, Dendrocygna viduata *Black-bellied whistling-duck, Dendrocygna autumnalis *Orinoco goose, Oressochen jubata *Muscovy duck, Cairina moschata *Comb duck, Sarkidiornis sylvicola *Brazilian teal, Amazonetta brasiliensis *Torrent duck, Merganetta armata *Puna teal, Spatula puna (H) *Northern shoveler, Spatula clypeata *Blue-winged teal, Spatula discors *Cinnamon teal, Spatula cyanoptera *Gadwall, Mareca strepera (SA) *American wigeon, Mareca americana *White-cheeked pintail, Anas bahamensis *Northern pintail, Anas acuta *Yellow-billed pintail, Anas georgica *Green- winged teal, Anas crecca (V) *Andean teal, Anas andium *Southern pochard, Netta erythrophthalma *Ring-necked duck, Aythya collaris (V) *Lesser scaup, Aythya affinis *Masked duck, Nomonyx dominicus *Ruddy duck, Oxyura jamaicensis *Red-breasted merganser, Mergus serrator (SA) Guans Order: GalliformesFamily: Cracidae The Cracidae are large birds, similar in general appearance to turkeys. The guans and curassows live in trees, but the smaller chachalacas are found in more open scrubby habitats. They are generally dull- plumaged, but the curassows and some guans have colorful facial ornaments. Colombia has the largest number of cracids of any country; twenty-six have been recorded there. *Sickle-winged guan, Chamaepetes goudotii *Band-tailed guan, Penelope argyrotis *Baudo guan, Penelope ortoni *Andean guan, Penelope montagnii *Spix's guan, Penelope jacquacu *Crested guan, Penelope purpurascens *Cauca guan, Penelope perspicax (E) *Blue-throated piping-guan, Pipile cumanensis *Wattled guan, Aburria aburri *Gray-headed chachalaca, Ortalis cinereiceps *Chestnut-winged chachalaca, Ortalis garrula (E) *Rufous-vented chachalaca, Ortalis ruficauda *Rufous-headed chachalaca, Ortalis erythroptera *Colombian chachalaca, Ortalis columbiana (E) *Speckled chachalaca, Ortalis guttata *Variable chachalaca, Ortalis motmot (H) *Nocturnal curassow, Nothocrax urumutum *Great curassow, Crax rubra *Blue-billed curassow, Crax alberti (E) *Yellow-knobbed curassow, Crax daubentoni *Black curassow, Crax alector *Wattled curassow, Crax globulosa *Crestless curassow, Mitu tomentosa *Salvin's curassow, Mitu salvini *Razor-billed curassow, Mitu tuberosa *Helmeted curassow, Pauxi pauxi New World quails Order: GalliformesFamily: Odontophoridae The New World quails are small, plump terrestrial birds only distantly related to the quails of the Old World, but named for their similar appearance and habits.

record producer who was the owner of leading independent label Beserkley Records in Berkeley, California from the mid-1970s through the mid-1980s, successfully producing records by Jonathan Richman, Greg Kihn and others. Biography Born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland, Kaufman graduated from law school but never took the bar. Instead, convinced they were to be the next Beatles, Kaufman went to California to co-manage the San Francisco rock band Earth Quake. He helped the band get a two-record deal with A&M; Records in 1970, and picked up production tips from Lou Adler and Glyn Johns. Also while at A&M;, Kaufman helped organize the series of demos recorded by The Modern Lovers. These recordings were unreleased at the time, but would later form the basis of their acclaimed debut album. The Beserkley Years (1973-1984) After becoming frustrated with A&M;, Kaufman decided to set up his own label in 1973. Beserkley Records (headquartered at John Doukas' house at 1199 Spruce St. in Berkeley, California). The first releases from the label, ignored in the United States, were embraced in the U.K. with Roadrunner reaching #11 on the UK singles chart. The follow-up single Egyptian Reggae reached #5 in the UK singles chart in 1977. By 1975, the label had an artist roster consisting of Earth Quake, Jonathan Richman (with and without the Modern Lovers), The Rubinoos and Greg Kihn. Kaufman co-produced album releases by all these artists, as well as acquiring the rights to the 1972 A&M; Modern Lovers recordings, which were issued as an album in 1976. Beserkley also released singles and compilation tracks by a handful of other artists. Buoyed by these successes, Kaufman opened a short-lived UK office of Beserkley, headquartered in Kingston-upon-Thames. They signed The Tyla Gang who released two albums in the US and the UK for the label, as well as The Smirks, who released two singles on Beserkley in the UK. In addition to his duties as label owner and producer, Kaufman occasionally co-wrote songs with various Beserkley acts under the pseudonym \\"Rose Bimler\\". Kaufman was also an occasional recording artist for Beserkley, releasing singles under the names \\"Son of Pete\\" and \\"Count Slowly and the Four Twenties\\". By the end of 1980, the only artist on Beserkley was Greg Kihn, who between 1981 and 1983 released three US top 40 albums and two US top 40 singles: \\"The Breakup Song (They Don't Write 'Em)\\" (#15, 1981), and \\"Jeopardy\\" (#2, 1983). All were produced by Kaufman. However, after a long run of success, Kihn's 1984 album Kihntagious was a comparative flop, and Kaufman essentially shut down Beserkley. He blamed the label's demise on \\"corporate rock\\": \\"When marketing costs surpassed production budgets, it stopped being fun,\\" he later said in an interview for a 2004 Beserkley label compilation. Later career (1985-present) Kaufman followed Kihn to EMI, where he remained Kihn's producer for his two EMI albums. He licensed some of the Beserkley Records catalogue to Rhino Records in 1986. He also continued to act as an occasional talent scout/producer, discovering Ed Haynes and producing his 1989 debut Ed Haynes Sings Ed Haynes for Apache Records. In 1991, Kaufman co-founded Eastern Light Productions, producing a series of award winning Russian historical documentaries in collaboration with the Soviet Filmmakers' Society, Kinocenter. In 1996, he launched the Son Of Beserkley label. In 2008, Kaufman launched a new label, Fun Fun Fun Recordings. Their first release was a compilation called \\"MP3 Jackpot Winners\\" which features songs discovered via the MP3 Jackpot website. Other 2008 Fun Fun Fun releases include \\"Skankin' Foolz Unite!\\" by Berkeley ska band, the Uptones, and \\"Repulsa\\" by metal goth act Repulsa. In 2009, Fun Fun Fun released CDs by Sex 4 Moderns, Hobo, and Stiff Richards, all produced by Kaufman. In 2009, Kaufman commissioned the construction of a Ska Shrine devoted to skanking. Musashi \\"Moose\\" Lethridge and Eric Din of the Uptones built the shrine which now resides virtually at the Ska4u website. The shrine traveled with The Uptones for four dates in June, 2010, for The Warped Tour and is available to the public for dancing.Vans Warped Tour 2010 ReferencesExternal links *Ska 4U  Ska Shrine *Fun Fun Fun Recordings Category:Living people Category:1946 births Category:American music industry executives Category:Record producers from California Category:Record producers from Maryland Category:Businesspeople from Baltimore Category:Businesspeople from the San Francisco Bay Area ","title":"Matthew King Kaufman"},{"id":"10910076","text":"The Venezuelan troupial is the national bird of Venezuela. This is a list of the bird species recorded in Venezuela.

They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to- body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. One species has been recorded in Venezuela. *Magnificent frigatebird, Fregata magnificens Boobies Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. Three species have been recorded in Venezuela. *Masked booby, Sula dactylatra *Red-footed booby, Sula sula *Brown booby, Sula leucogaster Anhingas Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Anhingas are often called \\"snake-birds\\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape, and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. One species has been recorded in Venezuela. *Anhinga, Anhinga anhinga Cormorants Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags.

Found in tropical woodlands worldwide, they feed on insects and fruit, and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly any distance. Trogons have soft, often colorful, feathers with distinctive male and female plumage. Twelve species have been recorded Venezuela. *Pavonine quetzal, Pharomachrus pavoninus *Golden-headed quetzal, Pharomachrus auriceps *White-tipped quetzal, Pharomachrus fulgidus *Crested quetzal, Pharomachrus antisianus *Black-tailed trogon, Trogon melanurus *Green-backed trogon, Trogon viridis *Gartered trogon, Trogon caligatus *Amazonian trogon, Trogon ramonianus *Guianan trogon, Trogon violaceus *Black-throated trogon, Trogon rufus *Collared trogon, Trogon collaris *Masked trogon, Trogon personatus Motmots Order: CoraciiformesFamily: Momotidae The motmots have colorful plumage and long, graduated tails which they display by waggling back and forth. In most of the species, the barbs near the ends of the two longest (central) tail feathers are weak and fall off, leaving a length of bare shaft and creating a racket-shaped tail. Two species have been recorded in Venezuela. *Whooping motmot, Momotus subrufescens *Amazonian motmot, Momotus momota Kingfishers Order: CoraciiformesFamily: Alcedinidae Kingfishers are medium-sized birds with large heads, long, pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails.

Bonaccorso, S. Claramunt, A. Jaramillo, J. F. Pacheco, C. Ribas, M. B. Robbins, F. G. Stiles, D. F. Stotz, and K. J. Zimmer. Version 28 July 2020. A classification of the bird species of South America. American Ornithological Society. http://www.museum.lsu.edu/~Remsen/SACCBaseline.htm retrieved July 29, 2020 The list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families, and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) are also those of the SACC. The following tags have been used to highlight certain categories of occurrence. *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Guyana as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions *(H) Hypothetical - a species recorded but with \\"no tangible evidence\\" according to the SACC Tinamous Order: TinamiformesFamily: Tinamidae The tinamous are one of the most ancient groups of bird. Although they look similar to other ground- dwelling birds like quail and grouse, they have no close relatives and are classified as a single family, Tinamidae, within their own order, the Tinamiformes. They are distantly related to the ratites (order Struthioniformes), that includes the rheas, emus, and kiwis. Seven species have been recorded in Guyana. *Great tinamou, Tinamus major *Cinereous tinamou, Crypturellus cinereus *Little tinamou, Crypturellus soui *Undulated tinamou, Crypturellus undulatus *Red-legged tinamou, Crypturellus erythropus *Variegated tinamou, Crypturellus variegatus *Rusty tinamou, Crypturellus brevirostris Screamers Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anhimidae The screamers are a small family of birds related to the ducks. They are large, bulky birds, with a small downy head, long legs, and large feet which are only partially webbed. They have large spurs on their wings which are used in fights over mates and in territorial disputes. One species has been recorded in Guyana. *Horned screamer, Anhima cornuta (Extirpated) Ducks Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating. Eleven species have been recorded in Guyana. *Fulvous whistling-duck, Dendrocygna bicolor *White-faced whistling- duck, Dendrocygna viduata *Black-bellied whistling-duck, Dendrocygna autumnalis *Orinoco goose, Oressochen jubata *Muscovy duck, Cairina moschata *Comb duck, Sarkidiornis sylvicola *Brazilian teal, Amazonetta brasiliensis *Blue-winged teal, Spatula discors *White-cheeked pintail, Anas bahamensis *Northern pintail, Anas acuta *Masked duck, Nomonyx dominicus Guans Order: GalliformesFamily: Cracidae The Cracidae are large birds, similar in general appearance to turkeys. The guans and curassows live in trees, but the smaller chachalacas are found in more open scrubby habitats. They are generally dull- plumaged, but the curassows and some guans have colorful facial ornaments. Six species have been recorded in Guyana. *Marail guan, Penelope marail *Spix's guan, Penelope jacquacu *Blue-throated piping-guan, Pipile cumanensis *Variable chachalaca, Ortalis motmot *Black curassow, Crax alector *Crestless curassow, Mitu tomentosum New World quails Order: GalliformesFamily: Odontophoridae The New World quails are small, plump terrestrial birds only distantly related to the quails of the Old World, but named for their similar appearance and habits. Two species have been recorded in Guyana. *Crested bobwhite, Colinus cristatus *Marbled wood-quail, Odontophorus gujanensis Flamingos Order: PhoenicopteriformesFamily: Phoenicopteridae Flamingos are gregarious wading birds, usually tall, found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres.

They are found worldwide within the tropical zone, with some species also breeding in temperate Europe and Australia. They are medium to large waders with strong black or yellow-black bills, large yellow eyes, and cryptic plumage. Despite being classed as waders, most species have a preference for arid or semi-arid habitats. One species has been recorded in Guyana. *Double-striped thick-knee, Burhinus bistriatus Sandpipers Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Scolopacidae Scolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the sandpipers, curlews, godwits, shanks, tattlers, woodcocks, snipes, dowitchers, and phalaropes. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Variation in length of legs and bills enables multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food. Twenty-three species have been recorded in Guyana. *Upland sandpiper, Bartramia longicauda *Eskimo curlew, Numenius borealis (believed extinct) *Whimbrel, Numenius phaeopus *Hudsonian godwit, Limosa haemastica (H) *Ruddy turnstone, Arenaria interpres *Red knot, Calidris canutus *Stilt sandpiper, Calidris himantopus (H) *Sanderling, Calidris alba *Least sandpiper, Calidris minutilla *White-rumped sandpiper, Calidris fuscicollis *Buff-breasted sandpiper, Calidris subruficollis (H) *Pectoral sandpiper, Calidris melanotos *Semipalmated sandpiper, Calidris pusilla *Western sandpiper, Calidris mauri *Short-billed dowitcher, Limnodromus griseus *Giant snipe, Gallinago undulata *Wilson's snipe, Gallinago delicata *South American snipe, Gallinago paraguaiae *Spotted sandpiper, Actitis macularia *Solitary sandpiper, Tringa solitaria *Greater yellowlegs, Tringa melanoleuca *Willet, Tringa semipalmata *Lesser yellowlegs, Tringa flavipes Jacanas Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Jacanidae The jacanas are a group of waders in the family Jacanidae. They are found throughout the tropics. They are identifiable by their huge feet and claws which enable them to walk on floating vegetation in the shallow lakes that are their preferred habitat. One species has been recorded in Guyana. *Wattled jacana, Jacana jacana Skuas Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Stercorariidae The family Stercorariidae are, in general, medium to large birds, typically with gray or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings.

One species has been recorded in Guyana. *Black skimmer, Rynchops niger Gulls Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Laridae Laridae is a family of medium to large seabirds and includes gulls, kittiwakes, terns, and skimmers. Gulls are typically gray or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with gray or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. Skimmers are a small family of tropical tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish.

Three species have been recorded in Guyana. *Maguari stork, Ciconia maguari *Jabiru, Jabiru mycteria *Wood stork, Mycteria americana Frigatebirds Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black-and-white, or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have colored inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. One species has been recorded in Guyana. *Magnificent frigatebird, Fregata magnificens Boobies Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. One species has been recorded in Guyana. *Brown booby, Sula leucogaster Anhingas Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Anhingas are often called \\"snake-birds\\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape, and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. One species has been recorded in Guyana. *Anhinga, Anhinga anhinga Cormorants Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags.

Found in tropical woodlands worldwide, they feed on insects and fruit, and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly any distance. Trogons have soft, often colorful, feathers with distinctive male and female plumage. Six species have been recorded in Guyana. *Black-tailed trogon, Trogon melanurus *Green- backed trogon, Trogon viridis *Guianan trogon, Trogon violaceus *Black- throated trogon, Trogon rufus *Collared trogon, Trogon collaris *Masked trogon, Trogon personatus Motmots Order: CoraciiformesFamily: Momotidae The motmots have colorful plumage and long, graduated tails which they display by waggling back and forth. In most of the species, the barbs near the ends of the two longest (central) tail feathers are weak and fall off, leaving a length of bare shaft and creating a racket-shaped tail. One species has been recorded in Guyana. *Amazonian motmot, Momotus momota Kingfishers Order: CoraciiformesFamily: Alcedinidae Kingfishers are medium-sized birds with large heads, long pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails. Six species have been recorded in Guyana. *Ringed kingfisher, Megaceryle torquatus *Belted kingfisher, Megaceryle alcyon (H) *Amazon kingfisher, Chloroceryle amazona *American pygmy kingfisher, Chloroceryle aenea *Green kingfisher, Chloroceryle americana *Green-and-rufous kingfisher, Chloroceryle inda Jacamars Order: GalbuliformesFamily: Galbulidae The jacamars are near passerine birds from tropical South America, with a range that extends up to Mexico. They feed on insects caught on the wing, and are glossy, elegant birds with long bills and tails. In appearance and behavior they resemble the Old World bee-eaters, although they are more closely related to puffbirds. Seven species have been recorded in Guyana. *Brown jacamar, Brachygalba lugubris *Yellow-billed jacamar, Galbula albirostris *Rufous-tailed jacamar, Galbula ruficauda *Green- tailed jacamar, Galbula galbula *Bronzy jacamar, Galbula leucogastra *Paradise jacamar, Galbula dea *Great jacamar, Jacamerops aureus Puffbirds Order: GalbuliformesFamily: Bucconidae The puffbirds are related to the jacamars and have the same range, but lack the iridescent colors of that family. They are mainly brown, rufous, or gray, with large heads and flattened bills with hooked tips. The loose abundant plumage and short tails makes them look stout and puffy, giving rise to the English common name of the family. Eight species have been recorded in Guyana. *Guianan puffbird, Notharchus macrorhynchos *Pied puffbird, Notharchus tectus *Spotted puffbird, Bucco tamatia *Collared puffbird, Bucco capensis *White-chested puffbird, Malacoptila fusca *Rusty- breasted nunlet, Nonnula rubecula *Black nunbird, Monasa atra *Swallow-winged puffbird, Chelidoptera tenebrosa New World barbets Order: PiciformesFamily: Capitonidae The barbets are plump birds with short necks and large heads. They get their name from the bristles which fringe their heavy bills. Most species are brightly colored.

One species has been recorded in Suriname. *Magnificent frigatebird, Fregata magnificens Boobies Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. Three species have been recorded in Suriname. *Masked booby, Sula dactylatra *Red-footed booby, Sula sula *Brown booby, Sula leucogaster Anhingas Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Anhingas are often called \\"snake-birds\\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape, and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The anhingas have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. One species has been recorded in Suriname. *Anhinga, Anhinga anhinga Cormorants Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags.

By 1840, it had become the most influential literary publication of the time in the United States, especially through the contributions from such writers as Washington Irving, William Cullen Bryant, Nathaniel Parker Willis, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and by Clark's own departments, the \\"Editors Table\\" and \\"Gossip with Readers and Correspondents\\". Pecuniary distress caused its discontinuance, and Clark removed to Piermont, New York, where he lived in a residence presented by former contributors to his magazine, who raised the necessary funds in part by publishing a volume of their contributions, under the title The Knickerbocker Gallery. He published the Knickerbocker Sketch- Book (1850), including some of his own essays, and Knick-Knacks from an Editor's Table (1852). In retirement, after the magazine folded, Clark regularly contributed articles to the Evening Post and the Home Journal. During his career, Clark made an enemy of fellow editor and author Edgar Allan Poe.

Twenty-seven species of Laridae have been recorded in French Guiana. *Black-legged kittiwake, Rissa tridactyla (H) *Sabine's gull, Xema sabini (V) *Gray-hooded gull, Chroicocephalus cirrocephalus (V) *Black-headed gull, Chroicocephalus ridibundus (V) *Little gull, Hydrocoloeus minutus (V) *Laughing gull, Leucophaeus atricilla *Franklin's gull, Leucophaeus pipixcan (V) *Great black-backed gull, Larus marinus (V) *Kelp gull, Larus dominicanus (V) *Lesser black-backed gull, Larus fuscus (V) *Herring gull, Larus argentatus (V) *Brown noddy, Anous stolidus *Sooty tern, Onychoprion fuscata *Bridled tern, Onychoprion anaethetus (V) *Least tern, Sterula antillarum *Yellow-billed tern, Sternula superciliaris *Large-billed tern, Phaetusa simplex *Gull-billed tern, Gelochelidon nilotica *Black tern, Chlidonias niger *White-winged tern, Chlidonias leucopterus (V) *Common tern, Sterna hirundo *Roseate tern, Sterna dougallii *Arctic tern, Sterna paradisaea *Elegant tern, Thalasseus elegans (V) *Sandwich tern, Thalasseus sandvicensis *Royal tern, Thalasseus maximus Sunbittern Order: EurypygiformesFamily: Eurypygidae The sunbittern is a bittern-like bird of tropical regions of the Americas and the sole member of the family Eurypygidae (sometimes spelled Eurypigidae) and genus Eurypyga. *Sunbittern, Eurypyga helias Tropicbirds Order: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings. One species has been recorded in French Guiana. *Red-billed tropicbird, Phaethon aethereus Albatrosses Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Diomedeidae The albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds, and the great albatrosses from the genus Diomedea have the largest wingspans of any extant birds. One species has been recorded in French Guiana. *Yellow-nosed albatross, Thalassarche chlororhynchos (V) Southern storm-petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The storm-petrels are the smallest seabirds, relatives of the petrels, feeding on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. Until 2018, this family's species were included with the other storm-petrels in family Hydrobatidae. One species has been recorded in French Guiana. *Wilson's storm-petrel, Oceanites oceanicus Northern storm-petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae Though the members of this family are similar in many respects to the southern storm- petrels, including their general appearance and habits, there are enough genetic differences to warrant their placement in a separate family. Two species have been recorded in French Guiana. *Band-rumped storm-petrel, Hydrobates castro (V) *Leach's storm-petrel, Hydrobates leucorhoa Shearwaters Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterized by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary.

Storks are mute, but bill-clattering is an important mode of communication at the nest. Their nests can be large and may be reused for many years. Many species are migratory. Three species have been recorded in French Guiana. *Maguari stork, Ciconia maguari (V) *Jabiru, Jabiru mycteria (V) *Wood stork, Mycteria americana Frigatebirds Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black-and-white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have colored inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to- body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. One species has been recorded in French Guiana. *Magnificent frigatebird, Fregata magnificens Boobies Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. Three species have been recorded in French Guiana. *Masked booby, Sula dactylatra *Red-footed booby, Sula sula (V) *Brown booby, Sula leucogaster Anhingas Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Anhingas are often called \\"snake-birds\\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape, and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. One species has been recorded in French Guiana. *Anhinga, Anhinga anhinga Cormorants Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage coloration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white, and a few being colorful. One species has been recorded in French Guiana. *Neotropic cormorant, Phalacrocorax brasilianus Pelicans Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae Pelicans are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. As with other members of the order Pelecaniformes, they have webbed feet with four toes. One species has been recorded in French Guiana. *Brown pelican, Pelecanus occidentalis Herons Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons, and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long- necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills. Nineteen species have been recorded in French Guiana. *Rufescent tiger-heron, Tigrisoma lineatum *Fasciated tiger-heron, Tigrisoma fasciatum *Agami heron, Agamia agami *Boat- billed heron, Cochlearius cochlearius *Zigzag heron, Zebrilus undulatus *Pinnated bittern, Botaurus pinnatus *Least bittern, Ixobrychus exilis *Stripe-backed bittern, Ixobrychus involucris (H) *Black-crowned night-heron, Nycticorax nycticorax *Yellow-crowned night-heron, Nyctanassa violacea *Striated heron, Butorides striata *Cattle egret, Bubulcus ibis *Cocoi heron, Ardea cocoi *Great egret, Ardea alba *Capped heron, Pilherodius pileatus *Tricolored heron, Egretta tricolor *Little egret, Egretta garzetta (V) *Snowy egret, Egretta thula *Little blue heron, Egretta caerulea Ibises Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Threskiornithidae Threskiornithidae is a family of large terrestrial and wading birds which includes the ibises and spoonbills.

Found in tropical woodlands worldwide, they feed on insects and fruit, and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly any distance. Trogons have soft, often colorful, feathers with distinctive male and female plumage. Five species have been recorded in French Guiana. *Black-tailed trogon, Trogon melanurus *Green-backed trogon, Trogon viridis *Guianan trogon, Trogon violaceus *Black-throated trogon, Trogon rufus *Collared trogon, Trogon collaris Motmots Order: CoraciiformesFamily: Momotidae The motmots have colorful plumage and long, graduated tails which they display by waggling back and forth. In most of the species, the barbs near the ends of the two longest (central) tail feathers are weak and fall off, leaving a length of bare shaft and creating a racket-shaped tail. One species has been recorded in French Guiana. *Amazonian motmot, Momotus momota Kingfishers Order: CoraciiformesFamily: Alcedinidae Kingfishers are medium-sized birds with large heads, long pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails.

They feed on insects caught on the wing, and are glossy, elegant birds with long bills and tails. In appearance and behavior they resemble the Old World bee-eaters, although they are more closely related to puffbirds. Six species have been recorded in French Guiana. *Brown jacamar, Brachygalba lugubris *Yellow-billed jacamar, Galbula albirostris *Green-tailed jacamar, Galbula galbula *Bronzy jacamar, Galbula leucogastra *Paradise jacamar, Galbula dea *Great jacamar, Jacamerops aureus Puffbirds Order: GalbuliformesFamily: Bucconidae The puffbirds are related to the jacamars and have the same range, but lack the iridescent colors of that family. They are mainly brown, rufous, or gray, with large heads and flattened bills with hooked tips. The loose abundant plumage and short tails makes them look stout and puffy, giving rise to the English common name of the family. Eight species have been recorded in French Guiana. *Guianan puffbird, Notharchus macrorhynchos *Pied puffbird, Notharchus tectus *Spotted puffbird, Bucco tamatia *Collared puffbird, Bucco capensis *White-chested puffbird, Malacoptila fusca *Rusty-breasted nunlet, Nonnula rubecula (H) *Black nunbird, Monasa atra *Swallow-winged puffbird, Chelidoptera tenebrosa New World barbets Order: PiciformesFamily: Capitonidae The barbets are plump birds, with short necks and large heads.

They are forest birds which tend to feed on insects at or near the ground. A sizable minority of them specialize in following columns of army ants to eat small invertebrates that leave their hiding places to flee from the ants. Many species lack bright color; brown, black, and white are the dominant tones. Forty-two species have been recorded in French Guiana. *Rufous-rumped antwren, Euchrepomis callinota *Ash-winged antwren, Euchrepomis spodioptila *Fasciated antshrike, Cymbilaimus lineatus *Black-throated antshrike, Frederickena viridis *Great antshrike, Taraba major *Black-crested antshrike, Sakesphorus canadensis *Barred antshrike, Thamnophilus doliatus *Mouse-colored antshrike, Thamnophilus murinus *Blackish-gray antshrike, Thamnophilus nigrocinereus *Northern slaty- antshrike, Thamnophilus punctatus *Band-tailed antshrike, Thamnophilus melanothorax *Amazonian antshrike, Thamnophilus amazonicus *Dusky-throated antshrike, Thamnomanes ardesiacus *Cinereous antshrike, Thamnomanes caesius *Rufous-bellied antwren, Isleria guttata *Spot-winged antshrike, Pygiptila stellaris (H) *Brown-bellied stipplethroat, Epinecrophylla gutturalis *Pygmy antwren, Myrmotherula brachyura *Guianan streaked-antwren, Myrmotherula surinamensis *White-flanked antwren, Myrmotherula axillaris *Long-winged antwren, Myrmotherula longipennis *Gray antwren, Myrmotherula menetriesii *Spot-tailed antwren, Herpsilochmus sticturus *Todd's antwren, Herpsilochmus stictocephalus *Dot-winged antwren, Microrhopias quixensis *White-fringed antwren, Formicivora grisea *Guianan warbling-antbird, Hypocnemis cantator *Dusky antbird, Cercomacroides tyrannina *Blackish antbird, Cercomacroides nigrescens *Gray antbird, Cercomacra cinerascens *White-browed antbird, Myrmoborus leucophrys *Black-chinned antbird, Hypocnemoides melanopogon *Silvered antbird, Sclateria naevia *Black-headed antbird, Percnostola rufifrons *Spot-winged antbird, Myrmelastes leucostigma *Ferruginous-backed antbird, Myrmoderus ferrugineus *Black-throated antbird, Myrmophylax atrothorax *Wing-banded antbird, Myrmornis torquata *White-plumed antbird, Pithys albifrons *Rufous-throated antbird, Gymnopithys rufigula *Spot-backed antbird, Hylophylax naevius *Common scale-backed antbird, Willisornis poecilinotus Gnateaters Order: PasseriformesFamily: Conopophagidae The gnateaters are round, short-tailed, and long-legged birds, which are closely related to the antbirds.

Garrity: Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. 2. Auflage. Springer, New York, 2005, Vol. 2: The Proteobacteria Part C: The Alpha-, Beta-, Delta-, and Epsilonproteabacteria Infected stallions are asymptomatic and act as the principal source of infection as they mate with numerous mares, and the carrier status may persist for many months or even years.  Phylogeny  The first identification of Taylorella equigenitalis was by Taylor et al., in 1978 and was referred to at the time as Haemophilus equigenitalis. Due to specific genomic characteristics and DNA hybridization results, Sugimoto et al., proposed the change from Haemophilus genus to Taylorella in 1983. There are two identified biotypes of Taylorella equigenitalis, one of which is resistant to streptomycin. Taylorella equigenitalis is an infectious organism for horses, a second species, Taylorella asinigenitalis has been isolated from the genital tracts of male donkeys. Gross morphology and growth rates of T. equigenitalis and T. asinigenitalis are too similar to differentiate the two species without the use of molecular identification techniques such as PCR. Molecular evaluation of the 16S rDNA sequence has confirmed that there is enough of a genetic difference between Taylorella equigenitalis and Taylorella asinigenitalis to separately classify the two species. Taylorella asinigenitalis does not appear to cause disease in equine mares, only in donkeys. Taylorella equigenitalis was previously identified as belonging to the Pasteurellacae family. It is now classified as belonging to the Alcaligenaceae family.  Morphology  Taylorella equigenitalis is a Gram-negative bacterium, which grows best under specific environmental conditions on the reproductive organs, and in the reproductive tract of horses. Taylorella equigenitalis is morphologically identified as coccobacillary or bacillus. Members of the genus Taylorella including T. equigenitalis are non-motile and microaerophilic. Herbert et al., have reported that T. equigenitalis have a capsule and express pili in vivo. Taylorella equigenitalis is pleomorphic on isolation from equine carriers, and there is no formation of endospores. Taylorella equigenitalis has scant growth on blood agar, the best growth is observed on chocolate agar at temperatures between 30-42 degrees Celsius. Taylorella equigenitalis tests positive on oxidase, catalase, phosphatase and phosphoamidase reactions and negatively on glucosidase, indole, hydrogen sulfide and production of chemoorganotrophic acid from carbohydrates. T. equigenitalis is sensitive to penicillin type antibiotics.  Ecology, Distribution & Habitat  Taylorella equigenitalis is a venereally transmitted disease of horses. Experimental reports have noted intrauterine infection of rodents with Taylorella equigenitalis, but not with cattle, sheep, swine or cats. Taylorella equigenitalis can be isolated from the urethral fossa, distal urethra, prepuce, free-part of the penis and uncommonly from the pre-ejaculatory fluid. In mares, the bacteria is best found in the clitoral fossa and sinus. In stallions, the bacteria is best found in the urethral fossa, urethral sinus, urethral and penile sheath, epididymis and seminal vesicles. On the external genitalia of horses, T. equigenitalis is found particularly in the presence of smegma and cellular debris. Taylorella equigenitalis was first reported in thoroughbreds in 1977 in the United Kingdom. Transmission occurred following the first report in the UK to Ireland, France, Australia, Belgium, USA, and Germany. Taylorella equigenitalis has been identified throughout the world including in Japan, Australia, North America, South America and Europe. The first isolation of T. equigenitalis in Japan occurred in 1980. The first report of T. equigenitalis in Turkey was reported in 2001. As of 2006, Samper & Tibary reported that T. equigenitalis was no longer present in North America, but is endemic within Europe. The most recent outbreak in the USA reported by Schulman et al., was in 2008-2010 and also in South Africa in 2011. There is thought to be underreporting of T. equigenitalis and that the global distribution of the disease is greater than what is currently reported. Bacteriological and serological screening of horses coming from a country with CEM is required for horses entering countries where CEM is not yet reported. Carriers of T. equigenitalis are the most significant contributor to global spread of CEM in mares and stallions.Taylorella equigenitalis can persist on equine genitalia for years and still be transmitted to susceptible mares or stallions through natural service or artificial insemination. Mares may be asymptomatic harbouring T. equigenitalis in the clitoral sinuses and fossa, it may also remain for months to years in the uterine or clitoral tissue of previously infected mares. More significantly, stallions are frequently asymptomatic when carriers, with T. equigenitalis harbouring in the urethral fossa, urethra or penile sheath. Vertical transmission from mother to fetus through the placenta has been reported. In particular, colts transplacentally infected while in- utero may become a source of future T. equigenitalis transmission to susceptible mares. Biosecurity standards including good hygiene, cleaning of fomites and use or sterile and disposable materials should be considered when handling horses for breeding and semen collection. Taylorella equigenitalis does not survive long off of horse reproductive tissue and is sensitive to disinfectants, UV light, high temperatures and humidity.  Pathogenesis = Role in Disease  Clinical Signs:  Transmission  Host Range & Zoonotic Potential: Diagnosis Diagnosis of CEM is achieved by PCR or culturing the organism from urethral fossa, urethra, and semen of stallions and the clitoral sinus and clitoral fossa of mares. One or two swab(s) from smegma of clitorial sinuses and/or fossae are taken and transferred in AMIES transport medium with charcoal at 4 ¬∞C to a laboratory. The volume of the sample on the swab is not relevant, as even a low volume of smegma may harbor this pathogen.Ghasemzadeh Nava, H., Salehi, T.Z., Eliasi, M.A., Gharagozloo, F., Rezagholizadeh, R. and Tajik, P.(2008) An outbreak of contagious equine metritis (CEM) from a stud farm in Iran: the first report of Taylorella equigenitalis isolation from Iran. 15 th Congress of FAVA, 27‚Äì30 October, Bangkok, Thailand, p 359-360  Treatment  Genomics, Molecular Biology & Biochemical Identification  Clinical & Economic Value ReferencesExternal links * .P.

Towncraft was released in theaters, on DVD and online on May 22, 2007. Towncraft was the first film to be released simultaneously on these three platforms.wcco.com - Video Library The film features interviews and performances by many Little Rock bands including Soophie Nun Squad, Ho-Hum, and The American Princes. Plot In the late 1980s a few kids in the small, sleepy Southern town of Little Rock, discovered punk rock and the DIY ethic that drove it. Unlike other towns, Little Rock's punk scene was composed almost entirely of junior high and High School kids. Over the next decade, they would book their own shows, start record labels, open record stores, play with national acts and formulate a collective set of ideals. In 1992, they released Towncraft, a compilation album and zine that documented their scene. Towncraft focuses on the roots of the Little Rock scene, how it changed the lives of those involved, the DIY ethos that has shaped the scene for the past 20 years and how the scene continues to thrive outside of the mainstream.

The team was selected by the FIA in 2006 to be the 12th entry into the 2008 Formula One world championship. In November 2007, a legal challenge to the team's proposed use of customer cars led to Prodrive pulling out of the 2008 season. In 2009, Prodrive boss David Richards announced that either Prodrive or Aston Martin Racing may appear in F1 from 2010 should the budget caps planned be acceptable.Dave Richards ponders F1 Return Prodrive Ltd. is based in Banbury, England, but has unveiled plans to relocate to a new motorsport facility called \\"The Fulcrum\\" (based at the former RAF Honiley airfield) near Wroxall, Warwickshire. Entry into F1 On 28 April 2006, rallying and motorsports technology firm Prodrive were officially granted entry to Formula One when the FIA announced the list of entrants to the 2008 Formula One World Championship. While a total of 22 teams applied for entry, the FIA had always maintained that, for reasons of both safety and practicality, only 12 teams would be granted entry, meaning only one new team would line up on the grid in 2008. FIA president Max Mosley was impressed by Prodrive's bid, which beat off stiff competition from Carlin Motorsport, the Jean Alesi-led and McLaren-supported Direxiv outfit, BAR co-founder Craig Pollock, former Minardi owner Paul Stoddart and ex-Jordan Grand Prix team principal, Eddie Jordan. Mosley revealed that Prodrive had found the finances to support their bid, adding: \\"Prodrive have the best combination of financial backing, technical capability and motor sport experience and are well known to the FIA through their participation in the World Rally Championship. Also, Prodrive's chief executive, David Richards, has experience as a Formula One team principal\\". Richards has previously acted as team principal of the Benetton and British American Racing teams. According to some reports, Prodrive F1 was to use Mercedes engines and the same cars as McLaren. During the 2007 season, McLaren boss Ron Dennis denied that the partnership had been finalised. Discussions with other potential suppliers of cars, including Renault, were also carried out. On 25 April 2007, it was announced that Prodrive had attracted a title sponsor for 2008. The same article also referenced Gary Paffett for a race drive citing his \\"one year\\" contract in DTM and with McLaren as a test driver. There were also rumours linking DTM driver Bruno Spengler, ex-F1 driver and McLaren tester Pedro de la Rosa and ex- McLaren test driver Alexander Wurz to the team. By October 2007, it was believed that the team had an agreement in place to use McLaren-Mercedes cars, at a cost of around $100M.The problem for Prodrive Although David Richards also led the consortium which owns Aston Martin, he ruled out the Aston Martin brand entering F1. Although the FIA had announced in 2006 that customer cars would be permitted from the 2008 season, the 2007 season saw complaints against two teams, Scuderia Toro Rosso and Super Aguri F1, believed by other teams to already be using customer cars. The use of customer cars (cars built by a constructor entered in the F1 championship and sold to another entrant) is forbidden by the Concorde Agreement. The Concorde Agreement is the contract between the FIA, the F1 teams and Formula One Administration which dictates the terms by which the teams compete in races and take their share of the television revenues and prize money. The current Agreement expires at the end of 2007. A new document has not been agreed as of November 2007; the likely outcome is that the status quo will continue into 2008. On this basis, in October 2007 the Williams team challenged Prodrive's proposed use of customer cars for its entry to the 2008 championship in the FIA's International Court of Appeal. Following lengthy negotiations between president Mosley and Richards, including a request that the team be allowed to enter from mid- season, Richards announced on 23 November 2007 that Prodrive F1 would not compete in the 2008 Formula One World Championship, as the legal situation left no time for the team to be set up for the start of the season.F1-Live - Prodrive no-go for 2008 \\"It is still our ambition to compete in Formula One,\\" Prodrive said in a statement. \\"We are hopeful that a new Concorde Agreement between the FIA, FOA (Formula One Administration) and teams will provide clarity as to the terms on which this might be possible. When this new agreement is reached, we will be in a position to consider the extent to which we can adapt our plans for participation in the future.\\"Prodrive gives up on 2008 F1 entry In an interview Richards said that he would have wanted Pedro de la Rosa and Lucas di Grassi as his drivers for the 2008 season. Second attempt Richards was linked to buying out the abandoned Honda team and using it as an output for Prodrive, but Ross Brawn and the rest of the team's management bought out the team instead, becoming Brawn GP. Third attempt Richards lodged an entry for the 2010 Formula One season. If successful, it would have allowed the Aston Martin name to return to Formula One. On 12 June 2009 it was announced by the FIA that Prodrive had not been accepted into the 2010 F1 Championship. Prodrive stated in a press release that they were 'disappointed'.http://www.prodrive.com/p_releases.html?id=233 Fourth attempt In early December 2009, there were reports in the media suggesting that Renault were looking to sell their team ahead of the 2010 F1 season. Bernie Ecclestone, the commercial rights holder for Formula One, revealed on 7 December 2009 that Richards' Prodrive was one of four potential bidders. Reports suggested that Prodrive's proposal would have seen Renault withdraw from the sport as a manufacturer, but remain in place as an engine supplier.

The males of many of the species are brightly colored or decorated with plumes or wattles. Twenty-eight species have been recorded in Ecuador. *Green-and-black fruiteater, Pipreola riefferii *Barred fruiteater, Pipreola arcuata *Orange-breasted fruiteater, Pipreola jucunda *Black-chested fruiteater, Pipreola lubomirskii *Scarlet-breasted fruiteater, Pipreola frontalis *Fiery-throated fruiteater, Pipreola chlorolepidota *Scaled fruiteater, Ampelioides tschudii *Chestnut-bellied cotinga, Doliornis remseni *Red-crested cotinga, Ampelion rubrocristata *Chestnut-crested cotinga, Ampelion rufaxilla *Black-necked red-cotinga, Phoenicircus nigricollis *Andean cock-of-the-rock, Rupicola peruviana *Gray-tailed piha, Snowornis subalaris *Olivaceous piha, Snowornis cryptolophus *Purple-throated fruitcrow, Querula purpurata *Red-ruffed fruitcrow, Pyroderus scutatus *Amazonian umbrellabird, Cephalopterus ornatus *Long-wattled umbrellabird, Cephalopterus penduliger *Blue cotinga, Cotinga nattererii *Plum-throated cotinga, Cotinga maynana *Spangled cotinga, Cotinga cayana *Dusky piha, Lipaugus fuscocinereus *Rufous piha, Lipaugus unirufus *Screaming piha, Lipaugus vociferans *Purple-throated cotinga, Porphyrolaema porphyrolaema *Black-tipped cotinga, Carpodectes hopkei *Pompadour cotinga, Xipholena punicea *Bare-necked fruitcrow, Gymnoderus foetidus Tityras Order: PasseriformesFamily: Tityridae Tityridae are suboscine passerine birds found in forest and woodland in the Neotropics. The species in this family were formerly spread over the families Tyrannidae, Pipridae, and Cotingidae. They are small to medium-sized birds. They do not have the sophisticated vocal capabilities of the songbirds. Most, but not all, have plain coloring. Twenty-two species have been recorded in Ecuador. *Black- crowned tityra, Tityra inquisitor *Black-tailed tityra, Tityra cayana *Masked tityra, Tityra semifasciata *Varzea schiffornis, Schiffornis major *Northern schiffornis, Schiffornis veraepacis *Foothill schiffornis, Schiffornis aenea *Brown-winged schiffornis, Schiffornis turdina *Speckled mourner, Laniocera rufescens *Cinereous mourner, Laniocera hypopyrra *White-browed purpletuft, Iodopleura isabellae *Shrike-like cotinga, Laniisoma elegans *Green-backed becard, Pachyramphus viridis *Barred becard, Pachyramphus versicolor *Slaty becard, Pachyramphus spodiurus *Cinnamon becard, Pachyramphus cinnamomeus *Chestnut-crowned becard, Pachyramphus castaneus *White-winged becard, Pachyramphus polychopterus *Black-and-white becard, Pachyramphus albogriseus *Black-capped becard, Pachyramphus marginatus *One-colored becard, Pachyramphus homochrous *Pink-throated becard, Pachyramphus minor Sharpbill Order: PasseriformesFamily: Oxyruncidae The sharpbill is a small bird of dense forests in Central and South America.

officers, and later a political party, which staged a bloodless coup against King Prajadhipok's government and transformed the country's absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy on 24 June 1932.  Background  Rue Du Sommerard in Paris was the establishment place for Khana Ratsadon The Promoters In 1927, the Kingdom of Siam, the Rattanakosin Kingdom (1782‚Äì1932), was under the absolutist rule of the House of Chakri, under King Prajadhipok, Rama VII. Under his reign, the nation experienced troubles stemming from an archaic government confronted with serious economic problems and threats from abroad, the British and French Empires. The country was also experiencing a dramatic social change as the urban and middle classes of Bangkok were starting to grow, slowly demanding more rights from their government, criticizing it as ineffective. These changes were mostly led by men, civilians and military, who had graduated or travelled abroad. They wanted to transform Siam into a modern country along the lines of a Western democracy. In February 1927, a group of seven Siamese students, later known as the \\"promoters\\", met at a hotel on the Rue Du Sommerard in Paris and founded what would become Khana Ratsadon. For five days they met and proposed arguments for and against various aspects of the movement, the men were: :1. Lieutenant Prayoon Pamornmontri (), Army officer, formerly of King Vajiravudh's Royal Guards :2. Lieutenant Plaek Khittasangkha (), later Luang Phibulsonggram, Army officer, student, School of Applied Artillery, France :3. Lieutenant Thatsanai Mitphakdi (), Army officer, student, French Cavalry Academy :4. Tua Lophanukrom (), scientist studying in Switzerland :5. Luang Siriratchamaitri (), diplomat, officer at the Siamese Embassy in Paris :6. Naep Phahonyothin (), law student studying in England :7. Pridi Banomyong (), law student studying at the Institut d'√âtudes Politiques de Paris  Six principles  A school notebook published in 1934, with illustrations of the six principles on its cover, displayed at Thai Parliament Museum, Bangkok. The revolutionaries made Pridi Panomyong their president and termed themselves the \\"promoters\\" (; ). The party determined a sixfold objective which was later called the \\"Six Principles\\" (; ), as follows: :1. To maintain the supreme power of the Thai people. :2. To maintain national security. :3. To maintain the economic welfare of the Thai people in accordance with the National Economic Project. :4. To protect the equality of the Thai people. :5. To maintain the people's rights and liberties, insofar as they are not inconsistent with any of the above-mentioned principles. :6. To provide public education for all citizens. To achieve these goals, the party determined that they must overthrow, using force if necessary, the present government and the system of absolute monarchy and turn the Asian kingdom into a modern constitutional monarchy. Most of the members were students educated abroad, mostly in the United Kingdom and France. When the group returned to Siam, they enlisted members from among the army and navy, the merchant class, civil servants and others. Their membership eventually reached 102, separated into four main branches. These included the civilians, led by Pridi Banomyong; the navy, led by Luang Sinthusongkhramchai; the junior army officers, led by Major Phibulsonggram; and finally the senior officers, led by Colonel Phot Phahonyothin.  Legacy  1932 coup memorial peg at Dusit Palace Royal Plaza. On 14 April 2017 it was found missing and replaced by an ultraroyalist peg. The party was eventually successful in their goal of revolution by bloodless coup. By 1933 they had turned Siam into a single party state. However the party itself was short-lived, due to infighting as the party had too many factions, conflicting interests, and political beliefs. The party eventually divided into two factions, a civilian faction led by Pridi Bhanomyong, and a military faction led by Marshal Pibulsongkram. They would dominate Thai politics for the next two decades, producing six Prime Ministers of Thailand from their ranks. The party declined at about the time the Second World War ended. As the party lost power, subsequent governments attempted to downplay their significance and erase their legacy. Part of this was accomplished through the removal of architecture associated with the party, most significantly beginning with the demolition of Sala Chaloem Thai in 1989. This movement intensified in the 2010s; the Supreme Court building controversially demolished in 2013, and following the 2014 coup, multiple landmarks became quietly removed without explanation. On the 88th anniversary of the revolution in 2020, the Reuters news service identified six historical markers memorialising the People's Party and the events of 1932 which have been removed or renamed over the previous year. In most cases it is not known who is responsible. Some historians, such as Chatri Prakitnonthakan of Silpakorn University, interpreted these removals as an attempted \\"ideological cleansing\\" by the conservative establishment. A memorial plaque honoring the 1932 Revolution was reported missing on 14 April 2017. It was thought to be stolen on 5 April and was replaced with another plaque with text praising the Chakri Dynasty. , no one has taken responsibility for the theft. The 1932 Revolution brass plaque, about 30 centimeters across, was embedded in the asphalt of the Royal Plaza, less than 10 meters from the equestrian statue depicting King Rama V. The site is where the revolt took place on 24 June 1932. Here, a declaration condemning absolute monarchy was read. Press reports noted that ultraroyalist groups had threatened to remove the plaque in the months preceding its theft. A Royal Thai Army artillery base in Lopburi Province bore the name of General Phraya Phahon until 2019 when, at the order of the current king, Vajiralongkorn, it was renamed King Bhumibol base. Long-standing statues of Phraya Phahon and Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram installed at the base are to be removed and replaced by a statue of King Bhumibol. Public perception and discourse over the party's legacy has also fluctuated over time. Their role in establishing a constitutional monarchy was glossed over by school textbooks, and rhetoric dismissing the party's actions as premature was popularized. Such ideas were reignited in the 2010s, as ideological conflicts over democracy and the monarchy intensified. Conservative writers demonized the People's Party as republicans. This led to a reactionary response by liberal groups. During the 2020 protests, youth protesters symbolically installed a new plaque in Sanam Luang, and a group leading the protest movement called themselves \\"Khana Ratsadon 2563\\" (People's Party 2020).  Members of Khana Ratsadon  The members of Khana Ratsadon were a mix of both military officers and civilians. Lieutenant Krachang Tularak was its last surviving member.

He was a close friend of Thomas Agro and Peter Calabrese. Early life Born in the Little Italy section of Manhattan, Carrone was nicknamed \\"Buzz\\" because of his violent temper. He joined the Gambino family as an associate, working under caporegime Thomas Agro, and later Carmine Fatico, in the Bergin Hunt and Fish Club crew. He was involved in bank robbery and hijacking as a \\"stick up man\\". Carrone also trafficked small shipments of cocaine, marijuana and Quaaludes in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. His right eye was gouged or shot out, severing nerve endings and paralyzing facial muscles and giving the impression that half of his face was smiling. It is unclear how or who was responsible for Carrone losing his eye. As a result of the injury, he suffered from depth perception issues in the years following his accident. Fellow crew member Joseph Ianuzzi described Carrone before his disfigurement as \\"a tall and handsome Italian\\". Carrone suffered from narcissistic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder. After his disfigurement, Carrone's condition was made worse by a severe case of posttraumatic stress disorder. Being put on the shelf Carrone was exiled from his crew and the Gambino family for robbing banks without Fatico's permission. Carrone now started robbing banks on his own. In May 1972 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agents Patrick Colgan and Thomas D'Onofrio were looking for Carrone about a string of bank robberies in New York. A number of bank tellers implicated Carrone, describing him as \\"bizarre looking man with one eye and a gun\\". One day the two agents spotted Carrone exiting an apartment building in Little Italy. Carrone saw the agents and drove off. The FBI chased him at speeds up to . As the agents approached children crossing at a cross walk, they attempted to slow down, but their brakes failed. Carrone sped away, but immediately plowed into a woman's car. When the agents got out of their car, a bystander told them that Carrone was hiding under the steering wheel in his vehicle. Almost immediately, Carrone popped out and starting firing at the agents. In the confusion, Carrone managed to escape. Angering the Mob After the FBI shootout, FBI supervisor John Good approached Fatico and told him to give up Carrone. Fatico could not comply because Carrone had fled to Boston. This caused a period of major FBI harassment brought on by Carrone shooting at the FBI agents. Furious at the trouble that Carrone had caused the Gambino family, Fatico put a contract on Carrone. Fatico allegedly offered to induct anyone who murdered Carrone into the Gambino family. However, Carrone remained a fugitive. He was also featured as a fugitive on the television program America's Most Wanted, but no one turned him in. Capture in Massachusetts In 1974, low on money, Carrone robbed a bank in East Boston, Massachusetts in the Financial District, Boston, Massachusetts. However, a silent alarm went off and Massachusetts state police troopers were soon chasing him. The troopers chased Carrone into some nearby woods. One trooper, tiptoeing through some heavy underbrush, suddenly heard three loud clicks behind him. He turned with his gun drawn and saw Carrone standing there, his gun pointed at the trooper's head; Carrone was out of ammunition, however. As the trooper leveled his own gun at Carrone, Carrone pleaded with the trooper, \\"Do it\\". The trooper spared Carrone's life and arrested him. Time in prison Carrone was sent to prison at Massachusetts Correctional Institution - Cedar Junction in Walpole, Massachusetts. Carrone feared that he would be murdered by his former associates in the Gambino family, and so suffered from insomnia brought on by anxiety and chronic fatigue syndrome. In 1975, Carrone died in prison of an undiagnosed supraventricular tachycardia brought on by hypertension, starvation, and malnourishment.

He was the victim of an illegal eavesdropping operation by the BfV (the German secret service), because he was falsely suspected of passing on secret information to people sympathizing with terrorism, notably the Red Army Faction. Biography Traube was born in Hanover, the son of a social democrat Jewish dentist. In 1936 his father committed suicide‚Äîhe could no longer bear the terror of the National Socialists. Because of his Jewish background, Klaus had to leave the Gymnasium he attended. Towards the end of World War II, at the age of 17, he was briefly put into an Arbeitslager (labor camp).SWR (2006) Portr√§t von Klaus Traube After the war, despite his bad experiences, Traube stayed in Germany and studied mechanical engineering (Maschinenbau) and romance studies. Traube started work at the German AEG, where he quickly rose to become director of the department for nuclear power. He then lived abroad for some time (he worked for General Dynamics in San Diego). Traube returned to Germany and became head of Interatom, a component company of the Kraftwerk Union, which was part of the Siemens conglomerate. Among other things he was responsible for the development of the German fast breeder-project in Kalkar.2000 Nuclear-Free Future Lifetime Achievement Award Traube was originally a proponent of nuclear power, but the report of the Club of Rome, The Limits to Growth, in 1972 made him slowly change his view. As a result, he had contacts with the student movement in Germany, which at that time was slowly becoming more militant. He was also alleged to have contacts with sympathisers of the Red Army Fraction. The BfV therefore started to monitor him intensively. He was suspected of passing secret information to people sympathising with terrorism. In a covert operation called \\"Operation M√ºll\\" (\\"operation rubbish\\"), the BND in 1975 planted a number of wiretaps in Traube's apartment. They also later informed his employer who, as a result, fired him. This illegal operation was uncovered in 1977 by the newspaper Der Spiegel and led to the dismissal of the then minister of the interior Werner Maihofer one year later. Traube was cleared of all charges.See Lauschaff√§re Traube in German Wikipedia. The Three Mile Island accident in 1979 finally transformed him into an open opponent of nuclear power.Sperfeld, Stefan (2007) Atomkritiker Klaus Traube zu Gast im Haus der Natur. M√§rkische Allgemeine Since then, he had been one of the most prominent and influential critics of nuclear power. Traube did not believe that the operation of nuclear-power plants was economically feasible or that it was possible to overcome the security risks. Also the construction of fast breeders, essential in the long- term use of nuclear power, was in his view too difficult to be realistic.Traube, Klaus (2005) Was wird aus der Atomkraft? in: Natur und Kosmos, May He was a strong supporter of renewable energy. During the 1980s Traube achieved iconic status among Germans opposed to nuclear power. From 1990 to 1997, he was Director of the Institute for Energy-economics and Energy-politics at the University of Bremen.Klaus Traube - Kurzbiografie Klaus Traube died on 4 September aged 88 in the city of Oberursel, where he used to live.

tropical mainland Central and South America, and Trinidad and Tobago. They are compact forest birds, the males typically being brightly colored, although the females of most species are duller and usually green- plumaged. Manakins feed on small fruits, berries and insects. Twenty-four species have been recorded in Peru. *Dwarf tyrant-manakin, Tyranneutes stolzmanni *Saffron-crested tyrant-manakin, Neopelma chrysocephalum *Sulphur- bellied tyrant-manakin, Neopelma sulphureiventer *Jet manakin, Chloropipo unicolor *Blue-backed manakin, Chiroxiphia pareola *Yungas manakin, Chiroxiphia boliviana *Golden-winged manakin, Masius chrysopterus *Black manakin, Xenopipo atronitens *Green manakin, Cryptopipo holochlora *Blue- crowned manakin, Lepidothrix coronata *Blue-rumped manakin, Lepidothrix isidorei *Cerulean-capped manakin, Lepidothrix coeruleocapilla (E) *Orange- crowned manakin, Heterocercus aurantiivertex *Flame-crowned manakin, Heterocercus linteatus (H) *White-bearded manakin, Manacus manacus *Wire- tailed manakin, Pipra filicauda *Band-tailed manakin, Pipra fasciicauda *Striolated manakin, Machaeropterus striolatus *Painted manakin, Machaeropterus eckelberryi (E) *Fiery-capped manakin, Machaeropterus pyrocephalus *White-crowned manakin, Pseudopipra pipra *Golden-headed manakin, Ceratopipra erythrocephala *Red-headed manakin, Ceratopipra rubrocapilla *Round-tailed manakin, Ceratopipra chloromeros Cotingas Order: PasseriformesFamily: Cotingidae The cotingas are birds of forests or forest edges in tropical South America. Comparatively little is known about this diverse group, although all have broad bills with hooked tips, rounded wings, and strong legs. The males of many of the species are brightly colored or decorated with plumes or wattles. Thirty species have been recorded in Peru. *Green-and-black fruiteater, Pipreola riefferii *Band-tailed fruiteater, Pipreola intermedia *Barred fruiteater, Pipreola arcuata *Black-chested fruiteater, Pipreola lubomirskii *Masked fruiteater, Pipreola pulchra (E) *Scarlet-breasted fruiteater, Pipreola frontalis *Fiery-throated fruiteater, Pipreola chlorolepidota *Scaled fruiteater, Ampelioides tschudii *White- cheeked cotinga, Zaratornis stresemanni (E) *Peruvian plantcutter, Phytotoma raimondii (E) *Bay-vented cotinga, Doliornis sclateri (E) *Red-crested cotinga, Ampelion rubrocristatus *Chestnut-crested cotinga, Ampelion rufaxilla *Black-necked red-cotinga, Phoenicircus nigricollis *Andean cock-of-the-rock, Rupicola peruviana *Gray-tailed piha, Snowornis subalaris *Olivaceous piha, Snowornis cryptolophus *Purple-throated fruitcrow, Querula purpurata *Red- ruffed fruitcrow, Pyroderus scutatus *Amazonian umbrellabird, Cephalopterus ornatus *Plum-throated cotinga, Cotinga maynana *Purple-breasted cotinga, Cotinga cotinga *Spangled cotinga, Cotinga cayana *Dusky piha, Lipaugus fuscocinereus *Scimitar-winged piha, Lipaugus uropygialis *Screaming piha, Lipaugus vociferans *Purple-throated cotinga, Porphyrolaema porphyrolaema *Pompadour cotinga, Xipholena punicea *Bare-necked fruitcrow, Gymnoderus foetidus *Black-faced cotinga, Conioptilon mcilhennyi Tityras Order: PasseriformesFamily: Tityridae Tityridae are suboscine passerine birds found in forest and woodland in the Neotropics. The species in this family were formerly spread over the families Tyrannidae, Pipridae, and Cotingidae. They are small to medium-sized birds. They do not have the sophisticated vocal capabilities of the songbirds. Most, but not all, have plain coloring. Twenty- two species have been recorded in Peru. *Black-crowned tityra, Tityra inquisitor *Black-tailed tityra, Tityra cayana *Masked tityra, Tityra semifasciata *Varzea schiffornis, Schiffornis major *Northern schiffornis, Schiffornis veraepacis *Foothill schiffornis, Schiffornis aenea *Brown-winged schiffornis, Schiffornis turdina *Cinereous mourner, Laniocera hypopyrra *White-browed purpletuft, Iodopleura isabellae *Shrike-like cotinga, Laniisoma elegans *White-naped xenopsaris, Xenopsaris albinucha (V) *Green-backed becard, Pachyramphus viridis *Barred becard, Pachyramphus versicolor *Slaty becard, Pachyramphus spodiurus *Cinereous becard, Pachyramphus rufus *Chestnut-crowned becard, Pachyramphus castaneus *White-winged becard, Pachyramphus polychopterus *Black-and-white becard, Pachyramphus albogriseus *Black-capped becard, Pachyramphus marginatus *One-colored becard, Pachyramphus homochrous *Pink-throated becard, Pachyramphus minor *Crested becard, Pachyramphus validus Sharpbill Order: PasseriformesFamily: Oxyruncidae The sharpbill is a small bird of dense forests in Central and South America. It feeds mostly on fruit but also eats insects. *Sharpbill, Oxyruncus cristatus Royal flycatchers Order: PasseriformesFamily: Onychorhynchidae In 2019 the SACC determined that these five species, which were formerly considered tyrant flycatchers, belonged in their own family. *Royal flycatcher, Onychorhynchus coronatus *Ruddy-tailed flycatcher, Terenotriccus erythrurus *Tawny-breasted flycatcher, Myiobius villosus *Sulphur-rumped flycatcher, Myiobius barbatus *Black-tailed flycatcher, Myiobius atricaudus Tyrant flycatchers Order: PasseriformesFamily: Tyrannidae Tyrant flycatchers are passerine birds which occur throughout North and South America. They superficially resemble the Old World flycatchers, but are more robust and have stronger bills. They do not have the sophisticated vocal capabilities of the songbirds. Most, but not all, have plain coloring. As the name implies, most are insectivorous. Peru has the largest number of tyrant flycatchers of any country and it is indeed the largest assemblage of a family in any country on earth. Two hundred forty-eight have been recorded there. *Wing-barred piprites, Piprites chloris *Cinnamon manakin-tyrant, Neopipo cinnamomea *Cinnamon-crested spadebill, Platyrinchus saturatus *White-

Castle D√ºrnkrut (pictured) is the most famous landmark of the town. The town is agricultural with some noteworthy businesses. Crops grown in the flatter areas are canola, corn, sunflowers and sugar beets. The rolling hils are planted with wine grapes by local vintners. D√ºrnkrut is located on the March river, which often floods and also forms the border with Slovakia. The last big flood was in 2006, at which time many houses near to the river were flooded with 2 meters of water. D√ºrnkrut is located on the Austrian Railways Nordbahn line. In former times there was a big sugar factory that made the sugar beets into refined sugar. It was closed down many years ago but some of the buildings are still standing. The wine street offers many old wines. The sister town of Waidendorf is located 2 km away, and has even more on.

After a slow-down in business in the mid-1980s and Black Monday of 1987, Odyssey Partners acquired the company in 1988, through a leveraged buyout. A proposed sale was met with a lawsuit, although the Interlan division was sold to Racal in 1989. Black Box was re-organized in 1990 after losses from the debt servicing. Despite getting $5.5 million in fees for the deal, Drexel Burnham Lambert filed for its own bankruptcy the same year. The no- action letter from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in June 1990 has been used as a legal precedent for similar cases. The profitable catalog sales business moved from Simi Valley in California to Lawrence, Pennsylvania and changed its name to Black Box Incorporated. The telecommunications product business was split out to a subsidiary called Micom Communications Corporation.not to be confused with Micom Systems An initial public offering was made in December 1992 to cover the debt used to finance the 1990 deal (after two previous failed attempts), under the name MB Communications. In 1994, the Micom Communications unit was spun off, and acquired by Northern Telecom (Nortel) in June 1996. In January 2019, AGC Networks acquired Black Box Corporation, making Black Box a wholly owned subsidiary of AGC. Black Box continues to operate as a worldwide telecommunications provider independently.

They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish. *Black skimmer, Rynchops niger Gulls Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Laridae Laridae is a family of medium to large seabirds and includes gulls, kittiwakes, and terns. Gulls are typically gray or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with gray or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water.

Storks are mute, but bill-clattering is an important mode of communication at the nest. Their nests can be large and may be reused for many years. Many species are migratory. *Maguari stork, Ciconia maguari *Jabiru, Jabiru mycteria *Wood stork, Mycteria americana Anhingas Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Anhingas are often called \\"snake-birds\\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape, and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. *Anhinga, Anhinga anhinga Cormorants Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage coloration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colorful. *Neotropic cormorant, Phalacrocorax brasilianus Herons Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons, and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises, and spoonbills. *Rufescent tiger-heron, Tigrisoma lineatum *Fasciated tiger-heron, Tigrisoma fasciatum *Agami heron, Agamia agami *Boat-billed heron, Cochlearius cochlearius *Zigzag heron, Zebrilus undulatus *Pinnated bittern, Botaurus pinnatus *Least bittern, Ixobrychus exilis *Stripe-backed bittern, Ixobrychus involucris *Black-crowned night-heron, Nycticorax nycticorax *Striated heron, Butorides striata *Cattle egret, Bubulcus ibis *Cocoi heron, Ardea cocoi *Great egret, Ardea alba *Whistling heron, Syrigma sibilatrix *Capped heron, Pilherodius pileatus *Snowy egret, Egretta thula *Little blue heron, Egretta caerulea Ibises Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Threskiornithidae Threskiornithidae is a family of large terrestrial and wading birds which includes the ibises and spoonbills.

mahseer, Khudree mahseer, or black mahseer, is a freshwater fish of the carp family found in major rivers and reservoirs of India and Sri Lanka. Found throughout India, following large-scale introductions of artificially-bred fish across the country Mahseer breeding and conservation and possibilities of commercial culture. The Indian experience. (by Ogale, S.N.) (annex 2), but found of the largest size and in the greatest abundance in mountain or rocky streams.Day, F. (1889) Fauna of British India. Fish. Volume 1.FishBase entry for Tor khudree Deccan mahseer The fish as originally described by Sykes in his November 1838 paper 'On the Fishes of the Dukhun' Details - On the fishes of the Dukhun - Biodiversity Heritage Library as Barbus khudree, is a silvery-bluish coloured fish, with blood red fins or fins tipped with a bluish tinge. The type locality is the Mula-Mutha River close to the Indian city of Pune, a part of the Krishna River basin. Although there have been efforts to artificially breed this mahseer since the early1970's , there is no way to determine if these fish are Tor khudree, as the populations within the type locality have gone extinct Pinder, A.C., Britton, J.R., Harrison, A.J. et al. Rev Fish Biol Fisheries (2019). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11160-019-09566-y. It has been reported that the fish moves to upper reaches of small streams to spawn, which is a common spawning strategy of mahseer. They feed on plants, fruits, insects, shrimps and molluscs and may be grown in ponds. They are predatory, and even prey on smaller mahseer. While large fish of over a metre and 45 kg in weight have been recorded, such sizes are no longer found in the type locality. In the River Cauvery, fish to over 30 kg are being caught in recent years. Description The lips are thick, with an uninterrupted fold across the lower jaw, and with both the upper and lower lips in some specimens produced in the mesial line. The maxillary pair of barbels are longer than the rostral, and extending to below the last third of the eye. Fins the dorsal arises opposite the ventral, and is three fourths as high as the body; its last undivided ray is smooth, osseous, strong, and of varying length and thickness. Himalayan, Bengal, and Central Indian specimens generally have the spine strong, and from one half to two thirds the length of the head, it rarely exceeds this extent. In Canara, Malabar, and Southern India, where the lips are largely developed, the spine is very much stronger and as long as the head excluding the snout. Pectoral as long as the head excluding the snout ; it reaches the ventral, which is little shorter. Anal laid flat does not reach the base of the caudal, which is deeply forked. Lateral line complete, 2 to 2.5 rows of scales between it and the base of the ventral fin ; 9 rows before the dorsal. Colour silvery or greenish along the upper half of the body, becoming silvery shot with gold on the sides and beneath. Lower fins reddish yellow. These two fish (photo, right) from brood stock of Tor khudree sampled at Karnataka state fishery department hatchery at Harangi reservoir demonstrate the difficulties of making correct identifications. One is a slim- bodied fish with a more golden body and orange-coloured fins, the other is deep-bodied with a silver-grey body colouration and blue fins. Both are genetically identical to the stocks known as Tor khudree sourced from the Tata Power hatchery at Lonavla, Maharastra.  Status = Conservation  T. khudree has also been recently reported as one of the winter exclusive fishes in the Chambal river basin of Central India (Madhya Pradesh). Ranching and creation of a winter-time freshwater protected area have been recommended at Ghatbilod (Indore, Madhya Pradesh) dedicated for conservation of this Mahseer species. Record catches H. S. Thomas in his Rod in India quotes a note by G. P. Sanderson:Thomas, H. S. 1897. The Rod in India. W. Thacker and Co. Note: the head and skin of this fish were moved from Bangalore Museum and are now held in the Regional Museum of Natural History Mysore. A research visit by a team from Mahseer Trust determined, through taxonomic investigation, that this fish was clearly an endemic Tor remadevii, not an introduced Tor khudree.

The following tags have been used to highlight certain categories of occurrence. *(V) Vagrant - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Paraguay *(E) Endemic - a species endemic to Paraguay *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Paraguay as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions *(H) Hypothetical - a species recorded but with \\"no tangible evidence\\" according to the SACC Rheas Order: RheiformesFamily: Rheidae The rheas are large flightless birds native to South America. Their feet have three toes rather than four which allows them to run faster. One species has been recorded in Paraguay. *Greater rhea, Rhea americana Tinamous Order: TinamiformesFamily: Tinamidae The tinamous are among the most ancient groups of birds. Although they look similar to other ground-dwelling birds like quail and grouse, they have no close relatives and are classified as a single family, Tinamidae, within their own order, the Tinamiformes. They are distantly related to the ratites (order Struthioniformes) that includes the rheas, emus, and kiwis. Twelve species have been recorded in Paraguay. *Solitary tinamou, Tinamus solitarius *Brown tinamou, Crypturellus obsoletus *Undulated tinamou, Crypturellus undulatus *Small-billed tinamou, Crypturellus parvirostris *Tataupa tinamou, Crypturellus tataupa *Red-winged tinamou, Rhynchotus rufescens *Brushland tinamou, Nothoprocta cinerascens *White-bellied nothura, Nothura boraquira *Lesser nothura, Nothura minor *Spotted nothura, Nothura maculosa *Dwarf tinamou, Taoniscus nanus (H) *Quebracho crested-tinamou, Eudromia formosa Screamers Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anhimidae The screamers are a small family of birds related to the ducks. They are large, bulky birds, with a small downy head, long legs and large feet which are only partially webbed. They have large spurs on their wings which are used in fights over mates and in territorial disputes. Two species have been recorded in Paraguay. *Horned screamer, Anhima cornuta *Southern screamer, Chauna torquata Ducks Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating.

The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Variation in length of legs and bills enables multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food. Twenty-three species have been recorded in Paraguay. *Upland sandpiper, Bartramia longicauda *Eskimo curlew, Numenius borealis (believed extinct) *Hudsonian godwit, Limosa haemastica *Ruddy turnstone, Arenaria interpres (V) *Red knot, Calidris canutus *Stilt sandpiper, Calidris himantopus *Sanderling, Calidris alba *Dunlin, Calidris alpina (V) *Baird's sandpiper, Calidris bairdii *Least sandpiper, Calidris minutilla (V) *White-rumped sandpiper, Calidris fuscicollis *Buff-breasted sandpiper, Calidris subruficollis *Pectoral sandpiper, Calidris melanotos *Semipalmated sandpiper, Calidris pusilla (H) *Short-billed dowitcher, Limnodromus griseus (H) *Giant snipe, Gallinago undulata *South American snipe, Gallinago paraguaiae *Wilson's phalarope, Phalaropus tricolor *Red phalarope, Phalaropus fulicarius (V) *Spotted sandpiper, Actitis macularia *Solitary sandpiper, Tringa solitaria *Greater yellowlegs, Tringa melanoleuca *Lesser yellowlegs, Tringa flavipes Jacanas Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Jacanidae The jacanas are a group of waders which are found throughout the tropics. They are identifiable by their huge feet and claws which enable them to walk on floating vegetation in the shallow lakes that are their preferred habitat. One species has been recorded in Paraguay. *Wattled jacana, Jacana jacana Painted-snipes Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Rostratulidae Painted-snipes are short-legged, long- billed birds similar in shape to the true snipes, but more brightly colored. One species has been recorded in Paraguay. *South American painted-snipe, Rostratula semicollaris Skimmers Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Rynchopidae Skimmers are a small family of tropical tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish. One species has been recorded in Paraguay. *Black skimmer, Rynchops niger Gulls Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Laridae Laridae is a family of medium to large seabirds and includes gulls, kittiwakes, terns, and skimmers. Gulls are typically gray or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with gray or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. Twelve species of Laridae have been recorded in Paraguay. *Brown-hooded gull, Chroicocephalus maculipennis (V) *Gray-hooded gull, Chroicocephalus cirrocephalus *Laughing Gull, Leucophaeus atricilla (V) *Franklin's Gull, Leucophaeus pipixcan (V) *Yellow-billed tern, Sternula superciliaris *Large-billed tern, Phaetusa simplex *Gull-billed Tern, Gelochelidon nilotica (V) *Whiskered tern, Chlidonias hybrida (V) *Common Tern, Sterna hirundo (V) *Arctic tern, Sterna paradisaea (V) *Snowy-crowned Tern, Sterna trudeaui (H) *Royal Tern, Thalasseus maximus (H) Storks Order: CiconiiformesFamily: Ciconiidae Storks are large, long-legged, long- necked, wading birds with long, stout bills. Storks are mute, but bill- clattering is an important mode of communication at the nest. Their nests can be large and may be reused for many years. Many species are migratory. Three species have been recorded in Paraguay. *Maguari stork, Ciconia maguari *Jabiru, Jabiru mycteria *Wood stork, Mycteria americana Anhingas Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Anhingas are often called \\"snake-birds\\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape, and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. One species has been recorded in Paraguay. *Anhinga, Anhinga anhinga Cormorants Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage colouration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colorful. One species has been recorded in Paraguay. *Neotropic cormorant, Phalacrocorax brasilianus Herons Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills. Fourteen species have been recorded in Paraguay. *Rufescent tiger-heron, Tigrisoma lineatum *Boat-billed heron, Cochlearius cochlearius *Pinnated bittern, Botaurus pinnatus *Least bittern, Ixobrychus exilis *Stripe-backed bittern, Ixobrychus involucris *Black-crowned night-heron, Nycticorax nycticorax *Striated heron, Butorides striata *Cattle egret, Bubulcus ibis *Cocoi heron, Ardea cocoi *Great egret, Ardea alba *Whistling heron, Syrigma sibilatrix *Capped heron, Pilherodius pileatus *Snowy egret, Egretta thula *Little blue heron, Egretta caerulea (V) Ibises Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Threskiornithidae Threskiornithidae is a family of large terrestrial and wading birds which includes the ibises and spoonbills.

Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. However, unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have a good sense of smell with which they locate carrion. Five species have been recorded in Paraguay. *King vulture, Sarcoramphus papa *Andean condor, Vultur gryphus (H) *Black vulture, Coragyps atratus *Turkey vulture, Cathartes aura *Lesser yellow-headed vulture, Cathartes burrovianus Osprey Order: AccipitriformesFamily: Pandionidae The family Pandionidae contains only one species, the osprey. The osprey is a medium-large raptor which is a specialist fish-eater with a worldwide distribution. *Osprey, Pandion haliaetus Hawks Order: AccipitriformesFamily: Accipitridae Accipitriformes is an order of birds of prey, which includes hawks, eagles, kites, harriers (all Accipitridae), the osprey (Pandionidae), and New World vultures (Cathartidae). These birds have powerful hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons, and keen eyesight.

Found in tropical woodlands worldwide, they feed on insects and fruit, and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly any distance. Trogons have soft, often colorful, feathers with distinctive male and female plumage. Three species have been recorded in Paraguay. *Blue-crowned trogon, Trogon curucui *Surucua trogon, Trogon surrucura *Black-throated trogon, Trogon rufus Motmots Order: CoraciiformesFamily: Momotidae The motmots have colorful plumage and long, graduated tails which they display by waggling back and forth. In most of the species, the barbs near the ends of the two longest (central) tail feathers are weak and fall off, leaving a length of bare shaft and creating a racket-shaped tail. Two species have been recorded in Paraguay. *Rufous-capped motmot, Baryphthengus ruficapillus *Amazonian motmot, Momotus momota Kingfishers Order: CoraciiformesFamily: Alcedinidae Kingfishers are medium-sized birds with large heads, long, pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails.

They feed on insects caught on the wing, and are glossy, elegant birds with long bills and tails. In appearance and behavior they resemble the Old World bee-eaters, although they are more closely related to puffbirds. One species has been recorded in Paraguay. *Rufous-tailed jacamar, Galbula ruficauda Puffbirds Order: GalbuliformesFamily: Bucconidae The puffbirds are related to the jacamars and have the same range, but lack the iridescent colors of that family. They are mainly brown, rufous, or gray, with large heads and flattened bills with hooked tips. The loose abundant plumage and short tails makes them look stout and puffy, giving rise to the English common name of the family. Four species have been recorded in Paraguay. *Buff-bellied puffbird, Notharchus swainsoni *White-eared puffbird, Nystalus chacuru *Spot-backed puffbird, Nystalus maculatus *Rusty-breasted nunlet, Nonnula rubecula Toucans Order: PiciformesFamily: Ramphastidae Toucans are near passerine birds from the Neotropics.

By December 2006, he had launched a full and international educational initiative, known as the 'In One Hour' series, with The Whole of Jewish History in One Hour continuing as the flagship presentation. The series comprises a catalogue of lectures, each of which provides basic introductions to a range of areas in Jewish Studies, grounded in traditional Jewish sources and combined, in some cases, with original visual mapping techniques. In 2008 Solomon produced a book called The Whole of Jewish History in One Hour. Solomon is unequivocal in his promotion of Jewish History and Hebrew as the two most essential areas of learning for the Jewish world today. He also decries educational approaches in which students remain dependent on teachers for access to Jewish ideas and texts. Solomon aims to provide students with the necessary tools to be able to take responsibility for their own Jewish education by having the ability to read Jewish texts directly (Hebrew) and to understand these sources in context (Jewish history). In March 2012, Solomon moved to Sydney in order take up a commissioned scholarship in residence with \\"synthesising teachings from a range of cultures\\"-organisation Neshama Life The founder of Neshama Life centre in Sydney, Australia, for Kabbalah, yoga, meditation and spirituality is Dr. Orna Triguboff, daughter of Harry Triguboff, Australian property developer and one of Australia's richest citizens. to complete the first-ever translation into English of the kabbalistic text Tikunei haZohar.

He was born in the town of Bratunac in the Austro-Hungarian occupied Bosnia Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. Imprisoned during World War I for his membership of the revolutionary movement Young Bosnia, he subsequently completed a law degree and became an officer in the gendarmerie of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes at the beginning of 1928. In 1929, the country changed its name to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1940 Dangiƒá was appointed to lead the court gendarmerie detachment stationed at the royal palace in the capital, Belgrade. During the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, Dangiƒá commanded the gendarmerie unit that escorted King Peter II to Montenegro as he fled the country. In August of that year, the leader of the Chetnik movement, Colonel Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá, appointed Dangiƒá as the commander of the Chetnik forces in eastern Bosnia. Here, Dangiƒá and his men launched several attacks against the forces of the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH). Soon after his appointment, Dangiƒá's Chetniks captured the town of Srebrenica. Afterwards, they became largely inactive in fighting the Germans, choosing instead to avoid confrontation. In December, Chetniks under Dangiƒá's command massacred hundreds of Bosnian Muslims in the town of Gora≈æde. In the same month, his Chetniks captured five nuns and took them with them through Romanija to Gora≈æde, where they later committed suicide to avoid being raped. In January 1942, Dangiƒá ordered his forces to not resist German and NDH troops during the anti-Partisan offensive known as Operation Southeast Croatia. Afterwards, he was invited to Belgrade to negotiate the terms of proposed Chetnik collaboration with the Germans with the head of the collaborationist puppet government in the German-occupied territory of Serbia, Milan Nediƒá, and the Wehrmacht military commander of the territory, General der Artillerie Paul Bader. Although a deal was struck, it was vetoed by the Wehrmacht Commander in Southeast Europe, General der Pioniere Walter Kuntze, who remained suspicious of Dangiƒá. Despite this, Dangiƒá's Chetniks collaborated with German forces in eastern Bosnia over a period of several months beginning in December 1941. In April 1942, Dangiƒá was arrested when he travelled to occupied Serbia despite promising to operate only within the territory of Bosnia, and was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in German-occupied Poland. In 1943, he escaped from the camp and the following year participated in the Warsaw Uprising as a member of the Polish Home Army. In 1945, he was captured by the Soviet Red Army and was extradited to Yugoslavia, where he stood accused of committing war crimes. In 1947, he was tried, convicted, sentenced to death and executed by Yugoslavia's new communist authorities. Early life and interwar period Jezdimir Dangiƒá was born on 4 May 1897 in Bratunac, which was at that time in the Austro-Hungarian occupied Bosnia Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. He was one of ten children born to Savo, a Serbian Orthodox priest, and Milica (). He attended high school in Tuzla, about north-west of Bratunac, and was a communist sympathiser in his youth. He was also one of the youngest members of the pan-Slavic revolutionary organisation known as Young Bosnia (, ). On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated in Sarajevo by one of Dangiƒá's Young Bosnia comrades, Gavrilo Princip. This event sparked the outbreak of World War I. After the assassination, Dangiƒá was arrested by the Austro-Hungarian police. In September 1915, he was tried alongside 32 co-defendants in Bihaƒá and convicted of partaking in revolutionary activities, for which he was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison. Dangiƒá's parents were also arrested. His father was found guilty of treason and sentenced to death, but his sentence was later reduced to three-and-a-half years' imprisonment. Dangiƒá's mother was never tried; she suffered a mental breakdown after spending several months in solitary confinement and her trial was postponed indefinitely. Dangiƒá was released from prison at the end of the war in November 1918. The following year, he helped organise a series of pro- communist demonstrations in Belgrade, for which he was arrested and imprisoned. In 1920, he was conscripted into the army of the newly-created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and assigned to a gendarmerie unit stationed in Kratovo (in modern-day North Macedonia). Upon being discharged from the gendarmerie, Dangiƒá returned to Belgrade, where he enrolled at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Law. He also became a member of the League of Farmers, a political party that sought to protect the interests of the Bosnian Serb peasantry, and which the historian Marko Attila Hoare describes as a precursor to the Chetnik movement in Bosnia and Herzegovina during World War II. Dangiƒá was again drafted into the gendarmerie on 3 January 1928, this time as a cavalry sub-lieutenant, and was stationed in the border town of Subotica in the Vojvodina region. His career included assignments at Virovitica, Sarajevo, Tuzla, Sremska Kamenica near Novi Sad, and Zagreb. Dangiƒá and his wife Nevena had three children, a son named Ljubi≈°a and two daughters, Nada and Ljijana. Between 1937 and 1941, Dangiƒá published ten articles in the Belgrade daily Politika. He published his first novel in 1938, titled Na≈°e tamnovanje (Our Imprisonment). The novel was published under the pseudonym Miroljub Bogiƒá. It was a critical success. In 1940, Dangiƒá published a second novel, titled Glad i tamnica (Hunger and the Dungeon), which was also well received. In 1940, Dangiƒá was named head of the gendarmerie detachment stationed at Belgrade's royal palace. By the time of the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, he had reached the rank of major. World War II=Invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia A map showing the alt=map showing the partition of Yugoslavia, 1941‚Äì43 In April 1941, Yugoslavia was invaded and quickly defeated by the Axis powers. During the invasion, Dangiƒá was assigned to command the gendarmerie unit that escorted King Peter II to Nik≈°iƒá Airport as he left the country. Yugoslavia was partitioned, and as part of this, the Germans established a military government of occupation in an area roughly the same as the pre-1912 Kingdom of Serbia, consisting of Serbia proper, the northern part of Kosovo (around Kosovska Mitrovica), and the Banat. The Germans did this to secure two strategic lines of communication ‚Äì the Danube river, and the railway line that connected Belgrade with Salonika in occupied Greece, and thence by sea to North Africa. The German-occupied territory of Serbia was also rich in non-ferrous metals such as lead, antimony and copper, which Germany needed to support its war effort. During the invasion, the extreme Croat nationalist and fascist Ante Paveliƒá, who had been in exile in Benito Mussolini's Italy, was installed by the Germans as Poglavnik (leader) of an Usta≈°e-led Croatian state ‚Äì the Independent State of Croatia (often called the NDH, from the ). The NDH combined almost all of modern-day Croatia, all of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern-day Serbia into an \\"Italian-German quasi-protectorate.\\" NDH authorities, led by the Usta≈°e militia, subsequently implemented genocidal policies against the Serb, Jewish and Romani population living within the borders of the new state. Following the failure of the initial collaborationist puppet government in the German- occupied territory of Serbia, the Commissioner Government, Milan Nediƒá, a pre- war politician who was known to have pro-Axis leanings, was then selected by the Germans to lead the Government of National Salvation. Two guerilla movements emerged in occupied Yugoslavia ‚Äì the Serb nationalist Chetniks, led by Colonel (later General) Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá, and the multi-ethnic, Communist- led Yugoslav Partisans, led by Josip Broz Tito. Command in east BosniaBackground= At the time of the Yugoslav surrender on 18 April 1941, Dangiƒá was in Belgrade. He obeyed the summons of Milan Aƒáimoviƒá, head of the Commissioner Government, to serve in the Serbian gendarmerie and did so until mid-August. When news reached him of the Usta≈°e massacres of Serbs in the Bosnia areas of the NDH, he sought permission to travel there and escort his family and relatives to safety. His request was approved, and he travelled via Mihailoviƒá's headquarters at Ravna Gora. Early on, Mihailoviƒá designated Dangiƒá as one of three men who were to succeed him as leaders of the Chetnik movement should anything happen to him. Initially, Mihailoviƒá's organisation was focussed on recruiting and establishing groups in different areas, raising funds, establishing a courier network, and collecting arms and ammunition. From the very beginning their strategy was to organise and build up their strength, but postpone armed operations against the occupation forces until they were withdrawing in the face of a hoped-for landing by the Western Allies in Yugoslavia. Dangiƒá likewise sought to avoid conflict with the Germans and began to pursue a policy of \\"self-defence against the Usta≈°e and revenge against the Croats and Muslims.\\" Mihailoviƒá sent Dangiƒá to eastern Bosnia to take command of the Chetnik detachments in the region and bring them under Mihailoviƒá's control, and he collected a group of Bosnian Serbs and crossed the Drina River into the NDH. Dangiƒá was accompanied by Major Bo≈°ko Todoroviƒá who had been appointed by Mihailoviƒá as his commander for eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. Dangiƒá himself was appointed as the commander of the Mountain Staff of the Bosnian Chetnik Detachments, and had direct responsibility for eastern Bosnia, including the senior local Chetnik commanders, Aƒáim Babiƒá and Rade Kosoriƒá. According to the historian Marko Attila Hoare, Dangiƒá may have had more influence on Chetnik decision-making, despite his formal subordination to Todoroviƒá. Todoroviƒá was responsible for negotiating with the Italians, and Dangiƒá with the Germans. At the time Dangiƒá arrived in eastern Bosnia, some Chetnik detachments were still co-operating with the Partisans in the region. =Initial activities and liaison with the Partisans= Dangiƒá arrived in east Bosnia on 16 August. In the beginning, his operations were directed primarily against the Usta≈°e and the Bosnian Muslim population of the area, where Dangiƒá exercised considerable influence over the Serb population. On 18 August, a 400-strong Chetnik force led by Dangiƒá captured the town of Srebrenica. The Chetniks confiscated all weapons that were in the hands of the local inhabitants and began recruiting local Serbs to join the Chetniks. On 1 September, Babiƒá signed an agreement with the Partisan Sarajevo Oblast (district) Staff led by Slobodan Princip-Seljo and Bori≈°a Kovaƒçeviƒá to form a joint command. At the time, the Oblast Staff considered Babiƒá's troops were \\"semi-bandit\\", and that they had undermined the position of the Partisans with local Muslims. Princip-Seljo and Kovaƒçeviƒá had also intercepted one of Babiƒá's couriers carrying a message to the Germans. In the message Babiƒá offered to work with the Germans and assured them he was only interested in fighting the Usta≈°e. By early September, Dangiƒá had established himself as the leader of the Chetnik groups in eastern Bosnia, including those led by Babiƒá and Kosoriƒá. On 5 September, in response to a failed joint Partisan-Chetnik attack on Kladanj, he burnt a number of Muslim homes, and his Chetniks engaged in the robbing and beating of Muslim civilians. At this point, occasional killings of Muslims occurred, although Hoare describes this behaviour as being \\"not yet genocidal.\\" That month, under the direct orders of Dangiƒá, Chetniks burnt and looted the Muslim village of Novo Selo, killing Muslims and carrying out other crimes in the process. At the end of September, the Abwehr (German military intelligence) reported that Dangiƒá was supported by and was in contact with the Nediƒá administration. It also reported that \\"[Dangiƒá] has had good relations with the Germans and does everything in order to avoid collision between his troops and the Germans.\\" On 1 October 1941, Dangiƒá and two other east Bosnian Chetnik commanders, Pero ƒêukanoviƒá and Sergije Mihailoviƒá, met with the Partisan General Staff for Bosnia-Hercegovina at the village of Drinjaƒça south of Zvornik. The Partisans were Svetozar Vukmanoviƒá (known as \\"Tempo\\"), Rodoljub ƒåolakoviƒá and Princip-Seljo. The meeting agreed on the creation of a joint Chetnik-Partisan Staff, the \\"Command of the Bosnian Military and Partisan Detachments\\", to consist of six members, three Chetniks and three Partisans. The meeting also agreed that joint Chetnik-Partisan administration would be imposed on liberated areas, using the Partisan model of people's liberation committees. The resulting declaration was a compromise, and called on the patriotism of both Serbs and Bosnians, although Dangiƒá opposed the inclusion of any call for the unity of Muslims or Croats with the Serbs of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as he stated that all Muslims were responsible for the Usta≈°e crimes against Serbs. According to Hoare, the Drinjaƒça agreement represented the pinnacle of co-operation between Partisans and Chetniks in east Bosnia, but effectively sidelined the Provincial Committee. On 6 October, a further meeting was held at Miliƒái near Vlasenica, and the composition of the joint staff was decided. Dangiƒá, Babiƒá and Sergije Mihailoviƒá became the Chetnik representatives, and Vukmanoviƒá, ƒåolakoviƒá and Princip-Seljo represented the Partisans, with Sergije Mihailoviƒá appointed as chief of staff. After the war, the Drinjaƒça agreement was the subject of much heated debate between Vukmanoviƒá and ƒåolakoviƒá, with Vukmanoviƒá blaming ƒåolakoviƒá for the negative medium-term consequences of the agreement for the Partisan movement in east Bosnia. According to Vukmanoviƒá, these consequences included the virtual disappearance of an independent Partisan General Staff for Bosnia-Herzegovina, the domination of the joint staff by Sergije Mihailoviƒá, including his appointment of officers hostile to the Partisans as commanders of Partisan units, the diversion of weapons from the Partisan controlled arms factory at U≈æice to Chetnik troops, and the alienation of the Muslim and Croat population of the region. When Vukmanoviƒá raised his concerns with Tito, the Bosnian Communists were forced to insist that the joint staff could have no contact with Chetnik units except during operations against Axis forces, and no joint Chetnik-Partisan operations would be permitted in Muslim areas. Relations between the Partisans and Chetniks were placed under pressure by the continued targeting of Muslims by Chetnik units. Over the period of 13‚Äì23 October 1941, a joint Chetnik-Partisan operation captured the town of Rogatica. During and after its capture, Chetnik elements of the force burned and looted Muslim homes, and Partisan units refused to obey orders to stop the Chetniks, stating they would not defend the \\"Turks\\". During this time, Dangiƒá and his men cooperated with the Partisans in accordance with Chetnik policy at the time. Chetnik‚ÄìPartisan cooperation in areas under Dangiƒá's command continued to some extent even after the two groups began clashing. Dangiƒá is said to have held a \\"fierce hatred\\" of Muslims, allegedly saying that he wished to \\"kill them all\\", and that he had an \\"absolute willingness\\" to collaborate with the Germans. That autumn in the village of Zaklopaƒça, about east of Vlasenica, Chetniks commanded by Dangiƒá barricaded a group of Muslims in a local Muslim religious school which was then set alight, killing eighty- one people. Chetnik persecution of Muslims worsened after the break with the Partisans. The largest Chetnik massacres took place in eastern Bosnia and preceded any significant genocidal campaigns by the Usta≈°e, which began in the spring of 1942. According to Hoare, the massacres were \\"above all an expression of the genocidal policy and ideology of the Chetnik movement\\". Although his original objective was solely to protect the Serb population against the Usta≈°e, Dangiƒá quickly became an important factor in the conflict between the two groups in eastern Bosnia. The Germans sought to win Dangiƒá over to collaboration in order to strengthen anti-Partisan operations in the region, where Dangiƒá's Chetniks reportedly numbered about 10,000 men, but at this time neither Dangiƒá nor any of Mihailoviƒá's other commanders had any arrangement with the Germans. On 9 November 1941, Mihailoviƒá ordered Dangiƒá to attack Partisan forces in the Serbian town of U≈æice and to retain only his \\"most necessary units\\" in Bosnia. His order claimed that the Partisans were led by the Usta≈°e and were pursuing a \\"fratricidal war\\" amongst Serbs to \\"prevent the Chetniks from taking their revenge against the Croats.\\" However, Dangiƒá failed to carry out the attack, likely because he considered the strengthening of Chetniks in eastern Bosnia a greater priority and because Partisans in U≈æice had previously provided Chetniks in Srebrenica with arms and munitions from the local weapons factory. The factory later blew up on 21 November and the Partisans withdrew from U≈æice on 29 November after being forced out by the German 113th, 342nd, and 717th Infantry Divisions. =Vlasenica conference= The break between the forces of Mihailoviƒá and Tito in the German-occupied territory of Serbia spread to eastern Bosnia in early November. In response, a joint Partisan-Chetnik conference was held in Vlasenica on 16 November. It was convened by ƒåolakoviƒá and Vukmanoviƒá without consulting the Partisan Provincial Committee for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Serbian Partisans were situated at Ljubovija at the time, ready to launch an offensive across the Drina against Dangiƒá's forces in Bratunac and Srebrenica, but held off at ƒåolakoviƒá's request. At the conference, ƒåolakoviƒá tried to maintain the alliance, but Vukmanoviƒá raised Mihailoviƒá's attack on Tito's headquarters at U≈æice and the Chetnik's failure to fight Axis forces. Dangiƒá questioned Vukmanoviƒá's Montenegrin background and told him to return to Montenegro. The Partisan representatives sought a policy of brotherhood and unity among Serbs, Muslims, and Croats, whereas Dangiƒá stated that his Chetniks were fighting a purely Serbian war for the Serbian people. Dangiƒá's envoys told them they intended \\"to slit the throats of the Turks, except for any pretty Turkish ladies\\" and \\"screw down the Croats so hard that they wouldn't dare for a thousand years to look at a Serb askance.\\" At this conference the two sides failed to come to an agreement. The next day a separate Chetnik conference was held where a 14-article resolution was adopted in support of Dangiƒá's views. Meanwhile, the Partisan General Staff of Bosnia and Herzegovina appealed to the Chetnik rank and file that Partisan-Chetnik cooperation was broken due to the Chetnik importation of Royal Yugoslav Army officers from Serbia to Bosnia and due to Dangiƒá wanting \\"to turn our People's Liberation Struggle into a war of Serbs against Muslims\\" as opposed to the Partisan belief \\"that the peaceful toiling Muslim people is not to blame for the crimes that the Usta≈°e have committed, and that the People's Liberation Army must protect them from persecution and killing.\\" The Staff charged that Dangiƒá wished for \\"Serbs to gather for a war of revenge\\" instead of the Partisans' \\"summon to our flag all honorable people, Serbs, Muslims, and Croats.\\" They claimed that Dangiƒá attempted to collaborate with the Germans and Italians. =Capture of Gora≈æde and atrocities= View of Gora≈æde and the Drina river where the bodies of killed Bosnian Muslims were thrown. Sources vary to some extent in respect of the Chetnik massacre of Muslims in the town of Gora≈æde. According to Hoare, on 29 November 1941, the Italians handed Gora≈æde over to the Chetniks, who immediately massacred Croatian Home Guard prisoners and NDH officials. This expanded into the systematic killing of the Muslim civilian population. Their corpses were left hanging in the town or were tossed into the Drina. Several hundred civilians were killed in Gora≈æde at this time. Todoroviƒá had reached an agreement with Lieutenant-Colonel Castagnieri, commander of the Italian garrison in Gora≈æde, regarding Italian evacuation and hand over of Gora≈æde to the Chetniks. According to Tomislav Duliƒá, the town was occupied by Dangiƒá and his Chetniks on 1 December. Upon arrival, Dangiƒá gave a speech to a group of Serbs, Croats and Bosnian Muslims which contained references to Greater Serbia and ended with Dangiƒá proclaiming that Serbs and Bosnian Muslims could no longer live together. Following the speech, Chetniks spread through the town and began killing, raping, pillaging and torching homes. A significant number of victims were killed on a bridge over the Drina, after which their bodies were dropped into the river. Chetnik forces in Bosnia, including those of Dangiƒá, then set about pursuing an anti-Muslim campaign to recompense for the persecution experienced by ethnic Serbs in the NDH. On 11 December, Dangiƒá's Chetniks entered Pale and looted and burnt down the local convent. They captured five Sisters of Divine Charity ‚Äì two Croats, two Slovenes, and one Austrian ‚Äì and took them with them through Romanija to Gora≈æde, where on 15 December they committed suicide to avoid being raped. =Operation Southeast Croatia= In December 1941 and January 1942, Chetniks under Dangiƒá's command co-operated with the Germans in eastern Bosnia. Between December 1941 and April 1942, Dangiƒá engaged in direct negotiations with the Germans. During the latter half of December he met with Abwehr representatives numerous times in an effort to reach an agreement with them. In January 1942, Dangiƒá and other Chetnik leaders met with Renzo Dalmazzo, the commander of the Italian 6th Army Corps. By this time, Dangiƒá's cooperation with the Germans came to be seen as being even more valuable because of the arrival of Tito and his First Proletarian Brigade to eastern Bosnia. The Germans and Croats launched Operation Southeast Croatia on 17 January. Dangiƒá and Todoroviƒá advised other Chetnik commanders that the operation was targeted at the Partisans, and there was no need for the Chetniks to get involved. Following this, their units withdrew from their positions on the front line, let the Germans pass through their areas, or went home. Many withdrew across the Drina river into the German-occupied territory of Serbia to avoid being engaged. On 22 January, Dangiƒá ordered his own troops to permit the Germans to pass through Bosnia, saying \\"they are advancing peacefully and minding their own business without disturbing our unfortunate and long-suffering people.\\" He urged Chetniks and Serbs to annihilate the Usta≈°e, Croats and Communists. Within a few days, the Germans and Croats succeeded in pushing the Partisans out of eastern Bosnia and southward into the Italian-occupied zone of the NDH. The Chetnik actions in response to Operation Southeast Croatia severely weakened Partisan defences with the result that they suffered significant casualties and lost a great deal of territory. The result was the severing of any remaining cooperative links that remained between the Chetniks and Partisans in eastern Bosnia. In the same month Dangiƒá's staff declared that the Partisans \\"are led by the Kike Mo≈°a Pijade, the Turk Safet Mujiƒá, the Magyar Franjo Vajnert, and that so-and- so Petar Iliƒá whose real name nobody knows [emphasis in the original]\\" and announced the shared goal of the Partisans and Usta≈°e was \\"to break up and destroy Serbdom. That, and that alone! [emphasis in the original]\\". In February, Dangiƒá and other former Royal Yugoslav Army officers re-entered eastern Bosnia from the German-occupied territory of Serbia, where some of them had withdrawn to avoid Operation Southeast Croatia. They started to re- form Chetnik units in eastern Bosnia and began agitating against the Partisans on a \\"conservative, Serb-nationalist and anti-Muslim basis.\\" =Meeting in Belgrade= In order to enlist further Chetnik aid and to intensify the Chetnik‚ÄìPartisan split, Dangiƒá was invited to Belgrade in late January by Nediƒá and General der Artillerie (lieutenant general) Paul Bader. There, meetings were held from 30 January to 2 February 1942. Present were Bader, Professor Josef Matl, and Colonel Erich Kewisch for the Germans, Dangiƒá and Pero ƒêukanoviƒá for the Chetniks, and Nediƒá and Aƒáimoviƒá for the Serbian puppet government. Eventually, the involved parties reached an agreement. The terms of the agreement stipulated that: #Dangiƒá and his detachments bordered by the Drina, Sava and Bosna rivers in the east and the Italian‚ÄìGerman Demarcation Line to the south were to place themselves immediately under the command of Generalleutnant Johann Fortner, commander of the 718th Infantry Division and holder of executive power in the area. #Dangiƒá's Chetniks were to remain aligned with the Germans, even in the event of a general uprising. #The town of Zvornik was to be Dangiƒá's assigned seat of command. #Dangiƒá's Chetniks were to help pacify northern Bosnia by ensuring that each Serb, Croat and Muslim there was to live in peace. #Murder was to be punishable by death. #The presence of NDH authorities was to be maintained. #Dangiƒá was to spread news of the agreement, fight the Yugoslav Partisans, and protect German industrial and mining enterprises in eastern Bosnia according to Fortner's instructions. #Ammunition for Dangiƒá's Chetniks was to be provided by Bader. #All prisoners held by Dangiƒá's forces were to be released. The parties all agreed that seventeen districts in east Bosnia would have its military control shifted from NDH control to Chetnik control with the German military in Serbia attaining authority over it and having the ability to supply certain Chetnik forces no longer considered illegal by the Germans. The Germans demanded the area remain formally a part of the NDH though Bader implied \\"East Bosnia from the Serbian frontier to the River Bosna together with Sarajevo will be incorporated into occupied Serbia.\\" Dangiƒá accepted it as formally being a part of the NDH, but informed the Chetniks in east Bosnia that occupied Serbia would include \\"the following districts from the territory of Bosnia: Sarajevo, Vi≈°egrad, Rogatica, Srebrenica, Visoko, Vlasenica, Zvornik, Kladanj, Fojnica, Travnik, Brƒçko, Foƒça, Doboj, Bijeljina, Tuzla, Zenica, and ƒåajniƒçe.\\" ƒêukanoviƒá understood the agreement as meaning Serbian annexation of the districts. However, despite the concurrence of the parties, the agreement was not signed because negotiations had not been cleared in advance by General der Pioniere Walter Kuntze, the Wehrmacht Commander in Southeast Europe. Kuntze believed and informed Bader that \\"Major Dangiƒá is a Serb and will remain one. He has only made the offer in order to use East Bosnia as his troop training ground, to overcome the winter months, and to make preparations to gain East Bosnia for Serbia.\\" Thus, he vetoed the conclusion of the agreement on 12 February. The agreement was also opposed by representatives of the NDH and the German Foreign Ministry. Siegfried Kasche, German envoy in Zagreb, Joachim von Ribbentrop, German foreign minister, and General Edmund Glaise-Horstenau, opposed the agreement with Kasche arguing it would harm the NDH's position, expand the suffering of Muslims in east Bosnia who outnumbered the Serbs, and damage German‚ÄìMuslim world relations. This opposition led Bader to change his mind and not sign it. Despite this, Dangiƒá's Chetniks collaborated with German forces in eastern Bosnia over a period of several weeks and with the understanding that Dangiƒá and his forces would operate only inside Bosnia. Bader reported following the talks that \\"Dangiƒá on this occasion declared that he and his men would, even in the conditions of a general uprising in the Balkans and the arrival of the English, fight loyally and without wavering on the German side. He declared on this occasion his belief that only German victory could guarantee Serbia the position due to it in the Balkans, while the victory of Bolshevism would mean the destruction of every nation, thus also including the Serb nation.\\" The plan of a Greater Serbia protected by the Germans continued to be pursued by Nediƒá and Dangiƒá. The Usta≈°e authorities were concerned about negotiations between the German and Italian commanders and Dangiƒá, and were particularly worried that the Germans would permit the Italians and Chetniks to use Sarajevo as a base. In March, NDH gendarmerie in Tuzla reported \\"Nediƒá's Chetniks are distributing weapons and ammunition from the quota they receive from the Germans for the struggle against the Communists. They are constantly sent from Serbia into Bosnia and are claiming that they will conquer the latter.\\" On 31 March, Jure Francetiƒá, commander of the Black Legion, an Usta≈°e militia infantry unit consisting largely of Muslim and Croat refugees that fled from eastern Bosnia, launched a pre-emptive offensive primarily against Dangiƒá's Chetniks. Francetiƒá captured Vlasenica, Bratunac and Srebrenica, meeting limited resistance from the Partisans, and then scattered the more numerous Chetniks while inflicting significant losses and committing atrocities against segments of the Bosnian Serb population. Imprisonment, exile and death Dangiƒá at his trial In early April, Dangiƒá made the mistake of travelling to Serbia, where he met with one of Nediƒá's representatives, as well as with various Chetnik leaders. Dangiƒá made little effort to conceal his presence and even attended a public rally in Valjevo. Shortly thereafter, Kuntze ordered his arrest. The Abwehr soon learned that Dangiƒá had found accommodation in the village of Rogaƒçica, near Bajina Ba≈°ta. On the night of 11/12 April, the Abwehr ambushed Dangiƒá in his sleep and arrested him. He was immediately sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in Stryi, in the Lviv region of Galicia, which formed part of the German occupation area of the General Government. Stevan Botiƒá replaced him as the head of the Chetniks in eastern Bosnia. According to the historians Vladimir Dedijer and Antun Miletiƒá, Dangiƒá escaped captivity in 1943. ƒÜirkoviƒá writes that Dangiƒá remained in captivity until the outbreak of the ill-fated Warsaw Uprising in August 1944. Dangiƒá subsequently joined the Polish Home Army (), the leading anti-fascist resistance movement in German-occupied Poland. During the Warsaw Uprising, Dangiƒá fought against the Germans. He was captured in the fighting and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in Krak√≥w. Following the camp's liberation in January 1945, Dangiƒá surrendered to the Soviets. He was subsequently transferred to the Lubyanka Prison in Moscow, where alongside other members of the Polish Home Army, he was interrogated by the People's Commissariat for State Security. The Soviet Union eventually extradited him to Yugoslavia. He was charged with committing war crimes, engaging in counter-revolutionary activities, and collaborating with the Germans and Italians, as well as with the Serbian puppet government. Dangiƒá was subsequently tried before the Third Army Court in Sarajevo. He was found guilty on all counts and promptly sentenced to death. Dangiƒá was executed on 22 August 1947. Whether Dangiƒá was executed in Sarajevo, Banja Luka or Belgrade remains unclear. Dangiƒá's family did not flee Yugoslavia in the aftermath of the war. In 1954, his widow filed a claim requesting that she be made the recipient of his military pension. Her application was rejected on the basis of Dangiƒá's prior conviction. In 2011, the five Sisters of Divine Charity who were abused by Dangiƒá's Chetniks and subsequently died in their custody were beatified by Pope Benedict XVI and came to be known as the Blessed Martyrs of Drina.

Biography=Background Born on the Upper East Side, Manhattan, Armone earned his nickname \\"Piney\\" in the 1930s by extorting money from Christmas tree vendors. He was the younger brother of mobster Stephen Armone, an early member of the Mangano crime family, forerunner of the Gambino family. Armone married Josephine DiQuarto and was the father of two children. Josephine is a relative of Genovese crime family capo Dominick DiQuarto. He is an uncle to Gambino crime family capo Joseph (Joey The Blonde) Giordano. A devoted family man, Joseph Armone stayed away from mistresses and often took his wife out for dinner. Armone and his family lived in Brooklyn. Armone wore thick glasses and had an arthritic limp in his leg from an ancient gunshot wound. Armone rarely cursed; his speech, while not grammatical, had a high-flown formality once described as \\"Mob Shakespearean\\". He believed in omerta, the Cosa Nostra code of silence, was straightforward and direct, and highly trusted in mob circles. Armone was also respectful and polite to any Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents he encountered. Armone's arrest record included robbery, felonious assault, homicide, and narcotics violations. Early criminal career Armone followed his brother into the Mangano family. By the time Albert \\"Mad Hatter\\" Anastasia took over the Mangano family, he had become one of the family's major earners. In 1957, underboss Joseph Biondo allegedly picked Armone and two other family mobsters to kill Anastasia. However, before the attack could take place, Armone was arrested on a narcotics charge and sent to jail. Biondo allegedly replaced Armone with his brother Stephen and the hitmen killed Anastasia. However, other accounts suggest that Profaci crime family capo Joe Gallo and his crew members were responsible for the Anastasia murder. In 1964, Armone survived an assassination attempt. Armone was in a Manhattan bar when a gunman shot him five times at point blank range. On October 1, 1964, Armone and 11 other mobsters were indicted in what became the French Connection case. They were accused of transporting $20 million worth of heroin from 1956 to 1965 from France to the U.S. using sailors, businessmen and a diplomat as drug couriers. During the trial, one of the jurors was approached outside the courthouse by Patricia DeAlesandro, a former Playboy bunny and a friend of Armone. DeAlesandro tried to bribe the juror, but he reported the incident to law enforcement. DeAlesandro was later convicted of bribery and sentenced to five years in prison. On June 22, 1965, Armone was convicted of the French Connection charges. In July 1965, Armone was sentenced to 15 years in prison. After serving ten years in prison, Armone was released. When mobster Paul Castellano became family boss, he promoted Armone to caporegime. Mob author and journalist Jerry Capeci would cite Armone's success as an example of the American Mafia disregarding its official ban of dealing drugs. Gotti era In 1985. Armone was recruited by capo John Gotti into a conspiracy to kill Castellano.Raab, p. 373-375 Gotti already had the support of capo Frank DeCicco and soldiers Sammy Gravano and Robert DiBernardo, but lining up the support of Armone was a critical step in the conspiracy. As a respected old-timer in the Gambino family, Armone would offer more credibility to the new regime and placate Castellano's supporters. For his part, Armone had a dim view of Castellano as a gangster and saw Gotti's coup as a final chance to rise to a leadership role in the family.Capeci; Mustain 1996, p. 95 That chance came in April 1986, when Gotti's original underboss, Frank DeCicco, was blown up by a remote-controlled bomb. Gotti then appointed Armone as his new underboss and sent him to Florida to supervise Gambino activities there. On December 22, 1987, Armone was convicted in New York on charges of racketeering conspiracy involving extortion, bribery and illegal interstate travel to commit bribery. The bribery charge involved a plot from 1981 to 1982 to bribe a government official $20,000 to transfer the son of Gambino consigliere Joseph N. Gallo from a New York state prison to a federal prison. Gallo was also convicted in the trial. Under federal sentencing guidelines, any sentence imposed on Gallo and Armone would amount to a life sentence at their ages. With this in mind, the judge released Gallo on bail before sentencing, effectively giving him a final Christmas with his family. Armone was offered a similar temporary release, but only on the condition that he publicly admit his role in the family and renounce his ties to it.Raab, p. 405-406.Capeci; Mustain 1996, p. 135, 203-204 Gotti, however, had banned Gambino members from taking plea deals that acknowledged the existence of the family and refused Armone an exception. On February 22, 1988, Armone was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison and was fined $820,000. On September 24, 1988, in a separate case, Armone was convicted in Florida of extortion, loansharking, and racketeering in Broward County Death On February 23, 1992, Armone died in prison of natural causes. He was buried in the Cemetery of the Resurrection in Staten Island, New York.

It was believed that it would promote liberal capitalist models of development in other countries and that it would enhance national security. The United States is the largest contributor of military aid to foreign countries in the world, providing some form of assistance to over 150 countries each year. Military funding programs There are three main programs where military funding is allocated: #Foreign military financing provides grants for the acquisition of U.S. defense equipment, services, and training. These grants enable friends and allies to improve their defense capabilities. FMF is allowed under the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), which as amended [22 U.S.C. 2751, et. seq.], authorizes the President to finance procurement of defense articles and services for foreign countries and international organizations. The goals of FMF are: #:* Promoting national security by contributing to regional and global stability #:* Strengthening military support for democratically elected governments and containing transnational threats, including terrorism and trafficking in narcotics, weapons, and persons #:* Fostering closer military relationships between the U.S. and recipient nations #Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) provide voluntary support for international peacekeeping activities. These funds support non-U.N. operations and training in response to a nation‚Äôs crisis. The goals of PKO are: #:* Promoting increased involvement of regional organizations in conflict resolution #:* Helping leverage support for multinational efforts in the event of a nation's crisis #The International Military Education and Training program (IMET) offers military training on a grant basis to foreign military officials. The goals of IMET are: #:* Encouraging effective defense relationships #:* Promoting interoperability with U.S. and coalition forces #:* Exposing foreign civilian and military officials to democratic values, military professionalism, and international norms of human rights Some examples of this would include the United States' efforts in Colombia and South Korea. Military aid has been successful in stopping insurgency, providing stability, and ending conflicts within the region. In South Korea, US military aid has been beneficial for the maintenance of national security, economic and social development, and civilization as a whole. In many other cases, military aid has laid the groundwork for other forms of aid. This aid includes building schools to promote education, providing clean drinking water, and further stabilizing food production. Without military aid, this development would have been impossible. Some may say that military aid is increasing insurgency in the area, but examples of French and United Nations' efforts show that it has been stopping terrorist forces; especially in Africa. Criticisms Currently, Congress wants to cut defense spending by lowering the amount of aid given to foreign militaries. Money saved from proposed cutbacks could benefit the U.S. military, which is closing military bases, freezing pay raises for service members, and cut the defense budget by $78 billion in 2011. Particular targets of criticism include * Funds appropriated to the State Department and Defense Department represent the vast majority of unclassified military aid and assistance. The public does not have any way of tracking classified programs administered by the U.S. intelligence community. * Foreign aid often aids the giver, not the recipient. * Corruption is a major problem. Funds often go directly to leaders who may not share the aid with citizens. * The United States gives the same amount of money to its top five aid recipients as they give to the rest of the world.Noah Grant * Military aid went to Latin American dictatorships in the second half of the 20th century. *Generally, increasing levels of US military aid significantly reduces cooperative foreign policy behavior with the United States See also * Military budget of the United States * United States Foreign Military Financing * United States Agency for International Development * Foreign policy of the United States * Criticism of U.S. foreign policy * United States security assistance to the Palestinian Authority * United States military aid to Israel ReferencesExternal links * Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Request: International Affairs (PDF), U.S. Congress. * Congressional Budget Justification: Foreign Operations (PDF), Fiscal year 2008, U.S. Congress. * Foreign Aid Explorer U.S. Agency for International Development. * Where Does U.S. Military Aid Go?

Bonaccorso, S. Claramunt, A. Jaramillo, J. F. Pacheco, C. Ribas, M. B. Robbins, F. G. Stiles, D. F. Stotz, and K. J. Zimmer. Version 28 July 2020. A classification of the bird species of South America. American Ornithological Society. http://www.museum.lsu.edu/~Remsen/SACCBaseline.htm retrieved July 29, 2020 The list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families, and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) are also those of the SACC. The following tags have been used to highlight certain categories of occurrence. *(V) Vagrant ‚Äì a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Uruguay *(H) Hypothetical ‚Äì a species recorded but with \\"no tangible evidence\\" according to the SACC *(I) Introduced ‚Äì a species introduced to Uruguay as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Rheas Order: RheiformesFamily: Rheidae The rheas are large flightless birds native to South America. Their feet have three toes rather than four which allows them to run faster. One species has been recorded in Uruguay. *Greater rhea, Rhea americana Tinamous Order: TinamiformesFamily: Tinamidae The tinamous are one of the most ancient groups of bird. Although they look similar to other ground-dwelling birds like quail and grouse, they have no close relatives and are classified as a single family, Tinamidae, within their own order, the Tinamiformes. They are distantly related to the ratites (order Struthioniformes), that includes the rheas, emus, and kiwis. Three species have been recorded in Uruguay. *Brown tinamou, Crypturellus obsoletus *Red-winged tinamou, Rhynchotus rufescens *Spotted nothura, Nothura maculosa Screamers Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anhimidae The screamers are a small family of birds related to the ducks. They are large, bulky birds, with a small downy head, long legs, and large feet which are only partially webbed. They have large spurs on their wings which are used in fights over mates and in territorial disputes. Two species have been recorded in Uruguay. *Horned screamer, Anhima cornuta (V) *Southern screamer, Chauna torquata Ducks Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

They are forest birds which tend to feed on insects at or near the ground. A sizable minority of them specialize in following columns of army ants to eat small invertebrates that leave their hiding places to flee from the ants. Many species lack bright color; brown, black, and white are the dominant tones. Three species have been recorded in Uruguay. *Large-tailed antshrike, Mackenziaena leachii *Rufous- capped antshrike, Thamnophilus ruficapillus *Variable antshrike, Thamnophilus caerulescens Gnateaters Order: PasseriformesFamily: Conopophagidae The gnateaters are round, short-tailed, and long-legged birds which are closely related to the antbirds. One species has been recorded in Uruguay. *Rufous gnateater, Conopophaga lineata Ovenbirds Order: PasseriformesFamily: Furnariidae Ovenbirds comprise a large family of small sub-oscine passerine bird species found in Central and South America. They are a diverse group of insectivores which gets its name from the elaborate \\"oven-like\\" clay nests built by some species, although others build stick nests or nest in tunnels or clefts in rock. The woodcreepers are brownish birds which maintain an upright vertical posture, supported by their stiff tail vanes. They feed mainly on insects taken from tree trunks. Thirty-five species have been recorded in Uruguay. *Common miner, Geositta cunicularia *Olivaceous woodcreeper, Sittasomus griseicapillus *Planalto woodcreeper, Dendrocolaptes platyrostris *Scimitar-billed woodcreeper, Drymornis bridgesii *Narrow-billed woodcreeper, Lepidocolaptes angustirostris *Scalloped woodcreeper, Lepidocolaptes falcinellus *Rufous hornero, Furnarius rufus *Sharp-tailed streamcreeper, Lochmias nematura *Wren-like rushbird, Phleocryptes melanops *Curve-billed reedhaunter, Limnornis curvirostris *Scale-throated earthcreeper, Upucerthia dumetaria (H) *Buff-winged cinclodes, Cinclodes fuscus *Sharp-billed treehunter, Heliobletus contaminatus *Buff-browed foliage-gleaner, Syndactyla rufosuperciliata *Tufted tit-spinetail, Leptasthenura platensis *Little thornbird, Phacellodomus sibilatrix *Freckle-breasted thornbird, Phacellodomus striaticollis *Greater thornbird, Phacellodomus ruber *Orange-breasted thornbird, Phacellodomus ferrugineigula *Firewood-gatherer, Anumbius annumbi *Lark-like brushrunner, Coryphistera alaudina *Short-billed canastero, Asthenes baeri *Hudson's canastero, Asthenes hudsoni *Sharp-billed canastero, Asthenes pyrrholeuca *Straight-billed reedhaunter, Limnoctites rectirostris *Sulphur-bearded reedhaunter, Limnoctites sulphuriferus *Stripe-crowned spinetail, Cranioleuca pyrrhophia *Bay-capped wren-spinetail, Spartonoica maluroides *Brown cacholote, Pseudoseisura lophotes *Yellow-chinned spinetail, Certhiaxis cinnamomeus *Chotoy spinetail, Schoeniophylax phryganophila *Gray- bellied spinetail, Synallaxis cinerascens *Spix's spinetail, Synallaxis spixi *Pale-breasted spinetail, Synallaxis albescens *Sooty-fronted spinetail, Synallaxis frontalis Cotingas Order: PasseriformesFamily: Cotingidae The cotingas are birds of forests or forest edges in tropical South America.

Early life Pires was born and raised in New Bedford, Massachusetts. He attended school locally, where he became a three-year letter winner in both football and track. He also played in the football team as an offensive guard and linebacker and was selected for several postseason all-star teams. He later played football for Springfield College, where he became a two-year NCAA Division II All-ECAC and All-New England selection. In the track and field teams at New Bedford High and Springfield College, Pires mostly competed in the field events. He was a Southeastern Massachusetts Conference champion in both the shot put and discus in addition to being a Class A and All State finalist in the discus. His throw of 170‚Äì9 remains a New Bedford record. In 1979, he was the Division 2 National Champion in the 35-pound weight hammer throw. Based on these achievements, Pires (as a member of the class of 1976) was inducted into the New Bedford High School Hall of Fame on May 11, 2002. Coaching career Pires's first coaching role came as an assistant at Melrose High School. He then returned to his former high school at New Bedford, becoming an assistant to his former coach, Bruce MacPherson. Pires then gained collegiate positions at Syracuse University, Dartmouth College and Michigan State University. In 1996, he moved from College football to the National Football League (NFL) when he became an assistant linebackers coach with the Arizona Cardinals until 2000. He later praised the work he conducted with Ronald McKinnon, who was undrafted and unsigned, but Pires took pride in enabling the player to perform for ten years in the NFL. When he joined the Detroit Lions immediately afterwards, Pires remained in the same position he had undertaken for the Cardinals. When he moved to work with the Miami Dolphins for five years, initially as an assistant defensive line coach for two seasons, then as a defensive quality control coach, before becoming the assistant linebacker coach in 2007. He then moved to work with the Atlanta Falcons over the next seven years as the linebacker coach. In 2014, with the support of Pires, Paul Worrilow was ranked fifth in the NFL for tackles with 142. Pires joined the Chicago Bears in 2015, saying \\"The tradition of this team is always something that's been very appealing to any coach, especially me, the Midwest and the Chicago Bears, that's where it's at. The tradition of linebackers for the Chicago Bears, the tradition of what they've upheld in the history of the NFL, that's a great challenge I'm looking forward to [maintaining].\\" He was not retained by the Bears after the 2018 season as defensive coordinator Vic Fangio departed the team.

He uses code as an expressive form, and the Internet as his exhibition space and laboratory. Napier developed his first web-based applications for financial data in 1996. He is the author of his own website,potatoland.org, his online studio where many of his net artworks can be found, such as Shredder 1.0, net.flag, Riot, etc. Personal life Mark Napier was born in 1961 in Springfield, New Jersey. Napier lives and works in New York city. Currently, he is a consultant for a new personal finance company. Education Mark Napier graduated in 1984 with a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts from Syracuse University. Life and work Trained as a painter, Napier worked as a self-taught programmer in New York's financial markets until 1995, when a friend introduced him to the web. With Levi Asher, Napier collaborated on his first website (\\"Chicken Wire Mother\\") and began several experiments with hypertext in which he explored juxtaposing meanings and pop culture symbols. In The Distorted Barbie site, Napier created a family of Photoshopped Barbie also-rans that riffed on the \\"sacred cash-cow\\" status of the capitalist icon. Mattel was not amused and threatened Napier with a cease-and-desist letter, which prompted a wholesale copying of the site by enraged fans. In 1997, shortly after the Distorted Barbie episode, Napier opened potatoland.org, an online studio for interactive work where he explored software as an art medium with such pieces as Digital Landfill and Internet shredder 1.0 (1998). Both pieces were included in the seminal \\"net_condition\\" show at ZKM in Karlsruhe and attracted critical attention: Shredder was shown at Ars Electronica and Digital Landfill was written up in the Village Voice. Over the next five years Napier explored the networked software environment, creating work that challenged the definition of the art object. The salient features of these pieces: 1) The artwork can be altered by the viewer/visitor, 2) it responds to actions from the viewer/visitor and 3) typically relies on viewer/visitor actions to enact the work. The work can change, possibly unpredictably, over time, and often appropriates other network property to use as raw material, e.g., websites, flags, images. The art is \\"massively public\\": it is accessible to and can be altered by anybody with access to the network. These pieces exist in part as performances, in part as places that a viewer visits, in part as compositions, like music, that unfold differently when played under different circumstances. The overriding experience is that the art object is disembodied, existing in many places at once, with many authors contributing to the piece, with many appearances, over time, with no clear end point. The artwork is in the algorithm, the process, which manifests itself in an unending series of appearances on the screen. During this time Napier produced Riot, an alternative browser shown in the 2002 Whitney Biennial, Feed, commissioned by SFMOMA and shown in the \\"010101\\" show at SFMOMA (2001), and net.flag, commissioned by the Guggenheim Museum. In 2002 net.flag and John Simon's Unfolding Object became the first network-based artworks to be acquired by a major museum. These pieces turn the structure of the software/network environment inside out, hacking the inner workings of virtual space, and often collide physical metaphors with the insolidity of the net environment, i.e. shredding (Shredder), decaying (Digital Landfill), breaking down neighborhoods (Riot), creating a flag (net.flag). By hacking the http protocol he turns the web into an abstract expressionist painting or a meditative color field. Matt Mirapaul writing in the New York Times described Feed as \\"a digital action painting, albeit with actual action.\\" Napier has said, he is influenced by Jackson Pollock, he admires how he used the material, the way \\"he explored paint in its most raw form, without disguising it.\\" In Shredder he wanted to use the web as raw material, so the code, HTML, text, images, and colors, would become a visual aesthetic in their own right. Cy Twombly has also influenced him as well, for the \\"chaotic, accidental, seemingly unplanned quality of his work.\\" This repurposing of the matter of the web continues in Black and White (2003), a transitional piece in which Napier reads the text of the Old Testament, New Testament and Koran, as a stream of zeroes and ones, then treats the stream of binary data as two forces that drive a black and white line on the screen. The lines are propelled by the 0 and 1 values from the data, and are mutually attracted to one another, creating a swirling, orbiting dance as the black and white points seek equilibrium. The Black and White algorithm translates writing from a form that is meaningful to human beings into a form that is equally precise, but that can only be understood as a gestalt: a moment of insight that points to experiences that cannot be transcribed into text. In the period following 2003, Napier explored a more private side of software, making meditative pieces and drawing on the history of painting for inspiration. In three solo shows at bitforms gallery in Manhattan, Napier leaves the browser and moves towards a more tactile interactivity, showing work that is graphically rich and minimally interactive. Still addressing the expression of power in the global network, Napier turns to the Empire State Building as a symbol of nationalism, military and economic might. By transliterating the monument into software, Napier creates a contradiction: a soft, malleable, bouncing skyscraper. Flexible where the original is rigid, small where the original is huge, at once delicate and unbreakable, Napier's skyscraper collides the worlds of steel with the world of software, and reveals the anxiety of transitional time. These pieces, with names like KingKong, Cyclops Birth and Smoke, deal with the expression of power in the age of information. The seeming permanence of steel, the formative material of the Industrial Revolution, appears almost quaint as we navigate an environment that is increasingly made of electricity, magnetism and light. As they comment on the condition of human media in transition, these pieces also upset the conventions of visual art, long dominated by permanent unique objects. By creating virtual \\"objects\\" Napier's work exists in a space that is visible, yet forever just out of reach. These objects teeter on the edge of solidity and tempt the viewer to freeze them, hold them, to return them to the familiar and comfortably solid world. In 2013 Napier created an android app(Kaarme Scholarship Search) that allowed individuals to search for both college and scholarships. This app gives high- school students a LinkedIn like site where they can network with colleges, counselors and find the resources they need to get into college. This project was the company's first step into mobile apps, a critical technology for the high-school demographic.

A classification of the bird species of South America. American Ornithological Society. http://www.museum.lsu.edu/~Remsen/SACCBaseline.htm retrieved 29 July 2020 The avifauna of Chile has 506 confirmed species, of which 12 are endemic, 113 are rare or vagrants, five have been introduced by humans, and two are extinct or extirpated. An additional seven species are hypothetical (see below). Thirty- five of the species on the Chilean SACC list are globally threatened.http://datazone.birdlife.org/country/chile retrieved 11 March 2017 The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. * (V) Vagrant - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Chile * (E) Endemic - a species endemic to Chile * (I) Introduced - a species introduced to Chile as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions * (H) Hypothetical - a species recorded but with \\"no tangible evidence\\" according to the SACC Rheas Lesser rheas, different races occur in Patagonia and in the northern Andes. Order: RheiformesFamily: Rheidae The rheas are large flightless birds native to South America. Their feet have three toes rather than four which allows them to run faster. One species has been recorded in Chile. *Lesser rhea, Rhea pennata Tinamous Order: TinamiformesFamily: Tinamidae The tinamous are one of the most ancient groups of bird. Although they look similar to other ground-dwelling birds like quail and grouse, they have no close relatives and are classified as a single family, Tinamidae, within their own order, the Tinamiformes. They are distantly related to the ratites (order Struthioniformes), that includes the rheas, emus, and kiwis. Six species have been recorded in Chile. *Ornate tinamou, Nothoprocta ornata *Chilean tinamou, Nothoprocta perdicaria (E) *Andean tinamou, Nothoprocta pentlandii (Extirpated) *Elegant crested-tinamou, Eudromia elegans *Puna tinamou, Tinamotis pentlandii *Patagonian tinamou, Tinamotis ingoufi Ducks Black- necked swan, a large bird of coasts and wetlands. Upland goose, common in Patagonia Chiloe wigeon, breeds in southern and central Chile with some migrating north in winter. Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating. Twenty-eight species have been recorded in Chile. *Fulvous whistling- duck, Dendrocygna bicolor (V) *White-faced whistling-duck, Dendrocygna viduata (V) *Black-bellied whistling-duck, Dendrocygna autumnalis (V) *Black-necked swan, Cygnus melancoryphus *Coscoroba swan, Coscoroba coscoroba *Andean goose, Oressochen melanoptera *Upland goose, Chloephaga picta *Kelp goose, Chloephaga hybrida *Ashy-headed goose, Chloephaga poliocephala *Ruddy-headed goose, Chloephaga rubidiceps *Torrent duck, Merganetta armata *Flying steamer-duck, Tachyeres patachonicus *Flightless steamer-duck, Tachyeres pteneres *Crested duck, Lophonetta specularioides *Spectacled duck, Speculanas specularis *Puna teal, Spatula puna *Silver teal, Spatula versicolor *Red shoveler, Spatula platalea *Blue-winged teal, Spatula discors (V) *Cinnamon teal, Spatula cyanoptera *Chiloe wigeon, Mareca sibilatrix *White-cheeked pintail, Anas bahamensis *Yellow-billed pintail, Anas georgica *Yellow-billed teal, Anas flavirostris *Rosy-billed pochard, Netta peposaca *Black-headed duck, Heteronetta atricapilla *Ruddy duck, Oxyura jamaicensis (the local subspecies is also called Andean duck) *Lake duck, Oxyura vittata New World quails California quail, introduced in 1870. Order: GalliformesFamily: Odontophoridae The New World quails are small, plump terrestrial birds only distantly related to the quails of the Old World, but named for their similar appearance and habits.

It is a form of Monarchianism and as such stands in contrast with Trinitarianism. Modalistic Monarchianism considers God to be one while working through the different \\"modes\\" or \\"manifestations\\" of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Following this view, all the Godhead is understood to have dwelt in Jesus Christ from the incarnation. The terms Father and Son are then used to describe the distinction between the transcendence of God and the incarnation (God in immanence). Lastly, since God is a spirit, it is held that the Holy Spirit should not be understood as a separate entity but rather to describe God in action. Modalistic Monarchians believe in the deity of Jesus and understand Jesus to be a manifestation of Yahweh, the God of the Old Testament, in the flesh. For this reason they find it suitable to ascribe all worship appropriate to God alone to Jesus also. Modalistic Monarchianism is closely related to Sabellianism and patripassianism. History Theologian and church historian Adolf von Harnack first used the term modalism to describe a doctrine believed in the late 2nd century and 3rd century. During this time period, Christian theologians were attempting to clarify the relationship between God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Concerned with defending the absolute unity of God, modalists such as Noetus, Praxeas and Sabellius explained the divinity of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit as the one God revealing himself in different ways or modes: #God revealed as the creator and lawgiver is called \\"the Father\\". #God revealed as the savior in Jesus Christ is called \\"the Son\\". #God revealed as the one who sanctifies and grants eternal life is called \\"the Spirit\\". By the 4th century, a consensus had developed in favor of the doctrine of the Trinity, and modalism was generally considered a heresy. Modern adherents Modalistic Monarchianism is accepted within Oneness Pentecostalism. Oneness Pentecostals believe in the deity of Jesus and understand Jesus, the Son of God, to be a manifestation of the God of the Old Testament, Yahweh, in the flesh. When Jesus was on Earth, he referred to God as his Father since God caused his conception through the Holy Spirit. They also believe that, since God is spirit, the Holy Spirit is used to describe God in action. In this way, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are considered titles pertaining to the one God, not descriptions of distinct individuals. Because Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are maintained to be titles, Oneness Pentecostals believe that they fulfill the commandment of Jesus in Matthew 28:19 to baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit by baptizing solely in the name of Jesus Christ. Because Jesus is the name given for salvation (Acts 4:12), they would argue that this led the Apostles in the book of Acts fulfilling the commandment of Jesus by baptizing in the one name of the one God, Jesus. Much of their theology attempts to begin with an Old Testament understanding of God in order to understand what the first Apostles would have believed about Jesus. They also seek to avoid use of theological categories produced by Platonic-Aristotelian epistemologies, preferring rather to tell the story of redemption through narrative. Thus, the distinction found in the New Testament writers between God the Father and Jesus is understood to be from the attempts to identify God the Father and Jesus together, rather than to separate them more than necessary. The theology of the World Mission Society Church of God and its youth representing group ASEZ is another example of modalism. They believe that, \\"'God' coherently refers to God the Father throughout the Bible. Apostle Paul, the writer of Philippians and Romans, testified that God the Son Jesus is in very nature God, indicating that He is God the Father Jehovah, who was born in the flesh.\\"https://wmscog.com/beliefs/holy-trinity/ They believe that, later on, the Holy Spirit came on the human form to be revealed as Ahnsahnghong, who they believe is God the son of Jesus Christ: \\"In accordance with the Bible, God the Holy Spirit must also have a name. The name of the Holy Spirit is Ahnsahnghong. Ahnsahnghong is the Holy Spirit because He fulfilled the prophecy of the one to come and remind us of the truth Jesus taught. So God the Holy Spirit Ahnsahnghong is God the Son Jesus Christ.\\"https://wmscog.com/beliefs/holy-trinity/ See also * Names of God in Christianity * Nontrinitarianism References=CitationsSources  Category:Christology Category:Nontrinitarianism Category:Oneness Pentecostalism Category:Heresy in ancient Christianity ","title":"Modalistic Monarchianism"},{"id":"10910772","text":"Patents granted to Chinese and foreign inventors between 2002 and 2013.

Apart from the town itself, it also comprises 7 subordinated municipalities.  History  While the area of the municipality was probably inhabited in pre-Roman times, the first written mention of the settlement by the name of Encinesdorf dates to 1160. At its current location, an estate was founded in about 870. The terrain comprising this estate (the island Sahsonaganc, which roughly coincides with today's municipality) was donated to the Weihenstephan Abbey by Henry II in 1021, only to be transferred to the Diocese of Freising in 1028. While the general area was also under the influence of the Diocese of Passau, a document of 1202 formally associates the church in Gro√ü-Enzersdorf to the Diocese of Freising. By 1298, all of Sahsonaganc belonged to the Diocese of Freising and the administrative center was located in what was then called Entzeinestorf. In 1396, the settlement received formal town privileges, and the construction of the massive city wall started, which was finished in 1399 and today still stands almost intact. Despite these fortifications, the town was conquered several times and suffered serious damages in the subsequent centuries. In 1483, Matthias Corvinus sacked and damaged the town, and in 1529 the town was conquered and heavily damaged by troops of the Ottoman Empire during the Siege of Vienna. In the aftermath, many Croats rebuilt destroyed houses and eventually settled in the town. In 1554, a fire destroyed all but a few houses in the town. During the Thirty Years' War in the first half of the seventeenth century the town was occupied and again set on fire by troops of the Swedish Empire. This was followed by an outbreak of the Plague in 1679 and another occupation and partial destruction by the Ottoman Empire during the Second Siege of Vienna before the Battle of Vienna in 1683. In 1693, Georg Rafael Donner, a baroque sculptor who was born in the neighboring village E√üling, was baptized in Gro√ü- Enzersdorf, marking the beginning of a relatively calm period, interrupted only by another major fire in 1730. In 1803, the belongings of the Diocese of Freising were secularized and thus Gro√ü-Enzersdorf was formally transferred to the House of Habsburg. The town became involved in acts of war again in 1809, during the Battle of Aspern-Essling and the Battle of Wagram, suffering major damages. The last major fire occurred in 1829, and in 1850 Gro√ü-Enzersdorf became a district capital, which was moved to Floridsdorf in 1893. In the second half of the 19th century a Jewish community was founded and eventually also a synagogue was built. From 1886 on the town was the terminus of a steam tramway connecting the town to the Viennese tram network, which was later electrified and ended service in 1970. The Anschluss of Austria to Nazi Germany in 1938 also brought a major change on the local level for Gro√ü- Enzersdorf: It was absorbed into the new Greater-Vienna and gave its name to the new 22nd district Gro√ü-Enzersdorf, which comprised many of the rural Marchfeld villages, but also some more urban zones on the left of the Danube that were already previously part of Vienna, such as Kaiserm√ºhlen. The synagogue was heavily damaged in the infamous Kristallnacht in November 1938, and most of the Jewish population was deported during this event. The synagogue building was used as a magazine during World War II and was demolished in 1963. During the World War, the town suffered aerial bombings during the Oil Campaign of World War II in 1944, because of its vicinity to an oil refinery in the Lobau. Gro√ü-Enzersdorf was conquered by Soviet Armed Forces on April 12, 1945. In Allied-occupied Austria the town was located in the Soviet zone, and administratively remained in the 22nd district of Vienna until 1954, when it was re-established as a municipality within the state of Lower Austria. The more recent history of Gro√ü-Enzersdorf marks a shift from a service town characterized by its agricultural surroundings towards a suburban center, with many inhabitants commuting to Vienna.  Geography  Gro√ü- Enzersdorf and the dependent villages (counterclockwise): Oberhausen, M√ºhlleiten, Wittau, Probstdorf, Franzensdorf The city is 18 km east from the city center of Vienna.

History The Little Falls Mill and Land Company was formed in 1849 to build a dam and a sawmill to supply lumber for buildings at Fort Ripley; but when settlers showed up in the area there were other markets for the lumber. James Green, along with a group of co-partners, was the owner of the first dam, a wing dam built on the east channel of the falls. Green died in 1850 and the dam, mill and land were sold. William Sturgis bought the dam and, with Calvin Tuttle and James Fergus, formed the Little Falls Company, later called Little Falls Manufacturing Company. The company built a larger dam, sawmill, cabinet shop and bridge and owned about of land. The new dam replaced the original wing dam, but was built on sand and portions of it were washed out by flood waters in the summer of 1859. The dam was repaired, but washed out again the following summer. The Little Falls Manufacturing Company faltered due to a number of factors, including \\"the ill effects of the economic depression that swept the frontier and ultimately the nation in the late 1850s.\\" William Sturgis and James Fergus left their Little Falls business interests in the hands of their wives while they went west in search of gold. The story of this chapter in Little Falls history is told through letters written between James and his wife Pamelia in the book \\"The Gold Rush Widows of Little Falls\\" by Linda Peavy and Ursula Smith. In 1887, a group of investors from Louisville, Kentucky formed the Little Falls Water Power Company. A new dam was completed in 1888 as a means to redevelop Little Falls, and this created jobs and attracted immigrants to the town. \\"Prior to the construction of the third dam, the 1880 census showed a population of 508 people in Little Falls. By 1890, the population more than quadrupled, reaching 2,354 people. By 1895, it had grown again, more than doubling to a total of 5,116. The dam, and the industries it attracted, was a major factor in that growth.\\" Construction of the fourth Little Falls dam, this one made of concrete, started with the east wing in 1914. Construction on the west wing was underway by 1918. The dam, including a new power house, was completed by 1921. The larger additional power house was built to house two additional generators, with a third generator being added during the 1980s. Further improvements were made from 2005 to 2010. The new dam raised the water level an additional four and half feet. This submerged the water power mill at the mouth of the Little Elk River, about one mile upstream. Excavations below the power house increased the total water head to twenty-four feet. The original natural falls had a drop of only about five feet. The impounded water now reaches to the Belle Prairie Rapids, west of the Belle Prairie Church, about 3.5 miles upstream. Along with the Blanchard Dam ten miles downstream, Little Falls Dam was purchased by Minnesota Power during the 1920s. In 1978, automation for Blanchard, along with the Sylvan and Pillager dams on the Crow Wing River, were centralized in Little Falls; this allowed a staff of four to do work that had previously required sixteen operators. The operation has since been remotely controlled by Minnesota Power's central dispatchers in Riverton, and the dam is now staffed only by maintenance personnel. Because generating electricity by water power has little overhead and no fuel costs, this relatively small 4.5 megawatt dam remains economically profitable.

Storks are mute, but bill-clattering is an important mode of communication at the nest. Their nests can be large and may be reused for many years. Many species are migratory. *Maguari stork, Ciconia maguari *Jabiru, Jabiru mycteria *Wood stork, Mycteria americana Frigatebirds Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black-and-white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have colored inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to- body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. *Magnificent frigatebird, Fregata magnificens Boobies Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. *Cape gannet, Morus capensis (H) *Peruvian booby, Sula variegata (H) *Brown booby, Sula leucogaster (V) Anhingas Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Anhingas are often called \\"snake-birds\\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. *Anhinga, Anhinga anhinga Cormorants Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage coloration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white, and a few being colorful. *Red-legged cormorant, Phalacrocorax gaimardi *Neotropic cormorant, Phalacrocorax brasilianus *Magellanic cormorant, Phalacrocorax magellanicus *Guanay cormorant, Phalacrocorax bougainvillii *Imperial cormorant, Phalacrocorax atriceps Pelicans Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae Pelicans are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. As with other members of the order Pelecaniformes, they have webbed feet with four toes. *Peruvian pelican, Pelecanus thagus (V) Herons Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills. *Rufescent tiger-heron, Tigrisoma lineatum *Fasciated tiger-heron, Tigrisoma fasciatum *Boat-billed heron, Cochlearius cochlearius *Pinnated bittern, Botaurus pinnatus *Least bittern, Ixobrychus exilis *Stripe-backed bittern, Ixobrychus involucris *Black-crowned night-heron, Nycticorax nycticorax *Yellow-crowned night-heron, Nyctanassa violacea (V) *Green heron, Butorides virescens (H) *Striated heron, Butorides striata *Cattle egret, Bubulcus ibis *Cocoi heron, Ardea cocoi *Great egret, Ardea alba *Whistling heron, Syrigma sibilatrix *Capped heron, Pilherodius pileatus (V) *Snowy egret, Egretta thula *Little blue heron, Egretta caerulea Ibises Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Threskiornithidae Threskiornithidae is a family of large terrestrial and wading birds which includes the ibises and spoonbills.

Found in tropical woodlands worldwide, they feed on insects and fruit, and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly any distance. Trogons have soft, often colorful, feathers with distinctive male and female plumage. *Blue-crowned trogon, Trogon curucui *Surucua trogon, Trogon surrucura *Black-throated trogon, Trogon rufus Motmots Order: CoraciiformesFamily: Momotidae The motmots have colorful plumage and long, graduated tails which they display by waggling back and forth. In most of the species, the barbs near the ends of the two longest (central) tail feathers are weak and fall off, leaving a length of bare shaft and creating a racket- shaped tail. *Rufous-capped motmot, Baryphthengus ruficapillus *Amazonian motmot, Momotus momota Kingfishers Order: CoraciiformesFamily: Alcedinidae Kingfishers are medium-sized birds with large heads, long, pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails. *Ringed kingfisher, Megaceryle torquatus *Amazon kingfisher, Chloroceryle amazona *American pygmy kingfisher, Chloroceryle aenea *Green kingfisher, Chloroceryle americana *Green-and-rufous kingfisher, Chloroceryle inda (H) Jacamars Order: GalbuliformesFamily: Galbulidae The jacamars are near passerine birds from tropical South America, with a range that extends up to Mexico. They feed on insects caught on the wing, and are glossy, elegant birds with long bills and tails. In appearance and behavior they resemble the Old World bee-eaters, although they are more closely related to puffbirds. *Rufous-tailed jacamar, Galbula ruficauda (H) Puffbirds Order: GalbuliformesFamily: Bucconidae The puffbirds are related to the jacamars and have the same range, but lack the iridescent colors of that family. They are mainly brown, rufous or gray, with large heads and flattened bills with hooked tips. The loose abundant plumage and short tails makes them look stout and puffy, giving rise to the English common name of the family. *Buff-bellied puffbird, Notharchus swainsoni *White-eared puffbird, Nystalus chacuru *Spot-backed puffbird, Nystalus maculatus *Rusty-breasted nunlet, Nonnula rubecula Toucans Order: PiciformesFamily: Ramphastidae Toucans are near passerine birds from the Neotropics.

This is in contrast to the vast majority of kabuki actors, who specialize in only playing women, heroes, villains, or other particular types of roles. Kikugor≈ç was close friends with the playwright Tsuruya Nanboku IV, who wrote the role of Oiwa, in the play T≈çkaid≈ç Yotsuya Kaidan, specifically for him. Names and Lineage Like most kabuki actors, Kikugor≈ç went by a number of different stage names over the course of his career. He debuted as Onoe Eizabur≈ç I, and spent time as ≈ågawa Hashiz≈ç I, Onoe Baik≈ç III, and Onoe Matsusuke II, before taking the name Onoe Kikugor≈ç in 1815. He also used the poetry names (haimy≈ç) Baiju, Gach≈ç, Sanch≈ç, and Baik≈ç. Kikugor≈ç was adopted into the kabuki world by Onoe Sh≈çroku I. He had three sons, Onoe Matsusuke III, Onoe Eizabur≈ç IV, and Onoe Kikunosuke, and a grandson, Onoe Kikugor≈ç V. Onoe Kikugor≈ç IV and Ichimura Uzaemon XII were his sons-in-law. Career Kikugor≈ç made his debut on stage at the age of four in 1789, as Onoe Eizabur≈ç I. By 1810, he had already become acquainted with Tsuruya Nanboku IV, and had seen his first son's stage debut. Over the course of his career, he would develop a strong relationship with the playwright, performing in many of his productions, often alongside his own sons. Taking part in a number of sh≈´mei naming ceremonies alongside his sons, the actor went through several different names, often passing them on to his sons, and finally taking the name Kikugor≈ç III in 1815. Kikugor≈ç played the lead role of Oiwa, wife of Iemon, in the 1825 premiere of the now-famous ghost play T≈çkaid≈ç Yotsuya Kaidan; the role was written specifically for him by his playwright friend. Among his many roles over his career were those of ≈åboshi Yuranosuke, K≈ç no Moronao and Tonase in Kanadeon Ch≈´shingura, Sugawara no Michizane in Sugawara Denju Tenarai Kagami, and Shizuka Gozen and Itami Gonta in Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura. His rivalry with fellow actor Ichikawa Danj≈´r≈ç VII added to the excitement and appeal of their many performances together. He entered retirement in September 1847, after a final performance at the Ichimura-za, in a program called \\"Onoe Baiju Ichidai Banashi\\" after him. In his retirement, he took on the name Kikuya Manbei, and ran a mochi shop called the Kiku-ya. Kikugor≈ç returned to the stage, however, the following year, performing under the stage name ≈ågawa Hashiz≈ç I, in Edo and on a short tour in Nagoya. Settling in Osaka towards the end of 1848, he fell ill the following year and died at the Kakegawa station on the T≈çkaid≈ç post road.

It is typically associated with the onset of visual deterioration (optic atrophy) in early childhood followed by the development of movement problems and motor disability in later childhood, occasionally along with mild cases of cognitive deficiency. The disorder is named after Hanan Costeff, the doctor who first described the syndrome in 1989.  Signs and symptoms  The characteristic symptom of Costeff syndrome is the onset of progressively worsening eyesight caused by degeneration of the optic nerve (optic atrophy) within the first few years of childhood, with the majority of affected individuals also developing motor disabilities later in childhood. Occasionally, people with Costeff syndrome may also experience mild cognitive disability. It is type of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, the hallmark of which is an increased level in the urinary concentrations of 3-methylglutaconic acid and 3-methylglutaric acid; this can allow diagnosis as early as at one year of age. Those with Costeff syndrome typically experience the first symptoms of visual deterioration within the first few years of childhood, which manifests as the onset of progressively decreasing visual acuity. This decrease tends to continue with age, even after childhood. The majority of people with Costeff syndrome develop movement problems and motor disabilities later in childhood, the two most significant of which are choreoathetosis and spasticity. The former causes involuntary erratic, jerky, and twisting movements (see chorea and athetosis), whereas the latter causes twitches and spastic tendencies. These two symptoms are often severe enough to seriously disable an individual; among 36 people with Costeff syndrome, 17 experienced major motor disability as a result of choreoathetosis, and 12 experienced spasticity-related symptoms severe enough to do the same. Ataxia (loss of muscle coordination) and speech impairment caused by dysarthria also occur in roughly 50% of cases, but are rarely seriously disabling. Some individuals with Costeff disease also display mild cognitive impairment, though such cases are relatively infrequent.  Genetics  Costeff syndrome is a neuro-ophthalmological genetic disorder; specifically, it is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the OPA3 gene, which carries instructions for synthesis of its gene product, the OPA3 protein. The exact function of the product protein is unknown, though it is known to play an integral role in mitochondrial function. The disorder can be caused by several different mutations in the OPA3 gene. However, nearly all reported cases of Costeff syndrome has been in individuals of Iraqi Jewish origin, all of whom share the same splice site founder mutation. In particular, this founder mutation is a G-to-C mutation of a single nucleotide (see single-nucleotide polymorphism) which interferes with gene expression levels of OPA3. Though the mutation is the same within this population, the severity of symptoms varies with the individual. To date, there have only been two reported cases of Costeff syndrome not due to the founder mutation, each of which was due to a different pathogenic variants (mutation). Two other OPA3 mutations have also been reported which result in a rare dominant genetic disorder with symptoms similar to Costeff syndrome. Diagnosis Costeff syndrome can be diagnosed by the presence of increased levels of 3-methylglutaconic acid in the urine, or 3-methylglutaconic aciduria.  Treatment  There is currently no cure for Costeff syndrome. Treatment is supportive, and thus focuses on management of the symptoms. The resulting visual impairment, spasticity, and movement disorders are treated in the same way as similar cases occurring in the general population.  Prognosis  The long-term prognosis of Costeff syndrome is unknown, though it appears to have no effect on life expectancy at least up to the fourth decade of life. However, as mentioned previously, movement problems can often be severe enough to confine individuals to a wheelchair at an early age, and both visual acuity and spasticity tend to worsen over time.  Epidemiology  First described in 1989, Costeff syndrome has been reported almost exclusively in individuals of Iraqi Jewish origin with only two exceptions, one of whom was a Turkish Kurdish, with the other being of Indian descent. Within the Iraqi Jewish population, the carrier frequency of the founder mutation is about 1/10, with the prevalence of Costeff syndrome itself estimated at anywhere between 1 in 400 and 1 in 10,000.

This genus is often reconstructed to resemble snails. Yochelcionella is the type genus of the family Yochelcionellidae.  Description  flow of water in Yochelcionella - note that the flow was originally interpreted to be in the opposite direction to that illustrated; no source is provided for the reconstruction given here. This genus of molluscs possessed shells which were shaped like curved caps, with an exhaust pipe shaped \\"snorkel\\" emanating underneath where the apex (point of the shell) curves over. It is believed that the \\"snorkel\\" was used in breathing, allowing waste water to flow away from the gills.  Taxonomy  When they were first discovered, they were originally thought to be monoplacophorans. Their snorkel may represent a move towards a tubular shell, such as is seen in the modern scaphopods. It has also been interpreted as a precursor to the cephalopod funnel or siphuncle. The taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005Bouchet P. & Rocroi J.-P.

The name is a pun - from tup - Bulgarian for \\"dumb\\", and -est, the superlative suffix in English as in \\"the best\\". The main purpose of the release was to finally offer most of the early hits by the band on a CD as Hipodil's first three albums were released on audio cassettes only. Despite the CD release however most of the tracks were hardly remastered and still sound pretty similar to the original versions. It was also Hipodil's first appearance on CD. As there are no singles in the classic meaning of the term and no verifiable sales or airplay charts in Bulgaria and Bulgarian record companies do not report sales figures it is also impossible to assess the commercial success of the songs in this compilation. Most of the songs however were Hipodil live favourites and undoubtedly enjoyed immense popularity among the public.  The Music  Tu'pest contains 23 tracks from the four previous Hipodil albums with band's 1993 debut Alkoholen delirium being represented by six songs (see Tracks below). Hipodil's second album Nekuf ujas, nekuf at of 1993 and S gol v rukata... from 1996 - produced five tracks each and, remarkably, the band's most successful album, the 1998 Nadurveni vuglishta - also five songs.

The avifauna of Andorra include a total of 161 species, of which 1 have been introduced by humans and 9 are rare or accidental. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Andorra. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. Not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Andorra * (I) Introduced - a species introduced to Andorra as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land.

Huyen langlon consists of two main components: thang-ta (armed combat) and sarit sarak (unarmed fighting). The primary weapons of huyen langlon are the thang (sword) and ta (spear). The spear can be used in its non-missile form while in close or thrown from afar. Other weapons include the shield and the axe. Unarmed combat incorporates hand strikes, kicks, and grappling (mukna). Because of Manipur's cultural similarity and geographical proximity with Myanmar, huyen langlon is closely related to Burmese bando and banshay. The thang-ta aspect of huyen langlon can be practiced in three ways: ritual, demonstration, and combat. The first way is related to tantric practices and is entirely ritualistic in nature. The second way consists of a spectacular performance involving sword and spear dances. These routines can be converted into actual fighting practices. The third way is the true combat application. Thang-ta shares a connection with certain war-dances, often blurring the line between dance and combat forms, such as thangkairol (sword dance) and khosarol (spear dance). Many ritualistic dances in Manipur were traditionally performed by martial artists such as the spear dance for funerals or the sacred thengou dance. The sword movements in dance are meant to either symbolize protection or to ward off evil spirits. History All that can be gleaned of huyen langlon's ancient history comes from hymns and legends. Folklore links the creation of huyen langlon and its related dances with the native animist gods. Manipur was a valley protected from neighbouring Hindu, Burmese and Chinese kingdoms by hills. The tribal people of the hills were divided into seven related clans, known as yek, salai, or pana. These were the Mangang, Luwang, Khuman, Angom, Moirang, Khaba-Nganba and Sarang LeishangthemMeitei people. Before their integration into a single unified Meitei community, these clans each ruled separate principalities over which they fought amongst each other. The earliest written record of huyen langlon come from the Puya or written records handed down to posterity by the forefathers of the MeiteisHistory of Manipur, which record the history of the Manipur royalty in archaic Meitei script. The Chainarol-Puya details the ethics of duelling. The fights took place under strict rules of conduct and to violate them was shameful and sinful. When a fighter is challenged, the day for the bout is fixed to allow for time to prepare the weapons. Allowing the opponent the first chance to fire an arrow or hurl a spear was considered particularly courageous. The duel itself was not necessarily to the death and usually ended once first blood has been drawn. However, the victor was expected to behead the loser. Either before the duel or before the beheading, the fighters would share the meals and wine prepared by their wives. If it had been so requested beforehand, the loser's body may be cremated. Heads were taken as trophies, as was custom among the headhunters of northeast India. Taboos existed such as not killing an opponent who runs, begs or cries out of fear, or anyone who pleads for protection. Until this point, most of the fighters were commoners who also served as warriors. Loiyamba Shinyen (1074-1122 AD) introduced an armed force or lallup, while King Punshiba (1404-1432 AD) created a permanent military department known as Shingchep Meira Haijouroi, paving the way for the conqueror kings of the 15th century. The warrior queen Linthoingambi successfully defeated raiding Tangkhul tribesmen while the king was absent. Her husband Meidingu Ningthou Khomba took advantage of his highly trained warriors and expanded the kingdom's territory. Their son Meidingu Senbi Kiyamba, an expert with the spear, eventually went on to conquer the Shan kingdom of Kyang. Meidingu Pamheiba (1709-1748 AD) is regarded as one of Manipur's greatest kings. He upgraded the lallup system, making it the duty of every male above 16 to serve the state for 10 in 40 days. Therefore each person served the state some 90 days in a year, with martial arts as part of their training. Thus Manipur had no true standing army and relied on its individual warriors for protection. Pamheiba's development of the military paid off. His warriors fought Tripura and the Burmese kingdom of Awa, expanding Meitei rule as far as Cachar. Conflict with the Burmese continued through the 18th and 19th centuries, culminating in the Chahi-Taret Khuntakpa or Seven Years Devastation. As muskets were not widely available, swords and spears remained the primary weapons of both the Burmese and Meitei armies. From 1891 to 1947 British colonists prohibited martial arts, the possession of weapons, duels to the death, and other violent customs among India's indigenous populations. The ban was somewhat difficult to enforce due to the region's isolation. The neighbouring Naga people in particular have practiced headhunting in living memory. Nevertheless, modernization and adoption of Christianity killed off much of the native culture, particularly after the second World War. The meditative practices of huyen langlon were nearly lost before India achieved independence. Today it is the most popular of Meitei martial arts, Manipur Page practiced by men and women. It is most often seen through demonstrations in cultural programs. In recent years huyen langlon has been promoted as a sport all over India and as a self-defence tactical subject. Competitions are held yearly at school, district, state and national level. The promotion of huyen langlon as a sport helped in the cause of its promotion and spread from Manipur to the whole of India, particularly Jammu and Kashmir. Manipur and Jammu & Kashmir are the strongest contenders at the national level. In 2009 Gurumayum Gourakishor Sharma, a leading exponent and teacher of huyen langlon, received the high Padma Shri award from the Indian Government for his contributions to the preservation and advancement of the art. The biggest training school is the Huyen Langlon Thang-Ta Academy which holds demonstrations at cultural shows. Training As in all Indian martial arts, training begins with stepping patterns and then basic sword strikes. The main sword stance is the lion posture, in which the body leans forward with one leg stretched back and the other bent forward. The feet are about shoulder-width apart and form a 45 degree angle. This stance emphasises phidup or a coil, enabling a springing action. At higher levels, exponents slice pieces of watermelons on a person's body without causing any injury. This is eventually done blindfolded. Spear technique is considered more difficult and is taught after the sword. The spear emphasizes phanba, an opening out of the body with two forms: nongphan to simulate the expanse of the sky and leiphal emulating the expanse of the ground. Generally speaking, the spear demands more of the lower body while the sword uses more of the upper body. Bare-handed techniques (sarit sarak or sharit sharak) are only taught when a student has gained competence in armed fighting. The physical side of thang-ta is eventually supplemented with breathing exercises (ningsha kanglon), traditional medicine (layeng kanglon), meditation (hirikonba), and the sacred dances (thengouron). Sparring matches are conducted in a 30-foot circular arena. There are two methods of sparring: phunaba ama and phunaba anishuba. In phunaba ama, competitors wield a two-foot leather-encased cheibi (cudgel) paired with a leather chungoi (shield) measuring one feet in diameter. One match consists of two three-minute rounds with one minute of rest in between. One central referee, six scorers, one time keeper and either one or two chief judges are assigned for one match. The other form of sparring, phunaba anishuba, is identical with the exception that kicks are allowed and there are no shields. These forms of sparring in which cudgels or cheibi simulate swords are referred to as cheibi gatka.

The law places certain crimes under federal jurisdiction if they are committed by a Native American in Native territory. The law follows the 1817 General Crimes Act, which extended federal jurisdiction to crimes committed in Native territory but did not cover crimes committed by Native Americans against Native Americans. The Major Crimes Act therefore broadened federal jurisdiction in Native territory by extending it to some crimes committed by Native Americans against Native Americans. The Major Crimes Act was passed by Congress in response to the Supreme Court of the United States's ruling in Ex parte Crow Dog (109 U.S. 556 (1883)) that overturned the federal court conviction of Brule Lakota sub-chief Crow Dog for the murder of principal chief Spotted Tail on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. The original law placed seven major crimes under federal jurisdiction (exclusive of state jurisdiction) if they were committed by a Native American in Native territory. Those crimes were: * Murder * Manslaughter * Rape * Assault with intent to kill * Arson * Burglary * Larceny The text of the act is as follows: This list of crimes has since been updated to the following (as of Pub. L. 114-38): *Murder *Manslaughter *Kidnapping *Maiming *A felony under chapter 109A (i.e. sexual abuse) *Incest *A felony assault under section 113 (e.g. assault with intent to commit murder or assault with a dangerous weapon) *An assault against an individual who has not attained the age of 16 years *Felony child abuse or neglect, *Arson *Burglary *Robbery, and *A felony under section 661 of this title (i. e. larceny) The constitutionality of the Major Crimes Act was upheld in United States v. Kagama (118 U.S. 375 (1886)), a case in which two Indians were prosecuted for killing another Indian on a reservation. While the Court agreed that the prosecution of major crimes did not fall within Congress's power to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes, it ruled that the trust relationship between the federal government and the tribes conferred on Congress both the duty and the power to regulate tribal affairs. After the Major Crimes Act was passed, many tribes continued to prosecute Native Americans for major crimes, thus exercising jurisdiction concurrent with the federal courts. This practice was upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in the 1995 case Wetsit v. Stafne. The Major Crimes Act was the focal point of the Supreme Court case McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U.S. ___ (2020), which found that nearly half of the state of Oklahoma had not been disestablished as a Native American reservation by Congress prior to Oklahoma‚Äôs statehood and thus remained Indian country, such that crimes committed by enrolled tribal members cannot be tried in state court.

In Oracle, the table has a single VARCHAR2(1) column called DUMMY that has a value of 'X'. It is suitable for use in selecting a pseudo column such as SYSDATE or USER. Example use Oracle's SQL syntax requires the FROM clause but some queries don't require any tables - DUAL can be used in these cases. SELECT 1+1 FROM dual; SELECT 1 FROM dual; SELECT USER FROM dual; SELECT SYSDATE FROM dual; SELECT * FROM dual;  History  Charles Weiss explains why he created DUAL: > I created the DUAL table as an underlying object in the Oracle Data > Dictionary. It was never meant to be seen itself, but instead used inside a > view that was expected to be queried. The idea was that you could do a JOIN > to the DUAL table and create two rows in the result for every one row in > your table. Then, by using GROUP BY, the resulting join could be summarized > to show the amount of storage for the DATA extent and for the INDEX > extent(s). The name, DUAL, seemed apt for the process of creating a pair of > rows from just one. Optimization Beginning with 10g Release 1, Oracle no longer performs physical or logical I/O on the DUAL table, though the table still exists.Oracle Database SQL Language Reference 11g Release 2 (11.2), Selecting from the DUAL Table DUAL is readily available for all the users in database. In other database systems Several other databases (including Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Teradata) enable one to omit the FROM clause entirely if no table is needed. This avoids the need for any dummy table. *Firebird has a one-row system table RDB$DATABASE that is used in the same way as Oracle's DUAL, although it also has a meaning of its own. *IBM DB2 has a view that resolves DUAL when using Oracle Compatibility.DB2 10.1 InfoCenter :: DB2 Version 10.1 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows - DUAL table It also has a table called sysibm.sysdummy1 that has similar properties to the Oracle DUAL one. *Informix: Informix version 11.50 and later has a table named with the same functionality but a more verbose name.Informix 12.10 InfoCenter :: Administrator's Reference :: The sysmaster database :: The System- Monitoring Interface Tables :: sysdual You can use to create a name in the current database with the same functionality. *Microsoft Access: A table named DUAL may be created and the single-row constraint enforced via ADO (Table-less UNION query in MS Access) *Microsoft SQL Server: SQL Server does not require a dummy table.

It is suitable for use in selecting a result function such as SYSDATE() or USER(), although it is not essential. *PostgreSQL: A DUAL-view can be added to ease porting from Oracle.PostgreSQL :: PostgreSQL Wiki :: Oracle to Postgres Conversion *Snowflake: DUAL is supported, but not explicitly documented. It appears in sample SQL for other operations in the documentation. *SQLite: A VIEW named \\"dual\\" that works the same as the Oracle \\"dual\\" table can be created as follows: *SAP HANA has a table called DUMMY that works the same as the Oracle \\"dual\\" table. *Teradata database does not require a dummy table.

CAAWC is designated as the army centre of excellence for static-line round, static-line square and military free-fall parachuting, and it teaches basic, jump master and instructor courses in each sub-set of parachuting. Equally important, within its mission are: the Arctic operations advisor, basic/advanced mountain operations, helicopter insertion instructor, helicopter operations, and aerial delivery courses. The centre is also responsible for the Canadian Forces Pathfinder course (the future of which is under review). CAAWC comprises Headquarters Company, Parachute Training Company, Advanced Mobility, and Support Company (which supports all CAAWC training and also acts as the Canadian Forces Parachute Depot).

He was born in Dublin and is known as \\"Toccy\\". O'Connor was a defender or midfielder during his long career in the League of Ireland. He played for Home Farm, St. Patrick's Athletic, Bohemians and Dublin City. A native of Ballymun, O'Connor began his league career at Home Farm, making his debut against Galway United in the opening game on October 19, 1986. Despite relegation for Home Farm that year, he impressed at full back. He spent 3 years at the club making 70 league appearances before Brian Kerr brought him to St Patrick's Athletic. He made his debut against Limerick and Pats won their first League of Ireland Championship since the 1960s. After 3 seasons at Pats and 95 league appearances, he moved to Bohemians in the summer of 1992. In his first season at Dalymount, Toccy and Bohs came agonisingly close to winning the league title, losing in a 3 way play-off to Cork City. This was to become a sign of things to come as Bohs became the nearly men of the 90s, losing 4 FAI Cup semi finals in a row and finishing as runners up in the league in 1995/96 and 1996/97. Then came the 2000/01 season where Bohs done the \\"Double\\" of League of Ireland and FAI Cup. O'Connor scored the only goal in that cup final against Longford Town. He picked up another League winners medal in 2002/03 and was rewarded with a testimonial against St Patrick's Athletic on January 31, 2003. This turned out to be his last game for Bohs when after 302 league appearances and 23 goals, he left Dalymount Park to join Dublin City. He helped them win the First Division title that year and after 2 years there, he retired. He won 3 Premier Division winners medals (2 at Bohs) and appeared in 3 consecutive FAI Cup finals, scoring in 2 of them including the winner in the 2001 final against Longford Town. One of the most popular figures in Bohs' recent history, O'Connor was inducted into the Bohemian F.C. Hall of Fame in November 2007.

This is a list of the bird species recorded in Estonia. The avifauna of Estonia include a total of 339 species, of which five are rare or accidental. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Accidental species are included in the total species count for Estonia. The following tag has been used to highlight accidentals. The commonly occurring native species are untagged. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Estonia Loons Order: GaviiformesFamily: Gaviidae Loons, known as divers in Europe, are a group of aquatic birds found in many parts of North America and northern Europe. They are the size of a large duck or small goose, which they somewhat resemble when swimming, but to which they are completely unrelated. There are 5 species worldwide and 3 species which occur in Estonia. *Red-throated loon, Gavia stellata *Arctic loon, Gavia arctica *Common loon, Gavia immer Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds.

The avifauna of Latvia include a total of 344 species, of which one was introduced by humans and sixteen are rare or accidental. Twelve species listed are extirpated in Latvia and are not included in the species count. Seven species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Latvia. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Latvia *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Latvia as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions *(Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in Latvia although populations exist elsewhere Loons Order: GaviiformesFamily: Gaviidae Loons, known as divers in Europe, are a group of aquatic birds found in many parts of North America and northern Europe.

Marris and Bugtis are the strongest Baloch tribes in the Balochistan. The Marris occupied in the north, while the Bugtis occupied in the south. Today, the region is divided into three districts: Kohlu, Dera Bugti and Sibi. History The Marris and Bugtis first met the British when a Major Billamore entered their territory during the First Anglo- Afghan War. In April 1840, Captain Lewis Brown was sent to occupy Kahan but surrendered to Marri Chief Doda Khan five months later. Meanwhile, Bugtis had trouble with Sir Charles Napier and General John Jacob came greater trouble with both tribs. In 1845 after the treaty was signed which shows that both tribs were supported financially by Khan of Kalat. Population By 1901, the total population of the Country was around 39,000, of which 19,000 or so were Marri, 18,500 Bugti, and 415 Hindu. Most inhabitants were nomadic. The Marris were divided into three sub-clans: the Bahawalanzai from the Ghazini clan and the Sherzai and Bijarani from the Loharani clan.

This is a list of the bird species recorded in Lithuania. The avifauna of Lithuania include a total of 342 species, of which two have been introduced by humans and twenty-three are rare or accidental in Lithuania and are not included in the species count. Eight species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Lithuania. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Lithuania *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Lithuania as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions *(Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in Lithuania although populations exist elsewhere Loons Order: GaviiformesFamily: Gaviidae Loons, known as divers in Europe, are a group of aquatic birds found in many parts of North America and northern Europe.

Kousmine devised a restrictive diet for treating many human ailments including multiple sclerosis and cancer. There is, however, no scientific evidence that it is effective. Life Born in 1904 into a well-to-do family in Russia, Catherine Kousmine and her parents fled the country in 1916 before the Russian revolution, settling in Lausanne. The young Catherine went to the Ecole Sup√©rieure of Lausanne where she graduated in sciences. She then went on to medical school. Upon graduation in 1928, she moved to Zurich, in professor Guido Fanconi's unit, to specialize in pediatrics, then worked in Vienna, Austria, where she got her degree in this discipline. Back in Switzerland, she had to resume her work as a general practitioner because her degree in pediatrics was not recognized by Swiss authorities. Dr. Kousmine spent most of her life in Switzerland. She set up the Fondation Catherine Kousmine in Lutry, Switzerland, to promote her methods. It has sister foundations in France, Germany and Italy. There is also a Kousmine Medical Center in Vevey, Switzerland. Work Kousmine advocated a restrictive diet as a basis for treating a number of human ailments, especially cancer.

It was promoted to the Diocese of Tabora in 1925 and to the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Tabora in 1953. Creation and boundaries It was separated from the Vicariate Apostolic of Nyanza by a Decree of Propaganda on December 30, 1886. Its limits, as fixed on December 10, 1895, were: * North - the Vicariate Apostolic of Southern Nyanza * East - a line drawn from Lake Manjara (36¬∞E.) along the mountain ridges to the North West of Ugago * South - the northern limits of Ujanzi, Ugunda, Ugetta, Uvenza, and Ujiji * West - Lake Tanganyika and the eastern boundary of the Congo Free State to the village of Ruanda. History This district was originally included in the Apostolic Vicariate of Tanganyika. In 1879, R.P. Ganachan of the White Fathers penetrated this previously unknown region and endeavoured to settle at Tabora, but was unsuccessful. Two years later R.P. Guillet succeeded and opened an orphanage there, which was shortly afterwards transferred to Kipalapala one league distant. In 1844 R.P. Lourdel settled at Djiue-la-Singa, but the post was abandoned on 13 March 1885. On 11 January 1887, the mission of Unyanyembe was separated from Tanganika, with R.P. Girault as superior of the provicariate. On 23 August 1887, Mgr Jean Charbonnier was consecrated bishop in the Kipalapala orphanage chapel by Mgr. L√©on Livinhac of Uganda. This was the first episcopal consecration in Equatorial Africa. The station at Kipalapala was destroyed in 1889 by the natives. Two years later it was restored, and another was opened at Uchirombo. Towards the close of 1897 five Sisters of Notre-Dame d'Afrique arrived at Uchirombo. In 1900 there were in this mission 20 priests, 6 nuns, 49 catechists, 1842 neophytes, 6000 catechumens, and 150 children in the schools. A German scientist, Dr. Richard Kandt, a Protestant, was so impressed by the good work of the Catholic missionaries that he presented his estate at Tabora to the vicar Apostolic to found a school and hospital. The first vicar Apostolic, Mgr Fran√ßois Gerboin, of the White Fathers, born in 1847 and consecrated titular Bishop of Turbubto in 1897, resided at Ushirombo. Mission statistics in 1905 * 33 priests * 7 lay brothers * 6 nuns * 72 catechists * 26 schools with 966 pupils * 11 hospitals * 5 leper houses * 17 orphanages with 325 children rescued from slavery * 3,000,000 infidels * 678 Catholics * 2889 catechumens.

The avifauna of Slovakia include a total of 364 species, of which two have been introduced by humans and 94 are rare or accidental. Eleven species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Slovakia. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Slovakia *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Slovakia as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Loons Order: GaviiformesFamily: Gaviidae Loons, known as divers in Europe, are a group of aquatic birds found in many parts of North America and northern Europe. They are the size of a large duck or small goose, which they somewhat resemble in shape when swimming, but to which they are completely unrelated.

The avifauna of Slovenia include a total of 376 species, of which four have been introduced by humans and five are rare or accidental. Eleven species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Slovenia. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Slovenia *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Slovenia as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Loons Order: GaviiformesFamily: Gaviidae Loons, known as divers in Europe, are a group of aquatic birds found in many parts of North America and northern Europe.

Galbreath and his wife Dorothy, Darby Dan Farm made important stallion acquisitions beginning in 1957 when he paid Rex Ellsworth $1 million for a half-interest in his 1956 Horse of the Year, Swaps, then later acquired the remaining half for another $1 million. In 1961, Galbreath imported the undefeated Ribot from Europe and in 1965 brought French Hall of Fame horse Sea-Bird to stand at stud for five years at Darby Dan Farm under a $1.5 million lease. That same year, Galbreath was part of a syndicate that acquired Sword Dancer for stud duty at Darby Dan Farm. The operation eventually produced several champions, including: * Chateaugay - 1963 Kentucky Derby winner * Proud Clarion - 1967 Kentucky Derby winner * Roberto - 1972 Epsom Derby winner * Little Current - 1974 Preakness and Belmont Stakes winner * Proud Truth - 1985 Breeders' Cup Classic winner *Graustark - undefeated in seven straight races, he sustained a career-ending injury while in the lead in the 1966 Blue Grass Stakes. Darby Dan Farm is one of just two horse breeding farms in the world to both breed and own the Derby winners on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. In 1974, Galbreath won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Breeder. Among the trainers who conditioned Darby Dan horses for racing were Loyd Gentry, Jr.,Jack Long, Lou Rondinello, James P. Conway, and John M. Veitch. Among the trainers who conditioned Darby Dan horses for racing were: * Jack Long * Rollie T. Shepp * Matthew H. Jordan * Loyd Gentry Jr. * Jimmy Conway * Lou Rondinello * John Veitch After John W. Galbreath's death in 1988, Darby Dan Farms continued under the ownership of his son Daniel and daughter Joan (Jody) Phillips. In 1992, grandson John Phillips acquired the Kentucky farm from family members. Among their successes has been Soaring Softly, winner of the 1999 Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf and Memories of Silver for the Phillips Racing Partnership. References * Bowen, Edward L.

The avifauna of Croatia include a total of 396 species, of which five have been introduced by humans, and seventy-two are rare or accidental and two are extirpated or extinct in Croatia and are not included in the species count. Ten species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Croatia. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Croatia * (I) Introduced - a species introduced to Croatia as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions * (Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in Croatia although populations exist elsewhere Loons Order: GaviiformesFamily: Gaviidae Loons, known as divers in Europe, are a group of aquatic birds found in many parts of North America and northern Europe. They are the size of a large duck or small goose, which they somewhat resemble when swimming, but to which they are completely unrelated. There are 5 species worldwide and 4 species which occur in Croatia. *Red-throated loon, Gavia stellata *Arctic loon, Gavia arctica *Common loon, Gavia immer *Yellow- billed loon, Gavia adamsii Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds.

He translated three other texts from the Tibetan: Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa (1928), Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines (1935), and The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation (1954), and wrote the preface to Paramahansa Yogananda's famous spiritual book, Autobiography of a Yogi (1946). Early life and background Walter Yeeling Wentz was born in Trenton, New Jersey in 1878. His father Christopher Wentz (1836 - February 4, 1921) - born in Weissengen, Baden, Germany - had emigrated to America with his parents in 1846.https://lamesahistory.com/wp-content/uploads/LO_222_2001.pdf - \\"Wentz- Park House Landmarked, A Designated Historic Site\\" in Lookout Avenue, Volume 22, Number 2 (Autumn 2001), p. 6 (La Mesa Historical Society) At the turn of the century (1900) Christopher was a real estate developer in Pablo Beach, Florida. Walter's mother (and Christopher's 1st wife) - Mary Evans Cook (died 1898) - was of Irish heritage. Christopher and Mary were married on August 11, 1862 in Trenton, Mercer County, New Jersey. Christopher's 2nd wife (they were married on June 4, 1900 in Duval County, Florida) was Olivia F. Bradford (1863-1949). Walter had two brothers and two sisters. Though initially a Baptist, Walter's father had turned to spiritualism and Theosophy. As a teenager, Walter read Madame Blavatsky's Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine in his father's library, and became interested in the teachings of Theosophy and the occult.Lopez, p. 49 Subsequently, at the turn of century, Walter moved to San Diego, California to join his father's profession, but also because it was close to Lomaland, the American headquarters for the Theosophical Society, which he joined in 1901. At age 24 Evans-Wentz went to Stanford University, where he studied religion, philosophy, and history and was deeply influenced by visitors William James and W. B. Yeats. He went on to receive B.A. and M.A degrees. He then studied Celtic mythology and folklore at Jesus College, OxfordSutin 2006, pg. 262 (1907). He performed ethnographic fieldwork collecting fairy folklore in Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall, Brittany, and the Isle of Man. In 1911 Evans-Wentz published his degree thesis as a book, The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries. While at Oxford, he added his mother's Welsh surname Evans to his name, being known henceforth as Evans-Wentz.Lopez, p. 52 Career At Oxford, Evans-Wentz met archaeologist and British Army officer T.E. Lawrence, who advised him to travel to the Orient. Thereafter, funded by his rental properties in Florida, he started travelling extensively, spending time in Mexico, Europe, and the Far East. He spent the years of the First World War in Egypt. He boarded a ship from Port Said, Egypt for Colombo, Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). Here he started studying the history, customs and religious traditions of the country, and also collected a large number of important Pali manuscripts, which were later donated to Stanford University. Next in 1918, he travelled across India, covering important religious sites, \\"seeking wise men of the east\\". He met spiritual figures like Yogananda, J. Krishnamurti, Paul Brunton, Ramana Maharishi, Sri Krishna Prem and Shunyata. He also visited the Theosophical Society Adyar, where he met Annie Besant and Swami Shyamananda Giri (1911-1971).Swami Shyamananda Giri (May 4, 1911 - August 28, 1971) - AKA Yogacharya Binay Narayan. His name at birth was Binayendra Narayan Dubey. Finally he reached Darjeeling in 1919;Oldmeadow, p. 136 there he encountered Tibetan religious texts firsthand, when he acquired a Tibetan manuscript of Karma Lingpa's Liberation through Hearing during the Intermediate State (or Bardo Thodol) from Major Campbell, a British officer who had just returned from Tibet. He next met Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup (1868-1922), an English teacher and headmaster at Maharaja's Boys School, in Gangtok, Sikkim. Samdup had been with 13th Dalai Lama during the latter's exile years in India in 1910; more importantly for Evans-Wentz, he had already worked as a translator with Alexandra David-N√©el, the Belgian-French explorer, travel writer, and Buddhist convert, and Sir John Woodroffe, noted British Orientalist. For the next two months, Evans-Wentz spent morning hours before the opening of the school with Samdup working on the text. During this period, they worked out the origins of what was to become The Tibetan Book of the Dead. Evans-Wentz soon left for the Swami Satyananda's ashram, where he was practicing yoga. Samdup meanwhile was appointed as a lecturer at the University of Calcutta, in the same year, and died in Calcutta three years later, long before the book could be finally published.Lopez, p. 53 In 1927, The Tibetan Book of the Dead was published by Oxford University Press. Evans- Wentz chose the title \\"Book of the Dead\\" because it reminded him of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. For Westerners, the book would become a principal reference on Tibetan Buddhism. Evans-Wentz credited himself only as the compiler and editor of these volumes; the actual translation was performed by Tibetan Buddhists, primarily Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup. Evans-Wentz's interpretations and organization of this Tibetan material is hermeneutically controversial, being influenced by preconceptions he brought to the subject from Theosophy and other metaphysical schools.Donald S. Lopez, Jr. The Tibetan Book of the Dead: A Biography, Princeton University Press, 2011. This book was followed by Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa (1928), also based on Samdup's translations. Evans-Wentz was a practitioner of the religions he studied. He became Dawa-Samdup's \\"disciple\\" (E-W's term), wore robes, and ate a simple vegetarian diet.Sutin 2006, pg. 263 In 1935, he met Ramana Maharshi and went to Darjeeling, where he employed three translators, Sikkimese of Tibetan descent, to translate another text which was published as Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines (1935). Evans-Wentz intended to settle permanently in India, but was compelled by World War II to return to the U.S. There he would publish The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation in 1954. A final work, Cuchama and Sacred Mountains (1989), was published posthumously. In 1946, he wrote the preface to Yogananda's well known Autobiography of a Yogi, that introduced both Yogananda and himself to wider audiences in a book which has been in print for over sixty-five years and translated into at least thirty-four languages. He mentions having personally met Yogananda's guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri, at his ashram in Puri and noted positive impressions of him. Evans-Wentz remains best known his lasting legacy to Tibetology.Oldmeadow, p. 135'Walter Evans-Wentz' in: Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2013). The Illustrated Tibetan Book of the Dead. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. B00BCRLONM Later years and death Evans-Wentz remained a Theosophist for the rest of his life, writing articles for Theosophical publications and provided financial support to the Maha Bodhi Society, Self-Realization Fellowship, and the Theosophical Society.Lopez, p. 54 He lived for 23 years at the Keystone Hotel in San Diego.Oldmeadow, p. 137 Evans-Wentz spent his last months at Yogananda's Self-Realization Fellowship in Encinitas, California and died on July 17, 1965. His Tibetan Book of the Dead was read at his funeral.Sutin 2006, pg. 267 Legacy The Department of Religious Studies at Stanford University has hosted \\"The Evans-Wentz Lectureship in Asian Philosophy, Religion, and Ethics\\" since 1969, funded by a bequest from Evans- Wentz.

Life Broschi was born in Naples, the son of Salvatore Broschi, a composer and chapelmaster of the Cathedral of the Puglinese citizens, and Caterina Berrese (according to the Book of Baptisms of the Church of S. Nicola, today near the Episcopal Archives). The Broschi family moved to Naples at the end of 1711, and enrolled Riccardo, their firstborn, in the Conservatory of S. Maria di Loreto, where he would study to become a composer under G. Perugino and F. Mancinipresso. Salvatore, meanwhile, died unexpectedly, at age 36, on 4 November 1717. Caterina subsequently made Riccardo head of the family. He made his debut in 1725 with La Vecchia Sorda. Next, he moved to London in 1726 and stayed there until 1734 and wrote six heroic operas, his most successful being Artaserse. In 1737 he moved to Stuttgart and briefly served at the Stuttgart court (1736-7) for Charles Alexander, Duke of W√ºrttemberg, then returned to Naples before joining his brother in Madrid in 1739.

Its prime aim was to stabilize the pro-German Democratic Republic of Georgia and to secure oil supplies for Germany by preventing the Ottoman Empire from gaining access to the oil reserves near Baku on the Ab≈üeron peninsula.  Background  On December 5, 1917, the Armistice of Erzincan was signed by Russians and Ottomans, ending the armed conflicts between Russia and the Ottoman Empire in the Caucasus Campaign of the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I.Tadeusz Swietochowski, Russian Azerbaijan 1905-1920, page 119 The Committee of Union and Progress moved to win the friendship of the Bolsheviks with the signing of the Ottoman-Russian friendship treaty (January 1, 1918). On January 11, 1918, the special decree On Armenia was signed by Lenin and Stalin which armed and repatriated over 100,000 Armenians from the former Tsar's Army to be sent to the Caucasus for operations against Ottoman interests. On January 20, 1918, Talaat Pasha entered an official protest against the Bolsheviks arming Armenian army legions and replied, \\"the Russian leopard had not changed its spots.\\" Bolsheviks and Armenians would take the place of Nikolai Nikolayevich Yudenich's Russian Caucasus Army. On March 3, 1918, the Armistice of Erzincan was followed by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk marking Russia's exit from World War I. Between March 14 - April 1918 the Trabzon peace conference was held between the Ottoman Empire and the delegation of the Transcaucasian Diet (Transcaucasian Sejm). Enver Pasha offered to surrender all Turkish ambitions in the Caucasus in return for recognition of the Ottoman reacquisition of the east Anatolian provinces at Brest-Litovsk at the end of the negotiations.Ezel Kural Shaw History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey. Page 326 The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk provided some relief to Bolsheviks who were tied up in fighting the civil war. However, the oil fields of Baku were not under control of the Russians and Germany had a high demand for oil. During March 30 to April 2 in 1918, thousands of Azeris and other Muslims in the city of Baku and adjacent areas of the Baku Governorate of the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic were massacred by Dashnaks with strong support from Bolshevik Soviets. The Azeris refer to this as a genocide (). This event is known as the March Days or March Events. On April 5, the head of the Transcaucasian delegation Akaki Chkhenkeli accepted the Treaty of Brest- Litovsk as a basis for further negotiations and wired the governing bodies urging them to accept this position.Richard Hovannisian \\"The Armenian people from ancient to modern times\\" Pages 292-293 The mood prevailing in Tiflis was very different. The Armenians pressured the Republic to refuse. They acknowledged the existence of a state of war between themselves and the Ottoman Empire. Hostilities resumed and Ottoman troops under Vehip Pasha overran new lands to the east, reaching pre-war the frontiers. On May 11, a new peace conference opened at Batum. At this conference the Ottomans extended their demands to include Tiflis as well as Alexandropol and Echmiadzin; they also wanted a railroad to be built to connect Kars and Julfa with Baku. The Armenian and Georgian members of the Republic‚Äôs delegation began to stall. Beginning on May 21, the Ottoman army moved ahead once again. The ensuing conflict led to the Battle of Sardarapat (May 21‚Äì29), the Battle of Kara Killisse (1918) (May 24‚Äì28), and the Battle of Bash Abaran (May 21‚Äì24). On May 28, 1918, Georgia, signed the Treaty of Poti with Germany, and welcomed the prospect of a German expedition, seeing the Germans as protectors against the post-Russian Revolution havoc and the Ottoman military advances.Lang, David Marshall (1962). A Modern History of Georgia, p. 207-8. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson.  Forces  The expedition was composed almost exclusively of Bavarian troops and included the 7th Bavarian Cavalry Brigade, reinforced by the 29th Bavarian Infantry Regiment (7th and 9th J√§ger Battalions), the 10th Sturm Battalion, 1 machine-gun detachment, and the 176th Mortar Company.Erickson, Edward J. (2000) Ordered to Die: a history of the Ottoman army in the first World War, p. 233 It was 3,000 strong and commanded by Major General Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein. General Erich Ludendorff was also involved in supervision and organizing the expedition; he met Georgian representatives in Berlin, accompanying them to see Kaiser Wilhelm II. Besides the Georgians of the Caucasus, there were Georgians who served in the Georgian Legion of the Imperial German Army.Lang (1962), p. 182 Many of these officers and soldiers were awarded by the Georgian Order of Queen Tamar, issued specifically for the German military personnel. This force was transported by sea from the Crimea to the Georgian Black Sea port of Poti where it landed on June 8, 1918, and was later reinforced by the German troops recalled from Syria and Ukraine for service in Georgia.Erickson (2000), p. 186 The Ottoman Empire had the Third Army in the region. Expedition= Prelude  On June 4, under direct threat of the Ottoman 3rd Army, which had advanced to within 7 km of Yerevan and 10 km of Echmiadzin, the First Republic of Armenia signed the Treaty of Batum. On June 10, the German force arrived at Tiflis, the capital of Georgia, and held a joint German-Georgian military parade in the city‚Äôs main thoroughfare. The German expedition was soon joined by the former German prisoners of war in Russia and the mobilized W√ºrttemberg colonists who had settled in Georgia in the mid-19th century. Combined German- Georgian garrisons were stationed in various regions of Georgia, including Poti, Ochamchire, Kutaisi, and Borchalo.  Vorontsovka skirmish  The arrival of the German troops in Georgia coincided with the growing German- Turkish rivalry for Caucasian influence and resources, notably the oilfields near Baku, Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan, on the Caspian and the associated rail and pipeline connection to Batumi on the Black Sea (Baku- Batumi pipeline).Briton Cooper. Busch (1976), Mudros to Lausanne: Britain‚Äôs Frontier in West Asia, 1918-1923, page 22. SUNY Press, Early in June 1918, the Ottoman 3rd Army under Vehip Pasha renewed its offensive on the main road to Tiflis, and confronted a joint German-Georgian force. On June 10, the Turks attacked at Vorontsovka and took many prisoners, leading to an official threat from Berlin to withdraw its support and troops from the Ottoman Empire. Hans von Seeckt was dispatched to Georgia and met with Enver Pasha at Batumi. The Ottoman government had to concede to German pressure by sacking Vehip Pasha and halting its drive, for the moment, and further advance into Georgia for the Batumi-Tiflis-Baku railway and associated pipeline. The Ottomans reoriented their strategic direction towards Azerbaijan with a blocking action against British forces in northwestern Persia.Erickson (2000), p. 187 Nuri Pasha led the drive under the Islamic Army of the Caucasus also known as the Ottoman Army of Islam.  On the way to Baku  Simultaneously, two additional German divisions were moved from the Balkans and Ukraine to advance on Baku. At the same time, Germany provided financial assistance to the Bolshevik government in Moscow and offered to stop the Ottoman Army of Islam in return for guaranteed access to Baku's oil. According to the August 27 agreement between the Bolshevik government in Moscow and Germany, the latter was to receive a quarter of Baku‚Äôs oil production which was sent through the Caspian Sea and up the lower Volga to German supported forces in Ukraine. The German government requested from Ottoman Empire to stall an offensive into Azerbaijan. Enver Pasha ignored this request. After the Battle of Baku, the Ottoman Army of Islam under Nuri Pasha, on the heels of the evacuating Soviet forces, captured the city on September 15, 1918. The Soviet Bicherakhov detachment and the German Caucasus Expedition led by Colonel Friedrich von der Holtz met on 17 September, along with the forces of the Baku Commune who were leaving the city. Grigory Korganov was a Georgian Communist activist participating in the Battle of Baku, one of the 26 Baku Commissars and Bolshevik Party leaders in Azerbaijan during the Russian Revolution. However, a severe political crisis in Germany, which started later that month, rendered the Caucasus expedition abortive.  Aftermath  On October 21, the German government ordered the withdrawal of all troops from the region. The last ship with German soldiers aboard departed from Poti, Georgia, on December 13, 1918. Thus, it was the last German military formation to return home, in April 1919, from active service in World War I.

He was born on September 13, 1944 in San Vicente del Raspeig (Alicante, Spain). He has lived in Paris since 1975. Together with paintings and sculptures Sa√ºlo Mercader creates pieces of art in different fields such as ceramics, high-warp tapestries, engravings, drawings, terracotta and lithographies. His works are not linked with a special trend in visual arts. They are inspired by the events that take place in society and in his life. He feels that he is a witness of his Time and a chaman that links Humankind with the Universe where all kinds of life comes from. He is a go-between through his art creations.  Biography  Sa√ºlo Mercader started modelling and drawing when he was six- years old. He learnt the different techniques of modelling in the ¬´ Fallas ¬ª workshops in Alicante. He was an apprentice in the sculptor Serrano's workshops which allowsed him to master the different steps in the making of bronze sculptures : from moulding to different processes of casting. In 1964 he arrived in Bilbao (The Basque country in the North of Spain) where his artistic career started. He made himself known through a series of collective and individual exhibitions. This exceptional osmosis between the people and himself remained extraordinary for two decades and received a considerable echo in the media: in the written press as well as in audio and TV reports. As the disciple of the sculptor Lucarini,Alberto Lopez Etchevarrieta : \\" Discipulo de Lucarini, Saulo un pintor independiente \\" - Diario Pueblo - 22 Noviembre de 1970 he carved on stone and worked on bronze doing a series of remarkable busts\\" El marques de Lozoya ha posado para el pintor Saulo \\" - El Adelantado de Segovia - 14 Agosto de 1973 as well as painted portraits such as the one of the Marquis de Lozoya in Segovia.Alberto Lopez Echevarrieta : \\" Me compra un cuadro el Museo de Bellas-Artes de Madrid para una exposicion nacional itinerante \\" - Pueblo, 26 Junio de 1972 One of his paintings : Peras en Primavera was acquired by the Fine Arts Museum in Madrid.\\" Fueron entregados 20 premios meritos a la vocacion \\" - Diario femenino - 4 Abril de 1973, p.15 The Spanish Vocation Fund Prize he gets in 1972\\" Saulo, premio de la Fundacion espanola de la Vocacion \\" - Hierro, 24 Abril 1973\\" Entrega de los premios M√©rito a La Vocacion 1972 \\" - La Vanguardia espanola - 3 Abril de 1973\\" Entrega de los premios M√©rito a La Vocacion 1972 \\" - La Vanguardia espanola - 3 Abril de 1973 rewards his talent, fortitude and authentic artistic vocation.

He lives at the Cit√© Internationale des Arts for five years and meet a lot of artists from all around the world: painters, sculptors, comedians, musicians, ballet-dancers, writers. These encounters enlarged his vision of art. He participated in the most important art shows in the capital : Salon de Mai, Salon d‚ÄôAutomne, Grands et Jeunes d‚ÄôAujourd‚Äôhui, Jeune Sculpture, Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais, Contradiction, Outre-Couleur. In the Cit√© Internationale des Arts‚Äô workshops he starts weaving high-warp tapestries guided by Jagoda Buic and Nora Music and meets the weaver Marin Varbanov there. He follows S. W Hayter's courses in carving as well as Matthey's courses in painting at the Superior National School of Fine Arts in Paris. Thanks to his exhibition at the International Contemporary Art Fair (FIAC) in 1978 in Paris, he became well known to the European public. These were years when he created a lot of works and travelled extensively. In 1981, he received an American Fulbright grant: he went to New York where he worked for a couple of years. He lived on the campus of Columbia University and followed Professors Mahoney's and Maxwell's courses on lithography and Professor Schorr's courses on painting at Teachers' College, where he realized a series of ceramics with Panay Reyes. He isolated himself for a while in order to paint a few large paintings on the theme of American football whose exhibitions are outstanding and called the attention of the press and the media that make him be known by the New York public.\\" Sa√ºlo Mercader at Intar gallery in New-York \\" - The Village Voice-the weekly Newspaper n¬∞ 39 - 28 Septembre 1982Miguel Perez and Carlos Velez : \\" Qu√© pasa ? \\" The Daily News, New-York- 9 Octobre 1982Expositions- France-Am√©rique - Le Courrier des Etats-Unis n¬∞503 ‚Äì 14-20 Janvier 1982Marjorie Harris Beshers : \\" Sa√ºlo Mercader at Macy gallery in New-York \\" - T.C Advocate ‚Äì Art Review n¬∞4- F√©vrier 1982Gentes \\" Sa√ºlo Mercader en Noticias del Mundo \\" - Noticias del Mundo-New-York n¬∞ 578- 6 y 7 Febrero de 1982Marjorie Harris Beshers : \\" Sa√ºlo Mercader an internationally-known artist paints at Teachers‚ÄôCollege, an artist hailed by the European press and critics \\" Annual Magazine 1982 ‚Äì page 14 , February 1982 At the same time, he painted five extra large paintings on the theme of the Tree that will be exhibited at the Biennial of Alexandria.

Back to Paris, he earned a doctoral degree in visual arts cum laude at Paris VIII University in 1986. He meets Tapies, Semprun and Camilo Jos√© Cela. He exhibited regularly in the capital and travelled mainly to Spain, where he became acquainted with Francis Bacon, in Madrid. Greece and particularly Crete and its mythology inspired him a fresco of large dimensions (720 √ó 420 cm) entitled : L‚ÄôAttente du Minotaure which belongs to the Tzovaridis's art collection in Athens.Article de la r√©daction : \\" Sa√ºlo Mercader acaba la restauracion de su mural La espera del Minotauro en Atenas \\" - Informacion- Alicante, 20 Septiembre 2007 While he sojourns in the Naxos island in the Cyclads, he draws a series of works inspired by the Cycladic art. In Turkey and in Cyprus, Sa√ºlo Mercader is confronted with the Eastern cultures and art, its traditions and architecture that are so many sources of prolific inspiration to him. He exhibits a few paintings in Istanbul at the Biennal of Contemporary Art ; then in Bodrum, in Nicosia where the encounters with Turkish and Chypriot artists such as Aylin √ñrek, Habib Gerez, Feti Arda allow him to discover a new and rich world in creativity that nourish and inspire his creations.Mehmet Zaimovi√ß : \\" Sa√ºlo Mercader in Resim leri \\" - Milliyet- Sanat Sergisi, Juillet 1984J.Habib Gerez : \\" sa√ºlo Mercader \\", Efl√¢tun- Sanat,K√ºlt√ºr-Juillet/ao√ªt 1984Cevdet Cagdas : \\" Atat√ºrk K√ºlt√ºr Merkezinde,Sa√ºlo Mercader sergisi \\" - Bozkurt, 9 Ao√ªt 1984 In Germany, his palette of colours get brighter and his subjects get more daring forms in Berlin as well as in D√ºsseldorf and K√∂ln where he exhibits. In Brussels and Ostende, he paints misty landscapes. In Amsterdam, he visits the treasures at the Rijksmuseum and the self-portraits of Van Gogh at the Van Gogh museum. He exhibits in Utrecht, inspired by its romantic canals : all those places are mines of so many awaken dreams to Sa√ºlo Mercader who paints, carves, draws, writes about his experiences, what he sees, the people he meets. In Paris, he is acquainted with Alechinski and Valerio Adami. The city of Figeac (in the Lot region, South of France) welcomes two exhibitions in 1995 and 2000 on the Minotaur theme : Les Hurlements du Taureau, hailed by the media : written press, audio and TV reports.

The Catalan period inspired him tormented landscapes and subjects with symbolical elements : keys, candlesticks, twilights, the moon, portraits and self-portraits. In Paris he paints what he calls ¬´ the Green series ¬ª mainly urban people, tramps, homeless, mothers with child, picturesque and poetical tales. Later on, the tauromachia scenes and a series of minotaurs are so many themes that denounce censure, injustices, solitude, wars. He paints a very large painting entitled : La Bacchanale des Minotaures, exhibited in Figeac, an exhibition sponsored by the DRAC(Direction R√©gionale d‚ÄôArt Contemporain), by the Conseil R√©gional du Lot (South-west of France) and by the Spanish Embassy. In New- York, he is influenced by the American football, the American way of life, the Native Americans and urban landscapes : towers, skyscrapers. The themes of the couple and mothers with child are recurrent. Inspired by the Australian Aborigenes‚Äôculture and traditions, he paints some 70 canvasses that symbolize their Dream Time Mythology. Each trip abroad is a source of inspiration and productions of works.  Sculptures  Sa√ºlo Mercader is interested in different materials whether it be terrecotta, ceramics, stone, marble, bronze. In 2007, he creates a monument which is a commanded for the City of San Vicente del Raspeig (Alicante, Spain). It is called : Dona Lluna. The bronze sculpture is 5m50 high and stands in the middle of a rotunda. It is surrounded with 12 painted pieces of raw marbles that represent a lunar calendar. This monument is a heathen temple dedicated to Womankind unique in Europe.Sol Gimenez : \\" tributo a la mujer \\" - Informacion(Alicante) , 12 Mars 2007\\" La escultura de Mercader Dona Lluna ya luce en la entrada del parque Lo Torrent con todo su esplendor \\" - Noticias Semanal San Vicente del Raspeig, 15-21 Mars 2007 n¬∞132  Tapestries  In the late 70 s, Sa√ºlo Mercader weaves some high-warp tapestries called ¬´ sacred ¬ª.

The avifauna of the Republic of North Macedonia include a total of 335 species, none of which are introduced, accidental or endemic. Sixteen species listed are extirpated in North Macedonia and are not included in the species count. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. The following tag has been used to highlight extirpated species. Untagged birds are commonly occurring native species. *(Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in North Macedonia although populations exist elsewhere Loons Order: GaviiformesFamily: Gaviidae Loons, known as divers in Europe, are a group of aquatic birds found in many parts of North America and northern Europe.

The mountain forms an unafforested granite massif, whose highest point is about east of Newton Stewart. It is the highest of the \\"Solway Hills\\" sub-range, and the southernmost of Scotland's 219 Grahams, thus making it, or rather its subsidiary top, Knee of Cairnsmore, the most southerly mountain in Scotland. The view to the south takes in the Cree Estuary and Wigtown Bay, and extends as far as the Lake District, the Isle of Man and Snowdonia. The highest summits of the Galloway Hills can be seen to the north, and Ireland is in the view to the west.The Story of Cairnsmore of Fleet National Nature Reserve. p. 8. It is home to the most extensive area of open moorland in Galloway, and has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The summit and eastern flanks of the hill (an area of 1,922 hectares) are designated as a national nature reserve, which is managed by NatureScot.The Story of Cairnsmore of Fleet National Nature Reserve. p. 6. Cairnsmore of Fleet lies in the south of the council area Dumfries and Galloway, and in the historic county of the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright. Flora and fauna Cairnsmore of Fleet is home to many of the typical habitats of upland Britain, such as grasslands of purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea), Calluna vulgaris and Vaccinium myrtillus heaths and localised blanket mire with Trichophorum and cotton-grass (Eriophorum). The summit region is characterised by sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), bilberry, Carex bigelowii and the moss Racomitrium lanuginosum. The massif is also home to a variety of birds, mammals and invertebrates. Bird species including upland raptors such as the merlin, peregrine falcon, kestrel, raven and buzzard all breed at Cairnsmore of Fleet, as do birds such as golden plover and dotterel.The Story of Cairnsmore of Fleet National Nature Reserve. p. 9. Hen harriers visit the area in the winter months, and golden eagle may also be seen, but no longer breed on the site.The Story of Cairnsmore of Fleet National Nature Reserve. p. 16.The Story of Cairnsmore of Fleet National Nature Reserve. p. 2. Both red and roe deer inhabit the area: the red deer live on the central upland area of the reserve throughout the year, whilst roe deer can be seen at the edges of the surrounding forests. There is also a population of feral goats that may be descended from animals abandoned by crofters during the 18th and 19th centuries. Seventeen species of butterfly and over 120 species of moth have been recorded at Cairnsmore of Fleet, including the small pearl-bordered fritillary, large heath moth, broad‚Äìbordered white underwing and argent and sable. Other notable invertebrate species found include the nationally notable golden green ground beetle.The Story of Cairnsmore of Fleet National Nature Reserve. p. 3. Red and black grouse are managed on the estates, and there is extensive grazing by domestic sheep (chiefly Scottish Blackface) and cattle, which helps maintain habitats for birds. This has been hampered by the decline in farming of traditional breeds, such as Belted Galloway cattle, with farmers keeping breeds more suited to lowland grazing. Conservation designations The landscape of Cairnsmore of Fleet is typical of the granite uplands of Galloway, consisting of open moorland, with montane ground at higher altitude. This type of landscape was historically common across the Southern Uplands, but the increase in forestry land use in the Galloway Forest Park has seen it become much rarer. A national nature reserve (NNR) was established in 1975 to protect the continuity between un-afforested moorland and montane ground above the potential tree limit. The total land area within the NNR is 1,922 ha, of which 1,314 ha was purchased by the Nature Conservancy Council (the predecessor to NatureScot) from the Forestry Commission in 1974; a further 608 ha (including the summit of Cairnsmore of Fleet) belong to neighbouring landowners, and are managed under Nature Reserve Agreements. The NNR is classified as a Category II protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and forms an important part of the Galloway and Southern Ayrshire UNESCO Biosphere Reserve,The Story of Cairnsmore of Fleet National Nature Reserve. p. 8. a network of reserves that are meant to demonstrate a balanced relationship between people and nature. It is one of three \\"core areas\\" of the Biosphere, alongside Silver Flowe and the Merrick Kells. Cairnsmore of Fleet has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) since 1968: the SSSI covers a wider area than the NNR, being 3837 ha in size. Tourism & outdoor activities Rock climbing on Craignelder The usual route of ascent is the \\"Tourist Route\\", which is one of the most popular hikes in Galloway. It starts in the south-west, near Stronord, before climbing through the Bardrochwood Moor forest on to the summit. The Cairnsmore estate, near the start of this path, is the location mentioned in John Buchan's 1915 thriller The Thirty-nine Steps. Another route reaches the summit from the south, starting near the NNR visitor centre. This takes in the subsidiary summits of the Knee of Cairnsmore and Meikle Mulltaggart to form a circular route on the eastern side of the mountain. There are a number of good rock climbing areas on the subsidiary peaks around Cairnsmore of Fleet, but many of these have nesting birds on them so should be completely avoided in spring and early summer. The climbing is all on good quality granite. Areas that are described in the current guidebook include Craignelder, Loch Grannoch and the Clints of Dromore. National Cycle Route 7 runs to the south of Cairnsmore of Fleet, passing underneath the Big Water of Fleet viaduct. A visitor centre, operated by NatureScot and open all year, is located at Dromore at the southern end of the national nature reserve. NatureScot have commissioned five sculptures which have been located around the reserve. The sculptures were produced by artist Matt Baker and are each accompanied by poetry written by Mary Smith. These artistic works are intended to reflect elements of the landscape. History The memorial to aircrews killed in crashes on Cairnsmore of Fleet. The earliest evidence of human occupation at Cairnsmore of Fleet dates to the Bronze Age: sites showing evidence of the cultivation of land on the southern side of the mountain and cairns on the summit all date from this period. Later, during the medieval period, flocks of sheep and goats were grazed here during the summers by Cistercian monks. Animals were also hunted for game during this period.The Story of Cairnsmore of Fleet National Nature Reserve. p. 11. During the 18th and early 19th centuries land use changed with the clearance of small tenants during the process of enclosure. The population in the area dropped as the main activity became sheep farming, with small numbers of shepherds looking after large flocks. Hunting also declined, and the mining of minerals (chiefly lead) commenced. The enclosure process was resisted by some tenants, and during the 1720s the Cairnsmore of Fleet moors became the headquarters of Billy Marshall, leader of a group known as the \\"Galloway gypsies\\" who demolished dykes in the area during 1724. The Galloway gypsies also engaged in smuggling, and are reputed to have made their base at \\"Billy Marshall‚Äôs cave\\" on the north side of the mountain.The Story of Cairnsmore of Fleet National Nature Reserve. p. 12-13. The latter part of the 19th century saw the arrival of the Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Railway, which opened in 1860: the railway viaduct over the Big Water of Fleet remains a prominent feature in the landscape to the south Cairnsmore of Fleet. During the Victorian period accessibility via the railway led to a boom in grouse shooting, with sporting interests becoming the main activity on the western side of the hill. Close to the summit of Cairnsmore of Fleet stands a memorial stone to the crews of aircraft that have crashed on the mountain. Between 1940 and 1979 eight crashes occurred: the earliest was a Luftwaffe Heinkel bomber, and the latest a United States Air Force McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II.

It is a refinement of the Navigating Net data structure, and related to a variety of other data structures developed for indexing intrinsically low- dimensional data.Kenneth Clarkson. Nearest-neighbor searching and metric space dimensions. In G. Shakhnarovich, T. Darrell, and P. Indyk, editors, Nearest- Neighbor Methods for Learning and Vision: Theory and Practice, pages 15--59. MIT Press, 2006. The tree can be thought of as a hierarchy of levels with the top level containing the root point and the bottom level containing every point in the metric space. Each level C is associated with an integer value i that decrements by one as the tree is descended. Each level C in the cover tree has three important properties: *Nesting: C_{i} \\\\subseteq C_{i-1} *Covering: For every point p \\\\in C_{i-1}, there exists a point q \\\\in C_{i} such that the distance from p to q is less than or equal to 2^{i} and exactly one such q is a parent of p. *Separation: For all points p,q \\\\in C_i, the distance from p to q is greater than 2^{i}.  Complexity = Find  Like other metric trees the cover tree allows for nearest neighbor searches in O(\\\\eta*\\\\log{n}) where \\\\eta is a constant associated with the dimensionality of the dataset and n is the cardinality. To compare, a basic linear search requires O(n), which is a much worse dependence on n. However, in high- dimensional metric spaces the \\\\eta constant is non-trivial, which means it cannot be ignored in complexity analysis. Unlike other metric trees, the cover tree has a theoretical bound on its constant that is based on the dataset's expansion constant or doubling constant (in the case of approximate NN retrieval). The bound on search time is O(c^{12} \\\\log{n}) where c is the expansion constant of the dataset.  Insert  Although cover trees provide faster searches than the naive approach, this advantage must be weighed with the additional cost of maintaining the data structure. In a naive approach adding a new point to the dataset is trivial because order does not need to be preserved, but in a cover tree it can take O(c^6 \\\\log{n}) time. However, this is an upper-bound, and some techniques have been implemented that seem to improve the performance in practice.http://hunch.net/~jl/projects/cover_tree/cover_tree.html  Space  The cover tree uses implicit representation to keep track of repeated points.

G. Bowen Emrys George Bowen FRGS, FSA, also known as E. G. Bowen (28 December 1900 ‚Äì 8 November 1983), was an internationally renowned geographer with a particular interest in the physical geography and social geography of his native Wales. A diminutive figure, Bowen was on the academic staff of the Department of Geography and Anthropology at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, from the 1920s and continued to write and lecture there till his death in 1983. Biography E. G. Bowen was born in Carmarthen, Wales, the elder child of Thomas Bowen, an insurance agent, and Elizabeth Ann Lynch. He was educated at the council school, Pentre-poeth, and from 1912 to 1919 at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Carmarthen, before proceeding in 1919 to the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he obtained a first-class honours degree in Geography in 1923. Bowen became the first Cecil Prosser research fellow at the Welsh National School of Medicine at Cardiff, where he investigated the relationship between 'racial type' and chest disease. From 1928 to 1929, he was an assistant editor with the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica before being appointed in 1929 as an assistant lecturer in the Department of Geography and Anthropology at Aberystwyth. He remained there for the rest of his academic career, including during World War II, when he continued to lecture and also taught meteorology to the Royal Air Force initial training wing, which was located there. He was Gregynog Professor of Geography and Anthropology from 1946 to his retirement in 1968.Harold Carter, 'Bowen, Emrys George (1900‚Äì1983)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Bowen was President of the Institute of British Geographers in 1958 and President of Section E of the British Association in 1962. He was awarded the Murchison Grant by the Royal Geographical Society in 1958. In 1949 he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and, in 1967, he was President of the Cambrian Archaeological Society. He was awarded an honorary LL.D. by the University of Wales and, in June 1979, was awarded an honorary D.Univ. by the Open University. He was an honorary member of the Gorsedd of Bards. Bowen continued with his academic work and writing after his retirement, continuing to lecture at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, the United Theological College, Aberystwyth, and at various other universities and colleges on Geography and Church history.National Library of Wales Papers of Bowen, E. G., (Geographer) Bowen's work on the Settlements of the Celtic Saints in Wales (1954) revolutionized studies in this field. He lived for many years with his sister. After his retirement in 1968, Bowen continued to live at Aberystwyth, where he died unmarried after a heart attack on 8 November 1983 at Bronglais General Hospital, Aberystwyth. He was buried at Carmarthen. The 'E. G. Bowen Map Room' at Aberystwyth University is named in his memory.University of Wales, Aberystwyth. E. G.

The nearby Smethwick Engine (1779) was built to pump water from below the six locks (Smethwick flight) at the eastern end of the Smethwick Summit back to the summit level. Another engine at the western end reclaimed water from use at the Spon Lane locks. In the 1780s, a cutting was constructed by John Smeaton, enabling three of the six locks on each side of the Smethwick Summit to be removed. When, in the 1820s, Thomas Telford cut his deeper, straighter New Main Line of the Birmingham Canal it ran close to the existing James Brindley and John Smeaton Old Main Line near Smethwick Summit. The Engine Arm was built to bring water from Rotton Park Reservoir and also to connect the Smethwick Engine, which was used to pump water from the Birmingham Level of the canal to the Smethwick Summit (Wolverhampton Level) of the Old Main Line. The Engine Arm was made navigable in 1830 between the Smethwick Summit of the Old Main Line canal and Engine Arm Basin, just beyond the Smethwick Engine a few hundred metres away so that boats could carry coal to the engine. Beyond Engine Arm Basin a culvert, the Birmingham Feeder, which runs parallel to the New Main Line at the top of the southern embankment, was a second feeder that brought water from Rotton Park Reservoir, supplementing an earlier feeder which followed a level contour route. The culvert (now overgrown and dry) is open for a part of its run along the canal but is covered where it runs through built-up places. The branch crossed the New Main Line via Telford's cast iron Engine Arm Aqueduct, a Scheduled Ancient Monument.Sandwell Council - Top Ten Canal Attractions The original Smethwick Engine, at the corner of Rolfe Street and Bridge Street North was replaced in 1892 by a newer engine at Brasshouse Lane bridge, and its excavated foundations are also a Scheduled Ancient Monument, File:Engine Arm Aqueduct west.jpgTelford's cast iron aqueduct Image:Engine Arm Aqueduct channel.jpgThe top of the aqueduct Image:Engine Arm Aqueduct roving bridge.jpgRoving bridge at the junction Image:Engine Arm Basin.jpgEngine Arm Basin - private moorings at the end of the navigable section See also *Canals of the United Kingdom *History of the British canal system References *Canal Companion - Birmingham Canal Navigations, J.

The avifauna of Malta include a total of 416 species. It lies on a major migration route and many species pass through during spring and autumn. Two have been introduced by humans. 23 species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 2019 edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Accidental species are included in the total species count for Malta. The following tag has been used to highlight accidentals. The commonly occurring native species are untagged. Birds that have been recorded breeding in Malta are also tagged. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Malta *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Malta as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Common shelduck Northern shoveler Ferruginous duck Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

It was formed from the Apostolic Vicariate of Nyassa in 1903. In 1952, the Apostolic Vicariate of Shir√© was renamed as the Apostolic Vicariate of Blantyre. In 1959 it was promoted as the Archdiocese of Blantyre. Geographic location Nyassaland Protectoriate lies between 9¬∞41' and 17¬∞15' S. lat., and 33¬∞ and 36¬∞ E. long. It is about long, its width varying from 50 to . It covers an area of . The white population is at most 600, while there are millions of natives. Nyassaland is divided into thirteen districts. The mission of the White Fathers evangelizes the five northern districts which lie west of Lake Nyassa. The Vicariate Apostolic of Shire is composed of the eight other districts lying south of Lake Nyassa. The vicariate lies between 13¬∞30' and 17¬∞15' S. lat. It is bounded on the north by the District of Angoniland and Lake Nyassa, on the east, south, and west by Portuguese East Africa. The territory lies as the crow flies from the Indian Ocean. The name is derived from the Shire River which flows through the length of the vicariate. History The Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith confided evangelization of this territory to the missionaries of the Company of Mary, founded by St. Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort. On 28 June 1901, the first three missionaries arrived at Blantyre and on 25 July began their first mission in Angoniland. In 1904 the mission was made a prefecture Apostolic and one of the missionaries, Rev. Father Prezeau, former missionary of the Diocese of Kingston, Canada, was elected the first Apostolic prefect. Already four stations had been founded, and numerous schools established in all directions spread the Christian doctrine. On 14 April 1908, Pope Pius X erected the prefecture into a vicariate Apostolic with Mgr Auguste Prezeau as the first vicar. Prezeau was consecrated at Zanzibar on October 4, 1908, by Mgr Allgeyer of the Fathers of the Holy Ghost, and died in France on 4 December 1910. On 4 May 1910, one of the missionaries received from Rome the notification of his elevation to the dignity of Apostolic vicariate. Mgr Auneau was consecrated at Chilubula, Northern Rhodesia, by Mgr Dupont of the White Fathers, 1 Nov., 1910.

It was published after Tolstoy's death in 1911 and received high praise from Tolstoy's contemporaries. D. S. Mirsky considered it \\"a masterpiece of rare perfection.\\" Without ever calling Alyosha a holy fool, Tolstoy centers the story on his meekness, aloofness, and foolishness. Alyosha's simple life, soft-spoken manner, and calm acceptance of death epitomizes Tolstoyan principles. History The hero and namesake of the story was based on a real person. According to the memoirs of Tatyana Andreevna Kuzminskaya (Lev Tolstoy's sister-in-law), \\"the assistant to the cook and yard-keeper was the half idiot Alyosha the Pot, who was, for some reason, romanticized to the point that reading about him, I could not recognize our holy fool Alyosha. But, as far as I remember, he was quiet, inoffensive, and meekly did all that was ordered of him.\\"–¢. –ê. –ö—É–∑–º–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è. –ú–æ—è –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å –¥–æ–º–∞ –∏ –≤ –Ø—Å–Ω–æ–π –ü–æ–ª—è–Ω–µ. –¢—É–ª–∞, 1964, —Å. 200. Synopsis Alyosha is a young child who lives in a village and obtained the nickname \\"the Pot\\" from an incident where he broke a pot in his youth. At 19, his father sends him to live with a merchant's family as a servant. As the family begins to assign him all of the housework and errands, he does everything without complaint. Alyosha's father collected his salary, but Alyosha got to keep the occasional tip. Alyosha spoke very little, was not educated, and did not know formal prayers‚Äîinstead, he prayed with his hands, crossing himself. After a year and a half, Alyosha began to feel that the cook, Ustinja, took pity on him. \\"He felt for the first time in his life that he--not his services, but he himself--was necessary to another human being\\".http://www.online-literature.com/tolstoy/2729/ Alyosha falls in love with Ustinja and eventually asks her to marry him, but his father forbids it. Alyosha agrees and ceases to discuss marriage with Utinija. For the first and only time in the story, Alyosha breaks his lighthearted, laughing demeanor and cries. Later during Lent, Alyosha falls while he clears snow from the roof. On the third day, he died quietly, having calmly accepted his impending death. \\"He lay in wonderment, then stretched himself, and died.\\" See also *Bibliography of Leo Tolstoy *Tolstoyanism ReferencesExternal links *az.lib.ru Category:Short stories by Leo Tolstoy ","title":"Alyosha the Pot"},{"id":"10912234","text":"Parbasdorf is a town in the district of G√§nserndorf in the Austrian state of Lower Austria.

Its setting is a large university, known familiarly as \\"Moo U\\" because of its large agricultural college, in the American Midwest. The novel is a satire that uses a sprawling narrative style, following the lives of dozens of characters over the course of the 1989‚Äì1990 academic year. Plot summary Moo contains over a dozen overlapping plot lines and multiple protagonists and is therefore very difficult to summarize. The following summary includes the plot lines that are clearly resolved in the end of the novel. Book One Chapter one of Moo introduces Old Meats, a building at the center of the campus of Moo University no longer in use. However, Old Meats is home to a huge hog named Earl Butz whose only purpose in life is to eat as much as he would like in order to grow as large as possible as part of an experiment conducted by Dr. Bo Jones. Bob Carlson, a sophomore at Moo U, cares for Earl. Chapter two introduces the Dubuque House, a large residence hall on campus and four of its newest residents Mary, Keri, Sherri and Diane. It is move-in day, and each of the four girls briefly reflects on what has brought her to Moo University and their hopes for their college careers. Timothy Monahan, a professor of English, is returning to the campus for the beginning of the school year. He meets one of the new faculty members, Spanish professor Cecelia Sanchez, when their classes end up being in neighboring rooms. Marly Hellmich is an adult woman who works in the university cafeteria and lives at home caring for her elderly father. Marly also volunteers at her church, where she meets Nils Harstad, the dean of the agricultural extension. Later in Part One, Nils decides that what he needs to complete his life is a wife and a large family of small children. He decides that Marly would be the perfect mate and proposes to her. Marly contemplates the engagement and decides to accept on the basis that a life with Nils, a successful and economically stable older man, would offer her all of the things that she would not be able to have on her own; she believes she will become a kind of Cinderella. Book One continues with a lecture given by economics professor Dr. Gift on Costa Rica and the economic gains to be found there. The lecture is well attended by students and faculty but during the lecture Chairman X, the chairman of the Horticulture department, becomes outraged and attempts to point out how detrimental Gift's pursuits will be to Costa Rica's environment. Later, Ivar Harstad, provost of the university, meets with Elaine Dobbs-Jellinek, the associate vice-president, and Arlen Martin, CEO of the Trans National corporation. Arlen, a wealthy but not a moral businessman whose emphasis is on agricultural projects, is aware of the university's budget constraints and attempts to make a deal with them. He offers to give them money if they would devote some of their research facilities and faculty to help him on a project. Another important aspect of Book One is the introduction of Loren Stroop, a local farmer and a paranoid old man who is so suspicious of the big agricultural companies and the CIA that he wears a bulletproof vest every day. This fear is promoted by the fact that Stroop is building a machine that he believes will revolutionize agriculture. Stroop meets with Nils to speak about the machine and the two men set up a future meeting for Nils to come to the farm and see the machine. At the close of Part One, though, Stroop suffers a stroke. Joy Pfisterer oversees the university's fleet of horses and is also the girlfriend of Dean Jellinek. Joy is introduced while teaching a class in which Bob Carlson is a student. After class, Joy reflects on her relationship with Dean, one that is strained because of Dean's constant obsession over his calf-free lactation project and his failure to tend to Joy and their relationship. Smiley closes Book One with a chapter entitled ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs in Bed With Whom‚Äù in which she lays out some of the intimate details of relationships occurring between various students and faculty including Mary and Hassan, a graduate student, Nils and Marly, Bob and Diane, Tim and Cecelia, Chairman X and Lady X, and Mrs. Walker and Mrs. Lake. Book Two Book Two, the shortest section of the book, opens with a news article detailing Governor Early's budget cuts, which include severe reductions for the university. The chapter also contains a series of memorandums within the university detailing the likely impact of the proposed cuts. One of the most significant developments is the relationship between Cecelia and Chairman X. The two meet one day in the library where Cecelia is reminiscing about her former life in Los Angeles. She recognizes Chairman X from Dr. Gift's lecture. They strike up a conversation and surprisingly have sex on the library floor. Meanwhile, Keri is failing Dr. Gift's economics class. She reflects on her family's experiences on their farm. When one of her uncles buys out the other, it causes a deep family division that ruins the family dynamic, and Keri blames her uncle's selfish drive for fortune and prosperity and his disregard for the family. Chairman X and Cecelia continue their relationship. Cecelia fabricates a story about her uncle Carlos and his farm in Costa Rica and her childhood that she spent there. By telling the story she manages to convince X to stay longer and spend more time with her rather than returning home to have dinner with his family and take his children to a movie. Book Two closes with a visit to Loren Stroop in the hospital after his stroke. His neighbors, the Millers, come to visit him and reassure him that they have taken care of everything around the farm except for visiting the shed where he keeps the machine locked up. He nods to try to tell them that they should look in the shed and tell someone about the machine but they fail to understand this since he cannot talk. Book Three The section opens with Dr. Gift reflecting on a report he wrote supporting the gold mine under a virgin cloud forest in Costa Rica. Mary, Keri, Sherri, and Diane are spending more time together. Mary is sick with a virus. Gary Olsen revises a short story, but is disappointed with the end result. After a night at the library, Diane decides to follow Bob in hopes of learning the mystery of his work-study job and she meets Earl Butz. Tim and Cecelia have an unhappy date. Multiple characters discuss the fall of and importance of Eastern European communism. Helen hosts a Thanksgiving feast with Ivar, Nils, Marly, and Marly's father. Marly's father and Nils debate Marly and Nils future, after Nils announces to everyone that ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs plan‚Äù is that he and Marly have six children and live in Poland. Joy sets goals for her future, including marriage and a child. Tim Monahan's third novel is accepted for publication. Helen, Dr. Garcia, Dr. Gift, and Dr. Cates consider Monahan's promotion to full professor. Dr. Gift says Monahan's writing is salacious, and Helen disagrees. Monahan's promotion is only given lukewarm approval. At the meeting, Helen distributes copies of Dr. Gift's paper to everyone at the meeting, revealing the virgin cloud forest mining project much to Gift's chagrin. Gary Olson and Lydia go out. Lydia suggests Gary should kick out Lyle, his roommate, so she could come over more often. Margaret gets Tim to call Cecelia by giving him a copy of Dr. Gift's memo which she had secretly kept. A grant saves Old Meats, but it would have to be a chicken museum, which was not what Dr. Bo Jones requested. The book concludes with Mary being the victim of bigotry and feeling unable to discuss her experience with Keri, Sherri, and Diane. Gary continues to struggle with his writing. Book Four The main connection between characters in this section is the holidays. It is Christmas time, and Cecelia decides not to return to Los Angeles for the holiday because of Chairman X. However, she changes her mind the following day and goes to LA. A friend of Bob's comes to care for Earl Butz, and Earl notices and is shaken up by the change. Drama unfolds in the X's household. Chairman X spends the holiday at home with his family. He admits to Lady X that he is having an affair with Cecelia. As they fight, they both make accusations and blame the other for their unhappiness. Mary spends Christmas with her family. She is worried about her grades and somewhat disappointed she did not stay back at school. Joy is talking to Dean and becomes upset with their conversation. She goes outside, runs, and remains outside until she is nearly frozen to death. When she returns home Dean has to take care of her until an ambulance arrives. It is time to ring in the New Year. Chairman X writes a flyer opposing the destruction of the virgin cloud rain forest and revealing Gift's role in the scheme. The media reports on the issue and tries to unravel the controversy. As word spreads of the mining plan, chaos occurs. Dean Nils Harstad is attacked by Chairman X. Tensions run high between Mary, Keri, Sherri, and Diane in Dubuque House until they hear about the riot at Lafayette Hall and leave to go there. Book Five Book five opens with Dr. Margaret Bell arriving at a conference in Florida where she is to present a paper. Her senses seem to awaken through this mini get- away, and she indulges in the experience. When the conference is abruptly cancelled, Margaret ends her vacation and receives a large bill. Back on campus, Dr. Gift reflects on Arlen Martin and the collapse of Seven Stones Mining. A memo is sent out announcing more proposed cuts in the budget, resulting in threats of layoffs. Another setback for the university occurs when Elaine Jellinek breaks the news to Dr. Bo Jones that there is no longer a grant for the chicken museum. Dr. Jones does not seem very disappointed and decides to take a trip to Kirghizia to research wild boars. Loren Stroop has moved home and maneuvers around on his own to the best of his ability. Although his physical stamina has diminished, his quirky personality still remains. Feeling the need to check up on his invention, Loren attempts to travel out to his barn during a snowstorm. He struggles against the winter wind and falls into the heavy snow, never reaching his destination. He perishes in the storm. The announcement of a future McDonald's takes the campus by surprise and forces Marly to contemplate her existence on campus. She decides to leave her job as well as abandon her relationship with Nils. In the end, Marly chooses to run off with her truck driver boyfriend. Another major event at the university occurs during the destruction of Old Meats. This pivotal scene showcases Earl Butz as he is trapped inside the building during the demolition. Bob realizes that Earl is in danger but is unable to stop the destruction process. Earl is aware of his dire situation. Instinct takes over, and Earl takes off running, making his way across campus. As Bob tries to catch Earl, Mrs. Walker, Chairman X, and Keri all witness Earl's rampage through the university. Earl eventually stops from exhaustion and falls dead at the feet of Keri. His death makes front-page news. Dean and Joy work on their couple's therapy. Dean immerses himself in helping Joy out of her depression, which she finds exhausting. Cecelia continues to struggle with finding her place in the Midwest and Moo University, and considers returning to California. As the cutbacks continue to stress the faculty, Mrs. Walker realizes that her job is on the line as a result of leaking Gift's memo as well as the discovery that she has transferred funds from the athletic budget to the library. Mary, Keri, Sherri, and Diane seem to be heading their separate ways as the school year closes out. For the following year, Sherri makes plans to room with friends from high school, and Mary decides to return to Chicago. When some of the future plans fall through, Mary and Keri decide to reside together again. As the university's future appears bleak, Ivar reflects on how he originally viewed the university and how things have changed since he and Nils were first students at Moo. Just when the university seems doomed, Joe Miller arrives with a sense of hope by carrying out Stroop's wishes to donate his invention to the university. Ivar, Nils, Bob Brown, and the president all assemble to begin a frantic search for the blue prints for Stroop's machine. Coincidentally, Dr. Cates acquired these blue prints from a student, and thinking they were a work of art, Cates calls Mrs. Walker in effort to discover who the artist might be. At the same time, the committee contacts Mrs. Walker to discuss Stroop's donation. Gaining power with this information, Mrs. Walker not only connects the missing prints to the hands in need, but saves her own position. The discovery of the machine uplifts everyone's spirits and causes the governor to reverse the budget cuts. The campus atmosphere starts to lighten. Marriage comes into play towards the end of the novel when several characters contemplate their relationships and their plans for the future. Dr. Gift and Elaine Jellinek dine together and day-dream about the possibility of a life with each other, but in the end, they each discard the thought. Marriage is not in the cards for Nils and Marly, but Nils and Marly's father reach an understanding and decide to reside with one another due to Marly's absence. The biggest turn-around occurs between Chairman X and Lady X as they resolve their disputes and reunite their family. Chairman and Lady X have a small wedding which attracts the curiosity of the neighbors and close friends. The marriage upsets Cecelia, who has decided to stay, but Tim convinces her that this is for the best. The book then closes as Chairman X and Lady X embrace in a ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù kiss.

Themes \\"Developmental Events\\", such as the history of divorces and separations among the characters are important to this book. Similarly, teachers and mentors of both sexes are seen trying to cultivate their own talents, making them appear larger than life.Piirto, Jane. Themes in the Lives of Successful Contemporary U.S. Women Creative Writers. Roeper Review Vol.21 Iss. 21 (Sep 1998): 60-71. Smiley helps nurture Mrs. Walker's genius in the book, creating a hero-like character that has a quiet feminine power that is often overlooked in some books. She is seen as someone ‚Äúwith quite complex power relationships‚Ä¶a person who gets things done‚Äù even though she is just a mere secretary. In contrast to this, all the administrators who are men are much older and do not have as big a role as Mrs. Walker in making decisions. Also, Mrs. Walker represents ‚Äútacit power‚Ä¶which construct[s] administrative workers as low level females.‚ÄùSzekeres, Judy. The Invisible Workers. University of Southern Australia, 2003. The overt/position power is weak when it comes to Mrs. Walker's knowledge of the university, which she withholds unless asked, making her the most powerful character in Moo. Smiley also helps bring out themes of her life by writing about them in Moo. Two of the topics in the book are the issues with the history of divorce and break up.Piirto. Smiley has been divorced three times, and many of her characters have complicated and interlaced relationships with one another(the relationship between Lady X and Chairman X, the ridiculous marriage of Dr. Dean Jellinek and Joy, and the failed relationship with Dean Nils Harsted and Marly Helmich). The mixture of relationships and satire in Moo creates absurd problems between the characters, but Smiley is still able to make it believable. There is a ‚Äúpopular assumption that the academy is a ‚Äòclosed society‚Äô‚Äîidiosyncratic, isolated, out of touch with the ‚Äòreal world.‚Äù Moo U. is actually a part of the surrounding culture instead of a separate entity, and it ‚Äúmay be set off from the larger culture, but it is never cut off, a lifeline of money being necessary for its well-being and growth.‚Äù It is a symbol of the town itself. The search for a ‚Äúcomic protagonist to lead an unauthorized, irrelevant tour through academia‚Äù is and seems misguided. It is also considered a social comedy, where ‚Äúno individual being is the heroic center of the institution.‚ÄùNakadate. Key events  In Chapter 21, Loren Stroop suffers a stroke, leaving his plans for the revolutionary equipment he builds in limbo. This eventually leads to the solution to the lack of funding that threatens the well-being and livelihoods of the characters of Moo as the university eventually receives control of the machine. In Chapter 22, Governor Early proposes budget cuts that lead to the near downfall of Moo University. The faculty begins downsizing and the class sizes for students become larger. In Chapter 34, Dr. Gift finishes his report for the Transnational America Corporation discussing mining for gold in the last virgin cloud forest in Costa Rica. This sets forth the course of action that leads to professors choosing sides on the issue of the mining proposal. In Chapter 47, Joe Doakes utters a racial slur to Mary, an African-American student at Moo University. Mary's roommates at the Dubuque House drive Joe Doakes away from the table with insults (though Mary is uncertain as to whether they heard what Doakes said). Mary goes on a downward spiral of social withdrawal as she realizes the roommates do not discuss anything that may create tension between themselves. In Chapter 64, Earl Butz escapes from Old Meats as the building is torn down. Earl Butz exemplifies the embracing of the idea that bigger is better as he is a project that no one but the few people directly involved with know anything about. When he escapes, he becomes a public symbol of a university in crisis. Reception of Moo \\"And Moo To You Too\\" by Jane Smiley explains the experience of her book tour for her new novel Moo. While writing this satirical novel, Jane Smiley knew just what she had in mind and how she felt it would be received. However, when it came time for her novel to be circulated, she found that the reception was not what she expected. As it turned out, critics and readers did not seem to know about what Smiley was writing. Critics had very different responses to Moo. Some felt that the book was extremely funny, others less so. Some spoke of characters with no depth or shape, while others noted that they had come to care about the outcome of the characters' lives. Smiley speaks about how this made her feel irritable because this was an endeavor on which she spent over a year writing. She thought that her feeling and passions were well displayed but none of this was mentioned by critics. In the end, Smiley was still happy with Moo. She was happy that it could be read in two ways. She had intended for it to be tricky and evasive, \\"And then, it turned out, that's exactly what it was!\\" \\"And Moo To You Too\\" Jane Smiley, Civilization, Nov/Dec95, Vol.2 Issue 6, p75, 1p, 1c.

Gameplay The player controls Rex, a 'rino-sapien' mercenary, hired to eliminate the humans that have built a Great Tower in a place called Zenith.Rex game instructions Action takes place in a flip-screen cavern complex. Rex can jump, shoot and activate a shield to block incoming attacks. Enemies include fixed gun turrets and human soldiers; shooting the latter initiates a 'multi recoil system' in which the defeated soldier's body continues to recoil until the player's bullets stop hitting it. Destroyed enemies leave behind Energy Bubbles, which can be used to upgrade Rex's weapon. Development Rex was developed by a programming team consisting of Neil Harris, Richard Allen and John Anderson. After working for IBM, they all left to form The Light, choosing the Z80 as their development platform. Neil and John were coders, whilst Richard worked on graphics.Sinclair User issue 81; Code Talk article on The Light Rex was the only game they developed.The Light at World of Spectrum In issue 112 of Retro Gamer Magazine, coder Jas Austin revealed that Creative Reality, authors of several titles for Martech Games, were the actual creators of Rex.

For U.S. tram engines see Steam dummy Cologne-Bonn railway, pulling a train through Br√ºhl marketplace. A tram engine is a steam locomotive (or more rarely a diesel, electric or fireless locomotive) specially built, or modified, to work on a street, or roadside, tramway. Steam tram engines Steam tram locomotive of Geldersche Tramwegen, Netherlands In the steam locomotive era, tram engines had to comply with certain legal requirements, although these varied from country to country: * The engine must be governed to a maximum speed of ( in the UK) * No steam or smoke may be emitted * It must be free from noise produced by blast or clatter * The machinery must be concealed from view at all points above from rail level *Most of the locomotives must have a cab at each end To avoid smoke, the fuel used was coke, rather than coal. To prevent visible emission of steam, two opposite systems were used: * condensing the exhaust steam and returning the condensate to the water tank * Reheating the exhaust steam to make it invisible Builders=United Kingdom ;Beyer, Peacock Beyer, Peacock and Company built some steam tram engines, including three for the Glyn Valley Tramway in Wales. ;Henry Hughes Hughes's Locomotive & Tramway Engine Works, Loughborough started building tram engines in 1876. His engines were of the saddle-tank type and exhaust steam was condensed in a tank under the footplate by jets of cold water from the saddle-tank. ;Kitson & Co Kitson & Co. started to build tram engines in 1878. They used a roof-mounted, air- cooled, condenser of thin copper tubes in which the exhaust steam was condensed. This is rather like the radiator on a modern road vehicle. The air- cooled system eventually became standard for steam tram engines. ;William Wilkinson William Wilkinson of Wigan patented the exhaust steam reheating system about 1881. It now seems bizarre to re-heat steam after, rather than before, use because it would involve waste of fuel. Despite this, the Wilkinson system was popular for a time and engines of the Wilkinson type continued to be built up to about 1886. Similar reheaters were also used for road steam wagons, such as the Sentinel. ;Others Other British builders of steam tram engines included: * Aveling and Porter * Charles Burrell & Sons * Dick, Kerr & Co. * Thomas Green & Son * Manlove, Alliott & Co. Ltd. * Manning Wardle * Merryweather & Sons *Hawthorn, Leslie & Co built steam tram locomotives for the Railway Operating Division in 1915 ; they were copies on SNCV type 18. Germany ;Krauss The German firm Krauss built steam tram engines, including one for the Wolverton and Stony Stratford Tramway in England. SNCV tram engine (Haine-Saint-Pierre, 1920)  Belgium  Starting from the 1880s every steam locomotive builder in Belgium supplied the SNCV with tram engines (nearly 1000 of them were built). Ateliers de Tubize, FUF Haine-Saint-Pierre and Soci√©t√© de Saint-L√©onard also supplied several tram engines to foreign companies such as Spain, the Netherlands, France or Italy. The last steam engines were delivered in the early 1920s. Steam tram in France.  France  Corpet-Louvet, D√©cauville, Pinguely and Blanc-Misseron built engines for French and foreign tramways, the latter was created by Ateliers de Tubize in order to avoid taxation of imported locomotives. These companies also built industrial engines and some shunters ; large steam locomotives were mostly built by other companies.  United States of America  Baldwin = The Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, built steam tram engines, including most of those used in New South Wales, Australia. A small number of steam tram engines were manufactured in Sydney, Australia to Baldwin designs by Henry Vale, T. Wearne and the Randwick Tramway Workshops. Decline In cities, steam tram engines faded out around 1900, being replaced by electric trams or buses. Rural steam trams held longer until replaced by electric, diesel trams units or buses. In France and Belgium, the last steam-powered tram lines closed in the 1960s.

It was created as a result of a partnership between Lagard√®re Active and state-owned broadcaster France T√©l√©visions. In 2019, the M6 Group bought Gulli as well as the television division of the Lagard√®re Active Group. History The channel was launched on 18 November 2005 on the digital terrestrial television platform in France. Ten years later, on 1 July 2015, Gulli launched its own HD simulcast feed on the Astra 1 satellite. On 5 April 2016, its HD feed is launched on DTT. Gulli is a joint venture between kids- television pioneer companies Lagard√®re Active and the state-owned France T√©l√©visions. The former is known due to is children's network, Canal J, while the latter has a long history investing on kids programming through its youth- oriented division on France 3. On 23 December 2013, a deal was reached between Lagard√®re and France T√©l√©visions to purchase the latter's shares on Gulli. The deal was finalised on 29 October 2014 with the transfer of 34% of France T√©l√©visions's shares to Lagard√®re for ‚Ç¨25 million. The network has been launched in Russia, Africa and the Middle East, broadcasting in Russian, French and Arabic. The brand itself was sold alongside the rest of the Lagad√©re channels to Groupe M6 in 2019. The channel has been launched in Brazil on August 9, 2020 on the newly established satellite TV provider BluTV, being the first expansion of the channel to the Americas.  Branding  At the CSA hearings for the new DTT channels, the channel was presented under the name of Gulliver, named after Jonathan Swift's character Gulliver's Travels, before being baptized Gulli. On 8 April 2010, Gulli puts on the air a new branding designed by G√©d√©on. On the same occasion, the channel is modernizing its logo, which has become darker, giving it volume and changing to 16/9 but dynamically (4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratio). A new branding, again designed by the G√©d√©on, is on the air in September 2013. On 28 August 2017, Gulli changed its branding. This branding is done by the 17MARS.

Malyavan was a respected voice within the intellectual and royal circles in Lanka. It is noted that Malyavan was an intellectual who was well- versed in scriptures and was known for holding his ground, despite being the dissenting voice. Malyavan was a maternal grandfather Of Dashanana. Actually Malyavan was the elder brother of Ravana's actual maternal grandfather Sumali and once used to be the former king of Lanka, later Ravana reconquered it. In addition to the royal protocol relations that he had with Ravana, he was the maternal grandfather of Ravana, therefore, he had a dual relationship. In the latter relationship, he was known for trying to persuade Ravana outside the chambers of protocol and advising him as a grandfather. Ravana respected him tremendously because of their relation and due to his intelligence. Malyavan was against the war with Lord Rama and had tried to convince Ravana to let go to Sita; however, all his advise was rejected by Ravan. After the death of Ravan, Malyavan remained in his position and became the chief adviser to Vibishana, Ravana's younger brother and Malyavan's third grandson. Malyavan's wife was Sundari who was very beautiful. She had eight sons - Vajra Mushti Viroopaaksh, Durmukh, Suptaghn, Yagyakop, Matt and Unmatt; and one beautiful daughter named Analaa.

A Bohemian F.C. legend, he was the last amateur to have been capped for the full Republic of Ireland national team for 43 years until Joseph Lapira was capped against Ecuador in May 2007.  Career  Born in Longford and educated at St. Mels College, Browne began his career at UCD,where, as well as winning numerous international university caps, he was a member of 4 winning Collingwood Cup teams, and after graduating, he signed for then strictly amateur Bohemians in time for the 1961/62 season. A strong central defender, he was made captain of Bohemians in only his 2nd season at the club. He was a born leader, so much so that Bohs broke with their tradition of having a different man captain the team each year and Willie kept the captaincy for 3 seasons in a row. The 1963/64 season was Willie's finest as Bohs reached the semi-final of the FAI Cup and Willie won three full international caps for Ireland. He made his debut away to Austria in a European Nations Cup tie that finished 0‚Äì0. He started left back in a 2‚Äì0 defeat to Spain and earned his third and final cap at Dalymount Park in a 3‚Äì1 defeat to England. In 1963 he was voted Personality of the Year by the Soccer Writers Association of Ireland and was also awarded the Caltex Award for soccer. Se√°n Thomas arrived as manager of Bohs in 1964/65 and turned things around. The perennial strugglers finished third in the league that season with Browne excelling at the back. This was a remarkable achievement for a fully amateur team. Things got better the next season as Bohs once again finished third and ended a 19-year wait for silverware by winning both the LFA President's Cup and the Leinster Senior Cup. This was to be Willie's swansong as he retired from football at the end of the season. He made 177 appearances for Bohs in all competitions scoring 20 goals. Impressively consistent in any defensive position, Browne missed just four league games in his five seasons. A fine tennis player, he won nine men's open singles tennis championship titles at Elm Park and later became a single handicap golfer at the club. Willie Browne died in October 2004 .

He invented Napier's bones or diagram, a tool for nautical navigation. Early life and education James Robert Napier was born in Camlachie, Glasgow in 1821, the son of father Robert Napier, himself a noted shipbuilder. He was educated at the High School of Glasgow, where he was found to excel at mathematics, and graduated from the University of Glasgow. Shipbuilder Napier was placed in charge of his father's shipbuilding business in 1842. In 1848 he married Emma Mary Twentyman, daughter of the silversmith Lawrence Holme Twentyman, and together they had seven children. Napier carried out a series of experiments, measuring errors in compass navigation, and published his findings in 1851. This was called Napier's Diagram, and it was a graphic method of correcting deviation of a ship's compass, which is still referenced in navigation books. Napier worked with the engineer and physicist William Rankine to attempt to improve naval engineering, including patenting an air engine (founded on the thermodynamic principle that temperature difference governs engine efficiency) with him in 1853, but the engine never saw widespread use. In 1853, he was also made a full partner in his father's business, which became R. Napier & Sons. Later career Exhausted from the frantic schedule required to build in 1856 for the British government during the Crimean War, Napier in 1857 left the shipbuilding business he had been running for the previous 15 years and started other, less successful ventures. He started his own shipyard shortly thereafter, but soon closed the business, citing his failing health, and took an interest in the West of Scotland Fishery Company, but this venture too proved unsuccessful. His next was to run one of his iron ships, the \\"Lancefield\\", as a ferry for cargo and passengers between Ardrossan and Belfast. While this business was a moderate success, it led to legal troubles with the Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company. Although Napier won this legal battle, he subsequently sold the \\"Lancefield\\", ending his interest in shipping. After that he worked occasionally on commission as an engineering consultant. In this he helped to design a ship to navigate the Godaveri river in Kaleshwaram, India. Professional memberships Napier was a member of The Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow, the Royal Institution of Naval Architects, and the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and President of The Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland from 1863 to 1865.Institute site He was inducted into the Royal Society of London in 1867. Society site Death James Robert Napier died in Glasgow in December 1879, after contracting an illness while boating on Loch Lomond.
