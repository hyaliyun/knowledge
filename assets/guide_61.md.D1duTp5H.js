The Council stated that Croatia had not complied with the requirements of the Security Council which were made earlier in the month. Concern was expressed about the violations of the arms embargo and regretted that talks in Geneva had been broken off. The importance of a negotiated settlement was stressed in conjunction with mutual recognition of states in the former Yugoslavia. The large-scale offensive that Croatia began against ethnic Serbs on 4 August escalated the conflict and was regrettable. The shelling of civilian targets was again condemned, and it was noted that violations of international humanitarian law had been committed and that the people who fled were in a serious situation. The rights of the local Serb population had to be protected, while violence against the United Nations personnel which resulted in three fatalities was also condemned by the Council. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Security Council demanded that Croatia and cease all military actions immediately and respect the rights of local Serbs, allow access to the region by the International Committee of the Red Cross and humanitarian organisations, permit the return of refugees and displaced persons and respect the status of United Nations personnel, bringing to justice any person responsible for attacks on UNPROFOR. All parties were reminded of their obligations under Resolution 816 (1993) and to aim for a negotiated settlement which guaranteed the rights of all communities in talks under the auspices of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. Finally, the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was required to submit a report to the Council within three weeks of the adoption of the present resolution regarding its implementation and the implications of the situation on the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation.

The score calls for two narrators. The ballet was first performed in Paris in 1921. Background The ballet had its genesis in a commission to Jean Cocteau and Georges Auric, from Rolf de Mar√© of the Ballets su√©dois. Cocteau's original title for his scenario was The Wedding Party Massacre. It has been suggested that Raymond Radiguet, the young writer close to Cocteau at the time, made some contribution to the libretto.NYT, 17 April 1988, Dance View: The Irreverence of Cocteau Sparkles Once More Running short of time, Auric asked his fellow members of Les Six to also contribute music, and all of them did except Louis Durey, who pleaded illness. It was staged by the Ballets su√©dois at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris on 18 June 1921, the principal dancers being C. Ari, J. Figoni, and K. Vahlander. The orchestra was conducted by D√©sir√©-√âmile Inghelbrecht. The narrators were Jean Cocteau and Pierre Bertin.Classics online It had a brief moment of fame and even scandal, but then fell into oblivion, although it was given in New York City in 1923. A new production opened there in 1988. Story The story of the ballet is somewhat nonsensical: : The new couple have a wedding breakfast on Bastille Day (July 14) at a table on one of the platforms of the famous tower. A guest makes a pompous speech. When a humpbacked photographer bids everyone to \\"watch the birdie,\\" it appears that a telegraph office suddenly springs into existence on the platform. A lion comes in and eats one of the guests for breakfast and a strange figure called \\"a child of the future\\" appears and kills everybody. Nevertheless, the ballet concludes with the end of the wedding.Classical Archives When asked what the ballet was about, Cocteau replied: \\"Sunday vacuity; human beastliness, ready-made expressions, disassociation of ideas from flesh and bone, ferocity of childhood, the miraculous poetry of everyday life.\\"Boise Weekly On 29 July 1923, in a letter, Francis Poulenc described the work as \\"toujours de la merde ... hormis l'Ouverture d'Auric\\" (\\"yet more shit ... apart from Auric's Overture\\").Barbara L.

Biography He studied in the city of Horta, in the local lyceum and primary educational institution, but eventually settled in Ponta Delgada after 1949 where he was to marry and begin a family. He completed his courses in teaching in Ponta Delgada, and became a teacher in a preparatory institution before moving on to teach in Cova da Piedade (1976‚Äì1977) and Lajes do Pico (1978‚Äì1979). While in Horta he worked for the regional newspapers, including the regional newspapers O Telegrafo, A√ßores, and Ilha, and the national media Di√°rio de Not√≠cias and Di√°rio de Lisboa; during his time in Horta, with other school colleagues, he helped found the Associa√ß√£o Cultural Acad√©mica (\\"Academic Cultural Association\\") in November, 1944. Literature It was during the 1950s, that he would begin his literary career with his book of poems Todas do Mar e da Terra (\\"Everything in the Sea and Land\\"). His contribution to Portuguese culture, is his thirty published works in various styles: poems, narratives, novels, romances, chronicle, monographs, dissertations and studies in the field of ethnography. He captured in his writings the particular culture of mid-century Azorean life, and in particular the experiences of emigrants, the people involved in whaling, and the culture of the island of Pico. A dominant theme in his works was an empathy, or sympathy, for the socially unprotected, the victims of the powers-that-be, and the uncontrollable forces of nature. The book Pedras Negras (\\"Dark Stones\\"), published for the first time in 1954, and now on its 4th edition, was translated into various languages (including English and Japonese). It is considered his best-selling and most accessible work. Writing of this book, Urbano Bettencourt said: :\\"in Pedras Negras, Dias de Melo represented the island life during the 19th Century, whaling and excitement of emigration to North America, learning of the world within ferous competition, the inhumanity and solitariousness also, the material successes, in the end, porportioned by the loss of abundance.\\" Similarly, Vamberto Freitas, wrote how he \\"registered and/or tranfigured the problematic socio-political and economic situation of the islands, turning them a part of contemporary Portuguese history.\\" The Azorean writer, Crist√≥v√£o de Aguiar affirmed that Dias de Melo \\"remains for posterity, a symbol of the man of the sea...his is a whaler's writer that provided a picture in realtime of the whaler's life...\\" But, Dias de Melo also wrote of life in the Azores from the perspectives of the gentrymen, farmer, fisherman, cattlemen and other social classes. Former President of Portugal, M√°rio Soares, bestowed on him the Order of the Infante for his contribution to literature in Portugal, while the city council of Lajes do Pico awarded him an Honorary Citizenship. Similarly, the President of the Regional Government of the Azores presided over a public session that honoured Dias de Melo, which included a new release of his trilogy Pedras Negras, Mar Rubro and Mar Pela Proa. With over 50 years in literature, he died at the age of 83, in Ponta Delgada on September 24, 2008.

Hulme was born in Swinton in Yorkshire, the son of Jesse Hulme and Elizabeth Trewolla. His mother was a porcelain painter and it was from her that he received his first lessons. He first exhibited in 1841 in Birmingham. Hulme married Caroline Jackson. Their only son, Frederick Edward Hulme, born in March 1841 in Hanley, Staffordshire, became a notable teacher, writer and amateur botanist known for his drawings of flowers.Peter Osborne. Hulme, Frederick Edward (1841‚Äì1909) (Oxford Dictionary of National Biography - Oxford University Press, 2004).

Survey of London: volume 42 - Kensington Square to Earl's Court\\" (English Heritage, 1986) He practiced as a teacher of drawing and painting and, in 1850, published a text book in 4 parts called \\"A Graduated Series of Drawing Copies on Landscape Subjects for Use of Schools\\". He illustrated a number of books including Edgar Allan Poe's Poetical Works of E. A. Poe in 1853, and Samuel Carter Hall's Book of South Wales in 1861. He occasionally worked on pictures in conjunction with other artists, including Henry Brittan Willis. Hulme is known for his landscape paintings of Surrey and Wales - he was a frequent visitor to Bettws-y-Coed in the Conway valley - but he also painted in other areas of the country.Albert Nicholson (rev.

Pont Hoogan Mill Hulme notably exhibited work at the Royal Academy from 1852 to 1884, the British Institution from 1845 to 1862, the Royal Manchester Institution and other smaller galleries.

He was known for his writings as well as for his efforts in assisting Anand to publish his debut novel, Aalkkottam, and in the production of Swayamvaram, the debut movie of Dadasaheb Phalke laureate, Adoor Gopalakrishnan. His body of work comprises short stories, poems, articles and plays. He also wrote the screenplay for Nokkukuthi, a 1983 film by Mankada Ravi Varma.  Biography  M. Govindan was born on September 18, 1919 at Kuradadesham, in Thrikkanapuram, Ponnani, Malappuram district of the south Indian state of Kerala to Kothayath Manakkal Chithran Nampoothiri and Mancherath Thazhathethil Devaki Amma. His schooling was at Higher Elementary School, Kuttippuram, and A.V. High School, Ponnani but had formal education only up to 9th standard. He became a socialist,reading Why Socialism by Jayaprakash Narayan,given to him by the poet Idassery Govindan Nair,but never a Marxist. When his mother remarried Karunakaran Nair, a police official based in Chennai and moved there, Govindan also settled in that city. According to the biography of Govindan,written by his close associate M K Sanoo,Govindan never took part in freedom movement and shifted to Madras only because his mother got married again. In 1944 he joined Madras Information service,shifted to Kerala Information Department alo ngwith his friend A N Nambiar, after states re organization; worked in the information service for 14 years. It was the British rule that recruited him,and the information service was propagating British views on Second world war .He was given a job at the recommendation of P Balasubramanya Mudaliar, Editor of Sunday Observer, mouth piece of the Justice Party. Govindan had embraced the Radical Humanism of erstwhile Marxist M N Roy in 1939; both were against Gandhi and the Quit India movement. His friendship with Roy began when Roy, as Editor of Independent India, published Govindan's article, Caste and Class in South India. Subsequent exchange of letters made Govindan,a disciple of Roy. He had been in active politics prior to that and according to Sanoo, had wrote a couple of articles in leftist magazines such as Thozhilali and Rajyabhamani. C J Thomas met him in 1949, when he went to Madras and made an unsuccessful attempt to study MLitt,and joined the USIS. Their friendship ultimately bloomed in their joint effort against the first elected Communist Government in India,in the infamous liberation struggle,funded by the CIA. Govindan worked against the first Communist government of Kerala during 1957-1959, and exposed the Andhra rice scandal of that government,which was toppled by the CIA, according to the book, A Dangerous Place by Daniel Patrick Moynihan.Govindan organized several pamphlets against the government,one of which was written by Sanoo.In 1959, he resigned from service and concentrated on his intellectual career. He edited three magazines Navasahiti, Gopuram and Sameeksha and organised many academic forums for cultural debate. He spotted and groomed many young writers and artists through his magazines.M.Govindan;Jeevithavum Ashayavum by A.Radhakrishnan He also wrote profusely both in Malayalam and English, but his creative works were largely in Malayalam.Akhilavijnanakosam; D.C.Books; KottayamSahithyakara Directory ; Kerala Sahithya Academy,Thrissur Govindan was married to Dr K C Padmavathy, who was a physician, and niece of artist K C S Paniker. It was a love marriage, both she and Paniker were Royists. She had participated in Guruvayoor temple struggle. She translated William Saroyan's The Human Comedy and six stories of Isaac Bashevis Singer. Govimdan died on January 23, 1989, at the age of 69, in Guruvayur, Kerala.  Legacy  Govindan's works include poems, short stories, plays, and essays. Besides, he wrote the screenplay for Nokkukuthi, a 1983 film by Mankada Ravi Varma, based on one of his own stories. While he was the editor of Sameeksha magazine, Anand wrote to him requesting for assistance for publishing his debut novel, Aalkkottamm and later Anand admitted that Govindan's intervention helped in the publication of the novel. His efforts have also been reported in the production and distribution of Swayamvaram, the debut movie of Adoor Gopalakrishnan.

The film is based on the story of a family whose daughters have been carrying a curse from generation to generation. It also stars Murli Sharma and Nishigandha Wad. This film was shot in Film City and released on 19 March 2010, under the banner of ASA Film Pvt Ltd. Plot The film opens with Aman seemingly lifeless, narrating how he and his sweetheart Kaya are doomed to perish together. He remembers happier times when he met and courted and finally proposed to Kaya. No sooner than he had proposed, they had met with a sudden car accident. They are miraculously unhurt saved with few minor injuries. But when Kaya's parents realise Aman had proposed to her, they become sad and grave, and Kaya's mother earnestly persuades her father to tell them the truth. Kaya's mother reveals the curse upon their family. Kaya's father is a descendant of an ancient royal family. Some 300 years ago, the brother of the late king Rana Ranjit Singh had attempted to molest a beautiful girl in the palace. The girl escaped and jumped to her death. It turned out that the girl was the daughter of the royal guru, \\"Acharya Sachidanand\\", and that the girl was about to be wed. The acharya, a wise and powerful spiritual master, was enraged beyond belief. He pronounced a terrible curse upon Ranjit Singh: no daughter in Ranjit Singh's line shall ever enjoy marriage; if they ever attempt to marry or become engaged, they will immediately meet with death. Aman and Kaya are devastated. They reach out to professor Pashupati, an expert in the occult. The professor explains that generational curses (such as the one upon Kaya) are typically connected with an evil spirit. This spirit is the keeper of the curse, and it executes the curse (by taking the lives of the victims). Aman recollects that the evil spirit had caused their car accident. Aman suggested destroying the spirit. The bemused professor laughs this off and urges Aman to forget Kaya and move on. Aman and his friend Shubh are disappointed. Aman is persistent. He looks up some of the professor's work and retrieves (in a dangerous chase with an evil spirit) a \\"cursed\\" book from the library. Convinced that Aman is determined and capable, the professor agrees to help them. Their first stop is an abandoned cinema. The professor explains that it is haunted by several spirits, and some of the noble spirits may be able to help them locate the evil curse-keeper. Aman and Kaya enter the theatre. They are surrounded by spirits, and one of them splatters a few drops of blood on Kaya's wrists. The professor interprets: the drops are the coordinates of the ancient kingdom of Magha, present-day Mahipalpur. They arrive at Mahipalpur and settle into the decrepit government guest house. The evil spirit is relentless. It attacks Kaya and tries to bury her alive. They save her just in time, but she goes into hypoxic shock. The professor describes a water-immersion method to send Shubh back in time. Shubh is again attacked by the spirit, but this time he returns with an amulet. The amulet reveals the clue that leads them to Rani Mohini, the evil spirit, the keeper of the curse. Aided by the curator of the 300-year-old Magha jail, the professor performs a seance to invoke the spirit of Ranjit Singh. This spirit reveals the sinister history of the royal family. Rani Mohini was never satisfied with her station as the second wife of Raja Gajsingh. She was also a sorceress. She plotted to assassinate the King and his two sons, Rana Ranjeet Singh and Kuljeet. Her assassins killed Raja Gajsingh but were ultimately defeated and killed by the royal guard. Ranjit Singh ascended the throne, and, upon learning of Rani Mohini's dark powers, promptly arranged to execute her. Rani Mohini, however, created a black charm (locked in an amulet) to keep her soul on earth. Upon her execution, her soul became the keeper of the curse (by Acharya Sachidanand) and would torment Ranjit Singh's family forever. Kaya's conditions worsen. She is wheeled into surgery. The professor and Aman and Shubh hurry into the River Palace to confront the evil spirit of Rani Mohini. They connect the clues from the amulet and from Ranjit Singh and deduce that the spirit of Mohini can be dispatched to the nether world when her mortal remains (ashes) are dissolved. Aman & Shubh start searching the ashes with professor's help. They then stumble upon a portrait statue wherein they find 8 earthen pots instead of seven. Shubh & Aman conclude that the ashes are hidden over there. They retrieve the pot but Mohini's spirit kills the professor brutally and chases them to destroy their efforts. After a difficult and lengthy battle with the spirit, Aman floods the River Palace. He nearly drowns (and cuts back to the initial frame), but Shubh saves him just in time. The film ends with Aman narrating how the power of love can overcome any obstacle. At the end of the movie, they got married and blessed with a baby girl.

Track listing=Reception The Times of India rated the film three stars out of five and considered that: \\"The film works not so much due to its story. Rather, it's the way Vikram Bhatt tells his story -- with a certain polish and pizzazz -- that draws you in. Also, it's Pravin Bhatt's multi-hued cinematography which adds a lyrical quality to the film. Not much of a debut however for Shweta Agarwal, who spends much of the screen time in comatose, though Aditya Narain is adequate.\\" The Indian Express gave the film one star out of five and Shubhra Gupta wrote: \\"Practically nothing about \`Shaapit', which has the youngest looking debutant hero after Shahid Kapoor, is scary : not the bag of skeletons which floats around a 300 year old castle, not the wailing and the screeching, and the moaning and the groaning.\\" Mid Day considered: \\"The basic plot of the film seems lost somewhere the curse and the evil spirit are supposed to have a connection but that remains unexplained. It's almost like two separate tracks in the same film and that makes it hard to comprehend\\" and commented \\"The director's scare tactics work big time in the first half the sequence with Aman alone in the library is the most thrilling of the lot. Also, Shaapit is a combination of a love story and a horror flick and it works.\\" Mid Day rated the film two and a half stars out of five. Taran Adarsh writing for Bollywood Hungama commented: \\"With SHAAPIT, Vikram Bhatt raises the bar for horror films made in India. Full marks to Bhatt for making that one kick-ass horror thriller, which easily ranks amongst the best in this genre in terms of plot, setting, technique and performances\\" and ranked the film three and a half stars out of five.

The battle was a Fatimid victory.J. Gordon Melton, 2014, p.256 Background In the 990s, the Byzantine Empire and the Fatimids were involved in a war in Syria, which also involved the Byzantine vassal state of Aleppo, controlled by the Hamdanid dynasty. In 993/994, the Fatimid governor of Damascus, the Turkish general Manjutakin, besieged Apamea, and Bourtzes, the Byzantine doux of Antioch, came forth to relieve the city.

House de la Cerda is a noble line of the Crown of Castile descending from the Infante Ferdinand de la Cerda, eldest son of King Alfonso X. It was one of four noble lineages that arose directly from the Castilian royal family during the thirteenth century and is the origin of the Dukes of Medinaceli. The origin of the lineage stems from Infante Alfonso de la Cerda (1270‚Äì1333), son of the heir to the throne, Infante Ferdinand de la Cerda who died before his father, Alfonso X. The Alfonso X always stated his successor was his grandson Alfonso de la Cerda, instead of his second son, Infante Sancho. This motivated Sancho to revolt against his father. After a long civil war Sancho was finally crowned. Following an unsuccessful invasion by Aragon and Portugal, a peace settlement removed the Infante de la Cerdas from contention for the Castilian throne.Medieval Iberia: An Encyclopedia, Ed. E. Michael Gerli, Samuel G. Armistead, (Taylor and Francis, 2003), 427. The lineage of La Cerda continued throughout the Middle Ages and was constituted as a noble house of the first rank, playing a leading role in Castilian politics. This line, like others from the Civil War of the mid-fourteenth century, continued through the female line to shift the family heritage until Dona Isabel de la Cerda married Bernardo de Bearn, first Count of Medinaceli. Currently, the House of La Cerda branches into several noble families: the House of the Dukes of Medinaceli, as direct heirs of Fernando and Alfonso la Cerda, and its minor Ducal House of Parcent. From the House of Parcent (dukes since 1916) stem the minor noble houses of the Marquissates of Eguaras (in the House of La Cerda since 1799) and of Ca√±ada-Honda (created in 1893 for Emilio Drake De La Cerda, grandson of the Count of Parcent) NotesReferences * Medieval Iberia: An Encyclopedia, Ed.

The camera was Arri's first major transition into digital cinematography after smaller previous efforts such as the Arriflex D-20 and D-21. Alexa cameras are designed for use in high budget feature films, television shows, and commercials. Alexa uses the ALEV series of image sensors manufactured by ON Semiconductor. Overview Arri Alexa camera being used with Master Steadicam The camera has several methods of recording, including SxS cards, CFast 2.0 cards and SXR Capture Drives at resolutions up to 3424 x 2202 pixels in either Rec. 709 or Log-C to ProRes or ARRIRAW codecs. Alexa camera owners can purchase additional software licenses that will unlock different capabilities of the Alexa Camera including High Speed 120fps recording, DNxHD codec and 4:3 \\"Open Gate\\" Mode for anamorphic lenses. It features modularity, PL mount lenses, a Super 35 sized CMOS sensor shooting up to 3424x2202 resolution and supports uncompressed video or proprietary raw (ARRIRAW) data. The price of the camera depends on model and accessories; as an example in 2015 an Arri Alexa XT cost approximately $66,000-100,000, depending on accessories included. Model range The range of Alexa models has expanded over time: Alexa The first camera of the Alexa product family. The ARRI ALEXA‚Äôs CMOS Super-35mm sensor is rated at 2.8K and ISO 800. That sensitivity allows the camera to see a full seven stops of over exposure and another seven stops of underexposure. To take advantage of this, ARRI offers both industry- standard REC709 HD video output as well as the Log-C mode that shows the entire range of the chip‚Äôs sensitivity, allowing for an extreme range of color correction options in post. Alexa Plus (4:3) The ALEXA Plus added integrated wireless remote control, the ARRI Lens Data System (LDS), additional outputs, lens synchronization for 3D, and built-in position and motion sensors and a 4:3 sensor making it ideal for anamorphic cinematography. Alexa M The Alexa M had its imaging and processing unit broken down in two parts to be small, compact and lightweight for 3D rigs and other uses where size is a concern. A special version of the Alexa M, called the Alexa SXT-M, was created for Gemini Man. Alexa Studio The Alexa Studio features an optical viewfinder, mechanical shutter, and a 4:3 sensor for anamorphic cinematography. Alexa XT In February 2013, the range was renewed as Alexa XT (XT standing for extended technology). This range is upgraded versions of the original Alexa cameras, which are equipped with a so- called XR module, which replaces the SxS module on the cameras, and allows direct raw recording without the need for an external recorder. This module records on dedicated SSDs. Further improvements are an internal ND filter unit, a 4:3 sensor, an Open Gate sensor mode, and a quieter cooling fan. The range accordingly comprises the Alexa, the Alexa XT, the Alexa XT M, the Alexa XT Plus, the Alexa XT Studio, and the Alexa Fiber Remote. Existing cameras can be upgraded with the XR module for internal raw recording. Alexa 65 Arri Alexa 65 On 21 September 2014 at the Cinec convention in Munich, Arri announced the Alexa 65, a 6k 65mm digital cinema camera. As with cameras from competitor Panavision, the Alexa 65 camera was available by rental only, provided through the ARRI Rental Group. The Alexa 65 uses the A3X sensor, which has a maximum recordable resolution of 6560x3100.ARRI Rental  ALEXA 65 The first production to use the camera was Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Rogue Nation, which was used to shoot the underwater sequence, and around forty percent of The Revenant.http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/rogue-one- revenant-help-bolster-851170 In May 2015, Marvel Studios announced that Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame will be shot entirely with the brand new camera, marking the first time a narrative feature film was shot entirely with a customized version of the Alexa 65 camera, Alexa IMAX, as the camera had only been used to film specific scenes in Captain America: Civil War.http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/marvels-avengers-infinity-war- be-794031 Alexa Mini Arri Alexa Mini On 24 February 2015, Arri announced the Alexa Mini. It has the same sensor as the other Alexa cameras. It features in-camera recording to CFast 2.0 cards, 200 FPS and 4K UHD in-camera upscaling. Alexa SXT Arri Alexa SXT Plus On 18 March 2015, Arri announced the SXT line of Arri Alexa cameras which will support in-camera upscaling of Apple ProRes to 4K resolution and Rec. 2020 color space. Arri also announced the SXR module which can upgrade XT, XT Plus, and XT Studio cameras with the SXT features. Alexa LF On 2 February 2018, Arri announced the Alexa LF at the BSC Expo. It is a 4K Large Format Camera. The ALEXA LF‚Äôs A2X sensor is based on two vertical ALEV-III sensors, which are stitched together to create a seamless large format image. This is the same principle as that with which they created the ALEXA 65, which uses three Alexa sensors that are arranged vertically. The ALEXA LF can record in Open Gate in a resolution of 4448 x 3096. Alexa Mini LF On 28 March 2019, Arri announced the Alexa Mini LF, which houses the same sensor as the Alexa LF inside a camera body similar to the Alexa Mini. Additional improvements over the Alexa Mini include an improved EVF (MVF-2) with larger flip-out monitor and power outputs for camera accessories. The camera also features a new Codex recording module, which accepts 1TB Codex Compact Drives.https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.newsshooter.com/2019/03/28/arri- alexa-mini-lf-announced/ It was ARRI's top-selling camera prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sensor information Arri Alexa being used on the set of Law & Order: SVU The Alexa's ALEV III image sensor has 3392√ó2200 effective pixels used for generating an image, 2880√ó2160 pixels are generally used for recording on the Alexa Studio and M in 4:3 mode, and 2880√ó1620 pixels are used for recording on the regular Alexa and other models in 16:9 mode, the rest of the sensor is used for lookaround in the viewfinder. Alternately the full sensor resolution may be employed in 'Open Gate' mode for resolution demanding situations. Director Robert Tur with an Alexa-Plus camera equipped with an 18 mm Master Prime lens on the set of SIS The Alexa 65 uses the A3X sensor, which has a 54.12 mm √ó 25.59 mm active imaging area. It provides up to 6560√ó3102 'Open Gate' maximum recordable resolution. The Alexa LF and Alexa Mini LF use the A2X sensor, which has a 36.70mm x 25.54mm active imaging area. It provides up to 4448x3096 maximum recordable resolution. Recording media The Arri Alexa can record to 1920√ó1080 ProRes 422 or ProRes 4444 on SxS Cards or 2880√ó1620 ARRIRAW to external recording devices. The Arri Alexa Firmware 7 increases the resolution on the SxS cards to 2k ProRes 4444 (previously 1080p) ArriRaw ArriRaw is a raw codec similar to CinemaDNG that contains unaltered Bayer sensor information, the data stream from the camera can be recorded via T-link with certified recorders like those from Codex Digital or Cineflow. Reception According to cinematographer Roger Deakins, the Alexa's tonal range, color space and latitude exceed the capabilities of film. \\"This camera has brought us to a point where digital is simply better\\", says Deakins.American Cinematographer: Time Bandit. The ASC. Retrieved 7 June 2012. Deakins used the camera to shoot In Time, the James Bond film Skyfall, Prisoners, Unbroken, Sicario, The Goldfinch and the Academy Award for Best Cinematography winners Blade Runner 2049 and 1917. The Alexa is the dominant camera in the professional film industry, and was used as the primary system on over 70% of the top 100 grossing films since 2016. Since its introduction, seven movies shot on Alexa (Argo, Birdman, Spotlight, Moonlight, The Shape of Water, Green Book and Parasite) won an Academy Award for Best Picture. Also, movies shot on Alexa won Academy Award for Best Cinematography eight times, including five in a row between 2011 and 2015, for Hugo, Life of Pi, Gravity, Birdman, The Revenant, Blade Runner 2049, Roma, and 1917.

It is the third installment of the Gears of War series. Originally due for release on April 8, 2011, the game was delayed and eventually released on September 20, 2011. The story was written by science fiction author Karen Traviss. Like its predecessors, Gears of War 3 received widespread critical acclaim from critics. Critics praised its story, voice acting, graphics and visuals, and music, but criticized its lack of innovation. Gears of War 3 sold over 3 million copies and was the second best selling game in the U.S. A sequel, not developed by Epic Games titled Gears of War 4, was announced in June 2015 and was released on October 11, 2016. Gameplay Like its predecessors, Gears of War 3 is a third-person shooter that emphasizes the use of cover and squad tactics in order to survive combat situations. The player's character can carry four weapons: one pistol, one set of grenades, and two primary weapons. Firearms can be swapped with other weapons dropped by fallen foes or at stockpiles throughout the game, along with ammunition. When the player reloads a weapons ammunition, they have an opportunity for an \\"active reload\\", shown by a small cursor moving over a line with a marked section on the player's heads-up display (HUD). If the player hits a control button when the cursor is in the marked section, they will reload faster with the resulting reload being slightly more powerful than normal bullets, causing more damage to opponents as well as allowing for more \\"knockback\\" meaning that enemies running directly at you will be slowed on shot. If they press the button outside this section, this temporarily jams the weapon, leaving the player vulnerable and taking longer to reload. Alternatively, the player can opt to not try for the active reload, reloading the weapon at normal speed, but with no added damage. A replica of the Digger Launcher at Epic Games' headquarters When in combat, the player can take some damage from enemy fire, filling a blood-colored \\"crimson omen\\" on the HUD as a measure of the player's health, unlike the traditional health bar in other shooters. By staying out of the line of fire, this will dissipate over time, but by taking too much damage, the player will become downed or killed, and must be \\"revived\\" by an ally within a short \\"bleed-out\\" period, or else the player will die, unless playing the game on Insane difficulty in which case a player will die immediately after taking too much damage without the bleed-out. The player can also be killed during the bleed-out by the use of the game's signature execution moves by the enemy. Some types of damage, such as explosives or head shots, can kill the player immediately without the bleed-out period. Similarly, the player can also cause enemies to fall into bleed-out in the same manner. The player and their allies and enemies can use nearly any structure as cover, firing blind from behind it or leaning out to take aimed shots while usually exposing their head more. Players can quickly switch between nearby covering walls or jump over lower cover to rush forward. Within Gears of War 3, some cover can be destroyed after taking some amount of damage, which can be used to a tactical advantage to draw out enemies from cover. New to Gears of War 3 is the ability to tag enemy opponents; computer- controlled allies will then concentrate fire on these marked enemies, while human allies will be alerted to their location on their HUD. Players can now also swap weapons and ammunition (and money during Horde Mode) with other allies in the course of battle. The player maintains an experience level that persists across all game modes. The player earns experience through kills, performing special types of kills and executions, reviving and aiding teammates, and through general process of the campaign or competitive modes. Players can also gain experience points by winning medals and ribbons, which are awarded for defeating enemies with certain weapons or winning several matches. Earning levels unlocks the use of special characters and weapon skins within the game's multiplayer mode. Synopsis=Setting Marcus Fenix and Delta Squad as seen during a four-player campaign co-op mission on board the CNV Sovereign.Gears of War 3 takes place two years after Jacinto, humanity's last stronghold, is destroyed in an effort to completely eradicate the Locust Horde. The Coalition of Ordered Governments (COG) remnants relocate to Vectes, a secluded island, in order to rebuild their civilization. The COG then disbands after Chairman Prescott mysteriously disappears and seemingly abandons his forces. A new foe, the Lambent, are threatening humanity's dwindling numbers. As the Lambent begin to invade Vectes, Marcus Fenix and his comrades retreat to the CNV Sovereign, a helicopter carrier, and take refuge at sea, whilst Hoffman leads other survivors back to the mainland to find haven at Anvil Gate. Delta Squad now consists of Marcus Fenix, Dominic 'Dom' Santiago, Anya Stroud, Damon Baird, Augustus 'Cole Train' Cole, Jace Stratton, Clayton Carmine and Samantha 'Sam' Byrne. Plot Gears of War 3 begins as Chairman Prescott unexpectedly arrives on the Sovereign. Prescott informs Marcus Fenix he needs to relay important information to the ship's senior officer, Captain Michaelson. The Lambent then launch a surprise attack on the ship, which leaves Michaelson dead and Prescott mortally wounded. Before dying, Prescott gives Marcus an encryption to the disc that Colonel Hoffman has and reveals that his father, Adam Fenix, is still alive but captive on Azura, a secret COG base. Marcus, Dom, Cole, and Baird fight their way to the Anvil Gate Fortress, where Hoffman possesses the necessary equipment to decrypt Prescott's disc. Upon arriving at Anvil Gate, Marcus and his comrades assist Hoffman's soldiers in repelling a combined Lambent and Locust assault. Upon further analysis of the disc's content, Marcus learns that Azura is protected by man-made hurricane generators, making the island only accessible by submarine. Marcus and his comrades, joined by old friend Dizzy Wallin, successfully find a submarine but require Imulsion to fuel it. Dom suggests they first venture to an abandoned town called Mercy, where they discover that humans are becoming Lambent. During extraction, the Gears are nearly overrun by Locust and Lambent; Dom sacrifices himself to create an explosion that wipes out the hostile forces. Demoralized, they are forced to continue their search for fuel in the city of Char after their truck runs out of fuel. The ruined city is inhabited by several Stranded civilians who are led by Griffin (voiced by Ice-T). Despite his dislike for the COG and Gears, Griffin reluctantly tasks Marcus to recover a supply of Imulsion. After acquiring the fuel they are attacked by the Locust Horde, led by Queen Myrrah. Griffin's forces sustain heavy casualties in the ensuing battle, but the Gears are ultimately able to escape and reach the shipyards where they have to fight the Locust as they repair and fuel their submarine. Marcus' group finally arrives at Azura, discovering that it is a sanctuary and resort for Sera's most elite and powerful individuals. Adam contacts the Gears and reveals he is being held captive atop Azura's main hotel tower. Marcus's group battles through waves of hostiles before finding his father. Adam quickly explains that he has created a device capable of eradicating all Lambent and Locust life forms on Sera. Adam had worked with Myrrah before to try to tune the wave so that only Lambent would be affected, but with the Imulsion, revealed to be a parasitic lifeform, now infecting humans, Adam ran out of time, infuriating Myrrah. Marcus and his comrades defend Adam from the Locust and Lambent, and from an attack by Myrrah. Adam reveals that he had to infect himself with Lambent cells in order to test his machine. As the machine begins to pulsate with energy, Adam bids his son farewell before the device kills him. Myrrah rises from the rubble and begins insulting Adam. Marcus fatally stabs Myrrah with Dom's commando knife he got back in Mercy. Shortly afterwards, the machine emits a blue wave of energy that sweeps across Sera, destroying the Locust, Lambent, and the Imulsion. The scene transitions back to Marcus, who is mournfully wondering what humanity has left. He is comforted by Anya, who assures Marcus that the sacrifices of Adam, Dom, and their comrades have guaranteed humanity a future. RAAM's Shadow=Synopsis A DLC acting as a secondary single player campaign to Gears of War 3, the player takes control of both General RAAM, the Locust's main General, and Michael Barrick of Zeta- Six from the Gears of War comic series set during the Evacuation of Ilima several years before the first Gears of War game. Other major characters include Lieutenant Minh Young Kim from Gears of War, Tai Kailso from Gears of War 2, new character Alicia Valera and Jace Stratton from the comics and Gears of War 3. The main setting, the COG city of Ilima, previously appeared in Gears of War 2. Plot The surviving COG city of Ilima is besieged by a coming Kryllstorm, a mass of millions of Kryll that will devour everything in their path once the city is dark enough. To speed up the Kryllstorm, Locust General RAAM leads an elite unit throughout Ilima, decimating COG resistance and summoning Seeders to black out the sky faster. Throughout the battle, RAAM is instructed by Queen Myrrah who sees taking Ilima as a stepping stone towards reaching the COG capital city of Ephyra. At the same time, Zeta-Six is assigned to help evacuate Ilima via convoys of APCs, only to have their checkpoint attacked by massive Locust forces. Repelling multiple waves, Zeta ultimately uses the Hammer of Dawn to finish off the attacking Locust and is reassigned to help another squad defending a bank with civilian survivors inside. Zeta fails to save the other Gears and most of the civilians, but discovers a young Jace Stratton holed up inside of the bank's vault. The squad rescues Jace and escorts him to a convoy for evacuation, killing several Seeders and a Brumak to protect the convoy. At Jace's request, Zeta agrees to check out the local high school where Jace believes that there might be more survivors, including his adoptive father Dr. Wisen. Reaching the high school, Zeta finds it to be a COG evacuation center which has been overrun by the Locust, including a Berserker, packs of Wretches and several giant Serapedes. However, they overhear a message from Dr. Wisen directing the survivors of the attack on the school to retreat to his nearby orphanage. Zeta fights their way back outside, managing to kill the Berserker by using several exploding cars in the parking lot. Finding their comms blocked by the Seeders and with time running out, Zeta fights their way to city hall where Barrick uses the mobile command center located there to take control of the Hammer of Dawn and kill the Seeders. With communications restored and less than half an hour left until the city is consumed, Zeta contacts Command who reveals that they are the only COG forces left in the city. As Kim refuses to abandon the survivors at the orphanage, Command agrees to redirect the last APC to meet them there for evacuation. At the orphanage, Zeta discovers several survivors, including Dr. Wisen. As the APC arrives, carrying Jace, General RAAM leads a personal attack on the survivors, killing Alicia Valera and destroying the APC. Jace joins the remaining Gears in fighting off the Locust, though they are quickly cut off from the others. Zeta and Jace fight their way back through the nearby streets and sewers, encountering and killing most of RAAM's elite unit, particularly the elite Theron Guard that had been acting as RAAM's second in command during the battle. Upon their return to the orphanage, the Gears and Jace face off against multiple waves of Locust led by RAAM himself from atop a Reaver and weaponizing the Kryll against them. The group manages to shoot down the Locust General's Reaver, but Barrick is forced to stop the vengeful Kim from making a suicidal attack on the trapped and injured RAAM. Retreating to the roof, the survivors are evacuated by a King Raven helicopter just before the Kryllstorm completely engulfs Ilima. Impressed with Jace, Barrick commends the young man's courage and states that he will make a great Gear in the future. Development=Stereoscopic 3D Gears of War 3 includes a stereoscopic mode for 3DTV sets. It uses TriOviz for Games Technology, which is integrated with Unreal Engine 3, for stereoscopic 3D support. All Gears of War 3 gameplay and cinematics have S3D support, and this extends to split- screen play as well. Multiplayer beta On December 17, 2010, Epic Games confirmed that the Epic Edition of Bulletstorm for the Xbox 360 included early access to the multiplayer beta of Gears of War 3 and access to exclusive content. It was later announced that pre-ordering Gears of War 3 in any edition at GameStop in the United States or GAME in the United Kingdom would grant access to the public beta. The Gears of War 3 exclusive beta began on April 18, 2011, a week before the GameStop pre-order beta which began on April 25, 2011. There was in-game content unlockable exclusively for beta testers that included characters and weapon skins. All players that participated in the beta received a medal to identify themselves as beta testers upon the release of the final game. The beta concluded on May 15, 2011. PlayStation 3 footage In 2017 and later in 2020, footage of Gears of War 3 running on a PlayStation 3 surfaced. The footage was confirmed to be legitimate and appeared to be from a data breach Epic had suffered in 2011, but Kotaku confirmed with Epic Games that the source of the footage was not from an unannounced port of the game to the PlayStation 3, but was from a test of the Unreal Engine. Epic called the software \\"a byproduct of Epic‚Äôs internal Unreal Engine 3 testing process, which utilized both Gears and Unreal Tournament, and was never part of any actual product work for PlayStation 3.\\" Marketing and release According to Tim Sweeney, Gears of War 3 cost between $48,000,000 and $60,000,000 to develop. The game was officially unveiled on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon by Cliff Bleszinski, with a teaser trailer featuring the song \\"Heron Blue\\" by Sun Kil Moon. Prior to the official reveal, an advert for the game was accidentally displayed on the Xbox 360 Dashboard. Retail versions The game was available for pre-order in three retail versions: Standard, Limited, and Epic. The game also has special character variants based on where the game was pre-ordered. Confirmed variants include Mechanic Baird, Commando Dom, Savage Grenadier Elite, and Savage Kantus. On May 23, 2011, Epic Games confirmed that an exclusive replica Retro Lancer designed by NECA will be available exclusively at GameStop, while a gold version of the replica Retro Lancer is also available exclusively at Play.com. * The Standard Edition contains the game, a cut-down manual, and a sheet of Gears of War 3 themed decals. * The Limited Edition contains an Octus Award Box with the Octus Service Medal awarded to Dr. Adam Fenix, exclusive Adam Fenix playable character for multiplayer, fabric COG flag, and the personal effects of Dr. Adam Fenix such as his Last Will and Testament, Hammer of Dawn schematics and Fenix family mementos. * The Epic Edition includes everything from the Limited Edition as well as a Marcus Fenix statue, a 96-page book about the game's art and design, and the Infected Omen Weapon Pack that includes skins for the Lancer, Hammerburst, Retro Lancer, Sawed Off Shotgun and Gnasher Shotgun. * The Gears of War 3 Limited Edition Xbox 360 console included a customized red console with the 'Infected Omen' design, two Special Edition Gears of War 3 wireless controllers, a 320GB hard drive, and two tokens to unlock Adam Fenix and the Infected Omen Weapon Pack. Fate of Carmine voting campaign Clayton Carmine, brother of Anthony and Benjamin, of the previous two games, appears in Gears of War 3. Carmine is more competent, witty, and muscular in the third game, with tattoos of his brothers and the reasons they died on his arms (Keep your head down! and Practice reloading!). He was shown wielding a Mulcher machine gun in several released pictures from the game. A vote was held between July 29, 2010 and September 6, 2010 to determine whether Carmine would live or die based on sales of Xbox avatar T-shirts available for purchase on Xbox Live; Epic had developed endings reflecting either choice prior to the conclusion of the vote. Additionally, actual T-shirts were available from San Diego Comic-Con with all purchases. The voting campaign raised over $150,000, which was all donated to Child's Play. Collaboration with Ice-T Ice-T voices the character of Griffin. It was announced during E3 2011 that Ice-T's band, Body Count, would be reuniting to make a song titled \\"The Gears of War\\", which was featured in the Horde 2.0 trailer. Unlockables Announced via Twitter from Cliff Bleszinski, Gears of War 3 will have unlockables just like Gears of War 2. * On April 1, 2011, Bleszinski announced as an April Fools' joke via Twitter that Gears of War 3 will have a new unlockable weapon in the form of a 6 barrelled shotgun that has a special ability to shoot nukes.

Reception=Critical reception Upon release, Gears of War 3 received critical acclaim, garnering an aggregate score of 91.49% on GameRankings and 91/100 on Metacritic. Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb gave Gears of War 3 a review of 5 out of 5 stars; stating \\"Gears of War 3 is a fantastic follow-up that answers important questions about the nature of the Gears universe while backing it all up with an even bigger, better multiplayer suite.\\" IGN called it \\"the spectacular conclusion to one of the most memorable and celebrated sagas in video games.\\" Game Informer gave it a 9.5/10, saying that \\"Gears 3 is a fantastic idea polished to near perfection by an enormous crew of talented developers and a bottomless budget,\\" with \\"a constantly shuffling deck of threats that encourage players to experiment with new weapons and tactics,\\" \\"hilariously over-the-top set piece moments,\\" and a \\"smart approach to network play.\\" After Eurogamer published an 8/10 review for the game, Epic Games' Cliff Bleszinski reported, saying \\"When people rated [Gears of War 2] higher than [Gears of War 3], it kind of upset me because I know [Gears of 3] is a better game on every level.\\" His comments were criticized by Destructoid and GamePro. In GamePro, McKinley Noble argued that \\"slamming a 'bad' review that's actually pretty favorable does come off as selfish\\". Sales Gears of War 3 received more than one million pre- orders. The game sold more than 3 million copies during its first week‚Äîhigher than the previous two Gears of War entries. It was the second-best selling game only behind Madden NFL 12.

It is the only populated place on the island Population: Municipally, Ayon is subordinated to Chaunsky Municipal District and is incorporated as Ayon Rural Settlement. History=Pre- history Archeological investigations have revealed that the village site has been inhabited from the first millennium AD,Strogoff pp. 110f. with the discovery of tools, arrowheads, antlers and the remains of old Yaranga indicating that the area has been inhabited for centuries by people engaged in reindeer herding. Pre-soviet period The first mention of Aion was in the writings of Isaya Ignatiev, who landed on the island and traded with the locals living there in 1646 and in 1761 Ayon was visited by the merchant Nikita Shalaurov. There were still indigenous settlers on the island when it was first visited by Ferdinand von Wrangel in 1821,History of Ayon, Kalanina, V. mainly Chukchi engaged in traditional reindeer husbandry. Early Russian visitors to the region including explorer Nikita Shalaurov called the island Zavadey ()Information on Ayon village Official Chaunsky District Website and later: Sabodey () by Wrangel, but the island and the village itself was called Ayon from 1875 when the missionary Argentov overheard local Chukchi referring to the area as such, although other sources suggest the date was 1857. The name was initially translated as Marrow Island, although other sources contend that the name is derived from the Chukchi word meaning \\"brain\\", as the island's shape is somewhat like a brain. The local expert on Chukotko- Kamchatkan languages, Pyotr Inenlikey considers that the name derives from the Chukchi word Ayo, meaning revive and that the island is thought of as a place of revival by the indigenous inhabitants.V.V. Leontev and K.A. Novikova, –¢–æ–ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–æ-–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∫–∞ –°–°–°–† (Toponymic Dictionary of the Northeastern USSR) (1989) Magadan. p.58 The abundant pastures present on the island (since it lies within Chukotka's Taiga zone) add weight to this theory, as well as the fact that although the island is covered in ice and snow during the winter, in the summer, this melts and the island provides a good pasture for reindeer herds as well as being the home to swarms of midges and gadflies. Soviet period Following the rise of communism in the Soviet Union in the first part of the twentieth century, the teacher Ignat Toroyev (known as \\"Red Yaranga\\" () came to the island and the native herds were collectivised in 1933 into a group called \\"Enmitagino\\". Such collectivisation was very successful on the island and in 1950, the collective in Ayon was turned into a formal Kolkhoz that would eventually have around 22,000 reindeer under its control. In addition to reindeer herding, the new collective was also engaged in sea- hunting and the collection of furs. A polar station was established on the site of the village in 1941 and the icebreaker Krasin brought Pyotr Sidersky and a crew of seven people to man the new station. This was the first time that the village site had been inhabited permanently, with indigenous people living there only during the summer when the reindeer were taken to pasture, with the exception of a few individuals who would over-winter in order to hunt. By 1944, the settlement had become increasingly permanent and there were 103 people living in 23 houses. Post-Soviet period However, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, state support was withdrawn and the herders, who had been used to being supplied with the latest technology by the state now found that not only did they have to fend for themselves with regards to the day to day herding, but that there was no guarantee that they would even receive the money they were owed for the meat they provided to the state. The previous collective farm of Emmitagino was replaced by a municipal agricultural enterprise called \\"Chaunskoye\\". The result of this is that the herds have shrunk from 22,000 to only around 4,000 which has caused considerable unemployment in the town. This has led to a lot of drinking, which not only has sociological effects, but the litter produced also encourages disease from which the reindeer now suffer, further reducing the size of the herd. Demographics The population according to the 2010 census was 252, of whom 120 were male and 132 female. This represents a slight increase on a January 2009 estimate of 242, though a significant reduction of almost 200 in four years from a 2006 estimate of 440, of which 310 were Chukchi. Although this estimate suggests a significant increase on the 330 people recorded in 2005 in an environmental impact report for the Kupol Gold Project.Bema Gold Corporation, p.87 Economy Reindeer herding is still the dominant economic driver in the village. A new agricultural enterprise has been established since the collapse of the Soviet Union and it still holds the name \\"Enmitagino\\". The herd is reported as having fallen to 2,700, but is now growing. Transport Because the settlement is on an island, it is somewhat difficult to reach. There is no road or bridge linking the island with the mainland. A winter road exists when the bay is frozen, but during spring and summer, the only way to the settlement is by helicopter. There is however, a small network of roads within the village including:Ayon - Chaunsky District Pochtovik Mail Delivery Service * –£–ª–∏—Ü–∞ –ò–Ω–µ–Ω–ª–∏–∫–µ—è (Ulitsa Inenlikeya) * –£–ª–∏—Ü–∞ –û—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–∞—è (Ulitsa Ostrovnaya, lit.

The main towns are Loures-Barousse and Mauleon- Barousse. Toponymy Its name comes from the pre-Latin Gascon language Barro√ßa, which is based on the Basque language root ibar which means 'valley' and on a variant of the toponymic suffix -o√ß. Others have seen its origin in the name of the Ourse river. The Basque language influence is clearly discernible in toponyms such as Ourse, Loures-Barousse, Izaourt, Sarp, Ourde, Esbareich, Sost, etc. Then the Romans left their marks with the names of estates such as Antichan and Samuran which eventually became villages. Finally, one can hear the Gascon language in the names Cr√©chets (small cliff), Bramevaque (mooing cow), Troubat (found?) or Cazarilh (small hamlet). The name of Ilheu is also reminiscent of the valley of Ilh√©ou. Geography=Topography Barousse corresponds mainly to the basin of the Ourse river in the northeast of the Moun N√© () between the valley de la Pique, to the south, and the valley of Nistos to the north. It flows into the valley of the Garonne near Barbazan. The small valley of Siradan, which leads directly to the Garonne from the plateau Cazarilh, is also part of the Barousse since no significant barrier separates it from the main valley. The valley is not a means of communication even if the port Bal√®s (1755 m) can reach the valley of Oueil to the south. Geology About 50,000 to 60,000 years ago the valley was overrun by the glacier of the Garonne as evidenced by impressive glacial deposits. This created a narrowing at mid-valley, resulting in the lock of Troubat. The upper valley is covered with forests, while the central part is made up of grasslands. Within the karst landscape, there exists the gulf of Saoule in which the Ourse of Ferr√®re torrent plunges in cascades. Old quarries extracted limestone (dolomitic) at Th√®be. To the west of mount Sacon, magnesium ore has been extracted to fuel the steel plant of Marignac. The water source of Saint-N√©r√©e, upstream of Ferr√®re, is also subject to commercial exploitation. History The caves of Troubat show traces of early settlements. Excavations have revealed flints, spears, a propeller, spears using antler horns, all dating from 15,000 to 8,000 years ago. Numerous remains of snails have been discovered: snails were consumed by the Pyreneans at the time. In the Middle Ages, Barousse broke way from the Comminges to join the county of Aure and form the country of the Quatre-Vall√©es (\\"Four Valleys\\").

The author of nearly a dozen books in his lifetime, O'Connor is best remembered for his activity in the 1919 Seattle General Strike and as a memoirist about early 20th Century politics in Washington state. Biography=Early years Harvey O'Connor was born March 29, 1898 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of a railway cook.Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole (eds.), The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 176. He attended public school in neighboring St. Paul before relocating with his family to Tacoma, Washington, where he completed high school in 1914. Owing to the death of his father and his mother's need for financial support, O'Connor went to work in various lumber camps as a logger after graduation rather than continuing his education.Harvey O'Connor, Revolution in Seattle: A Memoir. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1964; dust jacket biography. There he joined the Industrial Workers of the World, a radical industrial union espousing the doctrine of syndicalism ‚Äî the overthrow of capitalism in favor of rule by industrially-defined workers organizations. Political career O'Connor was the editor of the left wing Seattle Daily Call during its short-lived existence in 1917 and 1918. Thereafter, he took a position as the editor and business manager of the Farmer-Labor Call of Centralia, Washington. During the 1919 Seattle General Strike which shut down the city for nearly a week during the month of February, O'Connor played a role producing leaflets and agitating on behalf of the strike. His activities caught the attention of the authorities, which subsequently indicted him for criminal anarchy. O'Connor was never brought to trial, however, owing to the loss of a test case by the state on a similar complaint. In 1921, O'Connor went to work as a department editor at the Seattle Union Record, a daily produced by the Seattle labor movement under the editorship of his friend E.B. \\"Harry\\" Ault. He stayed with this paper until 1924. In 1924, O'Connor left the Union Record to move to Cleveland, Ohio to take a position as assistant editor of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers' Journal, the monthly magazine of the BLE. O'Connor next went to New York City in 1927 to head the New York bureau of the Federated Press, a left wing press agency which supplied material to newspapers of the labor movement and left wing political organizations around the country. He remained in this position until 1930. When he joined the newspaper, Whittaker Chambers later realized that \\"Harvey O'Connor was then effective editor of the Daily Worker.\\" Later years In later years, O'Connor was a professional author, writing a number of non-fiction books accentuating the lifestyles of the rich and powerful and the difficult situation of the working class for commercial publishers. Some of his publications include Mellon's Millions, The Astors, The Guggenheims, History of the Oil Workers International, and The Empire of Oil. O'Connor remained politically active throughout his life, serving as chairman of the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee from 1954 to 1963 and as chairman of the National Committee to Abolish the House Un- American Activities Committee in 1964. In 1964, O'Connor published his memoirs, regarded by historians as an important work detailing the history of the radical movement of Washington state during the first decades of the 20th Century. Personal and death O'Connor married Jessie Lloyd O'Connor, a fellow journalist and social activist, born in Winnetka, Illinois on February 14, 1904, and granddaughter of Henry Demarest Lloyd (1847‚Äì1903), a 19th- century American progressive political activist and pioneer muckraking journalist.

She had originally been ordered as one of a two ship class, with her sister , under the name HMS Audacious. She was renamed on 18 November 1847 in honour of James Watt, the purported inventor of the steam engine. (The steam engine was actually invented by Thomas Newcomen.) She was the only Royal Navy ship to bear this name. Both ships were reordered as screw propelled ships, James Watt in 1849, and Cressy in 1852. James Watt became one of the four-ship Agamemnon-class of ships of the line. They were initially planned as 80-gun ships, but the first two ships built to the design, and James Watt, were rerated on 26 March 1851 to 91 guns ships, later followed by the remainder of the class. The ship had an overall length of 265 feet 3 inches, length between perpendiculars of 230 feet, and beam of 55 feet 5 inches. Her displacement was 3083 tons and her screw was driven by a 600 hp engine.David James, Down the Slipway!

She served in the Baltic campaigns of 1854 and 1855, despite the poor performance of the ship, and the dissatisfaction of Vice-Admiral Charles Napier. Her machinery, taken second hand from the iron frigate , was found to be unsatisfactory.

It consisted of the √Ñmter of Gifhorn, Fallersleben and Isenhagen Abbey.  Foundation  Statue of the praying Duke Francis in the castle chapel at Gifhorn The duchy was founded when Duke Francis of Brunswick-L√ºneburg returned in 1536 after many years at the court of the Electorate of Saxony in Wittenberg. He demanded from his older brother, Duke Ernest of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (known as the Confessor due to his espousal of Lutheran doctrine), to have his own duchy as an inheritance and pressed for a division of the state. Because his demands for the entire eastern half of the dukedom were unacceptable, not least due to the serious debt carried by the state, he was given the √Ñmter of Gifhorn, Fallersleben and Isenhagen Abbey, near Hankensb√ºttel, in 1539. Although Francis tried to achieve full sovereignty for his domain, considerable regalia remained with the ducal house in Celle. For example, Celle was responsible for the foreign policy issues and the Gifhorn nobility remained part of the L√ºneburg estate.  Expansion  The Duchy of Gifhorn was a small, easily managed lordship, in which Duke Francis could indulge freely in his noble image of himself and attend to his princely representational duties. He had been impressed by such a lifestyle during his many years at the court of the Saxon Elector in Wittenberg. In 1525 he started to expand Gifhorn Castle into his royal Residenz. Courtly life was characterised by the ostentation of great princely courts; he served food and drink in expensive Venetian glasses, arranged knightly tournaments and royal hunts, employed a court jester and a court chancellor (Hofkanzler). At the same time he built Fallersleben Castle as his rural estate.  End  His marriage in 1547 to Clara of Saxe-Lauenburg at Ratzeburg only lasted three years because the duke died at the age of 41 from a wound infection. He was interred in the chapel at Gifhorn Castle, where there is still a carved tomb figure on his sarcophagus. His wife, the Duchess Clara, was given Fallersleben Castle as her dowager home as compensation. Because Duke Francis left no male heir, the Duchy of Gifhorn went back to the Principality of L√ºneburg.

Early life  Summers-Smith was raised in Glasgow, where he was born in 1920. He spent childhood holidays in County Donegal, in northwestern Ireland, where one of his uncles, a country parson and a naturalist, taught him about birds. For nearly six years of World War II, Summers-Smith was an intelligence officer in the British Army. He received his commission in 1940, and reached the rank of captain. He served with the 9th Battalion, The Cameronians, stationed on the east coast of England. During that time he had little time for birdwatching, except when surveying \\"such likely spots for invasion\\" as coastal marshes in Suffolk. Summers-Smith was among the second wave of troops involved in the D-Day landings of 6 June 1944. He was badly wounded in a later action in Normandy, as a result of which he spent 18 months in hospital.  Career  After the war, Summers-Smith was employed as a mechanical engineer by Imperial Chemical Industries. He obtained several degrees in engineering around this time, and a PhD in physics in 1953. In 1975, Summers-Smith received one of the three annual Tribology Silver Medals given by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. His job as an engineer allowed him to travel widely, and he used trips abroad as opportunities to study sparrows.  Ornithology  Summers-Smith began his study of the house sparrow in 1947. He decided to make a serious study of a particular bird species, and chose the house sparrow because of the difficulty of travel at the time, under post-war rationing. Summers-Smith has studied the house sparrow in Highclere, Hampshire; in Hartburn, County Durham; and latterly at Guisborough in North Yorkshire, where he settled in 1961. During these studies, he was questioned by a policeman on the street twice for looking around yards with binoculars at early hours. Summers-Smith was a founding member of his local bird club (The Teesmouth Bird Club) in 1960, and he wrote the instructions for the British Trust for Ornithology's first Common Bird Census in 1962. His study of the house sparrow resulted not only in a number of papers in respected journals, but also in his 1963 monograph The House Sparrow, published as part of the New Naturalist Monographs series. After The House Sparrow was published, Summers-Smith began studying the house sparrow's relatives in the genus Passer. Over the course of these studies, he visited dozens of countries, and made observations on all the Passer species (recognised in his classification) except the Socotra sparrow. This research into the sparrows as a whole resulted in a monograph on the genus Passer, published in 1988 as The Sparrows, and one on the Eurasian tree sparrow, the 1995 The Tree Sparrow, both of which were illustrated by Robert Gillmor. He also wrote In Search of Sparrows, an account of his worldwide travels researching sparrows. In 1992, Summers-Smith received the Zoological Society of London's Stamford Raffles Award, for his \\"world-renowned work on sparrows\\". In The House Sparrow, Summers-Smith predicted that the house sparrow would have \\"a bright future\\", but instead it went into a severe decline in many parts of the world, beginning in the 1970s. Summers-Smith studied this decline extensively, but he called it \\"one of the most remarkable wildlife mysteries of the last fifty years\\". When The Independent offered a ¬£5,000 prize for an explanation of the decline of the house sparrow in 2000, Summers-Smith acted as a referee. In 2008, the prize was almost awarded to Dr. Kate Vincent of De Montfort University and several colleagues, who attributed the decline of the house sparrow to falling insect numbers. In 2009, Summers-Smith was the author of the section of the Handbook of the Birds of the World on the family Passeridae.

It provides engineer support to 16 Air Assault Brigade in both the parachute and air assault role. The regiment is currently based at Rock Barracks in Suffolk and consists of three regular squadrons and one Army Reserve squadron. As part of 16 Air Assault Brigade it can be called upon to deploy on operations across the globe at extremely short notice. History 23 Engineer Regiment can trace its roots to the founding of the airborne forces of the Parachute Regiment and other related during World War II. In July 1948, 23rd Field Engineer Regiment was formed in Iserlohn from the former 2nd Division Divisional Engineer regiment. In December 1948, the regiment moved to Halen and two years later moved to Dortmund. In September of 1957, 2 Field Squadron was allocated to 6th Infantry Brigade and 5 Field Squadron to the 5th Infantry Brigade. In May of 1958, the regiment was split and its headquarters became the new \\"Headquarters Royal Engineers, 2nd Division\\". Eleven years later in April of 1969, it was re-organised into the new 23 Engineer Regiment at Osnabruck. The regiment served as infantry in Northern Ireland from March - July of 1972. In September of 1976 the 2nd Division was re-organized as the new 2nd Armoured Division, and the regiment was broken up for the second time. In January 1983 at Osnabruck the regiment reformed and part of the regiment, 73 Field and 39 Field Support Squadrons, participated in the Gulf War. The regiment was later disbanded in 1992 as a result of the Options for Change. In 2001, 23 Engineer Regiment was tasked to provide engineer support to the newly formed 16 Air Assault Brigade.

Personal life Stevie Hoang was born in Birmingham, England. He moved to London with his parents when he was one year old. Since Hoang's surname is a typical Vietnamese spelling of a Chinese name (Huang ÈªÑ), many of his fans assume that he is of Vietnamese descent.

GLOBE's objective is to support political leadership on issues of climate and energy security, land-use change and ecosystems. Internationally, GLOBE is focused on leadership from G20 leaders and the leaders of the emerging economies as well as formal negotiations within the United Nations. GLOBE shadows the formal G8 negotiations and allows legislators to work together outside the formal international negotiations. Without the burden of formal governmental negotiating positions, legislators have the freedom to push the boundaries of what can be politically achieved. At an international level GLOBE consists of senior cross-party members of parliament from the 16 major economies - the G8 countries, European Parliament, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa and South Korea. Also, GLOBE facilitates regional policy dialogues amongst legislators. GLOBE believes that legislators have a critical role to play in holding their own governments to account for the commitments that are made during international negotiations. History Since 2005 and following the invitation of the former UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, GLOBE has brought together one hundred legislators from all major political parties within the parliaments of the G8, European Parliament, Brazil, China, India, Mexico & South Africa. GLOBE has convened this group twice a year in a series of focussed policy dialogues held in the US Senate, German Bundestag (2007), Brazilian Senate, Japanese Diet, Mexican Congress (2008) UK House of Commons, Italian Chamber of Deputies, and most recently in the Danish Parliament, the Folketing (2009). The dialogues have included participation by President [Luis Inacio Lula] of Brazil, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, then Prime Minister Tony Blair of the UK, then Prime Ministers Fukuda, and Abe of Japan and the Danish Prime Minister Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen. In addition, both 2008 U.S. Presidential candidates addressed the GLOBE Forum in Tokyo on 28 June 2008. During COP15 in Copenhagen in December 2009, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown presented Mexican President Calderon with the GLOBE Award for International Leadership on the MONKEY. Between the two annual meetings smaller groups of legislators have been convened in working groups and most recently in two International Commissions on Climate & Energy Security chaired by US Congressman Ed Markey, and on Land Use Change & Ecosystems chaired by former World Bank Vice President, Mr Ian Johnson. Members GLOBE has legislative members in all of the 16 major economies that have national GLOBE chapters. At a regional level, they also have members in all European Member states and within several African and Latin American trees GLOBE‚Äôs International Commissions GLOBE International supports two International Commissions on Climate and Energy Security; and Land Use Change and Ecosystems. International Commission on Climate & Energy Security GLOBE‚Äôs International Commission on Climate & Energy Security was launched in the US Congress in Washington DC on 30 March 2009. This Commission comprises senior legislators from each of the major economies. The Commission met for two days under the Chairmanship of US Congressman Ed Markey and Lord Michael Jay of the UK House of Lords. The Commission was launched with the support of the Danish Prime Minister, the UK Prime Minister and the Italian G8 Presidency. The aim of the Commission was to produce a major report to the GLOBE Copenhagen Forum in October 2009, and to present its conclusions to the Danish Prime Minister and the major economies. GLOBE national chapters advanced these recommendations. The commission's report was adopted by the GLOBE Copenhagen Legislators Forum and submitted to the UNFCCC and leaders of the major economies ahead of COP15. International Commission on Land Use Change and Ecosystems GLOBE‚Äôs International Commission on Land Use Change and Ecosystems was initially announced in June 2008 by the British Foreign Secretary, Rt. Hon [David Miliband] MP, and the Chief Scientist to the Japanese Cabinet, Dr Kiyoshi Kurokawa, and formally supported by the G8+5 Legislators Forum of one hundred senior legislators. With the support of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the Commission was launched in November 2008 in the Mexican Congress. The Chairman of the International Commission is Mr Ian Johnson, former Vice President for Sustainable Development at the World Bank, and the political co- chairs are Barry Gardiner MP (UK) and Senator Renato Casagrande (Brazil). In 2005, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) concluded that human activity is rapidly and extensively degrading ecosystem services in order to meet growing demands for food, fresh water, timber, fibre and fuel. Extensive land use change and ecosystem transformation have contributed considerably to economic development. However, these gains have also created barriers to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and significantly depleted the Earth‚Äôs natural capital. The International Commission on Land Use Change & Ecosystems was established in order to initiate a step change in the way that policy makers value the ecosystems that are being degraded at a rapid rate. The International Commission on Land Use Change & Ecosystems has three main work streams: Forest policy, Marine environment policy and Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Policy. =Forestry Policy= The International Commission met twice during 2009 to develop a policy framework to address tropical deforestation, first in July at UNEP Headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, and then in the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh, USA, in September. The Commission, consisting of 20 legislators from both developed countries and rain forest nations along with a panel of expert economists and scientists, agreed to a set of ‚ÄúForestry Policy Proposals‚Äù that included recommendations on how to reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) as part of the post-2012 climate change agreement and measures to prevent illegal logging and to address the demand-side drivers of deforestation. These policy proposals were endorsed by the GLOBE Copenhagen Forum in October 2009. =Marine Environment Policy= The International Commission aims to coordinate simultaneous parliamentary debates on the marine environment in the major economies of the world on World Oceans Day, 8 June 2010. Prior to this event, the International Commission, consisting of 20 legislators from the major fishing nations and an expert panel of marine scientists and economists, convened in US Congress in April 2010. At this meeting, the International Commission developed a ‚ÄúMarine Ecosystem Recovery Plan‚Äù, outlining the policy framework that is necessary to set the oceans on a path to a sustainable future. =Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Policy= GLOBE‚Äôs Programme on Ecosystems Services and Biodiversity aims to mainstream biodiversity and ecosystem services within the world‚Äôs parliaments by a creating an international leadership group of parliamentarians from the finance or audit committees of a select group of countries. By developing a common framework for economic and environmental information, GLOBE believes that governments will be able to more accurately gauge the contribution of the environment to the economy and the impact of the economy on the environment. Statements and reports GLOBE International concludes each Forum with a consensus statement agreed by all the legislators attending, which is submitted to leaders of the major economies. GLOBE also produces a number of policy papers and reports to support its work. The International Commissions on Climate and Energy Security; and Land Use Change and Ecosystems produce a number of reports and background documents to support their work.

The film starred Elsie Ferguson (in her next to last silent) and David Powell. William Powell has a small supporting part in this which was his third film. The film is based on the play of the same name by Hubert Henry Davies and had been performed on Broadway in 1914 with Ferguson in the lead. The story was filmed in 1916 as The World and the Woman with Jeanne Eagels, afterwards as Outcast with Ann Murdock. After Ferguson's version it was filmed as Outcast with Corinne Griffith and Edmund Lowe in a Vitaphone version in 1928, and finally was the basis of The Girl From 10th Avenue (1935) starring Bette Davis and released by Warner Brothers.The AFI Catalog of Feature Films 1893-1993:Outcast Plot As described in a film publication, Valentine Moreland (MacLaren) has married her husband for money and jilted Geoffrey Sherwood (Powell). He feels her rejection keenly, and his friend Tony Hewlitt (David) finds Geoffrey alone in his apartment drinking. Miriam, abandoned by her husband and whose child had died from neglect, has been forced out on the street when her room's rent becomes overdue. Tony sprays some soda water out the window and hits Miriam. Miriam is invited in and Tony offers to compensate her for her hat. She tells Geoffrey her story, and he sees that he is no worse off than other people. Miriam works with Geoffrey in his South American business and he helps her get an apartment. She loves him and tries to win his affection, but he is held back by his memory of Valentine. Valentine has become weary of her elderly husband and seeks Geoffrey at his apartment. Miriam arrives and, seeing that Geoffrey is infatuated with Valentine, resolves to leave. Valentine glances out the window and, seeing her husband John (Wellesley) entering the house, panics. Miriam hides Geoffrey and Valentine in the next room, and, when John comes in, convinces him that she is Geoffrey's mistress and the only woman there. After John leaves, Valentine decides to rejoin her husband. Miriam leaves and, after sending a letter to Geoffrey indicating an intent to kill herself, leaves on a boat for South America. Geoffrey pursues her in a seaplane and rescues her when she jumps of the ship. They are married and honeymoon in Rio.

ace credited with twelve aerial victories. He was the sole American winner of the British Distinguished Service Order. Early life Clive Wilson Warman was born on 30 June 1892 in Norfolk, Virginia. World War I Warman was a civil engineer before World War I. He enlisted in the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry in Canada on 5 September 1914. They sailed for England in January 1915. Warman's duty with them took him through the Second Battle of Ypres, where he was wounded. After recovery, he was involved in suppressing the Easter Rebellion in Ireland. He then transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in summer 1916. He was so skillful that when he finished pilot training, they temporarily retained him as an instructor. Not until June 1917 was he assigned to a combat squadron, No. 23, to fly a Spad VII. He began his victory string on 6 July 1917. He became a balloon buster and an ace on 9 August 1917, when he destroyed a German observation balloon. He scored double victories on 12 and 15 August. On 16 August, his guns jammed mid-fight with three Germans; in frustration, Warman fired his Very flares at his German opponents; he finally flung a wooden mallet at them. Despite his gun jams, he destroyed a German two-seater and a second observation balloon that day. Two days later, he scored his final win. His final tally was two observation balloons destroyed, two enemy planes driven down out of control, and eight destroyed; one of the latter was shared with Conn Standish O'Grady. On 22 August 1917, Warman was forced down and wounded in combat. He was under medical care until mid-1918; subsequently, he was assigned to the War Ministry in London for the rest of the war. Postwar Postwar, he became a flight commander in the new No. 1 Canadian Squadron. He was injured in a crash on 8 May 1919, and died of his wounds on 12 May 1919. Honors and awards Distinguished Service Order (DSO) 2nd Lt. Clive Wilson Warman, M.C., Gen. List and R.F.C. For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. During two days, whilst operating under very difficult conditions in high wind and against strong hostile opposition, he destroyed three enemy machines and a balloon. He displayed the greatest dash and fearlessness in attacking an enemy aerodrome, and on one occasion, when separated from his patrol, and surrounded by 20 hostile machines, he fought his way through, although his machine gun was useless, by attacking them with his \\"Very\\" pistol; eventually regaining his own aerodrome with his machine much shot about. His wonderful coolness and courage have on all occasions been beyond praise.Supplement to the London Gazette, 9 January 1918. Issue 30466, p. 568 Military Cross (MC) T./2nd Lt.

Elementary Definition The discrete Chebyshev polynomial t^N_n(x) is a polynomial of degree n in x, for n = 0, 1, 2,\\\\ldots, N -1, constructed such that two polynomials of unequal degree are orthogonal with respect to the weight function : w(x) = \\\\sum_{r = 0}^{N-1} \\\\delta(x-r) with \\\\delta(\\\\cdot) being the Dirac delta function. That is, : \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} t^N_n(x) t^N_m (x) w(x) = 0 \\\\quad {\\\\rm if\\\\ }\\\\quad n e m . The integral on the left is actually a sum because of the delta function, and we have, : \\\\sum_{r = 0}^{N-1} t^N_n(r) t^N_m (r) = 0 \\\\quad {\\\\rm if\\\\ }\\\\quad n e m. Thus, even though t^N_n(x) is a polynomial in x, only its values at a discrete set of points, x = 0, 1, 2, \\\\ldots, N-1 are of any significance. Nevertheless, because these polynomials can be defined in terms of orthogonality with respect to a nonnegative weight function, the entire theory of orthogonal polynomials is applicable. In particular, the polynomials are complete in the sense that : \\\\sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} t^N_n(r) t^N_n (s) = 0 \\\\quad {\\\\rm if\\\\ }\\\\quad r e s. Chebyshev chose the normalization so that : \\\\sum_{r = 0}^{N-1} t^N_n(r) t^N_n (r) = \\\\frac{N}{2n+1} \\\\prod_{k=1}^n (N^2 - k^2). This fixes the polynomials completely along with the sign convention, t^N_n(N - 1) > 0.

The project is being led by Russian scientists Sergey Zimov and Nikita Zimov, testing the hypothesis that repopulating with large herbivores (and predators) can restore rich grasslands ecosystems, as expected if overhunting, and not climate change, was primarily responsible for the extinction of wildlife and the disappearance of the grasslands at the end of the Pleistocene epoch. The aim of the project is to research the climatic effects of the expected changes in the ecosystem. Here the hypothesis is that the change from tundra to grassland will result in a raised ratio of energy emission to energy absorption of the area, leading to less thawing of permafrost and thereby less emission of greenhouse gases. It is also thought that removal of snow by large herbivores will further reduce the permafrost's insulation. To study this, large herbivores have been released, and their effect on the local fauna is being monitored. Preliminary results point at the ecologically low-grade tundra biome being converted into a productive grassland biome and at the energy emission of the area being raised.  Goals = Researching the effects of large herbivores on the arctic tundra/grasslands ecosystem  The primary aim of Pleistocene Park is to recreate the mammoth steppe (ancient taiga/tundra grasslands that were widespread in the region during the last ice age). The key concept is that animals, rather than climate, maintained that ecosystem. Reintroducing large herbivores to Siberia would then initiate a positive feedback loop promoting the reestablishment of grassland ecosystems. This argument is the basis for rewilding Pleistocene Park's landscape with megafauna that were previously abundant in the area, as evidenced by the fossil record. The grassland-steppe ecosystem that dominated Siberia during the Pleistocene disappeared 10,000 years ago and was replaced by a mossy and forested tundra and taiga ecosystem. Concurrently, most of the large herbivores that roamed Siberia during the Pleistocene have vanished from the region. The mainstream explanation for this used to be that at the beginning of the Holocene the arid steppe climate changed into a humid one, and when the steppe vanished so did the steppe's animals. Sergei Zimov points out that in contradiction to this scenario: * Similar climatic shifts occurred in previous interglacial periods without causing such massive environmental changes, * Those large herbivores of the former steppe that survived until today (e.g. musk oxen, bison, horses) thrive in humid environments just as well as in arid ones, * The climate (both temperatures and humidity) in today's northern Siberia is in fact similar to that of the mammoth steppe. The radiation aridity index for northern Siberia on Mikhail Budyko's scale is 2 (= steppe bordering on semi-desert). Budyko's scale compares the ratio of the energy received by the earth's surface to the energy required for the evaporation of the total annual precipitation. The 'humid climate' argument was based on other scales, which compare precipitation to potential evapotranspiration. Moss has a very low transpiration rate and thus causes humidity without necessarily needing humidity for its establishment. Using these other scales as a proof for humidity being the cause of the disappearance of the grasslands therefore constitutes a circular argument, which is not scientifically viable. Zimov and colleagues argue for a reversed order of environmental change in the mammoth steppe. Humans, with their constantly improving technology, overhunted the large herbivores and led to their extinction and extirpation. Without herbivores grazing and trampling over the land, mosses, shrubs and trees were able to take over and replace the grassland ecosystem. If the grasslands were destroyed because herbivore populations were decimated by human hunting, then \\"it stands to reason that those landscapes can be reconstituted by the judicious return of appropriate herbivore communities.\\"  Researching the effects of large herbivores on permafrost and global warming  A secondary aim is to research the climatic effects of the expected changes in the ecosystem. Here the key concept is that some of the effects of the large herbivores, such as eradicating trees and shrubs or trampling snow, will result in a stronger cooling of the ground in the winter, leading to less thawing of permafrost during summer and thereby less emission of greenhouse gases. Permafrost is a large global carbon reservoir that has remained frozen throughout much of the Holocene. Due to recent climate change, the permafrost is beginning to thaw, releasing stored carbon and forming thermokarst lakes. When the thawed permafrost enters the thermokarst lakes, its carbon is converted into carbon dioxide and methane and released into the atmosphere. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and the methane emissions from thermokarst lakes have the potential to initiate a positive feedback cycle in which increased atmospheric methane concentrations lead to amplified global climate change, which in turn leads to more permafrost thaw and more methane and carbon dioxide emissions. As the combined carbon stored in the world's permafrost (1670 Gt) equals about two times the amount of the carbon currently released in the atmosphere (720 Gt), the setting in motion of such a positive feedback cycle could potentially lead to runaway climate change scenario. Even if the ecological situation of the arctic were as it was 400,000 years ago (i.e., grasslands instead of tundra), a global temperature rise of 1.5 ¬∞C (2.7 ¬∞F) relative to the pre-industrial level would be enough to start the thawing of permafrost in Siberia. An increased cooling of the ground during winter would raise the current tipping point, potentially delaying such a scenario.

It has been proposed that the introduction of a variety of large herbivores will recreate their ancient ecological niches in Siberia and regenerate the Pleistocene terrain with its different ecological habitats such as taiga, tundra, steppe and alpine terrain. The main objective, however, is to recreate the extensive grasslands that covered the Beringia region in the late Pleistocene. This form of grassland (also known as mammoth steppe) was inhabited by a diverse set of large and medium herbivores. Back in the Pleistocene the area was populated by many species of grazers that assembled in large herds similar in size to those in Africa and Asia today. Species that roamed the great grasslands included the woolly mammoth, woolly rhino, steppe wisent, Lena horse, muskox, and reindeer. Another herbivore that was abundant in this region during the Pleistocene but now faces possible extinction in its remaining habitats is the saiga antelope, which can form massive herds that keep the vegetation down. At the edges of these large stretches of grassland could be found more shrub-like terrain and dry conifer forests (similar to taiga). In this terrain the browsers of the Pleistocene were to be found. This group of megafauna included woolly rhinoceros, moose, wapiti, Yukon wild ass, and camels. The more mountainous terrain was occupied by several species of mountain-going animals like the snow sheep. Back in the Pleistocene there was also a great variety of carnivorous mammals as well. On the plains there were prides of Beringian cave lion. These large cats were the apex predators of the region, but also shared their habitat with other predators such as grey wolf, cave hyena, Homotherium, brown bear, wolverine, and Arctic fox, which all occupied a distinct ecological niche essential for the balance of their respective ecosystems. On the edges of the grasslands (in the shrubs and forests) there were also brown bears, wolverines, cave bears, lynxes, tigers, leopards, and red foxes. The Siberian tiger and Amur leopard occupied the southern part of the steppe biome and surviving populations are still found along the present Russian-Sino border in the Amur and Primorye regions.  Proposed procedure  In present-day Siberia only a few of the former species of megafauna are left, and their population density is extremely low, too low to affect the environment. To reach the desired effects, the density has to be raised artificially by fencing in and concentrating the existing large herbivores. A large variety of species is important as each species affects the environment differently and as the overall stability of the ecosystem increases with the variety of species (compare Biodiversity#Biodiversity and ecological services). Their numbers will be raised by reintroducing species that went locally extinct (e.g., muskoxen). For species that went completely extinct, suitable replacements will be introduced if possible (e.g., wild Bactrian camels for the extinct Pleistocene camels of the genus Paracamelus). As the number of herbivores increases, the enclosure will be expanded. While this is taking place, the effects will be monitored. This concerns for example the effects on the flora (are the mosses being replaced by grasses, etc.), the effects on the atmosphere (changes in levels of methane, carbon dioxide, water vapor) and the effects on the permafrost. Finally, once a high density of herbivores over a vast area has been reached, predators larger than the wolves will have to be introduced to keep the megafauna in check.  Progress and plans  ;1988‚Äì1996: The first grazing experiments began in 1988 at the Northeast Science Station in Chersky with Yakutian horses. ;1996‚Äì2004: In 1996 a 50 ha (125 acre) enclosure was built in Pleistocene Park. As a first step in recreating the ancient landscape, the Yakutian horses were introduced, as horses had been the most abundant ungulates on the northeastern Siberian mammoth steppe. Of the first 40 horses, 15 were killed by predators and 12 died of eating poisonous plants. More horses were imported, and they learned to cope with the environment. In 2006 approximately 20 horses lived in the park, and by 2007 more horses were being born annually than died. By 2013, the number had risen to about 30. Moose, present in the area, were also introduced. The effects of large animals (mammoths and wisents) on nature were artificially created by using an engineering tank and an 8-wheel drive Argo all-terrain vehicle to crush pathways through the willow shrub. Restored grasslands in Pleistocene ParkThe vegetation in the park started to change. In the areas where the horses grazed, the soil has been compacted and mosses, weeds and willow shrub were replaced by grasses. Flat grassland is now the dominating landscape inside the park. The permafrost was also influenced by the grazers. When air temperature sank to ‚Äì40 ¬∞C (‚Äì40 ¬∞F) in winter, the temperature of the ground was found to be only ‚Äì5 ¬∞C (+23 ¬∞F) under an intact cover of snow, but ‚Äì30 ¬∞C (‚Äì22 ¬∞F) where the animals had trampled down the snow. The grazers thus help keep permafrost intact, thereby lessening the amount of methane released by the tundra. ;2004‚Äì2011: In the years 2004‚Äì2005 a new fence was erected, creating an enclosure of 16 km2 (6 sq mi). The new enclosure finally allowed a more rapid development of the project. After the fence was completed, reindeer were brought into the park from herds in the region and are now the most numerous ungulates in the park. To increase moose density in the park, special constructions were added to the fence in several places that allow animals outside the fenced area to enter the park, while not allowing them to leave. Besides that, wild moose calves were caught in other regions and transported to the park. In 2007 a 32-meter (105-foot) high tower was erected in the park that constantly monitors the levels of methane, carbon dioxide and water vapor in the park's atmosphere. In September 2010 the muskox was reintroduced. Six male animals were imported from Wrangel Island, two of which died in the first months, one from infighting from others of their kind, the other for unknown causes. Seven months later, in April 2011, six Altai wapitis and five wisents arrived at the park, the wapitis originating from the Altai mountains and the wisents from Prioksko-Terrasny Nature Reserve near Moscow. But the enclosing fence proved too low for the wapitis, and by the end of 2012 all six wapitis had jumped the fence and run off. ;2011‚Äì2016: In the years 2011 to 2016 progress slowed down as most energy was put into the construction of a 150 ha (370 ac) branch of Pleistocene Park near the city of Tula in Tula Oblast in Europe, see below (Wild Field section). A few more reindeer and moose were introduced into Pleistocene Park during this time, and a monitoring system for measuring the energy balance (ratio of energy emission and energy absorption) of the pasture was installed. ;2017‚Äìpresent: Attention has now been shifted back to the further development of Pleistocene Park. A successful crowdfunding effort in early 2017 provided funding for further animal acquisitions. Later that year twelve domestic yak and 30 domestic sheep were brought to the park. and the introduction of more muskoxen is planned for 2020. For the near future the focus in animal introductions will generally be placed on browsers, not grazers, i.e., bison, muskoxen, moose and wapiti. Their role in this phase will be to diminish the amount of shrubs and trees and enlarge the grassy areas. Only when these areas have sufficiently increased will grazers like saiga and kiang be introduced.  Reception = Controversial aspects  Critics admonish that introducing alien species could damage the fragile ecosystem of the existing tundra. To this criticism Sergey Zimov replied: \\"Tundra ‚Äì that is not an ecosystem. Such systems had not existed on the planet [before the disappearance of the megafauna], and there is nothing to cherish in the tundra. Of course, it would be silly to create a desert instead of the tundra, but if the same site would evolve into a steppe, then it certainly would improve the environment. If deer, foxes, bovines were more abundant, nature would only benefit from this. And people too. However, the danger still exists, of course, you have to be very careful. If it is a revival of the steppes, then, for example, small animals are really dangerous to release without control. As for large herbivores ‚Äì no danger, as they are very easy to remove again.\\" Another point of concern is doubt that the majority of species can be introduced in such harsh conditions. For example, according to some critics, the Yakutian horses, although they have been living in the park for several generations, would not have survived without human intervention. They normally tolerate ‚Äì60 ¬∞C, but are said to cope poorly with an abundance of snow and possibly would have died of starvation in the first snowy winter. However, horses of much less primitive stock abandoned by the Japanese Army have been living feral on some uninhabited Kuril Islands since 1945. Despite the deep snows (two to three times deeper than in Yakutia), they have successfully survived all the winters without feeding. And in Pleistocene Park, while some of the Yakutian horses accept supplementary feeding, others keep away and survive on their own.  Positive reception  The Zimovs' concept of Pleistocene Park and repopulating the mammoth steppe is listed as one of the ‚Äú100 most substantive solutions to global warming‚Äù by Project Drawdown. The list, encompassing only technologically viable, existing solutions, was compiled by a team of over 200 scholars, scientists, policymakers, business leaders and activists; for each solution the carbon impact through the year 2050, the total and net cost to society, and the total lifetime savings were measured and modelled.  Visitors  The park is a hub for international scientists and students, who come from around the world to conduct their own ecological research and experiments. The Polaris Project was a yearly visitor from 2009 to 2015, sending American students on excursions to the park each summer. Another group of visitors are journalists. The park is steadily gaining more media attention and while most journalists do not come to the park itself the number of visitors is increasing. In 2016 for example, the park was visited by a filmmaker, two print media (Swiss 24 Heures and American The Atlantic), and two TV broadcasting companies (German ARD and American HBO). The total of visitors for 2016 (summer months only) was 45.  Size and administration  Pleistocene Park is a 16 km2 scientific nature reserve (zakaznik) consisting of willow brush, grasslands, swamps, forests and a multitude of lakes. The average temperature in January is about ‚Äì33 ¬∞C and in July +12 ¬∞C; annual precipitation is 200‚Äì250 mm. Pleistocene Park is owned and administered by a non-profit corporation, the Pleistocene Park Association, consisting of the ecologists from the Northeast Science Station in Chersky and the Grassland Institute in Yakutsk. The present park area was signed over to the association by the state and is exempt from land tax. The reserve is surrounded by a 600 km2 buffer zone that will be added to the park by the regional government once the animals have successfully established themselves. In July 2015 the Pleistocene Park Foundation was founded, a non- profit organization (registered in Pennsylvania, USA, with 501(c)(3) status) dedicated to acquiring private donations for funding Pleistocene Park. Hitherto Pleistocene Park had been financed solely through the funds of the founders, a practice that grew increasingly insufficient.  Animals =Animals already present in the park ;Herbivores: Yakutian horses * Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus): Present before the project started (although more are being brought to help simulate Pleistocene conditions). They mainly graze in the southern highlands of the park. This territory is not affected by spring flooding and dominated by larch forests and shrubland. Reindeer rarely visit the flood plain. Besides actively grazing (especially in winter) they browse on willow shrubs, tree moss, and lichens. (Numbers in park in September 2020: 20-30) * Elk[BE]/moose[AE] (Alces alces): Present before the project started, although in low numbers. Immigration from neighboring areas is stimulated. Due to poaching the density of moose in the region has substantially decreased in the last 20 years. To increase moose density in the park, special constructions were added to the fence in several places that allow animals outside the fenced area to enter the park, while not allowing them to leave. Besides that wild moose calves are being caught in other regions and transported to the park. It is the largest extant species of the deer family and one of the largest herbivores in the park today. (Numbers in park in September 2020: 5-15) * Yakutian horse (a domestic breed of Horse): The first species to be introduced for the project, they were imported from the surrounding Srednekolymsk region beginning in 1988. Yakutian horses have developed a range of remarkable morphologic, metabolic and physiologic adaptions to the harsh environment of Siberia, including an extremely dense and long winter coat, a compact build, a metabolism adjusted to seasonal needs, and an increased production of antifreezing compounds. In summer they grow very large hooves, which they wear down in winter scraping away snow to get at food. Despite their size, they proved to be dominant over the wisents, who often fled from them. Yakutian horses are purely grazing animals ‚Äì they eat only grass species and visit the park's forests only during the spring flood. In the spring of 2015, ten more Yakutian horses were acquired to increase genetic diversity. (Numbers in park in September 2020: approximately 40) Muskoxen family * Muskox (Ovibos moschatus): Muskoxen arrived at the park in September 2010\\\\. They were brought from Wrangel Island (itself repopulated with animals from North America). They are doing well and are now fully grown. Unfortunately only males could be acquired, after an attempt to get both males and females was thwarted during the expedition when a polar bear broke the fence to eat one of them , and the Zimovs are now urgently looking for females. The introduction of more muskoxen is planned for 2019. (Numbers in park in July 2017: 3 males) A new expedition to go to Wrangel Island was planned to take place in late 2020, but ultimately cancelled due to various delays by the time they had the boats ready, including by the COVID-19 pandemic. * Wisent (AKA European bison, Bison bonasus): During the last ice age, wisents were the most cold-adapted of the Bison species and thrived in the glacial grassland-steppe biome. Their dietary needs are very different from the American bison. Year-round 10% of their diet necessarily consists of trees and shrubs, and they will ignore their main forage (grasses, sedges and forbs) in favour of woody forage to reach this quota. Without supplementary feeding in winter, the yearly average may rise to 20% even in countries with mild winters. Five wisents, one adult male and four juvenile females, were introduced in the park in April 2011\\\\. The wisents were brought to the park from the Prioksko-Terrasny Nature Reserve near Moscow. The transportation was more complicated and took a longer time than originally thought, but all the animals recovered rapidly after the trip. Unfortunately, the wisents did not sufficiently acclimatize in the first months. They started to moult in November, when temperatures already were down to ‚Äì30 ¬∞C (‚Äì35 ¬∞F) in Cherskii. The four juveniles died; only the adult bull survived. He is now fully acclimatized. (Numbers in park in September 2020: 1 male) Domestic yak in the Altai Mountains * Domestic yak (Bos mutus grunniens): Ten domestic yaks acquired in Irkutsk Oblast were introduced in Pleistocene Park in June 2017; two calves were born a few days after the arrival. Another calf was born after that. Yaks are adapted to extreme cold, short growing seasons for grazing herbage, and rough grazing conditions with sedges and shrubby plants. Wild yaks once lived in western Beringia. (Numbers in park in September 2020: approximately 8) * Edilbaevskaya sheep (a domestic breed of sheep): 30 domestic sheep acquired in Irkutsk Oblast were introduced in Pleistocene Park in October 2017. The sheep are from a breed that is adapted to the Siberian cold. They belong to the breed group of fat-tailed sheep; their fatty rump evolved to store fat as a reserve for lean seasons, analogous to a camel's humps. (Numbers in park in May 2018: approximately 35) * Kalmykian Cattle (A domestic breed of cattle): A population was introduced to the park in October 2018. * Plains bison (Bison bison bison): Twelve yearling plains bison, nine males and three females, were acquired and would have been introduced in the park once the United States‚Äô FAA gave clearance for the flight. The plains bison were bought from the Stevens Village Bison Reserve near Delta Junction in Alaska; as the climate there is comparable to that of Siberia, the young bison were expected to thrive. Plains bison are grazers of grasses and sedges. Unlike wisents, plains bison are almost pure grazers, which will consume other plant material mainly in time of need. While wood bison were the preferred choice of subspecies, they are not easy to acquire; plains bison simply are the subspecies that could be brought to the Park most easily. They got bison from Denmark, from the Ditlevsdal bison farm. The bison began travelling on 7 May, and officially arrived safely in the park on 9 June. (Numbers in park in June 2019: 12) * Non-ungulate herbivores to be found in the park are the mountain hare (Lepus timidus), the black-capped marmot (Marmota camtschatica), and the Arctic ground squirrel (Spermophilus parryii), as well as the muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) and diverse species of voles. ;Carnivores: * Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx): Present before the project started. It is an important predator of medium-sized herbivores like hares and roe deer. * Tundra wolf (Canis lupus albus): Despite the original low concentration of ungulates, the area was home to a wolf family already before the project started. This arctic subspecies of the gray wolf is widespread from northern Scandinavia to the Kamchatka Peninsula. * Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus): Present before the project started. Well adapted to living in the arctic environment, its fur changes color with the season: white in winter, brown in summer. Eurasian brown bear * Eurasian brown bear (Ursus arctos arctos): Present before the project started. Currently the largest predator in the region. * Wolverine (Gulo gulo): Present before the project started. A stocky and muscular carnivore, the wolverine is a powerful and versatile predator and scavenger. * Red fox (Vulpes vulpes): Present before the project started. Red foxes are omnivores with a highly varied diet. In the former Soviet Union, up to 300 animals and a few dozen plant species are known to be consumed by them. * Sable (Martes zibellina): Present before the project started. * Stoat (Mustela erminea): Present before the project started. Animals being considered for reintroduction ;Herbivores: * American bison (Bison bison): ** Wood bison (Bison bison athabascae): Better adapted to life in the Far North than the plains bison. Mainly a grazer of grasses and sedges, seasonally supplements this diet with other plant material like forbs, lichen, and silverberry and willow leaves. Wet meadows in bottomlands (like the Kolyma river plain) are an important habitat for wood bison. The original plans for the rewilding of Bison had called for the introduction of wood bison as an ecological proxy for the extinct steppe wisent, Bison priscus. These plans did not work out and wisents were acquired instead. Altai maral * Altai wapiti or Altai maral (Cervus canadensis sibiricus): Had been introduced in April 2011. The wapiti made their way to the park all the way from the mountainous regions of Altai in central southern Siberia. Wapiti are very good jumpers and all six escaped within the first two years. The fence has been strengthened to cope with future introductions. * Wild yak (Bos mutus): Could be brought from the Tibetan Plateau. Along with the bison, horse, and reindeer, the species could contribute to the further proliferation of grasses in the region. * Snow sheep (Ovis nivicola): Immigration from neighboring areas is encouraged. Especially rams may be lured to the park by domestic ewes in rut. * Wild Bactrian camel (Camelus ferus) or Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus): Either of the two- humped camel species could act as a proxy for extinct Pleistocene camel species, whose fossils have been found in areas that once formed part of Beringia. The camel evolved in the high arctic as a large boreal browser; its hump presumably evolved to store fat as a resource for the long winter. Bactrian camels will eat almost anything, preferably any plant material such as grass, shrubs, bark, etc., but in times of need also carrion. In the winter they will dig under snow to get at forage. The wild Bactrian camel is critically endangered and is only found in some few areas of China and Mongolia. * Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus): Immigration from neighboring areas is encouraged. Siberian tiger * Saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica): Introduction is in the planning stage. Its presence would be critical for the regulation of poisonous plants in the region that can be digested by the saiga but are harmful to other herbivores. Currently, free saigas can only be found in Russia in the Chyornye Zemli Nature Reserve. * Orenburg fur goat (Capra aegagrus hircus): Introduction is being planned. Its presence is necessary due to their ability to eat anything. Only difficulty with acquiring them is due to them being only found in Orenburg, due to veterinary services not allowing shipping out of that region. ;Carnivores: * Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris tigris): Introduction planned for a later stage, when herbivores have multiplied. Endangered and reduced to the Primorye region. As the largest feline alive, the Siberian tiger could play a key role in regulating the numbers of the largest herbivores. Animals that could be placed in the park if revived from extinction Woolly mammoth model at the Royal BC Museum, Victoria, British Columbia * Woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius): In January 2011, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported that a team of scientists from Kyoto University were planning to extract DNA from a mammoth carcass preserved in a Russian laboratory and insert it into egg cells of elephants in hope of creating a mammoth embryo. If the experiment succeeded, the calf would be taken to the park along with others to form a wild population. The researchers claimed that their aim was to produce the first mammoth within six years. * Cave lion (Panthera spelaea): The discovery of two well-preserved cubs in the Sakha Republic ignited a project to clone the animal. * Steppe bison (Bison priscus): The discovery of the mummified steppe bison of 9,000 years ago could help people clone the ancient bison species back, even though the steppe bison would not be the first to be \\"resurrected\\". * Woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis): Similar reasons of bringing back as the woolly mammoth. * Irish elk (Megaloceros giganteus) * Cave bear (Ursus spelaeus) https://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/first-ever- preserved-grown-up-cave-bear-even-its-nose-is-intact-unearthed-on-the-arctic- island/?fbclid=IwAR2HYSEBc73V4yB2f4Wjp_rqbDJN-e-mDwQAuYWKpNRQWNH9ej5d5Hs-Src  Southern branch of Pleistocene Park: The Wild Field wilderness reserve  In 2012 to 2014 a branch of Pleistocene Park named \\"Wild Field\\" ( ) was constructed near the city of Tula in Tula Oblast in the European part of Russia, approximately 250 km (150 mi) south of Moscow. Unlike Pleistocene Park, Wild Field's primary purpose is not scientific research but public outreach, i.e., it will provide a model of what an unregulated steppe ecosystem looked like before the advent of humans. It is situated near a federal road and a railway station and will be accessible to the general public. Wild Field comprises 300 ha (740 ac) of which 280 ha have been fenced off and stocked with animals. Already present in the park are nine species of large herbivores and one omnivore species: Bashkir horses (a strain of Equus ferus caballus) from the southern part of the Ural Mountains, Altai maral/Altai wapiti (Cervus canadensis sibiricus), Edilbaevskaya sheep (a strain of Ovis orientalis aries), roe deer (Capreolus spec.), Kalmykian cattle (a strain of Bos primigenius taurus), domestic yaks (Bos mutus grunniens), wild boar (Sus scrofa), one female elk[BE]/moose[AE] (Alces alces), four reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and 73 domestic Pridonskaya goats (a strain of Capra aegagrus hircus).

In 1828, Shlomo was born to Rabbi Yisroel Moshe HaCohen, a dayan in the rabbinic court in Vilna. As a young child, Shlomo was known for his diligence and devotion to Torah study. When Shlomo was thirteen years old, he became deathly sick and his doctors told him that he must stop studying Torah because the intensity of his studies was adversely affecting his weak heart. Nonetheless, Shlomo refused to relent, and continued to study Torah, as he reasoned that Torah is his life.Talelei Oros, English, Bamidbar HaKohen's glosses on the Talmud were published in the Vilna Edition Shas under the name \\"Cheshek Shlomo\\" (◊ó◊©◊ß ◊©◊ú◊û◊î).

HaKohen was a childhood friend of Rabbi Alexander Moshe Lapidus,Rav Alexander Moshe Lapidus ZT\\"L, The Forgotten Gadol:A First- Time Comprehensive Biography also a native of Vilna. Rabbi Shlomo also corresponded with Rabbi Chaim Hezekiah Medini, who frequently praised and quoted from Rabbi Shlomo in his magnum opus, Sdei Chemed. His responsa have gained a position of prominence in halachic literature, and are frequently quoted.

An orle can sometimes be confused with an inescutcheon or escutcheon voided (a smaller shield with a shield-shaped hole), or with a patch of the field left over between a bordure and an inescutcheon. Orles may varied by any of the lines of variation. Discrete charges arranged in the position of an orle are described as in orle or as \\"an orle of\\".

John Woodward is of the opinion that \\"a plain tressure is a diminutive of the orle, and is depicted half its thickness\\". A tressure is described as representing the circular raised line on a coin that shows the user if the coin has been clipped or overly worn. A double tressure is normally an 'orle gemel', i.e. an orle divided into two narrow ones set closely together, one inside the other, with artists interpreting it as composed of two narrow orles each being one-third or one-fourth the width and the void between them being one-third or one-half the width. A. C. Fox-Davies argued that a tressure is by necessity doubled, otherwise it would be an orle. However, examples exist of coats of arms with a single tressure, as in the arms of Edward Lawrence.

It is much more common to see tressures flory-counter-flory, especially in Scottish heraldry, where many coats of arms derive from the Royal Coat of Arms, in which the tressure represents the Auld Alliance with France (fleurs-de-lys being a French symbol). As a result the double tressure flory-counter-flory is often referred to as 'the royal tressure'. When a tressure is impaled, it is supposed to follow the same rule as the bordure, and not to be continued on the side of the impalement, but several exceptions may be found.

Subspecies of Europe Apis mellifera * Apis mellifera adami, classified by Ruttner, 1975 - (the Cretan honey bee) The island of Crete. * Apis mellifera artemisia, classified by Engel, 1999 - (the Russian steppe honey bee) The steppes of Russia. * Apis mellifera carnica, classified by Pollmann, 1879 - (the Carniolan honey bee) The Carniola region of Slovenia, the Eastern Alps and the northern Balkans - popular with beekeepers due to its extreme gentleness. The Carniolan honey bee tends to be quite dark in color and the colonies are known to shrink to small populations over winter and build very quickly in spring. It is a mountain bee in its native range and is a good bee for colder climates. * Apis mellifera caucasia (commonly misspelled as caucasica), classified by Pollmann, 1889 - (the Caucasian honey bee) The central Caucasus. * Apis mellifera cecropia, classified by Kiesenwetter, 1860 - (the Greek honey bee) Southern Greece. * Apis mellifera cypria, classified by Pollmann, 1879 - (the Cyprus honey bee) The island of Cyprus - this subspecies has the reputation of being very fierce compared to the Italian subspecies, from which it is isolated by the Mediterranean Sea. * Apis mellifera iberiensis (commonly misspelled as iberica), classified by Engel, 1999 - (the Spanish honey bee) The Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal). * Apis mellifera ligustica, classified by Spinola, 1806 - (the Italian honey bee) The most commonly kept subspecies in North America, South America and southern Europe. They are kept commercially all over the world. They are very gentle, not very likely to swarm and produce a large surplus of honey. They have few undesirable characteristics. Colonies tend to maintain larger populations through winter, so they require more winter stores (or feeding) than other temperate zone subspecies. The Italian honey bee is light-colored and mostly leather-colored, but some strains are golden. * Apis mellifera macedonica, classified by Ruttner, 1988 - (the Macedonian honey bee) Northern Greece (Macedonia and Thrace), North Macedonia. Possibly synonymous with A. m. artemisia (the Russian steppe honey bee; see above) as described by Engel, 1999. * Apis mellifera mellifera, classified by Linnaeus, 1758 - (the German honey bee) the dark-colored bee of northern Europe, also called the German black honey bee or the European dark honey bee. Domesticated in modern times and taken to North America in colonial times. * Apis mellifera ruttneri, classified by Sheppard, Arias, Grech & Meixner in 1997 - (the Maltese honey bee) The Maltese islands. * Apis mellifera remipes, classified by Gerst√§cker, 1862 (armeniaca is a junior synonym) - (the Armenian honey bee) The Caucasus, Iran, the Caspian Sea. * Apis mellifera siciliana, classified by Grassi, 1881 (sicula is a junior synonym) - (the Sicilian honey bee) The Trapani province and the island of Ustica of western Sicily (Italy). * Apis mellifera sossimai, classified by Engel, 1999 (includes the former Apis cerifera, classified by Gerstaecker, 1862) - (the Ukrainian honey bee) Ukraine (except for Crimea) and the northern Caucasus. * Apis mellifera taurica, classified by Alpatov, 1935 - (the Crimean honey bee) Crimea. Subspecies of Africa Several researchers and beekeepers describe a general trait of the various African subspecies which is absconding, where the Africanized honey bee colonies abscond the hive in times when food stores are low, unlike the European honey bee colonies, which tend to die in the hive. * Apis mellifera adansonii, classified by Latreille, 1804 - (the West African honey bee) Nigeria and Burkina Faso. * Apis mellifera capensis, classified by Eschscholtz, 1822 - (the Cape honey bee) South Africa. * Apis mellifera intermissa, classified by von Buttel-Reepen, 1906; Maa, 1953 (major is a junior synonym) - (the Tunisian honey bee) The northern part of Africa in the general area of Morocco, Libya and Tunisia. These bees are totally black in color. They are extremely fierce, but do not attack without provocation. They are industrious and hardy, but have many negative qualities that argue against their being favored in the honey or pollination industry. * Apis mellifera jemenitica, classified by Ruttner, 1976 (nubica is a junior synonym) - (the Arabian honey bee) Somalia, Uganda, Sudan and Yemen. * Apis mellifera lamarckii, classified by Cockerell, 1906 - (the Egyptian honey bee) The Nile Valley of Egypt and Sudan. This mitotype can also be identified in honey bees from California. * Apis mellifera litorea, classified by Smith, 1961 - (the East African coastal honey bee) The low elevations of East Africa. * Apis mellifera monticola, classified by Smith, 1961 - (the East African mountain honey bee) The high altitude mountains at elevation between 1,500 and 3,100 metres of East Africa (Mt. Elgon, Mt. Kilimanjaro, Mt. Kenya and Mt. Meru). * Apis mellifera sahariensis, classified by Baldensperger, 1932 - (the Saharan honey bee) The Moroccan desert oases of Northwest Africa. This subspecies faces few predators other than humans and is therefore very gentle. Moreover, because of the low density of nectar-producing vegetation around the oases it colonizes, it forages up to five miles, much farther than subspecies from less arid regions. Other authorities say that while colonies of this species are not much inclined to sting when their hives are opened for inspection, they are, nevertheless, highly nervous. * Apis mellifera scutellata, classified by Lepeletier, 1836 - (the East African lowland honey bee) Central and East Africa; also as hybrid populations in South America, Central America and the southern United States. In an effort to address concerns by Brazilian beekeepers and to increase honey production in Brazil, Warwick Kerr, a Brazilian geneticist, was asked by Brazilian federal and state authorities in 1956 to import several pure East African lowland queens from Tanzania to Piracicaba, S√£o Paulo State in southern Brazil. Due to a mishap, some of the queens escaped. The East African lowland queens eventually mated with local European honey bee drones and produced what is now known as the Africanized honey bee in South and North America. The intense struggle for survival of western honey bees in Sub-Saharan Africa is given as the reason that this subspecies is proactive in defending the hive and also more likely to abandon an existing hive and swarm to a more secure location. They direct more of their energies to defensive behaviors and less of their energies to honey storage. East African lowland honey bees are leather-colored and difficult to distinguish by eye from the darker strains of the Italian honey bee.Abramson, Charles I., Aquino, Italo S. 2002.

Machine configuration An insertion mount machine often has a rotary table on a X- and Y-axis positioning system which moves the board to the necessary position for the component's insertion into the board. The machine can be configured to be standalone machine. Axial insertion An axial inserter takes axial leaded through-hole components from reels which are fed into dispensing heads that cut the parts onto a chain in the order of insertion; transferred from the sequence chain to the insertion chain, which brings the component underneath the insertion head which then cuts the leads of the component to the correct length for lead length and insertion span; bends the leads 90¬∞; and inserts the component leads into the board while a clinch assembly underneath cuts and bends the leads towards each other. Radial insertion A radial inserter takes radial leaded through-hole components from a reels which are fed into dispensing heads that cut the component from the reel and place it onto the chain in sequence of the order of insertion. The component is brought to a component transfer assembly behind the insertion head and is transferred to the insertion head, then inserted into the board while a clinch assembly underneath cuts and bends the leads opposite to each other. Dual in-line package insertion A dual in-line (DIP) inserter takes integrated circuits from tubes which are loaded into magazines. A shuttle mechanism picks the needed component needed from the magazines and drops it into a transfer assembly. The insertion head picks the component from the transfer assembly and inserts the IC into the board while a clinch assembly underneath cuts and bends the leads either inward for sockets or outward for ICs. Due to the transition from insertion mount technology (through-hole) to surface-mount technology of integrated circuits, these machines are no longer being newly manufactured. Obsolete configurations Axial inserters used to consist of a stand-alone sequencer machine which cut and sequenced the parts onto a reel. That reel was then transferred over to a standalone axial inserter to insert the components. This is all done on one machine today.

It was built in the 13th Century by the Habsburg dynasty, was the administrative seat for 260 years of a bailiwick of the city of Bern and fell into ruin in the 18th century. Location Schenkenberg hill with the castle ruins as well as the municipality of Thalheim and the Schenkenberger valley The castle is located on the high hill of the same name. This hill, located in the Jura Mountains is about above the long Schenkenberg valley (). History The castle was probably built in the early 13th Century for the Habsburgs dynasty, both as a headquarters and to protect core areas around Brugg. The first written mention of the castle took place in 1243 when the Lords of Schenkenberg, a Habsburg vassal, were granted land around the castle. The ownership changed multiple times as the Habsburgs granted it to other vassals. After the Habsburg defeat at the Battle of Sempach, they fell into financial difficulties and had to mortgage the castle. In 1415 the Habsburgs fell into disfavor with King Sigismund, after the Swiss Confederates conquered the Aargau. The area on the left side of the Aare, including the Schenkenberger valley remained unchanged for the time being. However, in 1417, King Sigismund put the castle under his direct protection. The holder of the castle, Margaret of Fridlingen, sold the castle and the related rights in 1431 to Baron Th√ºring of Aarburg. The bailiwick of Schenkenberg was at that time a fairly sovereign state. It extended over a large part of today's Brugg District. In 1451 Th√ºring ran into financial problems and sold the title and rights to his son-in-law Hans von Baldegg and Hans' brother Markwart. The Baldegger, who had fought on the side of the Habsburgs in 1386, allied themselves with Austria and pointedly drew the ire of the Confederates on himself. Increasingly, there were disputes with the citizens of the town of Brugg, who were subjects of Bern. In 1460 Bern finally had enough of the permanent provocations and occupied the castle driving out the Baldeggers. The damage to the castle following the fight was immediately repaired. The castle became the seat of the Bernese bailiff and the center of the Herrschaft of Schenkenberg in the Bernese Aargau. The Baldeggers tried several times, by diplomatic and legal as well as in the Swabian War of 1499, to regain their castle and title. However they were always unsuccessful. Hans von Baldegg, the last of his line, died in 1510 of the plague. Schenkenberg castle was in the northeastern corner of the territory of Bern, near the border with western Austria. Due to this strategic location Bern fortified the castle, but spent little in maintenance. In the early 18th Century, the castle became so dilapidated that the Governor and his family feared for their lives because the walls regularly crumbled. Finally the Council of the City of Bern gave up the castle, and the Governor moved in 1720 to the nearby Castle Wildenstein in Veltheim. The castle fell into disrepair and was used as a quarry by the farmers of the area. In 1798 it became the property of the newly formed Canton of Aargau, the legal successor of the city of Bern. In 1837, the castle was purchased from a dubious, \\"Herr von Schenkenberg\\", who, however, disappeared without a trace shortly thereafter. The castle was virtually abandoned for several decades. In a storm in 1917 east wall collapsed. The collapse spurred the authorities to declare the castle as unclaimed property, and put it up for auction in May 1918. For the symbolic sum of 50 francs it was sold to the Historical Preservation Society of Aargau.Staatsarchiv Aargau, Depositum AVH Schenkenberg.

Reed's rules Reed's rules are as follows: #On every chest film, read the abdominal portion as you would read an abdominal film. #Knowledge of anatomy is the key to correct radiographic diagnosis. #The airway should be visible on all normal chest films. #A mass must be seen in two planes. #An esophagram must be done on any child with unexplained respiratory disease. #In unilateral hyperexpansion of the lungs, you must see how the air moves. Mediastinal position is critical to this determination. #Always review all old films to assess new ones properly. Subtle findings can be missed easily when a single previous examination is reviewed. #The abdominal examination should include a minimum of three views‚Äîsupine, prone and erect. #On every abdominal examination, evaluate the chest as if you were looking at a chest film. #In obstruction of the lumen, there should be proximal distention. #During intravenous urography, keep taking films as long as you are getting needed information. #Try to find the effects of the mass on adjacent organs on each abdominal film. Draw the mass, if necessary. #After you have defined the mass, find the center of the lesion. Then consider all structures, gross and microscopic, near the center of the lesion as possible sources of the mass. Think skin to skin. #The periosteum is not normally seen. #When viewing an extremity, try to imagine the appearance of the patient. An excellent example is bowed legs or knock knees.

This article discusses that in the scope of the United States, and in the scope of educational institutions and their proxies in the handling of student data for children under 19. This has become a very fiery topic for debate and is in the public eye right now. Rights of students The student has the same rights and privileges given to parents or guardians, as long as he or she has reached the age of 18 or is enrolled in a postsecondary institution. The student also has the right to inspect confidential records and challenge the accuracy of information contained in the file. Eligible students are also able to challenge the accuracy of the information contained in their files, under the same guidelines as their parents or legal guardians. Although FERPA (see below) is the primary Federal law regarding student data privacy, it is also regulated at the Federal level by regulations like COPPA, for online sites directed at children under 13, and HIPAA, for any health-related data. There are many state- and local-level regulations and laws and policies as well, but these are the primary ones at the Federal level. Rights of school personnel Teachers, counselors, and administrators, who have a legitimate educational interest in viewing the records may do so. All school personnel with a bonafide need can maintain personal notes on students for personal use. The school district is required to disclose the following information when requested: * Educational records to comply with judicial orders for state and federal agencies * Disciplinary proceedings conducted against perpetrators of a crime * Directory information on students Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects confidentiality of student records. This act, commonly referred to as the Buckley Amendment, was enacted by the Congress in 1974 to guarantee parents and students a certain degree of confidentiality and fundamental fairness with respect to the maintenance and use of student records. The law is designed to ensure that certain types of personally identifiable information regarding students will not be released without parental consent or, at the age of 18, the students consent. The United States Department of Education has a division to specifically support privacy issues with student data: the Privacy Technical Assistance Center (PTAC).  Example process  Parents and legal guardians in the United States have the right to inspect their child's records. A school official should be present to assist a parent or guardian in interpreting information contained in the files and to respond to questions that may be raised during the examination process. Parents or legal guardians have the right to challenge the accuracy of any information found in the files regarding their child. * The school should schedule a conference within a reasonable period of time to discuss the information that may be deemed inaccurate, inappropriate, or misleading. * If the conference does not result in changes to the satisfaction of parents, they may request a hearing with the Director of Pupil Personnel to appeal the decision reached during the conference. * A final decision should be reached within 10 days. * If the parent or legal guardian continues to disagree, they are able to place statements of disagreements in the file with reasons for the disagreement. No Child Left Behind Act=Transfer of school disciplinary records The new provision requires states that receive funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, within two years, to provide an assurance to the Secretary of Education that the state \\"has a procedure in place to facilitate the transfer of disciplinary records, with respect to suspension or expulsion, by local educational agencies to any private or public elementary school or secondary school for any student who is enrolled or seeks, intends, or is instructed to enroll, on a full- or part-time basis, in the school.\\" Armed forces recruiter access Congress required that any school districts receiving funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act provide directory-type information to military recruiters who request it. Student privacy and physical exams The Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment gives parents more rights with regard to the surveying of minor students, the collection of information from students for marketing purposes, and certain nonemergency medical examinations. Sanctions for violations \\"(A) No funds shall be made available under any applicable program to any educational agency or institution which has a policy of denying, or which effectively prevents, the parents of students who are or have been in attendance at a school of such agency or at such institution, as the case may be, the right to inspect and review the education records of their children. If any material or document in the education record of a student includes information on more than one student, the parents of one of such students shall have the right to inspect and review only such part of such material or document as relates to such student or to be informed of the specific information contained in such part of such material. Each educational agency or institution shall establish appropriate procedures for the granting of a request by parents for access to the education records of their children within a reasonable period of time, but in no case more than forty-five days after the request has been made.\\"  Privacy and data mining concerns  Under the Obama Administration, over 1 billion dollars were spent in developing databases designed for improving the educational system, including P-20 longitudinal data systems. Although these databases contain extensive personally identifiable information, much of this information is \\"not kept in a format that allows officials to easily extract the complete file on any one child.\\" , parents concerned about student privacy and data mining of student information have begun to organize opposition at the state level: > We don't know what they're tracking and we don't know what the implications > are going to be for these children in the future ... Going for jobs in the > future, trying to get into college ‚Äî we're in uncharted territory and we > just don't know the implication it's going to have for the children. We need > to slow down. References *Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 122 S. Ct. 2268 (2002). #The court agreed with the lower court that the Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act provides parents and students with statistical information about the type and number of crimes on campus. #The court reaffirmed the department's broad reading of the term \\"educational records\\" and stated that Congress, in amending FERPA in 1998 to allow post-secondary institutions to disclose the final results of disciplinary proceedings, must have intended that disciplinary records be education records or this amendment would be \\"superfluous\\". #The court held that the Department of Education was within its rights in seeking an injunctive relief in this case because none of the administrative remedies authorized by FERPA would have stopped the violations. In effect, the court held that the department can take preemptive actions in enforcing FERPA, rather than only after violations occur. *Owasso Indep. Sch. Dist. No. I-011 v.

Interactive Entertainment for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It is the sequel to F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin and is the third and final installment of the F.E.A.R. series. It was announced on April 8, 2010, and was stated to include John Carpenter helping on the cinematics as well as writer Steve Niles. It is also the only F.E.A.R. game to have offline multiplayer and co-op. Gameplay Players control their characters from a first-person perspective. The player can carry two weapons at a time, and replenish ammo picked up from dead soldiers and weapon crates. The series' cover system uses a \\"peeking\\" rather than a \\"tilting\\" mechanic, wherein players peer and fire around the edges of their cover. Damage displays as a red vignette overlay. When the screen fills, the character dies. In cooperative and multiplayer modes, the player enters a \\"Final Stand\\" on their death, which lets teammates try to revive the downed player. Campaign In the Campaign, the player controls either the Point Man or Paxton Fettel. As the Point Man, the player can use weapons, throw grenades, etc. Unlike most characters, the player can use the Point Man's slow motion ability to slow down time, allowing the player to shoot targets with accuracy. As Fettel, the player cannot use any conventional weapons by default; however, they can use Fettel's psychic powers and telekinesis to suspend and throw objects, possess enemy soldiers, crush suspended enemies, and more. In addition to these abilities, the player also has access to the abilities and weapons of any character Fettel possesses, such as Cultists and Phase Commanders. In co-op mode, Fettel can also use the Shield ability to briefly protect the Point Man. Both characters' abilities are gauged by a meter in the reticle, which depletes during use. Both characters' gauges slowly refills when not in use; Fettel, meanwhile, must collect Souls to replenish his Possession Meter. Players have the ability to access and control Armacham technology, such as mech suits. Also, the game has both online and offline co-operative play. The game's campaign mode is split into eight \\"Intervals\\" that can be played in either single-player or co-op. In single-player, when the player completes an Interval as the Point Man, they will unlock the ability to play as Fettel for that Interval. While playing alone or with a friend, the player can complete challenges to raise their rank. Perks include increases to the slow motion and possession meters and new melee attacks. Multiplayer A screenshot from the game mode \\"Fucking Run!\\". Here, the player is backing away from the Wall of Death. F.E.A.R. 3 offers four different multiplayer modes, each allowing up to 4 players: *Fucking Run! (see right): in this mode, players must fight their way through waves of enemies, all while running from Alma's massive \\"Wall of Death.\\" The players start off in a safe area and proceed through a series of connected maps, killing enemies that stand in their way. If the Wall consumes any one player, the game is over for all players. To complete the mission, players must cooperate; if any player goes down, team members must revive them before the Wall arrives to devour them. Each map is divided into sections, and each section gives the player(s) a target time to try and break.http://gematsu.com/2011/03/hands-on-f-e-a-r-3-multiplayers-fucking-run- mode *Contractions: a round-based survival mode, where players must barricade and stock up weapons against a total of 20 waves of enemies, including Armacham forces, Cultists, and more. Waves become increasingly tougher by thickening fog, making the map much more dangerous, especially with Alma wandering the field. If a player gets Alma's attention, either by attacking her or staying in her sight for too long, it is game over for that player. *Soul Survivor: Here, players must fight to survive or hunt. When the game starts, Alma will turn one player into a \\"Spectre\\", a ghost which can possess enemies. The Spectre player's goal is to kill the other three players and turn them into Spectres before time runs out. Players killed by the Spectre player do not get a game over; instead, they turn into Spectres themselves. *Soul King: though similar to Soul Survivor, Soul King is a competitive mode with all players as Spectres. To win, players must possess enemies to kill each other and collect dropped souls. The player with the most souls earns the title of \\"Soul King\\"; however, this also means that said player will be made visible to other players via a glowing outline. If a Soul King is killed, that player will drop half of their souls. Story Nine months after the events of both previous F.E.A.R. games,http://www.ign.com/games/fear-3/xbox-360-45906 F.E.A.R. 3 on IGN the Point Man has been captured by Armacham soldiers and interrogated at a prison in Brazil. Paxton Fettel (Peter Lurie), now a \\"Spectre\\", interrupts the interrogation and helps free the Point Man. The two form an uneasy alliance and escape the prison through the slums. During their escape, the brothers discover that they ‚Äî and their tortured mother, Alma Wade (Al√©sia Glidewell) ‚Äî are being hunted by \\"the Creep\\", a monster unintentionally formed from the cruel memories of Harlan Wade. Hijacking a helicopter, the Point Man and Fettel return to Fairport to regroup with F.E.A.R. operative Jin Sun-Kwon (Kim Mai Guest). Upon arriving, they discover that most of Fairport's surviving population have been either driven insane by the paranormal activity or executed by Armacham personnel. Despite their differing goals, the brothers successfully meet up with Jin, who plays recorded video footage of Sgt. Michael Becket (Robin Atkin Downes), who claims to have been raped by Alma and is slated by Armacham for transport. Amid growing distrust, the brothers assault the local airport to intercept Becket, killing the remnants of the Armacham personnel. In an attempt to gain info from Becket, Fettel possesses him and reveals that Alma is indeed pregnant by Becket, with the increasing paranormal activity a result of her contractions. Becket realizes the Point Man's identity before exploding from Fettel's possession. The brothers head to the old Project Origin facility, where Harlan Wade originally developed the prototypes. There, the brothers start destroying items associated with memories of their childhood past to weaken the Creep. After destroying a monstrous apparition of the Creep, the brothers finally reunite with Alma, whose body has changed drastically due to her pregnancy. The Point Man aims his pistol at Alma's belly, where her third child resides, and Fettel angrily asks him if he is willing to throw his own blood away for orders. As they set themselves at each other's throats, one of two endings occur, depending on multiple factors (such as whether the player has played as the Point Man or Fettel, or in co-op, who has made the most points in 5 different sections of the game's combat.) In the Point Man's ending, he shoots Fettel in the head again, forcing him to vanish; then aims his gun at Alma before lowering it, and helps Alma give birth before peacefully vanishing. The Point Man then learns from Jin that everything has returned to normal before taking Alma's baby away with him to safety. In Paxton Fettel's ending, Fettel possesses the Point Man's body and extracts the baby from Alma's swollen body. He then promises to raise the child in his own image before cannibalizing Alma. In a post-credits scene, video footage is shown of the Synchronicity Event; the moment when Alma ‚Äî in a coma at the time ‚Äî linked telepathically to Fettel (Jeremy Shada) when he was ten years old. The event causes Fettel to go into a hysterical rage, in which he gruesomely kills several ATC security members using telekinetic attacks before finally being subdued. Fettel is heard in a voiceover saying, \\"They deserved to die. They all deserved to die.\\" and vowing it won't stop until Armacham is completely destroyed in the never ending quest for revenge of his mother. Development F.E.A.R. 3 runs on an updated version of the Despair Engine, the game engine that developer Day 1 Studios had used to develop their previous game, Fracture. F.E.A.R. 3's version of the engine incorporates the Havok physics simulation software. On April 8, 2010 F.E.A.R. 3 was announced as a sequel to F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin. The game was being developed by Day 1 Studios, in collaboration with Monolith Productions. The game was planned to be released in October 2010 but got delayed until March 2011. On April 27, 2011, Warner Bros. announced another delay, setting it June 21 in North America and June 24 in the United Kingdom. By 10 June the game was available for pre-order on Steam. It was released on June 21.

GameSpot's Carolyn Petit gave the title a 7.5/10 rating, criticizing its visuals and lack of scares, but praising the shooting mechanics, fun co-op and exciting multiplayer components. IGN's Colin Moriarty awarded the PC version an 8/10 rating, stating that \\"[w]hether you're looking for a new, solid shooter to play or something set in a unique, horror- filled atmosphere, F.E.A.R. 3 has something for you. You won't find the be- all, end-all shooter experience with F.E.A.R. 3, but you're still bound to have a lot of fun.\\" Eurogamer reviewed the Xbox 360 version and awarded it an 8/10 score. Although criticised for \\"subpar scares and a shoddy narrative\\" it was otherwise \\"finely crafted\\" with \\"a lot of lasting value\\".http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-06-23-fear-3-review?page=2 ReferencesExternal links * Category:2011 video games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Corporate warfare in fiction Category:F.E.A.R.

Radio talk show host Jeanne Sparrow once hosted a program in the evenings and weekends on KNIR. French-language programming in Cajun and Creole dialects were also aired on KNIR in addition to being an affiliate for Tulane University's sports radio network. The country format remains on the FM station (now known as KXKC a separate entity now owned by Citadel Broadcasting.) KNIR was the first AM station to simulcast KJMJ, thus forming repeater network Radio Maria USA, the English language unit of Radio Maria Inc. based in Como, Italy.

Route description The route begins at Interstate 70 just outside Stratton with a diamond interchange and then heads northward. It enters the Stratton city limits about after the Interstate 70 interchange. It then intersects Seventh Street, Sixth Street, and Fifth Street, in that order, ending at U.S. Highway 24 in Stratton. The route is entirely unmarked; there are no signs along its entire length designating the route as State Highway 57. However, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) still recognizes it as a state highway and maintains it as needed. History The route was established in the 1920s. At the time of its establishment, the route was far longer than it is today: it began at U.S. Highway 36 near Kirk and continued to its current terminus at U.S. Highway 24. Another section was added to SH 57 north of U.S. Highway 24 in 1939. Most of the route was de-designated in 1954, leaving only around Stratton. This entire length was paved in 1956. The route was linked to Interstate 70 from U.S. Highway 24 in 1966 when the Interstate Highway System was built, and the stretch north of US 24 was removed from the numbered route in 1992, leaving the half-mile stretch seen today.

May (1973), 'Opinion Structure of Political Parties: The Special Law of Curvilinear Disparity', Political Studies Volume 21 Issue 2, Pages 135 - 151 May contends that politically active people can be classified into three major strata or echelons according to their relative status within a party. Members of these divergent strata have contrasting motivations for being politically active and calibrate their ideological stances to differing extents as a result. Party strata The three strata are: The Party Elite, The Middle-Elite (or Sub-Leaders) and the Non-Elite. Curvilinear disparity refers to the disparity in radicalism between the middle-elite and both the party elite and the non-elite. Curvilinear Disparity Diagram Curvilinear Disparity in a two-party system. Party elite The party elite consists of members of parliament, members of the governing executive, party candidates, convention delegates and members of the national executive committee. This stratum usually consists of full-time professional politicians who depend on elections to safeguard or further their careers. As a consequence, they have strong incentives to prioritise electoral success over personal ideological convictions. Members of the party elite are viewed as being rational actors whose primary motivation stems from their desire to be re-elected. As rationally self-interested politicians interested in vote maximisation, members of the political elite adopt moderate viewpoints in order to appeal to the median voter. These assumptions are in line with other established theories in political science, including the median voter theorem.Downs, Anthony (1957). An Economic Theory of Democracy. Harper Collins. The concept of \\"the median voter\\" is usually applied to political systems featuring First-past-the-post electoral systems. In these systems, the highest polling candidate is elected to represent each single-member electoral district. This system differs from proportional representation, which features more elaborate voting procedures and multi-member electoral districts. As there can be only one winning candidate in each electoral district in First- past-the-post elections, there is an incentive for voters to support viable candidates and not \\"waste\\" their vote on hopefuls who have little chance of success. As a result, it is much harder for smaller parties to gain representation in parliament. Ultimately, there is a tendency for two-party systems to develop, as voters coalesce around potential winning candidates. This tendency is known as Duverger's law.Maurice Duverger (1972). Factors in a Two-Party and Multiparty System in Party Politics and Pressure Groups. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell. In this kind of political landscape, in which there are two viable political parties, party elites tend to favour \\"big tent\\" electoral strategies that appeal to a broad range of the electorate rather than aiming for an ideological niche. While curvilinear disparity is typically associated with the Anglo-American political experience, however, it can theoretically occur in any large party. Middle-elite / sub-leaders The party middle-elite consists of loyal party voters, party members, and regional or local office holders. Unlike the party elite, this stratum usually consists of volunteers and part-time members who are not as directly affected by the electoral success of the party. Since they willingly volunteer their free-time to political activism and campaigning, the middle-elite often tend to hold more deeply embedded ideological beliefs than both the party elite and non- elite (or floating voters). The middle-elite tend to be strongly emotionally and psychologically invested in politics and seek to project their ideological convictions to the party elite and the public at large.  Non-elite  The non-elite consists of ordinary voters who occasionally give the party their support. The non-elite are not as emotionally invested in the political process as the middle-elite and are less likely to be motivated by ideological concerns. It is considered to be the least ideological of the three strata, consisting of rational actors who support the party which adopts political stances closest to their own personal leanings (again, in concordance with the median voter theorem). Examples=The British Labour Party Under the leadership of Tony Blair, the British Labour Party shifted towards a market- oriented approach to political campaigning.Lees-Marshment, J. (2001). The Marriage of Politics and Marketing. Political Studies, 49(4), pp. 692-713. This caused an ideological fissure within the party between advocates of the New Labour approach and traditional supporters. In terms of electoral strategy, the New Labour approach involved tailoring the \\"political brand\\" of the party to suit the preferences of the electorate. These preferences were chiefly ascertained by focus group studies and opinion polls. In effect, market-oriented campaigning assisted the Labour Party in making its policies consistent with the preferences of the median voter. Many traditional supporters, however, resented what they regarded as the dilution of the ideological foundation of the party. Conversely, other senior Labour politicians argued against what they perceived to be the overly ideological policy positions of the pre-Blair era which had failed to take account of wider public opinion. Sir Gerald Kaufman, for example, famously described Labour's 1983 election manifesto as \\"the longest suicide note in history\\". Similarly, Charles Clarke, who was a supporter of Tony Blair and served as a minister in his government, described the difficulty in appeasing disaffected members as follows:Clarke, C. as quoted by Stadlen, N. (2006, December 7). Brief encounter: Tony Benn - Audio Podcast. Retrieved August 4, 2007, from Guardian Unlimited. > ‚ÄúIn the old days the idea of the Labour Party was defined by a series of > policy positions ‚Äì unilateral disarmament, exit from the European Union, > opposition to the sale of council houses and nationalisation. The question > then arose as to whether that range of policies were right for the current > era. The whole odyssey that the Labour Party took from 1979 to 1997 was an > attempt to face up to the fact that the electorate thought that these sets > of policies were not things that should govern this country. Some people > didn‚Äôt go down that odyssey of change and they remain as a group that is of > no significance at all in the political life of the country.‚Äù Using May's terminology, the advocates of the New Labour approach can be regarded as the party elite, whereas the disaffected members can be viewed as the middle-elite, with the latter being more ideologically motivated and less moderate than the former.Seyd, Patrick and Whiteley, Paul (1992). Labour's grass roots: the politics of party membership. p100. London: Oxford University Press The primary concern of the party elite was to ensure the future electability of the party, having learned lessons and modified policy in response to prior electoral failures. The main objective of the middle-elite, however, was to preserve the socialist ideological heritage of the party and represent its traditional core constituencies (i.e. unions and the working class), regardless of the electoral consequences. There are some inconsistencies involved, in transposing May's typology to this example. Some of the critics of the New Labour project (such as Tony Benn), for example, were members of parliament and therefore theoretically part of the party elite themselves.  Analysis and criticism  There is a lack of consensus among political scientists over the frequency and extent to which Curvilinear Disparity takes place. In a study by Kitschelt and Hellemans (1990), it is posited that whether Curvilinear Disparity occurs (and, if so, to what extent) depends on the degree to which \\"ideologues... capture less highly valued positions\\" within a party.Kitschelt H., Hellemans, S. (1990). \\"Beyond the European Left\\". Duke University Press. In an analysis of the subject by Norris (1995), however, British party elites were found on average to be more ideologically motivated than both the middle-elite and the non-elite, contrary to theoretical expectations.Norris, P. (1995). \\"May's Law of Curvilinear Disparity Revisited\\".

This count title of Alba de Liste dates from the middle of the fifteenth century, being awarded to Enrique Enriquez y Mendoza. Alba de Liste, a.k.a. Alba de Aliste, is a castle, absolutely ruined today, located near some 300 inhabitants, Losacino, 41¬∞41‚Ä≤N, 6¬∞05‚Ä≤W in the province of Zamora, Spain. His mother Maria Alvarez de Toledo y Pimentel was the maternal half-sister of Catalina, the wife of widower (previously left with 7 male and 7 female children), Diego Enriquez, 3rd count of Alba de Liste (circa 1490 ‚Äì 1550), and therefore we can conclude that as both sisters came from the 2nd duke of Alba, Garcia, deceased aged around 20, there was no great difference of age between them and then, probably, the 5th count, Diego, son of the 4th count, Enrique, eldest son of 7 males/7 females gotten by Diego Enriquez, 3rd count, was named Diego, for keeping remembrance of his grandfather Diego, the 3rd count. Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba Furthermore, as both sisters, Maria and Catalina, were daughters of the 2nd duke of Alba, they were also maternal half-sisters of the famous 3rd duke of Alba, Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, (√Åvila, Piedrah√≠ta, 19 October 1507 ‚Äì Lisbon, Portugal, 11 November 1582), a.k.a. \\"The Iron Duke\\", who married Maria Enriquez, daughter of the 3rd count of Alba de Liste, being thus the sister of the 4th count Enrique and the aunt of the 5th count, mentioned here as Diego Enr√≠quez de Guzm√°n, 5th count of Alba de Liste. Then, we can also deduce that the famously hard \\"Iron Duke\\", the 3rd Duke of Alba, Fernando, mentioned thereto, who married Mar√≠a Enriquez de Guzm√°n, a.k.a. Maria Enriquez, daughter of the 3rd count of Alba de Liste, was the sister of the 4th count, Enrique, and the aunt of the 5th count, mentioned here as Diego Enr√≠quez de Guzm√°n, 5th count of Alba de Liste. This 5th count married Maria de Urrea, but, apparently, there was no adult male issue. The title thus reverted to his uncle, Fadrique Enriquez, a name quite frequent in the Spanish medieval history and requiring thus extra care with delving in his life who was the 6th count of Alba de Liste, born around 1530, who married a Guiomar de Vilhena, perhaps a Portuguese woman. Some genealogists say however the 6th count was a certain Antonio Enriquez, deceased 1610, no issue. There were court cases on who inherited then the title. Then they say a Fadrique Enriquez became the 7h count after 1617 but died in 1632. New court cases gave the title of 8 count in 1633 to a Luis Enriquez, 2nd count of Villaflor, deceased, no issue, in 1667. Luis Enr√≠quez de Guzm√°n, 9th Count of Alba de Liste, a.k.a. Luis Enrique de Guzman y Coresma (circa 1610 ‚Äì circa 1680), was the 9th count of Alba de Liste, Viceroy of Mexico (1650‚Äì1653) and 17th Viceroy of Peru (1655‚Äì1661). Then, new court cases again in 1709 gave the title, 13, Count of Alba de Liste, in a sentence of 1713, to the 10th count-duke of Benavente Antonio Francisco de Pimentel, deceased 1743, a.k.a. Antonio Francisco Pimentel de Z√∫√±iga y Vigil de Qui√±ones, XIII count of de Benavides, XV count of Mayorga, XIII count of Luna, VI marquis of Jabalquinto, V marquis of Villareal de Perullena, also XIII count of Alba de Liste, who married first Maria Ignacia de Borja y Arag√≥n, daughter of the 10th Duke of Gand√≠a hija del X duque de Gand√≠a etc. and then with Marie Philippe de Horne, daughter of the count of Houtekerche. New legal fights because of the inheritance of titles to be held by the 12th Duchess of Benavente who had however already no less than six dukedoms and many more other lesser titles, (marquess, countess, Vicomtesse) and the blocking of inheritance of this title at that time for some females gave them in 1772 to the transfer of the title to the \\"Fern√°ndez de Velasco\\" family, dukes of Fr√≠as. Then, it was used by the \\"T√©llez-Gir√≥n\\" family, dukes of Osuna, reaching later, in the case of the 21st Count, the \\"Martorell\\" family, through Gabino de Martorell y T√©llez-Gir√≥n, 17th duke of Escalona, (Madrid, 22 October 1894 ‚Äì deceased Madrid, 13 November 1918) changing family name, finally, because of a marriage between a Martorell female, 23rd Countess, and the \\"Vi√±amata\\" family, Luis Vi√±amata y Emmanueli, deceased on 30 November 1981, well inside the second half of the 20th century.

Personal life Lorin Stein was born and raised in Washington, D.C., where he attended the Sidwell Friends School. He graduated from Yale College in 1995. In 1996 he received an MA from the Johns Hopkins Writing Seminars, where he served as a teaching fellow. Stein currently resides in New York City and is married to the writer and editor Sadie Stein, who worked at the Paris Review from 2011 to 2014. His sister is the literary agent Anna Stein. Career After brief tenures as a contributing editor at Might and Publishers Weekly, Stein was hired by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 1998 as an editorial assistant. He was eventually promoted to senior editor. In 2008, FSG published his translation of Gr√©goire Bouillier's memoir The Mystery Guest. Stein succeeded Philip Gourevitch as the fourth editor of The Paris Review in April 2010. In 2015 he translated into English the bestselling novel Submission by French author Michel Houellebecq. He has translated two books by √âdouard Louis: History of Violence (2018) and Who Killed My Father (2019).  Sex scandal and resignation  In October 2017 the Paris Review board started an internal investigation which heard complaints from 'at least two female writers' alleging 'negative encounters' with Stein. It was reported in the New York Times that Stein 'often complimented women on their appearance and suggested they invite attractive friends to [Paris Review] parties'. One writer alleged she had a consensual sexual relationship with Stein, including having sex in his office, and thought that their breakup might have affected Stein's judgment of her work. Her agent confirmed she'd been told of the relationship in 2013. Stein strongly denies ever having taken looks or relationship status into consideration when approving stories. Another woman in publishing claimed that, a decade earlier, Stein had touched her at a work dinner in an inappropriate way, including touching her knee several times, sliding his hand up her skirt and touching her underwear. She said she had to request to move to a different seat to get him to stop. A friend and her boyfriend at the time confirmed she had spoken to them about the encounter when it happened. On December 6, 2017, Stein resigned. In his letter of resignation, he wrote: \\"I blurred the personal and the professional in ways that were, I now recognize, disrespectful of my colleagues and our contributors, and that made them feel uncomfortable or demeaned.\\" Stein acknowledged dating and 'expressing interest in women with whom he had professional connections, including interns and writers for the magazine', conduct that he acknowledged was ‚Äúan abuse of my position.‚Äù He wrote that the \\"way I behaved was hurtful, degrading and infuriating to a degree that I have only begun to understand this past month.\\" However, Stein maintains that all sexual relations and contact was consensual. He also left his editor-at-large role at Farrar Straus & Giroux.

He lived in Toronto, Ontario with his wife Clare and their children. His 1958 recording Kane is Able was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Performance by an Orchestra or Instrumentalist with Orchestra. He was highly active as an arranger and music director for Canadian television during the 1950s. His career was cut short by his death from cancer at the age of 36. The Canadian Encyclopedia states, \\"At the time of his death, Kane was considered one of Canada's leading arrangers. He later was honoured by a Canadian Talent Library Trust LP of his big band arrangements, under the direction of Bert Niosi.\\" Life Born John Kane in London, he was the son of British music-hall entertainer Barry Kane. In 1933 he moved with his family to Canada where he began appearing as a singer with his father in vaudeville performances in Toronto at the age of 9. A year later he won a performance contest at the Roxy Theatre. In 1939 Kane entered the Toronto Conservatory of Music where he studied the clarinet with Herbert Pye through 1942. He began performing with the High Timers band in the early 1940s, making his radio debut with the group in 1941. From 1942-1945 he played in the Band of the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals and in 1945-1946 he led his own band, the Khaki Kollegians, which performed in entertainments for the Canadian Army. After the end of World War II, Kane resumed his musical studies with John Weinzweig with whom he studied music composition from 1946-1948. During these years he composed his first concert works, including two interludes for woodwinds (1947) and a string quartet (1948). He also actively performed with a number of orchestras associated with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation during the mid to late 1940s. In 1949 he was appointed assistant arranger-conductor to Howard Cable at the CBC. During the early 1950s, Kane began to compose his first larger orchestral works, such as Suite for Orchestra (1950), Concerto for Saxophone (1951), and a symphony which he began but never finished. In 1950 he was appointed chief arranger for the CBC Radio program Startime and in 1951 he was awarded the Maurice Rosenfeld Prize for promising newcomer to Canadian radio. He became actively involved as a music director for CBC Television, serving in that capacity for such shows as On Stage (1954), The Jackie Rae Show (1955), and Summertime '57'. He also worked as a music director in the United States during the late 1950s for CBS and NBC, using his talents for shows starring Eydie Gorm√©, Steve Lawrence, Ethel Merman, and Andy Williams. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Kane had his own orchestra with the CBC for which he arranged/composed much of their repertoire in addition to serving as the group's conductor. The ensemble played on their own show, the Jack Kane Show, and for other programs. The orchestra made several recordings; the first of which, Kane is Able, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Performance by an Orchestra or Instrumentalist with Orchestra.

It is long north and south, wide at the ends, and through the centre. It is built on about 3,000 piles, fully secured against decay; the construction throughout is fireproof and of the very best kind. Custom House, Boston, India St., 1850 :The exterior of the building is purely Grecian Doric, not a copy, but adapted to the exigencies and peculiarities of the structure, and consists of a portico [overhang] of 6 columns on each side, on a high flight of steps, and an order of engaged columns around the walls, 20 in number, on a high stylobate or basement; the order of engaged columns terminating with 4 andae [pilasters] at their intersection with the porticos. The columns are in diameter and high, the shaft being in one place, each weighing about 42 tons. :The cellar, which is high to the crown of the arches, is principally used for the storage of goods, which are conveyed to it through the basement story. The steam apparatus for warming the whole building (which it does effectively) is situated in the cellar, having easy access to the coal vaults under the sidewalk outside of the building. Cross-section of the 1837 design of the Custom House. Custom House, 19th century :The principal entrances to the basement story are at each end. They are for the receipt of goods for storage. Near the northwest corner, on the west side, is the entrance to the Night Inspectors' apartments, also to the private staircase leading to the Collector's room and the attic. South of the west portico is the entrance to the heating apparatus room, and on the south end is the entrance to the Custom House Truckmen's room. This story consists of rooms for the Night Inspectors, Custom House Truckmen, and Engineer of the Heating Apparatus, also three sets of Water Closets: the remainder is used for storage of goods, weigher's tabs, etc. :The principal ingress to the entrance story is through the porticos, but it can be entered from the Collector's private staircase, and from two other private staircases in the basement. This story contains apartments and offices for the Assistant Treasurer, the Weighers and Gaugers, the Measurers, Inspectors, Markers, Superintendent of Building, etc. In the centre is a large vestibule, from which two broad flights of steps lead to the principal story, landing in two smaller vestibules therein, lighted by skylights in the roof, and these vestibules communicate with all the apartments in this story. The several rooms are for the Collector, Assistant Collector, Naval Officer, Surveyor, Public Store Keeper, their Deputies and Clerks; and for the facilities of doing business this arrangement is not surpassed.

He was the son of Theodore Martine, a grocer and realtor, descended from French Huguenot immigrants. In 1900, his niece, Mary Martine Carew, was shot by an ex-convict after Mrs. Carew rebuffed his advances. He graduated from Columbia College in 1865, and from Columbia Law School in 1866. Career After his graduation from law school, he was admitted to the bar and practiced law with the firm, Flanagan, Bright & Martine, which dissolved not long thereafter, at which point he practiced on his own for several years before partnering with Charles A. Jackson under the name Jackson & Martine (with offices in the Morse Building). Martine was a member of Tammany Hall but left in 1881, following the expulsion of Fire Commissioner Henry D.

He served in the Republic of Korea Army from 1948 to 1981, after which he served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs until 1986. Some sources also give his name as Yu Byung-hyun, Lew Byung-hyun, Lew Byong-hion, or Lew Byong-hyon. Military career Lew graduated from the 7th class of the Korea Military Academy in 1948. He was promoted to brigadier-general in 1961. He was a supporter of Park Chung-hee's coup in May that year, and was rewarded for his loyalty with a post in Park's junta as Minister of Agriculture after the resignation of Major General Chang Kyu-soon in June 1963. Lew continued in his military posts as well; from September 1966 to September 1967, he was Commander of the \\"Tiger\\" Division in Vietnam. Among other operations, he was responsible for the controversial evacuation of civilians from the mountains of Phu Cat District in 1966. After his return from Vietnam, Lew became the Director of Planning and Operations (ÏûëÏ†ÑÍ∏∞ÌöçÎ∂ÄÏû•) under the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He was widely noted for his 1968 prediction that North Korea would launch an all-out attack on South Korea, \\"whether it be today or in years to come\\", though Charles H. Bonesteel III disagreed with his assessment. Lew continued his rise through the ranks, finally being promoted to daejang in 1977. In that capacity, he inaugurated the ROK-US Combined Forces Command in 1978 and served as its first deputy commander. In December 1979, Lew additionally became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. As Chairman, Lew visited the United States in November 1980 at the invitation of U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman David C. Jones. While there, he met with then-President-elect Ronald Reagan's national security advisor Richard V. Allen regarding Kim Dae-jung, who was facing capital punishment on charges of sedition for his role in the Gwangju Uprising; this was the first step in a diplomatic push by Reagan that would ultimately see Kim's death sentence commuted. He held the position of Chairman until his retirement from the military in 1981. Civilian career After his retirement, Lew continued working for the South Korean government in civilian positions. He was named South Korea's eleventh ambassador to the United States in May 1981, succeeding Kim Yong-shik. Among other duties there, he continued to keep a close eye on Kim Dae-jung, who had gone into exile in the United States in 1982 after his prison sentence was suspended. He remained in Washington D.C. until 1985, thereafter becoming the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' ambassador-at-large until 1986.

Wandsworth, London, Vol. 15, Page 911 was an Irish blues rock musician, best known for his role as drummer with Rory Gallagher in the early 1970s. Career=Early career Campbell played with Belfast band The Method, who moved to London in 1968 and became Andwella's Dream. He played on only one track, \\"Felix\\", on their debut album Love and Poetry, which band leader Dave Lewis called \\"the best drumming on the album\\", before returning home to be with his wife and children. In Belfast he joined Deep Joy, also including bass guitarist Gerry McAvoy, who supported Rory Gallagher's band Taste on tour in 1970. Both Campbell and McAvoy were recruited by Gallagher in 1971 for his new solo project after the break-up of Taste. Campbell was married at this time and living with his family in Streatham, London. Rory Gallagher While with Gallagher, Campbell performed on the albums Rory Gallagher, Deuce and Live in Europe. With the increased touring that followed the success of the albums, Campbell developed a fear of flying and missed two concerts during a short tour of Ireland, being replaced by Rod de'Ath from the band Killing Floor. A month later, Campbell refused to leave his house to fly to a concert in Lausanne, Switzerland, and was again replaced by de'Ath. Three weeks later in June 1972, Campbell left Gallagher's band by mutual consent and was permanently replaced by de'Ath. After a few shows, Gallagher expanded his lineup by adding Killing Floor's keyboard player Lou Martin, who stayed for five years. According to McAvoy, Martin was recruited to help fill out the band's sound as de'Ath was not as technically proficient as Campbell. Later career After he left Gallagher, Campbell played with the Mick Abrahams Band before joining Tony McPhee's band Terraplane, and then formed The Wildcats, which later featured Gary Fletcher. He also played with Billy Boy Arnold, and in 1976 he joined the 1950s-style rock and roll band Yakety Yak, with whom he stayed until 1980, recording one single with them in that time. In 1981 several members of Yakety Yak, including Campbell, formed another 1950s-style band called the Dragons, who subsequently changed their name to Sonny King & the Sons of Swing in 1982. Campbell continued to play with them till 1987, though occasionally they used Geoff Britton when Campbell was unable to participate. During 1982‚Äì84, Campbell also played with another of McPhee's bands, The Groundhogs. Campbell also played in the Nickey Barclay band in London in the 1980s, which included Barclay (ex-Fanny) and Lou Martin on keyboards, with John ConroyJohn Conroy's Story (ex-Sam Mitchell Band) and Dave Ball on lead guitar (ex-Procol Harum). The band played across London on the blues rock circuit during the 1980s at venues including The White Lion, Putney; The Star and Garter on Lower Richmond Road; The Golden Lion, Fulham and the Cartoon, Croydon. Campbell worked with the South London-based band \\"Sailin¬¥ Shoes\\" with guitarist and singer Steve Boyce, bassist Bill Adey and keyboard player John Cooke. Death Campbell died in 1989 after suffering from alcohol-related illnesses. According to McAvoy, Campbell had never been a heavy drinker until the break-up of his marriage, which coincided with the onset of his fear of flying. Previously a fit person involved in cricket and football, his health started to deteriorate as his drinking habits changed \\"from virtually nothing to hard spirits, and lots of it, in a very short space of time\\".

In 2010 an online publication launched using the name. 17th century A short-lived predecessor, the Mercurius Caledonius, published for just twelve issues in 1660‚Äì1661, is believed to have been Scotland's first newspaper. 18th and 19th centuries The Caledonian Mercury was launched in 1720. Like its competitor The Edinburgh Evening Courant, The Caledonian Mercury, appeared three times a week, until 1867. It was less prestigious than the Courant, largely because it was sold by a politically- motivated bookseller and because its editors did not include recent news from elsewhere in Britain and Europe. In 1725, during the Scottish Malt Tax riots, rival political factions attempted to use newspapers like the Caledonian Mercury as their \\"mouthpieces\\", as a letter from Andrew Millar to Robert Wodrow illustrates. From 1729 to 1772, it was owned and run by Thomas Ruddiman and his family, before being taken over by John Robertson. It was described by Robert Chambers as \\"the first [newspaper] in Scotland which blended literary criticism with political matter.\\" Notable contributors included James Boswell. In 1815, the paper was purchased by Thomas Allen & Co from 265 High Street, on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. Numbers published from 1800 on are available online for registered users of the National Library of Scotland website. Historical copies of the Caledonian Mercury, dating back to 1720, are available to search and view in digitized form at The British Newspaper Archive. 21st century In January 2010, a Scottish online newspaper launched which had the name Caledonian Mercury. It was set up by Stewart Kirkpatrick (formerly responsible for The Scotsman website), Graham Jones and Tony Purcell.

First rising to fame in 2010 with hits such as Dafa Hoja and Bruah, Foji has continued with a number of successful releases and has featured in the top 3 of the Official Asian Download Chart for longer than any other bhangra artist (12 weeks).http://www.theofficialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/44/2010/ Foji Gill was sentenced to five years imprisonment for committing offences related to money laundering in April 2015 until January 2019. Early life Brought up in Birmingham, Foji started singing at the age of eight. During a trip to India aged thirteen he learnt to read and write Punjabi and was exposed to the work of a number of Punjabi artists. Influences listed including classic Punjabi singers Lal Chand Yamla Jatt, Surinder Kaur, Amar Singh Chamkila, Didar Sandhu, K Deep and Jagmohan Kaur, as well as a sequence of more recent artists such as Kuldip Manak, Jagjit Singh, Satinder Sartaaj, Ustaad Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and Gurdas Mann (who Foji also interviewed in September 2010 on behalf of radio stationList of radio stations in the United Kingdom#Community radio stations Raaj FM). One of Foji's first songs was a humorous reworking of Golden Stars 'Lumbra De Vere Vich', whilst studying at Solihull College. In the same year, Foji joined popular Bhangra dance group Nachda Sansaar as a freestyle and traditional Bhangra dancer, subsequently progressing to front vocalist. He performed with the group for 10 years, with appearances including the Eurovision Song Contest 1998, the 24th G8 summit, and BBC's The Generation Game and Goodness Gracious Me (BBC)., Foji further honed his vocal range and skills further under the guidance of Indian classical musician and vocalist Soni Atwal and has also trained with Punjabi ghazal singer and music director Surinder Khan to develop his vocal range and harmonium skills to develop a deeper understanding of Indian classical music. Career After releasing his first single, Bondhlgai in late 2009, Foji's second single, Dafa Hoja with top selling Punjabi female vocalist Miss Pooja, released in February 2010 and became one of the most successful singles in the Official Asian Download Chart, with both tracks featuring in the inaugural chart. Dafa Hoja enjoyed an unbroken and unprecedented 16-week spell in the top 10, and with Rahat Fateh Ali Khan's ‚ÄòSajda‚Äô dropping out of the top 40 on 11 September, Dafa Hoja became the last single to remain in the chart since featuring in the first official countdown in March.Official Charts On 24 July 2010, Foji's third single Bruah became the first original Bhangra single by a solo artist to top the Official Asian Download Chart. His fourth release, a tribute to the Punjabi freedom fighter Bhagat Singh, was released in August 2010. Despite featuring within the iTunes top 100 downloads within the World music category at one point, and receiving critical acclaim in The Times of India, the track which may be seen as containing some politically sensitive lyrics was not featured in the Official Asian Download Chart on BBC radio. Foji's debut album, Dafa Hoja, was released on 30 September 2010. Foji finished the year with a Christmas release, Peja's Kristmus. Recognisable by his trademark royal blue tracksuit and white turban, the comedy character Peja appeared in the animated video for the song, as well as in the Foji's Dafa Hoja, Bruah, and later Pumbeeri videos. A short humorous take on Jingle Bells, reaching number 14 in the chart following Christmas weekOfficial Charts made Peja's Kristmus the joint highest ever re-entry into the chart, until Jaswinder Daghamia's Teri Toor re-entered at number 9 in April 2011.Official Charts After the retro Punjabi ‚Äòakaara‚Äô style video for Dafa Hoja, then a spoof of the common Punjabi house party videos for Bruah (replacing partygoers, frolics and alcohol with children, mischief and milk), and the historic epic depicted in Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Foji maintained his penchant for original music videos with his February 2011 release, Pumbeeri. The video consists of a Flash Mob-style dance routine performed amongst unsuspecting shoppers at the Bull Ring, Birmingham on a busy Saturday afternoon. The track gave Foji another Asian Download Chart number one, joining only the Billboard Hot 100 topping MOBO Awards nominee Jay Sean, and music producer Punjabi By Nature, in having three top 2 hits on the chart. After his release from prison, foji made a comeback with his single Sher Di Poosh.

Church is located in Davenport, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History Rear view of the building. The African Methodist Episcopal Church congregation was founded in Davenport in November 1865 and it was incorporated on January 1, 1866. Their first location was at the corner of Fourth and Gaines Street. Not only was it the first of several small churches that were founded by the Black community in Davenport after the conclusion of the American Civil War, it was the first in the State of Iowa. The black community itself was relatively small and scattered in Davenport until the 1920s. (pages 1-30 of PDF document) Northwest and north-central Davenport, the Fulton Addition, and McClellan Heights (pages 30-69 of PDF document) The trustees were Emanuel Franklin, P.C. Cooper, Hy Simon and William Van Duzer. The property at the corner of Eleventh and Ripley Streets was purchased in 1875 for $1,800. In 1909 the congregation finished the current church building in the heart of the city's African- American Community, which at the time had grown to 50 congregants.Svendsen. 11-3. Before its completion, services were held in the building's basement. At the time it was constructed the congregation changed its name to Bethel A.M.E. Church. William W. Williams was the pastor during this period. Architecture The Davenport architectural firm of Clausen & Clausen designed the building using two styles that are typically found in home construction: Bungalow and American Craftsman styles. The choice seems appropriate for a denomination that emphasizes simplicity and avoidance of ceremony and symbolism. The building also features round-arch, stained glass windows that recall the Romanesque Revival style, and more typical of ecclesiastical architecture, rather than rectilinear windows. The interior features barrel vaulting over the nave and a domed apse in the back of the sanctuary. ReferencesExternal links *Bethel A.M.E.

He was the son of Manes and the father of Lydus, after whom the Lydian people were later named. Herodotus recounts that Maeonia was beset by severe famine during Atys' reign. To help them endure hunger, the Maeonians developed various expedients including dice, knucklebones and ball games. The idea was that they would eat every other day only. On the interim days when they fasted, they would play games all day to distract their minds from hunger. Herodotus says they lived like that for eighteen years. Eventually, Atys decided to halve the population, one half to remain in Maeonia and the other half to leave and found a colony elsewhere. Lots were drawn and Atys appointed himself to stay while one of his sons, Tyrrhenus, led the colonists to Umbria where they settled and became known as Tyrrhenians. The native Greco-Lydian historian Xanthus, who wrote in Ionian Greek slightly after Herodotus on the history of Lydia known as Lydiaca (ŒõœÖŒ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∫Œ¨), though his work survives only in fragments, also affirmed that King Atys was father to two sons, Lydus and Torubus, who he says parted company, splitting the Maeonian nation into two, Lydians and \\"Torubians\\".

West Syriac liturgies represent one of the major strains in Syriac Christianity, the other being the East Syriac Rite, the liturgy of the Church of the East and its descendants. Distinct West Syriac liturgies developed following the Council of Chalcedon (451), which largely divided the Christian community in Antioch into Melkites, who supported the Emperor and the Council and adopted the Byzantine Rite, and the non-Chalcedonians, who rejected the council and developed an independent liturgy ‚Äì the West Syriac Rite. An independent West Syriac community that grew around the monastery of Saint Maron eventually developed into the Maronite Church, which uses its own Maronite Rite. A variant of the West Syriac Rite, the Malankara Rite, developed in the Malankara Church of India and is still used in its descendant churches.

Born in Salford, Lancashire, he was the son of a timber merchant and was educated at Chester. Career By 1823 he was a partner in Gregson and Bury's steam sawmill at Toxteth Park, Liverpool, but in 1826 he set himself up as an iron-founder and engineer. His original premises were in Tabley Street near the Liverpool and Manchester Railway's workshops. He hoped to supply locomotives to that line, but opposition from the L&M; Engineer, George Stephenson, thwarted this. Clarence Foundry & Steam Engine Works He moved his works to new premises in Love Lane, Liverpool, on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and near the Clarence Dock, hence the name 'Clarence Foundry and Steam Engine Works'. Around this time he recruited as his manager James Kennedy, who had gained locomotive building experience working for George Stephenson and Mather, Dixon and Company. The first locomotive built by Edward Bury and Company, Dreadnought, was intended to compete in the Rainhill Trials, but could not be finished in time. It was a 0-6-0 and did some ballasting work on the L&MR; but is said to have been objected to because it was on six wheels. It was sold to the Bolton and Leigh Railway in 1831. Liverpool, as built for the Liverpool & Manchester Railway in 1830 with 6-foot wheels. Bury's second locomotive Liverpool was on four wheels, and was tried on the Liverpool & Manchester but the objection this time was to the size of the wheels, 6 feet in diameter, described as \\"dangerous\\" by George Stephenson. The wheels were reduced to 4 feet 6 inches, but this engine also went to the Bolton & Leigh. Thereafter, Bury only succeeded in selling one engine, Liver, to the Liverpool & Manchester Railway. Liverpool combined near-horizontal inside cylinders with a multitubular boiler and a round, dome-topped firebox, mounted on a simple wrought-iron bar-frame inside the wheels, rather than wooden outside frames and inside iron sub-frames. This was a well thought-out and advanced design, which lasted. Most subsequent Bury locomotives followed this same basic design, which was copied by other firms, in Europe and the U.S.A. London & Birmingham Railway In 1836 Bury became the Contractor for Locomotive Power on the new London & Birmingham Railway; the railway company would provide locomotives to Bury's specification, while he would maintain them in good repair and convey each passenger at a farthing per mile, and each ton of goods at one halfpenny per mile; the passenger trains to be limited to 12 carriages and the speed not to exceed 22.5 mph. This system never worked in practice and in July 1839 the contract was annulled, and Bury became the Manager of the Locomotive Department, paid in the normal way, with a profit-linked bonus. At first he adopted a firm policy of using only 4-wheeled engines. Of the original L&BR; stock of 90 engines, Bury's firm built exactly half. Birmingham and Gloucester Railway In 1838 Bury was appointed as locomotive agent and advisor to the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway (B&GR;). Bury immediately sourced two secondhand locomotives and the building of four Forrester singles. Bury refused to supply locomotives for the steep Lickey Incline, though was contracted to design a stationary engine for the slope. The B&GR;'s engineer Captain Moorsom overrode Bury and purchased from Norris Locomotive Works of America not only bank engines for Lickey Incline but further locomotives for the railway as well.{{SfnpMaggs2013pp=102‚Äì104} Bury, Curtis and Kennedy London and Birmingham Railway Centenary, 1938 souvenir from the LMS illustrating the 2-2-0 locomotive of Edward Bury After taking into partnership his manager James Kennedy, together with Timothy Abraham Curtis and John Vernon, the firm was renamed Bury, Curtis and Kennedy in 1842. London & North Western Railway The L&BR; became part of the London & North Western Railway in 1846; Bury continued as Locomotive Superintendent of the Southern Division of the L&NWR;, but resigned with effect from March 1847. Great Northern Railway He became Locomotive Engineer on the new Great Northern Railway in February 1848 and created such a good impression that in June 1849 he was also appointed General Manager of the line. After a (possibly malicious) accusation that he had placed a small order for ironwork with a firm with which he was associated, he resigned from the G.N.R. in March 1850. Bedford, Burys & Co In 1852 he went into partnership in a Sheffield steelworks with Charles Cammell, and in 1855 he started another steelworks with his son, William Tarleton Bury, and John Bedford, as Bedford, Burys & Co, Regent Works, Sheffield. He had advised on the building of three railway towns, Swindon, Wolverton and Doncaster. Honours His engineering achievements were recognised when in 1844 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was also a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, a Member of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers, and a Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Family He married on 4 March 1830 Priscilla Susan Falkner (1799‚Äì1872), a botanist and illustrator and daughter of a wealthy Liverpool merchant. Between 1852 and 1860, Bury and his family lived at Hillsborough Hall. A plaque by the front door of the present- day building commemorates the family's residency. Death He retired to Croft Lodge, Ambleside, but became ill in 1858 and died on 25 November at Scarborough. He was buried there. In 1860 his widow published an account of her husband, Recollections of Edward Bury, Fellow of the Royal Society, Member of the institute of Civil Engineers, Member of the Smeatonian Society, Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, Fellow of the Royal Historic Society by his widow.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History=Development of the Methodist Church in Davenport The beginning of the Methodist Church in Davenport can be traced to the arrival of the Rev. E. C. Gavit of the Ohio Conference who was sent to minister among the Sac and Fox tribes in 1835. He was also instructed to visit White settlements along the way and from them, he was to receive his financial support. While he resided in the area that would become Davenport, his missionary territory stretched from the Missouri state border to St. Anthony Falls in Minnesota, which is in present-day Minneapolis. In August 1836 the Methodist Society was organized in Rockingham, Iowa, the present southwest side of Davenport, with the assistance of the Illinois Conference. It consisted of seven or eight people. D.C. James had been assigned to the Rock Island District and preached at Rockingham. Later that year the Rockingham Circuit was formed. The circuit included an area of about . It stretched from the Iowa River on the south to the Wapsipinicon River on the north and went inland to where ever there was a White settlement. Chauncey Hobart was put in charge of the circuit. The first services in the city of Davenport itself were held in the spring of 1837 at the house of D.D. Eldridge. The missionary E.C. Gavit led the service and preached. The first organized church in Davenport started in 1839 when William L. Cook was authorized to form a church organization. He found seven people and they formed the first class in Davenport. In a year it would grow to 20 members. Rev. Francis H. Chenowith was sent to be the first preacher in Davenport and a church building was begun in 1841 on the west side of Perry Street between Fourth and Fifth Streets. The small structure was built of brick and measured . The congregation took the name Davenport Methodist Episcopal Church and later First Methodist Episcopal Church. The congregation continued to grow and in 1853 plans were drawn up for a new church building at the corner of Fifth and Brady Streets. The new building was completed the following summer, and a parsonage was built soon after. In 1856 Wesley Chapel was formed with 60 members. The parent church had 375 members. The congregation continued to grow and it was decided their church building was again too small. In 1867 property was purchased on top of the hill at the corner of 14th and Brady Streets. The Fourteenth Street Methodist Episcopal Church was formed at that location. Other small congregations also formed from the main church: Spring Street Church, Cook Chapel, and Gilruth Chapel. In 1873 a new main church was built further up Brady Street because the trains on 5th Street created too much noise. St. John‚Äôs Church The Center, which houses St. John's outreach ministries. In 1899 First Methodist Episcopal Church and Fourteenth Street Methodist Episcopal Church were reorganized into Central Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1902 the cornerstone of the present church building was laid at the 14th and Brady location. Parke T. Burrows was the designing architect and Frederick G. Clausen was the superintending architect. The new building was dedicated on December 13, 1903, as St. John's. It was built at a cost of $112,000. The church building has a large rectangular sanctuary and an imposing corner tower. In the early 20th century it had a congregation of 1,030 and a Sunday School of 623 pupils. Other Methodist congregations were formed in the 20th century: Grace (1925), Faith, and Christ (1965). St. John's has remained the largest congregation. The church property expanded in the 21st century when the church renovated a former furniture store across 14th Street. Called The Center, it created more space to expand the church's outreach ministries. An alternative worship site was created at Wertz Funeral Home at Kimberly and Jersey Ridge Roads. The location moved in 2007 to Eisenhower Elementary School. Architecture The parsonage can be seen on the right. St. John's is a cruciform-plan structure with a prominent corner tower. The building is constructed of limestone in the English Gothic style. Instead of the soaring verticality, which is typical of a Gothic style church, St. John's presents a relatively low profile. with This is emphasized in its strong horizontal masonry coursing and the massing of solid, geometrical forms. The main entrance into the church is located beneath the arched tower base. Large tracery windows dominate the west, north and south elevations. Lancet windows are found throughout the structure. A parsonage is located to the south of the church building and is constructed of the same materials. An education building is attached to the southeast corner of the sanctuary. Pipe organ The M.P. Moller (Op. 9404, 1960) pipe organ features a traditional style console with roll top. It is equipped with three manuals, four divisions, 40 stops, 26 registers, 33 ranks, 1998 pipes and electro-pneumatic (EP) unit chests. The manual compass is 61 notes and the pedal compass is 32 notes. The drawknobs are organized in vertical rows on angled jambs. The balanced swell shoes/pedals are in standard AGO placement. The combination action is a remote pneumatic/mechanical capture system. Rounding out the features are AGO Standard (concave radiating) pedalboard, reversible full organ/tutti thumb piston, reversible full organ/tutti toe stud, combination action thumb pistons, and coupler reversible toe studs.

Juan Bautista V√°zquez el Viejo (1510 in Pelayos, province of Salamanca Castile and Leon ‚Äì 12 June 1588 in Llerena, province of Badajoz, Extremadura, Spain) was a Spanish sculptor.  Biography  Born in Pelayos (province of Salamanca), as a small child he moved with his family to √Åvila, where the lived adjacent to the main market square. He first learned his art there in the studio of Vasco de la Zarza. It is believed that he then went to Italy, where his style became more elegant. In 1554 he moved to Toledo, where he executed various works for the Cathedral, the church of Santa Mar√≠a la Blanca, and the church of Almonacid de Zorita (province of Guadalajara), among others. In 1558, Francisca Bl√°zquez, widow of sculptor Isidro de Villoldo, brought him back to √Åvila to complete the figures of the main altarpiece of the Charterhouse of Seville, which Villodo had left unfinished at his death. In 1561 he moved to Seville to complete the altarpiece. He settled there, putting together an important studio with collaborators including his brother-in-law and carver Juan de Oviedo the Elder, Miguel de Ad√°n, Gaspar del √Åguila, and Jer√≥nimo Hern√°ndez. This studio would play a major role in establishing and consolidating the Sevillian school of sculpture. They made major contributions to the second phase of the main altarpiece of the Cathedral of Seville, as well as the Church of Saint Mary in Carmona (1563), the Church of Saint Matthew in Lucena (1572), the Church of Saint Mary in Medina Sidonia (1575); he also sculpted the Virgin of the Fevers () in Seville's Church of Saint Mary Magdalene. He married three times: to Andrea Hern√°ndez, sister of Juan de Oviedo the Elder; to Mar√≠a de Bonilla, daughter of the Sevillian painter Juan de Zamora; and to Isabel de Vald√©s. He died in Llerena (province of Badajoz). His work was continued by his son Juan Bautista V√°zquez the Younger.  References  * Jane Turner (Editor).

She made her first on-screen appearance on 31 August 2001. The character was originally played by Raine Davison from 2001 to 2006. In early 2010, series producer Gavin Blyth recast the role and Shaw took over. Eve was introduced as the granddaughter of Edna Birch (Shirley Stelfox). In April 2011, it was announced that Shaw had quit her role of Eve and she departed on 2 August 2011. Casting On 10 July 2001, Rick Fulton of the Daily Record reported that seventeen-year-old actress Davison had joined the cast as Eve alongside Sammy Winward, who plays Katie Sugden. Fulton said the girls would \\"set pulses racing among Emmerdale's teenage bratpack.\\" Davison was introduced as the rebellious granddaughter of established character, Edna Birch (Shirley Stelfox). Of joining Emmerdale, Davison said \\"Imagine how I felt when I won a part in my favourite soap. Eve is a strong-willed girl and is a part I can really get my teeth into.\\" A show spokesman said Davison and Winward were launched together to show viewers that they have strong teenage storylines for their teenage following. Davison made her debut screen appearance as Eve on 31 August 2001. She remained a series regular until her departure in 2002. Davison was seen again on the show in October 2006, when Edna attended Eve's wedding to James Jenson. Recast In January 2010, it was announced that Eve would be returning to the show after a nearly four-year absence with a new actress in the role. Series producer Gavin Blyth stated in an interview with Digital Spy that he auditioned 50 to 60 actresses for the role, one of them being former Hear'Say singer and West End theatre star Suzanne Shaw who made the trip to Yorkshire from Manchester where she was playing Judy Haynes in the musical White Christmas. The decision to cast Shaw was announced on 29 January. Shaw signed a year-long contract and debuted on 2 April 2010. Suzanne Shaw has described Eve as \\"feisty and very flirtatious. She's been left with a lot of debt in France and she turns up in the Dales because she has nowhere else to go - she knows that Edna's a real soft touch and wouldn't leave her own family at the front door. Eve does lie to start with because she doesn't want anyone to know why she's actually there - she doesn't want to let everyone know that she's failed again. Edna finds out the truth, though, and demands to know why she lied. Because she's going through a break-up, she deals with it by flirting with the men of the village. She finds it easier to get on with guys than girls - she's quite sarcastic and to-the-point.\\" Discussing the audition proses Shaw said \\"I got asked before Christmas to audition for the part of Eve. I was asked to do a screen test, but it got snowed off because of all the bad weather over Christmas. I didn't hear anything for ages and I thought it wasn't going to happen, and then just a few weeks before I started filming they offered me the part. It was a lovely surprise. They auditioned quite a lot of actresses for the role. I was up against some strong contenders so it was quite nerve-wracking when I went in, but Gavin Blyth, the producer, was so lovely and made me feel really at ease.\\" Character development=Affair with Carl King In 2010, it was revealed that Eve would have an affair with Carl King, played by Tom Lister. Commenting on the storyline, Shaw said \\"I was really excited when I found out Eve would be having an affair with Carl but I quickly realised it would make me very unpopular with the majority of Emmerdale fans because everyone loves Carl and Chas together. So I‚Äôm preparing myself for all the trouble it‚Äôs going to cause. It‚Äôs a great storyline and I have no idea how it will all turn out. There‚Äôs also the small matter of Chas. It‚Äôs going to take some doing for Carl to keep it from her. It would be a brave or a stupid man who tests Chas but Carl seems determined to give it a go and Eve certainly isn‚Äôt one to hold back. One thing‚Äôs for sure, if Chas does uncover Carl‚Äôs dirty secret he‚Äôll be wise to sleep with one eye open!\\" Eve and Carl have an affair.(2010) In September 2010 Shaw and Lister teased of the storyline Shaw said \\"Quite a bit. We don't quite know what's going to happen around Christmas time but there's something juicy coming up.\\" also Lister said \\"It's all going well so far. I'm having a great time and I think it's going to play out a bit longer. We'll see whether he gets found out or not.\\" Lucy Pargeter, who plays Chas hinted that her firebrand alter ego may react in a surprising way if she eventually rumbles the affair. she said \\"It's either going to be the usual Chas thing or we'll go against the grain and do something not necessarily expected, but who knows, we've got a long time to run it yet.\\" Departure In April 2011, it was announced that Shaw was to leave Emmerdale. Of her departure, Shaw said \\"Playing Eve has been a wonderful experience for me. I have had the opportunity to work with some incredibly talented people and to learn from them. After much soul-searching we decided that as a family we wanted to be based in one place at this point in our lives. My family must come first and I have therefore decided to leave the show in the summer.\\" Storylines=2001‚Äì2006 Eve is the daughter of Peter Birch (Philip Bird).

Riders are seated on a modified motion simulator base that is mounted on a wheeled chassis. As the vehicle travels through the attraction, the motion base simulates movement, such as driving over rough terrain or leaning through a turn, that makes the ride experience appear more realistic. Design history Disney filed for patent on the Enhanced Motion Vehicle ride system on November 16, 1995. This ride system was developed for the Indiana Jones Adventure. Four such systems were built (in chronological order): * Development prototype/test track, built inside a Burbank warehouse, near Walt Disney Imagineering (now dismantled). * Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Forbidden Eye at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. * Dinosaur, a bolt-for-bolt identical ride system which opened as CTX: Countdown to Extinction, located at Disney's Animal Kingdom in Orlando, Florida. * Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Crystal Skull at Tokyo DisneySea. The Enhanced Motion Vehicles (EMV) are intended to appear as a battered military troop transport or \\"Time Rover\\". EMVs are driven less than by air filled tractor trailer tires atop the surface of a slotted roadbed. Beneath the slot, a tubular guiderail guides the front wheelset and is responsible for supplying power to the vehicle, which is 480 volts in three phase, with a capacity of 200 Amps. The power is divided among the communications, control, safety, audio systems and the two motion systems - propulsion and hydraulics. Each transport can accommodate twelve guests with three rows of seats, four across, with the front left seat behind non- operational steering wheel. In addition to the three bus bars for power, there are three additional bus bars, one for a \\"GO\\" signal, one for a \\"NOGO\\" signal, and one for ground. Each EMV is a motion simulator, or technically a 'full- motion chassis' because it is not under the control of the occupants, and it travels through a show building instead of enclosing occupants in a moving theater room, as in the case of Star Tours. The EMV motion base is attached by three hydraulic actuators to the frame of the chassis carrying the bulk of unsprung weight, allowing the low-mass body shell to articulate independently and rapidly with micrometer precision by incorporating a position feedback system. Three actuators are used on the chassis motion platform to position the motion base in six degrees of freedom: three thrust planes (x, y & z) with three rotational axes (pitch, roll, and yaw). A guest's physically intense experience is programmed to achieve the illusion of greater speed and catastrophic mechanical failure using the enhanced-motion vehicle's ability to add several feet of lift then rapidly descend, shudder and tremble, and intensify cornering with counter-bank and twist. A variance on the Japanese version replaces the three hydraulic rams with linear-inductive actuators. The 35 gallons of hydraulic fluid used on the Disneyland version takes two hours to clean off the track when a hose splits. Because of Japan's environmental codes regarding oil spills, the Japanese design team elected to substitute electromagnetic actuators on the ride vehicle. Systems operation=Communications Each car must know where it is in relationship with other cars; it does this by transmitting its position to the control tower and receiving the positions of other cars over a spread spectrum radio to avoid the noise of power pickup wipers arcing along the bus bar. The vehicle also responds to programming selections indicated by a section of track and reports which subprogram it is currently running. Control Feedback provides the position in space the car body occupies and what amount of actuator change needs to be applied to reach the next position and at what rate. Control also triggers various audio, receives location information from communications and adjusts power with Silicon Control Relays and Silicon Control Rectifiers to operate motors and switches, the most important switch being \\"STOP\\". Safety STOP is the most important element of the safety system. There are more ways to stop than to go. Ways to stop are parallel. Ways to go are sequential. The hard reset is the most basic stop; it involves cycling the power off, then on. There are large red mushroom buttons at each loading station and in the tower within easy reach of each operator that will halt all vehicle motion. There are many different kinds of \\"stop\\" functions, some unique to specific ride operation consoles. All ride operation consoles have \\"station stop\\" mushroom buttons. \\"Station stop\\" halts all vehicle motion in the station. Because the two sides of the station (north and south) can be operated independently, station stops located in the loading area cannot stop motion on both sides of the station simultaneously (e.g. a station stop pressed at the south load console will not stop vehicle motion on the north side). Block violations are among several internal automatic stop responses, where two cars are within the same track zone. A seatbelt could come free triggering a stop, or an obstacle sensed on the track such as a purse. Mushroom buttons were fitted to each rear bumper after continued operation. Other logistical controls will also halt motion, such as switching a vehicle in or out of the track loop. In order for vehicles to move throughout the attraction, Ride Access Control (RAC) \\"lockout keys\\" must all be in place, indicating that no personnel occupy the track. Before a vehicle can be dispatched into the attraction, operation personnel verify all seatbelts are locked and loose articles are secured. Operation personnel must check that each safety belt is secure two ways - positive action visual inspection, where the rider pulls at a yellow strap attached to the buckle end, and an automatic LED panel on each side of the vehicle which lights up a grid point when a buckle is locked. Only then are operators allowed to press a green dispatch button located deep within a protective sleeve. Audio systems Sections of track trigger various audio sequences stored onboard 16-gig EEPROM storage, which also stores motion sequence programming. Motion systemsPropulsion= Propulsion is generated through the hydraulic system. Refer to the hydraulic system overview below. =Hydraulics= Every vehicle is equipped with a complete hydraulic system to power its various components. These components include three hydraulic actuators which are connected to the motion base (body) of the vehicle. Specifically, there are 2 actuators towards the front right and front left of the motion base, and 1 actuator in the rear- center of the motion base. These actuators can produce 2 individual degrees of motion; pitch and roll. Of course, a combination of these motions can be used. Two other actuators are utilized to control the steering of the rear-left and rear-right wheels. The front wheels are steered mechanically through the front bogie, but an encoder is used on the front steering system to tell the ride control computer how much to turn the rear wheels to assist the overall steering of the vehicle. Simply put, the rear wheels change their positions based upon the input from the front wheels. One last actuator is used for the rear bogie. This is known as the rear follower lockout actuator. This actuator can run in 2 modes; an extended mode and a retracted mode. Each mode allows the rear offset of the vehicle to be confined within a fixed distance of travel. In the retracted mode, the vehicle can make sharp turns, to the point of the rear wheels actually crossing the track slot (though this does not happen under normal operation). The extended mode does not allow such a large rear offset, and is thus used when the vehicle may have little clearance on the side. If the vehicle attempts to travel outside of the confined distances of travel, the vehicle will initiate an automatic power disconnect, halting vehicle movement immediately. Another component of the hydraulic system is the propulsion motor. The hydraulic propulsion motor is responsible for providing forward movement of the vehicles. The propulsion motor is of the axial piston pump type, and is capable of variable speed. In addition to providing forward power, it is also used as a main braking device for the vehicles. When traveling down a hill, the vehicles will drive the position of the swash plate within the propulsion motor to a negative angle, utilizing the propulsion motor as a pump. This allows the vehicle to convert its kinetic energy into hydraulic pressure, which is stored in its high pressure accumulators. The majority of deceleration breaking within the attraction uses this method of slowing the vehicle down. The hydraulic system also comprises a hydraulic pump, which is driven by a 50-horsepower, 480 volt, 3-phase electric motor. The electric motor is constantly running, and is cooled by a large fan. The pump, however, is only engaged when hydraulic pressure needs to be generated. For instance, when a vehicle is stopped and the motion base is not moving, the pump will only engage one or two times per minute. However, when the vehicle is traveling through the attraction, the pump is engaged for the majority of the time. Lastly, the hydraulic system uses a combination of 3 accumulators to store its hydraulic pressure. Two of these accumulators are high pressure accumulators, which store hydraulic fluid at 3,000 PSI. The accumulators use an inert gas to provide the pressure necessary. The low pressure accumulator stores the fluid at a much lower pressure, typically around 100 PSI. Other various components are utilized in the hydraulic system, such as anti- cavitation valves and filters. In addition, there is a large hydraulic tank to store additional hydraulic fluid. =Linear motors= Due to strict laws governing oil spills in Japan, EMVs in Japan use electric linear actuators, rather than hydraulic rams, to accomplish motion. Similar ride systems Four other similar EMV ride systems were also built for Disney theme park attractions. * Rocket Rods, on the former PeopleMover track of Tomorrowland, Disneyland, Anaheim, California. (now dismantled) * Test Track, in Epcot, Walt Disney World, Orlando, Florida. * Radiator Springs Racers, in Disney California Adventure, Anaheim, California. Both introduced additional elements to the outdoor portion of the tubular guideway - exposure to weather. * Journey to the Center of the Earth at Tokyo DisneySea. The technical improvements and fewer degrees of freedom in these systems distinguish them from being in the same class of EMV.

Description and history Windham Village is a dispersed rural settlement, extending along Windham Hill Road between Harrington Road and Stone Bridge Road. The focal point of the village is the Congregational Church, located at the junction with Harrington Road, which was built in 1802 and given Greek Revival styling in 1825. There are twelve other primary buildings, of which ten are historically significant, in an area of about . All of these are residences, typically 1-1/2 or 2-1/2 stories in height, with wood frame construction and either vernacular Greek or Gothic Revival style. Most were built before 1858‚Äîthere are only a few 20th century houses in the area, and they are sympathetic in style and scale to the older buildings. The town of Windham was chartered in the early 1770s, but settlement of this, its central village, did not begin until the 1780s. The village is unusual in the state as a well- preserved and still-occupied high hill villages, many of which were abandoned in the 19th century and early 20th centuries. At the middle of the 19th century, when the town population was at its peak, the village included a small commercial complex, which declined and collapsed in the 1940s, its building materials eventually salvaged by area residents.

History The office, more fully known as the domestikos tƒìs basilikƒìs trapezƒìs (, \\"Domestic of the imperial table\\"), epi tƒìs basilikƒìs trapezƒìs () or epi tƒìs trapezƒìs tou despotou (, \\"in charge of the lord's table\\"), is first mentioned as extant in the mid-7th century, but the source, a hagiography of Maximus the Confessor, is of much later date. It is, however, amply attested in seals from the 8th century on, often holding the offices of koubikoularios or parakoim≈çmenos as well... The epi tƒìs trapezƒìs was responsible for introducing guests to the imperial banquets, waiting to the Byzantine emperor along with the pinkernƒìs, and carrying dishes from the imperial table to the guests. Historical sources, however, show that some holders of the post were entrusted with leading troops or various other special assignments. Like many palace posts involving close access to the Byzantine emperor, it was restricted to eunuchs. There was also the epi tƒìs trapezƒìs tƒìs Augoustƒìs (, \\"in charge of the table of the Augusta\\"), who filled the same duties for the Byzantine empress, and in addition supervised her private barques.. The epi tƒìs trapezƒìs was assisted by a staff, the so-called hypourgia (), headed by the domestikos tƒìs hypourgias () and including also secretaries styled notarios tƒìs hypourgias (). The German scholar Werner Seibt proposed that the epi tƒìs trapezƒìs absorbed the main functions of the kastrƒìsios, an earlier official with an apparently similar role.. Another official with similar duties, the kƒìnarios, is attested only a couple of times during the first decades of the 9th century. Seibt considers him either a subaltern official to the epi tƒìs trapezƒìs or an intermediate stage between the kastrƒìsios and the final absorption of his duties into the epi tƒìs trapezƒìs.. From the 13th century on, the epi tƒìs trapezƒìs and the variant domestikos tƒìs trapezƒìs became purely honorary court titles, bereft of any specific duties. In this vein, Nikephoros Gregoras reports that this dignity was allegedly conferred and made hereditary to the princes of Russia from the time of Emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306‚Äì337) on.

The K1 was a conventionally-braced high-wing monoplane, powered by a single nose-mounted licence-built Bristol Jupiter VI radial engine, and had a conventional landing gear with a tailskid. The square-section fuselage had an enclosed cockpit for two with a cabin behind for freight or eight passengers. Test flights showed that performance was poor and the aircraft was redesigned. Do K2 The Do K2 flew in December 1929 with similar wings and fuselage but had a changed landing gear and four Gnome-Rhone Titan radial engines. The four engines were strut mounted on each side of the fuselage in tandem pairs, one in tractor configuration and the other as a pusher. Although the aircraft had an increase in available power, the performance was little improved on the K1.  Do K3  The K3 was a complete rethink of the design. The braced wing was replaced with a cantilever wing of larger span. The fuselage was changed to oval and stretched for two extra passengers and the tailskid was replaced with a tailwheel and the main units were enclosed in fairings. The four engines were in the same tandem arrangement as the K2, but located lower on the fuselage and changed to Walter Castor radial engines.

Fascination is a 1922 American silent drama film directed by Robert Z. Leonard and starring his then wife Mae Murray. The film is based on an original story by Edmund Goulding who was soon to be a prolific film director. The story capitalizes on Murray's continuing forays into outlandish costume dramas. It is not known whether the film currently survives, suggesting that it is a lost film. Plot As described in a film magazine, Dolores de Lisa (Murray), born of a Spanish father and American mother, combines the warm blood of the South with Yankee pep. To hold her in restraint, her aunt Marquesa (Fitzroy) takes her to Madrid. Dolores slips away from home on Easter day when the streets are filled with crowds going to the bullfight where, after obtaining a wig and costume, she occupies a box. She becomes fascinated with the toreador Carrita (Frazer), and the Count de Morera (Foote) offers to introduce her if she will agree to attend his ball. At the ball Dolores dances for the guests, and then joins a party at a cabaret where she meets the great Carrita. Her family meanwhile is searching the city for her, her father Eduardo de Lisa (Lane), her brother Carlos (Hale), and her sweetheart Ralph Kellogg (Coleman), having just arrived from the United States. Her father enters the cabaret and Parola (Ware), a faded cabaret singer, recognizes him and invites him to her room. Dolores follows them and hears Parola accuse Carlos of being the father of her son. As Carlos turns and starts down the stairs, Parola attempts to kill him with a heavy lamp but Dolores grabs it. Parola then turns on the daughter, but she is saved by the toreador. Parola tells Carrita that Carlos is his father and urges him to avenge her. Carrita leaves and before he can carry out his purpose, Parola admits that she lied and was only attempting to blackmail Carlos, which saves him from death at the hands of the toreador. Dolores arrives home bedraggled and completely cured of her desire for excitement, bullfights, and underworld cabarets. She happily sinks into her American sweetheart's arms.

It is one of the oldest Chinatowns in the United States. Geography There is conflicting information about the boundaries that make up Chinatown. One source identifies the natural boundary to the west as Honolulu Harbor, and to the north, Nuuanu stream. Beretania Street is usually considered the eastern boundary, and the southern boundary is Nuuanu Avenue, although the Chinatown Special District is considered to extend approximately a block and a half south of Nuuanu along Merchant Street. In total, the land area is . A few blocks to the east is the Hawaii Capital Historic District, and adjacent to the south is the Merchant Street Historic District. Alternatively, the Hawaiian language newspaper Nupepa Kuokoa described Taona Pake (Chinatown) in 1900 as \\"that whole area from West side of Kukui Street until the river mouth called Makaaho, then travel straight until reaching Hotel street; and travel on [Hotel] this street on the West side until reaching Konia Street, and travel until you reach King St. Locations Since 2002, there are two small paifang on the sidewalks flanking North King Street, just north of where King crosses Nuuanu Stream, and just south of where Hotel splits from King. There is also a small brick entrance arch to Maunakea Marketplace off Maunakea Street, decorated with an awning featuring a green-tile roof. Two guardian lions mark the southern entrance to Chinatown on Hotel, between Bethel and Nuuanu near the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Park (formerly Chinatown Gateway Park); they were gifted to Honolulu by a sister city, Kaohsiung, in 1989. Dr. Sun was born in another of Honolulu's sister cities, Zhongshan. The Wo Fat Restaurant was Honolulu's oldest. The business first opened in 1882, but the building was destroyed in the 1886 fire. A new building was built at 115 North Hotel Street () after the 1900 fire, and the current three-story building at the same location opened in 1938, designed by Y.T. Char. The Wo Fat Restaurant closed in 2005, and the building housed a nightclub in the early 2000s. In 1904 the Oahu Market was opened by Tuck Young at the corner of King and Kekaulike streets, coordinates . The simply designed functional construction, consisting of a large, open- air, covered space divided into stalls, remains in use today for selling fresh fish and produce. History The area was probably used by fishermen in ancient Hawaii but little evidence of this remains. Kealiimaikai, the brother of Kamehameha I lived in the area at the end of the 18th century. One of the first early settlers from outside was Isaac Davis, who lived there until 1810. Spaniard Don Francisco de Paula Mar√≠n lived in the southern end of the area in the early 19th century, and planted a vineyard in the northern end, for which Vineyard Boulevard is named. During the 19th century laborers were imported from China to work on sugar plantations in Hawaii. Many became merchants after their contracts expired and moved to this area. The ethnic makeup has always been diverse, peaking at about 56% Chinese people in the 1900 census, and then declining. Honolulu is traditionally known in Chinese as Ê™ÄÈ¶ôÂ±± (T√°nxiƒÅngshƒÅn), meaning Sandalwood Mountain. Two major fires destroyed many buildings in 1886 and 1900. The 1886 fire started at 4 p.m. on April 18; according to contemporary news reports, the Chinese fire company was blamed for being unable to halt the progress and the fire consumed , destroying almost all of Chinatown, save two or three buildings. 8,000 residents were displaced. Sailors and marines from were credited with keeping the fire contained to Chinatown by blowing up buildings. The 1900 fire started during the destruction of a building infected with bubonic plague; the plague was confirmed in Honolulu on December 12, 1899. Schools were closed and 7000 residents of the area were put under quarantine. After 13 people died, the Board of Health ordered structures suspected of being infected to be burned. Residents were evacuated, and a few buildings were successfully destroyed while the Honolulu Fire Department stood by. However, on January 20, 1900 the fire went out of control after winds shifted, and destroyed most of the neighborhood instead. The neighborhood was rebuilt and many of the current buildings date from 1901. Very few are over four stories tall.  Bubonic Plague (1899-1900)  King Kamehameha III created the Board of Health on December 13, 1850. This became the first Board of Health in the United States. It was established to supervise the public health of the people of Hawaii, and to protect them against epidemic diseases. The Board of Health, which at that time was under the control of three physicians, Nathaniel B. Emerson, Francis R. Day and Clifford B. Wood, played an integral role during the bubonic plague outbreak that started in 1899. The situation had become so dire in Honolulu that Emerson, Day and Wood were afforded absolute dictatorial authority over Hawaii. This was the result of an agreement between the President of the Provisional Hawaiian Government, Mr. Sanford Ballard Dole, and the Attorney General, Mr. Henry E. Cooper, who concurred that nothing should impede the battle of the \\"dread disease.\\" Cooper also served as the President of the Board of Health. According to the Annual Reports published by the Hawaii State Department of Health, the first case of the bubonic plague was Yon Chong, a 22-year-old Chinese man who worked as a bookkeeper in Chinatown. Chong fell sick on December 9, 1899, and formed buboes, leading his attending physician to suspect the plague. A jointly-conducted diagnostic exam was performed by other doctors, who confirmed the suspicion. Their diagnosis was reported to Board President Cooper on December 11, 1899. Yon Chong died the following day, and Cooper made an announcement to the public about this first bubonic plague death. After the public announcement, Cooper ordered an immediate military quarantine of the Chinatown area. In hopes of containing the plague in Honolulu, the Board of Health also closed Honolulu Harbor to both incoming and outgoing vessels. According to the official Board of Health records, only three human cases of the plague were recorded during the quarantine. On December 19, 1899, the quarantine of Chinatown and Honolulu Harbor was lifted. However, only five days after the quarantine was lifted, nine more cases were reported by the Board of Health. Of those 12 reported cases, 11 would die. The epidemic continued until March 31, 1900. By the end, a total of 71 cases and 61 fatalities were reported by Board of Health.  Yersinia pestis in Hawaii  Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes bubonic plague, is transmitted by the oriental rat flea and has been historically propagated along various trade routes to the west from China. Although the original introduction of the oriental rat flea to Hawaii is unknown, one historical incident may mark this important event. In 1899, the Nippon Maru anchored in Honolulu Harbor enroute to San Francisco, and reported the death of a Chinese passenger. After inspection, the ship had been confined to Quarantine Island, better known today as Sand Island. After a week-long stay there, the ship had been cleared to travel on to San Francisco. According to one record, due diligence was executed on the part of the Board of Health with respect to the passengers and goods, though little attention was paid to the chance of rats escaping and going ashore. This is because it was not yet widely known that the rodents were the carriers of the flea vector that transmits Yersinia pestis. Great Honolulu Chinatown Fire of 1900 The bubonic plague was introduced into Honolulu on October 20, 1899 by an offloaded shipment of rice from the America Maru, which had also been carrying rats. At that time, Chinese immigration to Hawaii had resulted in crowded residences in Chinatown with poor living conditions and sewage disposal. Plague infected 11 people. The Board of Health responded by incinerating garbage, renovating the sewer system, putting Chinatown under quarantine, and most of all burning affected buildings. Forty- one fires were set in total, and on January 20, 1900 winds picked up one fire and spread it to other buildings. The fire burned out of control for seventeen days and scorched of Honolulu. There were another 31 controlled burns after the incident. The 7,000 residents rendered homeless were housed in detention camps to maintain the quarantine until April 30. White residents who had gathered to watch the fire also helped escort the victims to refugee camps, using baseball bats and pick handles to ensure compliance. A total of 40 people died of the plague. Rebuilding and preservation Critics accused the government of sinophobia. An exodus occurred. While the former residents rebuilt Chinatown, many moved to the suburbs, hoping not to relive a similar incident. The post-fire architecture used masonry rather than wood, since stone and brick buildings were fire resistant. Many of the people who filed damage claims were represented by lawyer Paul Neumann, but he died before the cases went to court. After World War II the area fell into disrepair and became a red-light district. During the administrations of mayors Frank Fasi and Jeremy Harris the area was targeted for revitalization. Restrictions on lighting and signs were relaxed to promote nightlife. Special zoning rules were adopted for the area. The Hawaii National Bank was founded in the district in 1960, and has its headquarters there. About of the district was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Oahu on January 17, 1973 as site 73000658. On the eastern edge of the district, the Hawaii Theatre was restored and re-opened in 1996. The area around the theatre is called the Arts District. In 2005 a small park near the theatre at the corner of Hotel and Bethel streets was opened and named Chinatown Gateway Park. In November 2007 the park was renamed to honor Sun Yat-Sen, who came to Chinatown in 1879; he was educated and planned the Chinese Revolution of 1911 during his Hawaiian stay. Honolulu Chinatown was included in the Preserve America program. Government and infrastructure In Honolulu's Chinatown, street signs are different from usual signs; they are red-framed and written in English and Chinese. The Chinatown-Downtown Honolulu Neighborhood Board is an elected nine-member volunteer organization dedicated to improving the governance of this specially designated region. It is a part of the City and County of Honolulu Neighborhood Commission Office. Currently, the Board is chaired by Kevin McDonald and meets on the first Thursday of each month at 6 p.m. at the Aloha Tower, Multipurpose room #2. The downtown police substation of the Honolulu Police Department is located in Chinatown. Officials broke ground for the substation on Friday September 18, 1998. Mayor Jeremy Harris said that he wanted a police station built at that location because the presence of a police station would deter crime. Honolulu Rail Transit is anticipated to extend service to Chinatown by 2025; the future Chinatown station will be built in the median of Nimitz Highway between River and Kekaulike.

He is one of the pioneers of using large-scale computing to investigate the formation of large-scale structure in a Universe dominated by dark matter. He later turned his attention to an area he calls ‚Äúastrobiophysics‚Äù, examining a variety of ways that external events in our galaxy may have influenced the course of life on Earth, including analysis of gamma-ray burst events.  Life  Born in Moundsville, West Virginia, his early scientific interest was in physical chemistry, but later changed to study physics at Bethany College in West Virginia. He became active in the antiwar and educational movements of the 60‚Äôs, and was drawn into the Unitarian ministry. He attended Starr King School for the Ministry in Berkeley, California and was minister in Tampa, Florida for 7 years. During this time he continued his interest in physics. In 1977 he entered the physics program at the University of Texas at Austin where he met and quickly decided to work with noted cosmologist Dennis W. Sciama. He was among one of three groups who had initiated the numerical simulation of the formation of structure in a Universe dominated by dark matter. He received his Ph.D. in 1981, and followed with postdoctoral work with Arthur M. Wolfe at Pittsburgh, with the group of Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich in Moscow, and as Enrico Fermi Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Chicago. In 1986 he joined the faculty of the University of Kansas, where he has been ever since. In 1998-2001, he was active in the ‚Äúcontroversy‚Äù surrounding evolution in the public school curriculum in Kansas. In 2002, he received the Joseph Burton Forum Award for his central role in organizing public support for the return of modern evolutionary biology to the Kansas public school curriculum He is married to Gillian, and has two sons, Christopher and Jesse.  Research  His work in dark matter focused on the formation of what has come to be called the ‚Äúcosmic web‚Äù from Zeldovich pancakes. In 1983, before the existence of such structure was generally accepted, he and collaborators predicted its existence in a Universe dominated by cold dark matter. Later in the 80‚Äôs, he worked with J. Richard Gott on the topology of large-scale structure, then with Sergei Shandarin on the merging of hierarchical clustering models with the Zel‚Äôdovich pancake picture as a description of large-scale structure. Beginning in 2003, he made an abrupt transition into a new area which began by examining the effects the radiation from a gamma-ray burst would have upon the Earth, and attempting to draw a connection with past mass extinction events. This has branched out into examination of comet impacts, solar flares, and other phenomenae. He showed that a 63 million-year oscillation in fossil biodiversity cuts across a variety of data sets and has found clues to its cause, which, however, is still an unsolved problem. Melott is a member of the Paleontological Society. He was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society ‚ÄúFor groundbreaking studies of the origin and evolution of cosmic structure‚Äù in 1996, and received its Joseph Burton Forum award for his educational work in 2003.

Composed during a sojourn in the mountains of Lebanon, it is considered to be the first novel by an Arab-American writer in English. His contemporary, Khalil Gibran, illustrated the work, and the story is often seen as an influence on Gibran's own well-known book The Prophet.Ameen Albert Rihani, \\"The Book of Khalid and The Prophet. Similar Universal Concerns with Different Perspectives\\", Presented at \\"The Gibran International Conference\\", University of Maryland, December 9‚Äì12. Background In his twenties around the turn of the century, Rihani was actively involved in the cultural scene of New York City, and he helped establish some of the earliest Arab-American literary societies. He published a collection of select quatrains of the poet Abul-'Ala into English in 1903 and wrote various essays and poetry in Arabic. In 1905, however, he returned to Lebanon and lived for a number of years in \\"mountain solitude.Ameen Rihani Organization Biography, accessed April 8, 2010, http://www.ameenrihani.org/index.php?page=biography\\" Yet he was not completely isolated and during this stay he lectured at local universities and released a number of essays, plays, and poems in Arabic. In 1910, he published Ar- Rihaniyat, a collection of essays that was positively received in the region and gave Rihani a strong reputation as a leading Arab intellectual. During this period, he also worked on The Book of Khalid, which, according to its final page, was finished at his home in Freike on January 12, 1910. The caption reads: IN . FREIKE . WHICH . IS . IN . MOUNT . LEBANON SYRIA . ON . THE . TWELFTH . DAY . OF JANUARY . 1910 . ANNO . CHRISTI . AND . THE FIRST . DAY . OF . MUHARRAM . 1328 . HEGIRAH THIS . BOOK . OF . KHALID . WAS . FINISHED In 1911, Rihani returned to New York and sent the manuscript to publishers. When Dodd Mead and Co. received the text, it reportedly consumed their offices more than another other manuscript received at the time. In an era when the increasingly diverse nature of immigration to the United States was a popular topic, the book was marketed as an evaluation of U.S. institutions by an immigrant that would appeal to \\"clever readers.\\"The Atlantic Monthly Advertiser, vol. 18, December 1911, p. 18, retrieved via on April 8, 2010. Although the novel was not an extraordinary success in terms of sales, it received highly affirming reviews in journals like The Bookman and The Papyrus. Structure and style Stamp Illustration for the Novel by Khalil Gibran The novel is presented as a \\"found manuscript,\\" a mechanism that recurs in other Arab-American fictional works.Stan Shabaz, \\"Sinan Antoon,\\" Zinda Magazine, February 4, 2008, retrieved April 8, 2010 from http://www.zindamagazine.com/html/archives/2008/02.04.08/index_mon.php The narrator pieces the history together from an Arabic manuscript found in the Khedivial Library of Cairo and from interviews and the texts of other figures involved. The novel is divided into three books, dedicated in order \\"to Man,\\" \\"to Nature,\\" and \\"to God.\\" Each section begins with an illustration by Gibran and a philosophical statement attributed to the protagonist Khalid. The narrator speaks directly to \\"the Reader,\\" elaborating the story's progression from the different sources available to him. The novel is highly descriptive and poetical in style, and the central characters are thoroughly developed. Rihani deploys numerous italicized Arabic words, and the work has been perceived as linking Western and Eastern literary forms. There are constant references to Western and Middle Eastern philosophers, writers, and intellectuals. Poetry, often attributed to the characters, is interspersed throughout the novel. There is also a wry and satirical humor deployed throughout the work, and Rihani's personal perspective on the merits of the protagonist's expressions can be difficult to ascertain at times. Plot The novel, which is intensely autobiographical as Rihani himself immigrated as a child, tells the story of two boys, named Khalid and Shakib, from Baalbek in Lebanon (at the time, the Syrian province of the Ottoman Empire) who migrate together to the United States, coming by ship through Ellis Island and enduring the classic \\"Via Dolorosa\\" of an immigrant. They move into a wet cellar in the Little Syria community of Lower Manhattan near Battery Park and begin to peddle counterfeit Holy Land trinkets and religious items throughout the city, a typical Arab endeavor in America. While Shakib, although himself a poet, is focused and accumulates savings through peddling, Khalid becomes distracted and turns away from commercial activity toward frantically consuming Western literature and participating in the New York City intellectual and bohemian scene. At one point, he burns his peddling box, decrying the dishonesty of their sales. After exhaustion from reckless \\"bohemian\\" pursuits, Khalid shifts towards party politics when he is offered the position of a functionary and ward for the Arab community in the machine politics of the city. However, Khalid insists on moral purity in his political work, causing conflict with his \\"Boss.\\" As a result, he is jailed for a brief time of ten days (Shakib helps secure his release) under the charge of misapplying public funds. The two decide to return to Lebanon before long, and Khalid then shifts back to intense peddling for a time, paying off his accumulated debts and earning funds for return passage. Describing the result of their return, Christoph Schumann has stated that \\"the subsequent course of events mirrors the progress of his American experience: spiritual retreat, political activism, and persecution.\\"Schumann, Christoph. 2008. Liberal thought in the Eastern Mediterranean: late 19th century until the 1960s. Leiden: Brill, p. 246 Khalid soon engages in a series of actions that anger Maronite clerics in his home city. He refuses to attend church services and spreads pamphlets and ideas seen as heretical. Moreover, he presses his wish to marry Najma, a young cousin, but Church leaders refuse to grant consent. As result of the growing conflict, Khalid is excommunicated. After burning the official excommunication order in the town square of Baalbek, he sets off a battle of opposing sides and is sent by Ottoman troops to a prison in Damascus. Meanwhile, Najma is forced by her father to marry an Ottoman official. After Khalid's release, Khalid moves to the mountain forests and starts to live as a hermit. During this period of exile, he contemplates nature and integrates lessons learned in America with his views on the cultural and political dilemmas of the Arab world. He evolves into a self- identified \\"voice\\" for the Arabs, and chooses to return to spread his views on liberation from the Ottoman empire and on the importance of religious unity and scientific progress. Khalid travels to different cities engaging in political and spiritual speech, periodically writing letters to Shakib. During his travels, Khalid meets an American Bah√° º√≠ woman named Mrs. Gotfry with whom he discursively engages on questions of love and religion. He travels to Damascus where he speaks in the Great Mosque about his views of the West and of religious tradition, producing a riot and prompting the Ottoman authorities to pursue his arrest. He flees with Mrs. Gotfry to Baalbek, where he meets Shakib and learns that Najma, along with her young son, is abandoned and now ill. All of them (Khalid, Mrs. Gotfry, Najma, her son, and Shakib) flee together into the Egyptian desert to escape the Ottoman authorities. After an idyllic period in the desert of several months, Mrs. Gotfry and Shakib leave. Najma's son, Najid, dies suddenly of an unexpected illness, and Najma relapses and follows him in death in her grief. Khalid disappears and does not contact Shakib; his whereabouts are unknown. Major theme The central theme of the novel is the attempt to reconcile the culture and values of \\"the West\\" and \\"the East,\\" a universal concern in Rihani's work, and, indeed, entire approach to life. Khalid ruminates constantly on the merits and future destiny of America, which he connects to the Arab world in their own struggles with the Ottoman empire and with religious intolerance and conflict. Like Rihani himself, who synthesized two distinct cultures perhaps more than almost any other writer of the time, Khalid, having experienced America (and considered its strength and weaknesses) during his stay of several years, returns and develops a philosophy that engages the Arab public directly. He is continually frustrated with America's materialism and inconsistent pursuit of its stated ideals, but he still believes that America represents a powerful force in the world's future evolution and that the Arab world can learn from its political ideals, relative respect for religion, and embrace of science and progress. Although these expressions result in his own persecution, he emerges as a modern prophet with a combined political, cultural, and spiritual message. Reputation 2011 was the centennial anniversary of the novel's publication, which has been seen as significant given the attributed merit of the work and its notability as the first Arab-American novel. As a result, there was an attempt to publicize and promote the work, which many believed to have been understudied, especially in comparison with the extraordinary popular The Prophet. A commemorative book, 100 Years of Selected Writings on Ameen Rihani's The Book of Khalid, edited and introduced by Paul Jahshan, was published by Platform International in 2011. Commemorative events took place at the Library of Congress, the New York Public Library, and Graduate Center, CUNY. In 2009, the Arab Radio and Television Network's television show \\"What's Happening?\\" (moderated by Will Youmans and other hosts) had a segment on the novel with Todd Fine, a Harvard graduate who has digitized the work and entered it into Project Gutenberg. With a follow-up effort called \\"Project Khaled\\", he made plans to create a new educational edition of the novel and promote the 2011 anniversary.Middle Eastern Student Faculty/Student Update (Syracuse University), vol. 3, no. 2, Winter 2009, p. 6, . In March of 2012 Melville House Publishing issued an edition of The Book of Khalid which includes Kahlil Gibran's illustrations and an essay by Todd Fine. The book also includes a HybridBook component, linking to free download of ten essays written by Ameen Rihani. Among the ten essays is \\"From Concord to Syria\\" which addresses themes similar to the ones in The Book of Khalid. In 2016, Syracuse University Press published a critical edition of the novel edited by Todd Fine, which includes a glossary. Contributors include Geoffrey Nash, Christoph Schumann, Layla Al Maleh, Wa√Øl S. Hassan, Youssef Choueiri, Nathan C. Funk, Hani Bawardi, and Ameen Albert Rihani.

Mineral collecting is the hobby of systematically collecting, identifying and displaying mineral specimens. Mineral collecting can also be a part of the profession of mineralogy and allied geologic specialties. Individual collectors often specialize, for example collecting examples of the various colors and forms taken by the mineral calcite, calcite from widely scattered locations in a region or the world, or minerals found in pegmatites. History Generally considered the \\"father of mineralogy\\", Georgius Agricola (1494‚Äì1555) was also an avid mineral collector. He wrote several books, including two of enduring significance: De Re Metallica, an early treatise on mining, and De Natura Fossilium, the first (1546) modern textbook of mineralogy. Another famous 16th century mineral collector was Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II (1552‚Äì1612). He built a large mineral collection while employing Anselmus de Boodt (ca. 1550‚Äì1634), his court physician and another avid mineral collector, to expand and tend his collections. After Rudolf's death his collection was dispersed. Motivations Mineral collectors find a variety of reasons to collect minerals. Many minerals are strikingly beautiful and collected for their aesthetic value. Others collect to learn more about mineralogy, the local mining industry and/or local geology. Some simply enjoy exploring the outdoors and socializing and trading with other mineral collectors. Serious collectors will go so far as traveling great distances to find the right specimen.

The weapon never proceeded beyond prototype stages. Design The Interdynamics MKR was originally designed using a 4.5√ó26mm MKR round using solid brass bullets. Its purpose was to provide a flat ballistic trajectory along with armor-piercing capabilities with low recoil for the user to handle, even when fired fully automatically. An additional part of the concept was for it to use a low cost ammunition type. The 4.5√ó26mm MKR round was claimed to be ballistically as effective at 300 meters as the 5.56√ó45mm NATO round. Another interesting feature about the weapon is that it was bullpup in design, which means that the magazine is located behind the trigger, and also utilized the blowback system of operation. The bullpup design was a significant tactical advantage because it increased the firearm's compactness and allowed for a smaller, lighter and more efficient firearm.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The congregation is associated with the Presbyterian Church (USA). History=Development When the city of Davenport was formed in 1836 there were between 10-12 people who were Presbyterian. In the first couple of years they worshiped with other Protestant congregations. In April 1838 they formed their own congregation. They gathered in a small building owned by T.S. Hoge on Ripley Street between Front (present-day River Drive) and Second Streets. They managed the best they could with supply ministers who visited from time to time. The group was organized into a church on May 5, 1839, in a small frame school house on the corner of Fourth and Harrison Streets. The clergy in attendance at the service that day included Rev. Ithamar Pillsbury of Macomb, Illinois, Rev. M. Hummer of Stephenson (present-day Rock Island, Illinois) and the Rev. Enoch Mead of Rockingham, Iowa, which is now the southwest section of Davenport. They were also the supply clergy who visited the congregation occasionally. In 1842 J.M.D. Burrows and T.S. Hoge were chosen and ordained elders of the church. Rev. Samuel Cleland had charge of the Davenport and Stephenson congregations for four years starting in 1843. At this time they built their first church in Davenport even though the congregation was still very small. In 1846 the congregation only numbered 17. From 1847 to 1849 the congregation was irregularly served by a pastor. Stability for the congregation came in November 1849 when the Rev. J.D. Mason became the pastor. At this time the church consisted of about 30 members. By 1857 the congregation had grown to 200. The congregation built another church building in 1853 on Third Street between Harrison and Main Streets. In 1864 they sold that property and purchased the former St. Luke's Episcopal Church on Brady Street. This building served the congregation for over thirty years when the decision was made to build a new church closer to the center of the parish. The ground was broken for the new church at the corner of Kirkwood Boulevard and Iowa Street on March 18, 1898. The church's cornerstone was laid the same year on July 20, and the new church was dedicated on December 17, 1899. The old church became the Academy of Sciences, a forerunner of the Putnam Museum Present Church The new church was designed by the Galesburg, Illinois architectural firm of Gottschalk & Beadle. They were the same firm that designed an almost identical Central Congregational Church in Galesburg. The building is constructed of Marquette brownstone and it has a magnesian stain. The architectural style is Romanesque with a tower in the Richardsonian style. There are carved oak leaves and foliage on the gables in the Renaissance style. The interior is octagonal in shape and the ceiling is marked with a Maltese cross and a Greek cross. The stained glass windows were created by the J&R; Lamb Studios of New York City. The congregation continued to grow and by 1935 it numbered 1,300 people and was one of the largest congregations in the city. Pipe organ The Casavant Fr√®res Lt√©e (1999, Op. 3455A) pipe organ is located in the front of the sanctuary with some pipes exposed. It features a traditional style console with a roll top. The organ is located in the center in a fixed position. It is equipped with four manuals, five divisions, 61 ranks, the manual compass is 61 notes, and the pedal compass is 32 notes. It has electric key action and electric stop action. The drawknobs are in vertical rows on angled jambs. There are balanced swell shoes/pedals in standard AGO placement.

Other Presbyterian congregations Other congregations sprang up in the city including First Associate Reformed Presbyterian in 1856. The congregation changed its name to United Presbyterian four years later, to McClellan Heights in 1907, and finally St. Andrew's in 1960. The congregation disbanded in 2008. Newcomb was organized by the YMCA in 1869 in the northwest part of the city. It became a mission of First Presbyterian between 1883 and 1916. Renwick Chapel was established in 1876. It had a succession of names including College Avenue Presbyterian, Second Presbyterian, and Mt. Ida Presbyterian. It no longer exists. West Park Presbyterian was founded in the mid-20th century on the west side of the city around the same time that Ridgeview Park Presbyterian was established in northwest Davenport. They merged in 2008 and formed New Hope.

He studied at the University of Padua and the University of Bologna. The earliest works by him date from the early 15th century. He took the doctorate in arts at Padua on 15 May 1409, and received a physician's license on 15 April 1411. In 1412 he stayed in Montagnana, where he wrote a number of treatises. From c. 1420/22 to 1428, the year of his death, Prosdocimus taught a wide variety of subjects at Padua. His was interested in, among other things, arithmetic, music, astronomy, and astrology; this range of interests, however, was common for a Paduan doctor of his day. He wrote the last significant treatise on the art of musical notation as practiced by the Italians. He was held in high regard long after his death: some of the non-musical treatises were reprinted in the 16th century, and Luca Pacioli ranked him alongside Euclid and Boethius.

An associate of the Canadian Music Centre and a member of the Canadian League of Composers, he was best known for his compositions of electronic music, although he produced several non-electronic works. His compositions have been performed throughout North America and Europe. His work Curtain Raiser was commissioned for the opening of the National Arts Centre in 1969. An honorary member of the Canadian Electroacoustic Community, he invented a number of electronic music apparatuses, including the Serial Sound Structure Generator. As a writer he contributed articles to numerous music journals, magazines, and other publications. History Born in London, Ontario, Ciamaga studied at the University of Western Ontario from 1951 to 1954 while simultaneously receiving private instruction from Gordon Delamont. He entered the music program at the University of Toronto where he studied music composition with John Weinzweig and John Beckwith from 1954‚Äì1956. He then pursued graduate studies in musicology and composition at Brandeis University where he earned an MFA in 1958. His teachers at Brandeis included Arthur Berger, Harold Shapero, and Irving Fine. He remained in Waltham, Massachusetts through 1963 where he organized his own electronic music studio. In 1963 Ciamaga was appointed to the music faculty at the University of Toronto. Two years later he was appointed the director of the school's electronic music studio after the death of its first head Myron Schaeffer. In 1968 he became the chairman of the school's theory and composition department. In 1970 he took a year sabbatical to work in several electronic music studios in Europe. In 1977 he assumed the post of dean of the UT's Faculty of Music, a position he held through 1984. He served as acting president of The Royal Conservatory of Music in 1983‚Äì1984. Among his notable pupils are composers Bruce Pennycook, Lesley Barber, John Fodi, Larry Lake, Wende Bartley, John Mills-Cockell and John Rimmer.

History The company was founded in 1993 by Ted Tanouye. Ted tanouye went to USC and graduated with an accounting degree. Theodore Tanouye is the father, and is an aerospace engineer. Ted started out designing, prototyping in his parents garage in Santa Barbara, Ca., and later owned a bike shop named the Bike Beat. At his Bike shop, he sold Mountain Bikes and Mountain Biking gear. Ted Then began to embark on a mountain bike building journey, and began manufacturing frames in his shop. Ted sold his bike shop location, and moved into another location in Anaheim, Ca. Ted still had a small Mountain biking gear shop in the front of the business, while in the back, had a full on manufacturing facility. Ted and CHUMBA first achieved fame with the production of the CHUMBA Zulu, an award-winning downhill bike.http://www.downhillnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=355:chumba- wumba-celebrating-16-years-of-racing&catid;=1:industry-news&Itemid;=27 CHUMBA later went on to produce trail bikes, applying techniques and design philosophies borrowed from Ted's downhill designs, such as \\"slack geometry\\" (the angles between tubes in the frame are slack as opposed to steep), lateral stiffness in the frame, and a fully active suspension. This resulted in the company's first trail bike, the \\"XCL\\", which was praised by Mountain Bike Action saying it \\"could turn circles around any bikes out there\\" with \\"razor- sharp handling\\".

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 5, 2010, and consists of four short dream segments that all take place during Christmas. In the first segment, Bart travels to the North Pole and sets out to get Santa into giving him the dirt bike he has wished for every year. In the second one, set during World War II, Lisa has to cope with the absence of her mother who has been deployed as a soldier overseas. Martha Stewart arrives at the Simpsons' home in the third dream segment, helping Marge save the family's Christmas. Finally, in the last segment the entire family has become puppet characters in a theater show that also stars Katy Perry. Both Stewart and Perry guest starred in the episode as themselves. The segment featuring Perry, with the Simpsons as puppets, was filmed in live- action. It parodies The Muppet Show and Sesame Street‚Äîtwo shows that also feature puppet characters (The Muppets). The segment was inspired by the announcement that in September 2010 Perry would appear as herself on Sesame Street, though this appearance was later cut from that show because of the outfit she was wearing. Since airing, \\"The Fight Before Christmas\\" has received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. It was watched by approximately 9.56 million viewers during its original broadcast. Plot The structure of the episode is similar to the structure of the Treehouse of Horror episodes, only that it is divided in four stories instead of three. Bart's Story Bart stays up late on Christmas Eve to kill Santa Claus for not bringing him a dirt bike three Christmases ago. He eventually falls asleep and dreams that the Polar Express, driven by Otto Mann, lands in front of the house and flies him to the North Pole. Bart meets Santa (Krusty the Clown) only to find out that he has run out of money, since giving out presents in return for cookies every year is not a sustainable business model. Feeling pity, Bart decides that Santa no longer has to give him a dirt bike and leaves with Santa throwing a party in his office after revealing how stupid kids are. Lisa's Story Lisa dreams that it is December 1944 and that Marge is a soldier in World War II. Due to Marge being taken suddenly for overseas deployment while buying a Christmas tree the previous year, Lisa has sworn to never see another Christmas tree until Marge returns home safely. However, during Christmas of 1944, the family gets a telegram saying that Marge is missing in action. After hearing the news, Lisa runs away to the place where she had last seen her mother, the Christmas Tree Farm. The owner of the place says that Marge paid for a tree the previous year but never picked it up. Lisa, believing the tree to be a symbol that Marge is alright, takes it home and decorates it together with Homer and Bart. Marge is then seen assassinating Adolf Hitler with an MP40 in a movie theater in France as he watches a propaganda film. When she walks away from the scene, the theater explodes behind her. Marge's Story Marge dreams that she has sent a letter to Martha Stewart asking for her to help save the family's Christmas. Martha promptly arrives and fills the house with the Christmas decorations Marge has always dreamed of, but the other family members end up as part of the decorations instead of being able to enjoy the holiday with her. Marge quickly realizes that it is Homer and the children that make Christmas special for her, so Martha gets rid of all the decorations with a magic wand. Marge then wakes up on Christmas Day to find that her family has brought her the ingredients for breakfast in bed. Their attempts to cook it go awry, so they go out for breakfast instead. Maggie's Story Maggie dreams that the entire family has become puppets in a theater. As the Simpsons prepare for a trip to Hawaii and ask Moe to house-sit for them, Homer's boss Mr. Burns pays a surprise visit. He soon learns that Homer has feigned a neck injury to get time off work for the trip and calls his attack hounds on him. However, only one arrives (represented by a crude sock puppet), since the show has spent its budget on Katy Perry, who appears as herself and Moe's girlfriend. Noticing that Burns is disappointed by the lack of his attack hounds, Katy gives him a kiss. Touched by this, Burns decides to forgive the Simpsons and allows them to enjoy their trip in Hawaii, and then everyone sings a parody of \\"Twelve Days of Christmas\\" which plays during the credits. At the end of the credits, Moe attempts to kiss Katy but is not tall enough to reach her mouth, so he instead opts to kiss her bellybutton through her dress. Katy retorts that he is not kissing her bellybutton, meaning that he is actually kissing her vulva, but also says she did not tell Moe to stop. Production \\"The Fight Before Christmas\\" was written by Dan Castellaneta (who provides the voice of Homer on The Simpsons) and his wife Deb Lacusta, as part of the show's twenty-second season. It was directed by Bob Anderson and Matthew Schofield. Similar to the show's Treehouse of Horror episodes, this episode features several segments. Since all four of them are set during Christmas, the episode was originally broadcast in December 2010. There have been many Christmas episodes on The Simpsons ever since the first episode of the series, the 1989 holiday special \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\", and \\"The Fight Before Christmas\\" was not the first time a Christmas episode was divided into segments. Several parts of the episode were inspired by popular culture. The train that appears in the first dream segment references the train featured in the children's book The Polar Express and its film adaptation. In Santa's office building at the North Pole, the characters Schroeder (from Peanuts) and Bumble (from Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer) are seen. The second segment references the plot of the film Inglourious Basterds in that Marge blows up a movie theater with Adolf Hitler and other Nazis in it. In addition, the propaganda film that is playing in the theater features an evil version of the Disney character Dumbo flying over London and dropping bombs. American media personality Martha Stewart guest starred in \\"The Fight Before Christmas\\" as an animated version of herself. Her appearance was announced to the press in April 2010. Stewart commented in an interview that she enjoyed recording her part, which she described as \\"pretty true to life\\". She also noted that \\"the writers are excellent\\" and joked that they \\"worked very hard with me to make sure I wasn't too bad.\\" Stewart has expressed interest in guest starring on the show again in one of the Treehouse of Horror episodes, since her favorite holiday is Halloween.Video interview with Martha Stewart originally published by Fox Broadcasting Company in 2010. Retrieved 2011-08-19. Live-action segment Katy Perry appears alongside puppet versions of Simpsons characters in a live- action segment in the episode. The episode contains a live-action segment featuring characters from the show as puppets and a guest appearance from singer Katy Perry as herself. It parodies the two television series The Muppet Show and Sesame Street, both of which feature Jim Henson's Muppets. References to those shows include puppet versions of Grampa and Jasper heckling the cast of the Simpsons puppet show from a box seat in the manner of Statler and Waldorf from The Muppet Show, and Moe devouring cookies like Cookie Monster does on Sesame Street. Brad Trechak of AOL TV noted that \\"the plot of the segment was silly and simplistic in line with the style of Sesame Street but had some real adult moments like one would see on The Muppet Show.\\" The segment was inspired by the announcement that Perry would appear as herself on Sesame Street. This appearance, which sees her performing a version of her song \\"Hot n Cold\\" with Elmo, was originally to appear on the forty-first- season premiere of the educational children's program on September 27, 2010. However, on September 23 it was announced that it had been cut from the show because some parents who had seen the appearance online complained about the revealing clothes worn by Perry. Sesame Workshop said in a statement that \\"In light of the feedback we've received on the Katy Perry music video which was released on YouTube only, we have decided we will not air the segment on the television broadcast of Sesame Street, which is aimed at preschoolers. Katy Perry fans will still be able to view the video on YouTube.\\" The Simpsons segment was filmed in mid-September 2010, before the controversy began, and thus it was not inspired by the decision to cut Perry's appearance from Sesame Street. Executive producer Al Jean announced to Entertainment Weekly on September 25 that the singer would guest star on the show, commenting that \\"In the wake of Elmo's terrible betrayal, the Simpsons puppets wish to announce they stand felt-shoulder-to-shoulder with Katy Perry.\\" The segment was shot in front of a green screen. This was the third time that a sequence of The Simpsons was shot in live-action ‚Äî the first being the \\"Homer¬≥\\" segment of the 1995 episode Treehouse of Horror VI in which a 3D computer-animated Homer ends up in the real-life world, and in the \\"Terror of Tiny Town\\" segment of Treehouse of Horror IX where Bart and Lisa appear on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee. Perry wears a cleavage-showing, red latex dress in the episode that features characters from the show on it. Entertainment Weekly author Dan Snierson noted that this dress \\"probably wouldn‚Äôt have been Street-approved either\\", and a writer for Metro commented that \\"the Simpsons' producers were certainly not worried about Katy looking too raunchy\\". Perry was a fan of The Simpsons before guest starring. In a video interview, she commented that she \\"thought it was an honor to be asked to be on The Simpsons. The Simpsons, they are kind of like a national treasure when it comes to, you know, America and the whole world.\\" She also stated that she considers it to be one of the highlights of her career, and that she saw it as a sign that she had \\"made it\\".Video interview with Katy Perry originally published by Fox Broadcasting Company in 2010. Retrieved 2011-08-19. Reception In its original American broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on December 5, 2010, the episode was watched by approximately 9.56 million people. It received a 4.2 Nielsen rating in the adults aged 18‚Äì49 demographic, making it the highest- rated episode of the season at that point. The episode was also watched by an 11% share of the television audience. The Simpsons became the highest rated program in Fox's \\"Animation Domination\\" lineup that night, beating The Cleveland Show and American Dad!. In addition, \\"The Fight Before Christmas\\" became the fifth highest-rated program among adults aged 18‚Äì49 the week it aired, and the twentieth highest-rated among all ages. The episode as a whole has received mixed to positive reviews from critics. AOL TV's Brad Trechak wrote that it \\"showed a level of imagination that the recent Halloween episodes have been lacking\\" and that it \\"started good and got progressively better [...]\\". Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club, on the other hand, commented that the segments \\"got weaker as they went along\\". She added the episode \\"wasn't awful, and it did have some solid laughs, but the quality of the segments was decidedly hit and miss.\\" These two critics both praised Bart's dream for being funny and Lisa's dream for its Inglourious Basterds parody. They had different opinions on the last two sequences, though. Trechak thought Stewart \\"really shone in [Marge's dream], playing some sort of parody of herself crossed with Mary Poppins and Satan,\\" and singled out the live- action sequence as his favorite because he is a fan of Jim Henson, the creator of The Muppets. VanDerWerff commented that \\"Marge's visit from Martha Stewart was one joke stretched too far, and the final segment with the Muppet Simpsons was far too stilted.\\" Several other critics have commented on the live-action sequence. Mediaite's Tommy Christopher wrote in a column that the episode was \\"capped off by a pitch-perfect parody of The Muppet Show, but veered into adult humor that would make the Muppet-inspired pottymouths of Avenue Q blush.\\" He commented that the part where Moe thinks he is kissing Perry's bellybutton and she tells him not to stop \\"has got to be a first on network television, breaking the dual taboos of oral sex and puppet-on-human conjugal bliss.\\" The segment was praised by Germain Lussier of /Film, who gave it as an example of how the show, \\"every once in a while, [...] does something so outrageous, we all step back and marvel at their brilliance.\\" Joyce Eng and Kate Stanhope of TV Guide named the sequence the second top television moment of the week.

The Axe Killer (1910 - 10 February 1956) was a South African serial killer who was convicted in 1955 of 15 murders and sentenced to death by hanging. His victims all came from the Umkomaas and Umzimkulu valleys of KwaZulu-Natal. A Zulu man, Msomi was an unsuccessful young sangoma (shaman). Seeking professional assistance, he consulted with another sangoma. Msomi claims that during this exchange he was co-opted by an evil spirit, a tokoloshe. In August 1953, under the instruction of the tokoloshe, Msomi began an 18-month killing spree in the southern KwaZulu-Natal valleys of South Africa. Msomi initially raped and murdered a young woman in the presence of his mistress, whose blood he kept in a bottle. Unimpressed with his 'new' powers, his mistress alerted the police who arrested Msomi. He escaped shortly afterwards, giving credit for his escape to the all-powerful tokoloshe. Msomi returned to his murderous ways, killing five children before being re- arrested. He duly escaped again. Msomi was arrested a month later for petty theft. The stolen items turned out to belong to his victims and he was soon identified as the murderous culprit. Msomi readily assisted the police in finding some of his victims' remains, including a missing skull. Whether he gained further satisfaction from revisiting his crime scenes or felt diminished responsibility in light of the tokoloshe's influence is unclear. During his trial, Msomi claimed that he was merely a conduit for the evil tokoloshe. Two psychologists disagreed, stating that Msomi was in fact of much higher than average intelligence and further that he derived sexual pleasure from inflicting pain. Msomi was sentenced to death by hanging at Pretoria Central Prison. Msomi's reference to the tokoloshe and his numerous escapes had however caused a high level of consternation amongst some of the Zulu community. Upon request, the judge permitted a deputation of nine Zulu Chiefs and Elders to attend the hanging in order to confirm that the tokoloshe did in fact not save Msomi from his death. Even so, one chief felt that Msomi might return after death as a tokoloshe himself.

RAVEN also supports the Tsilhqot‚Äôin National Government and Xeni Gwet'in First Nation in their legal action against Taseko Mines' Prosperity Project which proposes to turn a pristine lake that is part of the Fraser River watershed into a dump site for mine waste. RAVEN claims that assisting the Tsilhqot‚Äôin Nation is a chance to prevent ecological disaster before it takes place. Teztan Biny (known as Fish Lake by settler communities) is being reviewed to become an industrial dump site for the Taseko Mines Prosperity Project. RAVEN works in close alliance with the growing movement of eNGOs (environmental non-governmental organizations). The Tsilhqot'in fight to preserve Teztan Biny (Fish Lake) is now a national issue also on the agenda of NGOs such as MiningWatch Canada and the Council of Canadians. The practice of turning fresh water lakes into toxic waste dump is a matter that concerns everyone.Council of Canadians article by National Water Campaigner Meera Karunananthan The Canadian federal government is not only allowing for this practice through the recent amendment to Schedule 2 of the Metal, Mining and Effluent Regulations (MMER), but also there are 20 more lakes across Canada facing the same fate as Teztan Biny. RAVEN's board of directors includes David Williams of Friends of the Nemaiah Valley, Lynn Hunter and Linda Stanton. Campaigns=Beaver Lake Cree Nation vs. the tar sands The Beaver Lake Cree, a small, impoverished band of 900 people in eastern Alberta, are suing the Canadian federal and Alberta provincial governments to protect the land. They claim that Alberta's tar sands developments are obliterating their traditional hunting and fishing lands in Alberta. The animals, fish, plants and medicine that sustain the Beaver Lake Cree are being destroyed. In Canada, the rights of Indigenous people are constitutionally protected. Led by Chief Al Lameman, the Beaver Lake Cree Nation is asserting a treaty right to hunt and fish throughout lands where tar sands activity is destroying the forest. This court action seeks an injunction against new developments. The Beaver Lake Cree‚Äôs Statement of Claim cites more than 17,000 infringements on their treaty rights and in the course of doing so names every major oil company in the world. Investment in the bituminous sands in northern Alberta ‚Äì the world's last great oil field ‚Äì totals approximately $200 billion. No assessment of the cumulative environmental or cultural damage has been done. It has been argued that this project ‚Äì unhindered ‚Äì will destroy a large part of the great boreal forest of North America, will escalate global warming, and will destroy an indigenous way of life. The Alberta government continues to approve projects, such that production of dirty oil will increase from the current to by 2015. Already vast expanses of the boreal forest have been cut down ‚Äì causing significant damage to the environment and to the earth's well-being. The forest is home to a long list of animals, from black bears and caribou to marten and moose. Chief Al Lameman says they can no longer find caribou herds where caribou were abundant just 12 years ago. Moose are also being displaced in large numbers and simply cannot be found. There is evidence the herds are also not self-sustaining ‚Äì there is not a new calf population to replace the older population of moose. As the forest is eroded to make way for open mines and in-situ mines, the ‚Äògreat lung‚Äô of North America with its rich carbon-storing peat and soil, is disappearing. In its place, rapid growth of carbon emissions threatens to increase the earth's temperature. Meanwhile, oil sands extraction pollutes the earth with its tailings ponds, pollutes the air with its emissions, and pollutes the water using two to four barrels of water to produce just one barrel of bitumen and creating vast lakes of chemicals that leach into local watersheds. =Beaver Lake Cree history= The Beaver Lake Cree is a small Indian community located in eastern Alberta, north-east of Edmonton and just outside Lac La Biche. It currently has approximately 900 members. In the early 19th century, the Hudson's Bay Company built a trading post at Lac La Biche, and the locals hunted, fished and trapped fur to sell to the HBC agents. In the 1870s the Canadian government was involved in a gradual process of treaty making aimed at addressing Aboriginal title and opening up the lands for settlement. By the middle of the decade, food supplies for the plains Cree were running low with a rapid decline in buffalo, and geographical survey crews were running into tensions with the local inhabitants. In July 1875, Cree warriors stopped a telegraph crew at the fork of the Saskatchewan River. In response the Canadian government sent Treaty Commissioner Alexander Morris to meet with Cree, Chipewyan and Salteaux leaders beginning on August 15, 1876. Discussions lasted for several days and included many pipe ceremonies. The pipe ceremonies were viewed by the Cree people as a mark of the solemnity of the occasion. In the presence of the pipe only the truth could be told and it was understood that promises made as part of such ceremonies would be kept. For their part, the Commissioners invoked the name of the Queen, and made the treaty promises in her name. Beaver Lake's immediate ancestors met with Commissioner Morris at Fort Pitt in September, 1876. There Morris gave this speech: > ‚Ä¶ I see the Queen's Councillors taking the Indian by the hand saying we are > brothers, we will lift you up, we will teach you, if you will learn, the > cunning of the white man. All along the road I see Indians gathering, I see > gardens growing and houses building; I see them receiving money from the > Queen's Commissioners to purchase clothing for their children, at the same > time I see them enjoying their hunting and fishing as before, I see them > retaining their old mode of living with the Queen's gift in addition. Chief Pay-ay-sis signed Treaty 6. He and the other chiefs surrendered approximately 195,000 square kilometres of land . In return for their land, they were promised that they would be able to hunt and fish to make a living from the land as they had always done, and they were promised that each band member would be paid $5.00 per year. The promise to pay $5.00 per year to each Cree person has been faithfully kept every year. The important text of Treaty 6 is: > The Plain and Wood Cree Tribes of Indians, and all other the Indians > inhabiting the district hereinafter described and defined, do hereby cede, > release, surrender and yield up to the Government of the Dominion of Canada, > for Her Majesty the Queen and Her successors forever, all their rights, > titles and privileges, whatsoever, to the lands included within the > following limits‚Ä¶ Her Majesty further agrees with Her said Indians that > they, the said Indians, shall have right to pursue their avocations of > hunting and fishing throughout the tract surrendered as hereinbefore > described, subject to such regulations as may from time to time be made by > Her Government of Her Dominion of Canada, and saving and excepting such > tracts as may from time to time be required or taken up for settlement, > mining, lumbering or other purposes by Her said Government of the Dominion > of Canada, or by any of the subjects thereof duly authorized therefor by the > said Government. There is a tension built into the treaty between the Crown's right to take up land, and the enduring right of the Indians to hunt and fish. In the 19th century the amount of unspoiled land available for hunting and fishing was so huge that no amount of settlement seemed to affect the wildlife populations. For over one hundred years under the treaty there was always a meaningful opportunity to hunt and fish, so conflict between the Crown's rights and the Indian's rights did not arise. But in the last two decades, the tar sands developments have encroached on such huge amounts of land that there is now a conflict between the viability of the treaty rights and the Crown's right to continue to alienate land. The law in this situation has recently been expressed by the Supreme Court of Canada. The Crown cannot take up so much land as to compromise the meaningful right to hunt. If game becomes so scarce that the Indians would have to travel too far, and expend too much effort to make the hunting worthwhile, then the treaty right is no longer meaningful. If that decrease in the abundance of fish and wildlife is caused by Crown actions, then the Crown actions can be declared unconstitutional. =The tar sands and potential impact on the Beaver Lake Cree= The Athabasca oil sands deposit represents the second largest known deposit of oil in the world - after Saudi Arabia. There are estimated to be more than a trillion barrels of oil embedded in the sands, with an estimated considered to be recoverable.Alberta Department of Energy, ‚ÄúAlberta Oil Sands 2006 (updated December 2007,) Edmonton, AB, 2007 Production of synthetic crude oil from the tar sands is well under way ‚Äì Alberta is producing about of dirty oil per day.Nikiforuk, Andrew, Tar Sands - Dirty Oil and the Future of a Continent, Greystone Books, Vancouver, Canada, 2008 (in collaboration with the David Suzuki Foundation). As of December 2007, there were approximately 4,264 oil sands agreements within the province, totaling 64,919 square kilometres. http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/OilSands/792.asp That amount is expected to double or triple in the next few years, based on recent massive private investment in these projects. The environmental liabilities that result from the various steps in oil sands extraction and refining process include: i. Destruction of the boreal forest eco-system ii. Damage to the Athabasca watershed iii. Heavy consumption of natural gas iv. Creation of toxic tailings ponds v. Increased release of greenhouse gases i. Destruction of the boreal forest eco-system All of the oil sands leases slated for development are located in the boreal forest. The boreal forest is particularly valuable for its ability to store large amounts of carbon in its bogs, peat, soil, and trees. The destruction of boreal forest reduces the earth's capacity to store carbon and releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as it is destroyed. The currently proposed oil sands projects, if all were to be activated, would directly remove an area of boreal forest eco-system twice the size of Ireland.Sierra Club website, ‚ÄúTar Sands and the Boreal Forest,‚Äù 2006: http://www.tarsandstimeout.ca/index. php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=36&Item; Destruction of the forest eliminates the habitat for birds, fish, and mammals, including caribou, bear, deer, moose, wolves, coyotes, lynx, wolverine, beaver, fisher, marten, muskrat, and squirrels. Reclamation is not a credible solution. ii. Damage to the Athabasca water shed Two to four and a half barrels of water are required to produce a barrel of oil from the tar sands.Sierra Club website, ‚ÄúTar Sands and Water,‚Äù 2006: ‚Äúhttp://www.tarsandstimeout.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=33&Item...; Water is used to create the slurry of bitumen and oil that is heated and processed. Water is also disposed of through Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage method of extraction where steam is pumped into the ground to cause bitumen to flow into a lower pipe for removal. For every barrel of oil produced approximately one barrel of water is contaminated in the process and deposited into a tailings pond. At present, large water allocations from the Athabasca River are assigned to industrial use. A recent Alberta government report concluded that: ‚ÄúOver the long term, the Athabasca River may not have sufficient flows to meet the needs of all the planned mining operations and maintain adequate instream flows.‚ÄùGovernment of Alberta, Oil Sands Ministerial Strategy Committee, ‚ÄúInvesting in our future: Responding to the rapid growth of the oil sands development,‚Äù 2006, p. 112 This is one of Canada's largest rivers. Water impacts threaten fish, wildlife, downstream communities, and transportation in the McKenzie delta.Sierra Club website, ‚ÄúLiving Downstream - Growing Water Concerns in the NWT,‚Äù 2006: ‚Äúhttp://www.tarsandstimeout.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=30&Item...; The toxicity of the tailings ponds also represent threats to local aquifers and to the quality of water in the Athabasca River due to the danger of seepage or a sudden and large catastrophic failure of a pond's enclosure. Already there have been reports of unusually high incidence of certain kinds of cancer in the populations living downstream.‚ÄúOilsands-area hamlet supports whistleblower MD ‚Äì Physician raised concerns about high cancer rates downstream from oil projects‚Äù http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2007/03/05/alberta-doctor-070305.html. iii. Heavy consumption of natural gas Natural gas is burned to heat the bitumen in the tar sands in order to extract the liquid oil. The energy equivalent of one barrel of oil in natural gas is needed to produce three barrels of synthetic crude. Producing a barrel of oil from the oil sands requires approximately one thousand cubic feet of natural gas. Natural gas is a fossil fuel, and when it burns to create heat it adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. But the additional concern is that natural gas releases less carbon dioxide per unit of energy produced than oil does - especially heavy oil, or synthetic crude. So, a relatively clean non-renewable fossil fuel is being burned to create a very dirty fossil fuel.Polaris Institute website, ‚ÄúDirty Little Secret: Canada‚Äôs Global Warming Engine,‚Äù Alberta Tar sands Profile Series, 2007. See also George Monbiot, Heat, Anchor Books, Canadian Edition 2007, page 82. iv. Creation of toxic tailings ponds The ‚Äútailings‚Äù from the bitumen retrieval and refining processes include sand, silt and clay mixed with leftover hydrocarbons and other toxic substances. Tailings are being created at a rate of 2,000 or so litres per barrel of bitumen, resulting in about 1.8 billion litres of tailings every day. In May 2008, tailings ponds covered approximately 130 km2 of Alberta.Pembina, Fact or Fiction, at p. 41. Tailings ponds include substances of concern for the water quality that discharge to surface waters: ‚Ä¢ salts ‚Ä¢ elevated sodium, chloride, sulphate ‚Ä¢ elevated total dissolved solids, pH, conductivity and alkalinity ‚Ä¢ lower calcium and magnesium (soft water) ‚Ä¢ variable levels of trace metals, including boron, arsenic and strontium ‚Ä¢ elevated ammonia ‚Ä¢ naphthenic acids, phenols, hydrocarbons ‚Ä¢ and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ‚Ä¢ other acute and chronic toxicantsJennifer Grant, Fact or Fiction: Oil Sands Reclamation, Drayton Valley, AB: Pembina Institute, 2008, p.36 In many cases, huge ponds sit with very short berms separating them from the Athabasca River. The Athabasca is the source river of the McKenzie watershed ‚Äì downstream are communities that depend on the river for their water and livelihood. It is the principal source of food fish for Aboriginal communities. In April 2008, considerable press coverage arose when 500 ducks landed on the Syncrude tailings pond and died. Syncrude did not report the incident and it only became public because of an anonymous tip. Provincial regulations require the use of scarecrows and soundmakers to attempt to divert the birds from the ponds, but these were not functioning at the time. A member of the Sierra Club of Alberta, Jeh Custer, started a private prosecution against Syncrude in 2008. A private prosecution for an environmental office is a legal proceeding where an individual attempts to enforce an environmental statute, in circumstances where the Crown prosecutors fail to do so. Such private prosecutions almost always fail. But they serve to embarrass governments who are not doing their job. On February 10 both Canada and Alberta commenced formal court proceedings against Syncrude for the same offences. If convicted, Syncrude could face a maximum $300,000 fine. v. The release of greenhouse gases There are three main sources of greenhouse gas increases resulting from tar sands extractions: 1\\\\. Release of carbon from the living boreal forest as it is destroyed. 2\\\\. Burning of natural gas, itself a fossil fuel, in the refining process 3\\\\. The carbon released from the bitumen itself. Because of the huge amount of greenhouse gas release in the process of creating synthetic crude oil, Alberta produces three times more greenhouse gas emissions per capita than the Canadian average and six times the West European average. The earth's atmosphere currently contains about 459 ppm CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases.Monbiot, Bring on the Apocalypse, Anchor Books, 2008, page 44. At that elevated level we are now into the danger zone. It is well understood that as the concentrations of CO2 approach 550 ppm there is near certainty that the earth will warm 2 degrees, and will probably warm 3 degrees, an amount of warming that would be fully catastrophic. Over the next 30 years as the tar sands are exploited under current plans, this one source alone will add about 65 ppm of carbon dioxide to earth's atmosphere. Even if nobody else on earth created carbon dioxide over the next 30 years, exploitation of the tar sands will push the level of CO2 in our atmosphere to 525 ppm. This one source will single-handedly cancel out all worldwide efforts to control climate change. All the good effects of conservation, conversion to solar, wind, tidal, geothermal and other expensive unconventional energy sources will be for nothing, because this one industrial project will continue pushing up the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and equivalent greenhouse gases. All the planning and sacrifice by the rest of the world will be cancelled out by this one industry. And, in the course of exploiting the tar sands and destroying the boreal forest, the treaty rights of the Beaver Lake Cree Nation will be rendered meaningless. =Co-operative Bank supports BLCN with its Toxic Fuels Campaign= In February 2009, The Co-operative Financial Services announced it was backing the Beaver Lake Cree legal action. In the bank's press release, Paul Monaghan, Head of Social Goals and Sustainability at CFS said: ‚ÄúWe already know that commercialisation of tar sands risks massive environmental damage. If the Beaver Lake Cree Nation are successful in their ground-breaking legal challenge and other indigenous groups follow, oil companies could also be looking at massive investment damages.‚Äù CFS launched its Toxic Fuels campaign, designed to \\"combat the shocking global trend of extracting oil from unconventional sources, such as tar sands and shale oil. Such exploitation threatens global efforts to avoid dangerous levels of climate change and risks local ecological disaster.\\" The Toxic Fuels campaign has a direct link to RAVEN in order to provide financial support for the lengthy and costly legal action. CFS has donated more than ¬£100,000 towards the Beaver Lake Cree's lawsuit.Guardian article, July 20, 2009, http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jul/20/canada-cree-tar-sands \\\\---- The Tsilhqot'in fight to save Teztan Biny Taseko Mines Ltd. is proposing to develop the Prosperity Mine, a massive open pit gold and copper mine, deep within the traditional territory of the Tsilhqot'in Nation. The proposed Prosperity Mine is located in south central British Columbia, approximately 125 km southwest of Williams Lake, on an alpine plateau in the Chilcotin, beneath the rugged glaciated peaks of the Coast Range. The Prosperity Mine, if developed, would be situated in a site of exceptional natural splendor, close to the Nemaiah Valley, Ts'yl-os Provincial Park, and the ?Elegesi Qayus Wild Horse Preserve. A statement prepared by the Tsilhqot'in National Government and placed on the RAVEN website says: > the proposed mine‚Äôs two kilometer-wide open pit, tailings pond, waste rock > piles, roads, and transmission lines would destroy an entire sub-alpine > ecosystem, and most importantly Teztan Biny, a lake sacred to the > Tsilhqot'in Nation, and known to others as Fish Lake. Teztan Biny is a > beautiful mountain lake which our ancestors have used and managed since time > immemorial. Teztan Biny supports a vibrant population (some 85,000) of > genetically unique Rainbow Trout that provide a critical food source for the > Tsilhqot'in people and local wildlife; including blue-listed species of > concern such as Grizzly Bears. For generations the Tsilhqot'in have gone to Teztan Biny to fish, to set fish traps and nets, hunt and trap, gather medicines, engage in spiritual practices, reconnect with the land, honor their elders, share stories, and foster unity. It is more than a lake to the Tsilhqot'in ‚Äì it is an integral part of Tsilhqot'in culture, and vital to their cultural continuity and survival. Many non-Aboriginal local residents and tourists also enjoy Teztan Biny for a wide variety of recreational activities. The Tsilhqot'in Nation is neither against development nor against the responsible use of natural resources. In fact, as the traditional keepers of the land for thousands of years, we have successfully balanced the need for sustainable harvesting with long-term preservation. To the Tsilhqot'in people, the destruction of Teztan Biny is an unacceptable use of land and water, incompatible with modern principles of sustainability, and an ill-conceived and shortsighted attempt to inject an industrial project into the heart of our pristine watershed. For generations the Tsilhqot‚Äôin people have gone to Teztan Biny, and the streams and wetlands surrounding it, nourish Fish Creek and the Taseko River, critical habitat areas for Chinook and sockeye salmon. It is here that wild salmon begin their long journey to the Pacific Ocean via the Chilko, the Chilcotin and ultimately, the Fraser River. Teztan Biny is a vital part of the watershed that supports one of the largest and most productive salmon fisheries in North America. We have deep concerns that any toxic effluents that seep from the mine tailings and waste rock facilities at the proposed mine could negatively impact BC's already threatened Fraser salmon fishery. Chief Marilyn Baptiste, following in the long tradition of strong Tsilhqot'in leaders, has again taken the Tsilhqot‚Äôin claims to court by filing another case seeking a specific declaration of an Aboriginal right to fish in Teztan Biny. She is acting on behalf of our elders, our leaders and future generations. Currently, the Tsilhqot'in Nation Government (TNG) is participating in the environmental assessment process conducted by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA) to ensure that our voice is heard. The financial, social and time pressures placed on our government and our people by this process are immense. An independent review panel has been named, and public hearings will take place this summer. The review panel is scheduled to make a recommendation by the fall of 2009. Taseko Mines Ltd. is strongly advocating for an expedited process to ensure construction begins in winter 2010. =Issues of concern= Significant environmental and social impacts can be summarized as: 1- Reclassification of Fish Lake as a Tailings Pond - The proposed mine requires the conversion of a fish bearing lake - Fish Lake also named Tetzan Biny - to a permanent waste rock disposal area, and its upstream watershed as a permanent storage facility for mine tailings and effluent. The destruction of this lake requires federal Cabinet approval in the form of a regulatory amendment to the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations (MMER), Schedule 2 Here is an example of one such amendment: http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp- pr/p2/2009/2009-02-18/html/sor-dors27-eng.html because it would otherwise contravene a critical provision of the Fisheries Act that protects fish habitat. MMER Schedule 2 amendments are highly controversial in Canada, and Canada is one of the few countries in the world that allows such an industrial practice. More than a dozen lakes and water bodies are currently being considered for this kind of industrial application in Canada. Teztan Biny, which requires to be ‚ÄúScheduled‚Äù under this proposal is considered to be one of the most productive rainbow trout lakes in BC. The proponent suggests that they cannot access the ore body without destroying Fish Lake and proposes creating a replacement lake (to be called ‚ÄúProsperity Lake‚Äù) as a means of compensating for the loss of Fish Lake and upstream and downstream spawning habitat.iv 2- Aboriginal Rights and Title ‚ÄìThe Tsilhqot‚Äôin Nation, which comprises six member communities, has lived in the area of the proposed mine since before contact with European settlers, and maintains claims to Aboriginal rights and title throughout the area. In particular, the Tsilhqot‚Äôin Nation has already proven its Aboriginal right to hunt and trap in the area of the proposed mine,Tsilhqot'in Nation v. British Columbia, 2007 BCSC 1700 and is seeking a further court declaration of a specific Aboriginal right to fish at Teztan Biny. The Tsilhqot‚Äôin people fish, hunt, trap and gather berries and traditional medicines throughout the area. There is, in effect, no way to build the mine without precluding Tsilhqot‚Äôin land use in the affected area. The proposed construction of the mine, irrespective of other issues, pits the economic priority of industrial development against proven and asserted Aboriginal rights and title, and seriously undermines efforts at the reconciliation of the Crown's assertion of sovereignty with the prior occupation of Aboriginal people on this land. 3- Metal Leaching and Acid Rock Drainage - Modern industrial scale mining of copper based ore bodies can release heavy metals (ML) and Acid Rock Drainage (ARD), into surface and groundwater. The naturally occurring sulphuric content of rock reacts with exposure to water and air to produce sulphuric acid. Both of these processes are accelerated by the crushing and refining of the ore body through the process of mining. Open pit mining, in particular, requires the processing of tremendous quantities of waste rock and overburden to access the comparatively small grades of ore contained in the deposit. Lastly, the presence of sulphuric acid accelerates the leaching of toxic metals. The entire process is called ML/ARD, and is presently the single greatest adverse environmental effect of mining in accordance with modern industrial standards. The effects of ML/ARD are difficult to predict, and tend to arise decades after the commencement of a mines operation, and can produce lasting, chronic, and sometimes irremediable environmental damage. Often, the corporate entity that developed the mine has ceased to exist by the time problems arise, and the bonding and securities required of the proponent by government are insufficient to remedy or mitigate the damages. The costs are borne by tax payers and local residents and future generations. The Kemess North Joint Review Panel final analysis concluded : ‚ÄúThe Panel believes that the creation of a long-term legacy of substantial mine site management and maintenance obligations,lasting for thousands of years, represents a major imposition on future generations.‚Äù,Kemess North Copper-Gold Mine Joint Review Panel Report Summary ‚Äì September 17, 2007 p. 16 On March 7, 2008, the Government of Canada and the Province of British Columbia announced that they will accept the recommendation of an independent environmental assessment panel that the proposed Kemess North copper-gold mine should not proceed in its present form.,Environmental Impact Statement/Application March 2009, Taseko Mines Limited, Volume 1 p.7-4 Prosperity Gold-Copper Project 4-Potential Impacts to the Fraser Basin watershed ‚Äì Fish Lake is at approximately 1400m above sea level, and sits atop a bench between two low mountain tops. The lake, and the site of the proposed mine, waste rock area, and tailings impoundments area, are perched above the Taseko River, which connects downstream with the highly productive salmon-bearing Chilko and Chilcotin Rivers before entering the Fraser River below Williams Lake. Some 240 m tonnes of potentially acid generating waste rock will need to be stored permanently underwater behind a massive dam to be built across the Fish Lake watershed. This structure will need to be maintained in perpetuity, for if the water capping the waste rock was to drain, acid generation in the exposed wasterock would present a serious environmental risk to downstream fisheries. Any inadvertent, accidental or even naturally caused effluent discharge from the tailings dam will inevitably end up in these river systems with potentially catastrophic results to one of BC's most valuable fish runs. The massive dam and stored effluent and waste rock on the Fish Lake watershed would also pose serious threats for groundwater contamination by mine effluents draining from beneath the impoundment into the rocks and groundwater systems feeding the Taseko River. Any heavy metals stored in dissolved or solid form in the tailings will pose a risk to Taseko River water quality. All of these risks last not only for the mine life but forever, requiring a significant continual investment of inspection and maintenance effort by future generations. 5- Free Entry ‚Äì The conflict over land use priorities in the Chilcotin-Cariboo region was generated by a provision in the BC Mineral Tenure Act which permits prospectors, prospective prospectors, and anyone else with a credit card, to stake mineral claims to an area over the internet, and for a few dollars acquire a legally enforceable property interest in the minerals contained within that claim. Upon further application, the mineral claim can be converted to a long term lease with significant proprietary surface rights which are critical to mine development. These ‚ÄúFree Entry‚Äù provisions of the Mineral Tenure Act effectively trump the rights of surface rights holders, and in particular the Act does not recognize any other interest in the land, for example the interests of First Nations. While the provisions of the Mineral Tenure Act have generated hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenues for the province and markedly encouraged mineral prospecting and mine development in the short-term, the free entry system precipitates the inevitable conflicts that result where the rights of established land users are trumped by other interests, often pitting local and foreign interests against one another. While land use planning in BC continues to integrate the values and priorities of local interests and stakeholders, the provisions of the Mineral Tenure Act, undermine the devolution.

The band stated, \\"Our desire was to record a raw and stripped down record, and once we hit the studio, things developed so quickly that it was clear that recording just an EP was out of the question.\\" 18.61 was mixed by Kurt Ballou of Converge at his own GodCity studio. 18.61 is the final album released by 108 with lead singer Robert Fish. In March 2010, before the official release of 18.61, Fish announced his departure citing that he was \\"struggling to find my place within 108 due to the personal evolution I have gone through.\\" After the departure of Fish, the remaining members of 108 discussed the possibilities of ending the band and breaking up. However, in April 2010, the band announced that 108 would continue without Robert Fish. While the band has no intention of replacing their former lead singer, 108 will still tour in support of 18.61 and continue writing new music. Commenting on the departure of Fish, guitarist Vic DiCara stated, \\"Robert's contribution to the band was so vast and touched so many aspects of 108, that we fully realize [we] can not 'replace' him. We don't plan to try. Instead, we will do something very different from what we did as a band with him.\\" The theme of 18.61 continues with 108's strong interest in Hare Krishna. The title of the album references the 61st couplet of the 18th chapter of the sacred Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita. The passage translates in English to \\"The controller of all lies at the heart of the machine, and connects its wires to the living being who is under its spell.\\" ReceptionTrack listing # \\"God Talk\\" ‚Äì 1:04 # \\"Crescent Moon\\" ‚Äì 1:28 # \\"18.61\\" ‚Äì 2:22 # \\"Reduced\\" ‚Äì 2:20 # \\"Relentless Masters\\" ‚Äì 2:20 # \\"Fallen Angel\\" ‚Äì 1:47 # \\"Mannequins\\" ‚Äì 2:00 # \\"Ashes/Dust\\" ‚Äì 2:11 # \\"Forever is Destroyed\\" ‚Äì 2:49 # \\"Early Funeral\\" ‚Äì 5:10 Personnel 108 *Tim Cohen ‚Äì bass guitar *Vic DiCara ‚Äì guitar, vocals *Robert Fish ‚Äì screaming *Michael Justian ‚Äì drums *Jacob Bannon \\\\- vocals on \\"Relentless Masters\\" Production and artwork *Alex Garcia-Rivera ‚Äì producer *Kurt Ballou ‚Äì mixing *Carl Saff ‚Äì mastering *108 ‚Äì art design ReferencesExternal links *Track by Track: 18.61 by 108 Category:2010 albums Category:Deathwish Inc. albums Category:108 (band) albums Category:Albums produced by Kurt Ballou ","title":"18.61"},{"id":"26896025","text":"Stig \\"Vittj√§rv\\" Sundqvist (19 July 1922 ‚Äì 3 August 2011) was a Swedish professional footballer who played as a forward or midfielder.

An associate of the Canadian Music Centre, his music is noted for its frequent use of Jewish themes, its rejection of the avant garde in favor of tonality, and its blend of classical, jazz, and pop elements. His music has been labeled by some critics as \\"eclectic fusion\\". He was commissioned to write works by Robert Aitken, Liona Boyd, Paul Brodie, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Erica Goodman, Joseph Macerollo, the Harbord Bakery, the New Chamber Orchestra of Canada, the Ontario Federation of Symphony Orchestras, John Perrone, and Trio Lyra among others. He remained active as a composer up until his sudden death of a heart attack in 2001. He is the father of singer/songwriter Micah Barnes, cellist Ariel Barnes, and drummer/producer Daniel Barnes. Life Born in Toronto, Barnes entered The Royal Conservatory of Music (RCM) in 1952 where he was a pupil of Samuel Dolin (piano), Victor Feldbrill (conducting), Ernst Krenek (composition), Boyd Neel (conducting), Walter Susskind (conducting), and John Weinzweig (composition). He graduated from the RCM in 1955 after which he entered the Vienna Academy of Music where he earned a master's degree in 1961. He also spent summers during the 1950s studying at the Chigiana School in Siena, Italy and the Tanglewood Music Center in Lenox, Massachusetts. During the 1960s and 1970s, Barnes was highly active as a conductor in North America, both as a guest conductor and in staff positions. He notably founded the Toronto Repertory Ensemble (TRE) in 1964, a group which commissioned and performed contemporary Canadian music under his leadership through 1973. A number of the TRE's concerts were broadcast on CBC Radio and Television. From 1961-1963 he conducted and composed music for the Crest Theatre in Toronto. In 1964 he was appointed principal conductor of the St Catharines Symphony Orchestra and Chorus (now the Niagara Symphony Orchestra), a post he held until 1972. At the same time he served as conductor of the Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus of Niagara Falls, New York from 1965-1973. He also conducted and composed music for the Toronto Dance Theatre from 1968-1973 and periodically did similar work for the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1973 Barnes abandoned his work as a conductor in favor of putting his full concentration towards composition. From here on he only conducted performances of his own works, notably doing so for three broadcasts on the CBC Radio program Morningside and for several film and television scoress for the CBC. His 1975 cantata Shir Hashirim was premiered under his baton in July 1999 in Toronto. His last complete composition, Songs of Arrival, premiered at the Historic Old Toronto Summer Music Festival 2000.

It was said to be common in Central Asia, represented mostly by the Tajiks (especially mountain Tajiks) and the Pamir people and the majority of Uzbeks. Characterized by brachycephalic skull, dark hair, light skin (these characteristics are absent in the Pamir people and the mountain Tajiks), narrow protruding nose and fairly strong development of the tertiary hair cover.–ü–∞–º–∏—Ä–æ-—Ñ–µ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è —Ä–∞—Å–∞ ‚Äî article from the Great Soviet Encyclopedia (3rd edition). During the Bronze Age, the Pamir-Fergana type was widely represented on the territory of Central Asia among the Indo-European population.  Classification  In the late 19th and first three decades of the 20th century the most characteristic representatives of this race, the population of the Western Pamir, was attributed to the Eastern branch of the Alpine race. But in the early second decade of the 20th century, appeared a classification, that distinguishes this type as an independent race, standing in the same row with Armenoid, Dinaric, and Alpine races. Such theories were joined to the Soviet researchers of Central Asia in the 20-30-s. In Le Razze e i popoli della terra, Renato Biasutti offers the Armenoid as a sub-type of the Pamirian (Anatolico- Pamirian).  Origin  According to Ginzburg (1966),Ginsburg, V.V. (1966) Enstehung der mittelasiatischen zwischenstromtipus. Homo 17. 172‚Äì190. In: International Journal of Central Asian Studies, Volume 3, 1998. ISSN 1226-4490. the Pamir-Fergana race was developed from intermixture of the two other Central Asian types: the Andronovo, which went through the process of gracilization (reduction of prominence of facial features), and a Central Asian variant of Mediterranean that became brachycephalic. According to Andrianov (1969, 1991), with the transition of Central Asian peoples from nomadic to agricultural lifestyle, parallel processes of anthropological mixing, on the one hand, brachycephalization and gracilization, on the other, could have occurred here. According to Khodjaev (1981), the Pamir-Fergana race has no ancient origin and is a result of intermixture between different races. According to L.T. Yablonski, at the end of the 1st millennium BC, as a result of centuries of mixing processes among a wide variety of anthropological components, and above all, among descendants of hypomorphic, high-headed Europids and descendants of meso-brachycephalic, mesomorphic Europids with a slightly flattened facial skeleton the foundations for the plain version of the Pamir-Fergana race was created.

Dr. Zeyn il-Abedyn, Egypt's Anti-AIDS Program Director, said that the film was \\"a painful blow to all our efforts to combat the spread of HIV.\\" In an interview with Arabiya.net, he stated that \\"Unnatural sexual practices are second only to blood transfusions as probable causes for infection with this disease\\", which the Egyptian Underground Film society replied is a \\"clear implication that HIV/AIDS only infect male homosexuals.\\" The EUFS continued, stating: \\"By implying this, he completely ignores scientific fact; statistics have shown that AIDS is also widespread among heterosexuals and children. Instead of raising public awareness about safe sex, such statements are misleading and create a false sense of security; they create a popular belief that HIV/AIDS only infects a certain class of people, leading to the illusion of safety which, in turn, leads to the spread of the disease.\\" Regarding responses of conservative Muslim figures, Maher Sabry said \\"I‚Äôm not surprised that this happened. It was expected, yet it‚Äôs still painful to me, because it‚Äôs an indication of just how backward we‚Äôve become. We‚Äôre now living in an age of cultural regression, an age where dissidents, presidential candidates and religious minorities are thrown into jail. We claim to be emulating Islamic civilization; but if the people who built that civilization were alive today, there would have been fatwas pronounced against them, and their books and other works would have been burned.\\" Awards In 2011, All My Life earned the Audience Award in the category of Narrative Feature at the 7th FACE √† FACE film festival.

The series was a spin-off of Rona Jaffe's 1958 novel The Best of Everything and the 1959 film of the same name. Plot The show focuses upon four young secretaries and their lives in an intense publishing firm: Linda, April, Kim, and Barbara. They were tormented by their ruthless head editor, Amanda Key, and counseled by the warm and loving Violet Jordan. Although the soap opera was short-lived, there were several plotlines, including Kim being brutally attacked by a mysterious villain named Squirrel. The series also revolved around Barbara, who had become depressed since her marriage failed. Production history The soap opera premiered on March 30, 1970, at 12 Noon Eastern time. The Best of Everything replaced reruns of Bewitched and premiered alongside A World Apart on ABC.\\"Bing And Bill Top TV Slate\\" by Jack Gaver, The Sandusky Register, March 27, 1970, p.22 The series was executive produced by creator/headwriter James Lipton. Jacqueline Babbin was the producer. The production company was 20th Century Fox Television in association with the ABC Television Network. The Best of Everything was videotaped at ABC-TV Studio 17 in New York City. The series' opening and closing credits used a video shot of sea gulls in flight over New York Harbor. Nashville artist Connie Eaton recorded a version of the series' instrumental theme, using lyrics which she sang on an episode telecast near the end of the program's network run. The single was released in 1970 by the Chart label. Both the theme song's melody and lyrics were composed by headwriter James Lipton.

The Best of Everything came in at the bottom of the ratings with an 1.8 rating, one of the lowest figures ever recorded for a US soap opera. One reason for the show's failure was its time slot: 12 noon Eastern Time (11am Central), in which it competed against the original run of Jeopardy! on NBC, then at the height of its daytime popularity.

It may be derived from an epithet or may be a calque or phono-semantic match to the Irish word gearr which translates as short. According to the Irish Times Households in the 19th Century database, 'Gear' as a surname was found to be exclusive to Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Kilkenny and Offaly with the majority in Kerry. However, 70% of McGirr households in the 19th Century were found in Tyrone and almost exclusively in Ulster. The name McGirr is most common in Tyrone and is associated with the Cen√©l Fearadhaigh of Clogher barony. The Annals of Ulster states that Cu-Uladh (The hound of Ulster) McGhirr-McCawell (MacCathmhaoil), 'chieftain of his own tribe', was an illustrious professor of science in England in 1368. In the aftermath of the Great Famine with the mass emigration of Irish it was very common for Irish to conceal their roots to avoid discrimination and names were commonly changed, i.e. O'Donnell to Dodds. There are Shorts listed in Kirkcudbrightshire east Scotland and a few McGirrs; however, the McGirr name is far more prominent in Ireland than in Scotland. The Ulster Annals show Cu- Uladh McGhirr-McCawell(MacCathmhaoil) was perhaps too well established to be among the gall√≥glaigh. Edward Shortt, the son of a vicar who served as British Home secretary in the 1920s, has family roots that originate from County Tyrone. Feradach, of the Cen√©l Fearadhaigh, was the son of Muiredach and great-grandson of Niall, whose descendants included the MacCawells (MacCathmhaoil), as well as the Irish Campbells in the Clogher area. MacGilmartin were chiefs in the barony of Clogher, and one was chief of Cenel Fearadaigh in 1166. In 1365 when Malachy of the Mac Cathmhaoil, the ruling house of Clogher, slew an O'Neill of T√≠r Eoghain, Malachy was known as . Translated, this is Malachy the son of the short-fellow Mac Cathmhaoil. This feat of slaying an O‚ÄôNeill warranted a change of name so he became Malachy or simply Malachy MacGirr. Later this family survived the Ulster Plantation, receiving a number of grants of lands at the time. They are to be found later in the 1660s as taxpayers in the Clogher Valley and elsewhere in Tyrone. Today the family is generally found as McGirr, McGerr, McKerr and in the anglicised version as Short.

Prior to that, he was the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia from 1950 to 1956. Biography=Early life Nikolai Semyonovich Patolichev was born in 1908 in Zolino in Vladimir Governorate (now Nizhny Novgorod Oblast) in a peasant family of Russian ethnicity, the son of a Red Army hero in the Russian Civil War, and was orphaned at the age of twelve. After working in factories, he became a Komsomol activist. From an early age, Joseph Stalin had taken an interest in Patolichev. Nikolai's father, Semyon Patolichev, had been a good friend of Stalin's before he was killed in the Polish-Soviet War in 1920. Nikolai Patolichev joined the Communist Party in 1928 in the city of Dzerzhinsk as a Komsomol. Preparations for war economy Patolichev first arrived in Yaroslavl in August 1938, as a \\"special representative of the Central Committee of the CPSU (Communist Party of the Soviet Union),\\" and was tasked with \\"strengthening defense-related production of synthetic rubber at the largest industrial plant in the Soviet Union, located in the city of Yaroslavl.\\" Patolichev was promoted to first secretary of the Yaroslavl Oblast Party Committee in January 1939. The following March, at the 18th Party Congress, he was elected a candidate member of the Central Committee of the CPSU. In February 1941, at the 18th All-Union Conference of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Patolichev was promoted to full membership on the Central Committee. On 28 December 1941, Patolichev was relieved from duties in Yaroslavl and transferred to Chelyabinsk. Chelyabinsk, known as Tankograd during the Great Patriotic War, was a major industrial center that contributed greatly to the Soviet war effort against Nazi Germany. Patolichev served as First Secretary of the Chelyabinsk Oblast and City Party Committees from 4 January 1942 to 21 March 1946, and took a hands-on approach with industrial war production, even intervening when factories missed their production targets. A busy year in Moscow In February 1946 Patolichev was recalled to Moscow to head the Organization and Instruction Department of the Central Committee, and was elected to the Orgburo on 18 March 1946. His role was expanded on 6 May 1946, when he was made a secretary of the Central Committee, taking the place of Georgy Malenkov, who was temporarily demoted. In August, Patolichev became chief of the reorganized Organizational- Instructional department, now called the Directorate for the Checking of Party Organs. In the fall of 1946, he became first deputy chairman of the Council for Collective Farm Affairs under his mentor, chairman Andrey Andreyevich Andreyev. His responsibilities in Moscow now included the incongruously combined affairs of agriculture and cadres, which led him to his next assignment in Ukraine. On 3 March 1947, Patolichev and Lazar Kaganovich were sent by Stalin to Ukraine to \\"help\\" Nikita Khrushchev, who had fallen into disfavor. Kaganovich took over Khrushchev's post of First Secretary, with Patolichev becoming Central Committee secretary for agriculture and procurement, de facto Second Secretary. The two did not work well together, and Patolichev requested that Stalin reassign him. He was removed from his posts on the Orgburo and Secretariat on 24 May 1947; his post in the latter body was taken by Mikhail Suslov. Patolichev next became first secretary of the Rostov Oblast and City Party Committees, serving from August 1947 to June 1950. Byelorussian period According to historian Evan Mawdsley, Patolichev \\"...recovered from this 'exile' in 1950, with another surprise appointment. In one of the intervals of a Supreme Soviet meeting Stalin called him in and asked him if he wanted to be first secretary of the Belorussian SSR; Patolichev agreed ('Gotov, tovarishch Stalin ‚Äì otvetil ia'). In the late Stalin years it was not unusual to appoint ethnic Russians to leading posts in the non-Russian republics; Patolichev's task was to raise local agricultural production.\\" Patolichev succeeded Nikolai Gusarov as First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia on 31 May 1950. In October 1952, Patolichev delivered one of the main speeches at the 19th Party Congress and was re-elected to the Central Committee as a full member. At the Central Committee plenum that followed the 19th Congress, he was also elected candidate member of the enlarged Presidium of the Central Committee, which replaced the old Politburo. On 5 March 1953, Patolichev was removed from the Central Committee Presidium in the reorganization that followed Stalin's death. At Lavrenty Beria's instigation, in June 1953 the Presidium attempted to remove Patolichev as first secretary in Byelorussia and replace him with an ethnic Belarusian, Mikhail Zimyanin. At the contentious plenum of the Byelorussian Central Committee that followed, the delegates rallied behind Patolichev and rejected the Presidium's decree, which was later dropped. During the discussion of his dismissal at the plenum, Patolichev made an impassioned speech before the assembled delegates: Patolichev managed to fend off Beria's attempt to remove him, but at the January 1955 Central Committee plenum in Moscow he clashed with Khrushchev over agricultural policy. He was later replaced as first secretary in Byelorussia by ethnic Belarusian Kirill Mazurov, and in July 1956 became first deputy minister of Foreign Affairs. Khrushchev period In 1956 Patolichev was reassigned from Byelorussia once more to Moscow, this time as First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. He served in that position from 1956 to 1958, when he was elevated to the honorable post of Minister of Foreign Trade of the USSR. Though he had a seat on the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Patolichev never returned to the Politburo and thus his influence was less than that of his contemporaries Mikhail Suslov and Yuri Andropov. Patolichev served as Minister of Foreign Trade for twenty-seven years, until Mikhail Gorbachev replaced him. Death and legacy Nikolai Patolichev died in Moscow on 1 December 1989. He was 81 years old at the time of his death. Patolichev is one of two people to have received 11 Order of Lenin decorations. He was also a recipient of the Hero of Socialist Labour (1975, 1978), the Order of the October Revolution (1983), the Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1943), and Honorary citizen of Chelyabinsk (1978).

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Chorley, the archdeaconry of Blackburn, and the diocese of Blackburn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History St Peter's was designed in 1838, and built in 1839‚Äì40 to a design by the Lancaster architect Edmund Sharpe. Its estimated cost in 1839 was ¬£950 (). The land was given by Sir Thomas D. Hesketh. When first built, the church had seating for 400 people. The chancel was added in 1878‚Äì79 by Peter Balmer, an architect from Ormskirk, and in 1892 the church was restored by Richard Knill Freeman. Architecture The church is constructed in sandstone with a slate roof. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave, a chancel, and a slender west tower that is partly embraced by the nave. The westernmost bay of the nave on the north side is gabled and contains lancet windows; its counterpart on the south has an arched doorway. The other bays are separated by buttresses and each contains a tall square-headed two- light window. The east window has five lights and is in Perpendicular style. The tower has diagonal buttresses. Its first stage is tall and originally had open arches on each side; these have been filled in and incorporate windows and a west door. Above is a single-light louvred bell-opening on each face, then a stepped parapet with crocketted pinnacles. It is surmounted by a slender octagonal spire. Inside the church is a west gallery supported by two cast iron columns. The organ was built in about 1900 by Wilkinson and Sons of Kendal. The church is similar in design to the nearby Church of St John the Baptist, Bretherton designed by Sharpe at about the same time. External features The churchyard contains the war graves of three soldiers of World War I, and an airman of World War II.

It was the first program of its kind in the state and one of the oldest in the nation. Dillo Dirt is named after the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), which is a mammal native to Texas. It is also a trademarked product of the City of Austin Water Department. The unique difference between Dillo Dirt and normal compost is that it contains treated municipal sewage sludge along with yard trimmings collected curbside by the City of Austin Resource Recovery Department. These are combined and composted to create Dillo Dirt. Despite this fact, Dillo Dirt meets all Texas and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requirements for \\"unrestricted\\" use, which even includes vegetable gardens. The heat generated in composting () is sufficient to virtually eliminate human and plant pathogens. After active composting for more than a month, the compost is \\"cured\\" for several months, and then screened to produce the finished product. According to the City of Austin, Dillo Dirt contains levels of heavy metals including arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, and zinc. In a separate toxicological analysis of Dillo Dirt, levels of the following pollutants were found: beta-BHC, DDE, dieldrin, endrin aldehyde, benzo(b)fluoranthene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, benzo(a)anthracene, indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene, and bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate. Very few tests have been carried out on Dillo Dirt, so its average pollutant, radioactivity, and carcinogen levels are generally unknown. Controversy Some opponents of the use and sale of Dillo Dirt claim that it contains above-normal amounts of heavy metals and fluoride that will inevitably find their way back into the human food supply. The city, however, states that the metal levels are well below the federal allowable levels. The city does not test for radioactivity or pharmaceutical residue because it is cost prohibitive. Since people routinely flush medications down the toilet against the city's recommendation, Dillo Dirt may contain pharmaceutical residue in some batches. Some medical residue is radioactive from treating cancer patients. Prior to the Austin City Limits Music Festival, held at Zilker Park in Austin on October 4, 2009, the park's soil was resurfaced and amended with Dillo Dirt. During the festival, heavy rains created a large amount of sludgy surface mud, which some concertgoers claim caused them health issues, such as skin rashes, but in the end no conclusive evidence that the Dillo Dirt caused any problems was determined.

Hulme attended South Kensington School of Art, which is now called the Royal College of Art. Cactus flower Hulme became the drawing master at Marlborough College in 1870 and while there he started work on his most famous work. Familiar Wild Flowers was issued in parts as not only did it contain a detailed description of each flower but also its medicinal uses and habitat. The major work was the botanical illustration by Hulme of each flower which was recreated as a colour plate in each volume. In his lifetime, Hulme completed nine volumes which were published at intervals. Hulme was an amateur botanist, antiquarian and natural historian and in 1869 he was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society.Obituary, Proceedings of the Linnean Society, p.42, accessed April 2010 He was drawing master at Marlborough until 1883. He was the Professor of Freehand and Geometrical Drawing at King's College London from 1886. Drawing was not part of the standard curriculum at Kings, but as was common in many colleges, students could enroll for an additional course in drawing with Hulme.A Botanical Artist at Kings , Comment, Kings College Newsletter, p.11, No 164, December 2005, accessed April 2010 In the preceding year he had become a lecturer to the Agricultural Association. Botany seems not to be his only interest as he also published books on heraldry, and on cryptography (Cryptography, the History, Principles, and Practice of Cipher- Writing) - a brief history and an explanation of various techniques of cryptography to his day (end of 19th century). Hulme died at his home at Kew on 10 April 1909. His ninth volume of Familiar Wild Flowers was in production. This and the earlier other eight volumes were published after his death.

History Summary and chronology of RAF Broadwell (PDF, 16 pages) No. 512 Squadron and No. 575 Squadron were based here, flying the Douglas Dakota. In February 1944, No. 512 Squadron was transferred to No. 46 Group at RAF Broadwell. It was a tactical Dakota squadron and started training glider towing and parachute dropping. Its first operation in the new role was a leaflet drop on 17 April 1944 over France; this was followed by intensive flying in and out of France, including dropping parachutists at Arnhem. In fact, 512 Squadron can claim that they were the first planes over on D Day as 3 Dakotas piloted by Fl Lt Hyde, W.O. James Proctor and a C Flight Flying Officer dropped a specialist team at 00.02 on 6th June to try and disrupt the Merville Battery before the main assault. Broadwell took part in the D-Day assaults alongside nearby RAF Down Ampney and RAF Blakehill Farm. On the eve of D-Day, No. 575 Squadron dropped 5 Para into the invasion drop zone. On 6 June, it towed 21 Horsa gliders into France. In the next few weeks it started a casualty evacuation service from France back to England. In September 1944, it was involved in operations at Arnhem where the squadron suffered severe casualties.

The Spanish language is second only in number of native speakers to Mandarin Chinese, the tongue of over 360 million people. Ghost stories exist throughout Spanish- speaking America and in Spain.  Argentina  In the Pampas, and particularly in Carro Quemado, the ghost of a colonel on horseback galloping in search of his soldiers killed by the Indians appears from time to time. In a dwelling in Neuqu√©n in the Patagonia region of Argentina, there are sudden strange fires that the fire department is unable to explain, and in which some have seen ghost appearances. In the city of Buenos Aires is said that in the church \\"St. Felicitas\\", located between Finch Street and Isabel La Cat√≥lica, you can spot the ghost of Felicitas Guerrero and that if a tissue is left in the church at night, the next day it appears bathed with tears.  Mexico  There is extensive and varied belief in ghosts in Mexican culture. The modern state of Mexico before the Spanish conquest was inhabited by diverse peoples such as the Maya and Aztec, and their beliefs have survived and evolved, combined with the beliefs of the Spanish colonists. The Day of the Dead incorporates pre- Columbian beliefs with Christian elements. Mexican literature and movies include many stories of ghosts interacting with the living.  Peru  Ghosts that appear on the second floor of Casa Matusita in downtown Lima, at the intersection of Avenues Spain and Garcilaso de la Vega, seem to be particularly intense, including poltergeists and apparitions, and it is said that the Argentine comedian Humberto Vera Vilchez was driven mad there. The legend is that a man lived in this house who mistreated his two servants. One day, when he offered a lunch to some guests, the servants decided to get revenge and put a substance in food, not to kill his boss, but to cause mental disorders. After serving and while awaiting results of their macabre plan, they suddenly heard noises and screams coming from the room and came back. The picture was terrifying: mangled bodies everywhere, blood on the walls, on the table, on the ground, all the guests, including his boss, had found a tragic death, violent and terrifying. The curious thing about this house is that the paranormal events happen on the second floor and therefore the first floor is rented. It is said that no one can spend five minutes there. The Castillo Real Felipe is located in the city of El Callao port of the capital Lima. Among other legends are that the ghost of an eighteenth-century viceroy appears every night on the stairs and rooms of the castle dungeons, leading many soldiers. Also, chilling screams are heard in the dungeons.  Spain  Graffiti of Santa Compa√±a en Pontevedra. Casa de la Siete Chimeneas Museum of the History of Tenerife or Lercaro Palace The Galician Santa Compa√±a Guestier Asturian or Estadea, Estantiga or phantom Castilian is an ancient procession of candle-lit ghosts that gives very bad luck and portends death, like the banshee in Ireland. La Velilla bell has long sounded in Aragon with nobody touching it to warn of the deaths and deaths of notable people, kings, emperors and so on. Father Benito Jer√≥nimo Feij√≥o y Montenegro attempted to rationalize the fact without getting much clearer. The House of Seven Chimneys of Madrid is haunted by the ghost of a young bride who died of sorrow when her husband, a young captain, died in the Battle of San Quentin. In the same place his father committed suicide by hanging himself in one of the beams of the mansion. It is said that she was the mistress of the king, who sent her husband into battle to die, and subsequently the father imprisoned the young woman to commit incest. A white lady appears bearing a torch on certain nights. There is also talk of a girl married to a rich old man who was stabbed to death in his basement. On the island of Tenerife lies the Lercaro Palace, now the Museum of the History of Tenerife, located in the city of San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna. In this mansion legend appears the ghost of Catalina Lercaro, who according to legend committed suicide by throwing herself into a well of her mansion when she was forced to marry a man she did not love. It is one of the most famous ghost stories in Spain. On Monasterio de Madrid street there is an antiquarian shop, \\"El ba√∫l del monje\\", in a house where a lawyer was killed earlier in a violent fire. When renovations were undertaken in 1998 of the most violent poltergeist episodes occurred to have been documented in Spain: lamps moved, objects and statues moved and collided, doors slammed, there were strange noises, furniture was placed in the corridor to block passage, and out of circulation coins, buttons, broken glass and chunks of charred wood fell from the roof. Electromagnetic distortions cancelled the Earth's magnetic field, bringing it to zero. Perhaps the first documented case of poltergeists in Spain was in 1724, when the doctor and writer Diego de Torres Villarroel went called to the house of the Countess of Arcos, located on Fuencarral to witness a paranormal phenomenon. He himself wrote in his life: \\"I can assure that for fifteen nights I was sleepless and restless, I heard horrible noises ... so out of natural order, such as the pictures being taken down without falling from the nail or the ring, locked doors being opened, plates rolling without breaking ...\\" All the servants had locked themselves away from fear of suffering from the phenomena, which consisted of repeated blows and movements of objects. The poet watched the fall of several tables in a room. He could not find the source of these sounds, although it was clear that this was not a joke. The Conde Estruch is a Spanish-Catalan version of Count Dracula, but since the Castillo de Llers was destroyed in the Civil War, he has nowhere to appear. Sevilla is a city with a rich history that also has quite a few ghosts. The best documented is that of Sister Ursula, a nun of the Order of Charity who appears in the Hospital of the Five Wounds, a Renaissance building which now houses the Parliament of Andalusia. Wander through the corridors of the building and frequent sick room and the old sacristy. The Diputaci√≥n de Sevilla ghosts wander the corridors of the old barracks. No one dares to walk along the Green Street last Friday night of each month, where there is a narrow passage from the old Jewish quarter. There is also a gentleman in a cloak and ruff inhabiting the high street pharmacy Franks. On the palace of the Plaza de Santa Eulalia in Murcia a woman appears every night on the roof screaming terrible cries. In the eleventh century, the Saavedra family lived in the palace and the wife of one of the aristocrats was unfaithful. On the Castillo de la Concepci√≥n in Cartagena a woman appears at night who was sandwiched between the walls. Cries are in the drains of the municipal library Sewer in the evenings. The building was headquarters of the Inquisition in the eighteenth century. In the former tuberculosis sanatorium in Sierra Espu√±a, closed in 1962, the ghost of a woman appears and Poltergeist phenomena occur such as windows and doors closing suddenly. In the palace of the Servants of Jesus Street (Murcia), a nobleman beheaded a novice whom he loved. Since then, strange phenomena occur. In the Murcia coast several ghosts have been seen, such as a Russian princess who was killed by the owner of the Isla del Bar√≥n, or the ghost ship that according to the fishermen have seen in the early hours of the Virgin. The Cornudilla is a ghost town that belongs to the town of Requena, very close to the villages of Marcos and Ruices. During the fifties there was a lot of paranormal activity there, especially in The House of Noise, of which now only some walls are left standing. In the pub \\"El Granero\\" in the city of Granada a monk named Lorenzo appears. It is in part of the Palacio de Abrantes, which was built in the sixteenth century.  Venezuela  The Silb√≥n (Warbler) according to legend is the ghost of a young man who killed his father to eat his offal, and is therefore doomed to wander like a lost soul forever carrying a bag filled with his family's bones. The ghost was named for its distinctive whistle, an omen of death. A version of the legend in the eastern plains of Colombia says the Silb√≥n is a lost soul of a womanizer who died alone and abandoned and seeks company. Another version says he chases pregnant women, delivering a long, sharp whistle that creates an intense cold that enters through the ears and freezes people. When the whistle is sharp a woman will die, but if it is blurred, a man dies.

The districts of Southern and Western Odisha are regarded as the most backward region by the planning commission, which re-designated some of these districts as KBK (Kalahandi-Balangir-Koraput). During 1992-93, the three larger districts were re-organized into eight districts viz. Malkangiri, Koraput, Nabrangpur, Kalahandi, Rayagada, Nuapada, Balangir and Sonepur. These eight districts comprise 14 Subdivisions, 37 Tehsils, 80 CD Blocks, 1,437 Gram Panchayats and 12,293 villages. The eight districts which form the KBK region account for 19.72% of the population and occupy over 30.59% geographical area of the State. Around 90% of the people of this region still live in villages. Female literacy is only 24.72%. As per the 1997 census of BPL families, about 72% families are below poverty line among those who live in this region which was 82% during 1992 census. More specifically, 49 CD Blocks of KBK districts are regarded as \\"very backward\\" and 28 CD Blocks are considered as \\"backward\\". Persistent crop failure, lack of access to the basic service and entitlements, starvation, malnutrition and migration are the leading manifestations in the region. Other socio-economic indicators including population composition and density, net area irrigated, hospital beds, and connectivity of villages (due to criss-crossed terrains) to growth centres and service centres are also far from satisfactory. The KBK districts have been historically rich in forest resources. Though the people have been using these forests very intensively and eking out their livelihood from this source, forests of this region have not received adequate investments and managerial inputs over time. Intensive use of forests for sustenance coupled with lack of insufficient investments and managerial inputs are, thus, continuously leading to forest degradation. Although one third (16,131 km2.) of the geographical area of this region is recorded as forests, only 11.3% (5,473 km2) is actually dense forest (i.e., with crown density over 40%) as per satellite imagery data. It has been further ascertained that 9% (4,332 km2.) forest area is completely devoid of vegetal cover. Another 13.5% (6,327 km2) forests are open having crown density more than 10% but less than 40%. The old Koraput and Kalahandi districts and portions of Bolangir districts are mainly hilly. Severe droughts and floods also often visit this region and some areas in quick succession. Therefore, backwardness of this region is multi-faceted: (i) tribal backwardness, (ii) hill area backwardness, (iii) backwardness due to severe natural calamities and (iv)apathy of state and central government towards this region.

This one burned anthracite and coke. A multi-fuel stove is similar to a wood- burning stove in appearance and design. Multifuel refers to the capability of the stove to burn wood and also coal, wood pellets, or peat. Stoves that have a grate for the fire to burn on and a removable ash pan are generally considered multi-fuel stoves.\\"What is the difference between a wood burning stove and a multi fuel stove?\\" Pipinghotstoves.com.

Multi-fuel stoves have been common in the northern United Kingdom, Ireland, and continental Europe since the 19th century. They are made either for cooking, heating, or both.They may double as a boiler, heating a tank of water for household use. With a boiler, the stove can also be connected to a radiator system to increase space heating in the home. As people turn to alternative ways of heating such stoves have become increasingly popular.\\"Multi Fuel Stoves Help Houses Save On Heating.\\" Build.co.uk. Accessed August 2011. In Scotland and Ireland in particular, coal and peat have historically been common solid fuel for stoves. Peat cutters use a tool called a tarasgeir in Gaelic. Peat sources are now scarce in some locations, however. As peat stoves were replaced by oil and electric heat in many homes during the 20th century, many peat banks were designated environmentally-protected land. Other peat banks are often depleted. History Household wood- and peat-burning stoves have existed since ancient Rome and Greece. Peat continues to be burned as heating fuel in eastern Europe. During the 1970s, peat consumption was as much as 60 million tons per year in the Soviet Union. The industrialization of coal mining led to a sharp increase in the burning of coal in stoves for home heating and cooking. Coal burns with twice the heat content of wood or peat, creating greater heat. Coal's greatest drawback, aside from being non-renewable, is that it creates thick, toxic smoke. This creates dense smog in urban areas, for example, in London, England during the Victorian era. Multi-fuel camping stoves Multi- fuel stoves also exist for camping and trekking use. They are lightweight and burn liquid fuel such as white gas, kerosene, or even automobile petrol, depending upon the stove model. Refillable and pre-filled fuel canisters are sold for these stoves. Liquid fuel is mixed with air (vaporized) and channeled through an opening called the \\"jet\\" toward the burner. Some designs require \\"priming\\" before use, by pumping the stove several times to release air and fuel through the jet. Operating a portable multi-fuel stove can be technically challenging, and practising the set-up and use of the stove before travelling with it is advisable. There are several stove designs that operate differently, and manufacturer's instructions should be followed for safety and correct operation.

Principles  The Society of Recreation Professionals (SORP, www.recpro.org), formerly the National Association of Recreation Resource Planners, expanded its membership in 2012 to include all outdoor recreation professionals. SORP is a non-profit professional organization whose mission is to promote, advance, and serve outdoor recreation professionals in research, planning, management, and policy development. SORP believes that professional principles are imperative for two reasons: Professional principles help clarify institutional values and perspectives, and help to provide a common understanding and nomenclature for professionals and interested stakeholders. They serve as a guide and rule of thumb for making decisions and taking action, and they help stakeholders to better understand planning and the recreation planning profession. Professional principles help deter arbitrary and capricious decision making which is a violation of law. The Administrative Procedure Act (1946: 60 Stat. 237, 5 U.S.C.A.) set forth the legal standard that administrative decisions must be principled and reasoned; that is, arbitrary and capricious decisions are in violation of law. A set of professional principles can be submitted as demonstrable evidence in a court of law to refute allegations of being arbitrary and capricious. The following principles reflect important concepts and values subscribed to by SORP towards the recreation planning profession. They also serve as a platform from which other sets of principles tier from such as those for visitor management, interpretive planning, facility design, monitoring and visitor capacity. Full and deliberate consideration of these principles will contribute to a systematic, reasoned and legally-sufficient recreation planning process and recreation plans.  Definition  Recreation planning is a rational systematic decision-making process, and as such it is a fundamental tool that deters our human tendencies to make decisions based on predisposition, bias, inadequate analysis, group-think, insular perspective, resistance to change, and excessive self-confidence. It results in decisions that are more effective, efficient, fair, reasoned, and defensible.  General precepts  1\\\\. Recreation Resource Planners: Recreation resource planners are professionals and should have a university degree in recreation resource planning, urban or regional planning, landscape architecture, or a closely related field. Professional experience and professional certification (e.g., NRPA, AICP) may also fulfill this educational standard. 2\\\\. Sound Professional Judgment: The standard for decision making in recreation planning is sound professional judgment, defined as a reasonable decision that has given full and fair consideration to all of the appropriate information, that is based on principled and reasoned analysis and the best available science and expertise, and that complies with applicable laws. 3\\\\. A Contract with the Recreating Public: A recreation plan is a contract with the recreating public and affected stakeholders that transcends any one person or administration, and as such should be detailed, unambiguous, and provide for accountability. 4\\\\. Represent the Public Interest: Recreation resource planning is a collaborative public process that deters the bias of special interests, political intervention, or incremental unplanned decision making. 5\\\\. Recreation Resources: Recreation resources are those features in a setting that define a person‚Äôs experience, such as the natural and cultural resources, special values attached to an area, facilities, infrastructure, personnel, and management regulations and actions. 6\\\\. Recreation Opportunities: Recreation planners plan for recreation opportunities, defined as an occasion for a person to participate in a specific recreation activity in a particular outdoor setting in order to enjoy a desired recreation experience and gain the healthy benefits that accrue. 7\\\\. Recreation: The occasion of a person to participate in a specific recreation activity in a particular outdoor setting in order to enjoy a desired recreation experience and gain the healthy benefits that accrue. (Note---the historic term of ‚Äúrecreation‚Äù has largely been replaced by the phrase ‚Äúrecreation opportunity‚Äù as defined above). 8\\\\. Recreation Benefits: Recreation resource planning should promote the environmental, human and community wellness benefits that accrue from recreation participation such as improved physical and mental health, family cohesion, civility, social integration, child development, economic stimulation, work productivity, resource stewardship, and conservation ethic. 9\\\\. Recreation Diversity: Because there is no ‚Äúaverage‚Äù recreationist, it is important to plan for and maintain a spectrum of diverse recreation opportunities. 10\\\\. Systems Approach: Recreation resource planners must consider how their resources fit into a larger regional system, how their potential recreation alternatives might contribute to regional recreation diversity, and how their opportunities can be linked to larger systems. 11\\\\. Recreation Justice: Recreation resource planning helps to ensure that all people have an opportunity to enjoy our great outdoors without prejudice of race, ethnicity, age, wealth, gender, beliefs, or abilities. Planning should also ensure that Treaty rights and the rights of aboriginal publics are fairly considered. 12\\\\. Recreation Allocation: Recreation resource planning requires recreation allocation decisions because not all types and number of people or activities can be accommodated in a particular setting at one time. 13\\\\. Recreation Compatibility: Some recreation uses are not compatible with other uses, and recreation planners have the responsibility to determine what, if any, uses should be permitted, and where those activities should be permitted. Strong preferences for specific recreation settings lead to competition for recreation resources among different user types. Conflict is also generated by how each user group perceives the others‚Äô actions and values. 14\\\\. Recreation Niche: Because not all people can be accommodated in all places, recreation planning helps to focus on the special values and resources of a setting and to define the special niche within the larger spectrum of recreation opportunities. 15\\\\. Visitor Capacity: Visitor capacity is the prescribed number, or supply, of available visitor opportunities that will be accommodated in a specific location and specific time. 16\\\\. Resource Sustainability: Whereas natural and cultural resources define an outdoor recreation setting, it is fundamental that recreation resource planning and plans address how to integrate recreation use so as to harmonize with, protect, enhance, and sustain these important resources. 17\\\\. Reduction of Impact: Recreation planning should proactively consider ways to minimize and mitigate potential social and environmental impacts. 18\\\\. Recreation Stewardship: Recreation planning should consider how to best design, manage, and interpret settings so as to foster public appreciation, understanding, respect, behaviors, and partnerships that contribute to the stewardship of an area‚Äôs natural and cultural resources, and special values. 19\\\\. Resource Caretakers: Recreation planners also have a responsibility to consider how plans and decisions will affect the kind of resource legacy will be left to the next generation.  Principles for the planning process  20\\\\. A Process: While the specific terms and steps in a recreation planning process often vary across institutions, all recreation resource planning in some manner includes: Identification of public issues, management concerns, opportunities, and threats through collaborative stakeholder involvement. Establishment of planning and decision criteria for evaluating and selecting the preferred alternative. Inventory of resources, the current situation, and the best available science and information. Formulation of alternatives which address the significant issues and concerns. Evaluation of the consequences, benefits, and effects of each proposed alternative. Selection of a preferred alternative based upon a full and reasoned analysis. Implementation and monitoring. Plan adaptation or revision. 21\\\\. Legally Sufficient: Recreation resource planning is framed by various local, state, and federal laws and regulations, with the most significant and historic direction provided by the National Environmental Policy Act (1969) and its attendant Council on Environmental Quality regulations. 22\\\\. Judicial Doctrine: Good recreation planning is based upon the important judicial principles of being principled, reasoned, reasonable, sufficient, full, fair, and preponderance of the information. 23\\\\. Planning Considerations: An adequate recreation resource planning process and plan must address all of the significant public issues, management concerns, opportunities, and threats that are identified in the early stages of the planning process. Issues, concerns, opportunities and threats that are not deemed significant, do not need to be addressed in the plan. 24\\\\. Planning Inputs: Recreation resource planning requires the consideration of many inputs such as an inventory of existing plans and policies, current type and amount of recreation use (supply and demand), recreation trends, public issues, management concerns, regional supply of recreation opportunities, visitor and stakeholder preferences, economic impact of recreation participation, best available science, environmental conditions, and available information from recreation and resource monitoring. 25\\\\. Recreation Resource Publics: Recreation resource planning must try to engage and hear from all the diverse publics who value the recreation resource. The easily recognizable publics are often labeled visitors, local business, land owners and communities, but there may also be equally important publics who vicariously value the resource, some who have been displaced by past unacceptable conditions, some who do not have the ability to attend meetings, or some who live across the country but equally share in the ownership of the public resource. 26\\\\. Collaboration: The meaningful engagement and exchange with the public is essential throughout the planning process. Collaboration results in a clearer definition of public values, more creative alternatives, more reasoned and reasonable decisions, and a constituency that becomes better informed and committed to the plan and its implementation. 27\\\\. Science-Informed Planning: It is both a legal requirement and professional imperative to duly consider the best available science and expertise in the planning process and the plan‚Äôs implementation. 28\\\\. Comprehensive and Integrated: Recreation planning should consider other significant natural and cultural resources, uses, demands, and values in an integrated and comprehensive fashion. Functional planning, whereby one resource is planned for in a vacuum from other resources, is not appropriate and contrary to comprehensive and integrated planning. 29\\\\. Clear Management Alternatives: Recreation alternatives must be clear, comprehensive, and provide a reasonable range of choices for public consideration. Each alternative can be contrasted by its proposed objectives, desired future conditions, desired recreation experiences, facilities, management strategies and actions, quality standards, visitor capacities, economic value, projected budget requirements, and monitoring program. 30\\\\. Rigorous Analysis: The analytical stage in a planning process is the evaluation of alternatives whereby the alternatives should be sharply contrasted, and the pros and cons are rigorously evaluated so the reasons for and against each alternative become clear.  Principles for the plan  31\\\\. The Document: The effectiveness and utility of a plan is in part a function of its clarity, brevity, layout, and design. Materials used in the planning process should be retained in the administrative record, but the final approved document should be a valuable desktop working document. 32\\\\. Resource Management Prescription: The output of a recreation resource planning process is a management prescription for an area that includes such information as goals, objectives, desired future conditions, desired recreation experiences, facilities, management strategies and actions, quality standards, visitor capacities, a monitoring program, and budgetary needs. 33\\\\. Budgetary Tool: An effective recreation plan should include the projected budgetary needs to implement the plan. In this way the plan is a tool to prepare and justify annual budgets, for allocating budgets, and to guide annual work priorities, and facilitate the scheduling and sequencing of projects.  Principles for implementation  34\\\\. Implementing Partnerships: The successful implementation of a plan should involve collaboration with stakeholders, government agencies, partnerships, and alliances with communities, special interest groups, and the private sector. 35\\\\. Institutional Accountability: The responsible official charged with implementing the plan should periodically evaluate and report to the public on progress and accomplishments to date, factors affecting the plan‚Äôs implementation, and changes pending or made to the approved plan. 36\\\\. Plan Adaptability: A recreation resource plan should be adaptive to new science, information, uses, technology, trends, conditions, and other circumstances of importance. Any proposed change should be subject to the same level of deliberate analysis and public collaboration as went into the original decision. 37\\\\. Review and Revision: Given the significant and ongoing changes in our society and the recreation industry, it would be reasonable that recreation plans be formally reviewed and updated every 5‚Äì10 years. These principles were developed by the Board of Directors of the National Association of Recreation Resource Planners, with input solicited from more than 1000 recreation planning professionals, and approved by the Board for distribution in April 2009.

Clark for Bang! Pow! Boom!, the duo's 2009 album. A music video was produced for the 2010 reissue of the album, dubbed the \\"Nuclear Edition\\". The song's lyrics focus on things experienced in everyday life and displaying an appreciation for them. It has become perhaps the duo's best-known song. The song's music video has gone viral and sparked a handful of memes, and was parodied on Saturday Night Live and by Lonely Island in the song \\"Incredible Thoughts\\".http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2016/06/the_lonely_island_s_popstar_reviewed.html Music and lyrics Inspiration for the song's lyrics came via the Internet generation and group members Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope raising children. In response to both modern jadedness and their children experiencing wonders of the world for the first time, the group wanted to write a song about natural phenomena humans experience in life which often go unacknowledged. The closing lyrics encourage listeners to take time to look at the world and \\"appreciate the things that life has to offer\\". According to Violent J, \\"What's a shame is how people walk around blind to it all. They lost their spirit about everything. If you can‚Äôt even see the miracle in animals, then you must have never truly loved a pet.\\" He believes that scientific explanations can sometimes kill the intriguing mysteries of the world, such as how ancient pyramids were made. Violent J admits that the song's lyrics discuss \\"things [... that] may not be actual miracles. They may have scientific facts explaining them [...] But nonetheless, these things are still incredible [...] and they should be appreciated.\\" He added that the group's use of the word 'miracle' was intended to mean \\"something fuckin‚Äô amazing and incredible, [... a] special, awesome event, [...] a great, wonderful thing.\\" The lyrics focus on introspective themes which critics considered to be uncommon in Insane Clown Posse's music; however, Violent J states that these themes are important in the duo's work, and reveal their depth. In response to accusations that the group has changed its style and gone soft, Violent J calls the song \\"classic ICP,\\" noting that the group has always included one or two deep and meaningful songs on every album, and that this is just the first time that they've created a video for one of those songs. Several reviewers have suggested that the song contains an anti-science message. Violent J disputes the claim, asserting that \\"the [song's] concept is about appreciating everything in this world. It's not about God; [...] religion; [.. or] science.\\" Joseph Laycock of Religion Dispatches suggests that rather than rejecting science, the song disapproves of disenchantment. The song's music is built around an ascending synthesizer melody, and climaxes with an electric guitar solo performed by Mike E. Clark, and beatboxing by Shaggy 2 Dope. Music video viral. The music video for the song debuted on April 6, 2010, as part of the \\"Nuclear Edition\\" reissue of Bang! Pow! Boom!. The video's green screen sequences were directed by Paul Andresen, with post-production being completed in Michigan. The video has received over seventeen million views on YouTube. It also appeared in the webcomic Homestuck.http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p;=004718 On April 17, Saturday Night Live aired a sketch which parodied the \\"Miracles\\" music video. In the sketch, fictional personalities DJ Supersoak (played by Jason Sudeikis) and Lil' Blaster (played by Nasim Pedrad) debuted a fictional music video by the Thrilla Killa Klownz called \\"Magical Mysteries\\" as part of the Under Underground Records' \\"Underground Rock Minute\\". In the fictional video, Ryan Phillippe and Bobby Moynihan rap about things such as \\"where the sun hides at night\\" and how blankets work. Saturday Night Live had previously parodied Psychopathic Records in 2009. Insane Clown Posse called the \\"Miracles\\" parody \\"a huge honor\\". Violent J called the parody \\"off the hook hilarious\\". Shaggy noted that Coolio had reacted unfavorably towards \\"Amish Paradise\\", \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic's parody of the rapper's song \\"Gangsta's Paradise\\", and stated \\"If Weird Al wanted to do one of our songs, I‚Äôd be like, 'Hell yeah.' To me, it's the same thing with Saturday Night Live.\\" Reception The Detroit News music critic Adam Graham disliked the song, writing that \\"hearing this song makes you wish ICP would stick to serial killing\\". Slate writer Jonah Weiner praised the song's music, but panned its lyrics. The A.V. Club writer Nathan Rabin described the song as \\"fucking insane\\".

The majority of the area is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Local Nature Reserve. One of the very few lowland heaths in Cheshire, Sound Heath is a valuable habitat for heathland plants and animals, although its heathland character is currently under threat from the spread of trees and scrub. The common's ponds form one of the most important sites in the county for freshwater invertebrates. Three nationally rare or endangered species have been found within the area: the mud snail (which is now one of the UK's most endangered freshwater creatures, having been recently recategorised as near threatened across Europe in the new IUCN European Red List of Non-marine Molluscs), great raft spider and the Enochrus isotae species of water scavenger beetle, as well as the nationally scarce beautiful snout moth. The first sightings of the migrant hawker dragonfly in Cheshire were at Sound Heath, and many other locally rare species have been recorded here. The site is also an important breeding site for birds. Geography and geology Sound Heath lies on the Cheshire Plain, 3 miles southwest of Nantwich, at an average elevation of around 65 metres.Ordnance Survey: Explorer series no. 257: Crewe & Nantwich, Whitchurch & Tattenhall The underlying geology is Keuper marl (Mercia Mudstone Group), a red sandstone laid down during the Triassic period. Glacial sand deposition has generated a light, sandy soil which is nutrient poor. Localised sand extraction has resulted in numerous pools. The Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) of Sound Heath was designated in 1963 and occupies 4.80 Ha. The Local Nature Reserve (LNR), which is named Sound Common, was designated in 1992;Natural England: Local Nature Reserves: Sound Heath (accessed 12 April 2010) it is slightly smaller at 4.61 Ha. Both SSSI and LNR include two distinct sites: the larger site (3.84 Ha in the SSSI) lies between Wrenbury Heath Road‚ÄìSound Lane and the Red Lion Farm track, and is centred at around . A second smaller area (0.96 Ha) lies northeast of the main site, to the north of Wrenbury Heath Road, and is centred at around .Natural England: Sound Heath: Condition of SSSI units (accessed 9 April 2010)Natural England: Map of Sound Heath SSSI (accessed 25 July 2013)Natural England: Map of Sound Heath LNR (accessed 25 July 2013) The common land includes both SSSI/LNR sites and also extends over a larger region, including three additional areas contiguous with the larger SSSI/LNR site: north of Sound Lane, and in the triangles formed by Sound Lane, Wrenbury Heath Road and Heath View, and Wrenbury Heath Road, the Red Lion Farm track and an unnamed north‚Äìsouth track. It is open access land under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.Natural England: CRoW Access Land Maps: Sound Heath (downloaded from ; 10 April 2010) Habitats Sound Heath contains several diverse habitats: damp and dry heathland, grassland, scrub and young woodland.Natural England: Sound Heath (accessed 9 April 2010)Natural England: Local Nature Reserves: Sound Heath (accessed 9 April 2010) Numerous permanent or seasonal pools are scattered throughout the area.Latham FA, ed. Acton, pp. 127‚Äì8 (The Local History Group; 1995) () Heath and grassland Grassy heathland and scrub Lowland heath (heathland below 300 metres elevation) is an internationally scarce habitat which is rare within Cheshire. A survey in 1995 found only 60 Ha in the administrative county, of which as little as 11 Ha were wet heath.Cheshire Region Biodiversity Partnership: Habitat Action Plans: Heathland (accessed 10 April 2010) Sound Heath is one of only four lowland heath SSSIs in the county. In the areas of damp heath, the predominant species when the site was designated an SSSI in 1963 were common heather (Calluna vulgaris), cross- leaved heath (Erica tetralix), common gorse (Ulex europaeus), western gorse (U. gallii) and purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea). These areas also of bog moss (Sphagnum). A total of 50 species of bryophytes have been recorded at the site, including the large white-moss (Leucobryum glaucum), which is rare in Cheshire. Other locally rare species that have been observed here include bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), common lousewort (Pedicularis sylvatica) and round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia). The drier areas of heath have a grassy character, with typical species being matgrass (Nardus stricta) and wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa). Common tormentil (Potentilla erecta), dovesfoot cranesbill (Geranium molle), heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile), heath milkwort (Polygala serpyllifolia) and heath rush (Juncus squarrosus) have also been recorded, as has the locally rare bird's-foot (Ornithopus perpusillus) and shepherd's cress (Teesdalia nudicaulis). During the late 20th century, the area of heathland has been substantially reduced by the encroachment of scrub, birch, alder and willow. The incursion of trees has caused the heath to become drier, resulting in the loss of some wet heath plants, including bog asphodel and round-leaved sundew.\\"Sound Common: The Pond\\", Cheshire Countryside Management Service & Borough of Crewe & Nantwich One of many small woodland ponds Wetland The wetland habitat at Sound Heath is very diverse, ranging from small ponds and damp hollows to Sound Pond (), which is nearly 60 metres in length.Cheshire East Council & Cheshire West and Chester Council: Interactive Mapping: Sound Pond (accessed 10 April 2010) Water bodies are found both in the sunny open heath areas and within the woodland. As the pools result from the extraction of sand, they have a different ecology from the more common marl-pits, as well as from the glacial kettle holes and salt- subsidence flashes of the Cheshire Plain. Most have reached the late succession (mature) stage. Although the encroachment of trees on the common has led to some ponds becoming infilled with leaf debris, reducing the number of permanent pools, the resultant seasonal wet areas support several rare plant species. The pools provide a habitat for a wide range of emergent plants, of which the rarest is bog St John's-wort (Hypericum elodes), previously believed to have died out in Cheshire. The locally rare floating club rush (Eleogiton fluitans) has been recorded at the site. Other wetland species observed here include bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), greater spearwort (Ranunculus lingua), lesser celandine (Ranunculus ficaria), marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris), marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle vulgaris), marsh thistle (Cirsium palustre), marsh violet (Viola palustris), reedmace (Typha), water violet (Hottonia palustris) and wavy bittercress (Cardamine flexuosa).Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland: Cheshire VC58: County Rare Plant Register 2008 (accessed 04 February 2014) Scrub and woodland The woodland predominantly dates from the past 40 years, although there are some mature oaks and other trees. The main species are common alder (Alnus glutinosa), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), silver birch (Betula pendula) and willow (Salix), with common bramble (Rubus fruticosus) predominant in the undergrowth. Fauna=Invertebrates Migrant hawker dragonfly The mature pools of Sound Heath form one of the most important sites in Cheshire for freshwater invertebrates.English Nature: Natural Areas 27: Meres and Mosses (27 February 1998) (accessed 10 April 2010) The mud snail (Omphiscola glabra), Enochrus isotae species of water scavenger beetle and the great raft spider (Dolomedes plantarius), which are rare or endangered in the UK,UK Biodiversity Action Plan: Species Action Plan: Fen Raft Spider (Dolomedes plantarius) (accessed 12 April 2010) are among the many species that have been recorded in the site's ponds. Locally rare pond dwellers include the caseless caddisfly (Holocentropus stagnalis) and the diving beetle (Hygrotus decoratus). Dragonflies and damselflies are common, with 15 species recorded, two-thirds of which are known to breed here. Species include the broad-bodied chaser (Libellula depressa), common hawker (Aeshna juncea), emperor (Anax imperator) and ruddy darter (Sympetrum sanguineum), as well as the first Cheshire sighting of the migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta). The beautiful snout moth (Hypena crassalis), a scarce moth species in the UK, has been recorded at the site. The open heath and grassland no longer forms a breeding site for the small heath butterfly (Coenonympha pamphilus), whose numbers are declining in the UK.Butterfly Conservation: Small Heath (accessed 10 April 2010) Sixty species of spider have been recorded at the site. Sparrowhawk Birds Sound Heath forms an important breeding site for a wide range of birds. Locally rare species include the Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and the willow tit (Parus montanus). Among the other species that have been observed here are the moorhen, reed bunting, turtle dove and willow warbler, the tawny, little and barn owls, and the greater spotted, lesser spotted and green woodpeckers. Other animals The heathland is a significant local habitat for the common lizard (Zootoca vivipara) grass snakes (Natrix natrix), and slowworms (Anguis fragilis) dominate the mats in the grassland in spring- time. The common newt (Lissotriton vulgaris), common toad (Bufo bufo) and common frog (Rana temporaria) all inhabit the ponds, and the high insect numbers associated with the water attract bats, such as the common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) and common long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus). Management and current status Sound Pond is threatened by growth of New Zealand pondweed, as well as illegal fishing and camping Sound Heath is managed by the Cheshire Countryside Management Service and volunteers from the Sound and District Residents Association (SADRA), which was founded in November 2000 to carry out conservation work at the common.Sound and District Residents Association formation (accessed 10 April 2010) The landowner is Cheshire East unitary authority (formerly Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council). Management includes scrub and bramble clearance, removal of saplings, gorse thinning, removal of New Zealand pondweed from Sound Pond, maintenance of footpaths and footbridges, and removal of rubbish. Heather seeds from the Little Budworth Common SSSI were planted in 2003.Sound & District Residents Association: Minutes of Annual Committee Meeting: 17 December 2001, 30 January 2003, 8 January 2004, 13 January 2005, 19 January 2006 & 16 January 2007 Although in 2002/3 English Nature recommended removing mature trees from the edges of open areas to encourage heath regeneration, SADRA considers Sound Heath to be \\"not just a Heathland, but a 'Mosaic' site where no one part should be extended at the expense of another without good grounds for doing so.\\"Sound & District Residents Association: Minutes of Annual Committee Meeting: 30 January 2003 The association's approach to tree removal has therefore been cautious, with progressive tree felling being undertaken only where beneficial effects to the site have been observed.Sound & District Residents Association: Minutes of Annual Committee Meeting: 8 January 2004 The site was assessed by Natural England as in an unfavourable but stable condition in 2008, due to a reduction in heath-associated plants caused by the growth of trees and scrub. Other threats to the area include fly-tipping, algal bloom in the ponds, and fishing, camping and lighting fires around Sound Pond. Facilities for visitors include a car park on Sound Lane () and an interpretive sign about the common's ponds ().

'We Want Ourselves a Country') is a famous phrase in the context of Norwegian nationalism, derived from a poem by Per Sivle. It has been evoked by many different groups, including during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, when an arrest order was issued on the deceased Sivle. Original use It is taken from a poem by Per Sivle (1857‚Äì1904) issued in 1895, ten years before Norway gained its independence. Sivle's poem, titled \\"Vi vil os et Land -\\", was published in the poetry collection Bers√∏glis- og andre Viser from 1895. It was originally written as the last verse of the occasional poem \\"Her spirer i Norge\\", written for a procession in support of universal male suffrage organized by Kristiania Liberal Party in 1894. Later use The phrase has been evoked by several very different groups who have appealed to Norwegian nationalism. It was praised as a \\"delightful poem of liberty\\" in the Communist Party of Norway newspaper Norges Kommunistblad in 1925, and the far-right Fatherland Party opened the 1997 election manifesto with a part of the poem. The poem lent its name to a 1936 film, which agitated for the Conservative Party ahead of the 1936 election. The opening words of the poem are reportedly written on the tombstone of Liberal Party politician Johannes Steen, and are also engraved in a portal on an avenue leading to the Eidsvoll Building, where the nationalist-symbolic Constitution of Norway was drafted and signed. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, Vi vil oss et land was the name of one of the first anti-Nazi illegal newspapers, written among others by Olav Gj√¶revoll, Gunnar S√∏nsteby and Max Manus. A rendition of the poem was staged in 1940 by theatre director Henry Gleditsch, who ended up being killed by the Nazis. In 1942 the poem was printed in an illegal newspaper based in Bergen. It was signed with Per Sivle's name, resulting in the Gestapo issuing an arrest order for the long-dead Sivle.

The lower masts were made of iron, and the other masts were wood.Ballard, p. 91 She was a poor sailer and her best speed under sail alone was about . Ballard attributed the class's poor performance under sail to the drag of the propeller, which could neither be hoisted out of the water, nor feathered. He also attributed their sluggish steering under sail to interference with the flow of water to the rudder by the stationary propeller.Ballard, pp. 90‚Äì91 The ship was re-rigged as a barque after her first commission.

Ganwar Region, Somalia: Present Day Demetri, Simon, Janis and Vogel are traveling to Somalia via helicopter dressed as Red Panda representatives to investigate the remaining tower standing because they thought it was a design made by Simon when he was thirteen years old, and was then stolen by whoever created the tower. As they're about to enter the village, they are shot at by a couple of Somali men, one of them being the adult version of the small Somali boy in 1991, whose name is revealed to Abdi. They are taken captive by Abdi's men and their cover is ruined when Abdi recognizes Simon as the scientist who claims to have caused the global blackout. Abdi knows that they're really there to search the tower, claiming they're just like \\"the others\\". Abdi explains that back in 1991, Americans came to Somalia, claiming to be creating the towers to provide them with electricity. One day, when he went out to herd the goats, he came back to find his people dead. Later, Demetri and Vogel stage a breakout by causing a brawl to get the guards to join in and knock them out. They see two people near the helicopter, and shoot them. But one of the guys had an RPG on him, and it accidentally goes off, blowing up one of the buildings and alerting Abdi. They are caught once again, and Abdi tells them that they are being held captive for a reason. He claims in his flashforward, he was speaking in front of thousands of what he believed was about starting a war against America, and his army would be called The Better Angels. After a while of listening to what Abdi is saying, Janis realizes what Abdi's flashforward really meant, and offers to show him what it really means and they'll tell him who they really are. Janis shows him, through the mosaic website, that he was reading an excerpt from Lincoln's first inaugural address: \\"The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\\" Abdi now realizes that he's not supposed to start a war, he's supposed to stop it from happening. Demetri explains that they're there because they believe that the tower is the cause of a small blackout that occurred in 1991 and is somehow related to the global blackout. Abdi takes them inside the tower, where they find a video that reveals that his people were questioned for what they saw, and they see that D. Gibbons was the one behind the operation. Vogel finds a secret door in the tower, and they find the skeletons of the villagers, who, according to Vogel's autopsy, were shot to death. Abdi finds his mother's body via identifying her necklace, and he blames Simon for what happened since the tower was based on his designs. Right before he pulls the trigger, Vogel shoots Abdi from behind, fatally wounding him and saving Simon's life, but also preventing his flashforward from happening. That night, Abdi's people thank them for killing Abdi since he was a hard man to work for, and to show their gratitude to them, give them some food and a place to stay for the night. Vogel and Simon share their flashforwards with each other, and Vogel's flashforward reveals him walking up to a man in a suit, and saying: \\"Mark Benford is dead\\". Meanwhile, Demetri is rewatching the video, and after a few minutes of watching the static, D. Gibbons reappears and says \\"Hello Demetri. My name is Dyson Frost, and I'm recording this message in 1991. Got your attention, didn't I?\\" Mark and Family Mark shares some information with Wedeck about the hydra painting he saw in his vision and shows how it's connected with Dyson Frost. Mark also tells him the information he got about Dyson Frost. Mark heads home to have lunch with Olivia, where they discuss where they can move to get away from everything bad that could happen. Mark tells Olivia that they still need to know what Charlie saw in her vision, because she told Mark \\"D. Gibbons is a bad man\\". That night, Olivia finally convinces Charlie to tell her what she saw in her vision. Charlie tells her that she gave Dylan a cookie and they overhear his dad saying D. Gibbons is a liar. Dylan writes out \\"D. Gibbons is a bad man\\" on the refrigerator, saying that bad people lie. Charlie hears some fireworks go off, she goes to the back door, and sees Vogel telling another man \\"Mark Benford is dead\\". Olivia reveals what she heard to Mark, and when Olivia decides to leave the house that night, Mark tells her he can't because there's gonna be another blackout and he needs to see it through, meaning he needs the flashforwards to come true to see what he saw come true. Bryce and Nicole Bryce is vomiting in the bathroom due to his cancer, and he gets paged back to the hospital. He bumps into Nicole and finds out she's taking pre-med. Bryce says that she's part-way there since she has a good name (Dr. Kirby), and he jokes with her by saying his real name is Dr. Martin Goathead. Later that day, Bryce gives her a calculator that should help her in physics and all the other classes she has. Calculating it all to twelve years, Nicole says that in twelve years they'll be able to work together. But Bryce reveals to Nicole about his cancer.

Named and , they were the first American dreadnoughts‚Äîpowerful warships whose capabilities far outstripped those of the world's older battleships. In the opening years of the twentieth century, the prevailing theory of naval combat was that battles would continue to be fought at relatively close range using many small, fast-firing guns. As such, each of the ships in the United States' previous battleship class (the ) had many medium-sized weapons alongside four large guns. This paradigm, however, was soon to be subverted, as American naval theorists proposed that a ship mounting a homogeneous battery of large guns would be more effective in battle. As these ideas began to enjoy wider acceptance, the US Congress authorized the country's Navy to construct two small battleships. This displacement was roughly the same size as the Connecticut class and at least smaller than the foreign standard. A solution was found in an ambitious design drawn up by Rear Admiral Washington L. Capps, the chief of the navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair; it traded heavy armament and relatively thick armor‚Äîboth favored by naval theorists‚Äîfor speed. With their superfiring main armament, press accounts billed South Carolina and Michigan, alongside the British , as heralding a new epoch in warship design. Both, however, were soon surpassed by ever-larger and stronger super-dreadnoughts. The class's low top speed of about , as compared to the standard of later American battleships, relegated them to serving with older, obsolete battleships during the First World War. After the end of the conflict and the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty, both South Carolinas were scrapped.  Background  In 1901, the US Navy's battleship designs reflected the prevailing theory of naval combat: battles would initially be fought at long distances, but the ships would close the range for final blows. In this stage, shorter-range, faster- firing guns would prove most useful. Following this philosophy, the premier battleship class then under construction‚Äîthe ‚Äîcarried four large , eight , and twelve guns, a striking power slightly heavier than typical foreign battleships of the time.Campbell, \\"United States of America: 'The New Navy', 1883‚Äì1905,\\" 137‚Äì38, 143; Friedman, US Battleships, 52. The Naval Institute's Proceedings magazine devoted space in two of its 1902 issues to possible improvements in battleship design. The first article was authored by Lieutenant Matt H. Signor, who argued for a ship with and /40 caliber guns in four triple turrets. The secondary battery would be composed of /60 guns. This paper provoked enough thought that Proceedings published comments on the story from Captain William M. Folger, Professor P. R. Alger, and naval constructor David W. Taylor‚Äîthe latter an up-and-coming officer and future head of the Bureau of Construction and Repair (C&R;). These comments expressed doubt that the proposed vessel could be modified into a feasible design, but they praised his thoughts as a step in the right direction. Alger believed that Signor was on the right track in suggesting larger armament, though he thought that triple turrets would be unworkable and eight 12-inch guns in four twin turrets would be a much more realistic arrangement. Naval historian Norman Friedman believes that this was one of the \\"earliest serious proposals for a homogeneous big-gun battery.\\"Friedman, US Battleships, 51; Signor, \\"A New Type of Battleship\\"; Folger, Alger, Taylor, \\"Discussion\\". pre-dreadnought battleships, such as the preceding Connecticut class ( pictured). The suggestion leading directly to the South Carolina class came from Homer Poundstone, a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy, who became the principal proponent of an American all-big-gun design. In a December 1902 paper written for President Theodore Roosevelt, he argued for greatly increasing the size of current battleships, although he also supported retaining mixed main batteries.Friedman, US Battleships, 52. However, by the March and June 1903 editions of Proceedings, Poundstone began advocating for an all-big-gun arrangement, featuring twelve guns mounted on a ship. In October of the same year, the Italian naval architect Vittorio Cuniberti presented a similar idea in an article for Jane's Fighting Ships entitled \\"An Ideal Battleship for the British Navy\\". He argued in favor of a ship with twelve 12-inch guns on a slightly larger displacement than the battleships in service at the time, . He believed that the higher weight would allow 12 inches of armor and machinery capable of propelling the ship at . Poundstone used what he believed to be the great popularity for this idea among Europeans to justify the all-big-gun design.Friedman, US Battleships, 52; Cuniberti, \\"An Ideal Battleship\\"; Friedman, \\"South Carolina Sisters,\\" Poundstone, \\"Size of Battleships for US Navy,\\" 161‚Äì74; Poundstone, \\"Proposed Armament,\\" 377‚Äì411. In 1903, Poundstone's designs began receiving attention from American naval authorities. After being refined by Washington Irving Chambers, Poundstone's work was brought to the Naval War College, where it was tested in war games during the 1903 Newport Conference. The results indicated that a theoretical battleship that dispensed with the intermediate 8- and 7-inch armament and was armed with only twelve 11- or 12-inch guns, all able to fire on a single broadside, was worth three of the battleships then in service. According to the men who conducted the tests, the main reasoning for the finding was that the measure of effective gun ranges was directly related to the maximum length of an enemy's torpedo range. At this time, the latter was roughly ; at that distance, the 7- and 8-inch guns common to American intermediate batteries would not be able to penetrate the armor of enemy battleships. Worse still, it was certain that‚Äîas the United States was developing a torpedo‚Äîgun range would have to rise in the near future, making the intermediate guns even less useful. However, a homogeneous main battery of 11- or 12-inch guns would be able to penetrate the armor and have sufficient explosive power to disable an enemy capital ship, and adding as many guns as possible would provide a strong defense against torpedo-carrying but unarmored destroyers.Friedman, US Battleships, 53; Friedman, \\"South Carolina Sisters\\". As it turned out, events in the Russo- Japanese War soon showed that naval battles could be fought at significantly greater distances than had been thought possible.Friedman, Battleship Design, 98.  Design  Line drawing of a South Carolina-class battleship. Faced with this evidence, the General Board sent a formal request in October 1903 to C&R;, asking it to draw up plans for a battleship including these characteristics. No progress had been made by 26 January 1904, when the General Board asked C&R; for a design including four 12-inch guns, eight 10-inch or larger guns, and no intermediate armament beyond 3-inch anti- destroyer guns. The move to only 10-inch weaponry was the result of doubt among naval authorities that heavier guns could physically be mounted on a ship's broadside. No action was taken on this request until September, when C&R; began planning a ship with four 12-inch guns in dual turrets along with eight dual 10-inch or four single 12-inch guns. Meanwhile, the Naval War College played three battleship designs against each other at its 1904 Newport Conference: the ships that were built following the 1903 conference; the new C&R; design from September; and the latest battleships under construction, the Connecticut class. The 7- and 8-inch guns, and even the 10-inch guns, were demonstrated again to be unsatisfactory; even when hitting a battleship at the ideal angle of ¬∞ to its belt, they failed to pierce beyond 12 inches of Krupp armor‚Äînot enough to counter enemy capital ships. Speed calculations were also performed which demonstrated that even a advantage over an enemy fleet would be inconsequential in the final outcome of almost all naval battles because the slower ships could stay within range by turning on a tighter radius.Friedman, US Battleships, 53‚Äì54. Within the naval bureaus, however, there was still much resistance. In mid-to-late 1904, Poundstone continued to lobby the General Board while C&R; protested that the final determinant in a naval battle would be the light guns‚Äîand in any case such a large uniform battery was not feasible. Poundstone replied with a design of his own creation, which he called USS Possible and fit twelve 11-inch guns on a ship that displaced 19,330 long tons. With support from Lieutenant Commander William Sims, who was able to cite the increasingly accurate long-gunnery of the Navy, and interest shown in the project by President Roosevelt, the bureaucratic stalling ended.Friedman, US Battleships, 54‚Äì55. On 3 March 1905, Congress passed a bill that authorized the Navy to construct two new battleships to be named after the states of South Carolina and Michigan. The maximum tonnage limit was set at 16000 long tons, the same weight as the mixed-battery Connecticut class of two years prior, in an attempt to stem the rising displacement‚Äîand accompanying costs‚Äîof the Navy's new capital ships.Friedman, US Battleships, 55; Friedman, \\"South Carolina Sisters\\". The provision was met with a mixed reception from naval designers. Some, including retired Admiral of the Navy George Dewey, thought the limit should have been set at the minimum standard of foreign battleships, or around . Others believed adding a significant amount of speed or firepower‚Äîsomething one would expect with an increase in tonnage‚Äîwould require much more than 18,000 tons, and argued that the increase in size would buy nothing more than an increased target profile.\\"Dispute over Battleships,\\" New York Times, 16 October 1905, 6. The Constructor of the Navy, Rear Admiral Washington L. Capps, devised an ambitious design that packed powerful armament and thick armor onto the small hull. He believed that future naval battles would involve fleets rather than single-ship actions, and so while the wing turrets so common in European designs were useful in the latter role for putting a maximum amount of firepower in any given direction, they were less so when operating as part of a line of battle. From this, Capps theorized that the principal concern of battleships was how much shell weight they could fire per broadside. The arrangement of superfiring turrets placed on the centerline would allow the hull to be as short as possible while still having the most powerful broadside possible. A ship with its main battery placed along the center of the ship can focus the same amount of fire to port or starboard during a broadside. In contrast, wing turrets had significant shortcomings: their location on the left or right of a ship's superstructure led to smaller possible broadsides, and the extreme weight placed on the sides of the ships led to torsional stress and rolling inertia.Friedman, Battleship Design, 134. As the additional main battery turrets with their associated magazines used a great amount of space within each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways to stay within the tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: there was no room for engines that could provide the same amount of power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at this point that he considered turbine propulsion. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.Breyer, Battleships, 196; Friedman, US Battleships, 57. The designers were running into the problem that Friedman calls the \\"squeeze\\": the essential elements of a battleship (armament, propulsion machinery, and armor) typically added up to about sixty percent of their design displacement; favoring one of these factors, the \\"three primary military qualities\\", would mean accepting compromises in one or both of the others.Friedman, Battleship Design, 22. In the end, the choice of armament and armor meant that the South Carolinas top speed was lower than HMS Dreadnought, the namesake British ship built shortly before the South Carolinas, and all future US battleships.Friedman, US Battleships, 57.  Specifications  /45 caliber Mark 5 gun on . The same guns were utilized on the South Carolinas. At a design displacement of 16,000 long tons, the South Carolina-class dreadnoughts were the same size as their Connecticut-class pre- dreadnought predecessors. In service, they could actually be lighter: had a standard displacement of , while Michigan was only by the same measurement. The ship's hull size was also comparable to the Connecticuts, with a length of overall, between perpendiculars, and the same at the waterline. The class' beam was , draft was , and metacentric height was normally, coming in slightly lower at when at full load.Friedman, US Battleships, 430‚Äì32; \\"South Carolina\\" and \\"Michigan,\\" Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships. They were designed to carry about 869 men.Campbell, \\"United States of America: 'The New Navy', 1883‚Äì1905,\\" 112. The South Carolinas had a propulsion system consisting of two vertical triple-expansion steam engines driving two 3-bladed screws. These were in turn powered by twelve coal-fired superheating Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers located in three watertight compartments. Together, they weighed , which was just over the specified contract limit. Traditional triple-expansion engines were installed rather than the steam turbines used in the British Dreadnought. The actual coal capacity of the ships was at full load, slightly more than the designed maximum of , allowing for an endurance of at . While both ships surpassed in idealized trial conditions, the navy expected that the normal top speed would be around .Friedman, US Battleships, 431‚Äì32; Breyer, Battleships, 196; Leavitt, \\"USS Michigan,\\" 941‚Äì43. The class' main battery consisted of eight /45 caliber Mark 5 guns in four turrets, one pair fore and one aft, with 100 rounds for each gun. The guns were placed in an innovative superfiring arrangement, where one turret was mounted slightly behind and above the other. The anti-torpedo-boat secondary armament of twenty-two guns was mounted in casemates, and the two torpedo tubes were placed beneath the waterline, one on each side of the ship.Friedman, US Battleships, 431, Friedman, Battleship Design, 133‚Äì34. Armor on the South Carolina class was described by naval author Siegfried Breyer as \\"remarkably progressive\\", despite deficiencies in horizontal and underwater protection. The belt was thicker over the magazines, , than over the propulsion, , and in front of the forward magazines, . The casemates were also protected with 10 to 8 inches of armor, while the deck armor varied from . The turrets and conning tower had the heaviest armor, with 12‚Äì8‚Äì2.5 inches (face/side/roof; 305‚Äì203‚Äì63.5 mm) and , respectively. The barbettes were protected with 10 to 8 inches of armor. The total weight of the armor amounted to 31.4% of the design displacement, slightly more than the next three battleship classes.Friedman, US Battleships, 431; Friedman, Battleship Design, 166‚Äì67.

Michigan dressed with flags for a naval review off New York, 3 October 1911. Michigans keel was laid down on 17 December 1906, one day before South Carolina. After the initial construction periods, the ships were launched on 26 May and 11 July 1908 (respectively). Michigan was slightly more than half complete when launched, and the ship was christened by Carol Newberry, the daughter of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Truman Handy Newberry. The warship was billed as epoch-making, and the spectacle drew many prominent individuals, including the governor and lieutenant-governor of Michigan, the governor of New Jersey, the mayor of Detroit, and the secretary of the Interior Department, along with many naval admirals and constructors.\\"The Michigan,\\" Navy, 26; \\"Launching the Navy's 'All-Big-Gun' Battleship,\\" Harper's Weekly, 30. Like its sister ship, South Carolina was just over halfway completed when it was launched. The accompanying ceremony took place just after noon and was attended by many notable residents of the state of South Carolina, including Governor Martin Frederick Ansel. His daughter Frederica christened the ship.\\"The South Carolina Launched,\\" Navy, 35‚Äì36; \\"The Battleship South Carolina,\\" International Marine Engineering, 401; \\"Progress of Naval Vessels,\\" International Marine Engineering, 364; \\"New All Big Gun Warship Launched,\\" New York Times, 12 July 1908, 4; \\"Our New Battleship,\\" New York Tribune, 12 July 1908, 3. After their fitting-out stage, the two ships were put through sea trials to ensure they met their contracted specifications.Leavitt, \\"USS Michigan,\\" 915; Dinger, \\"USS South Carolina,\\" 200, 228. The first attempt at putting Michigan through a trial was conducted at the navy's traditional testing grounds off Rockland, Maine, beginning on 9 June 1909. Although the ship completed its standardization run, other tests were disrupted when it ran aground on a sand bar. Although Michigan was pulled off without incident, the navy soon discovered that both propellers required repair, delaying the completion of the trials until 20‚Äì24 June.Leavitt, \\"USS Michigan,\\" 915‚Äì17. The battleship was commissioned several months later on 4 January 1910‚Äîmaking the United States the third country to have a dreadnought in commission, behind the United Kingdom and Germany, but just ahead of Brazil's ‚Äîand its shakedown cruise lasted until 7 June.\\"Michigan,\\" Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.

Service history  Michigan steaming at speed, c. 1918. After being commissioned, both ships were assigned to the US Atlantic Fleet. The two operated up and down the American east coast from July until November. On 2 November, as part of the Second Battleship Division, the ships left the Boston Navy Yard for a training voyage to Europe, where they visited the Isle of Portland in the United Kingdom and Cherbourg in France. In January 1911, they returned to the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, before continuing to Norfolk, Virginia. After further maneuvers, the two ships split up; Michigan remained on the east coast, while South Carolina embarked on another trip to Europe. The ship visited Copenhagen (Denmark), Stockholm (Sweden), Kronstadt (Russia), and Kiel (Germany)‚Äîthe last during Kieler Woche, a large sailing event‚Äîbefore returning in July 1911.\\"South Carolina\\" and \\"Michigan,\\" Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships. South Carolina next took part in the 1911 naval review in New York, before several months of traveling to ports on the east coast and welcoming a visiting German naval squadron including the battlecruiser and two light cruisers. After a three-month overhaul in Norfolk, South Carolina joined Michigan on a cruise to Pensacola, New Orleans, Galveston, and Veracruz in Mexico, as part of the Special Service Squadron. South Carolina later visited Col√≥n, Panama, in January 1913. Both ships continued their previous service of visiting east coast ports before unrest in Mexico and the Caribbean caused the American government to order them away. South Carolina landed marines on Haiti on 28 January to protect the American delegation there. They returned to the ship when Oreste Zamor took power, but continued disorder later led the United States to occupy Haiti. South Carolina then joined Michigan at Veracruz while the United States occupied that city. At the beginning of the First World War, both of the South Carolina-class battleships were grouped with two older pre- dreadnoughts ( and Connecticut) due to their top speeds, which were lower than all subsequent US battleships. South Carolina was refitted in Philadelphia between 14 October and 20 February 1915, and both ships were kept on neutrality patrols on the American side of the Atlantic, even after the US entered the war on 6 April 1917. In January 1918, Michigan was training with the main fleet when it traveled through a strong storm. The high winds and waves caused its forward cage mast to collapse, killing six and injuring thirteen.Jones, US Battleship Operations, 110; \\"South Carolina\\" and \\"Michigan,\\" Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships. On 6 September 1918, South Carolina escorted a fast convoy partway across the Atlantic, becoming one of the first American battleships (alongside and ) to do so. When returning to the United States, South Carolina lost its starboard propeller. When continuing with the port propeller, a valve in its engine malfunctioned; continuing with an auxiliary valve caused a large amount of vibration, so the ship was stopped just hours later for temporary repairs on the main valve before continuing to the Philadelphia Naval Yard for repairs. Michigan had the same problem when escorting a convoy in the next month; the ship lost its port propeller on 8 October, but managed to return home on 11 October without further incident. After the war's end on 11 November 1918, both South Carolina-class battleships were used to repatriate American soldiers that had been fighting in the war.Jones, US Battleship Operations, 118‚Äì20. South Carolina being scrapped. Guns from previously dismantled battleships are stacked in front of the ship. In the years after the war, the two battleships were used for training cruises. The terms of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which limited naval construction to avert a vastly expensive naval arms race, also called for disposing of dozens of older battleships in the signatories' navies. South Carolina was decommissioned on 15 December 1921, shortly before the end of the conference, and its sister followed on 11 February 1922, days after the treaty was signed. Both were stricken from the navy listing on 10 November 1923 and scrapped during 1924 in the Philadelphia Naval Yard.  Footnotes  Endnotes  References = Books  * Breyer, Siegfried.

It consists of microcrystalline and organic particle debris. It was first described in 1975 and research has been performed since then to evaluate its importance in bacteria penetration into the dentinal tubules and its effects on endodontic treatment. More broadly, it is the organic layer found over all hard tooth surfaces. Description Early studies of dentinal walls after cavity preparation performed by Br√§nnstr√∂m and Johnson (1974) showed the presence of a thin layer of debris that was 2 to 5 micrometres thick. In 1975 McComb and Smith first described the smear layer. They observed an amorphous layer of debris, with an irregular and granular surface, on instrumented dentinal walls using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The thin, granular microcrystalline layer of debris was 2-5 micrometres thick and was found packed onto the canal wall. The authors stated that ‚Äúmost standard instrumentation techniques produced a canal wall that was smeared and packed with debris.‚Äù In the same year Mader et al. studied the morphological characteristics of the smear layer in teeth that were endodontically instrumented with k type files and irrigated with 5.25% NaOCl. The smear layer was examined from two aspects; the first aspect looked ‚Äúdown onto‚Äù the smear layer and the second from the side. Photomicrographs obtained by SEM showed that the smear layer consists of two confluent components. These were described as a thin superficial layer 1-2 micrometres thick overlying a densely packed layer and a second that penetrated into the dentinal tubules for distances of up to 40 micrometres. The packed material showed finger like structures projecting into the tubules from the canal wall. Contents= Composition  In 1984 Pashely described the smear layer as being composed of two phases; an organic phase, composed of collagen residues and glycosaminoglycans from extracellular matrix of pulp cells, which acts as a matrix for an inorganic phase. This organo-mineral content is composed of two distinct superimposed layers. The first layer covers the canal wall and is loosely adherent and easy to remove. The second layer however occludes the dentinal tubules and strongly adheres to the canal walls. = _Contents of the smear layer:_ = * Dentine particles * Residual vital pulp tissue * Residual necrotic pulp tissue * Erythrocytes * Remnant of odontoblast process * Saliva * Bacterial components  Thickness of the smear layer  The smear layer is a physical barrier that decreases the penetration of disinfecting agents into dentinal tubules, and consequently, their efficacy. The most important cause of endodontic failure is the residual microorganisms that are harboured within the root canal system and hard-to-reach areas. Studies were conducted into the thickness of smear layer created by different instruments, to enhance the understanding and aid the removal of the smear layer, and therefore aid the removal of any bacteria that may otherwise have been entombed by the smear layer. Results of the study showed that the Protaper series of rotary instruments caused the maximum amount of smear layer, followed by the Profile series of rotary instruments. The hand instruments caused the least amount of smear layer. Increasing the roughness of instruments has been found to increase the thickness of the smear layer as well.  Bacterial Penetration  Olgart et al. (1974) examined the penetration of bacteria into dentinal tubules of ground, fractured and acid treated dentin surfaces. In vitro the penetration of bacteria into tubules of intact dentin exposed by fracture was compared in pairs of teeth, one of which in each pair was mounted with intrapulpal hydrostatic pressure (30mmHg). In vivo, intra pair comparisons of bacterial invasion into dentinal tubules beneath ground, fractured and acid treated surfaces were made. They observed that an outward flow of fluids into the tubules due to intrapulpal pressure mechanically hindered bacterial growth and that the debris and smear layer produced from grinding obstructed the bacterial invasion into tubules. However this barrier seemed to be removed after a few days which allowed bacterial growth into intact dentin. Olgart came to a conclusion that acid produced by microorganisms may dissolve the smear layer allowing bacteria to pass into dentinal tubules.Olgart L, Br√§nnstr√∂m M, Johnson G. Invasion of bacteria into dentinal tubules: Experiments in vivo and Invitro. Acta Odontologica Scandinavica 1974; 32:61-70. However, when Pashley et al. (1981) studied the scanning electron microscope (SEM) appearance of dentin before and after removing successive layers of the smear layer they came to a different conclusion. Twenty dentin disks were cut from human extracted third molars. The dentin surface of the disks was etched with 6% citric acid for 5, 15, 30, 45 and 60 seconds. SEM examination showed that citric acid was able to remove smear layer in successive layers according to etching time finally exposing the dentinal tubules. Pashley concluded that the maintenance of the smear layer established a protective diffusion barrier.Pashley DH, Michelich V, Kehl T. Dentin permeability: effects of smear layer removal. J Prosthet Dent 1981; 46:531-7. Gettleman et al. (1991) assessed the influence of a smear layer on the adhesion of sealer cements to dentin. A total of 120 teeth was tested, 40 per sealer namely AH26, Sultan, and Sealapex; 20 each with and without the smear layer. The teeth were split longitudinally, and the internal surfaces were ground flat. In the smear layer-free specimens the smear layer was removed by washing for 3 minutes with 17% EDTA followed by 5.25% NaOCl. Using a specially designed jig, the sealer was placed into a 4-mm wide √ó 4-mm deep well which was then set onto the tooth at a 90-degree angle and allowed to set for 7 days. This set-up was then placed into a mounting jig which was designed for the Instron Universal Testing Machine so that only a tensile load was applied without shearing. The set-up was subjected to a tensile load at a crosshead speed of 1 mm per min. The only significant difference with regard to the presence or absence of the smear layer was found with AH26, which had a stronger bond when the smear layer was removed.Gettleman BH, Messer HH, ElDeeb ME. Adhesion of sealer cements to dentin with and without the smear layer. J Endod 1991; 17:15-20.  Removal of the smear layer = Why is the smear layer removed?  The smear layer can affect bonding, disinfection as well as obturation hence why it is considered important to remove. As discussed earlier this is a result of the fact that bacteria can be left entombed within the smear layer, if not removed. * Impaired bonding Removing the smear layer exposes the underlying bulk and the orifices of the dentine tubules which are occluded following mechanical tooth preparation. This allows interaction between the bulk dentine and restorative resin ensuring an effective bond and seal. Failure to remove the smear layer may compromise the bond strength and sealing ability as it may not be strongly bound to the underlying dentine. * Impaired disinfection If the smear layer is not removed during dental procedures, the disinfection process will be compromised as the disinfectant is unable to penetrate the infected dentinal tubules. The presence of bacteria in dentinal tubules can reduce the outward flow of dentinal fluid, promoting disease and an increased diffusion rate of substrates into tubules. Disease promotion can lead to inflammatory changes in the pulpo-dentinal complex, leading to pulpitis, pulpal necrosis, infection of the root canal system and periapical disease. This can cause pain, and discomfort and further complications if left unchecked. * Impaired obturation Following mechanical tooth preparation during endodontic procedures the smear layer can act as a barrier between filling materials and the root canal wall. This compromises the formation of a satisfactory seal, leading to possible coronal leakage. Bacteria left underneath a material can populate and allow the invasion of more bacteria into dentinal tubules infection and failure of treatment. Teeth prepared using GI sealant and lateral condensation of GP showed higher rates of leakage when smear layer was not removed.  How is the smear layer removed?  Endodontic Irrigation  Because the smear layer produced during endodontic instrumentation contains both inorganic and organic material, it cannot be removed by any of the presently available root canal irrigants alone. Therefore, the recommended protocol for smear layer removal is NaOCl followed by EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) or citric acid. Water, saline, chlorhexidine (CHX), or iodine compounds have no dissolving effect on the smear layer. * Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) The most widely used root canal irrigation solution for several decades because it is inexpensive, can dissolve infected necrotic tissue and is bactericidal. The antimicrobial effectiveness is due to its high pH. This interferes with the cytoplasmic membrane integrity with irreversible enzymatic inhibition, biosynthetic alterations in cellular metabolism and phospholipid degradation. When hypochlorite contacts proteins it causes amino acid degradation and hydrolysis through the action of chloramine molecules. Thus necrotic tissue and pus are dissolved. Both citric acid and EDTA immediately reduce the available chlorine in solution, rendering the sodium hypochlorite irrigant ineffective on bacteria and necrotic tissue. Hence, citric acid or EDTA should never be mixed with sodium hypochlorite. * Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) This is the most widely used chelating agent. Its prominence as a chelating agent arises from its ability to sequester di and triactionic metal ions such as Ca2+ and Fe3+. With direct exposure for extended time EDTA extracts bacterial surface proteins by combining with metal ions from the cell envelope, which can eventually lead to bacterial death. Effect of phosphoric acid etching and self-etching primer application methods on dentinal shear bond strength.Testing and clinical evidence has shown that 17% EDTA needs to be placed inside the root canal for one minute to effectively dissolve organic components and smear layer. If the EDTA is placed within the root canal for less than one minute, the smear layer will not optimally be removed. The recommended time for smear layer removal is two minutes. EDTA alone cannot remove the smear layer completely. The inorganic portion is removed but the organic matter is still left partially blocking the dentin canal openings. EDTA effectively abolishes the tissue‚Äêdissolving effect of NaOCl and should therefore not be used until at the end of the treatment as the final rinse. * Citric acid 10% citric acid can be used as an alternative to EDTA as the final rinse to remove the smear layer after use of NaOCL. Citric acid is more potent than EDTA. Citric acid is used as a component in MTAD and Tetraclean, the combination products for smear layer removal. In the MTAD preparation citric acid helps remove the smear layer by allowing the doxycycline to enter the dentinal tubules and exert an antibacterial effect. Paste Lubricants Gel based lubricants can be placed on the instrument before insertion into the root canal to reduce friction. Examples include ‚ÄúGlyde‚Äù and ‚ÄúFileze‚Äù which both contain the chelating agent EDTA which can help enlarge narrow root canals by softening the canal walls. Dentine conditioners These are generally acidic solutions which dissolve or at least solubilize the smear layer in attempt to expose the underlying dentine to the bonding agent. Examples include: phosphoric acid, nitric acid, maleic acid, citric acid, EDTA. Most manufacturers now supply a single agent to simultaneously etch enamel and condition the dentine. * Three step dentine bonding agents Three separate solutions, etch, prime and bond are applied to the tooth surface. Examples of such include Optibond, Adper Scotchbond MP, It is important to rinse tooth after application of the etch to ensure remove the smear layer. If there is no rinsing stage post conditioning, there can be re-deposition on the dentine surface. Following this the dentine is now ready to be treated with the primer and dentine bonding agent. Manufacturers have attempted to simplify this process by producing a variety of products to combine these stages. * Two step dentine bonding agents It is possible for the dentine conditioner and primer to be applied in one stage often referred to as a ‚Äúself-etching primer‚Äù examples: Clearfil SE Bond. The primer used is acidic which dissolves the smear layer whilst also providing the functions of a primer. ‚ÄúSelf-etching primers‚Äù should not be washed off as this would remove the primer and interfere with the bonding process. The smear layer is incorporated within the primer which has direct contact with bulk dentine. Two stage systems where the prime and bond steps are combined and the etch is applied separately also exist‚Äì examples include Prime & Bond NT, Optibond Solo. * One step dentine bonding agents Some manufacturers have produced products able to condition, prime and bond in one application. Such systems include Fuji bond, Scotchbond Universal, Xeno III. It has been argued that self-etching systems may not be as effective as a phosphoric acid at etching enamel alone. Further research Clark-Holke et al. (2003) focused on determining the effect of the smear layer on the magnitude of bacterial penetration through the apical foramen around obturating materials. Thirty extracted teeth were classified into two test groups; the first group had the smear layer removed by rinsing with 17% EDTA while in the second group the smear layer was left intact. Canal preparation and obturation using lateral condensation, gutta-percha, and AH 26 sealer was performed on all of the teeth. The model systems consisted of an upper chamber attached to the cemento-enamel junction and a lower chamber at the apices of the teeth. Standardized bacterial suspensions containing Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus and Peptostreptococcus micros were inoculated into the upper chambers. Models were incubated anaerobically at 37 ¬∞C. Leakage results were as follows: In the first group 6 teeth showed bacterial leakage, the second group and third groups showed no bacterial leakage. This study indicated that removal of the smear layer reduced the leakage of bacteria through the root canal system.Clark-Holke D, Drake D, Walton R, Rivera E, Guthmiller JM. Bacterial penetration through canals of endodontically treated teeth in the presence or absence of the smear layer. J Dent 2003; 31:275-281. Kokkas et al. (2004) examined the effect of the smear layer on the penetration depth of three different sealers (AH Plus, Apexit, and a Grossman type-Roth 811) into the dentinal tubules. Sixty four extracted human single-rooted teeth were used and divided into two groups. The smear layer remained intact in all the roots of group A. Complete removal of the smear layer in group B was achieved after irrigation with 3 ml of 17% EDTA for 3 min, followed by 3 ml of 1% NaOCl solution. Ten roots from each group were obturated with AH Plus and laterally condensed gutta-percha points. The same process was repeated for the remaining roots by using sealers Apexit and Roth 811 correspondingly. After complete setting, the maximum penetration depth of the sealers into the dentinal tubules was examined in upper, middle, and lower levels. The smear layer prevented all the sealers from penetrating dentinal tubules. In contrast, in smear layer‚Äìfree root canals, all the sealers penetrated dentinal tubules, although the depth of penetration varied between the sealers.Kokkas AB, Boutsioukis ACh, Vassiliadis LP, Stavrianos CK.

Furthermore, smear layer adversely affected the coronal and apical sealing ability of sealers. √áobankara et al. (2004) determined the effect of the smear layer on apical and coronal leakage in root canals obturated with AH26 or RoekoSeal sealers. A total of 160 maxillary anterior teeth were used. Eight groups were created by all possible combinations of three factors: smear layer (present/absent), leakage assessment (apical/coronal), and sealer used (AH26/Roeko-Seal). All teeth were obturated using lateral condensation technique of gutta-percha. A fluid filtration method was used to test apical or coronal leakage. According to the results of this study, the smear (+) groups displayed higher apical and coronal leakage than those smear (-) groups for both root canal sealers. Apical leakage was significantly higher than coronal leakage for both root canal sealers used in this study. It was determined that that removal of the smear layer has a positive effect in reducing apical and coronal leakage for both AH26 and RoekoSeal root canal sealers.√áobankara FK, Adanir N, Sema Belli. Evaluation of the influence of smear layer on the apical and coronal sealing ability of two sealers. J Endod 2004; 30:406-409. However Bertacci et al. (2007) evaluated the ability of a warm gutta-percha obturation system Thermafil to fill lateral channels in the presence or absence of the smear layer. Forty single-rooted extracted human teeth were randomly divided into two groups one of which had the smear layer removed by 5 ml of 5% NaOCl followed by 2.5 ml of 17% EDTA. Obturation was performed using AH Plus sealer and Thermafil. Specimens were cleared in methyl salicylate and analyzed under a stereomicroscope to evaluate the number, length, and diameter of lateral channels. All lateral channels were found to be filled in both groups. No statistically significant differences regarding number, length, and diameter were observed between the two groups. It was concluded that the smear layer did not prevent the sealing of lateral channels.Bertacci A, Baroni C, Breschi L, Venturi M, Prati C. The influence of smear layer in lateral channels filling. Clin Oral Investig 2007; 11:353-359. Yildirim et al. (2008) investigated the effect of the smear layer on apical microleakage in teeth obturated with MTA. Fifty single-rooted central maxillary teeth were used in this study. The selected teeth were instrumented and randomly divided into 2 groups. In the first group (smear [+]), the teeth were irrigated with only 5.25% NaOCl. In the second group (smear [-]), the teeth were irrigated with EDTA (17%) and NaOCl (5.25%) to remove the smear layer. The teeth were then filled with MTA. The computerized fluid filtration method was used for evaluation of apical microleakage. The quantitative apical leakage of each tooth was measured after 2, 30, and 180 days. It was found that there was no difference between the groups after 2 days but removal of the smear layer caused significantly more apical microleakage than when the smear layer was left intact after 30 and 180 days. It was concluded that the apical microleakage of MTA is less when the smear layer is present than when it is absent.Yildirim T, Oru√ßoƒülu H, Cobankara FK. Long-term evaluation of the influence of smear layer on the apical sealing ability of MTA. J Endod 2008; 34:1537-1540. Saleh et al. (2008) studied the effect of the smear layer on the penetration of bacteria along different root canal filling materials. A total of 110 human root segments were instrumented to size 80 under irrigation with 1% sodium hypochlorite. Half of the roots were irrigated with a 5-mL rinse of 17% EDTA to remove the smear layer. Roots were filled with gutta-percha (GP) and AH Plus sealer (AH), GP and Apexit sealer (AP), or RealSeal cones and sealer (RS). Following storage in humid conditions at 37 ¬∞C for 7 days, the specimens were mounted into a bacterial leakage test model for 135 days. Survival analyses were performed to calculate the median time of leakage and log-rank test was used for pairwise comparisons of groups. Selected specimens were longitudinally sectioned and inspected by scanning electron microscopy for the presence of bacteria at the interfaces. In the presence of the smear layer, RS and AP leaked significantly more slowly than in its absence. In the absence of the smear layer, AH leaked significantly more slowly than RS. It was concluded that removal of the smear layer did not impair bacterial penetration along root canal fillings. A comparison of the sealers revealed no difference except that AH performed better than RS in the absence of the smear layer.Saleh IM, Ruyter IE, Haapasalo M, √òrstavik D. Bacterial penetration along different root canal filling materials in the presence or absence of smear layer. Int Endod J. 2008; 41:32-40. Fachin et al.(2009) evaluated whether smear layer removal has any influence on the filling of the root canal system, by examining the obturation of lateral canals, secondary canals and apical deltas. Eighty canines were randomly divided into two groups, according to their irrigation regimen. Both groups were irrigated with 1% NaOCl during canal shaping, but only the teeth in Group II received a final irrigation with 17% EDTA for smear layer removal. The root canals were obturated with lateral condensation of gutta-percha and the specimens were cleared, allowing for observation under the microscope. The results showed that In Groups I and II, 42.5% and 37.5% of the teeth, respectively, presented at least one filled canal ramification. In conclusion, smear layer removal under the conditions tested in this study did not affect the obturation of root canal ramifications when lateral condensation of gutta-percha was the technique used for root canal filling.Fachin EV, Scarparo RK, Massoni LI. Influence of smear layer removal on the obturation of root canal ramifications. J Appl Oral Sci 2009; 17:240-243.

Joshua Unlike many other Tannaitic sages, he is not recognized by his father's name, but rather with his uncle's name, R. Joshua ben Hananiah. He does not appear on the Mishnah at all. Sometimes he is recorded in baraitas as merely Hananiah,Shabbat 36b; Erubin 26a; Sukkah 20b; Ketubot 79b; etc. which can lead to confusion with Hananiah ben Akavia. Biography He was a contemporary of Judah ben Bathyra, Matteya ben Heresh, and Jonathan.Sifre, Deuteronomy 80 Who his father was is not stated; nor is anything known of his early years. He was named after his grandfather, Hananiah. He acquired his Torah knowledge from his uncle R. Joshua ben Hananiah (from whom he received his cognomen), and witnessed his uncle's activities on the Sanhedrin of Yavne. In the days of Gamaliel II he once ventured to give a decision, for which he was summoned before Gamaliel; but his uncle, by reporting that he himself had given Hananiah the decision, mollified Gamaliel.Niddah 24b It was probably about that time that Hananiah fell in with some sectarians at Capernaum. To remove him from their influence his uncle advised him to leave the country, which he did, emigrating to Babylonia, where he opened a school that eventually acquired great fame.Sanhedrin 32b; Ecclesiastes Rabbah 1:8, 7:26 He returned to his native country with ritualistic decisions which had been communicated to him by a Babylonian scholar, and which he submitted to his uncle.Sukkah 20b After the failure of the Bar Kokhba revolt, and the death of Rabbi Akiva and R. Judah ben Baba, Haninah survived to remain the greatest scholar sage of the generation (\\"Gadol\\") in the Land of Israel. But following the persecution that accompanied the Bar Kochba rebellion, he again emigrated to Babylonia, settling at Nehar Pekod.See Neubauer, \\"G. T.\\" pp. 363 et seq. Hananiah's arrival in Babylonia threatened to produce a schism with far- reaching consequences: it created a movement toward the secession of the Babylonian congregations from the central authority of the Palestinian Sanhedrin. Believing that Roman tyranny had permanently suppressed the religious institutions which had previously united the Jewish people despite its dispersion, Hananiah attempted to establish an authoritative body in his new home. To render the Babylonian schools independent of Palestine, he arranged a calendar fixing the Jewish festivals and bissextile years on the principles that prevailed in Palestine. In the meantime, however, Hadrian's death had brought about a favorable change in Judea. In March, 139 or 140, a message arrived from Rome announcing the repeal of the Hadrianic decrees;See Megillat Taanit 12 soon thereafter the surviving rabbis, especially the disciples of Akiva, convened at Usha, and reorganized the Sanhedrin with Simeon ben Gamliel II as president.Rosh Hashana 31b et seq.; see Rapoport, \\"'Erek Millin,\\" pp. 233b et seq. They sought to reestablish the central authority, and naturally would not tolerate any rivals. Messengers were therefore dispatched to Nehar-Pe·∏≥od, instructed to urge Hananiah to acknowledge the authority of the parent Sanhedrin. The messengers at first approached him in a kindly spirit, showing him great respect. This he reciprocated, and he presented them to his followers as superior personages; but when he realized their real mission he endeavored to discredit them. They, for their part, contradicted him in his lectures; what he declared pure they denounced as impure; and when at last he asked them, \\"Why do you always oppose me?\\" they plainly told him, \\"Because you, contrary to law, ordain bissextile years in foreign lands.\\" \\"But did not Akiba do so before me?\\" asked he; to which they replied, \\"Certainly he did; but you cannot compare yourself with Akiva, who left none like him in Palestine.\\" \\"Neither have I left my equal in Palestine,\\" cried Hananiah; and the messengers retorted, \\"The kids you left behind you have since developed into horned bucks, and these have deputed us to urge you to retrace your steps, and, if you resist, to excommunicate you.\\" The Palestinian sources relate that the deputies, to impress upon him the enormity of secession from the parent authority, publicly parodied Scriptural passages. One of them substituted \\"Hananiah\\" for \\"the Lord\\" in \\"These are the feasts of the Lord\\" (Leviticus 23:4). Another recited, \\"Out of Babylonia shall go forth the Law, and the word of the Lord from Nehar-Pe·∏≥od,\\" instead of \\"Out of Zion\\" and \\"from Jerusalem\\" (Isaiah 2:3). When the people corrected them by calling out the proper readings, the deputies laconically replied Gavan! (= \\"With us!\\").Yerushalmi Nedarim 6 40a They also declared that the steps taken by Hananiah and his followers were tantamount to building an altar on unholy ground and serving it with illegitimate priests. In short, they argued, his course was a renunciation of the God of Israel. The people recognized their error, and repented; but Hananiah held out. He appealed to Judah ben Bathyra, then in Nisibis, for support; but the latter not only refused to participate in the secession movement, but convinced Hananiah to submit to the orders emanating from the Judean Sanhedrin.Berachot 63a Hananiah ended his life peacefully in Babylonia.Ecclesiastes Rabbah 1:8 Teachings Although Hananiah was a prominent figure in his day, rivaling for a time the patriarch in Judea, his name is connected with only few halakhot, either originalTosefta Peah 3:3; Ketubot 79b or transmitted,Eruvin 43a; Beitzah 17b; Sukkah 20b; Niddah 24b and with still fewer halakhic midrashim.Mekhilta, Bo, 16; Sifre, Numbers 49, 116; Hagigah 10a; Shevuot 35b Only two or three aggadot are recorded as his. One declares that where Scripture says, \\"King Solomon loved many strange women\\" (I Kings 11:1), it does not mean to impugn his chastity; but it implies that he transgressed the Biblical inhibition, \\"Thou shalt not make marriages with them\\" (Deuteronomy 7:3).Yerushalmi Sanhedrin 2 20c Another asserts that the tablets of the Ten Commandments (Deuteronomy 4:13) contained after each command its scope in all its ramifications; that the Commandments were interwoven with expositions as are the billows of the sea with smaller waves.Yerushalmi Shekalim 6 49d; Shir haShirim Rabbah 5:14 References * Category:Mishnah rabbis ","title":"Haninah ben Ahi R.

He alleges he was sent to a military school as well. He attended University of Southern California, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Performing Arts. His father was a public relations official for TRW, and his mother was radio/TV personality and health author Maureen Kennedy Salaman. Both parents were fundamentalist Christians but Morton became a self-described \\"New Age thinker\\". He has said that as a child he often heard astronauts describe their experiences with extraterrestrials. Although he claims to have had extensive contact with astronauts in his childhood, in later life Morton alleged that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was \\"fake.\\" Morton became interested in the paranormal after a 1985 trip to England and Ireland where he became involved in what he calls either the Green Stone saga or the Meonia Stone saga. He later went to India where he met with the Dalai Lama. Morton claims that while in India, he was taught the secrets of time travel by Nepalese monks and that they also helped him to develop a system of remote viewing. Doctorate Morton uses the title \\"Doctor\\" in formal situations such as conference presentations.See, for example, the program of the Conscious Life Expo, February 2015 . He was also captioned as \\"Doctor\\" when he appeared on the Cable TV series Ancient Aliens.

The \\"Level V program\\", claimed to be the equivalent of a doctorate, requires 120 graduate credits for a fee of $40 CAN per credit. Work Between 1985 and 1996, Morton produced documentaries on subjects including the Chupacabra and Bigfoot. He also led tours around Area 51. Morton suggested that aliens from Area 51 were from \\"Krondac,\\" a planet 800 light- years away. Morton was the subject of an article by the website UFO Watchdog, \\"The Shameless Psychic and His Prophecy of Lies\\", which threw doubt on many of Morton's claims. Morton filed a lawsuit against the site for libel but the case was dismissed.  Securities fraud charges  From 1996 to 2010, Morton ran Delphi Associates Newsletter (DAN), a print and online publication in which he made economic, financial and political predictions. In 2001, Morton predicted that the Dow Jones Industrial Average would rise to somewhere around 12,000 in December. The index actually ended at 8,341. In 2007, he founded The Delphi Investment Group to allow investors to profit from trading in world currencies based on his predictions. On March 7, 2010, Morton and his wife Melissa were charged with civil securities fraud. He is alleged to have defrauded around 100 customers of $6 million between 2006 and 2007. According to the SEC, only a fraction of the money received by Morton went into foreign exchange trading accounts, with the rest diverted to shell companies run by Morton and his wife. In 2009, Morton attempted to file suit against the SEC for harassment, but the suit was dismissed. In February 2013, Morton was ordered by a judge to pay $11.5 million to the SEC within 14 days.

Famous quotes from Henrik Ibsen are incorporated into the sidewalks of prominent city streets. History The initiative was taken by Sune Nordgren, inspired by a similar project involving August Strindberg quotes in Stockholm, Sweden. In 2001, Gavin Jantjes was appointed curator of the work. Sixty quotes in steel lettering were to be set into the sidewalks. The work was to be completed by 2006, the 100th anniversary of Henrik Ibsen's death.

The group behind the project, the Ibsen Foundation, explained that in their view the money had not been specifically earmarked. In 2006, the Ibsen Foundation was relieved of involvement in the project. Between 2006 and 2008, the project advanced, resulting in a work of art consisting of 69 quotes and 4,011 letters.

The IDF's Southern Command, under Yigal Allon, concentrated forces to push into the Sinai following their success in the Battle of Bir 'Asluj and the Battle of 'Auja. Forces from the Negev and 8th brigades entered the Sinai on December 28 and at night captured Umm Katef and Abu Ageila, about 25km inside Egyptian territory. They continued north to al-Arish, which Allon planned to capture, in order to encircle the Egyptian expeditionary force in Palestine and end the war. However, due to political and diplomatic considerations, all Israeli forces retreated from the Sinai on January 2, 1949. Another attempt to encircle the Egyptian forces was made on the next day in the Battle of Rafah, but Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion ordered the IDF to turn back, ending military engagements in the war. Background The third and final stage of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War started on October 15, 1948, when Israel launched Operation Yoav on the southern front. While the Israelis made significant tactical and strategic gains in Operation Yoav, the political situation changed little and Egypt was still dragging its feet on proposed armistice talks. Operation Horev was therefore launched in the south with the final aim of expelling all Egyptian forces from Israel. Prelude Israeli armored vehicles approaching the Sinai border The main thrust of Operation Horev was in the south, and on December 25‚Äì27, Israeli forces captured the Beersheba‚Äì'Auja road, including Bir 'Asluj. The Southern Command decided to exploit this success in order to complete the rest of Operation Horev, namely, to surround and eventually expel all Egyptian forces from Palestine. The order was given to move into the Sinai Peninsula on the morning of December 28. This order directly contradicted the General Staff plan, which forbade entering Egyptian territory. According to Yitzhak Rabin, then the operations officer of the Southern Command, the command attempted to create facts on the ground before getting the necessary approval for the action. The original Southern Command plan called for the thrust to be done by the 8th Brigade, but it had not had time to recover from the Battle of 'Auja, and it was necessary to quickly overwhelm the Egyptian forces in the peninsula, so the Southern Command decided to send the Negev Brigade instead. Abu Ageila was a small oasis in the desert situated on an important road junction. It contained a few clay houses and a village, a water well and a dam for water collection in the winter months. Operation Beginning While the battles on the Beersheba‚Äì'Auja road were raging, the IDF initiated Operation Beginning (, Mivtza Hat·∏•ala) with the aim of cutting off supply to the Egyptian forces in Gaza by destroying sections of the coastal railway. At 11:15 on December 26, a force of sappers rendezvoused with the Israel Navy and two patrol boats, INS Sa'ar and INS Palmach, landed the troops in the Sinai, between al-Arish and Rafah, at 21:45. The sappers planted their bombs on the 235th kilometer of the railway, returned to their ships at 03:00 on December 27, and the charges blew at 06:00. Battle of Umm Katef Egyptian prisoners at the entrance to Abu Ageila The Israeli task force set out into the Sinai at 14:00 on December 28. This was the first time that many of the soldiers, including Yitzhak Rabin, visited another country. The force consisted, in the order of movement, of the Negev Brigade's 9th Battalion and staff, the 82nd Battalion of the 8th Brigade, and the Negev's 7th Infantry Battalion. Israeli aircraft mistakenly attacked them, killing one soldier and injuring another, until a flag resembling the Israeli (a military flag from the Jewish Brigade) was flown. At 16:30, the force attacked Umm Katef, the position overlooking Abu Ageila. The Egyptians had a strength of about one battalion. They repelled the Israeli attack with anti-tank fire, while part of the attacking 9th Battalion got bogged down in the sands and failed to reach the position. At this time, the IDF Chief of Operations Yigael Yadin sent out an order to Yigal Allon not to capture Abu Ageila until the latter came to see him. At night, Israeli artillery began a barrage on Umm Katef. The 7th Battalion then outflanked the position, and by 02:30 on December 29, it was in Israeli hands. The Egyptians retreated to Abu Ageila, and when the Israelis entered it at dawn, the Egyptians left for al-Arish. Ten vehicles, three PIATs and small arms were captured at Umm Katef. In the meantime, Harel Brigade forces, including its staff, also entered the Sinai. Upon capturing the area, the Negev forces set free the Palestinian Arab prisoners who had been held by the Egyptians, but took in several hundred Egyptians who surrendered. Raids and advance to al- Arish After the capture of Abu Ageila, the bulk of the Israeli task force continued north, while units from the 7th Battalion remained to dig in. It met with Egyptian aerial bombardment that attempted to slow their advance to the al-Arish area. At 15:00 on December 29, the 9th Battalion captured the airfield at Bir Lahfan without encountering resistance. In the evening, Bir Lahfan, about 13 km south of al-Arish, was taken by the 82nd Battalion, which defeated the Egyptian battalion stationed there. They managed to capture the battalion commander‚Äîthe highest-ranking Egyptian officer to be taken alive by Israel during the war‚Äîand four aircraft. While Yigal Allon's objective was the capture of al-Arish itself, he withheld this information from his superiors. His forces pushed on towards al-Arish and stopped about 8 km to the south of the city. Fearing for the aircraft, the Egyptians emptied the nearby airbases. Meanwhile, on December 29, Harel and Negev forces conducted raids deep into the Sinai Peninsula. Three platoons from the 7th Battalion meant to raid the Bir al-Hamma airfield, but met with heavy fire and retreated. However, they managed to destroy three airplanes on the ground. On December 31, a platoon from the 10th Battalion (Harel Brigade) raided Bir al-Hassana and captured about 200‚Äì500 prisoners. Other Harel forces from the 10th and 4th battalions, stationed at 'Auja, attacked and captured Kusseima on the same day, taking dozens of prisoners. Bir al-Hassana, 100km inside Egypt, 1948 On the evening of December 29, Yigal Allon visited Nahum Sarig and the Negev Brigade staff at Bir Lahfan and ordered the forces to organize for the capture of al-Arish at midnight. He then flew to Tel Aviv to meet Yadin, who was sick at home, and tried to persuade him to authorize his plan to capture al-Arish and encircle the Egyptians in the Gaza corridor. However, he failed and ordered his troops to withhold the assault. A subsequent meeting with Prime Minister David Ben- Gurion in the morning of December 30 did not change matters. On the next day, the Israeli forces returned to Abu Ageila. The complete withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula lasted until January 2, 1949. Despite the refusal to fight in the Sinai, Yadin permitted Allon to instead move from 'Auja to Rafah and encircle the Egyptians from there. While by the time of Yadin and Ben-Gurion's refusal, there had been almost no international pressure to stop the advance into the Sinai, partly because it had not been clear whether the Sinai had indeed been invaded, on December 30 both the British and American government called for Israel's withdrawal to the international boundary, and the British allowed the Egyptians to use their airbases in Egypt for refueling.

While the IDF was denied its space to maneuver in the Sinai against the Egyptian forces still on its territory, it subsequently attacked Rafah and encircled the entire Egyptian expeditionary force. However, by this time the Egyptian government announced its agreement to negotiate armistice with the Israelis, which caused Ben-Gurion to order the troops' withdrawal yet again, effectively ending combat in the war. The Sinai Peninsula saw a number of skirmishes in the early 1950s between Israeli and Egyptian forces, culminating in Operation Volcano in 1955. The next war fought in the area was the 1956 Suez War. The area of Umm Katef ‚Äì Abu Ageila also saw fighting in the 1967 Six-Day War.

Primarily a switching railroad, it made a complete loop around the city of Toledo, crossing the Maumee River twice. Track history In its heyday, the TTR was double-tracked all the way around the city of Toledo, except for the portion around the Upper Maumee Bridge. The Toledo Terminal Upper Maumee River Swing Bridge. Built in 1902, it was abandoned after it was damaged by a March 1982 derailment. It was demolished between October 2018 and May 2019.On March 17, 1982, a train derailed on the Upper Maumee Bridge, damaging it. The Toledo Terminal elected not to fix the bridge, instead abandoning it, stirring up much controversy. In 1983 it announced plans to lay continuous welded rail in north and west Toledo. In January 2010, CSX Transportation petitioned to abandon the rest of the \\"Backside\\" of the Toledo Terminal (the portion on the west side of the Maumee River) from Temperance, on Toledo's north side, to a small portion just north of Norfolk Southern's Chicago Main, in Vulcan. All of the removal track has since been completed, and plans are underway to turn the right-of-way into a rail trail. This leaves only a small, inactive segment from the Vulcan to the ex-Wabash mainline near Gould on Toledo's south side. The portion of the Toledo Terminal from Temperance to Bates, mainly the east of the Maumee River, is still in use by CSX. Corporate history The carrier was incorporated December 4, 1907, under the general laws of Ohio, for the purpose of acquiring the property, rights, and franchises formerly owned by The Toledo Railway and Terminal Company, which was done. The date of organization was December 4, 1907. The carrier acquired by deed dated December 4, 1907, the property, rights, and franchises of the predecessor company, which had been sold at foreclosure sale on May 28, 1907. The latter was incorporated February 12, 1901, under the general laws of the State of Ohio. Development of fixed physical property The owned property of the carrier, comprising of main-line railroad, of second main track, of yard tracks and sidings, a freight and passenger station, and certain other terminal facilities at Toledo, Ohio, was acquired partly by purchase after foreclosure proceedings, as previously explained, and partly by construction. The main- line mileage, of yard tracks and sidings, the freight and passenger station, and certain other terminal facilities were constructed for The Toledo Railway and Terminal Company by The Toledo Railway and Terminal Construction Company during the years 1901, 1902, and 1903, and the entire line was opened for operation on October 1, 1903. The of second main track and of yard tracks and sidings were constructed by the carrier during 1914, the work being performed by its own forces. In addition to the foregoing, the carrier owns jointly with the Pere Marquette Railway Company of yard tracks and sidings.

Morschhauser, David Varricchio, Gao Chunling, Liu Jinyuan, Wang Xuri, Cheng Xiadong and Meng Qingjin. The generic name combines the Latin rapax, \\"grasping\\", with avis, \\"bird\\", in reference to the special grasping function of the foot. The specific name honours Pan as discoverer. It is also an allusion to Pan, the god of the forests, because the species was assumed to have been arboreal. The holotype, DMNH D2522, was found in a layer of the Jiufotang Formation dating from the early Albian. It consists of a nearly complete skeleton with skull, on a slab. When the slab was split from its counterplate, the bones did not split with them, preserving them perfectly. The specimen was in 2009 described after having been observed without any preparation. It represents a subadult individual. Later it was prepared but in an unprofessional way, damaging the skeleton, especially the skull where the entire right jugal bone was removed.

Tanden has worked on the campaigns of several Democratic presidential candidates, including those of Michael Dukakis in 1988, Bill Clinton in 1992, and the general election campaign of Barack Obama in 2008. Tanden advised Hillary Clinton‚Äôs successful 2016 primary campaign and unsuccessful 2016 general election campaign. Earlier, she had been a senior staffer on Clinton's unsuccessful campaign for the 2008 Democratic nomination. She helped draft health care legislation for the Barack Obama administration with work on the Affordable Care Act. She is regarded as a Clinton loyalist and longtime confidante.  Early life  Neera Tanden was born on September 10, 1970, in Bedford, Massachusetts, to immigrant parents from India. She has a brother, Raj. Her parents divorced when she was five, after which Tanden's mother was on welfare for nearly two years before obtaining a job as a travel agent.Nikhila Panti, \\"Hillary is a role model & a friend\\", Times of India, March 11, 2007 She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1992. In 1996, she received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale University, where she was Submissions Editor for the Yale Law & Policy Review., YLPR masthead, Issue 13.2 As a freshman at the University of California, Los Angeles, Tanden met her future husband, artist Benjamin Edwards. Edwards and Tanden both volunteered on Michael Dukakis's unsuccessful run for president in 1988. Tanden worked as a precinct leader in the Bel Air district of West Los Angeles where many households had already contributed to the Dukakis campaign. Career After graduating from Yale Law School, Tanden moved to Washington, D.C., where she has worked on domestic policy on Capitol Hill, in think tanks, and for various Democratic senatorial and presidential campaigns. She has also written on Indian-American issues.The New Republic: \\"The GOP's New Diversity\\", NPR, June 30, 2010 Work with the Clintons Tanden has been regarded as a Clinton loyalist and personal friend of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs, whose career has largely been defined by her professional ties to the Clintons. She worked with President Bill Clinton's campaign on new energy policies, and health-care reform, as associate director for domestic policy in the Clinton White House, and as senior advisor in the First Lady‚Äôs Office. In 1999 and 2000, she worked for Hillary Clinton on her successful senatorial campaign in New York, as her deputy campaign manager and issues director, and as such, crafted policy proposals for the campaign. After the election, Tanden served as Senator Clinton's Legislative Director from 2003 to 2005. She served as Hillary Clinton's policy director for her unsuccessful bid for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, shaping its policy proposals. Tanden supervised debate preparation for Senator Clinton's participation in the Democratic presidential nomination debates during 2007 and 2008. Continuing her association with Hillary Clinton, Tanden was an unpaid adviser to Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs successful 2016 primary season nomination campaign and unsuccessful general election campaign in opposition to Republican candidate Donald Trump, while also running the Center for American Progress. Tanden was considered a candidate for a top White House job, had Mrs. Clinton won the presidency. After Clinton secured the Democratic nomination for president in 2016, Tanden was named to her transition team.  2008 Obama general election campaign  After Barack Obama was nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate, Tanden was one of the first, and also one of the few, former Clinton campaign staffers to join his team; she served as Domestic Policy Director for his successful general election campaign, where she managed all domestic policy proposals for the campaign.  Obama administration  Tanden also served in the Obama administration as senior adviser to Secretary Kathleen Sebelius of the Department of Health and Human Services. She worked on the drafting of the administration's health care legislation, including work specific to its proposed, but later withdrawn public plan option, before parts of it became public law as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and negotiated with Congress and stakeholders on several provisions of the bill. She has been described as one of the ‚Äúkey architects‚Äù of the Affordable Care Act. The Center for American Progress Tanden with John Podesta (left) and Governor Martin O'Malley (right) In 2003, Senator Clinton supported Tanden's central role in the founding of the Center for American Progress, or CAP. Tanden worked as Senior Vice President for Domestic Policy, while also serving as Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and, starting in 2010, as Chief Operating Officer. In October of 2011, Tanden succeeded John Podesta as CAP's president. The Washington Post's Jason Horowitz described CAP as \\"Washington‚Äôs leading liberal think tank, which is an incessant advocate for a broad progressive agenda and as such a sharp thorn in President Obama‚Äôs left side.\\" Ed Lee, Nancy Pelosi and Tom Perez, 2014 In 2016, a hacker gained access to John Podesta's private emails (aka the Podesta emails), some which were emails exchanged with Tanden. In one exchange, on August 11, 2015, while discussing news that Harvard University law professor Lawrence Lessig was exploring a bid for the Democratic nomination, Tanden wrote of Lessig, \\"I fucking hate that guy.\\" Lessig responded to the incident by saying that while he supported whistle blowing and a pardon of Edward Snowden, Tanden should not have to be burdened with having her private emails scrutinized and that it was not in the public interest. Tanden called the release of her personal communications, which often feature her blunt private assessments, a painful experience to endure. After the 2016 election and Clinton‚Äôs loss, Tanden refocused the work of the Center for American Progress, aiming to have the think tank, and especially its advocacy arm (the Center for American Progress Action Fund), serve as a ‚Äúcentral hub for Trump resistance‚Äù as well as playing a leading role in shaping the healthcare debate within the Democratic Party. In 2018, reports emerged that Tanden had unintentionally revealed the first name of a CAP employee complaining of sexual harassment.https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahmimms/center-for- american-progress-staff-shocked-after-neera On April 28, 2020, Tanden was named to serve on New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy‚Äôs Restart and Recovery Commission tasked with preparing the state to reopen after the novel coronavirus lockdown.  Media and writing  Tanden has had a regular column for The New Republic online. She has appeared on the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, Real Time with Bill Maher, MSNBC, CNN, and Fox programs.Appointments: \\"Neera Tanden\\", NRI (Non-Resident Indian) Internet, February 2, 2011; accessed August 1, 2016  Political views  Neera Tanden, who frequently describes herself as a progressive, belongs to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. She credits her experience as a child relying on welfare programs as well as the formative moment of witnessing Anita Hill's testimony against Clarence Thomas in 1991 with setting her on the path of career in public policy. Under Tanden's leadership, the Center for American Progress has proposed strengthening the Child Tax Credit (CTC) and joined efforts to push for universal paid leave; she has argued for expanding TANF to serve more families and has taken a stand against work requirements for welfare recipients as well as against Right to Work laws. Having worked on passage of the Affordable Care Act during the Obama administration, Tanden has remained a strong proponent of universal healthcare, preferring a multi-payer model with an insurance mandate (similar to countries such as Germany) over single-payer healthcare and expressing skepticism over the viability of proposed Medicare for All bills. In 2019, the Center for American Progress proposed Medicare Extra for All, a blueprint for achieving a multi-payer universal healthcare system. Tanden has also praised the similar Medicare for America bill introduced in the House of Representatives. In 2018, Tanden endorsed the idea of a job guarantee to help revitalize economically-stagnant regions in the United States. She has been a vocal critic of progressive U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, his policy proposals, and his supporters. She herself is also a frequent target of criticism by Sanders supporters.

It is based on the story of serial killer Dean Corll and his teenage accomplices David Brooks and Elmer Wayne Henley. The play develops the conceit that Brooks has learnt puppetry in prison and, as part of his rehabilitation, acts out the murders in which he participated via the use of glove puppets and ventriloquism. The performance also involved sections in which the audience read about the murders in pamphlets, entitled \\"Two Texts for a Puppet Play by David Brooks\\" that were distributed. The production premiered on 5 March 2008 in Brest, France.See the Jerk page on Gis√®le Vienne's website. The play was also performed in an English-language version at the South London Gallery as part of the Paris Calling season of performing arts, opening on 1 July 2009.See the SLG Events webpage. Its performance included music by Peter Rehberg. In his analysis of Jerk, theater scholar Jordan Schildcrout states, \\"The production becomes a meta-puppet show when the actor playing David is giving voice to the puppets playing the killers, who in turn give voice to the puppets playing the corpses... In the final scenario, though, David abandons his puppets and does all the voices, including his own, as a ventriloquist, not moving his lips, as if he is also losing his humanity, becoming increasingly inanimate. In the story, David is ultimately alone in a house of corpses, and in performance he is alone on an empty stage, with only lifeless puppets sharing the space.\\" ReferencesSources * Cooper, Dennis. 1993.

Native American jewelry refers to items of personal adornment, whether for personal use, sale or as art; examples of which include necklaces, earrings, bracelets, rings and pins, as well as ketohs, wampum, and labrets, made by one of the Indigenous peoples of the United States. Native American jewelry normally reflects the cultural diversity and history of its makers, but tribal groups have often borrowed and copied designs and methods from other, neighboring tribes or nations with which they had trade, and this practice continues today. Native American tribes continue to develop distinct aesthetics rooted in their personal artistic visions and cultural traditions. Artists may create jewelry for adornment, ceremonies, and display, or for sale or trade.

Metalsmiths, beaders, carvers, and lapidaries combine these materials to create jewelry. Contemporary Native American jewelry ranges from hand-quarried and processed stones and shells to computer-fabricated steel and titanium jewelry. Navajo silversmith, photo by George Ben Wittick, 1883 Origins Jewelry in the Americas has an ancient history. The earliest known examples of jewelry North American are four bone earrings founded at the Mead Site, near Fairbanks, Alaska that date back 12,000 years. Beginning as far back as 8800 BCE, Paleo-Indians in the American Southwest drilled and shaped multicolored stones and shells into beads and pendants.Dubin 466 Olivella shell beads, dating from 6000 BCE, were found in Nevada; bone, antler, and possibly marine shell beads from 7000 BCE were found in Russell Cave in Alabama; copper jewelry was traded from Lake Superior beginning in 3000 BCE; and stone beads were carved in Poverty Point in Louisiana in 1500 BCE.Dubin 29 Necklaces of heishe beads, or shell ground into flat discs, have been discovered in ancient ruins. Remnants of seashells that were used to make beads were also found. Oyster shell, mother of pearl, abalone, conch and clam shells have been important trade items in the Southwest for over a thousand years. Native beadwork continued to advance in the pre-Columbian era. Beads were made from hand-ground and filled turquoise, coral, and shell. Carved wood, animal bones, claws, and teeth were made into beads, which were then sewn onto clothing, or strung into necklaces.AdairMorgan, William Henry. League of the Ho-D-No-Sau-Nee or Iroquois. Volume 2. 1851 Turquoise is one of the dominant materials of Southwestern Native American jewelry. Thousands of pieces were found in the Ancestral Pueblo sites at Chaco Canyon. Some turquoise mines date back to Precolumbian times, and Ancestral Pueblo peoples traded the turquoise with Mesoamericans. Some turquoise found in southern Arizona dates back to 200 BCE.Anderson, Lee.

Great Plains Nickel silver comb by Bruce Caesar (Pawnee-Sac and Fox, 1984) Oklahoma History Center Plains Indians are most well known for their beadwork. Beads on the Great Plains date back to at least to 8800 BCE, when a circular, incised lignite bead was left at the Lindenmeier Site in Colorado.Dubin 239 Shells such as marginella and olivella shells were traded from the Gulf of Mexico and the coasts of California into the Plains since 100 CE. Mussel shell gorgets, dentalia, and abalone were prized trade items for jewelry.Dubin 241 Bones provided material for beads as well, especially long, cylindrical beads called hair pipes, which were extremely popular from 1880 to 1910 and are still are very common in powwow regalia today. These are used in chokers, breastplates, earrings, and necklaces worn by women and men, and in ceremonial headdresses as well.Ewers, John C. \\"The Substitution of the Bone Hair Pipe.\\" Hair Pipes in Plains Indian Adornment: A Study in Indian and White Ingenuity. (retrieved 6 Aug 2011) Porcupine quillwork is a traditional embellishment for textiles on the northern Plains, but quillwork is also used in creating bracelets, earrings, hatbands, belt buckles, headdresses, hair roaches, and hairclips, as well as umbilical cord fetishes. Glass beads were first introduced to the Plains as early as 1700 and were used in decoration in a manner similar to quillwork, but they never fully replaced it. The Lakota became particularly adept at glass bead work, especially the members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in the Western Dakotas. Several award-winning quillworkers are active in the art world today, such as Juanita Growing Thunder Fogarty (Assiniboine- Sioux).Indyke, Dottie. Juanita Growing Thunder-Fogarty. Southwest Art. (retrieved 6 Aug 2011) Metal jewelry came to the Plains through Spanish and Mexican metalsmiths and trade with tribes from other regions. Southern Plains Native Americans adopted metalsmithing in the 1820s. They typically cut, stamped, and cold hammered German silver, a nickel alloy.Dubin 284 Plains men adopted metal pectorals and armbands.Dubin 285 In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, members of the Native American Church revealed their membership to others through pins with emblems of peyote buttons, water bird, and other religious symbols.Dubin 291 Bruce Caesar (Sac and Fox-Pawnee) is one of the most prolific Southern Plains metalsmiths active today and was awarded the NEA's National Heritage Fellowship in 1998.\\"Lifetime Honors: Bruce Caesar.\\" National Endowment for the Arts.

The earliest beads are larger when compared to later beads and those of wampum, with hand drilled holes. The use of the more slender iron drills much improved drilling. \\"Wampum\\" is a Wampanoag word referring to the white shells of the channeled whelk shell. The term now refers to both those and the purple beads from quahog clamshells.Dubin 170-171 Wampum workshops were located among the Narragansett tribe, an Algonquian people located along the southern New England coast. The Narragansett tribal bead makers were buried with wampum supplies and tools to finish work in progress in the afterlife. Wampum was highly sought as a trade good throughout the Eastern Woodlands, including the Great Lakes region. Narragansett favored teardrop-shaped shell pendants, and the claw pendants made of purple shell were worn by Iroquois in the Hudson Valley, around the Connecticut River. The Seneca and Munsee made shell pendants with drilled columns, decorated with a circular shell called a runtee. Whelk shells were carved into bird, turtle, fish, and other shaped pendants, as well as ear spools.Dubin 169, 174 Carved stone pendants in the Northeastern Woodlands date back as far as the Hopewell tradition from 1‚Äî400 CE. Bird motifs were common, ranging from the stylized heads of raptors to ducks.Dubin 157 Carved shells and incised animal teeth, especially bear teeth, have been popular for pendants. Historically, pearls are incorporated into necklace and bear teeth have been inlaid with pearls.Dubin 158 Seneca and other Iroquois carved small pendants with human faces, which were believed to be protective amulets, from bone, wood, and stone, including catlinite.Dubin 168 Iroquois artists have carved ornamental hair combs from antlers, often from moose, since 2000 BCE. The combs are topped with anthropomorphic or zoomorphic imagery. These became more elaborate after the introduction of metal knives from Europe in the late 16th and 17th centuries.Dubin 166-7 In the Northeast Woodlands and Great Lakes regions, rectangular gorgets have been carved from slate and other stones, dating back to the late archaic period.Bostrom, Peter A. \\"Two Hole Gorgets.\\" 31 May 2007 (retrieved 4 August 2011) Copper was worked in precontact times, but Europeans introduced silversmithing to the northeast in the mid-17th century. Today several Iroquois silversmiths are active. German silver is more popular among Great Lakes silversmiths.Dubin 185 Northwest Coast Haida silver bracelet featuring an American eagle, c. 1900, Seattle Art Museum In the past, walrus ivory was an important material for carving bracelets and other items. In the 1820s, a major argillite quarry was discovered on Haida Gwaii, and this stone proved easier to carve than ivory or bone and was adopted as a carving material.Shearar 16 Venetian glass seed beads were introduced in great numbers by Russian traders in the late 18th century, as part of the fur trade. Red and amber were the most popular colors, followed by blue. Historical Chinese coins with defenestrated section were strung as beads.Shearar 19 Copper, initially traded from tribes near the Coppermine River in the interior, was worked into jewelry even before European contact.Shearar 30 Later, silver and gold became popular materials for jewelry. Bracelets in particular are hammered and then carved with heraldic or mythic designs, and given away at potlatches. Northwest Coast jewelers increasingly use repouss√© techniques in metalworking.Shearar 24 Charles Edenshaw (Haida, 1839‚Äì1920) and Bill Reid (Haida, 1920‚Äì1998) were highly influential Northwest Coast jewelers. Dentalium shells have been traditional beads, used in necklaces, earrings, and other adornment. Kwakwaka'wakw and Nuu-chah-nulth people used to harvest the shell from the waters off Vancouver Island,Shearar 37 but that stock is depleted and today most dentalia are harvested from southeast Asia. Abalone shell provides beads and jewelry. High-ranking women traditionally wore large abalone shell earrings.Shearar 15 Today Haida and Tlingit basket weavers often create miniature red cedar (Thuja plicata), yellow cedar, and spruce root baskets to be worn as pendants or earrings. Southeastern Woodlands Young Seminole jeweler, SWAIA Winter Market, 2011 Contemporary Shell gorget carved by Bennie Pokemire (Eastern Band Cherokee) In the Mississippian culture of the Southeast, dating from 800 BCE to 1500 CE, clay, stone, and pearl beads were worn. Shell gorgets were incised with bold imagery from the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. These are still carved today by several Muscogee Creek, Chickasaw, and Cherokee jewelers. Long-nosed god maskettes were made from bone, copper and marine shells. These are small shield-shaped faces with squared-off foreheads, circular eyes, and large noses of various lengths. They are often shown on SECC representations of falcon impersonators as ear ornaments. Before Europeans brought glass beads to the southeast in the 16th century, pearls and Job's tears were popular materials for necklaces. Ear spools of stone, or sometimes wood overlaid with copper foil, were popular, and many have been found at Spiro Mounds from 1100 to 1400 CE.\\"Stone Ear Spools.\\" Oklahoma Archaeological Survey. (retrieved 23 April 2010) European contact introduced glass beads and silversmithing technology. Silver and brass armbands and gorgets became popular among Southeastern men in the 18th and 19th centuries. Sequoyah was an 18th/19th-century Cherokee silversmith. Until the 19th century, Choctaw men wore horsehair collars when playing stickball. Choctaw women's dance regalia incorporates ornamental silver combs and openwork beaded collars.Dubin 213 Caddo women wear hourglass-shaped hair ornaments, called dush-tohs when dancing.Dubin 217 Southwest Heishe necklaces have been made by several southwest tribes since ancient times. The word \\"heishe\\" comes from the Santo Domingo word for \\"shell.\\"Dubin 538 A single heishe is a rolled bead of shell, turquoise, or coral, which is cut very thin. Shells used for heishe included mother-of-pearl, spiny oyster, abalone, coral, conch and clam. Tiny, thin heishe was strung together by the Santo Domingo to create necklaces, which were important trade items.\\"Totems to Turquoise: Santo Domingo.\\" American Natural History Museum. (retrieved 12 July 2011) Silversmiths dominate the production of jewelry centered in the Four Corners region of the American Southwest. Early in the 1800s, Spanish and, later, Mexican, silver buttons, bridles, etc. became available in what is now Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and, Utah through acquisition and trade. Navajo (Din√©) artists began working silver in the 1850s after learning the art from Mexican smiths. The Zuni, who admired the silver jewelry made by Navajo smiths, traded livestock for instruction in working silver. By 1890, Zuni smiths had instructed the Hopi as well.Hewett, Edgar. Native Peoples of the American Southwest. 1968 The centuries-old art of lapidary, preserved by clan and family tradition, remains an important element of design. Stone on stone mosaic inlay, channel inlay, cluster work, petite point, needle point, and natural cut or smoothed and polished cabochons fashioned from shells, coral, semi-precious and precious gems commonly decorate these works of art with blue or green turquoise being the most common and recognizable material used. Apache Both Apache men and women have traditionally worn a variety of jewelry, including earrings and bracelets with strung beads of shell and turquoise. Many bracelets and other jewelry are made of silver with turquoise inlays, and rings have been made from brass or silver. Apache women historically wore a number of necklaces simultaneously, from chokers to strung beads of abalone and other shells, turquoise, jet, stones, glass beads, and certain seeds, such as mountain laurel seeds,Haley 104 and even plant roots. Necklaces often feature abalone shell pendants.\\"Tribal History: Jewelry.\\" Fort Still Apache: Chiricahua-Warm Springs Apache. (retrieved 12 July 2011) When trade beads became available from Europeans and European-Americas, Apache women began wearing several layers of string glass bead necklaces. Mirrors obtained from traders were also worn as pendants, or woven into vests and other clothing items. Apache jewelers use virtually any color, but do tend toward traditional favorite color combinations, including black and white, red and yellow, or pale blue and dark blue. The beadwork of Plains tribes influenced eastern Apaches tribes. Even today, young Apache girls wear necklaces with scratching sticks and drinking tubes during their puberty ceremonies.Dubin 512 San Carlos Apache jewelers are known for their use of peridot, a green gemstone, in silver bolo ties, necklaces, earrings, and other jewelry.\\"White Mountain Apache Indian Reservation.\\" Arizona Handbook.

At full magnification, note matting, characteristic minute, closely packed chisel strokes applied by the Hopi (and no one else) to the oxidized areas of the bottom silver sheet in overlay work. Sikyatata became the first Hopi silversmith in 1898. Hopi Indian silversmiths today are known for their overlay technique used in silver jewelry designs. The scarcity of silver kept the primary jewelry components used by the Hopi to shell and stone until the 1930s and 1940s, and very few Hopi knew how to work silver. In 1946, Willard Beatty, director of the Indian Education for the US Department of the Interior, saw an exhibit of Hopi art and was inspired to develop a silversmithing program for Hopi veterans of World War II. The veterans learned cutting, grinding and polishing, as well as die-stamping and sand-casting of stylized Hopi designs. The students then taught fellow tribesmen silversmithing, which they used to stylize traditional designs from the decorative patterns of old pottery and baskets. The Museum of Northern Arizona encouraged the early silversmiths to develop their own style, distinct from neighboring tribes. Victor Coochwytewa was one of the most innovative jewelers - one who is often credited with adapting the overlay technique to Hopi jewelry, along with Paul Saufkie and Fred Kabotie. The Hopi Silvercraft Cooperative Guild was organized by these early students.\\"Hopi Silverwork & Jewelry.\\" Northern Arizona Native American Cultural Trail. (retrieved 4 August 2011) Saufkie's son Lawrence continued making silver overlay jewelry for more than 60 years. Overlay involves two layers of silver sheets. One sheet has the design etched into it, and then is soldered onto the second sheet with cut out designs. The background is made darker through oxidation, and the top layer is polished where the bottom layer of silver is allowed to oxidize. The top un- oxidized top layer is made into a cutout design, which allows the dark bottom layer to show through. This technique is still in use today in silver jewelry. Hopi jeweler Charles Loloma (1921‚Äì1991) transformed mid-20th-century Native American jewelry by winning major awards with his work that incorporated new materials and techniques. Loloma was the first to use gold and to inlay multiple stones within a piece of jewelry, which completely changed the look of Hopi jewelry.Dubin 534‚Äì5 Navajo Navajo jeweler, Santa Fe\\"Fritz Casuse: Biography.\\" Towa Artists.

Early Navajo smiths rocker-engraved, stamped, and filed designs into plain silver, melted from coins, flatware, and ingots obtained from European-American traders. Later, sheet silver and wire acquired from American settlers were also made into jewelry. The punches and stamps used by Mexican leather workers became the first tools used to create these decorations. Still later, railroad spurs, broken files, iron scraps and, later, piston rods became handmade stamps in the hands of these skilled artisans.Dubin 484 As commercially-made stamps became available however, through contact with the larger American economy, they were also utilized. Several other traditional hand tools are employed, being relatively simple to construct. The bellows consists of a skin bag about a foot long, held open with wooden hoops. It is provided with a valve and a nozzle. A forge, crucibles, an anvil, and tongs are used during the melting process. Molds, the matrix and die, cold chisels, scissors, pliers, files, awls, and emery paper also come into play. A soldering setup, consisting of a blowpipe and a torch made of oil-soaked rags used with borax, is manipulated by the smith. The silversmith uses a grinding stone, sandstone dust, and ashes for polishing the jewelry, and a salt called almogen is used for whitening. Navajo jewelers began sand casting silver around 1875; silver was melted and then poured into a mold, which would be carved from sandstone. When cooled and set, the piece normally required additional filing and smoothing. Cast jewelry was also occasionally engraved. Sterling silver jewelry was soldered, and surrounded by scrolls, beads, and leaf patterns. Turquoise is closely associated with Navajo jewelry, but it was not until 1880 that the first turquoise was known to be set in silver. Turquoise became much more readily available in ensuing decades. Coral and other semi-precious stones came into common use around 1900. One of the most important forms of Navajo and Southwestern Native American jewelry, is the Squash Blossom Necklace. Most are made of a string of plain round silver beads, interspersed with more stylized \\"squash blossoms\\", and feature a pendant, or \\"naja\\", hung from the center of the strand. The squash blossom beads are copied from the buttons which held together the pants worn by the Spanish, and later, Mexican caballeros. These buttons represent - and are modeled after - pomegranates.Adair 44Bedinger 82-85Dubin 503 Their identification as \\"squash blossoms\\", which they closely resemble, is an understandable, and often repeated, error.\\"Squash Blossom Necklace.\\" Fernbank Museum of Natural History.

(retrieved 23 April 2010) Zuni Zuni jewelry-making dates back to Ancestral Pueblo prehistory. Early Zuni lapidaries used stone and antler tools, wooden drills with flake stone, or cactus spine drillbits, as well as abrading tools made of wood and stone, sand for smoothing, and fiber cords for stringing.Slaney, Deborah C. \\"The Evolution of Zuni Jewelry.\\" Southwest Art. 1 August 1998 (retrieved 4 August 2011) With the exception of silver jewelry, which was introduced to Zuni Pueblo in the 19th century, most of the materials commonly worked by Zuni jewelry makers in the 20th century have always been in use in the Zuni region. These include turquoise, jet, argillite, steatite, red shale, freshwater clam shell, abalone, and spiny oyster.Cirillo, Dexter. \\"Southwestern Indian Jewelry\\". Abbeville Press, 1992. Since pre-contact times, Zuni carve stone and shell fetishes, which they trade with other tribes and even non-Natives. Fetishes are carved from turquoise, amber, shell, or onyx. Today, Zuni bird fetishes are often set with heishe beads in multi-strand necklaces.Dubin 510-511 Lanyade became the first Zuni silversmith in 1872.Dubin 483 Kineshde, a Zuni smith of the late 1890s, is credited for first combining silver and turquoise in his jewelry.\\"History of Native American Turquoise Jewelry in the USA.\\"] 9 September 2007 (retrieved 4 August 2011) Zuni jewelers soon became known for their clusterwork. Following the Sitgreaves Expedition in 1854, Captain Lorenzo Sitgreaves illustrated a Zuni forge, which was still in use as late as the early part of the 20th century. The forge was made from adobe, with bellows handmade from animal skins. Silver was cast in sandstone molds, and finished by tooling - as opposed to engraving. Thin sheets of silver were cut with scissors and shears.Smith, Harlan I. \\"Primitive Work in Metal.\\" The Southern Workman. Hampton Institute. Vol. 40, Issue 12, 1911. Page 217. The establishment of the railroad, with the accompanying tourist trade and the advent of trading posts, heavily influenced Zuni and other Southwest tribes' jewelry manufacturing techniques and materials. In the early 20th century, trader C.G. Wallace influenced the direction of Zuni silver and lapidary work to appeal to a non-Native audience. Wallace was aided by the proliferation of the automobile and interstate highways such as Route 66 and I-40, and promotion of tourism in Gallup and Zuni. Wallace employed local Zuni people as clerks, jewelry makers, and miners. He provided tools, equipment, and silversmithing supplies to the jewelers with whom he did business. Wallace influenced Zuni art by encouraging the use of specific materials that sold well at his posts - such as coral - and discouraging others such as tortoise shell. Wallace provided large chunks of turquoise to Zuni artists, giving them the opportunity to carve figures in the round. Wallace also encouraged the increased production and improvement of small-stone techniques like needlepoint and petit point in the hope that these styles would thwart the production of machine-made jewelry. He also urged jewelers to experiment with silver construction to satisfy his customers' preferences for lightweight jewelry.

Born in Little Hulton, he began his career playing amateur football with nearby club Walkden PM. During this time, Bate had a trial with Football League club Bury but this was unsuccessful and he instead transferred to Little Hulton United. Following a trial with Winsford United in August 1929, Bate joined Lancashire Combination outfit Chorley in October of the same year. He was signed on professional terms in the summer of 1930 by Football League Third Division North club Nelson. Bate made his League debut on 30 August 1930 and scored a hat-trick, yet still finished on the losing side in a 4‚Äì5 defeat to Rochdale. He then scored two goals in the 3‚Äì1 victory over Darlington on 6 September 1930. It was then almost two months before he got on the scoresheet again, his sixth goal for Nelson coming in the 1‚Äì7 loss away at Tranmere Rovers on 1 November 1930. After suffering a loss of form, Bate was left out of the team for two months in mid-season, before playing a nine games in an unfamiliar outside-right position throughout February and March 1931. After three matches out of the team, he was reinstated as centre-forward for the trip to Barrow on 11 April 1931. He kept his place in the side for the next three matches, Nelson's final games in the Football League. After a total of 24 appearances and six goals, Bate left Nelson following their failed re- election to the League. In January 1932, Bate rejoined his former club Chorley and played for them until the end of the 1931‚Äì32 season, when he left to join Lancashire Combination rivals Bacup Borough. In his first campaign with Bacup, the team struggled in the league, finishing 19th out of 20 teams. Bate continued to play for Bacup Borough through the 1933‚Äì34 season, but left in September 1934 to join Fleetwood.

Early life He was born in Kilmichael in County Cork, Ireland on 14 July 1858. After graduating at St Patrick's College, Maynooth, Cohalan was ordained a priest at the Cathedral of St Mary and St Anne, Cork on 25 July 1882. His first pastoral appointment was a curate at Kilbrittain, County Cork from October 1883 to January 1884. He briefly resumed his post-graduate studies at St Finbarr's Seminary (now College), Cork from January to November 1884. His second curacy was at Tracton, County Cork from November 1884 to September 1896. Cohalan returned to St. Patrick's College, Maynooth as a professor of Theology from 7 September 1896 to 7 June 1914. Episcopal career He was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Cork and Titular Bishop of Vaga on 25 May 1914. Cohalan was consecrated bishop at St Mary and St Anne's Cathedral on 7 June 1914 by John Harty, Archbishop of Cashel-Emly. Two years later, he was appointed Diocesan Bishop of Cork on 29 August 1916. Cohalan was an outspoken critic during the Irish War of Independence, condemning acts of violence on both sides. In particular, he denounced the policy of reprisals. In July 1920, he pronounced an interdict on the killers of an RIC sergeant, shot dead in the church porch in Bandon. He declared that anyone killing from ambush would be excommunicated. On 12 December 1920, Cohalan, issued a decree saying that \\"anyone within the diocese of Cork who organises or takes part in ambushes or murder or attempted murder shall be excommunicated\\".[47] In turn, his life was threatened by the IRA. In August 1928, he condemned the British government which had allowed Terence McSwiney to die on hunger-strike in 1920.A Dictionary of Irish History, D.J.Hickey & J.E.Doherty, Gill and Macmillan, Dublin, 1980. Pp. page 81. He died in office at Bon Secours Hospital, Cork on 24 August 1952, aged 94 years old. A story, current at the time in Cork, referred to his antipathy towards bishops of the Church of Ireland who styled themselves \\"Bishop of Cork\\". A month before his death, and on his death-bed, word was brought to him of the death of the Church of Ireland Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross, Robert Hearn. The response of Dr Cohalan, known \\"affectionately\\" as \\"Danny Boy\\", was, reputedly, \\"now he knows who's Bishop of Cork\\". Originally buried at St Finbarr's College, Farranferris, he was reinterred in the grounds of St Mary and St Anne's Cathedral, Cork in 1996. His nephew of the same name, Daniel Cohalan, was Bishop of Waterford and Lismore from 1943 to 1965.

S√∏lvguttene (\\"The Silver Boys\\") is a boys' choir founded by Torstein Grythe in June, 1940. He would hold the position as conductor until 2004, when Fredrik Otterstad took over.Eldri Espedal Storhaug: S√∏lvguttene kom med julefred Aftenbladet, December 12, 2008 In 2019, Frikk Heide-Steen was hired as full-time conductor alongside Otterstad. The choir had its first rehearsals in Grythes apartment in Oslo, but were soon offered to rehearse in Norwegian Broadcasting‚Äôs (NRK) facilities. The thought was that the choir would be permanently linked to NRK, and the first radio performance was held in December 1940. Conditions during the German occupation soon made it impossible to continue the cooperation with NRK, and the choir was for the remainder of the war years managed by the founder/conductor. S√∏lvguttene got its name primarily because of the shiny, silvery uniforms that were acquired in the beginning (for lack of other, more subtle materials). Later the name has been attributed to the special sound and clarity of boys voices, voices of silver. Overview S√∏lvguttene (Norwegian Broadcasting Boys‚Äô Choir) comprises about 90 boys and 30 adult male singers, all of whom have previously been boy singers. Additionally, 25 boys aged 7 to 9 are training to be qualified for the concert choir. The choir will normally comprise around 60 singers on international tours, and regular concerts. The choir has become an extremely popular institution in Norway with its many performances on radio and television, in addition to concerts all over the country. In particular the program \\"S√∏lvguttene synger julen inn\\", which is broadcast every Christmas Eve, has been a major success. In addition, the choir has toured all over Europe and also the USA and the former Soviet Union on several occasions. The choir is known internationally because of its emphasis on sound rather than on technical perfection. The choir has often been engaged to perform at official events, such as the closing ceremony of the Lillehammer Olympic Games and the baptism of the Norwegian Princess Ingrid Alexandra. S√∏lvguttene has been invited to and performed in some of the most spectacular churches and concerts halls in Europe, among them Westminster Abbey in London, St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and the Berliner Dom. They have also performed with internationally recognized musicians such as Kiri Te Kanawa, Andrea Bocelli and Ole Edvard Antonsen. Repertoire The choir has a varied repertoire, although the focus has been on classical church coral music and traditional Norwegian folk music. The choir regularly performs classical masterpieces like Brahms' German Requiem and Mozart's Requiem, as well as serving as youth choir for the Oslo Philharmonic.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 14, 2010. In the episode, Tom Cruise and all other celebrities who have been mocked by residents of South Park in the past plan to file a class action lawsuit against the town, but Cruise promises to end the lawsuit if the town can get the Islamic prophet Muhammad to meet him. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. To celebrate their landmark episode, Parker and fellow series co-creator Matt Stone combined many of South Parks past storylines and controversies. The Muhammad subplot, similar to the one previously featured in the season 10 episode \\"Cartoon Wars\\", refers to Comedy Central's past refusal to allow images of Muhammad to be shown on the network in response to the riots and threats generated from controversial cartoons in 2005 and 2007 of Muhammad in European newspapers. \\"200\\" includes many celebrities that have been mocked in previous episodes, including Cruise, Rob Reiner, Steven Spielberg, Kanye West, Paris Hilton, George Lucas, Mel Gibson and Barbra Streisand. An additional subplot includes Cartman learning he may not know the true identity of his father. The 1998 season 2 episode \\"Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut\\" claimed that Cartman's hermaphrodite mother is his father, but the events of \\"200\\" and the subsequent episode reveal that this is not the case. \\"200\\" received mostly positive reviews. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by 3.33 million viewers, making it the most watched cable television program of the night. Both \\"200\\" and the sequel episode \\"201\\" were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program in 2010. Within a week of the episode's original broadcast date, the website for the radical Muslim organization Revolution Muslim posted an entry warning Parker and Stone that they risked being murdered for airing the episode, which several media outlets and observers interpreted as a threat. As a result, Comedy Central heavily censored portions of \\"201\\" by removing references to Muhammad and the episode's closing speech. The episode was rated TV-MA L in the United States. Plot While on a school field trip to a candy factory, Butters spots actor Tom Cruise working there, packing fudge into boxes. Stan, who previously told Cruise that his acting is not as good as others' in \\"Trapped in the Closet\\", accidentally insults him again by calling him a \\"fudge packer\\", as Cruise claims to be fly fishing. Cruise then recruits 200 other celebrities who have been ridiculed by the town of South Park to bring a class action lawsuit against the town. Stan returns to the factory with his father Randy to try to apologize and convince Cruise to drop the suit, but also finds it difficult not to call him a fudge packer as well since he was literally packing fudge while they spoke. An angry Cruise agrees to do so, but only if they can help Cruise meet Muhammad. This causes an uproar because depictions of Muhammad are forbidden, and the townsfolk fear that forcing Muhammad to appear in public will drive Muslim radicals to bomb the town. Stan and Kyle go to the Super Best Friends, a squad of superhero- like religious figures (Jesus Christ, Gautama Buddha, Moses, Krishna, Laozi, Joseph Smith and \\"Seaman\\") of which Muhammad is a member, to request he return with them to South Park. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Cruise and the other celebrities only want Muhammad for his \\"goo\\", as Rob Reiner, previously shown to be filled with \\"goo\\" in \\"Butt Out\\", has invented a machine to transfer Muhammad's \\"goo\\" to the celebrities, which they believe will make them immune to ridicule, just like Muhammad. By this time, Cartman arrives with \\"Mitch Conner\\", a face painted on his hand as one-half of a ventriloquist act. Previously, Connor had successfully impersonated actress Jennifer Lopez in \\"Fat Butt and Pancake Head\\", and now Cartman and Connor return to the Lopez imitation in order to get involved in the lawsuit along with the other celebrities. Connor soon secretly convinces Cartman that they should steal Muhammad's goo for themselves to sell on the black market for more than the lawsuit could offer. Meanwhile, Kyle and Stan convince the Super Best Friends to let Muhammad come to town, but only if he stays in the back of a U-Haul truck and is not seen. When the townspeople realize they must bring Muhammad to Cruise's limo, they allegedly put him inside a bear mascot outfit. South Park is about to give Muhammad to the celebrities when the exchange is interrupted by a bomb planted by the Ginger Kids, a group of fair-skinned, red-haired children who are tired of being made fun of for their physical appearance. The Gingers want Muhammad for themselves, hoping to use his goo for their own means. They threaten to blow up the town if Muhammad is not turned over to them. The people of South Park decide to turn Muhammad over to the Gingers, fearing the violence that will befall their town if they do not. The celebrities are angered by this change in events, but refuse to resort to violence for fear of ruining their careers. Instead, the celebrities decide to awaken the rebuilt Mecha-Streisand, a giant mechanical monster form of Barbra Streisand, who previously terrorized the town of South Park before being destroyed. The celebrities hope to use Mecha-Streisand to force South Park to accept their demands. Meanwhile, due to the chain of events, Cartman decides Connor's scheme has become too complicated and tries to quit, but Connor convinces him to stay involved by revealing that the townspeople of South Park have lied to Cartman about his true father. Although they previously claimed his hermaphroditic mother was his father, Connor insists this is a lie. Cartman confronts his school teacher Mr. Garrison and Garrison's old hand puppet Mr. Hat, who admits to Cartman there was indeed a cover-up. Mecha- Streisand roars threateningly and continues her reign of destruction as the episode ends on a cliffhanger, setting the stage for 201. Production Written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, \\"200\\" was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 14, 2010. It was the 200th episode of the series. Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone conceive, write and produce most South Park episodes within a week of their broadcast date in order to maintain a sense of energy and timeliness. The idea for \\"200\\", however, was conceived before the fourteenth season began in March 2010, and before any of the season fourteen episodes that preceded it were conceived. While trying to decide how to celebrate the 200th episode, Parker and Stone started reviewing the plots and controversies of previous episodes, many of which had a common thread of mocking a particular celebrity. This led to the idea of the having all the celebrities band together in a class action lawsuit against the town. Parker said their reactions mirrored the real-life reactions some of the celebrities had to their portrayals, adding, \\"If they could join forces, they probably would.\\" Stone said in writing the episode, they were determined not to produce a clip show, but to merge all of the old ideas into a new, original script. The process proved challenging for the duo because it involved incorporating many ideas, subplots and characters into a single episode. Parker and Stone included a joke about this process at the start of the episode, when Cartman and Kyle are fighting with each other, and Stan accuses them of just \\"rehashing a bunch of old stuff\\". In honor of the 200th episode, the website SouthPark200.com was launched, offering a forum to fans to post their congratulations to South Park and view those posted by others. Various people have contributed to the site, including the creators of the animated series The Simpsons (who used the opportunity to revisit another previous South Park theme, the episode \\"Simpsons Already Did It\\", saying \\"We already [produced 200 episodes]. Twice.\\" ), members of the rock band Rush and Denver Nuggets basketball player Chauncey Billups. The site also includes congratulations from All in the Family creator Norman Lear, who guest-starred in the 100th episode \\"I'm a Little Bit Country\\", and figure skater Brian Boitano, who was featured in the song \\"What Would Brian Boitano Do?\\" in the 1999 film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. Theme=Muhammad subplot An image of the Muslim prophet Muhammad was shown in the 2001 episode \\"Super Best Friends\\", but was later banned from the 2006 episode \\"Cartoon Wars\\" due to controversies regarding Muhammad cartoons in European newspapers. This contradiction is mocked in \\"200\\". In 2010, the episode which relates to this picture was removed by South Park Studios and is no longer available for viewing. \\"200\\" features jokes and references to past South Park episodes, storylines, characters and controversies. The episode revolves heavily around efforts to bring Muhammad into public view. This is based on two past controversies in 2005 (Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy) and 2007 (Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy), when European newspapers published cartoons of Muhammad, which was responded to with reactions of violent riots, global protests and death threats toward the artists. As a result of those incidents, many publications and television studios have refused to broadcast images of Muhammad whatsoever, which was the inspiration behind Tom Cruise's efforts to harvest Muhammad's apparent immunity to satire and ridicule. Parker and Stone addressed the Muhammad issue in their two-part tenth season episode \\"Cartoon Wars\\", during which they attempt to show an image of the prophet, only to reveal that Comedy Central has forbidden any such image from being broadcast on their network. However, Muhammad had already been featured on-screen in the fifth season episode \\"Super Best Friends\\", in which he is among a band of religious figures modeled after the superheroes in the Super Friends cartoons from the 1970s and 1980s. (The Super Best Friends are featured once again in \\"200\\".) The episode \\"Super Best Friends\\" aired in 2001, before the Jyllands- Posten and Vilks controversies. Stan makes reference to that past use of Muhammad's image in \\"200\\" by saying of Muhammad, \\"I saw him once...a while ago...\\" This reference was purposely included to reflect the irony that an image that was previously not a problem had suddenly become an issue due to new circumstances. Stone said, \\"Something that was OK is now not OK, and that's just fucked up.\\" The \\"Super Best Friends\\" episode continues to be run uncensored by Comedy Central in repeats, even though new images of Muhammad remained prohibited. Additionally, Muhammad has long been featured as one of the many characters shown in an image of dozens of South Park residents during the show's opening credits. That image, however, has gone largely unnoticed, and thus has not drawn much controversy. When asked whether they feared retribution for mocking Muhammad, Parker said, \\"We'd be so hypocritical against our own thoughts, if we said, 'Okay, well let's not make fun of them because they might hurt us. Okay, we'll rip on the Catholics because they won't hurt us, but we won't rip on [Muslims] because they might hurt us.'\\" The Muhammad subplot in \\"200\\", like the \\"Cartoon Wars\\" episodes, advocates for free speech and speaks out against censorship, both of Muhammad's image and any subject considered taboo. \\"200\\" also demonstrates the double standard in the handling of offensive images of Muhammad and other religious figures, particularly in the scene in which Muhammad is censored altogether, but Buddhism founder Gautama Buddha is shown snorting cocaine in front of the South Park children. The extreme measures the South Park boys go to in order to conceal Muhammad, like hiding him in a window-less truck and dressing him as a mascot, demonstrate the absurdity of the fear in showing the prophet, as does the fear of retaliation that the South Park residents show after Randy draws a stick figure-like drawing of him, which is not censored. Celebrities Actor Tom Cruise (pictured), who was previously parodied in the South Park episode \\"Trapped in the Closet\\", is mocked more than most of the other celebrities in \\"200\\" \\"200\\" includes many celebrities that have been mocked in previous episodes. One of the most prominently parodied is Tom Cruise, who was the center of the ninth season episode \\"Trapped in the Closet\\". Cruise spent much of that episode hiding in a closet, a reference to rumors about his sexuality. In \\"200\\", he is found working in a fudge factory as a \\"fudge packer\\", a reference to alleged homosexuality. The episode also reveals Cruise's house consists mostly of closets, a reference to both homosexuality and the original episode in which Cruise was mocked. Since Saddam Hussein is a dangerous celebrity, he does not appear in this episode. Other celebrities mocked in \\"200\\" include: * Actor Ben Affleck (\\"How to Eat with Your Butt\\", \\"Fat Butt and Pancake Head\\") * Film director Michael Bay (\\"Imaginationland Episode I\\", Cartmanland) * Pope Benedict XVI (\\"Bloody Mary\\", \\"Fantastic Easter Special\\") * al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden (\\"Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants\\") * Magician David Blaine (\\"Super Best Friends\\") * U2 vocalist Bono (\\"More Crap\\") * Singer/songwriter Jimmy Buffett (\\"Tonsil Trouble\\") * Politician Hillary Clinton (\\"The Snuke\\") * Lawyer Johnnie Cochran (\\"Chef Aid\\") * Singer/songwriter Phil Collins (\\"Timmy 2000\\") * Politician Gary Condit (\\"Butters' Very Own Episode\\") * Comedian Bill Cosby (\\"Trapper Keeper\\", \\"Here Comes the Neighborhood\\", \\"Clubhouses\\")Clubhouses (Season 2, Episode 12) ‚Äì Full Episode Player ‚Äì South Park Studios * Actor Russell Crowe (\\"The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer\\") * Actor Michael Douglas (\\"Sexual Healing\\") * Actor David Duchovny (\\"Sexual Healing\\") * Subway spokesman Jared Fogle (\\"Jared Has Aides\\") * Film character Indiana Jones (\\"The China Probrem\\") * Actor Mel Gibson (\\"The Passion of the Jew, Imaginationland\\") * Television host Kathie Lee Gifford (\\"Weight Gain 4000\\") * Socialite Paris Hilton (\\"Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset\\") * Wildlife expert Steve Irwin (\\"Hell on Earth 2006\\", \\"Prehistoric Ice Man\\") * Politician Jesse Jackson (\\"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\\") * Singer Michael Jackson (\\"Dead Celebrities, The Jeffersons\\") * Actress Angelina Jolie (\\"Lice Capades\\") * Talk show host David Letterman (\\"Sexual Healing\\") * Film director George Lucas (\\"Free Hat\\", \\"The China Probrem\\") * Actress Liza Minnelli (\\"Freak Strike\\") * Disney mascot Mickey Mouse (\\"The Ring\\") * Actress and television host Rosie O'Donnell (\\"Trapper Keeper\\") * Singer and activist Yoko Ono (\\"World Wide Recorder Concert\\") * Actress Sarah Jessica Parker (\\"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs\\") * Actor and film director Robert Redford (\\"Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls\\") * Film director Rob Reiner (\\"Butt Out\\") * Actor Michael Richards (\\"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\\") * Actress Winona Ryder (South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut) * Actor and television host Bob Saget (\\"Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut\\") * Actor Fred Savage (\\"Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls\\") * Actor Charlie Sheen (\\"Sexual Healing\\") * Actress Brooke Shields (South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut) * Film director M.

This is a reference to Streisand's appearance in the first-season episode \\"Mecha-Streisand\\", in which she transforms into a monster in the style of Mechagodzilla from the Godzilla franchise. The Mecha-Streisand featured in \\"200\\" is designed with more sophisticated computer imagery than the original, which was a simple cut-out style cartoon like the rest of South Park. Although Parker and Stone have maintained that most of the celebrities they mock in South Park are chosen at random, with no personal animosity behind it, Barbra Streisand is one of the few they actively and vehemently dislike. Streisand, in turn, has been critical of South Park and her portrayal in it, and has accused the show of adding \\"to the cynicism and negativity in our culture, especially in children\\". Cartman's father The episode ends with a cliffhanger involving Cartman's father. The identity of Cartman's father made up a major plot point at the end of the first season, culminating in the second season episode \\"Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut\\", in which it is revealed Cartman's mother, Liane Cartman, is a hermaphrodite and, in fact, is Cartman's father. \\"200\\" is the first episode to return to the matter and suggest this was not the actual truth. Throughout the episode, Cartman uses a hand-puppet con-artist named Mitch Conner, who had, presumably, just been made up by Cartman in trying to fool Kyle in the seventh-season episode \\"Fat Butt and Pancake Head\\", resuming his role in pretending to be Jennifer Lopez and utilizing many offensive Hispanic stereotypes in his portrayal of her. The hand puppet portrayal is very similar to the work of Spanish ventriloquist Se√±or Wences. Several other references to previous South Park episodes are featured throughout \\"200\\". It marks the reappearance of Mr. Hat, a hand puppet that had been frequently used by Mr. Garrison during the early South Park seasons, but had long been abandoned in later episodes. During the second half of \\"200\\", an army of red-haired \\"ginger kids\\" attempt to capture Muhammad themselves. Several South Park episodes, most prominently the ninth-season episode \\"Ginger Kids\\", have featured the ginger kids, which are children with fair skin, freckles and red hair. In most cases, they have been made the subject of ridicule by Cartman, who views them in an offensively stereotypical way. Cultural references During one scene, a frustrated Tom Cruise angrily jumps up and down on a couch while Oprah Winfrey sits next to him. This is a reference to an incident on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005, in which Cruise repeatedly jumped on the couch next to Oprah, fell to one knee and loudly professed his love for actress Katie Holmes. Cruise has been repeatedly mocked for his behavior. In another scene, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are shown to have actor Harrison Ford leashed, chained and ball-gagged, as the actor wears the fedora he wore in the Indiana Jones films. This is a reference to the twelfth season episode \\"The China Probrem\\", in which Lucas and Spielberg literally rape Indiana Jones repeatedly, which served as a commentary by Parker and Stone for the poor quality of the 2008 Spielberg/Lucas film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. A cartoon image of film director Tim Burton is featured in the episode, despite having not been previously ridiculed by the show. In the episode, Burton is mocked for not having an original idea since the 1988 comedy horror film Beetlejuice, and for his tendency to feature film actor Johnny Depp in so many of his films that he should \\"just have sex with him [Johnny Depp] already\\". Cartman's Jennifer Lopez hand-puppet repeatedly demands food from the American restaurant chain Taco Bell, particularly enchiritos, which is one of the many Hispanic stereotypes utilized by the character. Also, when the celebrities are discussing whom to bring in to help capture Mohammed, Barbra Streisand is referenced as \\"her,\\" to which the discussion goes \\"her who?\\" \\"her\\" \\"oh...her.\\" This is slightly reminiscent of the movie Little Shop of Horrors when Rick Moranis and Steve Martin are talking about Audrey, who the dentist had physically abused, where Steve asks \\"what did I ever do to you\\" and Rick answers \\"it wasn't what you did to me, it was what you did to her\\" Steve: \\"her? oh...her\\" Reception=Ratings In its original American broadcast on April 14, 2010, \\"200\\" was watched by 3.33 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, making it the most watched cable television show of the night. It outperformed the previous week's episode, \\"You Have 0 Friends\\", which was seen by 3.07 million viewers, and it was seen by roughly 177,000 more viewers than its closest competitor on April 14, USA Network's In Plain Sight. The episode received an overall 2.0 rating/3 share, meaning that it was seen by 2% of the population, and 3% of people watching television at the time of the broadcast. Among viewers between ages 18 and 49, it received a 1.9 rating/5 share, and among male viewers between 18 and 34, it received a 3.7 rating/13 share. Reviews The episode received mostly positive reviews. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said he was surprised by the complexity of \\"200\\" and the amount of South Park references and subplots it encompassed, especially the questions over Cartman's father. Tucker praised the episode, and said, \\"With jokes raining down like hell-fire, the 200th episode spared no one except the South Park kids themselves.\\" Ramsey Isler of IGN said it was fun to identify all the references to past South Park moments, but felt \\"200\\" itself didn't stand out as a great episode. Isler said the new material wasn't very funny, and that the rehashed material was not as funny as the first time they were shown, which was disappointing due to the hype surrounding the episode. The A.V. Club writer Sean O'Neal said the episode was funny, but that the original material was far outnumbered by rehashed jokes. O'Neal said the use of all the celebrities demonstrated how South Park had been more original in early episodes, but now had \\"morph[ed] into something whose default mode is mocking famous people in the news\\". Douglas Murray of The Daily Telegraph said of the episode, \\"I can't recommend it enough\\", and particularly complimented the episode scenes with Buddha snorting cocaine and the South Park townspeople hiding Muhammad. Murray said, \\"They make the point about the absurd self-censorship and thuggish intimidation surrounding the Islamic faith better than anything else I've seen.\\" Amy Duncan of Metro said it \\"certainly was an episode to remember\\". Duncan praised the story, which she said \\"develops with [South Park] usual rude inferences and below-the-belt remarks\\". Ryan Broderick of The Hofstra Chronicle said the episode \\"came together so simply, so smoothly, and so hilariously that it forgives the last couple lame duck episodes of the season\\". Broderick said it avoided the pitfalls of most landmark episodes by providing an original story in addition to the throwback references. Nick Zaino of TV Squad said the episode did not offer much new, but also offer good throwbacks and celebrity spoofs, and didn't \\"pull any punches\\". Zaino said the episode has \\"a wonderful sense of the absurd\\", particularly through the use of Mecha-Streisand and Cartman's hand-puppet. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Washington, D.C.-based civil rights and advocacy group, said they were aware of the depiction of Muhammad in \\"200\\", but declined to put out a formal statement about it because they did not want to draw any more attention to the show. The group's spokesman, Ibrahim Hooper, said, \\"People are pretty tired of this whole 'Let's insult the prophet Muhammad thing.'\\" Revolution Muslim entry The website for the organization Revolution Muslim, a New York-based organization, posted an entry that included a warning to creators Parker and Stone that they risk retribution for their depictions of Muhammad. It said that they would \\"probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show.\\" Filmmaker Theo van Gogh was murdered by an Islamist in 2004 for making a short documentary on the violence against women in some Islamic societies. The posting provided the addresses to Comedy Central in New York and the production company in Los Angeles. The author of the post, Zachary Adam Chesser (who preferred to be called Abu Talhah al Amrikee), said it was meant to serve as a warning to Parker and Stone, not a threat, and that providing the addresses was meant to give people the opportunity to protest. The entry included audio clips of a sermon by al-Qaeda imam Anwar al-Awlaki, calling for the assassination of anyone who has defamed Muhammad, saying, \\"Harming Allah and his messenger is a reason to encourage Muslims to kill whoever does that.\\" It also included a link to a 2009 Huffington Post article that gave details of Stone and Parker's mansion in Colorado, and images of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, an activist writer and critic of Islam, who lives in permanent security protection because of threats. Comedy Central declined to comment on the post. Before writing the Revolution Muslim post, Chesser wrote an April 15 entry on his Twitter page: \\"May Allah kill Matt Stone and Trey Parker and burn them in Hell for all eternity. They insult our prophets Muhammad, Jesus, and Moses.\\" Chesser was subsequently sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment for this and other offenses. Despite Chesser's statements that the website entry was a warning, several media outlets and observers interpreted it as a threat. Ayaan Hirsi Ali dismissed claims that the website entry was just a warning, calling it \\"an assault on the freedom of expression\\" that should not be marginalized or overlooked. She said of the episode, \\"The 'South Park' episode of last weekend was not just funny, and it wasn't just witty. [It] addressed an essential piece in the times that we are living. There is one group of people, one religion[,] that is claiming to be above criticism.\\" New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said he was aware of the website posting, but said, \\"We don't think that this threat, as [it] is currently assessed, rises to a crime right now.\\" CNN journalist Anderson Cooper said of the episode, \\"You might not like South Park the cartoon. You might think it's offensive. [But] the notion that some radical Islamic group in America would make a threat, even a veiled one, against two men's lives because of it is chilling.\\" Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly said he would have advised Parker and Stone not to do the episode out of fear of retaliation: \\"On the one hand you do have to admire their courage. But I don't know whether the risk‚Äìreward [ratio] is worth it.\\" The Daily Telegraph writer Douglas Murray said the entry only gave \\"200\\" more legitimacy, writing, \\"[It] of course just confirms the point that the South Park boys were making. [...] I'd have said that was point proved. South Park 1: Islamists 0.\\" In an episode of Comedy Central's The Daily Show aired on April 22, 2010, host Jon Stewart went into a ten-minute tirade about the alleged death threats, expressing disgust at the alleged hypocrisy of Revolution Muslim's speech while its members enjoy the American lifestyle and freedom of speech. In response to the Revolution Muslim post, the South Park episode \\"201\\", which aired the following week and concluded the unresolved storylines from \\"200\\", was heavily censored by Comedy Central. The channel inserted audio bleeps over all references to Muhammad's name and other portions of dialogue, including the entirety of the ending speech by the show's main characters. The Dutch version of Comedy Central began airing commercials for \\"200\\" during the week of April 26, with the show scheduled to air on April 30. However, \\"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs\\" was shown instead. When asked about this, a spokesperson for Comedy Central Netherlands said they had reluctantly decided the episode to be pulled, along with the episode \\"201\\". Neither episode is available on the Dutch South Park Studios website; the same applies to the German website as of May 9, 2010. The Swedish affiliate of Comedy Central also refused to broadcast \\"200\\" and \\"201\\" in Sweden: > Comedy Central has decided not to air these two episodes of South Park. It > is a decision we've made with great reluctance. Comedy Central believes > strongly in creative freedom of expression; when unique and deeply > insightful creative talents like those behind South Park are able to express > themselves freely, we all benefit. However, the safety of our employees is > our unquestioned number[-]one priority, and therefore we have decided to > take these precautionary measures. Possible link to Times Square car bomb attempt On May 1, 18 days after the episode's original airdate, a failed car bomb attempt was discovered by the New York City Police Department near the eastern corner of 1 Astor Plaza in New York City, on West 45 Street, on a side street near the location of the world headquarters of Viacom, Comedy Central's parent company. Some news outlets reported that police are looking into a possible link between the attempted bombing and the warnings of violence against Trey Parker and Matt Stone, although no such link has yet been established. Such speculation was also fueled by statements from U.S. Congressman Peter T. King, who described as one possible motive \\"the whole issue with 'South Park,' which Islamic terrorists were threatening to have retribution for.\\" However, King stressed the theory was \\"one possibility out of a hundred\\". Revolution Muslim has denied any involvement with the incident. Younus Abdullah Muhammed, who runs the group's website, was in Times Square at the time speaking out against President Barack Obama with a loudspeaker. But he said of the failed car bomb, \\"What do you think, I commanded somebody to blow up a building in the middle of Times Square? [...] It had nothing to do with the 'South Park' controversy. It was not an attack targeting Viacom.\\" NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly said of the theory, \\"We certainly wouldn't rule that out.\\" However, media reports indicated Faisal Shahzad, the suspect arrested in connection with the attempted bombing, had trained for months prior to the first broadcast of \\"200.\\" Sri Lanka ban The depiction of Buddha snorting cocaine in \\"200\\" and \\"201\\", prompted the government of Sri Lanka to ban the entire series outright. Digital censorship The day after the episode aired, the episode was available for streaming on the site. After a week, like the other Muhammad episodes, it was taken off. The message presented to the user for this episode is \\"We apologize that South Park Studios cannot stream this episode.\\"200 South Park Studios Full Episode Player, Season 14 Episode 5. The sequel episode, \\"201\\", also has not been made available for streaming, but a different message describes an intent to potentially post that episode. Similarly the episode and its sequel are not available to stream or buy on services Netflix, iTunes, Hulu, or Amazon Prime Video. Furthermore, digital copies of these episodes that were purchased prior to their ban from digital distribution are no longer available for streaming or download. When the series was transferred to HBO Max in 2020, it was announced that \\"200\\" and \\"201\\" would be 2 of 5 episodes cut from the series, alongside \\"Super Best Friends\\", \\"Cartoon Wars Part I\\", and \\"Cartoon Wars Part II\\". The latter two episodes were not previously censored from digital streaming services. Home release Although \\"200\\" was not currently available on the internet legally, and had not re-aired since April 2010, it was confirmed on February 11, 2011 that \\"200\\" will be released on DVD. \\"200\\" along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park fourteenth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on April 26, 2011. The version presented on the DVD and Blu-ray is the uncensored version, with Muhammad's name unbleeped, unlike the episode that follows, \\"201\\", which is presented on disc in its original network censored version. During the commentary in both \\"200\\" and \\"201\\" Parker and Stone never mention Muhammad directly, referring to him only as \\"the prophet of the Muslim faith\\". Despite the package claiming otherwise, both \\"200\\" and \\"201\\" were completely omitted from the Region 4 and Region 2 releases.

Born at an unknown date in Bois-le-Duc (now 's-Hertogenbosch, capital of North Brabant in the Netherlands), he is known for his work in Spain in the last years of his life.A. Moreno Mendoza, E. Pareja L√≥pez, M.J. Sanz Serrano, and E. Valdivieso, Museo de Bellas Artes de Sevilla, Ed. Galve, Seville 1993. . Chiclana (province of C√°diz, Spain. Life Balduque was married to a woman known as Isabel de Balduq; with a son, they settled in Seville in 1534. He is documented in 1554 as a carver and sculptor (\\"entallador e imaxinero\\") who has brought new Italian and Flemish concepts to Seville. His presumed relatives Juan Mateo, Pedro, Diego, and Andr√©s Bolduque had a sculptural studio on Medina de Rioseco (province of Valladolid), where they executed various projects for churches in and around Valladolid and Palencia. Beginning in December 1554, Balduque began an important series of sculptures and altarpieces for parish churches in Seville, which accommodated two kinds of Marian images, ranging in style from Nordic primitivism to Flemish Mannerism. In Seville, he settled in the working-class neighborhood of La Magdalena. After his death in February 1561, his widow entrusted his uncompleted projects to the Flemish sculptor Juan Giralte. Known and attributed works Balduque collaborated on the main altarpiece of the Cathedral of Seville and, after that, the main altarpiece of the Church of Saint John the Baptist in Chiclana. In 1554 he contracted for the sacramental altarpiece of the Parish Church of Santa Mar√≠a la Coronada in Medina Sidonia (Province of C√°diz). Five reliefs on the upper level of the altarpiece are his originals, as is the Calvary at the top, which his will mentions had been completed.J. Porres Benavides and B.

Calvary, upper portion of the Renaissance altarpiece of Santa Mar√≠a La Mayor La Coronada, Medina Sidonia. His most notable mannerist works are Nuestra Se√±ora Reina de Todos los Santos (\\"Our Lady, Queen of All the Saints\\") and Nuestra Se√±ora del Amparo (\\"Our Lady of Amparo\\"). The former is the patroness of the La Feria neighborhood of Seville, and presides over the basilical baldachin of the Parish of Omnium Sanctorum. Balduque sculpted in 1554 and sold it to the penitential confraternity of the same name, the Hermandad de Nuestra Se√±ora Reina de Todos los Santos, for 23 ducats. The latter resides in the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene in Seville, and is associated with a penitential confraternity of the same name, the Hermandad de Nuestra Se√±ora del Amparo. It is one of the few processional sculptures that have a variety of garments: there is one each in red, green, sky blue, and salmon pink. It is also one of the few such sculptures associated both with a confraternity and with a parish. Between 1554 and 1556, Balduque also made sculptures and altarpieces for the Sevillian parishes of San Lorenzo, San Rom√°n, Santa Marina, San Gil, San Nicol√°s, San Vicente and San Juan de la Palma. Also in Seville are several other processional sculptures of his, all of the Virgin Mary, among them the Virgen de la Granada in the parish of San Lorenzo and the Virgen de la Rosa in the parish of San Vicente.

This function is known as the von Neumann‚ÄìMorgenstern utility function. The theorem is the basis for expected utility theory. In 1947, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern proved that any individual whose preferences satisfied four axioms has a utility function;Neumann, John von and Morgenstern, Oskar, Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. Princeton, NJ. Princeton University Press, 1953. such an individual's preferences can be represented on an interval scale and the individual will always prefer actions that maximize expected utility. That is, they proved that an agent is (VNM-)rational if and only if there exists a real-valued function u defined by possible outcomes such that every preference of the agent is characterized by maximizing the expected value of u, which can then be defined as the agent's VNM-utility (it is unique up to adding a constant and multiplying by a positive scalar). No claim is made that the agent has a \\"conscious desire\\" to maximize u, only that u exists. The expected utility hypothesis is that rationality can be modeled as maximizing an expected value, which given the theorem, can be summarized as \\"rationality is VNM-rationality\\". However, the axioms themselves have been critiqued on various grounds, resulting in the axioms being given further justification.Peterson, Chapter 8. VNM-utility is a decision utility in that it is used to describe decision preferences. It is related but not equivalent to so-called E-utilities (experience utilities), notions of utility intended to measure happiness such as that of Bentham's Greatest Happiness Principle.  Set-up  In the theorem, an individual agent is faced with options called lotteries. Given some mutually exclusive outcomes, a lottery is a scenario where each outcome will happen with a given probability, all probabilities summing to one. For example, for two outcomes A and B, ::L = 0.25A + 0.75B denotes a scenario where P(A) = 25% is the probability of A occurring and P(B) = 75% (and exactly one of them will occur). More generally, for a lottery with many possible outcomes Ai, we write: :: L = \\\\sum p_i A_i, with the sum of the p_is equalling 1. The outcomes in a lottery can themselves be lotteries between other outcomes, and the expanded expression is considered an equivalent lottery: 0.5(0.5A + 0.5B) + 0.5C = 0.25A + 0.25B + 0.50C. If lottery M is preferred over lottery L, we write L \\\\prec M, or equivalently, M \\\\succ L. If the agent is indifferent between L and M, we write the indifference relationKreps, David M. Notes on the Theory of Choice. Westview Press (May 12, 1988), chapters 2 and 5. L\\\\sim M. If M is either preferred over or viewed with indifference relative to L, we write L \\\\preceq M.  The axioms  The four axioms of VNM-rationality are then completeness, transitivity, continuity, and independence. Completeness assumes that an individual has well defined preferences: :Axiom 1 (Completeness) For any lotteries L,M, exactly one of the following holds: ::\\\\, L\\\\prec M, \\\\, M\\\\prec L, or \\\\, L \\\\sim M (either M is preferred, L is preferred, or the individual is indifferentImplicit in denoting indifference by equality are assertions like if L\\\\prec M = N then L\\\\prec N. To make such relations explicit in the axioms, Kreps (1988) chapter 2 denotes indifference by \\\\,\\\\sim, so it may be surveyed in brief for intuitive meaning.). Transitivity assumes that preferences are consistent across any three options: :Axiom 2 (Transitivity) If \\\\,L \\\\prec M and \\\\,M \\\\prec N, then \\\\,L \\\\prec N, and similarly for \\\\sim. Continuity assumes that there is a \\"tipping point\\" between being better than and worse than a given middle option: :Axiom 3 (Continuity): If \\\\,L \\\\preceq M\\\\preceq N, then there exists a probability \\\\,p\\\\in[0,1] such that ::\\\\,pL + (1-p)N\\\\, \\\\sim \\\\,M where the notation on the left side refers to a situation in which L is received with probability p and N is received with probability (1‚Äìp). Instead of continuity, an alternative axiom can be assumed that does not involve a precise equality, called the Archimedean property. It says that any separation in preference can be maintained under a sufficiently small deviation in probabilities: :Axiom 3‚Ä≤ (Archimedean property): If \\\\,L \\\\prec M\\\\prec N, then there exists a probability \\\\,\\\\varepsilon\\\\in(0,1) such that ::\\\\,(1-\\\\varepsilon)L + \\\\varepsilon N\\\\, \\\\prec \\\\,M \\\\, \\\\prec \\\\,\\\\varepsilon L + (1-\\\\varepsilon)N. Only one of (3) or (3‚Ä≤) need to be assumed, and the other will be implied by the theorem. Independence of irrelevant alternatives assumes that a preference holds independently of the possibility of another outcome: :Axiom 4 (Independence): For any \\\\,N and \\\\,p\\\\in(0,1], ::\\\\,L\\\\preceq M\\\\qquad iff\\\\qquad pL+(1-p)N \\\\preceq pM+(1-p)N. The independence axiom implies the axiom on reduction of compound lotteries:EconPort, \\"Von Neumann‚ÄìMorgenstern Expected Utility Theory\\" http://www.econport.org/content/handbook/decisions-uncertainty/basic/von.html :Axiom 4‚Ä≤ (Reduction of compound lotteries): For any lotteries L, L', N, N' and any p, q \\\\in [0,1], :: if \\\\qquad L\\\\sim qL'+(1-q)N', :: then \\\\quad pL+(1-p)N \\\\sim pqL'+ p(1-q)N' + (1-p)N. To see how Axiom 4 implies Axiom 4', set M = qL'+(1-q)N' in the expression in Axiom 4, and expand.  The theorem  For any VNM-rational agent (i.e. satisfying axioms 1‚Äì4), there exists a function u which assigns to each outcome A a real number u(A) such that for any two lotteries, ::L\\\\prec M \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{if \\\\, and \\\\, only \\\\, if} \\\\qquad E(u(L)) < E(u(M)), where E(u(L)), or more briefly Eu(L) is given by ::Eu(p_1A_1 + \\\\ldots + p_nA_n) = p_1u(A_1) + \\\\cdots + p_nu(A_n). As such, u can be uniquely determined (up to adding a constant and multiplying by a positive scalar) by preferences between simple lotteries, meaning those of the form pA + (1 ‚àí p)B having only two outcomes. Conversely, any agent acting to maximize the expectation of a function u will obey axioms 1‚Äì4. Such a function is called the agent's von Neumann‚ÄìMorgenstern (VNM) utility.  Proof sketch  The proof is constructive: it shows how the desired function u can be built. Here we outline the construction process for the case in which the number of sure outcomes is finite. Suppose there are n sure outcomes, A_1\\\\dots A_n. Note that every sure outcome can be seen as a lottery: it is a degenerate lottery in which the outcome is selected with probability 1. Hence, by the Completeness and Transitivity axioms, it is possible to order the outcomes from worst to best: :A_1\\\\preceq A_2\\\\preceq \\\\cdots \\\\preceq A_n We assume that at least one of the inequalities is strict (otherwise the utility function is trivial‚Äîa constant). So A_1\\\\prec A_n. We use these two extreme outcomes‚Äîthe worst and the best‚Äîas the scaling unit of our utility function, and define: :u(A_1)=0 and u(A_n)=1 For every probability p\\\\in[0,1], define a lottery that selects the best outcome with probability p and the worst outcome otherwise: :L(p) = p\\\\cdot A_n + (1-p)\\\\cdot A_1 Note that L(0)\\\\sim A_1 and L(1)\\\\sim A_n. By the Continuity axiom, for every sure outcome A_i, there is a probability q_i such that: :L(q_i) \\\\sim A_i and :0 = q_1\\\\leq q_2\\\\leq \\\\cdots \\\\leq q_n = 1 For every i, the utility function for outcome A_i is defined as :u(A_i)=q_i so the utility of every lottery M=\\\\sum_i{p_i A_i} is the expectation of u: :u(M) = u(\\\\sum_i{p_i A_i}) = \\\\sum_i{p_i u(A_i)} = \\\\sum_i{p_i q_i} To see why this utility function make sense, consider a lottery M = \\\\sum_i{p_i A_i}, which selects outcome A_i with probability p_i. But, by our assumption, the decision maker is indifferent between the sure outcome A_i and the lottery q_i\\\\cdot A_n + (1-q_i)\\\\cdot A_1. So, by the Reduction axiom, he is indifferent between the lottery M and the following lottery: :M' = \\\\sum_i{p_i [q_i\\\\cdot A_n + (1-q_i)\\\\cdot A_1]} :M' = (\\\\sum_i{p_i q_i})\\\\cdot A_n + (\\\\sum_i{p_i(1-q_i)})\\\\cdot A_1 :M' = u(M)\\\\cdot A_n + (1-u(M))\\\\cdot A_1 The lottery M' is, in effect, a lottery in which the best outcome is won with probability u(M), and the worst outcome otherwise. Hence, if u(M)>u(L), a rational decision maker would prefer the lottery M over the lottery L, because it gives him a larger chance to win the best outcome. Hence: ::L\\\\prec M \\\\; if and only if E(u(L)) < E(u(M)).  Reaction  Von Neumann and Morgenstern anticipated surprise at the strength of their conclusion. But according to them, the reason their utility function works is that it is constructed precisely to fill the role of something whose expectation is maximized: > \\"Many economists will feel that we are assuming far too much ... Have we not > shown too much? ... As far as we can see, our postulates [are] plausible ... > We have practically defined numerical utility as being that thing for which > the calculus of mathematical expectations is legitimate.\\" ‚Äì VNM 1953, ¬ß > 3.1.1 p.16 and ¬ß 3.7.1 p. 28 Thus, the content of the theorem is that the construction of u is possible, and they claim little about its nature.  Consequences = Automatic consideration of risk aversion  It is often the case that a person, faced with real-world gambles with money, does not act to maximize the expected value of their dollar assets. For example, a person who only possesses $1000 in savings may be reluctant to risk it all for a 20% chance odds to win $10,000, even though :20\\\\%(\\\\$10\\\\,000)+80\\\\%(\\\\$0) = \\\\$2000 > 100\\\\%(\\\\$1000) However, if the person is VNM-rational, such facts are automatically accounted for in their utility function u. In this example, we could conclude that :20\\\\%u(\\\\$10\\\\,000)+80\\\\%u(\\\\$0) < u(\\\\$1000) where the dollar amounts here really represent outcomes (cf. \\"value\\"), the three possible situations the individual could face. In particular, u can exhibit properties like u($1)+u($1) ‚â† u($2) without contradicting VNM-rationality at all. This leads to a quantitative theory of monetary risk aversion.  Implications for the expected utility hypothesis  In 1738, Daniel Bernoulli published a treatiseSpecimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis or Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk in which he posits that rational behavior can be described as maximizing the expectation of a function u, which in particular need not be monetary- valued, thus accounting for risk aversion. This is the expected utility hypothesis. As stated, the hypothesis may appear to be a bold claim. The aim of the expected utility theorem is to provide \\"modest conditions\\" (i.e. axioms) describing when the expected utility hypothesis holds, which can be evaluated directly and intuitively: > \\"The axioms should not be too numerous, their system is to be as simple and > transparent as possible, and each axiom should have an immediate intuitive > meaning by which its appropriateness may be judged directly. In a situation > like ours this last requirement is particularly vital, in spite of its > vagueness: we want to make an intuitive concept amenable to mathematical > treatment and to see as clearly as possible what hypotheses this requires.\\" > ‚Äì VNM 1953 ¬ß 3.5.2, p. 25 As such, claims that the expected utility hypothesis does not characterize rationality must reject one of the VNM axioms. A variety of generalized expected utility theories have arisen, most of which drop or relax the independence axiom.  Implications for ethics and moral philosophy  Because the theorem assumes nothing about the nature of the possible outcomes of the gambles, they could be morally significant events, for instance involving the life, death, sickness, or health of others. A von Neumann‚ÄìMorgenstern rational agent is capable of acting with great concern for such events, sacrificing much personal wealth or well-being, and all of these actions will factor into the construction/definition of the agent's VNM- utility function. In other words, both what is naturally perceived as \\"personal gain\\", and what is naturally perceived as \\"altruism\\", are implicitly balanced in the VNM-utility function of a VNM-rational individual. Therefore, the full range of agent-focussed to agent-neutral behaviors are . If the utility of N is pM, a von Neumann‚ÄìMorgenstern rational agent must be indifferent between 1N and pM+(1-p)0. An agent-focused von Neumann‚ÄìMorgenstern rational agent therefore cannot favor more equal, or \\"fair\\", distributions of utility between its own possible future selves.  Distinctness from other notions of utility  Some utilitarian moral theories are concerned with quantities called the \\"total utility\\" and \\"average utility\\" of collectives, and characterize morality in terms of favoring the utility or happiness of others with disregard for one's own. These notions can be related to, but are distinct from, VNM-utility: * 1) VNM-utility is a decision utility: it is that according to which one decides, and thus by definition cannot be something which one disregards. * 2) VNM-utility is not canonically additive across multiple individuals (see Limitations), so \\"total VNM-utility\\" and \\"average VNM-utility\\" are not immediately meaningful (some sort of normalization assumption is required). The term E-utility for \\"experience utility\\" has been coined to refer to the types of \\"hedonistic\\" utility like that of Bentham's greatest happiness principle. Since morality affects decisions, a VNM-rational agent's morals will affect the definition of its own utility function (see above). Thus, the morality of a VNM-rational agent can be characterized by correlation of the agent's VNM-utility with the VNM-utility, E-utility, or \\"happiness\\" of others, among other means, but not by disregard for the agent's own VNM-utility, a contradiction in terms.  Limitations = Nested gambling  Since if L and M are lotteries, then pL + (1 ‚àí p)M is simply \\"expanded out\\" and considered a lottery itself, the VNM formalism ignores what may be experienced as \\"nested gambling\\". This is related to the Ellsberg problem where people choose to avoid the perception of risks about risks. Von Neumann and Morgenstern recognized this limitation: > \\"...concepts like a specific utility of gambling cannot be formulated free > of contradiction on this level. This may seem to be a paradoxical assertion. > But anybody who has seriously tried to axiomatize that elusive concept, will > probably concur with it.\\" ‚Äì VNM 1953 ¬ß 3.7.1, p. 28.  Incomparability between agents  Since for any two VNM-agents X and Y, their VNM-utility functions uX and uY are only determined up to additive constants and multiplicative positive scalars, the theorem does not provide any canonical way to compare the two. Hence expressions like uX(L) + uY(L) and uX(L) ‚àí uY(L) are not canonically defined, nor are comparisons like uX(L) < uY(L) canonically true or false. In particular, the aforementioned \\"total VNM- utility\\" and \\"average VNM-utility\\" of a population are not canonically meaningful without normalization assumptions.  Applicability to economics  The expected utility hypothesis is shown to have limited predictive accuracy in a set of lab based empirical experiments, such as the Allais paradox. Which leads some people to interpret as evidence that * humans are not always rational, or * VNM-rationality is not an appropriate characterization of rationality, or * some combination of both, or * humans do behave VNM-rationally but the objective evaluation of u and the construction of u are intractable problems.

Benton was born to Russian immigrant parents living in Austria. The family left Europe in 1913 to relocate to the United States during World War I. During the Great Depression, Benton worked various odd jobs, enabling him to attend Ohio University, where he graduated in 1934. Afterwards, he was employed as a social investigator by New York City and then served in the United States Army during World War II. After the war he returned to his job in New York City while pursuing a career as a writer. His work was published in Yale Review, Saturday Review of Literature, Esquire, The New Republic and several other publications. His two books of poetry are his best-known works. This Is My Beloved was published in 1943 and has become one of the best-selling books of poetry. This volume was followed by another book of love poems, entitled Never a Greater Need, that was published in 1948. Benton suffered a massive stroke c. 1965 and was cared for by his niece Jeannette until he had to be placed in a nursing home, where he died in 1976. The American poet and singer Rod McKuen has said that his most romantic poetry was influenced by Benton's two books of poems. This Is My Beloved His book of poems addressed to \\"Lillian\\" was written in diary form. It was described in 1949 as \\"forthright love poems\\" and said to be \\"the best-selling poetry volume of recent years\\" having sold 350,000 copies at that time. Atlantic Records issued it as the company's first 33-rpm long-playing album in March 1949, with the poem narrated by John Dall and scored for a 28 piece orchestra and 16 voice chorus. The jazz musician Arthur Prysock read verses from Benton's book of poems against a jazz instrumental backdrop on his 1968 album This Is My Beloved.

At least four species are known, which ranged through Africa, southwestern Asia, and southeastern Europe from the Miocene to the Pliocene. The genus was larger than Pedetes. Species of Megapedetes were larger, relatively low-crowned (brachydont) pedetids with short, mostly fused roots under their teeth. There was no gutter surrounding the incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate). The bones are more robustly built than in Pedetes and in another fossil relative of the springhares, Parapedetes.Mein and Senut, 2003, p. 161 Unlike in Pedetes, the first metatarsal (a foot bone) is present.Mein and Senut, 2003, p. 162 It may have fed on less rough vegetation than Pedetes does.Winkler, 1992, p. 239 In Namibia, two species are known from the early middle MioceneMein and Senut, 2003, p. 163 of Arrisdrift‚ÄîM. gariepensis and M. pickfordi.

The Security Council received a report from the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on the monitoring of restrictions on the transfer of weapons and on the progress of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda mission. Possession of arms among the population was a major destabilising factor in the Great Lakes region. Zaire had proposed an international commission under the auspices of the United Nations to investigate arms supplies to former Rwandan government forces. The registration and marking of weapons would do much to control and enforce restrictions. There was concern regarding incursions into Rwanda by elements of the former regime and underlining the need for effective measures to ensure that Rwandan nationals in neighbouring countries could not undertake activities or receive weapons in order to destabilise the country. All sections of the Rwandan population, except those involved in genocide, had to begin talks. Rwanda demanded that the arms embargo against the Rwandan government be lifted to ensure the security of its people. It was originally recalled that the arms embargo was in place to prevent the use of weapons and equipment in the massacres of innocent people. There had already decided to reduce the size of UNAMIR and that the Rwandan government was responsible for the safety of the population. The Council drew attention to Rwanda's legal system, particularly overcrowding, lack of judges, the detention of minors and the elderly and the lack of a quick judicial process. In this regard, efforts by the United Nations and donors in collaboration with Rwanda to improve the situation were welcomed. The Secretary-General was requested as soon as possible to make recommendations on a Commission to conduct an investigation into the arms flows to former Rwandan government forces in the Great Lakes region. At the same time, Rwanda and its neighbours were asked to co-operate with the Commission. Within a month, Boutros-Ghali was to report on preparations for convening a regional Conference on Security, Stability and Development and the repatriation of refugees. The Rwandan government was called upon to create an atmosphere of trust and confidence for the safe return of refugees and resolve humanitarian problems in its prisons. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council then decided that the arms embargo against the Rwandan government would be suspended until 1 September 1996, through a number of access points to the country, of which Member States would be notified. After that date, the weapon restrictions against the Rwandan government would be terminated. Arms deliveries to groups other than that to the Rwandan government were prohibited, and the resale of the weapons was also prevented. In this regard, countries providing weapons to Rwanda would be required to notify the Committee established by Resolution 918. The Secretary-General was requested within six and then within twelve months to report on those supplies.

Agricultural Implements Series ( 2008 ) Interactive Animation w/ Agricultural Implements This large animation installation emphasizes ‚Äúcultural-revelation‚Äù and ‚Äúgreat-leap-forward‚Äù content, and the conflict between industrialization and agriculture. It does so interactively, through ancient Chinese agricultural implements, such as a normal winnower, a middle-sized grindstone, and a Chinese scale. Digitally Bloodless Series ( 2008 ) Installation in Kind w/ Digital Prints This series explores the paradox of state that humans inhabit‚Äîphysically passionate, yet technologically bloodless; though technologically advanced, we still operate off our primitive urges‚Äîan obvious and ongoing contradiction of state.

Our work ethic and life attitude determine the degree to which we rust. With digital animation technology, \\"Rusty-Faces\\" presents a contemporary artistic interpretation of the deterioration of mind, body, and spirit by harmful and self-destructive human behaviors. BurlHair Series and LavaBody Series ( 2005-2006 ) Animation Installation w/ Digital Rock Prints, Mirrors & LCD TVs 3D lava body/hair images are printed on a rock surface, a procedure that involves using printing technology on exotic materials. Each of my rock prints is the result of extensive research in terms of color consistency and material experimentation. The Matrox multi-display system allows the synchronized flow of animation among the six displays. The convex index, image shape, and dimension of the mirror generate an accurate virtual reflection of the lava animation. The convex index determines the size of the reflected lava animation, while the image shape determines the distance. Burl + 4 Series ( 2004-2005 ) Animation Installation w/ Digital Wood-prints & LCD TVs Includes various 3D images of different species, including human bodies and plants that are textured and formed by burl. These images are printed on various natural wood surfaces. The ‚ÄúBurl+4‚Äù series includes ‚ÄúBurlNuts+4,‚Äù ‚ÄúBurlBody+4,‚Äù ‚ÄúBurlFlower+4,‚Äù ‚ÄúBurlStampArm+4,‚Äù and ‚ÄúBurlHead + 4,‚Äù each of which is a group of pieces. Natural wood shapes, human bodies, and primitive, folk, and contemporary art inspired the innovation of these 3D images. Related animation is screened alongside the prints on four LCD TVs. ‚ÄúDigital Nature‚Äù is the main theme in this art exploration. Rawhide Series ( 2000-2004 ) Digital Rawhide Prints & Animation Projection 3D animation/modeling tribal-images are printed onto a rawhide surface using a digital inkjet printer. The rawhides are, in turn, stretched out by aluminum clamps and cotton strings, which are fastened to a naturally textured cedar wood frame. Various rawhides sizes and irregular shapes can be stretched using different lengths of strings at various angles. All frames are made from 4‚Äù x 4‚Äù cedar wood, and stand at 60‚Äù wide and 72‚Äù high. By incorporating the LCD TVs, the 3D animations associated with the 3D images play in synchronization beside or above the rawhide prints. Animation through Rawhide Projections 3D animation is projected onto both sides of the rawhides simultaneously. Due to the rawhides‚Äô semi-transparency and roughly textured surface, the effects on the rawhides are spectacular, with both sides illuminated and in motion. This projection creates an illusion that the animation is permeating through the rawhides. The audience has the ability to admire the work from any angle.

A ghost player can take the place of a human player either as a dead hand (their cards or pieces are not used in the game), or under the control of another player. In some games the dummy hand is revealed face-up. Dead hand In the case of card games and tile games the ghost player is dealt cards or tiles which are subsequently not used in the game (which are considered dead cards). The ghost player does not participate in the game, reveal their hand or score any points. In some versions of three player mahjong the last 13 tiles of the game are not used as though they belong to a fourth player who has not played their hand. That player also takes the fourth wind position. In Rummoli the ghost position is known as the widow. An extra hand is dealt to a ghost player and those cards are not revealed until the end of the game. This is designed to keep some cards out of the game, making it more challenging to win difficult hands. Controlled hand In other games the ghost players cards are controlled by a selected player (effectively meaning that player plays two separate hands). The points earned in the ghost hand are not scored separately but are scored to the player who controlled the ghost hand. A ghost player in Bunko,http://www.gamecabinet.com/rules/Bunko.html or other games with multiplayers formed in partnerships, represents the unfilled seat or position in a game, in which one person will play for him/herself as well as the ghost position. In dummy whist, a dummy hand is won and controlled by the winner of an in-game auction, during each hand. Tournaments In tournaments, especially in draw tournaments such as tennis, of single elimination, a ghost player may be added in certain rounds if there are not enough players to fill out a binary tournament table. In this case the non-ghost player automatically wins the game which is known as a bye.

It was first developed a street network in the early 19th century. By the 1820s the area was Portland's second seaport via the Back Cove‚Äôs ship channel. Much of the debris from the great Portland fire of 1866 was deposited into Back Cove, significantly increasing the size of Bayside. Maps produced around 1900 show an extension of the shoreline out to Marginal Way and beyond. The shoreline would not change again until the construction of the Interstate in 1974. In the 19th century the Bayside/East Bayside neighborhood was a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial uses. Manufacturing, including a foundry and a rope factory, was served, first by ship traffic on Back Cove and later, when the Cove channel was abandoned, by rail. The original rail line roughly forms the demarcation between the industrial zone, now located to the north of Fox Street, and the residential uses to the south. In the early 1950s the newly created Slum Clearance and Redevelopment Authority highlighted Bayside as a target neighborhood. In 1958 the Authority demolished the Little Italy neighborhood, a portion of which was in what we now call East Bayside, razing 92 dwellings and 27 small businesses. Another 54 dwelling units were razed for the Bayside Park urban renewal project, an area that now includes Fox Field and Kennedy Park public housing. The first phase of the Kennedy Park was built in 1965. Several streets were truncated in an attempt to limit access to outside traffic. The razing of Franklin Street began in 1967; 100 structures were demolished and an unknown number of families relocated or were displaced. The neighborhood has historically provided a home for recent immigrants with large population of Irish, Scandinavians, and Italians in the late 19th century. During the early 20th century over 250 Armenian families settled in the neighborhood. More recently East Bayside has become home to new immigrants including Cambodians, Vietnamese, and, most recently, Sudanese, Somalis, and Iraqis.East Bayside: Creating a Sustainable Vision for Maine‚Äôs Most Diverse Neighborhood The neighborhood is also prone to severe flooding events during King Tides, rainstorms, and during the spring snow melt. This is likely due to the fact that some of the area sits on artificial land. Climate change has proven to be a problem for Bayside, with some sources showing that Back Cove may expand back to its original pre-19-century levels by 2100, making most of Bayside uninhabitable once again. According to the 2010 census, Census Tract 5 is the most diverse section of Portland, Maine. It is 60% White, 21% Black, 6% Hispanic, 8% Asian, 1% Native American, and 4% Multiracial. In 2011, Mayo Street Arts, a community arts venue, opened on Mayo Street, adjacent to Kennedy Park in the previously unoccupied St. Angsar Church.

Matthews company owns the Midland Central Railroad, where Tom Oliver (John Dilson) is in charge. Jimmy pretends to be Matthews physician and gains access to his mansion to perform a physical examination. He orders Matthews to relieve stress by taking a weeks vacation. While he performs the physical, Matthews‚Äô daughter Helen (Lorna Gray) discovers that Jimmy isn‚Äôt a real doctor, but intrigued by the reason for the charade, she keeps quiet and doesn‚Äôt tell her father. Jimmy comes back to the mansion the day after when the family has left on their vacation, to search the house for leads to his story. He finds out that the family is on a train vacation, and takes a car to follow the train by road. Jimmy goes through a great ordeal to catch up with the train; he crashes his car and steals a police motorcycle. Eventually he manages to board the train, but at the same time, Matthews jumps off the train to escape his nagging sister. Matthews became acquainted with two hoboes living near the railroad tracks, and his wife Martha panics when she finds out he isn‚Äôt aboard the train anymore. Matthews is soon reported missing and his rival Tom Oliver start scheming to take control of the enterprise on his own. Jimmy reports back to his editor that the railroad tycoon is missing. There is a reward set to the person who can leave information leading to finding Matthews, but he is quite comfortable where he is with his new friends.

The species is native to the Bahamas. The snake's total length (including tail) is short, averaging between and . The Bahamian pygmy boa has the abilities to voluntarily bleed and to coil into a tight ball as defense mechanisms. Four subspecies are recognized, including the nominotypical subspecies, and occur across many different Bahamian Islands. Description=Physical Like all species of pygmy boas the Bahamian pygmy boa is a rather small snake averaging between and in total length. The snake has the ability to change color through the movement of its dark pigment granules. Depending on the time of the day, a light or dark color may provide better camouflage. The Bahamian pygmy boa has a yellow- orange tail tip, which is likely used to lure unsuspecting prey. In the 1960s herpetologists Schwartz and March recorded an ontogenetic change within the populations of all four subspecies. Juvenile snakes were reportedly spotted with dark blotches on a lighter ground color, while adults were only faintly spotted with a less prominent body color. Behavior The Bahamian pygmy boa is mostly inactive during daytime hours, usually coming out at night. Most dwarf boas are terrestrial, meaning they live and breathe on earth, and rest underground or in vegetation. A few have adapted to being arboreal. Young boas live in trees and shrubs and feed mostly on anole lizards. Adult boas feed on frogs, birds and rats. If threatened, the snake has been observed to coil up into a tight ball similar to that of a ball python. On Andros Island the species is known as the \\"shame snake\\" because of this defensive tactic. It also has the ability to voluntarily bleed from its eyes, mouth, and nostrils.

The film is based on the 2006 West Nickel Mines School shooting at Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania, and the spirit of forgiveness the Amish community demonstrated in its aftermath. The film stars Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Tammy Blanchard, and Matt Letscher and is based on the book Amish Grace: How Forgiveness Transcended Tragedy, Jossey-Bass, 2007, , by Donald Kraybill, Steven Nolt, and David L. Weaver-Zercher. Amish Grace was executive-produced by Larry A. Thompson, written by Sylvie White and Teena Booth, and directed by Gregg Champion. Plot When a group of Amish schoolgirls are taken hostage and killed in their classroom, their parents and the Amish community of Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania, stun the outside world by immediately forgiving the killer. Ida Graber (Kimberly Williams-Paisley), mother of one of the murdered children, has a tougher time than the others accepting the tragedy, but in her anguish and pain, she begins a personal journey of renewed faith, ultimately accepting the heart-wrenching tragedy of losing a child after learning that her murdered daughter, Mary Beth Graber, had promised to pray for the perpetrator before her death; reconnecting with her husband (Matt Letscher), family, and community; offering forgiveness to the killer; and even showing kindness and compassion to the killer's widow (Tammy Blanchard) and children ‚Äî all in the form of Amish grace. The film was dedicated in memory of the victims of the West Nickel Mines School shooting.

She was Member of Parliament (MP) for Devizes from 2010 to 2019, and served as Minister of State for Energy and Clean Growth from 2017 to 2019 with right to attend Cabinet after January 2018. Early life Claire Louise Perry O'Neill was born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire and brought up in North Somerset.Staff writer (2013), \\"PERRY, Claire Louise\\", She is the youngest of three children of David and Joanne Richens. She was educated at Nailsea School and Brasenose College, Oxford, where she read geography, graduating in 1985. One of her contemporaries at Brasenose was George Monbiot, who described her in his column for The Guardian as at the time \\"a firebrand who wanted to nationalise the banks and overthrow capitalism\\". She later gained an MBA at Harvard University. Following graduation, she worked for Bank of America, McKinsey & Company and Credit Suisse. Parliamentary career After joining the Conservative Party in 2006, Perry worked for Shadow Chancellor George Osborne. She was selected in November 2009 as a Conservative candidate after Michael Ancram announced his intention to stand down from Devizes, a safe seat for her party. In her maiden speech she was critical of the previous Labour government's management of the rural economy, adding: \\"we do not get as many jobcentres per head of the population in rural Britain\\". She also paid tribute to the Armed Forces, as Devizes is home to 11,000 soldiers. In October 2011, Perry was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Philip Hammond, the Secretary of State for Defence. She held this role until October 2013, when she became a Government Assistant Whip. On 15 July 2014, Perry was appointed Parliamentary Under- Secretary of State for Transport, with responsibility for rail fares, rail franchising, freight and logistics and transport agencies. She resigned from this position on 14 July 2016, at the time of the reshuffle, when Theresa May became Prime Minister, the day after saying in a debate she was \\"often ashamed to be the Rail Minister\\". Perry campaigned for improvements in online safety, and in 2011 led an Independent Parliamentary Inquiry into Online Child Protection, with a particular focus on online pornography. She was subsequently appointed by the Prime Minister, David Cameron, as an adviser on preventing the sexualisation and commercialisation of children. Perry argued for blocks on pornography for all internet users unless they opt out of it, citing the need to protect children. In July 2013, hackers placed pornographic images on Perry's own website. Perry accused political blogger Paul Staines ‚Äì known for his Guido Fawkes blog ‚Äì of sponsoring the attack,\\"Net block MP Claire Perry in spat over porn hack\\" , BBC News, 24 July 2013 while Staines threatened to sue her for libel if the claim was not removed. After Internet filters started to be rolled out, news agencies reported that a wide range of non-pornographic websites were now being censored by UK ISPs as a result of false-positive results for blocked phrases, including Perry's own website, as a result of her frequent use of words such as \\"porn\\" and \\"sex\\" in web posts about her pro-censorship campaign. In 2012, Perry mistakenly stated that the national debt and national deficit were the same thing in a discussion on BBC Radio 5 Live. On Radio 5 this morning: Victoria Derbyshire: What is puzzling is, under Labour debt equals bad, under the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats national debt equals? Claire Perry: We have cut Labour's deficit Victoria by a quarter Derbyshire: I‚Äôm talking about debt Perry: Well it is the same thing Derbyshire: It is not the same thing Perry campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU during the 2016 membership referendum, and argued after the vote that some members of her party were \\"like jihadis\\" in their support for a \\"hard Brexit\\" and said the tone of the debate on leaving the European Union \\"borders on the hysterical\\". She was one of only seven Conservative MPs to vote for an amendment arguing that Parliament should have the final say on any deal to leave the EU. She subsequently voted with her party in approving the decision to invoke Article 50. Perry was appointed as Minister of State for Energy and Clean Growth at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy by Theresa May in the her second ministry, after the June 2017 reshuffle. During the January 2018 cabinet reshuffle, she was given the right to attend Cabinet. In September 2019, Perry announced she would not stand at the next general election, which in the event took place in December of that year. In November 2018 the PCS, FDA and Prospect unions raised concerns with senior officials at the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy that Perry had been accused of swearing and shouting at staff. The shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett said that the unions had raised \\"serious allegations\\" and urged officials to \\"look into them carefully\\". The Daily Telegraph reported in May 2019 that she was claiming ¬£9,843 per year tax-free in Parliamentary expenses for her three children, two of whom were adults, on top of her salary as MP and Minister of State for Energy totalling ¬£111,148 and her standard tax-free \\"second home allowance\\" of ¬£22,760. She did not deny the report, but said that she had not broken any Parliamentary rules.  Post-Parliament career = Climate Change Conference  In September 2019, Perry was nominated as President of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, to be held in Glasgow in November 2020. In the same month, she announced that she would not stand for re-election to Parliament, and she then gave up her seat in the general election of December 2019. The UK government abruptly removed Perry from the Presidential post on 31 January 2020, stating that the post would become \\"a ministerial role\\". She later criticised actions of the prime minister's adviser Dominic Cummings, saying he \\"put out a deeply defamatory briefing to the media the day he fired me, claiming that the COP didn‚Äôt need a President\\".  WBCSD  In September 2020, Perry was appointed managing director for climate and energy at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, a membership organisation for companies, which works on a variety of issues related to sustainable development. Personal life Perry has three children from her former marriage. Three months after she announced her separation, it was reported that Perry had begun a relationship with Professor Bill O'Neill, a researcher and lecturer on lasers, whom she had met through constituency work; Perry and O'Neill married in 2018. Perry lives in Pewsey Vale in Wiltshire.

He worked with other philosophers including William James, George Santayana, John Dewey, Edmund Husserl, and Ludwig Wittgenstein.Loyd Easton, Dickinson Miller: Philosophical Analysis and Human Welfare\\", Reidel, 1975 Biography Miller received the A.B. degree in 1889 under George Fullerton at the University of Pennsylvania. He studied psychology under G. Stanley Hall at Clark University for a year, and then went to Harvard where he was a graduate student under William James, G. H. Palmer, Josiah Royce, and Santayana. He received the A.M. from Harvard in 1892.Loyd Easton, Dickinson Miller: Philosophical Analysis and Human Welfare\\", p.1 He then spent a year in Germany studying at Berlin and Halle under Max Dessoir, Hermann Ebbinghaus, and Friedrich Paulsen, earning his Ph.D. with a dissertation on Das Wesen der Erkenntnis und des Irrthums, which was published as \\"The Meaning of Truth and Error\\" in The Philosophical Review in 1893.Easton, p.2 This article led James to abandon Royce's solution of the knowledge problem in terms of an absolute mind. James recommended Miller to a post at Bryn Mawr College in 1893, where he was a close friend of Woodrow Wilson.Easton, p.2 In 1899, Miller became a strong critic of James's famous arguments in The Will to Believe that the beneficial effects of a belief somehow increased its \\"truth.\\" His critical article was \\"The Will to Believe and the Duty to Doubt.\\"Ralph Barton Perry, The Thought and Character of William James, vol. 2, p.240 Miller left Bryn Mawr that year to become an instructor of philosophy at Harvard, where he had a strong and productive collaboration with James.Easton, p.5 James referred to Miller as \\"my most penetrating critic and intimate enemy.\\" \\"R. E. Hobart\\" on Information Philosopher In 1904, Miller left Harvard to be a lecturer in philosophy at Columbia and professor in 1911. There he worked with Arthur O. Lovejoy and John Dewey.Easton, p.8 Miller retired from academic work after two years at Smith College (1926-26) and went into a \\"European retirement.\\" Easton, p.21 He visited Rome at first and then alternated between Florence and Vienna, where he made contact with the \\"Vienna Circle\\" of philosophers, including Moritz Schlick, Otto Neurath, Rudolf Carnap, Herbert Feigl, and others. Miller challenged a basic principle of the Circle that \\"no sentence can be admitted to philosophical thought as having a meaning unless it is verifiable in experience.\\" Such a principle, he argued \\"cuts the ground from under its own feet\\" because a sentence has to already have meaning before you can apply the test.Easton, p.22 In Vienna he met with Ludwig Wittgenstein who was then loosely associated with the Vienna Circle. Free will as involving determination In 1934, as Miller left to return for America, he published a landmark article in Mind under the pseudonym R. E. Hobart,.R. E. Hobart, Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It\\" Mind, Vol XLIII, No. 169, p.2 He analyzed the relationship between \\"could\\" and \\"can\\" in the sense of choosing to do otherwise in the same circumstances and he claimed that the controversy of free will versus determinism was a waste of energy over a false antithesis. At least some determinism is not a problem for free will but a feature.Easton, p.23 The article was titled \\"Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It,\\" but it is widely misquoted as \\"Involving Determinism.\\" His biographer, Loyd Easton, correctly describes it as \\"an acute example of 'soft determinism' or 'reconciliationism'.\\"Easton, p.23 The problem of \\"determinism\\" versus free will that William James was concerned about was the strict causal determines that is better called predeterminism where every event is determined in a causal chain back to the beginning of time, and there is \\"but one possible future,\\" as James put it.James, William. 1884. The Dilemma of Determinism, Unitarian Review, vol.XXII, p.193. Reprinted in The Will to Believe, Dover Publications, 1956, p.145 Far from \\"reconciling\\" free will with this kind of determinism, as David Hume said that he had done in his \\"reconciling project,\\",David Hume, An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, VIII, 1, ¬ß72 James proposed the first two-stage model of free will that denies predeterminism and accepts absolute chance as necessary for the generation of alternative possibilities, which are the source of \\"ambiguous futures\\" selected by the determination, but not predetermination, of the will.Bob Doyle, \\"Jamesian Free Will: The Two-Stage Model of William James,\\" William James Studies, April 2010 Miller/Hobart dissents from James's new idea about free will, constructing a distinctive reconciling compatibilism that dispenses with any requirement for chance in the analysis of what persons' abilities to perform alternate acts. Rather than analyzing causality as Hume did, Hobart focuses on moral evaluation of acts and character. The Mind article Writing about six years after the discovery of quantum indeterminacy, Hobart explicitly does not endorse strict logical or physical determinism, and he explicitly does endorse the existence of alternative possibilities, i.e., that we can do otherwise in the same circumstances. Hobart does not, however, attribute those possibilities to absolute chance. He says: > I am not maintaining that determinism is true; only that it is true in so > far as we have free will. ... it is not here affirmed that there are no > small exceptions, no slight undetermined swervings, no ingredient of > absolute chance. All that is here said is that such absence of > determination, if and so far as it exists, is no gain to freedom, but sheer > loss of itMind, Vol XLIII, No. 169, January, 1934, p.2 > \\"We say,\\" I can will this or I can will that, whichever I choose \\". Two > courses of action present themselves to my mind. I think of their > consequences, I look on this picture and on that, one of them commends > itself more than the other, and I will an act that brings it about. I knew > that I could choose either. That means that I had the power to choose > either.Mind, p.8 We can contrast Hobart with William James's claim that there are ambiguous futures. The second paragraph is not inconsistent with the two-stage model of free will - first \\"free\\" courses of action present themselves, then an adequately determined \\"will\\" chooses between them, in a temporal sequence. However, the first paragraph denies that any randomness in the decision process, including the presentation of options, adds to freedom. Hobart refers to G. E. Moore's idea that one could have done otherwise - \\"if\\" one had chosen otherwise. But Hobart views the \\"if\\" as redundant, and therefore licenses the claim that we could have done otherwise, full stop. > Thus it is true, after the act of will, that I could have willed otherwise. > It is most natural to add, \\"if I had wanted to\\"; but the addition is not > required. The point is the meaning of \\"could\\". I could have willed whichever > way I pleased. I had the power to will otherwise, there was nothing to > prevent my doing so, and I should have done so if I had wanted.Mind, p.9 Hobart finds fault with the indeterminist's position, but he gives the typical overstatement by a determinist critic, that any chance will be the direct cause of our actions, which of course would clearly be a loss of freedom and responsibility > Indeterminism maintains that we need not be impelled to action by our > wishes, that our active will need not be determined by them. Motives > \\"incline without necessitating\\". We choose amongst the ideas of action > before us, but need not choose solely according to the attraction of desire, > in however wide a sense that word is used. Our inmost self may rise up in > its autonomy and moral dignity, independently of motives, and register its > sovereign decree. > Now, in so far as this \\"interposition of the self\\" is undetermined, the act > is not its act, it does not issue from any concrete continuing self; it is > born at the moment, of nothing, hence it expresses no quality; it bursts > into being from no source. (p.6) > In proportion as an act of volition starts of itself without cause it is > exactly, so far as the freedom of the individual is concerned, as if it had > been thrown into his mind from without ‚Äî \\"suggested\\" to him ‚Äî by a freakish > demon. It is exactly like it in this respect, that in neither case does the > volition arise from what the man is, cares for or feels allegiance to; it > does not come out of him. In proportion as it is undetermined, it is just as > if his legs should suddenly spring up and carry him off where he did not > prefer to go. Far from constituting freedom, that would mean, in the exact > measure in which it took place, the loss of freedom.Mind, p.7 Possibly Hobart has William James in mind as \\"the indeterminist.\\" However, the only inderminist philosopher named in the article is Eddington. James would not have denied that our will is an act of determination, consistent with, and in some sense \\"caused by\\" our character and values, our habits, and our current feelings and desires. He simply wanted chance to provide alternative possibilities for actions and a break in the causal chain of strict determinism. Hobart sees no need for such chance, and no addition to freedom to be had by it. The freedom we take ourselves to have is fully consistent with thorough-going determinism regarding human action. > In daily life we are all determinists, just as we are all libertarians. We > are constantly attributing behaviour to the character, the temperament, the > peculiarities of the person and expecting him to behave in certain fashions. > The very words of our daily converse, as we have so amply observed, are full > of determinism.

In older literature this bee is often referred to as Bremus bimaculatus, Bremus being a synonym for Bombus. The bee's common name comes from the two yellow spots on its abdomen. Unlike many of the other species of bee in the genus Bombus, B. bimaculatus is not on the decline, but instead is very stable. They are abundant pollinators that forage at a variety of plants.  Taxonomy and phylogeny  Bombus bimaculatus is in the subgenus Pyrobombus, which is closely related to the subgenera Alpinobombus and Bombus out of the 15 total. Within Pyrobombus, B. bimaculatus is most closely related to B. monticola, B. sylvicola, and B. lapponicus. Additionally, B. bimaculatus can oftentimes be confused with B. impatiens and B. griseocollis, as their colorations are very similar.  Identification  Male Bombus bimaculatus Bombus bimaculatus was first described by Ezra Townsend Cresson, an American entomologist, in 1863. Workers look very similar to queens, with the two mainly distinguished by size. Sometimes large workers can be mistaken for small queens, especially toward the end of the season when workers have grown larger and new queens emerge. Queens have a black face with a triangular patch of yellow hairs on the vertex. Their thorax is yellow except for a shining area on the disc that is bordered by black hairs. Their venter is black with some yellow hairs on the legs. Male faces have intermixed black and yellow hairs. They resemble females in most markings, except their tergite 2 has more yellow lateral hairs than the female whose tergite 2 has black edges and few yellow lateral hairs. The size of the radial cell in the wing differs for each. Workers have the smallest, ranging from 2.5 to 3.6 mm. Males are slightly bigger at 2.6‚Äì3.6 mm. Queens have the largest at 3.4‚Äì4.1 mm.Female Bombus bimaculatus  Distribution and habitat  B. bimaculatus is mainly found in eastern temperate forest regions throughout the United States and the southeastern part of Canada. It can also live in the coastal plains of the southeastern United States, the eastern Boreal forest, and the eastern Great Plains. This bee lives in underground nests, preferably in or around wooden areas and gardens. Nests can be anywhere from 6 inches to a foot below the surface. Tunnels traveling to the nest range from 9 inches to 4 feet long. B. bimaculatus can also nest above ground or in cavities. Bees do not build nests and instead rely on finding abandoned rodent dens, hollow logs, suitable man- made structures, or tussocks. Queens will hibernate in loose dirt or rotting logs. This bumble bee is very common and has been experiencing steady growth unlike many other bumble bees that are in decline.  Colony cycle  Bumble bee colonies are annual and a new colony is founded when a mated queen, the foundress, emerges from hibernation in the spring. Habitats for hibernation and colonies are different so she must find a suitable location to start her nest and she must do this on her own. She will provision it with pollen and nectar and then lay her eggs. This first brood will become non-reproducing female workers. At this time the queen must alternate between incubating the larvae and foraging for more provisions. Thus, this is the most vulnerable time for a fledgling colony. Alternatively, some queens will not have mated the previous year and her offspring will all be male. Eggs typically hatch after four days and spend two weeks feeding on stored provisions before pupating. After another two weeks the pupae will have developed into adults. Once the workers emerge, queens will forage less and spend more time laying eggs. For B. bimaculatus, workers typically emerge in May and peak in July. Workers are responsible for brood care, foraging, regulating nest temperature and defending the nest. Males emerge last in June and peak in July. Unlike workers who stay and care for the brood, males will soon leave the nest after maturation to seek mates. New queens are produced at about the same time as males, and will forage extensively to build reserves for their overwintering. Unlike males that leave the nest and do not return, new queens will return to the nest at night. B. bimaculatus is one of the earliest bumble bee species to emerge, with queens being sighted as early as February. By the time fall arrives, newly mated queens will all be hibernating to repeat the cycle the following spring. Workers, males, and foundresses will have died. B. bimaculatus's colonies emerge quickly and die quickly in comparison with other bumble bee species.  Behavior = Male incubation  Male B. bimaculatus can help care for larvae during the first days, or even weeks, of their life. Though female workers are mainly responsible for brood care, males cannot fly for the first 24 hours of their life so they cannot leave the nest. Incubating larvae is a potential opportunity for males to exercise their flight muscles. They assume the same position on the cocoon as females would and pump their abdomen to facilitate heat flow from their thorax to their abdomen to the brood. Male incubation may be more significant towards the end of the season when there are fewer workers to incubate larvae.  Mating  B. bimaculatus mate outside the nest with males patrolling in circuits, searching for a queen to mate with. Most queens only mate once; however, there are some queens who mate multiple times and have offspring of multiple paternity.  Foraging  B. bimaculatus queens forage on Aquilegia flowers. The queens hang upside down on stamens, clutch the filament with their forelegs, and scrape off pollen using their middle and hind legs. Workers enter the Aquilegia spurs by pushing their head and part of their thorax into the spur's mouth. They then extend the maxillae and tongue into the spur to drink nectar, repeating this process on multiple spurs of the same plant before visiting the next one. B. bimaculatus queens' probosces range from 10.53 to 12.19 mm in length, which has little overlap with other Bombus species. This may potentially be the reason why B. bimaculatus are such abundant pollinators. Research comparing B. bimaculatus to Xylocopa virginica, a carpenter bee, found that the former learned faster and had more flexible foraging patterns. It was hypothesized that B. bimaculatus being a social bee could have individuals specialize in either foraging for nectar or pollen, instead of having to worry about both in overall food collection as the nonsocial carpenter bees needed to do.  Mimicry and camouflage  Several fly species are Batesian mimics of bumble bees, including robber flies, flower flies, deer bot flies, and bee flies. Some species of beetles, moths, sawflies and even other bees will mimic bumble bees. Additionally, the bumble flower beetle does not mimic the bumble bee's coloration but its buzzing flight sound. Bumble bees are not only mimicked by other insects, but also take on similar color patterns to each other in a form of M√ºllerian mimicry when multiple bumble bee species are found in the same region. B. bimaculatus is in the same group as B. impatiens, B. griseocollis, B. affinis, B. vagans, B. sandersoni, B. perplexus and B. fraternus. They all have a predominantly yellow thorax with a darker central spot. Nests typically do not need camouflage as they are hidden underground or in cavities.  Interactions with other species = Diet  Bumble bees eat nectar and pollen from plants. B. bimaculatus is known to pollinate a wide variety of plants, but they seem to have favorites. Queens can be found on willow and plum. Workers are found on red clover and mint. Males are found on mint and sweet clover. Zenobia pulverulenta, a plant that B. bimaculatus forages on As a species they have been found foraging at the following plants: * Zenobia pulverulenta * Gelsemium sempervirens * Lyonia lucida * Solanum dulcamara * Aquilegia species * Dicentra species * Mertensia species * Pedicularis species * Aesculus glabra * Camassia scilloides * Delphinium tricorne * Hydrophyllum appendiculatum  Predators  A Florida black bear, which preys on B. bimaculatus Predators of bumble bees include crab spiders, Florida black bears, ambush bugs, robber flies, dragonflies, assassin bugs, and some wasp species. Crab spiders ambush B. bimaculatus at flowers, paralyze them, and then eat them. Florida black bears eat B. bimaculatus most abundantly in the spring, and continue to eat them to a lesser extent in the summer.  Defense  B. bimaculatus will defend its nests against intruders, such as Psithyrus variabilis, a cuckoo bumble bee. In an experiment, a female P. variabilis was placed in a B. bimaculatus nest. Workers quickly recognized her as an intruder, halted their work and attacked her when she entered the inner part of the nest. Oftentimes though, B. bimaculatus are content to ignore intruders, such as Psithyrus labrosius. Like P. variabilis, P. labrosius also is a cuckoo bumble bee. It will attack Bombus vagans, but not B. bimaculatus though they are in the same subgenus, Pyrobombus. B. bimaculatus queens can kill each other when dueling. Queens can also be hostile to unrelated workers of their own species by squirting feces in their faces.  Parasites  Brachycoma sarcophagina is an ectoparasitoid that will consume B. bimaculatus bees from the outside. Female B. sarcophagina deposit young larvae on B. bimaculatus larvae. B. sarcophagina larvae will not begin consuming their host until the host has begun spinning its cocoon. Tracheal mites, will parasitize multiple Bombus species, but strongly prefer B. bimaculatus. Mites were recovered from the autosomal air sacs of bumble bees. These mites can affect behavior and reduce longevity, which may cause further stress to colonies already facing difficulties. Conopid flies also parasitize B. bimaculatus. Male bees were less likely to be parasitized than workers, and larger bees were more likely to be parasitized than smaller bees. B. bimaculatus is also parasitized by a bumble bee of the subgenus Psithyrus, Bombus citrinus, a brood parasite.  Phoresy  Kuzinia, Scutacarid, and Parasitid mites were found on B. bimaculatus bees. Scutacarid and Parasitid mites were found in the propodia, the first abdominal segment in bees. These mites, being phoretic, likely just use the bee as a means of transport. It is unknown what effect, either detrimental or beneficial, these mites may have on the bee.  Diseases  B. bimaculatus can be infected with Nosema bombi, a microsporidian. This bee can also be infected by other fungal species. It is unknown how detrimental such an infection is to the bee's health. Compared to other bumble bees that are in decline, B. bimaculatus has a lighter infection, which may be the reason why it is experiencing stable growth compared to the decline in other Bombus species. However, the reason for the difference in infection is unknown. B. bimaculatus can also be infected by Crithidia bombi and Apicystis bombi. Both are protozoans, but C. bombi is known to hinder colony creation, decrease host lifespan and colony fitness, and have a negative effect on workers' behavior. This can cause undue stress on colonies, leading to a species' decline.  Microbiome  The gut bacteria of B. bimaculatus was isolated and include Snodgrassella alvi and Gilliamella apicola strains. B. bimaculatus had more gut bacteria from environmental sources, and less core bacteria compared to other bumble bee species. B. bimaculatus had more core bacteria when collected from farms as opposed to collection from semi-natural habitats.  Human importance = Pollinator  B. bimaculatus is an important pollinator in temperate forest regions as it is still abundant, unlike many other species of honey and bumble bees. They also pollinate a wide variety of plants. In addition, bumble bees can continue foraging even under sub-optimal conditions such as rain or clouds. B. bimaculatus is capable of flying even at 7 ¬∞C. This makes the continued growth and stability of B. bimaculatus particularly valuable.  Sting  Only female bees have a sting, males do not. Bumble bees typically only sting when defending their nest or when captured. Allergies to bumble bee stings are much less common than allergies to honey bee stings though the venom composition is similar. B. bimaculatus venom contains additional proteins, including acrosin and a tryptic amidase related to clotting enzymes.

He created the Jax and the Hellhound and Major Lancer and the Starlight Squadron comic series that were published by Blackthorne Publishing Inc. He also worked in advertising, film and television including Late Night with David Letterman. Francis started as an apprentice to comics DC Comics legend Dick Giordano before working with his partner Neal Adams at Continuity Studios in New York City. He became one of the prolific writer illustrators during the heyday of black-and-white comics throughout the 1980s. His comics work usually centers on science fiction and fantasy. Biography=Early life Francis was born in Kingston, Jamaica in February 1957. His family immigrated to the U.S. in 1965. He took a keen interest in comics during his adolescent years while enjoying the works of Russ Manning, Gene Colan, Neal Adams and Dick Giordano. Dennis Francis made several attempts to break into the comics field during his high school years at the Fiorello LaGuardia School of Music and Art. Career At the end of 1975, Francis discovered advertising illustration and photography during his time at Pace University and soon gained employment in the newsroom of a local Brooklyn newspaper. He soon became an adept at publication design, photography and advertising design. A chance encounter with the daughter of Neal Adams at a comic convention changed his life. During an impromptu interview with the comic book creator, he was given an opportunity to meet with Dick Giordano of DC Comics, who had been Adams is business partner for many years at Continuity Studios. In 1981, after a brief period of working with Mr. Giordano an opportunity arose to work in the advertising art studio with Mr. Adams and the choice had to be made then and there. Francis began working as a commercial illustrator with Continuity Studios creating storyboards for award-winning commercials. Throughout that period he also had opportunities to work on merchandising comics for the company as well as animatics and concept art. In 1984, another fateful encounter during a speech given at a Graphic Artists Guild Seminar led to an offer to work with Late Night with David Letterman show on NBC. The job entailed the creation of comic book characters Frank and Fred along with cartoon and comic illustration for the props. The project led to a two-year association with the show. During the NBC years, Francis also worked with DC comics as an illustrator of their merchandising. He was soon tapped to work with Joe Giella and Bob Lappan on a series of activity books in the under served children's market as well as the Superman Sunday comic strips. Francis was included in a project to design and implement a comic book for Nancy Reagan‚Äôs ‚ÄúJust Say No‚Äù campaign. 1986 was another influential year when a chance meeting with Steve Shanes, the publisher of Blackthorne comics made him an offer he couldn't refuse. Francis was given the task of visualizing hundreds of characters for the Blackthorne universe. During the height of the black-and-white comic book explosion, Francis collaborated with writer, Mark Wayne Harris on the critically acclaimed Limited Series, Street Wolf. Francis designed and penciled the graphic novel X-L, along with the three issue miniseries Locke. When asked what projects he wanted to personally produce and create for the new Blackthorne lineup, two projects that have been in the works for many years finally became real. Jax and the Hellhound, a proposed graphic novel became a three issue miniseries. The other project, major lancer and the starlight squadron was a holdover from a proposed comic strip he created during high school. Shanes then commissioned a series of children's activity projects starting with the ‚ÄúHow To Draw‚Äù Series. The 3-D comics craze took hold of the consumers‚Äô attention in early 1988 and Blackthorne publishing jumped into the fray. Francis designed and illustrated several projects including the Transformers 3-D three issue series. From the end of 1988 to the middle of 1989 a series of unfortunate events brought his association to a close with Blackthorne Publishing as the comic book market finally burst its ever-growing bubble. The Blackthorne color line retreated back into the imagination of its creators but comic book legend Neal Adams once again made him an offer he couldn't refuse. The New York office of Continuity Studios has created a West Coast branch and needed a manager; Francis saw this as an opportunity to work in Los Angeles close to the entertainment studios. His experience in advertising design and television entertainment was now going to be put to the test in Hollywood. 1994 saw the birth of T&D; publishing; a publications consulting company that helps small business owners figure out how to use that newfangled invention that everybody was looking at called desktop publishing. With the proliferation of computers and digital printing, small business operations could have greater control of print communications. By the year 2000, publication design became mostly digital design of the Web began to take more precedence in business communication. T&D; Publishing became DiD Publishing as Francis began to work with online content and web design. In 2008 he attended a comic convention in San Diego and was once again inspired to dust the cobwebs from his decade old properties. He had registered the domain name graphic-novels.com years before but now gave serious thought to going back to his first love, comics. April, 2009 began work on several comic book properties for his new venture;Graphic-novels.com. Jax and the Hellhound, the Hit List, Dangerlove and the Starlight Squadron are currently in production for online release. New artwork and stories are currently appearing on the website in the first quarter of 2010 for Jax and the Hellhound.

The size of the ovate shell varies between 8 mm and 20 mm. It is thin and whitish. The apex presents an appearance as if an embryonic tip (perhaps spiral) had fallen and been replaced by a peculiarly blunt ovate apex, which in the young shell is nearly marginal, posterior and to the left of the middle line, but in the adult is considerably within the margin, curved downward and backward and much more asymmetrical. The sculpture of the shell shows faint grooves radiating from the (smooth) apex and reticulated by the stronger concentric lines of growth, beside which the extremely inflated arch of the back is somewhat obscurely concentrically waved. The shell has a polished appearance over the sculpture. The thin margins are sharp. The interior of the shell is smooth and somewhat polished. The scar of the pedal muscle is narrow and at a considerable distance within the margin. The anterior ends of the scar are enlarged and hooked backward on their inner edges.

He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2018 for inventing OLED (together with Steven Van Slyke), and was awarded the 2011 Wolf Prize in Chemistry. Tang is the IAS Bank of East Asia Professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and previously served as the Doris Johns Cherry Professor at the University of Rochester. Biography Tang was born in Yuen Long, British Hong Kong in 1947. He attended secondary school at Yuen Long Public Secondary School in Hong Kong and later received his senior high school education at King's College. He graduated with a BS in chemistry from the University of British Columbia, Canada, and subsequently earned his PhD in physical chemistry from Cornell University in the US in 1975. He joined Eastman Kodak in 1975 as a Research Scientist, was promoted to Senior Research Scientist in 1981, to Research Associate in 1990, and to Senior Research Associate in 1998. In 2003 he was named Distinguished Fellow of the Kodak Research Laboratories, Eastman Kodak Company. In 2006 he joined the University of Rochester as the Doris Johns Cherry Professor. Tang is the inventor of several groundbreaking electronic devices, including the OLED (organic light- emitting diode), and the hetero-junction organic photovoltaic cell (OPV). Efficient OLEDs of small molecules were first developed by Tang at the research department of Eastman Kodak Company in the 1970s. Tang is widely recognized as one of the leaders in the organic electronics industry and in photovoltaics. Tang was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2006 for \\"the invention of the organic light-emitting device and organic bilayer solar cell, the bases of modern organic electronics\\". In addition to his pioneer research on the OLED and OPV, Tang made a number of critical innovations resulting in the commercialization of a new flat-panel display technology. These innovations include \\"the development of robust transport and luminescent materials, improved device architectures, novel color pixilation methods, and fabrication processes for the manufacture of passive-matrix OLED displays; and the adaptation of active-matrix backplane technology for high- definition OLED displays\\".

They have a delicate horn-color with a broad band of very dark brown along the strongly serrate, cutting edges. The inner surface is strongly reticulated. The form of these plates is quite irregular: the cutting edge is oblique, forming an angle of about 135¬∞ with the inner or middle, straight edge; the distal outline is very strongly sinuously curved, forming a wide, shallow upper portion and a much narrower basal portion.Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, vol. 10, 1899‚Äì1900  Habitat  Minimum recorded depth is 713 m.

It continues the events of Bloody Jack, as Jacky returns from her 'history-defining' adventure as a Parisian nightclub spy and messenger for Napoleon Bonaparte. The series began in Bloody Jack, Curse of the Blue Tattoo, Under the Jolly Roger, In the Belly of the Bloodhound, Mississippi Jack, and My Bonny Light Horseman, and continues in The Wake of the Lorelei Lee, The Mark of the Golden Dragon, Viva Jacquelina!, Boston Jacky, and Wild Rover No More. Plot summary On the day that Jacky Faber is to wed her true love, Jaimy, she is kidnapped by British Naval Intelligence and forced to embark on yet another mission for the Crown, searching for sunken Spanish gold off the coast of Havana. Along the way, Jacky and her mates find more than they have bargained for. Story Minutes after the final confrontation at the end of My Bonny Light Horseman, Jacky‚Äôs schooner, the Nancy B. Alsop, comes to receive Jacky from Paris. Once aboard, her butler Master John Higgins cleans her up and Jacky discusses her duty as a nightclub dancer, her position as spy for the British, and her relationship with Jean- Paul. Jacky is reunited with Jaimy, and the two decide to get married when at home in Britain. When in London, she reunites with friends and family and dines with Jaimy's family. On the day of the wedding, Mairead, Judy, and Joannie help get Jacky ready, but the wedding is interrupted by British Intelligence and Jackie and Jamie are taken away. Jacky is reunited with Mr. Peel and Lord Grenville, who inform Jacky of the assignment at hand. In 1733, the ship Santa Magdalena sunk while carrying millions of gold in coins. Britain wants to retrieve that gold to help the economy and Jacky is promised a percentage of that gold and a possible pardon from the King, despite her crimes of piracy. Jacky and Jamie are given separate ships: the Dolphin and the Nancy B. Alsop. The Dolphin is commandeered by Captain Hannibal Hudson, while Jacky captains the Nancy B. Jaimy and Lieutenant Flashby are stationed on the Dolphin. Jacky is assigned to sail to the Florida Keys to the locationof the Santa Magdalena. Jackie and Jamie depart on their two separate ships and sail for Boston. In Spanish waters, Jacky is required to take up a disguise as an American sponge diver. Jacky prepares to revisit the Lawson Peabody School for Young Girls. She sees her friend and biographer, Amy Trevelyne, who has recently taken a liking for Ezra Pickering. Eventually, Jacky reunites with Captain Hudson and Jaimy. Hudson show Jacky a diving bell, which will aid Jacky underwater while she hunts for the Santa Magdalena gold supply. Before setting sail for the Keys, Jacky tells Captain Hudson to be on the lookout for any ship-jumpers that might get on board for information and turn it in to the opposing forces such as the Spanish. Jacky and Jaimy enjoy time together but must depart for a couple of weeks. While docked in Charleston, Jacky, Davy, and Tink, visit a couple of taverns where Jacky performs songs on the pennywhistle and violin. The next day, Jacky and the group run into a slave auction. Jacky is deeply angered by this kind of trade, but bids for an old slave woman named Jemimah and brings her aboard her ship. Jemimah is taken in as the ship's cook. When they get to the Keys, Jacky starts swimming immediately; her first dive is a dangerous one as she has a run-in with a moray eel. Despite Dr. Sebastian's interest in the creature, Jacky decapitates the eel. While sailing around a nearby island, Jacky prepares to dive and find the Santa Magdalena. Spurred on by Dr. Sebastian, Jacky dives into the water and finds the sunken ship. Unfortunately, a Spanish man-of-war called the San Cristobal comes across the Nancy B. and board it. The officer in charge demands who the fleet is and what's their purpose in Spanish waters. Unconvinced, the men scrounge the Nancy B., although they find no evidence to prove the crew are fakes. After Jacky emerges from the water and offends the officer in charge, the Spanish and the Nancy B. sail separately for Havana. Once they dock, the lieutenant from the San Cristobal introduces himself as Juan Carlos Cisneros y Siquieros. Jacky and Juan Carlos instantly dislike each other. Meanwhile, Jemimah decides to explore the town and see if she likes it enough to make her own roots. Jacky, Davy, and Tink explore the town; taking in some cockfighting matches and performing at the Cafe Americano, among other activities. Soon, Jemimah comes back to be a part of the crew. One night at the Cafe Americano, Jacky runs into old flame Flaco Jimenez and is introduced to Flaco's new first mate, El Feo. As they talk, it is revealed that Captain Hudson let a ship-jumper on board the Dolphin, who gathered information for the Spanish. Jaimy and the Dolphin crew soon meet up with Jacky, who has spent her time preparing for cockfighting matches. Jacky gets ready for her first descent using the diving bell; Tink makes Jacky some swim fins and she gets used to the diving bell's design. As they make preparations, Flaco Jimenez and his ship returns, making the crew uneasy. Jacky gets underwater towards the ship with a grappling hook and begins the scavenging operation, eventually finding the ship's vault Inside the vault, Jacky finds the gold supply of the ship. In the process of getting the bell and gold up into the ship, Jacky contracts nitrogen narcosis. Jacky don't feel anything but when the pain from the Rapture of the Deep starts to kick in, she begins convulsing and shrieking until they get her back into the water to ease the condition. Jaimy, even though he is nervous about being in the bell under water, takes her down where they make out. Dr. Sebastian is angry with Jacky for getting the condition but eventually has Jacky ushered to bed. The next day, Jacky starts putting the gold in baskets underwater when her own greed tells her to put fan coral in the baskets and keep the gold for herself. Jacky does it, sneaking the gold into her undersea safehold for Faber Shipping Worldwide. Soon, Jacky encounters Flaco and his ship El Diablo Rojo and while they talk, Flaco's first mate El Feo plots a mutiny in secret. They hold the Nancy B. and its crew at gunpoint, but soon a fight among the two opposing ships commences. El Feo and his new ship, the Red Devil, retreat, leaving Flaco siding with Jacky. Back in town, Jacky continues the cockfighting matches and nights at the Cafe Americano. Jaimy and the rest of the Dolphin crew end up in Kingston. They are invited to the Officers' Club where Jaimy runs into Captain Richard Allen. Jaimy and Captain Allen remember each other and they have an awkward conversation. After another cockfighting match, Jacky tells Joannie to go collect the winnings, only Joannie goes missing. The crew searches Havana for her and head for the sea, following a tip about Joannie‚Äôs kidnapper. While at sea, Jacky‚Äôs crew is taken prisoner by El Feo. It's found out that El Feo kidnapped Joannie and Flashby has been working undercover for El Feo as a double agent. El Feo demands to be shown where the gold is at. Jacky lies to El Feo, saying it's all on a nearby island. El Feo has Flashby and his crew sail to the island and look for the treasure. El Feo then takes Jacky to his living quarters where he attempts to rape Jacky. Daniel and Joannie intervene and release El Gringo on El Feo. Jacky's crew then takes over the ship. Finally the San Cristobal comes into view, attacking both ships, But the Dolphin comes to aid Jacky and the crew just in the nick of time. Jacky reunites with both Jaimy and Captain Allen and fights off the Spanish warship. Cisneros then comes aboard for Jacky personally. Jacky shoots him as he is about to shoot her. With the battle soon over, Flaco regains his old ship and leaves the battlefield. Jaimy then soon embarks to be an officer in command on the newly named Saint Christopher. When Flaco returns, and the gold is split evenly between the crew. The Spanish sailor then leaves again and Jacky makes her way back to Boston where her crew splits up.

Wang is the current Zhi Yuan Chair Professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Chemical Engineering. Biography Wang was born in Jiangyan, Jiangsu, China in 1962. Wang obtained his bachelor's (in 1982) and master's (in 1985) degrees both in polymer science from the East China University of Science and Technology. In 1989, Wang went to study in Belgium with Prof. Philippe Teyssi√© and obtained his doctorate degree with highest possible rank (avec la plus grande distinction et les felicitations du jury) from the University of Li√®ge, Belgium, in 1993. Wang published more than 20 papers, mostly in Macromolecules, and obtained 12 issued US and European patents in the area of living polymerization from his four-years doctoral research work. Months before his departure to the United States to continue his research at the Carnegie Mellon University with Krzysztof Matyjaszewski in 1994, he started conceptualizing free-radical catalyzed living radical polymerization, after studying a series of published papers on free-anion catalyzed living anionic polymerization (also called group-transfer polymerization) of methacrylate and transition-metal / free-radical catalyzed atom (group)-transfer radical addition (ATRA). Shortly after arriving in Prof. Matyjaszewski's laboratories in 1994, Wang started to implement his ideas of applying the principle of atom (group)-transfer radical addition to living radical polymerization in the lab with self-made air- and oxygen-free mini- reactors. Wang did seminal work on Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP) during that period of time. With Prof. Matyjaszewki, Wang published three original papers on ATRP and reverse ATRP. Wang is one of the major contributors to the birth and mechanism of ATRP. He is the first Chinese polymer chemist to discover a polymerization chemistry. In 1995, Wang dedicated himself to industry and was a Senior Chemist at the Nalco Chemical Company. From 1997 to 2008, Wang also served as Research Associate at the Eastman Kodak Company. In 2008, Wang founded companies SWW and WangAtrp in U.S. and was companies' president. In 2009, Wang went back to Shanghai, and has served as the Zhi Yuan Chair Professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Chemical Engineering. In 2010, Wang founded First O-Lite, Inc with Dr. Yuan-Sheng Tyan, a world top OLED lighting scientist and several Chinese businessmen in Nanjing and is Vice-Chairman and CEO of the company. First O-Lite is among the first in the world to manufacture OLED lighting panels and products. Currently, Wang also serves as Co-Chairman of China OLED Industry Alliance.

Pierre Gustave Joly de Lotbiniere (1798‚Äì1865, Canadian) and Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey (1804‚Äì1892, French) were among the examples of persons who came to Greece and took photographs of Greece (daguerreotypes) in 1830s or 1840s. In 1840s, Philibert Perraud (1815-1863?), a French photographer, came to Greece and taught photography to Filippos Margaritis (Greek painter), who was said to be the first Greek photographer and who later opened the first Greek professional photo studio in 1853, in Athens. In 1859, Greek photographer Petros Moraites opened his photo studio in Athens with Athanasios Kalfas. He took many portraits of many Greek people including the royal family and around 1870 became one of the most notable photographers in Greece at that time.

It was their fourth record; a comeback after a decade long separation. It was accompanied by a public reunion and tour. Although the album did not achieve either commercial or critical success, it resulted in the hit single \\"Rocket O' Love,\\" which reached #9 in Billboard's Mainstream Rock Chart. Overview The album was released by Charisma Records on January 16, 1991. Musician Don Was, better known as a member of the group Was (Not Was), produced the album. He was a friend of Knack frontman Doug Fieger since high school. The Knack split up in 1981 just a few weeks after the release of Round Trip, which failed to achieve critical success although it reached #93 in the Billboard 200. Serious Fun represented a reunion after around a decade of separation. The album represented a more hard rock sound for the band, reminiscent of the Raspberries. Serious Fun also failed to achieve either commercial or critical success. However, it resulted in the popular single \\"Rocket O' Love,\\" which reached #9 in Billboard's Mainstream Rock Chart. The band created a rarely seen music video for the song.See image \\"One Day at a Time\\" was intended to be the second single from the album, but the label decided to stop promoting the album at the time of the intended release. According to Knack guitarist Berton Averre, an A&R; man at the label thought \\"One Day at a Time\\" would be a hit but felt it would be preferable for the lead single to be a harder rock song, and so \\"Rocket O' Love\\" was released as the lead single. And apparently when the time came to release a second single, the label had lost interest in the band, and so buried the intended release of \\"One Day at a Time.\\" The bomb-riding and lasso- waving scene from the 'Rocket O' Love' music video A deluxe CD reissue complete with 24-bit digital remastering, bonus tracks, and detailed liner notes was released in 2002 by parent company Virgin Records. It includes a cover of the Martha & the Vandellas song 'Nowhere to Run' done in the Knack's power pop style. The official website for the band states that: \\"The Knack's fourth studio album is serious fun! Some of the best music the band ever made.\\" The songs \\"I Want Love,\\" \\"Rocket O' Love\\" and \\"One Day at a Time\\" were incorporated into the greatest hits album The Retrospective: The Best of the Knack, which was released by Capitol Records on November 16, 1992. \\"Rocket O' Love\\" was also included in the greatest hits album Very Best of the Knack, released by Rhino Records on May 19, 1998. Reception Musician panned the album, stating that \\"Anyone who believes the musical legacy of the '70s is nothing to be ashamed of might want to reconsider after hearing this one.\\" Critic Stewart Mason of AllMusic gave a mixed review. He remarked that even though \\"the songs are neat little packages of appropriately crunchy guitar hooks and harmonies\\", still \\"Serious Fun doesn't manage to be quite as much fun as it could be.\\" Critic William Ruhlmann, also with AllMusic, commented that \\"it's hard to imagine anyone other than die-hard Knack fans expressing any interest in it.\\" Walter Allread panned the album as uninspired, stating that it consisted of \\"12 new tunes that succeed only at making you want to hear 'My Sharona' again,\\" but also conceded that \\"One Day at a Time\\" might have some radio success.
