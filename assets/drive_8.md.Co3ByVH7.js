Its most notable feature is a radar dome that was built on the peak in the late 1980s, which is used for aircraft positioning services. Geography Cass Peak is located in the Port Hills and is high. Otamatua is the spur on the Christchurch side of the peak that divides the Hoon Hay and Kennedy's Bush valleys. At the bottom end of Otamatua is the Halswell Quarry. On the eastern side of Cass Peak is Lyttelton Harbour, with Allandale and Governors Bay the nearest settlements on the harbour side. The peak is accessible from the Summit Road by vehicle, and via the Crater Rim walkway. Etymology Cass Peak was named for Thomas Cass, the chief surveyor of Canterbury from 1851 until his retirement in 1867. The hill was earlier called Cass's Peak. The MƒÅori name for the hill is ≈å-Rongo-Mai, which translates as \\"where voices are heard\\". This refers to the time some 300 years ago when the NgƒÅi Tahu tribe captured the area from the KƒÅti MƒÅmoe. On top of the peak, the NgƒÅi Tahu heard the voices of a KƒÅti MƒÅmoe hunting party. The latter were slaughtered on the peak. In July 2020, the hill was officially assigned the dual name ≈årongomai / Cass Peak by the New Zealand Geographic Board. History The radar dome on Cass Peak The original Gothic architecture railway station in Christchurch's Moorhouse Avenue, opened in 1876, was built of red brick, with stone facings from Cass Peak as architectural elements. In 1948, an area of was vested into Christchurch City Council as a reserve, and the area was named Cass Peak Scenic Reserve. The reserve is fenced to exclude livestock because it has high botanical value. The reserve's perimeter is about . Harry Ell, famous for his preservation work in the Port Hills, made the area accessible through the construction of the Summit Road; much of it was built during the Great Depression in the 1930s. When the Port Hills came under pressure of subdivision, Norman Kirk managed to get the Summit Road (Canterbury) Protection Act passed in 1963, which protected the skyline by not allowing any development from the ridge to below the Summit Road. Shortcomings in the legislation did not prevent, however, the construction of the Sugarloaf communications tower or the radar dome on Cass Peak. Cass Peak has a repeater station for radio signals used by amateur radio, ambulance services, and air traffic control. The prominent radar dome on top of Cass Peak is part of a nationwide system of air traffic management and is operated by Airways New Zealand. The nationwide system was built in the late 1980s and became operational in 1991. Of the six secondary radar stations supplying the two air traffic control centres in Auckland and Christchurch with aircraft position data, Cass Peak is the southernmost in New Zealand. The Summit Road Society built many new tracks in the Port Hills during the 1980s. In 1985, a track was built at Cass Peak.

The palace, considered an architectural heritage and a tourist attraction, was built in the mid-19th century, replacing an earlier fort located nearby. It served as a royal residence for the Raja of Khaplu. From 2005 to 2011 the palace, having earlier stood in vulnerable conditions, underwent a restoration project carried out by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture under the Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme. The palace now houses a hotel operated by Serena and a museum depicting the history and culture of Baltistan.  Location  The town of Khaplu is located in the eastern part of Baltistan, at an altitude of above sea level and is the administrative capital of the Ghanche District. River Shyok a tributary of River Indus, passes through the town, along which is the ancient trade route to Ladakh. Khaplu Palace is located north of the Khaplu town and south of the Shyok river in front of the high mountains of Karakoram range. A trek behind the palace in a ravine leads to the village of Pari in Skardu District.  History  Khaplu Palace was built in 1840 by the Yabgo Raja Daulat Ali Khan of Khaplu after the Dogra of Kashmir who captured the region decided to move the seat of government from the old fort. The site of the palace was chosen by rolling a large stone down from a nearby cliff; it stopped at the Doqsai village, and the palace was built there. The earlier fort was located near the location of the present-day palace. Khaplu Palace replaced the former fort as the royal residence after its completion. According to Jane E. Duncan, the people of Khaplu used to live inside this fort and were not allowed to build their homes outside its premises. This practice was changed after Maharaja of Kashmir took control of the area, resulting in a cessation of conflict among neighbouring rulers. The former fort was captured by Murad Khan of Maqpon Dynasty, the ruler of Baltistan, in the Conquest of Khaplu in the 1590s by cutting off the water and other supplies to the fort. The troops of Murad besieged the fort for three months, resulting in the surrender of Rahim Khan, the 62nd Yabgo dynasty ruler of Khaplu. The fort again fell to invaders in the 1660s and 1674. The Yabgo descendants continued to live there even after their kingdom was abolished in 1972. The last Raja of Khaplu who lived in the house was Raja Fatah Ali Khan, who died in 1983.  Architecture  The palace was constructed with the help of Kashmiri and Balti craftsmen. Being on the border of multiple regions, the structure of the palace has Tibetan, Kashmiri, Ladakhi, Balti, and Central Asian influences. The palace building consists of four floors built with timber, mud bricks, clay, and soil mortar. A carved wooden gate that Yabgo Raja Hatim Khan took from a fort in Skardu after conquering most of the Baltistan was erected at the entrance of the palace. The passage beyond the main gate, which formerly housed a stable, leads to the front lawn of the palace, which was used by the musical band during festivities in the reign of Yabgo Rajas. The wooden ceiling of the palace is crafted with designs using chisel and paint, without the use of nail. A hall at the top floor that was used as a leisure room overlooks the Karakoram mountain range and the lawns around the palace. Other notable rooms of the palace include the Royal meeting room (Chogoraftal), Royal balcony (Chogojarokh), Princess dressing room (Lainakhang), and Queen room. Following the renovation of the palace, a section of residential area is being used as a hotel, operated by Serena Hotels and employing people from 35 local households. The hotel has 21 rooms, six of which are located inside the palace building and utilise its 70 percent of income for the development of the Khaplu region, while another area serves as a museum.  Renovation  Khaplu Palace is the second fort in Baltistan to be renovated by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture. Renovation started in 2005 and was completed in 2011. The project was funded by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs via its embassy in Islamabad. USAID helped fund an exhibition centre for Balti culture inside the fort. The exhibition centre takes up two-thirds of the site. The renovation work was carried out with the help of people from 400 local families employed as an initiative towards community building. The survey encompassing the topographical features of the renovation site. begun in 2005, used Electronic Distance Measurement (EDM) devices. The survey helped in finding the original state of a number of decrepit portions of the palace. The renovation project was carried out following the Venice Charter's standards for restoration. The material procured for the restoration amounted to thirty million rupees (Rs 30 m), while the wages of the labourers aggregated to about twenty five million rupees (Rs 25 m).  Awards  The rescue and renovation work of the palace was commended by Virgin Holidays for having social and economic effects on the locals of the area. The palace won the Virgin Holidays Responsible Tourism Award as the best project in the \\"Poverty Reduction\\" category in 2012. In 2013 the palace was awarded the Award for Distinction by UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Awards, along with Lal Chimney Compound in India and The Great Serai in Afghanistan. The famous drama serial Dayar-e-Dil was shot at Khaplu fort.

Park Changsoo, Moga) is a Korean sculptor in wood, and a museum curator. He is the primary exponent of the Korean style of wood-carving known as mokjogakjang. Park began wood-carving at the age of 12 to supplement his family's income. A decade or so later he became interested in Buddhist sculpture, and began to specialise in the rediscovery of the traditional mokjogakjang carving techniques used in Buddhist art. He took the Buddhist name Moga, meaning \\"a tree in bud\\". In 1989, he founded the Moga Museum (later the Moga Buddhist Museum) in Yeoju to display traditional handicrafts and Buddhist sculptures and relics. The museum has over 6,000 pieces in its catalogue, many of them Park's own work. Park has been noted for both the rough-hewn simplicity of his works and for his melding of ancient and modern sculpture techniques. Many of his works have a comic or joyful theme, derived from his Buddhist beliefs. Unusually, he uses a moktak (Buddhist wooden percussion instrument) rather than a hammer or mallet to drive his chisel. Thematically, his carvings tend to be of Buddha or Buddhist subjects, but he is also noted for creating traditional shamanic sculptures such as jangseung totems. In 1986, Park was awarded the grand prize at the Buddhist Arts Exhibition, and three years later won the President's Prize in the national Traditional Crafts Competition. In 1996, Park and his style of carving were designated Important Intangible Cultural Assets by the Korean Cultural Heritage Organisation. He has also written several books on traditional Korean woodcarving, and runs workshops and classes in which he teaches others the art of mokjogakjang. One of his sculptures is owned by George W. Bush, and is displayed at Bush's Texas ranch.

The wildlife of Antarctica are extremophiles, having to adapt to the dryness, low temperatures, and high exposure common in Antarctica. The extreme weather of the interior contrasts to the relatively mild conditions on the Antarctic Peninsula and the subantarctic islands, which have warmer temperatures and more liquid water. Much of the ocean around the mainland is covered by sea ice. The oceans themselves are a more stable environment for life, both in the water column and on the seabed. There is relatively little diversity in Antarctica compared to much of the rest of the world. Terrestrial life is concentrated in areas near the coast. Flying birds nest on the milder shores of the Peninsula and the subantarctic islands. Eight species of penguins inhabit Antarctica and its offshore islands. They share these areas with seven pinniped species. The Southern Ocean around Antarctica is home to 10 cetaceans, many of them migratory. There are very few terrestrial invertebrates on the mainland, although the species that do live there have high population densities. High densities of invertebrates also live in the ocean, with Antarctic krill forming dense and widespread swarms during the summer. Benthic animal communities also exist around the continent. Over 1000 fungi species have been found on and around Antarctica. Larger species are restricted to the subantarctic islands, and the majority of species discovered have been terrestrial. Plants are similarly restricted mostly to the subantarctic islands, and the western edge of the Peninsula. Some mosses and lichens however can be found even in the dry interior. Many algae are found around Antarctica, especially phytoplankton, which form the basis of many of Antarctica's food webs. Human activity has caused introduced species to gain a foothold in the area, threatening the native wildlife. A history of overfishing and hunting has left many species with greatly reduced numbers. Pollution, habitat destruction, and climate change pose great risks to the environment. The Antarctic Treaty System is a global treaty designed to preserve Antarctica as a place of research, and measures from this system are used to regulate human activity in Antarctica. Environmental conditions Elevation of the Antarctic terrain Around 98% of continental Antarctica is covered in ice up to thick. Antarctica's icy deserts have extremely low temperatures, high solar radiation, and extreme dryness. Any precipitation that does fall usually falls as snow, and is restricted to a band around from the coast. Some areas receive as little as of precipitation annually. The coldest temperature recorded on Earth was at Vostok Station on the Antarctic Plateau. Organisms that survive in Antarctica are often extremophiles. The dry interior of the continent is climatically different from the western Antarctic Peninsula and the subantarctic islands. The Peninsula and the islands are far more habitable; some areas of the peninsula can receive of precipitation a year, including rain, and the northern Peninsula is the only area on the mainland where temperatures are expected to go above in summer. The subantarctic islands have a milder temperature and more water, and so are more conducive to life. The surface temperature of the Southern Ocean varies very little, ranging from to . During the summer sea ice covers of ocean. The continental shelf surrounding the mainland is from wide. The depth of the seafloor in this area ranges from , with an average of . After the shelf, the continental slope descends to abyssal plains at deep. In all these areas, 90% of the seafloor is made up of soft sediments, such as sand, mud, and gravel. Animals Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are a keystone species, forming an important part of the Antarctic food web. At least 235 marine species are found in both Antarctica and the Arctic, ranging in size from whales and birds to small marine snails, sea cucumbers, and mud-dwelling worms. The large animals often migrate between the two, and smaller animals are expected to be able to spread via underwater currents. However, among smaller marine animals generally assumed to be the same in the Antarctica and the Arctic, more detailed studies of each population have often‚Äîbut not always‚Äîrevealed differences, showing that they are closely related cryptic species rather than a single bipolar species. Antarctic animals have adapted to reduce heat loss, with mammals developing warm windproof coats and layers of blubber. Antarctica's cold deserts have some of the least diverse fauna in the world. Terrestrial vertebrates are limited to sub-antarctic islands, and even then they are limited in number. Antarctica, including the subantarctic islands, has no natural fully terrestrial mammals, reptiles, or amphibians. Human activity has however led to the introduction in some areas of foreign species, such as rats, mice, chickens, rabbits, cats, pigs, sheep, cattle, reindeer, and various fish. Invertebrates, such as beetle species, have also been introduced. The benthic communities of the seafloor are diverse and dense, with up to 155,000 animals found in . As the seafloor environment is very similar all around the Antarctic, hundreds of species can be found all the way around the mainland, which is a uniquely wide distribution for such a large community. Polar and deep-sea gigantism, where invertebrates are considerably larger than their warmer-water relatives, is common in this habitat. These two similar types of gigantism are believed to be related to the cold water, which can contain high levels of oxygen, combined with the low metabolic rates (\\"slow life\\") of animals living in such cold environments. Birds A Wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans) on South Georgia The rocky shores of mainland Antarctica and its offshore islands provide nesting space for over 100 million birds every spring. These nesters include species of albatrosses, petrels, skuas, gulls and terns. The insectivorous South Georgia pipit is endemic to South Georgia and some smaller surrounding islands. Ducks, the South Georgia pintail and Eaton's pintail, inhabit South Georgia, Kerguelen and Crozet. The flightless penguins are almost all located in the Southern Hemisphere (the only exception is the equatorial Galapagos penguin), with the greatest concentration located on and around Antarctica. Four of the 18 penguin species live and breed on the mainland and its close offshore islands. Another four species live on the subantarctic islands. Emperor penguins have four overlapping layers of feathers, keeping them warm. They are the only Antarctic animal to breed during the winter. Fish Compared to other major oceans, there are few fish species in few families in the Southern Ocean. The most species-rich family are the snailfish (Liparidae), followed by the cod icefish (Nototheniidae) and eelpouts (Zoarcidae). Together the snailfish, eelpouts and notothenioids (which includes cod icefish and several other families) account for almost of the more than 320 described fish species in the Southern Ocean. Tens of undescribed species also occur in the region, especially among the snailfish. If strictly counting fish species of the Antarctic continental shelf and upper slope, there are more than 220 species and notothenioids dominate, both in number of species (more than 100) and biomass (more than 90%). Southern Ocean snailfish and eelpouts are generally found in deep waters, while the icefish also are common in shallower waters. In addition to the relatively species- rich families, the region is home to a few species from other families: hagfish (Myxinidae), lamprey (Petromyzontidae), skates (Rajidae), pearlfish (Carapidae), morid cods (Moridae), eel cods (Muraenolepididae), gadid cods (Gadidae), horsefish (Congiopodidae), Antarctic sculpins (Bathylutichthyidae), triplefins (Tripterygiidae) and southern flounders (Achiropsettidae). Among fish found south of the Antarctic Convergence, almost 90% of the species are endemic to the region. = Icefish = Fish of the Notothenioidei suborder, such as this young icefish, are mostly restricted to the Antarctic and Subantarctic Cod icefish (Nototheniidae), as well as several other families, are part of the Notothenioidei suborder, collectively sometimes referred to as icefish. The suborder contains many species with antifreeze proteins in their blood and tissue, allowing them to live in water that is around or slightly below . Antifreeze proteins are also known from Southern Ocean snailfish and eelpouts. There are two icefish species from the genus Dissostichus, the Antarctic toothfish (D. mawsoni) and the Patagonian toothfish (D. eleginoides), which by far are the largest fish in the Southern Ocean. These two species live on the seafloor from relatively shallow water to depths of , and can grow to around long weighing up to , living up to 45 years. The Antarctic toothfish lives close to the Antarctic mainland, whereas the Patagonian toothfish lives in the relatively warmer subantarctic waters. Toothfish are commercially fished, and illegal overfishing has reduced toothfish populations. Another abundant icefish group is the genus Notothenia, which like the Antarctic toothfish have antifreeze in their bodies. An unusual species of icefish is the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum), which is the only truly pelagic fish in the waters near Antarctica. Mammals Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) are the most southerly of Antarctic mammals. Seven pinniped species inhabit Antarctica. The largest, the elephant seal (Mirounga leonina), can reach up to , while females of the smallest, the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella), reach only . These two species live north of the sea ice, and breed in harems on beaches. The other four species can live on the sea ice. Crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus) and Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) form breeding colonies, whereas leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) and Ross seals (Ommatophoca rossii) live solitary lives. Although these species hunt underwater, they breed on land or ice and spend a great deal of time there, as they have no terrestrial predators. The four species that inhabit sea ice are thought to make up 50% of the total biomass of the world's seals. Crabeater seals have a population of around 15 million, making them one of the most numerous large animals on the planet. The New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri), one of the rarest and most localised pinnipeds, breeds almost exclusively on the subantarctic Auckland Islands, although historically it had a wider range. Out of all permanent mammalian residents, the Weddell seals live the furthest south. There are 10 cetacean species found in the Southern Ocean; six baleen whales, and four toothed whales. The largest of these, the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), grows to long weighing 84 tonnes. Many of these species are migratory, and travel to tropical waters during the Antarctic winter. Orcas, which do not migrate, nonetheless regularly travel to warmer waters, possibly to relieve the stress the temperature has on their skin. Land invertebrates A pair of Belgica antarctica, the only insect on mainland Antarctica. Most terrestrial invertebrates are restricted to the sub-Antarctic islands. Although there are very few species, those that do inhabit Antarctica have high population densities. In the more extreme areas of the mainland, such as the cold deserts, food webs are sometimes restricted to three nematode species, only one of which is a predator. Many invertebrates on the subantarctic islands can live in subzero temperatures without freezing, whereas those on the mainland can survive being frozen. Mites and springtails make up most terrestrial arthropod species, although various spiders, beetles, and flies can be found. Several thousand individuals from various mite and springtail species can be found in . Beetles and flies are the most species rich insect groups on the islands. Insects play an important role in recycling dead plant material. The mainland of Antarctica has no macro-arthropods. Micro-arthropods are restricted to areas with vegetation and nutrients provided by the presence of vertebrates, and where liquid water can be found. Belgica antarctica, a wingless midge, is the only true insect found on the mainland. With sizes ranging from , it is the mainland's largest terrestrial animal. Many terrestrial earthworms and molluscs, along with micro- invertebrates, such as nematodes, tardigrades, and rotifers, are also found. Earthworms, along with insects, are important decomposers. The springtail Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni is endemic and restricted to southern Victoria Land between Mt. George Murray (75¬∞55‚Ä≤S) and Minna Bluff (78¬∞28‚Ä≤S) and to the adjacent nearshore islands. Insects endemic to Antarctica include: *Belgica albipes, a midge *Belgica antarctica, a midge *Siphlopteryx antarctica, a fly Springtail species identified in recent research: *Antarcticinella monoculata *Cryptopygus antarcticus *Desoria klovstadi *Friesea grisea *Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni *Gressittacantha terranova *Neocryptopygus nivicolus Mite species identified in recent research: *Coccorhagidia keithi *Nanorchestes antarcticus *Stereotydeus mollis *Tydeus setsukoae Marine invertebrates =Arthropods= Five species of krill, small free-swimming crustaceans, are found in the Southern Ocean. The Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is one of the most abundant animal species on earth, with a biomass of around 500 million tonnes. Each individual is long and weighs over . The swarms that form can stretch for kilometres, with up to 30,000 individuals per , turning the water red. Swarms usually remain in deep water during the day, ascending during the night to feed on plankton. Many larger animals depend on krill for their own survival. During the winter when food is scarce, adult Antarctic krill can revert to a smaller juvenile stage, using their own body as nutrition. Many benthic crustaceans have a non-seasonal breeding cycle, and some raise their eggs and young in a brood pouch (they lack a pelagic larvae stage). Glyptonotus antarcticus at up to in length and in weight, and Ceratoserolis trilobitoides at up to in length are unusually large benthic isopods and examples of Polar gigantism. Amphipods are abundant in soft sediments, eating a range of items, from algae to other animals. The amphipods are highly diverse with more than 600 recognized species found south of the Antarctic Convergence and there are indications that many undescribed species remain. Among these are several \\"giants\\", such as the iconic epimeriids that are up to long. Crabs have traditionally not been recognized as part of the fauna in the Antarctic region, but studies in the last few decades have found a few species (mostly king crabs) in deep water. This initially led to fears (frequently quoted in the mainstream media) that they were invading from more northern regions because of global warming and possibly could cause serious damage to the native fauna, but more recent studies show they too are native and formerly simply had been overlooked. Nevertheless, many species from these southern oceans are extremely vulnerable to temperature changes, being unable to survive even a small warming of the water. Although a few specimens of the non-native great spider crab (Hyas araneus) were captured at the South Shetland Islands in 1986, there have been no further records from the region. Slow moving sea spiders are common, sometimes growing up to about in leg span (another example of Polar gigantism). Roughly 20% of the sea spider species in the world are from Antarctic waters. They feed on the corals, sponges, and bryozoans that litter the seabed. =Molluscs= warty squid (Moroteuthis ingens) Many aquatic molluscs are present in Antarctica. Bivalves such as Adamussium colbecki move around on the seafloor, while others such as Laternula elliptica live in burrows filtering the water above. There are around 70 cephalopod species in the Southern Ocean, the largest of which is the colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni), which at up to is among the largest invertebrate in the world and a true Polar giant. Squid makes up most of the diet of some animals, such as grey-headed albatrosses and sperm whales, and the warty squid (Moroteuthis ingens) is one of the subantarctic's most preyed upon species by vertebrates. =Other marine invertebrates= Underwater in McMurdo Sound, including the sea urchin Sterechinus neumayeri, brittle star Ophionotus victoriae, scallop Adamussium colbecki and other animals The red Antarctic sea urchin (Sterechinus neumayeri) has been used in several studies and has become a model organism. This is by far the best-known sea urchin of the region, but not the only species. Among others, the Southern Ocean is also home to the genus Abatus that burrow through the sediment eating the nutrients they find in it. Several species of brittle stars and sea stars live in Antarctic waters, including the ecologically important Odontaster validus and the long-armed Labidiaster annulatus that even may catch small swimming fish. Two species of salps are common in Antarctic waters, Salpa thompsoni and Ihlea racovitzai. Salpa thompsoni is found in ice-free areas, whereas Ihlea racovitzai is found in the high latitude areas near ice. Due to their low nutritional value, they are normally only eaten by fish, with larger animals such as birds and marine mammals only eating them when other food is scarce. Several species of marine worms are found in the Southern Ocean, including Parborlasia corrugatus and Eulagisca gigantea, which at lengths up to and respectively are examples of Polar gigantism. Like several other marine species of the region, Antarctic sponges are long-lived. They are sensitive to environmental changes due to the specificity of the symbiotic microbial communities within them. As a result, they function as indicators of environmental health. The largest is the whitish or dull yellowish Anoxycalyx joubini, sometimes called the giant volcano sponge in reference to its shape. It can reach a height of and is an important habitat for several smaller organisms. Long-term observation of individuals of this locally common glass sponge revealed no growth, leading to suggestions of a huge age, perhaps up to 15,000 years (making it one of the longest-lived organisms). However, more recent observations have revealed a highly variable growth rate where individuals seemingly could lack any visible growth for decades, but another was observed to increase its size by almost 30% in only two years and one reached a weight of in about 20 years or less. Jellyfish are also found there, with 2 examples being the Ross Sea jellyfish and the cobweb jellyfish or giant Antarctic jellyfish. The former is small, at in diameter, while the latter can have 1 metre bell diameter and 5-metre-long tentacles. Fungi Fungal diversity in Antarctica is lower than in the rest of the world. Individual niches, determined by environmental factors, are filled by very few species. Roughly 1150 fungi species have been identified. Lichens account for 400 of these, while 750 are non-lichenised. Only around 20 species of fungi are macroscopic. The non-lichenised species come from 416 different genera, representing all major fungi phyla. The first fungi identified from the sub- antarctic islands was Peziza kerguelensis, which was described in 1847. In 1898 the first species from the mainland, Sclerotium antarcticum, was sampled. Far more terrestrial species have been identified than marine species. Larger species are restricted to the sub-antarctic islands and the Antarctic Peninsula. Parasitic species have been found in ecological situations different from the one they are associated with elsewhere, such as infecting a different type of host. Less than 2-3% of species are thought to be endemic. Many species are shared with areas of the Arctic. Most fungi are thought to have arrived in Antarctica via airborne currents or birds. The genus Thelebolus for example, arrived on birds some times ago, but have since evolved local strains. Of the non-lichenised species of fungi and closer relatives of fungi discovered, 63% are ascomycota, 23% are basidiomycota, 5% are zygomycota, and 3% are chytridiomycota. The myxomycota and oomycota make up 1% each, although they are not true fungi. The desert surface is hostile to microscopic fungi due to large fluctuations in temperature on the surface of rocks, which range from 2 ¬∞C below the air temperature in the winter to 20 ¬∞C above air temperature in the summer. However, the more stable nanoenvironments inside the rocks allow microbial populations to develop. Most communities consist of only a few species. The most studied community occurs in sandstone, and different species arrange themselves in bands at different depths from the rock surface. Microscopic fungi, especially yeasts, have been found in all antarctic environments. Antarctica has around 400 lichen species, plants and fungi living symbiotically. They are highly adapted, and can be divided into three main types; crustose lichens, forming thin crusts on the surface, foliose lichens, forming leaf-like lobes, and fructicose lichens, which grow like shrubs. Species are generally divided between those found on the subantarctic islands, those found on the Peninsula, those found elsewhere on the mainland, and those with disjointed distribution. The furthest south a lichen has been identified is 86¬∞30'. Growth rates range from every 100 years in the more favourable areas to every 1000 years in the more inhospitable areas, and usually occurs when the lichen are protected from the elements with a thin layer of snow, which they can often absorb water vapour from. Lichens Macrolichens (e.g., Usnea sphacelata, U. antarctica, Umbilicaria decussate, and U. aprina) and communities of weakly or non-nitrophilous lichens (e.g., Pseudephebe minuscula, Rhizocarpon superficial, and R. geographicum, and several species of Acarospora and Buellia) are relatively widespread in coastal ice-free areas. Sites with substrates influenced by seabirds are colonized by well-developed communities of nitrophilous lichen species such as Caloplaca athallina, C. citrina, Candelariella flava, Lecanora expectans, Physcia caesia, Rhizoplaca melanophthalma, Xanthoria elegans, and X. mawsonii. In the Dry Valleys the normally epilithic lichen species (Acarospora gwynnii, Buellia frigida, B. grisea, B. pallida, Carbonea vorticosa, Lecanora fuscobrunnea, L. cancriformis, and Lecidella siplei) are found primarily in protected niches beneath the rock surface occupying a cryptoendolithic ecological niche. Lichen species identified in recent research: *Acarospora spp. **Acarospora gwynnii *Buellia spp. **Buellia frigida **Buellia grisea **Buellia pallida *Caloplaca athallina *Caloplaca citrina *Candelariella flava *Carbonea vorticosa (form. Carbonea capsulata) *Lecanora cancriformis *Lecanora expectans *Lecanora fuscobrunnea *Lecidella siplei (form. Lecidea siplei) *Physcia caesia *Pseudephebe minuscula *Rhizocarpon geographicum *Rhizocarpon superficial *Rhizoplaca melanophthalma *Umbilicaria aprina *Umbilicaria decussate *Usnea antarctica *Usnea sphacelata *Xanthoria elegans *Xanthoria mawsonii Plants The widespread Ceratodon purpureus is a moss that inhabits areas around the globe, and reaches as far south as 84¬∞30'. The greatest plant diversity is found on the western edge of the Antarctic Peninsula. Coastal algal blooms can cover up to of the peninsula. Well-adapted moss and lichen can be found in rocks throughout the continent. The subantarctic islands are a more favourable environment for plant growth than the mainland. Human activities, especially whaling and sealing, have caused many introduced species to gain a foothold on the islands, some quite successfully. Some plant communities exist around fumaroles, vents emitting steam and gas that can reach at around below the surface. This produces a warmer environment with liquid water due to melting snow and ice. The active volcano Mount Erebus and the dormant Mount Melbourne, both in the continent's interior, each host a fumarole. Two fumaroles also exist on the subantarctic islands, one caused by a dormant volcano on Deception Island in the South Shetland Islands and one on the South Sandwich Islands. The fumarole on Deception Island also supports moss species found nowhere else in Antarctica. Antarctic Pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis), one of two flowering plant species in Antarctica. The bryophytes of Antarctica consist of 100 species of mosses, and about 25 species of liverworts. While not being as widespread as lichens, they remain ubiquitous wherever plants can grow, with Ceratodon purpureus being found as far south as 84¬∞30' on Mount Kyffin. Unlike most bryophytes, a majority of Antarctic bryophytes do not enter a diploid sporophyte stage, instead they reproduce asexually or have sex organs on their gametophyte stage. Only 30% of bryophytes on the Peninsular and subantarctic islands have a sporophyte stage, and only 25% of those on the rest of the mainland produce sporophytes. The Mount Melbourne fumarole supports the only Antarctic population of Campylopus pyriformis, which is otherwise found in Europe and South Africa. Subantarctic flora is dominated by the coastal tussock grass, that can grow up to . Only two flowering plants inhabit continental Antarctica, the Antarctic hair grass (Deschampsia antarctica) and the Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis). Both are found only on the western edge of the Antarctic Peninsula and on two nearby island groups, the South Orkney Islands and the South Shetland Islands. Mosses The moss species Campylopus pyriformis is restricted to geothermal sites. Moss species identified in recent research: *Anomobryum subrotundifolium *Bryoerythrophyllum recurvirostre *Bryum anomobryum *Bryum pseudotriquetrum *Campylopus pryiformis *Cephaloziella varians *Ceratodon purpureus *Didymodon brachyphyllus *Grimmia plagiopodia *Hennediella heimii *Pohlia nutans *Sarconeurum glaciale *Schistidium antarctici (form. Grimmia antarctici) *Syntrichia princeps Others Bacteria have been revived from Antarctic snow hundreds of years old. They have also been found deep under the ice, in Lake Whillans, part of a network of subglacial lakes that sunlight does not reach. A wide variety of algae are found in Antarctica, often forming the base of food webs. About 400 species of single-celled phytoplankton that float in the water column of the Southern Ocean have been identified. These plankton bloom annually in the spring and summer as day length increases and sea ice retreats, before lowering in number during the winter. Other algae live in or on the sea ice, often on its underside, or on the seabed in shallow areas. Over 700 seaweed species have been identified, of which 35% are endemic. Outside of the ocean many algae are found in freshwater both on the continent and on the subantarctic islands. Terrestrial algae, such as snow algae, have been found living in soil as far south as 86¬∞ 29'. Most are single-celled. In summer algal blooms can cause snow and ice to appear red, green, orange, or grey. These blooms can reach about 106 cells per mL. The dominant group of snow algae is chlamydomonas , a type of green algae. The largest marine algae are kelp species, which include bull kelp (Durvillaea antarctica), which can reach over long and is thought to be the strongest kelp in the world. As many as 47 individual plants can live on , and they can grow at a day. Kelp that is broken off its anchor provides a valuable food source for many animals, as well as providing a method of oceanic dispersal for animals such as invertebrates to travel across the Southern Ocean by riding floating kelp. Conservation An individual with velvet-covered antlers from the southern herd of the introduced reindeer in South Georgia. Human activity poses significant risk for Antarctic wildlife, causing problems such as pollution, habitat destruction, and wildlife disturbance. These problems are especially acute around research stations. Climate change and its associated effects pose significant risk to the future of Antarctica's natural environment. Due to the historical isolation of Antarctic wildlife, they are easily outcompeted and threatened by introduced species, also brought by human activity. Many introduced species have already established themselves, with rats a particular threat, especially to nesting seabirds whose eggs they eat. Illegal fishing remains an issue, as overfishing poses a great threat to krill and toothfish populations. Toothfish, slow-growing, long-lived fish that have previously suffered from overfishing, are particularly at risk. Illegal fishing also brings further risks through the use of techniques banned in regulated fishing, such as gillnetting and longline fishing. These methods increase the bycatch of animals such as albatrosses. Subantarctic islands fall under the jurisdiction of national governments, with environmental regulation following the laws of those countries. Some islands are in addition protected through obtaining the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Antarctic Treaty System regulates all activity in latitudes south of 60¬∞S, and designates Antarctica as a natural reserve for science. Under this system all activity must be assessed for its environmental impact. Part of this system, the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, regulates fishing and protects marine areas.

Biography His father was a priest. When he was ten, the family moved to Zealand and he attended the Herlufsholm School for six years.Biographical notes @ Kunstindeks Danmark. There, his drawing skills were noticed by the painter, Georg Hilker, who took him to Copenhagen as his apprentice. While there, he attended classes taught by P.C. Skovgaard at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, but was never formally admitted. This was the occasion, however, for making the acquaintance of Godfred Christensen, who aroused his interest in landscape painting. He began by painting en plein aire with his friend Karl Jensen, and they mutually influenced each other's styles, although Jensen would come to focus on interior paintings. His first major showing was at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition of 1878. This led to a sale of his work \\"Watering Hole Outside a Farmhouse\\" to the Kunstforeningen; an organization that would become a regular customer. He took a brief trip to Paris in 1880 then, thanks to a small stipend from the Academy, visited the Tyrol and Italy. In 1883, he was awarded the .

(, kto kogo?; ) is a Bolshevist principle or slogan which was formulated by Lenin in 1921. Lenin is supposed to have stated at the second All-Russian Congress of Political Education Departments, on 17 October 1921, : :\\"The whole question is‚Äîwho will overtake whom?\\" Leon Trotsky used the shortened \\"who whom\\" formulation in his 1925 article, \\"Towards Capitalism or Towards Socialism?\\" The shortened form was invoked by Joseph Stalin in 1929, in a speech to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which also gave the formula its \\"aura of hard-line coercion\\" (while Lenin's phrase indicated a willingness to embrace economic competition): :\\"The fact is, we live according to Lenin's formula: Kto‚Äìkogo?: will we knock them, the capitalists, flat and give them (as Lenin expresses it) the final, decisive battle, or will they knock us flat?\\" Stalin, Sochineniia, (Moscow: Izdatel'stvo politicheskoi literatury, 1947‚Äì52), vol. xii, p. 37, see also vol. xii, p. 144. See \\"Soviet culture and foreign policy\\", Cambridge history of Russia, volume 3, p. 46. \\"Stalin presented the mass collectivisation of 1929‚Äì30 as the triumphal outcome of Lenin's kto‚Äìkogo scenario. Kto‚Äìkogo acquired its aura of hard-line coercion from Stalin's use of it during this period: 'we live by the formula of Lenin ‚Äì kto‚Äìkogo: will we knock them, the capitalists, flat and give them (as Lenin expresses it) the final, decisive battle, or will they knock us flat?' Yet Stalin's claim to embody the original spirit of kto‚Äìkogo contains some paradoxes. Lenin and the Bolshevik leaders who picked up on his phrase had used kto‚Äìkogo to justify an economic competition with the Nepmen who dominated trade activities ‚Äì a competition that would result in new forms of agricultural production only after an extremely high level of industrial technology was available. Stalin used kto‚Äìkogo to justify a policy of mass coercion against peasant kulaks to implement collective farms long before industry reached a high level.\\" It came to be used as a formula describing the inevitability of class struggle, i.e. who (which of two antagonists) will dominate the other. In this view, all compromises and promises between enemies are just expedients ‚Äì tactical manoeuvres in the struggle for mastery.

Arctic was briefly employed as a convoy escort during the war and later used to tow targets and transport ammunition. She was returned to commercial service in 1919.  Service history  Arctic was built by Hall Bros. at Eagle Harbor, Washington, in 1913. She was inspected by the Navy on 17 October 1917 and found to be suitable for naval service. Accordingly, her owner, the Independent Asphalt Paving Co., of Seattle, Washington, delivered the tug to the Navy on 4 December 1917. Fitted out at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, and designated SP-1158, Arctic was placed in commission there on 15 January 1918, LTJG Ernest G. Heinrici, USNRF, in command. After escorting the submarine chaser to San Diego, Arctic towed two coal barges through the Panama Canal and proceeded to Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she arrived early in May and began preparations for \\"distant service.\\" Assigned to Division 11, Patrol Force, Arctic departed New London, Connecticut, on 18 May as one of the escorts for a convoy that included 27 submarine chasers. After shepherding her charges to Bermuda, the tug proceeded on to Ponta Delgada, in the Azores, on escort duty before returning to New London in mid-August 1918. For the remainder of the year, she operated between New London, the Azores, and Bermuda. Assigned then to the Fleet Train, Arctic operated with the Atlantic Fleet from February to May 1919, towing targets during gunnery exercises out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and transporting ammunition within the waters of the 5th Naval District. After proceeding from that port to Havana, Arctic was decommissioned on 8 July 1919, simultaneously stricken from the Naval Vessel Register, and turned over to the M. J.

History The project was initiated by Frankfurt's mayor Ludwig Landmann, who hired the architect Ernst May as a general manager of many communal departments. Renowned architects like Max Cetto, Martin Elsaesser, Walter Gropius, Ferdinand Kramer, Adolf Meyer, Bruno Taut, Margarete Sch√ºtte-Lihotzky and Mart Stam worked in Frankfurt. Under May 12,000 apartments were built, 2,000 more than planned. The buildings not only met the basic needs of housing, they set standards for urban development and design but also broke with house building tradition. All apartments and mansions were equipped with a Frankfurt kitchen. Catherine Bauer Wurster visited the buildings in 1930 and was inspired by the work of May.Leill Levine: Frank Lloyd Wright: Modern Architecture: Being the Kahn Lectures for 1930, 2008 pg.ix Nazi critics denigrated the project as ‚ÄúMr May's small Soviet industry‚ÄùFassil Demissie: Colonial Architecture and Urbanism in Africa, 2011 pg.374 and Joseph Goebbels called Ernst May the ‚ÄúLenin of German architecture‚Äù, even if it is told that he loved the modern architecture. The Nazis stopped all construction activities and presented the estates to foreign visitors as their own new Nationalsocialist architecture. Most employees of the project left Germany after 1933, some of them followed Ernst May to the Soviet Union, which invited teams of famous architects, like Le Corbusier and from the Bauhaus to work there. After some demolitions of houses designed by Mart Stam and protest, the estates were declared protected landmarks in the late 1970s. One two-storey terrace house was renovated and restored into the standard of 1928 by the Ernst May Society, it is called the Ernst May House and is a museum today. The reconstruction was underpinned by research by architectural historians.

Nottinghamshire, Nikolaus Pevsner in East Retford. History Stained glass window in St Swithun's, East Retford St Swithun's is a Grade II* listed church in Retford that is dedicated to St Swithun and which was founded in 1258. The church is located in the centre of town between Churchgate and Chapelgate. The current building is of cruciform shape, now mainly of perpendicular architecture, but still preserving in its south and west doorways, and in the tracery of some of its windows, marks of earlier styles. The church has a square, battlemented tower, containing a clock and 10 bells. The oldest, virtually untouched, part is the north transept, although it has now been transformed into a chapel as a war memorial. The tower is supported by four massive arches and the nave and aisles are separated by arcades of five bays. There is a stone pulpit, an eagle lectern in oak, and a large organ erected in 1841. In the north transept is an incised slab to Henry Smyth (d 1496) and Sir Whatton Amcotts (d 1807) by William Kinnard, architect. The Victorian stained glass includes work by Clayton and Bell, Charles Eamer Kempe, Michael O‚ÄôConnor, Hardman & Co, William Wailes and George Shaw. The figure over the southern door is locally said to be of St Swithun, but according to Kidson is of a bishop. He says the figure was brought from a dissolved monastery in Portugal and was given to the Church, and placed in its present position, in about 1895. The British Museum contains several architectural drawings of East Retford Church by Samuel Hieronymous Grimm. These include a general view of the exterior, and a drawing of the tracery of the east window. There are also drawings by Thomas Kerrich (1748-1828) including a drawing of a window which used to be in the Chancel, but which no longer exists. John Buckler (1770-1851) made several drawings of the church, including one of the figure in the vesica piscis, at the beginning of the nineteenth century. While the church dates from the 13th century, in 1528 there was a great fire in Retford which damaged the church. In 1535, we learn that: \\"Where sumtyme were iiii chauntries which now er in decaye by reason they er consumed wt. fyer.\\" The tower and chancel collapsed in 1651 and were rebuilt in 1658. The current building is therefore largely the work of restorers. The pinnacles were added to the tower in 1810. G.G. Place undertook further restorations between 1852 and 1855. The Chantry Chapel was rebuilt by George Frederick Bodley in 1873. There was a further restoration in 1905.

These conversations took place during the prosecution of the accused for alleged war crimes during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. According to The Economist, the recordings and emails suggested that the Bangladesh Government pressured and attempted to intervene in the International Crimes Tribunal to speed up proceedings. The neutrality and independence of Huq was called into question, as Ziauddin appeared to help him to prepare documents for the tribunal and made detailed recommendations for Huq. Ziauddin also advised prosecutors, including the chief prosecutor Zaed- al-Malum, and informed Huq about how the prosecutors may develop their cases. This resulted in a connection between the judge, adviser and the prosecution. The 17 hours of conversations between 28 August and 20 October 2012 and more than 230 e-mails between September 2011 and September 2012 were disclosed to The Economist. The Bangladeshi newspaper Amar Desh also received the conversations, and published a report on 9 December, followed by the transcripts in full. On 13 December, a court injunction banned Bangladeshi newspapers from publishing the materials, at which time Amar Desh stopped further publication. On 11 December 2012, Huq resigned from his position as chairman of ICT-1, citing personal reasons. Despite demands from Jamaat-e- Islami for the Tribunal to be scrapped, the Law Minister Shafique Ahmed said that Huq's resignation would not hamper trial proceedings. On 13 December, Fazle Kabir, then head of the second tribunal (ICT-2), was named as the new chairman. The defendants' applications for retrials were rejected. Key figures * Justice Mohammed Nizamul Huq, chair of the International Crimes Tribunal * Ahmed Ziauddin, a Bangladeshi expatriate lawyer based in Brussels, longtime colleague of Huq * The Economist and journalists Rob Gifford and Adam Roberts * Mahmudur Rahman, editor of Amar Desh * Guardian Consulting LLC, a US-based security firm Background The International Crimes Tribunal was set up in Bangladesh in 2009 to prosecute suspects accused of war crimes during the Bangladesh Liberation War. The Awami League had pledged to do so in the campaign for the 2008 election. Between 2010 and 2012, the tribunal indicted eleven men as suspects; they are now political leaders, nine from Jamaat-e-Islami, two from the BNP and zero from the Awami League. At the time of the Skype controversy, the trials of Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, Motiur Rahman Nizami and Ghulam Azam were underway at ICT-1 and the trial of Delwar Hossain Sayeedi had nearly finished. On 6 December 2012, the presiding judge of ICT-1, Mohammed Nizamul Huq, passed an order requiring two members of The Economist to appear before the court, demanding that they explain how they came into possession of e-mails and conversations between him and lawyer Ziauddin. This order came after The Economist contacted Huq about the material they had. The order named Ahmed Ziauddin as an expert assisting the judges, explaining that the judges needed research support as the tribunal is based on new law. On 9 December, the newspaper Amar Desh began publishing reports and transcripts of the conversations, and The Economist published a further report on 15 December. Revelations According to The Economist, the Skype conversations and e-mails suggested that the Bangladesh Government pressured and attempted to intervene in the International Crimes Tribunal to speed proceedings up. During a conversation between Huq and Ziauddin on 14 October, Huq referred to the government as > Absolutely crazy for a judgment. The government has gone totally mad. They > have gone completely mad, I am telling you. They want a judgment by 16th > December (Victory Day)...it's as simple as that. On 15 October, Huq described how a member of the government \\"came to visit me this evening. He asked me to pass this verdict fast. I told him 'how can I do that?'... He said, 'Try as quick as you can.'\\" The Economist also reported the communications revealed Brussels-based lawyer Ziauddin's influence in the trial. Between 28 August and 20 October, the two men spoke for the equivalent of almost 20 minutes every day. Ziauddin appeared to help Huq prepare documents. On 12 May, Ziauddin sent Huq a document called \\"GhulamAzamChargesFinalDraft\\", and the next day the tribunal issued an identical document as its indictment against Ghulam Azam. Ziauddin also advised Huq on the future of Huq's fellow judge Shahinur Islam, saying, \\"If he does not stop he has to go as well, because it is so harmful to us.\\" The Economist further adds that the conversations reveal that Ziauddin discussed the same issues with the judge and the prosecutors, including the chief prosecutor Zaed-al-Malum. On 11 December 2011 he sent Malum and another prosecutor help on the case against Azam and forwarded this advice to Huq. After the prosecutors laid their charges, Ziauddin continued to advise Huq on the accusations. During the conversations, one or both of the men referred to Justice Jahangir Hossain as \\"corrupt.\\" Before Justice Huq resigned, Hossain gave an emotional speech in court in his own defence (Huq was absent). Hossain objected to Huq and Ziauddin's characterisation of him. He also objected to Amar Desh's coverage of the Skype conversations. Hossain said he had been appointed to sit on a case that involved Mahmudur Rahman (now editor of Amar Desh) while he had been appointed as Energy Advisor in the BNP government. Hossain said that Rahman should not have included his name in a large headline. Ahmed Ziauddin Ahmed Ziauddin is a Bangladeshi lawyer and academic specializing in international courts of law, who lives and works in Brussels, Belgium. He was born in Dhaka, then part of East Pakistan, where he went to college and law school, and his brother was a friend of Mohammed Nizamul Huq. They have known each other for many years. Ziauddin is a professor of international law at Catholic University of Brussels, where he is the full-time director of the Bangladesh Centre for Genocide Studies. The center campaigns to end what he has called \\"the ingrained culture of impunity\\" regarding the 1971 war crimes in Bangladesh. Ziauddin is also known for his advocacy of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court as he lobbied Asian governments to sign and ratify the treaty Ziauddin was affiliated since 2001 as coordinator for the Asian Network of the Coalition for the International Criminal Court (CICC) and its efforts to lobby United Nations- member countries to sign the Rome Statute that established by treaty the International Criminal Court. He worked to get Asian countries, such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, to sign and then ratify the treaty Bangladesh signed and then ratified in 2010. In that same year, Bangladesh's ratification of the Rome Statute made possible its establishment of Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal. His lobbying of Bangladesh for the Rome Treaty was also connected to his desire to see the war crimes trial take place there. He said previous governments in Bangladesh had not dealt with the war crimes. He also wrote that the International Criminal Court did not negate the role of nations; he wrote, \\"The ICC is only a complementary court. It is intended to supplement national courts, which are primarily responsible to try war crimes, crimes against humanity and acts of Genocide.\\" He also said that the Rome Statute would protect the country; he said, \\"As Bangladesh works to address impunity for past crimes and re-establish the rule of law, joining the ICC will help ensure that grave crimes are not committed in the future.\\" During the war crimes trial, Ziauddin advised lead Justice Nizamul Huq. He also drafted charges against one of the accused, Ghulam Azam. Weeks before the Skype controversy came to public light, Ziauddin attended a conference at the Assembly of States Parties of the International Criminal Court at The Hague in November 2012 where Toby Cadman, who is the defense attorney for the accused in Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal and the most high-profile critic of the process. Cadman presented a paper that linked the Rome Statute with the problems of the ICT: \\"lack of transparency; discriminatory intent of the legislation and tribunal; lack of clear definitions of crimes; absence of rules of disclosure; and investigations being conducted under a cloak of secrecy.\\" Ziauddin described his professional relationship with Huq in The Economist as follows: After the disclosure of their conversations came to light, Ziauddin was also called before Bangladesh's war crimes court to answer for his participation, a case which is in progress. Aftermath On 11 December 2012, Huq resigned from his position as chairman of ICT-1, citing personal reasons. Despite demands from Jamaat-e-Islami for the tribunal to be scrapped, the Law Minister Shafique Ahmed said that Huq's resignation would not hamper trial proceedings. He said that Huq had in no way behaved improperly and had the right to consult with experts in the law. On 13 December, Fazle Kabir, then head of the second tribunal (ICT-2), was named as the new chairman. On 19 December, the defence submitted applications for a retrial. A petition was also filed to remove the chief prosecutor Zaed-al- Malum. Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, BNP MP on trial at ICT-1, demanded adjournment of his case until the petition was settled. On 3 January, the defendants' applications for retrials were rejected. The editor of Amar Desh, Mahmudur Rahman, was arrested on remand on 11 April 2013 for a number of charges, including sedition for publishing the Skype material, as well as other reporting from Amar Desh about the 2013 Shahbag protests. The Asian Human Rights Commission reports that they are informed that Rahman has been tortured in police custody.

The vessel was also used for occasional excursions and other duties through the rest of the year. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Ice Boat No. 3 was briefly commissioned into the U.S. Navy as the coastal patrol vessel USS Arctic, before returning to her normal duties under her original name. Ice Boat No. 3 was sunk in a collision with an underwater obstruction in February 1905.  Construction and design  In the early 1870s, the City of Philadelphia decided that its two existing icebreakers were not sufficient to keep Philadelphia's waterways free of ice, and that a third would be required. Accordingly, the council ordered a new vessel from the recently established iron shipbuilding firm of Wood, Dialogue & Co. of Camden, New Jersey. The new boat, an iron-hulled sidewheel icebreaker named City Ice Boat No. 3, cost $245,000 and was launched at Kaighn's Point, New Jersey, on 5 November 1873.Childs, p. 25. City Ice Boat No.3 had a length of 201 feet 6 inches, a beam of 33 feet 5 inches and a draft of 13 feet 6 inches. She had a gross register tonnage of 637.2 tons (326.42 tons net)United States Govt. 1885, p. 314. and a displacement of 1,537 tons. Photos taken during the vessel's naval service indicate that she was a double- ender, with a smaller pilothouse astern. Her powerplant--a steam engine of the horizontal direct-acting typeSilverstone, p. 76.--was rated at a nominal horsepower of 500. It is not known what icebreaking features were incorporated into her design, but she is known to have been capable of making unusually sharp turns. She was the largest of the city's three icebreakers, the only one with an electric generating plant and electric lighting, and throughout her career was considered the best of the three.  Service history  Apart from special occasions, the city's ice boats were usually only employed for two or three months of the year--through the winter months of December/January through February/March--being laid up for repair or refit the rest of the year. Though their primary role was to keep Philadelphia's channel to the sea free of ice, towing vessels endangered or hampered by ice was an important secondary task, which had the additional benefit of earning the city towage fees.  Municipal service, 1874-1898  Ice Boat No. 3s trial trip was scheduled for 31 January 1874, with Philadelphia's city council members invited to attend. Almost immediately thereafter, the ice boat entered service in the vicinity of New Castle, Delaware, towing two vessels, a bark bound for Hamburg and a brig for Matanzas, on 3 February. The following winter, No. 3 was again in service off New Castle, towing a bark bound for Bremen and another for Yokohama in early March. An 1877 painting depicting Ice Boat No. 3 on the Delaware, towing a sailing ship On 4 February 1881, Ice Boat No. 3, operating under the command of Captain Henry F. Virden near the Delaware Breakwater, went to the assistance of two pilot boats, Bavard and Knight, towing them into harbor, and later aided an imperilled lightship. That same day, the ice boat conducted a search for the abandoned bark Arundel, which was eventually located five miles offshore \\"in a dangerous position ... fast in the ice\\" and \\"with great difficulty\\" towed the vessel to the Breakwater harbor, arriving 11 pm. Later, the ice boat took aboard the crew of Arundel and resumed tow of the vessel, returning it to the port of Philadelphia on 8 February. Because the Arundel had been abandoned by its crew, the crew of Ice Boat No. 3 sued for salvage, the sum of $2,500 eventually being granted to them by the U.S. District Court.Members of the Bar. p. 146. On 10 January 1891, Ice Boat No. 3 was scheduled to tow the school ship Saratoga to sea from the port of Philadelphia, when a change of personnel aboard the ship necessitated a postponement. The following year, on December 28, the tug Crawford was caught in an ice floe at New Castle and \\"carried almost to Fort Delaware\\" where she was holed by a collision with the schooner Aaron Reppard, but was towed to shoal water to prevent sinking by Ice Boat No. 3. On January 20, 1893, Ice Boat No. 3 arrived at the Delaware Breakwater with the Reading Railroad steamer Panther in tow, which had experienced continual westerly winds and snowstorms since departing Newburyport, Massachusetts ten days earlier. Some weeks later, on the night of 7 February, Ice Boat No. 3 was towing the ship Standard past the Delaware Breakwater when the towing hawser broke, propelling the Standard into the Italian bark Giovanni anchored at the Breakwater and damaging the latter vessel to the amount of $4,000. The captain of Giovanni sued the City of Philadelphia for damages and won the ensuing court case, with the master of the ice boat found to have exercised \\"gross carelessness\\" for failing to see the Giovanni in time, and for his \\"sudden veering\\" manoeuvre which caused the hawser to catch on Standards bobstays and snap.Editorial Staff of the National Reporter System. p. 553. In July 1896, the navy organized training exercises for the Pennsylvania Naval Militia to be held aboard , which was anchored off the Delaware Breakwater for the purpose. Two of Philadelphia's ice boats, No. 2 and No. 3, were recommissioned to transport the militia from Philadelphia to the Indiana, with No. 2, commanded by Lt. Stout, embarking the Pittsburgh division consisting of 66 officers and men, and No. 3, under the command of Lt.-Commander Breed, embarking the 26 officers and 88 men of the Philadelphia division. The two ice boats departed Philadelphia on the 10th, arriving at the Breakwater on the 11th where they anchored. The militiamen apparently remained aboard the ice boats until the 14th when they were taken aboard Indiana for several days of training, including gunnery, target, signals and boating practice, before being returned to the ice boats for the return journey to Philadelphia.United States Navy 1896, p. 130. The winter of 1897-98 was a mild one, with only two ice boats, No. 1 and No. 2, needed to keep the ice in check from 2 to 19 January, when they were stood down. The two returned to service on the 28th, and on 3 February, they were joined by Ice Boat No. 3. On 5 February, No. 2 and No. 3 were despatched to the assistance of the steamer Pennland, which had grounded near Tinicum Island. Pennland was refloated by No. 1 and No. 2 on 7 February. By mid-February, all three ice boats had been decommissioned, the last being Ice Boat No. 3, which was decommissioned on 15 February after only thirteen days of service for the season; two of No. 3s boilers were however kept under steam until 15 March. Due to rumours of impending war with Spain, all three boats were given a thorough overhaul after decommission.Warwick and Thompson, 1899, pp. 65-67.  Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War  USS Arctic, formerly Ice Boat No. 3, in mid-1898. This appears to be a stern view of the vessel, showing the smaller pilothouse. In March 1898, in anticipation of war with Spain, the U.S. Navy began preparations for the establishment of a Naval Auxiliary Force, known colloquially as the \\"mosquito fleet\\", for the defence of the United States East Coast. In the Delaware region, the Navy requested and received plans for the three Philadelphia ice boats, with a view to determining their suitability as patrol craft. The two older ice boats were deemed unsuitable, but Ice Boat No. 3 was accepted for service.Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pp. 330-331. On 23 April, Spain declared war on the United States in response to the latter's blockade of Cuba. On 5 May, Ice Boat No. 3, \\"in first-class working order\\", was transferred to the Navy,Warwick and Thompson, p. 68. and on 9 May, in a display of patriotic fervour, Philadelphia's city councillors voted to lease the ice boat to the Navy indefinitely for the nominal sum of one dollar.Warwick and Thompson, pp. 6-7. On 16 May, Ice Boat No. 3 was towed to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard at League Island for conversion to naval service.Warwick and Thompson, p.7. A couple of days later, naval officers at the yard reportedly described the vessel as slow, unwieldy, vulnerable to shellfire, and of little apparent use militarily. Regardless, the conversion proceeded, albeit at a less than urgent pace; she was still undergoing \\"repairs\\" at the yard as late as 18 June. The conversion work included the mounting of a 60-pounder breech loading gun--converted from a Civil War Parrott rifle--and two 47 mm guns. During the time the boat was undergoing conversion, rumours circulated that she would be sent to Cuba for use as a gunboat or blockade ship, but the Navy eventually confirmed her role as a Naval Auxiliary Force coastal patrol vessel with the Fourth Lighthouse District.Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, p. 332. Secretary of the Navy John Davis Long personally chose Ice Boat No. 3s commissioned name The converted ice boat was formally commissioned on 9 July 1898 as USS Arctic, the new name having been personally chosen by Secretary of the Navy John Davis Long;Warwick and Thompson, p. 69. she was the second U.S. Navy vessel to bear the name. The newly commissioned vessel was manned by six officers and 58 men from the Pennsylvania Naval Reserve, Philadelphia division,Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, p. 333. Lt. George C. Stout in command. Three additional crew members, from the Philadelphia City Ice Boat Department, were given temporary naval commissions as Assistant Engineer, First-class Machinist and Second- class Machinist respectively.Warwick and Thompson, pp. 68-69. USS Arctic appears to have made only one voyage for the Navy, to the Delaware Breakwater and back, via New Castle and Lewes, between 28 July and 16 August, but whether this constituted a formal patrol or some other mission is unclear. On 5 August she dragged anchor and stranded just inside Cape Henlopen during a gale. She was pulled off the beach by a tug without damage. Arctic was decommissioned on 23 August 1898, reconverted to her \\"original condition\\", and on 13 September, returned to the City Ice Boat Department, where she resumed her former title of Ice Boat No. 3. The three members of the Department given temporary naval commissions also received their discharges between 1 and 16 September and were reinstated in their previous positions. Following the cessation of hostilities between Spain and the United States in August, a \\"Peace Jubilee\\" including a naval review was held at the port of Philadelphia on 25 October. All three ice boats participated, with No. 1 and No. 2 placed at the disposal of the review committee and their guests, and Ice Boat No. 3 assigned to representatives of the press and their families.  Return to municipal service, 1899  = Icebreaking = The winter of 1899 on the Delaware began mildly,Ashbridge and Haddock 1900, pp. 497-498. but a cold snap and heavy snow falls from 7 February led to the rapid formation of thick ice. Ice Boats No. 1 and No. 2 were recommissioned on 8 February and Ice Boat No. 3 returned to service on the 10th. On Sunday 11 February, Ice Boat No. 3 was engaged in icebreaking all day during a snow storm. The following Tuesday, Ice Boat No. 3 set out from Philadelphia and Ice Boat No. 1 from New Castle, the ice having attained a thickness of \\"10 inches ... [with] 19 inches of snow on top\\".Ashbridge and Haddock 1900, p. 499. The two vessels met the next day off Fort Mifflin, having thus reopened the port. Ice Boat No. 3 then continued on to the Breakwater, there supplying the steamship Belgenland with 40 tons of coal, and towing to the Breakwater the oyster schooner Annie Cooney--abandoned off the Brandywine Light--before escorting several steamers to Philadelphia, arriving late on the 17th. On Sunday the 19th, the three ice boats collectively assisted sixteen steamers to arrive or depart the city's port.Ashbridge and Haddock 1900, pp. 499-500. With the weather improving, ice boats No. 1 and No. 2 were decommissioned on the 25th and 26th respectively and laid up. Ice Boat No. 3 was decommissioned on the 27th, though fires were retained under her boilers until 15 March, when she too was laid up, having spent a total of 18 days in commission through the winter.Ashbridge and Haddock 1900, pp. 500-501. = Dewey Day = was the centerpiece of Philadelphia's naval parade on \\"Dewey Day\\" The first of May was declared \\"Dewey Day\\" in the U.S., in honor of the first anniversary of Admiral George Dewey's victory over Spanish forces at Manila Bay, Philippines, the previous year. Celebrations were held throughout the United States, the largest of which took place in Philadelphia, where the state governor declared a public holiday and a naval parade on the Delaware was organized, featuring , the cruiser credited with firing the first shot in the Battle of Manila Bay. Ice Boat No. 3 was recommissioned for the day, embarking 475 passengersAshbridge and Haddock 1900, p. 500.--mostly city councillors and their friends-- from Arch Street at 1:15 pm and proceeding to League Island, the parade's designated starting point, where lunch was served aboard the boats. The parade set out at 2:30 pm with the tug McCaulley acting as flagship followed by two police boats; however, at the insistence of Commodore Adams, Ice Boat No. 3 was given pride of place behind McCaulley due to the former's complement of councillors. The parade then steamed upriver to the Arch Street wharf where it circled the anchored Raleigh, to the cheers of thousands of onlookers ashore, after which guests from the various watercraft were invited aboard the cruiser for an inspection. Festivities ended about 4:15, about which time Ice Boat No. 3 returned her passengers to their embarkation point before proceeding to her usual berth at the House of Corrections wharf, arriving there 6:15 pm. From 27 May to 1 June, Ice Boat No. 3 was drydocked at William Cramp & Sons, where her hull was cleaned and repainted. More repairs were made during the summer, including replacement of worn or defective hand rails and decking, and scaling and painting of the boiler room.Ashbridge and Haddock 1900, pp. 501-502. = Grand Army Day = The passenger steamboat Major Reybold, one of two steamboats involved in collisions with Ice Boat No. 3 on Grand Army Day, 1899 On 8 September, Ice Boat No. 3, along with the other two ice boats, participated in a naval parade in honor of the Grand Army of the Republic. Ice Boat No. 3, skippered by Captain Henry E. Melville, superintendent of the city ice boats,Hall et al, pp. 1-2 embarked guests from Pier 3, South Wharves at 10:30 am. While leaving the Chestnut Street dock to join the parade, No. 3 collided with the steamboat John A. Warner, striking the latter \\"about fifteen feet from her stern, cutting through her plank sheer and clear into her deck.\\" Declining to stop and inquire after damages, the ice boat continued up the river, where she suffered a second collision, this time with the passenger-cargo steamboat Major Reybold which had just reversed out of dock, damaging the ice boat's starboard guard and Major Reybolds stem. Again failing to stop, No. 3 continued on to the parade starting point at Fort Mifflin. After the parade was over, the guests were returned by the ice boat to Chestnut St. wharf about 4:15 pm, the vessel then continuing on to her usual berth at the House of Correction dock, arriving 6:15 pm. In a subsequent court case, the owners of Major Reybold sued for $1,425 in damages.Hall et al, p. 11. In October, all three ice boats had their hulls, upper and lower decks and smokestacks repainted.  1900-1901  On 20 June 1900, members of the Allied Republican Clubs were treated to a \\"complimentary river excursion\\" on the Delaware by local club members. A fleet of nine watercraft, including all three of the city's ice boats, was organized for the excursion, which began at 12:15 and included an inspection of the Cramp & Sons shipyard on the way to Holmesburg and Fort Mifflin. Onboard refreshments and music were provided for the excursionists, who were returned to their departure points at around 5 pm. The 1901 winter season began mildly, but a sudden drop in temperatures in February led to some of the worst conditions on the Delaware in memory. Ice Boat No. 3 was placed in commission on 5 February, the other two ice boats re-entering service on the 6th and 8th respectively. Ice Boat No. 3 spent most of the night of the 5th clearing ice in the Horseshoe, and on 7 February, No. 2 and No. 3 successfully refloated the steamer Switzerland, ashore on Chester Island. In the afternoon of 21 February No. 3 refloated the barge Baker, aground in the Shoe, and on 26 February refloated the ship Bengalore, ashore at Cherry Island Flats. The following day, the three ice boats worked together in the Horseshoe to free 21 vessels trapped in ice, and on 1 March, another 41 vessels were freed by the ice boats. With conditions rapidly improving, Ice Boat No. 1 was decommissioned on 6 March, followed by No. 2 and No. 3 on 7 and 9 March respectively, the crews of all three boats being paid and discharged and the boats returned to the City Ice Boat Dept. caretakers in accordance with standard procedure. Of the three ice boats, No. 3 spent the longest time in commission for the season, recording 34 days in full commission and another 40 days in commission with half crew.Ashbridge and Haddock 1902, pp. 619-622. In the summer off-season, Ice Boat No. 3 was again drydocked at the Cramp shipyard for the hull to be scraped and painted with red lead; the hull was found to be in good condition below the waterline. Minor repairs, including repairs to the donkey boiler, guards and rails were also completed by Neafie & Levy. The inner hull was scraped, sealed and coated with red lead during the summer by the Ice Boat Dept. caretakers, who also ground the engine valves, cleaned the boilers and \\"shedded over\\" the decks for protection from the summer sun. The Department's end-of-year annual report noted that the decks of all three ice boats required renewal, as they were leaking and had \\"been patched so often that but little of the original decks remain\\".Ashbridge and Haddock 1902, pp. 622-6 23.  1902-1904  The ice boats resumed work on the river in mid-January 1902 when Ice Boat No. 1 re-entered service, followed by No. 3 on 4 February and No. 2 on the 5th. On 6 February, Ice Boat No. 3 towed the bark Quivilly from Newcastle to the Breakwater, and the following day towed the bark Virginna Della Guardia to Newcastle on the return journey. Conditions on the river were at their most severe between 9 and 13 February, when the three ice boats operated together to assist no fewer than fifty vessels through the Horseshoe. The ice boats remained in continuous service until 24 February, No. 3 being decommissioned on 27 February and the other two the following day,Ashbridge and Haddock 1903, pp. 513-515. the three having been in service for the season a total of 38 days.Ashbridge and Haddock 1903, p. 79. Through the summer, the boats were again cleaned and repainted by their caretakers. Ice Boat No. 3 was also given an overhaul at the Neafie & Levy shipyard, which included repairs to her engine, boilers, guards, wheels and decks. The winter 1904 season arrived early, with the ice boat already in service by early January. On 8 January, during a snowstorm, Ice Boat No. 3, with the assistance of the tug Sommers N. Smith, refloated the Norwegian steamship Kate, which had gone ashore in Delaware Bay while outward bound from Philadelphia to Puerto Rico; Kate was towed the same day to Wilmington, Delaware, for repairs. On 10 February, Ice Boat No. 3 was sent to the assistance of several tugs attempting to refloat the British steamer Craigneuk, which had grounded near Reedy Island on her way from Leith to Philadelphia. Some time after the end of the 1904 winter season, the City Ice Boat Department requested permission from the city council to prepare plans for a $110,000 rebuild of Ice Boat No. 3 as \\"her boilers and hull were worn out\\" and she could not be expected to continue in service beyond the next winter.  1905  The winter of 1905 was a long and severe one on the Delaware. No. 3 was again the first of the ice boats to resume service, re- entering commission on 6 January with a full crew and being despatched immediately to Newcastle following a sudden fall in temperature two days earlier. On 8 January, No. 3 convoyed the cruiser from League Island to Reedy Island, and the following day Ice Boat No. 1 also returned to service, the two ice boats working more or less continuously until being joined by No. 2 on the 20th.Weaver and Acker, pp. 474-476. From this date, the three ice boats worked mostly on their regular stations until 4 February, assisting 44 vessels in this period, including 18 steamers on 3 February.Weaver and Acker, p. 477. = Loss = A breakwater in the National Harbor of Refuge At 5 am on 5 February, Ice Boat No. 3, under the command of Captain W. F. P. Jacobs, arrived at the Delaware Breakwater \\"under orders to convey a fleet of ice- bound steamers, tugs, barges and schooners up to Philadelphia.\\" In the National Harbor of Refuge between the two breakwaters, No. 3s paddlewheels became jammed by ice, and unable to maneouver, the vessel was dragged by the ice floes over a recently sunken barge, the Santiago, one of whose broken masts pierced the ice boat's hull below the waterline. Within minutes, water had extinguished No. 3s furnaces and the order was given to abandon ship. Unable to launch a lifeboat because of the surrounding ice, the crew were forced to leap for safety onto the ice floes, the ice boat sinking shortly thereafter, at about 6 am. Stranded on the floes, and in \\"imminent danger\\" of drifting out to sea, the ice boat's crew tried desperately for four hours to raise the alarm until finally being sighted from shore. Five tug boats, Gettysburg, Teaser, Bonner, Sommers Smith and North America were quickly sent to their aid, Gettysburg arriving first to pick up ten of the crew, while Teaser and Bonner picked up most of the rest. The remaining two crew members, who had become separated from the others, were rescued by the tug Sommers Smith. All 31 crew members were rescued, though the ice boat's firemen, thinly clothed for their work in the engine room, had suffered both steam scalds and exposure from the cold during their ordeal. Within days of the sinking, the Ice Boat Department had leased the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company's oceangoing tug International at the rate of $100 a day as a temporary replacement for Ice Boat No. 3.Weaver and Acker, pp. 473-474. From 5 February to the 27th, the three vessels employed by the Department assisted no fewer than 262 vessels through the ice, making a total of 306 vessels assisted through the season.Weaver and Acker, pp. 478-481. With the arrival of spring, arrangements were made for removal of the sunken barge Santiago and Ice Boat No. 3, both of which had become hazards to navigation, and contracts for removal of the two vessels were signed on 20 March.United States Govt. 1905, p. 1086. Removal of Santiago was completed by 11 April 1906 at a cost of $354.77; removal of the sunken ice boat proved more difficult and was completed 4 August 1905 for the sum of $5,168.97.United States Govt. 1906, p. 176. To replace Ice Boat No. 3, the Department ordered a modern icebreaker from William Cramp & Sons at a cost of $350,000. Said to be \\"the most powerful icebreaker ever constructed\\" in the United States, and able to do the work of two of the older ice boats combined, the new icebreaker, named John Weaver after the Mayor of Philadelphia, entered service in time for the winter of 1906.Weaver and Acker, p. xiv. The new icebreaker eventually became known as Ice Boat No. 3 after her predecessor.Reyburn and Stearns, p. 473.

Early life and work  Zimmerbild 96  Education  In 1806, he moved with his mother to Kassel, where he received his first drawing lessons. They returned to Berlin in 1813 and he took up a six-year apprenticeship at the Royal Porcelain Factory. Although many artists had begun their careers at the Factory, he felt that the instruction provided was superficial and took drawing classes at the Academy of Arts. In 1821, he accepted a position as a decorative painter in the studios of Carl Wilhelm Gropius, the Royal Court Theater painter, where he remained until 1825. During this time, he became increasingly attracted to architectural painting. He was able to finance a study trip to Paris by selling a portrait of King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia to the Royal family. While there, he acquired more skill in the manipulation of light and atmosphere, and was inspired by the magnificent vistas of medieval buildings to devote himself almost entirely to painting vedute. Rear view of the Houses at Schlo√üfreiheit  Successes  Upon his return to Berlin, he became a free-lance painter. In 1829, he married and ultimately had twelve children. Over the next ten years, he devoted himself to documenting the Biedermeier style buildings of Berlin and, with Royal customers in mind, produced a series of scenes depicting the castles in Bellevue, Charlottenburg and Glienicke. In 1833, he was admitted to the Academy and designated a \\"Perspective Painter\\". The following year, he began his most famous work: a six panel panorama of Berlin. It was painted from the roof of the Friedrichswerder Church, which is flat (and a popular place for sightseers, because all of the city's best-known buildings can be seen from there). This work was purchased by the King and a second version was bought by the King's daughter, Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna. Its purchase became the occasion for a trip to Moscow and St. Petersburg (1837‚Äì1838), during which Gaertner painted extensively.  His career in decline  In 1840, King Friedrich Wilhelm III died. His successor, Friedrich Wilhelm IV, preferred Italian-style paintings with Greek landscapes and bought very little from Gaertner who, without the income from his principal client, soon began to have financial difficulties. Parochialstra√üe, 1831 He eventually made contact with a group that was interested in the protection and restoration of monuments and needed to have an illustrated inventory of them. As a result, Gaertner travelled to villages and towns throughout Prussia, making watercolor sketches, including scenic views meant to be sold on his return to Berlin. By this means, he was able to attract some middle-class customers, but they proved to be no substitute for Royal patronage. He began to turn away from architecture, producing romantic scenes full of steep cliffs, Gypsies, ruins and oak trees, but never restored that patronage. His paintings from this period are generally considered to be inferior. As the century progressed, he increasingly suffered from competition with the newly emerging art of photography. In 1870, he and his family decided to leave the hectic atmosphere of Berlin and settle in Flecken Zechlin, a rural area near Rheinsberg. It was there that he died in 1877. His widow requested an annual allowance of 150 Marks from the Artist Support Fund of the Academy, but her application was denied. His works were virtually forgotten until the \\"Deutschen Jahrhundert-Ausstellung\\" of 1906, when they were shown again. Major exhibitions were staged in 1968, 1977 and 2001.  His method  It is believed that he made use of a camera obscura to sketch the layouts of his paintings. Although this is not expressly mentioned in his working notes, he does make oblique references to a \\"drafting machine\\" and some of his sketches are done on tracing paper. He also possessed a collection of photographs, but there is no indication that these were used as models.

Location  At above sea level, it is the highest building in Europe. It is also among the largest huts of the massif, together with the Monte Rosa Hut and Gnifetti Hut. The Margherita Hut is located in Italian territory , near the international border between Italy and Switzerland, in the Italian region of Piedmont. The nearest settlements is Alagna Valsesia, in Piedmont, starting point for the traditional climb to the hut. History The construction of the hut was directed by the Italian Alpine Club in 1889. The hut was pre-built in the valley, then brought to its final destination by mule and then by men, and assembled on site. It was opened on 18 August 1893, in the presence of Margherita of Savoy, Queen of Italy, to whom the hut is dedicated. The hut soon became an important research center for high-elevation medicine, under the direction of Angelo Mosso. As the hut was quite small, in 1907 a newer, lower research centre (\\"Istituto Mosso\\") was built near the Salati Pass, in Valsesia Valley (Alagna Valsesia), at an elevation of about . In 1899 a meteorological station was added. The lowest temperature registered was -41¬∞C in the winter 1928-1929; in the recent years the lowest was -37,5¬∞C registered on January the 25th 2005. A complete restoration started in 1977. The original hut was dismantled, and was replaced by the current hut, built in Valsesia in the town of Failungo Superiore, very close to Alagna Valsesia, which opened in 1980. Features The hut is owned by the central committee of the Italian Alpine Club (CAI), but it is managed by the local CAI section of Varallo Sesia. The hut is open in the summer, from early June to early September, the exact dates varying from year to year. It provides recuperation and accommodation, having 70 beds. In winter, there is an unmanaged winter facility with 12 beds. From summer 2017, the performance of civil marriage ceremonies within the Margherita Hut was authorised by the mayor of the nearest town, Alagna Valsesia. However, couples wishing to get married will be unable to arrive by helicopter, and will still have to make the long glacier hike via one of the normal mountaineering routes. Access The hut can only be accessed on foot. The traditional approach starts from Alagna Valsesia, the town where was organized the first ascent to the summit in 1842 realized by the parish priest of Alagna Valsesia, Giovanni Gnifetti. The walk to the hut usually takes two days; climbers spend a night at the Gnifetti Hut, the Monte Rosa Hut or the Resegotti Hut (from the last one the climb is very difficult and technical since you have to climb the Signal ridge), from where they set off for the Margherita Hut on the following morning. The walk requires physical fitness and a good knowledge of alpine techniques.

For generations the CU had defended humanity against hostile aliens, deliberately keeping Earth an ignorant backwater and a source of military recruits. Now the CU's secrets are known to all. Other alien races have come on the scene and formed a new alliance against the Colonial Union called the Conclave. They have invited the people of Earth to join them. For a shaken and betrayed Earth, the choice is not obvious or easy. Against such possibilities, managing the survival of the Colonial Union will not be easy, either. It will take diplomatic finesse and political cunning: the \\"B-Team\\" advised by Lieutenant Harry Wilson. As the story progresses, it deals with how humanity fares in a universe filled with other sentient races and without a growing military force to clash with them. Publication history The book was published at e-book retailers between 15 January and 9 April 2013 as digital serials with thirteen episodes.

Cineworld initially agreed to distribute the film for one week only in a limited number of screens across the UK, but due to unprecedented audience demand, extended the run while expanding to more venues. Plot Greek immigrant Harry Papadopoulos has got it all: a mansion house, awards and a super rich lifestyle as a successful entrepreneur reigning over a financial empire in the food industry. But when the banking crisis hits, Harry and his family - shy horticulturist James, snobby fashion victim Katie, and precocious child prodigy Theo - lose everything. Everything, except the dormant and forgotten Three Brothers Fish & Chip Shop half-owned by Harry's larger-than- life brother Spiros who's been estranged from the family for years. With no alternative, Harry and his family are forced to pack their bags and reluctantly join \`Uncle Spiros¬¥ to live above the neglected Three Brothers chippie. Together they set about bringing the chip shop back to life under the suspicious gaze of their old rival, Hassan, from the neighbouring Turkish kebab shop whose son has his own eyes on Katie. As each family member comes to terms with their new life, Harry struggles to regain his lost business empire. But as the chip shop returns to life, old memories are stirred and Harry discovers that only when you lose everything can you be free to find it all. Main cast * Stephen Dillane as Harry Papadopoulos * Georges Corraface as Uncle Spiros * Georgia Groome as Katie Papadopoulos * Frank Dillane as James Papadopoulos * Ed Stoppard as Rob * Cosima Shaw as Sophie * Selina Cadell as Mrs Parrington * Marcus Markou as News Reporter * Richard Durden as Father Jimmy * George Savvides as Hassan Ali * Cesare Taurasi as Mehmet Ali * Thomas Underhill as Theo * Alexander Hanson as Lars Production Papadopoulos & Sons was inspired by Marcus Markou's own family history and cultural roots, which fuelled his desire to focus on family unity: \\"I came from a very tight- knit Greek-Cypriot family\\", said the director. \\"However, as we grew older and grew up, my family, like so many other families, broke apart. I also lost so many of my Hellenic roots. In making the film I reached out to that sense of family that had been lost and I reached out to my Hellenic roots. [The film] is not about being Greek or Cypriot at all. I use that as backdrop. It really is about family unity at a difficult time\\". The film was shot in the London area. The crew found a street with two empty shops in Morden, South London, and took the lease on them. One became the chip shop The Three Brothers, the other the rival kebab shop. The bridge scene was filmed in Morden Hall Park. The city scenes were filmed in Central London and the mansion scenes in Croydon. Finally, the Papadopoulos factory was set in a real Greek food factory in East London. Reception Papadopoulos & Sons was awarded three stars out of five by The Guardian, which described the film as \\"an ambitious attempt to rewrite Lear for laughter rather than tears. It's a throwback, but relaxed, sweet and funny with it: a first feature that makes an impression by not pushing too hard to make an impression\\". The Daily Telegraph compared it to Raymond De Felitta's City Island and concluded that \\"it gets by almost wholly on hangdog charm, but that‚Äôs an underrated asset, and so is Dillane, delivering a terse and rueful performance that‚Äôs typically excellent.\\" On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 71% based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 5.73/10. It was shown at several film festivals across the world, including the annual Festival of British Cinema in Dinard, France, the Palm Springs International Film Festival, the Seattle International Film Festival and the Thessaloniki International Film Festival, where it received the Michael Cacoyannis Audience Award. It was also screened at the European Parliament in November 2012. In June 2013, the film was released in 70 cinemas in Germany, with almost 24,000 admissions during the first weekend. It was later screened in Nicosia, Cyprus for a week in late November 2013, with all proceeds being donated to a charity helping people who have been affected by the economic crisis. The film was later picked up for TV distribution in the UK, France, Germany, Greece and the Middle East. Director Marcus Markou was nominated for the \\"Breakthrough British filmmaker\\" award at the London Film Critics Circle Awards 2013 for his work on Papadopoulos & Sons.

The public system is essentially free for all Indian residents except for small, often symbolic co-payments in some services.https://www.commonwealthfund.org/international-health-policy- center/countries/india In 2019, the total net government spending on healthcare was $ 36 billion or 1.23 % of its GDP.‚Çπ2.6 trillion The Indian Constitution makes the provision of healthcare in India the responsibility of the state governments, rather than the central federal government. It makes every state responsible for \\"raising the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people and the improvement of public health as among its primary duties\\". Since the country's independence, the public healthcare system has been entirely funded through general taxation. The National Health Policy was endorsed by the Parliament of India in 1983 and updated in 2002, and then again updated in 2017. The recent four main updates in 2017 mentions the need to focus on the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, on the emergence of the robust healthcare industry, on growing incidences of unsustainable expenditure due to health care costs and on rising economic growth enabling enhanced fiscal capacity. In practice however, the private healthcare sector is responsible for the majority of healthcare in India, and most healthcare expenses are paid directly out of pocket by patients and their families, rather than through health insurance. Government health policy has thus far largely encouraged private-sector expansion in conjunction with well designed but limited public health programmes. A government-funded health insurance project was launched in 2018 by the Government of India, called Ayushman Bharat. This aimed to cover the bottom 50% of the country's population and offer them free treatment even at private hospitals. According to the World Bank, the total expenditure on health care as a proportion of GDP in 2015 was 3.89%. Out of 3.89%, the governmental health expenditure as a proportion of GDP is just 1%, and the out-of-pocket expenditure as a proportion of the current health expenditure was 65.06% in 2015. History  Healthcare system  Osmania General Hospital Hyderabad  Public healthcare  Public healthcare is free for every Indian resident.http://www.ipsnews.net/2020/07/pathway-universal-healthcare-india/ The Indian public health sector encompasses 18% of total outpatient care and 44% of total inpatient care. Middle and upper class individuals living in India tend to use public healthcare less than those with a lower standard of living. Additionally, women and the elderly are more likely to use public services. The public health care system was originally developed in order to provide a means to healthcare access regardless of socioeconomic status or caste. However, reliance on public and private healthcare sectors varies significantly between states. Several reasons are cited for relying on the private rather than public sector; the main reason at the national level is poor quality of care in the public sector, with more than 57% of households pointing to this as the reason for a preference for private health care. Much of the public healthcare sector caters to the rural areas, and the poor quality arises from the reluctance of experienced healthcare providers to visit the rural areas. Consequently, the majority of the public healthcare system catering to the rural and remote areas relies on inexperienced and unmotivated interns who are mandated to spend time in public healthcare clinics as part of their curricular requirement. Other major reasons are long distances between public hospitals and residential areas, long wait times, and inconvenient hours of operation. Different factors related to public healthcare are divided between the state and national government systems in terms of making decisions, as the national government addresses broadly applicable healthcare issues such as overall family welfare and prevention of major diseases, while the state governments handle aspects such as local hospitals, public health, promotion and sanitation, which differ from state to state based on the particular communities involved. Interaction between the state and national governments does occur for healthcare issues that require larger scale resources or present a concern to the country as a whole. Considering the goal of obtaining universal health care as part of Sustainable Development Goals, scholars request policy makers to acknowledge the form of healthcare that many are using. Scholars state that the government has a responsibility to provide health services that are affordable, adequate, new and acceptable for its citizens. Public healthcare is very necessary, especially when considering the costs incurred with private services. Many citizens rely on subsidized healthcare. The national budget, scholars argue, must allocate money to the public health sector to ensure the poor are not left with the stress of meeting private sector payments. Following the 2014 election which brought Prime Minister Narendra Modi to office, the government unveiled plans for a nationwide universal health care system known as the National Health Assurance Mission, which would provide all citizens with free drugs, diagnostic treatments, and insurance for serious ailments. In 2015, implementation of a universal health care system was delayed due to budgetary concerns. In April 2018 the government announced the Aayushman Bharat scheme that aims to cover up to Rs. 5 lakh to 100,000,000 vulnerable families (approximately 500,000,000 persons ‚Äì 40% of the country's population). This will cost around $1.7 billion each year. Provision would be partly through private providers. Private healthcare Since 2005, most of the healthcare capacity added has been in the private sector, or in partnership with the private sector. The private sector consists of 58% of the hospitals in the country, 29% of beds in hospitals, and 81% of doctors. Max Health hospital facility in Delhi, India According to National Family Health Survey-3, the private medical sector remains the primary source of health care for 70% of households in urban areas and 63% of households in rural areas. The study conducted by IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics in 2013, across 12 states in over 14,000 households indicated a steady increase in the usage of private healthcare facilities over the last 25 years for both Out Patient and In Patient services, across rural and urban areas. In terms of healthcare quality in the private sector, a 2012 study by Sanjay Basu et al., published in PLOS Medicine, indicated that health care providers in the private sector were more likely to spend a longer duration with their patients and conduct physical exams as a part of the visit compared to those working in public healthcare. However, the high out of pocket cost from the private healthcare sector has led many households to incur Catastrophic Health Expenditure, which can be defined as health expenditure that threatens a household's capacity to maintain a basic standard of living. Costs of the private sector are only increasing. One study found that over 35% of poor Indian households incur such expenditure and this reflects the detrimental state in which Indian health care system is at the moment. With government expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP falling over the years and the rise of private health care sector, the poor are left with fewer options than before to access health care services. Private insurance is available in India, as are various through government-sponsored health insurance schemes. According to the World Bank, about 25% of India's population had some form of health insurance in 2010. A 2014 Indian government study found this to be an over-estimate, and claimed that only about 17% of India's population was insured. Private healthcare providers in India typically offer high quality treatment at unreasonable costs as there is no regulatory authority or statutory neutral body to check for medical malpractices. In Rajasthan, 40% of practitioners did not have a medical degree and 20% have not completed a secondary education. On 27 May 2012, popular actor Aamir Khan's show Satyamev Jayate did an episode on \\"Does Healthcare Need Healing?\\" which highlighted the high costs and other malpractices adopted by private clinics and hospitals. In response to this, Narayana Health plans to conduct heart operations at a cost of $800 per patient. Medication In 1970, the Indian government banned medical patents. India signed the 1995 TRIPS Agreement which allows medical patents, but establishes the compulsory license, where any pharmaceutical company has the right to produce any patented product by paying a fee. This right was used in 2012, when Natco was allow to produce Nexavar, a cancer drug. In 2005, new legislation stipulated that a medicine could not be patented if it did not result in \\"the enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance\\". Indians consumed the most antibiotics per head in the world in 2010. Many antibiotics were on sale in 2018 which had not been approved in India or in the country of origin, although this is prohibited. A survey in 2017 found 3.16% of the medicines sampled were substandard and 0.0245% were fake. Those more commonly prescribed are probably more often faked. Some medications are listed on Schedule H1, which means they should not be sold without a prescription. Pharmacists should keep records of sales with the prescribing doctor and the patient's details. Access to healthcare As of 2013, the number of trained medical practitioners in the country was as high as 1.4 million, including 0.7 million graduate allopaths. Yet, India has failed to reach its Millennium Development Goals related to health. The definition of 'access is the ability to receive services of a certain quality at a specific cost and convenience. The healthcare system of India is lacking in three factors related to access to healthcare: provision, utilization, and attainment. Provision, or the supply of healthcare facilities, can lead to utilization, and finally attainment of good health. However, there currently exists a huge gap between these factors, leading to a collapsed system with insufficient access to healthcare. Differential distributions of services, power, and resources have resulted in inequalities in healthcare access. Access and entry into hospitals depends on gender, socioeconomic status, education, wealth, and location of residence (urban versus rural). Furthermore, inequalities in financing healthcare and distance from healthcare facilities are barriers to access. Additionally, there is a lack of sufficient infrastructure in areas with high concentrations of poor individuals. Large numbers of tribes and ex- untouchables that live in isolated and dispersed areas often have low numbers of professionals. Finally, health services may have long wait times or consider ailments as not serious enough to treat. Those with the greatest need often do not have access to healthcare. Institute of Medical Sciences in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. Electronic health records The Government of India, while unveiling the National Health Portal, has come out with guidelines for Electronic health record standards in India. The document recommends a set of standards to be followed by different healthcare service providers in India, so that medical data becomes portable and easily transferable. India is considering to set up a National eHealth Authority (NeHA) for standardisation, storage and exchange of electronic health records of patients as part of the government's Digital India programme. The authority, to be set up by an Act of Parliament will work on the integration of multiple health IT systems in a way that ensures security, confidentiality and privacy of patient data. A centralised electronic health record repository of all citizens which is the ultimate goal of the authority will ensure that the health history and status of all patients would always be available to all health institutions. Union Health Ministry has circulated a concept note for the setting up of NeHa, inviting comments from stakeholders.  Rural areas  Rural areas in India have a shortage of medical professionals. 74% of doctors are in urban areas that serve the other 28% of the population. This is a major issue for rural access to healthcare. The lack of human resources causes citizens to resort to fraudulent or ignorant providers. Doctors tend not to work in rural areas due to insufficient housing, healthcare, education for children, drinking water, electricity, roads and transportation. Additionally, there exists a shortage of infrastructure for health services in rural areas. In fact, urban public hospitals have twice as many beds as rural hospitals, which are lacking in supplies. Studies have indicated that the mortality risks before the age of five are greater for children living in certain rural areas compared to urban communities. Full immunization coverage also varies between rural and urban India, with 39% completely immunized in rural communities and 58% in urban areas across India. Inequalities in healthcare can result from factors such as socioeconomic status and caste, with caste serving as a social determinant of healthcare in India. = Case study in Rural India = A 2007 study by Vilas Kovai et al., published in the Indian Journal of Ophthalmology analyzed barriers that prevent people from seeking eye care in rural Andhra Pradesh, India. The results displayed that in cases where people had awareness of eyesight issues over the past five years but did not seek treatment, 52% of the respondents had personal reasons (some due to own beliefs about the minimal extent of issues with their vision), 37% economic hardship, and 21% social factors (such as other familial commitments or lacking an accompaniment to the healthcare facility). The role of technology, specifically mobile phones in health care has also been explored in recent research as India has the second largest wireless communication base in the world, thus providing a potential window for mobile phones to serve in delivering health care. Specifically, in one 2014 study conducted by Sherwin DeSouza et al. in a rural village near Karnataka, India, it was found that participants in community who owned a mobile phone (87%) displayed a high interest rate (99%) in receiving healthcare information through this mode, with a greater preference for voice calls versus SMS (text) messages for the healthcare communication medium. Some specific examples of healthcare information that could be provided includes reminders about vaccinations and medications and general health awareness information. = Rural north India = The distribution of healthcare providers varies for rural versus urban areas in North India. A 2007 study by Ayesha De Costa and Vinod Diwan, published in Health Policy, conducted in Madhya Pradesh, India examined the distribution of different types of healthcare providers across urban and rural Madhya Pradesh in terms of the differences in access to healthcare through number of providers present. The results indicated that in rural Madhya Pradesh, there was one physician per 7870 people, while there was one physician per 834 people in the urban areas of the region. In terms of other healthcare providers, the study found that of the qualified paramedical staff present in Madhya Pradesh, 71% performed work in the rural areas of the region. In addition, 90% of traditional birth attendants and unqualified healthcare providers in Madhya Pradesh worked in the rural communities. Studies have also investigated determinants of healthcare-seeking behavior (including socioeconomic status, education level, and gender), and how these contribute to overall access to healthcare accordingly. A 2016 study by Wameq Raza et al., published in BMC Health Services Research, specifically surveyed healthcare-seeking behaviors among people in rural Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, India. The findings of the study displayed some variation according to acute illnesses versus chronic illnesses. In general, it was found that as socioeconomic status increased, the probability of seeking healthcare increased. Educational level did not correlate to probability of healthcare- seeking behavior for acute illnesses, however, there was a positive correlation between educational level and chronic illnesses. This 2016 study also considered the social aspect of gender as a determinant for health- seeking behavior, finding that male children and adult men were more likely to receive treatment for acute ailments compared to their female counterparts in the areas of rural Bihar and Uttar Pradesh represented in the study. These inequalities in healthcare based on gender access contribute towards the differing mortality rates for boys versus girls, with the mortality rates greater for girls compared to boys, even before the age of five. Other previous studies have also delved into the influence of gender in terms of access to healthcare in rural areas, finding gender inequalities in access to healthcare. A 2002 study conducted by Aparna Pandey et al., published in the Journal of Health, Population, and Nutrition, analyzed care-seeking behaviors by families for girls versus boys, given similar sociodemographic characteristics in West Bengal, India. In general, the results exhibited clear gender differences such that boys received treatment from a healthcare facility if needed in 33% of the cases, while girls received treatment in 22% of the instances requiring care. Furthermore, surveys indicated that the greatest gender inequality in access to healthcare in India occurred in the provinces of Haryana, and Punjab.  Urban Areas  The problem of healthcare access arises not only in huge cities but in rapidly growing small urban areas. Here, there are fewer available options for healthcare services and there are less organized governmental bodies. Thus, there is often a lack of accountability and cooperation in healthcare departments in urban areas. It is difficult to pinpoint an establishment responsible for providing urban health services, compared to in rural areas where the responsibility lies with the district administration. Additionally, health inequalities arise in urban areas due to difficulties in residence, socioeconomic status, and discrimination against unlisted slums. To survive in this environment, urban people use non-governmental, private services which are plentiful. However, these are often understaffed, require three times the payment as a public center, and commonly have bad practice methods. To counter this, there have been efforts to join the public and private sectors in urban areas. An example of this is the Public-Private Partnerships initiative. However, studies show that in contrast to rural areas, qualified physicians tend to reside in urban areas. This can be explained by both urbanization and specialization. Private doctors tend to be specialized in a specific field so they reside in urban areas where there is a higher market and financial ability for those services.  Financing  Despite being one of the most populous countries, India has the most private healthcare in the world. Out-of-pocket private payments make up 75% of the total expenditure on healthcare. Only one fifth of healthcare is financed publicly. This is in stark contrast to most other countries of the world. According to the World Health Organization in 2007, India ranked 184 out of 191 countries in the amount of public expenditure spent on healthcare out of total GDP. In fact, public spending stagnated from 0.9% to 1.2% of total GDP in 1990 to 2010. Medical and non-medical out-of-pocket private payments can affect access to healthcare. Poorer populations are more affected by this than the wealthy. The poor pay a disproportionately higher percent of their income towards out-of-pocket expenses than the rich. The Round National Sample Survey of 1955 through 1956 showed that 40% of all people sell or borrow assets to pay for hospitalization. Half of the bottom two quintiles go into debt or sell their assets, but only a third of the top quintiles do. In fact, about half the households that drop into the lower classes do so because of health expenditures. This data shows that financial ability plays a role in determining healthcare access. In terms of non-medical costs, distance can also prevents access to healthcare. Costs of transportation prevent people from going to health centers. According to scholars, outreach programs are necessary to reach marginalized and isolated groups. In terms of medical costs, out-of-pocket hospitalization fees prevent access to healthcare. 40% of people that are hospitalized are pushed either into lifelong debt or below the poverty line. Furthermore, over 23% of patients don't have enough money to afford treatment and 63% lack regular access to necessary medications. Healthcare and treatment costs have inflated 10‚Äì12% a year and with more advancements in medicine, costs of treatment will continue to rise. Finally, the price of medications rise as they are not controlled. There is a major gap between outreach, finance and access in India. Without outreach, services cannot be spread to distant locations. Without financial ability, those in distant locations cannot afford to access healthcare. According to scholars, both of these issues are tied together and are pitfalls of the current healthcare system.  Initiatives to improve access   Government-led  = The Twelfth Plan = The government of India has a Twelfth Plan to expand the National Rural Health Mission to the entire country, known as the National Health Mission. Community based health insurance can assist in providing services to areas with disadvantaged populations. Additionally, it can help to emphasize the responsibility of the local government in making resources available. Furthermore, according to the Indian Journal of Community Medicine (IJOCM) the government should reform health insurance as well as its reach in India. The journal states that universal healthcare should slowly yet steadily be expanded to the entire population. Healthcare should be mandatory and no money should be exchanged at appointments. Finally, both private and public sectors should be involved to ensure all marginalized areas are reached. According to the IJOCM, this will increase access for the poor. See Twelfth Five Year Plan (India). = National Rural Health Mission = To counteract the issue of a lack of professionals in rural areas, the government of India wants to create a 'cadre' of rural doctors through governmental organizations. The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in April 2005 by the Government of India. The NRHM has outreach strategies for disadvantaged societies in isolated areas. The goal of the NRHM is to provide effective healthcare to rural people with a focus on 18 states with poor public health indicators and/or weak infrastructure.Umesh Kapil and Panna Choudhury National Rural Health Mission (NRHM): Will it Make a Difference? Indian Pediatrics Vol. 42 (2005): 783 NRHM has 18,000 ambulances and a workforce of 900,000 community health volunteers and 178,000 paid staff. The mission proposes creating a course for medical students that is centered around rural healthcare. Furthermore, NRHM wants to create a compulsory rural service for younger doctors in the hopes that they will remain in rural areas. However, the NRHM has failings. For example, even with the mission, most construction of health related infrastructure occurs in urban cities. Many scholars call for a new approach that is local and specialized to each state's rural areas. Other regional programs such as the Rajiv Aarogyasri Community Health Insurance Scheme in Andhra Pradesh, India have also been implemented by state governments to assist rural populations in healthcare accessibility, but the success of these programs (without other supplemental interventions at the health system level) has been limited. = National Urban Health Mission = The National Urban Health Mission as a sub-mission of National Health Mission was approved by the cabinet on 1 May 2013. The National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) works in 779 cities and towns with populations of 50,000 each. As urban health professionals are often specialized, current urban healthcare consists of secondary and tertiary, but not primary care. Thus, the mission focusses on expanding primary health services to the urban poor. The initiative recognizes that urban healthcare is lacking due to overpopulation, exclusion of populations, lack of information on health and economic ability, and unorganized health services. Thus, NUHM has appointed three tiers that need improvement: Community level (including outreach programs), Urban Health Center level (including infrastructure and improving existing health systems), and Secondary/Tertiary level (Public-Private Partnerships). Furthermore, the initiative aims to have one Urban Public Health Center for each population of 50,000 and aims to fix current facilities and create new ones. It plans for small municipal governments to take responsibility for planning healthcare facilities that are prioritized towards the urban poor, including unregistered slums and other groups. Additionally, NUHM aims to improve sanitation and drinking water, improve community outreach programs to further access, reduce out-of-pocket expenses for treatment, and initiate monthly health and nutrition days to improve community health. = Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) = Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JE) is a leading initiative of Prime Minister Modi to ensure health coverage for the poor and weaker population in India. This initiative is part of the government's view to ensure that its citizens ‚Äì particularly poor and weaker groups, have access to healthcare and good quality hospital services without facing financial difficulty. PM-JAY Provides insurance cover up to Rs 5 lakh per annum to the 100 million families in India for secondary and tertiary hospitalization. For transparency, the government made an online portal (Mera PmJay) to check eligibility for PMJAY. Health care service includes follow-up care, daycare surgeries, pre and post hospitalization, hospitalization expenses, expense benefits and newborn child/children services. The comprehensive list of services is available on the website.  Public-private partnership  One initiative adapted by governments of many states in India to improve access to healthcare entails a combination of public and private sectors. The Public- Private Partnership Initiative (PPP) was created in the hopes of reaching the health-related Millennium Development Goals. In terms of prominence, nearly every new state health initiative includes policies that allow for the involvement of private entities or non-governmental organizations. = Major programs = Fair Price Shops aim to reduce the costs of medicines, drugs, implants, prosthetics, and orthopedic devices. Currently, there is no competition between pharmacies and medical service stores for the sale of drugs. Thus, the price of drugs is uncontrolled. The Fair Price program creates a bidding system for cheaper prices of medications between drugstores and allows the store with the greatest discount to sell the drug. The program has a minimal cost for the government as fair price shops take the place of drugstores at government hospitals, thus eliminating the need to create new infrastructure for fair price shops. Furthermore, the drugs are unbranded and must be prescribed by their generic name. As there is less advertising required for generic brands, fair price shops require minimal payment from the private sector. Fair Price Shops were introduced in the West Bengal in 2012. By the end of the year, there were 93 stores benefiting 85 lakh people. From December 2012 to November 2014, these shops had saved 250 crore citizens. As doctors prescribe 60% generic drugs, the cost of treatment has been reduced by this program. This is a solution to affordability for health access in West Bengal. The largest segment of the PPP initiative is the tax-financed program, Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY). The scheme is financed 75% by the central government and 25% by the state government. This program aims to reduce medical out-of-pocket costs for hospital treatment and visits by reimbursing those that live below the poverty line. RSBY covers maximum 30,000 rupees in hospital expenses, including pre-existing conditions for up to five members in a family. In 2015, it reached 37 million households consisting of 129 million people below the poverty line. However, a family has to pay 30 rupees to register in the program.Borooah, Vani and Mishra, Vinod and Naik, Ajaya and Sabharwal, Nidhi (2015): Capturing Benefits from Public Policy Initiatives in India: Inter-Group Differences in Access to and Usage of the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana Health Insurance Cards. Published in: Amity Journal of Economics , Vol. 1, No. 1 (2016): pp. 1‚Äì17. Once deemed eligible, family members receive a yellow card. However, studies show that in Maharashtra, those with a lower socioeconomic status tend to not use the service, even if they are eligible. In the state of Uttar Pradesh, geography and council affect participation in the program. Those in the outskirts of villages tend to use the service less than those who live in the center of villages. Additionally, studies show household non-medical expenses as increasing due to this program; the probability of incurring out-of-pocket expenses has increased by 23%. However, RSBY has stopped many from falling into poverty as a result of healthcare. Furthermore, it has improved opportunities for family members to enter the workforce as they can utilize their income for other needs besides healthcare. RSBY has been applied in 25 states of India. Finally, the National Rural Telemedicine Network connects many healthcare institutions together so doctors and physicians can provide their input into diagnosis and consultations. This reduces the non-medical cost of transportation as patients do not have to travel far to get specific doctor's or specialty's opinions. However, problems arise in terms of the level of care provided by different networks. While some level of care is provided, telemedical initiatives are unable to provide drugs and diagnostic care, a necessity in rural areas. = Effectiveness = The effectiveness of public-private partnerships in healthcare is hotly disputed. Critics of PPP are concerned of its presentation as a cure-all solution, by which the health infrastructure can be improved. Proponents of PPP claim that these partnerships take advantage of existing infrastructure in order to provide care for the underprivileged. The results of the PPP in the states of Maharashtra and West Bengal show that all three of these programs are effective when used in combination with federal health services. They assist in filling the gap between outreach and affordability in India. However, even with these programs, high out-of-pocket payments for non-medical expenses are still deterring people from healthcare access. Thus, scholars state that these programs need to be expanded across India. A case study of tuberculosis control in rural areas, in which PPP was utilized showed limited effectiveness; while the program was moderately effective, a lack of accountability forced the program to shut down. Similar issues in accountability were seen by the parties involved within other PPP schemes. Facilitators and private practitioners, when asked about PPP, identified lack of state support, in the form of adequate funding, and a lack of coordination, as primary reasons why PPP ventures are unsuccessful. In the most successful PPP ventures, the World Health Organization found that the most prominent factor, aside from financial support, was ownership of the project by state and local governments. It was found that programs sponsored by the state governments were more effective in achieving health goals than programs set by national governments. India's has setup a National Telemedicine Taskforce by the Health Ministry of India, in 2005, paved way for the success of various projects like the ICMR-AROGYASREE, NeHA and VRCs. Telemedicine also helps family physicians by giving them easy access to speciality doctors and helping them in close monitoring of patients. Different types of telemedicine services like store and forward, real-time and remote or self-monitoring provides various educational, healthcare delivery and management, disease screening and disaster management services all over the globe. Even though telemedicine cannot be a solution to all the problems, it can surely help decrease the burden of the healthcare system to a large extent.  Quality of healthcare  A community medical provider in Kerala which promotes traditional Indian medicine, or Ayurveda. Non-availability of diagnostic tools and increasing reluctance of qualified and experienced healthcare professionals to practice in rural, under-equipped and financially less lucrative rural areas are becoming big challenges. Rural medical practitioners are highly sought after by residents of rural areas as they are more financially affordable and geographically accessible than practitioners working in the formal public health care sector. But there are incidents where doctors were attacked and even killed in rural India In 2015 the British Medical Journal published a report by Dr Gadre, from Kolkata, exposed the extent of malpractice in the Indian healthcare system. He interviewed 78 doctors and found that kickbacks for referrals, irrational drug prescribing and unnecessary interventions were commonplace. According to a study conducted by Martin Patrick, CPPR chief economist released in 2017 has projected people depend more on private sector for healthcare and the amount spent by a household to avail of private services is almost 24 times more than what is spent for public healthcare services.  South India  In many rural communities throughout India, healthcare is provided by what is known as informal providers, who may or may not have proper medical accreditation to diagnose and treat patients, generally offering consults for common ailments. Specifically, in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India, these informal healthcare providers generally practice in the form of services in the homes of patients and prescribing allopathic drugs. A 2014 study by Meenakshi Gautham et al., published in the journal Health Policy and Planning, found that in Guntur, about 71% of patients received injections from informal healthcare providers as a part of illness management strategies. The study also examined the educational background of the informal healthcare providers and found that of those surveyed, 43% had completed 11 or more years of schooling, while 10% had graduated from college. In general, the perceived quality of healthcare also has implications on patient adherence to treatment. A 2015 study conducted by Nandakumar Mekoth and Vidya Dalvi, published in Hospital Topics examined different aspects that contribute to a patient's perception of quality of healthcare in Karnataka, India, and how these factors influenced adherence to treatment. The study incorporated aspects related to quality of healthcare including interactive quality of physicians, base-level expectation about primary health care facilities in the area, and non-medical physical facilities (including drinking water and restroom facilities). In terms of adherence to treatment, two sub-factors were investigated, persistence of treatment and treatment- supporting adherence (changes in health behaviors that supplement the overall treatment plan). The findings indicated that the different quality of healthcare factors surveyed all had a direct influence on both sub-factors of adherence to treatment. Furthermore, the base-level expectation component in quality of healthcare perception, presented the most significant influence on overall adherence to treatment, with the interactive quality of physicians having the least influence on adherence to treatment, of three aspects investigated in this study.  North India  In a particular district of Uttarakhand, India known as Tehri, the educational background of informal healthcare providers indicated that 94% had completed 11 or more years of schooling, while 43% had graduated from college. In terms of the mode of care delivered, 99% of the health services provided in Tehri were through the clinic, whereas in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, 25% of the health care services are delivered through the clinic, while 40% of the care provided is mobile (meaning that healthcare providers move from location to location to see patients), and 35% is a combination of clinic and mobile service. A healthcare worker gives pediatric polio vaccination to a young boy. In general throughout India, the private healthcare sector does not have a standard of care that is present across all facilities, leading to many variations in the quality of care provided. In particular, a 2011 study by Padma Bhate-Deosthali et al., published in Reproductive Health Matters, examined the quality of healthcare particularly in the area of maternal services through different regions in Maharashtra, India. The findings indicated that out of 146 maternity hospitals surveyed, 137 of these did not have a qualified midwife, which is crucial for maternity homes as proper care cannot be delivered without midwives in some cases. In addition, the 2007 study by Ayesha De Costa and Vinod Diwan analyzed the distribution of healthcare providers and systems in Madhya Pradesh, India. The results indicated that among solo practitioners in the private sector for that region, 62% practiced allopathic (Western) medicine, while 38% practiced Indian systems of medicine and traditional systems (including, but not limited to ayurveda, sidhi, unani, and homeopathy). In certain areas, there are also gaps in the knowledge of healthcare providers about certain ailments that further contribute towards quality of healthcare delivered when treatments are not fully supported with thorough knowledge about the ailment. A 2015 study by Manoj Mohanan et al., published in JAMA Pediatrics, investigate the knowledge base of a sample of practitioners (80% without formal medical degrees) in Bihar, India, specifically in the context of childhood diarrhea and pneumonia treatment. The findings indicated that in general, a significant number of practitioners missed asking key diagnostic questions regarding symptoms associated with diarrhea and pneumonia, leading to misjudgments and lack of complete information when prescribing treatments. Among the sample of practitioners studied in rural Bihar, 4% prescribed the correct treatment for the hypothetical diarrhea cases in the study, and 9% gave the correct treatment plan for the hypothetical pneumonia cases presented. Recent studies have examined the role of educational or training programs for healthcare providers in rural areas of North India as a method to promote higher quality of healthcare, though conclusive results have not yet been attained.

If we draw the moment diagram for the beam and then divided it by the flexural rigidity(EI), the 'M/EI diagram' results by the following equation \\\\theta=\\\\int\\\\left(\\\\frac{M}{EI}\\\\right)dx Theorem 1 The change in slope between any two points on the elastic curve equals the area of the M/EI (moment) diagram between these two points. \\\\theta_{A/B}={\\\\int_A}^B\\\\left(\\\\frac{M}{EI}\\\\right)dx where, * M = moment * EI = flexural rigidity * \\\\theta_{A/B} = change in slope between points A and B * A, B = points on the elastic curve Theorem 2 The vertical deviation of a point A on an elastic curve with respect to the tangent which is extended from another point B equals the moment of the area under the M/EI diagram between those two points (A and B). This moment is computed about point A where the deviation from B to A is to be determined. t_{A/B} = {\\\\int_A}^B \\\\frac{M}{EI} x \\\\;dx where, * M = moment * EI = flexural rigidity * t_{A/B} = deviation of tangent at point A with respect to the tangent at point B * A, B = points on the elastic curveHibbeler, R.C. (2012). Structural Analysis. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson. pp. 316‚Äì325. Rule of Sign Convention The deviation at any point on the elastic curve is positive if the point lies above the tangent, negative if the point is below the tangent; we measured it from left tangent, if Œ∏ is counterclockwise direction, the change in slope is positive, negative if Œ∏ is clockwise direction.Moment-Area Method Beam Deflection Procedure for Analysis The following procedure provides a method that may be used to determine the displacement and slope at a point on the elastic curve of a beam using the moment-area theorem. * Determine the reaction forces of a structure and draw the M/EI diagram of the structure. * If there are only concentrated loads on the structure, the problem will be easy to draw M/EI diagram which will results a series of triangular shapes. * If there are mixed with distributed loads and concentrated, the moment diagram (M/EI) will results parabolic curves, cubic, etc. * Then, assume and draw the deflection shape of the structure by looking at M/EI diagram. * Find the rotations, change of slopes and deflections of the structure by using the geometric mathematics.

They have been based out of Bengaluru, Karnataka, since 2013, after their return from Hong Kong (2012 - 2013).http://metalassault.com/Interviews/2013/02/07/a-detailed-conversation- with-vocalist-extraordinaire-girish- pradhan/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/news-and- interviews/Musical-journey-of-Girish-Pradhan/articleshow/10115401.cms History The line up started in 2006 with Guitarist Suraz Karki and Girish Pradhan. Nagen Sarki, a drummer who was working with the band Still Waters, joined the line-up, on Suraz‚Äôs recommendation. The guitarist‚Äôs long time friend Vishal Pradhan also joined the band as the bass player. Prior to this, Girish was a part of a band named Anarchy, from Gangtok, of which his brother Yogesh Pradhan was the drummer. He later became the bassist and producer of GATC. Suraz, Nagen and Vishal collectively were also a part of a band named Mukti, in the district of Namchi, in Sikkim. The new group formed decided to keep the name Mukti. They started playing small gigs in Gangtok and Darjeeling. From 2007 to 2009, the line up was broken. In April 2008, Girish temporarily moved back to Gangtok and reunited with Suraz to form a line up to take part in a local band competition. The group was named ‚ÄúRevolving Barrel‚Äù, with drummer Ronald Pradhan and bassist Noel Lepcha. The later half of 2008 saw Pradhan travel to Nepal, Kathmandu. Ronald had moved to the city and suggested that they reform Revolving Barrel there. Joined by bassist Lokesh Thapa (Gingerfeet/Still waters) and an old time friend of Ronald, Jatin Pradhan on the guitars, Revolving Barrel was now based out of Kathmandu. Back in Gangtok, Suraz and Nagen joined/formed ‚ÄúA.live!‚Äù. A.Live went on to win the Mangan Rock Fest in the district of Mangan, Sikkim, and the line up of Revolving Barrel came to an end. Girish returned to Gangtok in the later half of 2009 where Yogesh had come too. As the two brothers met, Yogesh suggested that they record a single original. His YouTube channel, then named ‚ÄúGirish Pradhan‚Äù, could be used as a platform to promote it. They started working on a song which Girish had been working on during his stay in Nepal. It was named, ‚ÄùAngel‚Äù. It was completed in autumn 2009 and was first released by the magazine T.N.T (The Northeast Times) in their seasonal CD release, Great Eastern Rock Volume II. The brothers started performing acoustic sets in Cafe Live and Loud. However, Yogesh had to leave to complete his course. Girish started doing solo unplugged sessions in the pub. Soon, Noel and Nagen, who no longer worked with ‚ÄúA.live!‚Äù, joined on bass and drums. Girish took up the role of a vocalist and a lead guitarist. The YouTube channel, the solo single, ‚ÄúAngel‚Äù and Cafe Live and Loud had turned the singer‚Äôs name into a small brand of its own. The line-up was finally named Girish and The Chronicles, with Yogesh acting as the producer for the band. The band had weekly performances at Cafe Live and Loud and did a debut open concert with the spastic society on Friday the 13 October 2009, sharing the stage with Lou Majaw. The band was invited to participate in various competitions and went on to headline small college fests. The first competition they took part in was Alcheringa, Rock o Phoenix, annually held at IIT Guwahati. They were temporarily joined by violinist/keyboardist Mischael Jiwandan Pradhan, a college mate of Girish. Soon in the weeks that followed, participating in such competitions because a regular routine for the band from January till April. Parts of Assam, West Bengal and other parts of the country were covered. In April, the band won auditions to a music awards festival named ‚ÄúSuncane Skale‚Äù, to be held in Montenegro. The band recorded an original single which was to be complied in the festival‚Äôs CD release. The tracks were sent to Yogesh for drums/keyboards and arrangement. The lyrics was written in collaboration with an old friend of Girish, Mausami Khushbu Rai. The song was named ‚ÄúAngel‚Äôs Angel‚Äù and later changed to ‚ÄúYesteryears‚Äù. They travelled to Montenegro, where the band was awarded first runners up to the title of ‚ÄúSummer song‚Äù. The song was played in European radio. On returning to Delhi, the band was covered by various TV channels such as Aaj Tak and CNN IBN along with printed media like The Telegraph. They were also invited to the Sikkim Governor‚Äôs office and The Chief Minister‚Äôs office of Sikkim for receiving congratulations. Later the same year, the band was empaneled in the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). In 2011, the band was invited for a performance at the Heritage academy, Kolkata when Noel decided to leave the band. They called Yogesh, who was originally a drummer-turned-guitarist to fill in for the bass. While the YouTube channel was doing a good job of marketing the band, it was around September when an event organising company Ojone - O3 events led by entrepreneur Ujjwal Mukhia, invited the band to perform at the Hard Rock Cafe Bangalore. The band did a series of small shows around the city. During this time an earthquake struck Sikkim. The band still in Bengaluru, worried for their families, came up with the song ‚ÄúA New Beginning‚Äù. In two days, the song was recorded at Sound Glitz Studio, and released. Girish also participated in the Yamaha Asian Beat national Finals with his other project Silver Tears during this time, where he won the best vocalist award.https://www.deccanherald.com/amp/content/187255/metal-singer-girish- pradhan-wins.htm The band got a chance to participate in the finals of the same competition on an international level, held at Seoul, South Korea.https://id.yamaha.com/id/news_events/contents/asianbeat/history/2011/index.htm At around the same time, Girish was offered a contract in the clubs of Hong Kong as a vocalist. Back in Gangtok, it was decided that the band would take in Abhishek Lemo Gurung (Still Waters/Gingerfeet) as their temporary vocalist. They decided to take part in the Hornbill Festival held at Nagaland, where they were runners up, with Suraz named best guitarist and Abhishek best vocalist. In their return to Gangtok, they formed a blues trio and were performing regular gigs in the town. 2012 saw the frontman of the band spending a few months in various clubs of Hong Kong as a singer. One club in particular was named Escape, located in the streets of Wanchai . After a few months of working. He successfully made a deal with the club owners for bringing GATC to Hong Kong for a small tour and then join the clubs under contract for a year. After a year long stay the band finally decided on going back home and compile an album. After returning to India, Pradhan started with a solo performance at the Punjab Engineering College Fest. In early 2013, the band stayed in Gangtok for three months (January-March), where the album was completed. It was backed up by the editor of TNT magazine Pradyot Manikya. Although the album was complete, the band wanted to re-record everything replacing the Fender Stratocaster guitar takes with Gibson Les Pauls. Angel was re-recorded wholly along with the other songs. The band reconnected with Ojone and decided to relocate to Bengaluru, Karnataka. They started off by co- headlining BMS college fest along with Lagori and Kryptos. Soon with Ujjwal Mukhia as their new manager, the band took an independent house in the city where they started finishing off the album. The band got a chance to open for Hoobastank, who were to perform in Shillong, Meghalaya. It was organised by TNT magazine. GATC started performing frequently in the Bengaluru city‚Äôs prominent venues such as Take 5, B-Flat, Hard Rock Cafe and Vapour. GATC released their first album - 'Back On Earth‚Äô consisting of 14 Tracks in August, 2014 under Universal Music Group label. The album release was followed by a national Hard Rock Cafe Tour. The album was promoted by Contrabands, which was a property of Universal Music Group, VH1 & Hard Rock Cafe. Angel was chosen for featuring on VH1. 2018 GATC did an intensive North-East India tour during the months of November and December covering regions of Meghalaya, Sikkim, Manipur, Mizoram and Assam. The band ended the year by releasing their single, ‚ÄúRock the Highway‚Äù, on YouTube and other online platforms, worldwide. The song gained a good response from many parts of the world. It was also featured by Classic Rock Magazine in their ‚ÄúTracks of the week‚Äù, section. Soon after, it was featured in the rock magazine Sleaze Roxx . 2019 Started off with the band associating with the renowned guitarist Baiju Dharmajan. They performed at the annual Sikkim Tourism Red Panda festival together and then headed off to Bengaluru to open for TesseracT at Indian Institute of Science. The team was then invited for North-East festival, held at Central World, Bangkok, Thailand. They performed for two consecutive nights. Coming back to Bengaluru, they started writing new material for their second album, which has already started with the release of ‚ÄúRock The Highway‚Äù. The band signed up with Lion‚Äôs Pride Music, a Denmark based record label on the 22nd of May, 2019, for their upcoming album by the name ‚ÄúRock The Highway‚Äù, which is scheduled to release world-wide, in April 2020.

Early life  Born as Prince Maximilian Egon Christian Karl Aloys Emil Leo Richard Anton zu F√ºrstenberg, he was the son of Prince Maximilian Egon zu F√ºrstenberg, and his wife Countess Leontina von Khevenh√ºller-Metsch. He had a younger brother, born in 1867, named Prince Karl Emil Egon zu F√ºrstenberg. Life and career Max Egon II. zu F√ºrstenberg medal, 1933 A close friend and adviser of Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany, Max of F√ºrstenberg inherited territorial titles in Prussia, Austria, Hungary, W√ºrttemberg and Baden, and by virtue of them had a seat in the House of Lords in each of the five states. Until the First World War, he was vice-president of the Prussian House of Lords. His principal residence was at Donaueschingen, near the source of the Danube, where he owned a castle and great deer forests. Emperor Wilhelm II frequently visited him there, and Max invariably accompanied the Emperor on his hunting expeditions and Norwegian trips. As well as his vast ancestral forests, he also owned coal mines, hotels and breweries. Although he was a member of the high Roman Catholic Uradel who had long stood aloof from party politics, after meeting Adolf Hitler and Ernst Roehm in November 1933, Max became enthusiastic about Hitler's leadership, commenting that \\"It was wonderful, to be able to meet such a great man\\".Eckart Conze, Monika Wienfort, eds., Adel und Moderne: Deutschland im europ√§ischen Vergleich im 19. und 20.

Phase one of the scheme, which was completed in 2012, involved the construction of a new health centre, shops and apartments. The Odeon was opened with the premiere of the James Bond film Skyfall. The completion of the main square of the site has been delayed until March 2013. There have been concerns raised that the development would increase the pressure on already-limited parking spaces in Dorchester. History The Eldridge Pope brewery was founded by Charles and Sarah Eldridge in 1833, and the company built the Green Dragon Brewery in Dorchester in 1837. Soon afterwards, John Allen Pope joined the partnership and production moved to the Mariners Brewery, still visible in the town's High West Street. The existing Brewhouse, on which the redevelopment is taking place, was built and reopened two years after a fire in 1922 destroyed the previous site.

It is a thin potential space on the face, and is paired on either side. It is located between the levator anguli oris muscle inferiorly and the levator labii superioris muscle superiorly. The term is derived from the fact that the space is in the region of the canine fossa, and that infections originating from the maxillary canine tooth may spread to involve the space. Infra-orbital is derived from infra- meaning below and orbit which refers to the eye socket. Diagram showing muscles of infra-orbital region. The levator labii superioris muscle is colored red. Diagram showing muscles of the infra-orbital region. Levator anguli oris is colored red. The canine space is situated between the levator anguli oris muscle and the levator labii superioris muscle. Structure Boundaries The boundaries of the canine space are: * the nasal cartilages anteriorly * the buccal space posteriorly * the quadratus labii superioris muscle (levator labii superioris) superiorly * the oral mucosa of the maxillary labial sulcus inferiorly * the quadratus labii superioris muscle superficially * and the deep border is created by the levator anguli oris muscle. Communications The canine space communicates with the buccal space posteriorly. Function Contents The contents of the canine space are: * the angular artery and angular vein * the infra- orbital nerve (a branch of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve) Clinical significance Canine space infections may occur by spread of infection from the buccal space. Signs and symptoms of a canine space abscess might include swelling that obliterates the nasolabial fold. If left untreated, infections of this space will eventually spontaneously drain via the medial or lateral canthus of the eye, as this is the path of least resistance. Treatment is usually by surgical incision and drainage, and the incision is placed inside the mouth to avoid a facial scar. Rarely, when infections of the canine space erode into the infra-orbital vein or the inferior ophthalmic vein (via the sinuses), there can be spread via the common ophthalmic vein through the superior orbital fissure and into the cavernous sinus. This can result in septic cavernous sinus thrombosis, which is a rare, but life-threatening condition. Odontogenic infection Odontogenic infections may spread to involve the canine space. The most likely causative tooth is the maxillary canine or maxillary first premolar. This occurs when pus (e.g. from a periapical abscess), perforates the buccal cortical plate of the maxilla above the level of attachment of the levator anguli oris muscle. This is more likely if the tooth root is long (the maxillary canine has the longest root of all the teeth), and its apex lies at a level above the muscle attachment.

It is the culminating point of the ridge named Furgggrat stretching from the Furggjoch (3,271 m) to the Theodul Pass (3,295 m), and is located halfway between the Matterhorn and Testa Grigia. The peak is the site of the now abandoned cable car station. Construction on the cable car began in the summer of 1950 - with the station on the Furggen summit designed by Carlo Mollino - and the lift opened to the public on 25 December 1952. The lift had a single span of 2,887m long - making it the world's longest at the time of its opening. The car could hold 25 passengers and transport 240 people per hour. The lift between Plan Maison and Furggen was designed as part of a system of cable cars reaching from Breuil- Cervinia to the Matterhorn, with leg one running from Breuil-Cervinia to Plan Maison (opened on 4 March 1939). Leg 2 running from Plan Maison up to the summit of Furggen, and leg 3 reaching the top of the Matterhorn. The final leg was never constructed, partly as a result of the large cost and due to environmental opposition. The leg between Plan Maison and Furggen was abandoned in 1993 after ice brought down the cables and they were never replaced.http://www.volkszone.com/VZi/showthread.php?t=749114 The station on the summit of Furggen is now abandoned, but the leg between Breuil-Cervinia and Plan Maison is still in place.http://www.cervinia.it/downloadDocument?ixDocumentId=957&ixDownload;=true&webdbiDocumentId;=957&webdbiDownload;=true Furggen See also *List of buildings and structures above 3000 m in Switzerland References External links *Furggen on Hikr Category:Mountains of the Alps Category:Alpine three-thousanders Category:Mountains of Aosta Valley Category:Mountains of Valais Category:Italy‚ÄìSwitzerland border Category:International mountains of Europe Category:Mountains of Switzerland ","title":"Furggen"},{"id":"39071616","text":"Streaked scrub warblers breed in the IBA.

Description The Sarazm Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International, encompasses part of the Zeravshan floodplain after the river has left the mountains and flows braided through a wide valley downstream of the city of Panjakent. It contains a range of temporary and permanent islands, many of which are covered with tugay, or flood-plain forest ‚Äì comprising the only such ecosystem in northern Tajikistan. The soil is loamy-sandy, overgrown in moist areas with herbs, forming water meadows as well as dense thickets of trees and shrubs. Birds The rich tugay vegetation provides favourable habitats for birdlife. The site was classified as an IBA because it supports significant numbers of the populations of various bird species, either as residents, or as breeding or passage migrants. These include saker falcons, pale-backed pigeons, Egyptian nightjars, European rollers, white-winged woodpeckers, great tits, streaked scrub warblers, Sykes's warblers and red-headed buntings.

Retrieved on 10 April 2013. She is considered the Arab world's first woman journalist.  Biography  Rose El Youssef was born in Tripoli, Lebanon to Turkish father and a Lebanese mother. She received her primary education in Tripoli. Her mother died at birth, and she arrived in Egypt with her father when she was 10 years old. Her father then went on to live in Brazil and left her with the Christian family of Lebanese born Egyptian Eskander Farah, who had a major impact on her life, and especially on her choice to choose the acting profession. She began appearing at age 14. Initially, only in small roles, but her breakout came when none of the actresses agreed to play an old woman role, and Al-Yosef took it upon herself. From 1912 to 1925, she was a well-known theater and work actress as part of the George Abyad troupe (1880-1959) and the Youssef Wehbe troupe (1898‚Äì1982) reaching the peak of fame between 1923-1925. Her success won her the nickname the \\"Sarah Bernard of the East\\" and praise from Egyptian and international critics. She also became a favorite of the high society. In 1925 she founded the news magazine Rose al-Y≈´suf. The magazine, which did not hesitate to use in illustration of caricatures, became popular and addressed taboo subjects such as religion and sexuality. This Cairo weekly, which continued despite the death of its founder in 1958, stood out in 1994 as one of the rare Arab journals to dare to publish extracts from the Satanic Verses of Salman Rushdie.  Legacy  Through her work she succeeded in breaking social and political conventions and boundaries, and shattering prejudices imposed on women during her time, depriving them of their right to self-expression and their integration into the political and social arena. Rose El Youssef, unique in her time, has become an emblematic figure of the Egyptian press and theater and of the Cairo context in the interwar period. A documentary entitled The Legend of Rose al-Youssef, was produced in 2002 by Mohamad Kamel al-Kalioubi . The Arab Human Development Report 2005: Towards the Rise of Women in the Arab World described her as a \\"pioneer of the stage and one of the earliest actresses.\\" and said that she \\"was a woman unique in her time.\\" She had said \\"I made this woman myself.\\" Personal life Her son Ihsan Abdel Quddous became one of Egypt's greatest writers. Her grandson is the Egyptian-American playwright Yussef El Guindi.

Access sequences and competitive ratio As typically formulated, the online binary search tree problem involves search trees defined over a fixed key set (1, 2, ..., n). An access sequence is a sequence x_1, x_2, ... where each number xi is one of the given keys. Any particular algorithm for maintaining binary search trees (such as the splay tree algorithm or Iacono's working set structure) has a cost for each access sequence that models the amount of time it would take to use the structure to search for each of the keys in the access sequence in turn. The cost of a search is modeled by assuming that the search tree algorithm has a single pointer into a binary search tree, which at the start of each search points to the root of the tree. The algorithm may then perform any sequence of the following operations: * Move the pointer to its left child. * Move the pointer to its right child. * Move the pointer to its parent. * Perform a single tree rotation on the pointer and its parent. The search is required, at some point within this sequence of operations to move the pointer to a node containing the key, and the cost of the search is the number of operations that are performed in the sequence. The total cost costA(X) for algorithm A on access sequence X is the sum of the costs of the searches for each successive key in the sequence. As is standard in competitive analysis, the competitive ratio of an algorithm A is defined to be the maximum, over all access sequences, of the ratio of the cost for A to the best cost that any algorithm could achieve: :\\\\rho_A = \\\\sup_X \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{cost}_A(X)}{\\\\mathrm{cost}_\\\\mathrm{opt}(X)}. The dynamic optimality conjecture states that splay trees have constant competitive ratio, but this remains unproven. The geometric view of binary search trees provides a different way of understanding the problem that has led to the development of alternative algorithms that could also (conjecturally) have a constant competitive ratio. Translation to a geometric point set In the geometric view of the online binary search tree problem, an access sequence x_1, . . ., x_m (sequence of searches performed on a binary search tree (BST) with a key set {1,2,...,n}) is mapped to the set of points {(x_i, i)}, where X-axis represents key space and Y-axis represents time; to which a set of touched nodes is added. By touched nodes we mean the following. Consider a BST access algorithm with a single pointer to a node in the tree. At the beginning of an access to a given key x_i, this pointer is initialized to the root of the tree. Whenever the pointer moves to or is initialized to a node, we say that the node is touched. We represent a BST algorithm for a given input sequence by drawing a point for each item that gets touched. For example, assume the following BST on 4 nodes is given: 130px The key set is {1, 2, 3, 4}. Let 3, 1, 4, 2 be the access sequence. * In the first access, only the node 3 is touched. * In the second access, the nodes 3 and 1 are touched. * In the third access - 3 and 4 are touched. * In the fourth access, touch 3, then 1, and after that 2. The touches are represented geometrically: If an item x is touched in the operations for the ith access, then a point (x,i) is plotted.  Arborally satisfied point sets  Rectangle spanned by two points. This point set is not arborally satisfied. This is an example of arborally satisfied set of points. A point set is said to be arborally satisfied if the following property holds: for any pair of points that do not both lie on the same horizontal or vertical line, there exists a third point which lies in the rectangle spanned by the first two points (either inside or on the boundary).  Theorem  A point set containing the points (x_i, i) is arborally satisfied if and only if it corresponds to a valid BST for the input sequence x_1, x_2, . . ., x_m. = Proof = First, prove that the point set for any valid BST algorithm is arborally satisfied. Consider points (x, i) and (y, j), where is touched at time and is touched at time . Assume by symmetry that x < y and i < j. It needs to be shown that there exists a third point in the rectangle with corners as (x, i) and (y, j). Also let \\\\mathrm{LCA}_t(a, b) denote the lowest common ancestor of nodes and right before time . There are a few cases: * If \\\\mathrm{LCA}_i(x, y) e x, then use the point (\\\\mathrm{LCA}_i(x, y), i), since \\\\mathrm{LCA}_i(x, y) must have been touched if was. * If \\\\mathrm{LCA}_j(x, y) e y, then the point (\\\\mathrm{LCA}_j(x, y), j) can be used. * If neither of the above two cases hold, then must be an ancestor of right before time and be an ancestor of right before time . Then at some time (i \\\\le k < j), must have been rotated above , so the point (y, k) can be used. Next, show the other direction: given an arborally satisfied point set, a valid BST corresponding to that point set can be constructed. Organize our BST into a treap which is organized in heap- order by next-touch-time. Note that next-touch-time has ties and is thus not uniquely defined, but this isn‚Äôt a problem as long as there is a way to break ties. When time reached, the nodes touched form a connected subtree at the top, by the heap ordering property. Now, assign new next-touch-times for this subtree, and rearrange it into a new local treap. If a pair of nodes, and , straddle the boundary between the touched and untouched part of the treap, then if is to be touched sooner than then (x, now) \\\\to (y, next - touch(y)) is an unsatisfied rectangle because the leftmost such point would be the right child of , not .  Corollary  Finding the best BST execution for the input sequence x_1, x_2, . . ., x_m is equivalent to finding the minimum cardinality superset of points (that contains the input in geometric representation) that is arborally satisfied. The more general problem of finding the minimum cardinality arborally satisfied superset of a general set of input points (not limited to one input point per coordinate), is known to be NP-complete.  Greedy algorithm  The following greedy algorithm constructs arborally satisfiable sets: * Sweep the point set with a horizontal line by increasing coordinate. * At time , place the minimal number of points at y = i to make the point set up to y \\\\ge i arborally satisfied. This minimal set of points is uniquely defined: for any unsatisfied rectangle formed with (x_i, i) in one corner, add the other corner at y = i. The algorithm has been conjectured to be optimal within an additive term.  Other results  The geometry of binary search trees has been used to provide an algorithm which is dynamically optimal if any binary search tree algorithm is dynamically optimal.

Entering the navy early in his life, Taylor served as a midshipman on Cook's third voyage of discovery. He was promoted shortly after his return to England and commanded ships during the American War of Independence. In common with other officers, he struggled to find employment during the years of peace, but was given a ship to command for a few years in 1788. He was on bad terms with his lieutenant however, and a court-martial ensued. Taylor returned to an active career on the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, still commanding small ships and escorting trade. Promoted to post captain in 1793, he moved to command several frigates in British waters, or as far afield as North America. His later service was on the African coast, where he took part in the capture of Gor√©e in 1801, and in the Caribbean. He does not appear to have held any seagoing commands during the Napoleonic Wars, but continued to be promoted, rising to flag rank in 1811. He eventually reached the rank of admiral of the red, before his death in 1842. He was by this time the last surviving officer from Cook's third voyage. Early career James Cook, portrait by Nathaniel Dance-Holland, c. 1775. Taylor sailed with Cook on Cook's last voyage. Taylor was born in 1760 and entered the navy at an early age. By 1776 he was a midshipman, and joined Captain James Cook's third voyage of discovery, serving aboard . He returned with the expedition after Cook's death, and on 28 October 1780 was promoted to lieutenant. The American War of Independence having broken out by now, he saw further service and was soon promoted to commander, on 21 January 1783, and was given command of the brig-sloop . He also appears to have commissioned the brig-sloop in May 1783, but if so, the command was short-lived, and she was under another commander by 1784. Taylor instead took command of the 14-gun towards the end of the war with America, and remained in command after the peace, until 1786. Taylor then seems to have spent some time without a ship, before commissioning the 14-gun sloop in January 1788. His command of Thorn was notable for a court-martial Taylor brought against his lieutenant, a man named Thackeray. Among other charges, Thackeray was alleged to have gone to Taylor, while he was alone in his cabin, and to have called him a \\"scoundrel\\" and a \\"liar\\". The offence being given in private, the court had only Taylor's word that it was true, creating a brief legal quandary over whether Taylor, who as usual in court-martials, was acting as the prosecutor, could give evidence on his own behalf, and together with the accused. After some deliberation, Taylor was allowed to give his evidence, as criminal trials such as court-martials, were adjudged to be on behalf of the Crown, unlike civil prosecutions. Thackeray was subsequently stripped of his rank and reduced to a midshipman. Taylor served in command of Thorn off Shetland until 1790, and paid her off after the period of the Spanish armament had passed. French Revolutionary Wars On the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, Taylor commissioned the 12-gun in April 1794 and served in the English Channel and the North Sea. One of his early tasks was to sail with the Mediterranean Fleet under Lord Hood, and he left Spithead on 22 May 1793. He accompanied the fleet as far as Gibraltar, and then returned, escorting the homeward-bound trade. After this service Taylor was promoted to post-captain on 24 September 1793 and was appointed to command in November. From the Prompte he moved into the 32-gun in 1795 and served on a number of stations. He was first on the Scottish coast, and on 6 March 1796 seized the 36-gun Batavian frigate Zefir in the Forth, in company with and . Taylor then took Andromeda to North America, sailing to Newfoundland and Halifax on 24 May 1796. He returned to cruise in the English Channel and the North Sea between 1797 and 1798. Sir Charles Hamilton, c. 1800, by Sir William Beechey. Taylor served under Hamilton at the capture of Gor√©e in 1801. Taylor was given command of the 48-gun in spring 1799, succeeding Captain The Hon. Michael de Courcy, and commanded her on African coast. He took part in the capture of Gor√©e from the French in April 1801, while cruising with a squadron under the command of Captain Sir Charles Hamilton. Hamilton, in command of the 44-gun had received intelligence that there were three French frigates at anchor there. Hamilton sailed to investigate, taking with him Taylor in Magnanime, and Captain Solomon Ferris, in command of the 64-gun . The frigates were not there, so Hamilton summoned the governor and ordered him to surrender. The governor agreed, and Hamilton and his force took possession on 5 April. Taylor was later in the Leeward Islands, where he remained for the rest of the French Revolutionary Wars. Family and later life Taylor does not appear to have commanded any further ships during his career, but he continued to be promoted, being advanced to rear-admiral on 1 August 1811, vice-admiral on 12 August 1819 and admiral in 1830. He settled at Greenwich with his wife Isabella and had at least one daughter, Grace, who married William Padwick, squire of Hayling Island, in 1814. William Taylor reached the rank of Admiral of the Red before his death on 19 July 1842 at his residence at Maze Hill, Greenwich, at the age of 82. He was by this time the last surviving officer from Cook's third voyage. Notes a. Zefir was brought into the service as , and spent some time as a frigate before being reduced to a storeship.

It existed under several variations of the 224th Brigade title. First World War On the outbreak of World War I the Territorial Force (TF) immediately mobilised for home defence, but shortly afterwards (31 August 1914), its units were authorised to raise 2nd battalions formed from those men who had not volunteered for, or were not fit for, overseas service, together with new volunteers, while the 1st Line went overseas to supplement the Regulars.Becke, p. 6. Early in 1915 the 2nd Line TF battalions were raised to full strength to form new divisions, and began to form Reserve (3rd Line) units to supply drafts.Becke, pp. 6, 65. The remaining Home Service men were separated out in May 1915 to form brigades of Coast Defence Battalions (termed Provisional Battalions from June 1915). The 4th Provisional Brigade was formed mainly from details of regiments from Wales and North-West England, with the following composition:4th Provisional Brigade War Diary, The National Archives, Kew file WO 95/5458.

The units of the brigade moved from their home depots to Norfolk, where it was attached to 64th (2nd Highland) Division under the control of Northern Army of Central Force, with its battalions billeted across Norfolk as follows:Distribution of Northern and Southern Armies (Home Defence), The National Archives file WO 33/765. * Brigade Headquarters: North Walsham * 46th Provisional Battalion Walcott * 47th Provisional Battalion Mundesley * 48th Provisional Battalion Cromer * 49th Provisional Battalion Hemsby In September 1916 the brigade was joined by 2/1st Home Counties (Kent) Heavy Battery, Royal Garrison Artillery (4 x 4.7-inch guns) at Mundesley.Becke, pp. 75‚Äì82. 224th Mixed Brigade The Military Service Act 1916 swept away the Home/Foreign service distinction, and all TF soldiers became liable for overseas service, if medically fit. The Provisional Brigades thus became anomalous, and at the end of 1916 their units became numbered battalions of their parent units. Part of their role was physical conditioning to render men fit for drafting overseas. The 4th Provisional Brigade became the 224th Mixed Brigade in December 1916, with its units re-designated as shown below:http://www.warpath.orbat.com/misc_units/misc_unallot_uk.htm#224_bde In May 1918 each of the Mixed Brigades was called upon to provide a battalion (re-designated a Garrison Guard battalion) to reconstitute the 59th (2nd North Midland) Division, which had been virtually destroyed during the German Spring Offensive. The Brigade supplied the 23rd Cheshire Regiment to the 178th (2/1st Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire) Brigade and immediately raised a new 24th (Home Service) Battalion, Cheshires to take over its coast defence duties.Becke, p. 104. The brigade remained with this composition until the end of the war, after which it was demobilised. * 4th Provisional Battery became 1206th (East Anglia) Battery RFA * 2/1st Home Counties (Kent) Heavy Battery RGA * 4th Provisional Field Company became 643rd (East Anglia) Field Company and 224th Mixed Brigade Signal Section RE * 46th Provisional Battalion became 23rd Battalion, Cheshire Regiment * 47th Provisional Battalion became 23rd Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliershttp://www.1914-1918.net/rwf.htm * 48th Provisional Battalion became 4th Battalion, Monmouthshire Regiment * 49th Provisional Battalion became 14th Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment * 2/9th (Cyclist) Battalion, Hampshire Regiment, (joined April 1918) * 4th Provisional Brigade Train became 836th Horse Transport Company ASC in 64th Divisionhttp://www.1914-1918.net/asc.htm#ht * 4th Provisional Field Ambulance became 310th and 312th Field Ambulances RAMC Second World War Formation and Service In 1940, during World War II, the brigade number was reactivated for the 224th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), formed for service in the United Kingdom under the South Wales Area headquarters of Home Forces on 10 October 1940. It was commanded by Brigadier P. Gottwaltz, and comprised newly raised infantry battalions Joslen, p. 387. After a brief spell attached to 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division, 224th Brigade became part of the Durham and North Riding County Division on 11 March 1941.Joslen, pp. 110, 387. The brigade was disbanded on 22 December 1941.

A verb whose conjugation follows a different pattern is called an irregular verb. (This is one instance of the distinction between regular and irregular inflection, which can also apply to other word classes, such as nouns and adjectives). In English, for example, verbs such as play, enter, and like are regular since they form their inflected parts by adding the typical endings -s, -ing and -ed to give forms such as plays, entering, and liked. On the other hand, verbs such as drink, hit and have are irregular since some of their parts are not made according to the typical pattern: drank and drunk (not \\"drinked\\"); hit (as past tense and past participle, not \\"hitted\\") and has and had (not \\"haves\\" and \\"haved\\"). The classification of verbs as regular or irregular is to some extent a subjective matter. If some conjugational paradigm in a language is followed by a limited number of verbs, or it requires the specification of more than one principal part (as with the German strong verbs), views may differ as to whether the verbs in question should be considered irregular. Most inflectional irregularities arise as a result of series of fairly uniform historical changes so forms that appear to be irregular from a synchronic (contemporary) point of view may be seen as following more regular patterns when the verbs are analyzed from a diachronic (historical linguistic) viewpoint. Development When a language develops some type of inflection, such as verb conjugation, it normally produces certain typical (regular) patterns by which words in the given class come to make their inflected forms. The language may develop a number of different regular patterns, either as a result of conditional sound changes which cause differentiation within a single pattern, or through patterns with different derivations coming to be used for the same purpose. An example of the latter is provided by the strong and weak verbs of the Germanic languages; the strong verbs inherited their method of making past forms (vowel ablaut) from Proto- Indo-European, while for the weak verbs a different method (addition of dental suffixes) developed. Irregularities in verb conjugation (and other inflectional irregularities) may arise in various ways. Sometimes the result of multiple conditional and selective historical sound changes is to leave certain words following a practically unpredictable pattern. This has happened with the strong verbs (and some groups of weak verbs) in English; patterns such as sing‚Äìsang‚Äìsung and stand‚Äìstood‚Äìstood, although they derive from what were more or less regular patterns in older languages, are now peculiar to a single verb or small group of verbs in each case, and are viewed as irregular. Irregularities may also arise from suppletion ‚Äì forms of one verb may be taken over and used as forms of another. This has happened in the case of the English word went, which was originally the past tense of wend, but has come to be used instead as the past tense of go. The verb be also has a number of suppletive forms (be, is, was, etc., with various different origins) ‚Äì this is common for copular verbs in Indo-European languages. The regularity and irregularity of verbs is affected by changes taking place by way of analogy ‚Äì there is often a tendency for verbs to switch to a different, usually more regular, pattern under the influence of other verbs. This is less likely when the existing forms are very familiar through common use ‚Äì hence among the most common verbs in a language (like be, have, go, etc.) there is often a greater incidence of irregularity. (Analogy can occasionally work the other way, too ‚Äì some irregular English verb forms such as shown, caught and spat have arisen through the influence of existing strong or irregular verbs.) Types of pattern The most straightforward type of regular verb conjugation pattern involves a single class of verbs, a single principal part (the root or one particular conjugated form), and a set of exact rules which produce, from that principal part, each of the remaining forms in the verb's paradigm. This is generally considered to be the situation with regular English verbs ‚Äì from the one principal part, namely the plain form of a regular verb (the bare infinitive, such as play, happen, skim, interchange, etc.), all the other inflected forms (which in English are not numerous; they consist of the third person singular present tense, the past tense and past participle, and the present participle/gerund form) can be derived by way of consistent rules. These rules involve the addition of inflectional endings (-s, -[e]d, -ing), together with certain morphophonological rules about how those endings are pronounced, and certain rules of spelling (such as the doubling of certain consonants). Verbs which in any way deviate from these rules (there are around 200 such verbs in the language) are classed as irregular. A language may have more than one regular conjugation pattern. French verbs, for example, follow different patterns depending on whether their infinitive ends in -er, -ir or -re (complicated slightly by certain rules of spelling). A verb which does not follow the expected pattern based on the form of its infinitive is considered irregular. In some languages, however, verbs may be considered regular even if the specification of one of their forms is not sufficient to predict all of the rest; they have more than one principal part. In Latin, for example, verbs are considered to have four principal parts (see Latin conjugation for details). Specification of all of these four forms for a given verb is sufficient to predict all of the other forms of that verb ‚Äì except in a few cases, when the verb is irregular. To some extent it may be a matter of convention or subjective preference to state whether a verb is regular or irregular. In English, for example, if a verb is allowed to have three principal parts specified (the bare infinitive, past tense and past participle), then the number of irregular verbs will be drastically reduced (this is not the conventional approach, however). The situation is similar with the strong verbs in German (these may or may not be described as irregular). In French, what are traditionally called the \\"regular -re verbs\\" (those that conjugate like vendre) are not in fact particularly numerous, and may alternatively be considered to be just another group of similarly behaving irregular verbs. The most unambiguously irregular verbs are often very commonly used verbs such as the copular verb be in English and its equivalents in other languages, which frequently have a variety of suppletive forms and thus follow an exceptionally unpredictable pattern of conjugation. Irregularity in spelling only It is possible for a verb to be regular in pronunciation, but irregular in spelling. Examples of this are the English verbs lay and pay. In terms of pronunciation, these make their past forms in the regular way, by adding the sound. However their spelling deviates from the regular pattern: they are not spelt (spelled) \\"layed\\" and \\"payed\\" (although the latter form is used in some e.g. nautical contexts as \\"the sailor payed out the anchor chain\\"), but laid and paid. This contrasts with fully regular verbs such as sway and stay, which have the regularly spelt past forms swayed and stayed. The English present participle is never irregular in pronunciation, with the exception that singeing irregularly retains the e to distinguish it from singing. Linguistic study In linguistic analysis, the concept of regular and irregular verbs (and other types of regular and irregular inflection) commonly arises in psycholinguistics, and in particular in work related to language acquisition. In studies of first language acquisition (where the aim is to establish how the human brain processes its native language), one debate among 20th-century linguists revolved around whether small children learn all verb forms as separate pieces of vocabulary or whether they deduce forms by the application of rules.Pinker, Steven. Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language, 1999. . Since a child can hear a regular verb for the first time and immediately reuse it correctly in a different conjugated form which he or she has never heard, it is clear that the brain does work with rules; but irregular verbs must be processed differently. A common error for small children is to conjugate irregular verbs as though they were regular, which is taken as evidence that we learn and process our native language partly by the application of rules, rather than, as some earlier scholarship had postulated, solely by learning the forms. In fact, children often use the most common irregular verbs correctly in their earliest utterances but then switch to incorrect regular forms for a time when they begin to operate systematically. That allows a fairly precise analysis of the phases of this aspect of first language acquisition. Regular and irregular verbs are also of significance in second language acquisition, and in particular in language teaching and formal learning, where rules such as verb paradigms are defined, and exceptions (such as irregular verbs) need to be listed and learned explicitly. The importance of irregular verbs is enhanced by the fact that they often include the most commonly used verbs in the language (including verbs such as be and have in English, their equivalents √™tre and avoir in French, sein and haben in German, etc.). In historical linguistics the concept of irregular verbs is not so commonly referenced. Since most irregularities can be explained by processes of historical language development, these verbs are only irregular when viewed synchronically; they often appear regular when seen in their historical context. In the study of Germanic verbs, for example, historical linguists generally distinguish between strong and weak verbs, rather than irregular and regular (although occasional irregularities still arise even in this approach). When languages are being compared informally, one of the few quantitative statistics which are sometimes cited is the number of irregular verbs. These counts are not particularly accurate for a wide variety of reasons, and academic linguists are reluctant to cite them. But it does seem that some languages have a greater tolerance for paradigm irregularity than others. By language English With the exception of the highly irregular verb be, an English verb can have up to five forms: its plain form (or bare infinitive), a third person singular present tense, a past tense (or preterite), a past participle, and the -ing form that serves as both a present participle and gerund. The rules for the formation of the inflected parts of regular verbs are given in detail in the article on English verbs. In summary they are as follows: *The third person singular present tense is formed by adding the ending -s (or -es after certain letters) to the plain form. When the plain form ends with the letter -y following a consonant, this becomes -ies. The ending is pronounced after a voiceless consonant sound (as in hops, halts, packs, bluffs, laughs), or after a voiced consonant or vowel sound (as in robs, lends, begs, sings, thaws, flies, sighs), but after a sibilant (passes, pushes, marches). *The past tense and past participle are identical; they are formed with the ending -ed, which as in the previous case has three different pronunciations (, , ). Certain spelling rules apply, including the doubling of consonants before the ending in forms like conned and preferred. There is some variation in the application of these spelling rules with some rarer verbs, and particularly with verbs ending -c (panic‚Äìpanicked, zinc‚Äìzinc(k)ed, arc‚Äìarced, etc.), meaning that these forms are not fully predictable, but such verbs are not normally listed among the irregular ones. (The verbs lay and pay, however, are commonly listed as irregular, despite being regular in terms of pronunciation ‚Äì their past forms have the anomalous spellings laid and paid.) *The present participle/gerund is formed by adding -ing, again with the application of certain spelling rules similar to those that apply with -ed. The irregular verbs of English are described and listed in the article English irregular verbs (for a more extensive list, see List of English irregular verbs). In the case of these: *The third person singular present tense is formed regularly, except in the case of the modal verbs (can, shall, etc.) which do not add -s, the verb be (which has three present indicative forms: am, is and are), and the three verbs have, do and say, which produce the forms has, does (pronounced with a short vowel, ), and says (pronounced with a short vowel, ).say - Definition and pronunciation  Oxford Advanced American Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com *The past tense and past participle forms are the forms most commonly made in irregular fashion. About 200 verbs in normal use have irregularities in one or other (or usually both) of these forms. They may derive from Germanic strong verbs, as with sing‚Äìsang‚Äìsung or rise‚Äìrose‚Äìrisen, or from weak verbs which have come to deviate from the standard pattern in some way (teach‚Äìtaught‚Äìtaught, keep‚Äìkept‚Äìkept, build‚Äìbuilt‚Äìbuilt, etc.). (The past participle often ends in \\"n\\", \\" d\\" or \\"ed\\".) The past and past participle forms change in spelling sometimes. *The present participle/gerund is formed regularly, in -ing (except for those defective verbs, such as the modals, which lack such a form). = Common irregular verbs= Some examples of common irregular verbs in English, other than modals, are: * arise * be * come * do * eat * fall * get * give * go * have * hear * know * lend * make * run * say * see * take * think * wear Other languages For regular and irregular verbs in other languages, see the articles on the grammars of those languages.

Constructed languages Most natural languages, to different extents, have a number of irregular verbs. Artificial auxiliary languages usually have a single regular pattern for all verbs (as well as other parts of speech) as a matter of design, because inflectional irregularities are considered to increase the difficulty of learning and using a language. Other constructed languages, however, need not show such regularity, especially if they are designed to look similar to natural ones.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Whalley, the archdeaconry of Blackburn, and the diocese of Blackburn. Its benefice is united with that of St Michael, Whitewell. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History A church has been present in the village since at least 1230, and it is possible that a church was here during the Saxon era. The tower was added in about 1450, and the rest of the church was rebuilt in 1506. Further rebuilding took place in 1872, and most of the exterior is the result of that rebuilding. Architecture Exterior St Bartholomew's is constructed in sandstone rubble with a stone slate roof. Its plan consists of a three-bay nave, north and south aisles, a two-bay chancel, a south porch, and a west tower. The tower is in three stages, with diagonal buttresses. It has a west doorway, above which is a three-light window. The bell openings have two lights. On the south side of the roof of the body of the church is a dormer with a five-light mullioned window under a timber gable. In the south wall of the chancel is a priest's door. The east window has five lights. Interior Inside the church there is no division between the nave and the chancel. The five-bay arcade is carried on octagonal piers, the arches on the north side being lower and more pointed. Some of the capitals on the north arcade have carvings; these include a female head dating from the 14th century, a snake, flowers, and a pair of faces. In the south wall of the chancel is a 13th-century piscina. The octagonal font has concave sides and is crudely carved with emblems, including the instruments of the Passion. One of the windows contains stained glass by Shrigley and Hunt dating from 1966 with a semi-abstract design. In the church is a brass to the two wives of Robert Parkingson; they died in 1611 and 1623 respectively. Another brass is to the 15th Earl of Derby who died in 1893. There are also monuments dated 1777 and 1816. The two-manual pipe organ was made in 1876 by Henry Willis, and restored in 2003 by David Wells. There is a ring of six bells, all of which were cast in 1793 by Thomas Mears I at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. External features In the churchyard, to the south of the church, is a sundial dated 1708. It is in sandstone, and consists of a square base with three steps, supporting a square fluted Doric column with a base and a capital. On the top is a round brass plate with a gnomon. On the side of the sundial is a plaque inscribed with initials and the date. The sundial is listed at Grade II. Also listed at Grade II are the walls around the churchyard, and the flight of steps leading up towards the church.

While its history dates back to 1143 when a hospice with a chapel was constructed on the site, the present church in the Gothic style was built by Provost Vitus Fackler in 1508. After bombing damage in the Second World War, rebuilding work was completed in 1949.\\"Heilig-Kreuz-Kirche, Augsburg\\", Schwabenmedia.de. Retrieved 10 April 2013. Right next to this church is the Evangelical Holy Cross Church, Augsburg. History The site of the Holy Cross Hospice was located outside the town walls of Augsburg. The name stems from an ancient cross relic which can still be seen in the Diocesan Museum. In the late 12th century, the Bishop of Augsburg put the hospice into the care of the Augustinian Canons Regular. At the beginning of the 13th century, a small wooden church for the parishioners and a simple convent were built.\\"Die Geschichte der Wallfahrtskirche Heilig Kreuz\\", Dominikaner Augsburg. Retrieved 10 April 2013. A miracle was said to have occurred in 1194 when a woman took a piece of the sacramental communion bread back home. The longer she kept it, the more it appeared to be transformed into a mysterious blood-red object. Five years later, she finally confessed to her misdemeanor and returned the sacrement to the priest. A miracle was declared, making the church a popular destination for pilgrimages right up to the 20th century. A wooden church tower was built around 1200 on graves dating from Roman times but it burnt to the ground in 1314. As a result, a stone church in the Romanesque style together with a new convent was built the following year. In 1502, unhappy with the Romanesque building, Provost Vitus Fackler had a large Gothic hall church built, probably charging Burkhart Engelberg with its design. After it was completed in 1508, a higher tower and a copper roof were added (1514‚Äì1517). In 1627, Provost Johannes Schall provided the church with a new altar, seats and a pulpit. A full transformation to the Baroque style was completed by Johann Jakob Herkommer under the leadership of Provost Augustin von Imhoff in 1716. After serious bomb damage in February 1944 which left little more than the outer walls and the organ loft, painstaking rebuilding work was completed in 1949. Repairs to the adjacent convent building were completed in 1958.

He is now remembered for his part in the first London Penny Post. Early life Born in the Strand, London, he was son of Robert Murray, a tailor. In 1649 he was entered as an apprentice in the books of the Clothworkers' Company, and took up his freedom in 1660. He is subsequently spoken of as \\"milliner\\" and \\"uphosterer\\" but may have retired from trade when he was writing. The Penny Post of 1680 Penny Post stamps (1680‚Äì82) It has been argued that the Penny Post's launch at the period of the exclusion crisis was no coincidence. It was announced on 22 March 1679 in the Mercurius Civicus, a Whig paper. It has been claimed that the opposition leader Lord Shaftesbury was a backer of the scheme, as he was of the paper. Murray with William Dockwra opened for business with a penny post service on 27 March 1680. They offered to take letters \\"to any part of the City, or Suburbs\\", for a penny. Hugh Chamberlen and perhaps Henry Neville Payne were partners. The scheme was initially denounced by Titus Oates, because Payne who claimed a share in the concept was a Tory. But it was in fact taken up swiftly as a channel for distribution of anti-government writings. Coffee houses were used to pick up and drop posts. Murray very shortly got into trouble connected with his support for the Duke of Monmouth. He then worked as an agent for Shaftesbury, and went to ground. He assigned his interest in the postal scheme to Dockwra; but later it was adjudged to pertain to James, Duke of York, as a branch of the general post office, by the King's Bench. Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington was brought in to run it in 1682, at the point when Shaftesbury went into self-imposed exile. The business itself thrived for a period.postalheritage.org.uk, London Penny Post. Whig agent and official In July 1682 Murray was in contact with the Covenanter Alexander Gordon of Earlston. Gordon had come to London as a Covenanter representative; and Murray passed on plans for a putative uprising. He was in Paris in August 1682, meeting with Huguenot supporters of Shaftesbury. His French journey became known to Leoline Jenkins. In the mid-1690s Murray was proposing a \\"land bank\\", an idea up in the air at the time and also promoted by Chamberlen and John Briscoe. His ideas for paying off the national debt over a decade, aided by a malt tax, attracted attention. Murray became clerk to the general commissioners for the revenue of Ireland, and clerk to the commissioners of the grand excise of England. In August 1697 he had been active in the malt tax proposals in parliament, and was then in custody in a sponging house near St. Clement's Church. In 1703 he offered to the Lord High Treasurer a scheme for tin, and asked for the royal bounty. Later life Some time before July 1720 a Robert Murray succeeded George Murray as comptroller and paymaster of the lottery of 1714, and had transactions with the South Sea Company. (There is some doubt raised about the identification, however.) Lotteries had been prohibited under William III and Mary II, but from 1709 onwards the government resorted to them as a means of raising money. In 1714 exchequer bills had been issued to the amount of ¬£1,400,000 but lottery prizes were offered in addition to interest in the shape of annuities. In 1721, after a memorial from Murray, the South Sea Company proposed to discharge the unsubscribed orders into their own capital stock. Murray was, however, superseded as paymaster of this lottery in 1724, and in February 1726 is spoken of as dead. Works For several years from 1676 Murray wrote on matters of banking and national revenue. He published: * A Proposal for the Advancement of Trade, London, 1676; proposed was establishment of a combined bank and Lombard or mont de pi√©t√© for the issue of credit against \\"dead stock\\" deposited at 6 per cent. * Composition Credit, or a Bank of Credit made Current by Common Consent in London more Useful than Money, London, 1682. * An Account of the Constitution and Security of the General Bank of Credit, London, 1683. * A Proposal for the more easy advancing to the Crown any fixed Sum of Money to carry on the War against France. A proposal to establish negotiable bills of credit on security of some branch of the royal revenue; Murray's credit bank proposals presage the scheme of John Law. * A Proposal for the better securing our Wool against Exportation by working up and manufacturing such. A proposal to revive the law of the wool staple, and to establish a royal company of staplers. * A Proposal for translating the Duty of Excise from Malt Drinks to Mast, whereby may be advanced to the Crown 15 Millions for the War against France. * An Advertisement for the more Easy and Speedy Collecting of Debts.

Other members of the Board of Directors include prominent Belgian politicians, honorary ambassadors, public officials and academics.Board Egmont Institute The director general is the former ambassador Johan Verbeke.Staff Egmont Institute  Mission  The Royal Institute for International Relations is an independent think-tank based in Brussels. Its interdisciplinary research is conducted in a spirit of total academic freedom. Drawing on the expertise of its own research fellows, as well as that of external specialists, both Belgian and foreign, it provides analysis and policy options that are meant to be as operational as possible.  Research  Policy research is a core activity of the Egmont institute. The research takes place within the framework of three research programmes: European Affairs (dealing with European integration), Europe in the world (dealing with Europe‚Äôs role in international relations) and Africa (focusing mostly on Sub-Saharan and Central Africa).  European Affairs  Situated in Brussels at the heart of EU political decision-making an under the direction of Jean-Louis de Brouwer, former Director at the European Commission, the European Affairs Programme aims to provide in-depth as well as policy-oriented analyses on a wide range of topics of relevance to EU policy-makers. Special attention is devoted to those matters that are ‚Äì or ought to be ‚Äì at the heart of the EU policy debate. Aside from a continuous focus on institutional matters, various substantive EU policies dominate the research agenda, such as the single market, energy and climate and the EU budget. The Programme also deals extensively with the evolution of the Economic and Monetary Union in the context of the economic and financial crisis. Intent on reaching the broadest audience possible, the European Affairs Programme seeks to share its expertise and stimulate the debate on the European project through a variety of publications as well by organizing roundtables, expert-seminars and conferences.  Europe in the World  Under the direction of Prof. Sven BIscop, the Europe in the World Programme starts from the firm assumption that the development of the European Union as an autonomous international actor in all areas of external action is a positive evolution. It offers the best chances for effective European policies to safeguard and enhance universal values and the national interests of EU Member States in an increasingly multipolar world. At the same time, the programme aims to critically and scientifically examine EU objectives, instruments and means, in order to assess their effectiveness, identify the weaknesses, and offer some recommendations for the way ahead, so as to improve the ‚Äústrategic actorness‚Äù of the Union. Our research focuses on European strategy and strategic culture; European and transatlantic military and civilian institutions, capabilities, and industries; the EU‚Äôs strategic partnerships with great and emerging powers; as well as political and security developments in key geographic areas (Europe‚Äôs southern neighbourhood and the Asia-Pacific region). The programme also covers various aspects of Belgian diplomacy, and in the past has undertaken extensive research on terrorism.  Africa  Under the direction of Prof. Nina Wil√©n, the main objective of the Africa Programme is to conduct research on political, economic, social and security issues and developments relating to Central and Eastern Africa. This research also relates to the major trends on the African continent (African Union, Regional Integration, conflict analysis and post-conflict reconstruction, state building and peace building) and it analyses the role and position of the EU in Sub-Saharan Africa. Through its own research and publications, a wide range of contacts, partnerships and activities with national and international research institutes, public authorities and NGOs, the programme contributes to the Belgian and international policy debate on Africa. The main tool for that policy debate is the ‚ÄòObservatoire de l‚ÄôAfrique‚Äô a network of European and African institutes and experts on peace and security issues in Africa. The ambition of the ‚ÄòObservatoire de l‚ÄôAfrique‚Äô is to promote open and constructive dialogue and debate, and to provide useful analysis to a wide range of policy makers.  Training  The Egmont Education & Training Programme organises training courses for foreign diplomats and high executives at the request of public administrations from Belgium and third countries, including the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Such courses are tailor- made with presentations, training sessions and simulation exercises conducted by experts and high-level diplomats, adapted to the recipient countries. It also has developed extensive expertise in the field of public administration through support to the initial and continuous training of foreign public servants. This expertise started to develop with a first partnership with the National School for Public Administration of the Democratic Republic of Congo, ENA RDC. This partnership has run for 5 years and increased over time. New partnerships are being developed in priority countries of the Belgian development cooperation. The success of the existing projects and prospects for future partnerships led to the conclusion of a Framework Agreement for Cooperation in the sector of Governance and Public Administration between the Egmont Institute and the Belgian Development Cooperation Agency, Enabel. The Egmont Institute is an active partner of the Belgian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Belgian Federal Police and the Belgian Ministry of Justice in the field of civilian crisis management. Since 2009, we have been responsible for the organisation of the Belgian core course for experts to be deployed in missions, the Belgian Generic Training (BGT). This core course is a unique initiative to promote an integrated and shared learning for experts from different professional backgrounds (civil servants, police officers and external experts) who aim at being deployed in missions by Belgium. This training course therefore constitutes a prerequisite for the secondment in mission by Belgium.  Events  The Egmont Institute organizes various events, mostly in Brussels. According to the Institute, its events aim to foster dialogue between researchers, policy-makers and civil society. The Egmont Institute furthermore serves as a forum for visiting heads of state or government, representatives of international organizations and foreign ministers.  Partnerships  The Egmont Institute takes part in numerous projects and networks, in collaboration with other research centers. It is a lead partner in the European Strategic Partnerships Observatory and l‚ÄôObservatoire de l'Afrique. The Egmont Institute is also a member of the European Security and Defence College (ESDC), the Euro-Mediterranean Study Commission (EuroMeSCo), the European Policy Institutes Network (EPIN), Think Global ‚Äì Act European (TGAE), the Brussels Think Tank Dialogue (BTTD), Europe- Africa Policy Research Network (EARN), and Expertise for Central Africa (E-CA). The institute regularly collaborates with the Belgian Royal High Institute for Defence. In 2012, the Egmont Institute and the European Defence Agency launched the PhD Prize in European Defence, Security and Strategy.

She is the founder & president of Annapurna's World Vegetarian Cafe based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States.  Early life  Yashoda Devi Naidoo was on April 12, 1963 to Indian parents. Their lineage was routed to the Krishna District of the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. Her mother was a homemaker, and her father was a business man. The family moved to Africa on business where Yashoda was born. Yashoda completed her Bachelor of Commerce degree from University of Natal (now University of KwaZulu-Natal) in South Africa and received CPA qualification from the University of South Africa. She wanted to join medical school but had to join the accounting upon the advice of her mother for job assurance. She later did her master's as a Chartered Accountant.  Profile  After completing her education in South Africa, she moved to Florida, United States to work with Arthur Andersen. While she was working, she happened to visit her cousin in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She fell in love with the place and decided to move to Albuquerque. Having married to a vegetarian from New Mexico, who had well-established connections with Indian monks and gurus, their house had become a first stop for all the visiting gurus. Her role turned to a vegetarian cook from a corporate accountant. When she started serving the vegetarian community, she realized how liberating the cooking was. That inspired her to start and promote the spirit of vegetarianism. She started catering to the local spas, the Ayurvedic Institute, and yoga studios in Albuquerque. With in a short time, the effort was realized in the form of Annapurna's World vegetarian cafe. Vegetarianism Yashoda's Hindu lineage inspired her to heal people through healthy diet. Being a vegetarian by herself form childhood, Yashoda has committed to this spirit and used it to promote a healthy life. She promulgates the spirit of Hippocrates: \\"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food\\". She designed a unique menu for Annapurna's. Annapurna's serves healthy and natural diet and it is one of the two restaurants in New Mexico to serve the alternative eating options. Yashoda's business sagacity and her pledge to Ayurvedic principles are the motive forces behind her initiation of Annapurna's. Ayurvedic cooking forbids conventional eating habits and ingredients like meat, white sugar, alcoholic beverages, chilled/carbonated drinks, and canned/frigid vegetables and prescribes fresh, easy-to-digest organic foods. Being a promoter of Ayurveda, India‚Äôs 5,000-year-old medical science, Annapurna's serves appropriate diet and spice combinations designed to soothe the three predominant body constitutions called doshas in Ayurveda, whose constitution sustains welfare of the body and mind. Yashoda is committed to customer oriented service and states her cause as \\"educating, supporting, and motivating the customer to heal and pursue wellness from good food\\".http://stg4lb.docstoc.com/docs/10262961/SBA-Albuquerque-District-Office- Read-more4 Annapurna's Annapurna's has been a member of the green initiative since the first day of operations making it a place that not only cares for the physical health but also for the ecological well-being.

Annapurna's uses alternative grain flours in many of its menu items, providing a much needed alternative for people with wheat allergies and celiac disease. The breads made here are yeast-free to accommodate woman with candida issues. The dishes are meticulously kept free of nightshade vegetables to accommodate people with rheumatoid arthritis.

It is a potential space in the side of the head, and is paired on either side. It is located posterior to the maxilla, between the lateral pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone medially and by the base of skull superiorly. The term is derived from infra- meaning below and temporal which refers to the temporalis muscle. The infratemporal space is the inferior portion of the deep temporal space, which is one of the four compartments of the masticator space, along with the pterygomandibular space, the submasseteric space and the superficial temporal space. The deep temporal space is separated from the pterygomandibular space by the lateral pterygoid muscle inferiorly and from the superficial temporal space by the temporalis muscle laterally.

Contents The contents of the infratemporal space are: * branches of the maxillary artery, * the pterygoid venous plexus. Clinical relevance Infections of the infratemporal space are rare. They may be significant however, as it is possible for infection to spread via emissary veins from the pterygoid plexus to the cavernous sinus, which may result in cavernous sinus thrombosis, a rare but life-threatening condition. The signs and symptoms of an infratemporal space infection are swelling of the face in the region of the sigmoid notch, swelling of the mouth in the region of the maxillary tuberosity and marked trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), since some of the muscles of mastication are restricted by the swelling. Treatment of an abscess of this space is usually by surgical incision and drainage, with the incision being placed on the face (a small horizontal incision posterior to the junction of the temporal and frontal process of the zygomatic bone. or both on the face and inside the mouth.

It is the sole species in the monotypic genus Xerocladia. Name This plant was first discovered in 1822 and named Acacia viridiramis by Burchell. In 1862, Harvey described the new genus Xerocladia, based on his species Xerocladia zeyheri Harv. In 1891, Taubert studied this species and discovered that Burchell and Harvey were actually describing the same species. He also determined that the plant doesn‚Äôt fit into the genus Acacia and kept the name Xerocladia. Because the earliest publication (after 1753) has priority, Taubert made the new combination Xerocladia viridiramis (Burch.) Taub. In conclusion, Acacia viridiramis Burch. is the basionym for Xerocladia viridiramis (Burch.) Taub, and Xerocladia zeyheri Harv. is a synonym. Geographic distribution South West Africa and Namaqualand, occurs in sandy to gravel riverbeds, or on riverbanks.

They both have stipular spines, leaves with few pairs of pinnae, and 10 stamens. In contrast to Xerocladia, Prosopis usually has a spicate inflorescence instead of a capitulum, an elongate straight or spiral legume pod which is not winged.

The party was founded in 2005 after the formation of Alliance for National Unity and Cultural Association Sisebuto King. Its first congress was held on April 30, 2006 in Valencia, although they had held public appearances since the previous year.  Ideology and policies  AN declares itself the ideological heir of European fascism and argues that the \\"jus sanguinis\\" (Right of Blood) should be used to determine the national origin of an individual. As well as these racial criteria, they are committed to a socialist economic policy, hence the theme of the training slogan: \\"Nation, Race, Socialism\\". Displays often incorporate party symbols adopted from other nationalist and extreme right organizations. They also promote the expulsion of immigrants from Spain and are against same-sex marriage. AN acknowledges as a major ideological and political influence nationalist Ramiro Ledesma Ramos and JONS and his calls for direct action. Party leader Pedro Pablo Pe√±a, known for his rather volatile, quarrelsome demeanor and his outbursts justifying \\"bloodbaths\\" in Catalonia, has displayed a somehow inconsistent worldview, at times holding back his hostility towards Israeli Jews or ETA on account of their ability to defend themselves (\\"I admire whoever fights\\") to the point of even confronting other far-right activists in seemingly spontaneous episodes, and yet, most often, ridiculing Israel's alleged military incompetence and bridging the gap between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism with claims about the Holo-hoax (holocuento).  National Alliance manifesto  The National Alliance manifesto includes: * Defending the indivisibility of the Spanish state, particularly as regards its territorial integrity and as an administrative unit; opposing any form of separatism. * The tightening of immigration control and the immediate expulsion of all undocumented immigrants within the country, and the reversal of regularization measures implemented by PP and PSOE governments. * Preferential treatment of the ethnically Spanish in access to public services and public sector employment at the expense of foreign nationals. * A Clause of the State, recognizing the contribution of Catholicism in the historical construction of Spain. * Tighter state regulation of the means of production and banking, limiting what they term \\"interest slavery\\". * Opposition to the privatization of the public sector. * Suppression of institutions or groups that, according to AN, \\"threaten the unity of Spain.\\" * Claiming Greek, Latin and Visigoth heritage as the \\"original roots of the Spanish ethnicity\\". AN argue that the \\"coexistence of three cultures\\" is just a historical distortion. They reject the theories which they designate \\"cultural homogenization\\" or \\"globalization\\" and argue that these are imposed by the United States.  National Action Alliance policy  AN is based on his political agitation and advertising . Opting for performing acts such as those in Valencia on May 1 of 2006 and in Malaga on October 12 of that year in April or in Segovia on May 1, 2007.

He is known for his work between 1882 and 1885 in establishing a European presence in the regions around Lake Tanganyika, during which he supported the White Fathers missionaries and attempted to suppress the East African slave trade. Early years √âmile Pierre Joseph Storms was born at Wetteren, East Flanders in Belgium on 2 June 1846. On 11 December 1861 he joined the 5th Infantry Regiment. He was promoted to second-lieutenant in the 10th Regiment on 25 June 1870, and to Lieutenant in the 9th Regiment on 25 March 1876. He was admitted to the Belgium's military academy on 29 August 1878. He volunteered for the International African Association, and on 25 February 1882 was assigned to the Cartographic Institute. He was given the task of leading an expedition to explore the east coast of Africa. Expedition to Equatorial Africa Outward journey On 10 April 1882 Storms left Europe for Zanzibar. On his arrival his companion, Lieutenant Camille Constant of the grenadiers, fell ill and had to return to Europe. Storms learned that his contact, Guillaume Ramaeckers, had died at Karema on 25 February 1882. On 8 June 1882 Storms left the coast and marched via the mission of Tabora to Karema on the east coast of Lake Tanganyika. The journey was difficult and the caravan was attacked by Rouga-Rouga warriors several times. He reached Karema on 27 September 1882, where he found the station still held by Lieutenant J√©r√¥me Becker, whose term of service had expired. Karema Display dedicated to Storms in the Mus√©e royal de l'Afrique centrale Yassagula, chief of the village of Karema, attacked the station soon after Storms arrived. Becker counterattacked with his askaris, put Yassagula's men to flight and destroyed the village. A few months later Yassagula submitted, and from then on was a reliable ally. Becker left the station on 17 November on his homeward journey. Storms strengthened and expanded the post, which was now called Fort L√©opold, and started to grow vegetables. He responded to an attack on his couriers with an expedition that defeated the rebel chief on 23 April 1883. However, the German scientist Richard B√∂hm who accompanied Storms was struck by two bullets in the leg during this action and was laid up for several months. Mpala Storms had been charged with establishing a second post on Lake Tanganyika. He left B√∂hm in charge of Karema. Storms embarked on 27 April 1883 with B√∂hm's companion Paul Reichard and 24 askaris and sailed to Mompara on the west shore of the lake. There he found a peaceful and friendly population who offered food. Looking for a good place to establish a post, he made contact with the chief Mpala, who gave permission to build the post in his territory. On 4 May 1883 the foundations of the station of Mpala were laid. Chief Mpala became a blood- brother in a ceremony on 25 June 1883. Storms left Reichart to supervise the work while he went to Ujiji to buy a boat and obtain some trade goods. Storms was back at Mpala on 15 August 1883. Both of his boats were wrecked in a storm shortly after his arrival, and he had to build another before he could return to Karema. The main street and the great stockade built by Storms at Mpala The alliance with the chief Mpala proved valuable. The chief caught smallpox, but before dying ordered the village elders to respect Storms. Storms gained authority during the two and a half years he spent at Mpala. The local chiefs came to rely on him for a monthly salary and for protection. Storms had his people build a great square stockade on each side, using five thousand trees. The walls were made of mudbrick and were thick. The interior had seventeen rooms around a covered courtyard. However, on 19 May 1885 the stockade burned to the ground. Once the dried thatch had caught fire, little could be saved apart from the gunpowder. On 6 September 1884 Storms was visited by White Fathers missionaries led by R. P. Moinet, whom he helped to settle in Tchanza, one day south of Mpala. On 30 November 1884 Reichart arrived at Mpala, returning from an exploration of Katanga, and told him that B√∂hm had died on the journey. Storms found himself in a violent confrontation with Lusinga Iwa Ngombe, a powerful slaver whom the explorer Joseph Thomson called a \\"sanguinary potentate\\". In November, while in Karema, Storms heard that Lusinga was preparing to make war on Mpala. Storms hired 150 Rouga Rouga, crossed the lake and attacked Lusinga, who was defeated. Lusinga was beheaded. Another leader, Kansawara, who had previously submitted to Storms, decided to move into the vacancy left by Lusinga. He was defeated on 15 December 1884 and soon afterwards again submitted to Storms. Recall At the Berlin Conference (1884-1885) the east side of the lake was assigned to the German sphere of influence. King Leopold II of Belgium decided to focus his colonizing efforts on the lower Congo. He asked Mgr. Charles Lavigerie, the founder of the White Fathers missionary society, if he would like to replace the Belgian agents by missionaries at the two stations on Lake Tanganyika. At the end of May 1885, Storms received a letter from Brussels recalling him. When Storms heard that he was to be replaced, he was furious. However, when two French priests, Isaac Moinet and Auguste Moncet, reached Mpala on 5 July 1885, Captain Storms handed over the fort, arms and ammunition, a sailboat and a garrison of askaris who had been paid for six months. Moinet jokingly asked Storms what title he should take as successor to \\"His Majesty Emile the First, King of Tanganyika\\", and signed a letter he wrote to Storms \\"I, Moinet, Acting King of Mpala.\\" However, the priests were committed to Lavigerie's dream of a Christian Kingdom in the heart of equatorial Africa, and saw the territory that Storms had acquired as the invaluable nucleus of the new state. After installing the missionaries at Mpala and Karema, Storms left for the coast at the end of July. After a difficult journey, he reached Europe on 21 December 1885. Later career In February 1888 Storms was given the technical direction of the Belgian anti-slavery expedition to Lake Tanganyika. The Belgian Anti-Slavery Society, founded by Cardinal Lavigerie, had General Jacmart as President. The objective was to abolish the slave trade in Africa, and a corps of volunteers was sent to operate on Lake Tanganyika. On 20 December 1891 the society launched a boat named Storms on the lake. Storms reached the rank of General in the army. He died on 12 January 1918 at Ixelles, in Brussels. Awards and commemoration Storms was an officer of the Order of Leopold and received various decorations and honors. A monument was erected to him in his home town of Wetteren, and a bust was placed in the square of l'Industrie in Brussels, today renamed Square de Mee√ªs. In the aftermath of the George Floyd protests, in June 2020, the bust was vandalised with red paint. On 1 July 2020 it was reported that the communal authorities of Ixelles planned to remove the bust from the square and transfer it to the Royal Museum for Central Africa.

Unlike Mother's Day and Father's Day, it is not federally recognized in the United States, though the Siblings Day Foundation is working to change this. Since 1998, the governors of 49 states have officially issued proclamations to recognize Siblings Day in their state. Siblings Days are celebrated also in the United Kingdom, and India. The Hindu holiday of Raksha Bandhan also celebrates the bond of brothers and sisters. History Siblings Day poster, published by APFN, the Portuguese Large Families Association, May 2016. The US holiday was conceived by Claudia Evart to honor the memory of her brother and sister, who died at early ages. The Siblings Day Foundation was incorporated in 1997 and achieved non-profit status in 1999. Carolyn Maloney, then the U.S. Representative for , officially saluted the holiday and introduced it into the official Congressional Record of the United States Congress on April 10, 1997; and in subsequent years 2001, 2005 and 2008. In Europe, the holiday was launched in 2014 by the European Large Families Confederation (ELFAC) to celebrate siblings bonds and relationships. The May 31 feast spread in different ways in the European countries where ELFAC is present. In Portugal, Dia dos Irm√£os has become very popular and the President of Republic of Portugal has greeted it publicly, in 2016 and 2017. ELFAC has associate members in several European countries: Austria, Cyprus, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Serbia and Switzerland. But adherence to the date and spirit of May 31 is open to any other European or non-European country. Celebration In the United States, approximately 80% of people have siblings. The holiday is intended to be a celebration of the relationship of brothers and sisters. Examples of commemoration during this observance include giving your sibling a gift (including a surprise gift), a giftcard, and taking one out for dinner.The Oamaru Telegram Issue 192: Nonmaterial examples of observances during this day includes giving hugs to your sibling(s), enjoying time with them, honoring their presence in your life, and greeting them on various social media platforms using childhood photos.Twelve Principles of the Gilded Nest: Designing for the Soul of the Home, p 97, 2002Chases Calendar of Events, 2012 Edition, McGraw Hill Professional See also * Children's Day * Rakhri * Raksha Bandhan: a popular, traditionally Hindu, annual Siblings Day References External links * Siblings Day Foundation * Fox News Video on Siblings Day * Brothers and Sisters Day Category:April observances Category:Customs involving siblings Category:Family member holidays Category:May observances Category:Sibling ","title":"Siblings Day"},{"id":"39073096","text":"Nance‚ÄìHoran syndrome is a rare X linked syndrome characterized by congenital cataract leading to profound vision loss, characteristic dysmorphic features and dental anomalies.

Cheirisophus () was a Spartan general who fought with the Ten Thousand under Cyrus the Younger. Cheirisophus was sent by the Spartan ephors with 700 heavily armed men (800 according to Diodorus Siculus) to aid Cyrus the Younger in his expedition against his brother Artaxerxes in 401 BC. He joined Cyrus on his march at Issus in Cilicia.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica xiv 19, 21\\"Cheirisophus the Lacedaemonian also arrived with this fleet, coming in response to Cyrus' summons, together with seven hundred hoplites, over whom he continued to hold command in the army of Cyrus.\\" Xenophon, Anabasis 1.4.3 After the Battle of Cunaxa, Clearchus sent Cheirisophus with a delegation to the Persian general Ariaeus to make an offer of placing him on the Persian throne, an offer which Ariaeus declined. After the arrest of Clearchus and the other generals, through the treachery of Tissaphernes, Cheirisophus took an active part in encouraging the troops and in otherwise dealing with the emergency of being a leaderless army deep in enemy territory, and, on the suggestion of Xenophon, was appointed to lead the vanguard of the retreating army. He held this post throughout the retreat in cooperation with Xenophon. There was only one time that any difference arose between them, and that was caused by Cheirisophus having struck, in a fit of angry suspicion, an Armenian who was guiding them, and who left them because of the insult.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica xiv. 27Xenophon, Anabasis iii. 2. ~ 33, &c.;, 3. ~~ 3, 11, 4. ~~ 38-43, 5. ~~ 1-6, iv. 1. ~~ 6, 15-22, 2. ~ 23, &c.;, iii. ~~ 8, 25, &c.;, 6. ~~ 1-3.

On the sixth or seventh day after Cheirisophus's election, these troops, who formed more than half the army, separated themselves from the rest and departed by sea under ten generals whom they had appointed. Xenophon then offered to continue the march with the remainder of the forces, under the command of Cheirisophus, but Cheirisophus declined the proposal based on advice from Neon, who hoped to find vessels at Calpe furnished by Cleander, the Spartan harmost at Byzantium, and wished to reserve them exclusively for their own portion of the army. With the small division still under his command, Cheirisophus arrived safely at Calpe, where he died from the effects of a medicine which he had taken for a fever.Xenophon, Anabasis vi. 2. 4, 4. ~ 11 Notes Category:Anabasis (Xenophon) Category:Ancient Spartan generals Category:Military personnel of the Achaemenid Empire Category:5th-century BC Spartans Category:4th-century BC Spartans ","title":"Cheirisophus (general)"},{"id":"39073314","text":"Salvatore Riccobono enjoyed an extremely long, influential, and productive career as a Roman law scholar, and died in Rome in April 1958. A. Arthur Schiller, \\"Salvatore Riccobono--In Memoriam,\\" 18 Jurist 373 (1958). His exact date of death is not clear. Schiller gives it as April 12, as does the memorial note by Stephen Kuttner at 7 Am. J. Comp. L. 661 (1958). The biographical sketch on the Sicilian Institute of Political and Economic Studies (Istituto Siciliano di Studi Politici ed Economici--ISSPE) web site has it as April 5, as does another Italian web site: Rosanna Ortu, ‚ÄúSalvatore Riccobono nell' Universita di Sassari available at . A memorial by Brendan F. Brown at 9 Loyola L. Rev. 30 (1957-59), on the other hand, states it was April 6. Early life and education Riccobono was born on January 31, 1864 in the village of San Giuseppe Jato, near Palermo, Sicily.‚ÄùSalvatore Ricconono, Jr.,‚Äù (Istituto Siciliano di Studi Politici ed Economici website biography) available at . See also, Schiller, supra note 1. He received his early education in Palermo, then served in the Italian army at age 20.ISSPE biography, supra note 1. Afterwards, he attended the University of Palermo, earning his law degree in 1889.Id. See also Schiller, supra note 1. Riccobono‚Äôs future career as a scholar of Roman law was affected greatly by his four years of graduate study in Germany, where he learned from such noted scholars as Ernst Eck, Heinrich Dernburg, Otto Lenel, Otto Gradenwitz, and Bernhard Windscheid from 1889-93. His year at the University of Leipzig, in 1890-91, with Windscheid, had an especially strong impact on his career.ISSPE biography, supra note 1 and Schiller, supra note 1 at 373-374. Career When Riccobono returned to Italy in 1893, he gained from his association with another eminent Roman law scholar, Vittorio Scialoja, who helped him find a university position there.ISSPE biography, supra note 1. Riccobono held positions at the universities of Parma (1895), Camerino (1895‚Äì96), and Sassari (1897) until he was given the chair of Roman law at his alma mater, the University of Palermo.A detailed account of his time at Sassari is given in Ortu, supra note 1. He served at the University of Palermo from 1897 until 1931, acting at different times as rector of the university and dean of the faculty of law, in addition to being a faculty member. In 1932, he replaced Scialoja at the Universita di Roma. Dr. Riccobono also taught history and Roman law at the Pontifical Lateran Institute in Rome until he retired completely at the end of 1955.ISSPE biography, supra note 1, Ortu, supra note 1, and Schiller, supra note 1 at 374. Legacy In the course of his sixty- five year career as a scholar of Roman law, Riccobono contributed much to the literature of his field, but three contributions in particular should be mentioned. He was the first to evaluate critically the then recently rediscovered technique of interpolation and to use the study of interpolations as a means to understand changes in classical law doctrines, instead of viewing the discovery of interpolations as an end in itself. Also, his study of the Scholia Sinaitica was especially useful and well received. And Riccobono was one of the scholars who edited the pre-Justinian sources of Roman law, which was published as Fontes Iuris Romani Antejustiniani (1909).Schiller, supra note 1 at 375-376. Schiller describes Ricconono‚Äôs scholarship in detail at 375-381, as does Ortu, supra note 1. He had a reputation as ‚Äúthe Great Conservative‚Äù among modern Roman historians and insisted that Justinian‚Äôs Corpus Juris Civilis was Roman in spirit, rather than Hellenistic.Kuttner, supra note 1 at 661-662. See also, Brown, supra note 1. Riccobono directly influenced Roman law scholarship in the United States, as well. In 1928-29, the Catholic University of America invited him to give a course in Roman law.Schiller, supra note 1 at 382. He gave one series of lectures on the ‚ÄúEvolution of Roman Law from the Law of the Twelve Tables to Justinian,‚Äù and a second on the ‚ÄúInfluence of Christianity on Roman Law in the IV and V Centuries A.D.‚ÄùId. and mimeographed three-paged announcement ‚ÄúThe Catholic University of America, Course in Roman Law.‚Äù The announcement notes that Riccobono‚Äôs specialty is ‚Äúthe support of ‚Äòtraditionalism‚Äô in opposition to the views of the interpolationists‚Ä¶‚Äù His first series of lectures appears to have embodied the views expressed in the law review article Salvatore Riccobono, ‚ÄúOutlines of the Evolution of Roman Law,‚Äù 74 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1 (1925-26). In response to these lectures, the Catholic University created ‚ÄúThe Riccobono Seminar of Roman Law in America,‚Äù which operated until 1956. Many of the best regarded Roman law scholars in America, as well as guests from foreign countries, presented papers at the Seminar, and Riccobono himself remained in contact with it as he could for decades. He was appointed Magister of the seminar for life, and for many years, he reported on the Seminar‚Äôs activities in the Roman law journal he edited‚Äîthe Bullettino dell‚ÄôIstituto di Diritto Romano.Schiller, supra note 1 at 382 and Ortu, supra note 1. See also Timothy G. Kearley, \\"Lost in Translations: Roman Law Scholarship and Translation in Early-Twentieth Century America\\" 72-74 (2018). Honors In 1924, Riccobono was awarded a Doctor Honoris Causa of Civil Law by Oxford University, and he was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Italy in 1932.ISSPE biography, supra note 1. He also was a member of the Roman Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas and of the Catholic Religion.Brown, supra note 1.

He studied science at the University of Nagpur where he enrolled in 1939 with the Nagpur School of Art. He taught at Jabalpur's Spencer Training College for five years before completing a Diploma and then a Masters in Art during 1949-50. He later enrolled for a year at the Central Institute of Education, New Delhi in 1958.  Artistic career  Gade began his career doing watercolour landscapes before moving on to oil canvases. As a Progressive Artist, his works reflect a break from the colonial values and styles that had conditioned art education in colonial India. At least one critic has noted that \\"In [Gade's] works, color is of importance, form is only incidental.\\" Some of Gade works reflect the artist's affectation by the slums and poverty of the Bombay of the 1950s. He did however continue to produce a prodigious and diverse set of landscapes covering themes from Kerala and the Indian monsoons to the arid landscape of Rajasthan's Udaipur. Gade had an interest in science and mathematics and he read several works by Roger Fry on painting techniques and aesthetics. His works reflect his scientific inclination in their geometrically structured landscapes which are also evocative of the cubists. Some of his notable works include Kashmir, Going to the Temple, Donkeys, Civilization and Omkareshwar. Gade's paintings employ both the palette knife and the paintbrush and he has been referred to as a \\"painters' painter\\" on account his innate appreciation of the visual impact of colours. Gade was one of the six founding members of the Progressive Artists' Group and remained its part until its dissolution in 1956. His works have been exhibited at various venues both in India and abroad including at The Moderns, the inaugural exhibition at the National Gallery of Modern Art, Mumbai. Some of the venues abroad include the Stanford University exhibition (1948), Basel (1951, 1956) and the Venice Biennale (1954). In the late 1950s, he founded the Bombay Group of Artists which had K. K. Hebbar and Bal Chhabda among its members.  Awards  Gade won the Bombay Art Society's gold medal in 1956. He was also feted at the Maharashtra State Art Exhibition and at the Saigon Biennale of 1962.  Death and legacy  Gade died in 2001. Several of his works are with the National Gallery of Modern Art and Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. Several art galleries across Europe also have his works in their possession.

It was based at Cu Chi, Vietnam, from 1967 to 1969 with some elements at Phu Loi. There were also other elements TDY where needed from time to time. The battalion completed their duties but had casualties from two separate sapper attacks at Cu Chi in 1969. Most of 554th later moved to Lai Khe in 1970 where it maintained QL-13 between Lai Khe and An Loc. Some elements of the 554th were based at Firebases along QL-13 also known as Thunder Road. Along with infantry and artillery units, B Company of the 554th Eng's based its operations at Firebase Thunder III, along with elements of other 554th Companies. The Battalion completed their duties but had casualties at Lai Khe, on QL-13 and Firebase Thunder III.http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/875443.pdfhttp://www.selfcraft.net/atself/cuchi69.pdf In late 1970 the entire 554th Engineer Battalion moved out of Lai Khe and moved up QL-20 into the south highlands. Most of the 554th was then based at Camp Smith at Bao Loc, while some elements of the 554th were based at Camp Fennell beyond Bao Loc (Towards Da Lat). However Company C of the 554th was based at Camp Brown at the bottom of the mountain pass about 26 miles from Bao Loc. The battalion maintained QL-20 from Camp Brown to the Camp Fennell area. Additionally the 554th's 10-ton and 5-ton trucks were utilized on supply convoys to Long Binh. The 554th worked to maintain areas of the mountain pass road going to Bao loc. Also a major re-route of QL-20 was done just west of Camp Brown by the river. Company C's EM Platoon worked with dynamite and C4 to blast a section from the base of the mountain. This re-route alleviated re- occurring washouts of the road by the river in the monsoons. Later in 1971 Company C moved out of Camp Brown and built Camp Woodstock at the top of the mountain pass a few miles from Bao Loc. The battalion completed their duties but had some casualties in the QL-20 area in 1970‚Äì71. The unit deactivated from Vietnam in 1972.

A few examples of his appearances in literature, film, music, television and theatre are listed below. Literature Byron first appeared as a thinly disguised character in Glenarvon, by his former lover Lady Caroline Lamb, published in 1816. (It was her summary of him, \\"mad, bad, and dangerous to know\\", that is perhaps still the most quoted.) The Spanish poet Gaspar N√∫√±ez de Arce wrote √öltima lamentaci√≥n de Lord Byron (The last lamentation of Lord Byron), a long soliloquy on the miseries of the world, the existence of a superior, omnipotent being, politics, etc. Poetry Lawrence Durrell wrote a poem called Byron as a lyrical soliloquy; it was first published in 1944. Susanna Roxman's Allegra in her 1996 collection Broken Angels (Dionysia Press, Edinburgh) is a poem about Byron's daughter by Claire Clairmont. In this text, Byron is referred to as \\"Papa\\". Vampire figures The archetypal vampire character, notably Bram Stoker's Dracula, is based on Byron. The gothic ideal of a decadent, pale and aristocratic individual who enamors himself to whomever he meets, but who is perceived to have a dark and dangerous inner self, is a literary archetype derived from characterisations of Byron. The image of a vampire portrayed as an aristocrat was created by John William Polidori in The Vampyre, during the summer of 1816 which he spent in the company of Byron. The titled Count Dracula is a reprise of this character. Tom Holland, in his 1995 novel The Vampyre: Being the True Pilgrimage of George Gordon, Sixth Lord Byron, romantically describes how Lord Byron became a vampire during his first visit to Greece ‚Äî a fictional transformation that explains much of his subsequent behaviour towards family and friends, and finds support in quotes from Byron poems and the diaries of John Cam Hobhouse. It is written as though Byron is retelling part of his life to his great great-great-great-granddaughter. He describes travelling in Greece, Italy, Switzerland, meeting Percy Bysshe Shelley, Shelley's death, and many other events in life around that time. Byron as vampire character returns in the 1996 sequel Supping with Panthers. Byron is depicted as the villain/antagonist in the novel Jane Bites Back (2009) written by Michael Thomas Ford, published by Ballantine Books. A novel based on the premise that Jane Austen and Lord Byron are vampires living in the modern day literary world.

It also directly quotes some of his work.Chapman, D. (2010), The Postmodern Malady Lost manuscripts John Crowley's book Lord Byron's Novel: The Evening Land (2005) involves the rediscovery of a lost manuscript by Lord Byron, as do Frederic Prokosch's The Missolonghi Manuscript (1968), The Secret Memoir of Lord Byron by Christopher Nicole (1979) and Robert Nye's Memoirs of Lord Byron (1989). The Black Drama by Manly Wade Wellman, originally published in Weird Tales, involves the rediscovery and production of a lost play by Byron (from which Polidori's The Vampyre was plagiarised) by a man who purports to be a descendant of the poet. Alternate histories He makes an appearance in the alternative history novel The Difference Engine by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling. In a Britain powered by the massive, steam-driven, mechanical computers invented by Charles Babbage, he is leader of the Industrial Radical Party, eventually becoming Prime Minister. Byron's spirit is one of the title characters of the Ghosts of Albion books by Amber Benson and Christopher Golden. Byron appears as a character in Tim Powers's time travel/alternative history novels The Stress of Her Regard (1989) and The Anubis Gates (1983), Walter Jon Williams's fantasy novella Wall, Stone Craft (1994).

He appears in a parallel story line in the novel The Fire by Katherine Neville. Byron is also a minor character in the ninth novel of L.A. Meyer's Bloody Jack series The Mark of the Golden Dragon. In the short story \\"The Writer's Child\\" by Tad Williams‚Äîcollected in the anthology The Sandman: Book of Dreams edited by Neil Gaiman and Ed Kramer‚ÄîByron is depicted as reincarnated as a child's teddy bear. Described as \\"clubfoot\\" for having one leg shorter than the other, and called separately, \\"young lord\\" and simply \\"Byron\\", it is not till late in the story that he's revealed to be paying penalty for some kind of crime involving a woman named, \\"Ogusta\\". He appears as a character in Susanna Clarke's 2004 novel Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell.Elaine Bander, \\"Miss J. Austen, Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell\\", Persuasions On-line 29.1 (Winter 2008). Retrieved 4 November 2016. Novelist Benjamin Markovits produced a trilogy about the life of Byron. Imposture (2007) looked at the poet from the point of view of his friend and doctor, John Polidori.

Hodson is about Byron, Polidori, the Shelleys, and Claire Clairmont and the famous summer of 1816 at the Villa Diodati. As opposed to other works dealing with the same period, the play is more a biopic dealing with Byron's divorce and exile from England, than with the Shelleys' lives. He appears as a drug induced apparition to his dying daughter, Ada, in Romulus Linney's two-act play Childe Byron, premiered in 1977 by the Virginia Museum Theater (now the Leslie Cheek Theater), with Jeremiah Sullivan as Byron and Marjorie Lerstrom as his daughter Ada, Countess Lovelace. The play was commissioned and directed by Keith Fowler.

The death of Osiris was a prominent motif in the cult of Isis. The sarcophagus's appearance here may refer to the emphasis on Osiris and the afterlife found in the mysteries dedicated to Isis. The mysteries of Isis were religious initiation rites performed in the cult of the goddess Isis in the Greco-Roman world. They were modeled on other mystery rites, particularly the Eleusinian Mysteries in honor of the Greek goddess Demeter, and originated sometime between the third century BCE and the second century CE. Despite their mainly Hellenistic origins, the mysteries did allude to beliefs from ancient Egyptian religion, in which the worship of Isis arose. By undergoing the mystery rites, initiates signaled their dedication to Isis, although they were not required to worship her exclusively. The rites were seen as a symbolic death and rebirth, and they may have been thought to guarantee that the initiate's soul, with the goddess's help, would continue after death in a blissful afterlife. Many texts from the Roman Empire refer to the mysteries of Isis, but the only source to describe them is a work of fiction, the novel The Golden Ass, written in the second century CE by Apuleius. In it, the initiate undergoes elaborate ritual purification before descending into the innermost part of Isis's temple, where he has an intense religious experience, seeing the gods in person. Some aspects of the mysteries of Isis and of other mystery cults, particularly their connection with the afterlife, resemble important elements of Christianity. The question of whether the mysteries influenced Christianity is controversial and the evidence is unclear; some scholars today attribute the similarities to a shared cultural background rather than direct influence. In contrast, Apuleius's account has had direct effects in modern times. Through his description, the mysteries of Isis have influenced many works of fiction and modern fraternal organizations, as well as a widespread, though false, belief that the ancient Egyptians themselves had an elaborate system of mystery initiations. Origins Roman statue of Isis, 2nd century CE Greco- Roman mysteries were secret initiation rituals into which people entered voluntarily. They were dedicated to a particular deity or group of deities, and they used a variety of intense experiences, such as nocturnal darkness interrupted by bright light and loud music and noise, that induced a state of disorientation and an intense religious experience. Some of them involved cryptic symbolism. Initiates were not supposed to discuss some of the details of what they experienced in the mysteries, and modern understanding of these rites is limited by this secrecy. The most prestigious mysteries in the Greek world were the Eleusinian mysteries dedicated to the goddess Demeter, which were performed at Eleusis, near Athens, from at least the sixth century BCE to the end of the fourth century CE. They centered on Demeter's search for her daughter Persephone in Greek mythology. Eleusinian initiates passed into a dark hall, the Telesterion, and were subjected to terrifying sights, followed by a fiery light and a shout from the hierophant who presided over the ceremony. By this light the initiates saw objects that represented Demeter's power over fertility, such as a sheaf of wheat, and perhaps other images that referred to the myth of Persephone. In the mysteries of the god Dionysus, which were performed in many places across the Greek world, participants celebrated in a frenzy at night, in the open air. Dionysian celebrations were connected in some way with Orphism, a group of mystical beliefs about the nature of the afterlife. Isis was originally a goddess in ancient Egyptian religion, which did not include Greek-style mysteries. Some Egyptian rituals were performed exclusively by priests, out of public view, but ordinary Egyptians were never permitted to join in. Ancient Egyptian funerary texts contained knowledge about the Duat, or underworld, that was characterized as secret and was meant to help deceased souls reach a pleasant afterlife. Some Egyptologists, such as Jan Assmann, have suggested some of these texts may also have been used in rituals that consecrated priests, but other Egyptologists contest the idea that funerary texts were ever used in rituals by the living. Other rituals may have reenacted events from Egyptian mythology, such as the ceremonies in honor of Osiris, the god of the afterlife and the mythological husband of Isis, that were performed at Abydos. The Greeks interpreted these myth-based rituals as mysteries. Herodotus, a Greek historian writing in the fifth century BCE, was the first to do so. He referred to Egyptian rites reenacting the myth of the murder of Osiris as mysteries, likening them to the mysteries of Dionysus that he was familiar with. He further said that the Greek worship of Dionysus was influenced by the worship of Osiris in Egypt. Various Greek writers who came after Herodotus viewed Egypt and its priests as the source of all mystical wisdom. They claimed that many elements of Greek philosophy and culture came from Egypt, including the mystery cults. The classicist Walter Burkert and the Egyptologist Francesco Tiradritti both say there is a grain of truth in these claims, as the oldest Greek mystery cults developed in the seventh and sixth centuries BCE, at the same time that Greece was developing closer contacts with Egyptian culture. The imagery of the afterlife found in the mystery cults may thus have been influenced by that in Egyptian afterlife beliefs. Isis was one of many non-Greek deities whose cults became part of Greek and Roman religion during the Hellenistic period (323‚Äì30 BCE), when Greek people and culture spread to lands across the Mediterranean and most of those same lands were conquered by the Roman Republic. Under the influence of Greco-Roman tradition, some of these cults, including that of Isis, developed their own mystery rites. The mysteries of Isis could have emerged as far back as the early third century BCE, after the Greek Ptolemaic dynasty had taken control of Egypt. The Ptolemies promoted the cult of the god Serapis, who incorporated traits of Osiris and of Greek deities like Dionysus and the underworld god Pluto. Isis's cult was conjoined with that of Serapis. She too was reinterpreted to resemble Greek goddesses, particularly Demeter, while retaining many of her Egyptian characteristics. The mysteries of Isis, modeled on those in Demeter's honor at Eleusis, could have been developed at the same time, as part of this mingling of Greek and Egyptian religion. Another possibility is that the mysteries developed after Isis's Hellenized cult reached Greece itself, later in the third century BCE. Much of the early evidence of Isis worship in Greece comes from aretalogies, poems in praise of the goddess. The wording of aretalogies from Maroneia and Andros, both from the first century BCE, closely links Isis with mystery rites. Petra Pakkanen says that these aretalogies prove the mysteries of Isis existed by that time, but Jan Bremmer argues that they only connect Isis with the Eleusinian Mysteries, not with distinctive rites of her own. Stronger evidence for mysteries of Isis is found in the first century CE, and they certainly existed in the second. Temples to Isis in Greece may have developed their mysteries in response to the widespread belief that the Greek mystery cults had originated with Isis and Osiris in Egypt. They could have adapted elements of Eleusinian rites, and perhaps Dionysian mysteries as well, to reflect Egyptian mythology. The end product would have seemed to the Greeks like an authentic Egyptian precursor to Greek mysteries. Many Greco-Roman sources claim that Isis herself devised these rites. Even once the mysteries were established, they were not performed everywhere Isis's cult was present. The only known sites for her mystery cult were in Italy, Greece, and Anatolia, although she was worshipped in nearly every province of the Roman Empire. In Egypt itself, only a few texts and images from the Roman period refer to the mysteries of Isis, and it is not certain that they were ever performed there. Apuleius's description of the mysteries Priestess of Isis holding a situla (a bronze jug), 2nd century CE Context and reliability Several texts from Roman times refer to people who were initiated in the Isis cult. However, the only direct description of the mysteries of Isis comes from The Golden Ass, also known as Metamorphoses, a comic novel from the late second century CE by the Roman author Apuleius. The novel's protagonist is Lucius, a man who has been magically transformed into a donkey. In the eleventh and last book of the novel, Lucius, after falling asleep on the beach at Cenchreae in Greece, wakes to see the full moon. He prays to the moon, using the names of several moon goddesses known in the Greco-Roman world, asking her to restore him to human form. Isis appears in a vision before Lucius and declares herself the greatest of all goddesses. She tells him that a festival in her honor, the Navigium Isidis, is taking place nearby, and that the festival procession carries with it garlands of roses that will restore his human form if he eats them. After Lucius becomes human again, the high priest at the festival declares that he has been saved from his misfortunes by the goddess, and that he will now be free of the inquisitiveness and self-indulgence that drew him into many of the misadventures he has experienced. Lucius joins the local temple of Isis, becomes her devoted follower, and eventually undergoes initiation. Lucius's apparently solemn devotion to the Isis cult in this chapter contrasts strongly with the comic misadventures that make up the rest of the novel. Scholars debate whether the account is intended to seriously represent Lucius's devotion to the goddess, or whether it is ironic, perhaps a satire of the Isis cult. Those who believe it is satirical point to the way Lucius is pushed to undergo several initiations, each requiring a fee, despite having little money. Although many of the scholars who have tried to analyze the mysteries based on the book have assumed it is serious, the book may be broadly accurate even if it is satirical. Apuleius's description of the Isis cult and its mysteries generally fits with much of the outside evidence about them. S. J. Harrison says it shows \\"detailed knowledge of Egyptian cult, whether or not Apuleius himself was in fact an initiate of Isiac religion\\". In another of his works, the Apologia, Apuleius claims to have undergone several initiations, though he does not mention the mysteries of Isis specifically. In writing The Golden Ass, he may have drawn on personal experience of the Isiac initiation or of other initiations that he underwent. Even so, the detailed description given in The Golden Ass may be idealized rather than strictly accurate, and the Isis cults may have included many varieties of mystery rite. The novel actually mentions three distinct initiation rites in two cities, although only the first is described in any detail. Rites According to The Golden Ass, the initiation \\"was performed in the manner of voluntary death and salvation obtained by favor\\". Only Isis herself could determine who should be initiated and when; thus, Lucius only begins preparing for the mysteries after Isis appears to him in a dream. The implication that Isis was thought to command her followers directly is supported by Pausanias, a Greek writer in the same era as Apuleius, who said no one was allowed to participate in Isis's festivals in her shrine at Tithorea without her inviting them in a dream, and by inscriptions in which priests of Isis write that she called them to become her servants. In Apuleius's description, the goddess also determines how much the initiate must pay to the temple in order to undergo the rites. The priests in Lucius's initiation read the procedure for the rite from a ritual book kept in the temple that is covered in \\"unknown characters\\", some of which are \\"shapes of all sorts of animals\\" while others are ornate and abstract. The use of a book for ritual purposes was much more common in Egyptian religion than in Greek or Roman tradition, and the characters in this book are often thought to be hieroglyphs or hieratic, which in the eyes of Greek and Roman worshippers would emphasize the Egyptian background of the rite and add to its solemnity. However, David Frankfurter suggests that they are akin to the deliberately unintelligible magical symbols that were commonly used in Greco- Roman magic. Before the initiation proper, Lucius must undergo a series of ritual purifications. The priest bathes him, asks the gods for forgiveness on his behalf, and sprinkles him with water. This confession of and repentance for past sins fits with an emphasis on chastity and other forms of self-denial found in many other sources about the Isis cult. Lucius next has to wait ten days, while abstaining from meat and wine, before the initiation begins. Purifying baths were common in many rituals across the Greco-Roman world. The plea for forgiveness, however, may derive from the oaths that Egyptian priests were required to take, in which they declared themselves to be free of wrongdoing. The sprinkling with water and the refraining from certain foods probably come from the purification rituals that those priests had to undergo before entering a temple. On the evening of the final day, Lucius receives a variety of unspecified gifts from fellow devotees of Isis before donning a clean linen robe and entering the deepest part of the temple. The description of what happens next is deliberately cryptic. Lucius reminds the reader that the uninitiated are not allowed to know the details of the mystery rites, before describing his experience in vague terms. > I came to the boundary of death and, having trodden on the threshold of > Proserpina, I travelled through all the elements and returned. In the middle > of the night I saw the sun flashing with bright light, I came face to face > with the gods below and the gods above and paid reverence to them from close > at hand. In a series of paradoxes, then, Lucius travels to the underworld and to the heavens, sees the sun amid darkness, and approaches the gods. Many people have speculated about how the ritual simulated these impossible experiences. The first sentence indicates that the initiate is supposed to be passing through the Greek underworld, but the surviving remains of Roman temples to Isis have no subterranean corridors that might have simulated the underworld. The bright \\"sun\\" Lucius mentions may have been a fire in the darkness, similar to the one at the climax of the Eleusinian Mysteries. The gods he saw face to face may have been statues or frescoes of deities. Some scholars believe that the initiation also entailed some kind of reenactment of or reference to the death of Osiris, but if it did, Apuleius's text does not mention it. Lucius emerges from this experience in the morning, and the priests dress him in an elaborately embroidered cloak. He then stands on a dais carrying a torch and wearing a crown of palm leaves‚Äî\\"adorned like the sun and set up in the manner of a divine statue\\", as Apuleius describes it. The priests draw back curtains to reveal Lucius to a crowd of his fellow devotees. During the next three days, Lucius enjoys a series of banquets and sacred meals with his fellow worshippers, completing the initiation process. After this initiation, Lucius moves to Rome and joins its main temple to the goddess, the Iseum Campense. Urged by more visions sent by the gods, he undergoes two more initiations, incurring more expenses‚Äîsuch as having to buy a replacement for the cloak he left behind at Cenchreae‚Äîeach time. These initiations are not described in as much detail as the first. The second is dedicated to Osiris and is said to be different from the one dedicated to Isis. Apuleius calls it \\"the nocturnal mysteries of the foremost god\\" but gives no other details. The third initiation may be dedicated to both Isis and Osiris. Before this initiation, Lucius has a vision where Osiris himself speaks to him, suggesting that he is the dominant figure in the rite. At the novel's end Lucius has been admitted to a high position in the cult by Osiris himself, and he is confident that the god will ensure his future success in his work as a lawyer. Significance Religious symbolism and contact with the gods Most mystery rites were connected with myths about the deities they focused on‚Äîthe Osiris myth, in the case of Isis‚Äîand they claimed to convey to initiates details about the myths that were not generally known. In addition, various Greco-Roman writers produced theological and philosophical interpretations of the mysteries. Spurred by the fragmentary evidence, modern scholars have often tried to discern what the mysteries may have meant to their initiates. But Hugh Bowden argues that there may have been no single, authoritative interpretation of mystery rites and that \\"the desire to identify a lost secret‚Äîsomething that, once it is correctly identified, will explain what a mystery cult was all about‚Äîis bound to fail.\\" He regards the effort to meet the gods directly, exemplified by the climax of Lucius's initiation in The Golden Ass, as the most important feature of the rites. The notion of meeting the gods face to face contrasted with classical Greek and Roman beliefs, in which seeing the gods, though it might be an awe-inspiring experience, could be dangerous and even deadly. In Greek mythology, for example, the sight of Zeus's true form incinerated the mortal woman Semele. Yet Lucius's meeting with the gods fits with a trend, found in various religious groups in Roman times, toward a closer connection between the worshipper and the gods. Ancient Egyptian beliefs are one possible source for understanding the symbolism in the mysteries of Isis. J. Gwyn Griffiths, an Egyptologist and classical scholar, extensively studied Book 11 of The Golden Ass and its possible Egyptian background. He pointed out similarities between the first initiation in The Golden Ass and Egyptian afterlife beliefs, saying that the initiate took on the role of Osiris by undergoing symbolic death. In his view, the imagery of the initiation refers to the Egyptian underworld, the Duat. Griffiths argued that the sun in the middle of the night, in Lucius's account of the initiation, might have been influenced by the contrasts of light and dark in other mystery rites, but it derived mainly from the depictions of the underworld in ancient Egyptian funerary texts. According to these texts, the sun god Ra passes through the underworld each night and unites with Osiris to emerge renewed, just as deceased souls do. However, the authors of a more recent commentary on Book 11 caution that the solar and underworld imagery could be based solely on Greek and Roman precedents, and they doubt Griffiths's assertion that Lucius undergoes a mystical union with Osiris. The \\"elements\\" that Lucius passes through in the first initiation may refer to the classical elements of earth, air, water, and fire that were believed to make up the world, or to regions of the cosmos. In either case, it indicates that Lucius's vision transports him beyond the human world. Panayotis Pachis suggests the word refers specifically to the planets in Hellenistic astrology. Astrological themes appeared in many other cults in the Roman Empire, including another mystery cult, dedicated to Mithras. In the Isis cult, astrological symbolism may have alluded to the belief that Isis governed the movements of the stars and thus the passage of time and the order of the cosmos, beliefs that Lucius refers to when praying to the goddess. However, in the course of the book, as Valentino Gasparini puts it, \\"Osiris explicitly snatches out of Isis's hands the role of Supreme Being\\" and replaces her as the focus of Lucius's devotion. Osiris's prominence in The Golden Ass is in keeping with other evidence about the Isis cult in Rome, which suggests that it adopted more themes and imagery from Egyptian funerary religion and gave increasing prominence to Osiris in the late 1st and early 2nd centuries CE. Gasparini argues that the shift in focus in the book reflects a belief that Osiris was the supreme being and Isis was an intermediary between him and humanity. This interpretation is found in the essay On Isis and Osiris by the first-century CE Greek author Plutarch, which analyzes the Osiris myth based on Plutarch's own Middle Platonist philosophy, and Gasparini suggests that Apuleius shared it. However, S. J. Harrison suggests that the sudden switch of focus from Isis to Osiris is simply a satire of grandiose claims of religious devotion. Commitment to the cult Because not all local cults of Isis held mystery rites, not all her devotees would have undergone initiation. Nevertheless, both Apuleius's story and Plutarch's On Isis and Osiris suggest that initiation was considered part of the larger process of joining the cult and dedicating oneself to the goddess. The Isis cult, like most in the Greco- Roman world, was not exclusive; worshippers of Isis could continue to revere other gods as well. Devotees of Isis were among the very few religious groups in the Greco-Roman world to have a distinctive name for themselves, loosely equivalent to \\"Jew\\" or \\"Christian\\", that might indicate they defined themselves by their exclusive devotion to the goddess. However, the word‚ÄîIsiacus or \\"Isiac\\"‚Äîwas rarely used. Many priests of Isis officiated in other cults as well. Several people in late Roman times, like Vettius Agorius Praetextatus, joined multiple priesthoods and underwent several initiations dedicated to different gods. Mystery initiations thus did not require devotees to abandon whatever religious identity they originally had, and they would not qualify as religious conversions under a narrow definition of the term. However, some of these initiations did involve smaller changes in religious identity, such as joining a new community of worshippers or strengthening devotees' commitment to a cult they were already part of, that would qualify as conversions in a broader sense. Many ancient sources, both written by Isiacs and by outside observers, suggest that many of Isis's devotees considered her the focus of their lives and that the cult emphasized moral purity, self-denial, and public declarations of devotion to the goddess. Joining Isis's cult was therefore a sharper change in identity than in many other mystery cults. Isiac initiation, by giving the devotee a dramatic, mystical experience of the goddess, added emotional intensity to the process. The book does not say how initiation may have affected a devotee's rank within the cult. After going through his third initiation, Lucius becomes a pastophoros, a member of a particular class of priests. If the third initiation was a requirement for becoming a pastophoros, it is possible that members moved up in the cult hierarchy by going through the series of initiations. Nevertheless, Apuleius refers to initiates and to priests as if they are separate groups within the cult. Initiation may have been a prerequisite for a devotee to become a priest but not have automatically made him or her into one. Connection with the afterlife Many pieces of evidence suggest that the mysteries of Isis were connected in some way to salvation and the guarantee of an afterlife. The Greek conception of the afterlife included the paradisiacal Elysian Fields, and philosophers developed various ideas about the immortality of the soul, but Greeks and Romans expressed uncertainty about what would happen to them after death. In both Greek and Roman traditional religion, no god was thought to guarantee a pleasant afterlife to his or her worshippers. The gods of some mystery cults may have been exceptions, but evidence about those cults' afterlife beliefs is vague. Apuleius's account, if it is accurate, provides stronger evidence for Isiac afterlife beliefs than is available for the other cults. The book says Isis's power over fate, which her Greek and Roman devotees frequently mentioned, gives her control over life and death. According to the priest who initiates Lucius, devotees of Isis \\"who had finished their life's span and were already standing on the threshold of light‚Äôs end, if only they could safely be trusted with the great unspoken mysteries of the cult, were frequently drawn forth by the goddess' power and in a manner reborn through her providence and set once more on the course of renewed life.\\" In another passage, Isis herself says that when Lucius dies he will be able to see her shining in the darkness of the underworld and worship her there. Some scholars are skeptical the afterlife was a major focus of the cult. Ramsay MacMullen says that when characters in The Golden Ass call Lucius \\"reborn\\", they refer to his new life as a devotee and never call him renatus in aeternam, or \\"eternally reborn\\", which would refer to the afterlife. Mary Beard, John North, and Simon Price say The Golden Ass shows that \\"the cult of Isis had implications for life and death, but even so more emphasis is placed on extending the span of life than on the after-life‚Äîwhich is pictured in fairly undifferentiated terms.\\" Some inscriptions provide evidence of Isiac afterlife beliefs outside Apuleius's work. They show that some of Isis's followers thought she would guide them to a better afterlife, but they also suggest the Isis cult had no firm picture of the afterlife and that Isiacs drew upon both Greek and Egyptian precedents to envision it. Some inscriptions say that the devotees would benefit from Osiris's enlivening water, while others refer to the Fortunate Isles of Greek tradition. None of them make specific reference to mystery rites, and the mysteries may not have been considered necessary for receiving Isis's blessing. The ancient Egyptians believed that Osiris lived on in the Duat after death, thanks in part to Isis's help, and that after their deaths they could be revived like him with the assistance of other deities, including Isis. These beliefs may well have carried over into the Greco-Roman Isis cult. The symbolism found in Lucius's first initiation, with its references to death and to the sun in the Egyptian underworld, suggests that it involved Osirian afterlife beliefs, even though Osiris is not mentioned in the description of the rite. As Robert Turcan puts it, when Lucius is revealed to the crowd after his initiation he is \\"honoured almost like a new Osiris, saved and regenerated through the ineffable powers of Isis. The palms radiating from his head were the signs of the Sun triumphing over death.\\" Influence on other traditions Possible influence on Christianity The mysteries of Isis, like those of other gods, continued to be performed into the late fourth century CE. Toward the end of the century, however, Christian emperors increasingly restricted the practice of non-Christian religions, which they condemned as \\"pagan\\". Mystery cults thus died out near the start of the fifth century. They existed alongside Christianity for centuries before their extinction, and some elements of their initiations resembled Christian beliefs and practices. As a result, the possibility has often been raised that Christianity was directly influenced by the mystery cults. Evidence about interactions between Christianity and the mystery cults is poor, making the question difficult to resolve. Most religious traditions in the Greco-Roman world centered on a particular city or ethnic group and did not require personal devotion, only public ritual. In contrast, the cult of Isis, like Christianity and some other mystery cults, was made up of people who joined voluntarily, out of their personal commitment to a deity that many of them regarded as superior to all others. Christianity has its own initiation ritual, baptism, and beginning in the fourth century, Christians began to refer to their sacraments, such as baptism, with the word mysterion, the Greek term that was also used for a mystery rite. In this case, the word meant that Christians did not discuss their most important rites with non-Christians who might misunderstand or disrespect them. Their rites thus acquired some of the aura of secrecy that surrounded the mystery cults. Furthermore, if Isiac initiates were thought to benefit in the afterlife from Osiris's death and resurrection, this belief would parallel the Christian belief that the death and resurrection of Jesus make salvation available to those who become Christians. Even in ancient times these similarities were controversial. Non- Christians in the Roman Empire in the early centuries CE thought Christianity and the mystery cults resembled each other. Reacting to these claims by outsiders, early Christian apologists denied that these cults had influenced their religion. The 17th-century Protestant scholar Isaac Casaubon brought up the issue again by accusing the Catholic Church of deriving its sacraments from the rituals of the mystery cults. Charles-Fran√ßois Dupuis, in the late 18th century, went further by claiming that all Christianity originated in the mystery cults. Intensified by religious disputes between Protestants, Catholics, and non-Christians, the controversy has continued to the present day. Some scholars have specifically compared baptism with the Isiac initiation described by Apuleius. Before the early fourth century CE, baptism was the culmination of a long process, in which the convert to Christianity fasted for the forty days of Lent before being immersed at Easter in a cistern or natural body of water. Thus, like the mysteries of Isis, early Christian baptism involved a days-long fast and a washing ritual. Both fasting and washing were common types of ritual purification found in the religions of the Mediterranean, and Christian baptism was specifically derived from the baptism of Jesus and Jewish immersion rituals. Therefore, according to Hugh Bowden, these similarities come from the shared religious background of Christianity and the Isis cult, not from the influence of one tradition upon the other. Similarly, the sacred meals shared by the initiates of many mystery cults have been compared with the Christian rite of communion. For instance, the classicist R. E. Witt called the banquet that concluded the Isiac initiation \\"the pagan Eucharist of Isis and Sarapis\\". However, feasts in which worshippers ate the food that had been sacrificed to a deity were a nearly universal practice in Mediterranean religions and do not prove a direct link between Christianity and the mystery cults. The most distinctive trait of Christian communion‚Äîthe belief that the god himself was the victim of the sacrifice‚Äîwas not present in the mystery cults. Bowden doubts that afterlife beliefs were a very important aspect of mystery cults and therefore thinks their resemblance to Christianity was small. Jaime Alvar, in contrast, argues that the mysteries of Isis, along with those of Mithras and Cybele, did involve beliefs about salvation and the afterlife that resembled those in Christianity. But, he says, they did not become similar by borrowing directly from each other, only by adapting in similar ways to the Greco-Roman religious environment. He says: \\"Each cult found the materials it required in the common trough of current ideas. Each took what it needed and adapted these elements according to its overall drift and design.\\" Influence in modern times Isis as a personification of nature, depicted as the climactic moment of an Isiac initiation, in an 1803 engraving by Henry Fuseli Motifs from Apuleius's description of the Isiac initiation have been repeated and reworked in fiction and in esoteric belief systems in modern times, and they thus form an important part of the Western perception of ancient Egyptian religion. People reusing these motifs often assume that mystery rites were practiced in Egypt long before Hellenistic times. An influential example is the 1731 novel Life of Sethos by Jean Terrasson. Terrasson claimed he had translated this book from an ancient Greek work of fiction that was based on real events. The book was actually his own invention, inspired by ancient Greek sources that assumed Greek philosophers had derived their wisdom from Egypt. In the novel, Egypt's priests run an elaborate education system like a European university. To join their ranks, the protagonist, Sethos, undergoes an initiation presided over by Isis, taking place in hidden chambers beneath the Great Pyramid of Giza. Based on Lucius's statement in The Golden Ass that he was \\"borne through all the elements\\" during his initiation, Terrasson describes the initiation as an elaborate series of ordeals, each based on one of the classical elements: running over hot metal bars for fire, swimming a canal for water, and swinging through the air over a pit. The Divine Legation of Moses, a treatise by the Anglican theologian William Warburton published from 1738 to 1741, included an analysis of ancient mystery rites that drew upon Sethos for much of its evidence. Assuming that all mystery rites derived from Egypt, Warburton argued that the public face of Egyptian religion was polytheistic, but the Egyptian mysteries were designed to reveal a deeper, monotheistic truth to elite initiates. One of them, Moses, learned this truth during his Egyptian upbringing and developed Judaism to reveal it to the entire Israelite nation. Freemasons, members of a European fraternal organization that attained its modern form in the early eighteenth century, developed many pseudohistorical origin myths that traced Freemasonry back to ancient times. Egypt was among the civilizations that Masons claimed had influenced their traditions. After Sethos was published, several Masonic lodges developed rites based on those in the novel. Late in the century, Masonic writers, still assuming that Sethos was an ancient story, used the obvious resemblance between their rites and the initiation of Sethos as evidence of Freemasonry's supposedly ancient origin. Many works of fiction from the 1790s to the 1820s reused and modified the signature traits of Terrasson's Egyptian initiation: trials by three or four elements, often taking place under the pyramids. The best-known of these works is the 1791 opera The Magic Flute by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Emmanuel Schikaneder, in which the main character, Tamino, undergoes a series of trials overseen by priests who invoke Isis and Osiris. Karl Leonhard Reinhold, a philosopher and Freemason writing in the 1780s, drew upon and modified Warburton's claims in an effort to reconcile Freemasonry's traditional origin story, which traces Freemasonry back to ancient Israel, with its enthusiasm for Egyptian imagery. He claimed that the sentence \\"I am that I am\\", spoken by the Jewish God in the Book of Exodus, had a pantheistic meaning. He compared it with an Egyptian inscription on a veiled statue of Isis recorded by the Roman-era authors Plutarch and Proclus, which said \\"I am all that is, was, and shall be,\\" and argued that Isis was a pantheistic personification of Nature. According to Reinhold, it was this pantheistic belief system that Moses imparted to the Israelites, so that Isis and the Jewish and Christian conception of God shared a common origin. In contrast, some people in the wake of the dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution used the imagery of a pantheistic Isis to represent their opposition to the clergy and to Christianity in general. For instance, an esoteric fraternal organization in Napoleonic France, the Sophisian Order, regarded Isis as their tutelary deity. To them, she symbolized both modern scientific knowledge‚Äîwhich hoped to uncover Nature's secrets‚Äîand the mystical wisdom of the ancient mystery rites. The vague set of esoteric beliefs that surrounded the goddess offered an alternative to traditional Christianity. It was during this anticlerical era that Dupuis claimed that Christianity was a distorted offshoot of ancient mystery cults. Various esoteric organizations that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as the Theosophical Society and the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis, repeated the beliefs that had originated with Sethos: that Egyptians underwent initiation within the pyramids and that Greek philosophers were initiates who learned Egypt's secret wisdom. Esoteric writers influenced by Theosophy, such as Reuben Swinburne Clymer in his book The Mystery of Osiris (1909) and Manly Palmer Hall in Freemasonry of the Ancient Egyptians (1937), also wrote of an age-old Egyptian mystery tradition. An elaborate example of these beliefs is the 1954 book Stolen Legacy by George G. M. James, which claims that Greek philosophy was built on knowledge stolen from the Egyptian school of initiates. James imagined this mystery school as a grandiose organization with branches on many continents, so that the purported system of Egyptian mysteries shaped cultures all over the world.

Its symbolism is based on Chapter 19 of the Book of the Dead, in which the wearer is said to be \\"justified\\" by a triumph over death just as the god Osiris eventually rose above his enemies.

It is notable for its juniper woodland, which is amongst the largest in Perthshire. Description The reserve covers an area of 55 hectares, through which the Balnagurad Burn runs. The gully is steep- sided, and once hosted a footpath, though landslips have made the old route dangerous and impassable. There are several waterfalls. To the east of the gully lies a birch wood, and to the west are numerous areas of juniper woodland. Flora The glen was formerly more extensively wooded, and there have been recent tree plantings adjoining the birch wood in order to diversify the variety of plant and animal life. The juniper woodland, which lies primarily in the west of the reserve, needs to be maintained by the frequent removal of fast-growing bracken, which would otherwise swamp the slow-growing juniper. Further west, beyond the juniper, is an area of grassland. Fauna There are numerous species which may be observed in the reserve, namely red deer, mountain hare, kestrels and pine martens. Accessibility There is a small car park at the foot of the reserve, just outside the village. There is a way marked trail, but it is steep and rough, and can be difficult to pass in wet weather. It is dangerous to try to access the gully, as the land there is unstable and very prone to landslides.

Union of Concerned Scientists. Retrieved 10 April 2013. A key benefit of the uber-local food movement is the low cost of transportation of goods from the fields to the marketplace. This reduction of transportation costs makes it possible for a well-organized urban farmer to earn a living wage. The uber-local movement is also driven by new municipal laws that make it easier for small producers to market their goods. For example, the Seattle City Council passed an ordinance in 2010 that allows urban farmers to sell food that is grown in residential lots.

It originally aired on FX in the United States on April 10, 2013. Plot KGB agent Elizabeth Jennings (Keri Russell) finally sees her estranged husband Philip's (Matthew Rhys) motel living arrangements. At FBI headquarters, the agents are mourning the death of their colleague Chris Amador (Maximiliano Hern√°ndez). Martha (Alison Wright) tearfully confides in agent Stan Beeman (Noah Emmerich) that she had only just spoken to Amador. Stan, depressed over Amador's death, visits his neighbor Philip late at night in his motel room. He tells Philip about Amador and that he'll find whoever is responsible. Stan declines Philip's offer to drive him home and leaves, sincerely thanking Philip. KGB employee Nina (Annet Mahendru) confronts her handler Stan about the murder of young KGB official Vlad, whom she considered a friend. Stan (who shot Vlad) denies any knowledge of Vlad's death, but Nina is unconvinced. Philip tells Elizabeth that he learned from Martha that Amador's ring was missing from his body when he was found, and resolves to talk to Gregory (Derek Luke), whose team had handled Amador. Stan finds out that a man who owns a wrecking yard found Amador's ring in a car and tried to pawn it. Stan realizes that Amador left the ring in the trunk of the car in which he was kidnapped so that the FBI would find it. The wrecking yard owner refuses to say who dropped off the car, but relents when Stan attacks him, saying that the men who dropped it off were black drug dealers who sometimes abandon cars with him. Elizabeth meets Gregory at a bar, where she tells him about Amador's ring and her separation from Philip. Later, the wrecking yard owner identifies one of the men who dropped off the car in a mug book. Stan realizes that the man is Curtis, who was tailing him and Amador in Philadelphia. Soon afterwards, agents raid Curtis's building and arrest him. Claudia (Margo Martindale) briefs Elizabeth on the situation. Stan threatens Curtis with charges of treason when he refuses to talk and appeals to their common ground as Americans. The FBI reviews information on Gregory, revealing that the KGB recruited civil rights activists such as him. Claudia tells Gregory he must go with her and that she has planted evidence in his apartment linking him to Amador's murder in order to ensure the FBI won't keep looking long enough to find Philip and Elizabeth. The FBI raids the place, finding Amador's blood on a pair of Gregory's shoes. Claudia tells Philip that they want to send Gregory to Moscow, but Gregory refuses, and Claudia and Philip discuss killing Gregory. Later, Gregory tells Elizabeth to leave Philip and to find someone who loves her for her strength rather than trying to soften her. Gregory and Elizabeth kiss and have sex for the last time. The next day, Philip prepares to kill Gregory. Gregory tells Elizabeth that he is not moving to Moscow and that he will instead commit suicide by cop. Elizabeth pulls a gun and prepares for the hard task of shooting him; Philip enters, offering to spare her the pain, but she convinces him that Gregory has always kept his word. Gregory makes his way outside, and is soon noticed by a police officer who calls it in. As he is surrounded, he incites a gunfight and is then killed fighting the police. Elizabeth watches the report on the news. Production The episode was written by Bradford Winters and directed by Adam Arkin.

Situated on the southern shore of Lake Minnewaska, three structures of the private, commercial resort were placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on February 11, 1982. The complex is notable because it stands as one of the best-preserved early resorts in west central Minnesota, and as a center of seasonal resort activity on the lake since the second decade of the twentieth century. History By the end of the 19th century, the southwest section of shoreline along Lake Minnewaska had become popular residents of North Dakota. They built summer homes and created the \\"Camp Dakota\\" subdivision, platted in 1905. Henry P. Peters, a resident of Enderlin, North Dakota and a conductor on the Soo Line railroad, which passed through nearby Glenwood, purchased a cottage in 1908. Peters quit the railroad in 1912 and moved to Estevan, Saskatchewan, Canada, where he quickly found success in the construction industry. Saving a few thousand dollars, he decided to move permanently to Glenwood in 1914.Pierce and William G. Peters, 50 Golden Years at Sunset Beach, privately published, 1965; copy accessed from \\"Sunset Beach Hotel\\" file, State Historic Preservation Office in the Minnesota History Center. He and his wife organized a company to build the \\"Glenwood Summer Hotel\\". That building, now the Main Lodge, opened on June 1, 1915. By 1918, Peters was able to buy out the other stockholders and secure a controlling interest in the resort; the name was soon changed to Sunset Beach Hotel. The name caught on and soon \\"Sunset Beach\\" became the name for the area around the hotel. Despite having little formal education himself, Peters managed to send his children to Shattuck Military Academy and the University of Wisconsin. The Peters family has continuously run the resort since then, adding additional buildings and facilities over time. During the Great Depression, Peters and his wife managed to keep the hotel afloat, even when a severe drought caused the lake to lower far enough that a road had to be built from the hotel to the lake. Pushing the lake's fishing potential, particularly for walleye, Peters made light of the fact that \\"the walleyes didn't know there was a depression going on.\\" The resort's Main Lodge, Annex, and Court Building were deemed to be outstanding examples of the simple functional style of early lake resorts, contrasting with the more ostentatious log resort buildings built for the northern Minnesota resorts of the 1920s. The resort is of historic interest for its link with the early development of one of Pope County's significant aspects, its seasonal population. Additional small cottages, as well as other structures and facilities, have been added to the resort over the years; however these structures have been significantly altered since their construction and were not included in the nomination to the NRHP. In 1962 the owners decided to add a golf course, now named the Pezhekee National Golf Course, which opened with four holes in 1965 and expanded into a nine-hole course by 1967. Structures The Main Lodge, built in 1915 The three pivotal resort structures listed on the NRHP are arranged around a central open area fronting the lake. These buildings, the Main Lodge, the Annex, and the Court Building, are designed in a simple American Craftsman style and have retained excellent design integrity. The Main Lodge (1915) is a two-story frame gable roofed building. Simple Midwest bungalow detailing includes craftsman-style brackets in the gables and exposed rafter ends. Fenestration includes both single and paired rectangular double-hung windows. The building is sheathed in clapboard. The full front porch, originally screened, has been enclosed and a porte-coch√®re added over the front entrance; this was deemed sympathetic to the original design in the NRHP nomination. Other changes have included the addition of a one-story sun room to the north, shed dormers on the roof, and additions to the rear of the buildings. The interior of the Main Lodge includes a lobby, sun room, dining room, kitchen, and office on the main floor and guest rooms on the second floor. There have been cosmetic alterations to the interior, but the main floor retained its original basic room arrangement and some original features, including a stone fireplace in the lobby. The dining room is decorated with panels illustrating local Native American lore painted by Gustav Krollman (1888‚Äì1962). Born in Vienna, Krollman studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna and served as an officer in the Austrian Army during World War I before traveling the world and settling in Minneapolis, Minnesota by 1923. His work rose to fame in the United States when he started creating paintings to promote tourist destinations for the Northern Pacific Railway, and he later became an instructor at what is now the Minneapolis College of Art and Design.Linda Andrean, Gustav Wilhelm Krollman (1888 - 1962), University of Minnesota, May 2011, accessed April 10, 2013. The Court Building, built in 1930 The Annex Building (1927) is at the southwest end of the central area, and is constructed in a style similar to the main lodge. The rectangular building has two stories with a projecting two-story screen porch at the front, and features a hip roof with gambrel dormers, clapboard siding, brackets, and exposed rafter ends. Each of the two stories includes four guest rooms opening on a central hallway. The Court Building (1930) is located at the northwest end of the central area. This building is composed of three rectangular units arranged around a central court. Like the other buildings, it features clapboard siding, exposed rafter ends, and craftsman-style brackets. Each section is capped with a hip roof with gabled vents at the peaks, and features irregularly spaced rectangular windows. The court area includes a second story balcony on three sides; the original wooden balustrade has been replaced with a metal rail. The interior of each section includes two apartments on each floor.

The UFO hovered for some time and then vanished from the sight. Saad Khan : March 15, 1951; New Delhi, India 10:20 a.m. local time. George F. Floate, a chief aerial engineer, along with his two assistants, observed a swirly white cloud that appeared in the sky from north to south about 700 feet in length approximately 4,000 feet high near the Delhi Flying Club hanger. The cloud increased in length and at the end of it a bullet shaped object appeared approximately 100 feet long and as big around as a C-47 fuselage. The witnesses shouted out and 17 to 20 people rushed out of the hanger and saw the object. The object headed south for about 3 minutes where it made an apparent loop coming back over the field. At the top of the loop it was out of sight but came into sight again in its dive. The object, after recovering straight and level flight proceeded to the SW until out of sight. The speed of the object was estimated to be three times greater than cruising speed of a British Vampire jet. The total time the object was observed was approximately seven minutes. Project Blue Book evaluated this sighting as an UNIDENTIFIED.  2007  * On October 29, a fast moving object was spotted at 30¬∞ in the eastern horizon at Eastern Kolkata between 3:30 and 6:30 am and was filmed using a handycam. Its shape shifted from a sphere to a triangle and then to a straight line. The object emitted a bright light forming a halo and radiated a range of colours. It was spotted by many people and hundreds gathered along the E.M. Bypass to catch a glimpse of the UFO, triggering a frenzy. The video footage was released on a TV News channel and later shown to Dr. D P Duari, the director of MP Birla Planetarium, Kolkata, who found it to be \\"extremely interesting and strange\\".

Hempel is a global company providing products in the protective, marine, decorative, container and yacht industries. Hempel factories, R&D; centres and stock points are established in every region. Hempel‚Äôs coatings protect surfaces, structures and equipment. Hempel was founded in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1915. It is owned by the Hempel Foundation, which supports the Hempel Group and cultural, social, humanitarian and scientific purposes as well. History Hempel was founded by J√∏rgen Christian Hempel (b. 1894, d. 30 January 1986) in July 1915, when he established Hempel‚Äôs Marine Paints Ltd. (J.C. Hempel‚Äôs Skibsfarve‚ÄìFabrik A/S), a marine paint wholesaler. At just twenty one years of age, he was Denmark‚Äôs youngest licensed wholesaler at the time. The following year, he set up his own paint mixing factory. In 1917, Hempel collaborated with the Technical University of Denmark, to develop Hempel‚Äôs first antifouling coating for ships‚Äô hulls. During the 1950s and 1960s, Hempel expanded around the globe. It established its first factory in the United States in 1951, and opened an office in Hong Kong in 1963. In the 1960s, the company began to produce decorative coatings for the Middle East, and it opened its first factory in the region, in Kuwait, in 1966. In the 1970s, Hempel established a Protective coatings division to develop and produce coatings for the industrial market, such as power generation and infrastructure. Hempel was one of the first coatings companies to focus on renewable energies and it supplied coatings to the first commercial wind farm in 1980. J.C. Hempel died in 1986, 91 years of age, having led the company for seventy one years. By 2000, Hempel had become a widespread group, with local management in thirty eight countries.

The second tropical cyclone and hurricane of the annual hurricane season, it formed from a frontal low off the west coast of Florida on August 3\\\\. Initially a weak disturbance, it moved generally westward, slowly gaining in intensity. Early on August 4, the depression attained tropical storm intensity. Ships in the vicinity of the storm reported a much stronger tropical cyclone than initially suggested. After reaching hurricane strength on August 5 south of the Mississippi River Delta, the storm strengthened further into a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 972 mbar (hPa; 28.71 inHg) at 0600 UTC on August 7\\\\. The hurricane moved ashore near Sabine Pass, Texas later that day at peak strength. Once inland, the storm executed a sharp curve to the north and quickly weakened, degenerating into a tropical storm on August 8 before dissipating over Arkansas on August 10\\\\. Reports of a potentially destructive hurricane near the United States Gulf Coast forced thousands of residents in low-lying areas to evacuate prior to the storm moving inland. Offshore, the hurricane generated rough seas and a strong storm surge, peaking at 6.4 ft (1.95 m) on the western edge of Lake Pontchartrain. The anomalously high tides flooded many of Louisiana's outlying islands, inundating resorts. Strong winds caused moderate infrastructural damage, primarily in Texas, though its impact was mainly to communication networks along the US Gulf Coast which were disrupted by the winds. However, much of the property and crop damage wrought by the hurricane was due to the torrential rainfall it produced in low-lying areas, setting off record floods. Rainfall peaked at 37.5 in (953 mm) in Miller Island off Louisiana, making it the wettest tropical cyclone in state history. Nineteen official weather stations in both Texas and Louisiana recorded record-level 24-hour rainfall totals for the month of August as a result of the slow-moving hurricane. Property, livestock, and crops‚Äìespecially cotton, corn, and pecan crops‚Äìwere heavily damaged. Entire ecosystems were also altered by the rainfall. Overall, the storm caused $10.75 million in damages and seven fatalities. Meteorological history In early August, an extratropical trough moved off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia, with a stationary front extending from it. A weak low-pressure area began to develop at the southern end of the front just offshore of Jacksonville, Florida. Initially, the storm had an open center of circulation and remained a frontal low as it moved southwestward across Florida, and thus was not considered a fully tropical system at the time. Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico, however, observations indicated that the disturbance developed a closed center of circulation. As a result, the storm was analyzed to have developed into a tropical depression off the western coast of Florida at 1200 UTC on August 3\\\\. At the time, weather reports revealed a definite cyclonic rotation, though the depression had a shallow minimum barometric pressure of 1012.5 mbar (hPa; 29.90 inHg). Moving west-southwest, the depression steadily intensified and attained tropical storm intensity at 0000 UTC on August 4\\\\. Late that evening, the tropical storm executed a slight northward curve. Strengthening continued into the following day, and ships in the storm's vicinity began to report a much stronger storm than was previously suggested. A ship reported the first gale- force winds associated with the storm at 2100 UTC on August 4. The S.S. Connecticut observed force 11 winds, the strongest wind measurement associated with the storm as recorded by vessel. A minimum pressure of 995 mbar (hPa; 29.39 inHg) was analyzed for the system at 0600 UTC on August 5 based on an observation from a nearby ship. At 1800 UTC on August 5, the storm strengthened to hurricane strength, the first tropical cyclone of the season to do so. At the time, the hurricane was moving very slowly westward, allowing it to strengthen despite its close proximity to land. The hurricane reached Category 2 intensity by 0600 UTC on August 7\\\\. The storm made landfall at peak intensity at around 2100 UTC later that day near Sabine Pass, Texas. At the time, the hurricane had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (160 km/h), with the storm's maximum winds extending out 10 mi (15 km) from its center. A weather station in Sabine Pass recorded a barometric pressure of 972 mbar (hPa; 28.71 inHg), which was analyzed to have been the lowest pressure measured in association with the storm. After moving inland, the storm immediately curved northward and began to gradually weaken. At 0600 UTC on August 8, the cyclone weakened to tropical storm strength while situated over East Texas, and later degenerated to a tropical depression by 1200 UTC the following day. The depression persisted into Arkansas, where it transitioned into a trough of low pressure at 1800 UTC on August 10 after its center of circulation lacked the well-defined closed circulation characteristic of tropical cyclones. Preparations and impact alt=Black and white contoured map showing rainfall amounts as contours, in 3 in (75 mm) increments from 3 in (75 mm) to 30 in (760 mm). Upon reaching hurricane strength off the United States Gulf Coast, hurricane warnings were issued for coastal regions from Lake Charles, Louisiana to Sabine Pass, Texas on August 7. Storm warnings were placed for areas east of Lake Charles to Grand Isle, Louisiana and areas west of Sabine Pass to Velasco, Texas. Offshore vessels were also warned of the storm in areas between Bay St. Louis, Mississippi and Galveston, Texas. At the time, the hurricane was forecast to make landfall slightly east of Port Arthur, Texas. In Texas, these warnings were delivered to residents via factory whistles. Evacuation procedures also began as a result of the approaching storm. The Spindletop near Beaumont, Texas and other nearby oil fields were evacuated. Coastal cities near Port Arthur, Texas were also evacuated by state highway police. Evacuees took shelter in refitted schools nearby. In the New Orleans, Louisiana area, several thousand residents were evacuated in advance of the storm. On Delacroix Island, Louisiana, 1,000 residents evacuated. Rail and airline operations were halted as a precautionary measure, but were later resumed after the storm passed. All storm warnings were ceased by midnight on August 8. Even before making landfall, the hurricane caused extensive damage in Louisiana, due in part to the hurricane's slow speed and close proximity to the state coast. Winds as high as 60 mph (100 km/h) brushed the coastline, causing extensive damage. Storm surge pushed coastal waters to near-record heights, inundating low-lying areas. Near Morgan City, Louisiana, 19 people went missing after going on a fishing trip; they were later found marooned at Atchafalaya Basin. The schooner J.W. Clise was abandoned during the storm 135 mi (215 km) south of the Mississippi River Delta, though its crew was also later rescued. Storm surge peaked at 6.4 ft (1.95 m) above-average in western portions of Lake Pontchartrain. A bridge crossing Thunder Bayou, which extended west of the lake, was washed out by the waves. Similarly, a station at Calcasieu Pass reported a storm surge 4.8 ft (1.46 m) high. Conservation officials feared the disturbance would disrupt the seafood and muskrat production. After the storm, it was estimated 75,000 muskrats were killed by the storm's effects. Offshore, Grand Isle was inundated by the strong waves. Around Houma, sugar cane crops were damaged. The hurricane was the strongest to impact Cameron since the tenth hurricane of the 1886 Atlantic hurricane season; strong gusts peaked at 70 mph (115 km/h), disrupting communication lines, thus isolating the city from other locations in the state. The high tides inundated town streets under 2 ft (0.6 m). Other areas extending from western Louisiana to Mobile, Alabama reported communication disruptions. In New Orleans, strong winds uprooted signboards and blew debris across the city streets. Several houses in Shell Beach and Delacroix Island were leveled by strong winds. Due to the storm's slow movement just offshore the Louisiana coast, the hurricane became the wettest tropical cyclone in state history, with numerous locations reporting record rainfall across the state. Of the state's ten highest official rainfall measurements associated with tropical cyclones, the two highest were measurements taken during the hurricane. Precipitation peaked at 37.5 in (953 mm) on Miller Island. For any given 20,000 mi2 (50,000 km/h2) area of Louisiana, the maximum rainfall averaged 12.1 in (307.3 mm). Thirteen official weather stations in the state reported monthly 24-hour rainfall total records. The highest of these was in Crowley, where 19.76 in (501.9 mm) of precipitation fell on August 9; the station would record 33.71 in (856.2 mm) of rain over the course of the storm. The torrential rainfall submerged the city under 2 ft (0.6 m) of floodwater. In Cameron, the storm dropped 21 in (533 mm) of rain was reported. In St. Landry Parish, bayous flowed over their banks, causing refugees to evacuate to Opelousas. In the Acadiana region of southern Louisiana, the resulting floods were considered worse than the floods that resulted from the Sauv√©'s Crevasse in 1849. There, whooping crane populations were severely impacted by the rainfall, and only one was known to be alive by 1947. The floods inundated roughly 2,000,000 acres (800,000 hectares) of land in Louisiana. Much of the lowland areas remained underwater until October 1940\\\\. As a result, cotton and corn crops experienced significant losses, as well as pecans. Livestock also saw large losses. Impassable areas caused by rising floodwaters prevented firefighters from extinguishing a fire which burned down much of the Shell Oil Company's offices and supply warehouses in the town of Iowa. Across the state, the hurricane caused $9 million in damages, though only six fatalities resulted, relatively less than most storms of similar scale. The low death count was attributed to large evacuation procedures which underwent prior to the storm, as well as guidance provided from the newly opened Weather Bureau east of Lake Charles. In East Texas, where the hurricane made landfall late on August 7, strong winds were felt across the region. Sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) were widespread, with occasional gusts peaking in excess of 90 mph (145 km/h). In Port Arthur, a barometer recorded a minimum pressure of 978 mbar (hPa; 28.87 inHg), establishing a new record for the lowest pressure measured by the particular weather station. The same station recorded 5.87 in (149.1 mm) of rainfall. Elsewhere in Port Arthur, strong winds caused significant damage to local oil refineries, with slight to moderate damage to other homes and businesses. Six people were injured in the city. Property damage in Jefferson County, containing Port Arthur and nearby suburbs, was estimated at $1 million. The city's communication and power service was cut during the storm. A weather station near Sabine Pass recorded a similarly low pressure of 973 mbar (hPa; 28.74 inHg). In Sabine Pass, strong winds unroofed houses, uprooted trees, and destroyed billboards. At the nearby Ged Oil Field, four wooden oil derricks were blown down. In Beaumont, three people were injured due to flying window and structural debris. Further inland, the hurricane produced considerable rainfall, though relatively less than in Louisiana. Six weather stations in the state set new 24‚Äìhour precipitation records for August. A measurement of 6.99 in (177.4 mm) on August 8 in Kirbyville was the highest of these records. However, maximum rainfall in the state was estimated to be in excess of 10 in (255 mm). The rice crop was particularly damaged by the rainfall. In Jefferson County, crop damage was estimated between $450,000‚Äì$500,000. In Texas, the hurricane caused $1.75 million in damages and resulted in one fatality.

Plot synopsis  The play is set in the Netherlands. An elderly mother lives in a city apartment with her daughter. She is the widow of a once successful foundry owner. For several decades, the mother and the daughter have made the same journey every summer, traveling from the city to their sea-side house in Katwijk. The first act of the play describes the back story of the characters, but also reveals that, unusually, this year the pair have asked a young playwright to join them on their sea-side retreat. The second act, set in their summer house on the coast, reveals a rising tension in the relationship between the mother and the daughter, who has taken a fancy to the young intellectual.  Metatheatricality  Like Bernhard's 1984 play Der Theatermacher, Am Ziel comments on the art form of theatre itself, most notably through the inclusion of the character of the young playwright, and the views the character of the mother voices of his work and the art form in general.  Dramatis personae and character analysis  Am Ziel is a play for three actors, two female and one male, and with a small non-speaking servant role. All characters remain nameless throughout the play. * The mother is representative of the past, and of the old bourgeoisie. * The daughter is representative of a future that still remains in a self-imposed immaturity. * The playwright represents pointless success because, although his play is applauded, although he triumphed in the virtual world of the theatre, his work does not matter in the real world. Although the play's title translates as \\"At the Destination\\", in reality all three characters are not at their destination: the daughter can not get rid of the pathological relationship with her mother, the writer can not begin a relationship with the daughter and the mother can not escape from her past. Bernhard leaves open whether it is possible for the daughter and the writer to free themselves from their own immaturity.  Production and publication history  Am Ziel was first performed on 18 August 1981 at Salzburger Festspielen with Marianne Hoppe in the lead role, directed by Claus Peymann. The German premiere of the play took place on 22 October 1981 at Bochum, directed, again, by Peymann. The play was translated to English by Jan-Willem Van Den Bosch and performed by Volcano Theatre Company directed by Kathryn Hunter. A BBC Radio production was adapted by Stephen Jeffreys and starred Geraldine McEwan as the mother, Imelda Staunton as the daughter, and Julian Rhind-Tutt as the writer. The play was first published in German in the October 1981 edition of Theater Heute.

It tells the story of Alexander the Great's career from his youth, through his successful campaigns against the Persian king Darius and other adversaries, his discovery of the wonders of the East, and his untimely death. George Saintsbury described King Alisaunder as \\"one of the most spirited of the romances\\", and W. R. J. Barron wrote of its \\"shrewd mixture of entertainment and edification made appetizing by literary and stylistic devices of unexpected subtlety.\\"  Composition and authorship  King Alisaunder dates from the end of the 13th century or the early 14th century, and is based on the Anglo-Norman Roman de Toute Chevalerie. The name of the author is not known, but he probably lived in or around London, and he is thought by some to have also written the romances Richard Coer de Lyon, Arthour and Merlin and The Seven Sages of Rome.  Manuscripts  King Alisaunder survives in enough manuscripts to indicate that it had some popularity in late mediaeval England. The fullest and most reliable text of the poem is found in Bodleian Library MS. Laud Misc. 622. It also appears in Lincoln's Inn Library MS. 150 and in National Library of Scotland MS. Advocates' 19.2.1, better known as the Auchinleck Manuscript. There is an early print of the romance dating from c. 1525, which survives only in one very fragmentary copy bound into the volume called \\"The Bagford Ballads\\".  Editions  As early as 1774 Thomas Warton declared in his History of English Poetry that King Alisaunder \\"deserves to be published entire on many accounts\\". The literary historians Thomas Park and George Ellis planned to collaborate on such an edition, but did not bring it to completion. In 1810 the Anglo-German scholar Henry Weber edited the poem for the first time as part of his Metrical Romances of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Centuries. This edition was largely based on the inferior Lincoln's Inn MS, but with all its faults it was the only complete one available until the middle of the 20th century. G. V. Smithers' Kyng Alisaunder, published by the Early English Text Society as volumes 227 and 237 of their Original Series (1951, 1957), was based on all three manuscripts and on the Bagford Ballads print; it remains the reference edition.

He was born at an Israeli facility in the vicinity of Azor, a town on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. The slaughter was scheduled for June 2013. He is described as sweet-tempered and white-headed, and his ear carried a tag numbered 269, indicating he was destined for slaughter. The Israeli protests regarding the calf were followed by protests in the U.K. and other places across the world. The protests aimed at conveying that animal parts eaten as food by humans once belonged to a living individual, who lived a tortured life and faced a brutal death, after which his or her carcass was processed into human food. The significance of the event led to the creation of \\"269 life\\"(:fr:269 Life France), an animal liberation movement founded in October 2012. Israeli protests On the occasion of World Farm Animals Day, (Gandhi's birthday) 2 October 2012, two Israelis, Zohar Gorelik and Sasha Boojor, and one Russian activist, Oleg Ozerov, had the number 269 branded on their skin with a hot-iron branding tool. Haaretz reports that this branding was an act of fellowship with Calf 269. The branding incident took place at Tel Aviv's Rabin square. The action is considered an attempt to bring to light the mistreatment of animals in the farming sector. According to Haaretz the treatment of animals would require terminologies applied to the Holocaust in order to adequately describe the situation. According to Netta Ahituv writing in the Haaretz, the calf's story has inspired a worldwide tattoo movement. At least a thousand individuals have had themselves branded or tattooed with the number 269. In a testimony a tattooed individual who was a tow truck driver narrated that the tattoo reminded one passenger of his grandmother's stories of German concentration camps. The website 269life.com was created by Boojor following this protest. The protests were an attempt to end the anonymity of millions of animals butchered for human consumption. The website declares, \\"This anonymous male calf will be forever immortalized on our bodies, and hopefully this message of solidarity will somehow bring a new way of looking at non-human animals.\\" Protests in the United Kingdom In the U.K., campaigners, motivated by this action of the Israelis, decided to brand themselves on their chest with the number 269. This took place in front of a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet in Leeds a day before their scheduled protest at the Leeds city centre. One protester was jailed, the police allegedly took away cameras and erased memory cards. A protester who was interviewed justified the protest as a reaction to the extreme cruelty perpetrated by the dairy industry such as shooting calves at birth. Protests in London were organised by Becky Folkard. Folkard said that although the protest might be considered extreme, other methods such as fastening oneself to railings and stopping horses by standing in their way were used by women to force authorities to give them a right to vote. PETA's spokesperson in a statement of support pointed that the suffering endured by non-human animals such as cows, chickens, or pigs when they are branded, have their testicles, beaks or horns cut, is no less than that of humans in a similar situation. Folkard's planned protests have been described as a disturbing community agitation opposing barbarity inflicted on industrial dairy animals. On September 26, 2015 another hot-iron branding was held in Birmingham. Response from animal farmers Joseph Keating, life-stock adviser of the National Farmers Union is quoted in a Guardian story as expressing surprise in response to the English protests. According to Keating, branding of animals has been banned in England for many years.

The organization was founded in 2005 and is based in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania.  Mission  The organization recognizes the disconnect between the social realities that teens face today and the programming offered to them by many organizations in the Jewish Community. The organization researches and develops curricula, trains educators to inspire teens, and assists institutions in weaving the approach into educational models. Because of this approach, Moving Traditions has been named \\"one of the 50 most innovative Jewish organizations\\" by Slingshot '16 for the 10th year. It uses their educational programs as a way to keep Jewish education relevant. Most Jewish teens in the United States do not continue with any form of Jewish education after having a Bar or Bat Mitzvah. Sally Gottesman, its cofounder, says that a community should be making Bar and Bat Mitzvah \\"a rite of passage into something rather than from something.\\" With their educational programs for boys and girls, Moving Traditions encourages participating in the program through 12th grade and focuses on addressing relevant topics that teenage boys and girls are dealing with.  Programs   Rosh Hodesh  Rosh Hodesh is a Jewish educational program which draws on Jewish themes and principles to help girls in grades 8-12 face the intricacies of adolescent life. The name of the program is derived from the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hodesh, which marks the beginning of every lunar month. It is a hybrid between a youth group and a facilitated discussion. It meets on a monthly basis, and is based on the Jewish tradition of a women's new moon celebtrations. Moving traditions partners with synagogues, schools, and Jewish Community Centers to operate the program. The organization trains adult group leaders to facilitate the Rosh Hodesh groups. They meet and discuss adolescent girls' self-esteem, leadership, competition, body image, Jewish identity and friendships.  Shevet Achim  Shevet Achim is the male counterpart. The name of the program is derived from the prayer Hine Ma Tov meaning \\"here's to what's good\\" from Psalm 133. The program grew out of three years of research conducted by the organization and published in the article Engaging Jewish Teen Boys: A Call to Action. Funders of the campaign for Jewish Boys include the UJA-Federation of New York, Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia, Rose Community Foundation, and the Lasko Family Foundations and the Covenant Foundation. It is a program for eighth- and ninth-grade boys with over 30 groups in 7 cities. Each meeting starts with a cooperative and non competitive game, or with food preparation, the goal of which is to break the ground for deeper conversation. Rabbi Daniel Brenner, director for initiatives for boys and men for Moving Traditions, believes that the program fills a void in the typical adolescent male life. Brenner says that \\"boys have physical and spiritual lives. If you just ask them 'How are you feeling?' they will say 'duhhh.'

Tzelem  Tzelem is a national online group for Jewish teens who identify as transgender, nonbinary, gender fluid, and gender questioning Jewish teens in partnership with Keshet.  Bat Mitzvah Comes of Age  The organizations and The National Museum of American Jewish History have collaborated to organize a traveling exhibition, Bat Mitzvah Comes of Age, featuring the story of how, in less than a century, individual girls, their parents and their rabbis challenged communal values to institute this now widely practiced Jewish ritual of the Bat Mitzvah. The exhibition is based on more than 150 responses to the Bat Mitzvah survey and showcases the evolution of the Bat Mitzvah through the stories of women who pioneered the sacred ritual of the Bat Mitzvah. \\"A couple years ago we wanted to show the evolution of the bat mitzvah\\" says Deborah Meyer, executive director and cofounder at Moving Traditions. \\"the ceremeony is often taken for granted; now every girl today seems to have a bat mitzvah. In Judaism, for thousands of years, it was men who were on the pulpit and now in the last several decades women have been welcomed to participate in the worship.‚Äù The exhibit includes oral history recordings of Bat Mitzvah stories and artifacts across history and Jewish movements and an interactive component in which visitors can share their coming of age stories. The exhibit mentions both everyday people as well as noted women, including Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan and activist Ruth Messinger. Now at the Jewish Community Center of Metropolitan Detroit through March 2013, the exhibit was launched in Manhattan in April 2012 and has since traveled to the Marcus Jewish Community Center of Atlanta and Larchmont Temple in Westchester, New York. The exhibit will next travel to the Jewish Museum of Florida in Miami Beach and the Oregon Jewish Museum in Portland.

History  Jamair was formed in 1946 by James B Muff, a former Chief Engineer at China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Eddie Quinn, a radio operator and pilot with CNAC. They were financially backed by the Maharajah Jam Sahib of Nawanagar and so was based out of Jamnagar where the Maharaja developed an air base for the aircraft. In 1949 - 50 they bought the Maharajah's interests in the business and moved to Dum Dum Airport in Calcutta, West Bengal with a fleet of 5 C47/DC 3s, loads of spares and a small engineering team. Mr.C.L.Chandak and his brother Mr.P.C.Chandak the experienced business family were taken in to Board as Directors and Jamair began operating air supply missions to nearby states in the North East, but as commercial trade improved rapidly post WW11, the Airline began receiving Charter orders from export houses and so began International cargo services as far away as South America & Europe. After nationalisation of internal routes in August 1953, Jamair reverted to being a private charter company. Business picked up soon and charters to major Indian cities like Bombay, Bangalore and Delhi were added to their schedule. In early sixties, this airline also used to operate from Delhi Safdarjung Airport to Jodhpur, Bikaner and Sriganganagar in Rajasthan. In 1951, Herbert Dequadros aka Bob Dequadros from Burma Air joined the team as head Engineer and General Manager and with his expertise the airline grew in business and expanded in 1974 with additional 3 DC 4s purchased from Indian Airlines. These large bodied aircraft were commissioned to fly on commercial routes carrying passengers from Calcutta to Bombay via Panagarh in West Bengal. Out of the 3 aircraft, one was de-commissioned for scrap and spares were used to keep the balance 2 flying. However, these planes proved too costly for the Airline and in 1975, they were re -sold to private operator Air Works India in Bombay. The DC 3s remained in the fleet with 2 out of 5 meeting with accidents, some severely with loss of lives. In 1976, the first batch of Boeing 737s came into operations by Indian Airlines and the DGCA authorised the aircraft to service similar Jamair routes, thus leading to losses for the old airline. Around 1966, the company invited a business partner so as to financially sustain the Airline, but this proved troublesome for the original owners over the years and the company became embroiled in legal battles right to the last day of operations. In 1971, Bob Dequadros became the 3rd partner with 40% stake in the Airline. Founder partner James B. Muff remained in New Delhi for the latter part of his life overseeing operations from the Northern part of India. He eventually became ill and died in Calcutta in 1977. Rising fuel costs, labor problems, local competition, a shrinking fleet and legal battles between partners eventually broke the company apart and in late 1977 operations ceased. The demise of James B. Muff left partner Bob Dequadros to conclude the numerous legal battles till his death in 1981. The remaining DC3s were scrapped in 1978 and money from the scrap dealers went to pay off staff and legal fees.  Incidents and accidents  * 15 May 1954 - A Douglas C-47B (registration VT-DGO) operated by Jamair touched down at Saugaon after a high approach. An overshoot was imminent, but the pilot realised that the aircraft could not be pulled up before the end of the runway. He retracted the undercarriage, causing the plane to slid off the runway, coming to rest at the edge of a deep drain. * 7 December 1961 - A Douglas C-47A (registration VT- AZV) operated by Jamair crashed on takeoff from Amritsar, India due to fuel starvation and pilot error; both pilots survived, but the aircraft was written off. * On 5 December 1970, - Douglas C-47A VT-CZC crashed shortly after take- off from Safdarjung Airport, New Delhi following an engine failure. The aircraft was operating a non-scheduled passenger flight. Five of the sixteen people on board were killed. * On 26 March 1971 - Douglas C-47A VT-ATT crashed into a hill near Hashimara whilst on a flight from Guwahati Airport to Bagdogra Airport. All 15 people on board were killed.  Fleet  The fleet consisted of 5 Douglas DC-3 & 3 DC-4 aircraft in 1977.

Background The Hilgos Foundation was founded by Berna Huebner in 1999. Huebner enlisted art students to work with her mother Hilda (Hilgos) Gorenstein who had Alzheimer's. The use of art opened a dialogue of communication that had been closed for years. In memory of her mother, Huebner founded the Hilgos Foundation which provides grants to art students who work with Alzheimer's patients. Students in the Hilgos project, in which \\"Hilgos scholars\\" participate each academic year, have served hundreds of people with Alzheimer's. Documentary film and book To further raise visibility of the arts and Alzheimer's, the Hilgos Foundation co-produced an international documentary film, I Remember Better When I Paint narrated by Olivia de Havilland. The film, co-directed by Huebner and filmmaker Eric Ellena, was inspired by the words of Hilgos who in the midst of Alzheimer's said \\"I remember better when I paint.\\" The documentary shows how the creative arts can help improve quality of life for Alzheimer's patients not only through creation and performance of art and music but also from exposure to the arts around the world, such as the Louvre museum. The documentary also shares findings by leading neurologists offering scientific support regarding the transforming power of the arts for people with Alzheimer's. The film includes a moving interview with Yasmin Aga Khan, actress Rita Hayworth's daughter; Hayworth developed early-onset Alzheimer's and also had painted. The film has been broadcast nationwide on public television stations in the United States. ' The Foundation has also produced a book based on Hilgos entitled I Remember Better When I Paint: Art and Alzheimer's: Opening Doors, Making Connections describing how people affected with dementia can be reconnected to themselves and how communications channels can be reopened through the creative arts.  Social Media  The Hilgos Foundation was a 2015 Shorty Awards finalist in the charity category. Also known as the Shorties, it is an annual awards event that honors the best in social media.

Subsequently he dedicated the rest of his life to art history, conservation issues and art criticism. Among his tangible contributions are the restoration of St. Nicholas' church in Tallinn, which he managed to convince the authorities to transform into a museum of ecclesiastical art rather than an initially planned \\"museum of atheism\\". In 1996, Raam was awarded the Order of the National Coat of Arms, 3rd class.

Such collections served two distinct purposes: to increase family prestige and to act as a store of value or investment. Discovery During the Civil War (1642‚Äì1651) huge amounts of silver were melted down to pay for military supplies and wages, and the silver dishes were buried by the Harris family on the wild moorland of Dartmoor, near to Radford, to avoid being looted by Parliamentary troops. The silver was never subsequently recovered by the Harris family, who remained at Radford until after 1810,Risdon, Tristram (d.1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, 1810 Additions, p.396 but was at last discovered in 1827, when three farm labourers employed by the Splat company of Brixham, discovered it in a cave they were excavating to increase the storage capacity for the company's potatoes. The local newspaper reported that \\"upwards of 30 dishes\\" had been found. In June 1911 the Splat family sold the dishes at Christie's auctioneers in London for ¬£11,500 . Importance The service has been described as \\"one of the most important groups of English silver to have been found in England.\\" As a set of relatively plain objects, of which the bullion value may have exceeded the artistic worth, this service represents \\"the unique survival of a type of utilitarian plate which is listed in the inventories of the gentry and aristocracy of the late Tudor and early Stuart periods.\\" Nomenclature The nomenclature of the hoard's name is subject to speculation by scholars. It was named by modern scholars the Armada Service in allusion to the Spanish Armada of 1588, a failed attempt by Spain to invade England, as it is believed to have a connection to New World silver captured and pilfered from the Spanish treasure fleet operating at about that time. 31 pieces were \\"commissioned to mark the conquering of the Spanish naval fleet and used at a dinner thrown\\" at Harris's seat at Radford. Some modern scholars have suggested a connection to the Madre de Deus (Mother of God), a Portuguese ship captured by the English in about 1590. However, Sir Christopher Harris worked for Sir Walter Raleigh in the Admiralty during the Anglo-Spanish War (1585‚Äì1604). His acquisition of these dishes at about the same time may suggest that they \\"represent the profits of his office\\". Subsequent history 26 dishes were acquired in July 1992 by the British Museum, when valued at ¬£900,000. In April 2013 an additional silver spice dish from the service was valued at \\"about ¬£100,000\\" on the BBC One television show Antiques Roadshow, by Alastair Dickenson, the programme‚Äôs silver expert. At an auction at Lawrence's of Crewkerne in Somerset, Dickenson acquired for a client two related pieces for ¬£135,000, which had been exported to the southern United States before being repatriated to England. The present location of these \\"three\\" (sic) pieces is unknown.

The Terror Lake Hydroelectric Generating Station is the principal power plant for Kodiak Island, Alaska. The Hydroelectricity station consists of three Pelton runner vertical shaft turbine units rated 11 megawatts each at 1200 feet head. Two units were installed when the station was constructed in 1985, and the third unit rated 11.5 MW was installed in the fall of 2013. The station is owned and operated by the Kodiak Electric Association, Inc., an electrical cooperative owned by its customers. The station is located about 25 miles from the city of Kodiak and is accessible only by air or boat. The Terror Lake main dam is 2100 feet long and 156 feet high and is a rockfill dam faced with concrete. A spillway with a 600-foot crest is adjacent to the north side of the dam. The lake acts as a reservoir with a surface area of 850 acres. It can store 78,000 acre-feet of water at a lake surface elevation of 1383 feet. The power tunnel is 10 feet in diameter and extends 26,300 feet from the dam to the penstock, from an inlet 143 feet below the nominal surface of the lake. The penstock that connects the power tunnel to the powerhouse is steel-lined and runs for 3,400 feet, varying from 56 to 96 inches in diameter. The station discharges water to the Kizhuyak River. Other civil works for the project include several dikes, smaller dams and diversion channels to collect water into the lake. A 17-mile private road was built between the barge landing site at the head of Kizhuyak Bay to the powerhouse. Major equipment and materials arrive by landing craft at the beach, and then are hauled up the private road. A 17-mile transmission line energized at 138 kV connects the switchyard near the powerhouse to the substation at the City of Kodiak. The project was initially constructed by the State of Alaska for US $230,000,000 in 1985. The project was licensed in 1981 for a term of 50 years. The project is located within the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge; environmental studies were carried out before construction, to evaluate impact on the Kodiak bear. Principal loads for the utility are the city of Kodiak, Alaska (and adjacent unincorporated suburbs), and the U.S. Coast Guard base (and adjacent Kodiak Airport). The hydroelectric plant replaced earlier diesel engine generators, which are now used only for peak loads during the fish canning season. Kodiak Electric also operates six 1.5 MW wind turbines. Since the network is isolated from the North American grid, a 3 megawatt battery bank was also purchased to help stabilize system frequency on sudden changes of load or sudden shifts in wind. It is the stated objective of the Kodiak co-op to obtain 95% of their electrical energy from renewable sources by 2020. The low cost of power generated by Terror Lake has stabilized the electrical rates for the city of Kodiak, since this displaces most of the oil that would otherwise be consumed by diesel generator sets.\\"Proposed Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Lease Sale, lower Cook Inlet\\" United States.

He fought for the Papal States between 1860 and 1870 during the Italian unification, which he opposed. He later assisted the White Fathers missionaries in East Africa and played an important role in the suppression of the slave trade between 1885 and 1892. He married a local woman and settled by the shore of Lake Tanganyika, where he lived until his death at the age of eighty five. Early years L√©opold Louis Joubert was born at Saint-Herblon, France on 22 February 1842. As a child he wanted to be like the Christian warriors of the past. He was given the nickname \\"Ludovic\\" as a child, and was often called by this name as an adult. He attended school at Ancenis (1854‚Äì1858) and then Combr√©e (1858‚Äì1860). Joubert left school in 1860 to join the army that Pope Pius IX was raising to defend the Papal States as a member of the Franco-Belgian corps that was later called the Papal Zouaves. On 18 September 1860 Joubert fought at the Battle of Castelfidardo, where he was wounded, taken prisoner and returned to France. After recovering, he went back to Rome in June 1861, and was appointed Sergeant in 1862. He remained in Rome as a member of the Zouaves after Napoleon III withdrew the French troops from Italy in December 1866. He became a Lieutenant on 30 December 1866 and Captain on 14 December 1867, aged twenty- five. On 29 September 1870 he commanded the defenders of the Porta Salaria during the unsuccessful defense of Rome against the army of the new Kingdom of Italy. During the Franco-Prussian War General Athanase Charette organized the French Zouaves as a corps of \\"Volunteers of the West\\". Joubert served as a captain in this corps but refused an offer of a permanent commission as a captain in the French army, so as to remain at the service of the Pope. After the war ended in 1871 he returned to La S√©bili√®re in M√©sanger, where he worked as a farmer until 1879. In 1879 he became secretary to General Charette and tutor to his son. The General was a supporter of the Bourbon monarchy and also a passionate advocate for the Pope's temporal sovereignty. First African expedition Tippu Tip, a powerful slaver who gave the missionaries considerable trouble and later became governor of the Upper Congo. On 15 January 1880 Joubert left Marseille for Algiers where he offered to work as an armed auxiliary protecting the missionaries being dispatched by Archbishop Charles Lavigerie's Society of Missionaries of Africa, or White Fathers. The missionary caravans were menaced by armed slave traders in the Great Lakes region of East Africa. On 8 November 1880 Joubert left Algiers with the third caravan in command of six Zouaves. The caravan arrived at Bagamoyo, opposite Zanzibar, on 3 December 1880. After many delays and difficulties it reached Tabora in what is now Tanzania in December 1881. Joubert continued on to Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika, which he reached on 7 February 1882. He helped fortify the mission at Mulwewa on the west shore of the lake, and to train the local African defenders. He also helped found missions at the north and south ends of the lake, and was responsible for building the fortified mission of Lavigerieville (Kibanga). Later the missionaries abandoned three of the new stations due to attacks by the powerful slave traders Tippu Tip and Rumaliza. A spitting cobra temporarily blinded Joubert. He had to return to France in May 1885 for treatment. Concept of the Christian kingdom Cardinal Lavigerie was keen on the idea of establishing a central Christian state that could dominate the interior of Africa and ward off the influence of Freemasons, Socialists, Protestants and Muslims. At one point the kingdom of Buganda was seen as potentially playing this role, and Joubert thought he might have to become \\"Minister of War to His Black Majesty, Mutesa.\\" This idea was abandoned, as was a plan to use the Kingdom of Lunda as a base. In 1885 the Berlin Conference settled the European colonial spheres of interest in Africa. The area that now consists of Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania (other than Zanzibar) became German East Africa. The Belgian station of Mpala, which had been founded in 1883 by √âmile Storms on the west shore of Lake Tanganyika, was militarily isolated now that the stations of Karema and Tabora lay in German territory. King Leopold II of Belgium decided to focus his efforts on the Congo River, and offered Mpala and Karema to Cardinal Lavigerie for White Fathers missions. Lavigerie accepted the offer, thinking Mpala could be the basis for his Christian state, and that if a suitable African leader could not be found \\"it would not be impossible ... for a brave and Christian European to fill this [responsibility].\\" Return to Africa German East Africa, 1894. Lake Tanganyika forms the western boundary. Marungu (and Mpala) are to the west of the southern portion of Lake Tanganyika. Lake Tanganyika at Mpala in 1892 Later in 1885 Joubert again offered his services to Lavigerie, and this was accepted in a letter of 20 February 1886. Joubert reached Zanzibar on 14 June 1886, and reached the mission at Karema on 22 November 1886. He remained there for some months at the request of the Vicar Apostolic, Mgr. Jean- Baptiste-Fr√©zal Charbonnier, to protect the mission against attacks by slavers. He crossed the lake and reached Mpala on 20 March 1887. Charbonnier had given him full authority as civil and military ruler of the Mpala region. Lavigerie later said that Joubert could have become King of Marungu if he had wished. Joubert found that the priests had already organized a police force of local warriors at Mpala. Immediately after arriving, Joubert was thrown into the struggle with dealers in slaves and ivory. He engaged in skirmishes in March and again in August, where his small force of thirty soldiers armed with rifles came close to defeat. Joubert again had to intervene in November 1887, and in 1888 defeated a force of 80 slavers, but his forces were too small to prevent continued attacks. Later, Joubert created a strong and effective military force from three hundred of Storms's fighters. The constant fighting worried some of the missionaries, notably Father Fran√ßois Coulbois, who were concerned that the slavers might decide to attack the mission itself. Joubert married Agnes Atakaye on 13 February 1888. They were to have ten children. Two died young, and one became a priest. When Mgr. Charbonnier died on 16 March 1888, Coulbois became Pro-Vicar of Upper Congo. He did not recognize that Joubert had civil authority, and imposed tight restrictions on his actions. Both men appealed for support to Cardinal Lavigerie. In response, Lavigerie said that the missionaries must have no involvement with military affairs, and the military leader must live at a distance from the mission to avoid being identified with the mission. The new Vicar Apostolic, Bishop L√©once Bridoux, arrived in January 1889. He confirmed that Joubert was both civil and military leader, but said that military operations must be purely defensive. Joubert moved to St Louis de Murumbi, some distance away. This was a fortified village that he built three leagues from Mrumbi mountain, a days walk from Mpala and from the shore of the lake. His voluminous correspondence with his brother in France and with General de Charette is often dated from this village. A visitor to St. Louis Mrumbi in 1891 met Joubert. He said that he \\"... appeared to be about forty-five years of age, short, but very sturdily built. He said of the station, Isolation In January 1889 the mission was cut off from the outside world by Abushiri Revolt against the Germans in Bagamoyo and Dar es Salaam. Joubert was to receive no mail for three years. The mission suffered from repeated and deadly raids. Around the end of May 1890, while Joubert was absent, a group of Arabs prepared to cross the Lukuga River about to the north of Mpala. Some skirmishing occurred between the Arabs and the mission's African forces before Joubert could reach the scene. The Arabs tried to negotiate with the missionaries, saying they would not harm the mission if the priests abandoned Joubert. Bridoux refused. It seemed that serious fighting was going to break out, when a storm arose that destroyed some of the Arab fleet and forced them to withdraw. Rumaliza remained determined to eliminate Joubert, who was disrupting the slave trade. By 1891 the slavers had control of the entire western shore of the lake apart from the region defended by Joubert around Mpala and St Louis de Mrumbi. Joubert called for help from Europe. Joubert's status was ambiguous. The Belgians had appointed Tippu Tip as their lieutenant in the region, but Joubert refused to recognize the authority of the slaver. During a lull in January 1891, Father I. Moinet visited Ujiji. There he found Rumaliza flying a German flag and saying he was waiting for the Germans to arrive so he could hand over to them. In a letter to Joubert in April 1891, Rumaliza asked if he was employed by the missionaries or by the government of the Congo. Joubert was evasive in his reply, pointing out that Rumaliza sometimes flew the German flag, sometimes the flag of Zanzibar and sometimes that of Britain. Alphonse Jacques in the Congo in 1903 A Belgian relief expedition was organized. It was led by Captain Alphonse Jacques and three other Europeans, and reached Zanzibar in June 1891, Karema on 16 October 1891 and Mpala on 30 October 1891. When the Jacques expedition arrived Joubert's garrison was down to about two hundred men, poorly armed with \\"a most miscellaneous assortment of chassepots, Remingtons and muzzle-loaders, without suitable cartridges.\\" He also had hardly any medicine left. Captain Jacques gave Captain Joubert papers that made him a Congo citizen and officer of the Congo armed forces. Jacques asked Joubert to remain on the defensive while he moved north, founded the fortress of Albertville and tried to suppress slaving. Sporadic fighting with the Arabs continued in 1892. The danger from slavers was not finally removed until the 1893 expedition of Baron Francis Dhanis. The European press was critical of these actions, described by Le Soir in July 1892 as the \\"military adventures of Cardinal Lavigerie\\". Later career Fishermen on Lake Tanganyika In the mid-1890s the agents of the Congo Free State were directed to assimilate the Christian Kingdom on the west of Lake Tanganyika. The former \\"king\\" Joubert was removed from any significant authority. For a period Marungu fell into lawlessness. The Belgian State decorated Joubert in 1896. In 1898 the Force Publique of the Congo mutinied, and for some time the area around Lake Tanganyika was threatened by rebels. After this the region became peaceful. Both the King of Belgium and the Pope later knighted Joubert. After laying down his arms, Joubert became a catechist, teacher and medical worker. He lived on at St Louis de Murumbi until 1910, when it was abandoned due to sleeping sickness. He then founded the mission of Sainte Marie of Moba, at Misembe on the western lake shore to the south of Mpala. In his last years Joubert became both blind and deaf. He died on 27 May 1927 at the age of 85 after having lived on the shores of Lake Tanganyika for 46 years. Joubert was buried in Baudouinville Cathedral. In 1933 a committee in Brussels commissioned the sculptor Jules Jourdan to create a medallion of Joubert based on photographs.

The Housing Center provides direct services in Oak Park and surrounding communities throughout Chicago and western Cook County.  Mission Since 1972, OPRHC has worked to sustain racial integration and affirmatively further fair housing in Oak Park and the surrounding communities. The Housing Center strives to reconnect neighborhoods by ensuring access to quality housing, regardless of race, gender, religious views, sexual orientation, familial status, or disability. History In 1963, citizen groups began to lobby for an open housing legislation. From this, in 1968, the Village of Oak Park adopted the Fair Housing Ordinance. In the early 1970s, African American families began to integrate into Oak Park. Many faced discrimination in neighboring communities so in 1972, Roberta \\"Bobbie\\" Raymond opened the Oak Park Housing Center to ensure equal access to housing. The idea for the Housing Center came from her master‚Äôs thesis. The Housing Center initially launched with a staff of twenty and approximately twelve relators willing to show their clients housing in Oak Park. Since then the Oak Park Housing Center became the Oak Park Regional Housing Center to highlight the mission to integrate not only Oak Park, but also to encourage fair housing throughout the entire region. The center has been featured by the American Planning Association for being the third best neighborhood in the US, the hit television show The View for being named one of the top five sexiest suburbs in the United States, Travel and Leisure magazine named Oak Park one of the most beautiful neighborhoods, and Chicago Magazine votes Oak Park one of the twenty best towns and neighborhoods in Chicago and the suburbs. Oak Parker The Oak Parker Magazine is the distinctive voice on the history, culture, and diverse lifestyles that shape the Oak Park community. This magazine has been published by the Oak park Regional Housing Center since 2011. In addition to the print version of the magazine, theoakparker.com is a regularly updated source for events and topics including home decor, finance, health, food & culture, and monthly features of local businesses. Rental advising Oak Park‚Äôs housing market is 40% rental and over one-third of renters move every year. Every day, the Oak Park Regional Housing Center helps prospective renters make affirmative moves by encouraging clients to consider moves that will sustain or improve Oak Park‚Äôs integration. Despite the numerous obstacles for sustaining racial integration, 800 of their clients made affirmative moves in 2011, 575 of the moves were in Oak Park. That is a 67% affirmative rate for Oak Park, 20 percentage points higher than moves to Oak Park that are without the Oak Park Regional Housing Center. Their numbers continue to grow year after year. In 2010, 700 renters came the OPRHC in search of housing and by 2011, this number grew to 869. Fair housing advocacy and policy The Oak Park Regional Housing Center provides leadership and partners with organizations and jurisdictions at the local, state, and national level. They promote equitable public policy by consulting with the agencies at the federal, state, and local level. In addition, they are large supporters of local policy and encourage inter-jurisdictional collaboration in order to ensure that the integration in Oak Park spreads throughout the region. Landlord technical assistance The Housing Center offers technical assistance to local landlords. Trainings include screening consistency, rental agreements, proper notices, compliance with landlord/tenant laws, unit standards, and property management. The Technical Assistance program also inspects units and connects landlords with grant dollars and loans to improve the quality of the units and overall building. This department also markets apartment listings to perspective residents and screens clients to ensure that the apartment listings they receive fit their preferences and budget. West Cook Homeownership Center The West Cook Homeownership Center works to ensure that people of all races and incomes have access to homeownership. Programs include financial fitness, downpayment assistance, employer-assisted housing, and first-time homebuyer seminars. The West Cook Homeownership Center is also a part of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, allowing the agency to rehab and market homes within communities of West Suburban Cook County. Community engagement The Housing Center recognizes that fair housing connects to all other facets of society. Therefore, the Housing Center works closely with the Village of Oak Park and numerous local agencies to promote sustainable and racially integrated community initiatives. In 2012, the Oak Park Regional Housing Center launched the Young Integration Leaders Alliance (YILA) in partnership with Oak Park River Forest High School and the Minority Student Achievement Network. The alliance is a hands-on, discussion based education program offered to high school students that ends with a summer internship. The group focuses on racial integration and provide opportunities for leadership within the high school and larger community.

Background Tyson had twice defeated the number two ranked heavyweight, Donovan \\"Razor\\" Ruddock, in 1991. Shortly after his second victory over Ruddock, a blockbuster deal was made that would see Tyson face the Undisputed Heavyweight Champion Evander Holyfield on November 8, 1991.

The fight The fight lasted only 89 seconds with Tyson earning an easy victory via disqualification. McNeeley started the fight by aggressively attacking Tyson as soon as the opening bell rang. Tyson was able to avoid McNeeley's wild punches and land a straight right that dropped McNeeley to the canvas less than 10 seconds into the fight. After taking referee Mills Lane's standing eight count, McNeeley was allowed to continue and again continued his assault on Tyson. The two men exchanged punches in the corner as the first minute of the round passed. Less than 20 seconds later, Tyson landed a right uppercut that again sent McNeeley down. With McNeeley clearly hurt from the exchange, his manager Vinnie Vecchione entered the ring to prevent McNeeley from taking any more damage, causing Lane to end the fight and award Tyson the victory by disqualification.Con Job, Sports Illustrated article, 1995-08-28, Retrieved on 2013-05-07.

The library also uses the following committees for administrative purposes: finance, appointments, heads of sections/college libraries, professional staff, ICTs/projects, research and staff development, preservation and conservation and staff welfare. Library sections Africana and Special Collections The Africana and special collection area of the library is located on the fourth floor of the main library. It contains materials related to East Africa, general Africana texts and books and documents on Uganda. This includes papers, reports and publications from individuals, private and official organizations dating ranging from the 19th century to current day. Examples include copies of the first newspapers and photographs from Uganda,church files, UN publications and diaries and journal entries form explorers, travelers, missionaries, military and political figures. Especially notable is the amount of historical documents from the early periods of colonization in East Africa. Considered the primary depository and research center for East African history, it also includes a music and photographic collection of great historic and cultural significance. Theses and dissertations from African universities are also stored in this area along with university archival materials. Book Bank Originating in 1990, the book bank houses copies of textbooks and classroom materials collected from academic departments throughout the university's history. Current textbooks and materials are also held here. It ensures that students have access to textbooks despite limited funds, allows sharing between departments and keeps a record of curricular materials. The collection currently contains 200,000 materials. Law The area dedicated to law contains textbooks on law and human rights in a number of languages and periodicals and law reports from the UK, America, India and Africa. It also houses the Human Rights and Peace Center Collection of humanitarian law materials which focuses on teaching research, teaching and activism. In conjunction with the program of study offered by the University, this is the first human rights center in Sub- Saharan Africa. International Development Agency Named for the International Development Agency which donated the core collection, it includes reference materials and textbooks for undergraduate use. The World Bank continues to play an active role in the contribution of materials. ICT and technical facilities Each of the branch libraries contains technology services and facilities. The majority are in the main branch, including computer labs and training units. There is a specialized computer lab for students with disabilities and designated areas software use and digital media. The Research and Learning Commons provide students with support and tutoring with research, writing and mathematics. There is also an online training platform which provides information about upcoming bibliographic and technology instruction courses. According to Elly Amani Gamukama, the systems administrator at the main library, \\"the university has made it a policy that every first year student must go through a computer course. We are aiming at reaching the international standard which is 1 computer per 50 students. Starting next year, all students will undergo training in the use of the available databases and other library resources that will be compulsory and carrying credit\\". Projects and partnerships  Carnegie Corporation of New York Funding Support  The libraries of Makerere University received a $650K grant in 2001 for the duration of four years. The project goal was to \\"make significant contribution to equitable improvement of the academic standards of Makerere University, with a priority to science-based and gender disciplines\\". Specific objectives included the creation of an interlibrary loan program with library partners and other academic libraries, to increase the collection in specific areas, minimize book theft and loss and hire and retrain staff. The implementation of an Electronic Document Delivery Service, Science Citation Index and book safety system resulted from the grant. Approximately 5,000 books relating to the fields of science and gender were added to the collection. Funding also purchased computers and established an information literacy program for students, faculty and staff. The project is ongoing and received an additional $400K grant in 2004 to develop an automation process beginning with the main library. Swedish International Development Cooperation The Department for Research Cooperation at the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency provided the library with almost $1 million to build ICT structure, create a PHD program for library staff, increase training and purchase subscriptions to electronic journals and licenses. This also created a partnership with a variety of university libraries in Sweden to share practices, training and education. Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation has used a variety of non-governmental organizations to support development in Uganda through the improvement of academic services at the university. The library recently received a $200K grant to support an administrative computing project. Database of African Theses and Dissertation Launched in 2003, the Database of African Theses and Dissertation is part of the Association of African Universities program to manage the collection, organization and dissemination of dissertations and theses. Partially sponsored by the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation, this is the largest collection of African scholarly work in the world. Some of the collection has been digitized and is available at http://www.aau.org/?q=datad. Digitization Markerere University Library Information System The library is in the process of digitizing its collection for access through its online public access catalog. This electronic database will replace its print indexes. The project also includes digitizing photographs and scanning archival material to make the rare collection more accessible.

Life The eldest son of Peter Chamberlen the third by his marriage with Jane, eldest daughter of Sir Hugh Myddelton, bart., he was born in the parish of St. Anne's, Blackfriars, between 1630 and 1634. He is styled Doctor of Medicine in the lists of the Royal Society. In 1668 Chamberlen had a project for ridding London of the plague. He acquired a reputation in his profession, more especially as a man- midwife, and on the petition of his father he obtained, in February 1673, the reversion of Sir John Hinton's place as physician in ordinary to the king. The office fell to him the following October. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in April 1681. In March 1688 the Royal College of Physicians, on the information of Walter Charleton, took action against Chamberlen for the \\"illegal and evil\\" practice of medicine. He continued, however, to enjoy an extensive business at court, while he was selected by James II to attend Mary of Modena in her confinements. At the birth of Prince James Francis Edward Stuart, on 10 June 1688, Chamberlen came too late to be present. He later wrote a letter to the Electress Sophia of Hanover on the circumstances, dated from the Hague on 4 October 1713. Chamberlen's politics were those of the Whigs. George Wingrove Cooke considered that Chamberlen had suffered for his political principles. He had a general pardon issued in June 1686.A Pardon to Hugh Chamberlain of all Treasons, misprisons of Treason, Insurrection, Kebellions, & other Crimes and Offenses by him committed before the first day of June instant, and of all Indictments, Conviccons, Paines and fforfeitures by reason thereof: With such Clauses and non obstantes as are usuall in Pardons of like nature (Docquet Books, Signet, Record Office). Chamberlen ultimately went to Amsterdam, where he practised for several years. He parted with the family secret of the midwifery forceps to the Dutch surgeon Hendrik van Roonhuisen. He was still alive in November 1720. Works In August 1670, while staying at Paris, Chamberlen met the surgeon Fran√ßois Mauriceau, and two years later he published a translation of Mauriceau's treatise on mid- wifery.The Diseases of Women with Child, and in Child-bed, 5th edition online, 1716. This became for a standard text-book, in editions republished to 1765. In the preface are statements relating to the invention and use of the obstetric forceps by the Chamberlen family. In 1685 Chamberlen published Manuale Medicum: or a small Treatise of the Art of Physick in general and of Vomits and the Jesuits Powder in particular, London, 1685. This book was written for a son sent to the East Indies. Professional colleagues judged him from it an empiric. Chamberlen's last medical work was A few Queries relating to the Practice of Physick (1694).A few Queries relating to the Practice of Physick, with remarks upon some of them, modestly proposed to the serious consideration of Mankind, in order to their information how their lives and healths (which are so necessary, and therefore ought to be so dear to them) may be better preserved, London, 1694. It added little to the Manuale Medicum, but touched on preventive medicine with A Proposal for the better securing, of health, intended in the year 1689 and still ready to be humbly offered to the Consideration of the Honourable Houses of Parliament. He also published The Great Advantages of both Kingdoms of Scotland and England, by an Union. By a Friend to Britain (1702). The \\"land bank\\" In November 1690 Chamberlen issued a first draft of his financial scheme Dr. Hugh Chamberlen's Proposal to make England Rich and Happy. A bank was to advance money on the security of landed property by issuing large quantities of notes. James Hobson Aveling catalogued 45 pamphlet replies. Chamberlen set apart three evenings in the week to promote his project, and lobbied Members of Parliament. In December 1693 Chamberlen laid his plan before the House of Commons, and petitioned to be heard. A committee was appointed which reported favourably; but was ignored. Two years later the project was revived in a modified form; and bill passed both houses and received the royal assent on 27 April 1696. Immediately afterwards, however, the parliament was prorogued. Chamberlen was mocked, and in March 1699, went to Scotland. In 1700 he was urging the latest version of his land bank scheme on the Parliament of Scotland, in a pamphlet A Few Proposals humbly recommending .... the Establishing a Land-Credit in this Kingdom. Family By his marriage on 28 May 1663 at St Paul's, Covent Garden, with Dorothy, daughter of Colonel John Brett, Chamberlen had three sons, Hugh the younger, Peter, and Myddelton, and one daughter, Dorothy.

The current building, the construction of which was completed in 1888, is at least the third version of the church, which dates back to at least the early 13th century. All Saints' Church was commissioned by the church rector, Edward Handley, in memory of one of his relatives. History All Saints' Church, Winthorpe (pictured), a Church of England parish church in Winthorpe, Nottinghamshire, is within the Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham. It was built in 1886 to 1888 to replace the old Georgian structure, which had fallen into disrepair.The Buildings of England: Nottinghamshire: Nikolaus Pevsner. The new building was commissioned by the then recently appointed rector, Edward Handley, a relative of William Handley, who had served as rector of the old church from 1836 to 1873. The new rector selected as architect Sidney Gambier-Parry, the son of philanthropist Thomas Gambier-Parry. The firm chosen to execute Gambier-Parry's Gothic design was Mackenzie & Sons of Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire. The firm selected to produce the stained-glass windows was that of Clement Heaton, James Butler, and Robert T. Bayne, founded in 1952. The site of the church, off Gainsborough Road, was that occupied by Parliamentary troops during their attacks on Newark-on-Trent at the time of the English Civil War of the mid 17th century. The original version of the church was severely damaged during that civil war. However, following the passage of the Act of Uniformity in 1559, decades earlier, a report made in August 1559 found that the chancel was already roofless. The oldest church dates back to at least the 13th century, although records are very limited prior to the late 17th century. The second version of All Saints' was built after the civil war. It underwent substantial repairs in 1779 when the tower fell and had to be rebuilt. As the second building was razed in 1886, excavation revealed the base for a cannon, gunpowder, and hundreds of skeletons. In addition, a vault within the walls of the old church contained the remains of Handley ancestors. In August 1886, construction of the new church commenced. Sir Henry Bromley, Baronet of Stoke Hall, East Stoke, Nottinghamshire, placed the foundation stone of the new church on All Saints' Day, 1 November 1886. Construction was completed in 1888 and, on 19 June 1888, All Saints' Church was consecrated by the Bishop of Lincoln. The consecration was postponed from 7 June 1888 as the Bishop of Southwell had taken ill. The church was Grade II listed on 15 October 1984 by English Heritage. At the same time, the Thompson tomb in the churchyard and the gate piers of the entrance to the churchyard were also Grade II listed. In 1996, Anthony Keeble Shaw was appointed priest-in-charge of All Saints' Church, Winthorpe. He was also appointed priest-in-charge of St Bartholomew's, Langford and St Giles', Holme, and Diocesan Inspector of Church Schools for Southwell. In recent years, the rectory was sold and the parish has not had a priest residing in Winthorpe. Design View of the southwestern aspect of All Saints' Church, Winthorpe The new church was constructed primarily of red Walkeringham brick. Ancaster stone was utilised for exterior trim, with red Mansfield stone employed in the interior. The new tower, with brick spire, is at the northwest corner of the church. The lower portion of the tower features the entrance to the building, as well as a porch with a staircase that extends up to the belfry. There, two new bells were supplemented by three old bells from the former church. The number of bells was eventually increased to six. The arched entrance to the porch has ashlar trim, over which there is an ashlar cross. The ground floor of the tower has the entrance to the north, a pair of lancet windows to the east, and another pair to the west. Each side of the first floor of the tower features a grouping of three lancets, with a single lancet window flanked by blind lancets. The bell chamber, at the second floor of the tower, has four pairs of lancet windows. The spire has four lucarnes and a pinnacle trimmed with ashlar crockets. The church roof is tiled, the gable ends capped with stone. An apsidal baptistry which projects from the west side of the nave has three lancet windows, over which is a band course. The south wall of the nave has three double lancet windows, each of which is surmounted by a cinquefoil and band course. The south wall of the chancel has three lancet windows with ashlar trim. The nave and chancel are in the same locations as those of the previous church. However, the baptistry is at the site of the previous west tower. The new church is substantially larger than the former. The current tower, vestry, north aisle, organ chamber, and most eastern portion of the chancel are all located on previously unoccupied ground, although the vestry was built over the Handley vault. The north aisle has five arched windows with ashlar trim. The double lancet of the organ chamber gable is surmounted by a quatrefoil. The illumination provided by stained-glass windows is supplemented by gas lighting. The most notable set of stained-glass windows in All Saints' is the grouping of three lancet windows above the altar, at the east end of the chancel. It was contributed by Mrs. Edward Gordon as a memorial to Cassandra Handley, the spouse of Charles Richard Handley. The set of windows depicts Christ surrounded by some of the saints. In addition to the three old bells, there are several other vestiges of the former church. In the churchyard, they include an oval stone tablet and the pinnacle. The interior of the building contains a ceiling boss, door lock with key, royal arms, and some monuments from the previous church. Remnants of the original version of the church are limited to those incorporated into the wall of the churchyard. Memorials The cost of construction of the church was borne by Edward Handley, in memory of his cousin Philip Handley. Memorial tablets to both men are located in the church nave. Other tablets dedicated to the memory of members of the Handley family line the walls of the vestry. Those members include: William Farnworth Handley, John Handley, his wife Martha Story Handley, his son John Handley, and Benjamin Handley. Tablets behind the organ honor Benjamin and Frances Handley, as well as four of their children, including their son Benjamin Handley who drowned as a young man in the Tagus in 1813. Memorials to Henry Handley (Edward's father) and Georgiana Handley (Edward's sister) are present in the chancel. Other memorials in the organ chamber include those to William Rastell and his wife Mary, their son William Thomas Rastell, Annie Ranstall, Roger Pocklington and his wife Mary, their son Roger Pocklington and his wife Jane, and Christopher Morley and his wife Charlotte. Memorials to churchwarden Robert Hunt Bradley, physician Robert Taylor and his wife Elizabeth, and their son Robert Taylor are present in the nave. Other tributes are scattered throughout the church. East Trent Group of Churches All Saints' Church, Winthorpe is part of a group of eleven parishes, the East Trent Group of Churches, which receives support from David Milner. He has been the priest-in-charge at All Saints' since 2006. The other parishes include: *St Bartholomew's Church, Langford *St Giles' Church, Holme *St Cecilia's Church, Girton *All Saints' Church, Harby *St George the Martyr's Church, North & South Clifton *All Saints' Church, Collingham *St John the Baptist's Church, Collingham *St Helena's Church, South Scarle *Holy Trinity Church, Besthorpe *St Helen's Church, Thorney References Category:Church of England church buildings in Nottinghamshire Winthorpe Category:Churches completed in 1888 ","title":"All Saints' Church, Winthorpe"},{"id":"39075073","text":"Papurana is a village situated in Jhunjhunu district in Rajasthan, India.

The episode was written by Andy Bobrow and directed by Tristram Shapeero. The episode makes heavy use of a parody focusing on The Hunger Games. This episode marks the first in the series to have no involvement from series creator Dan Harmon, although he was credited as an executive consultant. Plot The episode begins in an imaginary version of Greendale Community College created in the mind of Abed, titled \\"Abed's Happy Community College Show\\", which features parody elements poking fun at sitcom cliches, including the use of multi-camera production, a laugh track and the character of \\"Pierce\\" being portrayed by a guest star (Fred Willard). Abed is using the fictional show as a coping mechanism to deal with fear of losing the study group following graduation. In the real world, the study group assembles at Greendale to take part in their new History class (\\"History of Ice Cream\\"), only to discover that the class was over-booked due to forgery. Dean Pelton, in an effort to award seats to the appropriate number of students, organizes The Hunger Deans, a series of physical challenges which will grant seats in the class. During the episode, Troy and Britta's newfound relationship becomes strained, and Annie attempts to pull pranks on the Dean. Jeff, desperate to prove he has changed for the better, takes part in the Dean's games to earn the study group seats in the class after upsetting the group by revealing he planned to graduate early without them. Abed becomes increasingly strained by the prospect of the group's graduation, and further retreats into his mind, creating a TV Show within the fictional TV Show in his mind, called Greendale Babies, portraying the group as animated infants that will be together forever. Eventually, the group bands together to help Abed. Inside of the fictional \\"Abed's Happy Community College Show\\", Jeff delivers a speech implying that the group will always be friends (despite the fact Jeff in the real world gives no speech), and Abed is able to accept the fact that the group will not disband after graduation. The group is unable to make it into the history of ice cream class. After, it is revealed that Dean Pelton has moved in next-door to Jeff at his apartment building, and that Greendale will have to offer another history class or lose \\"like $40,000 in grant money.\\" Ben Chang, naked and delirious, approaches a mailman on the street, handing him a note that says: \\"Hello, my name is Kevin. I have Changnesia.\\" Production This is the first episode of the series without the involvement from series creator Dan Harmon. New showrunners David Guarascio and Moses Port served as executive producers for the fourth season. The episode was written by co-executive producer Andy Bobrow, and was directed by Tristram Shapeero, who had directed several episodes in past seasons and is now an executive producer and the primary director for the fourth season. Reception The episode was seen by approximately 3.88 million viewers when it premiered. The episode was the highest-rated episode since \\"Urban Matrimony and the Sandwich Arts\\", which aired on March 15, 2012.
