Early life and education Potts earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in History from the University of Sydney in 1972. Career Potts began his diplomatic career in Madrid, Spain, as Third and Second Secretary from 1973 to 1975. At his next posting in Vientiane, Laos, he served as Second and First Secretary from 1977 to 1979. Following his posting as First Secretary in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in 1980, he served as Acting High Commissioner in Lusaka, Zambia, from 1980 to 1983. Potts returned to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra in 1984. He held several positions through 2002. He was also an Australian Ambassador to Hanoi, Vietnam, from 1991 to 1994. Described by The Australian journalist Paul Cleary as a \\"veteran diplomat\\" with the characteristics of a \\"colonial official from a bygone era\\", Potts is credited with leading efforts to negotiate the Timor Sea Treaty, initially proposing a direct replacement for the Timor Gap Treaty and later provisions of the new treaty when the initial proposal was rejected by the new East Timorese Government. Potts was appointed Australian High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea in 2003. Potts was High Commissioner in 2005 during the \\"shoe episode\\" when hundreds of protesters demonstrated outside the High Commission in Port Moresby, with Potts and his staff inside. The protesters passed a petition to Potts through the gates of the High Commission demanding an apology from the Australian Government. In 2006, Potts was replaced by Chris Moraitis and was appointed First Assistant Secretary in the International Organisations and Legal Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, a position he held until 2009. In 2009, Potts was appointed as Australian Ambassador to Austria and as Permanent Representative, Australian Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Vienna. Shortly after his appointment, Potts was given responsibility for taking delivery of 1,200 Austrian-made off-road vehicles for the Australian Army, part of a $7.5 billion Project Overlander program to purchase 7,500 new vehicles for the Army. Potts was also responsible for Australia's relationships with a range of Eastern European countries including the Ukraine. In 2012, then-Foreign Minister of Australia Bob Carr, announced that Potts had been appointed as Australian High Commissioner to New Zealand, replacing Paul O'Sullivan (Sullivan was later appointed Chief of Staff to Australia's Attorney General). Potts was charged with managing the relationship with one of Australia's closest neighbours, and was also posted to the Cook Islands. Potts represented Australia at official functions, including the annual MƒÅori Koroneihana at T≈´rangawaewae, at the invitation of King Tuheitia. When he retired in 2016, Potts chose to remain in New Zealand.

Biography He was born and died in Parma. He is known in Parma for quadratura and elsewhere through a topographic engraving of a view in Naples.Biografia degli artisti ovvero dizionario della vita e delle opere, by F. de Boni, page 60. He was born near the church of San Lorenzo, one of the oldest in Parma. He studied painting with Francesco Maria Reti and at the age of 28 he entered the Compagnia di San Giuseppe, a confraternity particularly devoted to Saint Joseph that was founded in the church of Santa Croce. His first documented work dates back to 1668, when, on behalf of the College of Nobles, he realized the scenes and apparatuses for the baptism of Odoardo II Farnese, the first son of the Duke Ranuccio Farnese. A few years later, attention was paid to the trompe-l'≈ìil decoration of the church of Santa Cristina, which the Florentine Filippo Maria Galletti was frescoing with episodes from the life of San Gaetano da Thiene, founder of the Theatines who ran the church. The lack of funds had prevented the construction of the dome and the apse; the Baratta painted a large canvas that simulated, in a wide perspective, the cruises, the dome and the choir, creating a scenic effect that was much appreciated; the shadings were arranged so that those who entered the church could be made to believe that they were true. In 1672 he became the first regent of the Compagnia di San Giuseppe. Married to Maria Lucia, he went to live in the parish of San Paolo. In 1676 he was commissioned to restore the paintings of the church of Santa Croce and to re-fresco the vault. He also worked in the Duomo, where he painted frescoes on the ceiling and on the lunettes of the Chapel of the Living and the Dead. In 1689, when Stefano Lolli from Bologna designed the court theater next to the Farnese theater, Baratta made the design, indicating its decorations and paintings. Between 1695 and 1697 he painted the dome of the church of Santa Lucia. His last documented works are the decoration of the chapel built in Santa Maria del Quartiere behind the high altar (1694) and of four faces in the church of the Certosa di San Girolamo (1699). He also worked in Naples, where he made a burin engraving representing the southern slope of the Camaldoli hill.

His invention accelerated the development of American agriculture in the antebellum period. Early life Wood was born either in Dartmouth, Massachusetts or in Washington County, New York. His parents were John Wood and Dinah Hussey. His family was Quaker, and Wood remained Quaker throughout his life, but was not particularly doctrinaire. According to one account of Wood's childhood: > Once, while still very young, he had shaped a small plow out of metal, not > dissimilar to the model which was later to form the basis for modern > agriculture. But not satisfied with the mere making of it, and wishing to > see it in operation, he fashioned a harness of corresponding size and > fastened the family cat to his plow. The protests of the cat attracted the > immediate attention of paternal authority, and the future inventor was > soundly thrashed for his precocity. Wood spent his adult life in Cayuga County, New York, in the vicinity of Scipio. On January 1, 1793, Wood married Sylvia Howland of White Creek, New York; they had six children together. Moldboard plow \\"Facsimile of the original Wood plow\\", from an 1882 biography. Wood received a patent on an initial version of a cast-iron moldboard plow in 1814, and patented improvements on that plow in 1819. The 1819 patent was the 19th patent issued for a plow in the United States. The first patent on a cast-iron plow had been issued to Charles Newbold of New Jersey in 1793. During the development of the plow, he corresponded with Thomas Jefferson, who had been working on an improvement to the plow along slightly different lines. A test of the 1819 model showed that it could plow a stony field without breaking. It was highly successful in the eastern United States, but less effective against the clay soils and sod of the Midwest. After the invention of the plow, much of Wood's time and money were consumed by pursuing patent infringement suits against small manufacturers around the country who had copied his design. One of those suits, Ex parte Wood, reached the Supreme Court.22 U.S. 603 (1824). Wood died in poverty in 1834. He had spent his entire \\"large fortune\\" on perfecting his invention and litigating the patent, and had earned less than $550 in total from his invention. Wood's patent was renewed in 1833 by act of Congress, and his children continued to fight against infringements and campaign for changes to the patent law for some years. Legacy Wood's invention was later supplanted by the further improvements of John Deere, who furnished the plow with polished plowshares that enabled it to break up prairie sod. The Jethro Wood House, Wood's residence in Poplar Ridge, New York, was built in 1805 and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. Jack and Mary Lou Charles, the previous owners, purchased the home in 1979 and lived there until 2019. They spent many years painstakingly restoring it. They reglazed every 24-paned window with vintage glass gathered from local old structures, re-plastered the walls, and designed stencils to resemble those used on walls in the early 1800s.

Facade and dome. History The church was built on a site of a convent once occupied by the Franciscan Order outside the city walls, but demolished in 1546 by the Duke Pier Luigi Farnese. Originally the church was dedicated to Saints Gervaso and Protaso. Construction began in 1566, commissioned by Duke Ottavio Farnese and the bishop of Brugnato, and using a design by Giambattista Fornovo. By 1616, construction had stalled, part of the roof fallen in, and there was a failure to complete the planned dome. Only with the intervention of Margherita Farnese (who became a nun) did construction proceeded using an awkward, heavily buttressed dome design by Girolamo Rainaldi. The layout has a nearly elliptical interior, with two semi- circles joined by two straight lines, which join the apse, ten chapels, and an interior atrium. The convent was designed in part by Giovanni Battista Magnani, with the refectory completed in 1637 and cloister in 1688. The convent includes a large library. The convent contains the rooms and artifacts of the Blessed Lino Maupas (died 1924).Diocese of Parma , entry on church.

He was \\"arguably the world's leading missiological anthropologist.\\". Hiebert has authored numerous academic books and articles in the field of missiology and applied anthropology. Hiebert was born in India to missionary parents, and studied at Tabor College, Mennonite Brethren Biblical Seminary, and the University of Minnesota. Subsequently Hiebert went on an overseas mission to India and was Principal of the Mennonite Brethren Centenary Bible College, Shamshabad. After a period of missionary service, he proceeded to Pasadena, California where he taught at Fuller Theological Seminary before becoming Distinguished Professor of Mission and Anthropology at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. From 1974 to 1975, Hiebert lectured at Osmania University, Hyderabad, India on a Fulbright Scholarship.Directory of U.S. Fulbright Scholars 1974-1975, p.76. Hiebert developed several theories that widely influenced the study and practice of Christian missions. His model of \\"critical contextualization\\"Hiebert, Paul G. ‚ÄúCritical Contextualization.‚Äù International bulletin of missionary research 11, no. 3 (2016): 104‚Äì112. describes a process of understanding and evaluating cultural practices in light of biblical teaching.

In this way, they exclude the part in between - namely, the invisible things of this world, and in particular the unseen personal beings, such as angels and demons. Hiebert suggested that non- Westerners are much more likely to accept this \\"excluded middle\\".

Essaydi (; born 1956) is a Moroccan-born photographer known for her staged photographs of Arab women in contemporary art. She currently works in Boston, Massachusetts, and Morocco. Her current residence is in New York. Early life and education Essaydi was born in Marrakesh, Morocco in 1956. She left to attend high school in Paris at 16. She married after returning to Morocco and moved to Saudi Arabia where she had two children and divorced. Essaydi returned to Paris in the early 1990s to attend the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts. She moved to Boston in 1996 and earned her BFA from Tufts University in 1999 and her MFA in painting and photography from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in 2003. Career Essaydi's photographic series include Converging Territories (2003‚Äì2004), Les Femmes du Maroc (2005‚Äì2006), Harem (2009), Harem Revisited (2012‚Äì2013), Bullets, and Bullets Revisited (2012‚Äì2013). Her work has been exhibited around the world, including at the National Museum of African Art, and is represented in a number of collections, including the Art Institute of Chicago; the Museum F√ºnf Kontinente Munich/ Germany; the San Diego Museum of Art; the Cornell Fine Arts Museum, Winter Park, Florida; the Fries Museum in Leeuwarden, The Netherlands; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; and the Williams College Museum of Art in Williamstown, Massachusetts. She was named as #18 in Charchub's \\"Top 20 Contemporary Middle Eastern Artists in 2012-2014\\". In 2015, the San Diego Museum of Art mounted the exhibition, Lalla Essaydi: Photographs. Work Influenced by her experiences growing up in Morocco and Saudi Arabia, Essaydi explores the ways that gender and power are inscribed on Muslim women's bodies and the spaces they inhabit. She has stated that her work is autobiographical and that she was inspired by the differences she perceived in women's lives in the United States versus in Morocco, in terms of freedom and identity. She explores a wide range of perspectives, including issues of diaspora, identity, and expected location through her studio practice in Boston. She also looks at the ways of viewing reality while questioning limits of other cultures and challenging Orientalist art, engaging tradition, history, art and technology. Her Grand Odalisque from the series 'Les Femmes du Maroc' (2008), for example, cites the French painter Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres' painting La Grande Odalisque (1814), although her model is dressed. She also presents the resistance of stereotypes maintained by Western and Eastern societies. The inspiration for many of her works came from her childhood, in the physical space where she, as a young woman, was sent when she disobeyed. She stepped outside the permissible behavioral space, as defined by Moroccan culture. Several pieces of her work (including Converging Territories) combine henna, which is traditionally used to decorate the hands and feet of brides, with Arabic calligraphy, a predominantly male practice. While she uses henna to apply calligraphy to her female subjects' bodies, the words are indecipherable in an attempt to question authority and meaning. According to Essaydi, \\"Although it is calligraphy that is usually associated with 'meaning' (as opposed to 'mere' decoration), in the visual medium of my photographs, the 'veil' of henna, in fact, enhances the expressivity of the images. Yet, by the same token, the male art of calligraphy has been brought into a world of female experience from which it has traditionally been excluded.\\" The women depicted in her exhibition of photographs, Les Femmes du Maroc, are represented as decorative and confined by the art of henna. Essaydi thus poses her subjects in a way that exemplifies society's views of women as primarily destined for mere beauty. Henna, however, is extremely symbolic, especially to Moroccan women. It is an association with familial celebrations of a young girl reaching puberty and transitioning into a mature woman. The use of henna in her work creates a silent atmosphere of the women \\"speaking\\" to each other through a quality of femininity. It is predominantly a painting process where women who are discouraged to work outside the home find a profitable work in applying a tattoo-like material. Beyond creating powerful pieces revolving around the art of henna, Essaydi includes interpretations of traditional Moroccan elements, including draped folds of cloths adorning women's bodies, mosaic, tiles, and Islamic architecture. Lalla Essaydi‚Äôs photo series, Les Femmes du Moroc comments on contemporary social structures, as well as acknowledges the history that has aided in constructing representations of Arab female identity. Les Femmes du Moroc is one of her three major photographic series, which is influenced by nineteenth-century European and American Orientalist art. However, Essaydi appropriates Orientalist paintings by incorporating a new subject & style derived from her own personal history and experiences to emancipate Arabian women and to demonstrate a tradition that is misunderstood for a Western audience. The title of the series is an appropriation of a painting by the French Romantic Artist Eug√®ne Delacroix. Therefore, each photo in the series is influenced by Orientalist art that is then appropriated. Awards 2012 Medal Award, The School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (SMFA).

Barsky, the American Medical Bureau recruited doctors, dentists, nurses, administrators and ambulance drivers to support the Spanish Republic. In its fund raising events the AMB used the names 'American Medical Bureau to Save Spanish Democracy' and 'Medical Bureau & North American Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy' as well.Medical Bureau & North American Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy In the United States the AMB also staged events in order to try to shift public opinion away from supporting the aid boycott to the Spanish Republic imposed by the American government following the agreements of the Non-intervention Committee. In Spain the AMB was assigned to hospitals and medical centers of the Spanish Military Medical Services (Cuerpo de Sanidad), mainly at the G√≥mez Ulla Military Hospital in Madrid, and also to front-line locations. AMB members, who also included women, treated both international as well as Spanish combatants.Medical Aid to the Spanish Republic During the Civil War (1936-1939) Ambulance of American Medical Bureau in Spain, 1937 By the end of the war a majority of both the Spanish aid committees and the leadership councils of the AMB were women. Many women leaders in the aid movement were wives of either prominent American leftists or soldiers in the Lincoln Battalion. Katherine Duncan, wife to Governor LaFollette's secretary, and Peggy Dennis, a communist party leader, were leaders in the active Madison, Wisconsin chapter. Marion Merriman, wife to Abraham Lincoln Battalion commander Robert Merriman (the supposed inspiration of Ernest Hemingway's hero in For Whom the Bell Tolls), was the chairwoman of the large San Francisco branch of the organization. She and one other woman, Fredericka Martin, hold the honour of being the only woman to receive officer commissions from the Spanish Republic. Evelyn Hutchins, an active member of the AMB, agitated for years to be a hospital driver on the front-lines, but Spanish Republican policies prevented women from serving on the front-line until 1938 when Hutchins won the right to serve on the front-line as a driver.Graham, Helen.

Towards the 12th century the church was rebuilt and affiliated with a Vallombrosan Benedictine order monastery. It then became a convent for nuns.

It is responsible for providing drinking water across the state as well as collecting and treating sewage. It is owned by Tasmania's 29 Local Governments. TasWater commenced operations on 1 July 2013 following the merger of the three former regional Tasmanian water and sewerage corporations (Ben Lomond Water, Cradle Mountain Water and Southern Water) and the common services provider company, Onstream.  Background  Prior to 2008 Tasmania's water and sewerage infrastructure was owned by either one of the state's 29 Local Government councils or one of the three bulk water authorities; Hobart Water, Esk Water and Cradle Coast Water. In 2006 a State Government Appointed Ministerial water and Sewerage Taskforce found \\"Tasmania faced significant challenges to enable its water and sewerage infrastructure to keep pace with demand and that in many areas existing water and sewerage infrastructure was reaching capacity\\". The taskforce also noted that 33 towns had been identified with water supply problems and 58 wastewater treatment systems were operating below standards. In 2008 the State Government passed the Water and Sewerage Corporation Act 2008 as a result of a report from the Taskforce. The Act transferred council owned water and sewage assets to three new entities: Southern Water, Ben Lomond Water and Cradle Mountain Water. A fourth entity, known as Onstream, provided shared services to the corporations including payroll, billing and procurement. The state's 29 Local Government councils became joint owners of the corporations with Onstream being jointly owned by the three corporations. These changes took place in July 2009. In September 2011 the common chair of the boards of the three corporations and Onstream started talks on creating a single state wide water and sewerage corporation. In 2012 a House of Assembly Select Committee report into the issue supported the creation of a single entity. The report's executive summary found \\"after considering the evidence presented to it, the Committee accepts that a single entity will deliver material benefits to the Tasmanian community. These benefits will manifest as either, downward pressure on future price increases, better health outcomes as a result of increased investment in infrastructure, improved financial security for owner councils, or a combination of all three.\\" On July 1, 2013 the four entities were merged into the one corporation trading as Tasmanian Water and Sewerage Corporation. Controversy Since TasWater's creation, it has been accused of overspending, bureaucracy, causing spiraling water price increases and decreasing the quality of Tasmanian water. It has had ongoing disputes with unions, who have criticised it for spending over AU 1 million to hire outside consultants to investigate a staff member violently running over a duck, spending AU$280,000 to hire a recruitment agency to conduct 100 interviews, and spending $450,000 on advisers to create a new corporate structure for the company. Extensive use of outside consultants led to a number of senior employees applying for a hearing with Fair Work Australia in June 2014 leading to union negotiations that broke down in August that year. The company was criticised for a sewage spill into the South Esk River in April 2014, which it failed to inform the Northern Midlands Council of until three days after it was reported by residents and would not inform the Mayor of when the spill had started. The company was the subject of a petition by residents of Circular Head Council, requesting control of local water services be returned to the Council. The petition was handed to TasWater by local alderman upon receiving 350 signatures. Residents of Gretna presented a petition to the Premier of Tasmania in January 2015, demanding fixing of their water which had been dangerous for up to six years but degenerated even further recently. Gretna was at the time one of 21 towns in Tasmania with permanent danger warnings on their water supply. In February 2015 the state peak body for property investors, the Property Council of Australia ‚Äì Tasmania branch, launched a call for the fixing of major water quality issues by paying less dividends to councils and returning profit to the companies maintenance.

As per Constitution of India and Panchayati Raj Act, Shipur village is administrated by Sarpanch (Gram Pradhan) who is the elected representative of village. Shipur is under the administration of Sahara Gram Panchayat. Geography It is located at , 18 km from the northern side of the Bay of Bengal. Though officially Shipur is a small single village, Greater Shipur is considered as a group of seven small villages or Mouzas including Shipur. itself along with Shunia., Sinduria., Shatkania., Hatbar., Pandua. and Tahalia. =Demography= Total population of Greater Shipur is 8881 as per 2011 Census of India. Average sex ratio of Greater Shipur is 960 female per 1000 male which is higher than West Bengal state average of 950. The village has higher literacy rate compared to West Bengal. In 2011, literacy rate of Greater Shipur was 87.65% compared to 76.26% of West Bengal. In Greater Shipur Male literacy stood at 93.60% while female literacy rate was 81.45%. Most of the people here are cultivators or related to agricultural work. =Climate= There are mainly three seasons in Shipur, namely Summer, Monsoon and Winter. Summer starts in April and continues till June with a maximum temperature of 37 ¬∞C. But due to proximity of sea, cold wind keeps the weather pleasant in this time. Next comes monsoon in July and lasts till the end of September. Shipur generally experiences an average rainfall with high humidity in the monsoon season.

The Long Truss with arch covered bridge structure was built by Henry Wolf in 1907 and destroyed by the Great Flood of 1913. History The site that would later become Armiesburg had been the original crossing spot for General William Henry Harrison in 1811 on his way to the Battle of Tippecanoe. In 1812 General Samuel Hopkins would camp his army nearby. This is why it's called Armiesburg and not just Armyburg. Armiesburg was once a thriving community with a mill, stores, and population. It was the second county seat with court held there in 1827. Many flatboats were launched and passed Armiesburg carrying out of Parke County pork, grain, whiskey, lumber, and other products on their way to the South and New Orleans. A mill was built by either Abner Cox in the 1820s or Solomon Allen in 1827. John W. Underwood would later operate the mill. This first mill was built of logs with a brush dam. Later Arthur Patterson would replace it with a three-story frame structure with a log dam. James Patterson, Judge J.Y. Patterson, and J.W. Russel would go on to operate the mill in later years. In 1890 Aquilla Laverty bought and remodeled and modernized the mill. He added a stone basement, new roller mills, steam engine, and a stone dam. While trying to relocate the mill to his farm, to be used as a steam-powered mill and elevator, in late November 1896 he fell from the building and died 5 days later on December 1. The mill was never rebuilt. The County Commissioners had decided in 1852 to build a bridge at Armiesburg. When rumors of the proposed bridge began to leak county residents protested. The County Commissioners called a special meeting to discuss the bridge and found the various groups wanted bridges built at other locations throughout the county. The Commissioners decided to postpone the bridge for another year. By June 1854 the County Commissioners were able to authorize the Armiesburg Covered Bridge. They allowed $5,500 the first year with an additional $2,000 a year later, there were also $700 in public donations. Over the years it seems that Parke County's earliest bridge builder, Henry Wolf, has been confused with his son Aaron Wolf. The fact is that Aaron J. Wolf was actually born in Armiesburg in 1854 while Henry was building the bridge. Aaron would go on to be a successful sawmill operator in Waveland, Indiana and hold several Parke County offices. Surviving photos of the bridge show that it clearly did not have the Kingposts of a Burr Arch structure. This would be one of the few bridges in Parke County not use the Burr Arch style of construction. J.J. Daniels would go on to use Burr Arch construction exclusively in the bridges he would build in Parke County even though at the time the Armiesburg Bridge was built he and his father Stephen Daniels were using Colonel Long's patented Long Truss on bridges they were building in Ohio. Some of the wood used in construction of the bridge was sawn at the nearby Armiesburg Mill. Julius Egbert and Chariton Britton used a whipsaw to cut the logs. Chariton Britton would later give this saw to his son Joseph A. Britton, Parke Counties other bridge building giant.

It was released in 1954 and starring Rosa Carmina and Arturo Mart√≠nez. Plot Haunted by her past, the famous cabaret singer Sandra (Rosa Carmina) decides to get away and marries Don Miguel Olazabal (Manuel Arvide), a wealthy landowner. The impossibility of her husband to consummate their marriage causes a burning passion in Sandra, passion aroused in all men around her. Quickly she discovers that can not escape of her past, because wherever she go, life of crime who she lived in the past continue to haunt. Cast * Rosa Carmina ... Sandra * Arturo Mart√≠nez ... Malo * C√©sar del Campo ... Jorge * Manuel Arvide ... Don Miguel Olazabal Reviews In the delirant Juan Orol's tropical melodrama, the beautiful rumberas are convicted to tragic misfortunes because of men and roam in scenarios populated of wild beaches, untimely storms, swaying palms, and in this case, omnipresent orchids. The woman -here Rosa Carmina, third wife of Juan Orol - wakes burning passions among all the men around her. The Mexican Film historian Emilio Garc√≠a Riera said: \\"Orol went to Cuba to make this ineffable melodrama of tropical passions in which a narrator describes the fevers of the heroine and her impotent husband. The lush Rosa Carmina tirelessly travels between the palms of Haiti, hiding her sexual dissatisfaction in solitary beds with the open windows while listening the African drums and arouses uncontrollable passions among the laborers of her impotent husband. A clip to store in the memory: the sequence in which Rosa Carmina dance a sensual rumba to a group of laborers feverish, burly, immobilized by the \\"baroques\\" charms of the stunning rumbera.About Sandra, la mujer de fuego The story of the film seems torn from the novel El reino de este mundo, by Alejo Carpentier. The character of Sandra has certain similarities with the character of Floridor. While Floridor recites Racine parliaments to the black slaves in the plantations, Sandra moves to the beat of the drums. The film is part of the classic film saga starring by the characters created by Juan Orol. The saga began in the film El reino de los g√°ngsters (1947), and continued until M√©xico de Noche (1974). The film is succeeded by the film El Sindicato del Crimen (Antesala de la muerte) also filmed in 1954.

Martin (born 1942) is a British-born biological anthropologist who is currently an Emeritus Curator at The Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois. He is also an adjunct professor at University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and University of Illinois Chicago. His research spans the fields of anthropology, evolutionary biology and human reproductive biology.Martin, R.D. 1990. Primate Origins and Evolution. Princeton University Press.Martin, R.D. 2013. How We Do It: The Evolution and Future of Human Reproduction. Basic Books. Additionally, he writes a blog on human reproduction for Psychology Today. Early life and education Martin was born in 1942 in the United Kingdom, where he also grew up. He studied zoology at Worcester College at University of Oxford and also earned his PhD from there in 1967. His PhD project (1964-67) on the behavior and evolution of treeshrews (Tupaiidae) was based on research with Konrad Lorenz and Iren√§us Eibl-Eibesfeldt (Max-Planck-Institut, Seewiesen), supervised by Nikolaas Tinbergen (University of Oxford). Treeshrews were, at the time, widely thought to be the most primitive living primates. Through his study on their maternal behavior and later through studies of their brains, he concluded in his PhD thesis that treeshrews are not close relatives of primates.Martin, R.D. 1966. Tree shrews: Unique reproductive mechanism of systematic importance. Science\\"', 152: 1402-1404.  Career  Immediately after his PhD, Martin received a NATO postdoctoral grant (1967‚Äì69) to work with J.J. Petter and A. Petter-Rousseaux (Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Brunoy) to study the reproductive biology of mouse lemurs while continuing his work on primate morphology. Afterwards, he received a lecturer position in biological anthropology at University College London (1969‚Äì74), where he continued his research on the reproduction of mouse lemurs and comparative work on morphology of the skull, brain, postcranial skeleton and reproductive system in primates. In 1974, Martin became a senior research fellow at the Wellcome Laboratories at the Zoological Society of London, where he coordinated research on mammalian reproduction. In 1975, he spent a semester at Yale University as visiting professor in the Department of Anthropology. Martin then returned to University College London, first as reader (1978‚Äì82) and then as professor (1982‚Äì86) in biological anthropology, during which his research became focused on allometric scaling, particularly regarding the brain. In 1986, he became the director and professor of the Anthropological Institute at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, where he started a range of research activities. In 2001, Martin accepted an appointment at The Field Museum, first as vice president and then as provost for Academic Affairs while holding the position as curator in the Department of Anthropology. In 2006, he stepped down from his administrative role and became the A. Watson Armour III Curator of Biology Anthropology. He became emeritus curator at the end of 2013.  Research  Martin's research uses a wide range of approaches to identify reliable general principles in human evolution. In order to interpret human origins, he has conducted comprehensive comparisons across primates with studies that cover anatomy of both living and fossil representatives, ecology, behaviour, reproduction and molecular evolution. Throughout his research, the study of size relationships (allometric scaling or allometry) has been a prevalent theme. His synthetic approach to primate evolution has revealed a number of important relationships. This was exemplified in a study by Martin and colleagues on times of divergence in the primate tree, notably the split between humans and chimpanzees. Because of major gaps in the fossil record, estimation of divergence times from earliest known fossil relatives can be misleading. So they used statistical analyses of living and fossil primates in combination with an evolutionary tree based on DNA evidence, which revealed that divergence times within the primate tree are generally substantially earlier than has often been claimed. Specifically, the divergence between humans and chimpanzees ‚Äî which was to be around 5 million years ago ‚Äî appears to be closer to 8 million years ago.Wilkinson, R.D., Steiper, M.E., Soligo, C., Martin, R.D., Yang, Z. & Tavar√©, S. 2011. Dating primate divergences through an integrated analysis of palaeontological and molecular data. Syst. Biol. 60, 16-31. Another example is provided by the connection between brain size and reproductive biology. By examining these features together, Martin and colleagues inferred that maternal energy resources played a vital part in the evolution of the brain. The resulting \\"Maternal Energy Hypothesis\\" is particularly relevant to interpreting the evolution of the very large brain of humans.Martin, R.D. 1981. Relative brain size and metabolic rate in terrestrial vertebrates. Nature, 293, 57-60.Martin, R.D. 1996. Scaling of the mammalian brain: the maternal energy hypothesis. News Physiol.

It is the only skyscraper built within the Fort campus. As of 2014, there were about 6,000 staff at the secretariat. History The fort was built by the British rulers in 1640. After Independence, the entire complex was taken over by the Department of Defense. The state secretariat started functioning in the fort complex. The fort building is a three-storied one housing the offices of the chief minister and other ministers, the chief secretary, home ministry, treasury, etc. To accommodate the remaining offices, the then ruling DMK government planned to build a 10-storied building adjacent to the fort building. The building was built in 1975 and was named Namakkal Kavingyar Maaligai in the memory of Namakkal Kavignar V. Ramalingam Pillai. This building accommodates more than 30 departments and conference halls. Renovations In 2011, it was decided to renovate the building by augmenting the built-up area in the front and the rear. Renovation of the multi-storied building began on 3 March 2012 with the then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa laying the foundation stone for the work. The renovation work cost 280 million. The renovation features have been designed by CNR Architects, after getting the approval of Archeological Department and the Heritage Committee of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority for the renovation works. Renovation of the external facade of the building comprised traditional and modern architectural features. Main features of the renovation include power- saving lighting arrangements within the building, centralised air conditioning, measures to ensure dust-free environment, installation of glass panels to prevent penetration of heat for up to 3,540 sq.ft. a lawn measuring 1,700 sq.ft. in front of the building, and a fountain. While the renovation of the facade cost 145 million, the electrical infrastructure, including revamped centralised air-conditioning system, was completed at 135 million. A modern gym with about 29 equipments, built at a cost of 5 million, was also part of the renovation.

The film had a limited release in just three markets on February 6, 2015, with its major release over the Valentine's weekend that followed (on 224 screens). Plot Clay Walsh owns an antique shop where he repairs and restores furniture. Situated in a small Midwestern college town, he is known as a man with unusual convictions. Into his life arrives Amber, a free-spirited young woman who rents the apartment above Clay's shop. She is immediately struck by the fact that Clay is unwilling to enter the apartment to show her around. When she asks why, he tells her he has made a pledge not to be alone with a woman other than his wife. She finds this odd, all the more so when she learns he is not married. She takes the apartment and finds a job at a local shop, but is interested in knowing more about the man in the antique shop. Her efforts are complicated by the fact that Clay does not date, believing modern day dating is poor preparation for marriage. The only time he will come up to see Amber is when something in her apartment needs repair. Undaunted by the barrier, Amber creates a number of breakdowns in order to continue their conversations. Eventually Clay agrees to take her out, but the dates he takes her on are odd and unusual. Over time we learn of Amber's past. She has been in a number of relationships which were superficial and at times abusive. Her escape was always to move on to a new place. Clay's past is even more checkered. In his college days he knew a great many women, and he shot exploitation films in the manner of Girls Gone Wild. Doing this he made a great deal of money, but on realizing the pain his life was causing those around him he went through a major life change. He withdrew from the world, and confined himself to working in the antique shop. Working there over the past nine years he has become a true craftsman. In town he is known for his faith, his reserve and his odd theories on love and romance. These irritate his old friends, who find his ideas old fashioned and out of place. Few are aware of the guilt Clay is burdened with. In truth he does not date, as he does not see himself fit for anyone. Despite the unusual rules Clay has committed himself to, Amber sees a man she wants to know more about. There is some push and pull, where she asserts she would just like to do things people do on normal dates, but with time she decides it is not worth it. \\"I don't want normal\\" she tells him. \\"I want you.\\" A crisis develops, and both end up going their own way. In the wake of the separation Clay seeks out his Great Aunt Zella, who admonishes him not to let her go. She guides Clay, telling him she has never seen anyone try so hard to be good, but that life is not about failings. It is about loving those that God has brought into our lives. She encourages him to step back out into the world, and love, knowing that failure is a part of it. Clay takes her advice, and asks Amber to marry him. Before he can even get the question out she answers \\"Yes.\\" He warns her to be cautious, that it will not be easy. She simply repeats her answer \\"Yes.\\" Cast * Elizabeth Ann Roberts as Amber * Rik Swartzwelder as Clay * LeJon Woods as David * Tyler Hollinger as Brad * Nini Hadjis as Lisa * Maryann Nagel as Carol * Lindsay Heath as Trish * Joseph Bonamico as George * Dorothy Silver as Great Aunt Zella * Ange'le Perez as Cosie * Anne Marie Nestor as Kelly Development The script was written by Swartzwelder, who had been working on it for a few years already when, in 2007, he partnered with lawyer Gordon Toering (after earlier meeting at a film conference). The two formed a production company (Skoche Films), but financing was delayed by the 2007 global economic recession. Filming finally began in 2011, with additional shooting in 2012. By late 2013, the film was ready for release. Then, in early 2014, when the release date for 50 Shades of Grey was set for Valentine's Day weekend 2015, the decision was made to delay the release of Old Fashioned to coincide with that release. Analysis The film depicts a rather unconventional dating method chosen by the protagonist as a means to get away from the cultural norms he has found to be destructive. Clay is quite isolated for a young believer. Having wounded people that he loved, he is ridden with guilt, and has taken the response too far. He does not have Christian friends and does not attend a church. Commented the film's primary creative influence, Rik Swartzwelder: \\"He has isolated himself from other people, isolated himself ultimately from God even, and it started to change him in a not good way. She starts to press in on him.\\" Notes author Karee Santos: \\"In the tender and sometimes rocky romance between the main characters, we see two broken individuals helping to heal each other.\\" In an interview about the film Dr. Juli Slattery remarked: \\"They both came from a lot of poor choices. It is a story not just of romance, but of God's redemption.\\" Notes Swartzwelder: \\"I wanted to tell a love story that takes the idea of Godly romance seriously. A story that, without apology, explores the possibility of a higher standard in relationships; yet, is also fully aware of just how fragile we all are and doesn‚Äôt seek to heap guilt upon those of us that have made mistakes.\\"Toto, Christian Faith-Based Romance 'Old Fashioned' Battles 'Fifty Shades of Grey' on Valentines Day 28 July 2014 Retrieved 17 January 2019 Reception =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 19% score based on 21 reviews with an average rating of 4.36/10. Time magazine's Lily Rothman noted that the film \\"was a response to what its creators see as a culture that celebrates ideas like those in '50 Shades' but does not seem to create stable romantic relationships.\\" Michael Rechtshaffen of the Los Angeles Times found the film disturbing. Joe Leydon of Variety wrote that \\"Swartzwelder wants to engage his target audience with a tale of moral redemption through chaste romance. Trouble is, throughout a good portion of his movie, the writer-director gives off a disconcerting Norman Bates vibe\\". Karee Santos of the Catholic Match Institute wrote: \\"Amber shows Clay that love doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect to be worth it, and Clay shows Amber that respect for a woman‚Äôs body does not equal a lack of passion or a disinterest in love for the long term.\\" In a 2.5 stars out of 4 review for RogerEbert.com, Glenn Kenny said of the film: \\"It‚Äôs incredibly rare to see an American movie with a Christian perspective that‚Äôs more invested in philosophizing and empathizing than in eschatological pandering, and for that alone Old Fashioned deserves commendation.\\" =Box office= The movie was released over the Valentines' weekend of 2015, opening the same weekend as Universal's Fifty Shades of Grey. The film ended the four-day President's Day holiday weekend with a gross take of $1,083,308. The following week, the film expanded to 298 screens. The movie grossed $1,914,090 during its theatrical run. The film was released on DVD and Digital on 16 June 2015.  Music  Milan Records released the official motion picture soundtrack on February 10, 2015; it includes both songs by a variety of artists as well as several selections from the original score by Kazimir Boyle. In addition, a second soundtrack (digital only) of previously unreleased original score tracks was released by the composer via iTunes (More Music from the Motion Picture Old Fashioned).  Novel and official companion book  In December 2014, Tyndale House Publishers released both a novelization of the Old Fashioned screenplay (written by Rene Gutteridge) as well as an official companion book for the film and the novel, The Old Fashioned Way: Reclaiming the Lost Art of Romance (written by Ginger Kolbaba).

Claiming to hold a world record for speed, he is able to shoot 10 arrows in 4.9 seconds, or 3 arrows in 0.6 seconds. A private student of Otto Frello, Andersen graduated from School of Visual Art. He describes himself as a Danish painter and writer. His video posted in November 2012 has gone viral across the web. Another one of his videos, \\"A New Level of Archery\\", was posted on YouTube on 23 January 2015, receiving over 23 million views in one week, in which Andersen demonstrates how to shoot while holding multiple arrows in his draw hand and shooting while on the move, jumping, close up, far away and hanging upside-down. However, many of the historical and scientific claims made in the video have been contested or discredited, and few of the ideas have gained traction with other archers and internet personalities. In April 2015, Lars responded to the claims against him and his technique. In the video, Lars attempts to clarify his statements, some of which were in agreement with arguments against some of his original videos claims, mainly that this style was forgotten or he re-invented it, but some of them refuting the criticism against him, such as the texts he refers to in his video not including the topic of speed shooting and the archer's paradox.

In general, the model works the same: an investor provides upfront funding to the implementer of a program. An evaluator measures the results of the implementer's program. If these results hit a target set before the implementation period, an outcome payer agrees to provide investors a return on their capital. This ensures that investors are not simply engaging in concessionary lending. The first social impact bond was originated by Social Finance UK in 2010, supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, structured to reduce recidivism among inmates from Peterborough Prison. Based on the SIB model, a DIB creates a contract between private investors and donors or governments who have agreed upon a shared development goal. Investors advance fund development programmes with financial returns linked to verified development goals. In 2012, Instiglio became the first specialized intermediary founded to adapt development impact bonds and social impact bonds to the unique challenges of low and middle-income countries. In June 2014, Instiglio, Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), Educate Girls, IDinsight and UBS Optimus Foundation launched the first Development Impact Bond. The objective of the DIB is to reduce the gender gap in education in Rural India by getting girls into school and learning. UBS is providing an investment to an Indian NGO, Educate Girls. After three years, CIFF (the outcome payer) will pay based on enrollment and learning outcomes that IDinsight will evaluate in three RCTs at Years One, Two, and Three. UBS Optimus Foundation stands to receive their initial investment back plus a return on investment based on the performance of the program. A 2018 review showed that the program resulted in a 52 percent return on investment because of high achievement of the targets. In 2014, Palladium International (formerly GRM Futures Group) hosted a conference on rapidly expanding the use of DIBs in developing countries. As of August 2016, Palladium International was in the final stages of launching the Rajasthan Maternal and Newborn Health Impact Bond, with \\"two international outcome funders and a lead investor [] committed to the Impact Bond.\\" The same study noted that a significant learning was that the high transaction costs can outstrip the cost of the program itself, but that these remain constant regardless of the program size. The Center for Global Development (CG Dev) hosts a working group and has publications on DIBs.

It was set up in March 1941 and based in Cairo under Brigadier Dudley Clarke. General Archibald Wavell, the commander of forces in North Africa at the outbreak of war, initiated the use of deception as part of Operation Compass, in December 1940. After the success of Compass, Wavell sent for Clarke, with whom he had earlier worked in Palestine. Clarke was charged with forming the first deception department, in secret with limited resources. Background On 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on the Allied nations. The British Middle East Command, based in Egypt under General Archibald Wavell, fought a defensive war against Italian forces until Autumn, when it initiated more offensive manoeuvres. In November Wavell planned an offensive, Operation Compass, against Italian troops at Sidi Barrani. As part of the operation he tried to deceive the enemy about the strength of British forces; via disinformation and visual deception. Compass, executed on 9 December, was a tactical success; something Wavell attributed to the accompanying deception. On 13 December he informed Allied high command of his intention to form a department to manage deception, and requested Dudley Clarke be sent to Cairo to help. Clarke arrived in Egypt on 18 December and at first worked alone and in secret, under the official title \\"Intelligence Officer (special duties) to the Commander in Chief\\". He had neither staff nor official mandate, and worked from a \\"converted bathroom\\" at the British Army headquarters, Cairo. His cover role was to establish a regional department for MI9, the somewhat less secret organisation tasked with helping Allied servicemen in escape and evasion tactics. Far from being a token cover, Clarke ran MI9's Middle East department, in tandem with his deception work, until . 'A' Force By 1941, Clarke began to work with others, specialists in specific deception arts. Major Victor Jones was an engineer with the 14th/20th King's Hussars who had organised several tactical deceptions using dummy tanks. Mark Ogilvie-Grant was a Captain in the Scots Guards, Clarke recruited him to help with the spreading of disinformation. In Clarke began fabricating the existence of a British paratrooper regiment in the region, Operation Abeam, based on intelligence recovered the previous December. An Italian officer's journal had somehow been acquired, in it the officer expressed fear of an airborne assault. It would be two years before Allied paratroopers were deployed to North Africa, but Clarke planned to enhance these fears by creating a fictional \\"Special Air Service Brigade\\". Major Jones created a fleet of dummy gliders and Clarke organised fake radio traffic and information leaks. He even dressed two soldiers in \\"1 SAS\\" uniforms and set them to wander around Cairo, Port Said and Alexandria hinting at missions in Crete or Libya. By March, Clarke had another scheme in the works; a deception cover for Operation Cordite (the 6th Infantry Division invasion of Rhodes). His work interviewing locals about the Greek island could not be associated with the 6th so he adopted the guise of 'A' Force. The name was intentionally vague, designed to add to the mythology of his fictional airborne unit. Although at first only a cover name, the department would soon become real and take control of all deception in the region. On Clarke requisitioned , Cairo ‚Äì opposite and below a brothel ‚Äì and in April received official mandate for his department. \\"Advanced Headquarters 'A' Force\\" moved into their new offices on and Clarke began to recruit his staff. =Struggles= With 'A' Force well established Clarke felt able to leave Cairo and pursue contacts outside of Egypt. He travelled to Turkey with the dual aim of establishing an MI9 presence in the country, and developing routes for 'A' Force to pass deceptive information to the enemy. Whilst abroad 'A' Force nominally fell under the control of Victor Jones. In Clarke's absence, what he later regarded as a power struggle emerged at Middle East Command. In October, a recently promoted and rising-star Colonel Ralph Bagnold was appointed \\"Chief Deception Officer\\" for the region. Bagnold and his staff took over tactical deception, leaving 'A' Force to handle strategic planning. Upon his return to Cairo, Clarke was annoyed both at the perceived power grab and the publicity around Bagnold's promotion (Clarke having previously invested effort in keeping deception low profile). Over the next few months, however, Bagnold's department began to take control of most of the theatre's deception planning, leaving 'A' Force responsible for training and advisory capacity (although Jones retained a lot of control over physical deception). =El Alamein and Cascade= =Barclay= Legacy 'A' Force was an important step forward for Allied deception. Clarke's report in September 1941 was directly responsible for the creation of the London Controlling Section, Ops. (B) and the new focus on deceptive warfare through till the end of the war. Structure and personnel 'A' Force was an organisation under Middle Eastern Command (Cairo). The department was responsible for overseeing deception within the North African theatre. It also represented MI9 (escape and evasion) in the region, as a cover role, which accounted for a good portion of its staff. The organisation expanded quickly from its founding, and by the end of the war had quite a large staff. * Dudley Clarke; founded 'A' Force and was its head until the end of the war. * Noel Wild; recruited in 1942 as head of the Operations section, and Clarke's deputy. Wild was known for his stubbornness. Transferred to England in 1943 to head his own deception outfit (Ops (B) under SHAEF) and help plan Operation Bodyguard. * Victor Jones; recruited for his knowledge of visual deception, particularly dummy tanks etc. Jones managed physical deception for Clarke, and was even the de facto head of 'A' Force for a short period in late 1941. * Jasper Maskelyne; a well-known stage magician. Clarke deliberately portrayed Maskelyne as the mastermind behind many of the 'A' Force's dummy machines and other physical deceptions. This lent credibility to the inventions within the chain of command, and helped distract attention from many of the department activities. In fact Maskelyne worked on evasion devices and gave lectures for the MI9 side of 'A' Force. * E. Titterington; a forger who produced all of the department's fake passports and other documents. He was also tasked with opening the diplomatic bags of neutral nations so that Clarke could read their contents, before sealing them back up again. * Mark Ogilvie-Grant; helped with information warfare and MI9 cover work.

After the independence of Malaya in 1957, the building used to house the Melaka State Development Corporation (Malay: Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Melaka) until 1974 before it was moved to Ayer Keroh as its current location. The building was then transformed into the Melaka Literature Museum which was officiated by Chief Minister Mohd Zin Abdul Ghani in 1984. The museum building underwent renovation and upgrade from July 2008 until May 2009 with a cost of MYR1.7 million after Melaka was listed as UNESCO World Heritage Site on 7 July 2008. The museum was then reopened to the public on 1 August 2009. Architecture The museum building has a structural design of a residence because the underground section had the resemblance of a living room. Exhibitions The museum exhibits material pertaining to the written history of Melaka, the writings of Munsyi Abdullah and local Malay folklore. It also displays the growth of literature in Melaka from the period of the Malacca Sultanate to contemporary literary scene. The front of the museum displays a mural that depicts of evolution of writing in Malaysia from the use of stone tablets, to the introduction of Arabic script, the precursor to Jawi, ending with the modern tools of the computer and keyboard. A large section is devoted to the tale of Hang Tuah. The museum also showcases the earliest known Malay letters, dating to the 16th century, the contributions of Malay authors, and the influence of Islam on the nation's laws. Displays are done using graphical panels, exhibition boxes, audio visual and kiosk information. The museum has been criticized for marginalizing the influence of ethnic Indians and Chinese on the Malaysian literary heritage.

Background When Shelby Singleton bought the Sun label from Sam Philips in July 1969, he began reissuing albums by former Sun stars Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, Charlie Rich, and other lesser known artists. What turned out to be a goldmine for Singleton, however, were the gobs of recordings Lewis had left behind at Sun, most of which had never been released. With Lewis's return to the charts in 1968 with the country hit \\"Another Place, Another Time,\\" and with Cash reaching the pinnacle of his stardom, Singleton wasted no time flooding the market with new compilations. Retaining the original Sun logo but also employing vague themes, overdubs, and contemporary photographs of the artists, Singleton mined the archive for obscure cuts and alternate takes to create packages that became extremely successful. Singleton also leased the masters to other labels, notably Charly in England and Rhino in the United States. As the title implies, Original Golden Hits, Vol. 1 collects some of Lewis's biggest hits at Sun, including \\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On\\" and \\"Great Balls of Fire\\". The album became a top ten hit, peaking at number 8 on the Billboard country albums chart.

Life Bruno Mahlow's eponymous father (Bruno Mahlow 1899-1964) had been a founder member of the German Communist Party back in 1918, and after fifteen years as a party activist had emigrated from his Berlin home, via Prague, to Moscow two months after the Hitler government took power at the start of 1933, which is how Bruno Brunowitsch Mahlow came to be born in Moscow. By this time the elder Bruno Mahlow was a semi-invalid, having damaged his spine in a fall while escaping through Czechoslovakia. In 1937 the father was caught up in one of Stalin's purges\\\\- probably the \\"Tschistka\\" purge. and arrested, but the next year, gravely ill, he was released. In August 1941, like many Germans in Moscow at the time of the German invasion the family were banished from Moscow, initially to Astrakhan and from there, the next month, further east to Tashkent (then in the Uzbek SSR). It was in Tashkent that in 1944 Mahlow started his schooling. The Mahlows remained there till May 1947 when, following the end of the war, they were able to return to east Berlin in the Soviet occupation zone in what remained of Germany. Mahlow attended secondary school in Germany and then the Worker and Farmer College in Halle, from where, aged nearly 18, he graduated in 1955. By now the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), founded in October 1949, had replaced the Soviet military administration in this part of Germany, although the young country continued to enjoy the fraternal guidance and support of the Soviet Union. Between 1955 and 1961 Bruno Mahlow was a student at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO / –ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∏–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç –º–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã—Ö –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏–π). Back in the German Democratic Republic the controversial creation of Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands), in April 1946, more than three years before the state was formally established, had provided a firm foundation for a return to one-party government within this part of Germany: in 1957 Bruno Mahlow joined East Germany's ruling SED (party). On concluding his studies Mahlow joined the diplomatic service of the German Democratic Republic. Between 1962 and 1964 he was employed by the Foreign Ministry before being sent to Peking where he served as First Secretary in the East German embassy between 1964 and 1967. From 1967 he was employed by the Party Central Committee, becoming a deputy departmental head in August 1973 and then, during the defining months of November and December 1989, as Head of the Central Committee's International Relations Department in succession to G√ºnter Sieber. Personal contacts were important in Mahlow's career. As a child growing up in the Soviet Union his family had known fellow exile Wilhelm Pieck, who in 1949 had become the president of the German Democratic Republic. Mahlow's Soviet childhood had made him bilingual, and during the 1980s he sometimes worked as a simultaneous translator for East German leader Erich Honnecker in meetings with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. Towards the end of his time in office Brezhnev suffered a stroke, after which his meetings with foreign leaders such as Honecker included the Soviet Foreign Minister Defence Minister and KGB Chief. During a period when there was more friction in the relationship between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic than was always apparent from a western perspective, this often left Mahlow and Honnecker as the only Germans in meetings with the Soviet Union's four most powerful leaders and their translators. Bruno Mahlow's previous work at the East German embassy in Peking also made him a top government \\"China expert\\", and during a period when Sino-US rapprochement was causing unhappiness in Moscow, Mahlow found himself on the diplomatic front-line in respect of tensions between Moscow and East Berlin over East Germany's own relations with China, which were driven more by commercial opportunities and less by the geo-political considerations that were important for Soviet strategists. In May 1976 Bruno Mahlow's own name was placed on the candidates' list for membership of the Party Central Committee,Neues Deutschland 24 May 1976 and in April 1981 he became one of the 156 members of the Central CommitteeNeues Deutschland 17 April 1981 He was also, between 1981 and 1989, head of the Foreign Policy Commission of the Central Committee Politburo, taking over the post from Egon Winkelmann who had been appointed the East German ambassador to Moscow. In 1990, during the run-up to German reunification Mahlow served as a consultant to the International Affairs Commission of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), which took the place of the old East German SED (party) at this time. Bruno Mahlow was a member of the central committee of the Society for German‚ÄìSoviet Friendship between 1974 and 1989. Between 1985 and 1989 Mahlow also served as deputy president of the Society for German‚ÄìChinese Friendship. Although Mahlow has not featured prominently in public life since 1990 he remains (in 2013) a member of the Elders' Council of \\"Die Linke\\", the German political party that has inherited its mantle and at least some of its attitudes from the East German SED (party).

Silte Church was built during the 13th century and contains a number of medieval fittings as well as murals. It belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies in the Diocese of Visby. History Silte Church dates in its entirety from the 13th century. During restorative work carried out in 1971-72, the remains of a stave church was however found under the floor of the presently visible church, pre-dating the present church with around one hundred years. The oldest part of the now visible stone church is the choir, dating from the middle of the century and in an early Gothic style. The nave is only slightly later, and apparently by the same workshop, while the tower seems to have been added at the end of the century. Architecture The church is an almost unaltered medieval church. Unusually, even the window openings are original. These, as well as the portals, are decorated with stone dressings in alternating colours. The southern portal is also decorated with carved ornaments in Norse style. One of the choir windows contains some original stained glass window panes, dating from the time of the church's construction. Inside, the church is decorated with medieval murals from four different periods. The earliest date from the time of the church's construction, and are purely ornamental. On the western wall of the nave, a number of paintings from circa 1300 depict several saints: Philip, Paul, Peter, James and Bartholomew. Next to these is a mural depicting scenes from the Passion of Christ; these date from the middle of the 15th century. A final set of murals, dated 1495, adorn the southern wall of the nave. The church has two particularly noteworthy furnishings: the altarpiece and the baptismal font. The altarpiece is unique in its style on Gotland. Its outer wings are painted, and depict St. Michael, Mary and, on the back, the annunciation. These painting date from circa 1500. The central panel, by contrast, is decorated with wooden sculptures depicting the final judgement, and date from the 13th century. The baptismal font dates from the late 12th century and is thus older than the stone church. It was made by Master Sigraf, and is richly sculptured. Most other furnishings such as pews date from 1902, when a renovation was carried out. The pulpit is however from the middle of the 18th century.

Cunningham is a fictional character played by Tom Bosley on the 1970s sitcom Happy Days. Actor Harold Gould played the character in the pilot, which aired as an episode of the anthology series Love, American Style.After the pilot, \\"New Family in Town\\", was rejected by the networks, Garry Marshall liquidated it as an episode of Love, American Style to recover production costs; many failed pilots of the era were similarly salvaged. In keeping with the series's titling protocols which required each story to be called \\"Love and the _________\\", the former \\"New Family in Town\\" aired as \\"Love and the Happy Days\\". He is the husband of Marion Cunningham, and the father of Chuck, Richie, and Joanie Cunningham. Originally, Gould was supposed to reprise his role on Happy Days as Howard Cunningham but wanted to commit to something else so Bosley was offered the part. Howard is one of only two characters, the other being Fonzie, to appear in all 255 episodes of Happy Days and to remain with the rest of the cast for all 11 seasons; of the two, Howard is the only one to have also appeared in the pilot. Biography Howard Cunningham was born on September 28, 1910 (it is revealed in season 3's \\"Howard's 45th Fiasco\\" that his birthday is on Confucius's birthday; the year is 1955). In Howard's youth, Cunningham was a cook in the Army. In his later years, he became owner of a hardware store (Cunningham Hardware) while residing in Milwaukee, Wisconsin with his family. His character was written to portray Cunningham to be the stereotypical all-American 1950's father - a sage, white, Republican business owner in Middle America with traditional values. He was a member of Leopard Lodge No. 462 in Milwaukee, eventually becoming its \\"Grand Poobah\\". Trivia *He is referred to affectionately as \\"Mr. C\\" by Richie's friends, although Ralph Malph likes to call him \\"Howie\\" at times. *His favorite car is a DeSoto, which was the only car he ever owned. *He was born around 1910 because he celebrated his 45th birthday in 1955 (see \\"Howard's 45th Fiasco\\" from Season 3). *He likes to go golfing with Chachi as his caddy. *Cunningham Hardware, Howard's hardware store, was referenced in an episode of the 1986-1993 sitcom Perfect Strangers (the show that spun-off Family Matters).

He was also Clerk of the Oregon Supreme Court in Salem in the early 20th century. He is the namesake of the Eastmoreland, Westmoreland, and SellwoodMoreland neighborhoods. Early life and education Moreland was born in 1844 in Smith County, Tennessee, to parents Jesse Moreland and Susan Robertson. Julius Caesar was a name given to at least two other relatives in the Robertson family tree. Through his mother's side of the family, Moreland could trace his lineage to Major Charles Robertson, a soldier in the American Revolutionary War. Julius was the youngest of nine children, and his father was a farmer and a Methodist preacher. In 1848 the Moreland family moved to Macoupin County, Illinois, where they farmed for two years, then for two years Jesse Moreland operated a store. In 1852 the family joined a train of 20 wagons heading west on the Oregon Trail. They arrived in the Oregon Territory in October, 1852, and by November Jesse had settled a Donation Land Claim for 320 acres near the town of Needy. Beginning in 1860, Julius worked in Portland as a printer at the Oregon Farmer until the publication closed in 1863. At the time it was Oregon's only agricultural newspaper. He graduated from the Portland Academy in 1865, then from 1865 to 1867 Moreland read law in the offices of former Portland Mayor David Logan and began his legal career in Eastern Oregon and the Idaho Territory. He worked for a year at the Idaho Statesman and upon his return to Portland, he worked briefly as foreman at The Oregonian. Moreland married Abbie Kline, an 1853 pioneer from Kansas, in 1867 in Boise, Idaho. Career In 1868 Moreland formed a partnership, Caples and Moreland, with Portland attorney John F. Caples, an association that lasted until 1874. Moreland served on the Portland City Council from 1872 to 1875, and he was Portland City Attorney from 1877 to 1881. In 1885 Governor Moody appointed him judge of Multnomah County to complete an unelected term for one year, and when his term ended he formed a partnership with William York Masters, Moreland and Masters, that ended in 1890 when Moreland was elected judge of the Multnomah County Court for four years. Judge Moreland moved to Salem in 1907 to become Clerk of the Oregon Supreme Court, an appointment he would keep until his sudden death in 1918. Moreland plats in Southeast Portland Judge Moreland was an executive of the Portland Realty Company, and when the company platted Crystal Springs FarmIn the 1870s William S. Ladd purchased 721 acres of what had been the Luelling and Meeks Donation Land Claims, and Ladd started a successful cattle and chicken farm known as Crystal Springs. By the first decade of the 20th Century, the farm was impeding traffic between southeast Portland to the north and the community of Sellwood to the south. See for housing, the design included four neighborhoods: Westmoreland (1909), Eastmoreland (1910), Southmoreland, and Northmoreland.At least one property transaction occurred in Southmoreland, but none occurred in Northmoreland. By 1910 the four-neighborhood plan was replaced by a two-neighborhood design that included only Westmoreland and Eastmoreland. For the South Moreland transaction, see At the time of the Crystal Springs Addition,The original, temporary name of the Moreland tracts, see Judge Moreland was working in Salem as the Clerk of the Oregon Supreme Court, and he may have played only a minor role in the real estate developments named for him. Also, the Portland Realty Company was not the agent of the Ladd Estate Management Company which owned the property. Ladd sold the property to the public through a subsidiary known as the Columbia Trust Co. After development of the Westmoreland and Eastmoreland neighborhoods, the area surrounding the intersection of SE Milwaukie Avenue and Bybee Boulevard became known informally as Moreland.This location was the site of an arch designed by architect A. E. Doyle in 1909 that welcomed visitors to Westmoreland, see The Moreland Theater, the Moreland Presbyterian Church, and the more recent Moreland Farmers Pantry are examples of the popular evolution of the geographic names of Westmoreland and Eastmoreland. SellwoodMoreland is another designation that was not originally intended but evolved to satisfy the needs of residents.

Such hermits would be encouraged to dress like druids and remain permanently on site, where they could be fed, cared for, and consulted for advice, or viewed for entertainment. History Professor Gordon Campbell, of the University of Leicester, suggests that Francis of Paola was among the first of the trend, living as a hermit in the early 15th century in a cave on his own father's estate. He later served as a confidant and advisor to King Charles VIII. Thereafter, throughout France, estates of dukes and other lords often included small chapels or other buildings where a resident religious hermit could remain in attendance. According to Campbell, the first estate with a well- known hermitage (which included a small house, chapel and garden) was Ch√¢teau de Gaillon, renovated by Charles Cardinal de Bourbon during the 16th century. Garden hermits became popular with British aristocracy during the 18th and early 19th centuries. Contemporary accounts suggest the Weld family kept an ornamental hermit in a purpose-built hermitage on the Lulworth Estate in Dorset. Of equivalent novelty, the Welds also maintained a \\"mimic\\" fort and harbour beside an adjoining lake. Both Painshill and Hawkstone Park were said to have employed ornamental hermits. The trend continued through to the 1830s, when the idea became less popular as estate landscaping concepts evolved. Concept Even in the 18th and 19th centuries, garden hermits were novelties and eccentricities. Grottos had become more popular during the 18th century as places to withdraw for meditation, relaxation and reflection. With an increased focus on industrialism and production, contemplative garden meditation was viewed by some as an extravagance. With the lack of personal free time in combination with an increase in disposable income, the popularity of \\"natural\\" garden landscaping and the rise of neoclassical culture established an environment in which the idea of garden hermits as novelty guests became popular. In some early instances, hermits were simply represented or hinted-at, rather than personified; outside a folly or grotto, a small table and chair, reading glasses and a classical text might be placed suggesting that it was where a hermit lived. Later, suggestions of hermits were replaced with actual hermits ‚Äì men hired for the sole purpose of inhabiting a small structure and functioning as any other garden ornament. Hermits would sometimes be asked to make themselves available to guests, answering questions and providing counsel. In some cases, the hermits would not communicate with visitors, functioning instead like a perpetual stage play or live diorama. In return for their services-in-residence, hermits would generally receive a stipend in addition to room and board. In popular culture *Tony Robinson's Channel 4 television documentary show The Worst Jobs in History featured this occupation in a 2004 episode focusing on the worst jobs of the Georgian era. *Tom Stoppard's 1993 play Arcadia deals specifically with the case of an ornamental hermit, investigated by one of the main characters. *The Bee-Loud Glade, a 2011 novel by Steve Himmer, is narrated by an ornamental hermit. *Terry Pratchett had Sam Vimes discover that his wife's country estate housed an ornamental hermit in his 2011 novel Snuff.

It premiered out of competition at the 2014 Rome Film Festival. It was a box office hit, grossing over 8 million euros. It was also the most successful film starred by the comedy duo.  Plot  Salvo and Valentino are two friends who, along with Salvo‚Äôs wife Donatella and daughter Adele, are evicted from their home in Palermo. With no job prospects, the four relocate to Salvo‚Äôs hometown of Monteforte, where he is hoping for a job recommendation through a connection with a local bigwig named La Duca. In the meantime, the family relies on the economic support of the retirement benefits of Donatella‚Äôs mother. Monteforte, once a thriving town thanks to the orange trade, is now economically destitute and the pensions of its elderly citizens are now the only source of income: Salvo finds himself forced to live not only with his mother-in-law, but also with Donatella‚Äôs aunt Carmela. He only agrees to this after discovering that Aunt Carmela herself has a sizable pension. Valentino, in the meantime, reconnects with Roberta, the daughter of the superintendent of the local Carabinieri, with whom he had a relationship in his youth before leaving for Palermo. Salvo continues to reflect on the considerable number of his wife‚Äôs relatives who receive a pension, and he considers the idea of gathering them all to live together in order to get himself authorized to handle their pension withdrawals. This scheme works until some of the relatives begin to die one by one, and the other relatives, convinced that the house is cursed, begin to leave until only Aunt Lucia is left. She is in good health but of an advanced age, and Salvo must think of how to continue to profit off of her. He decides to arrange for her to marry Valentino, who is against the idea. Aunt Lucia, who has already suffered a heart attack in the past, collapses when Salvo reveals his idea to her. At the hospital, however, she tells the family that she intends to go through with the plan to pass on her pension. The news of the nuptials spreads quickly throughout the town and Valentino becomes the object of gossip of all of Monteforte. Slowly Salvo‚Äôs scheme gains popularity and the elderly women become desirable to the unemployed men of the town. The parish priest of Monteforte, Father Benedetto, tries to convince Valentino and Aunt Lucia to come to their senses and call off the wedding. The evening before the wedding, Lucia goes to the church for Mass. When it gets late, Salvo and Valentino go looking for her at the church, where they overhear her speaking with Father Benedetto: the two have loved one another for years, but the priest does not want to leave the priesthood despite his love for Lucia. Back at home, Salvo and Valentino speak with her and together they decide to go forward with the wedding. However, the next morning, the priest interrupts the ceremony, declaring his love for Lucia and showing that he has left the priesthood. Valentino is then free to go to Roberta and finally reveal to her that he is still in love with her. At the end of the film, Valentino and Salvo are waiting to be received by La Duca in order to receive his recommendation; however, they discover that he has recently died.

On 3 November 192[3?] Leune married his second wife, Germaine Berthe Emilie Foug√®res, at the townhall of the 5eme arrondissement in Paris. Jean wrote three novels during the 1920s: L'√âternel Ulysse, ou la Vie aventureuse d'un Grec d'aujourd'hui, a satirical depiction of contemporary Greek society (1923); Le Malfaisant, an allegorical story about good and evil set during World War I (1927); and Au temps des Vikings : Nora la blonde, vierge, au bouclier, a historical adventure set in Scandinavia around 1000 A.D. (1928). On 12 May 1925, as a captain in the Reserve Officers, Leune was transferred to the 34e r√©giment d‚Äôaviation au 3e groupe d‚Äôouvriers d‚Äôa√©ronautique.Journal officiel de la R√©publique fran√ßaise (Paris), 20 Mai 1925, p. 4747.

Journalist in Algeria  On the occasion of the centennial anniversary of the French colonisation of Algeria, Leune was sent to Algeria in 1930 as a correspondent for Le Temps. He stayed there for six months and travelled extensively, writing a series of articles favorable to the colony.L'Echo d'Alger : journal r√©publicain du matin (Alger), 9 avril 1930, p. 1.L'Echo d'Alger : journal r√©publicain du matin (Alger), 22 novembre 1930, p. 1.

Later that year, Leune published the book Le miracle alg√©rien, based on the articles he had written for Le Temps. In 1931, Leune published Les Ailes ardentes, a novel about aviation.  French Resistance and arrest (World War II)  In response to the German invasion of Poland, France declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, and Leune was mobilised as a Reserve Officer that same month. On 10 May 1940, Germany began its invasion of the Low Countries and France in what became known as the Battle of France. After the armistice was signed on 22 June 1940, France was divided into a German occupation zone in the north and west and a Zone Libre (Free Zone) in the south. Leune was demobilised at the end of 1940 and he remained in the Free Zone until July 1942.Base Leonore, L√©gion d'honneur file LH/1623/40 Leune continued to serve his country as a sous-lieutenant in the French Resistance.Base Leonore, L√©gion d'honneur file 19800035/621/70945 The Vichy authorities arrested him on 15 January 1943 and on 6 October 1943 they sentenced him to a year in prison and a fine of 1,200 francs for \\"actes de nature √† nuire √† la D√©fense nationale.\\" In March 1944 he was taken by the Germans and placed in detention at the Drancy internment camp, and then transferred to the Compi√®gne internment camp.

Most blamed the military for the excessive violence and human rights violations. The border town of Diffa is separated from Nigeria by the Komadougou Yobe river, a recent drop in the river's water level granted large groups of Nigerian refugees the opportunity to flee rebel controlled areas into the yet unaffected Niger. On 5 February 2015, a Nigerien parliament spokesman announced that discussions will be held regarding Niger's participation in the anti Boko Haram military operations. Raid In the morning of 6 February 2015, Boko Haram militants carried out an assault on the Nigerien towns of Bosso and Diffa, after crossing into Niger from neighboring Nigeria. The Nigerien military successfully repelled the attacks with the aid of Chadian troops that have been stationed in Bosso since 2 February, the Chadian airforce also played a supporting role in the clashes. Dozens of militants were killed as Boko Haram retreated back into its stronghold in Nigeria. Nigerien casualties amounted to 4 killed, plus several civilians as well as 17 wounded.

He then made drawings and designs for bridges on the Eastern Counties Railway under George Landmann and John Braithwaite. From about 1845, he worked on the construction of the East Lincolnshire Railway and, from 1849, on the construction of the Great Northern Railway between London and Peterborough. His designs included an aqueduct over the Regent's Canal and the viaduct at Peterborough. In 1853, he made drawings for an underground railway from Kings Cross, London to the Mansion House but the scheme did not come to fruition. From 1862 to 1863 he supervised the construction of the Bristol Port Railway. After this, he supervised the construction of the East London Railway through the Thames Tunnel. In 1872 he was appointed Southern Division Architect at the York office of the North Eastern Railway, where he remained until his death. Family life In 1847, he married Georgiana Curtis.

It has two non-touching threads parallel to the dial. Usually the second thread is orthogonal-(perpendicular) to the first. The intersection of the two threads' shadows gives the local apparent time. When the threads have the correctly calculated separation, the hour-lines on the horizontal surface are uniformly drawn. The angle between successive hour-lines is constant. The hour-lines for successive hours are 15 degrees apart. History The bifilar dial was invented in April 1922 by the mathematician and maths teacher, Hugo Michnik, from Beuthen, Upper Silesia. He studied the horizontal dial- starting on a conventional XYZ cartesian framework and building up a general projection which he states was an exceptional case of a Steiner transformation. He related the trace of the sun to conic sections and the angle on the dial-plate to the hour angle and the calculation of local apparent time, using conventional hours and the historic Italian and Babylonian hours. He refers in the paper, to a previous publication on the theory of sundials in 1914.Beitr√§ge zur Theorie der Sonnenuhren, Leipzig, 1914 His method has been applied to vertical near-declinant dials, and a more general declining- reclining dial. Work has been subsequently done by Dominique Collin.  Horizontal bifilar dial  This was the dial that Hugo Michnik invented and studied. By simplifying the general example so: :* the wires cross orthogonally- one running north-south and the other east-west :* The east west wire passes under the north south dial, so the h_2 = h_1 \\\\sin\\\\varphi\\\\quad (latitude) the shadow is thrown on a dial-plate marked out like a simple equatorial sundial. = The proof = The first wire f_1\\\\, is orientated north-south at a constant distance h_1\\\\, from the dial plate \\\\Pi\\\\, The second wire f_2\\\\, is orientated east-west at a constant distance h_2\\\\, from the dial plate \\\\Pi\\\\, (thus f_2\\\\, is orthogonal to f_1\\\\, which lies on the plane of the meridian ). In this proof \\\\varphi (pronounced phi) is the latitude of the dial plate. Respectively, (\\\\mathcal D_1) and (\\\\mathcal D_2) are the vertical projections of wires f_1\\\\, and f_2\\\\, on the dial plate \\\\Pi\\\\,. Point O\\\\, is the point on the dial plate directly under the two wires' intersection. That point is the origin of the X,Y co-ordinate system referred to below. The X-axis is the east-west line passing through the origin. The Y-axis is the north-south line passing through the origin. The positive Y direction is northward. One can show that if the position of the sun is known and determined by the spherical coordinates t_\\\\odot et \\\\delta\\\\, (pronounced t-dot and delta, respectively the known as the hour angle et declination), the co- ordinates x_I\\\\, and y_I\\\\, of point I\\\\,, the intersection on the two shadows on the dial-plate \\\\Pi\\\\, have values of : :\\\\begin{matrix} x_I &=& h_1 \\\\frac {\\\\sin t_\\\\odot}{\\\\sin\\\\varphi\\\\ \\\\operatorname{tan}\\\\delta\\\\ + \\\\ \\\\cos\\\\varphi\\\\cos t_\\\\odot} \\\\ \\\\ &\\\\ & \\\\ \\\\ y_I &=& h_2 \\\\frac{-\\\\cos\\\\varphi\\\\ \\\\operatorname{tan}\\\\delta\\\\ + \\\\ \\\\sin\\\\varphi\\\\cos t_\\\\odot}{\\\\sin\\\\varphi\\\\ \\\\operatorname{tan}\\\\delta\\\\ + \\\\ \\\\cos\\\\varphi\\\\cos t_\\\\odot} \\\\end{matrix} Eliminating the variable \\\\delta\\\\, in the two preceding equations, one obtains a new equation defined for x_I\\\\, and y_I\\\\, which gives, as a function of the latitude \\\\varphi and the solar hour angle solaire t_\\\\odot, the equation of the trace of the sun associated with the local apparent time. In its simplest form this equation is written: :\\\\frac{x_I}{y_I + h_2/\\\\operatorname{tan}\\\\varphi} = \\\\frac{h_1 \\\\sin\\\\varphi}{h_2}\\\\ \\\\operatorname{tan}t_\\\\odot This relation shows that the hour traces are indeed line segments and the meeting-point of these line segments is the point C\\\\,: :\`x_C = 0\\\\,\` :\`y_C = -h_2 / \\\\operatorname{tan}\\\\varphi\` In other words, point C is south of point O (where the wires intersect), by a distance of \`h_2 / \\\\operatorname{tan}\\\\varphi\`, where \\\\varphi is the latitude. ;Special case If one arranges the two wire heights h_2\\\\, and h_1\\\\, such : :\` h_2 = h_1 \\\\sin\\\\varphi\\\\quad \` then the equation for the hour lines can be simply written as: :\\\\frac{x_I - x_C}{y_I - y_C} = \\\\operatorname{tan}t_\\\\odot at all times, the intersection I\\\\, of the shadows on the dial plate \\\\Pi\\\\, is such that the angle \\\\widehat{OCI} is equal to the hour angle t_\\\\odot of the sun so thus represents solar time. So provided the sundial respects the la condition h_2 = h_1 \\\\sin\\\\varphi\\\\quad the trace of the sun corresponds to the hour-angle shown by lines (rays) centred on the point C\\\\, and the 13 rays that correspond to the hours 6:00, 7:00, 8:00, 9:00... 15:00, 16:00, 17:00, 18:00 are regularly spaced at a constant angle of 15¬∞, about point C. =A practical example= A London dial is the name given to dials set for 51¬∞ 30' N. A simple London bifilar dial has a dial plate with 13 line segments drawn outward from a centre-point C, with each hour's line drawn 15¬∞ clockwise from the previous hour's line. The midday line is aligned towards the north. The north-south wire is 10 cm (h_1) above the midday line. That east-west wire is placed at a height of 7.826 (h_2) centimeters- equivalent to 10cm x sin(51¬∞ 30'). This passes through C. The east-west wire crosses the north-south wire 6.275 cm north of the centre-point C- that being the equivalent of - 7.826 (h_2) divided by tan (51¬∞ 30').  Reclining-declining bifilar sundials  Whether a sundial is a bifilar, or whether it's the familiar flat-dial with a straight style (like the usual horizontal and vertical-declining sundials), making it reclining, vertical- declining, or reclining-declining is exactly the same. The declining or reclining-declining mounting is achieved in exactly the same manner, whether the dial is bifilar, or the usual straight-style flat dial. For any flat-dial, whether bifilar, or ordinary straight-style, the north celestial pole has a certain altitude, measured from the plane of the dial. # Effective latitude:If that dial-plane is horizontal, then it's a horizontal dial (bifilar, or straight-style). Then, of course the north celestial pole's altitude, measured from the dial-plane, is the latitude of the location. Well then, if the flat- dial is reclined, declined, or reclined-&-declined, everything is the same as if it the dial were horizontal, with the celestial pole's altitude, measured with respect to the dial-plane, treated as the latitude. # Dial- North:Likewise, the north celestial pole's longitude, measured with respect to the plane of the dial, with respect to the downward direction (or the direction that a marble would roll, if the dial is reclining) on the dial- face, is the direction that is treated as north, when drawing the hour-lines. I'll call that direction \\"dial-north\\". # Equatorial Longitude (hour-angle) of dial-north:It's necessary to find the equatorial longitude of the dial-north direction (drawn on the dial). In the case of the horizontal dial, of course that's an hour-angle of zero, the south meridian. That determines what time (\\"dial-north time\\") is represented by the dial-north line. Other times, before and after that, can then have their lines drawn according to their differences from dial-north time--in the same way as they' be drawn on a horizontal dial- face according to their differences from 12 noon (true solar time).

An 'Odessa People's Republic' was proclaimed by an internet group in Odessa Oblast on 16 April. Members of the Odessa anti-Maidan protest group later swore that they made no such declaration, and the leaders of the group said they had only heard about it through the media. The OSCE monitoring mission in Ukraine later confirmed that the situation in Odessa remained calm. Local anti-Maidan and pro-Euromaidan leaders in Odessa Oblast voiced scepticism about the Geneva Statement on Ukraine on 20 April. The anti-Maidan leaders insisted that they aimed not at secession, but at the establishment of a wider federated state called 'Novorossiya' within Ukraine. A hand grenade was thrown from a passing car at a joint police-Maidan self-defence checkpoint outside Odessa on 25 April, injuring seven people, and causing heightened tensions in the region. =Gallery= Odessa Russian Sring 20140413 02.JPGPro-Russian demonstration in Odessa, 13 April 2014 File:Anti-War protest, Odessa 02.jpgAnti-Russian military intervention in Ukraine demonstration in Odessa, 9 March 2014 File:Odessa Russian Sring 20140413 09.JPGPro-Russian Odesskaya Druzhina militants at the Trade Unions House encampment on 14 April File:RussianSpringOdessa20140420 08.JPGPro-Russian activists against Ukrainian symbols File:Odessa Russian Sring 20140413 08.JPGMembers of the Odesskaya druzhina File:RussianSpringOdessa20140420 02.JPGOdesskaya druzhina and a flag with Stalin File:RussianSpringOdessa20140420 11.JPGA sign that condemns members of Ukrainian military unit who opened fire on bandits who stormed their garrison at night in Mariupol 2 May city centre clashes and Trade Unions House fire On 2 May 2014, as part of the rising unrest in Ukraine in the aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, multiple clashes between pro-Maidan and anti-Maidan groups broke out in the streets of Odessa. Two pro-Maidan and four anti-Maidan activists were killed by gunfire during the clashes in the streets. These clashes culminated in a large skirmish outside the Trade Unions House, an Odessa landmark located on Kulikovo Field in the city centre. That building then caught fire in unclear circumstances, resulting in the deaths of forty-two pro-Russian activists who had holed up in it. The events were the bloodiest civil conflict in Odessa since 1918. A detailed minute-by-minute timeline of events has been compiled by \\"the 2 May Group\\", an organisation of 13 local journalists and experts investigating the tragedy on a volunteer basis. The timeline's first version is published in 2014, and an updated version in 2016. According to Guardian, most of what is known today about the tragedy is thanks to the 2 May Group investigation based on analysis of amateur footage and interviews with witnesses. =Events= A rally at 14:00 for national unity was held in Sobornaya Square by about 1,500 people, including many FC Chornomorets Odesa and FC Metalist Kharkiv fans, along with some right-wing Right Sector members, and many ordinary people. Joint marches among the sports fans are a regular tradition before all football matches in the area. As they marched down Derybasivska Street, fans of both teams sang the Ukrainian national anthem together, chanted patriotic slogans such as \\"Odessa, Kharkiv, Ukraine\\", and sang other songs against Russian President Vladimir Putin. OSCE monitors reported that they saw around one-hundred pro- unity activists in camouflage with sticks and shields participating in the march. Attendees told journalists beforehand that they had found out through social media that \\"anti-Maidan supporters were calling for everyone to gather and crush the unification march.\\" One of the pages called on their supporters in Odessa to \\"take after Donetsk,\\" a reference to pro-Russian attacks that took place against pro-Maidan demonstrators in Donetsk days prior. A leaflet that said the pro-Russian groups would \\"defend Odessa from pogroms\\" was distributed across the city before the rally. Escalation into clashes This rally was later attacked by a pro-Russian mob of 300 from the group Odesskaya Druzhina armed with bats and firearms at Hretska Street. Both sides fought running battles against each other, exchanging stones and petrol bombs, and built barricades throughout the city during the afternoon. According to OHCHR both sides had various kinds of helmets, masks, shields, axes and wooden or metal sticks, and firearms.Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine by Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/UA/HRMMUReport15June2014.pdf According to an OmTV there were mostly air pistols and the first actual firearms used was brought by an Antimaidan activist Vitaly Budko (\\"Botsman\\") who opened fire from an AK-74 rifle using 5.45 bullets. Witnesses pointed out that he was shooting from behind the police line, effectively being covered by the law enforcement operatives. The first victim was Igor Ivanov, who died from a 5.45 bullet. Some shots were fired from the roof top of the Afina shopping centre to shoot down at the crowds. Budko later left the scene in ambulance together with police commander Dmitry Fuchedzhy (Russian: –î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π –§—É—á–µ–¥–∂–∏). Afterwards the pro-Russian \\"Antimaidan\\" activists claimed that Budko was using blank rounds or, in another version, an airsoft replica. However, analysis of videos by the \\"2 May Group\\" has proven that Budko was indeed using a real AK-74 with live rounds. Fuchedzhy shortly after fled to Russia and obtained Russian citizenship, while Russian law enforcement denied any legal help to Ukrainian investigation of his role in the tragedy. Videos from the killing of Ivanov, rapidly spreading in social networks, was ‚Äì according to people interviewed by OmTV ‚Äì the tipping point in the conflict and resulted in bringing in a large number of Molotov cocktails, further airguns and hunting rifles to the conflict. Four anti-Maidan activists died from firearms shortly after on Hretska Ploshcha: Evgeniy Losinsky, Alexandr Zhulkov, Nikolai Yavorskiy ‚Äì from hunting bullets, and Gennadiy Petrov ‚Äì from 5.6 bullets. Trade Unions House fire A view of the Trade Unions House, on 273x273px As soon as word spread about the attack by pro-Russian demonstrators, a call by pro-Maidan demonstrators to go to Kulikovo Field and destroy the anti- Maidan camp emerged on social networks. As a result, the pro-Russian crowd was later overwhelmed by the pro-Maidan demonstrators, and their encampment outside the Trade Unions House building was torched. This forced the pro- Russian activists to enter that building, and occupy it. The building is five storeys tall, and is the headquarters of the Odessa regional federation of trade unions. It is located on Kulikovo Field, in the city centre. Reports about the precise sequence of events that followed vary between different sources, including several confirmed fake reports being spread through social networks. While defending the building, militants on the roof tossed rocks and petrol bombs at the protesters below. A report by the Ukrainian Independent Information Agency (UNIAN) said that the pro-Maidan crowd began to throw petrol bombs into the building after having been fired upon by the pro-Russian group. BBC News said that the situation was unclear, with multiple sources indicating that both sides had been throwing petrol bombs at each other. One eyewitness told the BBC that the fire started on the third floor when a petrol bomb was thrown at a closed window from inside the building, and the Kyiv Post reported that several flaming bottles held by Ukrainian unity activists outside were thrown into the front entrance, and through the windows on the second and fourth floors. An official investigation conducted by the Ukrainian Interior Ministry stated that while no firearms were found inside the building, those on the roof were shooting at the crowd below, and accidentally set the building on fire whilst throwing petrol bombs from above. One of the pro-Maidan protesters who was shot (non-fatally) by a sniper from the trade unions building was Andrey Krasilnikov, a Russian citizen and Euromaidan activist. Russia Today disputed this report, saying that the fire was started intentionally by \\"pro-Kiev radicals\\", and that those who died were \\"anti- government activists.\\" 273x273px Regardless of who started the fire, it is known that it started on the second and third floors of the building, and quickly spread. Firefighters were slow to respond, arriving an hour after the fire began. Thirteen units of fire and rescue apparatus were sent to the scene, but were prevented from operating because of the large number of people gathered around the building. Fifty pro-Russian activists remained on the roof, barricading themselves in and refusing to leave, while others were seen attempting to jump out of the windows. Some of those who tried to escape the fire were set upon and beaten during their attempts to flee by some Ukrainian unity demonstrators, while other demonstrators saved several dozen people in rooms on the second and third floor. Some outside the building chanted \\"burn Colorads, burn,\\" referring to a derogatory term for pro-Russian activists who wear the Ribbon of Saint George. Local pro-Maidan unity protesters said that no one in Odessa's pro-Maidan movement knew the people that were seen chanting such slogans outside the burning building. Casualties The official list of people killed during the event is still kept secret by the Ukrainian authorities. Unofficially, the names of all victims have been established by journalists and published by local media: Dumskaya and Timer. According to UN OHCHR report, 42 people died in a fire that erupted in the House of Trade Unions: 32 from carbon monoxide poisoning, and 10 after leaping from windows to escape the flames. These were 34 men, seven women and a 17-year-old boy, all of them - either anti-Maidan supporters or people who happened to be at the site of the incident. Six people were killed earlier the same day from firearms at Hretska Square: four anti-Maidan and two Euromaidan supporters. In total, 48 people died in one day as a result of the clashes. Hospital staff reported that 174 were injured, and 25 were in critical condition. 172 people were reported arrested as a result of the conflict, and 38 anti-Maidan activists were detained by police after they had been evacuated from the burning building; most of them were badly injured. On the day of the event there appeared rumors that of those who died in the fire, fifteen were Russian citizens, and five were from Transnistria. The Interior Ministry debunked these rumors since the identity of most of the victims had not been determined on the 2nd of May. Later reports showed that none of the identified victims was from Russia or Transnistria.–û–ø–æ–∑–Ω–∞–Ω—ã –≤–æ—Å–µ–º—å –ø–æ–≥–∏–±—à–∏—Ö –≤ –î–æ–º–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ—Å–æ—é–∑–æ–≤ –≤ –û–¥–µ—Å—Å–µ ‚Äì –≤—Å–µ –æ–¥–µ—Å—Å–∏—Ç—ã, Interfax-Ukraine, 3 May 2014 language=Russian Out of the 48 people killed, 46 were from Odessa or Odessa region, one from Mykolaiv Oblast and one from Vinnytsia. Aftermath A memorial to those who died in the clashes at a barricade made of tyres in Donetsk The city of Odessa announced that three days of mourning would be held in honour of those who lost their lives in the clashes. Ukrainian interim President Oleksandr Turchynov followed suit, declaring two days of national mourning for those who died in the clashes, also those who died during a government counter-offensive in Donetsk Oblast. Both pro-Russian and pro-Maidan demonstrators gathered outside the burnt Trade Unions House on the day after the clashes. Roughly 2,000 pro-Russian protesters gathered outside, chanting: \\"Odessa is a Russian city.\\" There was a heavy police presence, and some minor scuffles between protesters. In another outbreak of unrest, the Interior Ministry's headquarters in Odessa was attacked by several hundred pro-Russian activists on 4 May. Originally a protest, the events later turned violent when masked demonstrators with improvised weapons started breaking windows, and forcing gates open. In an attempt to pacify the protesters, the officials inside the building released between 30 and 67 of those arrested in the aftermath of the clashes. Elsewhere in the city, supporters of federalisation attacked a Ukrainian reporter for Channel 5 news. A rally of several hundred pro-Maidan activists marched to the site of the fire, raised the Ukrainian flag from the central flagpole, and observed a moment of silence for the victims. In response to the conflict, Odessa governor Nemirovsky announced the formation of a 'territorial defence battalion' of the army and would be recruiting to quickly restore order in the region. May 7, 2014 Nemirovsky accused Alexandr Dubovoy of organization of Odessa clashes. In July, the court ordered Nemirovsky to refute this false report. =Investigation= Investigators are probing four theories: an order to extremist groups to destabilise the situation in Ukraine; unlawful activity by Odessa regional authorities and police aimed at discrediting the current central government; unchecked actions by football fans and pro-Russia groups; and a provocation by radical individuals. As of May 2017, the official investigation is still in progress and criticized by Ukrainian human-rights groups and international bodies for lack of progress and failure to investigate key evidence. At least one case has been taken to European Court of Human Rights by a mother whose son has died in the clashes. UN Human Rights office states in its 2016 report: \\"criminal prosecutions ... appear to have been initiated in a partial fashion. Only activists from the 'pro-federalism' camp have been prosecuted so far, while the majority of victims were supporters of 'pro-federalism' movement... The investigations into the violence have been affected by systemic institutional deficiencies and characterized by procedural irregularities, which appear to indicate an unwillingness to genuinely investigate and prosecute those responsible.\\" Pro-Maidan activist Sergei Khodiak is officially accused of murder, but he is not under arrest. He was released after two days in custody due to the pressure of other Euromaidan activists on the court. Although the pre-trial investigation was completed in August 2015, the trial has not yet started (as of May 2016). None of Euromaidan activists was under arrest as of March 2016, and May 2017. At the same time, around dozen of anti- Maidan supporters have been held in custody for at least two years. Some of them launched a hunger strike. An anti-Maidan activist Igor Astakhov died after two years in custody from a heart failure. Three years after the events, five anti-Maidan supporters remain in custody. Those who set fire to the House of Trade Unions have not been identified. A Euromaidan activist Vsevolod Goncharevskii is accused in beating people who jumped out of the windows of the House of Trade Unions. He was detained in August 2014, but the court decided to release him one month later. In 2015 the court resumed investigation against him, but in October 2016 Goncharevskii was still free and participated in military operations against separatists. In September 2017, the Chornomorsk town court of Odessa Oblast concluded that all 19 people accused of participation in the clashes on Hrteska ploshcha, are not guilty. The court criticized the prosecution for being biased against the anti-Maidan activists and for low quality of investigation. Five anti-Maidan activists who had remained in custody for 3.5 years, were ordered to be released. However, two of them were immediately arrested again by SBU on new charges related to a peaceful anti-Maidan motor rally in March 2014. Pressure on the Courts The court is under severe pressure, e.g. on Nov 27, 2015, the Malynovskyi District Court of Odessa granted release on bail to five anti-Maidan detainees. In response, around 50 Right Sector and other Euromaidan activists blocked the detention facility searching all vehicles for the detainees to be released, they pressured the prosecution to appeal, blocked the judge of the Court of Appeals of Odesa Region in his office, urging him to grant the appeal, and forced the judges of the Malynovskyi District Court to resign. In a few days, the decision to release the detainees was cancelled, in violation of procedural law. On 10 March 2016, 'anti-Maidan' accused have been attacked by Euromaidan activists near the court building leading to hospitalization one of them. According to OHCHR, up to 50 aggressive Euromaidan activists can be observed in the courtroom with police being unable to protect those involved in the proceedings. Two district courts of Odessa refused to consider the case because judges were intimidated. UN OHCHR reported in 2018 about the lack of progress in investigations into harassment of and pressure on judges dealing with the mass disorder cases by Euromaidan activists, despite the identification of some alleged perpetrators by victims or witnesses. Chloroform Then-presidential candidate Petro Poroshenko told journalists about a closed session of parliament where evidence was presented that \\"toxic substances\\" had been placed in the Trade Unions House to facilitate an increased death toll, and that the events were organised in advance by Russian and local officials. Amid the ingoing investigation, Ukraine's deputy Interior Minister and Chief Investigator Vitaliy Sakal told journalists on 19 May that traces of chloroform had been found in the building, and that thirty-two deaths in the building were attributed to the inhalation of an as yet unidentified substance. Sakal added that the mixture containing chloroform had been in the Trade Unions building for several days. Sakal said that an investigation to determine the substance's origin was ongoing, and that Ukrainian investigators have urged the Israeli Embassy to provide skilled professionals to assist Ukrainian specialists in this regard. Russian nationals The day after the fire, the Interior Ministry released a statement saying that 172 people had been arrested. They said that the meticulous preparation of the unrest in the town was evident from the fact that the majority of the detainees who had been identified at the time were Russian nationals and residents of Transnistria. Police confiscated firearms and a significant amount of incendiary mixture during the arrests. That same day Vitaly Yarema, First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, said there were foreigners among both the participants of mass riots and the victims in Odessa. According to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the clashes that took place involved the participation of 'illegal military groups' and mercenaries coordinated in Transnistria by subversive groups from Russia, and financed by former members of the Yanukovych government. Named were former Prime Minister Serhiy Arbuzov and former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Klymenko. \\"Subversion in the Ukrainian city of Odessa that was financed by former top officials targeted at disrupting stability in the south of Ukraine,\\" said Kateryna Kosareva, SBU press spokeswoman. \\"Its organizers were planning that it would be the beginning of full scale instability in the rest of the southern regions of our country.\\" The Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVS) announced that among the conflict organizers it had detained, at least three were citizens of the Russian Federation. Among them were named Evgeny Mefedov, from Yoshkar-Ola; Andrei Krasilnikov, from Nizhny Novgorod; and Alexander Zolotashko. The SBU then identified other Russian citizens arrested: Boris Demylov; Sergei Pavlov; Alexander Vdovin; Sergei Sidorenko; and Dmitri Bormotov, from Evenk Autonomous Okrug. As of May 2016, two Russian nationals, Mefedov and Sakauov, have remained in custody for 2 years despite the prosecution failed to provide sufficient evidence against them. According to the United Nations OHCHR, the prosecution failed to ensure the presence of witnesses and, after a year of hearings, requested to recuse the panel of judges. Both citizens of the Russian Federation launched a hunger strike. The panel of judges notified the General Prosecutor of Ukraine several times about the low quality of the prosecution and reprimanded the prosecution for delaying the proceedings. In September 2017, the Chornomorsk town court declared that both Russian citizens, Mefedov and Sakauov (as well as 17 other accused), are not guilty and ordered their immediate release. The court concluded that the presented evidence was untenable, and the prosecution was biased against the anti-Maidan activists. After the judgement was pronounced, SBU immediately re-arrested Mefedov (along with a Ukrainian citizen Dolzhenkov) in the courtroom, on charges of ‚Äútrespass against the territorial integrity of Ukraine‚Äù. Involvement Governor of Odessa Oblast Volodymyr Nemyrovsky stated on 2 May 2014 that the conflict could have been avoided had police fulfilled their duties, and accused police of inciting the confrontation and taking bribes to switch allegiance to the separatists' side. Several police were seen donning the red armbands worn by pro-Russian rioters. The leadership of the local police was then fired and may face criminal charges. Arsen Avakov, the interior minister, blamed local politicians for the events. People suspected of complicity include city council members, elections workers, police, relatives of former police officers, and active anti-Maidan campaigners. Twelve people were arrested, but their names were not disclosed. \\"The police in Odessa acted outrageously, possibly in a criminal fashion,\\" Interior Minister Avakov stated. \\"The 'honor of the uniform' will offer no cover.\\" He then announced the formation of a new civilian-based special police force named \\"Kiev-1\\" to help police the city. =Reactions= ‚Äì \\"We believe that a full and impartial investigation, which is being conducted by law enforcement agencies of Ukraine, will enable us to find not only the perpetrators of the tragedy, but also their puppeteers and sponsors both in Ukraine and in Russia,\\" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. \\"That which we saw in Odessa was a [Russian] Federal Security Service provocation to deflect attention from the anti-terrorist operation [in eastern Ukraine]\\" said acting presidential chief of staff Serhiy Pashynsky. \\"They [the FSB] want to show that situation [in the country] is not stable, but what happened in Odessa showed something else, that the people's patience has run out.\\" Pashynsky also stated that the FSB armed pro-Russian militants in Odessa. Acting president Turchynov said Russian special forces were working with success to destabilise Ukraine, helped by \\"guest stars from Transnistria.\\" ‚Äì Russia's Foreign Ministry said that the fire was \\"yet another manifestation of the criminal irresponsibility of the Kiev authorities who indulge insolent radical nationalists ‚Ä¶ which are engaging in a campaign of physical terror\\", against those wanting 'greater autonomy' living in Russian-speaking regions. Russian Duma member Leonid Slutsky compared this accident to a nazi-crime, like Khatyn massacre. ;Other countries ‚Äì Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kristian Vigenin condemned the Odessa clashes \\"in the strongest possible terms\\" and expressed condolences to the victims' families. He urged the Ukrainian government to \\"abide by its obligations to disarm paramilitaries...limit the influence of far-right groups\\" and all parties to refrain from further provocations. ‚Äì President Alexander Lukashenko said during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin \\"The developments in Odessa are simply unimaginable. I would like to have a frank discussion, behind the scenes, so to speak, about the situation in Ukraine and to coordinate our actions, because clearly, this crisis is not going to end tomorrow, and it has a direct impact on you and on us.\\" ‚Äì President of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan said \\"Nevertheless, we are deeply concerned by the growth of violence in Ukraine, including the events in Odessa, Slavyansk, Kramatorsk and other regions. We cannot but worry about the current situation also because there are more than half a million Armenians living in Ukraine.\\" ‚Äì US State Department: \\"The United States today mourns with all Ukrainians the heartbreaking loss of life in Odessa. Today the international community must stand together in support of the Ukrainian people as they cope with this tragedy\\". ‚Äì Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, said the latest incidents were \\"very deeply concerning\\" and accused President Vladimir Putin of starting a \\"slow-motion invasion\\" of Ukraine. =Gallery= File:Odessa Russian Spring 2014040607.JPGPro-Russian encampment outside the Trade Unions House File:RussianSpringOdessa20140510 07.JPGMemorial service in honour of those who died in the clashes, outside the burnt Trade Unions House on 10 May 2014 File:Odessa may 2014 01.jpgThe memorial at the place of death of Andriy Biriykov, killed in the clashes Further events About sixty people gathered on Kulikovo Field to commemorate the 2 May fire on 13 July. The demonstration was peaceful. Another demonstration on the field on the same day drew about 120 people. They chanted \\"Donbass, we are with you\\", in reference to the ongoing War in Donbass. Odessa city mayor Hennadiy Trukhanov told OSCE monitors on 23 July that the \\"underlying tensions\\" of the 2 May clashes remained in the city, and that he feared for the city's security.

The southwest corner built by Louis Jacobi in 1885 with merlons at the wider and thus correct intervals, had to be replaced during the full reconstruction, probably at the behest of Emperor William II, with merlons spaced at the medieval interval, which is thus wrong.Dietwulf Baatz: Die Saalburg ‚Äì ein Limeskastell 80 Jahre nach der Rekonstruktion.

Roman tower (reconstruction) - Ober-M√∂rlen / Taunus (Section 4) The term limes (plural: limites) originally meant \\"border path\\" or \\"swathe\\" in Latin. In Germany, \\"Limes\\" usually refers to the Rhaetian Limes and Upper Germanic Limes, collectively referred to as the Limes Germanicus. Both sections of limes are named after the adjacent Roman provinces of Raetia (Rhaetia) and Germania Superior (Upper Germania). In the Roman limites we have, for the first time in European history, clearly defined territorial borders of a sovereign state that were visible on the ground to friend and foe alike. Most of the Upper German-Rhaetian Limes did not follow rivers or mountain ranges, which would have formed natural boundaries for the Roman Empire. It includes the longest land border in the European section of the limes, interrupted for only a few kilometres, by a section that follows the River Main between Gro√ükrotzenburg and Miltenberg. By contrast, elsewhere in Europe, the limes is largely defined by the rivers Rhine (Lower Germanic Limes) and Danube (Danube Limes).  Function  The function of the Roman military frontiers has been increasingly discussed for some time. The latest research tends to view at least the Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes not as a primarily military demarcation line, but rather a monitored economic boundary for the non-Roman lands. The limes, it is argued, was not really suitable for fending off systematic external attacks. Thanks to a skillful economic policy, the Roman Empire extended its influence far to the northeast, beyond the frontier. Evidence of this are the many border crossings which, although guarded by Roman soldiers, would have enabled a brisk trade, and the numerous Roman finds in \\"Free Germania\\" (as far as Jutland and Scandinavia). Attempts were occasionally also made, to settle Roman legions beyond the limes or, more often, to recruit auxiliaries. As a result, the Romanization of the population extended beyond the limes. Limes Gate at Dalkingen (WP 12/81), which was built in five phases of expansion Mahdholz)  Research history  A map of the County of Hanau by Friedrich Zollmann in 1728 gives one of the earliest depictions of the limes, described as Reliquiae munimenti Romani sive Lineae adversos Germanos erectae, hodieque Der Pfalgraben, Pfolgraben vel Polgraben dictae Interest in the limes as the remains of a site dating to the Roman period was rekindled in Germany at the time of the Renaissance and Renaissance humanism. This was bolstered by the rediscovery of the Germania and Annales of Tacitus in monastic libraries in the 15th and early 16th centuries. Scholars like Simon Studion (1543-1605) researched inscriptions and discovered forts. Studion led archaeological excavations of the Roman camp of Benningen am Neckar on the Neckar section of the Neckar-Odenwald Limes. Local limes commissions were established but were confined to small areas, for example, in the Grand Duchy of Hesse or Grand Duchy of Baden, due to the political situation. Johann Alexander D√∂derlein was the first person to record the course of the limes in the Eichst√§tt region. In 1723, he was the first to interpret the meaning of the limes correctlyWei√üenburg stiftet eigenen Kulturpreis, published in 1986, retrieved 22 June 2016Bernhard Overbeck: Johann Alexander D√∂derlein (1675‚Äì1745) und die ‚Äûvaterl√§ndische‚Äú Numismatik, Brunswick, 2012, pp.147-165 and published the first scholarly treatise about it in 1731. = Imperial Limes Commission = Only after the foundation of the German Empire could archaeologists begin to study more precisely the route of the limes, about which there had previously only been a rudimentary knowledge. As a result, they were able to make the first systematic excavations in the second half of the 19th century. In 1892, the Imperial Limes Commission (RLK) was established for this purpose in Berlin, under the direction of the ancient historian, Theodor Mommsen. The work of this commission is considered pioneering for reworking of Roman provincial history. Especially productive were the first ten years of research, which worked out the course of the Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes and named the camps along the border. The research reports on the excavations were published from 1894 to the dissolution of the Commission in 1937. The individual reports went under the title of The Upper Rhaetian Limes of the Roman Empire (ORL), which was published in fifteen volumes, of which seven cover the route of the limes and eight cover the various camps and forts. The documents of the Imperial Limes Commission are now in the custody of the Roman-Germanic Commission of the German Archaeological Institute. The RLK numbered the sections of the route, the forts and the watchtowers (Wp) on the individual sections. = Sections = In the course of this work the 550-kilometre-long route of the limes was surveyed, divided into sections and described.

Her first poems appeared in the journal Maatstaf in 1988 while her first collection Soldatenliederen (Soldiers' Songs) was published in 1991 while she was still working as a psychoanalyst. In 1992 she received the C. Buddingh'-prijs for her debut poetry collection. Thereafter she devoted most of her time to literature. On the poetry front, she published six more collections: Jachtsc√®nes (Hunting Scenes; 1992), Een nieuw afscheid (A New Goodbye; 1994), De tweede helft (The Second Half; 2000), Hier was vuur (Here Was Fire; 2002), De tussentijd (The Interval; 2004) and Nieuws van nergens (News from Nowhere; 2010). They have all been published in one volume as Gedichten 1991-2012. Enquist's first prose works, Het meesterstuk (The Masterpiece, 1995) and Het geheim (The Secret, 1997), are psychological novels in which classical music plays an important part. In 2002, she reached a wide readership with De ijsdragers (The Ice Carriers) which was distributed as a free gift during the Dutch Book Week in 2002. Her acclaimed historical novel De thuiskomst (The Homecoming, 2005) is centred on Elizabeth Batts, the wife of the British explorer James Cook. In 2008, she published Contrapunt (Counterpoint) about a pianist studying Bach's Goldberg Variations and remembering her deceased daughter. This moving novel is based on the author's tragic experience of losing her own 27-year-old daughter Margit in a biking accident in Amsterdam in 2001. In 2005 Enquist received the Taalunie Toneelschrijfprijs together with Antoine Uitdehaag and Anne Vegter for their play Struisvogels op de Coolsingel. Psychological and relationship issues, the loss of a child or children, painful memories, the challenges of ageing as well as her love of classical music are themes not only of Counterpoint, but also of her 2014 novel Kwartet (Quartet).

It was originally built in the early 19th century as St George's Chapel, the first Roman Catholic chapel open for public worship in Taunton since the Reformation. The building, which forms the end of a terrace, features a series of prominent Ionic pilasters along the front and southern end. Opened in 1822, St George's Chapel served Taunton's growing Catholic community for over 35 years, before they moved to a larger church which was completed in 1860. After being rented out for a time, when it was known as St George's Hall, the building was then sold in 1878 to a company acting on behalf of a group of Freemasons, who purchased it to provide a home for the Unanimity & Sincerity Lodge. It now hosts nine different Lodges of the Freemasons. History =Catholic chapel= Prior to the Reformation, Taunton had three Catholic churches; the Church of St Peter and St Paul, which was part of Taunton Priory, and was destroyed during the Dissolution; and the Churches of St Mary Magdalene and St James, which both became Anglican. The Roman Catholic Church all but died in Taunton; one book records that prior to the 19th century, \\"there were no Papists in Taunton\\". In 1787, a Mission Rector was sent to Taunton. Four years later, Catholic chapels were legalised, and the rector registered a chapel in a house on Canon Street. Upon his death in 1818, a new rector was appointed; Rev. Samuel Fisher. The new rector immediately began raising money for a permanent church, which was opened on 3 July 1822. The building was located on The Crescent, and was dedicated to Saint George. The church seated 200; greater than the estimated 120 Catholic resident in Taunton. This new church, known as St George's Chapel, was the first public Roman Catholic church in Taunton since the Reformation. Within 35 years, the congregation had swelled, and St George's Chapel was no longer large enough to serve the Catholics of Taunton. The nearby Franciscan Convent purchased a plot of land adjacent to their own in 1858, and St George's Church was opened in April 1860, to replace the chapel of the same dedication. =Masonic Hall= The chapel building was subsequently let out for various uses, and known as \\"St George's Hall\\". In 1878, the hall was purchased by members of the Unanimity & Sincerity Lodge of the Freemasons, and named the Masonic Hall; it was consecrated by Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, the Provincial Grand Master of Somerset Freemasons in January the following year. The Unanimity & Sincerity Lodge had originally met in Ilminster after their constitution in 1788, and moved to Taunton in 1797, meeting at the London Inn. The owners of the building, though members of the Freemasons had purchased the property as a limited company, and also rented the building to other users: Richard Huish's School taught their girl's classes from there, and the cellars were used by a wine merchant. After purchasing the building, the Masonic Hall Company, in addition to the necessary decorating, also commissioned a builder, William Templemen to carry out a number of structural changes; the lobby was split into three rooms, to provide a \\"robing chamber\\" on one side, and a small waiting room on the other. Beyond the large main hall, what had been the vestry had a temporary partition removed, and a toilet added. The staircase down to the kitchen was moved, and in the kitchen itself a cooking range was installed. In the mid-1880s, an extension was made to the hall by the same builder; a two-storey building, of which the ground floor served as a warehouse. The extension replaced a previous building that had been deemed \\"unfit for repair\\". The extension was completed at a cost of ¬£337 and 10 shillings, slightly more than the initial estimate. By 1892, the hall was no longer being used by the school, now known as Bishop Fox's, for their girl's lessons. Further renovations were carried out around that time at a cost of just over ¬£180. The hall continued to be let out for various social functions, and is currently home to nine lodges of the Freemasons; Unanimity & Sincerity Lodge, Lodge of St George, Taunton Deane Lodge, Queens College Lodge, Old Aluredian Lodge, Taunton School Lodge, Richard Huish Lodge, Vivary Lodge and the Emergency Services Lodge. Architecture The Masonic Hall sits at the southern end of a terrace. It has a stucco front, with two pairs of Ionic pilasters; the larger ones frame the building, and appear to support an overhanging cornice with a decorative dentil finish. The smaller pilasters are either side of a large doorway, and are topped by a pediment. The double wooden doors have six panels, and are fronted by six steps which are almost the same width as the building. On the southern side of the building, more Ionic pilasters rise the height of the building, spread between four large windows. The hall is designated by Historic England as a Grade II* listed building, and is considered to form a group with Numbers 1‚Äì11 and 15‚Äì20 The Crescent, which are both similarly Grade II* listed, and with the Grade II listed properties; 21 and 22 The Crescent, Somerset County Club, Dragon Book Shop and Number 14 Bath Place.

The E.K.Lincoln Studio was built in 1915 in Grantwood on Bergen Boulevard and was owned and operated by E.K. Lincoln, who was both an actor and movie maker. Many in the early film world worked out of this studio and used various spots in the area for location work. The first production was The Fighting Chance in which Lincoln starred alongside Violet Horner (who also starred in The Girl from Alaska). Between 1916 and 1917, the studio was rented by Fox Film. In 1920 the United States Photoplay Corporation used it for the film Determination. In 1923, Peter Jones produced the film How High Is Up?.Koszarski, Richard. Fort Lee: The Film Town .

After World War I many movie makers, including Lincoln, headed out to Hollywood where the climate enable them to film outdoors all year round. After talkies came into being in 1927, the studio continued to be used to make Italian and Polish language films. By the end of the Depression, the studio was no longer for film production.

A 1941 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, ranking first in his class, Moody served as a staff officer with the Operations Division (OPD) of the War Department General Staff, in the China- Burma-India Theater, and with Central Pacific Base Command and the 7th Infantry Division on Okinawa. After duty as the Military Assistant to Robert McNamara, the Secretary of Defense, he learned to fly helicopters, and he was appointed the Assistant Division Commander of the 1st Cavalry Division. Just a week after he arrived in South Vietnam, he died of a heart attack. Early life Alfred Judson Force Moody was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on 4 March 1918, the son of Ilna Force and Wilfred Hamilton Moody. He had a sister, Ilna. He joined the Army and was posted to Fort H. G. Wright, and then to the area prep school at Fort Preble, Maine. He was accepted into the United States Military Academy at West Point, which he entered on 1 July 1937. The West Point Yearbook noted that he \\"came to West Point from the Army with a determination to do his best in whatever he attempted. We can see from his record that his best was exceptional.\\" Moody was ranked first in his class, which graduated and was commissioned as second lieutenants on 1 July 1941. Traditionally, the highest ranked graduates in the class joined the United States Army Corps of Engineers, but Moody chose to join the cavalry instead. He married Jean Enwright, whom he had known since childhood. They had four daughters, all with names starting with the letter J: Judith, Jean, Joan, and Joy. World War II On 1 August 1941, he assumed command of a platoon in Troop F, 14th Cavalry at Fort Riley, Kansas. He attended the United States Army Cavalry School from 3 October to 23 December 1941, shortly after the United States entered World War II, and was a platoon commander in Troop E, 6th Cavalry from 20 January to 15 May 1942. He returned to West Point as an instructor in Chemical and Electrical Engineering, where he was promoted to first lieutenant on 15 June 1942, captain on 15 December 1942, and major on 4 January 1944. In May 1944, Moody was posted to the European Theater of Operations, where he served on the staff of SHAEF until 14 September 1944. He then returned to the United States, where he saw duty in Washington, D.C., with the Operations Division (OPD) of the War Department General Staff and in the China-Burma-India Theater. After attending the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from 8 January to 6 March 1945, he was posted to the Cavalry Replacement Training Center at Fort Riley, and then, on 9 July 1945, to the staff of the Central Pacific Base Command on Okinawa. On 15 August 1945, he became Assistant Chief of Staff (G-3) of the 7th Infantry Division, then also based on Okinawa, but which subsequently participated in the United States occupation of Korea after the war ended. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 15 March 1946, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for his services. Later life Moody's appointment as a lieutenant colonel in the Army of the United States was terminated on 31 May 1946, and he reverted to his substantive rank of first lieutenant in the cavalry. He became an instructor at Fort Knox, Kentucky, on 14 June 1947, and became a captain again on 1 July 1948. He attended Yale University, where he earned a Master of Arts degree in international relations in 1950. He was then posted back to The Pentagon for duty in the Office of the Chief of Staff of the Army. This was followed by a posting to the headquarters of the United States European Command in Paris, and then a tour as a tank battalion commander in Germany. In due course he returned to Fort Carson, Colorado. After graduating from the United States Army War College, he returned to the Office of the Chief of Staff of the Army, and then was posted to Korea, where he commanded a brigade. The tour of command in Korea was cut short, and Moody returned to the United States for duty as the Military Assistant to Robert McNamara, the Secretary of Defense. He was promoted to brigadier general in July 1966. After learning how to fly helicopters at Fort Rucker, Alabama, he was appointed the Assistant Division Commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, then engaged in combat in Vietnam during the Vietnam War in March 1967. Moody took up his new posting at the Camp Radcliff, in An Khe, Vietnam, but on 19 March 1967, just a week after he arrived, he said he was not feeling well, and asked for a doctor to be sent to his quarters. He died of a heart attack shortly after the doctor arrived. He was survived by his father, and his wife and four daughters. His body was returned to the United States, and he was buried in Arlington National Cemetery on 24 March 1967 with full military honors. His name was subsequently inscribed on the wall of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC. His decorations included the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with two oak leaf clusters, the Bronze Star Medal, the Air Medal with six oak leaf clusters, Army Commendation Medal, and the Purple Heart.

Together with the rest of the extended family at that time in Finland, they awaited developments until it was clear that there was little hope to return to Russia. They made their way to Paris and France in late 1919. Meanwhile, Esper Konstantinovich's oldest son Konstantin Esperovich, a freshly promoted 18-year-old ensign of the Horse Guards, was with his detachment in Kiev. He was murdered there on 28 January 1918 by a Red Guardist sailor who shot him in the back of the head, in connection with the first revolutionary and nationalistic waves of fighting in Kiev, where Russian imperial officers were targeted by all.

Transportation by Rail Lagos Rail Mass Transit is a system being developed and under construction in Lagos, Nigeria. The system (the first modern rail- based public transport in Sub-Saharan Africa outside of South Africa) is being sponsored by the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA) and is envisioned to consist eventually of seven lines. The railway equipment including electric power, signalling, rolling stock, and fare collection equipment will be provided by the private sector under a Concession Contract. LAMATA is responsible for policy direction, regulation, and infrastructure for the network. The concessionaire will generate its own dedicated electricity. The first section of the network (Phase I of the Blue Line) was scheduled to enter revenue service by the first quarter of 2014, but had not yet opened as of September 2014, amid delays. = Timeline = { - ! 2008 ‚Äì  A metro is proposed for Lagos, allegedly with a completion date of 2011. - ! 2009 ‚Äì  Construction commences on the Blue Line. - ! 2010 ‚Äì  Lagos Rail Mass Transit to proceed. - ! 2014 ‚Äì  Phase I (the Blue Line from Marina to Okokomaiko) set to open in the first quarter of 2014. } =History= The Lagos tramway ran from 1902 to 1933. The passenger line was one of the earliest public transport system built within Lagos, carrying travelers, traders and workers from the train station at Iddo going to Lagos Island. The idea of developing rapid transit in Lagos dates from the 1980s with the Lagos Metroline network conceived by the Alhaji Lateef Jakande during the Second Nigerian Republic. The initial Metroline project was scrapped in 1985 by Muhammadu Buhari at a loss of over $78 million to the Lagos tax payers. The idea of developing a light rail network for Lagos was revived by Governor Bola Tinubu in the early 2000s with a formal announcement of its construction in December 2003. This initial $135 million proposal was part of the greater Lagos Urban Transportation Project to be implemented by the newly formed Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA). LAMATA initially concentrated on developing a Bus Rapid Transit system, running from Mile 12 to Lagos Island. In 2008, LAMATA began also to make progress with the rail project, focusing initially on the Blue Line and the Red Line. =Rolling stock= In September 2011, LAMATA announced that it would acquire some H5-series subway trains formerly used by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The cars are being refurbished in the United States and converted to standard gauge before being imported and put into service on the Blue and Red lines. The same contract also included an option for some H6-series subway cars from the TTC, however this has since been cancelled. The trains were built as two-unit married pairs with a driver's cab in the front right corner of each car. =Routes= Okokomaiko-Marina Blue Line In April 2008, the Lagos State Government approved ‚Ç¶ 70 billion for construction of the Okokomaiko- Iddo-Marina Line, with an estimated completion date of 2011. Advisory services are being provided by CPCS Transcom Limited, an Infrastructure Development consulting firm based in Ottawa, Canada. Construction actually commenced in January 2010, and completion is now expected in 2015. The Blue Line is now being built by China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation. The Blue Line will run 27.5 km from Marina to Okokomaiko, with 13 stations. End-to-end journey time will be approximately 35 minutes. It is being built as a high capacity, electrically powered rail mass transit system. Most of the route will be on the surface, running east-west, in the central reservation of the rebuilt Badagry Expressway between Igbo-Elerin Road (Okokomaiko) and Iganmu. The line will run on elevated structure from Iganmu along the south side of the expressway passing the junction with Eric Moore Road, crossing just south of the National Theatre to Iddo, then south to Lagos Island with a terminal at Marina. Construction is underway between National Theatre and Mile 2. A Maintenance and Storage Facility (MSF) will be constructed at Okokomaiko, with a track connection from the Blue Line to the depot. The entire Blue Line will operate over a secure and exclusive right-of-way, with no level crossings and no uncontrolled access by pedestrians or vehicles. Lagos State is financing construction of the Blue Line from its own resources. A concession contract is being awarded to finance, supply and operate the railway equipment, including electric power, signalling, trains, and fare collection. Agbado-Marina Red Line The second line, the Red Line, will run from Marina to Agbado. The line will share the existing 30 metre wide Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) right-of-way. Other lines LAMATA has long term plans to build up to seven lines.

The Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World distinguishes Nea Aule from Philadelphia (Ala≈üehir), saying only that it was in the same region and was also called Theodosiopolis. History Nea Aule was founded in Roman times. A bishop of Nea Aule named Philippus was at the Council of Chalcedon in 451. In the Greek manuscripts of the acts of the council, he is given simply as of Nea Aule. The Latin manuscripts add that Nea Aule was also known as Theodosiopolis.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 709-710 This identification is accepted by the Barrington Atlas.

Etymology The specific name, fionni, is in honor of someone called \\"Fionn\\", the identity of whom Procter never revealed.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Ctenophorus fionni, p. 90). Description Adults of C. fionni have a total length (including tail) of . Females range in colour from brown to reddish-brown, with dark mottling. Males tend to have grey backs, brown heads and a multitude of white, cream and yellow-orange spots. The patterns and colours of males can vary drastically between different geographically isolated populations, with each isolated population having its own unique colour/pattern combination.Wilson, S., Swan, G. (2013) A Complete Guide to Reptiles of Australia, New Holland Publishers, Sydney, New South Wales, Ecology and behaviour The peninsula dragon is native to the rocky areas of Arcoona. It spend basks on rocks, and retreats to rock crevices for shelter. It is fast and agile, and will immediately dash to safety in between rocks when threatened. Peninsula dragons communicate through body posture, body movement, and color display, and these communications are most likely to be displayed during breeding seasons. Reproduction The breeding season of C. fionni starts at around spring, when the weather is beginning to warm up. Males in this time of year become very active, showing dominance and fighting for females. Females are known to lay up to 6 eggs, typically during spring and summer depending on the location and conditions. Diet The peninsula dragon is an omnivore, meaning that it feeds on a diet of both meat, in this case insects, and vegetation. The peninsula dragon's diet comprises approximately 70% insects and 30% vegetation. Threats Threats to C. fionni include habitat loss, car roads, and introduced species.

AKCM-321-01) AKSM-321 (Russian no.) AKSM-321 (Serbian no.) ACSM-321 (Russia number:AKSM-321 or –ê–ö–°–ú-321 ) is a Belarusian large capacity low-floor trolleybus for intercity passenger transportation, mass-produced since 2003. It belongs to the third generation of trolleybuses developed by the Belkommunmash plant in Minsk. This model of trolleybus is used in many cities of Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Moldova, Transnistria and Serbia. Of the vehicles operated in Minsk, 33% are model 321. In Moscow it is 11%.  Description  =Body= Trolleybus model 321 is a two axle low- floor large capacity city bus. The vehicle has a load-bearing structure. Covering the roof and sides are high-strength galvanized steel sheets. The tube frame, the skin of the body, the underside of the vehicle, the surface of the frame, axles, and some other elements are processed with anti-corrosive enamel by French company RM. The body is also covered with a phosphate-based paint, which protects it from corrosion. The body has a life of not less than 10 years. The front of the bus is made of fiberglass panels. The bumpers (front and rear) are made of steel and lined with a fiberglass shell. The bumper consists of three parts. In 2008, model 321 underwent restyling and the headlights were replaced with lighting equipment uniform with new models of MAZ trucks, made in the city of Minsk. The windshield of the ACSM-321 is a panoramic type. The wipers are horizontal (installed under each other). Most ACSM-321 trolleybuses are equipped with three electronic indicator boards, one front, one rear and one on the right side. Manufacturers include \\"Integral\\", \\"MEMZ\\", \\"AGIT\\", \\"Selena\\" and \\"TEES\\". The side mirrors are of a spherical type, equipped with anti-reflection coating and electric heating. =Electrical equipment= The motor compartment of the bus is placed in its rear overhang on the left side. The ACSM-321 can be equipped with different motors: DC-BM Russian manufacture, DC (power 170 kW), asynchronous Czech ≈†koda (with a capacity of 185 kW), asynchronous Belarusian production ANT-155 (with a capacity of 185 kW) and asynchronous motors of the Russian production DTA-U (capacity of 180 kW) and ACCD-250 (150 kW). The buses are equipped with axles from European manufacturers such as R√°ba or ZF. The buses are equipped with a pneumatic system for remote removal of the poles from the wires of the contact network. In addition, there is a manual system using ropes and drums. For powering low voltage circuits, there is a static converter that converts an input voltage of 550 volts to 28 volts. The low-voltage power circuits use two 12-volt batteries. It is also possible to install traction batteries for stand-alone travel. =Suspension and brakes= The ACSM-321 is equipped with air suspension, front and rear. In addition to providing softness, this enables the floor to be lowered at bus stops to facilitate the entry of persons with disabilities and passengers with prams. Brakes on the front wheels are disk (when using ZF axles) or drum (when using R√°ba axles). In addition, the bus is equipped with an anti-lock braking system (ABS). =Interior= There are three doors of the swivel-sliding type, similar to those in the MAZ-103 bus. The 2011 version has doors similar to those in the MAZ-203 bus. In most trolleybuses (except those designed for the cities of Moscow, Chisinau and Balti) the front half of the front door is allocated to the entry and exit of the driver from the cabin. The bus has a low level floor at all the entrances, and the floor height is 36 inches above ground level. Also there is a folding ramp at the entrance to the middle door. The interior floor is of bakelized plywood with a thickness of 12 millimeters (0.5 inch), which is attached to the base body. The ceiling is made of plastic in gray and white colors. The handrails are made of thin steel pipe, painted with polymer paint, which improves their resistance to corrosion, mechanical wear and sunlight. The bottom rails are attached to the floor and the top rails to the ceiling. Vertical rails can be equipped with buttons to signal the driver to stop the bus on demand. Horizontal rails can be equipped with leather handles for added convenience. In 2011, the design of handrails and glass partitions was changed to match the bus MAZ-203. The saloon has 26 seats and the full capacity of the bus is 115 (or 101, in accordance with the requirements of the UNECE). Ventilation is by a large sliding window. There are no roof hatches because of the layout of electrical equipment on the roof. It is possible to install air conditioning for the driver and for the passenger compartment. The heating system in the passenger compartment is represented by three coils, two of four kilowatts and one of six kilowatts. The driver's cab has an electric heater with a capacity of six kilowatts. =Controls= The dashboard of the bus is made in the form of semicircles, which provide the driver with quick access to all necessary controls. In the middle of the instrument panel is a block of exemplary devices. In the middle panel is a large round speedometer (German, VDO) with electronic odometer. Left and right of the speedometer are the gauges and indicator voltage on-board network. In some trolleybuses these devices are replaced by an electronic display. From 2011, a new panel, similar in form to the trolleybus model 420, is used. To the right and left of the exemplary devices are keys for opening and closing the doors, turning on the alarm, and controlling the direction of movement of the bus. To the left of the driver is an additional side panel, on which is placed the hand brake lever, similar to a joystick control system. Other controls on the left side of the instrument panel house the control keys for heating and ventilation, and for internal and external lighting.

Solvent models enable simulations and thermodynamic calculations applicable to reactions and processes which take place in solution. These include biological, chemical and environmental processes. Such calculations can lead to new predictions about the physical processes occurring by improved understanding. Solvent models have been extensively tested and reviewed in scientific literature. The various models can generally be divided into two classes, explicit and implicit models, all of which have their own advantages and disadvantages. Implicit models are generally computationally efficient and can provide a reasonable description of the solvent behavior, but fail to account for the local fluctuations in solvent density around a solute molecule. The density fluctuation behavior is due to solvent ordering around a solute and is particularly prevalent when one is considering water as the solvent. Explicit models are often less computationally economical, but can provide a physical spatially resolved description of the solvent. However, many of these explicit models are computationally demanding and can fail to reproduce some experimental results, often due to certain fitting methods and parametrization. Hybrid methodologies are another option. These methods incorporate aspects of implicit and explicit aiming to minimize computational cost while retaining at least some spatial resolution of the solvent. These methods can require more experience to use them correctly and often contain post-calculation correction terms.  Implicit models  Implicit solvents or continuum solvents, are models in which one accepts the assumption that implicit solvent molecules can be replaced by a homogeneously polarizable medium as long as this medium, to a good approximation, gives equivalent properties. No explicit solvent molecules are present and so explicit solvent coordinates are not given. Continuum models consider thermally averaged and usually isotropic solvents, which is why only a small number of parameters can be used to represent the solvent with reasonable accuracy in many situations. The main parameter is the dielectric constant (Œµ), this is often supplemented with further parameters, for example solvent surface tension. The dielectric constant is the value responsible for defining the degree of polarizability of the solvent. Generally speaking, for implicit solvents, a calculation proceeds by encapsulating a solute in a tiled cavity (See the figure below). The cavity containing the solute is embedded in homogeneously polarizable continuum describing the solvent. The solute's charge distribution meets the continuous dielectric field at the surface of the cavity and polarizes the surrounding medium, which causes a change in the polarization on the solute. This defines the reaction potential, a response to the change in polarization. This recursive reaction potential is then iterated to self-consistency. Continuum models have widespread use, including use in force field methods and quantum chemical situations. In quantum chemistry, where charge distributions come from ab initio methods (Hartree-Fock (HF), Post-HF and density functional theory (DFT)) the implicit solvent models represent the solvent as a perturbation to the solute Hamiltonian. In general, mathematically, these approaches can be thought of in the following way: : \\\\hat{H}^\\\\mathrm{total}(r_\\\\mathrm{m}) = \\\\hat{H}^\\\\mathrm{molecule} (r_\\\\mathrm{m}) + \\\\hat{V}^\\\\text{molecule + solvent} (r_\\\\mathrm{m}) Polarize continuum model cavity image - created using Geomview and Gaussian Note here that the implicit nature of the solvent is shown mathematically in the equation above, as the equation is only dependent on solute molecule coordinates (r_\\\\mathrm{m}) . The second right hand term \\\\hat{V}^\\\\text{molecules + solvent} is composed of interaction operators. These interaction operators calculate the systems responses as a result of going from a gaseous infinitely separated system to one in a continuum solution. If one is therefore modelling a reaction this process is akin to modelling the reaction in the gas phase and providing a perturbation to the Hamiltonian in this reaction. : Q(m)= Q_\\\\mathrm{cavity} + Q_\\\\mathrm{electrostatic} + Q_\\\\mathrm{dispersion} + Q_\\\\mathrm{repulsion} : G = G_\\\\mathrm{cavity} + G_\\\\mathrm{electrostatic} + G_\\\\mathrm{dispersion} + G_\\\\mathrm{repulsion} + G_\\\\text{thermal motion} Top: Four interaction operators generally considered in the continuum solvation models. Bottom: Five contributing Gibbs energy terms from continuum solvation models. The interaction operators have a clear meaning and are physically well defined. 1st - cavity creation; a term accounting for the energy spent to build a cavity in the solvent of suitable size and shape as to house the solute. Physically, this is energy cost of compressing the solvents structure when creating a void in the solvent. 2nd term - electrostatic energy; This term deals with the polarization of the solute and solvent. 3rd term - an approximation for the quantum mechanical exchange repulsion; given the implicit solvent this term can only be approximated against high level theoretical calculations. 4th term - quantum mechanical dispersion energy; can be approximated using an averaging procedure for the solvent charge distribution. These models can make useful contributions when the solvent being modelled can be modelled by a single function i.e. it is not varying significantly from the bulk. They can also be a useful way to include approximate solvent effects where the solvent is not an active constituent in the reaction or process. Additionally, if computer resources are limited, considerable computational resources can be saved by evoking the implicit solvent approximation instead of explicit solvent molecules. Implicit solvent models have been applied to model the solvent in computational investigations of reactions and to predict hydration Gibbs energy (ŒîhydG). Several standard models exist and have all been used successfully in a number of situations. The Polarizable continuum model (PCM) is a commonly used implicit model and has seeded the birth of several variants. The model is based on the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, which is an expansion of the original Poisson's equation. Solvation Models (SMx) and the Solvation Model based on Density (SMD) have also seen wide spread use. SMx models (where x is an alphanumeric label to show the version) are based on the generalized Born equation. This is an approximation of Poisson's equation suitable for arbitrary cavity shapes. The SMD model solves the Poisson- Boltzmann equation analogously to PCM, but does so using a set of specifically parametrised radii which construct the cavity. The COSMO solvation model is another popular implicit solvation model. This model uses the scaled conductor boundary condition, which is a fast and robust approximation to the exact dielectric equations and reduces the outlying charge errors as compared to PCM. The approximations lead to a root mean square deviation in the order of 0.07 kcal/mol to the exact solutions.  Explicit models  Explicit solvent models treat explicitly (i.e. the coordinates and usually at least some of the molecular degrees of freedom are included) the solvent molecules. This is a more intuitively realistic picture in which there are direct, specific solvent interactions with a solute, in contrast to continuum models. These models generally occur in the application of molecular mechanics (MM) and dynamics (MD) or Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, although some quantum chemical calculations do use solvent clusters. Molecular dynamics simulations allow scientists to study the time evolution of a chemical system in discrete time intervals. These simulations often utilize molecular mechanics force fields which are generally empirical, parametrized functions which can efficiently calculate the properties and motions of large system., Parametrization is often to a higher level theory or experimental data. MC simulations allow one to explore the potential energy surface of a system by perturbing the system and calculating the energy after the perturbation. Prior criteria are defined to aid the algorithm in deciding whether to accept the newly perturbed system or not. Explicit solvent snap shot In general, force field methods are based on similar energy evaluation functionals which usually contain terms representing the bond stretching, angle bending, torsions and terms for repulsion and dispersion, such as the Buckingham potential or Lennard-Jones potential. Commonly used solvents, such as water, often have idealized models generated. These idealized models allow one to reduce the degrees of freedom which are to be evaluated in the energy calculation without a significant loss in the overall accuracy; although this can lead certain models becoming useful only in specific circumstances. Models such as TIPXP (where X is an integer suggesting the number of sites used for energy evaluation) and the simple point charge model (SPC) of water have been used extensively. A typical model of this kind uses a fixed number of sites (often three for water), on each site is placed a parametrized point charge and repulsion and dispersion parameter. These models are commonly geometrically constrained with aspects of the geometry fixed such as the bond length or angles. Some recent advancements in explicit solvent modelling are the new generation of polarizable force fields, which are currently being created. These force fields are able to account for changes in the molecular charge distribution. A number of these force fields are being developed to utilise multipole moments, as opposed to point charges, given that multipole moments can reflect the charge anisotropy of the molecules. One such method is the Atomic Multipole Optimised Energetics for Biomolecular Applications (AMOEBA) force field. This method has been used to study the solvation dynamics of ions. Other emerging polarizable forcefields which have been applied to condensed phase systems are; the Sum of Interactions between Fragments ab initio computed (SIBFA) and the Quantum Chemical Topology Force Field (QCTFF). Polarizable water models are also being produced. The so-called charge on spring (COS) model gives water models with the ability to polarize due to one of the interaction sites being flexible (on spring).  Hybrid models  Hybrid models, as then name suggests, are in the middle between explicit and implicit models. Hybrid models can usually be considered closer to one or other implicit or explicit. Mixed quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics models,(QM/MM) schemes, can be thought of in this context. QM/MM methods here are closer to explicit models. One can imagine having a QM core treatment containing the solute and may be a small number of explicit solvent molecules. The second layer could then comprise MM water molecules, with a final third layer of implicit solvent representing the bulk. The Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM) can be thought of being closer to implicit solvent representations. RISM allows the solvent density to fluctuate in a local environment, achieving a description of the solvent shell behaviour. QM/MM methods enable a section of the system to be calculated using quantum mechanics, for example the active site in a biological molecule, whilst the rest of the system is modeled using MM force fields. By continuing to a third layer with an implicit solvent the bulk water effect can be modeled more cheaply than using all explicit solvent molecules. There are many different combinations that can be used with the QM/MM technique. Alternatively, a few explicit solvent molecules can be added to a QM region and the rest of the solvent treated implicitly. Previous work has shown mixed results upon the addition of explicit solvent molecules to an implicit solvent. One example added up to three explicit water molecules to a QM calculation with an implicit COSMO water model. The results suggest that using either implicit or explicit solvent alone provide a good approximation to experiment, however, the mixed models had mixed results and possibly some dependence on the number of added explicit solvent molecules. a RISM solvent field RISM, a classical statistical mechanics methodology, has it roots in the integral equation theory of liquids (IET). By statistically modeling of the solvent, an appreciation of the dynamics of the system can be acquired. This is more useful than a static model as the dynamics of the solvent can be important in some processes. The statistical modeling is done using radial distribution function (RDF). RDF are probabilistic functions which can represent the probability of locating solvent atoms/molecules in a specific area or at a specific distance from the reference point; generally taken as the solute molecule. As the probability of locating solvent atoms and molecules from the reference point can be determined in RISM theory, solvent shell structure can be directly derived. The molecular Ornstein-Zernike equation (MOZ) is the starting point for RISM calculations. Within the MOZ equations a solvated system can be defined in 3D space by three spatial coordinates (r) and three angles (Œò). Using relative RDF's the MOZ equations for the solvated system can define the total correlation function h(r - r'; ò -  ò'). The equations have a high dimensionality (6D). :h(r - r^{'} ; \\\\Theta - \\\\Theta^{'}) = g(r - r^{'} ; \\\\Theta - \\\\Theta^{'}) -1 :h(r ; \\\\Theta) is the total correlation function, g(r ; \\\\Theta) is the radial distribution function accounting for the direct effects of one molecule on another separated by r. It is a common approximation to assume spherical symmetry, allowing one to remove the orientational (angular) degrees of freedom. The MOZ equation splits the total correlation function in two. First the direct correlation function c(r), concerned with the effect of one particle on one other over the distance r. The second, the indirect correlation function, accounts for the effects of a third particle in a system. The indirect correlation function is given as the direct correlation function between the first and the third particles c(r_{1,3}) in addition to the total correlation function between the second and third particles h(r_{2,3}). :h(r) = c(r_{1,2}) + \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}r_{3} \\\\, c(r_{1,3}) \\\\rho (r_{3}) h(r_{2,3}) Ornstein-Zernike equation with the assumption of spherical symmetry. œÅ is the liquid density, r is the separating distance, h(r) is the total correlation function, c(r) is the direct correlation function. h(r) and c(r) are the solutions to the MOZ equations. In order to solve for h(r) and c(r), another equation must be introduced. This new equation is called a closure relation. The exact closure relation is unknown, due to the so-called bridge functions exact form being unclear, we, therefore, must introduce approximations. There are several valid approximations, the first was the HyperNetted Chain (HNC), which sets the unknown terms in the closure relation to zero. Although appearing crude the HNC has been generally quite successfully applied, although it shows slow convergence and divergent behaviour in some cases. A modern alternative closure relation has been suggested the Partially Linearised HyperNetted Chain (PLHNC) or Kovalenko Hirata closure. The PLHNC partially linearises the exponential function if it exceeds its cutoff value. This causes a much more reliable convergence of the equations. : h_{\\\\alpha}(r) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\beta U(r) + T(r)}-1 & (\\\\text{when} -\\\\beta \\\\upsilon_{a}(r) + h_{a}(r) - c_{a}(r) \\\\leq 0)\\\\ -\\\\beta U(r) + T(r) & (\\\\text{when} -\\\\beta \\\\upsilon_{a}(r) + h_{a}(r) - c_{a}(r) > 0) \\\\end{cases} The PLHNC closure, where \\\\beta = \\\\frac{1}{k_{B}T} and U(r) is the interaction potential, a typical interaction potential is shown below. T(r) is the indirect correlation function, as it is the difference of the total and the direct correlation functions. : U(r) = 4\\\\epsilon \\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{1}}{r_{12}}\\\\right)^{12} - \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{2}}{r_{12}}\\\\right)^{6}\\\\right] + \\\\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{r_{12}} There are various approximations of the RISM equations. Two popular approximations are 3D RISM and 1D RISM. There are known deficiencies in these approximate RISM models. 3D RISM makes a poor estimation of the cavity creation term. 1D RISM has been found to not be properly accounting for the spatial correlations of the solvent density around the solute. However, both methods are quick to calculate, 1D RISM can be calculated in a matter of seconds on a modern computer, making it an attractive model for high through put computation. Both 3D RISM and 1D RISM have had correction schemes proposed which make the predictions reach a comparable level of accuracy to traditional implicit and explicit models. The COSMO-RS model is another hybrid model using the surface polarization charge density derived from continuum COSMO calculations to estimate the interaction energies with neighbored molecules. COSMO-RS is able to account for a major part of reorientation and strong directional interactions like hydrogen bonding within the first solvation shell. It yields thermodynamically consistent mixture thermodynamics and is often used in addition to UNIFAC in chemical engineering applications.  Applications to QSAR and QSPR  Quantitative Structure‚ÄìActivity Relationships (QSAR)/Quantitative Structure‚ÄìProperty Relationships (QSPR), whilst unable to directly model the physical process occurring in a condensed solvent phase, can provide useful predictions of solvent and solvation properties and activities; such as the solubility of a solute. These methods come in a varied way from simple regression models to sophisticated machine learning methods. Generally, QSAR/QSPR methods require descriptors; these come in many different forms and are used to represent physical features and properties of a system of interest. Descriptors are generally single numerical values which hold some information about a physical property. A regression model or statistical learning model is then applied to find a correlation between the descriptor(s) and the property of interest. Once trained on some known data these model can be applied to similar unknown data to make predictions. Typically the known data comes from experimental measurement, although there is no reason why similar methods can not be used to correlate descriptor(s) with theoretical or predicted values. It is currently debated whether if more accurate experimental data was used to train these models whether the prediction from such models would be more accurate.

The beach is one of eleven beaches located within the territory of the Royal National Park. The northernmost major beach in the Royal National Park, Marley is considered by Surf Life Saving Australia as the most hazardous unpatrolled beach in the park, and both surfing and swimming are not advised by both SLSA and the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service. One of the largest beaches in the Sydney metropolitan area, Marley is also notable for the expansive sand dunes that lie behind the beach, which take up over 130,000 square meters. History Both Marley Beach and Little Marley Beach are remnants of a large chain of beaches that existed along the northern coast of the Royal National Park around 7000 years ago, with sand dunes that were as high as the cliffs that exist today. Sand dunes still exist to the north of Marley, near other famous landmarks in the region such as Wedding Cake Rock and the Bundeena Lookout. On 16 May 1919, a steam powered collier, the S.S. Tuggerah, ran into a violent storm, and capsized around 2 kilometers off the coast near Marley Beach. Six crew, including the ship's captain, died while eleven survivors rowed a lifeboat to Port Hacking. The shipwreck, rediscovered in 1972, has since become one of the more popular diving spots off the Sydney coastline, though, due to the depth of the dive (75 metres), experience is recommended for people wanting to attempt a dive. Overview Marley Beach is a southeast-facing beach, approximately 360m in length. Neither swimming nor surfing is advised, with hazards including topographical rips, bluebottle and shark sightings. Rock platforms occupy the southern end of the beach, which has been used by many as a fishing spot. Behind the beach exists an extensive system of sand dunes, occupying over 130,000 square meters. While not as big as the Cronulla sand dunes, the area is still comparable to that of Sydney Cove. Lagoons and channels, running off from Marley Lagoon, run through the sand dunes, acting as a popular swimming spot, alternative to the Marley Beach surf. While the landscape and water flow of the dunes change constantly over time, there is usually a consistent body of water about 150 meters from the shore.

The northern castle, the Lesser Saru (), is mostly in ruins. The southern castle, the Greater Saru (), or simply the Saru Castle (), is the main one and is relatively intact. It is 100 m higher than the Lesser Saru. The Greater Saru has triple defensive outer walls and an unusual double-bend main entrance way, and features a sophisticated water catchment area. The Lesser Saru was used to defend the Kalateh Saru natural springs from which water was pumped to the main castle. The Saru Castles are believed to be used by Arsacids, Dabuyids of Tabaristan, Buyids, and eventually by the Nizari Ismailis, who built the current castle on the site of an earlier fortification. Saru is relatively understudied, and is a well-preserved case to study the architecture of the Ismaili castles. The Saru Castles are located at 80 km of Gerdkuh, another Ismaili castle of the Qumis region.http://www.semnaniha.ir/%D9%82%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%87-%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%88/ The etymology of the word SƒÅr≈´ () is uncertain.

In this method, a bubble of air is injected beneath a solid, the surface of which is located in the liquid, instead of placing a drop on the solid as in the case of the sessile drop technique. The method is particularly suitable for solids with high surface free energy on which liquids spread out. Hydrogels, such as soft contact lenses for example, are likewise inaccessible for the standard arrangement; the captive bubble method is also used in such cases. The captive bubble method is a scientific method for measuring the contact angle between a solid surface and liquid in a fluid. A contact angle is formed on a smooth, periodically heterogeneous solid surface. Above the solid surface, a liquid drop is submerged to the solid in a fluid. The measurement of contact angles usually contributes to the measurement of the surface energy of solids in the industry. Different from other methods of measuring the contact angle, such as the sessile drop method, the system utilized in the captive bubble method has the fluid bubble attached from below to the solid surface, in which both the liquid bubble and the solid interact with a fluid.  Application and its significance  = Surface Energy of Solids = As a system is formed from a solid surface and a drop of liquid, energy minima and maxima are produced by the free energy of the system. When the solid surface is rough or homogeneous, the system, which is made up of a solid, a liquid, and a fluid, could have multiple minima produced from the free energy at different minima points. One of these minima is called the global minimum. The global minimum has the lowest free energy within the system and is defined to be the stable equilibrium state. Furthermore, the other minima illustrate the metastable equilibrium states of the system. In between these minima are the energy barriers which hinder the motion of energy between the various metastable states in the system. The transition of energy between metastable states is also affected by the availability of external energy of the system, which is as well associated with the volume of the liquid drop on top of the solid surface. Likewise, the volume of the liquid could potentially have an impact on the locations of the minima points, which could influence the contact angles created by the solid and the liquid. Besides, the contact angles are directly related to whether the solid surface is ideal, in other words, whether it is a smooth, heterogeneous surface. In the Captive Bubble Method, the bubble indicating the liquid drop makes an angle with the solid surface which is called the contact angle. The stability of the liquid phase on the solid is measured with an intrinsic contact angle. Theoretically, the contact angle equals to the value of the local intrinsic contact angle with the assumption of a negligible effect of line tension. = Surface Analysis of Reverse Osmosis Membrane = The measurement of contact angles with the Captive Bubble method could also be useful in the surface analysis of the reverse osmosis membrane for the studying of membrane performances. Through the analysis of contact angles, properties of membranes, such as roughness, can be determined. The roughness of membranes, which indicates the effective surface area, can further lead to the investigation in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of the surface. Through studies, a higher contact angle may correspond to a more hydrophobic surface in membrane analysis. In the performance of the Captive Bubble Method in membrane analysis, several factors can have influence on the contact angle, including the bubble volume, liquid types and tensions. In the apparatus of the captive bubble method in membrane analysis, the membrane sample is attached to a piece of glass, while a J-shaped needle is inserted from below the glass in the liquid to release air bubbles. In this case, the contact angle between the air bubble and the glass surface is recorded as a function of time to investigate the effect of measurement time. = Surface Tensions of Lung Surface Active Material = In comparison to the use of the captive bubble method in the measurement of contact angles in other cases, the contact angle in the study of lung surfactant monolayer is kept at constant, which is 180 degrees, due to the property of a hydrated agar gel of the ceiling of the bubble. The system applied in the study of lung surfactant is designed to be a leak-proof system, ensuring the independence of the surface film of bubbles from other materials and substances like plastic walls, barriers, and outlets. Instead of adding extra tubing or piercing the bubble air-water interface with needles, this closed system is created by adjusting the pressure within the closed sample chamber by adding or removing aqueous media to regulate the bubble size and surface tension of insoluble films at the bubble surface. Since the bubble volumes are controlled by modifying the pressure in the sample chamber, the surface area and the surface tension of the surfactant film at the bubble surface are reduced as the volume of the bubble decreases. The bubble shape, in this case, can vary from spherical to oval shape depending on the surface tension, which can be calculated through the measurement of height and diameter of bubbles. In addition to measuring the surface tension, bubble formation can also be utilized in the measurement of the adsorption of lung surfactant, which defines how quickly substances build up on the air-liquid interface of pulmonary surfactants to form a film. There are two methods to measure adsorption with captive bubbles: # One method of forming bubbles to measure adsorption is to begin with a small bubble of a diameter of 2-3 mm in a chamber with a diameter of 10 mm then expand or compress it later. The bubble is first introduced into the chamber with a small plastic tubing attached to a 50 ¬µl micro-syringe. It is then expanded through a sudden decrease in pressure inside the captive bubble or an increase in chamber volume by moving the piston on the end of the glass cylinder. To calculate the exact adsorption rate, the initial amount of surfactant on the bubble surface before volume modification has to be taken into consideration. # Another method of measuring adsorption is to start a bubble with a fixed volume instead of a given size or diameter by utilizing a needle on the bottom inlet of the bubble chamber. The fixed volume to start with is usually 200 ml, which is around 7 mm in diameter. Just as the condition for the first method, the accumulation of material on the bubble surface during bubble formation has to be calculated in order to evaluate the exact rate of adsorption.  Comparisons Between Sessile Drop Method and Captive Bubble Method  The sessile drop method is also one popular way to measure contact angles by placing a two-dimensional drop on a solid surface and controlling the volume of liquid in the drop. The sessile drop method and the captive bubble method are usually interchangeable in performing experiments since their common property of symmetry. Specifically, the axis of symmetry of the drop and bubble of the two methods makes the contact line of the drop of liquid with the solid surface circular, which therefore creates an observable contact angle in corresponding to each contact radius of the drop and bubble. However, interacting with a rough homogeneous surface in measurements of contact angles, the drop and bubble of the two methods each presents different behaviours in the measuring process, which are related to the volume of liquid and contact angles. # On a rough homogeneous surface, the observed contact angle may not represent the actual contact angle with a local slope since it may not be observable on a rough surface. The observed contact angle on a rough surface is also called an apparent angle which is equivalent to the sum of the intrinsic contact angle and the local surface slope at the tangent of the contact slope for a drop or bubble. With the sessile drop method, the observed contact angle usually underestimated the intrinsic contact angle, while the observed contact angle in the captive bubble method overestimates the intrinsic contact angle of the rough surface. # If a graph is plotted respectively for the measurements of contact angles using the sessile drop method and the captive bubble method concerning the volume of liquid within the drop or bubble and the measured contact angle, the geometrical relationships illustrate different characteristics for each method. In consideration of the relationship between contact angles and the position of the contact for a certain volume in the drop or bubble, the highest and lowest possible contact angles on volume are dependent on each other differently in the two methods. # For the amplitude of oscillations shown in the graph, both of the drop and the captive bubble display a similar order of magnitude at a relatively low contact angle. On the other hand, on a rough surface with a relatively high contact angle, the amplitude shown for the drop is larger than that of a captive bubble. The amplitude of oscillation of the lowest highest possible contact angle demonstrates the difference for the drop method and the captive bubble method, in which the amplitude of the graph of the captive bubble method is comparatively larger than that of the graph of the sessile drop method. # In terms of the wavelength of the graph, the wavelength for both methods spans over a large range of volume of liquid on the solid surface. Differences in behaviours of the drop and the bubble vary from the lowest possible contact angles to the highest possible contact angle.

Once a dominating centre of power in the region, it was destroyed by fire on 21 July 1717. History The castle was built on a crag overlooking the Hirschbach; the first recorded mention of it dates to around 1100. For centuries it was the major centre of power in the Isarwinkel, the region along the Isar between Bad T√∂lz and Wallgau. The community of log-rafters and craftsmen which grew up below it became Lenggries. The original owners of the Hohenburg were the lords of Thann. Late in the 12th century it came into the possession of the lords of T√∂lz, and in 1262 passed to the Wittelsbachs. From 1294 it was in the possession of the lords of Egling, then from 1396 of the lords of Maxlrain, who substantially rebuilt and enlarged it in 1410-20\\\\. In 1522 it passed to the House of Schellenberg. Finally in 1566 Dionys von Schellenberg sold the castle and fief to his nephew Hanns Paul Herwarth, and they remained in his line until 1800. Until the mid-16th century it remained a defensive castle; there is a legend of a tunnel under the Isar connecting it with the Neuburg on the Brauneck.\\"Wanderung zur Burgruine Hohenburg\\", Bayerischer Rundfunk, 26 December 2014 From 1570 on, rebuilding changed its appearance and gave it characteristics of an aristocratic residence. In 1705 the castle and the town were in the centre of the Bavarian People's Uprising against Austrian occupation; the first resistance was organised there. The uprising ended with Sendling's Night of Murder on Christmas Day in 1705 and the Battle of Aidenbach in January 1706. During the War of the Spanish Succession, the castle was occupied by Austrian troops and on 21 July 1707 a fire of unexplained origins spread to the entire castle within an hour and completely destroyed it. According to Judge Mayr's report to Count Herwarth, the fire broke out at about 10 o'clock in the Great Hall, which was being used as a barracks, and the hussars set up a hue and cry but evacuated the castle rather than attempt to fight it. Their lieutenant objected to the suggestion that his men had caused the fire through drunkenness or carelessness and blamed a dirty, blocked fireplace in the hall; however, several witnesses later said the fireplace had not been the source of the fire. The castle was then mostly demolished, the stones being reused for the parish church and the new Schloss Hohenburg, which was built approximately to the west. Trees that have grown up on the site have further broken up what remains. Modern times The site is still heavily wooded. Part of a tower, several ramparts and ruined walls and a well shaft remain of the castle. During the 20th century Romantics and preservationists became aware of the ruin and sought to prevent it from decaying further. A Burgverein--castle association--was founded in 2003, and organised a permanent exhibit at the Lenggries museum that opened in 2007 on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the castle's destruction. In 2004-06, geodesy experts from the University of the German Federal Armed Forces at Neubiberg near Munich surveyed the site and the ruins with lasers, making it the first castle in Bavaria of which an accurate virtual model exists; this is the centrepiece of the museum display.Terrestrisches Laserscanning: Lenggries, Universit√§t der Bundeswehr M√ºnchen \\"Vermessung und virtuelle Rekonstruktion der Burgruine Hohenburg bei Lenggries\\", Universit√§t der Bundeswehr M√ºnchen The association organised an associated clean-up and cleared 24 trees; the once overgrown path up to the castle is now clear, and in 2014 informational signs with photographs were placed along it and a view cleared through the trees from the first stop.Veronika Wenzel, \\"F√∂rderverein Burgruine Hohenburg: Lehrpfad zum einstigen Herrschaftszentrum\\", M√ºnchner Merkur, 12 November 2014 References Further reading * Michael Petzet, Georg Paula and Angelika Wegener-H√ºssen.

Such devices use automated methods of verifying or recognising the identity of a living person based on a physiological or behavioral characteristic. These characteristics include fingerprints, facial images, iris and voice recognition.  History  Biometric devices have been used by man over a long period of time. Non-automated biometric devices have used us since 500 BC as it was seen that Babylonian business transactions were recorded on clay tablets that included fingerprints. Automation in Biometric devices was first seen in the 1960s. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the 1960s, introduced the Indentimat, which started checking for fingerprints to maintain criminal records. The first systems measured the shape of the hand and the length of the fingers. Although discontinued in the 1980s, the system set a precedent for future Biometric Devices.  Subgroups  The characteristic of the human body are used to access information by the users. According to these characteristics, the sub-divided groups are: * Chemical biometric devices: Analyses the segments of the DNA to grant access to the users. * Visual biometric devices: Analyses the visual features of the humans to grant access which includes iris recognition, face recognition, Finger recognition and Retina Recognition. * Behavioral biometric devices: Analyses the Walking Ability and Signatures (velocity of sign, width of sign, pressure of sign) distinct to every human. * Olfactory biometric devices: Analyses the odor to distinguish between varied users. * Auditory biometric devices: Analyses the voice to determine the identity of a speaker for accessing control.  Uses  = Workplace = IRIS and Fingerprint recognition at Heathrow Terminal 4 Biometrics are being used to establish better and accessible records of the hours employee's work. With the increase in \\"Buddy Punching\\" (a case where employees clocked out coworkers and fraudulently inflated their work hours) employers have looked towards new technology like fingerprint recognition to reduce such fraud. Additionally, employers are also faced with the task of proper collection of data such as entry and exit times. Biometric devices make for largely fool proof and reliable ways of enabling to collect data as employees have to be present to enter biometric details which are unique to them. = Immigration = As the demand for air travel grows and more people travel, modern day airports have to implement technology in such a way that there are no long queues. Biometrics are being implemented in more and more airports as they enable quick recognition of passengers and hence lead to lower volume of people standing in queue's. One such example is of the Dubai International Airport which plans to make immigration counters a relic of the past as they implement IRIS on the move technology (IOM) which should help the seamless departures and arrivals of passengers at the airport. = Handheld and personal devices = Fingerprint sensors can be found on mobile devices. The fingerprint sensor is used to unlock the device and authorize actions, like money and file transfers, for example. It can be used to prevent a device from being used by an unauthorized person.  Present day biometric devices  The signature is authenticated by the spaces taken in each square = Personal signature verification systems = This is one of the most highly recognised and acceptable biometrics in corporate surroundings. This verification has been taken one step further by capturing the signature while taking into account many parameters revolving around this like the pressure applied while signing, the speed of the hand movement and the angle made between the surface and the pen used to make the signature. This system also has the ability to learn from users as signature styles vary for the same user. Hence by taking a sample of data, this system is able to increase its own accuracy. = Iris recognition system = Iris recognition involves the device scanning the pupil of the subject and then cross referencing that to data stored on the database. It is one of the most secure forms of authentication, as while fingerprints can be left behind on surfaces, iris prints are extremely hard to be stolen. Iris recognition is widely applied by organisations dealing with the masses, one being the Aadhaar identification carried out by the Government of India to keep records of its population. The reason for this is that iris recognition makes use of iris prints of humans, which hardly evolve during one's lifetime and are extremely stable.  Problems with present day biometric devices  = Biometric spoofing = Using fine powder and a brush to reveal and copy fingerprints Biometric spoofing is a method of fooling a biometric identification management system, where a counterfeit mold is presented in front of the biometric scanner. This counterfeit mold emulates the unique biometric attributes of an individual so as to confuse the system between the artifact and the real biological target and gain access to sensitive data/materials. One such high-profile case of Biometric spoofing came to the limelight when it was found that German Defence Minister, Ursula von der Leyen's fingerprint had been successfully replicated by Chaos Computer Club. The group used high quality camera lenses and shot images from 6 feet away. They used a professional finger software and mapped the contours of the Ministers thumbprint. Although progress has been made to stop spoofing. Using the principle of pulse oximetry\\\\- the liveliness of the test subject is taken into account by measure of blood oxygenation and the heart rate. This reduces attacks like the ones mentioned above, although these methods aren't commercially applicable as costs of implementation are high. This reduces their real world application and hence makes biometrics insecure until these methods are commercially viable. = Accuracy = Accuracy is a major issue with biometric recognition. Passwords are still extremely popular, because a password is static in nature, while biometric data can be subject to change (such as one's voice becoming heavier due to puberty, or an accident to the face, which could lead to improper reading of facial scan data). When testing voice recognition as a substitute to PIN-based systems, Barclays reported that their voice recognition system is 95 percent accurate. This statistic means that many of its customers' voices might still not be recognised even when correct. This uncertainty revolving around the system could lead to slower adoption of biometric devices, continuing the reliance of traditional password-based methods.  Benefits of biometric devices over traditional methods of authentication  * Biometric data cannot be lent and hacking of Biometric data is complicated hence it makes it safer to use than traditional methods of authentication like passwords which can be lent and shared. Passwords do not have the ability to judge the user but rely only on the data provided by the user, which can easily be stolen while Biometrics work on the uniqueness of each individual. * Passwords can be forgotten and recovering them can take time, whereas Biometric devices rely on biometric data which tends to be unique to a person, hence there is no risk of forgetting the authentication data. A study conducted among Yahoo! users found that at least 1.5 percent of Yahoo users forgot their passwords every month, hence this makes accessing services more lengthy for consumers as the process of recovering passwords is lengthy. These shortcomings make Biometric devices more efficient and reduces effort for the end user.  Future  Researchers are targeting the drawbacks of present-day biometric devices and developing to reduce problems like biometric spoofing and inaccurate intake of data. Technologies which are being developed are- * The United States Military Academy are developing an algorithm that allows identification through the ways each individual interacts with their own computers; this algorithm considers unique traits like typing speed, rhythm of writing and common spelling mistakes. This data allows the algorithm to create a unique profile for each user by combining their multiple behavioral and stylometric information. This can be very difficult to replicate collectively. * A recent innovation by Kenneth Okereafor K. U. Okereafor, C. Onime and O. E. Osuagwu, \\"Multi-biometric Liveness Detection - A New Perspective,\\" West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research, vol. 16, no. 1, pp. 26 - 37, 2016 (https://www.ajol.info/index.php/wajiar/article/view/145878) and,K. U. Okereafor, C. Onime and O. E. Osuagwu, \\"Enhancing Biometric Liveness Detection Using Trait Randomization Technique,\\" 2017 UKSim-AMSS 19th International Conference on Modelling & Simulation, University of Cambridge, Conference Proceedings, pp. 28 ‚Äì 33, 2017 (http://uksim.info/uksim2017/CD/data/2735a028.pdf) presented an optimized and secure design of applying biometric liveness detection technique using a trait randomization approach. This novel concept potentially opens up new ways of mitigating biometric spoofing more accurately, and making impostor predictions intractable or very difficult in future biometric devices. A simulation of Kenneth Okereafor's biometric liveness detection algorithm using a 3D multi- biometric framework consisting of 15 liveness parameters from facial print, finger print and iris pattern traits resulted in a system efficiency of the 99.2% over a cardinality of 125 distinct randomization combinations. The uniqueness of Okereafor's innovation lies in the application of uncorrelated biometric trait parameters including intrinsic and involuntary biomedical properties from eye blinking pattern, pulse oxymetry, finger spectroscopy, electrocardiogram, perspiration, etc. *A group of Japanese Researchers have created a system which uses 400 sensors in a chair to identify the contours and unique pressure points of a person. This derri√®re authenticator, still undergoing massive improvements and modifications, is claimed to be 98% accurate and is seen to have application in anti theft device mechanisms in cars. *Inventor Lawrence F. Glaser has developed and patented technology which appears at first to be a high definition display. However, unlike displays with 2 dimensional pixel arrays, this technology incorporates pixel stacks, accomplishing a series of goals leading to the capture of a multi-biometric. It is believed to be the first man-made device which can capture 2 or more distinct biometrics from the same region of pixel stacks (forming a surface) at the same instant, allowing for the data to form a third biometric, which is a more complex pattern inclusive as to how the data aligns. An example would be to capture the finger print and the capillary pattern at precisely the same moment. Other opportunities exist with this technology, such as to capture kirlean data which assures the finger was alive during an event, or capture of bone details forming another biometric used with the others previously mentioned. The concept of stacking pixels to achieve increased functionality from less surface area is combined with the ability to emit any color from a single pixel, eliminating the need for RGB (RED GREEN BLUE) surface emissions. Lastly, the technology was tested with high power cadmium magnetics to check for distortion or other anomalies, as the inventor wanted to also embed magnetic emission and magnetic collection with this same surface technology, but without exhibiting any magnetic stripes on the surface. Devices, such as smart cards, can pass magnetic data from any orientation by automatically sensing what the user has done, and using data about where the card is when \\"swiped\\" or inserted into a reader. This technology can detect touch or read gestures at distance, without a user side camera and with no active electronics on its surface. The use of Multibiometrics hardens automated identity acquisition by a factor of 800,000,000 and will prove to be very difficult to hack or emulate.

Rublee spent much of his childhood in Europe, while his father Horace Rublee served for eight years as the United States Ambassador to Switzerland. In 1884, Rublee enrolled with the first students at the new Groton School in Massachusetts; in 1886 he became the sole member of Groton's first graduating class.Westwood, p. 19. He received a law degree from Harvard University in 1895.Westwood, p. 20. In the spring of 1896, he returned to Harvard for one semester to teach the contracts course in place of Professor Samuel Williston, who was unwell. At the end of the term, Rublee declined an invitation to join Harvard's faculty and returned to the practice of law.Westwood, p. 20. After serving as assistant to Wall Street corporation lawyer Victor Morawetz in the 1890s and early 1900s, Rublee entered public life when he became political adviser to Governor Robert P. Bass to establish La Follette-inspired reforms in New Hampshire (1910‚Äì12). Rublee then served as adviser to Theodore Roosevelt on political-economic matters in the 1912 presidential campaign and as adviser to President Woodrow Wilson on anti-trust reform beginning in 1914. Rublee was the primary force behind the establishment of the Federal Trade Commission, upon which he served by recess appointment from 1915 to 1917. Rublee pivoted to international affairs when he was appointed as U.S. representative to the London-based Allied Maritime Transport Council (AMTC) in 1917, where Rublee became an ardent internationalist while serving with Jean Monnet and James Arthur Salter on the AMTC. In 1921, Rublee became the third partner in Covington and Burling, the Washington, D.C. law firm co-founded by his Harvard schoolmate Edward B. Burling.Westwood, p. 20, 31 Rublee remained a member of the firm until 1945,Westwood, p. 86. but after 1927 he devoted much of his time to international affairs. In 1928, Rublee became an adviser to Ambassador Dwight Morrow in his mission to Mexico. Rublee served on the U.S. delegation to the London Naval Conference in 1930, where he worked to promote U.S. cooperation with the Versailles treaty security system, and he was involved in several Latin American diplomatic missions during the 1930s. His public work climaxed in 1938 when Franklin Roosevelt requested Rublee become director of the London-based Intergovernmental Committee on Political Refugees Coming from Germany, which attempted to arrange for the resettlement of German and Austrian Jews prior to the outbreak of World War II. He was unsuccessful in that effort other than being able secure visas for about 600 Jewish refugees to Argentina.

It defines the lifecycle and technical requirements for ensuring effective design of fire and gas detection systems for use in the process industries. The technical report provides a lifecycle for performance based design of fire and gas detection systems, listing out the steps involved in a performance based design and establishing requirements to be implemented for each step. The technical report also defines performance metrics for application to fire and gas detection systems. The performance metrics established in this report for fire and gas system effectiveness include coverage and safety availability. Scope The technical report discusses fire and gas detector placement for process industry applications. The report does not include discussions on the attributes of fire detection signaling equipment or equipment that is activated upon detection of a fire or gas release, such as alarms, sprinklers, or chemical suppression systems. The process industries include industrial facilities that handle bulk chemicals, such as oil refining and upgrading, petrochemical, specialty chemical, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, and non- nuclear power generation. History In 2006, the ISA 84 committee developed a working group to study the issue of how fire and gas systems should be treated with respect to the IEC 61511 standard for safety instrumented systems. Many industry practitioners were having trouble utilizing the IEC 61511 standard for the design of fire and gas systems for two reasons: fire and gas systems are not 100% effective in detecting fires and gas releases (i.e., coverage is not 100%), and even if a fire or gas release is detected, the consequences of the incident are not prevented, they are only reduced (i.e., mitigative). As a result, the techniques and metrics shown in IEC 61511 are not adequate to perform fire and gas system design. The ISA 84 committee formed a working group to study the issue. In 2010, this working group released the first version of the ISA 84.00.07 technical report that laid out new techniques and metrics that were required to effectively design FGS systems using the performance based techniques that underpin the IEC 61511 standard. The Technical Report The technical report provides two primary guidance efforts. The first is the development of a lifecycle for the performance based design on Fire and Gas systems. This safety lifecycle includes the steps required to design a functionally safe fire and gas system, along with establishing the requirements of each of the steps. The technical report also defines the two metrics that define the effectiveness of fire and gas systems (as opposed to the single metric of safety integrity level (SIL) that is employed for safety instrumented systems (SIS)). These two metrics are coverage and safety availability. The coverage of a fire and gas detection array is defined in two ways. Geographic coverage and scenario coverage. The geographic coverage is the fraction of the area of given elevation of interest where if a fire or a gas release were to occur (i.e., be centered) the fire or gas release would be detected by the fire and gas detection array. Geographic coverage is only concerned with the location and performance attributes of detection equipment and obstructions to the \\"view\\" of the equipment. Scenario coverage, on the other hand, is defined as the fraction of fire or gas release scenarios that if they were to occur, would be detected by the fire and gas detection array.

He is a soloist and chamber musician, a professor, past artistic director of the International Festival des Minimes in Brussels, the International Festival Sint Carolus Borromeuskerk in Antwerp and the International Festival at the Cath√©drale Notre-Dame-de-la- Treille de Lille, France, and currently artistic director of the Festival St Andrieskerk in Antwerp, Festival Catharina and Festival Chapel for Europe in Brussels, a scientific researcher and consultant who resides and works in Belgium.  Life and music studies  Tigran Maytesian was born in Sevan, Armenia. He commenced his violin studies at the age of five and pursued an elaborate classic music education from music school up to conservatory and postgraduate violin. His d√©but was at the age of nine with the chamber orchestra of music school No. 19 in Yerevan, Armenia, (directed by Gohar Mouradian). In 1990, he became a student of C. Hakhnazaryan at the Yerevan Komitas State Conservatory. Later, from 1992 to 1995, within an international exchange program, Tigran continued his violin studies with Yuri Gerets at the Estonian Academy of Music in Tallinn, Estonia and from 1995 till 1997 he was assistant internship supervisor, post-graduate student at the Moscow Conservatory named after P. I. Tchaikovsky. During his studies in Tallinn, Tigran Maytesian met Igor Bezrodny, a distinguished violinist and pedagogue of the 20th century, who initiated him into the traditions of the Russian violin school of Abram Yampolsky (Bezrodny was a student of the latter). Since then Tigran has followed the best practices of the Russian violin school with its focus on technical skills, relaxed handplay, peculiar sense for the acoustic characteristics of the violin, the capabilities for creating sound, the richness and color of the created sound, and the artistic freedom and self- development of the violinist.  Career and concerts  His performance career started during his studies, when from 1987 till 1998 he was a concertmaster (first violin) in the orchestra of the State Radio and Television of Armenia conducted by Gevorg Adzhemian. On invitation by the Estonian Radio ‚Ä≥Fourth Station‚Ä≥ and the Conservatory of Estonia, from 1993 onwards, he has regularly performed in Scandinavia. Since 2000, he lives in Belgium and over 3 years, from 2002 till 2005, he served as the first violin at the National Chamber Orchestra of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. He has performed in many recitals and concert series with different pianists and renowned orchestras in Russia, Armenia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Israel as well as throughout West- European countries (Finland, Estonia, Luxemburg, Belgium, Poland, Slovakia, the Netherlands, and France).

Daniel Blumenthal (Belgium) is one of the pianists accompanying him on a regular basis. Among other pianists with whom he gave concerts in different countries are Elisabeth Ginsburg (Moscow, Russia), Irina Tsys, Konstantin Zenkin, Andrey Krouzhkov (Moscow, Russia), Marrit Gerets (Estonia), Luba Harutyunyan (Belgium), Luc De Vos (Belgium), Ruben Chakhmakhchyan (Armenia), and Joseph Ermin (Ukraine).

In 2012 he became artistic director of the International Festival des Minimes in Brussels (Belgium) upon invitation by Abb√© Jacques Van der Biest, honorary citizen of the city of Brussels, and by Prince Amaury de Merode, President of the ‚Ä≥Centre d'Oeuvres de Merode‚Ä≥ (Brussels, Belgium). He continued and expanded this initiative in 2013, to include also the International Festival Sint Carolus Borromeuskerk in Antwerp (Belgium) and the International Festival at the Cath√©drale Notre-Dame-de-la-Treille de Lille, France. Starting from 2016 Tigran Maytesian has been acting as Artistic director of the non-profitable musical association Pro Musica Pulchra guiding a series of music festivals: Festival Catharina in Brussels, Festival St.Andrieskerk in Antwerp and Festival Chapel for Europe in Brussels with participation of young talented musicians from different countries.

He performs with a violin from the 17th century Italian master Nicola Amati and a violin from the 18th century Italian master Giuseppe Guarneri  Music composition  Tigran's creative talent has revealed in his music composing activity. The Caprices written and performed by the composer himself (Caprice #1 inspired by the composition \\"Krunk\\" of the Armenian composer Komitas, Caprice #2 (\\"Astana\\"), Caprice #3 dedicated to A.Schnittke and Caprice #4) have been highly esteemed and universally acclaimed by the musical critics and composers. These compositions enjoyed great popularity and success with the audience at his performances in Belgium and concert tours worldwide.  Pedagogue  Since 2008 Tigran Maytesian has been appointed a Professor at the Lemmens Institute (Lemmensinstituut - Conservatory of the Catholic University Leuven, Belgium) to conduct two classes: solo violin and chamber music. Alongside his performance career he has concentrated on the pedagogical activities and successfully prepared several students for international solo violin and chamber music competitions. Besides teaching at the Lemmens Institute in Leuven, Belgium he regularly conducts master classes in conservatoires and music schools in Belgium, Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, for both solo violinists and chamber musicians.  Scientific research  Tigran Maytesian showed great interest in exploring different aspects of classical music and its influence on human brain perception and functioning. In 2011 he became Professor at the Medical School (Laboratory for Neuro- and Psychophysiology) at the Catholic University Leuven (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven), Belgium. Since then he has been actively involved in the ‚Ä≥Mind Speller‚Ä≥ project (http://simone.neuro.kuleuven.be), participating in this scientific research together with his colleague Professor Marc Van Hulle. Among other major aspects within the ‚Ä≥Mind Speller‚Ä≥ project is a study of the connection between music and emotions by means of electro-encephalography (EEG). The ultimate aim is to develop an ‚Ä≥affective brain‚Äìcomputer interface‚Ä≥ with which patients suffering from language disorders, due to neurological diseases such aphasia, autism, and dementia, can express their emotions via EEG without using facial expressions, gestures or other forms of muscular activity. Professor Maytesian has successfully promoted this project at universities in Belarus, Armenia and Russia (Moscow).

It is one of the largest and most notable tithe barns in England. The barn is constructed of a mixture of Blue Lias and Cotswold stones, with a stone tile roof. It was originally built for Evesham Abbey, which was the third largest abbey in England. It is now owned and operated by the National Trust. History There is some uncertainty about when the barn was built. The National Trust describes it as 13th- century, whereas English Heritage describe in as 14th-century The discrepancy may be the result of a radiocarbon date of around 1250 conflicting with evidence that the barn was built in 1376 by Abbot John Ombersley of Evesham Abbey. The barn was built to hold tithes collected for Evesham Abbey, which was the third largest abbey in England before the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The size of the barn is an indication of the importance of the abbey at this time. Also remaining from the Benedictine Evesham Abbey are two churches, a bell tower, a cloister arch and the Almonry. Architecture Middle Littleton Tithe Barn, Evesham, Worcestershire The barn is constructed of Blue lias stone with Cotswold stone dressings. It has a triple purlin roof which is tiled in stone. The building has had several modifications; a pair of gables on each side of the building were destroyed during the Victorian period and additions made to both sides. Smaller gables with ornate clover-leaf finials and many buttresses remain. Protection The barn was granted Grade I listed status on 30 July 1959.

Born in Saltburn, Pinkney completed an apprenticeship as a welder and joined the Amalgamated Society of Boilermakers. He found employment at a steelworks in Middlesbrough, and became a junior shop steward. However, when the works closed in 1978, he was unable to find a new job in the industry and instead joined the Royal Navy, serving as a submariner. Following a five-year stint in the Navy, Pinkney studied at a polytechnic, and joined the Communist Party of Great Britain. He found work as a railway signalman, working in the world's oldest signal box, in Stockton-on- Tees. He also joined the National Union of Railwaymen, which later became part of the RMT. Pinkney became first a union representative, then branch secretary and regional secretary. Pinkney's union involvement further increased following the election of Bob Crow as general secretary, and culminated with Pinkney's election as president in 2012; the highest lay official of the union. As President, Pinkney pledged that the RMT \\"will fight for the abolition of capitalism and replace it with a socialist system\\". During Pinkney's time as president, Crow died unexpectedly, and Pinkney took his place on the General Council of the Trades Union Congress. In February 2015, Pinkney confirmed that he would be standing as a Green Party candidate in Redcar in the 2015 General Election. In the election he came fifth with 2.2% of the vote. In 2016, Pinkney signed a letter in The Guardian newspaper alongside Sean Hoyle, Paul McDonnell and John Reid from the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), which opposes the Electoral Commission choosing Leave.EU, Vote Leave or Grassroots Out as the official group advocating for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union in the 2016 referendum on the subject. The letter said that: > We call on the commission not to give taxpayers' money to the Tory and Ukip- > dominated Vote Leave, Leave.EU or Grassroots Out campaigns, or any amalgam > of them ... We believe there are millions of trade unionists, young people, > anti-austerity campaigners and working-class voters, whose opposition to the > big business-dominated EU would not be represented by these organisations. > ... We call on the Electoral Commission to recognise that a significant > proportion of those who will vote against the EU do so because they support > basic socialist policies of workers' rights, public ownership, and > opposition to austerity and racism.

Misreported by McCulloch as Where Diggers Rest. Returning to Adelaide, he resumed studies with the South Australian School of Arts and Crafts, and produced a book of drawings of Adelaide landmarks and taught etching at the School of Arts and Crafts.

He founded the Black Dispatch in 1915, the first black newspaper in Oklahoma City, and used it as a platform to support civil rights and reveal injustices. Long active in the local chapter of the NAACP, in 1932 he brought together several chapters to found the state chapter or branch of the NAACP. He served as its president for 16 years, and was also on the national board of the NAACP. Dunjee was a leader in Oklahoma City, using his newspaper to advance racial integration in housing, university admission, education, transportation and other public accommodations. He worked for fair jury selection and against lynchings. Early life Roscoe Dunjee was born June 21, 1883 in Harpers Ferry, Jefferson County, West Virginia. His father was Reverend John William, who worked at Storer College, a historically black college,, and his mother was Lydia Ann Dunjee.. Roscoe was born in the dormitory at Storer College. His family moved several times from one college to another, due to John William Dunjee's love for education. They ended up in Oklahoma in 1892. His father went all over Oklahoma building fine schools and churches, in his role as a representative of the Baptist Home Missionary Society. Roscoe had a brother, Irving, and three sisters, Ella, Drusilla, and Blanche. Roscoe was a brilliant child. The local schools were not challenging enough for him, so he persuaded his parents to let him drop out of school and become a farmer at a very early age. Roscoe's father was obsessed with building as many high-quality schools and churches as he could, and was seldom at home for more than a few days. While still a kid himself, Dunjee took on the responsibility of helping support his mother and a younger brother and sister. Apparently, dropping out of school did not hurt him. As an adult, he developed a reputation for having one of the best legal minds of his time. In his youth, he was very successful as a farmer and made a great deal of money by the age of thirty. He invested that money in the Black Dispatch newspaper and in the civil rights movement. In 1903, when the young Dunjee was 20 his father died. He enrolled as a member of the first class at Langston College, a historically black college in Langston, Oklahoma that then emphasized technical and industrial trades. While there, Roscoe learned to set type by working after hours in the print shop of The Langston Herald, a small community paper. The responsibility he had taken on to help provide for his mother and siblings made it impossible for Roscoe to complete his course work at Langston. Young Dunjee decided to enlarge the operation and become a truck farmer, selling directly to the public. He also worked as a bellhop at the Stewart Hotel in Oklahoma City, but constantly looked for more opportunities. He educated himself mostly by reading widely in his family's 1500-volume library. Career Interested in the growing movement of black fraternalism, Dunjee joined the Pythian Grand Lodge and began lecturing in its behalf throughout the state. He also enlisted new members, and his reputation as an organizer grew. When Dunjee was traveling throughout Oklahoma, he could see the difficult conditions of black migrant sharecroppers and tenant farmers. Not only was the Negro unable to earn a living wage, the state had passed discriminatory laws related to segregation of transportation and other public accommodations. Dunjee began thinking seriously about establishing a newspaper that could tell the Negro story and reply to white racism. In 1915, when he was 32 years of age, he had a chance to purchase a job printing plant from Oliva J. Abby, an instructor in the Oklahoma City public schools, whose printer husband had become ill. He founded his own newspaper, the Black Dispatch, the first black newspaper in Oklahoma City. He used this as a platform to publish editorials against segregation and report unfair treatment of blacks. The newspaper grew from a local publication to a national one, at one point boasting nearly 20,000 subscribers. Dunjee would regularly report on lynchings of blacks in both Oklahoma and Texas. He worked to change voter laws that prohibited or constrained black voters from the polls. Oklahoma's new 1908 constitution, passed after statehood, had raised barriers to voter registration, effectively disenfranchising blacks and other minority voters. It joined former states of the Confederacy across the South in taking such action. In 1916 the state passed a grandfather clause that enabled white voters to escape certain restrictions related to literacy. Dunjee's efforts contributed to court challenges; ultimately lawyers of the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) overturned the grandfather clause in the US Supreme Court case Guinn v. United States. Dunjee publicized the murder trial of Jess Hollins. He was a black man arrested for the rape of a white woman, to which he confessed without having seen counsel. He was rapidly sentenced to death four days after the alleged attack in December 1931. Dunjee reported on the case, supporting an appeal. The judge said he moved fast because he feared another Tulsa Race Riot, as had taken place in 1921. The state court ruled that Hollins deserved a jury trial. He was convicted by an all-white jury in 1934 and again sentenced to death. The case was appealed to the US Supreme Court, which ruled in Hollins v. State of Oklahoma (1935), that the systematic exclusion of blacks from the jury had been grounds for reversing Hollins' conviction. It directed a new trial. Hollins was convicted by another all-white jury and sentenced to life in prison. He died in 1950, and is now widely believed to have been innocent. In 1916 the Oklahoma Board of Commissioners passed an ordinance forbidding black residents from moving into a house on a block occupied by at least 75% white residents. Dunjee funded the cases of several black residents who were attempting to integrate areas not zoned for blacks. William Floyd was a black shoemaker who purchased a home in a majority-white neighborhood. Floyd was jailed four times for attempting to occupy his newly purchased home. Dunjee bailed Floyd out each time and encouraged him to return to the home. In this period the US Supreme Court ruled in Buchanan v. Warley (1917) that racially discriminatory state and local ordinances for housing were unconstitutional. A judge in Oklahoma ruled the state law was unconstitutional on those grounds. In the early part of 1921, the Ku Klux Klan sent salesmen into Oklahoma to sell memberships for $10 each. The Klan spread like wild fire, eventually selling 100,000 memberships. On May 31, 1921, after the Klan had been agitating in Oklahoma for only a few months, a group of Caucasian men set fire to the Greenwood District of Tulsa which was Black owned, burning 3,500 people out of their homes and destroying many lucrative businesses. Greenwood District had been one of the most successful Black enclaves in the United States and had often been called Black Wall Street. It is unclear how many Black people died in that 48-hour period, and how many ran away and never came back. The Greenwood District burned for two days. It was decimated. When the newspaper accounts began to come out, the white-owned newspapers blamed Black people and called what was really a massacre, a race riot. Of course, the Black Dispatch told the truth, but few Caucasians read it. Approximately 40 years later, the Oklahoma Legislature authorized an investigation of what really happened to Greenwood District. After a careful study, the committee found that the Black Dispatch and other Black-owned newspapers had told the truth. It was indeed a massacre. Dunjee was a leader in the Oklahoma Youth Legislature, the National Negro Democratic Association, and the Negro Business League. He also served in a leadership role in the NAACP for many years. He played a vital role in desegregating Oklahoma State University in 1948 (Rummel). He also worked for years to desegregate the University of Oklahoma. Dunjee never married, nor had any known children. Roscoe Dunjee felt that something was severely wrong with his health, so he turned the Black Dispatch over to trusted cohorts in 1954. It was the beginning of Alzheimers. After a protracted illness, Roscoe Dunjee died in 1965. Legacy and honors *In 1969 he was inducted posthumously into the Oklahoma Journalist Hall of Fame at Central State University. A portrait of Roscoe hangs in the halls of the Oklahoma Capitol.. At his funeral, it was revealed that Roscoe Dunjee had paid for all of the civil rights litigation in Oklahoma and most of the civil rights litigation in the region. Black Dispatch newspaper Roscoe Dunjee published Oklahoma City‚Äôs first black newspaper, the Black Dispatch, from 1915 to 1954. Its name refers to \\"Black Dispatches\\", the term during the American Civil War for intelligence given to the Union by free or enslaved African Americans in the South.) The Black Dispatch was a member of the Western Negro Press Association during its formative years. It later subscribed to the Associated Negro Press, which boasted of having 112 member newspapers in 1921. Dunjee added the Crusader Service, the Pacific Coast News Bureau, and Preston News Service, among others. When Roscoe's health made it impossible for him to continue to operate the newspaper, he turned it over to trusted allies and friends, including Dr. Gravelly Finley. The Black Dispatch was published up until the mid-1970's. Dr. Finley's medical office had been located in Deep Deuce (a part of Oklahoma City famous for its jazz music) for many years. The Black Dispatch offices were only a stone's throw away from Dr. Finley's medical office. Dr. Finley and Roscoe Dunjee became hard and fast friends and after Roscoe's health began to decline, Dr. Finley made a valiant effort to keep the Black Dispatch going for as long as possible and maintain the high standards set for the newspaper by Roscoe Dunjee.

In the Second World War she was converted into a troop ship. In 1942 a u-boat sank her in the South Atlantic, killing four of Duchess of Atholls crew. 821 survivors were rescued. Cabin liners In the First World War, Canadian Pacific pioneered a new class of passenger accommodation which it called \\"cabin class\\". It superseded both first and second class and proved popular. After that war the number of third class passengers crossing the North Atlantic declined rapidly, and other lines started to copy CP by converting a larger proportion of their accommodation to cabin class. In 1926 Canadian Pacific ordered a set of four new cabin class liners for its North Atlantic service between Britain and Canada. Their accommodation classes were to be \\"cabin\\", \\"tourist\\" and \\"third\\". CP chose the names of the new ships to reflect this revision of classes. Since the 1890s CP had given its most prestigious liners names beginning with \\"Empress of\\", and had given many of its other passenger ships names beginning with \\"M\\". But it named the four new ships after British duchesses, suggesting a status below royalty but above any other rank. Building By the 1920s the marine use of steam turbines was well-established, but the four new ships pioneered the use of much higher-pressure steam than previous ships, which gave them more economical fuel consumption. John Brown & Company built three of the ships at Clydebank. Duchess of Atholl was unique in being built by William Beardmore and Company at Dalmuir, but was otherwise similar to her sisters. Duchess of Atholl was launched in late 1927, before any of her sisters from John Brown & Co. She was launched by Katharine Stewart-Murray, Duchess of Atholl, the Scottish Unionist MP after whom she was named. A silent documentary film made at the time about shipbuilding, Birth of a Liner, includes the launch of Duchess of Atholl and a visit to the John Brown shipyard by the HRH Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, Duchess of York. During Duchess of Atholls fitting-out an accident to one of her turbines delayed her completion until June 1928, at least a month after John Brown & Co completed her sister Duchess of Bedford. Duchess of Atholl was long, had a beam of and draught of . She was and as built she was . She had six water-tube boilers with a combined heating surface of . They supplied steam at 370 lbf/in2 to a set of six steam turbines. These developed a combined power output of 3,557 NHP and drove twin screws via single reduction gearing, giving her a speed of . Civilian service Katharine Stewart-Murray, Duchess of Atholl, after whom the ship was named On 13 July 1928 Duchess of Atholl left Liverpool on her maiden voyage to Montreal, six weeks after Duchess of Bedford. That same year Duchess of Atholl set a record of six days and 13 hours for an eastbound crossing from Canada to Liverpool, but she held the record for only a month. John Brown & Co completed Duchess of Richmond in December 1928 and Duchess of York in March 1929. The regular route for all four sisters was between Liverpool and Quebec. The new ships acquired a bad reputation for \\"lively\\" motion in heavy seas. As a result they became nicknamed the \\"Drunken Duchesses\\". On one eastbound crossing in 1935 Duchess of Atholl lost her rudder. She managed to reach Liverpool three days late. Duchess of Atholl carried wireless direction finding equipment and submarine signalling equipment. Submarine signalling was becoming obsolete as a form of communication, so by 1937 it had been removed and echo sounding equipment had been installed. Duchess of Atholls net register tonnage was slightly revised several times in the 1930s. From 1939 it was listed as . When the Second World War broke out in September 1939 Duchess of Atholl at first continued her scheduled liner service between Liverpool, Montreal and Quebec, taking about eight days for each North Atlantic crossing. This ceased when she reached Liverpool on 27 November. Troop ship Duchess of Atholl was requisitioned in December 1939 and converted into a troop ship. On 4 January 1940 she sailed from the Clyde to the Mediterranean, calling at Gibraltar, Marseille and Malta and reaching Alexandria in Egypt on 19 January. She sailed between Alexandria, Gibraltar, Malta and Marseilles until 5 March 1940, when she left Gibraltar and returned to the Clyde. On 25 March 1940 Duchess of Atholl resumed transatlantic duties, but now bringing Canadian troops to the UK. Her first voyage was unescorted via St John's, Newfoundland to Halifax, Nova Scotia and back. Her second voyage, in June 1940, was with Convoy TC 5, in which she carried 1,173 troops from Halifax to Liverpool. Thereafter she made five unescorted crossings to Canada and back, usually to Montreal and sometimes including Quebec. On 17 November 1940 Duchess of Atholl left Liverpool for Egypt with Convoy WS 4B, which went via Freetown in Sierra Leone and Cape Town in South Africa to Suez. The convoy spent Christmas in the Indian Ocean and reached Suez on 28 December 1940. Duchess of Atholl embarked evacuees and left Suez on 12 January 1941 with Convoy SW 4B, which gave her escorted passage as far as Durban in South Africa. From there she continued unescorted via Cape Town and Freetown and reached Liverpool on 22 February. , which sailed with Duchess of Atholl in Convoy WS 7 in 1941 and Convoy WS 21P in 1942 On 21 March 1941 Duchess of Atholl again left Liverpool for Egypt. She sailed via Freetown to Cape Town with Convoy WS 7, which happened to include her sister ship Duchess of York. Duchess of Atholl then continued unescorted, reaching Suez on 6 May 1941. On 25 May 1941 Duchess of Atholl left Suez on her return voyage, and three days later she reached Aden where she joined Convoy SW 7 to Durban. By the time she left Aden Duchess of Atholls passengers were 629 Merchant Navy personnel. From Durban she continued unescorted via Cape Town, crossed the South Atlantic and reached Trinidad on 14 July. From there she sailed unescorted to the Clyde, where she arrived on 27 July. Records of Duchess of Atholls movements between August and October 1941 records are incomplete. On 30 October she sailed from the Clyde carrying 3,128 troops in Convoy CT 5 to Halifax and on 13 November she left Halifax carrying 2,218 troops in Convoy TC 15 to the Clyde. Duchess of Atholls next voyage was from Scotland to South Africa. She left the Clyde on 8 December with Convoy WS 14 but developed defects and had to turn back. She reached Durban in January, spent a few days in port and then sailed on 21 January for Trinidad, where she arrived on 5 February. She then sailed via Bermuda to New York, where she arrived on 15 February. On 19 February 1942 Duchess of Atholl left New York with Convoy AT 12. She called at Halifax and brought about 3,000 troops across the Atlantic, reaching Belfast on 2 March. Diego-Suarez Bay at the end of Operation Ironclad Duchess of Atholl next took part in the Allied invasion of Vichy French Madagascar. She left Liverpool on 21 March 1942 and joined Convoy WS 17, which took her as far as Freetown. From there she continued to Durban, where she arrived on 23 April. She left Durban five days later as part of the fleet for Operation Ironclad. The fleet landed Allied troops at Diego- Suarez on 5 May and had captured the town by 7 May. Duchess of Atholl left Diego-Suarez on 25 May and sailed unescorted back to Scotland, calling at Durban, Cape Town and Freetown before reaching the Clyde on 27 June. Duchess of Atholl next sailed to Egypt packed with 4,114 troops. With her was her sister Duchess of York, equally packed with 4,004 troops. The pair left the Clyde on 17 July 1942 with Convoy WS 21P, which took the two sisters as far as Freetown. They continued independently via Cape Town and Aden to Suez, where Duchess of Atholl arrived on 2 September and Duchess of York arrived the next day. Three days later Duchess of Atholl began her return voyage to the UK, sailing unescorted and calling at Durban and Cape Town. =Final voyage and loss= On 3 October 1942 Duchess of Atholl left Cape Town unescorted for Freetown, from where she was to continue to the UK. She was carrying 534 passengers: 236 army personnel, 196 naval personnel, 97 RAF personnel, five nurses and 291 civilians, including many women and children. At about 0755 hrs on 10 October the ship was about 200 miles east-northeast of Ascension Island, making a zigzag course, when the German Type IX submarine sighted her at a range of about . U-178 immediately dived and at 0829 hrs fired two torpedoes at the ship's port side. One missed, but the other hit the centre of Duchess of Atholls engine room. The ship lost speed and made an uncontrolled 180 degree turn to port. As her engine room flooded, which soon caused the ship's electric lighting to fail. At 0837 hrs U-178 fired two more torpedoes. Again one missed the ship but the other hit her in roughly the same place as the first. Duchess of Atholls Master, Henry Allinson Moore, gave the order to abandon ship. Three of the ship's lifeboats had been destroyed by the explosions and a fourth was too damaged to be used, but 26 were successfully launched. At 0918 hrs U-178 fired another torpedo, which missed. At 0921 hrs the u-boat fired a final torpedo, which hit Duchess of Atholls starboard side near her foremast. Captain Moore and his senior wireless officer threw all code books, classified documents and nine confidential bags of mail overboard before becoming the last personnel to leave the ship at 0945 hrs. Four crew had been killed but there were 821 survivors, and among them only two passengers and two crew were injured. Some time after 1100 hrs U-178 surfaced. She approached some of the lifeboats, questioned four men about the ship's name, cargo and destination, and then left. Duchess of Atholl sank at 1125 hrs at . =Rescue= HMS Corinthian, converted from an Ellerman Lines cargo steamship, rescued all 821 survivors from Duchess of Atholl The torpedo attack destroyed Duchess of Atholls main wireless. Its operators used an emergency wireless to transmit distress signals, but the attack had also put its receiver out of action so they did not know whether anyone had acknowledged their signal. One of the lifeboats was fitted with a wireless set. After abandoning ship the operators continued to send distress signals, and made contact with the wireless station on Ascension Island. From Ascension Island the ocean boarding vessel HMS Corinthian, a converted Ellerman Lines cargo steamship, put to sea to find the survivors. Corinthian had direction finding equipment with which it tracked the survivors' wireless signals.

The book claims to tell the true story of their family lives, and each chapter is headed 'Piers' or 'Hilary', according to which author wrote it. A film, Hilary and Jackie, was made in 1998 telling essentially the same story, but did not mirror details of events as recounted in the book. The film and the book were both developed simultaneously. This film is not an adaptation of an already-published book. An 'Inside Film' programme, handed out at showings of the film quotes screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce as saying, \\"Hilary was working on the book at the same time as I was working on the film ... it was at a very early stage when we were doing the script.\\" The film was in fact based on conversations with Hilary and Piers, and unlike the book, does not claim to be the true story. This distinction is important because both film and book have attracted intense criticism, especially from music lovers and friends of the cellist, and from her husband, the famous musician and conductor Daniel Barenboim, who feel that they have sullied the memory of her with details of her private life that are either contested or too shocking to be made public.

It was written and directed by Randall Fried, and stars Michael Warren, D.B. Sweeney, Victor Love, Bo Kimble, Richard Jordan and Janet Julian. Telander himself has a cameo appearance in the movie. The film was released on October 4, 1991, by New Line Cinema. Plot Byron Harper operates a non- profit farming system on a playground in the Cabrini Green neighborhood of Chicago with the aim of landing black kids into college basketball programs. He focuses most of his energy on the best prospects, whom he calls his Breds, and ignores the less talented ones. One day, burn-out white lawyer Zack Telander shows up on the playground, willing to play, but Byron believes him to be a drug pusher and throws him out. However, just then one of the Breds is being shot, and Zack happens to be the only one on the spot with a car, so he helps Byron to rush the victim into a hospital, where he also threatens the clerk with a gross negligence lawsuit in case treatment would not be provided. Afterwards Byron reluctantly allows Zack to stay on the playground, but he assigns him to coach a group of players he considers hopeless and derogatory refers to as the Knuckleheads. Both parties immediately dislike the other, and their cooperation does not seem to be promising at all. One of the players, Casey Caldwell was once one of the Breds himself, but was dropped due to his drinking habit, and is making repeated but unsuccessful attempts to regain Byron's trust. Byron's most talented prospect is his adopted son, Truth Harrison, a college junior, who has a 32-point scoring average, but is also developing a cocaine addiction. Byron hopes to turn him pro before his senior year, and tries to arrange a million dollar contract for him with top agent David Racine, for which he also requests Zack's legal counsel. Also present on the playground is Matthew Lockhart, another vastly talented player, who a few years before was recruited by UCLA, but then quit team play entirely, and since then only plays on his own. Zack manages to gain his trust, and Matthew reveals that he was deliberately injured by Truth on their senior night, when he outplayed him, and he was so disgusted of the entire system, that he decided to quit afterwards. Zack and his team, now calling themselves the Shooting Stars, are getting on more friendly terms, but are unsuccessful on the court. Zack repeatedly asks them to play as a team, and not as a group of individuals, but with no success. They continue suffering lopsided defeats from both the Breds and a team of ex-cons, led by pro player Luther Hakim. Meanwhile, Truth's cocaine problems are deteriorating, and he is unable to cope with the pressure surrounding pro-life. He runs off from a meeting with media members, then later shows up high on drugs at Byron's house, forcing Zack to lead him to Matthew, whom he wants to challenge to play one-on-one, but Matthew outclasses him. Byron and Zack then convince him to postpone his pro career and finish college first, but he angrily rushes off when the college coach demands that he starts to attend therapy with his problems. Instead he goes to Racine on his own and signs the contract he is handed, only to learn that he wouldn't see any money until finishing a rehabilitation program. He then returns to the slums from where Byron once saved him. Racine's assistant Dalton Ellis turns up and tells him that Byron took advantage of him for his own profit, which prompts him to angrily confront Byron and cut ties with him. Abandoned by everyone, one night he overdoses cocaine, and dies. Byron and Zack confront Racine in his office and get physical with him, for which they get arrested and imprisoned. After being released, they visit Matthew and try to convince him to play again, but he refuses, saying that he does not want to be \\"the next Truth\\". The story culminates in another game between the Stars and the Breds. Zack's team shows more resistance this time, but are still headed to a large scale defeat, and are still unable to play as a team. Zack desperately calls for a timeout and begs them to play for their pride, which seems to have some effect, but soon afterwards Casey is injured and has to leave the field. As they have no reserves, the game is called off, when Matthew unexpectedly emerges from among the spectators, and joins Zack's team. The game continues, led by Matthew and with the rest of the team finally playing as a unit, the Stars are closing the gap, and ultimately win the game by a long distance shot from the returning Casey. Following the game, Matthew tells Byron that he is now ready to join UCLA. Byron changes his priorities, and decides to take care to all of his players; as a start he is sending Casey to play for the University of Alaska. He also offers a partnership to Zack, who accepts it, and they plan to operate the playground together in the future. Cast *Michael Warren as Byron Harper *D.B. Sweeney as Zack Telander *Victor Love as Truth Harrison *Bo Kimble as Matthew Lockhart *Richard Jordan as David Racine *Janet Julian as Dalton Ellis *Nigel Miguel as Casey Caldwell *Cylk Cozart as Andre *Terry Bradley as Herc *Hakeem Olajuwon as Luther Hakim *Rick Telander as Bartender *Kendall Gill as Bred ball player Production The project was in development since the early 1980s, and when Fried acquired the rights to direct the film in 1986, Michael Jordan, at the beginning of his professional career, was pursued to play the role of Matthew Lockhart. But when finance basis was established for the film in 1990, and actual shooting was about to start, Jordan, who was then already an international star, withdrew from the project, and the role eventually went to Bo Kimble. In 1998 the filmmakers sued Jordan citing a breach-of-contract and seeking $16 million, claiming that Jordan's absence caused the movie's box office flop and the failure of Fried's career, who otherwise \\"would have been the next Steven Spielberg\\", according to his attorney. The jury found Jordan not liable, and awarded him $50,000 following a countersue. Although Jordan himself did not participate in the movie, his long time body double Nigel Miguel did appear in the role of Casey Caldwell. Terry Bradley, who portrayed Herc, was a former Chicago State basketball player, who was drafted by the Chicago Bulls in 1983, one year before Jordan, but eventually never played in the NBA.  Reception  The film was reviewed by the Chicago Tribune and Roger Ebert, the latter of whom wrote that \\"the movie meanders and loses its way, drags to a halt when it should be most exciting, and goes through strange shifts in tone and style.\\" * References External links * * Category:1991 films Category:American films Category:American basketball films Category:American drama films Category:American independent films ","title":"Heaven Is a Playground (film)"},{"id":"45331100","text":"Yu with diaeresis (–ÆÃà —éÃà; italics: –ÆÃà —éÃà) is a letter of the Cyrillic script.

It was announced on 24 June 2014 and it was chaired by Sir Robert Francis. The review was originally expected to report in November 2014 but took longer because of a huge volume of input material: 17,500 online responses and 600 postal responses. The report was published on 11 February 2015. Recommendations Francis outlined twenty principles and associated actions, then concluded by making just two recommendations: # for all NHS organisations and regulators to implement all the principles and actions; # for the Secretary of State to review progress annually. The twenty principles to allow a consistent approach to raising concerns, while still allowing some flexibility, included: * Culture of raising concerns - to make raising issues a part of normal routine business of any well-led NHS organisation. * Culture free from bullying - freedom of staff to speak out relies on staff being able to work in a culture which is free from bullying. * Training - every member of staff should receive training in their trust's approach to raising concerns and in receiving and acting on them. * Support - all NHS trusts should ensure there is a dedicated person to whom concerns can be easily reported and without formality, a \\"Freedom to Speak Up Guardian\\" . * Support to find alternative employment in the NHS - where a worker who has raised a concern cannot, as a result, continue their role, the NHS should help them seek an alternative job.

Stevens House and the George W. Richards House, is a historic house at 59 Court Street in Houlton, Maine. Built c. 1872 as a fine example of Second Empire architecture, it underwent a significant alteration between 1906 and 1912 in which high-quality Craftsman styling was introduced to its interior. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009 for its architectural significance. Description and history The Elms is set on the west side of Court Street (United States Route 1) south of Houlton's central business district, on a residential stretch of the road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, three bays wide, with a mansard roof and clapboard siding. A single-story porch extends across the front, topped by a shallow hip roof and supported by paired paneled square posts. The house corners have paneled pilasters matching the porch post in detail. The roof is a flared bell-cast mansard roof with asphalt shingles, with dormers topped by segmented-arch gables and framed by decorative woodwork. A two-story ell extends to the rear of the house. The interior of the house, which follows a central hall plan, contains a mix of Second Empire and Craftsman styling. The former is represented by thick doors and high-profile trim around doorways and windows, while the latter includes embossed leather wall coverings, art glass windows, and decorative mahogany woodwork. The main staircase features a figured oak base, turned balusters, and sunburst carvings on the newel posts. The entry hall and living room both have pressed tin coffered ceilings. The living room has a fireplace decorated with brick and multicolored terra-cotta moulding and tile. The library, which was completely redone in the Craftsman style, with a coffered beam ceiling, a builtin secretary with leaded glass door, and wall sconces of iron and mica. The Elms was built c. 1872 by Boardman J. Stevens, the owner of a local shoe and bootmaking shop, and originally included a carriage house. The property was purchased in 1901 by George W. Richards, a dry goods business owner who was one of Aroostook County's most successful businessmen of the period. Richards was responsible for the renovation of the house's interior, and for widening the front porch. The property was for some time used as a boarding house, as evidenced by numbers on some of its bedroom doors.

The story was based on Marie Corelli's 1887 novel of the same name, it focuses on a Norwegian maiden who meets Sir Phillip and the two are wed. Lady Clara conspires to ruin the marriage and tricks Thelma with a letter purported to be from her husband. Thelma returns to Norway and to the death of her father. Thelma, alone in the world, prays at her mother's grave for strength. Sir Phillip searches for Thelma, ultimately finding her, uncovers the tricks which have been played on them and they fall back in love. Released on June 21, 1910, the film was met with praise in The Moving Picture World. An incomplete print of the film survives in the Library of Congress archives.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a surviving synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World on June 25, 1910. It states: \\"Thelma is a simple Norwegian maiden living alone with her father in the land of the midnight sun. Her father is one of the few remaining Vikings, famous in history. As such he is held in great reverence by his servants, who consider him somewhat in the nature of a king, and his daughter a princess. Outside of the years spent at school, Thelma has spent nearly all her time alone, her mother having died when she was a baby. When on a visit to her mother's grave, Thelma meets Sir Philip Errington, a distinguished young Englishman, who is touring Norway in his private yacht. Sir Philip is instantly attracted to her and, obtaining information as to where she lives, presents himself to Olaf, the Viking, and is finally admitted to his friendship and that of his daughter. Sir Philip woos and wins the fair Thelma for his bride, and with her sails back to England. In London, Thelma at once creates a favorable impression and is cordially welcomed by all of Sir Philip's friends, who comprise the nobility and aristocracy of the metropolis. Lady Clara, alone, of all Sir Philip's old friends, wishes Thelma harm. She has long felt an affection for Sir Phillip, and resents the fact that he spurned her love and chose his bride in far-off Norway. This wicked and designing woman determines to wreck Thelma's happiness, and force her to leave England. This she contrives to do, in making Thelma believe that Sir Philip no longer loves her, but that in truth his heart belongs to Lady Clara. As proof of her statement she shows Thelma a letter written to her by Sir Philip in which he pleads the cause of his friend, who is in love with Lady Clara, and wishes her to become his wife. This Lady Clara claims is a love letter written by Sir Philip to her. Thelma, heartbroken, believing she has lost her husband's love, returns to Norway, just as her father, the Viking, breathes his last. She, with his faithful followers, complies with his last wishes, which are that he shall be buried as his forefathers were before him ‚Äì sent out to sea in his burning ship. This form of burial had been that accorded to all Vikings for centuries past. After straining her eyes for a final look at the departing ship, Thelma retraces her steps to her mother's grave, and there, feeling that she is absolutely alone, prays for the strength to live. Here in a rocky dell before the tomb of her mother, where first she met the man who won her heart, Sir Philip again finds Thelma. A few words suffice to show her how she has been tricked, and a fervent protestation of his love convinces her that she still has a place in his heart. In Sir Philip's arms she finds comfort for the loss of her father; she starts out bravely to again face the world, now sure of his unending love.\\"  Cast  *Anna Rosemond as Thelma *Frank H. Crane as Sir Philip Errington *Yvonne Marvin as Lady Clara Ashley *Alphonse Ethier as Viking Olaf  Production  Thelma is a film adaptation of the 1887 novel of the same name. It was written under the pen name Marie Corelli by Mary Mackay. During the era, her novels were so well-known that some reviewers did not need to include a summary of the plot of the film to reader. A brief review in The Moving Picture World went so far as to say, \\"Practically everybody has read the novel, hence no long explanation is required.\\" Film historian Q. David Bowers, states, \\"Although present-day scholars consider her works to be of no serious literary importance, she is remembered by the science-fiction world for her vivacious imagination and her \\"scientific discoveries,\\" including interstellar travel via personal electricity. Her writings were known in her time for sublimated sex, fervent religiosity, and far-fetched fantasy.\\" The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. He was the most important script writer for Thanhouser, averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film assigns Theodore Marston as the director this film, but this would seem to be in error. The apparent origin of this error is from the American Film-Index 1908‚Äì1915. Bowers consulted one of the co-authors of the book, Gunnar Lundquist, and confirmed that the credit of Marston was in error. Theodore Marston worked with Path√©, Kinemacolor, Vitagraph and other companies, but there is no record of Marston working with Thanhouser. Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Cast in the role of Thelma was Anna Rosemond, one of two leading ladies, of the Thanhouser Company at the time. The more minor role of Sir Philip Errington was played by Frank H. Crane, who acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser. The conspiring Lady Clara Ashley was played by Yvonne Marvin, an actress that Bowers cites as her first and only known credit with Thanhouser. The role of Thelma's father was played by Alphonse Ethier, a stage actor who had intermittent credited appearances in Thanhouser productions.  Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1000 feet long, was released on June 21, 1910. A review in The Moving Picture World praised the film by stating, \\"The picture is admirably staged and acted and maintains the interest from beginning to end. Of course the picture does not contain the detail of the novel, but it is a distinct improvement upon the play. It deserves a long run.\\" Identifying the theaters in which the film was shown is made difficult by the number of Thelma plays and later Selig Polyscope's own version of Thelma which appeared in 1911. The popularity of the play predates the film adaptation by Thanhouser, one of the troupes to perform the play in 1910 were the Preston & Brickett Majestic Players. Once the Selig film was released, the two productions were often not distinguished in advertisements. One of the last known advertisements, conclusively for the Thanhouser production, was in 1913. An incomplete 35 mm print of the film survives in the Library of Congress archives. This print is missing the main title, credits, and likely the conclusion of the film. Only the funeral scene shows red film tinting.

Plot Under the family Christmas tree, a young girl finds that she has been given a collection of new toys. Happily taking them in her arms, she tosses aside her old rag doll. That night, the girl dreams that the rag doll, abandoned on the floor, comes silently to life to entertain her. The rag doll dances across a piano and skates across a table. The new toys, also coming to life, join the antics. The rag doll, turning on an electric fan, is blown about and nearly knocks over a vase as it attempts to avoid falling off the table. The girl, getting out of bed, saves the vase and takes the doll in her arms. The girl wakes up to find her rag doll still on the floor. Production and release The film was Karel Zeman's first experiment in combining stop- motion animation with live-action footage, a process he continued to explore in his later feature films, beginning with Journey to the Beginning of Time (1955) and The Fabulous World of Jules Verne (1958). The pioneering animator Herm√≠na T√Ωrlov√° also reportedly participated in the production. In the United States, the film was released by Universal-International in 1948. An abridgement of the American version for home projection was sold by Castle Films from 1949 through 1965. The American version replaces the wordless Czech soundtrack with new audio, including a voice for the rag doll; it also includes new footage in which Santa Claus, appearing by magic, sends the Christmas dream to the girl. Reception In their history of Eastern European films, Mira Liehm and Anton√≠n J. Liehm called A Christmas Dream \\"a classic of its genre.\\" Scott MacGillivray, in a review of the Castle Films version, wrote that \\"the Zemans' stop-motion effects are truly extraordinary.\\" Le Parisien called the film \\"magical\\" and rated it four stars out of a possible four. The film was screened at the 1946 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Grand Prix International for best short fiction film.

An architecturally eclectic mix of Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, and Italianate styling, the house was built c. 1855 on a site overlooking the Penobscot River. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 for its architectural significance. Description The Emery House is sited on a rise north of Main Street, on the western fringe of the town's central business district. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a cross-gable roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. Its main facade is divided into three major sections. The leftmost section has a front-gable roof, with broad pilasters and a polygonal projecting bay on the first floor, topped by a balustrade, with a Gothic arched window in the gable above. The center section consists of a large square tower, its upper portion finished in diamond-cut shingles. Its corners are pilastered similarly to the left section, and the tower is topped by a turned balustrade. The right section of the house has a side-gable roof, with an engaged porch supported by Greek Revival columns. A tall dormer projects to the front, with a Gothic arched window. The house has two tall brick chimneys, each of which has a projecting course, and a crenellated top. The house was built c. 1855 by James Emery, and it was, at the time of its listing in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, still in the hands of his descendants. The only significant alteration to the exterior has been the removal of the uppermost stage of the tower. The building drew local notice when it was built, for its distinctive amalgamation of styles. Its designer is unknown.

From the southern bank (cityside), the bridge was reached by following China Lane and Bridge Lane, leading across to what is now the vicinity of Our Lady's Catholic College. Early history The existence of the bridge was mentioned in an official document as far back as 1216 in the reign of King John of England. It was then a wooden bridge and the Abbot of Furness was made liable to provide timber for its upkeep. During the Jacobite rising of 1715 the town governor, Colonel Charteris, was prevented from destroying the bridge for defensive reasons by the townsfolk, who pointed out that the river below was fordable and the destruction of the bridge would serve no purpose. Gradual demolition In 1782 the condition of the bridge was so bad that Parliament passed a bill for its replacement. Several accidents had been caused by gaps in the parapet. In 1800 John Brockbank, who owned land nearby, offered to buy the bridge for ¬£250, enabling compensation to be paid to the owner of the site of the proposed new bridge. In 1802 the first arch at the Skerton (northern) end was demolished to allow the passage of ships, including ships built upstream of the bridge at Brockbank's shipyard. A second arch fell down in 1807 as a result of floods. The third arch gave way in 1814 and the remaining pier, although shored up, collapsed into the river in 1845. Legacy in culture Though information on the Old Loyne Bridge is difficult to access, there are numerous references in published literature to what was Lancaster's principal line of communication, as well as cultural artefacts, including the following: =Poetry abridged from Gleanings in Local History= > \\"Thou hast stood old Neptune's billows, > In the ages gone, > Lash'd by Tim's relentless willows, > Till at length undone. > Many an eye hath watch'd in sorrow, > Foemen thous hast led, > Many a warrior e're the morrow, > Fallen by thee dead. > Native feet and feet of strangers, > Thou o'er Loyne hast borne, > Pictish Clansmen, Danish Rangers, > Heedless of their scorn. > Many a Knight in robe escallop'd, > Arm'd for the affray, > On his steed has proudly gallop'd, > O'er thy lofty way. > Storm and sunshine, peace and battle, > Thou of old hast known, > While the children's merry prattle, > Did for strife atone. > Oft the Sun in splendour shining, > Hath thy corbels charm'd, > Sylvan warblers thus inclining, > To a song thrice warm'd. > Cere's sons around have labour'd, > As those wood nymphs sang, > And the little ones have tabour'd, > While the joy bells rang. > Counting beads in deep contrition, > Saints have o'er thee pass'd, > Thinking of the great transition, > Bridge of Death at last. > Thou art vanish'd ‚Äì of thy glory, > Bards alone may tell, > But, old bridge, in ancient story, > Thou shall ever dwell.\\" References External links * * - Picture of bridge Category:Bridges in Lancashire Category:Demolished bridges in England Category:Buildings and structures demolished in the 19th century Category:Buildings and structures in Lancaster, Lancashire ","title":"Old Loyne Bridge"},{"id":"45331409","text":"Johannes Jonathan Smit (born 10 November 1995) is a Namibian cricketer who made his senior debut for the Namibian national side in February 2012, aged 16.

Opened in 2006, it primarily replaced Barrow Hospital, providing psychiatric inpatient and community services for Bristol and the surrounding region. It is run by the Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust. History =Construction= In the early 2000s, a replacement was required for Barrow Hospital, which was built in 1939. By 2002, a site was chosen for the new hospital; surplus council allotments on Callington Road, Brislington; adjacent to the former Brislington Railway Station. Avon and Wiltshire Partnership faced opposition from a local community group who felt the site was too close to a school, and mental health charity MIND who felt the area was too noisy, however in 2003 Bristol City Council sold the former allotments and construction began. Callington Road Hospital was completed and opened in 2006. A condition of planning approval was that funds be provided to develop neighbouring land into a nature reserve, which was opened in 2009. The grounds were landscaped to include paths, water features and gardens with interpretation boards. The allotments previously on the site supported badgers, slow worms and various birds. Consideration of the ecological aspects of the site was required by Bristol City Council for project approval. =Alterations= Acer Unit (drug and alcohol rehab) was initially based at Callington Road, but in 2011 swapped buildings with Elizabeth Casson House (female PICU) and is now based at Blackberry Hill Hospital. Callington Road was the location of Bristol's one-bed Place Of Safety until the four-bed Mason Unit was opened at Southmead Hospital in 2014. Both Lime and Silver Birch Acute Wards were originally built with attached High Dependency Units (HDU's); both were decommissioned in line with trust-wide changes. =Projects= A series of arts projects were run at Callington Road, for adults within the hospital. Led by a poet, a musician and a visual artist, the project culminated in a booklet of poems, a CD and a series of felt collages. The work was jointly funded by the mental health trust and city council. Services The hospital provides the following services: =Inpatient= * Lime Unit and Silver Birch Unit - adult acute wards * Hazel Unit - psychiatric intensive care unit (male) * Elizabeth Casson House - psychiatric intensive care unit (female) * Alder Unit - rehabilitation and re-ablement * Aspen Ward - older adults (functional illnesses) * Laurel Ward - older adults (organic illnesses) \\\\- temporarily closed because of unspecified \\"safety-related concerns\\" * Linden Unit - electroconvulsive therapy service * Larch Step Down - rehabilitation * Art Psychotherapy, Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy and Nutrition & Diatetics are available on site. =Community= * The Crisis Team * The Complex Interventions Team - specialist older adults community mental health service * The Bristol Active Life Project * Dementia Wellbeing Service - a partnership of the Alzheimer's Society and Devon Partnership NHS Trust =Service-user and non-NHS led services= A self-help group run by Bristol Hearing Voices Network is held at Callington Road. The mental health charity Rethink runs a carers' art group and carers' gardening club on site. Callington Road Hospital does not provide Secure (forensic) Mental Health Services; which are provided at Blackberry Hill Hospital, or Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), including Eating Disorders); which are provided at Southmead and the Riverside Unit. Performance A Care Quality Commission inspection in 2014 found most standards were met, however standards for record keeping and risk management were not met. This followed police concerns over the number of patients absconding while on leave from the hospital.

In 1902 it was reported that she had been bridesmaid to Lady Helen Stewart (daughter of Charles Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 6th Marquess of Londonderry), who married Giles Fox-Strangways, 6th Earl of Ilchester. In 1903, she was bridesmaid for Mary Willoughby, who was marrying Arthur Ramsay, 14th Earl of Dalhousie. She had her coming-out in 1915. Marriages Gwladys's first marriage took place in 1920 to Sir Charles Markham of Newstead Abbey, the son of the late Sir Arthur Markham. The grand wedding was reported in detail in The Yorkshire Post. She divorced him in 1927. The following year she married Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere, thirty years her senior, in Nairobi. Lord Delamere died in November 1931, at the age of 61, leaving Gwladys Lady Delamere as his widow. Kenya In 1928, Gwladys travelled to Kenya with the Prince of Wales. Her social behaviour drew attention ‚Äì Isak Dinesen wrote in November that \\"Lady Delamere behaved scandalously at supper, I thought; she bombarded the Prince of Wales with big pieces of bread ... and finished up by rushing at him, overturning his chair and rolling him around on the floor.\\" Letter written to Ingeborg Dinesen from Isak in Ngong, Kenya dated Sun 11th Nov 1928 However, during the 1929-31 famine when the Soysambu area was devastated by locusts, Gwladys took over the management of a hotel Delamere opened in Iringa in 1926 and made it pay its way. Despite Dinesen's 1928 comments, the Delameres were back in the Prince's company in 1930. =Mayor of Nairobi= In 1934, Gwladys was elected to Nairobi Council. She became deputy mayor on 2 July 1935. She visited England to stay at Wilton, Wiltshire for Christmas 1936. She returned, after a well-attended leaving party thrown by her parents, reportedly to take up the office of mayor. The Yorkshire Post explained that she had become the first woman member of the Municipal Council (\\"second only to the Legislative Council\\") two years previously. She had become deputy mayor after one year and then acting mayor for six months while the mayor was sick. She was asked in July 1936 to become mayor but asked to defer this until after her visit to England. The article went on to discuss the challenges of urban growth facing Nairobi at the time and noted that the Council's duties included brewing and retailing beer along similar lines to the England's State Management Scheme experiment in Carlisle. If she had become mayor on her return in 1937, she would have succeeded Thomas Alfred Wood who had previously been mayor in 1927-29 when Gladwys first arrived in Kenya. She actually held the post for three terms from 1938. \\"In 1934, Gladys Delamere gained election to the council where she did such an outstanding job that four years later she became mayor, an office she held for three terms. As mayor she especially initiated anti-poverty programmes in Nairobi's ghettos and helped europeans left financially stranded by the depression. Because Gladys helped both blacks and whites, some people criticised her unmercifully.\\" It was reported at the time that her 1939 election for her second term was unopposed by Indian members of the council. =Trial of Sir Delves Broughton= In 1941 she gave evidence for the prosecution at the White Mischief trial. In dramatisations of events surrounding the trial, her character was played by Susan Fleetwood in the film White Mischief (1987) and on television by Julia St. John in Julian Fellowes Investigates: A Most Mysterious Murder (2005) - episode 4 The Case of the Earl of Erroll. Death Gwladys died on 22 February 1943. Her obituaries confined themselves to her position as Mayor of Nairobi and her CBE. Her funeral was attended by the Governor of Kenya and Commander-in-Chief in East Africa. Her coffin was carried by representatives of the three fighting services. The Times reported that among the wreaths was one from General Smuts, the Prime Minister of South Africa. In The Ghosts of Happy Valley: Searching for the Lost World of Africa's Infamous Aristocrats, Juliet Barnes writes that Gwladys was sometimes portrayed as \\"a bossy, bitchy and emotionally unbalanced woman, endlessly carousing at Muthaiga Club with Happy Valleyites\\" but also \\"how she selflessly looked after Delamere in his twilight years. She was apparently highly popular and during the war she always made all ranks welcome at her Loresho home, unlike many more snobbish families.\\" She later gave the home to the Kenya Red Cross Service. Gwladys returned to the news in 2007 when there was media interest surrounding the trial of Thomas P. G. Cholmondeley, Delamere's great-grandson, for shooting a poacher. While that was taking place, Gwladys's grave was desecrated and the police looked for a connection with the trial.

First founded in 1868 it was sometimes united with the Tyne Electrical Engineers, at other times it formed an independent unit. Although its main role was defence of the North East Coast of England, the unit sent detachments on active service to the Suakin Expedition, the Second Boer War, and the Western Front and Italy during the First World War. Volunteer Force In 1868 a new unit of Engineer Volunteers (EV) was formed at Jarrow on the County Durham bank of the River Tyne. The 1st Durham EV was raised and commanded by Charles Palmer (1822‚Äì1907), founder of Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company and later the first mayor and Member of Parliament for Jarrow.Burke. The 1st Durham initially comprised six companies and Palmer was commissioned as Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant.Beckett, Appendix IXOfficial Army List 1868‚Äì88.Westlake, p. 7.Durham Fortress Engineers at Regiments.org By 1874 the 1st Durham EV (now 8 companies strong) and the 1st Newcastle EV (1 company) were united into the 1st Durham Administrative Battalion EV, consolidated in 1880 as the 1st Newcastle upon Tyne and Durham EV, with Palmer as commanding officer and an establishment of 1300 men.Short et al., p. 2. In 1885, the Inspector-General of Fortifications, Lieutenant- General Sir Andrew Clarke, sent a detachment of Volunteers to the Red Sea port of Suakin to assist the Regular Royal Engineers (RE) in railway construction for the British force engaged there. The detachment of 40 men was drawn from the 1st Newcastle & Durham EV and the 1st Lancashire EV.Beckett, p. 184 Palmer, by now created Sir Charles Palmer, 1st Baronet of Grinkle Park, retired from the unit in 1888 with the rank of Colonel. The same year, the 1st Newcastle & Durham was split into three separate units: the 1st Durham RE (Volunteers), at Jarrow, and the Tyne Division RE (V), Submarine Miners at North Shields, with Palmer as Honorary Commandant of both units,Official Army List January 1889.Short et al, pp. 4‚Äì5.Westlake, p. 15.Tyne Electrical Engineers at Regiments.org together with a new 1st Newcastle-on-Tyne RE (V) at Newcastle.Westlake, p. 13. The 1st Durham RE (V) sent a detachment of one officer and 25 other ranks to assist the regular REs during the Second Boer War in 1900, and a second section the following year.Watson, pp. 42‚Äì3.North East War Memorials Project, Ref J2.04 Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908, the original plan was for the 1st Durham RE to provide the 1st Northumbrian Field Company and Divisional Signal Company in the TF's Northumbrian Division.London Gazette, 20 March 1908. However, by 1910 this plan had been altered, and instead the 1st Durham was redesignated the Durham Fortress Engineers, with the addition of an Electric Light Company provided by the Tyne Electrical Engineers (formerly Submarine Miners).London Gazette, 14 October 1910.Short et al., p. 29. The organisation of the unit on the eve of the First World War was as follows:Monthly Army List, August 1914.RE Fortress Companies at Long, Long TrailWatson & Rinaldi, p. 12. Durham Fortress Engineers, RE * HQ at Western Road, Jarrow * No 1 Works Company at Jarrow * No 2 Works Company at Jarrow * No 3 Works Company at Gateshead The unit formed part of North Eastern Coastal Defences. First World War Shoulder title of Durham Territorial Engineers When the TF was mobilised on the outbreak of war in August 1914, the Durham Fortress Engineers took up their places in the North Eastern Coastal Defences. At first they were employed on constructing field defences, erecting hutted camps, etc. By the summer of 1915 there were three strong lines of entrenchments, bomb-proof shelters and dug-outs linking strongpoints and gun positions along the coast as well as the fixed defences at Tynemouth and Hartlepool. In August 1916 the Durham Fortress Engineers overcame shifting sand dunes to construct Link House Battery to defend Blyth Harbour.Short et al., pp. 44, 52, 56. Although the coastal towns of NE England were bombarded by the German Navy on 16 December 1914 (Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby) and by Zeppelins in January and June 1915, it became clear that a fullscale German invasion of Britain was unlikely, while the armies in the field required large numbers of engineers. The Fortress Engineer units therefore began organising field companies for overseas service.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 62, 69. The Durham Fortress Engineers found three field companies, while the remainder of the unit continued to be employed around the Tyne Garrison. These companies were numbered 1st to 3rd (or formally 1/1st to 1/3rd, since they were composed of '1st-Line' Territorials who had volunteered for overseas service) and went to France in September 1915. A 530th (Durham) Reserve Field Company was also formed, from 2nd or even 3rd Line Territorials. This did not proceed overseas, and was probably quickly absorbed into the central training organisation.RE Museum list of WWI unit war diaries. =1st Durham Field Company= 1st Durham Field Company joined 4th Division in France on 20 September 1915 and served with it on the Western Front to the end of the war.

It was renumbered 527th (Durham) Field Company, RE, in February 1917.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 65‚Äì71.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 28. =3rd Durham Field Company= 3rd Durham Field Company landed at Le Havre on 18 September 1915 and joined 51st (Highland) Division on 19 September, during the latter part of the Battle of the Somme. On 30 January 1916 it transferred to 7th Division (in exchange for a Highland Field Company) and served with it on the Western Front until November 1917 when the division was transferred to the Italian front. 7th Division then served in Italy until the end of the war. It was renumbered 528th (Durham) Field Company, RE, in February 1917.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 81‚Äì7.Becke, Pt 2a, p. 103.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 28 & 35. Inter-War period When the TF was reconstituted (as the Territorial Army (TA)) in 1920, the Durham Fortress Engineers was not reformed, but was absorbed into the Tyne Electrical Engineers. Post-Second World War When the TA was reconstituted again in 1947, no less than seven units were reformed in the Tyne Electrical Engineers' lineage. These included 132 Field Engineer Regiment, RE, which was considered to be the successor of the Durham Fortress Engineers, with the following organisation:118‚Äì432 Rgts RE at British Army 1945 on.Graham Watson, The Territorial Army 1947 at Orbat.com Watson & Rinaldi, p. 297.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 304. 132 Field Engineer Regiment, RE (TA) * HQ at Sunderland * 333 Field Squadron ‚Äì redesignated 608 Field Squadron in 1953 * 334 Field Squadron * 335 Field Squadron ‚Äì transferred to 118 Construction Regiment, RE, in 1950 * 336 Field Park Squadron The unit formed part of 22 Engineer Group in North East England, which was composed of units derived from the Tyne Electrical Engineers.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 287.Engineer Gps at British Army 1945 on. On 31 October the regiment was joined by a new field squadron formed by conversion of 426th (Durham) Coast Regiment, Royal Artillery. It was numbered 336 Fd Sqn and absorbed the existing 336 Fd Park Sqn; it was redesignated 336 (Durham Coast) Crane Operating Squadron by 31 December 1956. The regiment was redesignated 132 Corps Engineer Regiment in 1957, but was disbanded in 1961. 336 Crane Operating Sqn had left the regiment in 1957; in 1965 it transferred to the Royal Corps of Transport. The regiment was disbanded in 1961, 608 Sqn disbanding and 334 Fd Sqn being absorbed into the Sunderland-based 233 Field Squadron of 105 Construction Regiment (Tyne Electrical Engineers).Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 291, 301.

In 1977, a live version of the song was released as a single from the album Face to Face: A Live Recording. Original studio version =Background= Following the split of the original Cockney Rebel line-up in July 1974, Harley assembled a new line-up later in the year and renamed the band Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel. In November-December 1974, the new band recorded The Best Years of Our Lives album at Abbey Road Studios and Air Studios in London. In 2014, Harley recalled of the song's recording: \\"We played it live in the studio, all sat round together. There were no overdubs, and we all wanted to get the feel of the song on record.\\" When the band performed the song live at the Hammersmith Odeon on 14 April 1975, Harley announced the track as \\"the most serious song I've ever wrote in my life\\". Since then, the song has consistently been a popular inclusion at Harley and the band's concerts. In 2014, EMI released a definitive edition of the album as a four CD + DVD box-set. On disc one, a previously unreleased acoustic demo of \\"The Best Years of Our Lives\\" was included. In an online diary entry, Harley said of the demo: =Critical reception= Upon release, Record & Popswap Mirror reviewed The Best Years of Our Lives and said: \\"Each song has a distinct character, culminating in the personal message - the title track.\\" In the liner notes of the 2014 definitive edition, Geoff Barton wrote how the song saw Harley \\"reprising the hard-bitten troubadour persona he adopted on Cockney Rebel's first two albums\\", adding that it \\"somehow manages to be both triumphant and mournful at the same time\\". Donald A. Guarisco of AllMusic retrospectively highlighted the song as one of the album's \\"standouts\\". He described it as \\"a touching acoustic ballad that highlights some of Harley's most direct and emotional lyrics\\".

A number of concerts were recorded on the tour, along with the band's one-off charity concert at London Rainbow in February 1977. Harley then selected the best tracks for release on a double live album. A day before its release, the band's split was announced. Face to Face: A Live Recording was released in July 1977 and reached at No. 40 in the UK.http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/18068/steve-harley/ To promote the album, a live single was released in August, with \\"The Best Years of Our Lives\\" chosen as the A-side, and \\"Tumbling Down\\" as the B-side.

It serves as the primary route northwards, on account of a one-way system that directs all southbound traffic over Skerton Bridge. Originally built to carry a railway, it is the third bridge to stand on the present site and lies between the Lune Millennium Bridge and Skerton Bridge. History The first bridge on the site was constructed out of laminated timber in 1848 to carry the Morecambe Harbour and Railway Company's new railway, linking the adjoining Lancaster Green Ayre railway station to Morecambe Harbour. That was replaced by a wrought iron viaduct during 1862‚Äì64, and by the third and current bridge in 1911. Material salvaged from the demolition of the second bridge was used in the 1913 reconstruction of what is now the \\"Old Halton Railway Bridge\\", further up the River Lune, on the same railway line. After the closure of the railway in 1966, the Greyhound Bridge was converted for use by road traffic, and re-opened in 1972. It now carries in excess of 20,000 northbound vehicles a day. Significance The structure is notable for its westward curve, onto the northern bank of the River Lune; a feature that has been prominent on the landscape, since at least the wrought- iron second incarnation of the bridge, completed in 1864. With overhead electrification of the Lancaster‚ÄìMorecambe Line in 1908, it is very possible that the Greyhound Bridge may have been the first bridge in the United Kingdom to carry electrified rolling stock, owing to it being the only bridge on that section of line. Closure Lancashire County Council have stated that the bridge requires substantial maintenance in order to avoid a weight limit being placed on it. These works are anticipated to cost ¬£3.7 million and are expected to result in the bridge being closed for 23 weeks between January and August 2018.. During this time the nearby Skerton Bridge will be adapted to carry vehicles in two directions. These changes have been criticised by local bus users who feel that the removal of two sections of bus priority lanes will increase journey times across the river. However, without these works, buses would not have been able to use the Greyhound bridge from 2019 due to the proposed weight restriction.

If infinitely many numbers have their reciprocals summed, generally the terms are given in a certain sequence and the first n of them are summed, then one more is included to give the sum of the first n+1 of them, etc. If only finitely many numbers are included, the key issue is usually to find a simple expression for the value of the sum, or to require the sum to be less than a certain value, or to determine whether the sum is ever an integer. For an infinite series of reciprocals, the issues are twofold: First, does the sequence of sums diverge‚Äîthat is, does it eventually exceed any given number‚Äîor does it converge, meaning there is some number that it gets arbitrarily close to without ever exceeding it? (A set of positive integers is said to be large if the sum of its reciprocals diverges, and small if it converges.) Second, if it converges, what is a simple expression for the value it converges to, is that value rational or irrational, and is that value algebraic or transcendental?Unless given here, references are in the linked articles. Finitely many terms *The harmonic mean of a set of positive integers is the number of numbers times the reciprocal of the sum of their reciprocals. *The optic equation requires the sum of the reciprocals of two positive integers a and b to equal the reciprocal of a third positive integer c. All solutions are given by a = mn + m2, b = mn + n2, c = mn. This equation appears in various contexts in elementary geometry. *The Fermat‚ÄìCatalan conjecture concerns a certain Diophantine equation, equating the sum of two terms, each a positive integer raised to a positive integer power, to a third term that is also a positive integer raised to a positive integer power (with the base integers having no prime factor in common). The conjecture asks whether the equation has an infinitude of solutions in which the sum of the reciprocals of the three exponents in the equation must be less than 1. The purpose of this restriction is to preclude the known infinitude of solutions in which two exponents are 2 and the other exponent is any even number. *The n-th harmonic number, which is the sum of the reciprocals of the first n positive integers, is never an integer except for the case n = 1\\\\. *Moreover, J√≥zsef K√ºrsch√°k proved in 1918 that the sum of the reciprocals of consecutive natural numbers (whether starting from 1 or not) is never an integer. *The sum of the reciprocals of the first n primes is not an integer for any n. *There are 14 distinct combinations of four integers such that the sum of their reciprocals is 1, of which six use four distinct integers and eight repeat at least one integer. *An Egyptian fraction is the sum of a finite number of reciprocals of positive integers. According to the proof of the Erd≈ës‚ÄìGraham problem, if the set of integers greater than one is partitioned into finitely many subsets, then one of the subsets can be used to form an Egyptian fraction representation of 1. *The Erd≈ës‚ÄìStraus conjecture states that for all integers n ‚â• 2, the rational number 4/n can be expressed as the sum of three reciprocals of positive integers. *The Fermat quotient with base 2, which is \\\\frac{2^{p-1}-1}{p} for odd prime p, when expressed in mod p and multiplied by ‚Äì2, equals the sum of the reciprocals mod p of the numbers lying in the first half of the range {1, p ‚àí 1}. *In any triangle, the sum of the reciprocals of the altitudes equals the reciprocal of the radius of the incircle (regardless of whether or not they are integers). *In a right triangle, the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the altitudes from the legs (equivalently, of the squares of the legs themselves) equals the reciprocal of the square of the altitude from the hypotenuse. This holds whether or not the numbers are integers; there is a formula (see here) that generates all integer cases. *A triangle not necessarily in the Euclidean plane can be specified as having angles \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{p}, \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{q}, and \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{r}. Then the triangle is in Euclidean space if the sum of the reciprocals of p, q, and r equals 1, spherical space if that sum is greater than 1, and hyperbolic space if the sum is less than 1. *A harmonic divisor number is a positive integer whose divisors have a harmonic mean that is an integer. The first five of these are 1, 6, 28, 140, and 270. It is not known whether any harmonic divisor numbers (besides 1) are odd, but there are no odd ones less than 1024. * The sum of the reciprocals of the divisors of a perfect number is 2. *When eight points are distributed on the surface of a sphere with the aim of maximizing the distance between them in some sense, the resulting shape corresponds to a square antiprism. Specific methods of distributing the points include, for example, minimizing the sum of all reciprocals of squares of distances between points. Infinitely many terms =Convergent series= *A sum-free sequence of increasing positive integers is one for which no number is the sum of any subset of the previous ones. The sum of the reciprocals of the numbers in any sum-free sequence is less than 2.8570. *The sum of the reciprocals of the heptagonal numbers converges to a known value that is not only irrational but also transcendental, and for which there exists a complicated formula. *The sum of the reciprocals of the twin primes, of which there may be finitely many or infinitely many, is known to be finite and is called Brun's constant, approximately 1.9022. *The prime quadruplets are pairs of twin primes with only one odd number between them. The sum of the reciprocals of the numbers in prime quadruplets is approximately 0.8706. *The sum of the reciprocals of the perfect powers (including duplicates) is 1. *The sum of the reciprocals of the perfect powers (excluding duplicates) is approximately 0.8745. *The sum of the reciprocals of the powers n^n is approximately equal to 1.2913. The sum is exactly equal to a definite integral: : \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{1}{n^n} = \\\\int_0^1 \\\\frac{1}{x^x}\\\\,dx This identity was discovered by Johann Bernoulli in 1697, and is now known as one of the two Sophomore's dream identities. *The Goldbach‚ÄìEuler theorem states that the sum of the reciprocals of the numbers that are 1 less than a perfect power (excluding duplicates) is 1. *The sum of the reciprocals of all the non-zero triangular numbers is 2\\\\. *The reciprocal Fibonacci constant is the sum of the reciprocals of the Fibonacci numbers, which is known to be finite and irrational and approximately equal to 3.3599. For other finite sums of subsets of the reciprocals of Fibonacci numbers, see here. *An exponential factorial is a number obtained by the process of raising n to the power n ‚Äì 1, then raising the result to the power n ‚Äì 2, and so forth. The sum of the reciprocals of the exponential factorials from 1 onward is approximately 1.6111 and is transcendental. *A powerful number is a positive integer for which every prime appearing in its prime factorization appears there at least twice. The sum of the reciprocals of the powerful numbers is a finite transcendental number. *The reciprocals of the factorials sum to the transcendental number e. *The sum of the reciprocals of the square numbers (the Basel problem) is the transcendental number , or Œ∂(2) where Œ∂ is the Riemann zeta function. *The sum of the reciprocals of the cubes of positive integers is called Ap√©ry's constant, and equals approximately 1.2021. This number is irrational, but it is not known whether or not it is transcendental. *The reciprocals of the non-negative integer powers of 2 sum to 2. *The Kempner series is the sum of the reciprocals of all positive integers not containing the digit \\"9\\" in base 10. Unlike the harmonic series, which does not exclude those numbers, this series converges, specifically to approximately 22.9207. *A palindromic number is one that remains the same when its digits are reversed. The sum of the reciprocals of the palindromic numbers converges to approximately 3.3703. *A pentatope number is a number in the fifth cell of any row of Pascal's triangle starting with the 5-term row 1 4 6 4 1. The sum of the reciprocals of the pentatope numbers is 4/3. *Sylvester's sequence is an integer sequence in which each member of the sequence is the product of the previous members, plus one. The first few terms of the sequence are 2, 3, 7, 43, 1807. The sum of the reciprocals of the numbers in Sylvester's sequence is 1. *The Riemann zeta function Œ∂(s) is a function of a complex variable s that analytically continues the sum of the infinite series \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{1}{n^s}. It converges if the real part of s is greater than 1. *The sum of the reciprocals of all the Fermat numbers (numbers of the form 2^{(2^n)} + 1) is irrational. *The sum of the reciprocals of the pronic numbers (products of two consecutive integers) (excluding 0) is 1 (see Telescoping series). =Divergent series= *The n-th partial sum of the harmonic series, which is the sum of the reciprocals of the first n positive integers, diverges as n goes to infinity, albeit extremely slowly: the sum of the first 1043 terms is less than 100. The difference between the cumulative sum and the natural logarithm of n converges to the Euler‚ÄìMascheroni constant, commonly denoted as \\\\gamma , which is approximately 0.5772. *The sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges. *The strong form of Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions implies that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes of the form 4n + 3 is divergent. *Similarly, the sum of the reciprocals of the primes of the form 4n + 1 is divergent. By Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, it follows that the sum of reciprocals of numbers of the form a^2+b^2, where a,b are non negative integers not both equal to 0, diverges, with or without repetition. *The Erd≈ës conjecture on arithmetic progressions states that if the sum of the reciprocals of the members of a set A of positive integers diverges, then A contains arithmetic progressions of any length, however great. the conjecture remains unproven.

This set the number of men to serve in the militia in Norfolk at 960, with the city of Norwich providing 151. The Norfolk Militia was divided into the 1st Battalion Western Regiment of the Norfolk Militia (West Norfolk Militia) and the 2nd Battalion Eastern Regiment of the Norfolk Militia (East Norfolk Militia). Between 1797 and 1798 there was also a 3rd Battalion of the Norfolk Militia, but this was not re-raised in 1803.Online Database of Early British Military Buttons The East Norfolk Militia was, jointly with the West Norfolk, the first regiment formed under the Bill of 1757, and was also recognised as the first to offer to \\"march wherever they might be most serviceable to the public defence.\\" Consideration was given by King George II \\"that every mark of his Royal Favour should be shown to this Corps\\" and that they \\"should be distinguished by the title of Militia Royal\\". History On 4 June 1759 the Eastern Battalion was reviewed by the Earl of Orford on Magdalen Fairstead, just outside Norwich.Sir Armine Wodehouse, MP, Colonel of the 2nd, or Eastern Regiment of Norfolk Militia, at a Review of his Regiment near Norwich, 1759, National Army Museum Collection The event was reported in the press, with the conduct of the men being praised and a statement that the unit could now be ready to march given four days notice. The establishment of the unit was given as 1 Colonel, 1 Lt. Colonel, 1 Major, 11 Captains, 11 Lieutenants, 8 Ensigns, 1 Adjutant, 24 Sergeants, 24 drummers and 466 rank and file. On Wednesday 4 July 1759 both battalions began a march from Norwich to Portsmouth barracks, to accept orders from Major General Holmes. Marching via Beccles, Ipswich, Colchester, Islington, and Petersfield, they arrived at Portsmouth on Tuesday 24 July. During the march, they were reviewed by King George II at Kensington Palace. Due to the heat, they set off soon after midnight, but were described as being in good spirits. By August the divisions were alternately guarding prisoners of war and undergoing training exercises. The Militia moved around the country from this point; they were quartered in Cirencester on 5 July 1760, but moved back to guard prisoners in Norfolk in July. On 28 May 1761 King George awarded the two battalions of the Norfolk Militia a \\"Warrant for Colours\\". In November the East Norfolk Militia was ordered to Fakenham, then to remain at Wells and Walsingham for the duration of the Fakenham Fair. In 1759, \\"A Plan of Discipline Composed for the Use of the Militia of the County of Norfolk\\" was published by William Windham & George Townshend. This text, written for the use of officers in this English rural militia unit, went on to become one of the most important drill manuals employed during the American Revolution.Peter Harrington A Plan of Discipline Composed for the Use of the Militia of the County of Norfolk (Parts 1 & 2) George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend, first Colonel of the West Norfolk Militia. =Irish service= In September 1798History, Gazetteer, and Directory of Norfolk, and the City and County of the City of Norwich all of the officers and most of the rank and file volunteered for service in Ireland during the Rebellion. Eight hundred men of the West Norfolk Militia were serving in Ireland in 1815 and 1816, and aspects of this were dramatised in the writings of George Borrow's book Lavengro, with Borrow's father having served as a Captain in the unit.http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30792/30792-h/30792-h.htm Lavengro, George Borrowhttps://www.lavengropress.co.uk/product/journey-through-cork/ =Prisoner shooting= In 1799 the East Norfolk Militia was escorting French prisoners of war from Yarmouth to Norman Cross. The bell tower of Dereham church was employed as a makeshift overnight cell for these prisoners. Jean De Narde, a 28-year lieutenant and son of a notary from St. Malo, escaped from the tower, but could not leave the churchyard due to posted sentries. Being unable to escape, De Narde chose to hide in a tree; but his absence was noted and he was soon discovered by a sergeant. De Narde ignored orders to surrender and the sergeant shot him dead. The local people of Dereham were ashamed of this killing and a monument was built by public subscription.The East Norfolk Militia: Jean De Narde A memorial service for Jean De Narde was held at Dereham church on 23 July 2016, including a re-enactment of the shooting and a minute's silence. A short documentary on the subject of the shooting was released in 2017.Once our foe - The shooting of Jean DeNarde (documentary) =1805 invasion scare= A musician of the West Norfolk Militia, and the only known image of a West Norfolk Militia uniform in the public domain.

Members of the original Norfolk Militia conduct training in front of tourists at Cromer, a similar role to that of the modern re-enactment unit. In 1805, after Britain had declared war on France on 18 May 1803, Napoleon turned his attention to invading England, and started to assemble an expeditionary force at Boulogne. With the British Isles threatened with invasion, the Norfolk Militia were ordered to join the Southern District (Sussex), which covered Kent east of the River Cray and Holwood Hill; Sussex; and Tilbury Fort in Essex. The GOC was Gen Sir David Dundas, Lt Gen The Earl of Chatham. Headquarters were in Canterbury. The East and West Norfolk Militia regiments were placed, along with the Nottinghamshire Regiment of Militia, into the Infantry Brigade of Maj Gen Alexander Mackenzie Fraser, headquartered in Winchelsea, with the 712 men of the West Norfolk Militia (under Lt Col George Nelthorpe) and 698 men of the East Norfolk Militia (under Lt Col George Berney Brograve, Bt.) being barracked at Clifford Camp.HOME GUARD: THE FORCES TO MEET THE EXPECTED FRENCH INVASION 1 SEPTEMBER 1805 =POW duties and Norman Cross Depot= A purpose- built prisoner of war camp, the first of its type, was provided at Norman Cross, near Peterborough. The Norfolk Militia became heavily involved in the transit of prisoners from Yarmouth to the camp, and in the operation of the latter. Lieutenant Thomas Borrow of the West Norfolk Militia, father of author George Borrow, was quartered at Norman Cross from July 1811 to April 1813 and George spent his ninth and tenth years in the barracks there.The Depot for Prisoners at Norman Cross Huntingdonshire, 1796 to 1816, page 144 =Disembodiment and peace= The Militia was disembodied at Great Yarmouth in 1814, and was not called out again until 1820. In April 1853 612 men of the West Norfolk Militia, under Col. the Earl of Orford, mustered in Norwich at the Swan Hotel. During this muster they were subjected to verbal attacks by members of the Peace Society and \\"Liberals\\". 571 out of the 612 men enrolled in the East Norfolk Militia assembled at Great Yarmouth on the same date under Col. the Hon. Berkeley Wodehouse. It was noted that, ‚ÄúTheir appearance was much more respectable than might have been expected, and many of those who were prepared to ridicule them acknowledged that they were a much better class than they expected.‚Äù[Norfolk Chronicle, April 1853] The East Norfolk Militia was presented with new colours on 16 May 1854, and these were still being carried in 1898. These were presented at a public ceremony held on South Denes, Great Yarmouth, that was attended by 10,000 persons, including civic dignitaries. The day concluded with a ball held at the Town Hall, which had been decorated with the new colours, mirrors and stars formed of bayonets. An order for the provision of Militia barracks at Great Yarmouth was made in 1853. Originally it was intended to base all three regiments of the Norfolk Militia at Great Yarmouth, but on February 25 the original resolution was rescinded, and it was agreed ‚Äúthat the present Committee be empowered to receive estimates and tenders for building barracks for one regiment of Militia at Norwich, and for one regiment of Militia and one regiment of artillery at Yarmouth, on such plans as they may think best suited for the purpose.‚Äù[Norfolk Chronicle, January/February 1854] In 1855 it was noted that the government intended to convert the arsenal at Yarmouth to create Gorleston Barracks, a facility for the two field officers, 15 sergeants and 408 men of the East Norfolk Militia, with the old Great Yarmouth barracks having been converted into an Admiralty hospital. In 1856, the East Norfolk Militia left Great Yarmouth by train, travelling to an encampment at Colchester. At Colchester railway station they were met by the band of the Royal Essex Rifles. The strength at this time was recorded as 1 Major, 13 officers, 3 sergeants and 415 men. June 1856 saw the left wing of the West Norfolk Militia return to Norwich from Fermoy, County Cork; the right wing reached the city on the 26th. On April 23 the units at Colchester, including the East Norfolk Militia, were reviewed by Prince Albert, but June 4 saw orders issued for the East Norfolk Militia to return to Great Yarmouth for disembodiment. On 20 May 1861, the East Norfolk Militia were involved in a serious military riot at Yarmouth, against men of the Royal Artillery. It was reported in the Norfolk Chronicle that this riot included the use of belts and stones, and that 200 Artillerymen, armed with swords and knives issued from the arsenal, had to be prevented from joining the fight by \\"persuasion and threats\\". The report says that officers from both corps were involved in ending the riot, and that guards had to be placed on the bridge to keep the Artillery out of Yarmouth and the Militia from crossing into Southtown.[Norfolk Chronicle] = Norfolk Artillery Militia = Period print of the Prince of Wales reviewing the Norfolk Artillery Militia at Great Yarmouth, June 1872. Period print of the Prince of Wales attending a Mess Dinner at the Yarmouth New Assembly Rooms. In 1853 the Norfolk Militia Artillery was formed from detachments of West and East Norfolk Militia. 52 men transferred from the East Norfolk Militia. The Norfolk Artillery Militia were assigned garrison duty at Eastbourne from March 7 - April 25, 1855. Their strength was increased from 200 to 400 men in May. The Norfolk Artillery Militia were granted barracks in All Saints Green, Norwich from around 1860, these consisting of Ivory House, a parade ground and stables. These barracks remained in use until the late 1920sNorfolk Heritage Explorer: Site of Militia Barracks The Prince of Wales became Honorary Colonel of the Artillery Militia in 1871, and the Great Yarmouth Assembly Rooms became frequently used as the Officer's Mess, whilst artillery practice was conducted on South Denes. In 1883 Lt. Colonel Lord Suffield and Major Edward Southwold Trafford purchased the building on behalf of the Artillery Militia, and the building remained under the Militia's ownership until 1918 (after which it became a Masonic Lodge).http://www.greatyarmouthmasoniclodge.co.uk/history In 1880 the unit was renamed the 1st Norfolk Artillery Volunteers, then 2nd Brigade Eastern District Royal Artillery (Prince of Wales' Own Norfolk Militia Artillery) in 1882 and, in 1902, becoming the 1st Norfolk Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers).Alice Keppel and Agnes Keyser: Edward VII's Last Loves In 1901, during the Second Anglo-Boer War, five officers and 134 Other Ranks from the Prince of Wales's Own Norfolk Royal Garrison Artillery (Militia) were sent to Cape Town, from which they were split up for garrison duty on armoured trains Wasp, Challenger, Bulldog and Blackhalta, among other duties including Military Intelligence and escort duties for the Royal Engineers.http://www.victorianmilitarysociety.org.uk/research/2012-09-09-11-20-22/archive/60-militiamen- in-the-second-anglo-boer-war The Special Service Company of the Militia was commanded by Colonel Thomas Coke, 3rd Earl of Leicester, who had served in the Scots Guards until 1892.Holkham History =Thorpe rail disaster, 1874= Two serving members of the West Norfolk Militia, Sgt Major Frederick Cassell and Sgt Robert Ward, are recorded to have been killed in the Thorpe rail accident whilst returning from a fishing trip. Their bodies were recovered and they were buried with full military honours. Robert Ward had previously been part of the Coldstream Guards.The Thorpe Railway Disaster 1874 Uniform The uniform of the East Norfolk Militia was scarlet turned up with black. An early sketch by Lord Townshend, published in \\"A Plan of Discipline Composed for the Use of the Militia of the County of Norfolk\\" in 1759, shows a Private wearing a simple uniform of cocked hat, jacket, breeches and shoes worn without gaiters. A cross belt and waist belt, with bayonet, are worn over the single- breasted jacket, with the latter secured by a single button close to the collar, two at the chest and three at the waist. Long boots were discontinued, except for mounted officers, on 12 April 1814. On 22 June 1820 epaulettes, buttons and ornaments of dress were changed from gold to silver, although serving officers were permitted to retain their old style of uniform unless called on for actual service. In January 1831 the old uniform was finally discontinued, with orders that all uniforms must meet the latest King's Regulations and include black velvet and silver epaulettes. Gold lace was restored to the East Norfolk Militia on 5 June 1882, at the same time as the badge of the then 4th Battalion Norfolk Regiment was changed from the castle and lion to the figure of Britannia.

From 1962 to 1973 she taught at Moscow's Lumumba University and from 1973 till 2001 was Professor at Keele University, England. She is the author and editor of major studies of Joseph Brodsky, as well as publications on poets such as Akhmatova, Pasternak, Tsvetaeva, Khlebnikov and Mandelshtam. She has a particular interest in bringing living Russian literature to English audiences, organising the visits of many Russian writers and poets to Keele and other English universities. The post of Russian Poet in Residence at the University of Keele, as well as the Russian Poets Fund, were established thanks to her efforts. In 1995 Professor Valentina Polukhina together with her colleagues of the Russian Department at Keele University established The Russian Poets Fund in order to invite Russian poets to the British Universities. The patrons of the fund were HRH Prince Michael of Kent, The Rt. Revd. Keith, Bishop of Lichfield and Seamus Heaney (Nobel Laureate). After Prof. Polukhina‚Äôs retirement in 2001 she and her husband Prof. Daniel Weissbort run the Fund. Together they compiled and edited The Anthology of Russian Women Poets (2002) and invited several Russian women poets to present it at The Poetry International, London, 2002. Due to Prof. Weissbort‚Äôs illness The Fund ceased to exist in 2012. In December 2014 with a help of a poet Olga Shvarova The Russian Poets Fund was brought back to life. Baron Rowan Williams and a Sir Andrew Motion, a former Poet-laureate of UK, agreed to replace Seamus Heaney and The Rt. Revd. Keith, Bishop of Lichfield, who have passed away. More recently V. Polukhina has completed The Anthology of Poems Dedicated to Joseph Brodsky, under the title ‚ÄúIz nezabyvshikh menia‚Äù (‚ÄúBy those who remember me‚Äù) which include sixteen British and two Irish poets. In 2014 she was awarded the A. C. Benson Medal by the Royal Society of Literature and 2018 Medal of Pushkin for the service to Russian and British culture and for the study and preservation of cultural heritage.

A first attack in April 1428 was repelled, a second attack on 15 June was successful. The Danish fleet which anchored in Copenhagen was destroyed. For the first time in the Northern European history of naval warfare ship artillery was used over longer distances.  Two naval battles  These two battles of April and June 1428 are sometimes confused with the naval battle in the √òresund (also called battle of Copenhagen) of July 1427. So sometimes, when two Hanseatic attacks of Copenhagen are mentioned, the battle of July 1427 and the battle of April 1428 are meant. = First attack in April 1428 = For the heroic defence of Copenhagen the Danish national author Hans Christian Andersen glorified and hailed Queen Philippa in his Gudfaders Billedbog (Godfather's picture book). The illustrations were made by Lorenz Fr√∏lich in 1868. Hoping for a rapid and victorious end of the Danish-Holstein-Hanseatic War, the Hanseatic league planned the seizure of the Danish capital and the destruction of the joint Danish-Swedish fleet in the harbour. On Easter 1428, under the command of Gerhard VII, Count of Holstein, up to 260 ships with more than 12,000 mercenaries sailed from Wismar to Copenhagen. However, the Danes were well-prepared and their capital was well-fortified. While King Eric left Copenhagen and prayed for the victory in Sor√∏, Queen Philippa managed the defence of the capital. Under massive shelling from Danish land-based artillery, armed bridges, and floating batteries the Hanseatic ships failed to blockade the harbour and to surround the Danish-Swedish fleet. When the Danish and Swedish ships started a counter-attack, the Hanseats and Holsteiners were forced to retreat. = Second attack in June 1428 = On June 15 of 1428 the Hanseats came back, now under L√ºbeck command. Up to 40 ships especially loaded with stones and lime were sunk in the harbour's entrance, trapping the Royal Danish-Swedish fleet inside. This time the Hanseats used floating batteries, too. With the help of these floating batteries the Hanseats were able to extend the range of their artillery and to cover the Danish and Swedish ships with a massive bombardment. By the end of the day, 30 Danish soldiers and sailors were killed and most of the King's ships were sunk, destroyed, or damaged. Only three ships remained undamaged and were able to escape.  Consequences  Although the fleet which anchored in Copenhagen was \\"neutralized\\", the war continued. King Eric was able to set up a new fleet soon. Already in the end of July 1428 at least seven ships were repaired and won a naval battle against the Victual Brothers who were allied with the Hanseatic League and Holstein. Queen Philippa meanwhile organized a new fleet with Swedish help. In May 1429 Philippa's fleet started a punitive attack against the Hanseatic city of Stralsund.

Accessed 2016-1-1 Plot Percy Caldwell is a teenage boy who lives in Pine Bluffs, California. He is in love with Madison, his high school's most popular cheerleader, but his best friend Leonard doesn't think he stands a chance. One day, after Percy rescues Madison from two local bullies, brothers named Cletis and Devlin, the brothers knock his bicycle off the road with their truck, and Percy ends up crashing in the woods, falling unconscious. When Percy wakes up, he sees an eight-foot-tall Bigfoot standing over him. Percy is initially scared, but the creature seems friendly and interacts with him. Then, Percy rushes home where he tells his parents but they do not believe him. The next day, Madison thanks Percy for saving her from the bullies; kissing him and declaring him her boyfriend. After school, Percy goes to see the Sasquatch in the woods and they share a picnic. Cletis and Devlin, who are going bear hunting, hear the Sasquatch burp from a distance and mistake him for a Grizzly bear. Percy hears the hunters and tells the Sasquatch to flee. When the brothers find Percy they threaten him, and Bigfoot comes to Percy's rescue; throwing the brothers down a hill. After that, the brothers start planning to catch the creature to sell for big money. The next morning Percy goes back into the woods for another picnic with Bigfoot. When he gets home, Madison arrives. While they are watching King Kong, Percy tells Madison about his encounters with the Sasquatch but she doesn't believe him and begins to have doubts about him. Meanwhile, Cletis and Devlin are building a cage for the Sasquatch in their barn. The following day, Percy tells Madison and Leonard to follow him to go see the Sasquatch, but Madison then decides that their relationship is over and she leaves. Leonard, however, agrees to go with him. When Percy and Leonard arrive in the woods, they find Cletis and Devlin trying to capture Bigfoot. Percy tells the creature to flee but the Sasquatch won't go. The brothers shoot Bigfoot with a tranquillizer gun but he manages to chase them back to their truck. However, he then falls asleep, from the dart, in the back of their truck. Leonard can snap a picture of Bigfoot before Cletis and Devlin drive away with the creature. Percy and Leonard meet with Madison, and when Leonard shows her the picture of Bigfoot she agrees to show them where the brothers live and to give Percy another chance. They all cycle to Cletis and Devlin's farm and watch the brothers going to and from the barn. When the coast is clear, they go in and find Bigfoot locked in a cage which they attempt to open; but just as they get the cage unlocked the brothers return. Bigfoot then throws the brothers to the ground, and the teenagers escape with Bigfoot. They drive off in the brother's truck while Cletis and Devlin wake up and follow them in Cletis's car, armed with rifles. During the chaos, Bigfoot throws the truck's spare tire at the windshield of the brothers' car, and they retaliate by attempting to shoot the tires of the truck. Their bullet accidentally hits Bigfoot, causing a life-threatening injury. The teenagers take Bigfoot to Percy's father, who is a surgeon, and he removes the bullet and saves Bigfoot's life. They then take Bigfoot back to the forest. However, Cletis and Devlin have been following them in their car and start shooting at them but Bigfoot pushes their car off the road. As it spins over, the brothers escape and Cletis waves goodbye to Bigfoot, much to Devlin's annoyance. Bigfoot is taken to his original forest home, which he was forced to leave after a recent forest fire, and they see him meeting with another Sasquatch, who they think may be his girlfriend. The movie ends with Percy telling the Sasquatch goodbye as they part ways.

On 9 February two more bombings occurred in Baghdad, one in Kadhimiya and the other in a northern Baghdad suburb. These bombings killed a total of at least 15 people. The first attack was perpetrated by a suicide bomber in a restaurant in New Baghdad. The second attack occurred in the Shorja market district, and involved two bombs placed about 25 meters apart from each other. The third attack occurred at the Abu Cheer market. The bombings on 7 February killed at least 22, 10, and two people, respectively. In addition to those dead, the attack in New Baghdad also wounded 45 people, the attack in Shorja wounded 26 people, and the attack in Abu Cheer wounded 15 people. Perpetrators Maan has accused the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant of perpetrating the attacks to reassert their presence in Baghdad.

She taught in public schools in Brooklyn for 48 years, and was the second black woman to serve in their system as an assistant principal. In 1892, Lyons cofounded the Women's Loyal Union of New York and Brooklyn, one of the first women's rights and racial justice organizations in the United States. One of the accomplishments of the Women's Loyal Union was to help to fund the printing of an important antilynching pamphlet, \\"Southern Horrors: Lynch Laws in All Its Phases\\" by Ida B. Wells.  Early life  Lyons was born at 144 Centre Street in New York City, the third of five children of Albro Lyons Sr. and Mary Joseph Lyons (n√©e Marshall). Her father was a graduate of the first African Free School in Manhattan, New York. The Lyons family lived in New York City's free black community and were active members of the Free African Church of St. Philip in Five Points. Lyons' parents operated a seamen's home and seamen's outfitting store that served also as a cover for the family's Underground Railroad activities. Though she was very ill as a child, Maritcha was eager to acquire an education. She wrote of herself that she developed a \\"love of study for study‚Äôs sake.\\" Lyons attended Manhattan's Colored School No. 3, under the direction of Charles Reason, a former educator at Philadelphia's Institute for Colored Youth. The Lyons' home on Vandewater Street was attacked several times during the New York City Draft Riots of July 1863. Lyons was a teenager at the time. She fled with her family to Salem, Massachusetts, for a short time before returning to Brooklyn. Because of the ongoing danger, her parents sent the children to Providence, Rhode Island. In 1865, Lyons was refused entry to the high school in Providence because she was African-American. The state had no high school for black children. The family successfully sued the state of Rhode Island in a campaign to bring an end to segregated schools. At the age of 16, she testified before the state legislature, \\"plead[ing] for the opening of the door of opportunity\\".Maritcha Lyons - Brown University Library Collection. Lyons later became the first African-American student to graduate from Providence High School.  Career  = Teaching = After graduating from high school, Lyons returned to New York to accept a teaching position at Brooklyn's Colored School No. 1, the first African Free School in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn. Colored School No. 1 was Brooklyn's first school for African Americans, opened at the current site of the Walt Whitman Houses, one of the largest housing projects in New York City. Lyons' teaching career spanned nearly 50 years. She devoted herself to elementary education and by the end of her career she was the assistant principal of Public School No. 83, the first fully integrated school in Brooklyn. Lyons was a well-known lecturer and speaker. She once won a debate against Ida B. Wells at the Brooklyn Literary Union and Wells credits Lyons with teaching her how to become a better public speaker. = Activism = On October 5, 1892, Lyons and educator and activist Victoria Earle Matthews organized a testimonial dinner in New York‚Äôs Lyric Hall for Ida B. Wells and her anti-lynching campaign. They continued to work on this issue, founding the Women‚Äôs Loyal Union of New York and Brooklyn in February 1892. Lyons fought for voting rights for women as a member of the Colored Women's Equal Suffrage League of Brooklyn. = Memoir, writing and book = Lyons' memoir and photographs of herself and her family are included in the Harry A. Williamson Papers at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture of the New York Public Library. Her memoir was never published, but includes a breathtaking account of the sacking and burning of her family's home by a mob during the New York City Draft Riots of 1863. These riots were so destructive of black neighborhoods in Manhattan that many African Americans left the city permanently, some moving to Brooklyn for safety. It also describes how Lyons wrote about her family's involvement in assisting escaping slaves as part of the Underground Railroad in her memoir, Memories of Yesterdays: All of Which I Saw and Part of Which I Was (1928). A young adult book was written about Lyons, Maritcha: A Remarkable Nineteenth-Century Girl, based on her memoir and writing. In addition to her memoir, Lyons contributed eight biographical sketches to Hallie Quinn Brown's Homespun Heroines and Other Women of Distinction (1926), which include sketches of Sarah H. Fayerweather (1802‚Äì1868) and Agnes J. Adams (1885‚Äì1923).  Personal life  Lyons lived in Brooklyn, with her brother and his family, until she died.

No. 984, 6 Bevans 739, 10 U.N.T.S. 261. or Sino-American New Equal Treaty was a bilateral treaty signed by the United States and the Republic of China on January 11, 1943. The formal name of the treaty was Treaty Between the United States of America and the Republic of China for the Relinquishment of Extraterritorial Rights in China and the Regulation of Related Matters. It became effective on May 20, 1943 following the mutual exchange of ratifications pursuant to Article VIII. After the United States declared war upon Japan on Dec. 8, 1941, the governments of the United States and United Kingdom mutually decided that it would be advantageous to end extraterritoriality and the unilateral privileges in China that had been granted by the \\"unequal treaties.\\" Extraterritoriality was thus ended, making citizens of the United States and United Kingdom in China subject to Chinese law, as well as the existence of treaty ports and their autonomous foreign settlements, legation quarters, and the right to station foreign warships in Chinese waters and foreign troops on Chinese territory.Jules Davids, Jonathan M. Nielson, \\"Extraterritoriality, China,\\" Encyclopedia of the New American Nation (accessed February 7, 2015) In close coordination with the United States, the United Kingdom and China also established a corresponding treaty which served essentially the same purpose and was concluded on the same day. Background After war was declared between the United States and Japan in December, 1941, the United States became China's ally but could not send military aid on the large scale needed. Japanese officials justified their conquests by claiming that Japan was liberating Asia from Western imperialism and that Westerners were racist and exploitative. A high official in the U.S. Department of State warned that \\"the Chinese are becoming increasingly disappointed and resentful\\" and that some Chinese were \\"beginning to talk of the possibility of China ceasing to be an active belligerent...\\" Former U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull, although not in the inner circle on policy toward China, turned his attention to negotiating a treaty to end the privileges granted over the previous century. The treaty was ratified by the United States Senate unanimously and came into effect on 20 May 1943. In Chongqing, China's wartime capital, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek declared that with the signing of the treaties, \\"an independent China on equal footing\\" has become \\"a real friend\\" of Great Britain and the United States. Henceforth, Chiang concluded, \\"if we are weak, if we lack self-confidence, the fault will be ours.\\" The official press praised Chiang. One newspaper said that the treaties made the Unequal Treaties into no more than \\"a stack of waste paper,\\" and bragged that if it were not for our Party and for Sun Yat-sen and Generalissimo Chiang the treaties would still be in force. The leftist and communist press reacted quickly. They praised the efforts of the Communist Party in creating the United Front and claimed that the party had been a leader in the struggle for national liberation. In December, 1943, in response to some of the same pressures which brought about the end of extraterritoriality, the Senate passed the Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act which ended the formal and legal exclusion of Chinese from immigration to the United States. Terms of the Treaty The terms of the Treaty are summarized as follows: * Article I: The U.S. relinquished all rights to extraterritoriality in China, including such rights previously established under the Treaty of Wanghia and the Treaty of Tientsin. As a result, the United States Court for China and the U.S. Consular Courts in China, which exercised extraterritorial jurisdiction in China, were abolished. * Article II: The U.S. and China terminated the Boxer Protocol. * Article III: The U.S. agreed that administration and control of the International Settlements at Shanghai and Amoy should revert to China. Accordingly, the U.S. relinquished its rights of administration and control back to China and agreed to assist China with obtaining the relinquishment of such rights from other countries. * Article IV: Previous real estate titles and leases in China were to be respected. * Article V: The U.S. had long allowed Chinese nationals to travel, reside, and carry on trade within its territory. Under Article V, China reciprocated these rights for U.S. nationals within its territory. The U.S. and China also agreed to treat each other's nationals within its territory the same as its own nationals with respect to all legal proceedings, administration of justice, and taxation. * Article VI: Each nation was authorized to establish consular offices in the other nation. Nationals of each nation present in the other nation were authorized to communicate with their nation's consular offices. * Article VII: The U.S. and China agreed that both nations would negotiate a comprehensive modern treaty of friendship, commerce, navigation and consular rights six months after the end of World War II.

(in French) (Lessee of the Mints of B√©arn and Navarre). He was a descendant of the noble family of Forcade from B√©arn in the Kingdom of Navarre, a Protestant nobleman, but abjured from ProtestantismChaix d'Est-Ange, Tome 18, Page 316 (in French) shortly before the end of his life, under intimidation from the policy of harassment of religious minorities through the use of dragonnades, created in 1681, to intimidate Huguenots into converting to Catholicism or to leave France, and under the threat of confiscation of properties of nobles who did not convert. Jean de Forcade is the founder of the Forcade-Biaix family line,Jougla de Morenas, Tome 4, Page 28 (in French) through his 1659 acquisition of the noble fief of Biaix in the city of Pau, and therewith the earliest bearer of the Forcade-Biaix name.  Life and Occupation  The earliest known mention of Jean de Forcade is in relation to the provision of an office as Huissier at the Parliament of Navarre on 5 March 1644.SSLAP - Extraits des registres du Conseil Souverain de Pau, du Parlement de Navarre, et de la Chambre des Comptes de Pau XVIe et XVIIe si√®cles (suite et fin), Tome 35, p. 150 (in French) Records for wages and other payments by the Chambre des Comptes show that Jean de Laforcade was still a Huissier at the Parliament of Navarre in 1657,AD64, B3925AD64, B3895AD64, B 1453 when he received a reimbursement for the costs of his robe and bonnet for having assisted at the execution of a person condemned to death. He is next mentioned in 1652 in relation to three mints being in position to strike new coins using mills, when the Chambre des Comptes de Pau (the Court of Finances of Pau) granted a license to mint to Pierre de Peyr√©, who, in turn, subcontracted the production to: Jean de Gassie, legislator at the Parliament of Navarre, who was committed to the mint in Morla√†s and Jean Verdoy√© to the one in Saint-Palais. Verdoy√© was also to ensure the interim succession of Richard Lamy at the mint in Pau until the arrival of Jean de Forcade. Jean de Forcade was received into the Order of Nobility of the Estates of B√©arn as Seigneur de Rontignon on 30 August 1658AD64, C 722 The fief of Rontignon was originally a part of the Marquisate of Gassion. He was subsequently received into the Order of Nobility of the Estates of B√©arn as Seigneur de Biaix on 10 June 1659.AD64, C 723 The Chambre des Comptes de Pau renewed the license for the Coin Mint of Navarre and B√©arn, for a fee of 11,100 livres on 11 July 1659. The official beneficiary of the license was Daniel d'Arripe, which was, in fact, the d.b.a. used by the three associates: Jean de Gassie, Jeans Daudichon and Jean de Forcade. In practice, it seems that only Jean de Forcade personally exploited one of three mints, namely the one in Saint-Palais. The management of the mints in Pau and Morla√†s was entrusted to Robert Fisson, acting in the quality of a subcontractor or shareholder proxy. There were numerous problems associated with the minting of coins for B√©arn and Navarre, all of which go beyond the scope of this biography. Some were conflicts with the King of France and his rulings on autonomy for the regions, others were with regard to the authorities responsible for the production of coins throughout France, and still others were legal issues related to competitors. King Louis XIV of France subsequently ordered the three mints closed. His Counsel issued a ruling on 17 Mar 1661, ordering the immediate closure of mints in Pau, Morla√†s and Saint-Palais, and the transport of the records of all coins minted at the three mints since the reign of Henry IV by the Attorney General of the Chambre des Comptes de Pau. The problems, the visits of envoys, the interference of authorities from the Mint of France, and the aforementioned ruling led the three partners to justly conclude that their days were numbered and that the mints in Pau, Morla√†s and Saint-Palais were indeed doomed for closure, or at best be put to auction in Paris. Nevertheless, for political reasons, the Chambre des Comptes de Pau was not predisposed to grant the partners a termination of their lease since it would result in a loss of resources for the province. Considering these circumstances, the partners decided to address themselves to the King's Counsel to obtain the termination of their lease and financial relief. On 22 February 1663, the Counsel issued a final ruling declaring the license to Daniel d'Aripe null and void, retroactively to 30 June 1662, and relieving the partners of the payment of the annual license fee of 11,100 livres, therewith ending the venture. Jean de Forcade was an active member of the Protestant church in Pau and also held office on the Consistory of Pau, the local Protestant Church Council and the authority of the local church. The Consistory of Pau was composed of thirteen members, consisting of two pastors, ten elders and a dean. The pastors and the dean were permanent members. The elders were nominated and appointed for terms of four years, and rotated one-third at a time. As a result, a total of about forty persons served on the Consistory of Pau during its existenceSSLAP - Le Livre du Consistoire de Pau, Tome 41, p. 332 (in French) from 1 January 1668 until 31 July 1681.SSLAP - Le Livre du Consistoire de Pau, Tome 41, p. 189 (in French) The list of these elders shows many of the same names that are also found in notarized acts, marriage contracts and parish registers related to Jean de Forcade and his descendants, several of which are families interrelated by marriage. These elders were: d'Angoueix, d'Argausse, two different d'Artiguelouve, d'Auture, de Balagu√© (Balaguer), de Batsalle, de Bruchelles, de Casaux, de Colomi√®s, de Day, de Dupla√†, d'Espalungue, two different de Forcade, de Gassies, de Guiraudet, de Jo√´t, de Jurque, de Lafitte, de Lalana, de Lamothe, de Lanab√®re, de Lapuyade, de Larriu, de L√®me, de Maria, de Mirassor, de Missou, de Nays, de Pa√Øssa, de P√©faur, de Saint-Martin, de Saint- Orenx, de Somolon, de Veguier, de Vidal, de Vignau, and de Vignoles.SSLAP - Le Livre du Consistoire de Pau, Tome 41, p. 333 (in French) He is named in the minutes of the meeting of the Consistory on 7 April 1669, together with Messieurs de Olivier and de Rival, Pastors, de Vignoles, d'Espalungue, de Mirassor, de Bruchelles, de St.-Orenx, de Duplaa and de Larriu, all Elders, and de Lostau, dean.SSLAP - Le Livre du Consistoire de Pau, Tome 41, p. 171 (in French) He was relieved of his responsibilities as an elder by the body of the Consistory of Pau on 5 April 1671.SSLAP - Le Livre du Consistoire de Pau, Tome 41, pp. 189-190 (in French)  Biaix - The Family Estate  The etymology of the word BiaixInstitut d'Estudis Catalans, Diccionari de la llengua catalana, Segona edici√≥ (in Catalan) has its roots in the Catalan language and means oblique or biais, in the sense of not expressed or done in a direct way or deviates from the expected according to the laws of probability or physics. The only family known to have carried this patronym prior to Jean de Forcade de Biaix was that of Pierre de Biaix, ambassador of the King of Navarre to Paris and to Brussels (1516), secular Parson of Monein and of Pau, secular Abbot of Lucq (abb√© la√Øc de Lucq), elected Bishop of Aire (√©v√®que √©lu d'Aire) 1523-26, Chancellor of Foix and B√©arn, Chancellor of Navarre and ambassador of Navarre to Spain. The Seigneur of the noble fief of Biaix paid a tax of 4 feus for the period ending 12 January 1549.SSLAP - Extraits des registres du Conseil Souverain de Pau, du Parlement de Navarre, et de la Chambre des Comptes de Pau XVIe et XVIIe si√®cles, Tome 35, Pau 1907, pp. 46 (in French) Noble Jean de Forcade, Seigneur de Rontignon, purchased the noble fief of Biaix in Pau on 28 February 1659AD64, E 2048 from Gratian von Turon, Seigneur de Beyrie, for 6,000 Bordeaux livres and was admitted on 10 June 1659 to the Order of Nobility of the States of B√©arn as Seigneur de Biaix. The noble fief of Biaix in the city of Pau and another house located on the outskirts of the city, were simultaneously ennobled on 20 September 1521, by letters of Henry II, King of Navarre, for Pierre de Biaix, then Chancellor of Foix and B√©arn. Although there are references to his son, also named Jean de Forcade de Biaix, as the \\"Marquis de Biaix\\", in some Prussian sources published between 1788-1837, there is no evidence that either father or son was ever a Marquis. The noble fief of Biaix in the city of Pau was not a \\"marquisate\\". Under intimidation from the policy of harassment of religious minorities through the use of dragonnades, created in 1681, to intimidate Huguenots into converting to Catholicism or to leave France, and under the threat of confiscation of properties of nobles who did not convert, both Jean de Forcade de Biaix and his eldest son, Isaac de Forcade de Biaix, abjured from Protestantism, therewith maintaining possession of Biaix. Following his death in 1684, the property and the right to enter the Order of Nobility of the States of B√©arn was passed to Isaac de Forcade de BiaixPicamihl, Tome 1, Page 421 (in French) (Seigneur de Biaix 1684-1737). In turn, following his death in 1737, the property and the right to enter the Order of Nobility of the States of B√©arn was passed to his eldest son, Jean-Jacob de Forcade de Biaix, Seigneur de Biaix (1738-?), before the Forcade-Biaix line in France is thought to have extinguished. After various viscitudes of fortune, the second smaller house on the outskirts of Pau, referred to as Biaix du faubourg, in the suburb of la Fontaine, acquired with the main fief on 28 February 1659, was acquired from family de Casaus on 10 May 1710 by No√© Dufau, merchant furbisher, who was received in the Order of Nobility of the States of B√©arn on 28 April 1717 as Seigneur de Biaix du faubourg. No√© Dufau died in 1739 and bequeathed it back to his niece and Goddaughter, Jean-Jacob de Forcade de Biaix' daughter, Marie- Jeanne de Forcade, Dame de Biaix, who later married Pierre de Casamajor. This property had a value of 20 livres in the 23 December 1693 estimation of house values by the City of Pau.AD64, C 1047SSLAP - Recherches sur la ville de Pau, Tome 17, p. 301 (in French) Because Biaix was acquired in 1659, any reference to parents or grandparents in this family line with de Biaix as a part of the name are in error.  Family  = Parents = Jean de Forcade was the son of Isacq de Forcade (* Before 1601), from Boeil, and Marie de Bordes, from Nay, who married by notarized contract at the Notary Nicolas de Lavie in Nay on 26 March 1624.AD64, E 1756, f¬∞ 142 (in B√©arnese) Isacq de Forcade, in turn, was the son of Pierre de Forcade, Lawyer, Guardian of Mint of Pau (Garde en la monnaie de Pau)SSLAP, Extraits des Registres de la Chambre des Comptes de Pau, Tome 16, p. 160 (in French) and his wife Marie de Maserolles. Marie de Bordes was the daughter of Pierre de Bordes, Lawyer and Special Prosecutor for the District of Nay, and his wife, Marie de Foron. There is no document that names the parents of Jean de Forcade, Seigneur de Biaix. There is no birth or baptism record. His parents are not named in his marriage record at the Protestant Temple in Morla√†s on 23 December 1659, nor are they named in his marriage contract made at the Notary Jean d'Agoeuix in Pau on 12 February 1660. The evidence linking him as the son of Isacq de Forcade is nonetheless strong, if not conclusive. Jean de Forcade, Seigneur de Biaix, assisted at the marriage by notarized contract at the Notary Jean d'Agoeuix in Pau, between Pierre de Bordes, Seigneur de Rontignon, and Damoiselle Marie de Bel√ßa on 11 December 1661.

The original title is and it is abbreviated as . It was worked on by the staff who had previously worked on the anime series Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day and its film adaptation, as well as Toradora!. It was released on September 19, 2015. Plot As a young girl, Jun Naruse is excitable and talkative. One day, she sees her father exit a love hotel, accompanied by another woman. Without understanding the situation, she tells her mother, resulting in her parents' divorce, and her father blaming her for this. While she is crying, she imagines a fairy egg that curses her by sealing her words so she won't hurt people again. As a result of her \\"curse\\", Jun is unable to speak and she suffers stomachaches whenever she tries to. Years later, when Jun is attending high school, her homeroom teacher, Kazuki J≈çshima, signs her up as a member of the Charity Committee along with three other classmates: Takumi Sakagami, Natsuki Nit≈ç, and Daiki Tasaki. When she goes to the Committee's room to reject her position, Jun hears Takumi singing and is captivated. She then tells Takumi of her past, using her phone, and requests him to turn her words into a song. In this way Jun learns that, though she cannot speak, the 'curse' isn't in effect if she sings. Her class decides then to perform a musical for their school festival, based on the story of her experience narrated in the form of a fairy tale. While discussing the musical, Daiki has a falling out with his teammates that is stopped by Jun, who consequently has another stomachache for talking, but this improves her bonds with the other Charity Committee members. Misunderstanding Takumi's concern for Jun as a sign that he is falling in love with her, Natsuki tells Takumi that she will cheer them on despite her own feelings for Takumi. The next day, Daiki makes amends with his teammates. As they spend time together preparing for the musical, Jun starts to develop feelings for Takumi, while Daiki starts to develop feelings for Jun. Daiki asks Takumi regarding his relationship with Natsuki, having heard rumours that both of them were dating during middle school, but Takumi denies this since Natsuki had told her classmates then that they were not dating when she was asked. At the night before the musical, Takumi asks Natsuki about the boy she's dating currently, leading Natsuki to finally reveal that the boy she's referring to is none other than Takumi himself, before she accuses him of falling in love with Jun. Takumi reveals that while he is concerned about Jun, he is not in love with her and he has always regretted not trying to convey his feelings for Natsuki during middle school even when he was aware of her feelings for him at that time. Unbeknownst to them, Jun overhears their conversation. Heartbroken, she runs away and meets the fairy egg, who reveals that she has worsened the curse by trying to convey her feelings for Takumi. Jun doesn't show up on the day of the musical, leaving Natsuki to fill her role while Takumi frantically goes searching for her. Takumi finds Jun at the love hotel that has been shut down. To his surprise, she is able to talk normally. Jun angrily lashes out at Takumi as he tells her that the reason she is unable to convey her words is not because of the fairy egg's curse but because of Jun's own fear. Wanting to hear her voice once more, Takumi allows Jun to lash out all of her anger and frustration until she is satisfied. Jun confesses her feelings for Takumi, but it is revealed that Takumi is still in love with Natsuki, to which Jun replies that she knew. Takumi then expresses his gratitude for Jun because before he met her, he was unable to say what he truly felt properly and only went along with everyone else. This convinces Jun to perform in the musical. Jun and Takumi arrive just in time before the final scene, allowing Jun to sing and convey her feelings to her mother who finally understands what she had been through. As the musical ends, Jun realises that the fairy egg was actually nothing but an imagination that she created to have someone she could blame for her condition, and now she decides to open up her heart, coming to terms with her past. As the movie ends, Takumi and Natsuki reconciles their relationship, while Daiki finally confesses his feelings to Jun.

He came from the Maukhari dynasty and succeeded his father, Avantivarman. Grahavarman married Rajyashri, the daughter of the ruler of Thanesar, Prabhakar Vardhana. The marriage appears to have been an alliance of the two dynasties against the king of the Malavas. The tripartite struggle for power in the region became four-sided when Shashanka, ruler of the Gauda kingdom in Bengal, took an interest. There had been rivalry between the Maukharis and rulers in Bengal for around fifty years, and Shashanka was concerned about the strengthening of the Maukhari position through the marriage alliance. He allied with the Malavas and launched what was probably a surprise attack on the Maukhari capital at Kannauj, which was overwhelmed. He killed Grahavarman and imprisoned Rajyashri.

She was the best filly of her generation in Ireland at both two and three years of age, winning the Phoenix Stakes and finishing second in the Queen Mary Stakes, Cheveley Park Stakes, Prix de l'Abbaye and Prix de la For√™t. When transferred to France in 1980 she proved herself one of the best sprinter-milers of the year, with consecutive wins in the Prix de Meautry, Prix Quincey, Prix du Moulin and Prix de Seine-et-Oise before traveling to California to take the Yellow Ribbon Stakes. She remained in the United Stakes in 1981 and was one of the most successful female turf performers of 1981, winning the San Gorgonio Handicap, Monrovia Handicap, Gamely Handicap, Palomar Handicap, Autumn Days Handicap and Matriarch Stakes. After her retirement from racing she made little impact as a broodmare, but some of her descendants have won good races in Australia. Background Kilijaro was a bay mare with a white star and a white sock on her right front foot bred in Ireland by the Irish National Stud. She was sired by African Sky who won the Prix du Palais Royal, Prix Quincey and Prix de la For√™t as a three-year-old in 1973. As a breeding stallion, he also sired the King's Stand Stakes winner African Song. She was the second foal of her dam Manfilia, who had some success as a racemare, winning five races. Sold as a yearling for 4,200 guineas, the filly was sent into training with Dermot Weld at the Curragh, County Kildare. She was ridden in most of her early races by Wally Swinburn. Racing career =1978: two-year-old season= Kilijaro began her racing career in five furlong maiden race in the spring of 1978, finishing unplaced at Phoenix Park Racecourse and third at Navan Racecourse before winning at Phoenix Park. In June she was sent to England to contest the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot. Starting at odds of 12/1 she produced a strong run along the rail to dispute the lead in the final furlong and finished second, beaten a head by Greenland Park, with Devon Ditty in third. After a break of almost two months the filly was matched against colts in the Group 2 Phoenix Stakes in which she was equipped with blinkers for the first time. Starting second favourite behind the English-trained Inshallah, she raced at the rear of the nine-runner field before moving up to take the lead a furlong from the finish. In the closing stages she drew away from her opponents to win by six lengths and half a length from Real Snug and Coalminer. In October Kilijaro was sent back to England for a rematch with Devon Ditty in the Cheveley Park Stakes in which she was moved up to six furlongs for the first time. She moved up to challenge Devon Ditty approaching the final furlong but after a prolonged struggle she was beat a neck by the 11/8 favourite. =1979: three- year-old season= Kilijaro failed to win in seven starts as a three-year-old but produced several good performances. After finishing sixth on her debut she started second favourite for the Irish 1000 Guineas over one mile at the Curragh, but finished eleventh of the twelve runners behind the Vincent O'Brien-trained Godetia. The filly was then brought back to sprint distances and finished fifth in her next appearance before producing her best performance of the year up to that point when she finished third to the colts Miami Springs and Golden Thatch in the Matt Gallagher Sprint Stakes in July at Phoenix Park. After finishing unplaced in her next race, Kilijaro was offered for sale in October at the Arc de Triomphe sale. She was bought for ‚Ç£1,800,000 by representatives of Serge Fradkoff and transferred to the French stable of Olivier Douieb. Less than twenty-four hours after the sale, Kilijaro contested France's most prestigious sprint race, the Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Starting a 73/1 outsider she produced what was then a career-best performance, producing a sustained run over the last 400 metres to finish second by a head to the British four-year-old Double Form. Greenland Park was third, with the other beaten horses including King of Macedon, Thatching and Sigy. Three weeks later the filly was ridden by Henry Samani in the Group One Prix de la For√™t over 1400 metres at the same course and finished second of the fourteen runners behind Producer. =1980: four-year- old season= After winning a minor race over 1400 metres at √âvry Racecourse in April, Kilijaro was beaten in her next five races: she finished sixth to Adraan when favourite for the Prix de Saint-Georges, second to Baptism in the Prix du Palais-Royal, fifth behind Rostov in the Prix du Chemin de Fer du Nord, fourth to Luck of the Draw in the Prix de la Porte Maillot and third behind Boitron and Moorestyle in the Prix Maurice de Gheest. Despite having lost thirteen of her last fourteen races, Kilijaro was made 3/5 favourite for the Prix de Meautry over 1200 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 20 August. Ridden by Alain Lequeux, she recorded her first major win for more than two years as she won easily by five lengths from Northjet. Eight days later the same course, the filly started at odds of 11/1 for the Prix Quincey over 1600 metres. Ridden by Freddy Head, she won by three lengths from the favourite Tassmoun (winner of the Prix Messidor) with Boitron in fourth. On 7 September, Kilijaro was moved back up to Group One class for the Prix du Moulin over 1600 metres at Longchamp. She started the 6.1/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Northern Baby, Nadjar (Prix d'Ispahan, Prix Jacques Le Marois) and Final Straw (Champagne Stakes). Under a very hard ride from Head, she held off a strong challenge from Nadjar to prevail by a neck, with a gap of two lengths back to Katowice in third. Kilijaro attempted to win her fourth major race in less than five weeks when she started 3/5 favourite for the Prix de Seine-et-Oise at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse on 22 September. Ridden by Lequeux, she won by one and a half lengths and a length from Boitron and Northjet. On her final European start, Kilijaro finished third behind Moorestyle and Crofter in the Group One Prix de la For√™t over 1400 metres on heavy ground at Longchamp on 26 October. Following her defeat in the Foret, Kilijaro was sent to California to contest the Grade I Yellow Ribbon Stakes at Santa Anita Park on 9 November. Despite given little time to aclimatise to her new surroundings and racing over an unfamiliar distance of ten furlongs, Kilijaro accelerated away from her opponents in the closing stages to win by more than three lengths from Ack's Secret (Las Palmas Handicap) and Queen To Conquer (Ramona Handicap). =1981: five-year-old season= In 1981, Kilijaro was trained in the United States by Charles E. Whittingham and was ridden in most of her races by Marco Castaneda. She began her fourth season in the Grade II San Gorgonio Handicap over nine furlongs at Santa Anita on January 11 and won from Queen To Conquer before being switched to dirt on for the Santa Margarita Invitational Handicap on February 22 and finished sixth behind Princess Karenda. On her next appearance she was dropped back to sprint distances for the Monrovia Handicap on turf and won from Love You Dear and She Can't Miss. The mare was then sent to Hollywood Park Racetrack for the Gamely Handicap oven nine furlongs on April 24 and won again, beating Princess Karenda and Wishing Well (winner of the race in 1980). She was matched against male opposition in the Californian Stakes on dirt on May 25 and finished to behind Eleven Stitches and Temperence Hill, before finishing seventh behind Eleven Stitches in the Hollywood Gold Cup on June 14. In the Vanity Invitational Handicap on July 12 she finished fourth behind Track Robbery, Princess Karenda and Save Wild Life. In August 8, Kilijaro returned to turf racing for the Grade II Palomar Handicap over one mile at Del Mar Racetrack and won from Lisawan and Satin Ribera. On August 30, Kilijaro contested the inaugural running of the Arlington Million, then the world's most valuable horse race, but finished unplaced behind John Henry The mare returned to California for her last three races. In the Autumn Day Handicap over six and a half furlongs on turf, she recorded her fifth success of the season, beating Ack's Secret and Miss Huntingdon. On November 1 she attempted to repeat her 1980 win in the Yellow Ribbon Stakes, but finished fourth behind Queen To Conquer, Star Pastured and Ack's Secret. On November 22, Kilijaro contested the inaugural running of the Matriarch Stakes over nine furlongs at Hollywood Park. Ridden by Laffit Pincay Jr., she ended her career with a victory as she won by two and a half lengths from the Canadian champion Glorious Song. Assessment and awards In the International Classification for 1978, Kilijaro was rated on 82, making her the sixth-best juvenile filly in Europe behind Sigy, Devon Ditty, Formulate, Greenland Park and Pitasia.

History The National Black Theatre (NBT) is a non-profit cultural and educational corporation, and community-based theatre company that seeks \\"to produce transformational theatrical experiences that enhance African American cultural identity by telling authentic stories of the Black experience.\\" Based in the Harlem neighborhood of the New York City borough of Manhattan, NBT was founded in 1968 by actress, director, producer, Dr. Barbara Ann Teer. Teer purchased the 8,000 square foot theatre in 1969 at 9 East 125th street. In 1982, the NBT expanded to 64,000 square foot complex that houses two theatres, classrooms, and an African and Nigerian art gallery which currently resides on 5th Avenue in Harlem. Dr. Teer founded the NBT with a goal of creating a \\"massive cultural and artistic movement to create people culturally literate.\\" Teer viewed the African-American community as one that was in desperate need of an African cultural education. The company committed itself to representing and establishing \\"a black theatrical standard -- a standard based on black lifestyle.\\" Teer turned the theatre into a cultural incubator that provided shows and workshops to help promote respect for the African ancestry and for black self-expression. The NBT produced plays that were dedicated to raising the consciousness of the African-American community by crafting a distinct departure from White theatrical conventions. As Teer wrote in a critical essay, \\"You cannot have a theatre without ideology, without a base from which all of the forms must emanate and call it Black, for it will be the same as Western theatre, conventional theatre, safe theatre.\\" Notable productions performed at the NBT included Ritual, Change! Love Together! Organize! A Revival, Five on the Black Hand Side, The Believers, Softly Comes a Whirlwind, Whispering in Your Ear, and A Soul Journey into Truth. Distinguished artists that have performed at the NBT include Nina Simone, Maya Angelou, and Nikki Giovanni. After Teer died in 2008, her daughter Sade Lythcott took over as CEO and to this day continues her leadership over the theatre. Once Sade Lythcott took over the role as CEO, one of the first challenges that was faced was the threat of the foreclosure of the theatre. NBT was involved in various disagreements in regards with surrounding business including with the Applebee's franchise. These disputes had since been resolved. The disputes has resulted in an over $10 million debt including their previous debts but was relieved when Baltoro Capital Management took over in the spring of 2012. Since then, the management company has promised to keep the theatre rent-free even if the building was ever sold.  National Black Theatre v. Applebee's Law Case  In April 2009, Nubian Partners signed a lease with Apple-Metro which is an Applebee's Franchisee. The franchise was planning to take on a lease in the building the National Black Theatre was located. Barbara Ann Teer sold 49 percent of the property to Nubian Partners, which operates multiple retail outlets within the building. Ms. Teer brought forth the case in early 2008, before her passing, arguing that Applebee's did not promote the cultural integrity mission that the theatre promoted. This was a condition she included when she signed the real estate partnership agreement with Nubian in 2002 when the theatre was threatened by foreclosure. The case was brought to Justice Walter B. Tolub, a judge for the New York County Supreme Court (Civil), who ruled that leasing part of the building to Applebee's would be violating the contract between the two parties, National Black Theatre and Nubian Partners. On the afternoon of 15 July 2009, the State Supreme Court justice ruled that the Applebee's chain is not allowed to move into the building with the National Black Theatre. Raymond Hannigan, the lawyer at Herrick Feinstein representing the National Black Theatre, proudly states that \\" think Barbara Ann Teer would be pleased to see this decision and see that this landmark location remained dedicated to African-American arts\\" after the case was concluded.  Mission statement  Teer founded the National Black Theatre to \\"bring validation to a group suffering from the negative effects of cultural hegemony.\\" The NBT's mission is develop new cultural leaders who will bring \\"dignity, autonomy, self-love, and entrepreneurial artistry into the community of who they serve.\\" The 6 goals of the NBT are as follows: # To create and perpetuate a standard of Black art, # To eliminate the competitive aspects of most commercial theatre, # To re-educate audiences, # To restore the spirituality and cultural traditions that have been stripped from Blacks in America, # To create an alternate system of values from the Western concept, and # To create a Black theory of acting and liberation.  Awards and recognition  Over the course of more than 300 productions, the National Black Theater has earned more than 45 AUDELCO Black Theatre Excellence Awards, and continues to be a successful institution of African-American theater. By 1986, the theatre was recognized as one of the most important arts institutions in America by President Ronald Reagan. Former New York State Governor Mario Cuomo acknowledged The National Black Theatre as \\"one of New York State‚Äôs greatest cultural treasures and resources and a cornerstone for the revitalization of 125th Street.\\" See also * The Ensemble Theatre * Barbara Ann Teer References External links *National Black Theatre Website *National Black Theatre on YouTube Category:Theatre companies in New York City Category:African-American theatre companies Category:Arts organizations established in 1968 Category:Harlem ","title":"National Black Theatre"},{"id":"45333073","text":"Filmmakers Without Borders or FWB is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that sends filmmakers and art educators overseas to teach film, media, and technology to students in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

History =Construction by the Herwarth family= Count Ferdinand Joseph von Herwarth had the palace built in classical Baroque style in 1712-18 to replace the medieval Hohenburg, which had been destroyed by fire in 1707 while occupied by Austrian troops during the War of the Spanish Succession. It is located approximately west, at the foot of the hill on which the old castle was built; stones from the ruin were used in the construction, and also to build the Lenggries parish church, St. James (), which was completed in 1722 and in which he is buried. The main building of the palace has three storeys and a hip roof with waterspouts in the shape of dragons; the central portion has a mezzanine and the corner bays an additional half storey. There were originally three wings forming a large enclosed courtyard on the east side, of which two remain. A solid clock tower rises above the central bay facing this courtyard. The interior is sumptuously decorated with frescos, paintings, statues, ornamented pillars and chandeliers. The chapel was finished in 1722. Formal gardens in the style of Versailles were laid out by Matthias Diesel. =Ownership by the Prince of Leiningen= In the early 19th century the Herwarth line died out. Schloss Hohenburg changed hands a number of times, belonging to the Zech family in 1807, the Kramer family in 1817 and the Taufkirchen family in 1833. In 1836 it and the accompanying large feudal estate were bought by Prince Carl of Leiningen (1804 - 1856), half-brother to Queen Victoria through his mother, Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, who remarried to Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn after the death of her first husband, Prince Emich Carl of Leiningen. He had changes made to the exterior of the palace, redecorated several rooms, and converted the Baroque garden to a park in the English style. He was also an enthusiastic huntsman and developed an extensive hunting preserve at Lenggries. He built the Gothic Waldleiningen Castle in the Odenwald at the same time. =Ownership by Baron von Eichthal= In 1857, after Prince Carl's death, the palace and estate were bought for only 32,000 guilders by Baron Carl von Eichthal, son of Baron Simon von Eichthal (born Seligmann), a banker who had financed art purchases by the future King Ludwig I of Bavaria and Bavarian loans to Greece and co-founded the Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechselbank and several Bavarian railway companies. Carl von Eichthal bought the secularised Abbey of St. Blaise in the Black Forest and manufactured munitions and cotton there. In 1887 the estate belonging to Schloss Hohenburg encompassed and included an inn and other businesses in Lenggries, 150 farm animals, chiefly dairy cattle, cheese manufacturing and a brewery.Landwirtschaftlicher Verein in Bayern, Handbuch des gr√∂√üeren Grundbesitzes in Bayern, Munich: Bayerischer Landwirtschaftsrat, 1879--87, repr. 1907, , p. 86 . =Ownership by the Duke of Nassau and Grand Duke of Luxembourg= The palace and its large hunting preserve were bought in February 1870 by Adolphe of Nassau-Weilburg,Pierre Even, Dynastie Luxemburg- Nassau: von den Grafen zu Nassau zu den Grossherz√∂gen von Luxemburg; eine neunhundertj√§hrige Herrschergeschichte in einhundert Biographien, Luxembourg: Schortgen, 2000, , p. 228 ; however, the Straubinger Tagblatt reported on 29 September 1868, p. 938, that Prince Adalbert of Bavaria had bought the property. who had lost his throne as Duke of Nassau to the Prussians in 1866 and had since been wandering between relatives' residences and looking for a hunting preserve. On 9 December 1890 he was sworn in as Grand Duke of Luxembourg and Schloss Hohenburg became his summer residence. He died there in 1905, and his son, William IV, spent increasing amounts of time there as his illness worsened. Following her service as regent before their daughter Marie- Ad√©la√Øde came of age, the palace then became the residence of his widow, Marie Anne of Portugal, until she and the remainder of the grand ducal family left for exile in the United States on 24 September 1939 following the outbreak of World War II. After the war the US General George S. Patton returned the property to the Grand Duchess Charlotte and the Grand Duchy. =Catholic girls' schools= In 1953 the F√ºrth industrialist Max Grundig bought the Hohenburg estate, and on 3 October that year donated the palace to the sisters of the Ursuline Convent of St. Joseph in Landshut, who opened a middle school, housekeeping training school and boarding school for girls there. The Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising took over the schools in 1990, and the nuns returned to Landshut in 2003; the property remains the site of two girls' schools, a gymnasium and a realschule. From 2007 to 2011 a specialist secondary school for social careers also operated there.

The novel consists of a loosely intertwined group of stories, all told in first person, about the owners and patrons of Bailey's Cafe, an apparently supernatural establishment, set nominally in New York City, whose entrance can be found from different places and times.Clapp, Susannah. \\"No Charge for Lost Souls: 'Bailey's Cafe' ‚Äì Gloria Naylor.\\" The Independent. Independent Digital News and Media, 12 July 1992. Plot summary and settings The unnamed owner of Bailey's Cafe (he is called \\"Bailey\\" as a nickname) acquires the cafe after his return from World War II and claims that it is magical and it saved him. Though the cafe is nominally set in New York City as per Naylor's earlier novel Mama Day,\\"Delta Dust Blues: Bailey‚Äôs Cafe.\\" Gloria Naylor: In Search of Sanctuary. Virginia C. Fowler. New York: Twayne Publishers, 1996. 121‚Äì139. patrons wander into it from different times and places. The cafe also has a back door that apparently opens onto infinity (or death). The stories he tells include his own and his wife, Nadine's, as well as those of several of the patrons of the cafe who live in a nearby brownstone including Eve (who owns the brownstone down the street that harbors mostly fugitive women and serves as a bordello), Ester (the victim of sexual and emotional abuse), \\"Miss Maple\\" (a male cross-dresser), Jessie Bell (a bisexual drug-addict), Mary (a self- mutilated beauty), and Mariam (a mentally challenged, pregnant, virgin, teenager). Each person's back story is told by the owner as they come into the cafe. Bailey frames the first-person narrative of each character but one: Nadine opens and closes the story of Mariam (Mary). Characters *\\"Bailey\\" ‚Äì the principal narrator. A World War II veteran and nominal owner of the cafe, Bailey (which is not his real name) is the cook. *Nadine ‚Äì the owner's wife and cashier in the cafe. Nadine frames the story of Mariam. *Gabe ‚Äì a Russian Jew and owner of the pawn shop that adjoins the cafe. *Sadie ‚Äì a homeless prostitute and alcoholic, who is also, according to Bailey, \\"a lady\\". Sadie was forced into prostitution at the age of 13, then married a poor taciturn man 30 years her senior. After his death she returns to prostitution, is arrested, loses her house, and is eventually evicted from a women's shelter because she will not take public assistance funds. She wanders into Bailey's Cafe from the South Side of Chicago. When the verbose Iceman asks the mostly silent Sadie to marry him, she refuses, believing she will only bring him pain. *Iceman ‚Äì works around Bailey's Cafe delivering ice. He proposes marriage to Sadie, but is rejected. *Eve ‚Äì formerly homeless, Eve owns the brownstone down the street that harbors mostly fugitive women, and also serves as a brothel, where the principal characters (sans the narrator and his wife) live. *Ester ‚Äì the victim of sexual abuse and emotional abuse. *Mary (\\"Peaches\\") ‚Äì a self-mutilated beauty. *Jessie Bell ‚Äì a bisexual drug-addict and \\"fallen woman\\". *\\"Mariam\\" (Mary) ‚Äì a 14-year-old, mentally challenged, pregnant virgin, Ethiopian Jew, Mariam is also the victim of genital mutilation (clitorectomy). When she wanders into Gabe's pawn shop he takes her directly to Bailey's, even though the two men do not get along. Mariam lives at Eve's. *\\"Miss Maple\\" (Stanley Beckwourth Booker T. Washington Carver: no surname is given) ‚Äì a male cross-dresser and former conscientious objector who served time in prison for refusing to fight, Miss Maple has a Ph.D. specializing in marketing analysis but works as housekeeper and bouncer for Eve. Born into a rowdy, rich, and powerful African American, Southern California family, Miss Maple came to Bailey's after many failed attempts to find employment in his field during which he began wearing women's clothes, supposedly due to the heat. Note: none of the characters have surnames. All characters excepting Gabe (who is Jewish) and Mariam (who is an African) are presented as African American. Themes In an interview with The Seattle Times, Naylor explained that \\"the underlying theme [of Bailey's Cafe] is how people define femaleness and female sexuality, how women have been cast in sexual roles since Eve.\\" Thus, the guests at Eve's boarding house do not fit the \\"easy sexual labels\\" used to control women's bodies.Berson. Misha. \\"Naylor's Made It ‚Äì Noted Novelist Passes Apprenticeship With Colorful Bailey's Cafe.\\" The Seattle Times. 24 September 1992. Bailey's Cafe is the first of Naylor's novels to spotlight male characters. \\"Bailey\\", the owner of the caf√©, frames the patrons‚Äô stories with his running commentary as well as narrates the story of his courtship of Nadine, his wife. In addition, Miss Maples, a cross-dressing male housekeeper and bouncer, tells the story of why he came to wearing dresses. This shift in Naylor‚Äôs exclusive interest in the stories of women has been interpreted as her desire ‚Äúto portray a different kind of male identity as well as . . . to cultivate a different relationship with her male characters.\\"\\"Naylor, Gloria.\\" Critical Survey of Long Fiction.

The song was first collected by songwriter, N. Howard \\"Jack\\" Thorp in his 1921 book Songs of the Cowboys. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. Authorship In writing about \\"Goodbye Old Paint\\", Thorp wrote: \\"Heard this sung by a puncher who had been on a spree in Pecos City. He had taken a job temporarily as a sheep-rustler for an outfit in Independence Draw, down the river, and was ashamed of the job. I won't mention his name.\\" Charley Willis, a former slave who became a cowboy and rode the Wyoming trail in the late 1800s, is now credited with authorship. Willis was in demand on cattle drives because his voice was reportedly calming to the herds. Though folklorist John Lomax did credit Willis with the authorship of the song, Lomax never recorded a performance of the song by any black person. In spite of the somewhat-concealed history of the song, many people have been credited with writing it. In 1928, a newspaper in Amarillo, Texas reported that Texas cowboy fiddler Jess Morris had composed it. Apparently Morris' arrangement had previously caught Thorp's eye. Morris never claimed to have written the song, saying that he learned it from a black cowboy named Charley Willis. Western writer and singer Jim Bob Tinsley has said that credit for saving \\"Goodbye Old Paint\\" from being forever lost \\"...belongs to three Texans: a black cowboy (Willis) who sang it on cattle drives, a cowboy who remembered it (Jess Morris) and a college professor (Lomax) who put it down on paper.\\"  References  Category:1921 songs Category:Western music (North America) ","title":"Goodbye Old Paint"},{"id":"45333117","text":"N√°rodn√° obroda (meaning National Review in English) was a Slovak newspaper published in Bratislava, Slovakia, between 1990 and 2005.

He served as the Mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, for one term, 1852‚Äì1853. Early life Barstow was born in Providence. He attended public schools as well as three terms in private school. Business career Barstow was involved in several businesses, including banking; he was president of the City Bank and helped establish the Mechanics Savings Bank. He was the first president of the Providence YMCA, and built the Providence Music Hall. But Barstow's main business venture was the Barstow Stove Company, which made cooking stoves. His company won a medal at the 1873 World's Fair in Vienna for having the best stove. Political career Barstow was active in the Temperance movement. While otherwise a Whig, in 1847, he ran for Mayor on the Temperance Party ticket and lost. In 1851 Barstow was elected to the Rhode Island General Assembly, and on January 27, 1852, Barstow delivered a prominent speech to the Rhode Island House of Representatives in favor of Rhode Island's Maine law, which was one of the early temperance bills in the United States (so named because it was modeled after an 1851 temperance law in Maine). In May 1852, Rhode Island's \\"Maine Law\\" was passed, making the sale and consumption of liquor illegal in Maine for eleven years. Barstow was inaugurated Mayor of Providence on June 7, 1852, and served one term. After serving as mayor, Barstow returned to the Rhode Island General Assembly. Barstow was chairman of the committee which planned the current Providence City Hall. In 1855, it was Barstow who recommended the site where City Hall was later built. He also became active in the abolition movement, and gave various speeches predicting the end of slavery. In 1875, President Grant appointed Barstow to the Board of Indian Commissioners, and he spent much of his time visiting the American West. Personal life Barstow was an avid Congregationalist. He attended Beneficent Congregational Church starting 1832, and helped found the High Street Congregational Church in 1834, where he became deacon. He married Eemline Mumford Eames on May 28, 1834, and had seven children; five girls and two boys.

It was inspired by Auguste Rodin's sculpture The Burghers of Calais. It is a historical comedy about the conflict between Edward III of England and his wife Philippa of Hainault over his plans to punish the leading citizens of Calais for resisting the 1346 siege. Conception Shaw had had a long friendship with the sculptor Auguste Rodin, who had made a portrait bust of the playwright, and had long admired his sculpture of The Burghers of Calais.Hare, Marion J., \\"Rodin, Shaw and the Six of Calais\\", Shaw Festival Programme, 1995. Rodin himself had once said of Shaw that his obsession with \\"cold\\" reason was \\"modified to vapour by his temperamental shyness and his Irish sense of humor\\".Tehan, Arline Boucher, The Gates of Hell, 2010. The struggle between anger, reason and humour is one of the themes of the play. Plot King Edward III of England intends to hang six leading citizens of Calais for resisting his siege of the town, but he must keep his plans from his wife Philippa, whose forgiving nature is such that she will plead for their lives. Peter Hardmouth, the leading burgher is unrepentant, and berates Edward for his warmongering. Philippa finds out about Edward's plan and uses all her wiles to persuade him to change his mind, clinching her case by saying that the brutality could adversely affect their unborn child. He eventually gives in, but decides he will use Hardmouth to get back at her. He brings in Hardmouth, who proceeds to berate the queen mercilessly. Furious, she insists that Hardmouth be punished, but now the king says she must be as forgiving as he was. The king warms to Hardmouth when he learns that he comes from Champagne, like the king's grandmother. The two bond and start playing a game which involves pretending to be dogs. The queen is not amused. She is further outraged when Edward says that he hopes some of Harmouth's spirit will enter their unborn child. He kisses her and everyone laughs. Preface The play was published along with The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles and The Millionairess in 1936. In the preface Shaw justified the apparently lightweight character of the piece, by arguing that the purpose of a play is to create elegant order from chaotic experience.Elsie Bonita Adam, Bernard Shaw and the Aesthetes, Ohio State University Press, 1971, p155. Production and reception The play was produced at the Open Air theatre in 1934. John Anthony Bertolini describes the play as a self-referential work in which the characters all performing roles. He considers it the most \\"fully realized\\" example of Shaw's conception of comic form.Bertolini, John A., The Playwrighting Self of Bernard Shaw, SIU Press, 1991, p.63-4.
