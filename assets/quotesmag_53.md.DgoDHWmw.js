Because Project Rover fell under the aegis of the Atomic Energy Commission, a way had to be found for NASA and the AEC to share a large, expensive, classified program; specifically, Los Alamos was developing technology for NASA to use. A \\"Program Office\\" was created in Washington, D.C. under the Executive branch of the U.S. Government. The Director of SNPO was H. B. Finger, known as Harry Finger, an executive branch employee. The Deputy Director of SNPO was Milton Klein, an AEC employee. The rest of the SNPO staff, approximately twenty people, was a combination of NASA and AEC employees. Their responsibilities included \\"program and resource planning and evaluation, the justification and distribution of program resources, the definition and control of overall program requirements, monitoring and reporting of progress and problems to NASA and AEC management, and the preparation of testimony to Congress.Robbins, W.H. and Finger, H.B., \\"An Historical Perspective of the NERVA Nuclear Rocket Engine Technology Program\\", NASA Contractor Report 187154/AIAA-91-3451, NASA Lewis Research Center, NASA, July 1991. SNPO was specifically tasked with creating the NERVA nuclear thermal rocket program, and immediately upon SNPO's formation it chose Aerojet and Westinghouse as NERVA's principal contractors. SNPO also chose contractors to build reactor and fuel test facilities. SNPO directed NASA funding to non- nuclear components, \\"engine system development, and design and construction of engine test facilities\\". There were three SNPO Field Offices as well. The Cleveland extension (SNPO-C), located at NASA Lewis Research Center was responsible for the management of NERVA Engine Technology Development, including the activities of industrial contractors and the construction of the new NERVA test facilities at the Nevada Test Site. The Nevada Extension (SNPO-N) managed the test site activities. The Albuquerque Extension (SNPO-A) provided liaison with LASL, which was developing the Kiwi and Phoebus reactor research programs. Los Alamos worked on reactors with progressively higher temperatures, power density and power, along with the non-trivial problem of fuel corrosion. SNPO also had the authority to choose the technical direction for KIWI and Phoebus development at LASL. Finger left SNPO in early 1969 to become NASA's Associate Administrator for Organization and Management. He was replaced by Milton Klein. The Space Nuclear Propulsion Office came to an end when the Nixon Administration ended the NERVA program in 1972.

TEPD in the nose The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) is usually based on high sweat chloride concentrations, characteristic clinical findings (including sinopulmonary infections), and/or family history. However, a small portion of patients with cystic fibrosis especially those with \\"mild\\" mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) ion channel, have near-normal sweat tests. In these cases, a useful diagnostic, adjunct involves measuring the nasal transepithelial potential difference (ie, the charge on the respiratory epithelial surface as compared to interstitial fluid). Individuals with cystic fibrosis have a significantly more negative nasoepithelial surface than normal, due to increased luminal sodium absorption. In most exocrine glands, the CFTR protein normally secretes chloride ions into the lumen, and also has a tonic inhibitory effect on the opening of the apical sodium channel (which absorbs sodium into the cell). Impaired CFTR functioning directly reduces ductal epithelial chloride secretion and indirectly increases sodium absorption through lack of CFTR's inhibitory effect on the apical sodium channel. The result is dehydrated mucus and a widened, negative transepithelial potential difference. The nasal TEPD is increased in cystic fibrosis, making it a potential diagnostic tool for this disorder. TEPD in the kidney In the kidney, TEPD contributes to tubular reabsorption.  TEER Measurement  Transepithelial / transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) is an electrophysiological technique widely adopted for use in Organ-on-a-chip systems. It uses Ohmic contact resistance to serve as a proxy for the permeability of a cellular monolayer. TEER therefore enables researchers to miniaturize assays such as Caco-2 permeability, Blood–brain barrier transfer, or membrane integrity assays in Microfluidic systems.

It lies in a small valley through which the River Cledwen flows and has been winner of 'Best Kept Village' on four occasions. Its church is dedicated to Saint Winefrid (Welsh: Gwenfrewy gwenfrewi; Medieval Latin: Winefrida). In the centre of the village opposite the Lion Inn is the Church of St Winifred which was built and dedicated to her in 1869. The church is believed to have originated in the mid-600s CE up by Prince Eleri who then went on to set up a double monastery in the village. He was the Abbot to the monks, and his cousin's daughter, St. Gwenffrewi, was the Abbess to the nuns. In the churchyard are three ancient yew trees and a row of four ancient standing stones approximately one metre high and aligned roughly east to west. The first stone carries a carving and what appears to be a 'W'. The church is one of the major places visited on the North Wales Pilgrims Way. In Literature Gwytherin is the setting for much of the action in the novel A Morbid Taste for Bones, first published in 1977 by Ellis Peters.

It displays functional selectivity (also known as \\"biased agonism\\") by strongly activating 5-HT1A receptors in the postsynaptic prefrontal cortex while having little effect on somatodendritic autoreceptors in the raphe nucleus. As a result, it has been touted as a preferential postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor agonist and has been investigated as a novel potential antidepressant. In cognitive tests in rodent, F-15,599 attenuates memory deficits elicited by the NMDA receptor antagonist PCP, suggesting that it may improve cognitive function in disorders such as schizophrenia. A subsequent study showed that F-15,599 reduces breathing irregularity and apneas observed in mice with mutations of the MeCP2 gene.

History Before the Spaniards came to America the South Belt area was dominated by the Karankawa natives. Explorers that came into the area feared the Karankawas and viewed them as savages and cannibals. However when settlers first began to settle in the area they were greeted by somewhat neighborly natives. In the 19th and early 20th century the area that is now known as South Belt was mainly used for farming and ranching. By the 1960s however the Ayrshire Development Corp., who had bought the land, began to look into developing the area. In 1963 Ayrshire built five homes and established a water district. A year later he sold the first home to the George West family. The area began to grow and develop quickly until the 1980s when it became known that toxic waste had been dumped in the area by Brio Refining Inc. and was causing a high number of birth defects in children living in the South Bend subdivision. Because of this 677 homes and Arlyne S. Weber Elementary were demolished and the site became the Brio Superfund site. In the 2000s the area began to flourish again as many new homes and businesses were built in the area including the Clear Brook Landing subdivision which was built near the Superfund Site and a new Weber Elementary which is on Blackhawk Blvd. Libraries South Belt/Ellington is serviced by branches of both the Harris County Public Library (Parker Williams Libraryhttp://www.hcpl.net/location/parker-williams-branch-library) and Houston Public Library (Bracewell Library).http://www.hpl.lib.tx.us/hpl- locations Education=Public schools South Belt is served by both the Pasadena Independent School District and Clear Creek Independent School District.

He was the first child of Sigmund Freud’s eldest son Jean-Martin (Martin), a lawyer, and his wife Ernestine Drucker. He was named after Anton von Freund, a colleague of his grandfather. After leaving Vienna in March 1938https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/mar/09/guardianobituaries.military1 Freud's parents separated and he and his father went to Britain whilst his mother and sister Sophie went to Paris before emigrating to the USA. While he was a student at Loughborough College, he and his father were interned as enemy aliens in May 1940. He was first held in a prison in Leicester and then on the Isle of Man. In July, he was deported to Australia aboard the . He was allowed to return to the United Kingdom in October 1941 due to a refinement in internment policy. He then joined the Royal Pioneer Corps in which he worked for eighteen months, before he was allowed to join the Special Operations Executive in 1943, due in part to his being a native German speaker. In April 1945 he parachuted into Styria in the Austrian Alps to help establish a British presence in advance of the approaching Red Army. Though he became separated from his comrades he managed to bluff his way into the strategically important Zeltweg airfield; posing as a representative of the advancing British Eighth Army, he convinced the Commandant to surrender it to the allied forces.Fry, Helen (2009). Freuds' War. Stroud: The History Press, pp. 161-65 After the war he was an investigator with the War Crimes Investigation Unit. He was the first person to interrogate Bruno Tesch of Tesch & Stabenow, the firm responsible for supplying much of the Zyklon B which was used in Nazi extermination camps. Freud was also involved in the trial of Alfried Krupp of Krupp Industries, indicted for the use of slave labor, and he was also involved in the investigation of the murder of twenty children in the basement of the Bullenhuser Damm school in Hamburg. After leaving active duty in September 1946 with the rank of major, he married Annette Krarup, a Danish civil servant he met in Copenhagen during the Krupp investigation. After naturalising as a British subject in January 1947 Freud returned to Loughborough, where he graduated with a degree in chemical engineering. He was hired by British Oxygen Corporation, then went to work for British Nylon Spinners in Pontypool. He was recruited by British Hydrocarbons based in London in 1957, which after a series of mergers became part of BP Chemicals where he remained until his retirement at the age of 55 in 1977.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1453935/Walter-Freud.html In 1994 he returned to Vienna for the first time since his enforced exile as a guest of the Austrian government who marked his achievement in liberating the Zeltweg airfield by hosting a dinner there in his honour.Freud, David (2006) Freud in the City, London: BFP, p. 177 His last residence in Britain was in Oxted, Surrey.

His defeat of William O'Brien in West Mayo in 1910 was a decisive defeat for O'Brien's All-for-Ireland League. Like the rest of the Irish Party, William Doris supported the United Kingdom during the First World War, and this led to alienation from his brother Patrick. His own defeat in West Mayo in 1918 is the largest fall in percentage share of vote (65.1%See United Kingdom general election records#Constituency). Doris was first recorded in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, Westminster, on 15 March 1910 on the topic of Old Age Pensions (Ireland). He was last recorded in the Commons, on 14 November 1918 under the topic of Evicted Tenants. He was a Whip of the Irish Parliamentary Party under the leadership of John Redmond during this period.UK Parliament In letters to the Irish Independent in 1924, William Doris wrote a stout defence of the Irish Parliamentary Party in relation to Irish partition. He pointed out that one of the principal consequences of the Sinn Féin policy of refusing to take up seats in the Westminster Parliament was that the establishment of a Protestant-dominated parliament in Northern Ireland in the Government of Ireland Act 1920 went through with little opposition. '...the handing over of the lives and properties, and the social, political, commercial and religious interests of 350,000 Catholics and Nationalists in the North to the tender mercies of an Orange parliament in Belfast has been the direct result of the destruction of the Irish Party in 1918. The 1920 Partition Act was carried because there was nobody to oppose it.' The Independent refused to print Doris's letters in full, and they were therefore printed by his former Parliamentary colleague J. P. Hayden in his newspaper, the Westmeath Examiner, 5 July 1924, under the heading 'The Canker of Partition'. Doris Street in Irishtown in Dublin 4 was named after William Doris.

The campaign was part of Qin's campaigns to unify China under its rule. It resulted in a decisive victory for the Zhao forces, led by General Li Mu, against the Qin invaders. Opening moves In 234 BCE, the Qin forces defeated the Zhao armies at Pingyang (平陽; south-east of present-day Ci County, Hebei province). In the following year, the Qin army led by Huan Ji (桓齮) embarked from Shangdang (上黨) and attacked the Zhao army from the rear. The Zhao army sustained over 100,000 casualties and its commander, Hu Zhe (扈輒), was killed in action. Huan Ji's force crossed Mount Taihang and conquered the Zhao territories of Chili (赤麗) and Yi'an (宜安), both in the south-east of present- day Shijiazhuang, Hebei province. The battle King Qian of Zhao recalled Li Mu, a general famous for his success in defending Zhao's northern border from the Xiongnu, and appointed Li as the commander-in-chief of the Zhao armies to resist the Qin invaders. Li Mu's army from the northern border met the Zhao forces from Handan at Yi'an and engaged the Qin army there. Li Mu felt that the Qin army's morale was high after its earlier victories, so it would be unwise for Zhao to attack Qin then. He ordered his troops to strengthen their fortifications and defences while waiting for an opportunity to launch an counteroffensive. Huan Ji felt that a swift conclusion to the battle was necessary since his troops were growing weary after so many earlier battles, so he led his force to attack Fei, intending to lure the Zhao army there to defend their position. Li Mu's deputy, Zhao Cong (趙蔥), suggested to Li to send a force to rescue Fei, but Li refused. As the bulk of the Qin army had left to attack Fei, the Qin camp was poorly defended so Li Mu seized the opportunity to order his troops to launch an offensive on the Qin camp. The Zhao forces scored a major victory in the ensuing battle and captured several prisoners- of-war and supplies. As Li Mu predicted that Huan Ji would retreat from Fei to save the camp, he ordered his men to lay an ambush on Huan Ji's retreat route. Huan Ji's retreating troops fell into the ambush. Qin sustained over 100,000 casualties in the battle and its army was almost completely wiped out. Huan Ji succeeded in breaking out of the encirclement and he escaped to the Yan state to avoid punishment for his defeat.

She was likely born around 1533 in the Comté d'Eu of a noble family.Feugère, 1860, p. 63. Biography She entered the convent in the priory of Poissy at a very young age, where she proved to be gifted in ancient languages as well as in creative writing. The education Anne de Marquets received in the convent was certainly exceptional for a young girl of her time. In sixteenth-century France, the convent was a place where women had more access to education than in the outside world.Berriot-Salvadore, 1990, p. 422. As part of her education, Anne even studied with the humanist printer Henri Estienne.Ferguson, 1997, p. 11. In 1561, Anne de Marquets attended the Colloquy at Poissy, an event which would influence her poetry. Following the colloquy, she wrote several poems and prayers in verse for Catholic leaders.Feugère, p. 65. This first collection of poems, entitled Sonets, prières et devises, was published in 1562, and dedicated to Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine. Following this, she began to collaborate with the irenic theologian, Claude D'Espence. In 1568, she proved herself to be a talented Latinist when she published a translation of Marcantonio Flaminio's De Rebus Divinis Carmina (1550), a collection of Latin devotional poems, under the title Les Divines Poésies de Marc Antoine Flaminius (The Divine Poems of Marc Antonio Flaminio). The volume also includes original poems by the Dominican about spiritual subjects. Her poetic talent was praised by several of the greatest poets of her time, such as Pierre de Ronsard.Ferguson, p. 78-79. Anne de Marquets died in 1588. A book of her sonnets, Les Sonets spirituels, was published in 1605. Though this publication was posthumous, the poems in the book had already circulated in manuscript.Berriot-Salvadore, p. 427-28. In the past few decades, scholars have begun to recognise the talent that won her so much praise in the sixteenth century: \\"These sonnets form a complete devotional sequence of 480 sonnets […] they are therefore far more advanced, in terms of the application of systematic devotional practice to poetry, than anything written in the 1570s and 1580s.\\"Cave, 1969, p. 86. Anne de Marquets' sonnets are also noteworthy because they exhibit the influence of post- Tridentine spirituality, in particular an interaction with contemporary meditation techniques.Ferguson, p. 44. Like her contemporary, Gabrielle de Coignard, her poems all touch on religious (Catholic) themes and imagery. See also Notes  References  * Berriot-Salvadore, Évelyne.

As part of a marketing effort, some users of sears.com and kmart.com were invited to download an application developed for SHMC that ran in the background on users' computers collecting information on nearly all internet activity. The tracking aspects of the program were only disclosed in legalese in the middle of the End User License Agreement. The FTC found this was insufficient disclosure given consumers expectations and the detailed information being collected. On September 9, 2009 the FTC approved a consent decree with SHMC requiring full disclosure of its activities and destruction of previously obtained information.Press Release, FTC, FTC Approves Final Consent Order Requiring Sears to Disclose the Installation of Tracking Software Placed on Consumers’ Computers, (Sept. 9, 2009) The case=Background From April 2007 until January 2008 SHMC offered about 15% of the visitors to its websites the opportunity to join the My SHC Community. Selected visitors saw a pop-up advertisement that asked \\"Ever wish you could talk directly to a retailer? Tell them about the products, services and offers that would really be right for you?\\" It then gave visitors a chance to join the \\"My SHC Community\\", \\"a dynamic and highly interactive on-line community... where your voice is heard and your opinion matters, and what you want and need counts!\\" If visitors agreed, they provided an email address and were sent a follow-up email with more details about the community. This email contained the first mention of a research software program that users were asked to download. The application would \\"confidentially track [] online browsing.\\" This revelation was buried amongst a lot of other text describing more overt participation in the community such as: > We'll ask you to journal your shopping and purchasing behavior. Again, this > will be when you want and how you want to record it – always on your terms > and always by your choice. We'll also collect information on your internet > usage. Community engagements are always fun and always voluntary! Consumers received $10 in exchange for joining the \\"community\\" as long as they kept the application running for at least one month. Most of the content of the email focused upon direct participation in the online community, with only limited references to the application that would be collecting massive amounts of information. The Privacy Statement and End User License Agreement, provided more details, but only if users scrolled down 75 lines in a small text box that displayed ten lines of text at a time. The Agreement revealed that the application would be collecting detailed information about the computer that the application was installed on in addition to: > all of the Internet behavior that occurs on the computer on which you > install the application, including both your normal web browsing and the > activity that you undertake during secure sessions, such as filling a > shopping basket, completing an application form or checking your online > accounts, which may include personal financial or health information. We may > use the information that we monitor, such as name and address, for the > purpose of better understanding your household demographics; however we make > commercially viable efforts to automatically filter confidential personally > identifiable information such as UserID, password, credit card numbers, and > account numbers. Inadvertently, we may collect such information about our > panelists; and when this happens, we make commercially viable efforts to > purge our database of such information. The application basically captured all internet activity and only made token efforts to prevent the collection of passwords. Although the agreement said they did not examine the text of IMs or email messages, they did collect email header information. Once the application was installed there was almost no indication that it was running on a user's computer. The complaint noted the lack of system tray icon or other visible indication other than \\"srhc.exe\\" being listed as a running process in Windows Task Manager. The FTC concluded that although SMHC made some disclosures about the application and the information it collected, they \\"failed to disclose adequately.\\" Because the application \\"monitor[ed] nearly all of the Internet behavior that occurs on consumers' computers\\" including detailed transaction information with websites not affiliated with SMHC and then transmitted that information to SHMC remote servers, the minimal disclosures provided in the email and buried in the license agreement were inadequate. The FTC found that details about the information collected \\"would be material to consumers in deciding to install the software.\\" As a result, SHMC's \\"failure to disclose these facts, in light of the representations made, was, and is, a deceptive practice.\\" Consent decree SMHC consented to the FTC's order that they \\"clearly and prominently\\"\\"In textual communications (e.g., printed publications or words displayed on the screen of a computer), the required disclosures are of a type, size, and location sufficiently noticeable for an ordinary consumer to read and comprehend them, in print that contrasts with the background on which they appear;\\" In the Matter of Sears Holdings Management Corporation, Consent Agreement at 3. disclose on a separate screen from the privacy policy or license agreement (1) \\"all of the types of data that the Tracking Application will monitor, record or transmit;\\" (2) \\"how the data may be used;\\" and (3) \\"whether the data may be used by a third party.\\" They were also required to obtain opt-in consent from future users.In the Matter of Sears Holdings Management Corporation, Consent Agreement For existing users of the application, SMHC was required to contact and notify the users of what the application did and provide assistance in removing it. They further had to place a clear and prominent notice on the website. Finally, they had to destroy all of the data obtained from consumers prior to the consent decree. Significance of the action=Departure from legal precedent Although, section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. § 45) grants the FTC power to investigate and prevent deceptive trade practices, this decision came as a surprise to a number of legal observers. SMHC probably thought it was doing everything legally required to use its application to collect detailed information on consumers. Courts have frequently found that terms buried within licensee agreements are enforceable—even when the terms are in small print in text boxes like the ones in the SMHC case.See e.g., Feldman v. Google, Inc., 513 F.Supp.2d 229 (E.D. Pa. 2007), Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp., 150 F. Supp. 2d 585 (S.D.N.Y.2001) (finding the agreement not enforceable, but only because users did not have to click \\"I accept\\" to download the software). Often referred to as clickwrap agreements, in these cases courts have found that by clicking \\"I accept\\" users became legally bound by all of the terms of the licensee agreement even if they did not read them. Contractually, companies are usually free to create whatever terms they want as long as they are disclosed in legalese somewhere in the licensee agreement or terms of use. The FTC has indicated through this case that while this fiction may be adequate to form a contract, it is not adequate to avoid deceptive practices. Unread agreements do not relieve companies of their duty not to deceive consumers by omitting material terms. The ruling suggests that companies have a duty to appropriately set consumer expectations and they cannot rely upon the fiction that users have read license agreements. Rather, if a company's application or website collects information or behaves in ways that consumers would not expect, the company has a duty to inform the consumer of what the application or website does. FTC's online privacy agenda The FTC has long worked to protect consumer privacy in different arenas. Its goal is to \\"protect consumers' personal information and to ensure that consumers have confidence to take advantage of the many benefits offered by the ever-changing marketplace.\\"FTC, Promoting Consumer Privacy: Accountability and Transparency in the Modern World, Oct. 2, 2009 Although the goal may have remained constant, the means of accomplishing it have changed over time as the marketplace changes. This decision is part of a broader FTC effort to protect consumer privacy online. An article released by the FTC stated their goal of making individuals responsible for the data they share on the internet, but this is premised on \\"transparency of privacy practices\\" by companies so that consumers can make informed decisions. This theory of privacy and the complaint and subsequent consent decree are based upon the FTC Fair Information Practice principles (FIPs). This set of principles focus upon requiring full disclosure of the data being collected so that users can make informed decisions about whether to participate. The application deployed by SMHC clearly violated these principles. Presumably SMHC's goal in collecting the massive amount of data was to be able to better market products to consumers. This type of profiling in order to advertise is often referred to as behavioral advertising, which has received significant attention due to its privacy invasive nature.Stephanie Clifford, Web Privacy on the Radar in Congress, N.Y. Times, Aug. 11, 2008 at C1 The Network Advertising Initiative was launched to help manage public concern over this issue, which came to a head during the Facebook Beacon scandal. Although the Beacon scandal did not result in FTC action, complaints were filed with the FTC and Facebook users brought a class action lawsuit.Caroline McCarthy, Facebook Notifies Members About Beacon Settlement, CNET, Dec. 3, 2009 Since then, the FTC has issued behavioral advertising guidelines and Congress has held hearings and is considering legislationRyan Singel, Online Privacy Law On The Way, Congressman Promises, Wired, April 23, 2009 on the subject.

Often used as traditional fishing boats, they are still used in a few places around the world, though they have generally been replaced with planked boats. Reed boats can be distinguished from reed rafts, since reed boats are usually waterproofed with some form of tar.McGrail S (1985) Towards a classification of Water transport World Archeology, 16 (3). As well as boats and rafts, small floating islands have also been constructed from reeds. The earliest discovered remains from a reed boat are 7000 years old, found in Kuwait. Reed boats are depicted in early petroglyphs and were common in Ancient Egypt. A famous example is the ark of bulrushes in which the baby Moses was set afloat. They were also constructed from early times in Peru and Bolivia, and boats with remarkedly similar design have been found in Easter Island. Reed boats are still used in Peru, Bolivia, Ethiopia, and until recently in Corfu. The explorations and investigations of the Norwegian ethnographer and adventurer Thor Heyerdahl have resulted in a better understanding of the construction and capabilities of reed boats. History Petroglyphs of a reed boat and men Detail. Fabrication of papyrus boats in ancient Egypt. Wall fragment from the Sun Temple of Nyuserre Ini at Abu Gurob, Egypt. c. 2430 BCE. Neues Museum The image on the right shows petroglyphs of a reed boat and men. The reed boat is similar to those depicted in cave paintings in Scandinavia, something that led Thor Heyerdahl to theorise that the Scandinavians came from the area that today is Azerbaijan. In the Gobustan Petroglyph Reserve there are more than 6,000 petroglyphs carved by the hunter- gatherers that lived in these caves 12,000 years ago. At that time the Caspian Sea was much higher and washed against the lower rocks of the hill. Another site is Wadi Hammamat in Qift, Egypt, where there are drawings of Egyptian reed boats dated to 4000 BCMcGrail, Seán (2004) Boats of the World: From the Stone Age to Medieval Times Oxford University Press. papyrus reeds to make boats The oldest known remnants of a boat made with reeds (and tar) are from a 7000-year-old seagoing boat found in Failaka Island, Kuwait. The Ancient Egyptians built boats from papyrus reeds, which were widely cultivated along the Nile River and Delta. This reed was also used for many other purposes, especially for providing papyrus writing parchments. Other reeds of the genus Cyperus may have been used as well. Theophrastus in his History of PlantsSir Arthur F. Hort, (1916), Theophrastus: Enquiry into Plants Loeb Classical Library. states that the rigging on King Antigonus' fleet, used to fasten the doors when Ulysses slew the suitors in his hall,Odyssey xxi. 390. was made from papyrus reed. Light skiffs suitable for the navigation of the Nile were constructed with stems cut from papyrus reed, as shown by bas-reliefs from the fourth dynasty where men cut papyrus, and use it to make cordage and sails and to build a reed boat. According to the Bible, when the Pharaoh issued a decree to kill all the Israelite males, the baby Moses was saved by his mother, who set him adrift on the Nile in an ark of bulrushes.Exodus Chapter 1 Pages 15-16. The bulrushes this small boat or basket was built with may have been papyrus. The prophet Isaiah refers to Ethiopian vessels of reed in . Thor Heyerdahl The reed boat Ra II In more recent years, the explorations and investigations of the Norwegian ethnographer and adventurer Thor Heyerdahl, 1914–2002, have resulted in a better appreciation of the construction and capabilities of reed boats. Heyerdahl wanted to demonstrate that ancient Mediterranean or African people could have crossed the Atlantic and reached the Americas by sailing with the Canary Current. In 1969, Heyerdahl constructed a reed boat he named Ra after the ancient Egyptian sun god. Its design was based on ancient Egyptian models and drawings. The boat was built by boatmen from Lake Chad in the Republic of Chad with papyrus reeds from Lake Tana in Ethiopia. It was launched off the coast of Morocco, and set sail in an attempt to cross the Atlantic. After several weeks, its crew modified the vessel in a manner that caused Ra to sag and take on water. Eventually Ra broke apart and was abandoned. The following year, Heyerdahl organised the building of another similar boat, the Ra II. Boat builders from Lake Titicaca built this in Bolivia. Again, the vessel set sail from Morocco, succeeding this time and reaching Barbados.Ryne, Linn. Voyages into History at Norway. In 1978, Heyerdahl constructed a third reed boat, the Tigris. The purpose of building this vessel was to demonstrate that Mesopotamia could have been linked through trade and migration to the Indus Valley Civilization, now modern-day Pakistan. Tigris was constructed in Iraq and sailed along the Persian Gulf, then to Pakistan, finally entering the Red Sea. She remained at sea in a seaworthy manner for five months. Then in Djibouti, Tigris was burnt deliberately in protest at the wars that were then raging everywhere around the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa. Reed boats of Lake Titicaca This sturdy reed boat of the Uros Islands can hold more than 20 people Totora reeds grow in South America, particularly around Lake Titicaca, and also on Easter Island. These reeds have been used by various pre-Columbian South American civilizations to build reed boats. The boats, called balsa, vary in size from small fishing canoes to thirty metres long. They are still used on Lake Titicaca, located on the border of Peru and Bolivia, 3810 m above sea level. The Uros are an indigenous people pre-dating the Incas. They live, still today, on man-made floating islands scattered across Lake Titicaca. These islands are also constructed from totora reeds.Encyclopædia Britannica Online: Lake Titicaca. Retrieved 12 July 2007. Each floating island supports between three and ten houses, also built of reeds. The Uros still build totora reed boats, which they use for fishing and hunting seabirds. Reed boat craftsmen from Suriqui, a town on the Bolivian side of lake Titicaca, helped Thor Heyerdahl construct Ra II and Tigris. Thor Heyerdahl attempted to prove that the reed boats of Lake Titicaca derived from the papyrus boats of Egypt. Near the south-eastern shore of Lake Titicaca lie the ruins of the ancient city state of Tiwanaku. Tiwanaku contains monumental architecture characterized by large stones of exceptional workmanship.Isbell, W. H., 2004, Palaces and Politics in the Andean Middle Horizon. in S. T. Evans and J. Pillsbury, eds., pp. 191-246. Palaces of the Ancient New World. Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection Washington, D.C.

She was named American Champion Older Female Horse at the 2006 Eclipse Awards, an honor she is best known for.  Background  The dark bay Fleet Indian was bred in New York by the Thomas-Lakin partnership. She was sired by Indian Charlie, winner of the 1998 Santa Anita Derby, who was in turn sired by four-time Gr.I winner In Excess. Fleet Indian's dam Hulstleeta was sired by Afleet, the 1987 Canadian Horse of the Year. Fleet Indian was known for her large, over-sized frame. Standing at 17 hands high, she was given the nickname \\"Large Marge\\". Fleet Indian was sold at auction twice before making her race debut, the first time selling for $40,000 at the 2002 Fasig-Tipton New York Yearling Sale, and again for $230,000 at Ocala's Two-Year-Olds in Training Sale. She was again sold at the beginning of 2006 in the Keeneland January Horses of All Ages Sale, being bought by Paul H. Saylor for a price tag of $290,000.  Racing career = 2004: Sophomore Season  Fleet Indian was originally trained by James \\"Jimmy\\" Toner, later being transferred to Todd Pletcher's barn in 2006, during championship season. Fleet Indian did not race as a juvenile. She made her first start at Aqueduct Racetrack on April 9, 2004, in a maiden race, which she won in a hand-ride by over 8 lengths. She won her following three races, and made her graded stakes debut in the Alabama Stakes, going into the race undefeated in four starts. The Alabama field was notable in that it featured Ashado, who was named Champion Juvenile Filly the year before, and who would be named Champion Three-Year-Old Filly of 2004. Fleet Indian finished a disappointing fifth in the race behind Yearly Report, Ashado, Stellar Jayne, and winner Society Selection. Fleet Indian followed her poor performance with a third-place finish in an allowance the next month. After the allowance, she made her final start of 2004 in the Iroquios Handicap, an ungraded black-type race at Belmont Park, finishing fourth.  2005: Four-Year-Old Season  After going 10 months without a race, Fleet Indian opened her career as an older mare in August 2005 in an allowance race at Saratoga, finishing ninth and last of the field. She greatly improved on her recent poor races next-out when she won an allowance, this time at Belmont Park. Afterwards, she again contested the Iroquios Handicap, finishing eighth. This would mark the end of Fleet Indian's poor performances. Fleet Indian won her first stakes race, and first of many, after the Iroquios, when she won the Montauk Handicap at Aqueduct. She closed out her 2005 campaign with another allowance race.  2006: Championship Season  Fleet Indian returned to graded stakes company in the first race of what would become her Championship year. Now trained by Todd Pletcher, Fleet Indian entered the Gr.III Next Move Handicap, one of the favorites in the small field of four. She on the race by just over a length, with a final time of 1:49.32. Following her graded win, Fleet Indian contested another, this time the Gr.III Sixty Sails Handicap. The race favorite, she dominated the field of 8, pulling away in the stretch to win by over 12 lengths. Her next race was the ungraded black-type Obeah Stakes at Delaware Park, a race Fleet Indian was using as a prep for the prestigious Gr.II Delaware Handicap. She won the Obeah by over 7 lengths. Next came the Delaware Handicap. Once again the 2–5 favorite for the race, Fleet Indian broke cleanly from the gate, and led the field early on. She won the race by 5 1/2 lengths in gate-to-wire fashion. Fleet Indian won her first Gr.I race, the Personal Ensign, next out, winning by 4 lengths, again in gate-to-wire fashion. Fleet Indian looked to keep her seven-race winning streak going when she contested the Gr.I Beldame Stakes, a final prep for the Breeders' Cup Distaff. Unlike most of her other races, Fleet Indian was confronted down the stretch by familiar foe Balletto, and the two dueled to the wire. Fleet Indian narrowly prevailed, however, by a head victory over Balletto. Round Pond notable finished third in the race. = 2006 Breeders' Cup Distaff = Fleet Indian was made the co-favorite for the 2006 Breeders' Cup Distaff, alongside Pine Island. Fleet Indian broke well, but raced far back in the pack, which was unusual for the mare who typically raced on or close to the lead. Entering the turn, Fleet Indian labored and was pulled up, shortly being vanned off. Entering the stretch, Pine Island dislocated her left front fetlock and fell. Like Fleet Indian, she was rushed onto an equine ambulance and vanned off. After the race, which was won by Beldame Stakes third-place finisher Round Pond, it was discovered that Fleet Indian had suffered a lateral colyndar fracture. Fleet Indian had surgery at Dr. Larry Bramlage's Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, and survived her injuries. Pine Island was not so lucky, however, and she was euthanized shorty after the Distaff. Her injuries career-ending, Fleet Indian was retired with a record of 19: 13–0–1 and earnings of $1,704,513. Fleet Indian was named the 2006 American Champion Older Dirt Female Horse for her racing efforts in 2006.  Retirement = Recovery  Fleet Indian was originally supposed to be sold at auction as a broodmare prospect at either Keeneland's November Breeding Stock Sale, but her injury kept her out of the sale. Her injury proved to be worse than initially thought; veterinarians discovered that she had also suffered an injury to her cannon bone. After her second surgery to repair the cannon bone, Fleet Indian's recovery went smoothly. While in recovery, Fleet Indian was bred to champion sire Storm Cat.  Broodmare career  Fleet Indian was offered at the 2007 Keeneland November Breeding Stock Sale in foal with a colt by Storm Cat. The now six-year-old mare failed to reach her reserve price, $3.9 million. She was sold privately to Summer Wind Farm after the sale. Fleet Indian produced four foals during her career as a broodmare: * Fleet of Gold (2011 filly by Medaglia d'Oro)- Stakes-placed earner of $106,892 * Storm N Indian (2008 colt by Storm Cat)- Earner of $8,940, failed to win in two starts. Now an eventing horse. * Fleeting Smile (2010 filly by Distorted Humor)- Sent to race in Great Britain, two-time winner with earnings of £22,469. * Indyan Giving (2009 filly by A.P. Indy)- Unraced. Dam of Game Winner (Breeders' Cup Juvenile, Del Mar Futurity, American Pharoah Stakes)  Death  Champion Fleet Indian was euthanized on the night of October 1, 2011, due to complications from colic. The mare had been sent to Rood and Riddle Hospital a few days prior. Summer Wind Farm, who owned the mare all throughout her retirement, released a statement regarding the passing of fleet Indian\\\\- \\"Where do you begin to describe a mare like Fleet Indian? She seemed too grand for words. She was Fleet Indian. She was an incredible racehorse. She was awe inspiring. She was a champion. She was Fleet Indian. She broke her leg. She survived. She was a fighter. She was Fleet Indian. She was a wonderful broodmare. She was a loving mother. Her first foal was a sales topper, no surprise. She was Fleet Indian. She was big and beautiful. She was kind and gentle. She was Fleet Indian. She graced our pastures and our lives. Now our hearts break. May God smile on her in heaven. May she live on in our hearts and in her foals. After all, she was Fleet Indian.\\"  Honors  In addition to being named an Eclipse Champion, a four-year college scholarship was awarded in Fleet Indian's name. Through the Race for Education program, the scholarship was awarded to a child of a worker in the racing industry. Saratoga Race Course honored the mare by naming a race in her honor, the Fleet Indian Stakes. Run at 1 1/16 miles on dirt, the restricted race is for New York-bred sophomore fillies. The inaugural running of the race was held on August 1, 2007, on what was named \\"Fleet Indian Day\\", a day created to promote the scholarship, which was also awarded to its winner that day.

It is a former deep-water, cargo-handling facility originally built to facilitate the export of sugar, timber and coal. The pier, served by the extension of the railway line from Pialba, was used for the transfer of cargo between rail and ships. It was built between 1913 and 1917, originally to a length of 1107 metres. The pier was closed in 1985, and 239 metres of it was demolished. However, due to public outcry, 868 metres of the pier was left, and the land was given to the Hervey Bay City Council (now the Fraser Coast Regional Council). By 2009 the last 220-metre section of the pier had been fully restored, and the original timber pylons had been replaced with steel pylons with a plastic covering.  History  Aerial photograph of Hervey Bay looking north across the Urangan Pier, 1967 The original proposal to establish Urangan as a coal port for the Burrum River mining project did not eventuate due to several factors, mainly because the coal output did not reach original expectations. However, as the Wide Bay area was a chief producer of produce and freight, the Queensland Government made a decision to build a pier at Hervey Bay. Urangan Seawall, Pier in the background A plaque at the Urangan Pier; placed in 1999, commemorating the re-opening of the Urangan Pier. Construction on the Urangan Pier began in 1913. To reach the deep water channel, it was required to extend (3690 ft) out to sea. Construction was very slow and finished in 1917. The Urangan railway line also began construction in 1913 and branched off the main railway line at Pialba. This line was extended along the Urangan Pier as it was being constructed. Once it was completed, it served as one of the main ports of Queensland.Urangan Pier Project Notice Urangan Pier in April 2010 Sugar was one of the main exports, however had to be transported from as far north as Bundaberg. When the Bundaberg Port was built in 1958, it took over sugar exports and the Urangan pier ceased exporting sugar. Timber, general cargo and produce was still exported until 1960, when Caltex built an oil terminal adjacent to the Pier. Soon after this was built, freight, goods and produce exports were stopped and fuel became the only import from the pier. After the last ship docked at the Urangan pier in January 1985, Caltex Oil reversed the process of storage, replacing the system of fuel service from Shipping to bulk supply by rail from the Pinkenba and Colmslie port terminals in Brisbane. This, in turn, led to the closure of the pier and the Urangan branch line, as neither had a use any more. At this stage, the pier was in serious need of repairs. A decision was made by the Queensland Government to dismantle the entire pier. Due to large public outcry, rallying and petitions, the demolition of the pier was stopped. In late 1985, the Queensland Government handed the pier to the Hervey Bay City Council. The council pledged to restore the pier, which began in the late 1990s. Restoration included removing the rail tracks from the pier, encasing the wooden pylons with steel, repairing sleepers, repairing hand rails, and repairing lights. In 1999, the pier was restored to a length of 868 meters. It was officially re-opened by the then-governor of Queensland and the mayor of Hervey Bay, Peter Arnison and Bill Brennan (respectively) on 27 November 1999.Pier history, Hervey Bay, Australia. Retrieved 27 June 2012.  Urangan Pier model  A model of the pier was made by Mr Harry Coxon in 1917, the same year the original pier was constructed. It is a significant artefact in the Hervey Bay Historical Village & Museum's collection. Two new models are on display in the Hervey Bay Tourism Visitor Centre and in the Hervey Bay Whale Watch office at the Boat Harbour Marina. Urangan Pier Festival The first Pier Festival was held in 1986 to help raise funds to save Urangan Pier. Since then it has become a popular fishing competition held annually in September.  Pier to Pub Swim Pier to Pub Ocean Swim Classic is an annual swimming competition held in April since 1999. The swim is from Urangan Pier to the jetty opposite the Torquay Hotel, while the short swim, called Splash for Cash, is from the corner of the Esplanade and Alexander Street to the jetty opposite the Torquay Hotel.

He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1952 to 1955 and a second stint from 1963 to 1971 sitting both times with the governing Social Credit caucus. Political career Leavitt would run for a seat in the 1952 Alberta general election. He ran as a Social Credit candidate in the electoral district of Banff-Cochrane. Leavitt easily won the district defeating two other candidates, including Independent Social Credit incumbent Arthur Wray. Leavitt ran for a second term in the 1955 Alberta general election. He was defeated in a hotly contested fight by Frank Gainer. Gainer ran under the Coalition banner as he was jointly nominated by the Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives. Leavitt would try and run for a seat to the House of Commons of Canada in the electoral district of Calgary North as a candidate for federal Social Credit in the 1958 federal election. He finished a very distant second place to incumbent Douglas Harkness. Leavitt would run again provincially for Social Credit in the 1963 Alberta general election in the electoral district of Calgary Queens Park. He won the district with just under half the popular vote defeating five candidates including future MLA Roy Farran. He stood for his third term in office in the 1967 Alberta general election. His margin of victory dropped as he only took 42% of the vote. He defeated future MLA Eric Musgreave and two other candidates. Leavitt retired from provincial politics at dissolution of the assembly in 1971.

E. M. Anscombe. G. E. M. Anscombe Anscombe wrote that a human action is intentional if the question \\"Why?\\", taken in a certain sense (and evidently conceived as addressed to him), has application (Intention, par. 5-8). An agent can answer the \\"Why?\\" question by giving a reason or purpose for her action. \\"To do Y\\" or \\"because I want to do Y\\" would be typical answers to this sort of \\"Why?\\"; though they are not the only ones, they are crucial to the constitution of the phenomenon as a typical phenomenon of human life (sections 18-21). The agent's answer helps supply the descriptions under which the action is intentional. Moreover, the act is known without observation (Intention, section. 28). For example, a person knows without observation that their hands are pushing upwards and when asked what they are doing, they say they are opening the window. Hence, in their hands pushing upwards, they are opening the window; opening a window being a description of the intentional act. Anscombe was the first to clearly spell out that actions are intentional under some descriptions and not others. In her famous example, a man's action (which we might observe as consisting in moving an arm up and down while holding a handle) may be intentional under the description \\"pumping water\\" but not under other descriptions such as \\"contracting these muscles\\", \\"tapping out this rhythm\\", etc. Ian Hacking The implications of this philosophy of intentional action were extended by Ian Hacking. His argument is as follows: people talk about themselves as intentional beings. Descriptions of acts are almost always descriptions of how an act was intended. A person offers an explanation of why he or she acts thus and so. The array of descriptions available to an individual depend on the descriptions available to the society in which the individual resides. Hence, the media, the expertise of psychologists, physicians and scientists as well as the folk understandings of cultural communities all provide descriptions; descriptions that can be assumed by an individual as he or she acts. Acting under a description has important implications for interpreting our selves. Self-understanding involves understanding our acts and hence understanding the descriptions under which we act. This issue has been illustrated with discussions of particular cases such as autism and multiple personality disorder. In contemporary society, the descriptions under which people act constitute the kind of act and the kind of person that commits the act. By illustration, a child pushes another child in the playground. If asked why he did that, he might answer \\"to show who's boss\\", \\"because I have ADHD\\", or \\"because I was provoked\\". Hacking is not concerned with which description best suits the act, but rather, how the descriptions under which people act depend on the descriptions available to them. According to Hacking, selves are formed not only by humans' bio-physical constitution and the events we experience, but also by the descriptions we ascribe to the events that occur and the events we engage in. These descriptions are often causal descriptions: explanations of how we have come to be the persons that we are. A person does not come to be the person that she is simply because the events of her past caused her to be this person. Rather, the descriptions attributed to events in the past are a formative influence on her being. These explanations are replete with meaning and causal attribution. People are substantially (though not entirely) the people they understand themselves to be. Acting under a description also has important implications for our interpretation of different societies and different eras. Hacking argues that descriptions change as the shared understandings of particular acts change. Hacking provides the following example. 17th-century courtiers tickled the genitalia of Louis XIII. Were they guilty of child abuse? The description of child abuse available in the 21st century did not exist in the 17th century. \\"In short, the charge of child abuse may be true of the past, but it was not true in the past. The description only becomes true with time. For Hacking, retroactive descriptions are, at the very least, controversial.\\" The past is indeterminate, not because acts simply may or may not have happened, but because the ascribed causes of those acts form an ever-shifting account depending on the ebb and flow of descriptions readily ascribed to those acts as the practices of society change.

He later was a soldier who was twice awarded for gallantry in the First World War but died in the Battle of the Somme in March 1918. Football career Bell was born in Gibraltar, the son of Maj. E. I. Bell (Royal Fusiliers), and Minnie Bell and given the middle name \\"Inkerman\\", presumably a reference to his father's military service. His father was later stationed at Aldershot and Bell played his early football for South Farnborough. After a short period with Crystal Palace as an amateur in February 1907, when he made a small number of appearances in the reserve team in the London and Western League, and a trial with Portsmouth, Bell was signed by Southampton of the Southern League in March 1907. He went straight into the team, making two appearances at outside- right in April as a replacement for triallist J. Patten; both matches, against Queens Park Rangers and Fulham, ended in 3–0 defeats. Bell made two more appearances in the 1907–08 season, as a replacement for John Bainbridge and was released at the end of the season. Later career Bell returned to South Farnborough and was re-instated as an amateur, working as a Government Contracts Inspector. He has been confused with E.J. Bell who made four first- team appearances for Portsmouth at the start of the 1910–11 season, having previously played for Exeter City. Military career During the First World War, he joined the 17th Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment (the \\"Footballers' Battalion\\"), achieving the rank of captain. In July 1916, his commanding officer, Major Frank Buckley (later to become manager of several football clubs, including Blackpool, Wolves and Leeds United) was wounded at Delville Wood, and Bell assumed command of the battalion. In October 1916, he was awarded the Military Cross for his actions during the battle. The citation states: > Finding himself in command of the battalion he repelled a counter-attack > with great determination. On another occasion he rescued several men from a > blown-in dugout. Following the disbanding of the battalion in February 1918, Bell was attached to the 99th Infantry Brigade. He was killed on 24 March 1918 in the Battle of the Somme and buried at the Albert Communal Cemetery. In July 1918, he received a posthumous \\"bar\\" to his Military Cross for conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. The citation reads: > While holding a section of the front line he located and supervised the > formation of forward dumps of ammunition and material. He carried out the > work in daylight close to the enemy, and often under very heavy shell and > machine-gun fire. Family He left a widow, Edith Anne Bell. Their son, born in October 1918 six months after Bell's death, was named after his father. In the Second World War, he became an acting Squadron Leader in the Royal Air Force, before being captured and imprisoned in Stalag Luft III. Awarded the DFC, he later served in the Korean War in the North Staffordshire Regiment and retired as a Major.

Its goal is to emulate the real Workbench behaviour, plus integrating additional functionality and an enhanced look.\\"Scalos – About Scalos\\" As stated on its website, the name \\"Scalos\\" was inspired by the fictional time-accelerated planet Scalos in the Star Trek episode \\"Wink of an Eye\\".  History  Scalos is a former commercial product originally written in 1999 by programmer Stefan Sommerfield for a software house called AlienDesign. The purpose was to recreate the mouse-and-click experience on Amiga, offering an alternative to the Workbench interface present in versions 3.0 and 3.1 of AmigaOS (at that time already considered obsolete). A group of English programmers known as Satanic Dreams Software (a software firm developing for Windows, Macintosh and Linux) took over. The release versions 1.1 and 1.2 (internally versions 39.2) came out in 2000 as freeware. These may be found on the Amiga Aminet official online repository. Scalos was finally open sourced in 2012. The last release candidate is version 41.8 RC1; it is compatible with AmigaOS 3 for the Motorola 68000 family of processors, with AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS on PowerPC machines, and with AROS, at the moment on computers with processors from Intel 80386 onwards. The Scalos project can be found on Sourceforge.

It features internal 64-bit arithmetic which allows support for hard disks over 64 GB, and a complete internal multitasking system (each window drawn on the desktop is represented in the system by its own task). It is completely adjustable by the user, and features a system for drawing and managing windows (as in the standard Amiga Intuition system). Each window may have its own background pattern (sporting an optimized pattern routine and scaling) and automatic content-refresh. Menus are editable. Standard Amiga \\"Palette\\" and windows \\"Pattern\\" preferences have been replaced with new ones. Scalos maintains its own API and its own plug-in system for the benefit of developers who want to create software for Scalos and enhance the system. Scalos supports as standard icon sets the Amiga NewIcons replacement icons, and the Amiga GlowIcons set on older versions like AmigaOS 3.5, including thumbnail previews of files as icons. It therefore represents a whole Amiga icon system Datatype capable of supporting various types of icons. This includes png icons with alpha channel and transparencies, and scalable icons (the aforementioned NewIcons and GlowIcons). Italian programmer Elena Novaretti, author of ZoneXPlorer fractal software, stated in the article she donated source code for loading and viewing 32-bit PowerIcons based on PNG files to the developers of the Scalos desktop environment.

He co-leads a trio with Italian pianist Stefano Bollani and Danish bassist Jesper Bodilsen, and he is a member of Paolo Fresu's Devil Quartet and Kind of Porgy and Bess ensembles. As a sideman he has participated on more than 60 albums. Biography Lund was born into a musical family in Viborg, Denmark, in 1972 to a father who played drums, trumpet, and guitar and was active part of the city's jazz scene, and a mother who played flute. At age 6, he started to play drums. He got his first paid jobs at age 15. In 1993 he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music in Aarhus and only a year later, still a student, he started to play in the internationally recognized Klüvers Big Band. With this band that he recorded his first album. After receiving his diploma in 1997, he moved to Copenhagen and was soon involved in several projects, recording and going on tours. Jesper Bodilsen, with whom he had studied at the Academy, has been a close collaborator on many projects. In 2002 Lund and Bodilsen were among the musicians selected for the Jazzpar Sextet which Enrico Rava formed, as was virtuoso Italian pianist Stefano Bollani. Because the chemistry was good among them, they formed a trio the following year. Their first album, Mi ritorni in mente, was released the same year to critical acclaim and became one of the ten best selling records in Italy that year. After tours in Italy and Scandinavia it was clear that the collaboration was going to be of a more lasting nature. They went on to play in jazz clubs and at festivals around the world. Their debut in New York City was at the legendary Birdland Club. In 2006 the trio released their second album, Gleda, which is centred on Scandinavian songs.

The Agency was created in April 1978 with the proclamation of the Northern Pipeline Act to oversee the planning and construction of the Canadian section of the Alaska Highway Gas Pipeline Project by the Foothills Group of Companies, now owned by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. (TCPL). Its mandate is stated as follows: \\"The Agency's mandate is twofold. First, it carries out Government of Canada responsibilities in relation to the pipeline and facilitates the efficient and expeditious planning and construction of the pipeline, taking into account local and regional interests, in particular those of native people. Secondly, it maximizes the social and economic benefits from the construction and operation of the pipeline while at the same time minimizing any adverse effect on the social and environmental conditions of the areas most directly affected by the pipeline. Further, The NPA acts as a single window between federal authorities and the Foothills Group of Companies, and between provincial and territorial governments, and the Government of the United States. In keeping with the Act, many regulatory powers of other Government of Canada departments and agencies related to the pipeline project are delegated to the NPA. This is not the case for those powers reserved exclusively to the National Energy Board or shared between the Board and the NPA.\\"'' The Agency oversaw the construction of the Prebuild from Caroline, Alberta to San Francisco and Chicago in the West and East respectively in the early 1980s but unfavourable economic conditions led to the suspension of Stage II (construction from the Alaska border near Beaver Creek, YT to the Alberta border near Boundary Lake, B.C.) as well as a corresponding reduction in resources and a prolonged period of inactivity. The Agency currently has a relatively small office, including the head Commissioner, the Deputy Minister of Natural Resources Canada Serge P. Dupont, who reports to Parliament through the Minister of Natural Resources, the Honourable Christian Paradis. The Agency Office develops and consults on major policy issues between the United States, the provinces, and the Government of Canada departments and agencies, concerned. An Assistant Commissioner was hired on a full-time basis in 2009, and several more staff have been hired since. The Act also provides for the appointment of an Administrator and Designated Officer within the National Energy Board (NEB), whose responsibilities are those relegated from the Commissioner.

Hacking's work is both a theoretical account of the concepts and modes of agentic engagement through which people encounter the world and make sense of themselves, and a psychological account of how minds relate to memories and the fragility of this relationship, especially in the lives of people exposed to extremes of suffering and cruelty. Through a study of the history and manifestations of multiple personality disorder, Hacking describes how people come to an understanding of their lives through their own memories and autobiographies. Hacking describes the shifting shared meanings that shape our memories and become the threads with which people weave their biographies.  Argument  To develop his argument, Hacking offers an account of how those engaged with MPD have inquired into its reality over historical time and describes the concepts and practices that developed through those inquiries. In the past three decades of the twentieth century, therapy tended to take an individual with an amorphous and confused array of painful experiences and parse them into autonomous personality fragments, each dissociated (to varying degrees) from the other fragments and each with its own memories and descriptions of past experiences. The outcome of therapy for multiple personality disorder is a person that does not know herself: a person with a fragmented soul. “It is contrary to what the philosophers call freedom. It is contrary to our best vision of what it is to be a human” (p. 267). Hacking offers the reader some possible modes of questioning and critiquing the understandings of personality, memory and the Disorder that have emerged within a historical context and, on occasions, he offers his own understanding of how these concepts have emerged and their implications to contemporary understandings of psychology. Hacking does not question whether multiple personality disorder is real. Rather, he offers a strategy for questioning reality: Is the multiple personality disorder a real what? One might say, for example, that multiple personality disorder is a real mode of engaging with the world and a real way of understanding the past. In Rewriting the Soul, Hacking seeks to examine why Western society takes it for granted that “memory is the key to the soul” (p. 20) and why multiple personality disorder became so closely associated with traumatic memories.  History of multiple personality disorder  The first known case of an individual with conduct that would today be considered multiple personality disorder was recorded in the late 18th century (Hacking, 1995). In 1972, there were ten known cases over the previous fifty years despite a widespread interest in psychotherapy over that period. By 1986, it was believed that six thousand cases had been diagnosed. As cases of multiple personality began to emerge in the 1970s, they attracted the interest not only of therapists and the psychiatric profession, but also of the media. Awareness and discussion of multiple personality disorder became widespread. multiple personality disorder became a kind of mental illness. It became a kind of thing that someone could have. This is what Hacking refers to as “semantic contagion” (p. 238). Before its meaning became prevalent in society, one could not describe oneself as a person of that kind. There were confused individuals who were (either deliberately or pre-reflectively) seeking to dissociate themselves from memories of painful events. These people, however, could not have described themselves as having the Disorder, nor could people in psychology diagnose their patients with this term. Once MPD became a kind of thing, it became a way for individuals to understand themselves and understand people around them. Other meanings associated with MPD arose contemporaneously in the 1970s and 1980s. Child abuse was not a meaning shared and understood in Western societies before the 1970s. “Cruelty to children” and “baby battering” were perhaps the precursors of this term, although the meaning implied by these terms was mostly restricted to physical violence. With “child abuse,” the sexual use of children was not only incorporated into our understanding of the ill treatment of children, but became the most probable form. It needs to be stressed that Hacking (1995) does not suggest child abuse only began to occur when the term had been coined. Nevertheless, it may have increased the prevalence of child abuse. Some men may discover child rape for themselves, some may have learned it from their own childhood experiences and some (perhaps many) may sexually abuse children because the idea of such conduct was imbued through semantic contagion. Hacking is also careful to note that the use of children for sexual purposes is a cause of suffering to children whether or not the term “child abuse” is in common usage. One can imagine, for example, that an eleven-year- old boy in ancient Greece coerced into sex by his mentor would suffer pain and mental anguish. Genital mutilation is also painful and most possibly quite horrifying to those who have this practice inflicted on them. The key aspect of semantic contagion is not that it makes events and behaviors possible that were once impossible. Semantic contagion, by creating new ways of being a person and new descriptions for the way people act, contributes to our explanations as to why the act occurred and what the consequences will be. It seems that the description of the act can shape the consequences of the act.  Acting under a description  The philosopher G. E. M. Anscombe wrote that a human action is intentional if the question 'Why,' taken in a certain sense (and evidently conceived as addressed to him), has application (Intention, par. 5-8). An agent can answer the 'why' question by giving a reason or purpose for her action. \\"To do Y\\" or \\"because I want to do Y\\" would be typical answers to this sort of \\"why?\\"; though they are not the only ones, they are crucial to the constitution of the phenomenon as a typical phenomenon of human life (sections 18-21). The agent's answer helps supply the descriptions under which the action is intentional. Anscombe was the first to clearly spell out that actions are intentional under some descriptions and not others. In her famous example, a man's action (which we might observe as consisting in moving an arm up and down while holding a handle) may be intentional under the description 'pumping water' but not under other descriptions such as 'contracting these muscles', 'tapping out this rhythm', and so on. Intentional actions are actions under a description. The implications of this philosophy of intentional action were extended by Hacking in Rewriting the Soul. His argument is as follows: When we talk about people, we talk about ourselves as intentional beings. Our description of our acts are almost always descriptions of how an act was intended. We offer an explanation of why we act thus and so. The array of descriptions available to an individual depend on the descriptions available to the society in which the individual resides. Hence, the media, the expertise of psychologists, physicians and scientists and the folk understandings of cultural communities all provide descriptions that can be assumed by an individual in the moment that he or she acts. For example, a child pushes another child in the playground. If asked why did you do that, he might answer \\"to show who's boss,\\" \\"because I have ADHD\\" or \\"because I was provoked.\\" Hacking is not concerned with which description is true, but rather, how the descriptions under which people act depend on the descriptions available to them. “Action is action under a description”. Moreover, descriptions change as our shared understanding of the meaning of the act changes. For example, if one sees a man spanking a child, or children playing “kiss chase” in the playground, the descriptions ascribed to the acts would most likely differ considerably to those of a Victorian gentleman. The contemporary acts of eating beef, reading philosophy and natural procreation may all have very different descriptions to a person in a future society: descriptions that assume different causes and different outcomes to those that we assume today. The past is indeterminate, not because acts simply may or may not have happened, but because the ascribed causes of those acts is an ever- shifting account depending on the ebb and flow of descriptions that can be ascribed to those acts as the practices of society change. Acting under a description has important implications for our interpretation of different societies and different eras. Acting under a description also has important implications for interpreting our selves. According to Hacking, selves are formed not only by our bio-physical constitution and the events we experience, but also by the descriptions we ascribe to the events that occur. These descriptions are often causal descriptions: explanations of how we have come to be the persons that we are. A person does not come to be the person that she is simply because the events of her past caused her to be this person. Rather, the descriptions attributed to events in the past are a formative influence on her being. These explanations are replete with meaning and causal attribution. We are substantially (though not entirely) the people we understand ourselves to be. Hacking’s (1995) account of the emergence of multiple personality disorder is not simply an account of the events that led to the discovery of this disorder and a description of its manifestations. It is an investigation into the extent to which our descriptions of events – descriptions that often entail causal implications – have rippled through our societies and how these descriptions form new ways of being a person. The description itself, then, offers causal possibilities.

By combining physics of structures with meteorology, properties of the building, weather conditions including outdoor temperature, wind power and direction, as well as solar radiation can be taken into account. In the case of conventional heating control, only current outdoor temperature is considered. The starting point for developing the method of eGain forecasting was the ENLOSS mathematical energy balance model developed by Prof. Roger Taesler Taesler, R. (1990/91) \\"Climate and Building Energy Management\\".

Forecasting method began to be introduced to use in the late 1980s. Until 2017 inclusive, forecasting method has been introduced in nearly 16 million square metres of floorage of residential buildings and commercial premises. Estimated data indicate 10 - 15 kWh/m2 reduction of average annual heat energy consumption. Since forecasting method contains information about future demand and is not in conflict with other methods of increasing energy efficiency, it is always a good foreground solution. eGain Forecasting in practice As far as practical use of forecasting method is concerned, usually remote control forecasting receivers are used to send and receive data by means of GPRS or GSM network. Then, the forecasting receivers manage the operation of control panels installed in buildings which adjust distribution of heat energy in the heating system of a given property. Recently, special remote control weather loggers have started to be used in combination with forecasting receivers. The weather loggers measure air temperature and humidity with high accuracy and the measurements are sent in real time to forecasting receivers to which they are connected. Such a turning point in technology means even more detailed preview of situation and better possibilities of control for users of forecasting method. NotesReferences *Taesler, R.

It acts as a second aerial twice the height of the cliff below the first. Sea interferometers are drift instruments, that is, they are fixed and their pointing direction changes with the rotation of the Earth. The interference patterns for a sea interferometer commence sharply as soon as the source rises above the horizon, instead of fading in gradually as for a normal interferometer. Since it consists of just one detector, there is no need for connecting cables or for preamplifiers. A sea interferometer also has double the sensitivity of a pair of detectors set up to the same separation. Sea interferometry greatly increases the resolving power of the instrument. Data quality The quality of data obtained by a sea interferometer is affected by a number of factors. Waves on the water surface and variable refraction adversely affect the signal, and the curvature of the Earth's surface must be taken into account. These difficulties can be overcome by observing for extended periods, and calibrating the instrument on sources of known position. Discoveries Among the discoveries made using sea interferometry are that sunspots emit strong radio waves and that the source of radio wave emission from Cygnus A is small (less than 8 arcminutes in diameter). The technique also discovered six new sources including Centaurus A.

The meaning of unresolved grief is any aspect of grieving that has yet to be resolved. In cases of delayed grief, the reaction to the loss is postponed until a later time, even years later, and might be triggered by a seemingly unrelated event, such as a recent divorce Grief Counselling and Grief Therapy: A Handbook, James William Worden, 2003, p.46, link: Books- Google-MC. or even the death of a pet, but with reactions excessive to the current situation. The delayed grief might manifest as any of the reactions in normal grief: pangs of intense yearning, spasms of distress, short bouts of hysterical laughter, tearful or uncontrolled sobbing, feeling of hopelessness, restlessness, insomnia, preoccupation with thoughts about the loved one, extreme and unexplained anger, or general feelings of depression. In extreme cases reaction may invoke suicidal tendencies. The term \\"delayed grief\\" is also used to describe a pattern in which symptoms of distress, seeking, yearning (etc.), are occurring at a much later time period than is typical. \\"Bereavement, Mourning, and Grief\\", U.S. National Cancer Institute, web: [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/supportivecare/bereavement/HealthProfessional/page4 Cancer-gov-HP-4].

After the Gestapo felt they had enough information from their investigations, they arrested Hatschek on September 3, 1943, subjecting him to intensive interrogation on that same day. Two days later, the Gestapo arrested every single person Hatschek had named. By the end, they had over 40 members of the EU; the number of forced laborers arrested, but not brought before a court, is unknown. The Jews hidden by the EU were sent to Auschwitz, where about half of them were killed. There were more than 12 trials before the People's Court. Of those, 15 were sentenced to death and 13 were executed. Two died while being interrogated.

Originating at CBS/MTM Studio Center in Studio City, California, the series was similar to American Gladiators but with a medieval theme. The series matched a cast of amateur athletes against each other, as well as against the group of \\"Warriors\\". The show was hosted by Joe Fowler and Lisa Canning. The Setting Bernard Erhard portrayed the Lord of Rules and Discipline (L.O.R.D.) who also acted as the show's resident referee. In the first season's original opening scene, he narrates the story as follows: It is written in the Book of Good and Evil that in a time long ago, all was peace and harmony, Paradise on Earth. Then one fateful day, the universe shifted, all was dark, and for those born on that day, their evil destiny was sealed! Now, they have united to wreak havoc on an unsuspecting world --- and forevermore will be known as WARRIORS!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRtv99NwuYA This opening title sequence loosely resembles the legend of King Arthur and recalls how the world was a utopia until the day a dark force disrupted the balance that separated good from evil; and how, with that dark force, a barbarian horde known as the Warriors began to storm through the kingdoms. The L.O.R.D. has accordingly called for \\"modern-day knights\\" to battle the Warriors and restore honor. The \\"knights\\" are two teams of one man and one woman. The teams are colored purple and gold. The knights must go through eight challenges set forth by the Warriors to win the game. The L.O.R.D. hands out punishment to the Warriors for any cheating, but he can also punish the knights if they cheat during competition, which was very rare in this show's all-too-short history. The audience all wave and purple and gold triangular flags while cheering on the knights. The Warriors The Warriors are the show's antagonists. In reality, they're hired actors almost similar to the Gladiators. *PLAGUE: The leader of the Warriors and considerably the strongest. Portrayed by Jim Maniaci. *STEEL MAIDEN: A female Warrior, beautiful and powerful. Portrayed by Nancy Georges. *PYRO: The Warriors' hotheaded firestarter, some say the most popular of the Warriors.

Unknown performer. The Challenges The start and end of each event are marked by the sound of a gong and trumpet fanfare to begin the event, and only a gong sound to end the event. Catapult The knights must catch red dodgeballs being launched by a catapult while trying to evade yellow dodgeballs being fired by the Warriors using giant slingshots. Once the red balls are caught, the knights must throw them into the ring of fire to score. Points are scored based on which section of the playing mat the knight threw the red ball from. In Season 1, the mat was divided into three sections worth 5, 10 and 15 points, with 15 being the furthest away. In Season 2, only the front two sections of the mat were used, with the middle section scoring 25 points, and the front section scoring 50 (as the knight would have to brave harder hits from the dodgeballs). After 60 seconds, the challenge is over. Both the male and female knights took a turn competing in this event. Pyro was always the Warrior whose tricks would ignite the ring of fire to start the match. Battle Swords The knight and Warrior run across treadmills on an elevated platform trying to knock each other down with foam bats. The challenge is 30 seconds. A win or a Warrior disqualification earns the knight 50 points while a draw is worth 25 points. Grabbing an opponent's weapon or crossing over the small barrier between the treadmills automatically disqualifies the offender. Only one gender competes in this event. Sorcerer's Wheel The knight has 45 seconds to run across a spinning track with two hurdles. Every completed lap on the wheel is worth 10 points each. However, a lap doesn't count if both of the knight's feet touch the inside of the wheel. The Warriors stand on the outside of the wheel swinging a 75-pound spiked ball on a chain to knock the knight off the wheel and out of the game. Whichever gender did not participate in Battle Swords competes in this event. Volcano Two knights have 45 seconds (60 for the women) to climb up a giant 30-foot volcano-shaped net. Inside the net are 4 Warriors. One Warrior is strapped to a harness while the other three Warriors control the height and angle. The harnessed Warrior has pads to knock the knight down trying to prevent them from scoring. Scoring ranges from 3 sections of the net, each separated by a metal ring connected to the net. The bottom of the net is worth 25 points while the next section is worth 50 points and the top section is 75 points. If the knight manages to climb to the top of the Volcano and grab their team flag, he(she) will earn 100 points. Both genders compete in this event. Roller Joust Each knight has 45 seconds to skate around the perimeter of the jousting arena carrying a foam lance to capture rings on poles scattered around the arena. Red rings are worth 10 points while gold rings are worth 25. Inside the circle are four paths forming an X. For the first 15 seconds the X is a \\"Warrior-free zone\\"; the Warriors cannot enter or interfere. After the 15 seconds have elapsed, the Warriors are free to enter that zone as well. One gender competed in this event in Season 1, and both genders each took a turn in Season 2. Tug O' Warriors The knight and the Warrior are each standing on rotating platforms while each of them pulls on a rope. The knight has 30 seconds to pull the Warrior of their platform. If the knight wins, he or she earns 100 points. If 30 seconds expires or both go over, 50 points are awarded for a draw. Only one gender competes in this event. (In Season 1, the gender that did not participate in Roller Joust competed.) The Pit In this challenge, the knights are pitted against each other inside a bowl-like arena. The Warriors outside the bowl rock it back and forth with the knights inside it. The object in this game is for one knight to pin the other using a pad. Depending on where the pin was, the bowl has 4 scoring sections: two 25 points, one 50 point and one 75 point section. After 45 seconds, the total number of points are added up. Pins without using the pads won't count. Both genders took a turn competing in this event. A notable moment in the show's early round one episodes occurred when Knight Robert Pavell of the purple suffered a head injury while inside the Pit; he and his opponent, Michael West of the gold team, scored no points in the Pit. He was replaced by Jeff Joccum, who later went on to score in the finale and ensure a win of the purple team. Target Onslaught Similar to the American Gladiators final event, the Eliminator, Target Onslaught is the show's final event. Target Onslaught is a two-part challenge. One knight becomes the shooter, aiming a crossbow-like cannon and firing foam arrows at six targets from afar as the other knight loads the crossbow. The targets include a dragon, spinning flags, the Sun, the Moon, and two shields. The first knight has 30 seconds to shoot the targets. The first knight cannot move to the next target until the last one is shot down. Instead of points, the knight earns 5 additional seconds for his/her partner for every successful hit. After 30 seconds expires, the second half of Target Onslaught begins. The second knight now becomes the shooter and the first knight loads the crossbow as they attempt to shoot the Warriors which travel back and forth across the top of the arena on three rails using handrail slides. The closest rail is 50 points, the next rail is 100 points and the furthest rail is 150 points. After 30–60 seconds, the final scores are totaled. The Final Results The team with the most points at the end of the show wins and receive medals awarded to them by the L.O.R.D. and the servant girls beside him. Prizes are also awarded to the knights, indicated by hostess Lisa Canning as the show comes back from various commercial breaks. In a \\"Knights and Warriors Tournament\\", which was ultimately the series finale, the champions of the Tournament are crowned \\"Sir\\" and \\"Madam\\" by the Lord of Rules and Discipline, and receive gold trophies awarded by the show.

In August 2011, he was appointed senior fellow at the Fung Global Institute (FGI), a think-tank producing innovative thinking and research on global issues from Asian perspectives. Biography Lehmann was born in Washington, D.C. on 29 August 1945. He spent most of his childhood and adolescence between Japan and Europe. In 1966 he obtained his bachelor's degree from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service and subsequently he did his doctorate at Oxford University (St Antony's College), where he was from 1967 to 1970. Lehmann's areas of special interest include globalisation, global governance, trade and development, the role of business in reduction of poverty and inequality and the socio-economic, cultural, and business dynamics of Asia. He acts in various leading capacities in a number of public policy institutes and organisations, as an adviser to governments and corporations, and as a frequent commentator in the international media. He is the author of several books and numerous articles and papers primarily dealing with globalisation, modern East Asian history and East Asia and the international political economy. In 1995, Lehmann launched The Evian Group, an international coalition of corporate, government, and opinion leaders, united by a common vision of enhancing global prosperity for the benefit of all by fostering an open, inclusive and equitable global market economy in a rules- based multilateral framework. The Evian Group, based at IMD in Lausanne (Switzerland), has developed as a leading global voice on global trade and investment issues that acts as a forum for dialogue and a birthplace of ideas; it also engages actively in advocacy to counter the forces of protectionism and chauvinism. Lehmann works closely with a number of international forums and think tanks, including the World Economic Forum where he is a member of two of its GACs (Global Agenda Councils), on Trade and on the Future of China. Prior to joining IMD, Lehmann's journalist, academic and business careers encompassed activities in virtually all Asian and Western European countries, as well as North America. He was founding director of the European Institute of Japanese Studies (EIJS) at the Stockholm School of Economics (from 1992) and Professor of East Asian Political Economy and Business. He established and directed the East Asian operations of InterMatrix, a London-based business strategy research and consulting organization (1986–1992). During this time he was concurrently Affiliated Professor of International Business at the London Business School. Previously, Lehmann was associate professor of International Business at INSEAD, visiting professor at the Bologna Center (Italy) of the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, twice visiting professor and Japan Foundation Fellow at the University of Tohoku (Japan), also visiting professor for MBA courses at the University of Hong Kong, and founding director of the Center for Japanese Studies at the University of Stirling (Scotland), where he also taught East Asian history. He also directed the EC-ASEAN 'Transfer of Technology and Socio-Economic Development Programs' (1981–1986). He died in Lausanne on 21 December 2017. Teaching and presentations Lehmann teaches both a core course and various electives in the IMD MBA program. He has been involved in annual MBA student project research field trips to Argentina, Bangladesh, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kenya and South Africa. Professor Lehmann teaches in a number of IMD executive education programs, including OWP (Orchestrating Winning Performance), LGE (Leading the Global Enterprise) and EMBA (Executive Master of Business Administration). He is a frequent contributor to IMD's Corporate Learning Network (CLN) and will release a series of global leaders’ podcasts in early 2011. Publications Lehmann frequently writes articles on key issues of the day in journals and online publications. This includes numerous and diverse contributions to the IMD Tomorrow's Challenges series. He writes a monthly column for the Chinese language magazine China Entrepreneur (CEC). Many of his publications also appear in YaleGlobal Online, The Globalist and Project Syndicate. Reflecting his PhD (D.Phil) at Oxford's St Antony's College on Japanese economic history in the late Edo and earl Meiji eras (1850s to 1880s), Lehmann has maintained his interest in Japan about which he has written several books, the most recent, in March 2009, was co-authored with John Haffner and Tomas Casas i Klett and is entitled Japan’s Open Future: An Agenda for Global Citizenship. He has edited with his son, Fabrice Lehmann, a work commissioned by the ICC (International Chamber of Commerce) Research Foundation, entitled World Peace and Prosperity Through World Trade – Achieving the 1919 Vision published by Cambridge University Press in October 2010. The book is composed of individual short op-ed style chapters from 58 contributors from 26 different countries and from diverse professions and disciplines.

Geography Büsbach, located on a knoll of limestone, is surrounded by several villages. In the north Münsterbusch is directly neighboured to Büsbach while Breinig and Dorff in southern direction are separated by pasture. Stolbergs district Oberstolberg as well as its industrial estate with companies like Prym or Chemie Grünenthal can be found in the east. In the southeast of Büsbach the natural reserves Bärenstein and Brockenberg, former mining areas, offer biotopes for rare flowers, insects and amphibians while the natural reserve Tatternsteine mit Talaue is famous for its geology.  History  Early traces of human activity were discovered in the southeast of Büsbach where implements dated approximately 10.000 B.C. (Mesolithic) had been excavated. Artifacts found by historians in the west of Büsbach could be dated between 5000 and 1900 B.C.. The Ancient Romans, supported by a small Roman road connecting Kornelimünster and Jülich, started mining in the southeast of Büsbach as traces of settlements from the first to third century proved. Pottery dated 900 AD had been found near the Flachsbach, a small rivulet flowing through the south of the village. It verified human activity in this area. Between 1794 and 1815 Büsbach belonged to the town of Eschweiler. In 1816 it became part of the Prussian empire and was governed by the city of Aachen. The situation changed again in 1913 when parts of Büsbach (Schneidmühle and Jordansberg) had been administered by the mayor of Stolberg. Since 1935 Büsbach is a district of Stolberg.  Main sights  The church of Büsbach, St. Hubertus, is a well-known landmark. Built in 1894 it was called the dome of the Eifel due to its characteristic church spire. After the spire became dilapidated it had to be demolished. The old administration building which had also been used as a school building was built at the end of the 19th century. It is located at the marketplace and used as a community building. The memorial Bareschesser reminds the inhabitants of Büsbach of an event leading to the nickname Bareschesser for the people living in this village.

Second World War Sweetman enlisted in the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) in April 1940 and, after flight training, left New Zealand for Europe as a sergeant pilot later in the year. After service with both No. 234 and No. 485 (NZ) Squadrons, he joined No. 486 (NZ) Squadron as 'B' Flight commander in March 1942. At its establishment, No. 486 Squadron was equipped with the Hawker Hurricane MkIIB, operating as a night fighter unit from Wittering. On 23/24 July, Sweetman scored the squadron's first aerial victory of the war, a Do217, which was shared with a Royal Canadian Air Force Beaufighter. Shortly after 30 July 1942, No. 486 Squadron began re-equipping with the newly introduced Hawker Typhoon. In May 1943, Sweetman was the second No. 486 Squadron pilot to be awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (after Frank Murphy a week earlier). Still commanding 'B' Flight at this point, Sweetman's tally of victories stood at two aircraft destroyed and a further two shared. In July 1943 Sweetman left No. 486 to take up production testing for Hawker, returning to the squadron for a second tour to command 'A' Flight in February 1944. By this time the unit had converted to the Hawker Tempest Mk V. and from the middle of 1944 Sweetman and No. 486 Squadron became heavily involved in the campaign to protect London and southeast England from the V1 flying bomb offensive. Sweetman became a V1 ace by claiming 11 (and 1 shared) V1 flying bombs during this period. Following the loss of Squadron Leader Wigglesworth, Sweetman was given command of No. 3 Squadron in September 1944. He finished the war with a second period with Hawker as a test pilot.

He played for Athletic Bilbao for twelve years, appearing in 297 competitive matches (61 goals scored) and winning two Copa del Rey trophies. Playing career=Club Born in Sondika, Biscay, Aguirre joined Athletic Bilbao in 1957 at the age of 18 from Basque neighbours CD Getxo, being immediately promoted to the first team. He made his La Liga debut on 19 January 1958 in a 1–2 away loss against Real Zaragoza, and finished his first season with only three matches played; the campaign ended with Copa del Generalísimo conquest. In the following years, Aguirre was a regular starter for Athletic, scoring a career-best 11 goals in 29 games in 1961–62 to help the side finish in fifth position. On 10 October 1965 he put four past RCD Español in a 4–3 away win in 11 minutes, as the opposition's goalkeeper was former teammate and good friend Carmelo Cedrún; towards the end of his spell with the Lions, when he was again only a fringe player, he won his second domestic cup, against Elche CF. In the summer of 1969, aged 30, Aguirre transferred to fellow league club CE Sabadell FC, retiring halfway through the season after only 115 minutes of action in order support his family in the wake of the death of his younger brother Iñaki (a goalkeeper with AD Plus Ultra) from leukaemia. He still played some amateur football with Alicante CF, and later worked with Athletic Bilbao as an ambassador with the supporters. International Aguirre earned seven caps for Spain, during four years. His debut was on 19 April 1961, in a 2–1 away win against Wales for the 1962 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Coaching career Aguirre began his coaching career in the lower divisions. He returned to his main club Athletic Bilbao as an assistant manager, after having been in charge of the reserves and also of neighbouring Deportivo Alavés; he was promoted to head coach for 1976–77 and, during his three-year spell, the team finished twice in third position, reaching the finals of the Spanish Cup and the UEFA Cup in 1977. Aguirre then worked three seasons with Hércules CF – also in the top flight – being relegated in his last year, 1981–82. In the following campaign he was one of three managers at Valencia CF, being in charge for the final seven games (three wins, two draws and two losses) as they ranked in 15th, the first position above the relegation zone; crucially, they defeated leaders Real Madrid on the final matchday, which meant not only that they stayed up but also that Athletic won the title, his former club having reciprocated the favour to Valencia by beating UD Las Palmas who finished 16th and went down. After another brief spell in the top division, with RCD Mallorca, Aguirre returned to the lower leagues, and again managed Bilbao Athletic amongst other sides. Death Aguirre died in Bilbao on 3 July 2019, at the age of 80.

In numerical optimization, meta-optimization is the use of one optimization method to tune another optimization method. Meta- optimization is reported to have been used as early as in the late 1970s by Mercer and Sampson for finding optimal parameter settings of a genetic algorithm. Meta-optimization and related concepts are also known in the literature as meta-evolution, super-optimization, automated parameter calibration, hyper-heuristics, etc.  Motivation  Performance landscape for differential evolution. Optimization methods such as genetic algorithm and differential evolution have several parameters that govern their behaviour and efficiency in optimizing a given problem and these parameters must be chosen by the practitioner to achieve satisfactory results. Selecting the behavioural parameters by hand is a laborious task that is susceptible to human misconceptions of what makes the optimizer perform well. The behavioural parameters of an optimizer can be varied and the optimization performance plotted as a landscape. This is computationally feasible for optimizers with few behavioural parameters and optimization problems that are fast to compute, but when the number of behavioural parameters increases the time usage for computing such a performance landscape increases exponentially. This is the curse of dimensionality for the search-space consisting of an optimizer's behavioural parameters. An efficient method is therefore needed to search the space of behavioural parameters.  Methods  Meta-optimization of differential evolution. A simple way of finding good behavioural parameters for an optimizer is to employ another overlaying optimizer, called the meta- optimizer. There are different ways of doing this depending on whether the behavioural parameters to be tuned are real-valued or discrete-valued, and depending on what performance measure is being used, etc. Meta-optimizing the parameters of a genetic algorithm was done by Grefenstette and Keane, amongst others, and experiments with meta-optimizing both the parameters and the genetic operators were reported by Bäck. Meta-optimization of the COMPLEX-RF algorithm was done by Krus and Andersson, and, where performance index of optimization based on information theory was introduced and further developed. Meta-optimization of particle swarm optimization was done by Meissner et al., Pedersen and Chipperfield, and Mason et al. Pedersen and Chipperfield applied meta-optimization to differential evolution. Birattari et al. meta-optimized ant colony optimization. Statistical models have also been used to reveal more about the relationship between choices of behavioural parameters and optimization performance, see for example Francois and Lavergne, and Nannen and Eiben. A comparison of various meta-optimization techniques was done by Smit and Eiben.

It has smooth bark on its trunk and branches, lance-shaped leaves, and buds in groups of between seven and fifteen or more. The flowers are white and the fruit are woody hemispherical capsules. It is common on the coastal areas and tablelands of New South Wales and adjacent areas in south eastern Queensland, occurring as far south as Bega.Bark and leavesbudsfruit Description Eucalyptus amplifolia is a tree that can grow to in height in forest situations, though it is often shorter in sparser woodland areas. It has smooth, often blotchy, white, cream, yellow, grey, pink or blue-grey bark throughout the trunk and branches, usually with loose, flaking grey slabs persistent at the base and lower trunk. The leaves on young plants are rounded, egg-shaped or triangular, green, long, and predominately held horizontal to the ground. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, broadly lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. Side-veins are 45° or greater to the midrib, and the leaves are of a dull or glossy green of same hue both sides of the leaf. The flowers are arranged in groups of seven to fifteen or more, the groups on a flattened or angular peduncle long, the individual flowers sometimes on a pedicel up to long or sessile. The buds are cone- shaped, the floral cup hemispherical long, the operculum conical, long and about wide at the join. Flowering occurs between November and January and the fruit is a woody, hemispherical capsule long and wide on a pedicel long. There are three or four upward-pointing valves on the top of the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus amplifolia was first formally described in 1891 by Charles Victor Naudin who published the description in Description and emploi des Eucalyptus: introduits en Europe principalement en France et en Algerie: second memoire. The specific epithet (amplifolia) is derived from the Latin words amplus meaning \\"large\\" and folium meaning \\"leaf\\", referring to the large leaves of this eucalypt. In 1990, Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill described two subspecies of Eucalyptus amplifolia: * Eucalyptus amplifolia subsp. amplifolia has buds and fruit with a distinct pedicel; * Eucalyptus amplifolia subsp. sessiliflora lacks a distinct pedicel. Distribution and habitat Cabbage gum grows in grassy woodland and forest, often in depressions and on river flats. * Subspecies amplifolia is found on the coastal plains of New South Wales from Taree to Batemans Bay with disjunct populations as far north as Coffs Harbour as well as in the Megalong Valley and on the Southern Tablelands near Goulburn. * Subspecies sessiliflora grows in northern New South Wales, occurring in the Tenterfield, Armidale and Casino districts and in adjacent areas in Queensland.

This phenomenon may have started when truckers began to heat their lunch from the heat of their vehicles' engines. It is a method that has been known for decades --not only by truckers, but also as a bushcraft by adventurers. The method of cooking with the heat of an engine is a viable way to prepare your meal while on an adventure trip, and is even known to be used by people during power cuts when they cannot use their kitchen appliances. The first engine cooking experiments were done by hungry truckers who came up with the idea of making a small vent hole in the lid of cans of soup, and then placing it on the hot exhaust manifold before hitting the road. When arriving at the destination, lunch was ready. This however cannot be recommended as cans used for canned food are typically coated on the inside in a layer of epoxy resin. Other communities also have embraced engine cooking, including vandwellersvandwellers.org and people living by the road. Several of these communities have blogged about the topic of cooking on a car engine. The website roadroast.comroadroast.com, , now defunct, was a non-profit website that was intended to teach visitors how they can get started cooking on their engines. The method has also been featured by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall in the TV show A cook on the wild side. The principle of preparing food from the excess heat of a car engine is simple. A hot spot is identified, such as the exhaust manifold. The food that is to be prepared is wrapped in several layers of aluminum foil, which serves two purposes. The first purpose is to act as a conductor so that heat is distributed evenly. The second purpose is to shield the food from any contaminants present in the engine compartment. The food is secured using steel wire and tied down to the hot spot. Finally the car is driven until the food has been cooked.

He is most known for the 15 years he spent at Athletic Bilbao.  Playing career =Club  Born in Cantabria but raised from a young age in Biscay, Oceja's early amateur teams included hometown club Cultural Durango, SD Lemona and CD Basconia. Although naturally right-footed, he learned to play equally well using his left foot and played on that side of the defence upon turning professional with Athletic Bilbao. His début in La Liga was on 6 January 1935, in a game against Real Madrid where Athletic won 4–1. When the Spanish Civil War interrupted the normal football processes, Oceja spent time playing for Barakaldo CF. Returning to Bilbao following the conflict, the club was faced with rebuilding a squad using several young players, and refused to sanction the transfer of the more experienced Oceja to FC Barcelona, an offer which would have greatly increased his salary. He was noted for his elegance on the field and disciplined manner off it. In his career with Athletic he played a total of 239 games (186 in the league), winning a league title in 1935–36 and two consecutive Copas de Generalísimo in 1943 and 1944, the latter as captain. He took no part in the 1942–43 La Liga season where his team finished as champions, having been seriously injured (a ruptured medial meniscus) playing for Spain against France in March 1942, although he recovered to participate in the victorious 1943 Cup campaign, and a double lower leg fracture caused him to miss out on a likely third Cup final appearance in 1945. Due to his injury lay-offs, Athletic tied him to a 'pay as you play' contract, and Oceja admitted that due to his dissatisfaction with the situation he refused to play in a crucial league clash against Valencia CF in 1947 (having been involved in every other match that season); in his absence, Los Ché won the match and went on to secure the title over Athletic on head-to-head results after finishing level on points. International  He received four call-ups for the Spain national team. He made his debut at 12 January 1941 at his 'home' stadium San Mamés in a friendly match against Portugal (2–2), in which his defensive colleague at Athletic Bilbao, Juan José Mieza, also appeared for the first time. Coaching Oceja retired from playing in 1949 after a short stint at Real Zaragoza. The next season, he assumed the role of coach for the Aragonese team, then languishing in the Tercera División, and helped them to achieve promotion. His stint at La Rosaleda did not last long after that achievement, and despite having secured the relevant coaching qualifications, his only later forays into management were two spells with Durango in the lower leagues during the 1950s and 60s.

It was previously under development by Pfizer for the treatment of depression and anxiety. It made it to phase III clinical trials before being discontinued. Synthesis Sunepitron synthesis: G.N. Bright, K.A. Desai, (1992). The synthesis starts by conversion of the pyridine dicarboxylic acid (1) to its acid chloride; rxn with MeOH then affords the ester (2). Catalytic hydrogenation serves to reduce the pyridine ring to a piperidine of undefined stereochemistry (3). Alkylation of this intermediate with chloroacetonitrile affords (4). Treatment of that intermediate with Raney nickel reduces the cyano group to the corresponding primary amine; this product then undergoes an internal ester-amine interchange to yield the cyclized lactam (5). LAH serves to reduce the lactam to an amine; the ester on the other ring is reduced to a carbinol in the process, affording the aminoalcohol (7). The basic function is next alkylated with 2-chloropyrimidine (7). Rxn of the alcoholin (8) with MsCl leads to the mesylate; that group is next displaced by sodium azide (9); the azide group is next reduced to the primary amine. Resolution of this product as its mandelate salt then yields (10) as a single enantiomer. Rxn of that product with succinic anhydride converts the pendant amine to a succinimide, affording the anxiolytic agent sunepitron (1).

In 1893 he appears to have been a Liberal Party supporter. Early life Harris was born at Lisburn, Ireland, in 1836. The family migrated to England, Canada, and Australia, before settling in New Zealand in East Tamaki in 1847. Early in his life, he had a farm in Pukekohe. With the outbreak of the New Zealand Wars, he joined the Otahuhu Cavalry Volunteers in 1861, and, as The Press in Christchurch as a contemporary source records, \\"for a few years subsequently galloped about slaying Maoris in the interests of settlement, civilisation, and Christianity.\\" He returned to his farm in 1866 and married the following year. The locality of Harrisville was named after him as he was the major landowner. Political career He represented the Ramarama electorate on the Auckland Provincial Council from October 1874 until the abolition of provincial councils two years later. He represented South Auckland electorates; Franklin from 1879 to 1881; and then the replacement electorate of Franklin North from 1881. His 1881 election was declared void in 1882, but he won the subsequent . In 1884 he was defeated. He contested the in the reconstituted Franklin electorate, but was defeated by Ebenezer Hamlin. Harris then represented the Franklin electorate from 1893 to 1896, when he was again defeated, by future Prime Minister William Massey. From 1895 until 1896 he was the Liberal Party's junior whip. On 3 February 1897, he was appointed to the Legislative Council. At the end of the seven- year terms, he was reappointed in 1904, 1911 and 1918. He resigned on 20 June 1923. Later life and death Late in his life, he lived in Clyde Street in Epsom. He died at his home, Taumaihi, on 12 February 1928 and was buried at Pukekohe Cemetery. He was survived by his wife Jane, three daughters and one son.

Nomenclature :Curcuma - from the Sanskrit name for turmeric, kuṅkuma. :australasica - for Australian. Description Curcuma australasica is the only Australian native of the 100 or more species of Curcuma found world-wide. It occurs on Cape York Peninsula in Queensland, a few areas in the Northern Territory and in Papua New Guinea. It is typically found growing in moist pockets in sandstone areas, and in wet woodland and forest areas. It grows well in containers where it is often cultivated for its very beautiful, long- lasting flower. C. australasica can be propagated by division, and prefers to be well-watered in summer and allowed to dry in winter, in correspondence with Monsoonal patterns. It is grown for its flowers in Zimbabwe, and a cultivated variety called \\"Aussie Plume\\" is grown in the US which can grow up to 6 ft (almost 2 metres) tall. The native form is usually less than tall, with long green leaves (140-450 x 60–190 mm), pleated. Flowers 15–20 mm, November to March in Queensland, normally yellow on a spike with pink, red, mauve or green bracts. Occasionally a white form is found in the wild - see accompanying photograph. The Aboriginal Gugu Yimithirr language name is kumbigi. Aboriginal people in the Cape York Peninsula area traditionally roasted and ate the rhizomes of this plant.

These include the worship of goddesses such as Thiên Y A Na, The Lady of the Realm (Bà Chúa Xứ), The Lady of the Storehouse (Bà Chúa Kho) and Princess Liễu Hạnh,. legendary figures like Âu Cơ, the Trưng Sisters (Hai Bà Trưng), and Lady Triệu (Bà Triệu), as well as the branch Four Palaces. Many people mistake that Đạo Mẫu is commonly associated with spirit mediumship rituals—known in Vietnam as lên đồng— much as practiced in other parts of Asia, such as Southern China, Myanmar (Mon people) and some community in India, however, that is not correct. Even though some of the priests and priestesses of Đạo Mẫu have the ability of spirit mediumship, that is not the main ritual. The most prominent ritual of Đạo Mẫu is the ceremony of \\"Hầu Bóng\\" (lit. Serving the (Holy) Reflections), in which a priest or priestess would mimic the deities by dressing and acting like them. The priest is in full control of their body. A successful ceremony is one in which the priest feels the deities' essences but it does not mean the deities' spirits enter the priest's mortal body. As a religious leader authorized to perform the sacred rituals of a religion, especially as a mediatory agent between humans and one or more deities, the \\"thanh đồng\\" in Đạo Mẫu is more of the equivalent of a priest rather than a medium or a shaman. Although the Communist government had initially proscribed the practice of such rituals, deeming them to be superstitions, they relented in 1987, once again legalizing their practice. The worshipping of the Mother Goddesses contributes to the appreciation of women in society. Recognized by UNESCO, this Vietnamese ritual was inscribed on Representative List in December 2016. Four Palaces (Tứ Phủ) The most prominent form of Đạo Mẫu is Four Palaces (Tứ Phủ), which worships a hierarchical pantheon of Vietnamese indigenous deities with a strong influence from historical figures, Taoism and Buddhism. Four Palaces is the most common in the North. Other forms in different areas have also developed an interference with other local beliefs.

It serves an advisory function to both the Danish Minister for Science and the Greenland home rule. The commission consists of active researchers from the disciplines of humanities, social science and technical and natural science with equal representation of the two countries and the chair alternating between them. The commission funds research projects, particularly in order to initialize new research. The commission published the journal Meddelelser om Grønland - since 1975 issued as three separate monograph series: * MoG Geoscience * MoG Bioscience * MoG Man & Society  History  The commission was established in 1878 by initiative of the professor of geology Frederik Johnstrup. He argued that the State of Denmark should spend some of the considerable income from kryolite mining concessions on furthering mineralogical and other research actitivities in Greenland. In the very year of foundation, the commission funded an expedition led by J. A. D. Jensen to explore the inland icecap and the nunataks now named for J. A. D. Jensen. From 1879 to 1920, its official name was the Commission for Leading Geological and Geographical Investigations in Greenland (Commissionen for Ledelsen af de geologiske og geographiske Undersøgelser i Grønland). During the 1930s through the 1950s, the geologist Lauge Koch had a very strong influence on the commission's work. Because all research activity in Greenland from 1878 onwards have been recorded by the commission, its archives are extremely valuable to research in the history of Arctic exploration.

Commercial policy is an all encompassing term that is used to cover topics which involve international trade. Trade policy is often described in terms of a scale between the extremes of free trade (no restrictions on trade) on one side and protectionism (high restrictions to protect local producers) on the other. A common commercial policy can sometimes be agreed by treaty within a customs union, as with the European Union's common commercial policy and in Mercosur. A nation's commercial policy will include and take into account the policies adopted by that nation's government while negotiating international trade. There are several factors that can have an impact on a nation's commercial policy, all of which can have an impact on international trade policies.  Theories on international trade policy Trade policy has been controversial since the days of Mercantilism. Economics (or political economy) has developed in major part as an effort to make clear various effects of trade policies. See International trade theory. Hottest topic in economic policy is upgrading in Global Value Chains.  Types and aspects of Commercial policy = Regionalism  Regionalism, or Regional Trade Agreements (RTA), are trade policies and agreements that are crafted by the nations in a region for the purposes of increasing international trade in the area. RTAs have been described by supporters as a means of increasing free trade with the goal of eventually merging into larger, either bilateral or multilateral, trade deals. The more relatively local area of RTAs are useful in resolving trade issues as well without causing gridlock in other trade agreements. Critics of RTAs say that they are a hindrance to the negotiation of trade because they can be lopsided or unfairly beneficial to one side over the other sides, particularly if some of the participants are nations that are still in development. As China was rising in economic power and prominence, they turned to regionalism as a strategic method of leveling the playing field with Europe and the United States. In 2000, China signed the Bangkok agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to reduce tariffs in the region. The signing of the agreement also began the push for a formal Free Trade Agreement between China and ASEAN. However, strained relations between China and other Asian nations such as Japan have prevented the same level of regional FTAs to be put in place with Northeast Asia.  Bilateral Free Trade Agreements  When two countries enter into a bilateral trade agreement, they are essentially giving one another special deals and favorable treatment in the arrangements. These privileges can include lowering tariffs on each others goods and services. The United States has signed such treaties as the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 as well as with Israel in the 1980s. Experts who support such free trade agreements argue that these deals help to increase competition and offers larger markets that businesses can reach out to. Critics of bilateral agreements claim that a larger nation, such as the United States, can use these agreements to unfairly push smaller states into much harsher work loads than the World Trade Organization already requires. Relations between the European Union and South Korea have led to both parties signing several bilateral agreements regarding trade policy. In 2009, South Korea and the EU signed the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement. The signing of the agreement created an FTA that is second only to NAFTA in size. The agreement held the benefits of increased free trade between the participants in the FTA as well as increased challenge to the United States.  Preferential Trade Agreements  Preferential agreements are trade deals that involve nations making deals with specific countries that can aid the interests of one another as opposed to the nondiscriminatory deals that are pushed by the WTO. Nations have been increasingly preferring such deals since the 1950s as they are quicker to show gains for the parties involved in the agreements. A common argument that has been made is that it allows businesses to open up markets that would otherwise be considered closed and therefore falls into the free trade idea that most countries will push for. Countries that have similar levels of GDP and a higher scope in their economies as well as their relative position to one another and the rest of the world are more likely to have preferential trade agreements. PTAs can also be applied to regional areas with unions such as NAFTA, the European Union, and ASEAN being examples of regional PTAs. Those who opposer PTAs argue that these deals have increased the importance of where a product is made so that tariffs can be applied accordingly. The certification of a product's origin also unfairly holds back smaller countries that have less resources to spend. Others argue that PTAs can hinder negotiations of trade disputes and places an emphasis of which country has more power.  Ways in which commercial policy is affected = Tariffs  Trade tariffs are a tax that are placed on the import of foreign goods. Tariffs increase the price of imports and are usually levied onto the country the goods are being imported from. Governments will use tariffs as a way to promote competition within their own country with businesses of the foreign country that wishes to sell their goods or services. In some instances, a country's government will use them as a means of protectionism for their own interests. In modern history, generally starting at the mid-20th century, the use of tariffs has been largely diminished in favor of the rise of international trade. Beginning in 2017, the Trump administration began to impose tariffs on several of nations that were involved in trade deals with the United States. The countries targeted by the Trump Tariffs then retaliated with their own tariffs on American goods.  Import Quotas  Import quotas are the limitations of the amount of goods that can be imported into the country from foreign businesses. Generally, an import quota is set for a specific period of time with one year being the most common metric. Some versions of the quotas limits the quantity of specific goods being imported into a country while other versions place the limit on the value of those goods. The objectives of quotas can include: the protections of a nations interests, ensuring a balance of trade so as not to create deficits, retaliation to restrictive trade policies of other countries that do business on the international playing field.

Claims of the plot first surfaced in the liberal Taraf newspaper, which was passed documents detailing plans to bomb two Istanbul mosques and accuse Greece of shooting down a Turkish plane over the Aegean Sea. The plan was to stir up chaos and justify a military coup. The army said the plans had been discussed but only as part of a scenario-based planning exercise at a military seminar.Şimdi de Balyoz Melih Aşık in Milliyet of 22 January 2010; accessed on 13 April 2011BBC, 29 July 2011, Turkey: Military chiefs resign en masse The case was heavily criticised by the political opposition for the suspected involvement of high-ranking bureaucrats and legal officials which were close to the Cemaat movement, an Islamist movement led by exiled cleric and (then) AKP ally Fethullah Gülen. Numerous legal flaws and improper procedures throughout the case, and the lack of a response by the government also drew concern. This included the case that the original Sledgehammer document, claimed to have been produced in 2003, was actually created using Microsoft Word 2007. Other irregularities included the forging of signatures of high-ranking military officers, such as that of General Çetin Doğan. In 2012 some 300 of the 365 suspects were sentenced to prison terms, while 34 suspects were acquitted. The case was to be appealed. On 19 June 2014 all the accused were ordered released from prison, pending a retrial, after a finding by the Constitutional Court that their rights had been violated. The timing of the decision fuelled further accusations regarding the involvement of the Cemaat movement initially, since by 2014 the AKP and Gülen had fallen out with each other. Furthermore, the then-AKP Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan openly accused the Cemaat movement of infiltrating the judiciary following a government corruption scandal, beginning a large-scale operation of either removing or relocating judicial and law enforcement employees. On 31 March 2015 all 236 suspects were acquitted after the case's prosecutor argued that digital data in the files submitted as evidence in the case were faked and did not constitute evidence.

It is found in East Asia, in particular China and Japan. The subspecies P. chinensis antennalis is an invasive species in New Zealand,Crowe, A. (2002). Which New Zealand Insect? Auckland, N.Z.: Penguin. . having arrived in 1979.Asian Paper Wasp , Biosecurity New Zealand. Retrieved 8 February 2013. The wasps prey on invertebrates, especially caterpillars. In this species, queens destroy up to 70% of worker-laid eggs and are aided by workers in a process known as worker policing. Taxonomy and phylogeny P. chinensis is a member of the cosmopolitan genus Polistes, the largest genus in the family Vespidae, with over 300 recognized species and subspecies. Two subspecies are known: * P. chinensis chinensis, (Fabricius, 1793) * P. chinensis antennalis Pérez, 1905 Description and identification The Asian paper wasp has a slender body about in length. Their bodies are reddish brown or black, with yellow rings and reddish areas on the abdomen. Their wings are reddish or amber brown, and they have long legs that hang down during flight. The general morphology of the spermatheca is similar in both reproductive and non- reproductive individuals. The spermathecal gland attaches to the central region of the spermatheca. Lateral view- female Distribution and habitat The Asian paper wasp frequently constructs nests on man-made structures including houses and buildings. It will also build nests on trees or bushes, usually on branches, but sometimes on leaves as well. P. chinensis prefers to colonize urban habitats, but nests have also been recorded near forest clearings. They sometimes build their nests in dense shrubs, making them difficult to locate. Large populations usually develop in warm, lowland areas with open habitat such as shrublands, swamps and meadows. The paper wasp is native to East Asia. It has been recorded in China, Japan, Korea and Mongolia. The subspecies P. chinensis antennalis is invasive in New Zealand. It is widespread in the North Island and the northern South Island and competes with native species for food,. It has since been recorded in Norfolk Island and New South Wales. At least two independent invasion events, linked to Kanto and Kyushu, Japan, have been proposed as sources of the New Zealand wasps. The Asian paper wasp was first recorded in New Zealand in 1979, in Kohimarama and the Whangaparaoa Peninsula. It remained confined to these areas of Auckland until 1984, when it began appearing in inner city areas and western suburbs. Natural history=Colony cycle An overwintered female, who has been inseminated during the previous autumn, emerges during the spring and begins nest cell construction and egg laying. The first broods emerge in late spring or early summer and are entirely female. Males are produced from early summer onwards. Following male production, no more females are produced for the rest of the season. This colony cycle can be divided into three stages: a solitary stage, a superindividual stage and a social stage. During the solitary stage the foundress builds the nest and cares for the first generation of brood. This stage ends when the first workers emerge. The superindividual stage ends when the first reproductive forms emerge. The social stage ends when the colony disintegrates. Resource allocation Food collection is very costly to the foundress of a colony and carries a high risk of mortality. However, it is a necessary activity for colony survival. Most collected proteinaceous material is consumed by larvae. A significant amount, fourteen percent, is allocated to oral secretions. P. chinensis, like many social wasps, uses a proteinaceous oral secretion to glue nest material to maintain and build the nest. The oral secretion of P. chinensis is 73% proteinaceous materials. The queen will augment this investment in response to the environment. Oral secretions increase during rainy seasons, because the foundress must smear oral secretion frequently over the nest surfaces to avoid risk of destruction. Nests in exposed sites vs. sheltered sites show no significant difference in dry weight of secretions produced by the foundress. However, foundresses that nest in sheltered sites bring in more prey then those at exposed sites. Therefore, the relative amount of proteinaceous resources allocated to oral secretions is greater, at 22%. Cannibalism Foraging by a lone foundress has a high cost of predation risk for both herself and her brood. Furthermore, foraging success of a lone foundress has been estimated to be low. Rather than increase foraging time, P. chinensis will cannibalize their own larvae when there is not enough honey or prey available during the solitary stage of colony development. The foundress targets larvae of different developmental stages depending on whether prey or honey is the limiting resource. Under scarce prey condition, foundresses cannibalize young larvae and intensively feed them to older larvae to ensure successful production of the first generation of workers. It is important that the queen successfully rear the first set of brood because she has a high risk of mortality while maintaining the nest on her own. In a honey limited environment, older larvae are more likely to be targeted. When larvae do not consume honey, they no longer produce saliva, which is an important nutrient resource for the adult wasp. When large larvae cannot produce enough saliva they are more likely to be cannibalized as a nutrient resource for the foundress herself. Nest guarding Foundresses need to leave the nest to gather prey, nest materials and water. When she does so there is a risk that conspecific females will depredate her brood. These females fly to a nest, pull out a single larva and return to their own nests to feed their own larva with it. Foundresses chase off attacking females by spiral flight, whereby two females fly in the air in a double helix pattern. Attendance on nests successfully deters attacking females. Foundresses use the loss of a larva as a cue to assess predation risk, and increase their defense efforts in response. When a larva is removed, lone foundresses increase the total time spent on the nest by decreasing time spent on each off nest activities, and increasing the time interval between consecutive activities. There is not a difference in the number of off nest activities. After 30 minutes following the removal of a larva, the time spent on the nest begins returning to the pre-removal level. After 60 minutes, time spent on the nest returns to pre- removal levels. Kin selection=Genetic relatedness within colonies Asian paper wasps are monandrous. Like other species of eusocial wasp, males are haploid and emerge from unfertilized eggs. Workers are .5 times genetically related to their sons, .375 times to their nephews, .25 times to their brothers, and .75 times to their sisters. According to kin selection theory, this relatedness predicts worker queen conflict. Workers should police the foundresses male eggs. However, this model does not seem to apply to P. chinensis. In fact, the opposite occurs, workers police each other. Reproduction conflict Workers police each other's eggs. 88.5% of queens eggs survive to hatching vs 1.4% of worker’s. Worker reproduction is frequent in queen-right colonies in which the queen is alive. Both queen and workers replaced workers eggs. P. chinensis was studied alongside Polistes snelleni for comparison in this conflict. In P. snelleni, queens monopolize egg production. Queens contributed 2.4 times more to replacing than workers. Workers sequentially perform oophagy and oviposition in the same cells. The ratio of worker-produced eggs to eggs laid by the queen is 3 or 4 times to one in a colony having between 100 and 500 wasps. Worker-worker conflict Worker-worker policing is predicted to occur in polyandrous nests. A few hypotheses have been proposed to explain worker policing in the monandrous P. chinensis. The colony efficiency hypothesis proposes that worker policing is selected for because worker production imposes a cost on worker productivity. However worker oophagy is only observed in conjunction with oviposition. The colony efficiency theory predicts that even non reproductive workers would participate in policing. Another explanation is that worker policing occurs because of the size constraints of the colony. Workers collectively produce more eggs than the queen. The difference in egg production becomes more pronounced as the colony grows larger. Therefore, as nest size increases, competition for limited oviposition space becomes more intense, with workers destroying their nestmates eggs so they have room for their own. This theory has yet to be confirmed. Worker- queen conflict Foundresses in P. chinensis control colony investment but allow worker oviposition. On average, around 40% of males in queen-right colonies are the sons of workers. The observed sex allocation ratio in field observations performed by the Natural History Museum and Institute in Japan was .61, while the expected ratio in queen-right colonies is .48. Variation in sex allocation ratio is likely explained by limited queen control. Interaction with other species=Diet P. chinensis collects nectar and honeydew from flowers. The wasp preys on invertebrates, preferring larvae and caterpillars of lepidopteran insects (moths and butterflies) for protein resources. Asian paper wasps also feed on the larvae of other conspecific females. Larval saliva is an important nutrient resource for adult Asian paper wasps. This contains a high concentration of free amino acids, 50 times that of floral nectars, and is nutritionally analogous to nectar.

On 28 April 1868, Hamlin married Sarah Grace Barriball, the daughter of Charles Barriball of Waiuku, at his father's house near Waiuku (Barriball Road in Waiuku commemorates the location of the family's land). Electors from Waiuku presented a requisition to Hamlin in November 1869 to stand for election in the Raglan electorate for the Auckland Provincial Council, which he accepted. Three representatives were elected on 20 December, and of four candidates, Joseph May came first and Hamlin came second. Hamlin remained a member of the provincial council until the abolition of provincial government in 1875. He represented the South Auckland seats of Franklin in the New Zealand House of Representatives from 1876 to 1881; and then the replacement electorate of Franklin South from 1881 to 1890. He then represented the reconstituted Franklin electorate from 1890 to 1893 when he retired. He was never defeated. He served as Chairman of Committees from 1882 to 1890. He died at his residence in the Auckland suburb of Remuera on 4 June 1900. He was survived by his wife, three sons, and seven daughters.

Dichloromethylphenidate is a potent psychostimulant that acts as both a dopamine reuptake inhibitor and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, meaning it effectively boosts the levels of the norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitters in the brain, by binding to, and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally remove those monoamines from the synaptic cleft. 3,4-DCMP, the threo-diastereomer, is approximately seven times more potent than methylphenidate in animal studies, but has weaker reinforcing effects due to its slower onset of action. However, H. M. Deutsch's discrimination ratio implies it to be more reinforcing than cocaine. Legality As of October 2015 3,4-CTMP is a controlled substance in China. 3,4-CTMP was banned in the UK as a Temporary Class Drug from April 2015 following its unapproved sale as a designer drug.Methylphenidate-based NPS: A review of the evidence of use and harm.

Buckland was born in 1819 or 1820. His mother was Elizabeth (née Mortimore) and his father was the broker John Buckland; they were from Devon, England. The auctioneer Alfred Buckland was a younger brother. Buckland arrived in New Zealand in 1841 from South Australia, and was a butcher in Auckland, then a farmer in the Waikato. He married Susan Channing on 13 April 1843 at St Paul's Church in Auckland. Buckland was appointed to the Auckland Executive Council of the Auckland Province in November 1856 (the source does not state and end date), and was again appointed from February to July 1857. He was elected to the Auckland Provincial Council for the Raglan electorate in November 1861 and served until 1869. From 1869 to 1873, he represented the Franklin electorate. He had no intention of standing for the Provincial Council again but happened to ride past the nomination meeting in Newmarket for the Eden electorate. There was only one nomination thus far for the two available positions, and Buckland was talked into being nominated. As the number of nominations matched the number of available positions, he was declared elected unopposed, and served until his death. He represented two South Auckland electorates; first the Raglan electorate from to 1866, when he retired to go overseas. He then represented the Franklin electorate from 1871 to 1875. He was nominated for the 1876 election and gave a speech at the nomination meeting on 10 January 1876, but withdrew his nomination before the end of the proceedings. The Auckland Star suggested that the sole purpose of his nomination was that he could make a speech in opposition to Sir George Grey. Buckland left for the Waikato immediately afterwards to support Alfred Cox in his candidacy in the electorate. However, he became ill with symptoms of heat stroke and returned to his home in Remuera. He died at his home in Remuera, Auckland aged 56 years after that brief illness. He was buried at St Stephen's Cemetery in Parnell. His wife had died in September 1871; she had committed suicide after having become depressed. Their sons Frank and John Buckland were both elected to the parliament in the ; their daughter Elizabeth Mary married prominent Dunedin doctor and historian Thomas Morland Hocken.

He was beaten by Captain Benjamin Harris, who had since been one of the two members of the electorate, by just two votes. Early in 1882, Buckland petitioned to the courts against the election on various grounds. The case was heard by the Chief Justice, James Prendergast, and Justice Gillies, who declared the election void. Buckland and Harris contested the resulting , which was won by Harris by 529 votes to 499. In the , Buckland defeated Harris in Franklin North.

He worked as a lector at the Faculty of Law of the University of Oslo from 1965 to 1975. In 1975 he became professor of jurisprudence at the Norwegian School of Economics. Gundersen was elected a Member of Parliament in 1981 representing the Progress Party platform, but did not formally join the party until 1990. He fell out of parliament in 1985, but was re-elected for three consecutive four-year terms from 1989. He left the party in 2001, and failed to get re-elected to parliament again in the election later the same year, having stood for a local electoral list. Following the defeat, he retired as politician. Early life and education Gundersen was born in Tynset in Hedmark to lawyer Ragnar Gundersen (1895–1985) and Betzy Lommeland (1902–1994). After finishing his secondary education in 1954, he came through the Russian language course of the Norwegian army, and achieved the law degree cand.jur. at the University of Oslo in 1961. In 1963 he was the vice chairman of the Norwegian Students' Society. He took the admission course in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1963, and was a secretary in the Ministry until 1965. Professional career From 1965 he worked as a lector at the Faculty of Law of the University of Oslo, first in private law, then in public law. In 1973 he achieved the doctoral degree dr. juris. In 1975 he became professor of jurisprudence at the Norwegian School of Economics. He was an awarded lecturer, and has written a large number of publications, regarding law, economics, parliamentary issues such as control of trade monopolies, administrative law, trade law, governance mechanisms, contract law and related things. Many of his books were issued through his own publishing house, operating out of Jar and Sandvika. In 2006 he admitted to having been a secret intelligence agent for Norway, having reported to the Norwegian Intelligence Service from communist congresses he attended in the Soviet Union during the 1950s and 1960s. This was revealed after pressure from Dag Seierstad who had accused him of this for a long time. In addition to Norwegian, Gundersen had a fluent command of Russian, English, German, French and also spoke some Spanish. He was a member of the Broadcasting Council from 1986 to 1990, having been a deputy member since 1982. From 1983 to 1985 he was also a member of the commission that prepared the launch of TV 2. Political career Gundersen was an active member of the Conservative Party from the mid-1960s. He was chairman of the party's Tenkegruppe 99 from 1966 to 1971 and a member of the party's political council until 1975. In the mid-1970s Gundersen left both the Conservative Party and the Church of Norway, as he according to himself \\"wanted to stand completely free.\\" He was elected to the Parliament of Norway in 1981 representing the Progress Party, although he did not formally join the party until 1990, and was technically an independent before that. He represented the county of Akershus. He lost his seat in 1985, and the same year he wrote the memoir-like Fri og frank på Tinget. He decided to enter local politics, and from 1987 to 1989 he was a member of the Bærum municipal council. He was re-elected to Parliament in 1989, 1993 and 1997. He thus served three consecutive terms, until 2001. During these twelve terms, he stayed a member of the Parliament's Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Enlarged Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. In February 2001, Gundersen left the party due to not being renominated for a safe seat in Akershus. Other reasons were the recent exclusions and interventions in local nominations by party chairman Carl I. Hagen. Gundersen tried together with other breakaways of the party to run with the Liberal People's Party, but as this failed he rather ran for the new local Oslo List. The election for the party became a failure, and he thus pulled out from active politics. Political views Gundersen regarded himself as a libertarian, and was noticed in the Norwegian public debate for numerous unexpected inputs. During the 1960s and 1970s he was a political commentator in the magazine Dag og Tid. During this time, he among other things argued in favor of the Vietnam War, apartheid, the Cold War and the European Economic Community. Later, during his time as a politician for the Progress Party, he argued in favor of boycott of such countries as Iran, China and Cuba, and against immigration. He was regarded as one of the more intellectual and ideological figures in the party. He claimed that Norwegians are a homogenous people, poorly able to absorb large ethnic minorities who are mostly loyal to their own culture, and that potential problems regarding this will only become more evident in the future. In 1997, he called for a stop of foreign cultural immigration to avoid conflicts, and stated that he thought immigrants of the time could be the terrorists of the future. In 1997 he also drew parallels to the Bosnian War as a possible future scenario in Norway, that \\"there is a great risk that we will become flooded by Muslims\\", and that he would not be surprised if Norway would see \\"serious terrorism\\" within ten to twenty years. In early 2001 he nonetheless praised Muslims in cities like Cairo and Istanbul for taking more personal care of their friends and family, instead of merely being dependent on public welfare programs which is common in countries like Norway. Personal life Gundersen was married in 1965 to Mosse Piene (1 April 1935 – 1991). After her death, he lived in cohabitation with Marit Munro (born 13 November 1939). Gundersen spent much of his free time in Vence, France. Fridtjof Frank Gundersen died in November 2011 after long-term illness.

It was renamed in the UK to Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies and Credit Unions Act 1965 by the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies and Credit Unions Act 2010. From 1 August 2014 it was repealed and replaced by the consolidating Co- operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014. History In the UK, and some Commonwealth countries, many co-operatives are registered as industrial and provident societies. Since 2014 the applicable laws now explicitly name co-operatives and community benefit societies in their titles. In January 2012 the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron announced a project to consolidate all the legislation applicable to industrial and provident societies. There was some uncertainty as to how far new developments would address the problems with the legislation. In mid-2012, revision of laws for co-operative was in its early stages. The enactment of the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014 completed the reform process.  Jurisdiction  This legislation applies in Great Britain (England, Wales, and Scotland). Northern Ireland has its own very similar legislation. The 1965 and 1968 Acts also apply to Jersey and Guernsey.

They grow up to long, with two large antennae used for swimming and a single compound eye. The legs are used to catch copepods that it comes into contact with by chance. Leptodora kindtii is found in temperate lakes across the Northern Hemisphere and is probably the only cladoceran ever described in a newspaper; L. richardi is only known from eastern Russia. For most of the year, Leptodora reproduces parthenogenetically, with males only appearing late in the season, to produce winter eggs which hatch the following spring. Leptodora is the only genus in its family, the Leptodoridae, and suborder, Haplopoda. Description Adults of Leptodora are the largest planktonic cladocerans native to North America; reports vary concerning the largest size, but adult females typically grow to long, but with some reports of females up to . They are about 98% transparent, as a defense against predation by fish. Lilljeborg notes: > > The female is transparent to such a high degree, literally \\"as clear as > water\\", that her presence is often only given away by her movements. In > bright sunlight, the shadow is normally seen before the animal itself. The male is similarly transparent. The abdomen is elongated, but the carapace is small and only covers the brood pouch. The six pairs of thoracic appendages form a \\"feeding basket\\" which is used to capture prey. The second antennae are used for swimming, while the first antennae are rudimentary in females but elongated in males, where they are used in sexual reproduction. There is a single large compound eye which takes up much of the animal's head. It comprises around 500 facets, which are spherically arranged, and the whole eye is movable by up to 10° in any direction. Distribution Leptodora kindtii is widespread in northern temperate lakes. In North America, it occurs as far south as Texas and Oklahoma. It is also found across Europe, in parts of North Africa, northern Arabia, and in Asia (north of the Himalaya). Ecology and behaviour Daphnia is an important prey item for Leptodora kindtii. Leptodora kindtii is a voracious predator and is capable of controlling numbers of its preferred prey items, which are generally juveniles of Daphnia, Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia, Diaphanosoma, Diaptomus, Polyphemus and Cyclops. It seems to encounter its prey by chance, with contact initiating a reflex, in which the abdomen is brought forward to close the feeding basket. In many cases, the prey escapes this haphazard response. Juvenile Daphnia are slower than adults to respond to the predator's attack, and are therefore more likely to be caught. The most important predators of Leptodora are fishes, including whitefish, perch, ziege and bleak. In Lake Biwa, Japan, L. kindtii is parasitised by the nematode Raphidascaris biwakoensis, a parasite of fish. Life cycle Female Leptodora produce a brood of eggs through parthenogenesis every 12 hours. These eggs hatch into a larval stage about long. There are six further instars before the adult form is reached with a length of . The time taken to reach adulthood is temperature dependent, but takes between 3 and 6 days. For most of the year, reproduction is parthenogenetic, with eggs being produced by females without males being present in the population. In the autumn, parthenogenetically produced males begin to appear; males and females then reproduce sexually. The resulting eggs sink to the bottom where they overwinter, hatching the following year as nauplius-like larvae. Related taxa Leptodora is so distinct from other cladocerans that some authors have suggested grouping all other cladocerans into a clade called \\"Eucladocera\\", with Leptodora as its sister group. It is now believed, however, that Leptodora is sister to Onychopoda, being the only genus in the family Leptodoridae and the subclass Haplopoda. Features which separate it from other families include its large size, the lack of branchial appendages (gills) on its legs, the reduction of the carapace, and the fact that the winter eggs hatch as nauplii. Taxonomic history Leptodora was first found in the Bremer Stadtgraben, and described by the local scientist G. W. Focke. Leptodora kindtii is \\"probably the only cladoceran ever described in a newspaper\\". The German microscopist Gustav Woldemar Focke organised a scientific meeting in Bremen in 1844 together with the pharmacist Georg Christian Kindt. He studied the fauna of the ditches surrounding the city (the ') and displayed live specimens at the meeting. During the meeting, he also published a description of the species in the ' on Sunday September 22, 1844, placing the species in the genus Polyphemus. However, this description was ignored by the scientific community, and Wilhelm Lilljeborg described the species in 1861 with the name Leptodora hyalina. The synonymy was not noticed until Simon Albrecht Poppe informed Lilljeborg of it in 1889, and Lilljeborg corrected the error in his 1900 monograph. In 2009, a second species, Leptodora richardii, was described from individuals collected from lakes in the Amur River basin, including Lake Bolon. Synonyms Synonyms of Leptodora kindtii include: *Polyphemus kindti Focke, 1844 *Hyalosoma dux Wagner, 1868 *Leptodora angusta Sars, 1890 *Leptodora hyalina Lilljeborg, 1861 *Leptodora pellucida Joseph, 1882 Etymology The name Leptodora is from the Greek words ' and ', collectively meaning thin-skinned. The specific epithet kindtii is presumed to refer to G. C. Kindt, who worked closely with Focke. The alternative spelling kindti is sometimes encountered, but is no longer considered correct under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. The epithet hyalina, used by Lilljeborg, is from the Greek ', and means glassy.

Le Mars was returning to France after the failed Duc d'Anville Expedition, 11 October 1746 and was subsequently captured. The Duc d'Anville expedition (June – October 1746) was sent from France to recapture Louisbourg and take peninsular Acadia (present-day mainland Nova Scotia). The expedition was the largest military force ever to set sail for the New World prior to the American Revolutionary War. This effort was the fourth and final French attempt to regain the Nova Scotian capital, Annapolis Royal, during King George's War. The Expedition was also supported on land by a force from Quebec under the command of Jean- Baptiste Nicolas Roch de Ramezay. Along with recapturing Acadia from the British, d'Anville was ordered to \\"consign Boston to flames, ravage New England and waste the British West Indies.\\" News of the expedition spread fear throughout New York and New England. The expedition was a complete failure. It was beset by bad weather and took three months to cross the Atlantic Ocean. Many in the ships' crews and the troops being transported fell ill before the expedition finally reached Chebucto Bay (present-day Halifax Harbour), and d'Anville died not long after its arrival. His successors in command attempted to mount an assault on Annapolis Royal, but eventually gave up and returned to France. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow immortalized the expedition with his poem A Ballad of the French Fleet.  Historic context  The British had captured the capital of Acadia in the siege of Port Royal (1710) and renamed it Annapolis Royal. Over the next fifty years, the French and their allies made six unsuccessful military attempts to regain the city. The Duc d'Anville expedition, which was coordinated with Ramezay's expedition from Quebec, was the last French attempt to retake the capital of Acadia. King Louis XV sent it during King George's War, following the stinging French defeat at the siege of Louisbourg (1745).  Preparation  Admiral Jean-Baptiste Louis Frédéric de La Rochefoucauld de Roye, Duc d'Anville The expedition included 11,000 men and a fleet of 64 ships. The expedition was led by French Admiral Jean-Baptiste Louis Frédéric de La Rochefoucauld de Roye, Duc d'Anville. The commissary general in charge of supplies was François Bigot. The fitting-out of this fleet was slow and difficult, and it did not set sail from Île-d'Aix, France until 22 June 1746. A subsequent storm in the Bay of Biscay and adverse winds slowed the transatlantic crossing. Disease broke out on the ships – typhus and scurvy. The fleet ran into a long, dead calm off the Azores. This ended in a storm, during which several vessels were struck by lightning, which, in one case, caused a magazine explosion that killed and wounded over thirty men. By 24 August, the expedition had been at sea for over two months but was still from Nova Scotia. On 10 September, lead elements of the expedition had arrived at Sable Island. Three days later the vessels were scattered by a violent gale that seriously damaged some ships, which were consequently forced to return to France. One of the damaged vessels was Le Mars (pictured above). She was heavily damaged and taking on water in the storm off Sable Island and decided to return to France with Le Raphael. Several weeks later another gale hit, damaging Le Mars further and separating her from Le Raphael. off Ireland severely damaged Le Mars in an attack and took her as a prize in October 1746. She was added to the British Navy as HMS Mars (during the French and Indian War, this ship sank in Halifax Harbour in June 1755 after hitting a rock - known to this day as \\"Mars Rock\\".) ; An expedition under the command of Jean- Baptiste Nicolas Roch de Ramezay was sent from Quebec to work with d'Anville's expedition. French priest Jean-Louis Le Loutre was to coordinate the two expeditions. (French priest Pierre Maillard, returning from France, sailed with the expedition.) De Ramezay's force arrived in Nova Scotia in July 1746. He had 700 soldiers and 21 officers. He made camp at Beaubassin, where he was met by 300 Abenaki from St. John River and about 300 Mi'kmaq from Nova Scotia. The total French-Indian force numbered close to 1,300 men. De Ramezay's soldiers spent the summer and early fall at Chignecto and Minas waiting for the arrival of the long overdue D'Anville expedition.Ramezay sent Joseph- Michel Legardeur de Croisille et de Montesson along with over 500 men, 200 of whom were Mi'kmaq, to Port-La-Joie. In July 1746 the battle happened near York River. Montesson and his troops killed forty New Englanders and captured the rest. Montesson was commended for having distinguished himself in his first independent command.(See History of Prince Edward Island) (During this time period, de Ramezay sent troops to British-occupied Port-La-Joye on present-day Prince Edward Island. In a fierce battle, de Ramezay's men killed 34 British troops and imprisoned the rest.)  Acadia  The d'Anville expedition finally reached Nova Scotia in late September, after enduring a three-month voyage. Hundreds of sailors and soldiers had died and hundreds more were gravely ill, suffering from disease. Forty-four vessels anchored in Chebucto (present day Halifax, Nova Scotia), where the expedition would spend the next five weeks. Mural of Duc D'Anville Expedition in Birch Cove, Halifax Harbour by Peter Bresnen The sick were brought ashore near Birch Cove in the harbour's Bedford Basin. Some recovered from scurvy with the arrival of fresh supplies brought by the Acadians from Grand Pre and Pisiquid, but typhus and typhoid continued to ravage the men. Within six days of his arrival, on 27 September, d'Anville died after suffering a stroke. (He was buried on Georges Island in what is now Halifax Harbour. His remains stayed there for three years before being taken to Louisbourg in September 1749 during the establishment of Halifax.) On 29 September a council of war led by d'Anville's replacement, Constantin-Louis d'Estourmel, decided to send 1,500 men from the expedition and 300 from the Ramezay expedition to attack Annapolis Royal. D'Estourmel became overwhelmed and discouraged and quickly resigned after a suicide attempt. The next to assume control of the expedition was the Governor General designate of New France and passenger with the fleet Jacques-Pierre de Taffanel de la Jonquière, Marquis de la Jonquière. The plan to attack the capital Annapolis Royal intensified, even while men continued to die of disease. By mid-October, 41 percent of the men who reached Chebucto with the fleet were dead or seriously ill – 2,861 petty officers, seamen and soldiers. The contagion spread to the Mi'kmaq and de Ramezay's men.; Duc D' Anville approaching Chebucto, Westin Hotel Murial (inset), Halifax, Nova Scotia By mid-October 300 of de Ramezay's troops arrived at Annapolis Royal. The French and Indian fighters spent 21 days camped in the Annapolis area waiting for the French ships to arrive with troops and siege artillery. They cut off British land communications with Minas and attempted to stop all contact between the fort and the Acadians. On 24 October, 42 vessels left Chebucto, with almost 50 Acadian pilots from Minas. Three hospital ships set sail for France with the most critically ill. Thirteen of the ships carried 94 officers and 1,410 soldiers to conduct the siege. Two days later, as the fleet was off Cape Negro, Nova Scotia La Jonquiere changed his mind. He ordered his ships back to France and dispatched orders to Annapolis Royal for de Ramezay to withdraw.  Aftermath  Duc d'Anville Encampment Monument, Birch Cove, Halifax, Nova Scotia In response to the threat posed by the French expeditions, Massachusetts Bay Governor William Shirley sent Colonel Arthur Noble and hundreds of New England soldiers to secure control over Acadia and drive de Ramezay out. One of the most startling successes of de Ramezay's campaign was Nicolas Antoine II Coulon de Villiers' defeat of Colonel Noble at the Battle of Grand Pré (1747). De Villiers attacked and defeated a superior force of Noble's militia who were billeted in houses in the Acadian settlement of Grand-Pré, in the Minas Basin at the top of the Bay of Fundy. The failure of the French expedition had serious implications for Acadian participation in the rest of the war. Any confidence that Acadians may have had that France would be victorious was shaken. After the expedition, Nova Scotia Governor Paul Mascarene told Acadians to avoid all \\"deluding Hopes of Returning under the Dominion of France.\\" One French officer noted that when de Ramezay was withdrawing from Annapolis Royal, the Acadians were alarmed and disappointed, feeling they were being abandoned by the mainland French authorities. The disease from the French crews spread among the Mi'kmaq, killing hundreds of them. ; The last major engagement in the area of Annapolis Royal was during the French and Indian War in the Battle of Bloody Creek (1757). The site of Duc d’Anville's encampment in September 1746 was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1925.

Role of scientists of the Vologda Dairy Institute in solving theoretical and practical problems of dairying He was one of the founders of the Soviet dairy industry at the beginning of the 20th century. Through the work of Korolev, his colleagues and students, the microbiology of milk and dairy products was developed considerably. Early life Korolev was born in Moscow in 1874. He graduated in 1900 from Kazan University, and stayed at the department of geography in preparation for the professoriate. In 1902, for participation in the revolutionary movement Sergey Korolev was sent to the Arkhangelsk province, but since 1907 received permission to live in Moscow, worked for agronomists bacteriological station. Career At 1918, Sergei Alexandrovich Korolev worked at the Department of Microbiology and Zoology at the Vologda Milk Institute. In 1920, he was elected professor of microbiology. He was engaged in improving the quality of dairy products and increasing shelf life (v1922, 1926). In particular, he proved that the yeast were not the agents of rancidity of butter (as some researchers thought), but on the contrary, they are antagonists of the problem and that most species of yeast occurring in oil retains in its mold. Methods of application of special yeast culture to combat mold oil, widely spread in practice to improve the safety of all types of oil. In 1923–24, S. Korolev, together with the professor G.S. Inihovym and students studied the microbiological and biochemical processes of maturation of a number of hard and soft cheese, produced in the USSR. The work enabled the first time to make a harmonious synthesis of a unified theory of ripening cheeses. Prior to that, this theory put forward a Swiss scientist Freydenreyh, based on studies of only Swiss cheese. Sergei Korolev is the author of Technical Microbiology of Milk and Milk Products (1940), recognized as one of the best books in this branch of science. Also, he co-authored with G.

They may be organised in numerous ways, but the egoless programming team and chief programmer team have been common structures.  Description  A programming team comprises people who develop or maintain computer software.  Programming team structures  Programming teams may be organised in numerous ways, but the egoless programming team and chief programmer team are two common structures typically used. The main determinants when choosing the programming team structure typically include: difficulty, size, duration, modularity, reliability, time, and sociability. Egoless programming According to Marilyn Mantei, individuals that are a part of a decentralized programming team report higher job satisfaction. But an egoless programming team contains groups of ten or fewer programmers. Code is exchanged and goals are set amongst the group members. Leadership is rotated within the group according to the needs and abilities required during a specific time. The lack of structure in the egoless team can result in a weakness of efficiency, effectiveness, and error detection for large-scale projects. Egoless programming teams work best for tasks that are very complex.  Chief programmer team  A chief programmer team will usually contain three-person teams consisting of a chief programmer, senior level programmer, and a program librarian. Additional programmers and analysts are added to the team when necessary. The weaknesses of this structure include a lack of communication across team members, task cooperation, and complex task completion. The chief programmer team works best for tasks that are simpler and straightforward since the flow of information in the team is limited. Individuals that work in this team structure typically report lower work morale.  Shared workstation teams  Pair programming = A development technique where two programmers work together at one workstation. = Mob programming = A software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer.  Programming Models  Programming models allow software development teams to develop, deploy, and test projects using these different methodologies.  Waterfall Model  The waterfall model, noted as the more traditional approach, is a linear model of production. The sequence of events of this methodology follows as: # Gather and document requirements # Design # Code and unit test # Perform system testing # Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) # Fix any issues # Deliver the finished product Each stage is distinct during the software development process, and each stage generally finishes before the next one can begin. Programming teams using this model are able to design the project early on in the development process allowing teams to focus on coding and testing during the bulk of the work instead of constantly reiterating design. This also allows teams to design completely and more carefully so that teams can have a complete understanding of all software deliverables.  Agile Model  The Agile development model is a more team-based approach to development than the previous waterfall model. Teams work in rapid delivery/deployment which splits work into phases called \\"sprints\\". Sprints are usually defined as two weeks of planned software deliverables given to each team/team member. After each sprint, work is reprioritized and the information learned from the previous sprint is used for future sprint planning. As the sprint work is complete, it can be reviewed and evaluated by the programming team and sent back for another iteration (i.e. next sprint) or closed if completed. The general principles of the Agile Manifesto are as follows: * Satisfy the customer and continually develop software. * Changing requirements are embraced for the customer's competitive advantage. * Concentrate on delivering working software frequently. Delivery preference will be placed on the shortest possible time span. * Developers and business people must work together throughout the entire project. * Projects must be based on people who are motivated. Give them the proper environment and the support that they need. They should be trusted to get their jobs done. * Face-to-face communication is the best way to transfer information to and from a team. * Working software is the primary measurement of progress. * Agile processes will promote development that is sustainable. Sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain an indefinite, constant pace. * Constant attention to technical excellence and good design will enhance agility. * Simplicity is considered to be the art of maximizing the work that is not done, and it is essential. * Self-organized teams usually create the best designs. * At regular intervals, the team will reflect on how to become more effective, and they will tune and adjust their behavior accordingly.

The term Abuse Case is an adaptation of use case. The term was introduced by John McDermott and Chris Fox in 1999, while working at Computer Science Department of the James Madison University. As defined by its authors, an abuse case is a type of complete interaction between a system and one or more actors, where the results of the interaction are harmful to the system, one of the actors, or one of the stakeholders in the system. We cannot define completeness just in terms of coherent transactions between actors and the system. Instead, we must define abuse in terms of interactions that result in actual harm. A complete abuse case defines an interaction between an actor and the system that results in harm to a resource associated with one of the actors, one of the stakeholders, or the system itself. Their notation appears to be similar to Misuse cases, but there are differences reported by Chun Wei in Misuse Cases and Abuse Cases in Eliciting Security Requirements.Chun Wei (Johnny), Sia, Misuse Cases and Abuse Cases in Eliciting Security Requirements, http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/compsci725s2c/archive/termpapers/csia.pdf  Overview  Use cases specify required behaviour of software and other products under development, and are essentially structured stories or scenarios detailing the normal behavior and usage of the software. Abuse cases extend the UML notation to model abuse in those systems. Area of use Abuse cases are most commonly used in the field of security requirements elicitation. Basic concepts An abuse case diagram is created together with a corresponding use case diagram, but not in the same diagram (different from Misuse case). There is no new terminology or special symbols introduced for abuse case diagrams. They are drawn with the same symbols as a use case diagram. To distinguish between the two, the use case diagram and abuse case diagrams are kept separate, and related. Hence abuse cases do not appear in the use case diagrams and vice versa.

Typically the egg cell is not released or picked up at ovulation, but fertilized within the ovary where the pregnancy implants. Such a pregnancy usually does not proceed past the first four weeks of pregnancy. An untreated ovarian pregnancy causes potentially fatal intra-abdominal bleeding and thus may become a medical emergency. Cause and pathology The cause of ovarian pregnancy is unknown, specifically as the usual causative factors – pelvic inflammatory disease and pelvic surgery – implicated in tubal ectopic pregnancy seem to be uninvolved. There appears to be a link to the intrauterine device (IUD), however, it cannot be concluded that this is causative as it could be that IUDs prevent other but not ovarian pregnancies. Some have suggested that patients who undergo IVF therapy are at higher risk for ovarian pregnancy. An ovarian pregnancy is usually understood to begin when a mature egg cell is not expelled or picked up from its follicle and a sperm enters the follicle and fertilizes the egg, giving rise to an intrafollicular pregnancy. It has also been debated that an egg cell fertilized outside of the ovary could implant on the ovarian surface, perhaps aided by a decidual reaction or endometriosis. Ovarian pregnancies rarely go longer than 4 weeks; nevertheless, there is the possibility that the trophoblast finds further support outside the ovary and thus may affect the tube and other organs. In very rare occasions the pregnancy may find a sufficient foothold outside the ovary to continue as an abdominal pregnancy, and an occasional delivery has been reported. Diagnosis The diagnosis is made in asymptomatic pregnant women by obstetric ultrasonography. On pelvic examination a unilateral adnexal mass may be found. Typical symptoms are abdominal pain and, to a lesser degree, vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. Patients may present with hypovolemia or be in circulatory shock because of internal bleeding. Ideally, ultrasound will show the location of the gestational sac in the ovary, while the uterine cavity is \\"empty\\", and if there is internal bleeding, it can be identified. Because of the proximity of the tube, the sonographic distinction between a tubal and an ovarian pregnancy may be difficult. Serial hCG levels generally show not the normal progressive rise. In a series of 12 patients the mean gestation age was 45 days. Histologically, the diagnosis has been made by Spiegelberg criteria on the surgical specimen of the removed ovary and tube. However, the tube and ovary are not usually removed as sonography allows for earlier diagnosis and surgeons strive to preserve the ovary. Prior to the introduction of Spiegelberg's criteria in 1878, the existence of ovarian pregnancy was in doubt; his criteria helped to identify the ovarian pregnancy from other ectopics: * The gestational sac is located in the region of the ovary. * The gestational sac is attached to the uterus by the ovarian ligament. * Ovarian tissue is histologically proven in the wall of the gestational sac. * The oviduct on the affected side is intact (this criterion, however, holds not true for a longer ongoing ovarian pregnancy). An ovarian pregnancy can be mistaken for a tubal pregnancy or a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst or corpus luteum prior to surgery. Sometimes, only the presence of trophoblastic tissue during the histologic examination of material of a bleeding ovarian cyst shows that an ovarian pregnancy was the cause of the bleeding. Management Ovarian pregnancies are dangerous and prone to internal bleeding. Thus, when suspected, intervention is called for. Traditionally, an explorative laparotomy was performed, and once the ovarian pregnancy was identified, an oophorectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy was performed, including the removal of the pregnancy. Today, the surgery can often be performed via laparoscopy. The extent of surgery varies according to the amount of tissue destruction that has occurred. Patients with an ovarian pregnancy have a good prognosis for future fertility and therefore conservative surgical management is advocated. Further, in attempts to preserve ovarian tissue, surgery may involve just the removal of the pregnancy with only a part of the ovary. This can be accomplished by an ovarian wedge resection. Ovarian pregnancies have been successfully treated with methotrexate since it was introduced in the management of ectopic pregnancy in 1988. An ovarian pregnancy can develop together with a normal intrauterine pregnancy; such a heterotopic pregnancy will call for expert management as not to endanger the intrauterine pregnancy. Epidemiology Ovarian pregnancies are rare: the vast majority of ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube; only about 0.15-3% of ectopics occur in the ovary. The incidence has been reported to be about 1:3,000 to 1:7,000 deliveries. History In 1614 Mercier (also shown as Mercerus) described ovarian pregnancy for the first time, as a condition separate from a tubal pregnancy. Once the study of physiology emerged, Boehmer classified extra- uterine pregnancy into three classes: abdominal, ovarian, and tubal. There were many doubters that such a condition existed, particularly Mayer, who wrote an essay not only denying the existence of ovarian pregnancy, but demonstrating that recorded cases to that time were other conditions. Then Cohnstein proposed four criteria that would need to be present for ovarian pregnancy exist. His requirements were: 1) absence of the ovary on the side in which the alleged pregnancy was located; 2) connection of the uterus and sac via an ovarian ligament; 3) cylindrical tissue must line the layers of the sac with direct connection between the tunica albuginea and sac wall; and 4) evidence of the amniotic cavity connection to the ovarian follicle or corpus luteum. These were replaced by Otto Spiegelberg's criteria in 1878, which have been used into the 20th century with additions and modifications. Up to 1845, about 80 cases of ovarian pregnancy were proposed. With Mayer's 1845 denial that ovarian pregnancy could exist, physicians began taking more care in their descriptions and analysis of cases. Though numerous cases were evaluated, some failed to provide microscopic evidence and others failed to show the necessary histological changes of pregnancy, or failed on one or more of the criteria. In 1899, Catharine van Tussenbroek finally settled the question of the existence of ovarian pregnancy, by providing the first accurate clinical and histological description of a case. Though doubted, her results were confirmed three years later in a case by Thompson.

It is one of the most well known among ~150 species of Millettia, as it is widely used in traditional practices, such as for poisoning fish, agricultural pesticide, blood tonic, and treatments of cancer and infertility. The bark fiber is used for making strong ropes. It is endemic to south-east Asian region including Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. In India it is found only in the eastern region such as Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura and West Bengal. Description M. pachycarpa is a climbing shrub. It has dark brown inflated legumes that are densely covered with rough pale yellow warts. The leguminous pods contain one to five dark brown reniform seeds. The leaves have 13 to 17 papery leaflets and the flowers are lilac-colored. Rachis are , including petiole . Leaflet blades are elliptic-oblong to lanceolate-oblong, base cuneate to rounded, apex acute. Legume dark brown, oblong or when 1-seeded ovoid, inflated, densely covered with pale yellow warts. Pseudora cemes with two to six branches beneath new stems, , brown tomentose; rachis nodes with two to five flowers clustered on a spur. Traditional uses=Fish poison Among the tribal natives of north-east India and Tsou people of Taiwan, the juice extract of the crushed root and seed are widely used as fish poison in traditional fishing; and hence the common name 'fish poison climber'.Hiroshi Y (2000). Segawa's Illustrated Ethnography of Indigenous Formosan People: The Tsou. SMC Publishing Inc., Taipei, Taiwan. Lalchhandama K (2010). Pharmacology of Some Traditional Anthelmintic Plants: Biochemical and Microscopic Studies. LAP Lambert Academic Publishing, Germany. The natives smash the plant parts against rocks, and let the juice extract run into the water. Fishes are easily stupefied and subsequently paralyzed. Then they are collected by hands or nets or baskets. Traditional medicine It is used in traditional Chinese medicine as a blood tonic and to induce the growth of red blood cells and as cancer therapy in a preparation called 'Jixueteng'. The crushed concoction of M. pachycarpa leaves are used by some native tribals of north-east India, and the root bark is also directly eaten for treating intestinal infection. Insecticide The finely ground seeds are prepared in suspension which is widely used in Chinese traditional medicine as insecticide against insect pests. A 5% water suspension of the seeds is as effective as 0.1 % benzene hexachloride spray when used against the ten-spotted grape leaf-beetle, Oides decempunctata; and also more potent than phenothiazine against the fifth-instar small white butterfly, Pieris rapae. The dried powder of the root is also effective against bean aphids, silkworm and Mexican bean beetle.Prakash A, Rao J (1997). Botanical Pesticides in Agriculture. CRC-Press, pp. 229–230. Isolation of rotenone and other rotenoids from the root leaves no doubt for its insecticidal property as these compounds are well established insecticides.  Chemical constituents  A number of chemical compounds have been isolated from M. pachycarpa including several prenylflavonoids, dihydroflanonols, and chalconoids from the seed, rotenoids such as rotenone, cis-12a-hydroxyretenone, rot-2′-enonic acid and cis-12a-hydroxyrot-2′-enonic acid from the root, and barbigerone. Several chemical analyses have yielded a number of novel prenylated isoflavones including erysenegalensein E, euchrenone b10, isoerysenegalensein E, 6,8-diprenylorobol, furowanin A and B, millewanins F, G and H, warangalone, and auriculasin from the leaves. The major flavonoid component of the stem was found to be auriculasin (6). In addition, terpenoids such as epifriedinol and friedelin, and steroids (phytosterols) such as campesterol, β-sitosterol and stigmasterol are also identified from the stem and leaf.Southon IW, Bisby FA (1994).

First published in his 1978 Brunonia article \\"A taxonomic revision of the genus Adenanthos (Proteaceae)\\", it superseded the arrangement of George Bentham, which had stood for over a hundred years. It was updated by Nelson in his 1995 treatment for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. Background Adenanthos is a genus of around 30 species in the plant family Proteaceae. Endemic to southern Australia, they are evergreen woody shrubs with solitary flowers that are pollinated by birds and, if fertilised, develop into achenes. They are not much cultivated. Common names of species often include one of the terms woollybush, jugflower and stick-in-the-jug. The first known botanical collection of Adenanthos was made by Archibald Menzies during the September 1791 visit of the Vancouver Expedition to King George Sound on the south coast of Western Australia. However this did not lead to publication of the genus. Jacques Labillardière collected specimens of A. cuneatus from Esperance Bay the following year, and in 1803 Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour collected the same two species as Menzies had 12 years earlier. Labillardière published the genus in 1805, in his Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen, based on the specimens collected by himself and Leschenault. The genus was given the name Adenanthos from the Greek αδην (aden-, \\"gland\\") and ανθοσz (-anthos, \\"flower\\"), in reference to the prominent nectaries. By 1870, 13 species had been published. That year, Bentham published a fourteenth species and the first infrageneric arrangement, dividing the genus into two taxonomic sections, A. sect. Eurylaema and A. sect. Stenolaema, based on the shape of the perianth tube: members of A. sect. Eurylaema have perianth tubes that are curved and swollen above the middle, whereas members of A. sect. Stenolaena have perianth tubes that are straight and unswollen. This arrangement stood for over a hundred years, by which time a number of new species had been discovered, rendering Bentham's treatment \\"very inadequate and incomplete\\". Nelson's arrangement Nelson's arrangement of Adenanthos was first published in his article \\"A taxonomic revision of the genus Adenanthos (Proteaceae)\\", published in Brunonia in 1978. Eight new species and 4 new subspecies were published, bringing the number of species up to 32. In naming them, Nelson follows Labillardière in treating Adenanthos as having feminine gender, despite an ICBN recommendation (not rule) that names ending in -anthos be treated as masculine. Bentham's two sections are retained, but several additional diagnostic characteristics are given for them; and, in accordance with modern rules of botanical nomenclature, A. sect. Stenolaema is renamed to the autonym A. sect. Adenanthos. This Nelson further divides into two subsections, A. subsect. Anaclastos and A. subsect. Adenanthos. Detailed descriptions of each are given, but Nelson recommends perianth length as the most convenient key for distinguishing between them. Nelson's subsections were discarded by him in his 1995 treatment of Adenanthos for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. He retained the two sections, and listed 40 species. Masculine names were used in accordance with a 1994 ICBN ruling. The full arrangement is as follows: A. obovatus A. cygnorum foliage :Adenanthos ::A. sect.

RemoteFX was first introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and is based on intellectual property that Microsoft acquired and continued to develop since acquiring Calista Technologies. It is a part of the overall Remote Desktop Services workload.  History = Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1  RemoteFX components introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 include: * RemoteFX vGPU: the ability to present a virtualized instance of a physical GPU into multiple Windows 7 virtual machines. This provides VMs with access to the physical GPU, enabling hardware-acceleration for rich graphics scenarios such as 3D rendering and game play. * RemoteFX USB Redirection: generalized support for redirecting USB devices into Windows 7 VMs. This allows peripheral devices connected to thin client terminals to be used within virtual machines. * RemoteFX Codec (also referred to as RemoteFX Calista Codec): a lossy codec that is capable of preserving a high-fidelity experience for both video and text. The RemoteFX Codec does not require any special hardware, and uses the CPU for encoding.  Windows Server 2012  In Windows Server 2012, the following components were added to RemoteFX. * RemoteFX Adaptive Graphics: The RemoteFX graphics pipeline dynamically adapts to various runtime conditions, such as graphic content types, CPU and network bandwidth availability, and client rendering speed. * RemoteFX for WAN: a series of changes to the network transport pipeline to support UDP and ensure a fluid experience in both WAN and wireless network configurations. * RemoteFX Multi-Touch: supports remoting of gestures (e.g. pinch and zoom) between the client and host with up to 256 touch points * RemoteFX Media Redirection API: allows Voice over IP (VoIP) applications to natively integrate with RemoteFX, and enables transmission and rendering of audio and video content directly on the client side. * Choice of GPU: All RemoteFX features can be used with either a software-emulated GPU, which is available by default in all virtual machines and session hosts, or they can benefit from hardware acceleration when a physical video card is placed in the server and the RemoteFX vGPU is enabled. In addition, the following components were updated: * RemoteFX vGPU: updated to support DirectX 11 * RemoteFX USB Redirection: updated to support all desktop remoting scenarios vGPU-enabled virtual machines, traditional VMs, desktop sessions and physical desktop hosts * RemoteFX Codec (also referred to as RemoteFX Progressive Calista Codec): updated to include progressive rendering, which is more effective for rendering content over the WAN by sending images at full resolution only if bandwidth permits.  Windows Server 2016, Windows 10 Enterprise  In Windows Server 2016 (RDP 10), the following components were added to RemoteFX. * OpenGL 4.4 and OpenCL 1.1 API support in a virtual machine with the RemoteFX adapter * More dedicated VRAM for the RemoteFX adapter * Various performance improvements in transport and API implementations RemoteFX Media Streaming (H.264) replaced Multi Media Redirection (MMR). Note: MMR is now completely removed from RDP 10 given that RemoteFX Media Streaming works for all types of video content whereas MMR which just worked for some.  Requirements  In Windows Server 2008 R2, the RemoteFX Codec could be leveraged for both session hosting (Remote Desktop Session Hosts) and VDI scenarios (and Remote Desktop Virtualization Hosts). The RemoteFX vGPU and RemoteFX USB Redirection features could only be used in VDI scenarios (Remote Desktop Virtualization Hosts). Windows 10 version 1511 brings RemoteFX to client Hyper-V, removing dependency on Remote Desktop Services role. Generation 2 VMs on Windows Server 2012 R2 do not support RemoteFX. Windows Server 2016 added such support. In Windows Server 2012, all features of RemoteFX (with the exception of the vGPU) can be used with or without a physical GPU present in the server. When no GPU is present in the server, a synthetic software-emulated GPU is used to render content. When a GPU is present in the server, it can be used to hardware accelerate the graphics via the RemoteFX vGPU feature.  RemoteFX vGPU Requirements  The RemoteFX vGPU has the following requirements: * Hyper-V must be installed on the server. The VMs must be created and run using Hyper-V. * The server's CPU must support Second Level Address Translation (SLAT), and have it enabled. * For Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, at least one DirectX 9.0c and 10.0 capable graphics card must be installed on the server. * For Windows Server 2012, at least one DirectX 11.0 capable graphics card with a WDDM 1.2 driver must be installed on the server. * The host machine must not be a Domain Controller. For single server configuration, Microsoft supports running Domain Controller as a Hyper-V virtual machine. Windows Server 2008 R2 with SP1 has been tested for up to twelve virtual machines per GPU, for a total of twenty-four virtual machines on two physical GPUs. Although any GPU meeting the above requirements will be capable of using RemoteFX, the Windows Server Catalog carries an additional qualification to further define the requirements for server-qualified GPUs. These specifications define GPUs configuration requirements and provide VM performance targets. Graphics cards that meet these are typically professional workstation products such as ATI/AMD's FirePro, v5800, v5900, v7800, v7900, v8800, v9800, and Nvidia's Quadro 2000, 3800, 4000, 4800, 5000, 5800, 6000, Quadro FX 2800M and 880M, QuadroPlex 7000 and Tesla M2070Q. Servers running the RemoteFX vGPU need to accommodate such graphics cards with either larger power supplies and more PCIe slots or alternatively connect existing servers to an external PCIe expansion chassis.  Guest OS requirements  The RemoteFX virtual graphics adapter is only supported by Enterprise editions of Windows, starting from Windows 7 SP1. Other editions are missing the required drivers to use the RemoteFX graphics adapter and will fall back to the default emulated graphics adapter instead.

This damage and its negative consequences have been well documented and include increased fuel use, poor seedbeds, reduced crop yields and poor soil function in terms of water infiltration, drainage and greenhouse gas mitigation due to soil compaction. Controlled traffic farming is a system which confines all machinery loads to the least possible area of permanent traffic lanes. Current farming systems allow machines to run at random over the land, compacting around 75% of the area within one season and the whole area by the second season. Soils don’t recover quickly, taking as much as a few years (e.g., >5 years, particularly in soils without swelling-shrinking properties). A proper CTF system on the other hand can reduce tracking to just 15% and this is always in the same place. CTF is a tool; it does not include a prescription for tillage although most growers adopting CTF use little or none because soil structure does not need to be repaired. The permanent traffic lanes are normally parallel to each other and this is the most efficient way of achieving CTF, but the definition does not preclude tracking at an angle. The permanent traffic lanes may be cropped or non-cropped depending on a wide range of variables and local constraints. Achieving controlled traffic farming Controlled traffic farming can be achieved on any scale but to get tracked areas to the minimum possible, there are three requirements: * To match implement widths so that adjacent passes are in the same place for all machines working in the field. * To match the track widths (the distance between wheel centres on the same axle) of all field machinery. * To keep machines in exactly the same place year in year out. Matching implement widths is a case of forward planning, or making sure that if anything doesn’t match now, its replacement will. It’s also the case that the wider the implements are, the less will be the tracked area. Growers often find they can use wider machines because without soil damage, they are easier to pull and in the case of cultivators, most likely don’t need to work anywhere near as deep. Matching track widths is more difficult because grain harvesters often come with a track of 3 m or more and matching to these would make all machines very wide and often impractical to use on a daily basis. Matching to the harvester track works well in Australia where properties are often remote, there is plenty of space and road travel may not be too extensive. In other parts to the world, including most of Europe, alternatives have been found. These may not be quite as efficient in minimising the tracked area, but achieving less than 20% is still perfectly feasible. In controlled traffic farming systems for vegetable cropping, track widths vary between 1.83 m (the 72” imperial standard) to customised systems of perhaps 3.2 m or more. Road transport with these wide systems can be difficult but their use in the Netherlands and Denmark is increasing and growers accept the constraints because of the advantages that the systems bring. Keeping machines in exactly the same place is most easily achieved with a satellite guidance system based on an RTK correction signal and auto-steer. Only the RTK system can guarantee to keep vehicles in the same place year in year out and it also achieves the highest pass to pass accuracy of around ± 2 cm. Guidance systems have many other advantages and once a system of this nature has been adopted, the natural progression is to move to controlled traffic farming. The generic advantages of guidance include much reduced overlap between passes of machines, particularly of wide cultivators which may overlap by around 10%. Although planters and drills use physical markers to match up between one pass and the next, cumulative errors can be large and non-cropped tracks created by these machines (tramlines) for chemical applications can often have an overlap of 5%. The implications of this are significant because tramlines are used for all chemical applications. A 5% overlap wastes the equivalent in increasingly expensive materials and through overdosing, damages crops and could lead to extra run-off and diffuse pollution. Advantages The main advantages are: *improved crop yields, particularly in seasons with extreme dry or wet *lower inputs for crop establishment, which: **reduce fuel use **reduce power demand meaning smaller tractors to do the same job **improve timeliness of operations *better soil health and function, which: **improves soil porosity meaning there is more space for water and air; **improves water infiltration which reduces the potential for soil erosion and increases water availability to the crop; **improves drainage which avoids waterlogging and the potential for nitrous oxide and methane emissions and methane oxidation. **improves crop rooting and the efficiency of nutrient uptake, leading to less waste and potential for environmental pollution. *improves field access, particularly when soil moisture is high. Field operations are often needed in less than ideal conditions and when carried out, can cause extensive damage. Controlled traffic farming provides a firmer base for these operations (the permanent tracks) and constrains the damage to narrow strips. Disadvantages More discipline is required in the field, and can increase journey times when removing large volumes of material, such as sugar beet or potatoes. There is greater reliance on technology in the form of satellite guidance and auto- steer. If a machine is in a state of disrepair, an exact replacement with a matching track or implement width may not be available. The cutting width of grain harvesters for example, seldom match up to cultivator or drill widths. More demand and time could solve this issue. Once a field has been laid out with a controlled traffic farming system, it is not advantageous to change it. However, it is not impossible because only around 20% of the field may be compacted and the position of these strips is known. Future Although controlled traffic farming is still in its infancy as far as adoption is concerned (partially because the enabling technology of satellite guidance is still relatively new), there is a better engineering solution that would reduce tracked areas to less than 10%. This is not a recent concept, having been pioneered by Alexander Halkett in the 1850s and David Dowler in the 1970s, but the concept of a wide span vehicle is becoming increasingly attractive because of the other advantages it brings. The concept is described in detail at controlled traffic farming Europe's wide span page and achieves the low tracked area by virtue of using one of the same wheel tracks on adjacent passes. The system also reduces reliance on satellite technology because a guiding wheel track for the next pass is automatically laid down. With implements mostly contained within its wheel track, part width operations, for example ploughing or root crop harvesting, are perfectly feasible, whereas with existing tractor systems they are not.

It is native to much of North America, including central and eastern Canada and most of the contiguous United States except for the southwestern and southeastern regions. Its distribution extends into Mexico. It is also present on other continents as an introduced species.Spartina pectinata. Grass Manual Treatment. Description This grass has hard, sturdy, hollow stems that may reach in height. They grow from a network of woody rhizomes and tough roots that form a sod. The roots penetrate over into the soil. The leaves have sharp, serrated edges.Spartina pectinata. USDA NRCS Plant Fact Sheet. The panicle may be up to long and may have many branches. Each spikelet is up to in length. This grass can spread via its rhizome, producing large monotypic stands. Habitat and ecology This plant can grow in a variety of habitat types, but it is a facultative wetland species, most often found in wet habitats. These include fens, wet prairies, rivers, floodplains, ponds, moraines, and marshes. The grass is tolerant of water, but it does not tolerate prolonged flooding. Its dense root network stabilizes soil, even in areas where it would be eroded by flowing water. The larvae of Photedes inops host on Spartina pectinata, apparently exclusively. Uses Livestock may graze on this plant when it is young, but once it matures it becomes very coarse and unpalatable. This species has been investigated as a possible source of biofuel.Goudarzi, S.

In the United States pre-packs are often used in a Chapter 11 filing. In the United Kingdom, pre-packs have become popular since the Enterprise Act 2002, which has made administration the dominant insolvency procedure. Such arrangements are also available in Canada under the Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act. United Kingdom The term \\"pre-pack sale\\" has been defined by the Association of Business Recovery Professionals as \\"an arrangement under which the sale of all or part of a company’s business or assets is negotiated with a purchaser prior to the appointment of an administrator, and the administrator effects the sale immediately on, or shortly after, his appointment\\".http://www.r3.org.uk/media/documents/technical_library/SIPS/SIP%2016%20E&W.pdf; The difference between a pre-pack sale and a normal sale is that in a normal sale the administrator markets the business and negotiates the terms of the sale after his appointment. The reasons an administrator sells on a pre-pack basis, rather than after post-appointment marketing, vary from case to case, but they often involve the following considerations. A pre-pack sale avoids the costs of trading (which means creditors receive more back), and indeed, the company and the administrator may not have the funds to trade. It also avoids the administrator taking on the risks associated with trading. The value of the business may deteriorate during administration trading. There may be other factors to prevent trading, such as regulatory problems.see, for example, Re DKLL Solicitors [2007] EWHC 2067 (Ch), http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2007/2067.html for consideration of these issues The courts have held that an administrator can sell the company's assets immediately upon his appointment, without court approval or the approval of the creditors,Re T&D; Industries Plc [2000] 1 WLR 646; Re Transbus International Limited [2004] 1 WLR 2654 and he can do so even if the majority creditor objects.Re DKLL Solicitors [2007] EWHC 2067 (Ch), http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2007/2067.html Courts have even approved transactions that, as a \\"necessary evil\\", have made payments to the former management while leaving little or nothing to unsecured creditors.Re Halliwells LLP [2010] EWHC 2036 (Ch) at para 20 http://www.bailii.org/cgi- bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2010/2036.html&query;=halliwells+and+LLP&method;=boolean In January 2009, the Association of Business Recovery Professionals issued Statement of Insolvency Practice 16 to require insolvency practitioners acting as administrators to disclose a number of matters to all creditors as soon as possible after the completion of the sale. This was done in an attempt to provide greater transparency to creditors. On 1 November 2013, following a government-commissioned review, a new Statement of Insolvency Practice 16 was introduced. It requires administrators to disclose the following:http://lucasjohnson.co.uk/statement-of-insolvency-practice-16.pdf *The source of the administrator’s initial introduction and the date of the introduction *The extent of the administrator’s involvement prior to appointment *The alternative courses of action that were considered by the administrator, with an explanation of possible financial outcomes *Whether efforts were made to consult with major creditors *Why it was not appropriate to trade the business and offer it for sale as a going concern, during the administration *Details of requests made to potential funders to fund working capital requirements *Details of registered charges and dates of creation *If the business or business assets have been acquired from an insolvency practitioner within the previous 24 months, or longer if the administrator deems that relevant to creditors’ understanding, the administrator should disclose both the details of that transaction and whether the administrator, administrator’s firm or associates were involved *Any marketing activities conducted by the company and/or the administrator and the outcome of those activities *The names and professional qualifications of any valuers and confirmation they have confirmed their independence *Any valuations obtained of the business or the underlying assets *A summary of the basis of the valuation adopted by the administrator or his valuers/advisers *The rationale for the basis of the valuations obtained and an explanation of the sale of the assets compared to those valuations. If no valuation has been obtained, the reason for not having done so and how the administrator was satisfied as to the value of the assets *The date of the transaction *The identity of the purchaser *Any connection between the purchaser and the directors, shareholders or secured creditors of the company or their associates *The names of any directors, or former directors, of the company who are involved in the management or ownership of the purchaser, or of any other entity into which any of the assets are transferred *In transactions impacting on more than one related company (e.g. a group transaction) the administrator should ensure that the disclosure is sufficient to enable a transparent explanation (for instance, allocation of consideration paid) *Whether any directors had given guarantees for amounts due from the company to a prior financier, and whether that financier is financing the new business *Details of the assets involved and the nature of the transaction *The consideration for the transaction, terms of payment, and any condition of the contract that could materially affect the consideration *Sale consideration disclosed under broad asset valuation categories and split between fixed and floating charge realisations *Any options, buy-back arrangements or similar conditions attached to the contract of sale *If the sale is part of a wider transaction, a description of the other aspects of the transaction. The main benefit of a pre-pack administration is the 'continuity' of the business - the company is protected by the court. This gets rid of debts and contracts. It does not get rid of employees due to the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (TUPE). Another big advantage is that the cost of the process is lower than trading administration, as the administrators do not need to find funding to trade the business. The downside of a pre-pack administration is that it can attract negative publicity if the former directors are seen to be shedding liabilities. The Insolvency Service monitors compliance with SIP 16. Its reports show that in 2010 it reported 10 insolvency practitioners to their licensing bodies, and in 2011 it reported 21. United States In the United States, typically the term pre-packaged bankruptcy is used instead of pre-packaged insolvency. A conventional bankruptcy case is one in which the debtor files for Chapter 11 relief without having agreed in advance to the terms of a plan of reorganization with its creditors. During the course of the Chapter 11 case, the debtor or, if the debtor does not retain the exclusive right to propose a plan, a creditor or creditor group may formulate and propose a plan of reorganization. A company undergoing Chapter 11 reorganization is effectively operating under the protection of the court until it emerges. An example is the airline industry; in 2006, over half the industry's seating capacity was on airlines that were in Chapter 11. In a pre-packaged case, the plan proponents will have secured sufficient support from creditors to confirm their plan of reorganization prior to filing for Chapter 11 reorganization. Pre-packaged plans of reorganization virtually always impair (i.e. pay less than in full) one or more classes of creditors, and so in order to ensure that the plan can be confirmed by the bankruptcy court, the plan proponents must secure the support of at least two-thirds in amount and more than one-half in number of at least one such impaired class, in addition to ensuring the plan complies with all other requirements for confirmation. Two procedurally difficult aspects of the process are the announcement (which must be structured so as not to trigger contractual termination provisions) and getting the requisite creditor approval. In 2009, a new entity completed the purchase of continuing operations, assets and trademarks of General Motors as a part of the 'pre- packaged' Chapter 11 reorganization.Stoll, John D., and Neil King Jr. (July 10, 2009).GM Emerges From Bankruptcy.The Wall Street Journal. Retrieved on July 10, 2009. As ranked by total assets, GM's bankruptcy marks one of the largest corporate Chapter 11 bankruptcies in US history. The Chapter 11 filing was the fourth-largest in US history, following Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Washington Mutual and WorldCom Inc. A new entity with the backing of the United States Treasury was formed to acquire profitable assets, under section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, with the new company planning to issue an initial public offering (IPO) of stock in 2010.Stoll, John D., and David McLaughlin (July 2, 2009).General Motors Aims for IPO Next Year.The Wall Street Journal. Retrieved on July 10, 2009. The remaining pre-petition creditors claims are paid from the former corporation's assets. Criticism A review from Wolverhampton University identified the several criticisms of pre-pack sales. There is a general concern that the pre-pack administrator, in agreeing to the pre-pack in consultation with the company’s management team (and usually its secured creditors), favours the interests of the managers and secured creditors ahead of those of the unsecured creditors. The speed and secrecy of the transaction often lead to a deal being executed, about which the unsecured creditors know nothing and offers them little or no return. There is often a suspicion that the consideration paid for the business may not have been maximized due to the absence of open marketing. Credit may have been incurred inappropriately prior to the pre-pack and this may not be fully investigated.\\"When is pre-packaged administration appropriate?\\"http://www.ntu.ac.uk/nls/document_uploads/112698.pdf Criticism of this nature had been levelled at pre-pack sales by John Moulton of Alchemy Partners in January 2009, saying 'Pre-packs could be very easily abused. Bad management can plan for a prepack months in advance, line up an administrator – and then be back running the business immediately. It means when retailers fail they are often being kept with the same directors when it would be much healthier if new management arrived and with fresh money to invest\\".

Plot Raj is the only son of the rich man Seth Gopal Das. His childhood and teenage years were very lonely as his mother died when he was a child. Raj starts drinking in his adulthood and also gradually distances himself from his father. Raj starts living in a palatial bungalow, in the same city where Seth Gopal Das has his residence. Raj occasionally comes to the residence, the main bungalow where Seth Gopal Das lives. On a trip to a snowy mountain, Raj gets to meet a girl named Rupa. He protects Rupa from entering into the flesh trade. Then he decides to drop her to her home, but due to the bad condition of the roads he is forced to stay in a cottage with her. As the weather becomes cold, Raj develops shivering and to protect him, Rupa decides to blow air from her mouth into his and embrace him. By doing this, she manages to revive him. In the morning, Raj says she should have not done such a thing for his well-being in the night. Rupa says, she was grateful to him as he had saved her from being forced to sell her body, so she didn't mind doing what she eventually did. Hearing this, Raj becomes happy and inquires whom she lives with; she says she is alone in that area as she has to send money to her dad in distant village. Raj asks her whether she would like to stay with him and then she agrees to join him. Also while being in love with Raj, Rupa makes him promise her that he won't take to drinking with her being in his life. After he reaches his home, he gets to meet Bihari and comes to know that Bihari has come on his father's order, to take him to his father's residence as some guests are going to arrive. Raj agrees to come in the evening for dinner and there he notices that his father has fixed his engagement with another girl. Raj comes to know that Gopal Das fixed the marriage with the daughter of Jamuna Das, as he was going to get huge amount in the form of a dowry for his son's wedding and he is in dire need of money, thanks to the incident of one of his ships sinking in the sea and that it was not covered by an insurance policy taken by Gopal's company. Raj disagrees to marry Jamuna Das' daughter. Bihari discloses to Gopal Das that the reason for Raj's refusing to marry the girl of his choice is because Raj has brought a girl to his house and is interested in marrying her. Gopal Das decides to meet Rupa personally and he tells about the financial problem he is into and how Raj's marriage with the girl of his choice would help both him and Raj. Gopal asks Rupa whether she is not more concerned about Raj's welfare and if she is, then she should not marry him and convince him to marry the other girl. Rupa convinces Raj to get married and then herself, after the wedding, commits suicide. Raj becomes disillusioned but hides the facts about Rupa to his wife. He is sad and angry at his father for doing all this. But keeping with the promise he gave to Rupa, he has a good married life with his wife. His wife soon becomes pregnant and gives birth to a boy. Due to birth complications, she dies. Now Raj takes to drinking. Raj also arranges for a statue to be built in memory of Rupa in his bungalow and shifts to residence of his dad permanently. Gopal, fed up with Raj's drinking behaviour sends the little baby boy to abroad for his schooling and college. 18 years pass by. Raj has started drinking heavily. Meanwhile, one dark night, accidentally due to heavy rains, a girl comes to Raj's residential home for help to stay in his house for one day. Raj observes the girl and realises that she looks same as Rupa. She calls herself Deepa and Raj allows her stay in his house for the night. Deepa leaves his home early in the morning, forgetting her purse. Raj goes to the address mentioned in her card available in the purse, to return it to her. Deepa is a club dancer and earns by performing in that hotel. Raj starts frequenting the hotel more often. This news spreads and reaches Gopal. Although 18 years have passed since Rupa's death, Raj has still not forgiven his father. So Bihari suggests to Gopal that Deepa, being a lookalike of Rupa should be married out to Raj. So Gopal to resurrect Raj's boring lonely life decides to ask Deepa her consent. But even before he could enter her room, he overhears a conversation between Deepa and her friend about how she has fooled Raj and how Raj has become a frequent visitor of Deepa. After hearing this he becomes reluctant to marry off Raj to Deepa. But the same day, Gopal dies a sudden death. Within a few days Raj's son Vijay returns to India and joins his family business of shipping. Vijay falls in love with Barkha on a business trip to Kashmir. Vijay decides that in future he would marry Barkha only. But on realising that his dad is very sad and on learning that Raj is in love with Deepa, Vijay decides to declare a marriage of Deepa and his father Raj. Deepa agrees to marry Raj only on the condition that she would be declared owner of all assets of Gopaldas and Vijay's share be transferred to her. Vijay prefers to think more about his dad's well being and decides to not claim any right to property in future. Then the marriage of Raj and Deepa takes place. Deepa starts behaving indifferently with Raj and causes many embarrassing situations for Raj. When Raj questions her as to why she is behaving indecently in the house since the time they were married to each other, Deepa says that Raj has no authority to question her. After few months she becomes pregnant and starts pressuring Vijay and tells him that she would not continue with Raj and bring a bad name for family if Vijay marries off anyone and tries to become a father himself. The rest of the story is about whether Raj will allow Vijay to make such a sacrifice? Will Vijay marry Barkha? Will Deepa exploit Raj more? What is the motive of Deepa in falling in love with Raj? Will Raj stop drinking? Will Barkha agree to be not a mother after her marriage to Vijay? How long will Deepa blackmail Vijay and Viajy succumb to Deepa's demands? Will Deepa keep Raj happy in his life? Reception Critics panned the film for its bad editing and the film flopped at the box office. The music became popular Cast *Rajesh Khanna..

Civil War On June 26, 1861, Bates was commissioned captain of Company H, 12th Massachusetts. He was promoted to major on August 6, 1862 and transferred to the 33rd Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. His old regiment, the 12th Massachusetts, suffered terrible casualties during the Battle of Antietam, including the loss of its colonel, Fletcher Webster. Bates was therefore promoted to colonel on September 19, 1862 and placed in command of the 12th Massachusetts to replace Webster. While commanding the 12th, Bates was wounded during the Battle of Gettysburg. During May and June 1864, Bates commanded the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division of the V Corps. In this capacity, after the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, Bates intercepted intelligence which ultimately affected the movement of the Army of the Potomac during the Overland Campaign for which he received the thanks of Lt.

He published the first description of cirrhosis of the liver in 1685 and the first description of necrotising pancreatitis in 1684. He was also known for publishing the work of others under his name. Life Browne was brought up in Norwich, in a surgical family, being related to William Crop, a surgeon in Norfolk, but not closely related to Sir Thomas Browne whom he knew. He studied at St. Thomas's Hospital, London, under Thomas Hollyer, served as a naval surgeon, and then practised in Norwich. In 1678 Browne moved to London, and about the same time was made surgeon in ordinary to King Charles II. With the king's recommendation he became surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital, on 21 June 1683, chosen over Edward Rice who had taken charge of the hospital during the Great Plague of 1665, when other surgeons deserted their posts. In 1691 complaints arose that the surgeons did not obey the regulations of the hospital, and claimed that being appointed by royal mandamus they were not responsible to the governors. The Whig Sir Robert Clayton was then President, the governors were determined to maintain their authority, and on 7 July 1691 they dismissed the whole of their surgical staff, including Browne, and appointed others. Browne appealed to the lords commissioners of the great seal, and the governors were called upon to defend their proceedings. Browne was also surgeon to William III. In 1698 he petitioned the governors to be reinstated, though without success. Works Browne wrote: *A Treatise of Preternatural Tumours, London, 1678 (with plates). *A Complete Discourse of Wounds, London, 1678 (with plates). *Adeno-Choiradelogia, or an Anatomick- Chirurgical Treatise, London, 1684, in three parts: #Adenographia, or an Anatomical Treatise of the Glandules; #Chreradelogia, or an exact Discourse of Strumaes or King's Evil Swellings; #Charisma Basilicon, or the Royal Gift of Healing Strumaes, &c.;, by Contact or Imposition of the Sacred Hands of our Kings of England and of France. It describes the method pursued by Charles II in touching for the \\"king's evil\\", with which as the king's surgeon Browne was officially concerned. It gives statistics for the numbers of persons touched (between 1660 and 1682, reckoned as 92,107). *Myographia Nova, or a graphical description of all the Muscles in the Human Body; with one and forty copper- plates, London, 1684; 2nd ed. Lugd. Batavorum, 1687; 3rd ed. London, 1697; 4th ed. London, 1698. This treatise on the muscles consists of six lectures, illustrated by copper-plates. It was, however, plagiarised, as was pointed out by James Yonge: it put together text from the Muskotomia of William Molins with illustrations from the Tabula anatomicae of Giulio Casserius. Nevertheless, Browne's book was popular, and appeared in ten editions. *The Surgeon's Assistant, London, 1703.

While the Oxford English Dictionary offers a definition of role-playing as \\"the changing of one's behaviour to fulfill a social role\\", in the field of psychology, the term is used more loosely in four senses: * To refer to the playing of roles generally such as in a theatre, or educational setting; * To refer to taking a role of a character or person and acting it out with a partner taking someone else's role, often involving different genres of practice; * To refer to a wide range of games including role-playing video game (RPG), play-by-mail games and more; * To refer specifically to role- playing games. Amusement Many children participate in a form of role- playing known as make believe, wherein they adopt certain roles such as doctor and act out those roles in character. Sometimes make believe adopts an oppositional nature, resulting in games such as cops and robbers. Entertainment Historical re-enactment has been practiced by adults for millennia. The ancient Romans, Han Chinese, and medieval Europeans all enjoyed occasionally organizing events in which everyone pretended to be from an earlier age, and entertainment appears to have been the primary purpose of these activities. Within the 20th century historical re-enactment has often been pursued as a hobby. Improvisational theatre dates back to the Commedia dell'Arte tradition of the 16th century. Modern improvisational theatre began in the classroom with the \\"theatre games\\" of Viola Spolin and Keith Johnstone in the 1950s. Viola Spolin, who was one of the founders the famous comedy troupe Second City, insisted that her exercises were games, and that they involved role-playing as early as 1946. She accurately judged role-playing in the theatre as rehearsal and actor training, or the playing of the role of actor versus theatre roles, but many now use her games for fun in their own right. Role-playing games A role-playing game is a game in which the participants assume the roles of characters and collaboratively create stories. Participants determine the actions of their characters based on their characterisation, and the actions succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines. Within the rules, they may improvise freely; their choices shape the direction and outcome of the games. Role-playing can also be done online in the form of group story creation, involving anywhere from two to several hundred people, utilizing public forums, private message boards, mailing lists, chatrooms, and instant-messaging chat clients (e.g., MSN, Yahoo!, ICQ) to build worlds and characters that may last a few hours, or several years. Often on forum-based roleplays, rules, and standards are set up, such as a minimum word count, character applications, and \\"plotting\\" boards to increase complexity and depth of story. There are different genres of which one can choose while role-playing, including, but not limited to, fantasy, modern, medieval, steam punk, and historical. Books, movies, or games can be, and often are, used as a basis for role-plays (which in such cases may be deemed \\"collaborative fan-fiction\\"), with players either assuming the roles of established canon characters or using those the players themselves create (\\"Original Characters\\") to replace—or exist alongside—characters from the book, movie, or game, playing through well-trodden plots as alternative characters, or expanding upon the setting and story outside of its established canon.  Psychology  In psychology, an individual's personality can be conceptualized as a set of expectations about oneself and others and that these add up to role-playing or role-taking. Here, the role is fiction because it is not real but it has a degree of consistency. Role-playing is also an important part of a child's psychological development. For example, the instance when a child starts to define \\"I\\" and separate him or herself from an adult is the initial condition for and the result of role play. There are also experiments that found role-playing resulted in behavioral change such as the case of smokers who reported negative attitude towards smoking after being asked to pretend to be a person diagnosed with lung cancer. Training Interior cockpit of a twinjet flight simulator Role-playing may also refer to role training where people rehearse situations in preparation for a future performance and to improve their abilities within a role. The most common examples are occupational training role-plays, educational role-play exercises, and certain military wargames. Simulation One of the first uses of computers was to simulate real-world conditions for participants role- playing the flying of aircraft. Flight simulators used computers to solve the equations of flight and train future pilots. The army began full-time role- playing simulations with soldiers using computers both within full scale training exercises and for training in numerous specific tasks under wartime conditions. Examples include weapon firing, vehicle simulators, and control station mock-ups. Research method Role playing may also refer to the technique commonly used by researchers studying interpersonal behavior by assigning research participants to particular roles and instructing the participants to act as if a specific set of conditions were true.see: Dawn T. Robinson: Role playing, The SAGE Encyclopedia of Social Science Research Methods. This technique of assigning and taking roles in psychological research has a long history. It has been used in the early classic social psychological experiments by Kurt Lewin (1939/1997), Stanley Milgram (1963), and Phillip Zimbardo (1971). Herbert Kelman suggested that role-playing might be \\"the most promising source\\" of research methods alternative to methods using deception (Kelman 1965).cf. H.

Canadian non-governmental organizations formed the Halifax Initiative in December, 1994 to ensure that demands for fundamental reform of the international financial institutions (namely the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)) would be high on the agenda of the upcoming June, 1995 Group of 7 meeting in Halifax. The Halifax Initiative is a coalition of development, environment, faith-based, human rights and labour groups. Members of the Halifax Initiative Coalition # Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, Social Affairs Office # Canadian Council for International Co-operation # Canadian Friends of Burma # Canadian Labour Congress # Canadian Auto Workers, Canada Social Justice Fund # Development and Peace (Canadian Catholic Organization) # Falls Brook Centre # KAIROS: Canadian Ecumenical Justice Initiatives # MiningWatch Canada # The North-South Institute # Oxfam Canada # Oxfam Québec # RESULTS Canada # Rights & Democracy # Social Justice Committee # Steelworkers, Humanity Fund # World Inter-Action Mondiale History The Halifax Initiative Coalition was formed in the context of an international movement of non-governmental organizations focused on evaluating the role and record of the Bretton Woods Institutions at the time of their 50th Anniversary. Canadian NGOs formed the Halifax Initiative in December 1994 to ensure that demands for fundamental reform of the international financial institutions (IFIs) were high on the agenda of the Group of 7's 1995 Halifax Summit. Today, the Halifax Initiative is a liberal coalition of 19 development, environment, faith-based, human rights and labour groups, and has established itself as the Canadian presence for liberal public interest advocacy and education on IFI reform. Since their beginnings in 1994, they have worked through research, education, advocacy and alliance-building to fundamentally transform the international financial system and its institutions to achieve poverty eradication, environmental sustainability and an equitable re-distribution of wealth. The coalition's work is focused on issues of: * debt cancellation (developing countries' debt) and conditionality; * the reform of the World Bank, the IMF and export credit agencies’ social, environmental and human rights policies and practice, with an emphasis on the mining and resource extraction sectors; * halting structural adjustment programmes, with a focus on forced privatization; and * mechanisms designed to control international currency speculation. Over the past fifteen years, the support of their members has proven essential to the success of meeting the Coalition's objectives. Key achievements Since December 1994, the Halifax Initiative has built public and policy-maker support for reform of IFIs. Some results from their efforts include the following: Debt Canada was the first among the Group of 7 to cancel the debt of some of the poorest and most indebted countries, and played a key role in deepening debt relief offered by the World Bank and the IMF. World Bank accountability Halifax Initiative has also been involved in World Bank accountability. Canada was instrumental in the revival of the Inspection Panel in 1999 and in the creation of the Independent Evaluation Office of the IMF in 2000, two key mechanisms for increasing public accountability in the Institutions. Global financial architecture Canada’s played a leadership role internationally in fostering debate over the reform of the global financial system, in recognition of the severe limitations of the IMF's ability to provide global economic stability. For example, Canada’s promoted emergency stand-still clauses, the creation of the G-20, and gave its support for the Tobin tax, a form of capital control. Tobin tax work On March 23, 1999, due in part to the Halifax Initiative work with Members of Parliament, members from all five political parties contributed to a vote which passed a private member motion on the Tobin tax. The motion was originally brought forward by New Democratic Party MP Lorne Nystrom. The motion passed by a margin of 164 to 83, including that of 131 Liberal Party of Canada members. As a result, discussions of the Tobin Tax reemerged in national referenda around the world and in United Nations' studies, and lent growing support for global taxes. Export credit agencies Halifax Initiative has also done work in relation to export credit agencies. In recent years, the Canadian government adopted legislation that requires Canada’s export credit agency (ECA), Export Development Canada, to take into account the environment and to disclose information to the public on the projects it supports. These changes came after over 130,000 Canadians demanded change in a letter-writing campaign facilitated by the Halifax Initiative. During 2006/7, the Halifax Initiative participated in the multi-stakeholder Advisory Group to the National Roundtables on Corporate Social Responsibility and the Canadian Extractive Industry in Developing Countries (EDC). The participation of Halifax Initiative staff in the Advisory Group facilitated the inclusion of recommendations regarding EDC in the final, consensus-based report. Those recommendations concern the adoption of enhanced transparency, human rights and environmental policies by EDC. The Halifax Initiative has been actively engaged in the mandate of the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative on business and human rights. In 2008, Halifax Initiative submitted an analysis on the human rights obligations of export credit agencies to the Special Representative, John Ruggie. Mr. Ruggie acknowledged Halifax Initiative's work in this area and has called for enhanced human rights due diligence by export credit agencies. Projects considered unworthy by the Halifax Initiative The Halifax Initiative worked on advocacy and media work around the Western China Poverty Reduction Project, and the Alumysa Aluminum smelter in Patagonia. These projects were subsequently cancelled or suspended. Relations between civil society and the Government of Canada Among other things, Halifax Initiative institutionalized bi-annual civil society consultations with the Finance Minister on international financial institutions issues. Public debate in Canada Halifax Initiative has informed thousands of Canadians through their Teach-Ins, film-screenings, conferences, tours and press releases about issues related to and including the World Bank, IMF, G20, G8, privatization, human rights and international debt.

The painting depicts a young woman standing inside a shop selling ribbons and dresses. In one hand she holds a wrapped package of newly purchased items. With the other she holds open the door to the store for the viewer to depart. The shop is filled with piles of ribbons. Outside a busy Parisian street scene is visible through the shop windows. A well dressed man stares in through the window and is greeted by the other girl in the shop. The painting was created in the period 1883–1885 using Tissot's distinctive style of dry pigments and small brush strokes—not impressionism, but still a major departure from the Academy style. It also reflects some of Tissot's main interests, such as the materialistic world of objects and clothing of the late nineteenth century.Gail Dexter. \\"J.J.J. Tissot: Exciting Victorian.\\" Toronto Star. April 6, 1968, pg. 38 The painting also employs Tissot's favourite technique of this period of placing the observer directly in the painting, with the shop girl holding the door open for us.\\"Tissot Retrospective\\", by Eugenia Parry Janis. The Burlington Magazine 1968 pg. 303 It was first exhibited in 1885 at the Galerie Sedelmeyer. It was a part of an exhibit Tissot titled Quinze tableau sur la femme à Paris (fifteen paintings on the woman of Paris).\\"Review: James Tissot. New Haven, Québec and Buffalo,\\" by Paul Stirton. The Burlington Magazine 2000 pg. 131. It was his last major exhibition before Tissot embraced religious subjects and spent the rest of his life painting scenes from the Bible. The painting was gifted to the Art Gallery of Ontario in 1968. Regina Haggo sees this painting as a depiction of barely contained lust. On the floor a fallen ribbon makes a clear heart shape. To Haggo the position of the heart on the floor makes clear this is a baser form of desire. The women are modestly clothed, but Tissot emphasizes their figures, especially the breasts of the woman raising her arms. In this period a woman working outside the home was considered morally dubious. The leering man and the vantage of the viewer can suggest that more than just the clothing is for sale. The man outside may be flirting with the shop girl, but Haggo notes that Tissot emasculated him by having a women's torso overlap his own.\\"The joy of shopping.\\" Regina Haggo.

ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter, STS-116 mission specialist, works with the Passive Observatories for Experimental Microbial Systems in Micro-G (POEMS) payload in the Minus Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) inside the Destiny laboratory. Scientific research on the International Space Station is a collection of experiments that require one or more of the unusual conditions present in low Earth orbit (for example microgravity, (cosmic) -radiation and extreme temperatures). The primary fields of research include human research, space medicine, life sciences, physical sciences, astronomy and meteorology. International Space Station Overview Research and On-Orbit Facilities Non- Partner Participation The 2005 NASA Authorization Act designated the American segment of the International Space Station as a national laboratory with the goal of increasing the use of the ISS by other federal agencies and the private sector. Research on the ISS improves knowledge about the effects of long-term space exposure on the human body. Subjects currently under study include muscle atrophy, bone loss, and fluid shift. The data will be used to determine whether space colonization and lengthy human spaceflight are feasible. As of 2006, data on bone loss and muscular atrophy suggest that there would be a significant risk of fractures and movement problems if astronauts landed on a planet after a lengthy interplanetary cruise (such as the six-month journey time required to fly to Mars). Large scale medical studies are conducted aboard the ISS via the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI). Prominent among these is the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity study in which astronauts (including former ISS Commanders Leroy Chiao and Gennady Padalka) perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts. The study considers the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions in space. Usually, there is no physician on board the ISS, and diagnosis of medical conditions is a challenge. It is anticipated that remotely guided ultrasound scans will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is difficult. Researchers are investigating the effect of the station's near-weightless environment on the evolution, development, growth and internal processes of plants and animals. In response to some of this data, NASA wants to investigate microgravity's effects on the growth of three-dimensional, human- like tissues, and the unusual protein crystals that can be formed in space. The investigation of the physics of fluids in microgravity will allow researchers to model the behaviour of fluids better. Because fluids can be almost completely combined in microgravity, physicists investigate fluids that do not mix well on Earth. In addition, an examination of reactions that are slowed by low gravity and temperatures will give scientists a deeper understanding of superconductivity. The study of materials science is an important ISS research activity, with the objective of reaping economic benefits through the improvement of techniques used on the ground. Other areas of interest include the effect of the low gravity environment on combustion, through the study of the efficiency of burning and control of emissions and pollutants. These findings may improve our knowledge about energy production, and lead to economic and environmental benefits. Future plans are for the researchers aboard the ISS to examine aerosols, ozone, water vapour, and oxides in Earth's atmosphere, as well as cosmic rays, cosmic dust, antimatter, and dark matter in the universe.

It is a native bunchgrass in the North-central and Northeastern United States, the Great Lakes region, and eastern Canada. The specific epithet kalmii refers to its discoverer Pehr Kalm. Description Bromus kalmii is a perennial grass, with solitary or slightly tufted culms that grow tall. The culms are pubescent just below the nodes. The grass typically has three to five and occasionally six leaf blades. The firm and scabrous leaf blades are either pubescent or glabrous and are long and wide. The glabrous or sometimes shaggy sheaths are mostly shorter than the internodes and each have a \\"V\\" shaped cleft. The ligule is typically long. The narrow, crowded panicle is long. The lower branches of the panicle are very slender and each bear one or two spikelets. The five to eleven flowered spikelets are long and wide. Both glumes have short, adpressed hairs. The lower glume is three-nerved and the upper glume is five-nerved. The densely hairy lemmas are oblong to elliptical in shape, and have straight awns long. The oblong and flat palea is slightly shorter than the glume. The anthers are approximately long. The grass flowers from July to through August. Habitat Bromus kalmii grows in dry or moist open areas or thickets, especially on calcareous soils.

Additional events such as Japanese rock concerts and visual kei cosplay events are held at the nearby venue Nachthallen. A park next to, and an area at the entrance of, the Kongress Palais, as well as the surrounding architecture offer cosplayers space and background for photo shooting. Food and drinks may be purchased at the Palais, as well as at shops and supermarkets in the vicinity a number of which have in recent years begun to open for extended hours even on Sunday during the Connichi weekend. During the event, the Connichi ticket allows to use public transport within a certain tariff zone for free. Agenda Connichi offers a variety of attractions typical to anime conventions, such as shows and concerts, contests, video rooms, console games rooms, karaoke, vendors and exhibitors, and Bring'n'Buy flea markets; as well as workshops in Japanese language and culture such as how to wear a Kimono or how to draw manga-style. The latter are regularly held by Guests of Honour working in that area (see below for a list of guests). Contests Participation in any contest is free for every visitor but may be subject to prior registration or even submission of artistic material. While the actual range of contests may vary from Connichi to Connichi, the following contests are staple. * Cosplay Cosplayers can participate in separate contests which allow either one or two persons at a time, or up to five persons at a time. Since 2004 Connichi also holds the preliminary contest for the World Cosplay Summit to determine the German finalists.http://www.wcs-germany.de/wcs/was- ist-der-world-cosplay-summit/ Besides the chance to participate in the WCS, the winner receives a flight ticket for the trip to Nagoya, Japan. * Ramen Eating Contest A cup of instant ramen noodles, usually sponsored by Nissin Foods, is freshly prepared, quickly cooled to prevent scalding, and to be eaten in the shortest time possible. Current record (2010) is 8.7 s.http://animexx.onlinewelten.com/fotos/foto.php?id=6395798 * AMV Contest In several categories, winners are determined whose videos will be shown. Further staple contests include a console games competition, tournaments in Go, TCG and CMG, a hard Anime quiz, as well as Karaoke and Dōjinshi contests. Usually, the winners are announced and rewarded at the closing ceremony. Guests of Honour Connichi Guests of Honour come from a wide range of characters notable for their contributions to Japanese pop culture both in Germany and internationally, such as manga and anime artists, voice actors, as well as singers, idols and bands.

The street runs more or less north-south, and the Raadhuisstraat runs west. The street name means 'New Side Front Bastion Wall'. In the 14th century, the city of Amsterdam was equally divided in two parts, each at one side of the River Amstel. To defend the city against intruders, a canal with a bastion wall (burgwal) was built. The burgwal protecting the oldest of the two sides was called the Old Side Bastion Wall. The bastion wall at the new side was called the New Side Bastion Wall. When in 1385 a new bastion wall was built with a canal – behind the old bastion walls – those were now called New Side Behind Bastion Wall and Old Side Behind Bastion Wall. The original bastion walls were then renamed as New Side Front Bastion Wall and Old Side Front Bastion Wall. In Dutch, these names are often written as one word, hence the extraordinarily long names for these four canal streets: Nieuwezijdsachterburgwal, Nieuwezijdsvoorburgwal, Oudezijdsvoorburgwal and Oudezijdsachterburgwal. When the canals of the bastion walls at the new side were filled in, the Nieuwezijdsachterburgwal was renamed as Spuistraat. Nieuwezijdsvoorburgwal kept its name. The Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal contains a number of famous buildings, including the Royal Palace of Amsterdam, the Nieuwe Kerk, the Amsterdams Historisch Museum and the former main post office which is now the Magna Plaza. Dutch psychiatrist Tina Strobos, who rescued over 100 Jewish refugees from the Holocaust during World War II, lived with her family at 282 Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal.

An army led by Charles, Earl Cornwallis consisting of British East India Company and British Army forces, along with allied forces from the Maratha Empire and the Nizam of Hyderabad, arrived at Seringapatam on 5 February 1792, and after less than three weeks of battle and siege, forced Tipu Sultan to capitulate. With his agreement to the Treaty of Seringapatam on 18 March 1792, the war came to an end. Background The prospects for Tipu Sultan, the Muslim ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore, had declined significantly during the 1791 campaign season of the Third Anglo-Mysore War. Although he had been able to reverse some advances made by forces of the British East India Company forces under General William Medows in 1790, he had lost ground on all fronts in 1791, and only a slash-and-burn policy to deprive his opponents of provisions and forage had prevented company forces under Charles Cornwallis from besieging his capital, Seringapatam.Wickwire, pp. 132-150 Cornwallis, whose army had been desperately short of provisions, withdrew to Bangalore in May 1791 to resupply his army and wait out the monsoon rains. Tipu took advantage of the British retreat to recover Coimbatore, but he lost several strong points when British forces captured Nundydroog and Savendroog late in 1791, and Britain's allies in the conflict, the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Marathas, also made territorial gains at his expense. British forces The force that Cornwallis assembled at Savendroog in January 1792 consisted of about 20,000 company and British Army troops, a horde of the nizam's cavalry, and an enormous civilian camp that trailed after the marching companies when it left Savendroog on 25 January.Wickwire, p. 163 After stopping at Outradroog to join with additional Hyderabadi troops, the great army marched on, only mildly harassed by Tipu's cavalry, until its advance guard got about north of Seringapatam on 5 February, where the plains below Seringapatam opened and Cornwallis established a position from which Tipu's defences could be examined. Tipu punctuated the arrival of the British by showering them with rockets in an ineffective yet impressive display of technology. (Tipu's rockets were probably influential on William Congreve, who went on to develop what are now called Congreve rockets.) In addition to the grand army, Cornwallis had ordered General Robert Abercromby to lead a supporting army of about 6,000 men from the Malabar (western) coast.Wickwire, p. 169 Tipu's defences Tipu Sultan and his Sepoys defend the fortifications of Seringapatam. The city of Seringapatam occupied an island in the Kaveri River, which at that point flowed roughly west-to-east from the Western Ghats on its way to the Bay of Bengal. The city proper occupied the center of the island, with the western end of the island occupied by a strong stone fortress, and the eastern end by a large walled garden that included Tipu's palace and the tomb of his father, Hyder Ali. Tipu had arrayed army, which Cornwallis estimated to number between forty and fifty thousand, along a roughly semicircular line on the northern shore of the Kaveri that covered the approaches to the island. This line, three to four miles (four to five km) long, was studded with six redoubts, and much of the line was protected by a thick hedge. To the east (Tipu's right) the line was anchored by Karigaut Hill, and the entire line was arranged to be within firing range of either the fort or entrenched positions on the island.Wickwire, p. 165 Cornwallis, after inspecting the city's defences on 6 February, decided to attack even though Abercromby's column had not yet reached the area. As long as Tipu's army was outside the city's defences, he could conduct a proper siege, and his opponent's freedom to act might also interfere with the arrival of Abercromby, who would have to cross the Kaveri (a difficult proposition for an army even without hostile forces nearby) to make a junction with the grand army. Cornwallis planned a nighttime attack with three components. General Medows would lead 7 battalions on the right, where he was to drive Tipu's left back toward the fort, while Lieutenant Colonel Maxwell would lead 4 battalions to gain Karigaut Hill on the left. Cornwallis himself would direct 8 battalions in the center with the objective of gaining the river near the eastern end of the fort. If successful, the Mysoreans would be driven onto the island, and either Cornwallis or Maxwell would be able to follow and establish a strong position from which the fort could be besieged. Since the battle was to take place at night, they would be unable to use artillery to provide covering fire, so he ordered the attacks to be made only with musket and bayonet. Cornwallis deliberately excluded the nizam's forces from the action, since he did not trust them to act effectively.Wickwire, p. 166 Battle Cornwallis did not divulge details of the plan until one hour before the attack. At around 9 pm the three divisions left camp. In the center, Cornwallis advanced to the hedge, which his force reached around 11. By then gunfire from his left indicated that Maxwell's men had already begun their attack on Karigaut Hill, and the sounds had thrown the Mysorean troops in the center into some disorder. Cornwallis ordered his men through the hedge; the British troops closed with the bayonet on the Mysoreans, who fled in near-panic, leaving artillery, tents, and provisions behind. One redoubt gave resistance and was stormed.Wickwire, p. 167 Maxwell's and Cornwallis' men chased the fleeing Mysoreans as they crossed the bridges onto the island and sought the shelter of the fort. Tipu, from his position in the fort, observed the disaster and then raised the drawbridge to prevent British troops, which were by then intermingled with the Mysoreans, from gaining entry to the fort. While this secured his own position, it left many of his troops at the mercy of the British. The division of General Medows did not fare quite as well as the other two. Medows strayed too far to the west in the dark, and although he successfully took the westernmost redoubt of the Mysorean line, he was prevented from approaching the island by a series of ravines and swampy ground. This created a gap in the British lines between the center and right, exposing Cornwallis, who had held back from the lines with a single battalion, to personal danger. Tipu sought to exploit this gap in order to recover the camp, and organized an infantry attack against the gap. Cornwallis was able to rally his men and repulse the counterattack, but his hand was grazed by a bullet during the action. When daylight arrived the field of battle was more clearly visible to all, and Tipu ordered his artillery to begin firing on the British positions. Significantly exposed, Cornwallis withdrew his command to Karigaut Hill, abandoning part of his camp in the process, and leaving a detachment of men in the captured redoubt. This enabled the Mysorean cavalry to roam freely through the area while Tipu's artillery continued to play on exposed British positions. Unable to support the men in the redoubt, Cornwallis had to watch as the Mysoreans made five attempts to storm the redoubt, all of which were repulsed. When night fell, Cornwallis was able to advance and relieve the beleaguered men in the redoubt. Tipu also used the night to withdraw his men entirely from the north shore of the Kaveri, enabling Cornwallis to completely surround the fort.Wickwire, p. 168 Siege Plan of the siege In order to hasten the arrival of Abercromby's force, Cornwallis dispatched companies of Hyderabadi and Marathan cavalry to meet and escort them to the area. On 10 February Abercromby's force arrived in camp, in spite of a sortie led by Tipu personally in an attempt to prevent the meeting from happening. From this point, the siege became a matter of routine, as the British lines slowly advanced on the island toward the fortress. On 23 February Cornwallis inspected the unfinished first parallel. That same day, Tipu sent out negotiators to end hostilities. Peace Although fire ceased on 24 February, peace was not formally agreed until 18 March, when Tipu agreed to the severe terms of the Treaty of Seringapatam. Cornwallis made a preliminary demand that Tipu surrender two of his sons as hostages of war to guarantee Tipu's performance. On 26 February, in a ceremony immortalized in art by Robert Home, who accompanied Cornwallis on the expedition, Tipu's sons, aged seven and eleven, were delivered with great pomp and circumstance to Cornwallis' care.Wickwire, p. 170 The treaty terms forced by the victors on Tipu were harsh. Mysore's size was reduced by half, with the company, the nizam, and the Marathas sharing in the spoils. The territories taken by the company were chosen in part to ease the difficulty of defending against future attacks from Mysore,Wickwire, p. 172 although the final war with Mysore was initiated by the British in anticipation of further military action by Tipu. In that war, Seringapatam was stormed and Tipu died in its defence. General Medows was apparently distraught over his poor performance in the battle. On 27 February, after meeting with Cornwallis, he returned to his tent, and attempted to commit suicide, firing three bullets into his body with a pistol. He failed in even this, and spent several days in agony. His hopes dashed at ever gaining the command of India, he eventually returned to England. Cornwallis never blamed him for his failures on the night of 6 February.Wickwire, p. 173 NotesReferences  External links * — A plan of the siege Seringapatam Seringapatam 1792 Seringapatam 1792 Seringapatam 1792 Seringapatam 1792 Seringapatam 1792 Category:1792 in India Category:Srirangapatna ","title":"Siege of Seringapatam (1792)"},{"id":"26616176","text":"Shadrach in the Furnace is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert Silverberg, first published by Bobbs Merrill in 1976. The novel was nominated in 1976 for the Nebula Award, and in 1977 for the Hugo Award. The story takes place in 2012, and is set in Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia's capital), which has become the world capital. The main character is Shadrach Mordecai, personal doctor of the world dictator, Genghis II Mao IV. The dictator wants to reach immortality, and puts all of his efforts to financing projects that can save him from death. The three main projects are Phoenix, Talos, and Avatar. The story then delves into the relationship between Shadrach and Genghis Mao, the ethical problems of a doctor in this situation, and above all, the developments of the plot when the man who needs to be used in Project Avatar is finally chosen. Background The story takes place in 2012 in a reconstituted world. Constant warfare and natural disasters led to numerous economic recessions, causing a quick drop in standard of living across the globe. The chaos culminated in a disaster known as the Cotopaxi eruption in South America, which darkened the skies even until the day after the incident. This disaster gave rebels the opportunity to strike, which triggered other uprisings all over the globe. After this, the Virus War broke out, leading to a break out of a pandemic known as organ rot, which spread across the globe, ravaging the world. Due to all this destruction, governments in the world surrendered their authority to the last secure regime standing, known as the Permanent Revolutionary Committee of Mongolia, led by Chairman Genghis II Mao IV Khan. The entire world is ruled by a series of governing committees in every nation and is ruled directly by the PRC in Ulaanbaatar. The Committee maintains its power because the rest of the world is apathetic to politics and interested only in getting by life's daily problems. All government officials are entitled to various antidotes, protecting them from the organ rot disease, thus allowing members of the ruling class to live in luxury compared to the destruction of the outside world. The dictator Genghis Mao, in a struggle to maintain his youth, constantly undergoes various organ transplants in order to prevent organ failure. In the novel, where the dictator is in his 90s, it is mentioned that he has the strength of a man in his 50s. In order to allow the dictator to achieve immortality, three main projects are being undergone to explore various possibilities to achieve immortality. The first, Project Talos, looks at the possibility of transforming mannerisms, personalities and habits into digital codings which can then be programmed onto an automated machine, allowing the dictator to operate his administrative duties after death. Project Phoenix, as the name suggests, attempts to regenerate body cells using a given genome, in this case that of the dictator, in order to allow the body, and his brain, to be regenerated after death. And lastly, Project Avatar, deals with transforming personality and habits into codings which can be transferred into a separate living entity, allowing Genghis Mao to function in the body of another being. Plot The story begins on 14 May 2012 as Dr. Shadrach Mordecai, personal physician of the dictator Genghis II Mao IV, awakens. He checks the health of the dictator through a series of implants within his body that link to the general health of his client, allowing him to receive any information on the health of the dictator through codings of various twitches in his own body. Through a series of security checks, he enters into his office to prepare for a kidney transplant for his master. As he passes Surveillance Vector One, the eye on the world which gives committee members the ability to view all events happening on Earth, he meets Mangu, the prince of the world and viceroy of the committee, a charming man who earns the admiration of all his subjects. Mangu is concerned about the surgery, but Shadrach Mordecai assures the prince that Genghis Mao has grown used to surgeries. Here, Shadrach also reveals to the reader that Mangu was chosen as the subject for Project Avatar, where Genghis Mao will continue to reign in the body of his own son. He also feels sorry for Mangu, since he was tricked by his father into believing that he would inherit the throne. Once in his office, he contacts Nicholas Warhaftig, surgeon of the dictator. Warhaftig orders Shadrach to bring Genghis Mao to the Surgery by 0900. Soon, Genghis Mao himself contacts Shadrach to ask how his health is that day. As Shadrach tells the dictator of his health state, he also informs the dictator of the incoming surgery and its timing. Genghis Mao requests for Shadrach to enter his room and prepare him for the surgery at 0900. We also learn from this conversation that the surgery would give the dictator the fourth liver he is having. Afterwards, Shadrach looks up the leaders of the projects Talos, Phoenix and Avatar, for it is his responsibility as personal physician to the Khan to keep checks on the progress of such projects. First, he contacts Katya Lindman of Project Talos. She reports to Shadrach their progress in coding Genghis Mao's eyelid mannerisms and as Shadrach asks her to continue working on coding his mental processes, she has an apprehensive look but agrees. Next, he contacts Irayne Sarafrazi of Project Phoenix. She talks of her problems with brain cell deterioration and becomes worried as Shadrach presses for her to make further progress in the subject. Lastly, he contacts Nikki Crowfoot of Project Avatar, who is also Shadrach's lover. After she recounts her progress, she arranges a meeting with Shadrach for 0230. Shadrach reveals to the reader his belief that Project Avatar is far superior to the other two, since Project Talos could only create an automated Genghis Mao which could never live up to the ability of the original while Project Phoenix would constantly be confronted with the problem of brain cell regeneration. Afterwards, he leaves to take Genghis Mao to the Surgery. As Warhaftig and his team operate on the dictator, Shadrach, due to his implants, acts as a \\"computer\\" for the team, informing them of the health status of the dictator throughout the entire surgical process. During the operation, Shadrach also comments on the calmness and tranquility of the dictator and how he has grown accustomed to constant organ transplants. After the surgery, he prepares to leave with Crowfoot to Karakorum, the playground of the world's ruling class. As they enter Karakorum, Nikki Crowfoot muses about how Shadrach and Genghis Mao are like one entity and compares them to the sculptor and his sculpture, how the actions and health situation of Genghis Mao affect the actions of Shadrach. Nikki Crowfoot decides they ought to go to the transtemporallism tent, where supposedly religious rites are carried out using chemicals to transport a client into a dream-like state where he may witness famous scenes, usually related to Christianity. Shadrach is transported to the scene of the Cotopaxi eruption, where he helplessly watches the civilians die all around him. When he wakes up and leaves the tent, he sees many government members, who greet him. Among them is Roger Buckmaster, who claims that he has gained enlightenment from the transtemporallist experience. Buckmaster first recounts his dream of the Last Supper and the subsequent betrayal at Gethsemane, and how it taught him to hate evil. Then, he begins insulting Shadrach and blaming him for keeping Genghis Mao alive. Both Shadrach and Buckmaster have a lengthy moral argument, but soon Nikki Crowfoot leaves the tent and they leave the area, with Buckmaster shouting curses to Shadrach. Shadrach and Nikki book a room and sleep together, after which they encounter Bela Horthy and Donna Lambile, two members of the government. Mangu is giving a speech about the worldwide distribution of Rondevic's Antidote against organ rot, to which Bela Horthy yells curses that Genghis Mao constantly lies about healing the world from the organ rot disease, despite the desperate urgings of Lambile. The next day, Shadrach awakes feeling tremendous vigorous twitches from the implants and immediately rushes to meet the Khan. There, he sees many government members surrounding the dictator. He learns from Ionigylakis, the Vice President, that Mangu was assassinated. He soon realises that the twitches were due to the shock from Genghis Mao when he received the news. He also learns that Bela Horthy was the one who witnesses Mangu falling from his window before he informed the Khan. Genghis Mao gives Avogadro, the security chief, orders for subsequent arrests and sentences against suspected individuals in order to invoke fear into the population. In Committee Vector One, Shadrach has a brief conversation with Avogadro, who states that no one, not even Bela Horthy, saw any assassins throw Mangu out of the window, thus many government members believe it was merely suicide, but Genghis Mao remains convinced that Mangu was killed. Shadrach then asks Bela Horthy about the exact recount he gave to Genghis Mao. At first, Horthy is apprehensive but soon replies that he merely stated that Mangu had died and nothing else. Shadrach also learns from Horthy that Buckmaster has become a prime suspect in the assassination case due to his words of folly at Karakorum the previous night. Shadrach asks Horthy about his own words at Karakorum, but Horthy insists that he was not at Karakorum at all. Meanwhile, the committee members are in chaos as General Gonchigdorge struggles anxiously to find possible suspects and Surveillance Vector One. As the general calls for Frank Ficifolia, Ficifolia reveals to Shadrach his opinion that the committee members have gone mad and that Mangu had probably committed suicide. Shadrach returns to his room, where he sees Nikki Crowfoot. He recounts to her the incidents that occurred and Crowfoot is immediately shocked since her project is affected by the death of the chosen subject. As she listens to the subsequent events, she comments that Bela Horthy probably intended for Genghis Mao to feel great shock due to his testimony and perish. Shadrach returns to his office where he receives a call from Katya Lindman, who requests that he review her progress on Project Talos. She shows the robot of Genghis Mao and all its actions and becomes angry when Shadrach does not seem impressed. As she continues to show Shadrach all her equipment, Shadrach begins to suspect that she has feelings for him. Later on, he receives a call from Avogadro to participate in his interrogation of Buckmaster. During the interrogation, Buckmaster constantly defends himself, saying that he was drugged from the transtemporallism. Avogadro is shocked that Shadrach also attempts to defend Buckmaster, but more passively. However, in the end, Buckmaster is arrested on the basis of a faulty \\"I'll destroy him\\" while he was arguing with Shadrach at Karakorum. Shadrach then argues with Avogadro, saying that it was not justified to arrest a man he knew was innocent. However, Avogadro is apathetic to the plight of Buckmaster and even uses Shadrach's words at Karakorum against him that \\"guilt is a luxury we cannot afford\\". They both assume that Buckmaster is being sent to the Organ Farms, where his organs would be used to support the dictator. The next day, Shadrach visits Genghis Mao, who speaks deliriously and even offers to make Shadrach pope in Rome. Shadrach infers that Genghis Mao has gone mad over the death of Mangu. That night, he goes to Karakorum with Katya Lindman, where they try dream-death, an experience where one is placed in a dream-like state and imagines death and the subsequent afterlife. Shadrach travels the afterlife realm with Katya in his dreams, and after enjoying themselves, to enters into a tranquil state before awaking. Katya reveals that she was having a different dream from him, one which was not as light-hearted as his. Then, they return home to rest, where Katya randomly and suddenly warns Shadrach to be careful. Nikki Crowfoot grows increasingly distant from him, and Shadrach is unable to discover why. He visits Genghis Mao and informs the dictator of an aneurysm he detected in the dictator's abdominal aorta. The news annoys Genghis Mao, since he is preparing a colossal funeral for Mangu which he refuses to delay. Shadrach has lunch with Katya, who reveals to him that, on the night before his death, she informed Mangu that he was chosen as the Avatar subject. Katya tells Shadrach that she did so only out of sympathy for Mangu, but Shadrach suspects that she wanted to kill the Avatar subject so that her project could supersede Nikki's and hopefully destroy her relationship with Shadrach so she could have him too. However, he soon realises that his suspicions contradict Katya's decision to reveal this information to him. Shadrach hopes to visit Nikki and after learning that she had fallen ill, makes the decision to visit her in her room. There, he pretends to examine her but subsequently asks about her project, to which she responds angrily, ranting about the setbacks in her work. As Shadrach leaves, he also reveals to Nikki that a member of Project Talos informed Mangu that he had been chosen as the Avatar subject, but he disguises it as a rumour. However, Nikki believes it and instantly suspects Katya Lindman to be the culprit. Later, Shadrach confesses to Katya what he had revealed to Nikki. Katya is disturbed at first, but soon informs Shadrach that he had been chosen as the next Avatar subject. Shadrach soon realises that that had to be the reason Nikki had chosen to distance herself from him. Katya advises Shadrach to make a plan of escape and also tells him not to trust Nikki anymore, since she must have agreed to continue her work despite the fact that he was chosen. The day of the aorta transplant arrives. During the surgeries, Shadrach thinks to himself that if he killed Genghis Mao on the operating table, Project Avatar would be finished. He muses about plans such as jostling Warhaftig's elbow or feeding them misleading information, but resolves not to. In his office, Shadrach begins thinking about Genghis Mao's possible origins and begins crafting fake diary entries from the perspective of Genghis Mao in his mind. Soon, he decides to confront Nikki Crowfoot about him being the Avatar subject. Nikki is shocked and somewhat remorseful, but she defends herself, saying there was nothing she could do. Shadrach is distraught, but lets the matter rest. He resorts to carpentry to cope with the stress. On one of his adventures to the carpentry chapel, he meets Frank Ficifolia, who offers Shadrach the chance to escape from Ulan Bator and remain hidden. Ficifolia also reveals that members of the government helped to conceal Buckmaster, who is still alive, and offers to do the same for Shadrach. However, Shadrach is unsure and asks for time to think. Then, he is approached by Bela Horthy, who advises Shadrach to take the offer and flee from Ulan Bator, but Shadrach continues to refuse. He makes a visit to the Project Avatar laboratory to meet Nikki Crowfoot. After a tour of the laboratory, Nikki takes him to her office. She advises Shadrach to flee from Ulan Bator, even at the expense of her work. However, Shadrach still wants more time to think, to which Nikki responds that she loves him still. Soon, Shadrach decides to go on a vacation so that he would think better overseas. He informs Genghis Mao about his decision, who is slightly disappointed but agrees. Shadrach first goes to Nairobi, where he meets Bhishma Das, a merchant. Bhishma Das constantly asks him questions about the organ rot disease and the Roncevic's Antidote. As they continue their conversation, Shadrach begins speaking of utopian ideals that, after many years, the world will rebuild itself. Although he is unsure of this prophecy, under the encouragement of Bhishma Das, he becomes convinced that that will eventually happen. This gives him encouragement to deal with the problem of Project Avatar. He then leaves for Jerusalem, where he meets Meshach Yakov at the Wailing Wall. Shadrach is distressed about the widespread organ rot and poverty amongst the people, including children, and he prays. Meshach takes Shadrach to his house, where he and his family chat with Shadrach about politics. He then goes to Istanbul, Rome and San Franscisco. In each place, he is constantly distressed by the suffering of the people but also begins to suspect that the Citpols, policemen of the Genghis Mao regime, are spying on him. At San Franscisco, he meets an old friend, Jim Ehrenreich, who is struck with organ rot and requests that Shadrach steal some of Rondevic's Antidote for him. However, Shadrach refuses, saying that the antidote only immunises and cannot cure. At first, Ehrenreich is angry but after a while, he accepts his fate. At Peking, Shadrach begins to feel strange twitches in his implants and after a series of checks begins to suspect clogging of cerebrospinal fluid. He rushes to the airport, hoping to get a quick flight back to Ulan Bator. At the airport, he meets Avogadro, who informs Shadrach of the multiple headaches suffered by Genghis Mao and that he requested for Shadrach's return to the capital. Shadrach returns to the capital and visits Genghis Mao, informing his master of the problem and suggests that it be cured by brain surgery: more specifically, to implant valved tubes to his skull to drain the excess fluid. Afterwards, Shadrach arranges a meeting with Frank Ficifolia, requesting to meet Buckmaster. Although Ficifolia is annoyed that Shadrach chose to return when he could have escaped the capital, Shadrach reassures him that he has a plan. Ficifolia agrees to arrange the meeting. Shadrach is taken to the transtemporallists in Karakorum, where Buckmaster has hidden himself as an ascetic, entering multiple dreams to witness the life of Jesus. Shadrach requests for Buckmaster to create a device that will allow him to control the valve that will be implanted into Genghis Mao, and after much persuasion, Buckmaster agrees. In Ulan Bator, he arranges a meeting with Katya Lindman. Both of them talk about the funeral of Mangu, which he missed while he was on holiday. He also informs her about his cure for the headaches of Genghis Mao, and despite the warnings of Katya, Shadrach states that he has a plan to save himself. Soon, Genghis Mao is operated on and the valved tubes transplanted. He then meets Nikki Crowfoot, who informs him of her progress in Project Avatar. She adds that she hopes her project will not be chosen, but Shadrach tells her not to worry about him but to focus on her work instead. To rest, he leaves again for Karakorum unaccompanied and visits the dream-death tent, where he enters the afterlife and heals numerous people in the dream. He is hailed as their Saviour but is soon interrupted by the scene of Katya informing him that he was chosen as the Avatar subject. Shocked, he awakens and returns to Ulaanbaatar. Already implanted with the device to control the valved tubes, Shadrach visits Genghis Mao and informs him of how he is able to control the tubes using the device implanted in his hand and whenever he clenches his fist, the tubes will reverse, quickly killing the dictator. Instead of begging or becoming angry, Genghis Mao is pleased and informs Shadrach that he was never going to become the Avatar subject in the first place. He also admires Shadrach's shrewdness in dealing with the situation. Shadrach demands to become a committee member in charge of public health to oversee the production and worldwide distribution of Roncevic's Antidote. Genghis Mao agrees and, confused about the dictator's reactions, Shadrach leaves the room to admire the outside world. Characters *Shadrach Mordecai - Dr. Shadrach Mordecai is the personal physician to the Mongol dictator Genghis Mao. Born in Philadelphia, he worked his way until attaining government position. At the start of the novel, he is relatively loyal to the dictator, arguing against dissidents such as Roger Buckmaster and Bela Horthy. He is also a realist, constantly weighing out possibilities when faced with a dilemma. This is most evident after he discovers that he was chosen as the Avatar subject and he refuses to escape from Ulan Bator because he is concerned about how he will live his life after the run. He is also quite philosophical and sympathetic, especially during his vacation, when he ponders about death and the suffering of individuals and how the world could be improved. He also proves to be quite intelligent when he makes the plan to place a valved tube into Genghis Mao's skull which he would be able to control. However, he is restrained and calm, since he does not kill the dictator when he has the chance but instead demands a committee position so that he may oversee a worldwide distribution of Rondevic's Antidote. His love life is also complicated, on one hand attracted to Nikki Crowfoot but upset at her betrayal, and on the other hand repelled by the non-feminine features of Katya Lindman but moved by her love and concern for him. By the end of the novel, it is still ambiguous which girl he prefers. *Genghis Mao - Also known as Chairman Genghis II Mao IV Khan of the Permanent Revolutionary Committee, he is the dictator of the world governing the ruins of the Virus War. According to Shadrach's speculations, he was probably from an unknown village but slowly worked his way into politics. He rules the world because the populace is apathetic to politics, more concerned with the grit of daily life. Obsessed with youth and immortality, he funds a series of projects to sustain life after death and undergoes various organ transplants to maintain his youthful strength. A survivor at heart, he is a cunning schemer, deceiving his own son Mangu into believing that he is the heir to the throne when he was chosen as the Avatar subject. He has a mysterious nature, but he is also very calm, as seen from how when Shadrach threaten to kill him, Genghis Mao was unaffected and simply told Shadrach that he was never the Avatar subject in the first place and does not show anger when he is forced to appoint Shadrach to the committee. Very egotistical, his elaborate funeral for Mangu was also a form of self-worship to mourn the death of his would-be body. *Nikki Crowfoot - The lover of Shadrach, she is the head scientist in charge of Project Avatar. At the start of the novel, her love for Shadrach seems genuine and fervent, enjoying their time in bed and also admiring the close connection he has with the dictator. However, after the death of Mangu, her love for Shadrach only goes so far as it was overpowered by her fear of Genghis Mao. She admits that she did not attempt to sway the opinion of the dictator when he was picked as the Avatar subject, but her love for him still remains quite strong, especially when she advises Shadrach to flee from Ulan Bator at the expense of her own project. Insightful and intelligent, she was also able to detect that Katya Lindman had been the one who informed Mangu of the truth, causing his death, and that she was the one who informed Shadrach that he was the next victim. By the end of the novel, it is unsure whether Shadrach still loves her as much as he did but it is obvious that her feelings for him have not changed. *Katya Lindman - The head scientist in charge of Project Talos, Katya Lindman is one of women Shadrach has feelings for. A fiery and passionate woman, she is easily angered when Shadrach presses for her progress. Throughout the novel, she seems to have a fervent jealousy against Nikki Crowfoot due to her professional success and the fact that she is the girlfriend of Shadrach. However, Katya also has a genuine and fervent love for Shadrach, as evident from how she warned him to be careful of Genghis Mao and subsequently informing him that he was chosen as the Avatar subject. She is also sympathetic to others, as evident from how sorry she felt when she told Mangu the truth. However, even when protecting Shadrach, her hatred against Nikki remains, especially when she advised Shadrach to break up with her due to her betrayal. At the end of the novel, at her final meeting with Shadrach, she wears effeminate clothing which surprises Shadrach, since he finds it unnatural, but it is revealed that she did so only to please Shadrach. *Roger Buckmaster - A skilled microengineer serving Genghis Mao, Roger Buckmaster was the scientist who built the implants connecting Shadrach to Genghis Mao. At Karakorum, after a transtemporallist experience to the Last Supper and the betrayal at Gethsemane, his world view changes and he yells curses against Genghis Mao and subsequently Shadrach for keeping the dictator alive. When he was interrogated as a suspect for the murder of Mangu, he denies ever hating the dictator, claiming that he was drugged. Although he is placed under arrest and sent to the organ farms, members of the government rescue him by hiding him in Karakorum under the transtemporallists while faking the organ farm records. Afterwards, when Shadrach visits Buckmaster, he is a changed man, due to his constant visits of the life of Jesus Christ, he lives an ascetic life, like that of a monk. Although he has chosen to forget his previous life under Genghis Mao, he still relents to build the valved tube device under Shadrach's request. *Bela Horthy - Another dissident against Genghis Mao, he is first seen at Karakorum with his lover Donna Lambile. During a speech by Mangu about the worldwide distribution of Rondevic's Antidote, he yells curses against Genghis Mao for brainwashing the populace into waiting for an antidote that will never come. However, when Mangu is supposedly killed and Roger Buckmaster, who was also at Karakorum and too cursed Genghis Mao, Bela Horthy is adamant that he was never at Karakorum and he had cursed the dictator. However, he proves to be a dissident when he is among the government members to advise and offer Shadrach the chance to escape from Ulaanbaatar and avoid becoming the Avatar subject. *Frank Ficifolia - An engineer and designer of Surveillance Vector One and a committee member of the government, Frank Ficifolia is among the government members who offer Shadrach the theory that Mangu committed suicide and was not assassinated. Later on, when Shadrach is chosen as the Avatar subject, he constantly advises him to flee from Ulan Bator to save his life. He is the first to inform Shadrach that Roger Buckmaster was spared death and offers Shadrach the same opportunity. When Shadrach returns to Ulan Bator, he chastises him for returning to Ulan Bator, where he knows his doom awaits, but agrees to arrange a meeting with Roger Buckmaster at Shadrach's requests, despite his uncertainty about his plan. *Avogadro - The Security Chief working under Genghis Mao, Avogadro is the first to express to Shadrach the idea that Mangu committed suicide instead of being assassinated. Although he received direct orders from the dictator to arrest numerous suspects and send them off to the organ farms, he saw the plan as madness since he believed that no one was guilty for the death of Mangu. However, he proves to be more pragmatic than idealistic, especially at the interrogation of Roger Buckmaster, where he arrests him under little evidence of intended murder. During his argument with Shadrach regarding the arrests, he shuns Shadrach's argument that it was not justified to arrest people he knew were innocent by reiterating the idea that \\"guilt is a luxury we cannot afford\\", quoting Shadrach's words at Karakorum. *Mangu - A naive princeling and viceroy of the world, he was deceived by his father into believing that he would inherit the throne, when in truth he was destined to become the Avatar victim. Charming and outgoing, he gave many speeches to the populace and earned the admiration of the world citizens. He had a close relationship with his father, eager to learn more about politics so that he would become a capable ruler. He is also very humble and modest, as seen from a meeting with Katya Lindman where he expressed his concern that he was not ready to take the throne. However, when the truth was revealed to him, it was a betrayal to his strong relationship with his father. Too much for the young prince, he committed suicide and his father threw an elaborate funeral for him. *Nicholas Warhaftig - A professional medical expert and surgeon to Genghis Mao, even though he holds a lower position that Shadrach, it is an unspoken pact between them that he holds more influence since he is a more experienced and more capable doctor than Shadrach. Shadrach, and many other medical experts in various government departments, greatly admire and look up to Warhaftig due to his skilled surgical abilities and careful hands. We see him operating on Genghis Mao for the liver transplant, aorta transplant and the implantation of the valved tube. During all three, he proves a capable surgeon and doctor. *Bhishma Das - A Hindu merchant living in Nairobi, he is very thoughtful about the world around him, constantly pondering about human folly and how it led to the organ rot disease. When Shadrach arrives at Nairobi, he greets him in a gentlemanly manner and asks numerous questions about the disease and how it was implanted in human DNA after the Virus War. Although he has a bleak idea of the present, he is pleased when Shadrach offers an optimistic prediction of the future and how the humans will rebuild the world and start anew. Very hospitable, he is kind to Shadrach during the trip and even offers a room in his house for Shadrach to stay in. He understands the idea of contentment and even claims that if he were to contract the organ rot disease, he would not mind since he lived a good, long life. *Meshach Yakov - An American-born Jew living in Jerusalem, he is dismayed and agonized by the state of mankind and how it has destroyed itself but constantly turns to the Lord in prayer for solace. Every day, he visits the Wailing Wall to pray. When Shadrach travels to Jerusalem, Meshach is amused that their names both refer to Biblical heroes in Babylon. He and his family seem to be devout Jews, all of them having Biblical names and constantly turning to God for protection over their lives. *Jim Ehrenreich - An American and one of Shadrach's childhood friends, he was once a track shot-putter in Shadrach's school team. He worked his way to become a government member in the committee governing the United States of America, having easy access to Rondevic's Antidote. However, he fell in love with a girl whose brother contracted organ rot. Desperate to save him, he attempted to steal some of the antidote but was caught instead. He was retrenched of his position and, due to his reliance on the antidote, almost immediately contracted organ rot. When he meets Shadrach in San Franscisco, he begs for some of the antidote but becomes indignant when Shadrach refuses. However, he soon calms down and accepts his fate. Reception New York Times reviewer Gerald Jonas faulted Silverberg's plotting, saying that \\"His characters come to resemble the stilted figures in a morality play, responding not to their own needs or to each other's actions but to the arbitrary dictates of the author.\\" Richard A. Lupoff praised the novel as \\"a fine and rewarding book . . . one of Silverberg's superior performances\\"; although he faulted the climax as \\"arbitrary, almost perfunctory.\\"\\"Lupoff's Book Week\\", Algol 28, 1977, p.48.

Born into a racing family, Jarvis had a brief but successful career as a jockey before taking up training. He was one of the most prominent British trainers of the mid 20th century, winning nine British Classic Races and being the British flat racing Champion Trainer on three occasions. In 1967 he became the first trainer to be knighted for services to horse racing. Background and riding career Jack Jarvis was born in 1887, the third son of William Arthur Jarvis, who trained racehorses at Waterwitch House at Newmarket, Suffolk. William Jarvis trained several leading horses in the 1890s including Bona Vista and Cyllene. Two of Jack Jarvis' brothers trained Classic winners: William Rose \\"Willie\\" Jarvis (1885-1943) sent out the filly Godiva to win both the 1000 Guineas and Epsom Oaks in 1940, whilst Basil Jarvis (1887-1957) won The Derby with Papyrus. Jack Jarvis became an apprentice jockey at his father's stable and rode his first winner in 1902 at the age fourteen. In subsequent seasons he showed considerable promise, winning the Cambridgeshire Handicap on Hackler's Pride in 1902 and the Ayr Gold Cup in 1905 on Kilglass. Jarvis' rising weight made him unsuitable as a flat race jockey and after briefly competing under National Hunt rules he retired from riding in his early twenties. He then worked as his father's assistant trainer for five years. Training career Jarvis set himself up at Warren House stable, Newmarket as a private trainer for A. E. Barton in 1914, but after two years the yard was closed because of the First World War. After serving with the Tank Corps Jarvis recommenced his training career in 1919 at Park Lodge, one of the oldest training stables in Newmarket. Jarvis won his first significant race in his second season when he trained Golden Orb to win the Wokingham Stakes at Royal Ascot, and confirmed his reputation by winning the Ascot Gold Cup and Eclipse Stakes with Golden Myth in 1922. Jarvis' success attracted the attention of Lord Rosebery and his son Lord Dalmeny who became the major patrons of the Park Lodge stable. At around the same time Jarvis employed Charlie Elliott as his stable jockey. Throughout his career, Jarvis was known for the amount of hard exercise to which he subjected his horses. His methods were considered rather old- fashioned, but often gave his charges a fitness advantage in the early part of the season. Another feature of his training programme was that he often sent a strong team to campaign in Scotland in autumn: he trained over 100 winners at Ayr Racecourse, including three successive Ayr Gold Cups. Jarvis' first classic success in 1923 when Elliott rode Rosebery's colt Ellangowan to victory in the 2000 Guineas and the same team combined to win the 1000 Guineas with Plack a year later. Jarvis had deliberately misled Rosebery about Ellangowan's condition in 1922: he wanted to give the colt time to develop and discouraged the owner from racing him by claiming that the horse had a recurrent coughing problem. Further classic success followed: in 1929 Elliott won the 2000 Guineas on Sir Laurence Philipps' Flamingo and two years later Sandwich won the St Leger after finishing an unlucky third in the Derby. In 1938 Jarvis trained Blue Peter for Lord Dalmeny who had succeeded his father as Earl of Rosebery in 1929. The colt was beaten in both his races as a two- year-old, but he showed his best form in 1939, winning the 2000 Guineas and the Derby. He was denied the opportunity to win the Triple Crown when the outbreak of War forced the cancellation of the St Leger, but his earnings enabled Jarvis to win his first trainers' championship. During the war, Jarvis' best horses were the filly Ribbon who finished second in three classic races and the colt Ocean Swell who won the substitute Derby at Newmarket in 1944. Immediately after the war he trained Royal Charger, owned by his namesake Sir John Jarvis, who won the Ayr Gold Cup in 1946 before becoming a highly successful breeding stallion in the United States. Jarvis opened a second yard at Palace House in Newmarket in 1950 and won a second championship a year later when he trained the winners of 62 races worth £56,397. There were no classic winners among them, with his best horses being the handicapper Fastnet Rock and the two-year-old filly Primavera, who won the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot. The trainer's final classic success came in 1953 when he trained Happy Laughter and Tessa Gillian to finish first and second in the 1000 Guineas. Happy Laughter later went on to win the Coronation Stakes and her earnings helped Jarvis win the trainers' title for a third time. In 1955 Jarvis threatened to retire after the Jockey Club attempted to introduce new rules making trainers liable for any delays caused by adjustments to a horse's girth strap before the start of a race. The rule was subsequently amended. In 1965 Jarvis, by now 77 years old, scaled down his training commitments by giving up his Palace House stable. A year later he had two of the leading contenders for the Epsom Derby in General Gordon and Pretendre. General Gordon won the Chester Vase but was fatally injured in training shortly afterwards while Pretendre was beaten a neck by Charlottown at Epsom. Jarvis continued training until his death on 18 December 1968. At the time, Park Lodge stable housed a two-year-old filly named Sleeping Partner who went on to win the following year's Epsom Oaks, the only classic to have eluded Jarvis during his training career. Personal life and interests Jarvis married Ethel Leader, the daughter of the trainer Thomas Leader, in 1914 and had one daughter. Away from racing he had a keen interest in cricket and coursing, and won the Waterloo Cup in 1926 with his greyhound Jovial Judge. He was knighted by the Queen in 1967 for services to horse racing, making him the first trainer to be so honoured. Jarvis wrote an autobiography entitled They're Off, which was published in 1969.

Working principle is similar to that of a 'cheese slicer', a nanometer-thin individual carbon nanotube strung between two tungsten needles would allow sectioning of very thin slices of biological matter for imaging under an electron microscope. Tests are currently being performed by scientists at Virginia Tech, CU-Boulder and other universities. A successful development of this new tool will allow scientists and biologists to make 3D images of cells and tissues for electron tomography, which typically requires samples less than ~300 nanometers in thickness. In 2009, the nano-knife was used to create indentation marks on biological cell plasticizer (epoxy resin). The whole cutting process is currently limited by electron charging of polymeric specimen in the SEM, which makes it difficult to observe any small cut or mark as the carbon nanotube is pressed against the specimen. Nanoknife Procedure Doctors use a special medical device designed for the specific purpose of performing irreversible electroporation. The device implements a direct current generator which emits short pulses of high voltage electric current through electrodes into the cell membrane. The doctor inserts thin needles into the area, using ultrasound imaging to guide the placement of the needles. In nanoknife treatment, strong electric fields cause cells to die without exposing the tissue to radiation or heating it. Most patients don’t feel anything at all during the procedure.

(jg.) Elmo D. Twiehaus in command. Following shakedown, ATA-190, an auxiliary ocean tug, proceeded to Panama; thence, with YN-108 in tow, continued on to Pearl Harbor. Arriving on 4 March, she departed 10 days later; and, on 9 April, she delivered her tows, a YF and a barge, to Guam. Joining ServRon 10 there, she got underway again on the 20th; and, by the end of the month, had delivered a pontoon barge to Kenmu Wan, Okinawa. On 3 May, she shifted to the Hagushi anchorage. On the 5th, she proceeded to Kerama Retto. On the 6th, she sailed southeast; and, during the remaining months of World War II, she took tows from the Carolines and the New Hebrides to the Philippines and, from the latter, escorted a convoy of landing craft to Okinawa. When the war ended in mid-August, the ATA was at San Pedro Bay, Philippines. In early September, she moved up to Okinawa again, then proceeded to Japan, anchoring off Wakayama on the 8th. For the next month, she assisted the minecraft sweeping the entrance to Kii Suido and participated in harbor clearance salvage operations in the wake of a typhoon. In October, she shifted to Nagoya; again assisted in opening shipping lanes to peacetime traffic, then commenced guide-and-pilot-vessel duties in that area. In December, ATA-190 shifted to Yokosuka; assisted in rebuilding facilities there; and, in March 1946, she got underway for the United States. Steaming via Okinawa, Peleliu, Subic Bay, and Pearl Harbor, she arrived in San Francisco Bay on 29 July; transited the Panama Canal in mid-September; and moored at Norfolk on the 26th. The ATA, assigned to the 10th Naval District, commenced towing operations out of Puerto Rico at the end of October. For the next three years, she operated primarily in the Caribbean, with occasional tows to, and temporary duty at, ports on the southeast coast of the United States. Named Samoset on 16 July 1948, she was assigned to the 5th Naval District in November 1949 and arrived at her new homeport, Norfolk, in mid- December. From that time, through the 1950s, and until August 1969, she provided towing services for that district; for various commands of the Atlantic Fleet; and in support of Office of Naval Research and Oceanographic Office projects. On 12 August 1969, Samoset was ordered inactivated. A month later, on 12 September, she was decommissioned at Norfolk; and, on 3 December 1970, she was transferred to the custody of the Maritime Administration and berthed in the James River as a unit of the National Defense Reserve Fleet, where she remained until being sold to Haiti on 1 October 1978.

It is a development of the earlier Harbin Z-8, itself a locally produced version of the Aerospatiale Super Frelon. Design and development The AC313 is an updated design based on the earlier Harbin Z-8, itself a development of the Aérospatiale Super Frelon. The prototype first flew at Jingdezhen, Jiangxi on 18 March 2010. It is designed to carry 27 passengers, has a reported maximum range of 900 kilometres, and a maximum takeoff weight of 13.8 tonnes. With three Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6B-67A engines, the AC313 is the largest helicopter ever developed in China. The AC313 is a single-rotor helicopter with tail rotors, side-by-side pilot seating, and a non-retractable landing gear. Although based on a 1960s design, the AC313 has been developed to use composite materials for the rotor blade and titanium main rotor. Composite materials are used on 50% of the helicopter and titanium is used for the remainder. The interior comes equipped with a modern integrated digital avionics system and has a cabin height of 1.83 m and 23.5 m3 in space. Designed to carry 27 passengers and two crew in the transport role, it has also been designed to be used for VIP transport, medical evacuations, and for search and rescue operations. In terms of cargo, it can carry up to 4 tonne internally or 5 tonnes on a sling. AC313 is equipped with electronic flight instrument system.AC313 EFISAC313 cockpit The AC313 is only the second helicopter to be able to operate in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, first being Sikorsky S-70C Black Hawk. The flight testing period for the 13-tonne AC313 was conducted in Hulunbuir City, Inner Mongolia, starting in January where it was tested to operate in extremely low temperatures as low as minus 46C marking the scope of Asia's largest tonnage helicopter meeting the mission requirements of the cold climate and the Earth's polar regions. The helicopter also set its speed record of 336 km per hour during the testing period. The AC313 became the first China-made aircraft authorized by China's civil aviation authority in January to fly in high-altitude regions of over 4,500 meters above the sea level. The AC313 has recently received a Type Certificate issued by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). Following Chinese certification, the first five AC313 are to be delivered to Flying Dragon Special Aviation, in 2011, but no aircraft have been delivered yet. Avicopter has plans to certify the AC313 for sales in Europe and the United States. Xu Chaoliang, the chief designer of the helicopter, said the company has so far received 32 orders from national and international customers. Equipped with advanced instrument landing system, the helicopter can be used for disaster relief even in blizzard weather in plateau regions. CAIH, a wholly owned subsidiary of the China Aviation Industry Corp, is expected to produce 300 helicopters annually by 2015, making it one of the major helicopter suppliers in the world. Headquartered in Tianjin, the company is mainly engaged in the research and development, production, maintenance and sales of helicopters and other aircraft and aviation components.

The film is a love story about two robots living in Los Angeles where humans and robots co-exist. The plot is based on The Giving Tree, and the main character is named after Shel Silverstein. The film's robots were created by Alterian, Inc., a Los Angeles-based effects company notable for their costume design for Daft Punk. The film was funded by and is a promotion for Absolut Vodka, featuring the tagline \\"A Love Story in an Absolut World\\" on the promotional poster. Music from the band Sleigh Bells is prominently featured. The film made its debut at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival.  Plot  Sheldon (Andrew Garfield) is a gray robot with a head shaped like an old PC tower. Every day, he rides the bus to the public library then rides home again at the end of the day to recharge himself in his apartment. He appears unhappy and forlorn until one day, while waiting for the bus, he sees Francesca (Sienna Guillory), a sleekly-designed female robot, driving a car (despite an apparent ban on robots driving). He sees her again the next day, driving with several other robots and one shirtless human. Though she passes by him at first, she turns her car around and offers Sheldon a ride home, which he accepts. Francesca stops at a mall and she, and Sheldon, walk off together while she sticks pieces of paper on an \\"Exit\\" sign and a palm tree. The papers show a drawing of long hair and eyebrows with the words \\"I'm here\\". Francesca falls off a ledge and injures her knee. Sheldon repairs her knee with his built-in toolkit, and they listen to \\"There Are Many of Us\\" by ASKA & The Lost Trees on her car radio. Sheldon and Francesca grow closer. One night, while they are lying together in Sheldon's apartment, Francesca tells Sheldon about her dreams, something Sheldon thought was impossible for robots to have. The two later go to a rock concert, where Francesca gets lost in the crowd and loses her left arm. Sheldon takes her to safety then goes back to retrieve her arm. Finding it smashed on the floor, he replaces it with his own arm, transplanting it onto Francesca's body. Later, Sheldon finds Francesca lying in the hallway outside his apartment, her right leg missing. He removes his own leg to replace it; and though Francesca initially protests, he convinces her to take it by telling her he had a dream about her needing a leg and choosing his over all the legs that were offered to her. Some time after, Francesca fails to pick up Sheldon at the library (as she normally does), leaving him to take the bus. When he gets home, he receives a phone call summoning him to the hospital. He arrives to find Francesca's body broken and lifeless on an operating table, and he saves her life by having the rest of his body surgically transferred to her, with only his head remaining. Francesca is taken out in front of the hospital in a wheelchair, cradling Sheldon's head in her lap. The two smile and look out towards the setting sun as a taxi pulls up to pick them up.

Starring Stanley Tucci and Lisa Eichhorn, the film's plot reverses the conventions of romantic comedies: instead of man meet woman - fall in love, marry and have baby, in this film the woman gets pregnant, then meets the father, then falls in love. Grace Rhodes (Lisa Eichhorn) is a lonely, successful executive whose biological clock is loudly ticking. Giving up on finding the right man, she resorts to using a sperm bank on the advice of her best friend Elaine (Caroline Aaron). Soon she is pregnant, but she becomes so curious as to the identity of the father that she goes on a quest to find him with the help of Elaine. Peter Kessler (Stanley Tucci) is a nature photographer living in Upstate New York. While his life style differs from her, he is also reluctant to commit to a relationship, indulging in a casual affair with a married woman (Mary Jo Salerno). His photographs only feature landscapes, because, as far as he is concerned, \\"people mess up composition\\". His world is rocked when Grace comes into the picture. And announces she's pregnant. \\"You got yourself into this situation,\\" he tells her. \\"You're going to have to get yourself out. I'm not going to take responsibility for your baby.\\" While at first he runs away from any intimacy, he renews contact with Grace later. From then on begins their discovery of mutual commitment and their journey to parenthood. A Modern Affair purports to investigate the meaning of bringing a child to the world, rather than tackling the artificial insemination and sperm bank which serve as a ploy to explore intimacy and commitment. Coincidentally, since the film was made, the identity of sperm donors has been offered more readily to the children conceived by anonymous donors.

Montagne-Saint-Émilion is number 16. Montagne-Saint- Émilion is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for wine in the Bordeaux wine region of France, where it is situated in the Libourne subregion on the right bank of the Dordogne. It was granted AOC status on 14 November 1936, and the AOC designation granted to the wines which have been harvested on the land of the Montagne commune or in its hamlets, Parsac and Saint-Georges. of vine planted areas have belonged to the appellation in 2005, with a production of 74,130 hl. Montagne-Saint-Émilion only produces red wine, and nearly all of the grape varieties from Bordeaux can be and are used, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Côt, etc., although it is Merlot that is used most often. The vineyard of Montagne can be found northeast of Saint- Émilion, on the right bank of the Barbonne. It forms part of the \\"satellites\\" of the Saint-Émilion vineyard along with the vineyards of Lussac-Saint- Émilion, Saint-Georges-Saint-Émilion and Puisseguin-Saint-Émilion. The base yield is fixed at 45 hl/hectare with a limit of 20%. Before the chaptalization and concentration process, the must (the residue of grapes, after the juice has been extracted) must contain a minimum of 187g/l of natural sugar. After fermentation, the wine must have a minimum alcohol level of 11% vol. Grape varieties Traditionally, the wines of Montagne-Saint-Émilion are a collection of different grape varieties. The three main varieties being Merlot, Cabernet Franc (or Bouchet) and Cabernet Sauvignon: * Merlot - the most dominant grape variety, accounting for 75% of the planted area. It is a variety that ripens early, and needs cool and humid conditions, as well as soil rich in clay. It ripens well and gives wine its colour, a good alcoholic richness, a full bodied texture and is smooth and round on the palate. * Cabernet Franc - an important element of the Libourne plantations and represents nearly 20% of the vineyards of Saint-Emilion. Of medium precocity, it is grown mostly in chalky or quite warm soils. It gives the wine an aromatic flavour, lightly spiced, with a coolness and tannic structure, giving the wine an aged flavour. * Cabernet Sauvignon - representing around 5% of the plantations, it is a grape that is particularly adapted to warm and dry soil (gravel, sand, clay or chalky soil). It gives wine a gently spiced flavour, complex with a tannic richness, and favourable to its long and harmonious preservation. The AOC regulations for Montagne-Saint-Émilion also allows the use of two other grape varieties: Malbec (or Côt) and Carmenère. Only the Malbec grape is still used.

Military career  Arjuna succeeded his father Subhatavarman, and invaded the kingdom of the Chaulukyas of Gujarat. The 14th century writer Merutunga calls him the \\"destroyer of Gujarat\\". Arjuna defeated Jayanta-simha (or Jaya-simha), who had usurped the Solanki throne for a brief period. The 1211 CE Piplianagar grant of Arjuna refers to his victory over Jayanta, so Arjuna's Gujarat invasion must have happened before this time. An inscription from Bhopal indicates that he had reached Bharuch by 1213 CE. The Dhar prashasti inscription states that he defeated Jayasimha in the Parva mountain valley (possibly Pavagadh). It also states that Arjuna captured Jayanta's daughter Jayashri, and fell in love with her. According to Asoke Majumdar, this suggests that Jayanta made peace with the Paramaras through a marriage alliance. When the Yadava ruler Simhana invaded Lata (southern Gujarat), Arjuna's Chahamana general Salakhanasimha defeated him. Later, the Yadava king sent another force led by his general Kholeshvara to Lata. This second invasion resulted in the Paramara feudatory's defeat. Arjunavarman married the Hoysala princess Sarvakala, who was probably a daughter of grand-daughter of the Hoysala king Ballala. Simhana's invasion of the Hoysala territory appears to have led a fresh conflict between the Paramaras and the Yadavas. Simhana invaded the Paramara kingdom in 1215, and according to the later Yadava court poet Hemadri, this invasion resulted in the defeat and death of Arjunavarman. The veracity of Hemadri's claim is doubtful, as the 1222 Bahal inscription mentions Arjunavarman's defeat, but not his death. The Tiluvalli inscription also states that Simhana humbled the lord of Malwa.  Other activities  Arjuna assumed the title Trividhivīracūḍāmaṇi. In his inscriptions, Arjunavarman claimed to be an reincarnation of his illustrious ancestor king Bhoja.E.

He was a patron of scholars, and himself an accomplished poet. He is best known from a eulogistic inscription of his reign which takes the form of play called the Vijayaśrīnāṭikā, composed by Madana, the king's preceptor.

The Saint-Chinian is a French wine, from the Languedoc-Roussillon wine region of France. It is usually a blend of several grape varieties, and produced in red, rosé, and white versions. Since 1982, the name is protected by an appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC, \\"controlled designation of origin\\"). Its terroir was named after the nearby village of Saint-Chinian. History=Prehistoric and antiquity It is considered to be the oldest winemaking area in the old Languedoc region of France (now known as the Languedoc-Roussillon and the Midi-Pyrénées in the south of France) as the vineyards have been cultivated since ancient times. The vineyards were developed during the Roman presence in France, notably at the time of the development of the Via Domitia, the first Roman road to link Gaul and Hispania. The wines produced at the time were exported in ceramic vases known as amphoras, across the Mediterranean Sea, and were very much appreciated in Rome. They are mentioned by Cicero and Pliny the Younger in their stories. Middle-Ages During the Middle Ages, the monks saved a part of the vineyard as at the time, wine was produced by abbeys and monasteries. Towards the 18th century, the Benedictine monks developed the vines in the Vernazobres valley, a tributary of the Orb, near Saint-Chinian. Modern times The vineyard in Languedoc developed as a result of the opening of the Canal du Midi at the end of the 17th century. The wine could then be exported towards the north of France and the rest of Europe. In the region of Saint-Chinian, the decline of smaller industries has worked in favour of the wine-making industry. The profits and workforce have been transferred to this industry. The 19th century saw the vineyard size of Languedoc reach its peak. Thanks to the development of rail transport and the increase in railroads, the wine of Hérault can be efficiently dispatched towards the north of France and Europe. The large wine producers are often have wine-producing châteaus known as \\"folies\\". Béziers claims to be the \\"wine capital of the world\\". Contemporary times After the Second World War, and since the 1970s in particular, the Languedoc region has regularly suffered from the problem of overproduction. It therefore has had to try to change its wine-making policy and promote quality over quantity. An improved variety of grapes is used, which are taken from other French regions. In 1951 Saint- Chinian was classified as a Vin Délimité de Qualité Supérieure (VDQS), the second highest category of French wine. In 1982 the area was awarded an Appellation d'origine contrôlée, AOC Saint-Chinian. The application for the appellation was supported by Raoul Bayou, parliamentarian from Hérault and past mayor of Cessenon. At the turn of the millennium, the Languedoc region went through a serious wine-making crisis: overproduction, bad sales and competition with wines from the New World and the Southern hemisphere on the international market. A number of co-operative wine-makers have found themselves in great financial difficulty and have received help from the French State or the European Union. There has been a number of demonstrations in the region, some violent, with support for elected locals often coming from wine-making communes. Some wine-growers are constricted to picking only their own vines. In 2004, the Institut National des Appellations d'Origine recognised the existence of two under-appellation communes: Saint-Chinian- Berlou and Saint-Chinian-Roquebrun. 2004 also saw the introduction of the Saint-Chinian Blanc appellation. Location A road surrounded by the vineyards of the Saint-Chinian AOC The Saint-Chinian AOC is situated at the foot of the edges of the Massif Central, the plateau of Espinouse, to the west of the department of Hérault, between Béziers and Saint-Pons de Thomières. It is exposed towards the Mediterranean Sea. To the North, it is bordered by scrubland. To the South, it goes past the wine-producing plain of Béziers. It is crossed by the Orb, and its two tributaries, which provide the water for the Saint-Cinian vines, and the Lirou, which provides the water for the Puisserguier vines. Geology The ground of the AOC Saint-Chinian is split into two distinct sides. To the north of the appellation, the soil is composed of schists, just like the soil at the Faugères area. The wines produced on these schists are of a deep colour, very expressive in the mouth, fruity and a little acidic. It is these wines which are reminders of the scrubland and are preserved for quite some time. To the south of the appellation, beyond the village of Saint-Chinian, the soils are quite clayey and chalky. The ground is even chalkier towards the villages of Assignan and Villespassans; whereas the marl clay-chalky soils dominate in the villages of Cazedarnes, Puisserguier, Creissan and Quarante. The wines produced on this type of soil are weaker and less robust. Vineyards The vineyards are situated in the department of Hérault, about twenty kilometres west of Béziers. Introduction The vineyards stretches over the communes of: Assignan, Babeau-Bouldoux Berlou, Causses-et-Veyran, Cazedarnes, Cébazan, Cessenon-sur-Orb, Creissan, Cruzy, Ferrières-Poussarou, Murviel-lès-Béziers, Pierrerue, Prades-sur-Vernazobre, Puisserguier, Quarante, Roquebrun, Saint-Chinian, Saint-Nazaire-de-Ladarez, Vieussan and Villespassans. Grape varieties The grapes used at Saint- Chinian are Carignan, Cinsault, Grenache, Lledoner Pelut, Mourvèdre and Syrah. Syrah (used to ameliorate the wines), Mourvèdre and Grenache represent approximately 70% of the grapes grown on the land. The Carignan grape is used in the making of red wines, while the Cinsault grape is better for the making of fruity rosé wines. Certain wine-growers offer 100% Carignan vines, but as Vin de Table as these products, which are not blends as required by the AOC regulations, cannot be sold under the Saint-Chinian AOC designation. Cultivation methods Particularly in the South, the vines are trained using metal wires and are attached to them, whereas in the North, they use the \\"goblet\\" vine training system on sloping vineyards. Marketing With regards to the volume of wine, the Saint-Chinian AOC is the fourth in Languedoc, behind Corbières, Coteaux du Languedoc and Minervois.

She was the older of two children born to the couple and had numerous half brothers and sisters as a result of her mother's affair with Louis XIV of France. When her father found out about the affair between the King and her mother, Montespan decided to take his children away to his country estate before raising a scandal at court, challenging the king one day at Saint-Germain-en-Laye and decorated his carriage with antlers (like horns, these were traditional symbols of the cuckolded husband). He was promptly imprisoned in the For-l'Évêque, then exiled to his lands - taking young Marie Christine and the even younger Louis Antoine. This did not stop his agitation, and he not only came to Paris nearly every year between 1670 and 1686 but also commanded an annual requiem mass to be sung for his wife during her lifetime.

Renewal fees  Renewal fees are payable to the EPO in respect of pending European patent applications in respect of the third year from the date of filing. These fees are paid in advance of the year in which they are due (such that the renewal fee for the third year falls due two years from the date of filing) and fall due on the last day of the month containing the anniversary of the date of filing. (previously ). Renewal fees may not be validly paid more than three months before they fall due, except for the renewal fee in respect of the third year which may not be paid more than six months before it falls due., \\"Renewal fees\\". (Reflecting the changes to as of April 1, 2018). If a renewal fee for a European patent application is not paid in due time, the renewal fee may still be validly paid within six months of the due date, provided that the additional fee provided by is also paid within the six-month period. (previously ) For the calculation of the six-month additional period, the so- called de ultimo ad ultimo rule is applied by the EPO. According to this rule, the six-month period runs \\"from the last day of the month to the last day of the month\\".Decision J4/91 of October 22, 1991, Legal Board of Appeal 3.1.1 of the European Patent Office. Published in OJ 8/1992, 402. For instance, if a renewal fee was due in February 2004, the additional fee fell due on August 31, 2004 (Tuesday), i.e. six months from the end of February 2004. The obligation to pay renewal fees terminates with the payment of the renewal fee due in respect of the year in which the mention of the grant of the European patent is published. Subsequently, renewal fees are payable to the national offices of the EPC Contracting States in which the European patent is brought into effect. Each Contracting State then pays the European Patent Organisation a proportion of each renewal fee received for a European patent in that State. Whereas for a pending European patent application an applicant must pay a single maintenance fee at the EPO, it may be much more costly to pay several maintenance fees to the several national patent offices for maintaining a granted European patent in a number of countries. This however depends on the number of countries in which the patent proprietor wants to maintain its European patent into force.Article 2.1(4) RFees  Refund  Under certain circumstances, such as following the withdrawal of a European patent application or the withdrawal of an appeal, some fees that were paid may be refunded. This is true for search fees,Article 9 RFees the examination fee,Article 11 RFees and the appeal fee. Fee structure The fee structure \\"does not necessarily reflect the actual workload imposed on the EPO in any individual case. Rather, legislators have chosen lump sums as fees that are for example independent of the number of auxiliary requests to be decided or the days allowed for conducting oral proceedings.\\"  References  External links  * Rules relating to Fees as available on the EPO web site * Forms and fees * : \\"Fees\\" * : \\"Rules relating to Fees\\" * Payment of renewal fees for maintaining a granted European patent in the member states of the European Patent Organisation Category:European Patent Organisation Category:Legal costs ","title":"Fees in proceedings before the European Patent Office"},{"id":"26616651","text":"The United States Air Force's 4th Air Support Operations Squadron was a combat support unit located at Mannheim, Germany with V Corps until it was inactivated in 2013.

This synod was marked by conflict between the canons of Udine and Cividale over which of two locations was the most important. Barbaro decided that precedent supported Udine; the clerics of Cividale protested. In the same year Francesco asked Pope Clement VIII to appoint his younger brother Ermolao Barbaro as his coadjutor. On February 12, 1596 the Pope appointed Ermolao Barbaro as archbishop of Tyre. Francesco supported the Roman Rite of Pius V over the older Aquileian Rite. He persuaded Udine to adopt the Roman Rite at the provincial synod held on October 19–27, 1596. Barbaro did the same on 11 May 1600 at the provincial synod of Cividale and on 23 June 1602 with that of Gorizia.

The report, entitled Engineering a Low Carbon Built Environment: The Discipline of Building Engineering Physics, presents the initiative of many at the Royal Academy of Engineering in developing a field that addresses our fossil fuel dependence while working towards a more sustainably built environment for the future. The field of building engineering physics combines the existing professions of building services engineering, applied physics and building construction engineering into a single field designed to investigate the energy efficiency of old and new buildings.King p.8. The application of building engineering physics allows the construction and renovation of high performance, energy efficient buildings, while minimizing their environmental impacts.Sutton Building engineering physics addresses several different areas in building performance including: air movement, thermal performance, control of moisture, ambient energy, acoustics, light, climate and biology.King pp. 8-9. This field employs creative ways of manipulating these principal aspects of a building’s indoor and outdoor environments so that a more eco-friendly standard of living is obtained. Building engineering physics is unique from other established applied sciences or engineering professions as it combines the sciences of architecture, engineering and human biology and physiology. Building engineering physics not only addresses energy efficiency and building sustainability, but also a building's internal environment conditions that affect the comfort and performance levels of its occupants.King p. 8. Throughout the 20th century, a large percentage of buildings were constructed completely dependent on fossil fuels. Rather than focusing on energy efficiency, architects and engineers were more concerned with experimenting with “new materials and structural forms” to further aesthetic ideals.King p. 10. Now in the 21st century, building energy performance standards are pushing towards a zero carbon standard in old and new buildings alike. The threat of global change and the need for energy independence and sustainability has prompted governments across the globe to adopt firm carbon reducing standards. A significant way to meet these stringent standards is in the construction of buildings that minimize environmental impacts, as well as the refurbishing of older buildings to meet carbon emission standards. The application of building engineering physics can aid in this transition to reduce energy dependent buildings, provide for the demands of a growing population and better standard of living.King p. 11. The 2010 RAEng report expressed the expectation that growth in the application of this field would largely due to the introduction of regulations requiring the calculation of carbon emissions to demonstrate compliance, principally the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD).King p. 12.

His songs have been recorded or covered by several different well- known artists throughout the world. Biography Rubinacci was born in Trastevere, Rome, Italy. He moved to England at the age of two, spending most of his childhood following his mother around where her work as an English school teacher took her, including Sicily and Birmingham. Aged 11 he met his father for the first time who worked as a piano bar player in Rome and was previously lead singer and bass player in the popular Italian band I Romans. At 14, Rubinacci followed in his father's footsteps and started writing songs and performing in school bands. His first ever performance on stage was at his school's annual music night, and can be found on YouTube. During his late teens Rubinacci was the lead singer for local heavy rock bands such The Head Dwellers and Bad Penny. His songwriting was still in its nascent form. It wasn't until his early 20's that both his guitar playing and song writing started to develop. It was at this point that he joined Honeyman, a popular Birmingham, UK based alternative band. Formed in August 1997, by early 1998, the band had become one of the most talked about bands on the local scene. Their sound mixed funk, reggae and grunge together and the band quickly became regarded as one of the most exciting live acts to come along in a long time. In 2010 a YouTube documentary charting the first year of the bands rise was released. At 24, after having studied the history art at University of Central England, Rubinacci went solo and toured as the opening act for many international artists including, Jackson Browne, Joe Cocker, The Script, John Martyn, Tom McRae, J.D. Souther, White Lies, Dar Williams, Thea Gilmore, Ben Christophers, All About Eve and Rodrigo y Gabriela. In 2005 Rubinacci appeared on Italian TV as a guest on Destinazione San Remo. In 2006 Rubinacci created his own record company, RAR Records. When it came to choose a producer for his debut album, Rubinacci approached his main choice, Tchad Blake. Blake described Rubinacci's song writing as some of the best he had heard in long time. The album was recorded at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studio with Jerry Marotta on drums, and was mastered at Abbey Road Studio, London. Rubinacci's debut album received mostly positive reviews. * \\"If you’ve not heard of Rubinacci, it's about time\\", Drammens Tidende. * \\"Rubinacci has a long career in front of him\\", Tonsberg Blad * \\"A good debut album from an artist we must hear more from\\", Varden. * \\"Full of emotion and craft\\". Fredriksstad Blad * \\"Whilst Rubinacci has a good voice and an obvious talent for songwriting, some of his lyrics are clichéd\\". Dagbladet. In September 2008 Rubinacci signed a tour deal with a clothes retailer in Norway. The collaboration between an artist and a clothes retailer was the first of its kind in Norway and created a large amount of media interest. After an extensive tour for his debut album in 2008/9, Rubinacci returned home and began writing his second album originally entitled The Glacier Bridge. However, both the title and the themes for the album changed when Rubinacci unexpectedly lost his best friend during the writing sessions. The album became The Opal Tree, and dealt with Rubinacci's struggle to understand the loss of his friend. The title for the album came from the name of the tree Rubinacci planted in his garden the day after he heard the news of his friend. He recorded his second album in Washington, D.C., with Danish record producer Thomas Johansen and like his first was well received by music critics. Rubinacci's albums have now been sold and downloaded over 30,000 times. As of 2015, eight songs from his first two albums have been repeatedly played on various radio stations around the world including France, Italy, Norway and Asia. A further four songs from the first two albums have been covered by major label artists. In June 2012, Rubinacci was featured on the front page of Yahoo News in France as \\"International Discovery of the Week\\". His first single received positive reviews in France and was featured prominently on various radio stations there. In October 2012, Rubinacci was asked to open for Lionel Richie at Oslo Spektrum. He performed again at Oslo Spektrum in March 2014, this time opening for The Dixie Chicks at a sold out show In the summer of 2014, Rubinacci opened the largest and most important music festival in Norway, Norwegian Wood, opening for headline act Arcade Fire on The Reflektor Tour.

In the article, Rubinacci revealed for the first time, that for the last 12 months, he had been struggling with his voice, and had suffered an almost total loss of ability to talk. The article explains that a combination of personal stress, together with a bacterial infection, had caused him to almost totally lose his voice. In total he was unable to sing for the best part of a year. He explained that he thought his career was over. Song writing and covers Rubinacci has had his songs covered and recorded by several well-known artists. Most recently Asian super star A-do, covered one of Rubinacci's songs on his new album gaining positive critical acclaim in Asia. In 2011, Rubinacci co wrote a song with Mogol.

History The Mughal age was an age of development in almost every field including economy. The growing importance of trade and commerce and politics, led to the construction of a network of roads that connected places of commercial and political interests. Along the sides of these roads shady trees were planted, wells dug out and resting places for travellers called serais were constructed.Mukherjee,Soma Royal Mughal Ladies and their Contributions The serai was constructed on the orders of Noor Jahan, wife of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir under the supervision of Zakariya Khan in 1618AD, then Governor of the Doab. Nurmahal got its name from Noor Jahan, who is said to have been brought up here.http://jalandhar.nic.in/html/cities_towns_nurmahal.htm Location And Design Nurmahal is situated 16 miles south of Jalandhar, 25 miles east south-east of Sultanpur and 13 miles west of Pahlor.Ibid, p. 229 The serai was built on a site measuring 551 square feet. It had octagonal towers at the corners. The western gateway, called Lahore gate is double-storied and built in red sandstone. Its front is divided into panels ornamented in sculptured relief. There were figures of angels, lotuses, nymphs, lions, elephants, birds, peacocks, men on horseback, etc. The scenes represented by many of these had scenes of elephant fight or four horsemen playing Chaugan.Ibid, p. 229 Over the entrance to the gateway is an inscription, flanked by scenes of fighting animals and sculpted lotus mounds. The inscription written in four rhyming verses, reads as follows : # During the just rule of Jahangir Shah, son of Akbar Shah, whose neither heaven nor earth remembers. # The Nur Saray was founded in the district of Phalor by command of that angel, Nur Jahan Begam. # The poet happily discovered this date of its foundation: this Saray was founded by Nur Jahan Begam in 1028. # Knowledge of the date of its completion was found in the words: \\"This Saray was erected by Nur Jahan Begam\\" 1030.Findly, Noorjahan, p.229 There were plenty of rooms, Emperor's quarters, a well and a mosque inside the serai area. Jahangir mentions this serai in his memoirs when he says: ...I took up my quarters in Nur-Saray. At this spot the Vakils of Nur Jahan Begam had built a lofty house, and made a royal garden. It was now completed. On this account the Begam, having begged for an entertainment, prepared a grand feast, and by the way of offering, with great pains produced all kinds of delicate and rare things. In order to please her I took what I approved. I halted two days at this place.Tuzuk-i-JahangiriVol.II, p.229 In his memoirs, Jahangir mentions this place at another time also.Ibid.,p. 338 Nur Jahan's Serai was quite famous during those times and \\"Serai Noor Mahal\\" in local usage came to mean some spacious and important edifice.Findly, Noorjahan, p.229 Protected monument The sarai is remarkable specimen of oriental architecture. Nurmahal Sarai is perhaps the only known monument in Jalandhar. This historical monument is now looked after by the Archaeological Survey of India.

Two tracks previously unissued on CD were featured on the album. They were renditions of \\"The Christmas Song\\" and \\"White Christmas\\", both duets recorded with Bing Crosby and the Nelson Riddle Orchestra from the 1957 ABC television special Happy Holidays with Bing and Frank, which aired only once, on December 20 of that year.  Sinatras last recorded Christmas carol  A fourth previously unissued track included on the album was an acoustic recording of \\"Silent Night\\" recorded by Sinatra in 1991 with his son Frank Sinatra, Jr. at the piano, for a children's charity benefit. It was Sinatras last recorded Christmas carol. The then-75-year-old Sinatra had not made any recordings for three years, and the track was not released at the time. For the original 2004 album release, the backing for the vocal was rearranged by former Sinatra collaborator Johnny Mandel using a group of former Sinatra backing musicians including pianist Bill Miller, guitarists Al Viola and Ron Anthony, bassists Chuck Berghofer and Jim Hughart and percussionist Larry Bunker, conducted by Sinatra Jr. Of the recording, Sinatra Jr. said \\"The whole crew was there ... So except for the absence of Frank Sinatra, it was a typical Sinatra recording date. We all expected he'd come walking in at any moment.\\" According to Sinatra Jr., it took two years for producer Charles Pignone to persuade Warner Bros. to finance the recording: \\"This is not the kind of music that people at record companies have interest in ... They will spend millions, millions, to develop some inconsequential rock or rap group, but when Charles approached with a budget of some $30,000 to make a brand new Frank Sinatra song, there was great reluctance.\\" Sinatras daughter Nancy said of the track: \\"It was an emotional day, because he was doing it for the children. It is so sweet and tender that it is just heart-wrenching.\\"  Critical reception  Mark Sabbatini of allaboutjazz.com described the album as uneven, with good early \\"swinging\\" tracks giving way to less interesting later recordings \\"drowning in strings and cheesy arrangements\\". He considers the two 1957 duets with Crosby a highlight. The three mid-album tracks from the 1960s, featuring vocals by Sinatra and his family, Sabbatini refers to as \\"tiresome ... novelty-item treatment\\". He described the final \\"Silent Night\\" recording by the then-75-year-old Sinatra as \\"... off in both pitch and cadence, and ... a terribly sad reminder of how frail he was at the end of his career.\\" Overall, he describes the album as \\"a good match for two groups: those without a Sinatra holiday album wanting a sampler rather than something from a specific era and completists seeking the new songs.\\" Edna Gunderson of USA Today describes the final track as \\"a little blue\\" compared to the rest, which have \\"a merrier lilt\\".

A Columbia Pictures actor in the early 1940s, Crane opened the Luau, a popular celebrity restaurant, in 1953 and established a successful 25-year career in the restaurant industry. In addition to his own accomplishments, Crane is often remembered as Lana Turner's twice ex-husband. Early life Born Joseph Stephenson Crane in Crawfordsville, Indiana, he was the son of William E. and Katheryn Stephenson Crane. The Crane family was well known in Crawfordsville due to their business, the Stephenson Crane Cigar Store. In Crawfordsville, Crane was known to family and friends as \\"Joe\\". Active in drama and debate, Crane graduated from Crawfordsville High School in 1933. Crane was voted \\"Most Attractive\\" by his peers his senior year. Following high school, Crane enrolled in Wabash College, a men's liberal arts college in Crawfordsville. A member of the fraternity Sigma Chi and the dramatic theater Scarlet Masque, Crane graduated with a B.A. in Business in 1937. Joe Crane and his younger brother, Billy, were on a trip to Mexico City when they decided to visit Hollywood on a whim in the summer of 1937. Crane briefly married Indianapolis native, Carol Ann Kurtz, and managed the family cigar store, but after separating from Kurtz, decided to take his chances in Hollywood in 1939. Film career Now known as Stephen, the young Indiana native began his brief film career in 1944. Signed to Columbia Pictures, Crane was cast in the B-picture Cry of the Werewolf. Starring alongside Nina Foch and Osa Massen, Crane starred as a scientist who discovers his father has been killed by a werewolf. The Crime Doctor's Courage (1945) proved to be another murder mystery B-picture. Crane's third and final film appearance was in Tonight and Every Night (1945). Starring Rita Hayworth and Lee Bowman, this World War II musical was nominated for two Academy Awards in 1946. Crane had several lines and walk-on appearances as character Leslie Wiggins, a friend of Bowman's character. Although he had successfully been involved in local Crawfordsville plays in his youth, Crane was the first to admit that his acting skills were less than par. In 1967, Crane would reflect, \\"To be honest, I was a very poor actor\\". Crane's daughter suggests that the abrupt end to her father's acting career may be attributed to his attraction to a Polish ballerina, who turned out to be Columbia Pictures President Harry Cohn’s girlfriend.Crane, p. 72 Restaurant career & Kon-Tiki chain In the late 1940s, Stephen Crane in partnership with Al Mathes bought and managed Lucey's New Orleans House, a popular celebrity restaurant, but quickly sold it to live abroad in Europe in 1948. Returning to America in the 1950s, Crane opened The Luau, a Polynesian-themed restaurant on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. Quickly becoming a celebrity hotspot, the Luau was known for its innovative tiki decor and its high-profile customers. As the host and owner, Crane became a well- known name in the restaurant industry and tongue in cheek signed his menus as \\"STEFOOMA, High-Talking Chief of the Luau\\" in an attempt to keep up with the storied personas of Don the Beachcomber and Trader Vic. Crane's graphic designs, on menus, matchbooks, and tableware became synonymous with the popular Polynesian trends of the decade. Crane expanded his company, Stephen Crane Associates, which at one point included over a dozen different restaurants. The company became most associated with the Kon-Tiki chain of restaurants after he formed a deal with Sheraton Hotels in 1958 to compete against Hilton Hotel's Polynesian restaurants associated with Trader Vic's. This Polynesian-themed chain of restaurants were known for their elaborate decor and precise bar service. Almost every aspect of the elaborate interiors, down to the mugs and napkins, was designed in-house. Eventually there were Kon-Tikis in Sheraton Hotels for Montreal, Portland, Cleveland, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Honolulu, and potentially others (his obituary read that he had 14 locations in Sheraton Hotels, while also mentioning The Luau and Scam restaurants). Boston's restaurant was called Kon-Tiki Ports, and Crane also operated Ports o' Call restaurants in Beverly Hills, Dallas and Toronto. California remained his favorite state, where he was also involved with Stefaninos in Beverly Hills, Au Petit Jean in Beverly Hills, and 9000 on Sunset Blvd. in Los Angeles. The Chaparral Club was in Dallas. The Luau and Kon-Tiki restaurants remained popular, iconic restaurants throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Stephen Crane retired after selling The Luau in 1978, after which it was shortly torn down. Personal life Stephen Crane was as well known for his high-profile relationships as he was for his successful career. In 1942, Crane met actress Lana Turner at the Mocambo restaurant. Turner later described the meeting in her autobiography: > He mentioned nonchalantly that he was in the tobacco business, in a way that > suggested that any kind of business bored him. Certainly it seemed that he > had no money worries. We chatted for hours, and by the time he took me home, > I was ready to fall in love. With my weakness for a certain kind of good > looks, coupled with witty charm, I took him at face value. In no time we > were a pair. Only three weeks later he asked me to marry him. Crane and Turner were married on July 17, 1942, but the happy union was short- lived. Crane had failed to mention that he was not yet divorced from his first wife, Carol Ann Kurtz. Turner quickly annulled the marriage and Crane received a finalized divorce from Kurtz as the marriage mix-up became sensationalized in the gossip columns. After discovering that she was pregnant, Turner remarried Crane in March 1943. Their daughter, Cheryl Crane, was born on July 25, 1943. The marriage did not last and the couple was divorced a second time in August 1944. In addition to Lana Turner, Crane was involved with many famous women. Crane was seen at hotspots with Ava Gardner and Rita Hayworth in the 1940s and Mamie van Doren in the 1950s. Crane was engaged to starlet Lila Leeds when, in 1948, she was arrested along with actor Robert Mitchum for smoking marijuana. Crane quickly ended the relationship and moved abroad to avoid the scandal. In 1948, Crane married French sex symbol and actress Martine Carol, famous for her role in Lola Montès (1955) but the couple were divorced in 1953. In the 1960s, Crane married and divorced Helen (Redding) DeMaree and Leslie Deeb.Crane, p. 323 On April 4, 1958, Crane's 14-year-old daughter, Cheryl, killed Lana Turner's boyfriend, Johnny Stompanato. Sensationalized in the press, the case brought attention to Crane. At the inquest, Crane testified on behalf of his daughter and in the end, the killing was deemed a justifiable homicide.Crane, pp. 231-241 Later life After selling the Luau in 1978, Crane seemed to disappear from the public eye. By 1984, Crane was in ailing health and his ex-wife Helen Demaree cared for him in her home in Pauma Valley. Death On February 6, 1985, Crane died in a Pauma Valley hospital in California only a day shy of his 69th birthday. Anemia was announced of his cause of death.Thackery, Ted, Jr. “Steve Crane, 68, Lana Turner’s Ex, Dies.” Los Angeles Times. 7 February 1984. While he did contribute to the entertainment field, Crane's legacy lies in his restaurants. Crane's innovative and high-profile restaurants helped to solidify the Polynesian pop culture of the 1950s and 1960s and remain symbolic of that legacy.

Puisseguin- Saint-Émilion is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for wine in the Bordeaux wine region of France, where it is situated in the Libourne subregion on the right bank of the Dordogne. It was granted AOC status on 14 November 1936, and the AOC designation granted to the wines which have been harvested on the land of the Puisseguin commune. of vine planted areas have belonged to the appellation in 2005, with a production of 34,648 hl. Puisseguin-Saint- Émilion only produces red wine, and nearly all of the grape varieties from Bordeaux can be and are used, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Côt, etc., although it is Merlot that is used most often. Like the vineyards of Montagne, the vineyards of Puisseguin are located in the area northeast of Saint-Émilion on the right bank of the Barbanne. Together with Lussac-Saint-Émilion, Saint-Georges-Saint-Émilion and Montagne-Saint-Émilion, it is one of the \\"satellites\\" of Saint-Émilion. The base yield is fixed at 45 hl/hectare with a limit of 20%. Before the chaptalization and concentration process, the must (the residue of grapes, after the juice has been extracted) must contain a minimum of 187g/l of natural sugar. After fermentation, the wine must have a minimum alcohol level of 11% vol. Grape varieties Traditionally, the wines of Puisseguin-Saint-Émilion are a collection of different grape varieties. The three main varieties being Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon: * Merlot - the most dominant grape variety, accounting for 80% of the planted area. It is a variety that ripens early, and needs cool and humid conditions as well as soil rich in clay. It ripens well and gives wine its colour, a good alcoholic richness, a full bodied texture and is smooth and round on the palette. * Cabernet Franc - an important element of the Libourne plantations and represents nearly 15% of the blend at Saint-Émilion. Of medium precocity, it is grown mostly in chalky or quite warm soils. It gives the wine an aromatic flavour, lightly spiced, with a coolness and tannic structure, giving the wine an aged flavour. * Cabernet Sauvignon - representing around 5% of the plantations, it is a grape that is particularly adapted to warm and dry soil (gravel, sand, clay or chalky soil). It gives wine a gently spiced flavour, complex with a tannic richness, favourable to its long and harmonious preservation. The AOC regulations for Puisseguin- Saint-Émilion also allows the use of two other grape varieties: the Malbec (or côt) and the Carménère. Only the Malbec grape is still used.

He was an Indian Islamic scholar, author, journalist and activist and former Secretary for Dawah, Jamaat-e-Islami Hind. His specialisation is in comparative studies of Hindu scriptures and literature with Islamic literature. He stays in Delhi. After retirement from the Jamaat he is engaged in translation of rare Islamic manuscripts into the Hindi language. Recently he has translated Bukhari in three volumes. He belongs to the famous Deobandi Muslim family of Maulana Husain Ahmad Madani. Biography Kausar Yazdani was born 1935 in Katalpur, Azamgarh district of Uttar Pradesh. His father was in the police department and retired when he was studying in class VII. He did his metrication in 1951, BA in 1955 from Shibli College and married in his own family in the same year. Then he entered in the practical life. Education He completed his graduation from Shibli College, Azamgarh, and Masters and doctorate of philosophy (PhD) in the Hindi language from Agra University. He is also completed Aalimiat from Sunni Muslim seminary called Nadwatul Ulema, Lucknow, and Fazeelat from Rampur. The topic of his PhD was Sufi Darshan evam Sadhna ka Kramik Vikas tatha Kutban, Manjhan evam Jaysee. (Development of Mysticism in Hindi with reference to the Poetry of Kutban, Manjhan and Jaysee). Association and activism with Jamat Islami Hind Yazdani came into the contact of Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH), when he was in Intermediate at Tanda. Jamaat was writing new chapters in Islamic dawah and awakening for non- Muslims as well as Muslims. He learnt, Islam is for everybody. Yazdani, whose subject in BA was not Hindi, chose Hindi journalism as his lifelong career under the influence of the Islamic movement. At that time, Muslims of north India had a hate relationship with Hindi. Urdu had not become their preferred language but it was crushed just after the Independence. It is a historical fact that Urdu was vastly used in government and non-government works before 1947. But its use stopped in government offices, its teaching banned in schools and other educational institutions and it was labelled as anti-Indian. It place was given to Hindi, which was finally declared the official language of the province in 1951 by Congress government in UP, under its chief minister Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant. But no reciprocal safeguard was given to Urdu language. Yazdani chose Hindi as his first love. Jamaat decided to publish a Hindi magazine and called him for the job in 1956-7. After some preparations 'Kanti' monthly started its publication in 1958. It became a weekly after a decade and changed its place of publication from Rampur to Delhi. When Nadvi joined the Kanti, he did not know the Arabic language. But as he chose the dawah path, he decided to learn Arabic and studied the language from Maulana Salman Qasmi at Rampur. Then he took three years leave to study Arabic and Islamic sciences at Nadwa College, Lucknow. Jamaat chief Maulana Abul laisJamaat-e-Islami Hind: HISTORY AND BACKGROUND allowed him to work from Lucknow and granted him the required leave. Maulana Syed Abul Hasan Ali Nadvi gave special permission to enroll him for Almiat. He cleared all the papers in one year and got Almiat degree. Later he completed his Fazilat at Rampur. Kanti was banned during emergency and its editor was jailed for few months. In this critical period he did his MA in Hindi Literature and a PhD in 1980. His thesis was on Sufism and Sadhna. Kanti was divided into weekly and monthly in the same year. Weekly was generally for Muslims and monthly was for non- Muslims. But according to Nadvi, its readership were prominently Muslims, although non-Muslims also read it. He remained its editor for about 37 years and left it in 1995. Nadvi told us that 'generally Hindus have a little or no interest for understanding Islam. We reached them and explained its message'. So its circulation in his time remained between 3 and 5 thousands. It published extracts from the Quran and Hadith, episodes from Islamic history and true principles of Islam. It also tried to remove misunderstandings against Islam and Muslims. It had one or two short stories. After 1968, political and social issues increased considerably. Then it became a weekly. To a query, whether Kanti criticised Hindu Dharam also former editor replied that we criticised very little and never made such criticism a formal topic. 'It was not appropriate in the early phase of Dawah'. Islam's fundamental teachings were introduced in a positive way, polytheism was mildly criticised. If reverse was done, it could have caused a riot and then nobody would have heard our message, he explained. He concluded that when Islam would be described in more details, in the next phase of our dawah, such criticism may increase, then it would be relevant.

The 118th ASOS provides Tactical Command and Control of air power assets to the Joint Forces Air Component Commander and Joint Forces Land Component Commander for combat operations.  History  The 118th Air Support Operations Squadron (ASOS) at the Stanly County Airport was originally formed as the 118th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (118th ACWS), of Charlotte, North Carolina. The Detachment of the squadron that would become the 118th ASOS was initially formed in Wadesboro, North Carolina, and designated Detachment A. While designated the 118th ACWS the unit was ordered to active duty during the Korean War with three squadrons of the Georgia Air National Guard on January 8, 1951. On January 2, 1952, the 118th ACWS arrived in French Morocco, North Africa, and set up operations about from the city of Casablanca. Unit personnel calibrated numerous early warning radar sites for the Strategic Air Command in the Sahara, and in the Atlas mountains in Morocco. From October 8, 1952, until 1999 the unit functioned as a separate state of the art Communications Squadron. In 1999 the Air Force realizing a shortfall, chose to re-role the 118th Combat Communications Squadron into the 118th Air Support Operations Squadron. With this new mission the unit has gone from a front line communications unit to a unit in direct support of the Army war fighter. The 118th ASOS currently is tasked with supporting both the North and South Carolina Army National Guard units.

It grows in two communes: Quincy and Brinay in the department of Cher.  History = Antiquity  The etymology of Quincy is thought to come from the Roman name, domaine de Quintius. The Bituriges cultivated the land since ancient times.Site de 1001 dégustations (page sur Quincy), consulté le 5 décembre 2009.  Middle-Ages  In 1120, the wine of Quincy was named in a speech by Pope Calixtus II and the Sauvignon blanc introduced by the monks at Cîteaux Abbey.Historique de l'AOC sur le site du domaine de Villain , consulté le 4 décembre 2009.  Contemporary Times  After the consecutive replanting of the vineyards because of the Phylloxera epidemic, Quincy was the first commune to be awarded an AOC in this part of the Loire region, on 6 August 1936.  Geographical Location = Localisation  The Quincy vineyard is situated in the Champagne bérrichonnein the Cher department, between Bourges and Vierzon. It is planted on a plateau of the right bank of the river Cher. Extending from North to South, the East side of it is exposed, divided between the communes of Quincy and Brinay.  Pedology and orography  The vineyard was planted on a Kimmeridgian marly plateau, hanging over the Cher River. It is covered by a mixture of alluvium silica-clay soil. This mixture drains away the excess water and the in-depth marl cover preserves water, protecting it from a dry period. The soil has three layers: a soil made up of sand and gravel on an underlay of clay, a sandy soil covered by red sand and a sandy-silt soil on a clayey-sand or clay with slightly sandy soil.  Climate  The vineyards benefits from the relatively warm and dry local climate.Sources: INAO  Vineyards = Grape varieties  Quincy white wine is only made using the Sauvignon grape. Sauvignon blanc is the main grape planted, while the closely related Sauvignon gris grape represents 10% of the planted surfaces. The not so fertile soil reduces the exuberance of the Sauvignon vegetation well. Harvesting control also ensures optimum maturity of the grape.  Viticulture  The Sauvignon grapes are grown in long trellises to help manage its capricious and low fertility. The single Guyot is limited to a number of 10 vine eyes for support while the double Guyot has 12 vine eyes. With cordon training, or cordon de Royat, a maximum of 14 vine eyes are used, split on two heads of a maximum of 2 vine eyes. The plantation density must be more than 5,500 vines per hectare. The distance between rows cannot exceed 1.45 metres and the distance between vines on a row must be between 0.90 and 1.25 metres. Foliage trellising is compulsory and must not exceed 0.6 times the space between the rows. This height is measured between 10 cm under the string and the height of trimming. Irrigation is forbidden, as is weeding of the gaps and embankments.  Harvesting  It can be carried out by sorting the grapes out manually or by using a machine to pick the grapes from the vine. The harvesting of vines that are less than three years old cannot be used for wines of the AOC. The amount of sugar in the grape must be less than 170 grams per litre and the potential degree of the juice should be less than 12.5% volume. The permitted yield of the appellation is 65 hectolitres per hectare. It can be 75 hl/ha as an exception, but it is the maximum yield.  Wine making  After it has been picked, the grape is pressed as early as possible. The must is left to undergo a cold stabilisation before fermentation takes place in a tank. After fermentation, ageing of the non-fermented matter sometimes happens in fermentation vats.  Marketing  In 2006, production was 12,283 hl. Quincy is mainly sold to the French market; however, exports represents 20% of the production.  Wines  The AOC is only used for dry white wine. It can be delicate and fruity (citrusy), with hints of white flowers and pepper. It is a wine which keeps its quality for at least 4 or 5 years, although ageing does not improve the initial quality. This wine is best accompanied with seafood and fish from the Loire or after a meal with goat's cheese from the region such as Valençay, Pouligny-Saint-Pierre or Crottin de Chavignol.Sources: Centre INAO de Sancerre  Notes and references  Category:Loire AOCs ","title":"Quincy AOC"},{"id":"26616937","text":"Helen Taylor (31 July 1831 – 29 January 1907) was an English feminist, writer and actress. She was the daughter of Harriet Taylor Mill and stepdaughter of John Stuart Mill. After the death of her mother she lived and worked with Mill, and together they promoted women's rights. From 1876 to 1884 (when she quit due to her health) she was a member of the London School Board. In 1881, she joined the Democratic Federation. She was a supporter of women's suffrage and joined a petition to that effect from 1865, an inspiration for suffragists. Life Helen Taylor was born at Kent Terrace, London, on 27 July 1831, was only daughter and youngest of three children of John Taylor, wholesale druggist of Mark Lane, and his wife Harriet, daughter of Thomas Hardy of Birksgate, near Kirkburton, Yorkshire, where the family had been lords of the manor for centuries. Taylor, a man of education, inspired his daughter with a lifelong love for history and strong filial affection from an early age. Helen's education was pursued desultorily and privately. She was the constant companion of her mother, who, owing to poor health, was continually travelling. Mrs. Taylor's letters to her daughter, shortly to be published, testify to deep sympathy between the two. Helen's father died in July 1849, and in April 1851 her mother married John Stuart Mill. Her mother, Harriet Taylor Mill, wanted Helen to be free to do \\"what she hoped all women would one day have the liberty to do: to work at a job of her own choosing. The 'experiments in living' that Harriet and John encouraged in On Liberty began with her own daughter\\", Helen.Jacobs, Jo Ellen (2002). The Voice of Harriet Taylor Mill. Indiana University Press, p. 179. Helen followed her dream of becoming an actress and went to work at Sunderland in 1856 and worked as an actress for two years.Jacobs, Jo Ellen (2002). The Voice of Harriet Taylor Mill. Indiana University Press. Harriet Taylor Mill died on 3 November 1858 at the Hotel de l'Europe, Avignon, when on the way with her husband to the south of France. In order to be near his wife's grave Mill bought a house at Avignon, which subsequently passed to Helen Taylor. Taylor now devoted herself entirely to Mill, and became his \\"chief comfort\\" and he valued her intelligent input. She not only took entire charge of practical matters and of his heavy correspondence, answering many of his letters herself, but also may have co-operated in his literary work, especially in The Subjection of Women (1869), much of which might have been suggested by her mother. Mill used to say of all his later work that it was the result not of one intelligence, but of three, of himself, his wife, and his step-daughter. Mill died in 1873. Taylor, who had edited in 1872, with a biographical notice, the miscellaneous and posthumous works of H. T. Buckle, a devoted adherent of Mill's school of thought, edited in 1873 Mill's Autobiography; and in 1874 she issued, with an introduction, his essays, Nature, The Utility of Religion, Theism.  Political activism  Mill's death left Taylor free to enter public life and so further the social and political reforms in which her step-father had stirred her interest. Possessed of ample means, which she generously employed in public causes, she made her home in London, while spending her holidays at the house at Avignon which Mill left her. On all subjects her opinions were radical. Her principles were at once democratic and strongly individualist, but she favoured what she deemed practicable in the socialist programme. A fine speaker in public, she fought hard for the redress of poverty and injustice. Mill had refused, in 1870, through lack of time, the invitation of the Southwark Radical Association to become its candidate for the newly established London School Board. In 1876, Taylor accepted a like request, and was returned at the head of the poll after a fierce conflict. Although a section of liberals opposed her on account of her advanced opinions, her eloquence and magnetic personality won the support of all shades of religious and political faith. Taylor was again returned at the head of the poll both in 1879 and 1882. She retired in 1884 owing to ill-health, but during her nine years' service she scarcely missed a meeting. Taylor's educational programme included the abolition of school fees, the provision of food and shoes and stockings to necessitous children, the abolition of corporal punishment, smaller classes, and a larger expenditure on all things essential to the development of the child and the health of the teacher. While Taylor was a member of the board, she provided at her own expense, through the teachers and small local committees, a midday meal and a pair of serviceable boots to necessitous children in Southwark. Taylor was a prominent member of the endowment committee of the board, and was successful in inducing the charity commissioners to restore some educational endowments to their original purposes. St Pauls Childrens Home (in 1903 after it was renamed) A zealous advocate of the reform of the industrial schools, Taylor, Elizabeth Surr and Florence Fenwick Miller brought to public notice in 1882 certain scandals imputed to St. Paul's Industrial School. Thomas Scrutton owned the school, food intended for the boys was diverted to the governor and the staff, the boys were not clothed or fed well, there was excessive punishments including manacles and handcuffs. Taylor accused Scrutton of taking some of the money and for being responsible for the deaths of boys at the St Paul's school. The home secretary instituted an inquiry, and the school was ordered to be closed. In June 1882, Thomas Scrutton, a member of the school board and chairman of its industrial schools sub-committee, brought an action for libel against Taylor. Sir Henry Hawkins was the judge, Sir Edward George Clarke was Taylor's counsel, Sir Charles Russell, afterwards Lord Russell of Killowen, was for the plaintiff. On the fourth day, 30 June, Taylor's case broke down on the plea of justification, and she paid the plaintiff £1,000 by consent. The judge acknowledged Taylor's public spirit and exonerated her from any personal malice. The actions brought about a reform of the London industrial schools. Scrutton had to resign as chair and later as a member of the school board. At the same time, Taylor threw herself with equal energy into political agitation. Taylor was active in opposition to the Irish coercion policy of the liberal government of 1880–5, and was one of the most energetic supporters of the English branch of the Irish Ladies' Land League, frequently presiding at its meetings both in England and Ireland. Anna Parnell, Irish nationalist and younger sister of Irish Nationalist leader, Charles Stewart Parnell, was often Taylor's guest. The causes of land nationalisation and the taxation of land values powerfully appealed to Taylor. Taylor became a leading member of the Land Reform Union, and of the League for Taxing Land Values, addressing in their behalf large audiences, chiefly of working men, both in England and Ireland. Taylor's enthusiasm for land nationalisation brought her the acquaintance of Henry George, the American promoter of the policy. He stayed at Taylor's house in South Kensington in 1882. In his opinion she was \\"one of the most intelligent women I ever met, if not the most intelligent\\". In 1881, Taylor's faith in the practicability of certain socialist proposals led her to take part in the preliminary meetings for the establishment of the Democratic Federation, the forerunner of the Social Democratic Federation. Taylor joined the first executive committee. Already, in anticipation of the federation's aims, Taylor had given practical support to labour candidates for parliament. She personally attended on George Odger, the first labour candidate, during his last illness in 1877.  Women's suffrage  Taylor consistently advocated female suffrage, a policy her stepfather also supported in thinking not only should a woman's marital status not affect her right to a vote, but believing that it would generally improve the morals of the people. Taylor was part of the Kensington Society of women who debated such issues from 1865, and eventually morphed into the London Society for Women's Suffrage. And although interested in making changes by serving politically, on 15 August 1878, writing from Avignon,Taylor positively denied a rumour that she intended to seek nomination as a parliamentary candidate for Southwark. In 1885, however, special circumstances led her to try for a parliamentary candidature. Mr. W. A. Coote, the secretary of the Vigilance Association (which Taylor closely associated with herself), sought nomination as Liberal candidate for Camberwell North, but was finally set aside by the party organisers. By way of protest, Taylor took Mr. Coote's place, with Ethel Leach serving as her election agent. Taylor's programme included just and better laws for women, the prevention of war, and \\"less work and better pay\\" for the working classes. A letter of support from Henry George advocating her candidature was widely circulated during her campaign. George Jacob Holyoake was an active worker for Taylor's election. Taylor carried on her campaign amid much turbulence until the nomination day, when the returning officer refused to receive either the nomination papers or the cash deposit for his expenses. In Taylor's electoral contest, she attempted what no woman had done before, and what would not become legal - for a woman to become an MP for another 34 years. ( 'Crossing the Border of Citizenship: Helen Taylor the Independent Radical Candidate for Camberwell North, 1885,' DOI: http://doi.org/10.16995/olh.540). Taylor was also one of the driving forces, encouraged by Barbara Bodichon, behind a petition signed by 1,499 women in 1866 to extend the vote to all householders, not just men, which some regard as the start of the strong suffragist/suffragette movement in Britain (a copy of the petition is held at the London School of Economics) and states amongst other things: > That the participation of women in the Government is consistent with the > principles of the British Constitution, inasmuch as women in these islands > have always been held capable of sovereignty, and women are eligible for > various public offices. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray your > honourable House to consider the expediency of providing for the > representation of all householders, without distinction of sex, who possess > such property or rental qualification as your honourable House may > determine. Shortly after the 1882 election effort, Taylor relinquished public work, owing to age and failing health, and retired for some nineteen years to her house at Avignon, where she had invariably spent her holidays and where she endeared herself to the people by her generous benefactions. The stress of work told on Taylor's appearance as well as on her health. At the end of 1904, Taylor returned to England, and under the care of her niece, Mary Taylor, and settled at Torquay. She died there on 29 January 1907, and was buried in the Torquay cemetery. In 1904, at the insistence of Lord Morley of Blackburn, she presented Mill's library to Somerville College, Oxford.

Formed at the turn of the nineteenth century, it worships in an early nineteenth-century building constructed by a future governor of Kentucky, and it counted among its earliest members a governor of Ohio. The building has been named a historic site. Organic history In the first years after the congregation's 1800 organization, the members worshipped along Eagle Creek outside West Union, but they began working to move into West Union in 1809. From the beginning of its history, the congregation suffered from dissension and apostasy: some of the members, including their pastor John Dunlevy, defected to the Shakers in 1805, and Presbyterian minister William Williamson from nearby far northern Lewis County, Kentucky was left to lead the remaining members. These individuals feuded among themselves, many leaving to join an Associate Reformed Presbyterian congregation at Cherry Fork,Evans, Nelson W., and Emmons B. Stivers.

Nevertheless, the remnant resolved to build a new church building in the village of West Union, and under the leadership of elders Joseph Darlinton and Thomas Kirker, a subscription list was signed in 1809. The final cost of construction to the congregation was $500, of which half was paid to general contractor Thomas Metcalfe, a master mason and the future Governor of Kentucky.First Presbyterian Church, Ohio Historical Society, 2002. Accessed 2015-12-25. As the congregation became more solidly established, it was served by a succession of ministers who used their positions to oppose slavery prominently; William Williamson and his initial successors Dyer Burgess and John Van Dyke advocated abolitionist positions, and nationally prominent abolitionist John Rankin, minister of the Presbyterian church in nearby Ripley, was welcomed as a guest preacher in 1830.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 7. Throughout this period, and continuing until his 1837 death, Thomas Kirker was among the leading lights both within the congregation and in the surrounding community: he owned the land on Eagle Creek where the congregation first worshipped, he served as an elder from 1808 until his life's end, and he held a succession of political offices — delegate to the first constitutional convention in 1802, as the Northwest Territory prepared for statehood, state representative for Adams County in 1803, state senator from 1803 until 1815, and governor of Ohio (ex officio as the Speaker of the Senate) from 1807 until 1808. His activity in the congregation, together with the responsibility of Thomas Metcalfe for the building's construction, later led the church to be nicknamed the \\"Church of the Governors\\". Membership in 2013 was seventy-two, having fallen by more than sixty over the previous ten years, and that year's average worship attendance of twenty-nine represented a decline of more than fifty percent since 2003.First, West Union, OH, PC(USA) Research Services, 2014.

In 1976, the West Union Presbyterian Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its connection to Metcalfe. It is one of three Register-listed buildings in West Union, along with the Cockerill House and the Tet Woods Building, and one of several Metcalfe-built structures with the same designation.

The ruling came after Justice Teare stated that Ablyazov “cannot be trusted” not to dissipate his assets prior to trial.Kazakh Banker Loses Courtroom Battle Over Assets - The Guardian, Simon Goodley, 3 December 2010 Ablyazov argued, in his defense, that the takeover of BTA Bank by Samruk- Kazyna in February 2009 was “the culmination of the campaign by President Nazarbayev and his allies to wrest ownership and control of [BTA] from [Ablyazov].”Court documents allege 'corrupt' Kazakhstan regime's link to FTSE firms - The Guardian, Simon Goodley, 2 December 2010. Judge Teare reasoned that BTA's bank's nationalisation and debt restructuring created a legal and fiduciary duty to its Western creditors to recover missing assets. In a May 2011 letter, Ablyazov accused Nazarbaev and his advisor Bulat Utemuratov of being the real owners of a 48.73% share in Kazzinc, a firm that Glencore International was planning to buy at the time. Ablyazov wrote that “in 2005-2009, when Mr. Utemuratov was blackmailing me on behalf of” Nazarbaev, demanding a share in BTA Bank, “he asked me to transfer the stocks to the companies that control KazZink now.” Ablyazov said that he had testified to this effect in a London court. Ablyazov was granted asylum in the UK in July 2011, a recognition that he would face political persecution if sent back to Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan's request for his extradition was ignored. According to the Daily Telegraph, the Kazakh government threatened to punish British firms by awarding lucrative contracts to China if the UK granted Ablyazov asylum. \\\\- The Daily Telegraph, 22 August 2010 In early 2012, Kazakh authorities sought to implicate Ablyazov in an alleged terror plot. One report suggested that an “obvious reason for trying to nail Ablyazov” was that “unlike other political figures in exile, he has a presence inside Kazakhstan through his links to an opposition group and local media outlets.” The accusation was, according to this report, “designed to tarnish his reputation – and that of his associates, too – in the eyes of the international community,” as well as to provide “a useful distraction from the embarrassment which the government suffered after violence in the western town of Janaozen in December [2011], in which its police force is accused of opening fire on protesters, killing 14 and injuring over 100.” The report said that “authorities seem dead set on eliminating Ablyazov’s capacity to exert any influence in Kazakstan (sic).” In November 2012, a U.K. court ordered Mukhtar Ablyazov to pay £1.02 bln ($1.63 bln) plus interest. The court also ordered \\"new post-judgment asset-freezing orders be made against Mr. Ablyazov in an unlimited sum and new asset-freezing orders in relation to certain other defendants.\\" The High Court made judgment upon Ilyas Khrapunov to pay damages of US$500m (US$424,110,000 + interest of US$75,851,783.01) for conspiring with Ablyazov to move assets in breach of the freezing order. Arrest Warrants The UK High Court issued an arrest warrant for Ablyazov on February 16, 2012, and a second arrest warrant July 25, 2019. =Criminal Court of Kazakhstan= Mukhtar Ablyazov was sentenced to 20 years in prison in June 2017. An appeals court upheld the indictment for criminal conspiracy, embezzlement and money laundering. =Southern District of New York= City of Almaty, Kazahkstan v. Mukhtar Ablyazov was filed on July 9, 2015 in the Southern District of New York federal court with Judge Alison Julie Nathan presiding. Court documents show that the Plaintiffs are seeking to depose Ablyazov in New York, the UK, Spain or France, and that Ablyazov has not yet produced documents in discovery effectively stonewalling the court. Ablyazov wrote to the federal judge in February 2019 that he cannot provide documents to the court because he left them in the U.K. in 2012. The Plaintiffs responded that Ablyazov has obstructed discovery and indeed documents are in possession by Ablyazov's U.K. lawyers and he could instruct their release to the court. Court fillings allege that Ilyas Khrapunov deleted email accounts and failed to produce documents about his real-estate deals by ignoring U.S. court's order to preserve evidence. The deleted emails give details to the embezzlement of BTA Bank funds by Ablyazov and Viktor Khrapunov. Wells Fargo has been subpoenaed for transactions history of Gennady Petelin specific to New York real estate investments made with the allegedly stolen BTA Bank funds. The co-defendant, Triadou SPV S.A., has stated to the court that the capital for NYC real estate did not include BTA stolen funds, rather loans from Telford International Limited, a shell company capitalized and operated by Petelin. Telford International Limited is identified in the Panama Papers as registered in Samoa. The court ordered Ablyazov to pay the plaintiffs attorneys' fees for depositions and associated procedures. =U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia= BTA Bank filed suit in 2016 in U.S. federal court in Virginia against the sister of Ablyazov, Gaukhar Kussainova, for allegedly receiving millions in funds originating from BTA Bank. The BTA Bank claim against Kussainova in federal court is that she received more than $6 million of stolen BTA Bank funds from Ablyazov and used the stolen monies to buy business and real estate assets in the USA. Gaukhar Kussainova is the owner of a 7,349 square foot house on a 40,000 square foot lot valued at more than $2.1 million in Fairfax, Virginia. =Fairfax Circuit Court, 19th Judicial Circuit of Virginia= A jury reached a verdict in a trial and recognized the Receivership order issued by the High Court of England & Wales and same court's judgements totaling $4.7 billion against Ablyazov. The verdict added $7.3 million to the judgements against Ablyazov. =Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court= Ablyazov application to the BVI court that two judgements by the English High Court not be enforced in the British Virgin Islands did not hold up in opinion of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, and were enforceable. =Supreme Court of Seychelles= The Supreme Court of Seychelles ruled on 2011 October 13 that the English Receivership Order from the English High Court proceedings between BTA Bank and Ablyazov was enforceable in the jurisdiction of the Republic of Seychelles. Ablyazov made two appeals: the first that the judge erred by wrongly applied law and that Ablyazov was not present and thereby denied the right to fair hearing. The second appeal that eleven companies are exempted in the Seychelles from reach of the receivership order enforcement. Each of the appeals were dismissed. =Moscow Tagansky District Court= A criminal case against Ablyazov will be heard in-absentia in Moscow Tagansky District Court. Related Court ProceedingsJSC BTA Bank v Khrapunov (Appellant)= Ablyazov's son-in-law and co-defendant, Ilyas Khrapunov, appealed the judgements in JSC BTA Bank v. Ablyazov & Ors on grounds that the English court had no jurisdiction because all the acts, and conspiracy of acts, that caused the bank economic harm occurred outside England. Money Laundering through New York City Real Estate A 2015 suit to recover embezzled funds was filed in the Southern District of New York listing Ablyazov, Viktor Khrapunov, Joseph Chetrit and The Chetrit Group as defendants. The suit alleged that the Chetrit Group helped Ablyazov and Khrapunov hide $40 million in two condo conversion projects. The Chetrit Group went on to settle with the Plaintiffs (the city of Almaty and BTA Bank) and became witnesses for the prosecution. Silk Road Group While Ablyazov was BTA Chairman, the bank partnered on investment projects in Georgia with the Silk Road Group, a company with a history of alleged financial fraud and money laundering. During Ablyazov's chairmanship, and at the time of alleged financial mismanagement, BTA Bank loans were made to Silk Road Group projects or Silk Road Group owned- companies. In 2014 Silk Road Group collaborated with former BTA Bank executive Yerkin Tatishev and Ablyazov business partner to repay outstanding BTA Bank loans. He and the Silk Road Group co-owned a Georgian bank creating a conflict of interest. The Silk Road Group was revealed to be a client of the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, which specialized in offshore corporate structuring, accounting for purpose of sanction and tax evasion, and subject of the Panama Papers. The Silk Road Group entered an agreement with the Trump Organization to license the Trump brand for two luxury developments in Batumi and Tbilisi, Georgia. The deal was cancelled when Trump became president to avoid a conflict of interest. The Silk Road Group received loans from BTA Bank while Ablyazov was bank chairman, and Trump Organization involvement with SRG may be subject of Robert Mueller investigation into collusion with the Russian government and the Trump campaign. Alleged Murder for Hire The man convicted of manslaughter for accidentally shooting banker Yerzhan Tatishev on a hunting trip in 2004 said in a 2017 television documentary that he was in fact hired by Ablyazov to kill Tatishev who was Ablyazov's BTA Bank partner and shareholder. The Kazakh Prosecutor General indicted Ablyazov on 17 August 2018 for the murder of former BTA Bank Chairman Erzhan Tatishev. Ablyazov was convicted in November 2018 for the murder of Tatishev and sentenced to life prison. Political career Ablyazov's first interests in politics was in 1987 when he engaged in social activities and founded a political club, believing that the Soviet Union wasn't being developed properly at the Kazakh National University where he was a junior researcher. The club attracted young people, political scientists, and philosophers. There, after leading a discussion, Ablyazov was accused of spreading anti-Soviet propaganda and was, along with his peers, detained the following day by the KGB although Ablyazov suffered no consequences due to the fact that Gorbachev's Perestroika reforms in allowing greater political freedom was already beginning to take shape at that time.https://www.neweurasia.info/extra-1/2063- In November 2001, Ablyazov and other colleagues, including fellow disenchanted proteges of Nazarbyaev, co-founded the Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan (QDT), an opposition political movement that challenged the Nazarbayev regime. The QDT included a combination of existing politicians and major businessmen and called for the decentralisation of political power, a strong legislature, and an independent judiciary to balance the power concentrated in the executive branch. This opposition initiative, according to RFE/RL, “quickly drew the wrath of the regime.” In July 2002, as one of the main leaders of the QDT, Ablyazov was convicted of “abusing official powers as a minister” and sentenced to six years in prison. Also sent to prison were his fellow would-be reformers and former Nazarbaev proteges Galymzhan Zhakiyanov and Altynbek Sarsenbauyly. In response to pressure from the international community, including Amnesty International and the European Parliament,Living in fear in London - Evening Standard, 25 August 2010 he was released in May 2003 after only serving ten months, on the condition that he renounce politics. Ablyazov moved to Moscow in 2003 to rebuild his business ties and in 2005 became the Chairman of the Board of Directors of BTA Bank. After his release from prison, Ablyazov reportedly spent “millions of dollars funding opposition groups and independent media.” RFE/RL has quoted Yevgeny Zhovtis, head of the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law, as saying that “Nazarbayev to a certain extent felt betrayed” by Ablyazov and the others, given that “he thinks that he provided them the space to become wealthy, to become well-known, to make a career in state service or in business, and they challenged him. When he pardoned Ablyazov in 2003 and allowed him to return to business in exchange for a promise not to be involved in politics and then found out that he was again involved in politics, of course Nazarbayev felt betrayed twice.” While living in Russia and Kazakhstan, Ablyazov was the target of assassination attempts and an effort was made to kidnap his son from school. BTA Bank efforts Shortly thereafter, Kazakhstan's sovereign wealth fund, Samruk-Kazyna, injected significant funds into BTA in an effort to keep the bank solvent, effectively becoming its majority shareholder. It has been argued that BTA Bank “threatened to dominate the other Kazakh banks – banks that Nazarbayev controlled” and that the bank's forced nationalization in 2009 was part of an effort by Nazarbayev “to dispose of Ablyazov.” Living in United Kingdom Following the issuing of the Kazakh warrant, Ablyazov left Kazakhstan for London. This made him, according to RFE/RL, one of “dozens of former high-ranking Kazakh officials who have fled abroad after falling out of favor.” Ablyazov is described to have lived sumptuously in London. However, a High Court judge held Ablyazov in contempt and imposed three prison sentences for failing to disclose assets including a nine-bedroom mansion in London's \\"Billionaire's Row\\" and a 100-acre estate in Windsor Great Park. He rented a 15,000 square foot mansion on Bishop's Avenue in London. During his time in London, Ablyazov told The Standard that he was an “innocent...victim of persecution” by Nazarbaev and was “in fear of his life from his country's secret police, the KNB.” Claiming to be innocent of all charges, he “employed tight security to protect him from murder attempts” while living in London. Once, while he was being driven in London, a car “rammed his vehicle repeatedly.” While in Britain, Ablyazov maintained close ties to opposition media in Kazakhstan. RFE/RL has noted that in 2011, the broadcaster K+ and the newspapers Vzglyad and Golos Respubliki, along with other private Kazakh media with ties to Ablyazov, “gave full-scale coverage to the bloody police crackdown on striking oil workers in the western city of Zhanaozen.” Not long after, Kazakh courts ordered these media outlets closed, along with the opposition Algha party, headed by Avladimir Kozlov, an Ablyazov ally, who was sentenced to a long prison term. The Nazarbaev government reportedly considered Ablyazov to be implicated in these media outlets' critical coverage. Also during his time in Britain, Ablyazov was the main source of funding for Aksara, an independent theater company whose productions challenge the Nazarbaev government and seek to provide an alternative to the state-subsidized theater, which takes a pro-government stance. In 2012, a British judge ordered Ablyazov imprisoned for purportedly lying in court about his financial assets. Shortly thereafter, Ablyazov left Britain. It was charged that he exited the country in order to avoid imprisonment. His lawyers, however, said that he left because he had received a death threat. The lawyers further maintained that Ablyazov “did not embezzle the $6 billion claimed by the Kazakh government, but restructured the bank's holdings in order to protect them from precisely the kind of government takeover that took place in 2009.” Since his departure from Britain, it has been unclear where Ablyazov is living, although he was widely believed to have gone to France. Deportation of Ablyazov's wife and daughter The wife and daughter of Muktar Ablyazov were deported by Italy in May 2013 for allegedly staying in the country illegally. They were found to have false Central African Republic passports. The Italian media blamed the Interior Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister of Italy, Angelino Alfano simultaneously,, for the illegal deportation. He is also a member of the centre-right party ‘The People of Freedom’ headed by Silvio Berlusconi, known for his friendly relations with the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev. The president of Italy, Giorgio Napolitano, expressed his stark criticism of the deportation of Alma Shalabayeva. He noted that the decision to deport her was made without necessary verification or thorough examination of the situation by the Italian bodies: “For any country, it is unacceptable to give in to the pressure and interference of foreign diplomacy, which resulted in the hasty expulsion of a mother and child from Italy on the basis of distorted information. I also believe that we need to fully guarantee fundamental rights of persons, regardless of the status which they have in our country”. On 24 December 2013, a representative of the Kazakh Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced a change in the restriction of liberty measure for Alma Shalabayeva and the withdrawal of her prohibition from leaving Almaty. Shalabayeva and her daughter, Alua received their passports and left Kazakhstan. On 18 April 2014, the Italian authorities granted Ablyazov’s wife and daughter refugee status. Alma and Alua received a 5-year renewable permit of stay. The decision on the award of refugee status was made by the Territorial Commission in Rome for Recognition of International Protection, under Article 1 of the Geneva Convention. Ablyazov supporters From July 2013 to December 2016, Ablyazov was detained by French authorities, as Russia sought Ablyazov's extradition from France, but Ablyazov argued that extradition would place him at risk of ill- treatment and an unfair trial. Human rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, as well as many members of the European Parliament, wrote in opposition to extradition of Ablyazov. In 2015, a French court in Lyon issued an extradition order. However, in December 2016, France's highest administrative court, the Conseil d'Etat, canceled the extradition order, on the ground that Russia had a political motive in making the extradition request. Ablyazov was released from the Fleury-Merogis prison. Personal life During his time in London, Ablyazov was described as not fitting “the Western stereotype of the fabulously wealthy businessman from the old Soviet Union. No bling, no yachts, no trophy wife and no ostentatious cars, he cuts a modest figure, favouring Marks and Spencer suits.” References Category:1963 births Category:Kazakhstani prisoners and detainees Category:Prisoners and detainees of Kazakhstan Category:Kazakhstani businesspeople Category:Living people Category:Kazakhstani emigrants to Russia Category:Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan politicians Category:Ministers of Energy (Kazakhstan) Category:Government ministers of Kazakhstan ","title":"Mukhtar Ablyazov"},{"id":"26617091","text":"The Bordeaux wine region.

Saint-Georges-Saint-Émilion only produces red wine, and nearly all of the grape varieties from Bordeaux can be and are used, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Côt, etc., although it is Merlot that is used most often. The appellation is in an area, north of Saint-Émilion, on the right bank of the river Barbanne and is included in the vineyard of Montagne. With the vineyards of Lussac-Saint-Émilion, Montagne- Saint-Émilion and Puisseguin-Saint-Émilion, it forms part of the \\"satellites\\" of Saint-Émilion. The base yield is fixed at 45 hl/hectare with a limit of 20%.

After fermentation, the wine must have a minimum alcohol level of 11% vol. Grape varieties Traditionally, the wines of Saint-Georges-Saint-Émilion are a collection of different grape varieties. The three main varieties being Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon: * Merlot - the most dominant grape variety, accounting for 75% of the planted area. It is a variety that ripens early, and needs cool and humid conditions as well as soil rich in clay. It ripens well and gives wine its colour, a good alcoholic richness, a full bodied texture and is smooth and round on the palette. * Cabernet Franc - an important element of the Libourne plantations and represents nearly 20% of the blend at Saint-Émilion. Of medium precocity, it is grown mostly in chalky or quite warm soils. It gives the wine an aromatic flavour, lightly spiced, with a coolness and tannic structure, giving the wine an aged flavour. * Cabernet Sauvignon - representing around 5% of the plantations, it is a grape that is particularly adapted to warm and dry soil (gravel, sand, clay or chalky soil). It gives wine a gently spiced flavour, complex with a tannic richness, favourable to its long and harmonious preservation. The AOC regulations for Saint-Georges-Saint-Émilion also allows the use of two other grape varieties: the Malbec (or Côt) and the Carménère. Only the Malbec grape is still used.

The business was started more than forty years prior to its failure by New York Supreme Court justice Henry Bischoff (1827–1902). From March 7, 1902 the bank was owned by Bischoff's son-in-law, James S. Meng and William J. Beacher, formerly Bischoff's partner. It was located at Tryon Row and Centre Street.Henry Bischoff Dead, New York Times, March 8, 1902, pg. 9. History Aside from banking deposits the company maintained a significant trade in the sale of steamship tickets to people traveling overseas. In January 1913 a bank was incorporated using the name Bischoff's Banking House. The fourth floor at 287 Broadway was owned by Henry Bischoff & Company. This location served as a workplace for customs house brokers and forwarders and receivers of money on deposit for safekeeping. At the time of its failure the financial institution had 1,000 depositors with deposits in the amount of $360,000, secured by a surety bond of $100,000. The majority of the depositors were people of southeast European ethnicity.Bischoff Bank Inquiry, New York Times, March 13, 1914, pg. 18. Bank fraud The incorporated bank transacted business in the same room where Henry Bischoff & Company had previously conducted its private banking affairs. The private banking business was moved to a room in the building's rear. The steamship ticket transactions were carried out in the same location as the private bank. The majority of the customers of Henry Bischoff & Company made no distinction between the incorporated bank and the private bank, believing that they were depositing money in a bank which was secure according to the laws of New York. Instead the funds deposited into the private bank were regarded as personal money by the private bankers, resulting in a sizable loss to depositers.Documents of the Senate of the State of New York, 1914, Volume 11, pp. 11 - 12.

It originally aired on ABC in the United States on 17 March 2010. Plot Justin (Mark Indelicato) is enjoying his acting class with his eccentric teacher, Lena Korvinka. When Betty (America Ferrera) thinks there might be a problem with him and his friends, Austin and Lily, she drops by the class to check up on him. Betty gets sidetracked when a playwright called Zachary Boule is introduced to the class. Betty tells Hilda (Ana Ortiz) about Zachary and believes his speech about reinvention was aimed at her. She gets the idea of pitching him to MODE for the cover. Meanwhile, Wilhelmina (Vanessa Williams) works on a new cover shoot that sees her reconstructing old New York, but Marc (Michael Urie) warns her that Daniel is not happy with the costs. Wilhelmina tells Marc she doesn't care and when she sees Betty dressed nicely, she gives her a compliment. Shortly afterwards, Wilhelmina falls to the floor. At the Editors meeting, Daniel (Eric Mabius) tells everyone that Wilhelmina is suffering from a Perforated ulcer. Wilhelmina tries to join in the meeting via satellite TV, but when she and Daniel fight about the status of the cover shoot her TV is shut off. When Amanda (Becki Newton) and Marc drop off some things for Wilhelmina at the hospital, Wilhelmina tells them she is going ahead with the shoot without telling Daniel. Daniel later visits Wilhelmina and tells her that she isn't doing the cover shoot and she agrees. Wilhelmina's roommate warns her that she will turn out like her, old and alone. Wilhelmina then realises that she has been wasting her time trying to gain control of MODE and decides she wants the whole Meade empire. Daniel approves of Betty's idea to interview Zachary for the magazine and Betty goes off to interview him. During the interview, Zachary flirts with Betty and they share a kiss. Starting to think that this is becoming unprofessional, Betty cuts the interview short and begins writing the profile at MODE, but ends up daydreaming about Zachary caressing her by massaging her and reading his play. Zachary comes to see Betty to talk and they end up kissing again. Zachary asks Betty to go on a date with him and she agrees, Betty later tells Hilda that she can't believe Zachary likes her. During Betty and Zachary's date, Daniel spots them kissing and acts like he's mad before telling her he's fine with it. The next day, Betty kisses Zachary in front of everyone at the office and tells him that she would like to attend the premiere of his play with him, but Zachary tells her that he is planning to take his mother. Betty decides to attend anyway and sees Zachary arrive with another woman. Betty leaves, but Zachary catches up with her and tells her that his agent set him up with the woman to sell tickets to the play. Betty punches him when he tells her that they could date in secret. Betty writes a good profile on Zachary and when he comes to see her, she tells him that she doesn't want to date him. Betty then makes an appointment to have her braces removed. Justin invites Lily to watch movies with him and she brings Austin along, Justin is not happy to see him until he finds out that they share the same interests in films. Justin later tells Marc that he's nervous about kissing Lily in their scene, but Marc tells Justin that if he wants it, it won't be bad. Marc describes to him a kiss so special that the world fades to black and white in the background. At the performance, Justin's kiss with Lily goes well, but he later sees Austin and Lily kissing. Austin goes to find Justin and tells him that he kissed Lily, not the other way round. Austin then kisses Justin, which results in tension between the two even as the background turns black and white in Justin's mind. At his next class, Justin decides to put what happened with him and Austin to rest and start over as friends, but Austin doesn't show up and his teacher tells him that Austin has dropped out of the class. Justin looks on in shock, and, perhaps, realising that he may have feelings for him. Amanda (Becki Newton) asks Daniel why he won't talk to his mother after the revelation that Tyler (Neil Bledsoe) is his half-brother. Daniel tells her Tyler will not be his brother, but she tells him that he came to New York without a job and Daniel's attack on him may have led him to accompany his mother to visit Alexis (Rebecca Romijn). When Daniel asks her when she has been friends with him, she abruptly denies that she has been. Later, Amanda receives a text message from Tyler, asking her to have dinner with him when he gets back from Paris, leaving her in a dilemma as she is already sleeping with Daniel. While she discusses her plans to cancel dinner with Tyler and just have coffee with him, Marc tells her to decide whether she wants to keep what she has with Daniel, casual and fun, or go into a possibly serious relationship with Tyler. Daniel later shows up at Amanda's apartment after a confrontation with his mother. Amanda then tells him that she will not sleep with him tonight. She gets out her phone and accepts Tyler's dinner offer.

However, the year marked the beginning of several emerging elements of contemporary Track and Field. Automatic timing While timing to the 100th of a second had been experimented with for many years, the 1968 Summer Olympics were the first to use Fully Automatic Timing, in not only athletics, but in canoeing, rowing, cycling, equestrian and swimming competitions.http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/All-Past-Olympic- Games/Summer/Mexico-1968-summer-olympics/] Subsequently, systems to record such times became more common and thus the accuracy of Fully Automatic Timing became mandated for World Record acceptance. While this rule was officially put into place in 1977, many 1968 records still stood as the first Automatically timed record. All weather tracks This technology too had been developing, but Tartan tracksTartan APSLA Times were used as the competition surface for the first time at an Olympics. Since then an All- weather running track was required for all top level competition. Subsequently, the inconsistency of the running surface became a significantly smaller factor in athletic performance.Chicago Tribune Altitude With the Olympics happening in Mexico City, at high altitude, the effect of the thin air on athletic performance became a factor on world records. This was already a known phenomenon, and the American team was selected by holding the Olympic Trials at high altitude at Echo Summit, California. In 1955, Lou Jones set the world record in the 400 meters at altitude in Mexico City. Following the 1968 Summer OlympicsSports ReferenceChicago Tribune July 3, 2000] the: *Men's 100 meters record, set by Jim Hines lasted almost 15 years, to be replaced by another mark set by Calvin Smith at altitude in Colorado Springs that lasted another four years. *Men's 200 meters record, set by Tommie Smith lasted almost 11 years, to be replaced by another mark also set on the same track that lasted almost 17 more years. At the high altitude United States Olympic Trials at Echo Summit California that year, John Carlos had posted a prior world record that was never ratified due to the spike formation] of his shoes. *Men's 400 meters record, set by Lee Evans lasted almost 20 years. At the high altitude United States Olympic Trials at Echo Summit California that year, Evans had posted a prior world record that was also never ratified due to his shoes. Larry James in second place, also beat the previous world record and was awarded the record. *Men's 800 meters Ralph Doubell equalled Peter Snell's 1962 world record. The record was again equalled by Dave Wottle at the 1972 U.S. Olympic Trials a month before he won the gold medal in Munich. The record lasted until 1973 when it was finally broken by Marcello Fiasconaro. *Men's 400 meter hurdles record that was set by Geoff Vanderstock at the high altitude United States Olympic Trials that year, was improved upon at the Olympics by David Hemery and lasted four years. *Men's Long Jump record had been set a year earlier in a Mexico City preparation meet, but was improved upon by Bob Beamon an incredible 22 inches or 55 cm. That record lasted almost 23 years and still has only been beaten once. The feat was so outstanding it spawned a new adjective \\"beamonesque\\".] *Men's Triple Jump record was set and improved five times at Mexico City including on the last jump in the competition by Viktor Saneyev , three years later it was improved upon again, by Pedro Pérez at altitude in Cali, Colombia. A year later that was improved upon at sea level by Saneyev, but three years later the record was again set at Mexico City by João Carlos de Oliveira , which lasted ten more years. *Men's Pole Vault was set at the high altitude United States Olympic Trials by Bob Seagren , the eventual gold medalist. The record lasted until the next summer. The current outdoor World Record in the Pole Vault, was set at altitude in Sestriere, Italy by Sergey Bubka in 1994, though with Bubka's history of outstanding performances, the altitude is not considered a major factor in his record. In fact, Bubka later improved upon the record at low altitude, indoors, but at the time indoor records were not recognized as world records. *Decathlon Bill Toomey's World Decathlon best in the 400 metres, 45.6 (45.68 FAT) lasted almost 47 years until it was beaten by Ashton Eaton while setting the world record in 2015. *Men's 4x100 Relay record was set three times in Mexico City, including both semi-finals and the final by the which lasted until the next Olympics *Men's 4x400 Relay record by the lasted almost 24 years (although it was equalled after 20 years). *Women's 100 meter record, set by Wyomia Tyus lasted almost 4 years. *Women's 200 metres record, set by Irena Szewińska lasted almost 2 years. *Women's Long Jump record, set by Viorica Viscopoleanu lasted almost 2 years. *Women's 4x100 Relay record, set by the lasted until the next Olympics East Africa 1968 marked the emergence of high altitude trained long distance runners from Kenya.

He learned to take advantage of the new foam landing pads (another technical innovation introduced in this era) by jumping over the bar backwards.Time Canadian Debbie Brill started doing the \\"Brill Bend\\" about the same time, but Fosbury got the most exposure, winning the Olympics. The prevailing methods involved jumping forwards or sideways, styles called the Roll or \\"Western Roll\\" and previous to that, the \\"Scissors\\" style.

At the time, the Greek Revival style was in vogue, but when this style fell out of favor and the Gothic Revival replaced it in the popular imagination, Christ Church was updated accordingly.

CAS allows an attacker to insert data that modifies the behaviour of a particular desktop application. This makes it possible to extract data from inside of the users' systems. Attackers may gain the full privileges of the attacked application when exploiting CAS vulnerabilities; the attack is to some degree independent of the underlying operating system and hardware architecture. Initially discovered by Emanuele Gentili and presented with two other researchers (Alessandro Scoscia and Emanuele Acri) that had participated in the study of the technique and its implications, it was presented for the first time during the Security Summit 2010 in Milan.Technical SlidesPresentation Video (SecuritySummit 2010 Milano)Security Summit website The format string attack is very similar in concept to this attack and CAS could be considered as a generalization of this attack method. Some aspects of this technique have been previously demonstrated in clickjacking techniques.  Concept  Like web interfaces, modern frameworks for the realization of graphical applications (in particular GTK+ and Qt) allow the use of tags inside their own widgets. If an attacker gains the possibility to inject tags, he gains the ability to manipulate the appearance and behaviour of the application. Exactly the same phenomenon was seen with the use of cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages, which is why this kind of behavior has been named cross-application scripting (CAS). Typically desktop applications get a considerable amount of input and support a large number of features, certainly more than any web interface. This makes it harder for the developer to check whether all the input a program might get from untrusted sources is filtered correctly.  Cross- application request forgery  If cross-application scripting is the application equivalent for XSS in web applications, then cross-application request forgery (CARF) is the equivalent of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) in desktop applications. In CARF the concept of “link” and “protocol” inherited from the web has been extended because it involves components of the graphical environment and, in some cases, of the operating system. Exploiting vulnerabilities amenable to CSRF requires interaction from the user. This requirement isn't particularly limiting because the user can be easily led to execute certain actions if the graphical interface is altered the right way. Many misleading changes in the look of applications can be obtained with the use of CAS: a new kind of “phishing”, whose dangerousness is amplified by a lack of tools to detect this kind of attack outside of websites or emails. In contrast to XSS techniques, that can manipulate and later execute commands in the users' browser, with CAS it is possible to talk directly to the operating system, and not just its graphical interface.

Built in 1887, this church is home to a small Catholic parish, and it has been declared a historic site because of its well-preserved Gothic Revival architecture. Early history The original settlers of far southern Auglaize County were overwhelmingly Catholic.McMurray, William J., ed. History of Auglaize County Ohio. Vol. 1. Indianapolis: Historical Publishing Company, 1923. At this period, prior to 1850,Fortin, Roger. Faith and Action: A History of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati 1821-1996 . Columbus: Ohio State UP, 2002, 400. the region was part of the Great Black Swamp; consequently, travel was extremely difficult. An unsubstantiated claim by a former preacher of St. Josephs Catholic Church suggests that Egypt was named by German immigrants in the early-1830s after a settler described the swampy area back then as being “made by a dab of mud that fell from the wheelbarrow of God.” However, the town name is actually derived from the hometown of the mother of a couple of the earliest pioneers in the area. John Henry Osterloh immigrated from a town called Halter in Lower Saxony, Germany. He purchased a farm in what would later become Egypt in 1829 – 1830. His mother was from Aegypten in Lower Saxony, Germany. John Henry Osterloh died from a typhus epidemic in 1833. One of his brothers, John Albert Osterloh (1814 – 1901) arrived in 1834 at the age of 20, took over possession of John Henry's farm, & continued purchasing more land surrounding it. The residents got tired of traveling nearly 4 miles to the town of Minster to get to church, so they petitioned to get one in Egypt in 1852 & St. Josephs Catholic Church was subsequently built. John Albert Osterloh donated land for the church & adjoining cemetery. Egypt's first settlers were members of St. Augustine's Church in Minster, approximately to the east.DeLorme. Ohio Atlas & Gazetteer. 7th ed. Yarmouth: DeLorme, 2004, 55. . Because of the swampy character of the land, wheeled transit was nearly impossible; the men of the community could only travel to St. Augustine's on horseback, and the women and children were almost never able to worship at all. At the same time, the membership of St. Augustine's was growing to the point that its facilities were severely strained. Therefore, a movement arose for the creation of a separate parish in Egypt, and in 1852, three men were sent to petition Archbishop Purcell for a separate church. The archbishop granted permission for the erection of the parish in that year; it was dedicated to St. Joseph, and subscriptions soon raised $800 for the construction of a church. Once the members had agreed on the basic architectural elements of their church, they summoned multiple contractors for the bidding process. Each of the contractors independently named $800 as the cost of erecting the new church; consequently, parishioner Henry Rolfes was placed in charge after he named his price at just $300 and the cost of some materials. Even after the cost of all materials was deducted, enough money remained to pay a priest for the first year. Originally, the parish had no priest of its own; Mass was typically celebrated by priests from St. John's in Maria Stein or St. Augustine's in Minster. After four years, a rectory and a female convent were built near the church, and the parish obtained a resident pastor for the first time. Since its earliest years, St. Joseph's Church has been served by the Society of the Precious Blood. Architecture Front of the church By the late 1880s, the original church building had become insufficient for the parish's needs. Under the leadership of their elderly priest, John van den Brock, the parish erected a new church in 1887 at a cost of $5,000, according to a design by Anton Goehr. This building's walls are built of brick, supported by a stone foundation with a basement and topped with a gabled roof of asphalt. Its floor plan is the shape of a Latin cross, three bays wide and six bays long, and the entire building reflects the Gothic Revival style of architecture. Inside, the church is ornamented with frescoes on the walls and a heavily decorated ceiling, and the altars are built in a revivalistic form of the Gothic style. Worshippers enter the church through an arched doorway in the base of the tower.Brown, Mary Ann. Ohio Historic Inventory Nomination: Egypt Catholic Church. Ohio Historical Society, February 1977. Goehr's design remained little changed until 1927, when the church was modified by the addition of a tower and a sacristy. Although the sacristy remains in place, the tower was further modified in the 1940s by the replacement of its spire with a small domed belfry. Related buildings Front of the rectory Located immediately to the north of the church is a rectory. After the male and female members of the Missionaries of the Precious Blood became two separate organizations, the male organization donated all of its Egypt properties to the female organization, leaving St. Joseph's Church without a rectory. When a replacement rectory was completed in 1912, it had cost $6,000 plus extensive labor on the part of the parishioners. The resulting structure is a two-and-a-half story square brick structure, built on a stone foundation and topped with an asphalt hip roof with a dormer window. Many other Catholic churches in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati built rectories around this time, due to a directive from the archbishop; like the one at Egypt, they are typically square brick houses with wrap-around porches. These buildings typically resemble the style of houses purchased through the Sears Roebuck catalogues of the period.Brown, Mary Ann. Ohio Historic Inventory Nomination: Egypt Rectory. Ohio Historical Society, October 1977. Immediately to the north of the rectory is a parish cemetery, and slightly farther to the north is a former parish school. Located along the road between Minster and Maria Stein, more than two miles to the northwest, is part of the abandoned 1856 convent. Once three stories high, it has been reduced to one story, and its brick walls have been covered with modern siding. Recent history Interior In 1977, St. Joseph's Church and its rectory were recorded by the Ohio Historic Inventory, a historic preservation program of the Ohio Historical Society. Both buildings were found to be in good condition, but both were seen as endangered by the weak state of the parish that owned them. St. Joseph's Church was one of the smallest parishes in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, and priest shortages in the American Catholic Church meant that small parishes such as St. Joseph's were not likely to be able to have their own pastors; consequently, it was believed that the church would close by 1982. Eventually, this plan was cancelled; St. Joseph's Church is still an active parish of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati.The Futures Project, Archdiocese of Cincinnati. Accessed 2010-06-05. It is clustered with St. Augustine's Church in Minster and served by the same priest,St. Augustine and St. Joseph Parishes, St. Augustine and St. Joseph Parishes, n.d. Accessed 2010-06-05. and the cluster is part of the St. Marys Deanery. Although it was seen as doomed to closure, St. Joseph's Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 because of its well-preserved historic architecture; the rectory was also included in the nomination. These buildings were part of a collection of nearly thirty churches and various other church- related buildings, designated the \\"Cross-Tipped Churches Thematic Resources,\\" a multiple property submission of properties in western Ohio related to the Missionaries of the Precious Blood.Brown, Mary Ann and Mary Niekamp. '. National Park Service, July 1978. Accessed 2009-10-13. Architectural historians have divided these churches into four generations; St. Joseph's is a member of the second generation, which are generally simple rectangular brick buildings without tall spires. Many churches from this generation, such as St. Joseph's and St. Anthony's in Padua, were later expanded by the addition of a single tower at the front of the building, due to the prevalence of such towers at the construction of newer churches. Few churches from before this period survive; only St. John's in Fryburg to the northwest and St. Augustine's in Minster remain churches, and St. Augustine's has been greatly modified by the addition of twin towers. Because most churches in this region are tall Gothic Revival structures with large towers, the region has become known as the \\"Land of the Cross-Tipped Churches.\\" NotesReferencesExternal links *St. Augustine/St. Joseph Cluster Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1887 Category:19th-century Roman Catholic church buildings in the United States Category:Churches in Auglaize County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Auglaize County, Ohio Category:Churches in the Land of the Cross-Tipped Churches Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in Ohio Category:Religious organizations established in 1852 Category:Churches in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati Category:Catholic congregations established in the 19th century Category:1852 establishments in Ohio ","title":"St. Joseph's Catholic Church (Egypt, Ohio)"},{"id":"26617267","text":"The First Presbyterian Church of Wapakoneta is a historic former church building in downtown Wapakoneta, Ohio, United States.

The congregation was greatly reduced by a financial scandal in the 1920s; reduced to a handful of members, it was disorganized in 1930 and its property sold. After it passed into the possession of the Wapakoneta Women's Club in that year, it served as the clubhouse until 1997, when it was purchased by the Auglaize County Historical Society. Since that time, the church has been converted into the Wapakoneta Museum by the society. In 1985, the church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In its early years, the parish was administered in conjunction with St. Thomas parish in nearby Six Mile, almost to the northeast. Growth Appearance circa 1910 By 1854, the parishioners built their first church, a log structure, and the parish's property was expanded with the purchase of land for a cemetery and a small rectory in 1861. By this time, growth in membership rendered the church too small for the numbers of worshippers, but the parish was too poor to erect a replacement. Under the leadership of Joseph Gregory Dwenger,McMurray, William J., ed. History of Auglaize County Ohio. Vol. 1. Indianapolis: Historical Publishing Company, 1923, 324. the parish received encouragement from Archbishop John Baptist Purcell, and other churches in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati contributed significant amounts of money for construction; the parish finished its new church in 1867 at a cost of $12,000. Designed by Minster architect Anton Goehr, the new church was a simple rectangular brick structure with a bell tower, supported by a stone foundation., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2010-03-22. The original church was moved to the banks of the canal in downtown St. Marys. As the parish continued to grow into the 1880s, a bell was added to the church's steeple, and a rectory was built at a cost of nearly $3,000. Non-Catholics in the community paid nearly half of the cost of erecting the rectory. Increased wealth among the parishioners and growing anti-Catholic sentiment in the region resulted in the foundation of a parish school in 1902. New facilities By the 1940s, the church had deteriorated significantly to the point that an extensive remodeling effort was necessary. Increased membership in the 1950s overcrowded the school building; a new school was built in its place in time for the 1957 schoolyear. By the late 1960s, this growth made the century-old church too small for its parish, and efforts to erect a new church began in 1969. With surveys revealing that nearly three in four parishioners wanted a new building, the original church was demolished in 1978; its replacement was finished in the following year. Some features of the original church, such as its organ and some of its windows, were preserved and included in the new construction. Recognition One year after its demolition, the church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural significance, along with nearly thirty other Catholic churches in the region of far western Ohio known as the \\"Land of the Cross-Tipped Churches.\\" Although more than thirty years have passed since the second building's destruction, it remains listed on the National Register. Since settlement in the middle of the 19th century, the Catholic Church has been a leading part of life in this region of the state, with its massive Gothic Revival churches in tiny farming communities among wide plains. When Holy Rosary Church was first proposed for addition to the National Register in 1977, it was identified as one of the region's most significant Catholic churches built during the third quarter of the 19th century. Eight churches in the region were built during this period as simple rectangular brick structures with small bell towers, but only Holy Rosary and Holy Family Church in Frenchtown to the south retained their original appearance; the other six churches were modified by the addition of tall spires. Few churches in the region built before this time are yet in existence; only St. John's Catholic Church in Fryburg to the east has not been significantly changed, while Holy Rosary's first building, since converted to a canal-side house, is one of the few that have survived in any condition.

Although no resident pastor served the parish in its earliest years, membership grew during the 1840s and 1850s, and a priest was first assigned to the church in 1857. The expenses of maintaining even a small church caused the parish to be deep in debt during its earliest years, but it prospered greatly under the pastorate of Joseph Gregory Dwenger, later Bishop of Fort Wayne. Since 1850, the parish has been served by priests from the Congregation of the Precious Blood.Fullenkamp, Leonard. \\"History of St. Joseph Catholic Parish\\". Auglaize County Historical Society, ed. A History of Auglaize County Ohio. Defiance: Hubbard, 1980, 103-104. Church building Interior as viewed from the loft By the late 1850s, the parish's membership had grown significantly, and the original church had become too small; consequently, a larger brick structure was built to the east of the original building in 1858. Among its most distinctive elements were a massive single tower, four bells, and a large pipe organ. In later years, elderly parishioners remembered the organ and bells favorably: purchased for $2,200 and $1,700 respectively, they were seen as equal to any instruments of the twentieth century and as worthy of installation in the present church building respectively. This church was replaced in turn by the present structure in the early twentieth century. Construction of this Romanesque Revival building began under the direction of the DeCurtins family in 1910, and it was dedicated on October 8, 1911. A brick building supported by a stone foundation,, Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2010-06-20. the church includes architectural features such as two towers and a large rose window at the front, underneath which worshippers may enter the building through several large arched doors. Architectural historians have divided the Precious Blood-related churches of western Ohio into multiple generations. Only a few buildings remain from the first generation, which consisted primarily of small wooden churches, and only St. John's Church in Fryburg remains essentially unchanged. Replacing these wooden buildings were the churches of the second generation, which were generally small brick buildings without tall spires. The churches of the third generation are mostly High Gothic Revival structures with tall towers, but the final generation of churches includes a wide range of styles. As a Romanesque Revival church built in 1910, St. Joseph's is one of the newest churches in the region, and it plainly is a part of the final generation. Related buildings=School Front and side of the school In 1853, the church purchased a frame building adjacent to its property and quickly opened a parish elementary school inside. After sixteen years, a larger structure was desired, and a larger brick building was erected immediately to the east of the church at a cost of $4,000. Continued growth necessitated its replacement by a newer building in 1899; this structure is still standing. With features such as towers and turrets, St. Joseph's School is one of the most architecturally-prominent Catholic schools in the region, along with schools in Minster, St. Henry, and Chickasaw. As the parish continued to expand, a high school was opened in 1919; its classes met in the elementary school building until a new building was completed in 1961. However, financial issues caused the high school's closure in 1974; the elementary students were then transferred to the former high school, and the original elementary school was then leased to the Wapakoneta City School District. Rectory As well as completing its school in 1899, the parish also built a rectory in the same year. Expanded in 1922, the rectory was later converted into a convent.

Silk Street (, Xiushui Street, literally meaning \\"beautiful water Street\\"), aka Silk Market or Silk Street Market, is a shopping center in Chaoyang District, Beijing, that accommodates over 1,700 retail vendors, notorious among international tourists for their wide selection of counterfeit designer brand apparel. The Silk Street is located at Yonganli, just west of the China World Trade Centre and is accessible by subway (line 1) and bus. The Silk Street attracts approximately 20,000 visitors daily (from 9am to 9pm) on weekdays and between 50,000 and 60,000 on weekends as of 2006. This 35,000-square-meter complex houses 1,700 retail vendors and over 3,000 salespeople spread over seven floors with three levels of basements. Many of the stalls have, over the years, gained local and international reputation for selling counterfeit luxury designer brands at relatively low prices. Some have carried on this trademark despite growing pressures from the management, the Chinese government and famous brand-name companies. The old Silk Market in September 2004, now demolished.  History  The Beijing Daily in June 2009 published an articleLiu Zongyong Beautification and vulgarization of Beijing place names. 北京地名的雅化与俗化 translation confirming that in the last years of the Qing Dynasty Xiushui Street (秀水街) had originally been Chou Shui Street (臭水街), \\"Smelly Water Alley\\" when it was simply a mud path outside the Jianguo Gate. The original outdoor Xiushui Market (a.k.a. Silk Alley) was located in Xiushui Dongjie, south-east of Ritan near the First Embassy Area of Beijing. The shopping alley consisted of 410 stalls selling mostly knock-off luxury brand- name garments, silk products and tourist souvenirs. It attracted 20,000 locals and foreigners on weekends and reaped a total annual sales volume of 100 million yuan (US$12.5m). After 20 years of business, the old market was ordered to close down for demolition on January 6, 2005, due to fire-safety hazards, security issues and the absence of land permits from individual landlords. The application for demolition was filed on July 2004 by the Beijing Urban Planning Bureau, the Chaoyang Public Engineering Committee, the Chaoyang Department of Public Security and Fire Fighting, and the Chaoyang Foreign Liaison Office. Opened on March 19, 2005, and replacing the old alley- based Xiushui Market, the current Silk Street establishment has diversified their business scope. In addition to selling fashion apparels and accessories such as hats, handbags, shoes, belts, sportswear and silk fabrics like their predecessor, the new Silk Street has introduced traditional Chinese handicrafts, antiques, calligraphy, carpets, table cloths, bed coverings, paintings, hand-knit dresses, toys, electronic gadgets, trinkets, and fine jewelry. Reputable establishments such as the Tongrentang Pharmacy, Quanjude Peking Roast Duck restaurant, and multi-national coffee and restaurant chains such as Lavazza, SPR Coffee, Caffe L'affare, Subway and TCBY have also joined Silk Street's bid to become the \\"ultimate one-stop tourist destination\\" in Beijing. Invested and constructed by Beijing Xinyashenhong Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. and managed by Beijing Silk Street Garment Market Co., Ltd. Intellectual property right disputes One of the political incentives behind the transfer of the old Xiushui Market to the current Silk Street establishment was related to the unregulated sales of fake goods in violation of intellectual property rights, according to Yin Xiaobo, an assistant to the General Manager of the Economic Management Center of the JianGuoMenWai Community in Chaoyang District, Beijing. The new Silk Street complex was viewed as a more effective battleground in regulating and eradicating trademark infringements among private retailers. On November 23, 2004, the Beijing Administrative Bureau for Industry and Commerce and Beijing Commercial Bureau listed the new Silk Street as one of nine streamlined markets in Beijing in accordance with \\"Strengthening Market Supervision and Crackdown on False Commodities.\\" Since the grand opening on March 19, 2005, Silk Street has conducted reforms in an attempt to regulate and crack down on violations of IPR in the market. Despite the efforts, counterfeits were still found inside the shopping center. As a result, five global brand-name giants, which included Prada, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Burberry were granted compensation of 20,000 yuan (US$2500) each from the landlord and five of its stall holders on April 14, 2006. On June 7, 2006, a deal was signed with European luxury name brands promising to evict tenants found violating trademark rights. The Intellectual Property Rights Protection Fund of 30 million yuan (US$3.8m) collected from its tenants was established by Silk Street in a collective effort to curb infringements of trademark rights. On August 30, 2006, 30 vendors received 10 million yuan (US$1.3m) in rent refunds from that fund as a reward for respecting IPR protection laws. An estimated 80 per cent of vendors at Silk Street have acquired trademark authorization as of August 2006.

Radiation Portal Monitors (RPMs) are passive radiation detection devices used for the screening of individuals, vehicles, cargo or other vectors for detection of illicit sources such as at borders or secure facilities. Fear of terrorist attacks with radiological weapons spurred RPM deployment for cargo scanning since 9/11, particularly in the United States. Application RPMs were originally developed for screening individuals and vehicles at secure facilities such as weapons laboratories. They were deployed at scrap metal facilities to detect radiation sources mixed among scrap that could contaminate a facility and result in a costly clean up. As part of the effort to thwart nuclear smuggling after the breakup of the Soviet Union, RPMs were deployed around that territory, and later around many other European and Asian countries, by the US Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Second Line of Defense Program (SLD)Second Line of Defense Program starting in the late 1990s. After the attack of 9/11, the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) started the Radiation Portal Monitor Program (RPMP) to deploy RPMs around all US borders (land, sea and air).Kouzes, R.T., \\"Detecting Illicit Nuclear Materials\\", American Scientist 93, PP. 422-427 (September–October 2005). Detected radiation Radiation Portal Monitor (RPM) was designed to detect traces of radiation emitted from an object passing through a RPM. Gamma radiation is detected, and in some cases complemented by neutron detection when sensitivity for nuclear material is desired. Technology=PVT (gamma ray detection) First generation RPMs often rely on PVT scintillators for gamma counting. They provide limited information on energy of detected photons, and as a result, they were criticized for their inability to distinguish gamma rays originating from nuclear sources from gamma rays originating from a large variety of benign cargo types that naturally emit radioactivity, including cat litter, granite, porcelain, stoneware, bananas etc. Those Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials, called NORMs account for 99% of nuisance alarms. It is worth noting that bananas have erroneously been reported as the source of radiation alarms; they are not. Most produce contains potassium-40, but packing density of fruits and vegetables is too low to produce a significant signal. PVT does have the ability to provide some energy discrimination, which can be exploited to limit nuisance alarms from NORM. NaI(Tl) (gamma ray detection) In attempt to reduce the high nuisance alarm rates of first generation RPMs, the Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) program was called into life. Some of the portal monitors evaluated for this purposes are based on NaI(Tl) scintillating crystals. These devices, having better energy resolution than PVT, were supposed to reduce nuisance alarm rates by distinguishing threats from benign sources on the basis of the detected gamma radiation spectra. ASPs based on NaI(Tl) had a cost several times that of first generation RPMs. To date, NaI(Tl) based ASPs have not been able to demonstrate significantly better performance than PVT based RPMs.\\"Evaluating testing, costs, and benefits of advanced spectroscopic portals for screening cargo at ports of entry: interim report\\" (2009) The ASP program was canceled in 2011 after continued problems, including a high rate of false positives and difficulty maintaining stable operation. HPGe (gamma ray detection) In the scope of the ASP program, high purity germanium (HPGe) based portal monitors were evaluated. HPGe, having significantly better energy resolution than NaI(Tl), allows rather precise measurement of the isotopes contributing to gamma ray spectra. However, due to very high costs and major constraints such as cryo-cooling requirements, US government support for HPGe based portal monitors was dropped.  3He (thermal neutron detection) RPMs geared for interception of nuclear threats usually incorporate a neutron detection technology. The vast majority of all neutron detectors deployed in RPMs to date relies on He-3 tubes surrounded by neutron moderators. Since the end of 2009, however, the global He-3 supply crisis has made this technology unavailable. The search for alternative neutron detection technologies has yielded satisfactory results.Kouzes, R.T., J.H. Ely, L.E. Erikson, W.J. Kernan, A.T. Lintereur, E.R. Siciliano, D.L. Stephens, D.C. Stromswold, R.M. VanGinhoven, M.L. Woodring, Neutron Detection Alternatives For Homeland Security, Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A 623 (2010) 1035–1045  4He (fast neutron detection)  The latest technology being deployed at ports uses pressurized natural helium to directly detect fast neutrons, without the need for bulky neutron moderators. Utilizing recoil nuclei following neutron scatter events, natural helium glows (scintillates), allowing photomultipliers (e.g. SiPMs) to produce an electrical signal. Introducing moderators and lithium-6 to capture thermalized neutrons further increases the detection capabilities of natural helium, at the expense of losing the initial information of the neutrons (such as energy) and reducing sensitivity to shielded neutron-emitting materials. Radiological threats RPMs are deployed with the aim to intercept radiological threats as well as to deter malicious groups from deploying such threats. Radiological dispersal devices Radiological dispersal devices (RDDs) are weapons of mass disruption rather than weapons of mass destruction. \\"Dirty bombs\\" are examples of RDDs. As the name suggests, an RDD aims at dispersing radioactive material over an area, causing high cleanup costs, psychological, and economic damage. Nevertheless, direct human losses caused by RDDs are low and not attributed to the radiological aspect. RDDs are easily fabricated and components readily obtainable. RDDs are comparatively easy to detect with RPMs due to their high level of radioactivity. RDDs emit gamma radiation as well as sometimes, depending on what isotopes are used, neutrons. Nuclear devices Improvised nuclear devices (INDs) and nuclear weapons are weapons of mass destruction. They are difficult to acquire, manufacture, refurbish, and handle. While INDs can be constructed to emit only low amounts of radiation making them difficult to detect with RPMs, all INDs emit some amounts of gamma and neutron radiation. Alarms Gamma radiation as well as neutron radiation can cause RPMs to trigger an alarm procedure. Alarms caused by statistical fluctuations of detection rates are referred to as false alarms. Alarms caused by benign radioactive sources are referred to as nuisance alarms. Causes of nuisance alarms can be broken up into several large categories: *Naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) and technically enhanced NORM (TENORM) **Ceramic, tiles, porcelain, pottery, granite, clay, and other rock and clay based products contain elevated levels of naturally occurring potassium-40 and to a smaller degree thorium-232 and other isotopes.Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, \\" Radiation Quick Reference Guide\\" **Propane gas tankers, full or empty, contain elevated levels of radium-226.Cooley, Geri. \\"NORM Management in the Oilfield\\". Permian Basin STEPS Network October Industry Meeting, October 14, 2008. **Many fertilizers and potash contain elevated levels of potassium-40. **Cat litter contains elevated levels of thorium-232. *Medical isotope alarms constitute the majority of alarms in privately owned vehicle lanes at land borders and are usually due to medical treatment of the driver or passengers, mostly due to technetium-99m and thallium-201 and iodine-131. Deployment This article relates primarily to RPMs deployed for screening trucks at ports of entry. Over 1400 RPMs are deployed at US borders and a similar number at foreign locations for the purpose of interdicting illicit radiological and nuclear material. The US deployments cover all land border vehicles, all seaport containerized cargo, and all mail and express courier facilities. Efforts are also being made to deploy similar measures to other cross border vectors including: * Pedestrian radiation portal monitoring * Air freight radiation portal monitoring * Crane based radiation portal monitoring * Air luggage radiation portal monitoring * Railway radiation portal monitoring RPMs are also deployed at civilian and military nuclear facilities to prevent theft of radiological materials. Steel mills often use RPMs to screen incoming scrap metal to avoid radioactive sources illegally disposed in this way. Garbage incineration plants often monitor incoming material to avoid contamination.

Turmoil in the national church disturbed many members of the Mechanicsburg Methodist Episcopal Church, and Kazerta gathered a congregation of abolitionist families into a new congregation. The members purchased a lot on West Sandusky Street, upon which a two-story brick church was constructed in 1858. Mechanicsburg's Masonic lodge assisted in construction, and in return they were sold rights to the second story. In its early years, the congregation was weakened by members' departures to other communities or by death, and it was attached to another young congregation in Catawba until 1865. As the years passed, the church grew stronger; membership reached 308 in 1879, at which time the building was remodelled and refurbished, and by 1890 a new building was needed. After concluding the lease with the Masons, the congregation destroyed the old building and erected a new structure on the same lot, and all debts were paid by the end of 1891.

In the county's early years, all of its numerous Baptist churches were found in the countryside, so in 1840 the Ohio Baptist Convention began to make efforts to plant churches in the villages. One such society arose in Mechanicsburg in the same year; known as Goshen Baptist Church for its first seven years, the church constructed its first church building on Locust Street in 1846. Resources were scarce in the early years, and the resulting building was small, but subsequent growth saw the membership rise to 106 by 1864. From this time forward, the congregation again declined; soon after the death of a prominent member in 1872, the building was sold with the goal of building a better one, but a better one was not built, and membership dropped to 38 by 1883. Most of the members left to form another Baptist church in that year, and the five remaining members deeded the congregation's property to the Ohio Baptist Convention when the congregation closed.

The Murder of Fannie Gibbons, Robbie Gibbons, and Emma Carico staying together at the Gibbons home in Ashland, were beaten to death with axes on the night of December 23, 1881. Afterwards, the murderers set the house on fire. Emma's mother, next door, saw the flames and sounded an alarm. Neighbors found the three victims inside. George Ellis, a bricklayer, soon confessed to the crime, and implicated fellow workers William Neal and Ellis Craft. The three were taken to a Catlettsburg jail, removed to avoid a lynch mob, and returned for trial on January 16, 1882. Neal and Craft were convicted in a ten-day trial and sentenced to death; they appealed the verdict. Ellis was tried May 30, convicted, and given a life term, but a mob removed him from the jail that night and lynched him in Ashland. Craft and Neal were found guilty in separate trials at Grayson, Kentucky. Craft was hanged on October 12, 1883, and Neal on March 27, 1885. Victims In The Ashland Tragedy, the three victims are described vividly, as follows: *Fannie Gibbons, part of the well-known Gibbons family of the area, is called \\"a handsome girl\\" with a \\"cheerful disposition and winning manners\\" and \\"many friends.\\" *Robert Gibbons, the brother of Fannie, who had lost a leg \\"some years before in an awful event\\", when he accidentally fallen \\"in front and under an empty car that was being pushed along a track by some of the employees of the Norton Iron Works.\\" *Emma Carico, better known as Emma Thomas, was a \\"well-developed, fine-looking girl, who was loved by all who knew her.\\" In music The Ashland tragedy has been described several times in song, most notably by Elijah Adams,Folk-songs of the South\\"The Ashland Tragedy\\" who was the half-brother of Richard Adams, who was part of the Grand Jury at Neal and Craft's trials.Richard & Elijah Adams Notes and references  Category:1881 in Kentucky Category:Murder in Kentucky Category:Crimes in Kentucky Category:1881 murders in the United States ","title":"Ashland tragedy"},{"id":"26617693","text":"The sacrifice of the intellect (sacrificium intellectus, sometimes rendered in Italian, sacrificio dell'intelletto) is a concept associated with Christian devotion - retraceble to Paul the Apostle's Second Epistle to the Corinthians (10,5) - and particularly with the Jesuit order. It was the \\"third sacrifice\\" demanded by the founder of the Jesuits, St. Ignatius Loyola, who required > besides entire outward submission to command, also the complete > identification of the inferior's will with that of the superior . [Loyola] > lays down that the superior is to be obeyed simply as such and as standing > in the place of God, without reference to his personal wisdom, piety or > discretion; that any obedience which falls short of making the superior's > will one's own, in inward affection as well as in outward effect, is lax and > imperfect; that going beyond the letter of command, even in things > abstractly good and praise-worthy, is disobedience, and that the \\"sacrifice > of the intellect\\" is the third and highest grade of obedience, well pleasing > to God, when the inferior not only wills what the superior wills, but thinks > what he thinks, submitting his judgment, so far as it is possible for the > will to influence and lead the judgment.Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th > edition, \\"JESUIT\\". Available online. The concept was taken up in a more individualistic sense by the Jansenist thinker Blaise Pascal, and particularly by the existentialist thinker Søren Kierkegaard, who thought that the act of faith requires a leap into the void, which amounts to a sacrifice of the intellect and reason.S. Kierkegaard, Fear and Trembling. (Copenhagen: 1843) This was quintessentially expressed in the traditional dictum, credo quia absurdum, \\"I believe because it is absurd.\\" This view of faith is rejected by the Catholic church, which regards reason as a path towards direct knowledge of God.See St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica; Pope John Paul II, encyclical Fides et ratio. The phrase is often used in a pejorative sense in writings on the psychology and sociology of religion - e.g.: *Max Weber states: \\"There is absolutely no 'unbroken' religion working as a vital force, which is not compelled at some point to demand the credo non quod, sed credo quia absurdum - the \\"sacrifice of the intellect.\\"\\"Max Weber, \\"World Rejection and Theodicy\\", ch.8. See H.H. Gerth and C.W. Mills, From Max Weber: essays in sociology (1948, 2002), p.352 *According to Paul Pruyser, \\"Sacrifice of the intellect, demanded by a good many religious movements and blithely if not joyously made by a good many religious persons, is surely one of the ominous features of neurotic religion.\\"Paul Pruyser, \\"The Seamy Side of Current Religious Beliefs,\\" in H. Newton Maloney & Bernard Spilka, eds. Religion in Psychodynamic Perspective: The Contributions of Paul Pruyser (Oxford 1991): 51. Sacrifice of the intellect and quantum mechanics In 1926, Erwin Schrodinger used sacrificium intellectus in the pejorative sense to describe the Albert Einstein's gas theory based on the independent particle nature of gas molecules and to propose a need for considering the wave nature of gas molecules in terms of wave mechanics. > In the new gas theory recently developed by A. Einstein, this surely counts, > in general, as the essential point, namely, that an entirely new kind of > statistics, the so-called Bose statistics, are to be applied to the > movements of gas molecules.

His mother was Edith St John, daughter of Sir Oliver St John of Bletso, Bedfordshire (d. 1437) and the half-sister of Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII. They shared the same mother, Margaret Beauchamp of Bletso, who had married three times; this made Richard a first cousin of the half blood to Henry VII.Complete Peerage, Vol XIV, p. 567, note (a), line 5 Sir Richard was thus first cousin of Alice St John, wife of Henry Parker, 10th Baron Morley and mother of Jane Parker, wife of George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford. Tudor rule Henry VII gave him various offices in Wales: he was Constable of Harlech and Montgomery Castles and the High Sheriff of Merionethshire. In 1495 Pole raised men against the rebellion of Perkin Warbeck. Sir Richard Pole was \\"a valiant and expert commander\\" first retained to serve Henry VII in the wars of Scotland in 1497 with five demi- lancers and 200 archers, and shortly afterwards with 600 men-at-arms, 60 demi- lancers, and 540 bows and bills. King Henry later made him Chief Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Arthur, Prince of Wales. Pole was invested as a Knight of the Garter on April 1499. After Prince Arthur married Catherine of Aragon in 1501 Pole accompanied them to Ludlow Castle where Arthur took his role as President of the Council of Wales and the Marches. Pole was later given responsibility for the Welsh Marches. He also had the daunting task of meeting with the Council of Wales and the Marches on how best to inform the king of his much-loved eldest son's death on 2 April 1502. Marriage He married Margaret Plantagenet, daughter of George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence and Isabel Neville, Duchess of Clarence, between 1491 and 1494, perhaps on 22 September 1494.http://www3.dcs.hull.ac.uk/cgi-bin/gedlkup/n=royal?royal02275 However, their eldest son Henry was born in 1492, making 1491 the likely date of marriage.

It is located at 20, /, and is served by the Brussels-Congress railway station. History of the building The building was designed in 1905 by world-famous architect Victor Horta, in Art Nouveau style, and served as a textile department store, the Magasins Waucquez. After Waucquez's death in 1920, the building began to languish away, and in 1970, the firm closed its doors. Jean Delhaye, a former aid of Horta, saved the building from demolition, and by 16 October 1975, it was designated as a protected monument. Still, the building was in bad shape and victim to a lot of vandalism. In 1980, architect Jean Breydel and comics artists François Schuiten, Bob de Moor, Alain Baran, Guy Dessicy and Hergé planned to restore the building and give it a new destination as a museum dedicated to the history of Belgian comics. Originally, the museum would be a homage to Hergé, but he suggested honoring the entire Belgian comics industry. In 1983, Belgian Minister of Public Works Louis Olivier decided that the building would be bought by the Direction of Buildings, making it national property. In 1984, a fund was founded which brought together several Flemish and Walloon comics artists. Two years later, the restorations began, with respect for the original architecture, while updating it to modern standards. The mosaics were flown over from Italy and constructed by Italian mosaic workers, because the profession had become obsolete in Belgium. On 6 October 1989, the museum was inaugurated in the presence of King Baudouin of Belgium and Queen Fabiola of Belgium. In the Autumn of 2015, the museum started redecorating its permanent exhibition. The museum The ground floor of the museum holds a restaurant, a room dedicated to Victor Horta, a comics' store named \\"Slumberland\\" after Little Nemo in Slumberland, a library with a reading room and a study centre. The first floor has an auditorium, a room with original comic book pages by various artists and a room dedicated to animation, more specifically the Belgian animation industry, such as Belvision. The second floor has a permanent exhibition dedicated to the chronological history of the medium in Belgium called \\"The Museum of Imagination\\". The exhibit starts off with Hergé and ends with Peyo, covering the pioneers of Belgian comics between 1929 and 1958 and with special focus on the magazines Spirou and Tintin. Each artist has a room dedicated to his work and designed in a playful way. The final floor is dedicated to the merchandising of comics and available for provisional exhibitions. List of the exhibited comics artists Four artists exhibited are Flemish: Willy Vandersteen, Marc Sleen, Bob de Moor and Morris.

For certain duties diesel locomotives were also used, albeit these were usually second-hand or rebuilt engines. Locomotives with a gauge of were classified as Kö 6001ff. and locomotives as Kö 6501ff.. From 1970 they were incorporated into Class 100 without regard to their gauge. This applied to all Kleinlokomotiven and they were given serial numbers from 901ff.. Due to the risk of confusion, in 1973 the narrow-gauge diesel locomotives were reclassified to 199. In addition, from 1992 they became DBAG Class 399; and once more the gauge was deducible from the serial number as follows: = 399.1, = 399.6, = 399.7.  1949–1970 = Heeresfeldbahnlokomotive HF 130 C  Two former three-axled Heeresfeldbahnloks of Type HF 130 C were refurbished by the DR for various narrow-gauge lines. They were given the numbers Köf 6001 and 6003, the first was deployed to Dahme, the second to Nauen. Following the dismantling of the Nauen line in 1963 it, too, went to Dahme. When that line closed in 1965 both locomotives were transferred to Rügen. Köf 6001 (from 1970: 100 901 and from 1973: 199 001) was retired in 1985, the other one (from 1970: 100 902 and from 1973: 199 002), last used by the DR as no. 399 703 and is still in service today under its old number of Kö 6003\\\\.  BMAG FD 80  This engine of Type FD 80 with a gauge of was delivered to the Kleinbahnen in the district of Jerichow I in 1936 . She had three axles, all coupled, and a centrally positioned driver's cab. On one side was the engine, on the other the mechanical four-geared drive which drove the axles. It was mainly used as a shunter in Burg station. In the Reichsbahn she was given the number Kö 6002\\\\. She was retired in 1962.  Kö 6004  A twin-axled former pit locomotive from the Heeresfeldbahn fleet, built in 1944 at Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz, which was stored after the war at Dahme. It was renovated in 1959 for use at RAW Dessau, the main change being a larger driver's cab. The axles were driven via a gear train and roller chains. In 1967 she was sold to Pretzien to the Ballerstedt Transport KG, where she hauled gravel trains until 1980.  LKM Type Ns 3  During the 1950s, VEB Lokomotivbau Karl Marx in Babelsberg built diesel locomotives for industrial and field railways, which were also suited to various (narrow) gauge uses (s = Schmalspur or narrow gauge). The first engines of Type Ns 3 were delivered in 1952. A total of 280 locomotives of this class were built. The locomotive drive was achieved by means of a mechanical, three-stage gear train with friction clutch via a jackshaft lying between the axles and connecting rods to the axles. The locos were with equipped with water-cooled, four-cylinder, four-stroke diesel engines generating a nominal 60 horsepower. They had an outside frame, the drive was achieved using a mechanical, three-stage gear and a reverse gear unit. The axles were driven by connecting rods via a jackshaft. The Treibzapfen and crank pins were located outside the frame. One locomotive of Type Ns 3 with a gauge of ended up at Rügen, where it was initially used in the Stubben Chalk Factory and, from 1954, on the Rügen Railways as Kö 6005 for shunting duties. On the withdrawal of goods services she was stored in 1970. Two metre-gauge examples of this class were originally built for the Soviet Army and ended up in the Industriebahn Halle in 1965 where they were used to shunt the sidings. They had numbers Kö 6501 and 6502. The first was initially used from 1963 to 1965 in Barth on the Franzburg lines. The technically identical locomotives only differed in appearance: The second was given a 2800 mm wide driver's cab, so that the vision when shunting with standard-gauge wagons was better. Instead of a buffer this locomotive had a long coupling rod (Kuppelbaum) for rollbock work. They were renumbered in 1970 to 100 903 and 904, and in 1973 to 199 003 and 004. In 1983/1984 they were retired. Shortly beforehand they had been given the numbers 199 991 and 992 to distinguish them from their successors.  From 1970  The remaining Kleinloks, Kö 6001, 6003, 6501 and 6502, were incorporated as Class 199.0. They were joined by other locomotives:  LKM Type Ns 4  The most powerful locomotive of the first LKM type had a power output of 90 horsepower (90 PS). In 1954 two prototypes of the Ns 4 were built for were for export to Hungary. In 1955 18 locomotives were built for Indonesia with the type designation of Ns 4 a. There is still at least one locomotive of Type Ns 4 a in Indonesia today. Production of the Ns 4 b did not begin until 1957. Twenty-two units were manufactured from 1957 to 1958. Four examples remain in Germany. The three aforementioned types all had outside frames suitable for gauges from to . In 1957 and 1959, 18 examples of Type Ns 4 c were built, designed for rail gauges from to and which already had the exterior of the V 10 C. No surviving example is known. Of the outside frame series from the year 1958, at least two of the locomotives had the new superstructure, although certainly not all of them. Whether this intermediate series should be designated as Ns 4 b or Ns 4 c is not absolutely clear. In the DR there were at least 3 locomotives of Type Ns 4 b, of which all have survived. Their histories are given below. = 199 007 = The DR bought locomotive no. 250029/1957 from VEB Feinspinnerei Venusberg in 1972 and deployed it until 1991 in Wilischtal on the industrial line of the paper factory, VEB Papierfabrik Wilischthal (Thumer Netz). It was given no. 199 007\\\\. In 1992 it was sold to the Preßnitz Valley Railway Society. = 199 008 = In 1957 the locomotive with factory number 250027 was delivered to the VEB Kieswerk Ottendorf-Okrilla gravel works with a gauge of . In 1962 it was regauged to and transferred to the sugar factory, VEB Zuckerfabrik Döbeln. In 1970 they sold it to the VEB Gießerei foundry and engineering works of \\"Ferdinand Kunert\\" (GISAG) at Schmiedeberg and operated it as loco no. 2 on the factory siding. In 1987 they sold it to the DR who and used it as \\"199 008\\", later as \\"399 702\\" for various tasks include the dismantling of the Preßnitz Valley Railway and on the industrial railway of the paper factory, VEB Papierfabrik Wilischtal. In 1993 it was sold to the Döllnitz Valley Railway. = 199 103 = In 1957 locomotive 250026 was delivered to the ballast works of VEB Schotterwerk Althüttendorf with a gauge of . Later it was sold to the brick factory of VEB Ziegelwerk Ueckermünde and regauged to . In 1983 the DR bought it for the \\"Berline Pioneer Railway\\" (Pioniereisenbahn Berlin, today the Berlin Park Railway). It was given the designation 199 103\\\\. 399 603 (199 103) Berlin, 3 Mai 1992 199 103 Berlin, 2 September 1996  LKM V 10 C  199 006 stored in Nordhausen 199 102 of the Berlin Park Railway The locomotives of Type V 10 C were further developed by LKM Babelsberg from the Ns 4, production of which had ceased in 1958. The first engines were delivered in 1959. They inherited the drive concept from the Ns 4, which was achieved once again via a jack axle under the driver's cab with coupling rods to the axles. Once again four gears were provided. On locomotives up to gauge the axles had an outside frame, on larger gauges they had an inside frame. The engines were equipped with air-cooled diesel engines, 6 KVD 14.5 SRL generating , made by the VEB Diesel Engineering Works at Schönebeck. Two , metre-gauge, examples of this type, built in 1964, initially in service in Gotha at an industrial firm, went to the Spreewald Railway in 1970. There they were given numbers 100 905 and 906; from 1973: 199 005 and 006. Later they went to the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways. They were retired in 1991 but were given, on paper at least, numbers 399 112 and 113. No. 199 005 is now with the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways Society. Two locos of this type used on the Berlin Park Railway in Berlin (formerly the Pioniereisenbahn Wuhlheide) were numbered as 199 101 and 102 in DR vehicle fleet.

It generalizes the linear case of predator–prey interaction firstly described by Volterra and Lotka in the Lotka–Volterra equation. A trophic function represents the consumption of prey assuming a given number of predators. The trophic function (also referred to as the functional response) was widely applied in chemical kinetics, biophysics, mathematical physics and economics. In economics, \\"predator\\" and \\"prey\\" become various economic parameters such as prices and outputs of goods in various linked sectors such as processing and supply. These relationships, in turn, were found to behave similarly to the magnitudes in chemical kinetics, where the molecular analogues of predators and prey react chemically with each other. These inter-disciplinary findings suggest the universal character of trophic functions and the predator–prey models in which they appear. They give general principles for the dynamic interactions of objects of different natures, so that the mathematical models worked out in one science may be applied to another. Trophic functions have proven useful in forecasting temporarily stable conditions (limit cycles and/or attractors) of the coupled dynamics of predator and prey. The Pontryagin L.S. theorem on the inflection points of trophic functions guarantees the existence of a limit cycle in these systems. Trophic functions are especially important in situations of chaos, when one has numerous interacting magnitudes and objects, as is particularly true in global economics. To define and forecast the dynamics in this case is scarcely possible with linear methods, but non-linear dynamic analysis involving trophic functions leads to the discovery of limit cycles or attractors. Since in nature there exist only temporarily stable objects, such limit cycles and attractors must exist in the dynamics of observed natural objects (chemistry, flora and fauna, economics, cosmology). The general theory suggests as-yet-unknown regularities in the dynamics of the various systems surrounding us. Despite the success already achieved in research on trophic functions, the field still has great further theoretical potential and practical importance. Global economics, for instance, needs tools to forecast the dynamics of outputs and prices over a scale of at least 3–5 years so as to maintain stable demand and not over-produce, and to prevent crises such as that of 2008.

It is considered to be the oldest English-language book on hunting.The earlier Art de vénerie, by Twiti, huntsman of Edward II, ca 1327, though written in England, was in Norman French;The Middle English text of The Art of hunting by William Twiti: edited from an uncatalogued manuscript in a private collection, Ashton-under-Lyne ; with a parallel text of the Anglo-Norman L'Art de venerie by William Twiti, edited from Cambridge, Gonville and Caius College, MS 424/448. is the most recent and accurate scholarly presentation of this work, by David Scott-Macnab, 2009. 3825355195 The Master of Game was first printed in 1904 in modernised English by William and Florence Baillie-Grohman, with an essay on medieval hunting, and a foreword by then-American President and noted hunter Theodore Roosevelt. Overview Gaston III, Count of Foix, Book of the Hunt, 1387–88 Written between 1406 and 1413 by Edward, second Duke of York, The Master of Game is mostly a translation of an earlier work by Gaston Phoebus entitled Livre de chasse,Of its thirty-six chapters only five are original; the Duke's text is printed in italics in the 1904 edition, which is drawn from the early 15th- century Cottonian MS Vespasian B, xii. and is considered to be the oldest English language book on hunting. Edward held the position of master of game during the reign of Henry IV and in a prologue dedicated the book to Henry, Prince of Wales, later to become Henry V, as a set of instructions on how to proceed with the hunt. Although The Master of Game is mostly based on the earlier work, Edward added an additional five chapters which dealt with English hunting, including comprehensive coverage of hunting for deer and hare in the English style. Several chapters from the previous work were also omitted, including sections on the ibex and the reindeer which were not relevant quarry for medieval Englishmen. Other chapters omitted included those on trapping and the conduct of hunts in France. Modern publication The work was first published as a printed work in 1904, with multiple later editions, including a foreword by Theodore Roosevelt who at the time was President of the United States and modernised by William Adolf Baillie Grohman and his wife Florence. It included some of the illustrations from the original French Livre de Chasse, and also added a glossary to explain the meaning and terms of medieval hunting. At the time it was republished, only nineteen copies of the original text were known, two of the best preserved copies were on the shelves of the British Library and one in the Bodleian Library. A further reprint was made in paperback in 2005, which was a straight reprint of the 1909 edition including the black and white reproductions of the original illuminations.

Convection and release of latent heat transports energy from the surface into the upper atmosphere. Clouds have a higher albedo than the underlying ocean, which causes more incoming solar radiation to be reflected back to space. Since the tops of tropical systems are much cooler than the surface of the Earth, the presence of high convective clouds cools the climate system. The most recognizable cloud system in the tropics is the hurricane. In addition to the important climatic effects of tropical weather systems, hurricanes possess enough energy to cause massive death and destruction. Therefore, their accurate prediction is of utmost importance. Cloud microphysics describe the structure and properties of clouds on the microscopic scale. Background The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) was launched in 1997 to provide quantitative estimates of rainfall over the entire tropics. The satellite uses remote sensing techniques to convert the radiance recorded at the sensor to rainfall values. The most important variable used to constrain the measurements is the properties of the hydrometeors. Hurricanes are mixed-phase clouds, meaning that liquid and solid water (ice) are both present in the cloud. Typically, liquid water dominates at altitudes lower than the freezing level and solid water at altitudes where the temperature is colder than -40 °C. Between 0 °C and -40 °C water can exists in both phases simultaneously. In addition to the phase, the solid water hydrometeors can have different shapes and types that need to be accounted for in the radiative transfer calculations. In Autumn 1999, the TRMM-Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) field experiment sampled continental and oceanic tropical clouds in Brazil. The goal of TRMM-LBA was to validate the rainfall in cloud resolving models. There have been several in-situ observations of cloud microphysics in tropical clouds which will be discussed here. Cloud microphysics are the physical processes that describe the growth, decay, and fallout of precipitation particles. In terms of models, cloud microphysics occur on a scale smaller than the grid- scale of the model and have to be parameterized.Fovell, R.G., K.L. Corbosiero, and H.C. Kuo, 2009: Cloud Microphysics Impact on Hurricane Track as Revealed in Idealized Experiments. J. Atmos. Sci., 66, 1764–1778. Hurricane track forecasts have been getting better in recent years. Looking at the example of Hurricane Rita, the forecast of the National Hurricane Center 36 hours before landfall shifted more than 130 kilometers from the previous forecast, causing an unneeded evacuation. There has been research that has shown that the choice of subgrid-scale parameterization schemes can influence hurricane intensity, track, speed, and precipitation rates. Microphysical assumptions may directly or indirectly modulated storm structure, which result in small changes in the hurricane track which can have societal consequences. Hydrometeor formation and shapes The shape of liquid water drops is generally spherical because of the effects of surface tension. Depending on the size of the drop the friction of the air flowing past a falling drop may squish the bottom on the drop so that it is slightly non-spherical. However, solid ice does not generally form into nice spherical shapes. Ice crystals have a preference to form hexagonal structures by deposition, but can form odd shapes in the presence riming or aggregation into graupel. The shape of ice particles is mostly dependent on the temperature and supersaturation where the form. The supersaturation is mostly dependent upon the speed in the updraft regions. In regions of high updraft, there are more hydrometeors formed. Graupel is found mostly in regions of weak updrafts. Particle size tends to decrease with increasing altitude because at lower altitudes the larger particles collide and aggregate with the smaller particles. Because updrafts are important for cloud microphysics, it is also necessary to consider how convection parameterization schemes may influence microphysics. Small errors in the parameterization of the particle size distribution can have large impacts on the calculation of the terminal velocity. The composition, size, and number concentration of particles varies dramatically in stratiform and convective regions. The particle fall speed derived from observations of tropical cyclones varies significantly from those derived from midlatitude systems.McFarquhar, G.M., and R.A. Black, 2004: Observations of Particle Size and Phase in Tropical Cyclones: Implications for Mesoscale Modeling of Microphysical Processes. J. Atmos. Sci., 61, 422–439. There have been many studies of the feasibility of modifying hurricanes so that they would not be as destructive. Rosenfeld et al. (2007) studied possible modification of hurricane Katrina (2005). They simulated the seeding of the hurricane by suppressing all warm rain formation in the outer regions of the hurricane. They report that in their simulation the seeded hurricane initially weakened the surface winds in the region of seeding. The eye of the hurricane eventually contracted and became stronger, but the average of the total wind field was weaker. In this best case scenario, they report that seeding reduced the hurricane-force winds by 25%.Rosenfeld, D., A. Khain, B. Lynn, and W.L. Woodley, 2007: Simulation of hurricane response to suppression of warm rain by sub-micron aerosols. Atmos. Chem. Phys., 7, 3411-3424. Rango and Hobbs (2005) obtained in situ measurements of tropical convective systems. They found that the liquid water content was below adiabatic values. This was true even in newly formed updrafts, suggesting that collision-coalescence and/or entrainment mixing are efficient methods for the removal of liquid water. They noted that the effective radius started to decrease at altitudes above 2–4 km above cloud base, which they attribute to the warm rain process. Ice processes became important at temperatures between -4 °C and -10 °C, and they photographed different shapes including needles, frozen drops, and sheaths. In growing clouds, it was noted that the particle size often grew by riming.Rangno, A.L., and P.V. Hobbs, 2005: Microstructures and precipitation development in cumulus and small cumulonimbus clouds over the warm pool of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc., 131, 639-673. Tokay et al. (2008) studied the raindrop size distribution in topical cyclones. They found high concentrations of small and middle sized drops regardless if larger drops were present. The total number of droplets was between 600–1000 m−3, the liquid water content was around 1 g m−3, and a rain rate of approximately 20 mm per hour. The droplets had a mean mass diameter of ~1.6 mm and the maximum diameter recorded was 4.11 mm. There results indicate that prior rain rate estimates from tropical cyclones may have been underestimated due to the differences in microphysics between midlatitude and tropical storms.Tokay, A., P.G. Bashor, E. Habib, and T. Kasparis, 2008: Raindrop Size Distribution Measurements in Tropical Cyclones. Mon. Wea. Rev., 136, 1669–1685. In-situ measurements of the microphysics of tropical clouds in the Amazon show that in regions of stronger updrafts contained smaller supercooled water droplets or ice particles than weaker updrafts. In stratiform anvil regions, aggregation into graupel was the main growth mechanism. The speed of the updraft determines if warm rain processes, riming, or aggregation are the primary mechanism of growth in updraft regions.Stith, J.L., J.E. Dye, A. Bansemer, A.J. Heymsfield, C.A. Grainger, W.A. Petersen, and R. Cifelli, 2002: Microphysical Observations of Tropical Clouds. J. Appl. Meteorol., 41, 97–117. Heymsfield et al. (2002) also looked at the microphysics of tropical convection, but they limited themselves to the stratiform regions. They observed ice particles of many shapes and sizes. In particular, they noted that rimed particles were found near convective regions, small spheres were found in regions of \\"transient convection\\", and at low temperatures cirrus crystals formed. They constructed particle size distributions and noted that they fit particularly well to Gamma distributions and slightly less well to exponential distributions. They noted that their results were similar to results derived from midlatitude systems.Heymsfield, A.J., A. Bansemer, P.R. Field, S.L. Durden, J.L. Stith, J.E. Dye, W. Hall, and C.A. Grainger, 2002: Observations and Parameterizations of Particle Size Distributions in Deep Tropical Cirrus and Stratiform Precipitating Clouds: Results from In Situ Observations in TRMM Field Campaigns. J. Atmos. Sci., 59, 3457–3491. Parameterization There are several different cloud microphysics parameterization schemes. Depending on the sophistication of the scheme, the number of ice-phase categories can vary. Many schemes use at least three categories: cloud ice, graupel, and snow. The classification of ice into categories is necessary because different forms of ice will fall at different velocities. Typically, microphysics schemes will use a mass-weighted average for the fall velocity. McFarquhar and Black (2004) showed that different parameterizing methods results in dramatically different terminal velocities of the hydrometeors. Intensity The presence of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) influences the number of cloud drops that form in a cloud; the more CCN there are, the more cloud droplets that will form. Changes in the CCN concentration and their associated changes in the cloud drop distribution can redistribute the energy within a hurricane. This was known in the 1960s which lead scientists to think that hurricanes could be modified by the addition of CCN to produce less intense hurricanes. It was proposed that by seeding with silver iodide outside the eyewall would freeze the supercooled water, release more latent heat, and increase convection.Willoughby, H., D. Jorgensen, R. Black, and S. Rosenthal, 1985, Project STORMFURY: A Scientific Chronicle 1962–1983. Bull. Amer. Meteor. Soc., 66, 505–514. This method was ultimately unsuccessful because of the lack of supercooled water in the tropical cyclone. A different approach seeds the clouds with a large number of small hygroscopic aerosols. The large number of CCN leads to smaller raindrops, less collision- coalescence, and thus less rainout. This water is convected above the freezing level, leading to warming in the upper atmosphere and greater convection. There have been several modeling studies on the effects of increased CCN on hurricane intensity. Rosenfeld et al.. (2007) used the Weather Research Model (WRF) to simulate hurricane Katrina, and then turned off the warm rain processes to approximate the effects of adding a large number of CCN. They report that they were successful in simulating key features of Katrina in the control run including the minimum central pressure and maximum wind speeds. When the warm rain processes were removed, the cloud water content naturally increased and the rain water content decreased. The warm rain suppression also changes the thermodynamic structure of the hurricane: temperatures are decreased at low levels at the outer edge of the hurricane. Later, the peak winds decreased along with the central pressure. Zhu and Zhang (2006) used a mesoscale model to simulate the 1998 Hurricane Bonnie. They report that their control run was reasonably able to simulate the observed hurricane. They then ran a series of sensitivity experiments to examine how changes in the microphysics influence the hurricane.Zhu, T., and D.L. Zhang, 2006: Numerical Simulation of Hurricane Bonnie (1998). Part II: Sensitivity to Varying Cloud Microphysical Processes. J. Atmos. Sci., 63, 109–126. The various sensitivity runs were focused on the effects of ice processes. They report that the tropical cyclones exhibit a large sensitivity in the intensity and core structures to ice phase processes. As the ice processes are removed, the intensity of the cyclone decreases without the Bergeron process. When graupel processes are removed, the storm weakens but not as much as when all ice processes are removed. And when evaporation is turned off, the storm increases in intensity dramatically. They conclude that melting and evaporation processes are important in amplifying tropical cyclones. Different cumulus parameterization schemes were derived for different situations. The Betts- Miller scheme (or the derivative Betts-Miller-Janjic) attempts to ensure that the local vertical temperature and moisture structures be realistic. The Betts-Miller(-Janjic) scheme is often used when simulating tropical cyclones.Davis, C., and L.F. Bosart, 2002: Numerical Simulations of the Genesis of Hurricane Diana (1984). Part II: Sensitivity of Track and Intensity Prediction. Mon. Wea. Rev., 130, 1100–1124. Davis and Bosart (2002) simulated Hurricane Diana (1984) which underwent extratropical transition. They used the Betts-Miller-Janjic cumulus parameterization scheme in two ways: one with the parameters set for midlatitude systems and the other for tropical systems. They not that when the parameterization scheme is set for midlatitude systems the simulation produces a more realistic track and storm intensity. However, the tropical simulation produces a more realistic rainfall field. Pattnaik and Krishnamurtil (2007) simulated hurricane Charley of 2004 to assess the impact of cloud microphysics on hurricane intensity. They report that their control run was successful in simulating the track, intensity, speed and precipitation.Pattnaik, S. and T.N. Krishnamurti1, 2007, Impact of cloud microphysical processes on hurricane intensity, part 1: Control run. Meteo. and Atmos. Phys., 97, 117-126. They used the microphysics scheme from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. This scheme uses five different classifications of cloud water: liquid cloud water, cloud ice, rain water, snow, and hail/graupel. It also allows for supercooled water. Their study attempts to show how fall speed and intercept parameters can influence the tropical cyclone intensity. The size distribution of precipitation particles is parametrized as: :::N(D)=N0e−λDdD where N is the number of precipitation particles between a given diameter D and D + dD, N0 is the intercept parameter, λ is the slope parameter, and D is the diameter of the particles.Pattnaik, S. and T.N. Krishnamurti1, 2007, Impact of cloud microphysical processes on hurricane intensity, part 2: Sensitivity experiments. Meteo. and Atmos. Phys., 97, 127-147. They used the same model and microphysics scheme, turning off different microphysical mechanisms to understand which ones are the most important. They note that modifications to the microphysics scheme dramatically impacted the hurricane intensity. The most intense hurricanes were when melting was suppressed, or when no evaporation was allowed. They interpret this as meaning that the energy needed to either melt or evaporate the particles could instead be used to heat the air column, which increased convection leading to a stronger storm. During the weakest simulated storm, the fall speed of the snow and graupel particles was increased. The increased rate of fallout also increased the evaporation, leading to weakened convection. Changes in the intercept parameter showed little change. This implies that the total number of particles does not matter as much as the relative distribution between different sizes of particles. A series of simulations which principally looked at how cloud microphysics affect hurricane track also revealed that subgrid-scale turbulent mixing parameterization schemes influenced the intensity of a hurricane simulation more than its track. Track Results from Fovell and Su (2007) Top: WRF model simulation of Hurricane Rita tracks. Bottom: The spread of NHC multi-model ensemble forecast. Though not the main goal, two work of Rosenfeld et al.. (2007) noted that in their simulations that the suppression of warm rain through the addition of large amounts of aerosols will cause the tropical cyclone to divert eastward. Zhu and Zhang (2006) report that the hurricane track was not sensitive to cloud microphysical processes except for very weak storms, which were pushed to the east. In a series of sensitivity studies, Pattnaik and Krishnamurti conclude that microphysical processes have little effect on hurricane track. Davis and Bosart (2002) considered, among other things, the effects of cumulus parameterization on tropical storm track. They found that changes in potential vorticity at the tropopause can cause changes in the wind field. Specifically, different schemes have different methods of parametrizing the potential vorticity which results in different tracks. They found that the Betts-Miller- Janjic and Grill schemes produced a more westward track than Kain-Fritsch. The Kain-Fritsch scheme tended to intensify the storm too rapidly but produced the best track compared with observations. The simulated tracks of more intense storms tends to be farther to the east compared with weaker storms. Davis and Bosart also point out that their results differ from previous sensitivity studies on cumulus parameterizations which found that the Betts-Miller-Janjic scheme tended to have better results. They attribute this difference to the differences in grid spacing between the studies. The first paper published that specifically looked at the impacts of cloud microphysics on hurricane track wa Fovell and Su (2007).Fovell, R.G., and H. Su, 2007: Impact of cloud microphysics on hurricane track forecasts. Geophys. Res. Lett., 34, L24810. They use simulations of Hurricane Rita (2005) and an idealized hurricane simulation to see how different microphysical parameterization and convection schemes change the hurricane track. They compared the effects of the Kessler (K), Lin et al. (L), and the three class WRF single moment (WFR3) schemes, coupled with the effects of Kain-Fritsch (KF), Grell-Devenyi (GD), and Betts- Miller-Janjic (BMJ) convective parameterization schemes. The hurricane that most similarly simulated Rita's track was when the WSM3 microphysics scheme was paired with BMJ convection. The worst simulated track was when the K microphysics was paired with KF convection, which produced a weaker storm that tracked well west of the actual storm. The spread from simply changing the microphysics and cumulus convection parameterization schemes produced the same spread in hurricane tracks as the National Hurricane Center ensemble. They also note that the biggest difference between the microphysics parameterizations is that K does not include any ice phases. The differences between the crystalline nature of cloud ice and snow, compared with the spherical nature of raindrops, and the semi-spherical shape of graupel will likely produce different fall velocities when frozen water is included in the parameterizations. They used the most accurate member of the Rita simulations and changed the microphysics so that the fall speed of the ice particles would have the same fall velocity as if they were liquid raindrops with the same mass. They report that this changed the track of the hurricane so that it tracked further to the west, similar to the K scheme. In addition to simulating Hurricane Rita, Fovell and Su (2007) also made the same simulations as before, but on a smaller grid size so that cumulus parameterization was not needed. They found that the hurricane produced by the K scheme was weaker than the rest and had the most westward track. They conclude that the different implicit microphysical assumption in the different schemes can change the hurricane track on forecasting timescales. In general, their results suggest that larger-sized hurricanes will track further westward, which is consistent with \\"beta drift\\". When an idealized set of hurricanes was produced with no large-scale flow, with variable Coriolis parameter, they found that the hurricanes still moved in the northeast to north-northeast direction. However, the different microphysical schemes tracked at different directions. Since there was no large-scale flow, they conclude that the differences in the track represent changes in the vortex motion caused by changes in the microphysics. On a constant f-plane experiment, there was no movement of the storms. They note that variations among the NWS consensus model results could be primarily due to how the different models parameterize their cloud microphysics and other subgrid-scale processes. Recently, Fovell et al. (2009) conducted a modeling study of hurricanes in idealized environments. The model had a constant sea surface temperature, no background wind, but with Earth rotation. They then inserted a vortex with varying microphysics schemes and noted that the tracks diverged. They used the same microphysics schemes as F07, and like F07 the noted that the K storm moved faster and further westward than storm produced with other microphysics schemes. An earlier study by Fiorino and Elsberry (1989) showed that hurricane track and speed can be changed by simply changing the tangential winds in the outer part of the storm because they helped determine the orientation and strength of the beta gyres.Fiorino, M.J., and R.L. Elsberry, 1989: Some aspects of vortex structure related to tropical cyclone motion. J. Atmos. Sci., 46, 975-990. The F09 storm with the K microphysics parameterization had the largest eye and the strongest winds at large radii, while the L storm was most intense and WSM3 had the most compact eye. F09 noted that storm with stronger outer winds tracked more to the northwest than storms with weak winds. They hypothesize that this can be explained with an atmosphere in hydrostatic balance. Assuming an atmosphere that is in hydrostatic balance, the average column virtual temperature contributes the most to the surface pressure. The virtual temperatures of the three F09 storms varied with the Kessler storm having temperatures several degrees warmer than the other storms. The winds are determined by the radial pressure gradients, which are related to the temperature gradients. Therefore, storms that have a large radial variation in virtual temperature will have stronger outer winds. The temperature differences between the models can be explained by the change in radiative heating and cooling. The K microphysics scheme produced particle fall speeds that were slower than the others, thereby increasing the size of its anvil. F09 report that the most important factor that influences the size of the anvil is the terminal velocity, and that the terminal velocity of the particles depends on their geometry, density, and size. Interactions between the anvil and incoming and emitted radiation changes the radial temperature gradient, leading to changes in the track direction. Fovell et al. conclude that the choice of microphysics schemes can lead to changes in the terminal velocities of the particles in the anvil which could lead to increases or decreases in the size of the anvil. Schemes that produce heavier particles that will fall faster (like K) produce worse results. They conclude by warning that any changes in storm track or speed that are initially caused by microphysics could be amplified by other dynamic factors such as the steering flow or sea surface temperatures.

It ran to silver jubilee at Mumbai and at other centers. Khayyam composed very good music. Plot Deepak (Rajesh Khanna) is accused of killing a courtesan, Munnibai and a trial take place in court. His lover Seema (Hema Malini) appears against him as public prosecutor and gets him life imprisonment. Seema remembers her days with Deepak three years ago, when both were ardent lovers and how she loved him. Both consider themselves as married and united by their souls. Deepak wants to meet Seema and she unwillingly meets him in jail. Deepak explains to her how fate brought him into jail. Deepak is a lawyer and looks for good opportunities in his career. He has a sister Sushma (Poornima Jayaram), the only family he has left in this world. Seema introduces Deepak to her father, who dislikes their relationship, but pretends to accept them. Seema's father urges her to pursue her law career in America, but she refuses as she does not want to leave Deepak for three years. Deepak persuades her to go ahead and Seema obeys him, hoping to get married after three years. After Seema has left, Seema's father shows Deepak his real face and orders Deepak to go away from Seema and Deepak does not accept. Deepak's sister Sushma has got engaged with a man named Ajit and Deepak arranges for their marriage. Ajit initially behaves well, understanding Deepak's financial position, but turns evil when Seema's father tempts him with money to ask for dowry during their marriage and Ajit does so. Unable to get as much money as Ajit asked for, Deepak goes to Seema's father for help. Seema's father agrees to help him on the condition that he should marry another girl and leave Seema forever. Unwillingly, Deepak accepts for his sister's sake and marries another woman. But his wife dies in a year after giving birth to their son Vicky. Left alone with his child, Deepak's misfortune chases him when Ajit kills a courtesan Munnibai. Deepak takes the blame on himself and lands in jail. Seema understands her father's role behind everything and wants to make an appeal on the verdict, but Deepak stops her. He requests her to take care of his child Vicky and accept him as her son, to which Seema promises. Seema becomes mother of Vicky and raises him and Deepak spends his life in jail. As years passed, Vicky (Rajesh Khanna) returns from America after completing his studies and Deepak gets released from prison. He does not want Vicky to know that he is his father as he is very unlucky man and his misfortunes should not affect his son. Vicky brings his lover Poonam (Poonam Dhillon) and introduces her to his mother. Deepak gets a job of gardener in Poonam's house and Vicky becomes a successful lawyer, replacing his mother Seema as public prosecutor. Deepak feels happy on seeing his son whenever he visits Poonam's home. Poonam and Vicky get engaged and everything goes smooth until the arrival of Ajit, who is now an evil drunkard. Ajit blackmails Seema that he wishes to meet Vicky and tell about Deepak to him. Seema yields to his blackmail as she does not want to break the promise made to Deepak about exposing the father-son relationship to Vicky. In due course, Ajit is killed and Deepak is accused of killing him. Vicky appears as public prosecutor against him without knowing that he is his father and demands imprisonment for Deepak. Seema appears in defence for Deepak. Seema struggles hard to keep up the promise given to Deepak, but Vicky tests her patience severely.

The French naturalist Jacques Labillardière originally described it in 1805. Within the genus Adenanthos, it lies in the section Adenanthos and is most closely related to A. stictus. A. cuneatus has hybridized with four other species of Adenanthos. Growing to high and wide, it is erect to prostrate in habit, with wedge-shaped lobed leaves covered in fine silvery hair. The single red flowers are insignificant, and appear all year, though especially in late spring. The reddish new growth occurs over the summer. It is sensitive to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, hence requiring a sandy soil and good drainage to grow in cultivation, its natural habitat of sandy soils in heathland being an example. Its pollinators include bees, honey possum, silvereye and honeyeaters, particularly the western spinebill. A. cuneatus is grown in gardens in Australia and the western United States, and a dwarf and prostrate form are commercially available. Description Adenanthos cuneatus grows as an erect, spreading or prostrate shrub to high and wide. It has a woody base, known as a lignotuber, from which it can resprout after bushfire. The wedge-shaped (cuneate) leaves are on short petioles, and are long and wide, with 3 to 5 (and occasionally up to 7) rounded 'teeth' or lobes at the ends.Wrigley (1991): 61–62.Nelson (1995): 331. New growth is red and slightly translucent. It glows bright red against the light, especially when the sun is low in the sky. New growth is mainly seen in summer, and the leaves in general are covered with fine, silvery hair. Occurring throughout the year but more often from August to November, the insignificant single flowers are a dull red in colour and measure around long. The pollen is triangular in shape and measures in length, averaging around . The species is similar in many ways to its close relative A. stictus. The most obvious difference is in habit: the multi-stemmed, lignotuberous A. cuneatus rarely grows over in height, whereas A. stictus is a taller single-stemmed non-lignotuberous shrub that commonly reaches in height. Leaves are similar, but the lobes at the leaf apex are regular and crenate (rounded) in A. cuneatus, but irregular and dentate (toothed) in A. stictus.Nelson (1978): 389. Also, new growth does not have a red flush in A. stictus, and juvenile leaves of A. stictus are usually much larger than adult leaves, a difference not seen in A. cuneatus. The flowers of the two species are very similar, differing only subtly in dimension, colour and indumentum.Nelson (1975b): 139–144. Taxonomy=Discovery and naming Although the precise time and location of its discovery are unknown, Jacques Labillardière, botanist to an expedition under Bruni d'Entrecasteaux, which anchored in Esperance Bay on the south coast of Western Australia on 9 December 1792, most likely collected the first known botanical specimen of Adenanthos cuneatus on 16 December while searching the area between Observatory Point and Pink Lake for the zoologist Claude Riche, who had gone ashore two days earlier and failed to return. Following an unsuccessful search the following day, several senior members of the expedition were convinced that Riche must have perished of thirst or at the hands of the Australian Aborigines and counselled d'Entrecasteaux to sail without him. However, Labillardière convinced d'Entrecasteaux to search for another day, and was rewarded not only with the recovery of Riche, but also with the collection of several highly significant botanical specimens, including the first specimens of Anigozanthos (Kangaroo Paw) and Nuytsia floribunda (West Australian Christmas Tree) and, as aforementioned, A. cuneatus.Nelson (1975b) 1:24 Thirteen years passed before Labillardière published a formal description of A. cuneatus, and in the meantime several further collections were made: Scottish botanist Robert Brown collected a specimen on 30 December 1801, during the visit of HMS Investigator to King George Sound; and, fourteen months later, Jean-Baptiste Leschenault de La Tour, botanist to Nicolas Baudin's voyage of exploration,Nelson (1975a): 332. and \\"gardener's boy\\" Antoine Guichenot collected more specimens therein. The official account of Baudin's expedition contain notes from Leschenault on vegetation: Labillardière eventually published the genus Adenanthos, along with A. cuneatus and two other species, in his 1805 Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. He chose the specific name cuneata in reference to the leaves of this species, which are cuneate (triangular).Nelson (1975b) 2: A126. This name has feminine gender, consistent with the gender assigned by Labillardière to the genus.Nelson (1978): 320. He did not designate which of the three published species was to serve as the type species of Adenanthos, but Irish botanist E. Charles Nelson has since chosen A. cuneatus as lectotype for the genus, since the holotype of A. cuneatus bears an annotation showing the derivation of the genus name, and because Labillardière's description of it is the most detailed of the three, and is referred to by the other descriptions.Nelson (1978): 318, 320. Synonymy In 1809, Richard Salisbury, writing under Joseph Knight's name in the controversial On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, published the name Adenanthes flabellifolia, listing A. cuneata as a synonym. As no type specimen was given, and no specimen annotated by Knight could be found, this was treated as a nomenclatural synonym of A. cuneata and was therefore rejected on the principle of priority.Nelson (1978): 387. Also synonymised with this species is Adenanthos crenata, published by Carl Ludwig Willdenow's in Kurt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel's 1825 16th edition of Systema Vegetabilium. Willdenow published both A. cuneata and A. crenata, giving them different descriptions but designating the same type specimen for both. Thus A. crenata was rejected under the principle of priority, and is now regarded as a nomenclatural synonym of A. cuneatus. Infrageneric placement In 1870, George Bentham published the first infrageneric arrangement of Adenanthos in Volume 5 of his landmark \\"Flora Australiensis\\". He divided the genus into two sections, placing A. cuneata in A. sect. Stenolaema because its perianth tube is straight and not swollen above the middle. This arrangement still stands today, though A. sect. Stenolaema is now renamed to the autonym A. sect. Adenanthos. A phenetic analysis of the genus undertaken by Nelson in 1975 yielded results in which A. cuneatus was grouped with A. stictus. This pairing was then neighbour to a larger group that included A. forrestii, A. eyrei, A. cacomorphus, A. ileticos, and several hybrid and unusual forms of A. cuneatus.Nelson (1975b) 1: 123, 124. Nelson's analysis supported Bentham's sections, and so they were retained when Nelson published a taxonomic revision of the genus in 1978. He further subdivided A. sect. Adenanthos into two subsections, with A. cuneata placed into A. subsect. Adenanthos for reasons including the length of its perianth,Nelson (1978): 320, 321. but Nelson discarded his own subsections in his 1995 treatment of Adenanthos, for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. By this time, the ICBN had issued a ruling that all genera ending in -anthos must be treated as having masculine gender; thus the specific epithet became cuneatus. Inflorescence Red new growth of A. cuneatus, Torndirrup National Park The placement of A. cuneatus in Nelson's arrangement of Adenanthos may be summarised as follows: :Adenanthos ::A. sect. Eurylaema (4 species) ::A. sect.

Other than some dubious collections in the 1830s and 1840s, no further sightings are known to have been made until 1973, when Nelson rediscovered it. At the time it was regarded as a distinct species, but by 1995 it was thought to be a hybrid, and this was confirmed by genetic analysis in 2002. In appearance it is very similar to A. sericeus, but its leaf segments are flat rather than cylindrical. * A single plant discovered by Nelson near Israelite Bay, where both putative parents are found, is regarded as a hybrid between A. cuneatus and A. dobsonii. Leaves are mostly triangular like those of A. cuneatus, but whereas A. cuneatus leaves are mostly five- lobed, the putative hybrid usually has three lobes, with the occasional leaf being entire like those of A. dobsonii (though A. cuneatis itself occasionally bears entire leaves). Leaves of the putative hybrid lack the thick indumentum of A. cuneatus, being bright green with a sparse indumentum like that of A. dobsonii. Flower colour is like that of A. cuneatus but the style lacks an indumentum, like A. dobsonii.Nelson (1978): 391. * Two plants found near Twilight Cove are regarded as hybrids between A. cuneatus and A. forrestii, the only two Adenanthos species to occur in the area. One was discovered by Nelson in 1972, the other by Alex George in 1974. They are about 5 km apart, and differ somewhat. The leaves are triangular and flat like those of A. cuneatus, but the leaves of mature shoots are very long and narrow, and the leaves of younger shoots are deeply lobed.Nelson (1978): 392. * In his 1995 revision, Nelson refers to putative hybrids with A. dobsonii and A. apiculatus, citing the 1978 paper in which he published putative hybrids with A. dobsonii and A. forrestii. It is unclear whether the reference to A. apiculatus is an error or a fourth putative hybrid. Common names This species has several common names, some highly localised. Two names allude to its consumption by horses; bridle bush, a name used east of Esperance, refers to the fact that horses favour it as fodder; and sweat bush, used around Hopetoun, derived from the claim that horses break out in sweat after consuming young growth. The common name of flame bush derives from the brilliant red new growth. It is also known as coastal jugflower. Nelson also records the use of the names Templetonia and native temp, but ridicules them as obvious errors. Distribution and habitat Distribution of A. cuneatus, shown on a map of Western Australia's alt=a map of Western Australia with the floristic regions delineated, and an area in the bottom marked in red The most widely distributed Adenanthos species of the south coast,Nelson (1975b): 299. A. cuneatus is common and locally abundant between King George Sound and Israelite Bay, along the coast and up to inland, with isolated populations extending west to Walpole and the Stirling Range, and as far east of Israelite Bay as Twilight Cove.Nelson (1978): 388. This species is restricted to siliceous sandplain soils and will not grow in calcareous soils such as the limestone plains of the Nullarbor, or even siliceous dunes with limestone at little depth.Nelson (1975b): 262, 268. This restriction explains the disjunctions east of Israelite Bay: the species occurs only in those few locations where the existence of cliff-top dunes of deep siliceous sand provide suitable habitat.Nelson (1975b): 311. Provided the soil is siliceous and fairly dry, A. cuneatus tolerates a range of edaphic conditions: it grows in both lateritic sand and sands of marine origin,Nelson (1975b): 252. and it tolerates pH levels ranging from 3.8 to 6.6.Nelson (1975b): 254. Consistent with these edaphic preferences, A. cuneatus is a frequent and characteristic member of the kwongan heathlands commonly found on the sandplains of Southwest Australia. The climate in its range is mediterranean, with annual rainfall from .Nelson (1975b): 261. Ecology Colletid bees of the genus Leioproctus visit Adenanthos cuneatus flowers. A 1978 field study conducted around Albany found the honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus) occasionally visited Adenanthos cuneatus, while the western spinebill much preferred the species to other flowers. A 1980 field study at Cheyne beach showed that the New Holland honeyeater and white-cheeked honeyeater pollinate it A 1985–86 field study in the Fitzgerald River National Park found that the nectar-feeding honey possum occasionally eats it. The silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) feeds on nectar from the flowers, and has also been observed taking dew-drops from leaves early in the morning. Adenanthos cuneatus is known to be susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, but reports on the degree of susceptibility vary from low to high. A study of Banksia attenuata woodland southeast of Perth across 16 years, and following a wave of P. cinnamomi infestation, showed that A. cuneatus populations were not significantly reduced in diseased areas. Phosphite (used to combat dieback) has some toxic effects in A. cuneatus, with some necrosis of leaf tips, but the shrub uptakes little of the compound when compared with other shrubs. Specimens in coastal dune vegetation showed some sensitivity to the fungus Armillaria luteobubalina, with between a quarter and a half of plants exposed succumbing to the pathogen. Cultivation 'Coral Drift' Adenanthos cuneatus was taken to Great Britain in 1824, and has been grown in cultivation in Australia and the western United States. Its attractive bronzed or reddish foliage is its main horticultural feature, along with its ability to attract birds to the garden. It requires a well-drained position to do well, but will grow in full sun or semi-shade, and tolerates both sand and gravelly soils. George Lullfitz, a Western Australian nurseryman, recommends growing it as a rambling ground cover in front of other shrubs, or in a rockery. The following cultivars exist: *A. \\"Coral Drift\\" is a compact form in cultivation since at least the 1990s. It is tall and wide. The grey foliage has pinkish purple new growth. *A. \\"Coral Carpet\\" is a prostrate form which peaks at around high and spreads to across. The new foliage is a pinkish purple. A chance seedling from 'Coral Drift', it was originally developed by George Lullfitz of Lullfitz Nursery in Wanneroo. It became available to the public in 2005, and has been registered successfully under Plant Breeders' Rights.

Accident The DC-7B, earmarked for delivery to Continental Airlines, took off from the Santa Monica Airport at 10:15 a.m. on its first functional test flight, with a crew of four Douglas personnel aboard. Meanwhile, in Palmdale to the north, a pair of two-man F-89J fighter jets took off at 10:50 a.m. on test flights, one that involved a check of their on-board radar equipment. Both jets and the DC-7B were performing their individual tests at an altitude of 25,000 feet in clear skies over the San Fernando Valley when, at about 11:18 a.m., a high-speed, near-head-on midair collision occurred. Investigators were later able to determine that the two aircraft most likely converged at a point over an area northeast of the Hansen Dam spillway.C.A.B. DOCKET # SA-323, FILE #2-0020, DATE ADOPTED November 22, 1957, p. 5. Following the collision, Curtiss Adams (1929-2002), the radarman aboard the eastbound twin-engine F-89J Scorpion, was able to bail out of the stricken fighter jet and, despite incurring serious burns, parachuted to a landing onto a garage roof in Burbank, breaking his leg when he fell to the ground. The fighter jet's pilot, Roland E. Owen, died when the aircraft plummeted in flames into La Tuna Canyon in the Verdugo Mountains.C.A.B. DOCKET # SA-323, FILE #2-0020, DATE ADOPTED November 22, 1957, p. 1. The DC-7B, with a portion of its left wing sheared off, remained airborne for a few minutes then rolled to the left and began an uncontrollable, spiraling, high-velocity dive earthward. In doing so, it began raining debris onto the Pacoima neighborhoods below as the aircraft began to break apart. Seconds later, part of the hurtling wreckage slammed onto the grounds of the Pacoima Congregational Church, killing all four Douglas crewmen aboard while the major portions fell onto the adjacent playground of Pacoima Junior High School. On the school playground, where some 220 boys were just ending their outdoor athletic activities, the wreckage broke upon impact into numerous pieces and intense fires began due to the aircraft's fuel and oil. Distinct craters were made in the playground by each of the four engines and the main center fuselage section. Two students, Ronnie Brann, 13, and Robert Zallan, 12, were struck and killed by this wreckage and debris. A third gravely injured student, Evan Elsner, 12, died two days later in a local hospital. An estimated 75 more students on the school playground suffered injuries ranging from critical to minor.http://www.joangushin.net/crashpictures.html Future rock 'n' roll legend Ritchie Valens was a 15-year-old student at Pacoima Junior High School at the time of the disaster, but was not at school that day because he was attending the funeral of his grandfather. The collision was blamed on pilot error and the failure of both aircraft crews to exercise proper “see and avoid” procedures regarding other aircraft while operating under visual flight rules (VFR). The crash also prompted the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) to set restrictions on all aircraft test flights, both military and civilian, requiring that they be made over open water or specifically approved sparsely populated areas.C.A.B.

It is situated in the Baraga Seminary, which was built by architect Jože Plečnik in the center of Ljubljana. In the 1980s, it became a center of theatrical research and politically-engaged theater. It is known for a wide range of innovative poetics of different directors and an ensemble energy, a Peter Brook-like approach to acting with a laboratory for theatre research for actors, directors, choreographers and musicians to research, develop, and create.  History =Introduction Mladinsko Theatre was founded in 1955 by Balbina Baranovič, the directress who also founded the first experimental theatre company in Slovenia. Throughout its history, the theatre has collaborated with the theatre reformers that shaped the Slovenian theatre during the second half of the 20th century. The Mladinsko Theatre's development progressed with contemporary theatre practices of the reformers of the Slovenian theatre during the second half of the 20th century, including directors Žarko Petan, Mile Korun, Dušan Jovanović, Ljubiša Ristić, Meta Hočevar, Paolo Magelli, Janez Pipan, Vito Taufer, Tomaž Pandur, Eduard Miler, Matjaž Pograjc, Martin Kušej, Dragan Živadinov, Emil Hrvatin, Tomi Janežič, Matjaž Berger, Jan Decorte, Diego de Brea, Jernej Lorenci, Ivica Buljan, Silvan Omerzu, Oliver Frljić, Borut Šeparović and Damjan Kozole. 1970s In the early 1970s, Slovenian playwright Dominik Smole became managing director of the theatre and ensured that the Mladinsko presented artistically demanding youth performances. The Mladinsko was on the theatre margin, which allowed many different creative energies to congregate there. The political powers deemed the theatre unimportant, which enabled organizational and programmatic changes to be made. The 1970s also marked a time of crisis at the Drama Ljubljana (the Slovene National Theatre, Ljubljana), where circumstances prevented the development of the kind of contemporary theatre which Mladinsko started developing with the arrival of Dušan Jovanović. 1980s During the next decade – when Petar Jović became the managing director and Dušan Jovanović the artistic director (with the help of the dramaturg Marko Slodnjak), followed by Ivo Svetina – was marked by the projects by Ljubiša Ristić, especially Missa in a minor, which began the series of projects that marked the Mladinsko as the nexus of the political and at experimental theatre. Around the mid-1980s, poetics that were not bound to \\"actual political\\" began to appear, first with the projects by Vito Taufer, then the performances by Janez Pipan and Scheherezade by Ivo Svetina, directed by Tomaž Pandur, and Dragan Živadinov's projects. This line has continued from the 1990s through the present in the form of diversity and auto-poetics in performances such as those by Eduard Miler, Matjaž Pograjc, Emil Hrvatin , Tomi Janežič, Matjaž Berger, Diego de Brea and a wide range of contemporary theatre artists. 1990s Under the artistic leadership of Eduard Miler, Tomaž Toporišič, Matjaž Berger, and, in the last few seasons of the current director of the theatre Uršula Cetinski, Mladinsko became a setting for the wealth of diversity, while remaining the Slovenian centre of theatre research. The strong accents of Martin Kušej (Scandal after Cankar), Meta Hočevar (A Family Album), Matjaž Pograjc (Roberto Zucco, Fragile!), Emil Hrvatin (Male Fantasies), Eduard Miler (Susn, The Mission), Tomi Janežič (Oedipus Rex, Utva), Matjaž Berger (Galileo Galilei, Interpretacija sanj), Diego de Brea (The Damned, Crime and Punishment), Ivica Buljan (Young Flesh), Jernej Lorenci (Gilgamesh), Vinko Möderndorfer (Blasted), Barbara Novakovič, Vlado Repnik, Ivan Peternelj, Jan Decorte, Sebastijan Horvat, Damjan Kozole, Silvan Omerzu, and many others, have, together with Taufer's research of an extremely wide territory of theatre function (such as the performances Silence Silence Silence, Pippi, and Midsummer Night's Dream) and the projects of Dragan Živadinov resulted in the aesthetically most diverse period in the history of the theatre that the critical machinery in Slovenia – due to the limited tools with which it was operating, and ideological altercations of the political left, connected to the so-called independent or \\"dependent\\" production – didn't know to contextualize or couldn't analyse.  Activities  Together with several representatives of the so-called independent scene, the Mladinsko Theatre of the last two-and-a-half decades has been a place of creation which has brought strong impulses into the more institutional Slovenian theatre. The impulses moved in the direction of Richard Kostelanetz's \\"theatre of combined ways of expression for the post-literary age\\". On the one hand, it emphasises \\"meta-theatricality\\" as defined by Bonnie Marranca, (for instance, the focusing upon the third paradigm of the spectator and their perception and, on the other hand, the double coding of theatre springing from the tactics of the historical neo-avant-gardes, post-avant-gardes and political performances of the second half of the 20th century. The tactics of epicization, formalist and energy theatre, the stage of the landscape, of parataxis, simultaneity, play with the density of signs, musicalization, visual dramaturgy, intrusions of the real, the scenic essay, heterogeneity, metonymic space, framing, scenic montage, aesthetics of speed, aesthetics vs. the real body, intermediality – to use the terminology used by Hans-Thies Lehmann for the analysis of the postdramatic – all this has taken the Mladinsko Theatre into the heterogeneous spheres of contemporary performing arts at the meeting points of various artistic mediums that have constantly enriched and added to the theatrical field. The placement of these phenomena into the international and festival theatre space was extremely important. Today, when audience members are ensconced in the post post-socialist era of the so-called transition period in Slovenia, the historic distance enables them to claim that without this support from abroad, Mladinsko as an example of contemporary theatre wouldn't have survived. The positive response in Europe and the Americas was critical for the continuation of the research. Thus, the duality occurred: Mladinsko was relatively marginalized in Slovenia, while abroad it represented Slovenian art, culture and even the country. Awards In 1969, the city of Ljubljana gave the theatre the Župančič Award for special achievements as an “exceptional example of communal creative will for quality conveying theatre art to wider circles”. In 2008, the European Commission awarded the theatre the honorary title of European Cultural Ambassador, on the grounds of its international activity and the quality of its performances.

A design can be considered print design if its final form was created through an imprint made by the impact of a stamp, seal, or dye on the surface of the paper.\\"print, n. and adj.2.\\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 30 November 2016.  History  There are several methods used to create print design artworks, spanning more than five hundred years. Printing technologies available throughout history heavily influenced the style of designs created by graphic designers at the time of production, as different methods of creating print design offer varying features.Hollis, Richard. Graphic Design: A Concise History. New York: Thames and Hudson, 1994. Print. Before the emergence of the design and printing technologies of the twentieth and twenty-first century such as the inkjet printer, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe InDesign, print design relied on mechanical technologies such as the letterpress and lithography.  Letterpress  Letterpress from the earliest days of printing Metal type blocks arranged for printing with a letterpress The letterpress, perfected in the mid fifteenth century by Johannes Gutenberg (1398-1468) through the combined use of the printing press, oil-based inks, and cast metal type, remained the most common and efficient method of printing until the 1960s.Eskilson, Stephen. Graphic Design: A New History. New Haven: Yale UP, 2007. Print. Used frequently with typography design and type layout, the letterpress operates through the stamping of type and photo-engraved metal blocks on paper. The metal blocks are arranged in a frame by the printer, and the text columns and etchings are separated by vertical or horizontal metal bars; it is even possible to arrange the blocks at an angle using a letterpress.Becker, Lutz, and Richard Hollis. Avant-Garde Graphics 1918-1934: From the Merrill C. Berman Collection. London: Hayward Gallery, 2004. Print. With the letterpress, print design and graphics remained black and white print on paper until the late nineteenth century. The letterpress was the first technology that allowed for mass production and distribution of printed material at a large scale, and because of this, quickly replaced the slow processes of woodblock printing and hand copying of print design.  Lithography  Lithographic stone artwork Lithography, introduced at the end of the nineteenth century, allowed for the use of color in prints and allowed artists to print on larger surfaces than the letterpress. Additionally, lithography enabled artists to draw their own lettering on designs, which was not possible with the letterpress. The design was drawn directly onto the stone by the artist, and then transferred onto the surface of the paper.  Uses  Print design remains prevalent in society through all forms of communicative design. The importance of printed visual design was highlighted during the first world war, as posters helped to inform and instruct the audience. A short list of print design's uses today includes: * Posters * Brochures * Flyers * Packaging labels * Business cards * Book covers * Book design and layout * Magazines * Banners * Receipts * Shopping bags References Category:Graphic design Category:Communication design ","title":"Print design"},{"id":"26618116","text":"Phoenix Home & Garden is a monthly magazine based in Phoenix, Arizona, USA.

The gabT motif has been detected exclusively in bacteria within the genus Pseudomonas, and is found only upstream of gabT genes, and downstream to gabD genes. Although it is agreed that the gabT and gabD genes encode a transaminase and dehydrogenase, respectively, it is less clear what substrates they operate on. Evidence suggests that they catalyze the transamination of GABA and the dehydrogenation of the product to form succinate, an intermediate in the Krebs cycle. But it was also shown that they can produce glutarate from delta-aminovalerate (via transamination and dehydrogenation reactions) as part of the degradation of lysine. Both the gabD and gabT genes were shown, in various experiments, to be induced by metabolites such as agmatine and lysine that would fit with either of the two activities just mentioned for the products of gabD/gabT. The gabT RNA is probably not participating in this mode of regulation, unless it can regulate the upstream gene. The predicted Shine-Dalgarno sequence (ribosome- binding site) is contained within the stem-loop called \\"P2\\" in some gabT RNAs, and nearby to the \\"P1\\" stem-loop in those gabT RNAs that do not use a P2 stem- loop.

Biography  Born in Detroit, Michigan to Polish-American auto workers with strong union ties, she lived in Chicago and New York before moving to San Francisco in 1950. There, she soon discovered the literary scene in North Beach, where she became friends with many of the area's Beat poets, including Allen Ginsberg, Kenneth Rexroth, and Ruth Weiss. She was also in a significant long-term relationship with poet Jack Gilbert during the latter part of that time period. Ulewicz was a great influence on his early work; in fact much of his characteristic style for which he was later well-known came directly from her, and his acclaimed first book Views of Jeopardy was dedicated to her.Gilbert, Jack (1962). \\"Views of Jeopardy\\", viii. Ulewicz refused to ever be branded a Beat herself. In 1955, at the height of media attention on North Beach and the Beats, she left for Seattle to study with Stanley Kunitz where her work took on a more formally structured approach. In 1960 she traveled in Europe, eventually moving to London where she met with THE GROUP at Edward Lucie-Smith's and joined with other members to give public readings of their work. She won the Guinness Poetry Award at the Cheltenham Literature Festival in 1964. Her chapbook The Inheritance was published by Turret Press in 1967.Ulewicz, Laura (1967). \\"The Inheritance\\", Turret Books, London. Retrieved on 2010-02-09. In 1965, Ulewicz returned to live in San Francisco's Haight- Ashbury district, the new Hippy neighborhood, where she opened and managed the I-Thou Coffee House. There, she organized poetry readings, art exhibits and folk concerts. Shortly after her return, a Penguin editor wrote to propose a volume in which her work would be joined with Denise Levertov and Sylvia Plath. Six months later he wrote back to say that he could not get his fellow editors and marketing to support a book of three women poets.Richardson, Anthony. Letter to Laura Ulewicz. 17 June 1964. During the late 60s, she hosted a radio program on KQED-FM in which writers read and were interviewed.

Initially, she worked at a local tomato cannery, but was later employed with Child Protection Services in the county's Social Welfare Department. After retirement, she managed an art gallery in Locke. Always an inveterate gardener, she raised various kinds of garlic and everlasting flowers to sell at farmers’ markets.

A preliminary sketch of the painting that was given to Delacroix's student Louis de Planet is also kept in the museum. Description and analysis This large painting depicts the last hours of the life of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, as Delacroix admired the Stoics and particularly Marcus Aurelius. The character is represented in the center of the painting as an old, sick man who grabs the arm of a young man dressed in red, namely his son Commodus (Lucius Aurelius Commodus Antoninus). Commodus seems not to pay attention to what his father wants him to say and has a haughty look. Around them, Marcus Aurelius' philosopher friends who are present around the bed are portrayed as sad men dressed in black. Thus, the painting represents the end of the Roman Empire. Delacroix, who was fascinated by the red color after his travel to North Africa in 1832, draws the viewer's attention to Commodus by garbing him in bright red. It appears that the painting has no moral aspect, as the message that Delacroix wanted to convey in this work remains unknown. Reception The first text which speaks of the painting is the catalog of the Salon of 1845 where it was exposed, which reads: \\"The figure of Marcus Aurelius, indeed sick and almost dying, seems to us in a too early decomposing state; the shades of green and yellow which hammer his face give him a quite cadaverous appearance\\", \\"some draperies may be too crumpled\\" and \\"some attitudes show a lack of nobility\\". The work received mostly negative reviews, but the writer Charles Baudelaire appreciated it and said: \\"A beautiful, huge, sublime, misunderstood picture [...]. The color [...], far from losing its cruel originality in this new and more complete scene, is still bloody and terrible\\".

Early life He was fourth son of Sir Richard Pole (d. 1505), by his wife Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury, and the younger brother of Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu and of Cardinal Reginald Pole. He was one of the knights made by Henry VIII at York Place in 1529.METCALFE, Book of Knights, p. 61Chronicle of Henry VIII of England, translated from the Spanish by Martin A. Sharp Hume - Cal. Henry VIII, vol. iv. No. 6384 Soon afterwards, or before 9 July 1528, he married Constance Pakenham, the elder of the two daughters and co-heirs of Sir Edmund Pakenham, Gentleman Usher to Catherine of Aragon, who died in 1528 and by whom he became possessed of the Manors of Eastcourt and Lordington at Racton in West Sussex, Sussex. From 1531, his name is met with in commissions of various kinds, including Justice of the Peace for both for Hampshire and for Sussex, and member of Parliament for Wilton beginning in 1529. Like the rest of his family, he greatly disliked Henry VIII's proceedings for a divorce from Catherine of Aragon. In 1532, when the king went over to Calais with Anne Boleyn to meet Francis I of France, he crossed the sea in disguise, and keeping himself unseen in the apartments of his brother, Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu, who had gone over with the king, stole out at night to collect news. Montagu sent him back to England to inform Queen Catherine that Henry had not succeeded in persuading Francis to countenance his proposed marriage with Anne Boleyn. Next year, however, his name appears set down, not with his own good will, among the knights appointed 'to be servitors' at Anne Boleyn's coronation on 1 June 1533. He was paid £40 for that service.Cal.

No. 750, p. 283 Geoffrey was also in the confidence of French ambassador and the bishop of London, John Stokesley. As T.F. Mayer puts it \\"In short, Geoffrey had a much higher profile in the opposition to Henry VIII's policies than his mother or his brother, Henry Pole, Lord Montagu.\\" Pilgrimage of Grace and imprisonment In 1536, on the suppression of the smaller monasteries, he purchased from the commissioners such goods as then remained of the abbey of Dureford in Sussex, near Lordington.Sussex Archaeological Collections, vii. 224 In the end of that year, he is said to have commanded a company, under the Duke of Norfolk, against the northern rebels at Doncaster; but his sympathies were really with the rebels, and he was determined beforehand not to act against them.ib. xxi. 77 Norfolk, however, was aware that the insurgents were too strong to be attacked, and Sir Geoffrey had no occasion to desert the royal standard. A letter of Lord De la Warr, perhaps misplaced in the ' Calendar' in October 1536, speaks of his causing a riot by a forcible entry into Slindon Park, which he was afterwards ordered in the king's name immediately to quit.Cal.

For nearly two months, Geoffrey lay in prison; on 26 October a set of interrogations was administered to him, first about words dropped by himself in private conversation, when he had discussed an English religious policy with his brother, Henry, and next about letters and messages he, his mother, or others of his family had received. Much of the evidence he gave was instrumental in condemning both his brother and mother to the scaffold, primarily because of their loyalty to Princess Mary and the Catholic church. On 4 December 1538, he pleaded guilty at his trial for treason and then attempted twice to commit suicide. He was pardoned on 4 January 1539, but the experience seems to have led to a mental breakdown.Alison Weir, Britain's Royal Family: A Complete Genealogy (London, U.K.: The Bodley Head, 1999), p. 136.Charles Mosley, editor, Burke's Peerage and Baronetage, 106th edition, 2 volumes (Crans, Switzerland: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 1999), volume 1, pp.-16 and 228. Exile After his mother's execution, many of the Pole family lands were seized by the crown, but some were returned to Geoffrey in 1544. In 1548, he fled England and found his way to Rome, and threw himself at the feet of his brother, Cardinal Reginald Pole, saying he was unworthy to be called his brother for having caused another brother's death. Cardinal Pole brought him to the pope for absolution and afterwards sent him into Flanders to the bishop of Liege, allowing him an allowance of forty crowns a month. There he chiefly lived until the close of Edward VI's reign. His wife and family, however, were still at Lordington, and he had a strong desire to return to England. In 1550, he visited Sir John Mason at Poissy, while on a journey to Rouen. He explained that he was riding up and down that summer to see countries and begged Mason to procure leave for him to return to England. He continued to campaign to return home. In 1552, his son Arthur was released from prison and went to serve the Duke of Northumberland. Geoffrey wrote to the duke, asking for a safe conduct home. Despite these efforts, he was excepted from the general pardon granted at the end of the parliament in 1552.Tytler's England under Edward VI and Mary, i. 313; STRYPE, Heel.

He was attended in his last illness by Father Peter de Soto. His widow Constance, who made her will on 1 or 2 August 1570 and died after 12 August 1570, desired to be buried beside him.

Career Daniel started as a disc jockey at age seventeen on Armed Forces Radio with the US Navy. His first commercial job was at KXYZ in Houston in 1955 and he then worked at WDGY in Minneapolis before moving to WMCA in 1961. His first broadcast at WMCA was on August 18, 1961. He started on the graveyard shift overnight but from 1962 to 1968 he played the top 40 hits from 4 pm to 7 pm -- the evening drive home slot. The station produced a survey of the current sales in New York record stores and Dandy Dan gave the countdown of the week's best sellers every Wednesday in this late afternoon slot. In 1966, he participated in a tour of Africa to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the Peace Corps. Then, from 1968 to 1970, he did the early morning drive- to-work slot before leaving WMCA after nearly nine years; his final broadcast was on July 11, 1970. Daniel was heard coast-to-coast on NBC Radio's Monitor in the summer of 1973 and was the announcer on the 1974–1975 game show The Big Showdown. He subsequently worked on WYNY-FM where he hosted the mid-day slot and later morning and afternoon drives. He then did a stint at WHN playing country music before returning to WYNY-FM. Finally, he moved to WCBS-FM in 1996. He retired from WCBS on December 31, 2002. Style Daniel was one of the personalities promoted as the \\"Good Guys\\" while working for the New York Top 40 radio station WMCA in the 1960s, when bands like The Beatles were transforming the music scene. He performed too and was the first to record the song \\"Is That All There Is?\\" He was tall –— and so his theme tune was \\"Big Boss Man\\", as performed by Charlie Rich. One of his catchphrases was \\"I love you ... and especially you, size nine.\\" \\"Size nine\\" was once revealed to be his wife, Rosemary. One technique used by Daniel was to research his audience. He felt that it was important to communicate in a personal way with them: Death Daniel died on June 21, 2016 after falling in his home the previous day.

Founded in 1851, it has had many notable members and played an important early role in the history of mycology in Britain. Foundation The Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club was founded in 1851 \\"for the practical study, in all its branches, of the Natural History of Herefordshire and the districts immediately adjacent\\". The club was and still is based in the city of Hereford, but took its name from the Woolhope Dome, an outcrop of Silurian rocks around the village of Woolhope to the south-east of the city. The club's first field meeting was held in the Woolhope area.Anon. (1856). Transactions of the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club 1. The club's Transactions have been published regularly since 1856, and early issues suggest that the membership took an interest not only in geology, but in fossils, botany, meteorology, ichthyology, and entomology. In 1856, the botanist George Bentham (who lived at Pontrilas) was an honorary member, as were the geologists the Rev. Peter Bellinger Brodie, William Henry Fitton, Leonard Horner, Sir Charles Lyell, Sir Roderick Murchison, Prof. John Phillips, and the Rev. Prof. Adam Sedgwick, the botanist John Lindley, the naturalist Sir William Jardine, and the zoologist Prof. Robert E. Grant. The geologist the Rev. William Samuel Symonds was a founder member and president of the club in 1855. In 1871, Sir James Rankin, a wealthy member of the club, offered to pay for a \\"Public Library and Museum in connection with the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club\\". This building, with natural history carvings and gargoyles on its frontage and a purpose-built meeting room for the club, was duly erected in Hereford in 1873.Collins, W. (1900). A Short History of Hereford, p. 105. It remains the city's main public library, museum & art gallery and the club's headquarters. The Herefordshire Pomona Since Herefordshire was and is renowned for its cider and perry, an early project of the club was to document and conserve local apple and pear cultivars. To this end, the club held annual exhibitions of local fruit, inviting leading pomologists to help identify samples collected or submitted from local orchards. Under the enthusiastic direction of founder and past president of the club, Dr Henry Graves Bull, two local artists, his daughter Edith Elizabeth Bull and Alice Blanche Ellis, were engaged to paint watercolours of the fruit, whilst an honorary member, Dr Robert Hogg, vice-president of the Royal Horticultural Society, wrote text to accompany the paintings. The result was the Herefordshire Pomona, a major publication for the club, issued in parts between 1878 and 1884, with over 400 paintings reproduced as hand- coloured lithographs. The Herefordshire Pomona was an expensive work – and is now even more so, a copy being offered for $19,500 in 2009. Since the club wished the book to be of practical use, a revised but inexpensive version of the text, called The Apple and Pear as Vintage Fruits, was published in 1886. The Pomona itself is now available on CD. \\"A foray among the funguses\\" Dr Henry Graves Bull also had an enthusiasm for fungi and in 1867 read a paper at a club meeting on some local, edible species. This seems to have stimulated the interest of the club and in 1868, the October field meeting – announced as \\"a foray among the funguses\\" – was devoted to collecting fungi. The foray, led by the noted mycologist Worthington G. Smith and local expert Edwin Lees, was followed by a special fungus dinner. The event proved popular and the \\"foray\\" was repeated annually till 1892. These Woolhope fungus events became so well known that the word \\"foray\\" was widely adopted for mycological field meetings and remains the standard term today, not only in Britain but in North America and elsewhere. For a time, the club functioned as a precursor to the British Mycological Society, bringing together a number of contemporary British mycologists, many of whom attended the forays and contributed papers to the Transactions. By 1882, honorary members included the mycologists Rev. Miles Joseph Berkeley, C. E. Broome, Mordecai Cubitt Cooke, William Phillips, C. B. Plowright, Worthington G. Smith, and Rev. J. E. Vize. Ordinary members included Rev. W. L. W. Eyre.Anon. (1888). Transactions of the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club 1881–82: ix–xii. The Old Straight Track An attendee at the 1891 fungus foray was Alfred Watkins, subsequently to become a president of the club. Watkins was a keen photographer and archaeologist. In June 1921, whilst mapping old sites near Blackwardine, Watkins noticed some surprising alignments which suggested to him a series of prehistoric trackways marked by ancient landmarks some of which were still visible. Later that year, he delivered a talk to the club on \\"Early British Trackways\\" and after further researches published his thesis and his findings in The Old Straight Track (1925). His book was not well received by academics, but Watkins' theory of ley lines gained followers and a resurgence of interest in the 1970s, when it acquired a mystic dimension which would have surprised Watkins himself. Current activities The Woolhope Club still organises a series of field meetings each year, with special interest groups for archaeological research, geology, and natural history. To mark the 150th anniversary of the club a book, A Herefordshire Miscellany, was published in 2000.

Although Shadow Tower Abyss was ranked 14th overall and had been released mid-week, only 12,908 units were sold in Japan in the period from 20 to 26 October 2003. SCEA was also worried at the game's visual quality in comparison with its contemporary rivals within the role-playing and first-person genres. Johnson went on to say that the cancellation was \\"by far the hardest thing for me to accept and I did everything possible to fight for its release\\". A petition to SCEA was unsuccessful. Instead, Agetec went on to publish one of From Software's other games, Echo Night: Beyond, in the United States in 2004. Plot The game is set within the citadel first featured in Shadow Tower, and sees the return of a number of familiar non-player characters. The protagonist, an explorer, is in search of an arcane spear thought to have given great powers to the long- dead ruler of the kingdom, and ushered in an age of unrivalled prosperity. What remains of the kingdom today is largely covered over by the forest, save for the tower itself. Once inside the citadel, the protagonist encounters a mysterious Old Man, who traps him within and forces him to climb to the very top of the structure to escape. Rurufon, a female non-player character, returns from Shadow Tower. Gameplay Shadow Tower Abyss is played entirely from the first-person perspective, and requires the player to navigate through a series of catacombs, caverns and open-air walkways in an effort to ascend the tower. There are numerous regions within the citadel, including subterrean forests, hellish caverns, waterfalls and temple-like chambers. While exploring, the player encounters a variety of friendly and aggressive characters, and collects keys, armour and up to 500 different weapons. Furthermore, the game features the ability to wield two weapons, a detail that allows players to easily switch between a handgun and a dagger, for example. Unlike Shadow Tower, the sequel does not feature a multiplayer mode. The game world is populated with a total of 68 monsters and non-player characters, who \\"seem to have regular schedules and activities--that take place independent of [one's] actions--such as burning a bonfire and talking amongst themselves\\". The majority are aggressive and attack the protagonist on sight, while others provide information and serve to further the plot. During battle, players can sever segments of a creature's body with knives and decapitate them with carefully placed shots from their firearm. Indeed, the wings of aerial combatants can be targeted with a sniper rifle, causing them to plummet to earth when struck. Additionally, the game's Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) results in opponents often fleeing from the player when injured. Typical to a number of games within the role-playing genre, Shadow Tower Abyss features a statistics-orientated character development system. Unusually, however, the protagonist does not gain experience points, but 'grows' by destroying the numerous denizens of the tower and harvesting their souls. Thus, over time the player will gradually become stronger and inflict comparatively more damage. This 'growth' mechanic is also found in the game's predecessor, and serves to encourage players to explore as much as possible. Hit points, which represent the life force of the player, and magic points, for casting spells, are determined by additional mental and physical attributes. Vitality, for example, directly affects the number of hit points, while Strength influences the maximum weight that can be carried. Break, Pierce and Slash each determine the damage done by the relevant melee weapon, whether it be a hammer, dagger, or an axe. In addition, certain items grant permanent or temporary bonuses to the player's attributes. A Soul Pod, for example, will grant the player an extra twenty points for any attribute, while the Symbol of Elements increases the magical Elements statistic by fifty percent for a brief period. Although there are firearms spread throughout the game, ammunition is scarce, and the various melee weapons are all durable. If the player uses their axe excessively, for example, it will eventually deteriorate to the point of breaking. While replacement weaponry can be found in containers and retrieved from corpses, the game features a number of different shops, which are each represented by glowing crystalline structures: Merchants (green), Blacksmiths (purple) and Healers (red). 'Cunes' are the game's unit of currency, and are typically looted from cadavers. In addition, there are save points, which are represented by a cyan crystal.  Reception  The Japanese gaming publication Famitsu gave the game a score of 30 out of 40. Legacy In 2009, From Software revisited the dark fantasy role-playing genre with the critically acclaimed Demon's Souls on the PlayStation 3 (PS3). As with Shadow Tower Abyss, Demon's Souls centres on the collection of the souls of the dead as a means of developing the statistics and equipment of one's character. Also like Abyss, Sony once again declined to publish Demon's Souls overseas, and instead publishing rights for the American release were obtained by Atlus. While IGN reported that the game had sold out in Japan, with 39,689 units shipped during its first week, the game also fared well in the United States with 150,000 units sold by October 2009 and 250,000 by mid-March 2010. Given its overseas performance, Yeonkyung Kim, a Sony employee responsible for localisation, remarked that the company's decision not to publish world-wide was \\"a mistake\\", and Demon's Souls should have \\"come out as a first-party title\\". As the spiritual successor to Shadow Tower Abyss and the King's Field series, the game received multiple accolades, obtaining a Metacritic ranking of 90.

Ransom (January 10, 1831—July 11, 1897) was a United States Army officer and veteran of the American Civil War. He is notable for having commanded Union Army artillery units throughout the conflict. Early life Dunbar Ransom was born at Fayetteville, North Carolina on January 10, 1831 and raised in Vermont. He was the son of Colonel Truman B. Ransom and brother of General Thomas E. G. Ransom.Wyllys Cadwell Ransom, Historical Outline of the Ransom Family of America, Ann Arbor: Richmond & Backus, 1903, p. 29.

He served on the West Coast of the United States, and was promoted to first lieutenant on December 31, 1856. Ransom participated in the later stages of the Yakima War in an expedition during 1858 that culminated in the Battle of Four Lakes near Spokane, Washington.H. H. Bancroft, History of California, vol. 24, pp. 465-466. War Service Following the outbreak of war, Ransom was promoted to the rank of captain on November 1, 1861. He was assigned command of Battery L of the 3rd Artillery.General Orders of the War Department … 1861, 1862 & 1863 …, New York: Derby & Miller, 1864, p. 264. However, Ransom soon took command of Battery C, 5th U.S., accompanying the Pennsylvania Reserves at the Second Battle of Bull Run.War of the Rebellion, series 1, volume 12, part 2, p. 256. Ransom's battery remained with the Reserves when they joined I Corps of the Army of the Potomac in time for the Battle of Antietam. Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, who led the division at Antietam, praised Ransom's battery for its support of the Reserves as they advanced into and beyond the Cornfield.Report of Brig. Gen. George G. Meade, U. S. Army, Commanding Third Division At The Battle of Antietam Battery C supported the Reserves at the Battle of Fredericksburg, where their attack penetrated the Confederate right flank for a time. During the following year, the battery served with the second division of I Corps at the Battle of Chancellorsville.War of the Rebellion, series I vol. 19 pt. 1, p. 172, vol. 21, p. 517, vol. 25 pt. 1, p. 158. After Chancellorsville, the Union artillery was reorganized. The Reserve Artillery was grouped into brigades. Ransom's battery joined the First Regular Brigade, and Ransom took command of the larger formation. Lt Gulian V. Weir took command of his battery.War of the Rebellion, series I vol. 25 pt. 2, p. 585. The other batteries were Battery H 1st U.S. (Lt Chandler P. Eakin), Batteries F and K 3rd U.S. (Lt John G. Turnbull) and Battery C 4th U.S. (Lt Evan Thomas).War of the Rebellion, series I vol. 27 pt. 1, p. 167. At the Battle of Gettysburg, the brigade was not engaged until July 2, 1863. Eakin's battery served on Cemetery Hill. The other batteries served on Cemetery Ridge or in advance of that ground. On July 2 the batteries of Turnbull and Thomas were advanced toward the Emmitsburg Road to support the advanced position of second division III Corps. Turnbull was posted near the Rogers House and Weir near the Codori Farm. The batteries were forced back by the attack of Richard H. Anderson’s division.Harry Pfanz, Gettysburg: the Second Day, Chapel Hill : University of North Carolina Press, 1987, p. 364 map 15-1. Ransom was wounded by a sharpshooter while leading Turbull's battery into position. He slid from his horse as a result of this wound.Pfanz, pp. 358-359. The account is different in Bradley M. Gottfried, The Artillery of Gettysburg, Nashville: Cumberland House, 2008, p. 137, where the wound is attributed to artillery fire. Weir's battery lost three guns in the same action. In later years, brooding over this loss, Weir was driven to take his own life in 1886.Pfanz, pp. 377-378. The batteries of Thomas, Weir, and Trumbull all served on Cemetery Ridge during the Confederate bombardment and unsuccessful assault on July 3. The First Regular artillery brigade lost 68 casualties in two days of fighting. After Gettysburg, the battery was sent to New York City following the New York Draft Riots of July 13–16.War of the Rebellion, series I vol. 29 pt. 2, p. 145. After returning to the Army of the Potomac with Battery C, Ransom was assigned to the 2nd brigade of Horse Artillery under Capt. William M. Graham. The battery served in the Bristoe Campaign and the Mine Run Campaign during the fall of 1863.War of the Rebellion, series I vol. 21, pp. 5, 517. When campaigning resumed in the spring of 1864, Ransom had succeeded Graham in command of the 2nd Horse Artillery Brigade. He led this formation in the Overland Campaign, including the Battle of the Wilderness and the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House.War of the Rebellion, series I vol. 33, p. 1049, vol. 36, pp. 116, 209. Later in the campaign, all the Horse Artillery apparently was consolidated under the command of Capt. James M. Robertson. This was the situation until just before the beginning of the Siege of Petersburg, when Ransom resumed command of his brigade.War of the Rebellion, series I vol. 40 pt. 2, p. 551, vol. 46 pt. 3, p. 1040. In late 1864, Ransom was transferred to the Union Army of the Shenandoah, where he commanded the consolidated Batteries C, F and K of the 3rd U.S. Artillery. His battery was involved in the Battle of Berryville, but it was on detached duty at the time of the Battle of Opequon.Personal Memoirs of P. H. Sheridan, New York: Charles L,.

During the war Ransom received brevet promotions to major (December 13, 1862), lieutenant colonel (July 3, 1863), and colonel (August 25, 1864). Post war Ransom remained on active duty after the war, reverting to his permanent rank of captain. In 1872 Ransom was charged with conduct unbecoming an officer for having borrowed money to facilitate travel from one military assignment to another, and resorting to deceit to avoid repaying it, and he was dismissed from the service.The Daily Picayune, Friday, July 16, 1897, pg. 4. He then undertook railroad work with the Fort Worth and Denver Railway. Later he was aided by Grenville M. Dodge, the president of the railroad, who brought the matter of Ransom's dismissal to the attention of Congress. In 1892 a Congressional investigation determined that Ransom had not been deceitful, that his Army pay had been delayed for more than a year because of his travel between posts at the time of the loan, and that he had not intentionally avoided repaying the debt. Further, Congress determined that even if Ransom had intentionally tried to avoid repaying the debt, that would have been a private matter and not professional conduct unbecoming an officer. In 1894 Congress restored Ransom to the Army's rolls and transferred him to the retired list, enabling him to qualify for a pension.U. S. Statutes at Large, vol. 28 (1894), p. 995.

Vampires Their metamorphosis is not nearly as startling as their lycan counterparts. When they metamorphose, their eyes turn a shade of electric blue or bright gold, while their upper canine teeth lengthen to become pointed fangs. At all times, the upper lateral incisors and upper canine teeth on all vampires are elongated and come to a sharp point. Biologically immortal transgenics, the vampires of Underworld display most of the prominent superhuman physical prowess commonly seen in popular culture, including superhuman strength, reflexes and speed, as well as an inhuman resistance to injury and accelerated healing. These abilities are maintained by feeding on blood, which is a prominent factor in their healing capabilities in additiona to being strengthened with age. They do not possess any of the mystical weaknesses of mythological vampires (crosses, holy water, garlic, stakes, etc.); however, they are highly vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation. They can also die from a broken neck, blood loss, nightshade poisoning, dismemberment, mutilation and other extreme physical trauma, especially if their head or heart is destroyed or removed. The oldest vampires, the Elders, are, by consequence of their great ages, therefore the most powerful of their race, even stronger than Lycans in werewolf form. In the novelizations, the Vampire population as a whole is referred to as the \\"Vampire Nation\\", consisting of covens; traditionally, before the events of Evolution, the two main covens were the Old World Coven (based in Hungary, in the environs of Budapest, with branch covens all-over the Euro-Asian continent), and the New World Coven (based in the United States, in New York). But since the assassinations of the Vampire Elder, Lady Amelia, and the Vampire Council, by the Lycans, the Vampire Elder, Lord Viktor's death at Selene's hand after learning the truth of her family's deaths at his hands, the final Vampire Elder, Lord Marcus' destruction of the main branch of the Old World Coven and its seat of power, Ördögház, and then his death at Selene's hand to stop him and his rampaging brother, William; the leadership and organization of the Vampire Nation was scattered and divided. The leadership and organization of the Vampire Nation is once again restored following the ascension of Selene, David, and Lena as the new Vampire Elders. In the post-production of the film, the pallor of the vampires was achieved via D.I.. As explained by Selene in the first Underworld film, a bite from both a Lycan and a vampire is lethal, but Michael's bloodline allows him to survive and metamorphose into a hybrid of both species. Death Dealers are vampires that are specifically trained and tasked to kill Lycans.  Selene  Selene appears in the films Underworld, Underworld: Evolution, Underworld: Awakening, and Underworld: Blood Wars; as well as in Underworld: Rise of the Lycans for a brief cameo. Her lover is Michael Corvin, and together they now have a daughter, named Eve. Selene is portrayed by Kate Beckinsale, and by Beckinsale's daughter, Lily Mo Sheen, in Underworld: Evolution\\"Lily Mo Sheen\\". IMDb. Amazon.com. in flashback scenes as a child. Selene was created by Kevin Grevioux, Len Wiseman, and Danny McBride. According to Kevin Grevioux, Selene is based loosely on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. After the events of Evolution, Selene is no longer merely a vampire, but a Vampire/Corvinus-Strain Hybrid, now more powerful and also immune to UV radiation. At the end of Underworld: Blood Wars, Selene is not only accepted once again by the vampire Covens, but also named a new vampire Elder alongside David and Lena.  Viktor  Viktor is a vampire Elder. He is portrayed by Bill Nighy. Viktor was a Hungarian general and warlord born sometime in the 4th or early 5th century. As he was nearing the end of his life, Markus Corvinus, the first true Vampire, offered immortality in exchange for Viktor's military expertise and army in fighting against the Werewolves, spawn of Markus' twin brother, William. When Markus metamorphosed Viktor, the general became a vampire Elder. The Death Dealers were created from Viktor's army. Viktor is a ruthless vampire Elder with his armies loyal to him, he overthrew the original vampire Markus and set himself up in Vampire myth as the first Vampire. Viktor was the most powerful vampire ever to have lived mostly because his manipulation, experience, and cunning far surpassed the other Elders. He is killed by Selene who cuts his head in half with his own sword. In Blood Wars, Selene is hunted by the vampires for killing Viktor. Selene's only two allies are Thomas, who had no love for Viktor, and his son David whose mother was secretly Viktor's fellow Elder Amelia. Due to the threat of the new Lycan leader Marius, the Vampire Council agrees to pardon Selene for Viktor's death if she will train their new Death Dealers but Semira, an old favorite of Viktor, frames Selene for murder to get revenge. Following the deaths of Marius and Semira, the Vampires' grudge against Selene for killing Viktor ends and she goes from pariah to one of the three new vampire Elders alongside Amelia's son David and the Nordic Vampire Lena.  Sonja  Sonja is the daughter of the vampire elder Viktor, introduced by flashback, in Underworld played Jázmin Dammak. The character is heavily featured in Underworld: Rise of the Lycans, and is played by Rhona Mitra.\\"Rhona Points Her Sword in New 'Rise of the Lycans' One Sheet\\". Bloody Disgusting.com. December 15, 2008. She fell in love with the lycan slave, Lucian, despite knowing her father would disapprove. Without Viktor's knowledge or blessing, she eventually married Lucian in secret, and became pregnant with his child. For breaking the Covenant, Viktor executed her and her unborn child by exposure to sunlight, and her husband was forced to watch. Viktor viewed the child as an abomination and was acting to protect the vampire line's purity, although Sonja's death haunted him for the rest of his life. His guilt over this led him to spare Selene, who bore an uncanny resemblance to Sonja, from the slaughter of the rest of her family. Sonja wore a pendant, which was given to her by her father. After her death, Lucian took that pendant as a keepsake of his beloved wife. This pendant proved to be vitally important to the events that unfolded in Underworld: Evolution. Her death started the war between Vampires and Lycans that lasted for centuries afterward.  Markus Corvinus  Markus Corvinus is the first vampire in the Underworld series. He is portrayed by Tony Curran. Markus also appears in the novelization of the sequel.Greg Cox. Underworld: Evolution (Simon and Schuster, 2006). 121. Born sometime in the 5th century; Markus was one of three sons of Helena and Alexander Corvinus, the first immortal. Markus was also the twin brother of William Corvinus; and they each inherited the immortality strain in its active form from their father. Together, Markus and William both shared a bond as twins that Alexander never truly saw. Markus was later bitten by a bat, thus making him the progenitor of what would become the Vampire species. His twin, William, was bitten by a wolf and went on to ravage the countryside of Hungary, infecting the populace with his highly infectious lycanthropy virus. In order to combat the growing werewolf threat Markus approached Viktor, a dying warlord, to utilize his military genius and army (who became the Death Dealers) in exchange for immortality. Viktor accepted and became one of the Vampire Elders. After being revived by the blood of the Lycan Singe, Markus awakens as a Hybrid and goes on a rampage to rescue William and metamorphose him into a Hybrid too. He kills his own father, and apparently his distant relative Michael Corvin, but is defeated and killed by an enhanced Selene in a final fight when she stabs him through the head with one of his own wing talons and knocks him into spinning helicopter blades, dismembering him.  Amelia  Amelia is one of the three Vampire Elders of the Vampire Nation in the Underworld series. She appeared briefly in Underworld, appeared in a flashback sequence in Underworld: Evolution and appears in archive footage and as a painting in Underworld: Blood Wars. She is portrayed by Zita Görög and Sveta Driga. Amelia was bitten and metamorphosed into a vampire, most likely by the first vampire, Markus himself, sometime 1500 years prior to the events of the first Underworld instalment, according to the first novelization (\\"Although nearly fifteen centuries old, the Lady Amelia still had all the youthful beauty and haughty carriage of an international supermodel\\"), and, as such, Amelia was the youngest of all three Elders, as well as the only female. She was elevated to the rank of an Elder, both in order to help control the chaos created by Markus's brother William (the first werewolf; William was unable to return to human form after his metamorphosis and his bite caused even the dead to metamorphose into werewolves), and to perform the role as a tie-breaker between her fellow Elders, Markus and Viktor, if there was ever a deadlock in the ruling of the coven; her original background prior to her Vampirism is yet-unrevealed. In 1202 AD. Amelia had to side with Viktor (who also sought to undermine Markus' authority, something he could not do without her help), supported him in locking-up William within a coffin-like prison, in a remote place where Markus could not find him (which turns Markus against her too), as William was just too dangerous to be allowed to roam free. The capture of William would not have happened without Amelia's help. Ultimately, Amelia did not keep control during her last reign, spending the majority of her reign amongst the New World Coven, which only allowed Viktor's regent, Kraven, to conspire with Lucian, and Lucian to work deals with Tanis for weapons to kill Vampires; She herself was killed and \\"bled dry\\" by Lycans led by Raze during an attack on her train. In Blood Wars, Amelia was illustrated as having been something of a 'coven-builder', founding or else supporting the founding of a number of covens. It is also later revealed that Amelia and a high-ranking vampire Thomas (later the leader of the Western Coven following the events of the Purge) had fallen in love, having fought 1st generation Werewolves alongside one-another, and, at some point, they had entered into a secret, private relationship; some point into their centuries-long love, in the late 20th century, Amelia discovered she had become pregnant, and she and Thomas made plans to keep her pregnancy a secret; before her pregnancy can start to show, Amelia announces her intention to visit old friends in the Var Dohr coven in Scandinavia, and appoints Thomas as her sole escort. They both stayed with the Var Dohr coven for the duration of her pregnancy, culminating with the safe delivery of their pureborn son, David. By this point, it would seem, Amelia's prolonged absence from the Vampire Nation at large had aroused at least some suspicion as to why she was absent, and Semira was dispatched to investigate; but by this time, however, David having been born and Amelia having recovered from the birth, Thomas and Amelia had left with their son and gone their separate ways; to keep up the appearances, Thomas put it out that he'd had a low-born vampiress for a consort, who had just died in childbirth, and Amelia returned to the New World coven with no one wiser to know the truth; it would seem that Amelia, despite siding with Viktor against Markus over William's sentence, didn't completely trust him, keeping the existence of her son a secret. During the main events of Blood Wars, Selene's ally David learns that he is Amelia's secret son and thus her heir as the new leader of the Eastern Coven. Using some of Amelia's blood she had left behind in case anything happened to her beforehand, David is able to prove his claim as Amelia's rightful heir. In the 3rd instalment of the Underworld franchise, there was an unspoken allusion that Viktor was plotting get rid of her and replace her with his daughter, Sonja: Viktor kept saying \\"When you are an Elder\\" to Sonja rather than If, but never alludes to a future when he would be gone, and touting the bonds of family and blood being stronger than anything else; as he sought to further increase and re-inforce his own powerbase within the Vampire Nation, and believing Markus' lie about how his death would mean the immediate deaths of all Vampires, and that, as his own flesh and blood (and having planned out her whole life for her), Sonja would be a more loyal ally than Amelia, if Amelia should ever side with Markus against him (as Amelia had with Viktor against Markus over William's sentence), Viktor, paranoid and ambitious as ever, likely sought to replace Amelia with his daughter, Sonja, only to sentence Sonja to death for her affair and pregnancy with Lucian, abandoning this plan. Whenever Amelia ever suspected anything about this is unknown, but would give credence to Amelia's later efforts to keeping the existence and birth of her son from Viktor and his followers (and, indeed, the Vampire Nation at large). In the non-canon novel, Blood Enemy, Amelia, though making no physical appearance in the story, is described as having a habit similar to real-life historical Sanguinarian figure, Elizabeth Báthory the \\"Blood Countess\\", of often indulging in baths of blood, believing it to enhance her beauty (\\"The aroma of so much fresh blood was intoxicating. Sonja tried to imagine what it would be like to bathe in such a tub; her skin tingled beneath her gown. It was said that Amelia herself sometimes indulged in such luxurious ablutions in order to enhance her beauty\\", Blood Enemy novelization, chapter 8).  Erika  Erika is portrayed by Sophia Myles. She is a character in the Underworld film series as well as in the novelization of the film.Greg Cox, Kevin Grevioux, Danny McBride, and Len Wiseman. Underworld: Book 1 (Simon and Schuster, 2003). 61. She is a vampire seductress, a social-climbing courtier in Viktor's mansion, obsessed with rising through the ranks of the vampire aristocracy. She is a high ranking maid who most recently began seeking the attentions of Kraven.  Kraven  Kraven is portrayed by actor Shane Brolly. The name \\"Kraven\\" is a derivation of the English word \\"craven\\", meaning \\"coward\\", a reference to Kraven's spineless nature. Kraven has a vainglorious personality and a highly inflated- but-extremely-fragile narcissistic ego: Kraven is a long-time suitor of Selene, a Death Dealer. Kraven fancies himself in a relationship with Selene, even though she spurns him at every turn. Yet, Kraven was so obsessed with Selene that the more she refused him, the more he wanted her. When it becomes evident that Selene has fallen in love with Michael Corvin, Kraven becomes insanely jealous and highly irrational, demanding Michael Corvin's head, and even shoots Michael multiple times with silver nitrate bullets, nearly killing him. However, Selene revived Michael in the nick of time by biting him. In his quest for power, Kraven had entered a secret alliance with Lucian in order to overthrow the Elders, helping to set up an ambush for the Lady Amelia. After Lady Amelia's death, and with Lucian and Viktor dead, Kraven goes after a slumbering Markus and tries to murder him in his sleep. But, Markus surprisingly wakes as a Hybrid and massacres Kraven's men. Markus then bites Kraven and obtains his Blood memories. Although, Markus stops before Kraven dies of blood loss, he turns down Kraven's offer to 'assist' him, seeing Kraven as untrustworthy. Immediately after that, Markus kills Kraven by beheading him.  Andreas Tanis Andreas Tanis is a character in the 2006 movie Underworld: Evolution and in the 2009 movie Underworld: Rise of the Lycans. He is portrayed by Steven Mackintosh. Tanis is a vampire of considerable age (estimated at over 1000 years old at the time of his death), he was at one point the official scribe and Historian of the Old World Coven. An ambitious man, Tanis knew things about other vampires and kept the things he knew secret until it was of use for him. Coveting a rise in status to a member of the Vampire Council, Tanis enters a covert alliance with Sonja and Lucian, aiding them in exchange for his silence and Sonja's seat on the Council; his part in Sonja's and Lucian's plan remained a secret after Sonja's execution, and later after Lucian's faked death. However, over 300 years prior to the events that occurred in the first and second installments, the Vampire Elder, Lord Viktor, in his bid to rewrite history, turns on Tanis and orders his banishment, citing that Tanis had been recording \\"malicious lies\\". The order of banishment was carried out by Selene, who escorted him to an abandoned monastery on Viktor's orders. Over three hundred years later, Selene would learn the truth about Viktor and realize that what Tanis had recorded years earlier was, in fact, true. Tanis is later killed by Markus after being drained of blood.  Soren  Soren, having a surprising lack of personal ambition for a vampire, was Kraven's janissary, and, being two of a kind, he was the rival/vampire counterpart of Raze before their deaths. He is played by Scott McElroy. Soren appears predominantly in the first film installment of Underworld, but is also referenced in the novelization of the sequelGreg Cox. Underworld: Evolution (Simon and Schuster, 2006). 54. and also appearing in the comic book prequel,Jonah Weiland. \\"The war wages on: Kris Oprisko talks 'Underworld' prequel comic\\". Comic Book Resources. December 19, 2003. Not much is revealed about Soren's past; rumors surrounding him say that he is almost as old as Viktor himself (and was probably bitten by the Vampire Elder), Soren was originally Viktor's bodyguard, a position he may have held since before either were vampires. Later, he served as the head torturer in Viktor's employ. He proved to be very skilled in taming Lycan slaves with silver-edged whips, and even used them on Lucian at Viktor's request prior to Sonja's execution. In the non-canon novel, Underworld: Blood Enemy, Soren lost his position in Viktor's good graces after he left Viktor's daughter Sonja, whom he was charged to protect, alone during an ambush by mortals who were hateful of vampires. He also remained ignorant of the fact that Sonja was in love with the Lycan Lucian until he was informed by a Lycan woman who had been obsessed with Lucian and resented him falling for Sonja. Soren informed Viktor, who then executed his daughter. Viktor blamed Soren for not protecting her. Soren is one of the vampires involved in Viktor's assault on the Lycan base in the first film, and ultimately faces Raze in single combat. Soren initially holds the Lycan off, but after Raze shapeshifts into full Lycan form, he tackles Soren and apparently kills him, since Soren is not seen afterward and Raze is.  David  David is a character from the 2012 movie Underworld: Awakening and the 2016 movie Underworld: Blood Wars. He is portrayed by Theo James. He is the son of Thomas, leader of the Western Coven and Amelia, the Vampire Elder. Although never trained as a Death Dealer, and in contrast with his father, Thomas, David is not a coward and would fight when situations demanded it. Fascinated by Selene's past as a Death Dealer, he brought her back to the vampire coven with her hybrid daughter, Eve, hoping she would teach some of the members so that they could become what she used to be, as there are not any left within the coven. David died after a raid by Lycans led by Quint Lane, but was revived by Selene using her Vampire-Corvinus Strain Hybrid blood, metamorphosing him into a Vampire-Corvinus Strain Hybrid too. During the final assault on Antigen, David, now with similar abilities to Selene including sunlight immunity, arrives to help unexpectedly. Armed with a shotgun and two blades, David distracts Jacob Lane long enough for Eve to break free and fight back. As more Lycan guards arrive, David turns his focus to them and single-handedly kills around a dozen Lycans. After the battle, David joins Selene and Eve in searching for Michael Corvin who has escaped. In Underworld: Blood Wars, David attempts to get Selene to return to aid the Vampire Covens against the new Lycan leader, Marius. His resurrection has become something of a legend amongst the Vampires as he is the first Vampire to have ever been brought back from the dead. His fighting skills also have been honed and he is now a capable combatant. After Semira betrays them, David and his father rescued Selene, but Thomas is killed after telling David to take Selene to the Nordic Coven. David is able to use his sunlight immunity to escape Semira's clutches and learns from the Nordic Coven that he is the son of the Vampire Elder Amelia and thus her rightful heir. During the Lycan attack on the Nordic Coven, David helps defend it and is devastated by Selene's apparent death. David then returns to the Eastern Coven and interrupts a coup attempt by Semira by presenting himself as the heir of Amelia with some of her blood to prove it. The Death Dealers and Vampire Council side with David and he leads a futile defense against a massive Lycan attack before a revived and enhanced Selene arrives with the Nordic Coven to help. David and Semira, who has metamorphosed into a Vampire-Corvinus Strain Hybrid herself by drinking Selene's blood, fight ending with David raising the shutters keeping out the sunlight. David is able to use Semira's distraction over her new sunlight immunity to kill her and after discovering that Selene has killed Marius, cuts off Marius' head and uses it to get the Lycans to retreat. Following the battle, David is made one of the new Vampire Elders alongside Selene and Nordic Vampire Lena.  Thomas  Thomas is one of the surviving Vampire Elders in Underworld: Awakening and the father of David. According to David, his father was once a vampire who had \\"defended [his coven] with fire and steel, rather than hollow words\\", and that Selene reminds Thomas of the way he once was. He does not trust Selene, and openly discriminates against her daughter, Eve, who is a Hybrid. In contrast with his son, Thomas is a coward and ordered the coven to flee rather than fight, leaving David as de facto leader because of his demonstration of courage and intelligence, despite Thomas' status now as a coven Elder. His arrogance made him fail to realize the necessity of Selene's presence or what she has metamorphosed into, until she used her blood to resurrect David after he died from the critical injuries he received from Lycans. In Underworld: Blood Wars, Thomas is approached by Semira to petition the Vampire Council to grant Selene clemency in exchange for her help in training their Death Dealers. Thomas is successful, but Semira later frames Selene for murder and kidnaps her. Thomas helps David rescue Selene and orders his son to take Selene to the Nordic Coven. Thomas then battles both Semira and Varga before Semira kills him with a stab to the back of his head while he's distracted. Upon arrival at the Nordic Coven, David learns that Thomas once had a relationship with the Vampire Elder Amelia and he is their son as proven by blood memories left behind for him by Amelia. He is portrayed by Charles Dance.  Lena  Lena is a vampire warrior from the Nordic Coven. As a daughter of the coven's leader, Vidar, she is depicted as a calm and wise vampiress, but willing to use violence to protect her coven. She provides Selene with the cocooning process, thus not only reviving her, but also boosting her hybrid abilities to new heights. At the end of Blood Wars, Lena becomes one of three new Vampire Elders alongside Selene and David. She is portrayed by Clementine Nicholson.  Semira  Semira is one of the leaders of the Eastern Coven. She is a fiercely ambitious vampiress in Underworld: Blood Wars. She is also skilled at sword fighting. In Blood Wars, Semira gets the Vampire Council to grant Selene clemency in exchange for her training their new Death Dealers, but it is in fact a trap so that Semira can get Selene's blood and kill her in revenge for the death of the Vampire Elder Viktor who Semira had once been close to. Selene is rescued by David and Thomas, the latter of whom Semira murders, but Semira is able to get some of Selene's blood and learns of Selene and David's ability to walk in sunlight. Semira later sends Alexia to the Nordic Coven, knowing she is really the lover of the new Lycan leader Marius and kills her upon her return. Using Selene's blood, Semira is able to metamorphose herself into a Vampire-Corvinus Strain Hybrid like Selene and David and attempts to overthrow the Vampire Council. However, David returns and reveals himself to be the son of the Vampire Elder Amelia and thus her rightful heir and true leader of the Eastern Coven. At this revelation, Semira's own Death Dealers turn on her, including her lover Varga and she is arrested. Semira manages to escape when the Lycans attack the Coven and battles David, being an even match for him with her new powers and proficient fighting skills. Finally, David opens the shutters to Semira's office and lets in the sunlight, causing Semira to get distracted by enjoying her new sunlight immunity as David intended. With Semira distracted, David stabs her through the back of the head and out of her mouth with a sword, killing her in the same manner she murdered his father, Thomas. She is portrayed by Lara Pulver. Lycans Werewolves in the Underworld films, like their vampire counterparts, are biologically immortal transgenics. Lycans display a number of greatly enhanced physical attributes in either form (superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, healing, etc.) although the werewolf form is physically superior to both their human form and even to most vampires. Lycans are highly allergic to silver, to the point of it being toxic and lethal to them, and it is even able to keep them weakened and unable to metamorphose into their werewolf form. They can also be killed or permanently damaged by extreme physical trauma as normal humans are, such as mutilation, a broken neck, or dismemberment, especially if their head or heart is destroyed or removed. However, while first-generation werewolves sired by William Corvinus are permanently metamorphosed and feral, second-generation werewolves, the Lycans, and those they convert, can become able to metamorphose between their human or werewolf forms at will and retain their personalities while metamorphosed. Their control over their metamorphoses increases overtime, to the point where they can partially metamorphose to physically enhance themselves further, while age also gives them a limited tolerance to silver. As explained by Selene in the first Underworld film though, a bite from both a Lycan and a vampire is lethal, but Michael's heritage allows him to survive and metamorphose into a hybrid of both species.  Lucian  Lucian was the very first of the second-generation Lycans. He was the leader of the Lycan horde in the movie Underworld and appears in its prequel Underworld: Rise of the Lycans. He is portrayed by actor Michael Sheen. Lucian was born the son of a captured female werewolf, who was killed when Lucian was a newborn. He was branded with Viktor's mark signifying that he was put into slavery under one of Viktor's early reigns as a blacksmith. Being born of two werewolves, he was a pure-blood Lycan. Lucian was once a Lycan servant to Viktor's clan. His relationship with Sonja began when they grew up and it was eventually revealed that Sonja was pregnant with his child, making their child a Lycan-Vampire hybrid; but Sonja was executed, preventing the birth of the child. He starts a war with Viktor as a result and fakes his own death with the help of Kraven, planning to metamorphose into a Hybrid in order to kill Viktor. His plan fails, but he holds Kraven off long enough for Selene to metamorphose Michael Corvin into a Hybrid. Selene also later kills Viktor to fulfill her own revenge against him. Despite his plans to metamorphose into a hybrid and to kill Viktor himself have failed, his will is seen through regardless with Michael's metamorphosing and Viktor's death.  Raze  Razahir \\"Raze\\" Khemse is a Lycan who is the right-hand man of the Lycan leader Lucian. He was born in Sudan in East Africa during the 14th century. Raze was the son of a powerful Sultan but his family's lands were taken during a period of wars that spread into Africa. He was forced into slavery and taken to Hungary to be given as payment to Viktor the Vampire Elder. He joins Lucian's civil war and kills Soren during the vampires' attack on Lucian's base, but after believing Lucian to be dead, launches a suicide attack on Viktor who snaps his neck and stabs him with a sword.Greg Cox, Danny McBride, Kevin Grevioux, Len Wiseman. Underworld: Book 1 (Simon and Schuster, 2003). 80. He is played by Kevin Grevioux.\\"Wilson Morales\\". BlackVoices.com.  Singe  Singe is a scientist employed by Lucian to find a way to mix the vampire and werewolf bloodlines to create hybrids. He kidnaps members of the human Corvinus bloodline, and mixes their blood with both vampire and Lycan blood to see if they are compatible. He finally finds compatibility in Michael Corvin when Michael is captured and brought to him to be tested. He's killed by Viktor towards the end of Underworld while his blood seeps into Markus' tomb and awakens him. Unlike the rest of Lucian's clan, he is unable to metamorphose into his werewolf form but still carries the werewolf traits. He is played by Erwin Leder  William Corvinus  William Corvinus is the first and only Lycan Elder. Portrayed only in his metamorphosed state, he is played by Brian Steele, but prior to his being a werewolf, he would have been identical in looks to his twin brother, Markus. Born sometime in the 5th century, William was one of three sons of Helena and Alexander Corvinus, the first immortal. He, along with Markus, inherited the immortality strain in its active form from their father. Markus and William both shared a bond as twins that Alexander never truly saw. William was later bitten by a wolf, thus making him the progenitor of what would become the Lycan species (his twin, Markus, was bitten by a bat). Unlike most later Lycans, his fur was white. William was unable to metamorphose back into his human form and had little more than ferocious savagery, nor is he ever shown in his human form in any of the films. His lycanthropy virus was much more potent than Markus' vampire virus, even allowing dead victims to metamorphose. William went on to ravage the countryside of Hungary, infecting the populace with his highly infectious lycanthropy virus. In order to combat the growing lycan threat Markus approached Viktor, a dying warlord, to utilize his military genius and army (who became the Death Dealers) in exchange for immortality. Later, William was successfully captured and contained by the combined forces of Markus, Amelia and Viktor and used by Viktor to keep Markus in line. After Viktor is killed, Markus releases William, hoping to metamorphose him into a Hybrid and restore his morality. Despite his bestial nature, William is shown to recognize his brother. In the fight that follows, Michael Corvin rips William's head in half with brute strength, killing him.  Dr. Jacob Lane  Dr. Jacob Lane is a ruthless and amoral lycan, he betrayed his own pack and reveals the existences of both vampire and lycan races so he can covertly experiment on both in order to create a new and powerful Lycan race by heading the research company Antigen, in hope of domination over human, vampire, and werewolf races. Using the blood of the Hybrid Eve, he enhances his own Lycan form, but not to the same degree as his son, Quint. During Selene's attack on Antigen, he battles Detective Sebastian and Eve and is killed when Eve rips out his throat. He is portrayed by Stephen Rea.  Quint Lane  Quint Lane is the son of Dr. Jacob Lane, who is as corrupt as his father. After the public discovered him as a Lycan, his father helped to fake his death in order to continue his experiments upon him. He metamorphoses into a larger, fearsome and powerful Lycan, has the ability to rapidly heal, is seemingly immune to silver, and is sometimes called a \\"super-lycan\\". He is killed by Selene who stuffs a silver nitrate grenade into an open wound on his abdomen, which quickly heals, preventing him from removing the grenade before it explodes; revealing his so- called \\"immunity to silver\\" to be actually only skin-deep, and his vital organs to be very much still vulnerable. He is portrayed by Kris Holden-Ried.  Marius  Marius is a lycan leader who rose to power following the destruction of Antigen. Marius, who is described as being unlike any Lycan leader ever before, manages to gather an army of Lycans loyal to him that slaughters several Vampire Covens using superior tactics. Marius also captured and murdered Michael Corvin, using vials of Michael's blood to increase his own power and metamorphose himself into a Hybrid. The threat posed by Marius is so great that the vampire Council agrees to pardon Selene if she will train their Death Dealers to fight him, but she is betrayed by Semira and Varga and sent on the run. After being informed of Selene's location by his Vampire lover Alexia, Marius leads an attack on the Nordic Coven, his new Hybrid powers proving superior to Selene's. Marius attempts to get the location of Eve from Selene to use her blood to solidify his power and is horrified to learn that Selene truly does not know where she is. After Selene's apparent suicide, Marius calls off the Lycan attack on the Nordic Coven and sends Alexia to lower the defenses of the Eastern Coven so he can attack. Marius leads a devastating attack on the Eastern Coven and comes close to winning before Selene, her powers enhanced by the Nordic Coven, arrives to help accompanied by the Nordic Coven. Marius battles Selene who learns from his blood memories of Marius murdering Michael. Downing the last of Michael's blood, Marius metamorphoses and battles Selene inside of a cage. Using her newly enhanced speed, Selene is able to get behind Marius before he can react and rip out Marius' spine, killing him. David then cuts off Marius' head and uses it to convince the other Lycans that their leader is dead and get them to retreat. He is portrayed by Tobias Menzies. House of Corvinus= Alexander Corvinus  Alexander Corvinus (Hungarian: Corvin Sándor) is the first true Immortal in the Underworld movies and is the father of Markus Corvinus and William Corvinus, as well as an ancestor of Michael Corvin, who is a descendant of Corvinus's third and mortal son. He is portrayed by Derek Jacobi.\\"'Underworld: Evolution' – Better than the first\\" . The Jamaica Observer. February 10, 2006.Greg Cox. Underworld: Evolution (Simon and Schuster, 2006). 182. Alexander was a Hungarian warlord who lived in the early 5th century. He ascended to power just in time to watch his village ravaged by an unknown plague. Alexander was the only survivor of the plague. His body was able to adapt the virus, and, likewise be adapted by it, and through some unknown means consequently made him immortal. The plague that wiped-out his home town and mutated with Alexander may have been a part of the first wave of the Bubonic plague to hit Europe (otherwise known as the \\"Plague of Justinian\\"), although the timing for the Justinian Plague is off by a nigh- century (although archaeo-pathological evidence reveals that Bubonic plague had been around as early as the Bronze Age), and that Bubonic plague is bacterial rather than viral. Years later, with his wife Helena, he fathered three children, two of whom inherited the immortal strain in its active form: twin brothers Markus and William. Markus was bitten by a bat and metamorphosed into the first vampire. William was bitten by a wolf and metamorphosed into the first werewolf. William became a savage beast that was unable to ever assume human form again, something Alexander attributed to his uncontrollable rage. Only Alexander's third son (who inherited the immortal strain in its inactive form) remained a human. Markus and his vampire army (led by Viktor) captured his brother William and locked him in a secret prison for over 800 years, the location of which was kept from Markus. When Viktor ordered his vampire daughter executed for having been impregnated by a Lycan, he inadvertently touched off a centuries-long war between lycans and vampires. Alexander chose to keep the war contained from ever spilling into the mortal realm. He hired humans to clean up after the battles and to help conceal their existence from the normal human population. Alexander states in Underworld: Evolution that he believes he and his sons were oddities of nature, and that the world is not theirs to conquer but belongs to the humans. Despite not displaying any powers of his own, he is referred to by Selene as the strongest of the immortals and the only one capable of killing his sons, indicating he does possess some abilities. At the time of Underworld: Evolution, Alexander was operating under the alias of Lorenz Macaro, and ran his operation from the ship \\"Sancta Helena\\". He meets with Selene and Michael, who ask for his help to destroy Markus and William. He reveals that no matter what they have become, he cannot help Selene and Michael against them, for they are his own sons. Alexander has come into possession of Viktor's body (and Viktor's half of the prison key that holds William Corvinus). Alexander is visited by Markus, who impales him with his wing talon, takes Viktor's half of the key and leaves him for dead. As Alexander lays dying, he calls Selene to him to drink some of his pure immortal blood. The blood, he tells her, will make her \\"the future\\" and is her only hope of being strong enough to destroy the Corvinus brothers. After Selene and Michael leave, Alexander detonates a case of explosives on his ship, obliterating it in the harbor, along with killing himself. His blood enhances Selene's powers, making her equal to the Hybrid Markus in strength and giving her an immunity to sunlight, ultimately allowing her to defeat him. She tells Detective Sebastian in Underworld: Awakening about getting her sunlight immunity from Alexander, referring to it as a gift from him. Detective Sebastian displays knowledge of who Alexander is when Selene brings him up. Michael Corvin Michael Corvin (in Hungarian: Corvin Mihály), bitten first by Lucian and later by Selene, metamorphosed into a Lycan/Vampire Hybrid. Being a hybrid, Michael can regenerate cells and muscle tissues as well as internal organs even when he is dead, as long as his body stays intact. (Michael came back to life when Markus killed him by impaling him through the chest). Counting the unborn child of Lucian and Sonja, Michael is the second Lycan/Vampire Hybrid. In Underworld: Awakening, he is labeled \\"Subject 0\\". He is portrayed by Scott Speedman and appears in a cameo in Underworld: Blood Wars by Trent Garrett.  Eve  Eve is the 12/14-year-old hybrid daughter of Selene and Michael Corvin, through whom she is a descendant of Alexander Corvinus. In Underworld: Awakening, she tells Selene that her name is Subject 2. She was born without her parents' knowledge during their 12/15-year captivity in Antigen; while a watch guard on patrol at the pier that Selene and Michael tried to leave the city in answers that the pier has been closed for at least about 12 years, interviews from the set, and by one of the film's Producers in bonus material on the DVD and Blu-ray, confirmed that upwards of 15 years had passed from the time that Selene and Michael were captured, to the time that Eve breaks Selene out of cryo- suspension.Underworld: Awakening Set Visit interview; Producer Richard Wright Full Interview The scientists in the facility told her that her mother was dead and never heard anything about her father. After her escape, Selene discovers Eve and learns that she is her daughter, realizing that she had been pregnant at the time of her capture, and given birth to Eve all during her unconscious state. Being pursued by both humans and Lycans because of her unique origin, and despite Selene's attempts to shield her from the dangers around them, she is recaptured by Antigen, but is rescued by Selene and Detective Sebastian during an attack on the facility. Eve joins the fight herself and kills Doctor Lane. In Underworld: Blood Wars, Eve has gone away to prevent any vampires and lycans from getting her blood. As a result, Selene does not know where Eve is. However, she appears in the very last shot of the film, revealing that she has been following her mother; as her mother is now one of the Vampire Nation's new Elders, this makes Eve an heir to her mother and to the Vampire Nation. Eve is portrayed by India Eisley. Humans= Detective Sebastian  A police detective in Underworld: Awakening who is shown to be sympathetic to immortals. He is first seen investigating a Lycan attack where he convinces his rookie partner to not jump to conclusions. While at the crime scene, he gets a brief glimpse of Selene and grows suspicious of Antigen, especially after he finds proof that they lied about their test subject, Selene, being dead. After an attack on a vampire coven that ends with her daughter being kidnapped, Selene confronts Detective Sebastian who admits he suspected the Lycans are not extinct. He then shows her reports a friend of his sent him shortly before dying of over 200 suspected Lycans being tested and all coming back negative, leading Detective Sebastian to think someone might be protecting them and letting them rebuild. Selene realizes that Antigen is run by Lycans and Detective Sebastian offers her his help in rescuing her daughter, explaining that his wife had metamorphosed into a vampiress and committed suicide to protect him. During the assault on Antigen, Detective Sebastian mans the security station to guide Selene through the building and races to the parking garage when he realizes Selene will not get there in time to stop Doctor Lane from escaping. In the fight that follows, Detective Sebastian kills a few Lycans but is unable to harm Lane who is now a Hybrid. He watches as Eve fights and kills Lane and David arrives to dispatch the other Lycans. As the police arrive, Detective Sebastian, who has an injured leg, tells the other three to go and he will misdirect the police to buy them time to get away.

Go Green Wilmette assists local schools with environmental initiatives, such as school gardens, recycling, and composting. Go Green Wilmette also co-hosts a Greener Choices series of speakers, books, and films with the Wilmette Public Library on a variety of topics, including climate, beekeeping, sustainable agriculture, and organic vegetable gardening. The group organizes periodic educational field trips for community members. Each fall, Go Green Wilmette organizes a climate action event, urging the community to participate in what has become a global movement promoted by 350.org. Since March 2007, Go Green Wilmette has partnered with the Village of Wilmette to host the Going Green Matters environmental fair, a sustainable living event that recycled two semi-tractor-trailers full of consumer electronics. Going Green Matters topics have included solar energy, water conservation, energy efficiency and conservation, transportation, green vehicles, sustainable agriculture, composting, home and garden, recycling, waste reduction, and reuse.

Its mission is to acquaint Department of State employees at home and abroad with developments affecting operations and personnel, and to facilitate communication between management and employees. The interactive magazine was published 11 times per year, with a combined July and August issue, and features news of interest to employees, retirees and the general public. In October 2015 the print edition was cancelled and it became online-only publication.  History  The first Foreign Service News Letter was dated March 20, 1947, and was published monthly by the office of the Director General of the United States Foreign Service to \\"acquaint members of the Foreign Service with plans and developments of interest to or which may affect operations or personnel in the field.\\" The Foreign Service News Letter's final issue, Number 170, was dated April 15, 1961.

Francis Edmund Cecil Byng, 5th Earl of Strafford (15 January 1835 - 18 January 1918) was an English Anglican minister and member of the peerage.  Background  Byng was born 15 January 1835, third son of George Byng, 2nd Earl of Strafford. He was educated at Eton (where he took a Prince Albert Prize for Modern Languages) and Christ Church, Oxford, where he studied law and modern history.  Religious career  After taking holy orders, Byng became the rector of Little Casterton, Rutland from 1859–62; served as vicar of Holy Trinity in Twickenham and chaplain at Hampton Court from 1862-67. He was appointed an honorary chaplain to Queen Victoria in 1867 and Chaplain-in- Ordinary in 1872; then served as Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons from 1874-89. In 1867 Byng was appointed vicar of the high church St. Peter's Church, Cranley Gardens, by Charles James Freake (who had the living of the church).

From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person – among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.\\" However, the Church does recognize as morally legitimate certain acts which indirectly result in the death of the fetus, as when the direct purpose is removal of a cancerous womb. Canon 1398 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law imposes automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication on Latin Catholics who procure a completed abortion,Code of Canon Law, canon 1398 if they fulfill the conditions for being subject to such a sanction.Code of Canon Law, canons 1321-1329 Eastern Catholics are not subject to automatic excommunication, but by Canon 1450 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches they are to be excommunicated by decree if found guilty of the same action,Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 1450 §2 and they may be absolved of the sin only by the eparchial bishop.Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 728 §2 In addition to teaching that abortion is immoral, the Catholic Church also makes public statements and takes actions in opposition to its legality. Many, and in some Western countries most, Catholics hold views on abortion that differ from the official position of the Catholic Church, which opposes abortion and its legality. Views range from anti-abortion positions that allow some exceptions to positions that accept the general legality and morality of abortion. There is a correlation between Mass attendance and agreement with the official teaching of the Church on the issue; that is, frequent Mass-goers are far more likely to be anti-abortion, while those who attend less often (or rarely or never) are more likely to be in favor of abortion rights under certain circumstances. Early writings According to Respect For Unborn Human Life: The Church's Constant Teaching, a document released by United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Committee on Pro-Life Activities, the Catholic Church has condemned procured abortion as immoral since the 1st century.Respect for Unborn Human Life: the Church's Constant Teaching However, this claim has been disputed by several historians, including John Connery,John Connery, Abortion: The Development of the Roman Catholic Perspective, Loyola University Press, 1997.

Riddle, Eve's Herbs: A History of Contraception and Abortion in the West, Harvard University Press, 1997. Early Christian writings rejecting abortion are the Didache, the Epistle of Barnabas, the Apocalypse of Peter, and the works of early writers such as Tertullian, Athenagoras of Athens,Frank K. Flinn, J. Gordon Melton, Encyclopedia of Catholicism (Facts on File Encyclopedia of World Religions 2007 ), p. 4 Clement of Alexandria and Basil of Caesarea.Kristin, Luker, Abortion and the Politics of Motherhood (University of California Press 1985 ), p. 12 The earliest Church legislation did not make a distinction between \\"formed\\" and \\"unformed\\" fetuses, as was done in the Greek Septuagint version of ; this position can be found in the writing of early Church Fathers such as Basil of Caesarea and early Church council canons (Elvira, Ancyra).M. Therese Lysaught, Joseph Kotva, Stephen E. Lammers, Allen Verhey, On Moral Medicine: Theological Perspectives on Medical Ethics (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing 2012 ), p. 676Michèle Goyens, Pieter de Leemans, An Smets, Science Translated: Latin and Vernacular Translations of Scientific Treatises in Medieval Europe (Leuven University Press 2008 ), p. 384, 399 In the 4th and 5th centuries, some writers such as Gregory of Nyssa and Maximus the Confessor held that human life already began at conception, others such as Lactantius – following Aristotle's view – spoke rather of the soul that was \\"infused\\" in the body after forty days or more, and those such as Jerome and Augustine of Hippo left the mystery of the timing of the infusion to God. Augustine of Hippo \\"vigorously condemned the practice of induced abortion\\" as a crime, in any stage of pregnancy, although he accepted the distinction between \\"formed\\" and \\"unformed\\" fetuses mentioned in the Septuagint translation of , and did not classify as murder the abortion of an \\"unformed\\" fetus since he thought that it could not be said with certainty whether the fetus had already received a soul. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops considers Augustine's reflections on abortion to be of little value in the present day because of the limitations of the science of embryology at that time. Later writers such as John Chrysostom and Caesarius of Arles, as well as later Church councils (e.g. Lerida and Braga II), also condemned abortion as \\"gravely wrong\\", without making a distinction between \\"formed\\" and \\"unformed\\" fetuses nor defining precisely in what stage of pregnancy human life began. Changing beliefs about the moment the embryo gains a human soul have led to changes in canon law in the classification of the sin of abortion.Ana S. Iltis, Mark J. Cherry, At the Roots of Christian Bioethics (M & M Scrivener Press 2010 ), p. 166 In particular, several historians have written that prior to the 19th century did not regard as an abortion what we call \\"early abortion\\"—abortion before \\"quickening\\" or \\"ensoulment.\\"Joan Cadden, \\"Western medicine and natural philosophy,\\" in Vern L. Bullough and James A. Brundage, eds., Handbook of Medieval Sexuality, Garland, 1996, p. 51-80.Cyril C. Means, Jr., \\"A historian's view,\\" in Robert E.

Brundage, eds., Handbook of Medieval Sexuality, Garland, 1996, p. 261-277. Some historians argue that certain Catholics saw nothing wrong with compiling lists of known abortifacient herbs and discovering new ones. In the 13th century physician and cleric Peter of Spain wrote a book called Thesaurus Pauperum (literally Treasure of the Poor) containing a long list of early- stage abortifacients, including rue, pennyroyal, and other mints. It is believed by some that Peter of Spain became Pope John XXI in 1276. Similarly, the medicinal writings of Hildegard of Bingen included abortifacients such as tansy. Not only did they not view early abortions as being abortions, but it is argued that some Catholics saw nothing wrong with compiling lists of known abortifacient herbs and discovering new ones. In the 13th century physician and cleric Peter of Spain wrote a book called Thesaurus Pauperum (literally Treasure of the Poor) containing a long list of early-stage abortifacients, including rue, pennyroyal, and other mints. It is believed by some that Peter of Spain became Pope John XXI in 1276. Some prominent theologians, such as John Chrysostom and Thomas Sanchez, believed that post-quickening abortion was less sinful than deliberate contraception.Peter Biller, The Measure of Multitude: Population in Medieval Thought, Oxford University Press, 2000. John Chrysostom believed that late-stage abortion was not as bad as deliberately killing an already-born person, whereas contraception was definitely worse than murder, according to him. As Koblitz writes,  Belief in delayed animation  Following Aristotle's view, it was commonly held by some \\"leading Catholic thinkers\\" in early Church history that a human being did not come into existence as such immediately on conception, but only some weeks later. Abortion was viewed as a sin, but not as murder, until the embryo was animated by a human soul.David L. Hull, Michael Ruse (editors), The Cambridge Companion to the Philosophy of Biology (Cambridge University Press 2007 ), p. 328 In On Virginal Conception and Original Sin 7, Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109) said that \\"no human intellect accepts the view that an infant has the rational soul from the moment of conception.\\" A few decades after Anselm's death, a Catholic collection of canon law, in the Decretum Gratiani, stated that \\"he is not a murderer who brings about abortion before the soul is in the body.\\" Even when Church law, in line with the theory of delayed ensoulment, assigned different penalties to earlier and later abortions, abortion at any stage was considered a grave evil by some commentators. Thus Thomas Aquinas, who accepted the Aristotelian theory that a human soul was infused only after 40 days for a male fetus, 90 days for a female, saw abortion of an unsouled fetus as always unethical,David Albert Jones, Soul of the Embryo (Continuum International 2004 ), p. 221 a serious crime,S. C Selner-Wright, On Creation: Quaestiones Disputatae de Potentia Dei, Q. 3 (CUA Press 2010 ), p. xiv a grave sin, a misdeed and contrary to nature. He wrote: \\"This sin, although grave and to be reckoned among misdeeds and against nature...is something less than homicide... nor is such to be judged irregularThe technical juridical term \\"irregular\\" is explained below. unless one procures the abortion of an already formed fetus.\\"William Petersen, From Persons to People (Transaction Publishers 2002 ), p. 114William B. Smith, Donals Haggerty, Modern Moral Problems (Ignatius Press 2012 ), p. 19  Juridical consequences  Most early penitentials imposed equal penances for abortion whether early-term or late- term, but others distinguished between the two. Later penitentials normally distinguished, imposing heavier penances for late-term abortions.Michèle Goyens, Pieter de Leemans, An Smets (editors), Science Translated: Latin and Vernacular Translations of Scientific Treatises in Medieval Europe (Leuven University Press 2008 ), pp. 390-396 By comparison, anal and oral intercourse were treated much more harshly, as was intentional homicide. Although the Decretum Gratiani, which remained the basis of Catholic canon law until replaced by the 1917 Code of Canon Law, distinguished between early-term and late-term abortions, that canonical distinction was abolished for a period of three years by the bull of Pope Sixtus V, Effraenatam, of 28 October 1588. This decreed various penalties against perpetrators of all forms of abortion without distinction. Calling abortion murder, it decreed that those who procured the abortion of a fetus, \\"whether animated or unanimated, formed or unformed\\" should suffer the same punishments as \\"true murderers and assassins who have actually and really committed murder.\\" As well as decreeing those punishments for subjects of the Papal States, whose civil ruler he was, Pope Sixtus also inflicted on perpetrators the spiritual punishment of automatic excommunication (section 7). Sixtus's successor, Pope Gregory XIV, recognizing that the law was not producing the hoped-for effects, withdrew it in 1591 by publishing new regulations by its apostolic constitution Sedes Apostolica (published on 31 May 1591), limiting the punishments to abortion of a \\"formed\\" fetus:Nicholas Terpstra, Lost Girls: Sex and Death in Renaissance Florence (Johns Hopkins University Press 2010 ), p. 91 \\"When abortion was neither 'an issue of homicide or of an animate fetus,' Gregory thought it 'more useful' to return to the less-harsh penalties [for early abortion] of the holy canons and profane laws: those who abort an inanimatus [soulless] will not be guilty of true homicide because they have not killed a human being in actuality; clerics involved in abortions will have committed mortal sin but will not incur irregularity.\\" With his 1869 bull Apostolicae Sedis moderationi, Pope Pius IX rescinded Gregory XIV's not-yet-animated fetus exception with regard to the spiritual penalty of excommunication, declaring that those who procured an effective abortion incurred excommunication reserved to bishops or ordinaries.\\"Excommunicationi latae sententiae Episcopis sive Ordinariis reservatae subiacere declaramus: ... 2. Procurantes abortum, effectu sequuto\\" ( , p. 317) From then on this penalty was incurred automatically through abortion at any stage of pregnancy. An excerpt can be found here. In another respect Catholic canon law continued even after 1869 to maintain a distinction between abortion of a formed and of an unformed fetus. As indicated above in a quotation from Thomas Aquinas, one who procured the abortion of a quickened fetus was considered \\"irregular\\", meaning that he was disqualified from receiving or exercising Holy Orders. Pope Sixtus V extended this penalty even to early-term abortion (section 2 of his bull Effraenatam), but Gregory XIV restricted it again. Pius IX made no ruling in its regard, with the result that the penalty of irregularity was still limited to late-term abortion at the time of the article \\"Abortion\\" in the 1907 Catholic Encyclopedia. The 1917 Code of Canon Law finally did away with the distinction.1917 Code of Canon Law, canon 985 4º In summary, with the exception of the three-year period 1588–1591, early abortion was not prohibited by Catholic canon law until 1869.  Discussions about possible justifying circumstances  In the Middle Ages, many Church commentators condemned all abortions, but the 14th-century Dominican John of Naples is reported to have been the first to make an explicit statement that if the purpose was to save the mother's life abortion was actually permitted, provided that ensoulment had not been attained.Aaron L. Mackler, Introduction to Jewish and Catholic Bioethics (Georgetown University Press 2003 ), p. 122 This view met both support and rejection from other theologians. In the 16th century, while Thomas Sanchez accepted it, Antoninus de Corbuba made the distinction that from then on became generally accepted among Catholic theologians, namely that direct killing of the fetus was unacceptable, but that treatment to cure the mother should be given even if it would indirectly result in the death of the fetus. When, in the 17th century, Francis Torreblanca approved abortions aimed merely at saving a woman's good name, the Holy Office (what is now called the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith), at that time headed by Pope Innocent XI, condemned the proposition that \\"it is lawful to procure abortion before ensoulment of the fetus lest a girl, detected as pregnant, be killed or defamed.\\"Mackler 2003, pp. 122-123Alphonsus Maria de Ligorio, Theologia Moralis (Bassano 1831), vol. 1, p. 247 Although it is sometimes said that 18th-century Alphonsus Liguori argued that, because of uncertainty about when the soul entered the fetus, abortion, while in general morally wrong, was acceptable in circumstances such as when the mother's life was in danger,Charles Panati. Sacred Origins of Profound Things: The Stories Behind the Rites and Rituals of the World's Religions (Penguin Arcana 1996), p. 454 he clearly stated that it is never right to take a medicine that of itself is directed to killing a fetus, although it is lawful (at least according to general theological opinion) to give a mother in extreme illness a medicine whose direct result is to save her life, even when it indirectly results in expulsion of the fetus.\\"Question 4. Is it permissible to give a mother in extreme illness medicine to expel a fetus? Reply. Firstly, it is certain that it is not permissible for a mother outside of danger of death to take medicine for expelling even an inanimate fetus, since directly impeding the life of a human being is a grave sin, and a still graver one if the fetus is animate. It is certain, secondly, that it is not permissible for a mother even in danger of death to take medicine for expelling an ensouled fetus directly, since this would be procuring the child's death directly. The question is rather whether it is permissible for a mother to take a medicine absolutely necessary to save her life when it involves danger of expulsion of the fetus. The reply is that, if the fetus is inanimate, the mother may certainly ensure her life, even though, unintentionally on her part, expulsion of the fetus results, an expulsion for which the mother is not responsible, since she is only using her natural right to preserve her life. If the fetus is animate, it is generally held that a mother may take a medicine whose direct purpose is to save her life when nothing else will save it; but it is different in the case of medicines that of themselves are directed to killing a fetus, which it is never permissible to take\\" (Alphonsus Maria de Ligorio, Theologia Moralis (Bassano 1831), vol. 1, pp. 247-248); cf. Timothy Lincoln Bouscaren, When Mother or Baby Must Die (originally published in 1933; reprint: Tradibooks 2008 ), p. 61. While Liguori mentioned the distinction then made between animate and inanimate fetuses, he explained that there was no agreement about when the soul is infused, with many holding that it happens at the moment of conception, and said that the Church kindly followed the 40-day opinion when applying the penalties of irregularity and excommunication only on those who knowingly procured abortion of an animate fetus.Alphonsus Maria de Ligorio, Theologia Moralis (Bassano 1831), vol. 1, pp. 248-249 A disapproving letter published in the New York Medical Record in 1895 spoke of the Jesuit Augustine Lehmkuhl as considering craniotomy lawful when used to save the mother's life.Medical Record vol. 48, no. 2 (13 July 1895), pp. 71-72 The origin of the report was an article in a German medical journal denounced as false in the American Ecclesiastical Review of the same year, which said that while Lehmkuhl had at an earlier stage of discussion admitted doubts and advanced tentative ideas, he had later adopted a view in full accord with the negative decision pronounced in 1884 and 1889 by the Sacred Penitentiary,A. Sabetti, \\"The Catholic Church and Obstetrical Science\\" in American Ecclesiastical Review, New Series, Vol. III (August 1895), pp.128-132 which in 1869 had refrained from making a pronouncement. According to Mackler, Lehmkuhl had accepted as a defensible theory the licitness of removing even an animated fetus from the womb as not necessarily killing it, but had rejected direct attacks on the fetus such as craniotomy.Mackler 2003, p. 123 Craniotomy was thus prohibited in 1884 and again in 1889. In 1895 the Holy See excluded the inducing of non-viable premature birth and in 1889 established the principle that any direct killing of either fetus or mother is wrong; in 1902 it ruled out the direct removal of an ectopic embryo to save the mother's life, but did not forbid the removal of the infected fallopian tube, thus causing an indirect abortion.(see below).Charles E. Curran, The Catholic Moral Tradition Today: A Synthesis, pp. 201-202 In 1930 Pope Pius XI ruled out what he called \\"the direct murder of the innocent\\" as a means of saving the mother. And the Second Vatican Council declared: \\"Life must be protected with the utmost care from the moment of conception: abortion and infanticide are abominable crimes.\\"Mackler 2003, p. 124 Church doctrine=Unintentional abortion The principle of double effect is frequently cited in relation to abortion. A doctor who believes abortion is always morally wrong may nevertheless remove the uterus or fallopian tubes of a pregnant woman, knowing the procedure will cause the death of the embryo or fetus, in cases in which the woman is certain to die without the procedure (examples cited include aggressive uterine cancer and ectopic pregnancy). In these cases, the intended effect is to save the woman's life, not to terminate the pregnancy, and the death of the embryo or fetus is a side effect. The death of the fetus is an undesirable but unavoidable consequence.David F. Kelly, Contemporary Catholic Health Care Ethics, (Georgetown University Press, 2004. ), pp. 111-13 Ectopic pregnancy An ectopic pregnancy is one of a few cases where the foreseeable death of an embryo is allowed, since it is categorized as an indirect abortion. This view was also advocated by Pius XII in a 1953 address to the Italian Association of Urology. Using the Thomistic Principle of Totality (removal of a pathological part to preserve the life of the person) and the Doctrine of Double Effect, the only moral action in an ectopic pregnancy where a woman's life is directly threatened is the removal of the tube containing the human embryo (salpingectomy). The death of the human embryo is unintended although foreseen. The use of methotrexate and salpingectomy remains controversial in the Catholic medical community, and the Church has not taken an official stance on these interventions. The Catholic Health Association of the United States, which issues guidelines for Catholic hospitals and health systems there, allows both procedures to be used. The argument that these methods amount to an indirect abortion revolves around the idea that the removal of the Fallopian tube or, in the case of methotrexate, the chemical destruction of the trophoblastic cells (those which go on to form the placenta), does not constitute a direct act upon the developing embryo. Individual hospitals and physicians, however, may choose to prohibit these procedures if they personally interpret these acts as a direct abortion. Despite the lack of an official pronouncement by the Church on these treatments, in a 2012 survey of 1,800 Ob/Gyns who work in religious hospitals, only 2.9% of respondents reported feeling constrained in their treatment options by their employers, suggesting that in practice, physicians and healthcare institutions generally choose to treat ectopic pregnancies. Embryos The Church considers the destruction of any embryo to be equivalent to abortion, and thus opposes embryonic stem cell research. Sanctions Catholics who procure a completed abortion are subject to a latae sententiae excommunication. That means that the excommunication is not imposed by an authority or trial (as with a ferendae sententiae penalty); rather, being expressly established by canon law, it is incurred ipso facto when the delict is committed (a latae sententiae penalty).Code of Canon Law, canon 1314 Canon law states that in certain circumstances \\"the accused is not bound by a latae sententiae penalty\\"; among the ten circumstances listed are commission of a delict by someone not yet sixteen years old, or by someone who without negligence does not know of the existence of the penalty, or by someone \\"who was coerced by grave fear, even if only relatively grave, or due to necessity or grave inconvenience.\\"Code of Canon Law, canon 1324 See also commentaries on the Code of Canon Law such as E. Caparros, M. Thériault, J. Thorn (editors), Code of Canon Law Annotated (Wilson & Lafleur 1993 ), pp. 829-830 According to a 2004 memorandum by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, Catholic politicians who consistently campaign and vote for permissive abortion laws should be informed by their priest of the Church's teaching and warned to refrain from receiving the Eucharist or risk being denied it until they end such activity.Written in \\"Worthiness to Receive Holy Communion. General Principles\\" by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger on July 3, 2004 This position is based on Canon 915 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law and has also been supported, in a personal capacity, by Archbishop Raymond Leo Cardinal Burke, Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura, the highest judicial authority in the Catholic Church after the pope himself.NCRegister.com \\"America's 'Most Complete' Catholic Newsweekly\\" Pope Francis reaffirmed this position in March 2013, when he stated that \\"[people] cannot receive Holy Communion and at the same time act with deeds or words against the commandments, particularly when abortion, euthanasia, and other grave crimes against life and family are encouraged. This responsibility weighs particularly over legislators, heads of governments, and health professionals.\\"Pope Francis: Pro-abortion Politicians Ineligible for Communion, LifeNews, 7 May 2013 Forgiveness of women who abort Apart from indicating in its canon law that automatic excommunication does not apply to women who abort because of grave fear or due to grave inconvenience, the Catholic Church, without making any such distinctions, assures the possibility of forgiveness for women who have had an abortion. Pope John Paul II wrote: On the occasion of the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy in 2015, Pope Francis announced that all priests (during the Jubilee yearending November 20, 2016) will be allowed in the Sacrament of Penance to remit the penalty of excommunication for abortion, which had been reserved to bishops and certain priests who were given such mandate by their bishop. This policy was made permanent by an apostolic letter titled Misericordia et misera (Mercy and Misery), which was issued on November 21, 2016. Recent statements of the Church's position The Church teaches that \\"human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person – among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.\\" This follows from the fact that probabilism may not be used where human life may be at stake;The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that the embryo \\"must be treated from conception as a person.\\" \\"The church has not determined officially when human life actually begins\\" and respect for life at all stages, even potential life, is generally the context of church documents. (Thomas P. Rausch, S.J. Catholicism in the Third Millennium. Collegeville:Liturgical Press, 2nd Ed. 2003, p. 150. .) the Catholic Catechism teaches that the embryo must be treated from conception \\"as\\" (Latin: tamquam, \\"as if\\") a human person.CCC 2274 And \\"morally significant is the large proportion of embryos lost before and during the process of implantation,\\" estimated at 70 percent that fail to last the first five days. The New Catholic Encyclopedia concludes:New Catholic Encyclopedia, Abortion II, p.29, Col 1. The modern magisterium has carefully avoided confusing \\"human being\\" with \\"human person\\", and avoids the conclusion that every embryonic human being is a person, which would raise the question of \\"ensoulment\\" and immoral destiny. Since the 1st century, the Church has affirmed that every procured abortion is a moral evil, a teaching that the Catechism of the Catholic Church declares \\"has not changed and remains unchangeable.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2271 The Church teaches that the inalienable right to life of every innocent human being is a constitutive element of a civil society and its legislation. In other words, it is beholden upon society to legally protect the life of the unborn.Catechism of the Catholic Church, part 3, section 2, chapter 2, article 5: The Fifth Commandment. The Official Vatican Website. Catholic theologians trace Catholic thought on abortion to early Christian teachings such as the Didache, the Epistle of Barnabas and the Apocalypse of Peter.Abortion, the development of the Roman Catholic perspective By John R. Connery In contrast, Catholic philosophers Daniel Dombrowski and Robert Deltete analyzed Church theological history and the \\"development of science\\" in A Brief, Liberal, Catholic Defense of Abortion to argue that a position in favor of abortion rights is \\"defensibly Catholic.\\" Attitudes of Catholic laity Although the church hierarchy campaigns against abortion and its legalization in all circumstances, including threats to a woman's life or health and pregnancy from rape, many Catholics disagree with this position, according to several surveys of Western Catholic views. United States A majority of U.S. Catholics hold views that differ from the official Church doctrine on abortion, though they also hold more anti-abortion stances than the general public. According to a 1995 survey by Lake Research and Tarrance Group, 64% of U.S. Catholics say they disapprove of the statement that \\"abortion is morally wrong in every case\\". According to a 2016 survey by Pew Research Center, 51% of U.S. Catholics say that \\"having an abortion is morally wrong.\\" Surveys conducted by a number of polling organizations indicate that between 16% and 22% of American Catholic voters agree with Church policy that abortion should be illegal in all cases; the rest of the respondents held positions ranging from support for legal abortions in certain restricted circumstances to an unqualified acceptance of abortion in all cases. According to a 2009 survey by Pew Research Center, 47% of American Catholics believe that abortion should be legal in \\"all or most cases\\", while 42% of American Catholics believe that abortion should be illegal in \\"all or most cases\\". When posed the binary question of whether abortion was acceptable or unacceptable, rather than a question of whether it should be allowed or not allowed in all or most cases, according to polls conducted in 2006-2008 by Gallup, 40% of American Catholics said it was acceptable, approximately the same percentage as non-Catholics. The same poll reported American Catholics as more permissive than American non-Catholics on sex between an unmarried man and woman, divorce, medical research using stem cells obtained from human embryos, having a baby outside of marriage, gambling and homosexual relations. According to the National Catholic Reporter, some 58% of American Catholic women feel that they do not have to follow the abortion teaching of their bishop. However, the results in the United States differ significantly when the polls distinguish between practicing and/or churchgoing Catholics and non-practicing Catholics. Those who attend church weekly are more likely to oppose abortion. According to a Marist College Institute for Public Opinion's survey released in 2008, 36% of practising Catholics, defined as those who attend church at least twice a month, consider themselves \\"pro-choice\\"; while 65% of non-practicing Catholics considers themselves \\"pro-choice\\", According to polls conducted in 2006-2008 by Gallup, 24% of practicing Catholics, defined in this poll as those who attend church \\"weekly or almost every week\\", believe abortion is morally acceptable. It is said that \\"Latino Catholics\\" in the United States are more likely to oppose abortion than \\"White Catholics\\". Some reasons for dissenting from the church's position on the legality of abortion, other than finding abortion morally acceptable, include \\"I am personally opposed to abortion, but I think the Church is concentrating its energies too much on abortion rather than on social action\\"Mary T. Hanna, Catholics and American Politics (Harvard University Press 1979 ), p. 154 or \\"I do not wish to impose my views on others.\\"John Finnis, Religion and Public Reasons(Oxford University Press 2011 ), vol. 5, p. 122Susan Elizabeth Davis, Women under Attack (South End Press 1999 ), p. 61Patrick W. Carey, Catholics in America (Greenwood 2004 ), p. 135Christopher Robert Kaczor, The Ethics of Abortion (Taylor & Francis 2010 ), p. 202 According to a poll conducted by Zogby International, 29% of Catholic voters choose their candidate based solely on the candidate's position on abortion; most of these vote for anti-abortion candidates; 44% believe a \\"good Catholic\\" cannot vote for a politician who supports abortion rights, while 53% believe one can. According to 2011 report from Public Religion Research Institute, 68% of American Catholics believe that one can still be a \\"good Catholic\\" while disagreeing with the church's position on abortion, approximately as many as members of other religious groups. On this long-standing phenomenon of a number of Catholics disagreeing with the Church's official position on abortion, Pope John Paul II commented: \\"It is sometimes claimed that dissent from the Magisterium is totally compatible with being a \\"good Catholic\\" and poses no obstacle to the reception of the sacraments. This is a grave error.\\" In what the Los Angeles Times called a key admonition, he added: \\"It has never been easy to accept the Gospel teaching in its entirety, and it never will be.\\" Many, however, suggest that this is the problem, that some of the strongest anti-abortion advocates seem unconcerned about critical social issues in the complete spectrum of the Church's moral teaching. US Cardinal Bernardin and Pope Francis have been prominent proponents of this \\"seamless garment\\" approach. The US Bishops have called on Catholics to weigh all the threats to life and human dignity before placing their vote: the tag \\"intrinsic evil\\" can lead to an over-simplification of issues. In his column in the Jesuit magazine America, Professor John F. Kavanaugh, S.J., observed:America Magazine, Dec. 15, 2008. United Kingdom A 2010 poll indicated that one in fourteen British Catholics accept the Church's teaching that abortion should not be allowed in any circumstances. A 2016 poll found that Catholics in Northern Ireland were far more conservative in their views of abortion than people in Britain. Poland In Poland, where 85% of the population is Catholic, a Pew Research poll from 2017 found that 8% of Polish respondents believed abortion should be legal in all cases and 33% that it should be legal in most cases. On the other hand, 38% believed that it should be illegal in most cases and 13% that it should be illegal in all cases.https://assets.pewresearch.org/wp- content/uploads/sites/11/2017/05/09154356/Central-and-Eastern-Europe- Topline_FINAL-FOR-PUBLICATION.pdf Australia According to one survey, 72% of Australian Catholics say that the decision to have an abortion \\"should be left to individual women and their doctors.\\"BBC – Religions – Christianity:Abortion Italy According to the Italian polling organization Eurispes, between 18.6% and 83.2% of Italian Catholics believe abortion is acceptable, depending on the circumstance. The highest number, 83.2%, is in favor of the voluntary termination of pregnancy in case the mother's life is in danger. Recent events=Belgium Prior to 1990, Belgium remained one of the few European countries where abortion was illegal. However, abortions were unofficially permitted (and even reimbursed out of 'sickness funds') as long as they were registered as \\"curettage\\". It was estimated that 20,000 abortions were performed each year (in comparison to 100,000 births). In early 1990, despite the opposition of the Christian parties, a coalition of the Socialist and Liberal parties passed a law to partially liberalize abortion law in Belgium. The Belgian bishops appealed to the population at large with a public statement that expounded their doctrinal and pastoral opposition to the law. They warned Belgian Catholics that anyone who co-operated \\"effectively and directly\\" in the procurement of abortions was \\"excluding themselves from the ecclesiastical community.\\" Motivated by the strong stance of the Belgian bishops, King Baudoin notified the Prime Minister on March 30 that he could not sign the law without violating his conscience as a Catholic. Since the legislation would not have the force of law without the king's signature, his refusal to sign threatened to precipitate a constitutional crisis. However, the problem was resolved by an agreement between the king and Prime Minister Martens by which the Belgian government declared the king unable to govern, assumed his authority and enacted the law, after which Parliament then voted to reinstate the king on the next day.David Wilsford, Political Leaders of Contemporary Western Europe (Greenwood Press 1995 ), p. 30Geoffrey K. Roberts, Patricia Hogwood, West European Politics (Manchester University Press 2003 ), p. 84Els Witte, Jan Craeybeckx, Alain Meynen, Political History of Belgium (VUB University Press 2010 ), p. 266Encyclopedia of World Constitutions (Facts on File 2006 ), p. 92Sandro Magister, \\"Obama's Pick for Vice President Is Catholic. But the Bishops Deny Him Communion\\" The Vatican described the king's action as a \\"noble and courageous choice\\" dictated by a \\"very strong moral conscience\\". Others have suggested that Baudoin's action was \\"little more than a gesture\\", since he was reinstated as king just 44 hours after he was removed from power. Brazil In March 2009, Archbishop Jose Cardoso Sobrinho said that by securing the abortion of a nine-year-old girl who had been raped by her stepfather, her mother and the doctors involved were excommunicated latae sententiae. This statement of the Archbishop drew criticism not only from women's rights groups and the Brazilian government, but also from Archbishop Rino Fisichella, president of the Pontifical Academy for Life, who said it was unjust, and other churchmen. In view of the interpretations that were placed upon Archbishop Fisichella's article, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a clarification reiterating that \\"the Church's teaching on procured abortion has not changed, nor can it change.\\"The Holy Office Teaches Archbishop Fisichella a Lesson The National Conference of Bishops of Brazil declared the Archbishop's statement mistaken, since in accordance with canon law, when she had acted under pressure and in order to save her daughter's life, the girl's mother certainly had not incurred automatic excommunication and there was insufficient evidence for declaring that any of the doctors involved had. England In September 2013, Archbishop Peter Smith, Vice- President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, decried the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to proceed against two doctors who accepted a request to perform an abortion as a means of sex selection, a procedure that is illegal in Britain and that Archbishop Smith described as one expression of what he called the injustice that abortion is to the unwanted child. India Mother Teresa opposed abortion, and in the talk she gave in Norway on being awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize for Peace, she called abortion \\"the greatest destroyer of peace today\\".Michael Keene, Religion in Life and Society (Folens 2002 ), p. 24Simon Sebag Montefiore, Speeches That Changed the World (Quercus 2005 ), p. 196 She further asserted that, \\"Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love but to use violence to get what they want.\\"Leo Maasburg, Mother Teresa of Calcutta (Ignatius Press 2011 ), p. 169Meg Greene, Mother Teresa: A Biography (Greenwood Press 2004 ), p. 83 Ireland In October 2012, Savita Halappanavar died at University Hospital Galway in Ireland, after suffering a miscarriage which led to sepsis (blood poisoning), multiple organ failure, and her death. She was denied abortion under Irish law because the fetus had a heartbeat and nothing could therefore be done. A midwife explained to her, in a remark for which she later apologized: \\"This is a Catholic country.\\" Widespread protests were subsequently held in Ireland and India, and there was a call to re-examine the Irish abortion laws. On 25 May 2018, the Irish electorate voted by a majority of 66.4% to repeal the 8th Amendment which banned abortion in almost all circumstances, thus allowing the government to legislate for abortion. An exit poll conducted by RTE suggested that almost 70% of those who voted yes considered themselves to be Catholic. New law created by the Irish Parliament allowed for abortion in the first twelve weeks of pregnancy (with an exception to the time limit if the woman's life is at risk). Abortion services commenced on 1 January 2019. Italy Speaking to a group of anti-abortion activists from the Congress of the Movement for Life of Italy, Pope Francis called them Good Samaritans and encouraged them \\"to protect the most vulnerable people, who have the right to be born into life.\\" He called children a gift, and emphasized the dignity of women. He said they were doing \\"important work in favor of life from conception until its natural end.\\" Poland It is widely believed that the Catholic Church in Poland is the main source of opposition to the liberalization of abortion laws and the reintroduction of sex education in Polish schools in accordance with European standards. However, research studies have shown that Polish Catholics have a wide range of views on sex and marriage. Many Polish people, including devout Catholics, complain that the Catholic Church makes demands that very few Catholics want and are able to satisfy. Before the transition to democracy, Poland's government presided over some of the highest abortion rates in Europe, with approximately 1.5 million procedures done per year. Polling in 1991, coming after the collapse of the past communist regime in Poland, found that about 60% of Polish people supported nonrestrictive abortion laws. United States An advocacy organization called Catholics for Choice was founded in 1973 to support the availability of abortion, stating that this position is compatible with Catholic teachings particularly with \\"primacy of conscience\\" and the importance of the laity in shaping church law. In October 1984, CFC (then Catholics for a Free Choice) placed an advertisement, signed by over one hundred prominent Catholics, including nuns, in the New York Times. The advertisement, called A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion contested claims by the Church hierarchy that all Catholics opposed abortion rights, and said that \\"direct abortion ... can sometimes be a moral choice.\\" The Vatican initiated disciplinary measures against some of the nuns who signed the statement, sparking controversy among American Catholics, and intra-Catholic conflict on the abortion issue remained news for at least two years in the United States. Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz excommunicated Catholics in his jurisdiction who were associated with this organization in 1996,Extra- synodal Legislation: Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz at ewtn.com. March 19, 1996. Retrieved 2011-07-20. and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops stated in 2000 that \\"[CFC] is not a Catholic organization, does not speak for the Catholic Church, and in fact promotes positions contrary to the teaching of the Church as articulated by the Holy See and the USCCB.\\"NCCB/USCC President Issues Statement on Catholics for a Free Choice Political debate over legalization of abortion=Position of the Church Since the Catholic Church views procured abortion as gravely wrong, it considers it a duty to reduce its acceptance by the public and in civil legislation. While it considers that Catholics should not favour direct abortion in any field, according to Frank K. Flinn, the Church recognizes that Catholics may accept compromises that, while permitting direct abortions, lessen their incidence by, for instance, restricting some forms or enacting remedies against the conditions that give rise to them. Flinn says that support may be given to a political platform that contains a clause in favour of abortion but also elements that will actually reduce the number of abortions, rather than to an anti-abortion platform that will lead to their increase.Frank K. Flinn, J. Gordon Melton (editor), Encyclopedia of Catholicism (Facts on File 2007 ), p. 5 In 2004, Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, then Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, declared: \\"A Catholic would be guilty of formal cooperation in evil, and so unworthy to present himself for holy Communion, if he were to deliberately vote for a candidate precisely because of the candidate's permissive stand on abortion and/or euthanasia. When a Catholic does not share a candidate's stand in favor of abortion and/or euthanasia, but votes for that candidate for other reasons, it is considered remote material cooperation, which can be permitted in the presence of proportionate reasons.\\" Church treatment of politicians who favor abortion rights Many controversies have arisen between the Church and Catholic politicians who support abortion rights. In most cases, Church officials have threatened to refuse communion to these politicians. In some cases, officials have stated that the politicians should refrain from receiving communion; in others, the possibility of excommunication has been suggested. Medical personnel and hospitals Some medical personnel, including many Catholics, have strong moral or religious objections to abortions and do not wish to perform or assist in abortions.Nurses Against Abortion Suing N.J. Hospital Requiring They Assist In The Procedures (CBS New York, 7 November 2011)NJ nurses explain lawsuit against hospital's abortion requirements (CNA, 15 November 2011) The Catholic Church has argued that the \\"freedom of conscience\\" rights of such personnel should be legally protected. For example, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops supports such \\"freedom of conscience\\" legislation arguing that all healthcare providers should be free to provide care to patients without violating their \\"most deeply held moral and religious convictions.\\"Rob Stein, \\"Rule Shields Health Workers Who Withhold Care Based on Beliefs\\" in Washington Post, 19 December 2008 The Virginia Catholic Conference expressed support for pharmacists who consider that they cannot in conscience be on duty during a sale of emergency contraception, which they believe is the same as abortion. In response to such concerns, many states in the U.S. have enacted \\"freedom of conscience\\" laws that protect the right of medical personnel to refuse to participate in procedures such as abortion. In 2008, towards the end of the second Bush administration, the U.S. federal government issued a new rule that ensured that healthcare workers would have the right to \\"refuse to participate in abortions, sterilizations or any federally funded health service or research activity on religious or ethical grounds.\\" The new rule was welcomed by anti-abortion organizations including the Catholic Church; however, abortion rights advocates criticized the new regulation arguing that it would \\"restrict access not only to abortion but also to contraception, infertility treatment, assisted suicide and stem-cell research.\\" The incoming Obama administration proposed to rescind this rule. Attempts have been made to oblige Catholic hospitals to accept an obligation to perform emergency abortions in cases where the pregnant woman's life is at risk; however, hospitals that agree to perform abortions in contradiction to Church teaching may lose their official qualification as \\"Catholic\\".Bishop strips Ariz. hospital of 'Catholic' description after abortion The Washington Times, 21 December 2010.Nun's excommunication lifted in Phoenix hospital abortion case? (Catholic World News, 13 December 2011 Church authorities have also admonished Catholic hospitals who, following medical standards, refer patients outside the hospital for abortion or contraception, or who perform tests for fetal deformity. One Catholic hospital devotes care to helping women who wish to stop an abortion after the process has begun.Hospital offers help for women who want to halt abortions\\" (Chicago Tribune, 8 February 2011)\\"Catholic Hospital Saves Pregnancies of Women Undergoing Abortions\\" (FoxNews 11 February 2011) In November 2009, when Sister Margaret McBride, as a member of the ethics board of a Catholic hospital, allowed doctors to perform an abortion to save the life of a mother suffering from pulmonary hypertension, Bishop Thomas J. Olmsted determined that she had incurred a latae sententiae excommunication, on the grounds that direct abortion cannot be justified. , the hospital stated that McBride had reconciled with the Church and is in good standing with her religious institute and the hospital.

Each qualifying household would receive a £400 grant. Households that took part were expected to save between £200 to £235 a year on fuel bills, cut their carbon emissions and sustain work for the heating industry. The scheme was announced by the Chancellor Alistair Darling in a Pre-Budget Report at the end of 2009 and launched on 5 January 2010. A similar vehicle scrappage scheme had already been announced in the 2009 budget. The total cost was to be £50 million, with a further £150 million for the Warm Front Scheme. To qualify, one had to live in England and have a working G-rated boiler. Successful applicants received a voucher for £400 off the price of either a modern A-rated boiler or a renewable heating system (such as a biomass boiler, heat pump or micro CHP). After a completed installation, the voucher could be redeemed from the Energy Saving Trust for their £400 monetary value. Some suppliers were criticised for high prices of the replacement boilers offered. Even though some of the major power companies were offering a further £400 discount to match the government voucher, their overall price was still considerably greater than that from an independent fitter. Unlike some other UK schemes, the scheme was taken up widely and all 125,000 vouchers were claimed within a few months, with the scheme then closing. Later schemes were available but were targeted at benefits claimants, rather than the least efficient boilers.
