History The group was led by Keble Drummond (sometimes spelled Keeble), whose first name led to the name of the group.Peter I (2004) \\"Interview With The Cables\\", Reggae Vibes Drummond explained \\"Now, I look at something with a cable and wires, and I say, well, 'Cables' would be a good name because you could send a message across the world, and that's how I came up with the name\\". He was backed by harmony singers Elbert Stewart (baritone) and Vince Stoddart (tenor).Larkin, Colin (1998) \\"The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae\\", Virgin Books, Drummond was taught the basics of guitar by Peter Austin of The Clarendonians and write his first songs after attending a songwriting course. Drummond had previously been a member of The Sylastians, along with Barry Llewellyn and Earl Morgan of The Heptones, and Clive Campbell of The Aces, and the Cables were first formed in 1962.Thompson, Dave (2002) \\"Reggae & Caribbean Music\\", Backbeat Books, After recording a single for Sonia Pottinger around 1966, they recorded a string of singles for Studio One, and these were later collected on the album What Kind of World in 1970. \\"What Kind of World\\" has been described as \\"a classic...a low-key showcase for some of the most under-rated vocals of the age\\". Studio One boss Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd built up demand for the \\"Baby Why\\" single by limiting it to sound system plays for four months before releasing it. The rhythm tracks were later employed by Dodd on several tracks by other artists. Unsatisfied with the lack of money received from Dodd, The Cables recorded for Harry J while they were still under contract to Studio One, with Drummond altering his voice and the single released under the name \\"Herbie Carter\\" (a real singer who recorded for Harry J) to avoid Dodd finding out. By 1970, The Cables had left Studio One. \\"(Everybody) Feel Alright\\" was entered into the Festival Song Contest in 1971, losing out to Eric Donaldson's \\"Cherry Oh Baby\\". They recorded a few more singles for producers such as J.J. Johnson, Harry J, and Bunny Lee (\\"Come On\\", recorded with Slim Smith), but failed to repeat their Studio One success. Drummond left the group to embark on an unsuccessful solo career in 1972, and briefly formed a new group, True Experience, with Trevor Shields and Bobby Ellis, releasing \\"My Girl\\" in 1974. \\"Baby Why\\" formed the basis of deejay tracks from both Dennis Alcapone and Prince Jazzbo, and the rhythm was used by The Gladiators for their 1974 track \\"Rearrange\\".Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (1999) \\"Reggae: 100 Essential CDs\\", Rough Guides, A second album, Baby Why, produced by Harry J, was recorded in 1977, where they were backed by musicians from The in Crowd and Third World. The Cables have reformed several times in the years that followed. Drummond earned a living working in a shoe factory during The Cables' peak and moved to the United States in 1979, later working for American Airlines. A third album, also titles Baby Why and credited to \\"Cables and friends\\" was issued in 1993, and led to The Cables performing at the 1994 Reggae Sunsplash festival.

The architectural scheme was drawn up by Saxon royal architect Christian Franz Schuricht (1753‚Äì1832) from Dresden. In the last few years of construction, Johann Philipp J√∂ndl (1782‚Äì1870) also controlled the construction. He also eminently influenced the final appearance of the castle. Functionally, the castle is divided into three parts. The main (central) building with exquisite halls was the residence of the family, with two quarter circle adjacent lower wings with pillared colonnades where the guest rooms were situated. To those wings were connected other pavilions. In the right one is situated the mansion's chapel and theatre, which were finished in the first half of the 19th century. In the left one, there is an extensive library dating from the 16th to 19th century. The castle is surrounded by a vast park that was founded already in 1789, according to the plan of famous Viennese botanist Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin (1727‚Äì1817).

Platforms  Adjacent stations History The station was opened by Japanese Government Railways (JGR) on 20 July 1928 with the name as an additional station on the existing Kagoshima Main Line track. With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR), the successor of JGR, on 1 April 1987, JR Kyushu took over control of the station. With the inauguration of the Kyushu Shinkansen service to the station, the station building was moved 500 metres south and reopened with new Shinkansen platforms on 12 March 2011 and renamed Chikugo-Funangoya.JR Kyushu News Release (December 17, 2010) , retrieved on December 18, 2010 The location of the old station was converted into a maintenance depot. Passenger statistics In fiscal 2016, the station was used by an average of 1,049 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), and it ranked 159th among the busiest stations of JR Kyushu.

He served as Minister of the Navy under Louis XVI, and was a member of the Institut de France. He was brother to botanist Marc Antoine Louis Claret de La Tourrette. Life =Ancien Regime= Fleurieu was born in Lyon. He joined the Navy on 31 October 1755 at Toulon as a Garde-marine, aged just 13 and a half. He subsequently took part in the campaigns of the Seven Years' War‚Äî which ended in 1763‚Äî participating in the battles of Mahon, Lagos, and Les Sablettes and rising to brigadier in the gardes de la marine company, and then enseigne de vaisseau. In suggesting de Fleurieu's promotion to ensign, on 23 March 1762, the Minister wrote to the king: On 1 July 1765 he was made Enseigne de port, and on 27 July he went to Paris to study horology with Ferdinand Berthoud. He took part in a one-year sea campaign to test Berthoud's first marine chronometer, in an attempt to beat Britain in the race to find a reliable way to calculate longitude. The chronometers he thus refined with Ferdinand Berthoud for their later experiments were the object of major struggles with the king's horologer, Pierre Le Roy. Finally Claret de Fleurieu and Berthoud were entrusted with the task, setting out on the testing expedition from autumn 1768 to 11 October 1769 on the corvette Isis under Fleurieu's command. The chronometers almost invariably indicated the hour as accurately after the ship had left port, as if they were still on land. Knowing the actual local time at each present location by astronomy, they could easily determine the ship's exact position and longitude on a chart. The results of their observations was published in 1773 under the title Voyage fait par ordre du roi, pour √©prouver les horloges marines (\\"Voyage made by order of the king, to test marine chronometers\\"). We can also cite among his major works le Neptune du Nord or l'Atlas du Cattegat et de la Baltique, an atlas of the Kattegat and the Baltic Sea that took him 25 years. Made lieutenant de vaisseau on 1 October 1773, then deputy inspector of naval charts and plans, he also became deputy inspector of the naval academy on 15 May 1776. He was presented to the king and named capitaine de vaisseau on 5 December 1776 and soon afterwards director of ports and arsenals in January 1777, a post heading the fleet's organization of mat√©riel, works and movements created specially for him by Louis XVI and one he held for 15 years. In it he directed nearly all planning for naval operations in the 1778-83 war against England as part of France's involvement in the American Revolutionary War, as well as all the French voyages of discovery such as that of La P√©rouse. =French Revolution= The king made him Ministre de la Marine et des Colonies on 26 October 1790. He and the king wanted to separate the naval and colonial ministries, but the Assembl√©e nationale thought otherwise, and he resigned on 15 April 1791. Later that year he was made guardian of the Dauphin, later Louis XVII. He remained in the Tuileries on 10 August 1792, in support of Louis XVI right up until the critical point, but fortunately for him the revolutionaries did not discover this. In the midst of the Reign of Terror, in September 1793, Charles Pierre was arrested due to a letter of recommendation Louis XVI had sent to the Assembl√©e nationale, published in the Universal Monitor on 17 April 1791, in which he first demanded Charles' nomination as the Dauphin's governor. He remained imprisoned with his wife in the Madelonnettes for 14 months; they were finally released to find their homes, furniture, lands and resources dispersed and destroyed. A letter to the section des piques in the prison. discovered in Robespierre's house. speaks of a first arrest, which may suggest Charles was arrested several times and transferred from prison to prison. After the fall of Robespierre he was made a member of the Bureau des longitudes and of the Institut after M. de Bougainville's resignation in 1795. In 1797 (year V) he was elected deputy for the Seine in the Council of Ancients under the name Claret-Fleurieu. He remained so until the coup d'√©tat of 18 Fructidor when he was excluded from the Council. He was elected a member of the Conseil d'√âtat on 24 December 1799. =First French Empire= On 30 September 1800, as Minister Plenipotentiary, he signed a treaty of friendship and commerce between France and the United States at Morfontaine, alongside Joseph Bonaparte. A member of the Council of State in 1800, he presided over its naval section and was interim Minister of the Navy several times during 1803 and 1804. He was named Quartermaster General of the emperor Napoleon's household and of the Imperial civil list on 10 July 1804. On 24 July 1805 he was elected a member of the S√©nat conservateur and made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor. On 1 August 1805, he was made Governor of the Tuileries and the Louvre, taking the oath before the Emperor on 8 September that year. On 2 February 1806 he was elected one of the seven senators who composed the Council of Administration within the Senate for that year. In 1808 he was made Councilor of State for life and an Imperial Count. On 7 September of that same year, Napoleon put him in charge of the investigation into the French defeat at the Battle of Trafalgar. He died in Paris from a devastating cerebral hemorrhage, a few seconds after embracing his two daughters. Napoleon rewarded his services by giving him a state funeral and having his remains transferred to the Panth√©on. Marriage and issue At 54 he married Agla√©-Fran√ßoise Deslacs d'Arcambal; they had one son who died young, Caroline (Madame de Saint-Ouen, from whom his descendants trace their line) and a second daughter.

The HA tag is derived from the HA-molecule corresponding to amino acids 98-106. It has been extensively used as a general epitope tag in expression vectors. Many recombinant proteins have been engineered to express the HA tag, which does not appear to interfere with the bioactivity or the biodistribution of the recombinant protein. This tag facilitates the detection, isolation, and purification of the protein of interest. The HA tag is not suitable for detection or purification of proteins from apoptotic cells since it is cleaved by Caspase-3 and / or Caspase-7 after its sequence DVPD, causing it to lose its immunoreactivity.

They primarily play in competitions organised by the Kerry County Board of the GAA, such as the Kerry Senior Hurling Championship, and also in competitions organised by the North Kerry Hurling Board. The club is principally concerned with the game of hurling but many of their players also play gaelic football, many with Finuge. The club has won 9 Kerry Senior Hurling Championships, 10 Kerry Minor Hurling Championships and 5 Kerry Under-21 Hurling Championships.  History  While the history of hurling in Lixnaw long precedes the founding of the GAA, the club was officially founded in 1888. As reported in the Kerry Sentinel newspaper on Saturday, November 17, 1888, the new club was designated Erin's Hope - Lixnaw and Irremore Branch. The first president was John Trant with Michael Ryan as vice-president. William O'Halloran and John J. Quilter were honorary secretaries with Denis Daly as treasurer. The first club captain was Thomas McCarthy with John Brosnan as vice-captain. During the following year the separation of the sporting codes became evident with hurling being principally played in Lixnaw and football in Irremore. The hurling club in Lixnaw went by the moniker \\"Sir Charles Russell\\" for a time, in honour of a supporter of the Irish Land League. The naming of clubs and teams in such a fashion being commonplace at the time. The division of the Lixnaw and Irremore elements of the branch took place at this time and the latter competed with some success in the County Football Championship. The Irremore area continues as a source of players for both Finuge and St. Senan's Gaelic football clubs. While football was also played in Lixnaw at this time, the predominance of hurling was increasingly evident. When neighbouring Ballyduff, representing Kerry, successfully contested the 1891 All-Ireland hurling final, they included players from Kilmoyley and Ardfert and three men from Ahabeg in Lixnaw, Maurice Fitzmaurice, Maurice Kelly and John Murphy.

The traditional pattern worn is green with a gold hoop. The use of an alternate kit to address a clash of colours has only occurred since 2003, when it was used for the first time in the Kerry Senior Championship final. As is generally the case with all GAA clubs, its use is not agreed to lightly given the strong affiliation between club and colours. The alternate or change kit used by many clubs is a variation or inverse of the normal kit or will use a neutral white jersey. Atypically, Lixnaw have adopted the use of a distinctive blue jersey, which mirrors the alternate kit (based on the Munster GAA colours) used by the Kerry team over many decades. While the green and gold jersey is synonymous with Lixnaw, the blue alternate has been associated with a number of memorable successes on the field of play. The club's crest was designed in 2001 and consists of an image of the Hermitage in Lixnaw with a representation of the nearby river Brick and a salmon on a shield and circlet bearing the name of the club, celtic knotwork and crossed hurleys.

It is found in northeastern Guangdong and parts of Fujian and also in regions with overseas Teochew populations, such as Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and the United States. The Chaoshan region of Guangdong, bordering on Fujian and comprising the cities of Chaozhou, Shantou and Jieyang, forms its own cultural sphere. Teahouses often accompany with Chaozhou music. History Developed from a fusion of elements, popular song, arias of Chinese opera, ancient melodies and pieces of Buddhist music, string music falls into two styles: Rujia yueÔºàÂÑíÂÆ∂‰πêÔºâ is music of the Confucian school that can be performed as an independent instrumental music genre or at weddings and other ceremonies and that aims at elegance and nobility, while Pengding yueÔºàÊ£öÈ°∂‰πêÔºâ is principally the music of the theatre, though it may be played independently: it cultivates a sober, rustic style. Instruments The instruments most commonly employed include several varieties of two-stringed bowed lutes; the zixian (Â≠óÂº¶) erxianÔºà‰∫åÂº¶Ôºâ or touxian (Â§¥Âº¶) the lead instrument in the Hakka style, shorter and higher-pitched than the erxian), the tihu (of lower pitch than the zixian, adapted from the Cantonese gaohu) and the big and small yehu (coconut shell body), as well as several types of plucked lutes: the pipa, large and small sanxian (a fretless bass instrument like the shamisen), qinqin (four-stringed with short, fretted neck and round body), ruan (four-stringed with long, fretted neck and round body) and meihuaqin. Other than this, the zheng (zither) and yangqin (a hammered dulcimer thought to derive from the Iranian santur) are played as well as percussion instruments: a hand-held wooden clapper (muban), a pair of \\"temple\\" blocks (daban and fuban) that mark the beat, and a small drum (zhegu). Cello is sometimes also used, particularly in the style performed in the area of Shantou. Characteristics The ten characteristic compositions of xianshi yue are * Zhaojun Yuan (Êò≠ÂêõÊÄ®, Grief of Wang Zhaojun) * Xiaotaohong (Â∞èÊ°ÉÁ∫¢) * Hanya Xishui (ÂØíÈ∏¶Êà≤Ê∞¥, Jackdaws Play in the Water) * Huangli Ci (ÈªÑÈπÇËØç, The Oriole's Cry) * Yue'er Gao (ÊúàÂÑøÈ´ò, High Moon) * Dababan (Â§ßÂÖ´Êùø, Great Eight Beats) * Pingsha Luoyan (Âπ≥Ê≤ôËêΩÈõÅ, Flock of Geese on the Shore) * Fengqiuhuang (Âá§Ê±ÇÂá∞, The Male Phoenix Seeks the Female) * Wulianhuan (Five Knots of the Chain) * Jinshang Tianhua (Èî¶‰∏äÊ∑ªËä±, Adding Flowers upon Brocade) The form of each of these pieces resembles a suite (taoqu) of variations upon a stock melody (qupai or \\"noted tune\\"). These are called ban or \\"beat\\" variations and follow an ordered sequence with changes of tempo and measure (most pieces have six or eight beat measures). Augmentation and diminution of the melody is used, so that it may repeatedly double in speed through the variations. The technique of cui introduces a division-like filling in of the melody with figures such as repeated notes and neighbouring or passing notes. Perfect-fourth transposition of the melody (fan) also occurs, though the tonal centre remains constant. Four or five main modes (diao) are traditionally identified. However, while elsewhere in China such modes are mainly defined by absolute pitch and by the degree of the pentatonic scale that is taken as the key-note (thus setting the intervals of the scale), the xianshi conception of mode, rather like the Indian raga system, includes motif, ornament and intonation. Pitch is not absolute but the scale is usually constructed on a key-note approximating to western concert F - F#. Modes are pentatonic but all derive from a seven-note scale: no notice is taken of the starting and finishing tones of the melody in determining the mode and the key-note remains the same in every mode. Tunes may be adapted to a new mode, but the mode remains constant throughout any performance of the suite. Apart from the major pentatonic scale two further tones, corresponding to a (sharp) perfect fourth and a (flat) major seventh, are employed. The \\"missing\\" steps of the scale in each mode may be used in ornament but are not part of main mode structure. The mode qingsan qingliu (\\"Light III Light VI\\") is the standard major pentatonic. But qingsan zhongliu (\\"Light III Heavy VI\\") calls for a heavy string-pressure upon the sixth degree, raising it to the seventh. Zhongsan zhongliu (\\"Heavy III Heavy VI\\"), similarly, applies this upward string-bend to the third degree as well, raising it to the fourth. The fourth common scale, called Huowu (\\"Live V\\"), resembles this last but avoids the plain third degree and instead uses a heavy vibrato on the second degree. This is said to be the most characteristic mode of the region. Chaozhou drum music includes the big drum and gong, the small drum and gong, the dizi set drum and dong and su drum and gong ensembles. The current Chaozhou drum music is said to be similar to the form of the Drum and Wind Music of the Han and Tang Dynasties.

The band Sau, after the success achieved on PICAP with Quina nit, signed for a multinational record label. The band Sangtra√Øt, however, stayed with PICAP and prepared its fourth album Contes i llegendes at a time when Catalan rock had reached its peak. Rock and ‚ÄúCan√ß√≥‚Äù became PICAP's main genres with notable artists in both genres. In 1991, Llu√≠s Llach joined the record label because of its prestige and trustworthiness, then established ties with Companyia El√®ctrica Dharma, Tomeu Penya, Raimon, Maria del Mar Bonet, and Marina Rossell. In 1993, the record company received National Music Awards in Catalonia for their releases. In the late 1990s, the Valencian band Al Tall published with PICAP.

In May 2001, Latvian Defense Minister ƒ¢irts Valdis Kristovskis said in a radio interview that \\"Our probable enemy is objectively in the east\\" and that \\"Europe objectively believes that there is the last totalitarian regime in Europe\\". After a protest by the Belarusian Foreign Ministry declared a protest, Prime Minister Andris Berzins condemned the minister's statement. The year 2004 saw a sharp deterioration in Latvian- Belarusian relations, set by President Vaira Vike-Freiberga, whose government encouraged personal efforts by U.S. Senator John McCain to restore democracy in Belarus. The Open Belarus organization was founded in Latvia during this time, calling on future Latvian MEPs to prioritize observance of freedom of speech in Belarus. In 2011, Latvia condemned the conviction of opposition leader Ales Bialiatski, Rinkƒìviƒçs nosoda Baltkrievijas cilvƒìktiesƒ´bu aktƒ´vista notiesƒÅ≈°anu 2011 calling on Belarus to ensure the observance of human rights and the holding of democratic elections,Latvija mudina Baltkrieviju uz progresu cilvƒìktiesƒ´bu ievƒìro≈°anƒÅ 11.2012 as well as to release political prisoners.

In general, there is only one case of a meeting of the heads of state of the two countries is known. This occurred on 5 September 1997 in Vilnius, when President Guntis Ulmanis met with President Alexander Lukashenko. In 2019, as part of the Latvia 100 celebrations in Minsk, Ulmanis visited Belarus and met Lukashneko, this time as the former president.

On 11 July 2007, a historic meeting was held between Latvian Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis and his Belarusian counterpart Sergei Sidorsky in the forest on the Latvian-Belarusian border. This was due to sanctions being imposed on Belarus, which meant that Sidorsky could not enter any nation of the European Union.

Overview Set in the fictional town of Harrison, Texas, in 1987, it focuses on the Gordons, a clan of malcontents ruled by octogenarian matriarch Stella that must prepare for an uncertain future when plunging real estate values and an unexpected tax bill have a negative impact on the family fortune. Stella's children - predatory Mary Jo, complacent Lucille, and alcoholic Lewis - engage in a debate about whether or not they should divide the estate while their mother is still alive in order to ensure themselves financial independence.

It is often used in the phrase Mai nafka minnah? (◊û◊ê◊ô ◊†◊§◊ß◊ê ◊û◊ô◊†◊î), which asks, \\"What is the practical difference?\\" Terminology The question mai nafka minnah is a way of testing the difference between two or more explanations for a given law, by investigating the different practical halachic rulings that would follow from each explanation. In other words, it means \\"so how do they differ in practice?\\" It is contrasted with the question be-mai peligei, which also means \\"how do they differ\\", but implies that the two views have the same practical consequences and that the difference is the intellectual process by which they are arrived at (for example, which Biblical verse is the relevant authority). Example Examples of a nafka minnah abound, both in Jewish law as derived from the Talmud, as well as in any situation that presents multiple rationales for a particular item. To begin the Shabbos meals, kiddush is recited, followed by the eating of challah. During kiddush, the challah should be covered,Shlomo Ganzfried, Kitzur Shulchan Aruch, 77:8 which has led to a market for commercially available challah covers that are often beautifully decorated with embroidery or other designs. There are three reasons given for this practice: #As a commemoration of the manna, which was covered by dew.Shlomo Ganzfried, Kitzur Shulchan Aruch, 77:8 #As a mechanism to allow for the wine to be consumed prior to the bread.Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim, Hilchot Shabbos 271:9 + associated Mishnah Berurah In Jewish law, blessings are recited prior to the consumption of food or drink, and when faced with multiple food and drink items, there are laws stipulating which items should precede which others. Bread, as a staple food item, precedes all other foods and, in fact, the blessing recited over bread covers other food items (with some exceptions). If the bread was allowed to remain uncovered during the kiddush, its preferential status would be belittled (known as kadima, literally \\"precedence\\" or \\"priority\\") when the wine is consumed first.Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim, Hilchot Shabbos 271:9, associated Mishnah Berurah #As a display of honor for the Shabbos meals (◊ô◊ß◊®◊ê ◊ì◊©◊ë◊™◊ê - lit. \\"preciousness of Shabbos\\").Talmud Pesachim 100b, Tosafot she'ein The notion of covering the challah is based on giving each course a sense of newness and fanfare by allowing it to \\"make an entrance.\\" Each course is therefore brought out separately, rather than having them all at the table when the meal begins. Because the challah is supposed to be on the table during kiddush,Yehoshua Neuwirth, Shemirat Shabbat Kehilchatah 47:24 though, it is kept covered until it is ready to be served. Now that the custom to cover the challah has been established together with its three reasons, one could ask what the nafka minnah would be between the three reasons‚Äîhow would a difference in practice occur as a result of one rationale being dominant over another? Each of the following bullets represents a distinct nafka minnah: *If the covering of the challah is because of kadima, the challah may be uncovered immediately after kiddush; if because of the manna or honor, the challah should not be uncovered just because kiddush is over, but should remain covered until after hamotzi (the blessing over the challah) is recited. *Kiddush is not recited at the third meal. If covering the challah is because of the dew or honor, it should be covered at the third meal as well; if because of kadima, there is no wine to disrupt the sequence of blessings and no cover is necessary. *Because the dew enveloped the manna on both the top and bottom, the challah should be covered both above and below;Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim, Hilchot Shabbos 271:9; associated Mishnah Berurah if because of kadima or honor, a simple napkin placed over the challah would do. *If covering the challah is because of kadima, only food items that precede wine in the sequence of blessings should be covered at the time of kiddush or remain off the table until after kiddush. This would include only bread (which has a blessing of hamotzi) and cake (which has a blessing of mezonos); if covering is because of the dew, only challah needs to be covered; if because of honor, even gefilte fish, coleslaw and other foods on the table should be covered (or brought to the table only when their respective course begins).This is the view of Rabbi Hershel Schachter, rosh yeshiva at Yeshiva University. *If one makes kiddush over the challah (which is not ideal, but certainly permitted if one does not have wine), there is no issue of kadima and perhaps none of honor either, and no cover should be necessary; if because of dew, the challah should still be covered. =Reconciliation= *In practice, bread is not covered except on Shabbos and Jewish holidays with Shabbos-like work restrictions because bread eaten on a weekday is not tied to the manna. It is only on Shabbos, when two loaves are required as a commemoration of the double portion of manna that was given in the wilderness in honor of Shabbos, that we link our bread to the manna that was enveloped in dew. *Many people do not cover the other foods on the table during kiddush. *The Mishnah Berurah asserts that when making kiddush on challah, one should place one's hands on the challah cover until one reaches the actual blessing on the bread, uncover the challah and place one's hands on the challah itself for that blessing and then recover the challah and once again grab the challah through the cover for the concluding words of the kiddush.Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim, Hilchot Shabbos 271:9, associated Mishnah Berurah *Quoting the Aruch Hashulchan, Shemirat Shabbat Kehilchatah asserts that, while \\"it is not the custom to cover the challah during the third meal,\\" some do indeed cover them to follow the other reasons.Yehoshua Neuwirth, Shemirat Shabbat Kehilchatah 56:7 References Category:Aramaic words and phrases Category:Talmud concepts and terminology ","title":"Nafka minnah"},{"id":"20052713","text":"Eupithecia nanata, the narrow-winged pug, is a moth of the family Geometridae.

Ot is built of Cotswold stone and is one of the \\"largest parish churches in England\\". It contains various tombs and monuments with some fragments of medieval stained glass and wall paintings. History The church is medieval. It is renowned for its perpendicular porch, fan vaults and merchants' tombs. The chancel is the oldest part of the church. Construction started in the 12th century on the site of an earlier Saxon one. It was widened in about 1180. Around 1240 the nave was completely rebuilt. The east window dates from around 1300. The original stained glass of the east window has long since disappeared and it is now filled with fifteenth century glass from other parts of the church. To the north of the chancel is St. Catherine's Chapel which dates from around 1150. It contains a wall painting of St. Christopher carrying the Christ Child, and vaulting given by Abbot John Hakebourne in 1508 when major reconstruction took place funded by the wool trade making it an example of a Wool church. To the north of St. Catherine's Chapel is the Lady Chapel, first built in 1240 and extended in the 15th century. The tower was built and supported by buttresses around 1400. The Trinity Chapel dates from 1430‚Äì1460 and was endowed for a priest of the nearby Abbey to say masses for the souls of Kings and Queens. It contains a squint which enabled the priest to synchronise the celebration of mass with that at the high altar.Church guide. Free issue. The nave was completely rebuilt between 1515 and 1530 and is a remarkable example of late Perpendicular Gothic architecture.Cirencester Parish Church. Canon Rowland E. Hill. The tower is fifteenth century and remarkable for the large buttresses which shore it up at its junction with the nave. The great south porch which adjoins the market place was built around 1500 at the expense of Alice Avening. It is elaborately decorated. It was built by Cirencester Abbey around 1480, as an administrative centre and only connected to the church in the 18th century. Between the dissolution of the monasteries and its connection to the church it was used as the town hall. The nave was again rebuilt between 1516 and 1530. In 1642 the church was used to imprison local citizens overnight after the skirmishes in the town during the English Civil War. During the 1860s George Gilbert Scott lead a team undertaing a Victorian restoration to strengthen the church, which included moving many of the bodies intered under the nave to the Lady Chapel. This reduced the level of the floor and introduced sub floor voids. These were investigated during alterations carried out in 2008 and 2009, which discovered evidence of the various periods of the church's construction. In 2019 a design competition was started to commission statues for niches on the church wall, to replace those removed and lost in 1963. Architecture and fittings The Cotswold stone church is long and wide. The three-stage buttressed tower is high. This makes it one of the \\"largest parish churches in England\\". The layout of the church includes a three-bay chancel and three-bay aisled nave. The nave includes arcades of tall piers with carved angels at the tops supporting arches and windows. The west tower houses bells which have been added to and recast, mostly by Rudhall of Gloucester, over the centuries. The three-storey south porch has carved oriel windows and crenellated parapets topped by decorative pinnacles. The interior is a profusion of pannelling in the chambers. The pulpit dates from the 15th century. The octagonal font was carved in the 14th century. It was returned to the church in the 19th century after it had been discovered in the abbey grounds. The brass chandeliers were made in Bristol in 1701. There are several stained glass windows. Some of these include fragments of medieval glass but are largely 18th century by Hardman & Co.. The east windows of the chancel and south chapel were built around 1300. There are some surviving fragments of wall paintings particularly in St Catherines chapel, and a wide variety of tombs and monuments.

This species has two generation a year, in June and in late July‚ÄìSeptember. The larvae feed on coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara) and sometimes also butterbur (Petasites species). The larvae of the spring generation feed in the stem from the base up to the receptacle of the flower head, with pupation taking place either there or on a leaf. The summer generation are miners.

Named for Mount Carmel in the Haifa district, the first issue was published in December 1908, with the stated purpose of \\"opposing Zionist colonization\\".Cubert, 1997, p. 26.Be≈°ka, Emanuel: ANTI-ZIONIST JOURNALISTIC WORKS OF NAJƒ™B AL-KH≈™Rƒ™ NASSƒÄR IN THE NEWSPAPER AL-KARMAL IN 1914.

The owner, editor and key writer for the newspaper was Najib Nassar,Fleischmann, 2003, p. 273, note 107. a Palestinian Arab Christian and staunch anti-Zionist, whose editorials warning of the dangers posed by Zionism to the Palestinian people were often reprinted in other Syrian newspapers.Khalidi, 1997, p. 125.Khalidi, 1997, p. 136. Beginning in the 1920s, Najib's wife Sadhij Nassar (c.1900 - c.1970) was also a key editor, administrator and journalist for the newspaper. Besides writing, she also translated articles from the foreign press, and was editor from 1941 to 1944, when the British Mandate authorities refused to grant her a permit. After the demise of the Ottoman empire in the wake of World War I, Al-Karmil continued to be published during British Mandatory rule in British Palestine well into the 1940s.Fawaz et al., 2002, p. 107. Editorial policies =Anti-Zionism= Writing of Al-Karmil and another early Arab Palestinian newspaper, Filastin, Rashid Khalidi characterizes them as \\"instrumental in shaping early Palestinian national consciousness and in stirring opposition to Zionism.\\"Khalidi, 1997, p. 217, n. 31. Khalidi contends that almost immediately after the publication of its first issue in December 1908, al- Karmil \\"became the primary vehicle of an extensive campaign against Zionist settlement in Palestine.\\" Najib Nassar, owner, editor and journalist for the paper, not only printed news items and editorials concerning Zionism and its aims, but also re-published articles on Zionism from other Arabic newspapers based in Cairo, Beirut and Damascus, such as al-Muqattam, al-Ahram, al-Mufid, al-Ittihad al-'Uthmani, and al-Muqtabas, as well as from Istanbul-based al- Hadara and Jaffa-based Filastin. Further, Nassar devoted detailed coverage to the activities and aims of Zionist organizations in Palestine and abroad. Between March and June 1911, al-Karmil published a sixteen-part series on \\"Zionism: Its history, objective, and importance\\" that was later released as a 65-page booklet. The material included condensed translation of the article on Zionism from the Encyclopedia Judaica, and Nassar's comments.Be≈°ka, Emanuel: ARABIC TRANSLATIONS OF WRITINGS ON ZIONISM PUBLISHED IN PALESTINE BEFORE THE FIRST WORLD WAR. In Asian and African Studies, 23, 1,2014. The booklet concluded by describing the efforts of Theodor Herzl on behalf of Zionism, calling for men like Herzl, \\"...who will forget their private interests in favor of the public good,\\" to step forth from among the Palestinian population to oppose Zionism. Nassar's purpose was to incite public opinion against Zionism, whose aims and activities he viewed as a threat to the Arab character of Palestine, but he also focused on alerting the public to instances in which the ruling Ottoman and later British authorities were colluding with Zionists to facilitate Jewish land purchases.Seikaly, 2002, p. 38. At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 Najib Nassar spoke out against Turkish entry into the conflict and was put on a wanted list. Accused of spying for the British against Ottoman Turkey and its German allies, he fled from his home in Haifa to Nazareth, and from there, wandered over the Galilee and the eastern bank of the River Jordan. He went on the run for three years, living with Bedouin goat herders in the hills of what is now the Israeli Galilee, West Bank and northern Jordan, narrowly escaping capture.SHEHADEH, Raja. A rift in time: travels with my Ottoman uncle. Profile Books, 256 pages, =Women's rights= In 1926, al-Karmil began publishing a \\"women's page\\" (Safhat al-nisa) that was edited by Sadhij Nassar, Najib Nassar's wife, who also served as an editor and director of administration for the newspaper as a whole.Fleischmann, 2003, p. 71. Her journalistic contributions between 1926 and 1933 have been characterized as a kind of \\"one-woman press\\", wherein she commented on a wide range topics, including women's activities locally, regionally, and internationally. Encouraging women to raise their male and female children equally and to take up work to facilitate their economic independence, Sadhij Nassar also urged women to get involved in politics, while avoiding factionalism in favor of unity.Fleischmann, 2003, p. 72. For example, in the late 1920s, Nassar wrote, \\"You are responsible. Yes, you Palestinian Arab ladies, Muslim and Christian, you are responsible for the integrity of the nation (its \\"watan\\") and keeping Palestine Arab as it was until now. Every woman will spread the spirit of cooperation among the sons of the Arabs in the souls of her children.\\"Fleischmann, 2003, p. 81. In 1930 Sadhij Nassar was a founding member and secretary of the Arab Women's Union in Haifa, which was one of the more militant branches of the women's movement during the British Mandate period. Relationship with the ruling authorities =Ottoman rule= In its early years, al-Karmil‚Ä≤s editorial line reflected a positive approach toward the ruling imperial authorities, the Turkish Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), but by 1911, like most other pan-Arabist thinkers, it switched to opposing the CUP because of its perceived bias in favor of Zionism.Khalidi, 1997, p. 126. Among the contributing writers to al-Karmil were many who had participated in the Arab revolt of 1916, such as Druze intellectual Ali Nasir al-Din and educator and journalist Hamdi al- Husayni.Firro, 2003, p. 236, n. 15.Matthews, 2006, p. 268. =British Mandate rule= In the late 1930s, Sadhij Nassar was described by the British authorities as \\"a menace to public security\\" and a \\"prominent agitator\\". Arrested in March 1939 by British police and held in administrative detention under the Defense Emergency Regulations in a women's prison in Bethlehem until February 1940, when she was detained because \\"she was actively engaged in subversive propaganda.\\"Fleischmann, 2003, p. 132. After her release, she returned to editing al-Karmil, serving as the editor between 1941 and 1944, when the newspaper was operating without a permit after the British authorities had refused to issue one. She continued her activities in the women's movement until 1948, when she became a refugee and wrote for various publications in London and in Damascus, where she tried to open a branch of the Arab Women's Union. She is believed to have died in Damascus during the 1970s.A Lifetime With 'Abdu'l-Bah√° p. 105 apud Fleischmann, Ellen L.

Becker proved himself a brutal, ruthless and debauched man, even to SS standards according to official Waffen-SS inquiries: \\"On the Eastern Front, Becker has raped Russian women in public and has appeared completely drunk on several occasions in the frontlines as regimental commander. In Spring 1943, he had organised prostitutes to come to his command centre and on the 20th April 1943, he had all the artillery sent a ten-minute salute salvo to celebrate the F√ºhrer‚Äôs birthday.

Her father was Robert Brown, the first Aboriginal stipendiary magistrate. His father's father was a black tracker on the NSW south coast.

His family moved to the new \\"model suburb\\" of Green Valley in Sydney's south-west. In 1966, a Sydney City Mission report on the suburb described \\"a lack of community life, a breakdown in family life, large numbers of deserted wives, needy children and bewildered people\\". Within two years of moving there, Bobby had been sentenced to five years in jail for assault and robbery after a fight at Blacktown RSL. After being released from prison in 1968, Bobby played rugby league for the Redfern All Blacks. Bobby was in prison a second time in 1973 when his father died. He wrote his first song, \\"Wayward Dreams\\", after attending the funeral on day release. After being released from jail, Bobby lived at the Aboriginal Tent Embassy on the lawns of parliament house in Canberra.

After about an hour Charlie Perkins arrived from outside parliament house and convinced Bobby to give him the gun. Charlie removed the bullets from the gun, which he later handed over to the police. The fact that there were no bullets in the gun when it was given to the police meant that Bobby was only charged with possession of an unlicensed gun, rather than the much more serious charge that would have followed if it had been loaded. Bobby was fined $40 for the incident and put on a 12-month good behaviour bond.\\"Senate attack on Govt\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 1974-03-07, p9.

A few days after the incident, during an interview on ABC radio, Bobby said \\"I would die for my people, I'm not frightened of that\\". After that, Bobby left Canberra for Melbourne, where he played with a group called the Kooriers with Paul and Dudley (aka Doug) Meredith, a couple of musicians from Cherbourg in Queensland. They played a lot of union gigs and recorded a demo tape at the ABC studios. According to Bobby, the Kooriers music expressed \\"the confusion and frustration of Aborigines and their cultural dilemma which came as a result of westernisation\\". Bobby said later that the reason why the Kooriers didn't go further than they did was because they drank too much. When the Meredith brothers left Melbourne, he immersed himself even more deeply in alcohol, singing here and there, but mostly devoting his life to drinking. He hit rock bottom in 1983 when he went into an alcohol-related coma for seven days, and nearly died. That was his wakeup call and he returned to Nowra, after an absence of twenty years, and gave up drinking permanently. In 1987, Bobby played at the Tamworth Country Music Festival. While he was there, he met people from the Enrec recording studio and ended up recording with them, Buddy Knox and Mick Lieber. This led to his first album Culture Up Front being released by Larrikin Records in 1988. In 1990, Bobby, along with Vic Simms, Roger Knox and the Euraba band were invited to North America by Indigenous Americans, to play prisons and reservations. When he got back to Australia, he recorded his second album Spirit Mother, backed by the Flying Emus. Talking about the change of mood from his previous album, Bobby said \\"[......] if you sing about the sorrow of things, it sort of keeps people in that sadness. So what I did [with Spirit Mother] was to try and change it to find out what was good about being me and stuff.\\" Inspired by his experiences with Indigenous people in Canada, Bobby set up the Doonooch Aboriginal Healing and Cultural Centre at Wreck Bay in 1990 - initially as an attempt to address the high levels of violence found in Aboriginal communities. 'Doonooch' refers to the owl dreaming. In the early 1990s, he started the Doonooch dance group, primarily as a way to keep young Aboriginal people away from alcohol and other drugs and provide them with gainful employment and a cultural and spiritual awakening. In 2000 the Doonooch dancers performed at the Olympic Games opening ceremony and at the World Indidgenous Forum in Noumea. In 2002 Bobby McLeod co-taught, along with Dr. Tom Balistrieri, an engineering class at Worcester Polytechnic Institute titled, Indigenous Wisdom and Modern Technology. The class focused on Life Lore and Dead Lore and how engineers must take this into account when designing and building projects. Bobby lived in the home of Tom and Kathryn Balistrieri during that time. McLeod's album Dumaradje was nominated for Best World Music Album at the 2005 ARIA Awards.The Age List of nominees \\"Wayward Dreams\\" was featured in both the SBS documentary and the accompanying cd, Buried Country: The Story of Aboriginal Country Music.

The ministry combined the administration of the navy, the colonies like New France and seaborne trade helping for example the French East India Company. A widely held view at the time was that for states to be powerful, wealthy and prestigious, colonies in the New World need to be maintained for their consequent trade. The maintenance of colonies through naval operations not only served to improve the stature of the state, but was also helpful in destroying their European rivals in North America. After the Second World War, the Ministry of the Navy was merged with the War Ministry, absorbing the role of the Minister of the Navy and Colonies, with a Minister of National Defence directing the entire military French forces. Creation and History Since the 16th century, the Secretary of State of the Navy (French: Secr√©taire d'√âtat de la Marine) was responsible for the French early navy and colonies. In 1624, Louis XIII‚Äôs first minister, Cardinal Richelieu created the first model of the modern French Navy, also known as the Marine or La Royale, run by the Secretary of State of the Navy. The official French Marine was not established until 7 March 1669 by Jean-Baptiste Colbert. At this time, the ministry of marine became an official government department with a permanent staff, holding offices at Versailles. All of the policies and procedures for the marine were established by Colbert. The Secretary of State of the Navy was responsible for the administration of both the navy (the \\"marine royale\\") and civilian (merchant marine) fleets, and for all France's ports, arsenals, consulates, and colonies, as well as the guardianship for all her commercial companies. The two French royal fleets (the Ponant fleet and Levant fleet) were put under the control of Colbert from 1662, whilst he was \\"intendant des finances\\" and \\"minister of state\\"‚Äîbut not \\"secretary of state\\" : he only became secretary of state in 1669 after having bought his way into the post. From then on, right up to the French Revolution, a secretary of state had responsibility for the fleet. To his two original offices (the bureau du Ponant and bureau du Levant) other services were added over time: *archives department, 1669 ; *office of the Ponant consulates, 1709 ; *office of the colonies, 1710 ; *bureau des classes, 1711 ; *department of maps and plans, 1720 ; *Office of the Levant Consulates, 1738, which was in 1743 merged with the Office of the Ponant Consulates under the name of Office of Commerce and Consulates These different offices and departments were regrouped into four super-departments by marshal de Castries in 1786. In 1791, the Secretary of State of the Navy was changed to Minister of the Navy. Before the 1890s, this position also usually had responsibility for France's colonies, and was usually known as Minister of the Navy and Colonies (French: Minist√®re de la Marine et des Colonies). In 1947 the naval ministry was absorbed into the Ministry of Defence. Personnel At the head of the marine was the Ministre de la Marine, manned by a French statesman. Ministers of Marine typically came from families of administrative nobility (La Plume), such as the Phelypeaux‚Äôs. From 1690 until 1749, a Phelypeaux was secretary and minister in charge of the marine and its colonies. The most prominent of the family was Jean-Frederic Phelypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain et Maurepas. Under his guidance, the marine regained much of the strength and prestige that it had lost during the period of the Regencies (1715‚Äì1726). As well, he was able to ascertain much larger than normal budgets for the Marine. Thus under Jean-Frederic‚Äôs leadership, France was able to regain its reputation as a maritime power.Rule, John C., \\"Jean-Frederic Phelypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain et Maurepas: Reflections on His Life and His Papers\\", The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association Vol 6: 1965, p 365-377 List of ministers References Bibliography *Jean-Philippe Zanco, Dictionnaire des Ministres de la Marine 1689-1958, S.P.M.

He was the illegitimate son of the Baron de Gasq, Pr√©sident of the Parlement de Guyenne. Life = Before 1790 = A director of the Compagnie des Indes, he became Ma√Ætre des requ√™tes in 1767 then in October 1788 one of the three commissaries charged with discussing and examining everything on the financial administration. Claude Antoine Valdec de Lessart was one of the intimates of Jacques Necker. Louis XVI of France made him one of the commissaries charged with reconciling the three orders of the Estates General. = Revolution = On 4 December 1790, he was summoned to the Contr√¥le g√©n√©ral des finances, then on 25 January 1791 moved to the Interior Minister, all the while holding onto the finance portfolio. At the Financial ministry, √âtienne Clavi√®re and the Girondins preyed on his management of the post, whilst at the interior ministry Camille Desmoulins, Louis-Marie Stanislas Fr√©ron and Jean- Paul Marat reproached his sympathies for the refractory clergy. During the Varennes affair, he revealed himself as a docile executor of the orders of the Legislative Assembly. He was then made interim Naval Minister in September 1791 and interim Minister of Foreign Affairs that October when the main concern was the bellicose activities of the emigrees based in Treves and Mayence. The threat to go to war with their hosts, the Rheinish Electors, sufficed to have the √©migr√© armies ordered to disband. However, that December the emperor of Austria announced Austrian troops would support the Rheinish electors and war with Austria became a real possibility. That possibility was welcomed by the Assembly and de Lessart could do little to prevent it (He did send Talleyrand to London in January 1792 to seek English neutrality if not support). The Assembly resented de Lessart's cautious - some said treasonable - approach and on 1 March voted to have him impeached. Unpopular and unable to arrest the march to war desired by Jacques Pierre Brissot, he was indicted under Girondin pressure on 10 March 1792. He was transferred to the High Court at Orl√©ans and after 10 August 1792 the trial of prisoners by the Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris was decided upon. Claude Fournier-L'H√©ritier was charged with bringing them as far as Paris, but instead stopped at Versailles and massacred 44 of the 52 prisoners entrusted to him, including Louis Hercule Timol√©on de Coss√©-Brissac, Claude Antoine de Valdec de Lessart and Charles-Xavier Franqueville d'Abancourt.

On 29 May 1792, the Assembly dissolved this corps, suspecting it of royalist and counter-revolutionary sympathies and accusing Coss√©-Brissac of encouraging this and writing a speech ordering his men to go over to the king. He was sent to prison in Orl√©ans to await judgement by the high court before being transferred to Versailles, but the prisoners were separated from their escort and freed by a group of bandits. He was killed in the 9 September massacres, and his body was mutilated, and his head was thrust in a pike and taken on foot by a band of his killers and thrown into a window of Madame du Barry's apartment, at which sight she fainted. With little spirit but much force and courage, he held off his murderers for a long time, receiving several wounds before finally being cut down by a sabre. Always distinguished for his devotion to Louis XVI, he replied to someone praising him for his conduct: \\"I only do what I must do for my ancestors and my family\\". He is mentioned in the fifth verse of Jacques Delille's poem la Piti√©, and anecdotes on him are to be found in Paris, Versailles et les provinces. Marriage and issue Louis- Hercule de Coss√©-Brissac married in 1760 to Diane-Hortense Mancini-Mazarini (1742‚Äì1808), great-great niece of Cardinal Mazarin, and they had two children: * Ad√©la√Øde (1765‚Äì1820), married in 1782 with Victurnien-Jean-Baptiste de Rochechouart, duc de Mortemart * Jules Gabriel Timol√©on (1771‚Äì1775), died during childhood After the death of Louis-Hercule in 1792 without a living male-line descendant, the ducal title passed to Timol√©on de Coss√©-Brissac (1775-1848). He was the eldest son of Hyacinthe-Hugues de Coss√©-Brissac, Duke of Coss√© (1746-1813), whose father was Ren√©-Hugues de Coss√©-Brissac, Count of Coss√© (1702-1754). Ren√©-Hugues was the third son of Artus de Coss√©-Brissac, 5th Duke of Brissac (1668-1709). After Timol√©on de Coss√©-Brissac died in 1848, the title of Duke of Brissac was held by his successive descendants in the male line.

The film is based on a story Prestekonen by Kristofer Janson.  Plot  S√∂fren, a recent seminary graduate, and his fiancee Mari make their way on foot through a Norwegian forest to a village where a church is in need of a pastor. Mari's father won't allow her to marry until S√∂fren obtains a full-time church assignment. S√∂fren learns that he is competing with two other men who are affluent scholars from Copenhagen. The three men wait outside the church until the verger calls them in, one by one, to deliver their trial sermons. The first candidate delivers a sermon on the creation story that promptly puts the entire congregation to sleep. The second candidate is summoned and announces that his sermon topic is \\"Balaam's ass and God's strange power by which He was able to open the jaws of a dumb animal so that it might speak like a man!\\" (Numbers 22:28-30) The verger comes out to summon S√∂fren and finds him doing handstands. S√∂fren bounds into the church, surveys the congregation and begins: \\"Now, two learned applicants have appeared here before me. One of them took us to Eden, and that is as far back as we can go. Let him stay there! The other one chose the text: Am I Not An Ass? But what has an ass to do on the pulpit? My friends, I will not take you to Eden -- you are too clever. But I will take you to the bowels of the earth, deep in the roaring jaws of Hell!\\" The congregation is enthralled by S√∂fren's \\"fire and brimstone\\" sermon. S√∂fren concludes: \\"And so my friends, beware that you are not swallowed up by the roaring jaws of Hell!\\" S√∂fren's rivals from Copenhagen host a dinner for the townspeople and feel obliged to invite S√∂fren. The church committee announces that S√∂fren is their choice for pastor. The committee spokesman then adds that Margarete Pedersdotter, the widow of the previous pastor, has exercised her right to demand that her husband's successor marry her. Dame Margarete, who is at least a half-century older than S√∂fren, enters the room. The two pastoral candidates from Copenhagen bolt from the room, hastily climb on their horses and gallop away. Margarete doesn't take a seat near S√∂fren but chooses to sit next to the fireplace. Gradually the townspeople also leave the dining hall. After a lengthy period of silence, Margarete approaches S√∂fren and asks, in that it has grown dark outside, if he would walk with her to the parsonage. When they reach the parsonage, Margarete invites S√∂fren inside. As S√∂fren takes note of the fine furnishings, Magarete lays out another repast, which S√∂fren devours greedily despite having just come from the town dinner. While he is eating, Margarete asks S√∂fren if he has a fiancee. S√∂fren hesitates, then assures her that he does not. Margarete mentions that it is much too late for S√∂fren to head back to the inn and suggests he stay in an upstairs room. The next morning S√∂fren puts on a fine suit of clothes, far superior to his own garments, that was laid out by his bed during the night. S√∂fren goes downstairs. Margarete is sewing and the table has been set with a fine breakfast of herring, bread and butter, and a canister of schnapps. After S√∂fren finishes the schnapps, Margarete takes on the appearance of a smiling 20-year-old. Margarete asks if he would like to marry her; S√∂fren replies in the affirmative. Margarete calls in her two servants from the next room as witnesses of S√∂fren's proposal. Margarete assures S√∂fren they will have separate sleeping quarters and maintain separate lives. S√∂fren leaves to tell Mari what has happened, and Margarete follows at a distance. A tearful Mari asks S√∂fren how Margarete bewitched him and S√∂fren suggests she had hexed the herring. Margarete arrives and confronts S√∂fren‚Äîwho is this woman? S√∂fren replies that Mari is his sister and asks that she be allowed to stay in the parsonage, to which Margarete assents. S√∂fren and Margarete are married. The next morning, S√∂fren is upset when Margarete's female servant shakes debris from a rug on him from a balcony. Margarete's male servant gives S√∂fren a raspberry when asked to stop whistling. S√∂fren confronts Margarete: \\"In the future, I suggest you and your companions be less high and mighty. For I am master of this house.\\" Margarete goes to a window and taps on it to summon the bearish male servant. She instructs him: \\"Master S√∂fren is too big for his boots. Give him a drubbing!\\" Afterward, Margarete advises her husband: \\"I suggest you concentrate on prayer and sermons. Do not play master here. I am master of this house!\\" S√∂fren makes several unsuccessful attempts to have time alone with Mari. One day he notices Margarete climb the ladder to the loft of the barn. S√∂fren removes the ladder, hoping to trap Margarete in the loft, and goes in search of Mari. Mari, however, is also in the loft, and she starts to climb down without noticing that the ladder has been moved. Mari falls to the ground and S√∂fren rushes over and calls up a warning to Margarete: \\"Be careful, Dame Margarete! The ladder is gone!\\" S√∂fren carried Mari into the house and learns that she has broken a thigh bone and suffered a concussion but will recover. Margarete takes on the role of Mari's nurse and, in return, S√∂fren begins to grow fond of Margarete. One day, as Margarete and S√∂fren sit by Mari's bedside, Margarete confesses: \\"My first husband and I were engaged for many years when he applied for the post here and learned he could have it only if he wedded the parson's widow. We knew that the widow was weak and could scarcely live long. It was a sore temptation to us. God forgive us ... we built our happiness on the hope of another's death.\\" That prompted S√∂fren to confess: \\"Mari and I are not sister and brother -- she is my fiancee. We have also waited for your death, Dame Margarete.\\" Margarete appears to have initially been taken aback, then her face softens and she murmurs \\"Poor children!\\" From that moment, S√∂fren and Mari have no trouble spending time together and Margarete spends most of her time in the churchyard, visiting her husband's grave. One morning Margarete does not come down to breakfast. S√∂fren and Mari go to her bedroom, where they find her in a peaceful repose after dying in her sleep. S√∂fren finds a note beside the bed: \\"Do not forget, when my mortal remains are taken away, to put a horseshoe over the door and to strew linseed after me so that I shall not haunt you.\\" Margarete is buried beside her husband. As S√∂fren and Mari stand over her grave, S√∂fren remarks: \\"We owe her a great debt, Mari. She taught you to keep a good home and she taught me to be an honorable man.\\"  Cast  * Einar R√∂d as S√∂fren * Hildur Carlberg as Margarete Pedersdotter * Greta Almroth as Mari * Olav Aukrust as First Candidate * Emil Helsengreen as The Gardener * Mathilde Nielsen as Gunvor * Lorentz Thyholt as The Beadle * Kurt Welin as Second Candidate  Trivia  Both exterior and interior shots were filmed at the Garmo Stave Church and the Maihaugen museum.Robert Osborne, Turner Classic Movies  About the restoration  An acetate duplicate negative derived from an acetate master made from the now-lost camera negative was scanned by the Swedish Film Institute in 2018.

Leon (1904 - November 2, 1984) was an impresario, radio producer, conductor, musicologist, opera manager, referee, and businessman. He had a wide array of talents and interests which led him towards a highly diversified career in many fields from running and owning WDAS (AM) from 1950 to 1979, refereeing for polo sporting events, and owning and operating Whole-Sum Products, a candy factory, for more than four decades. He also was a highly accomplished musician, serving as the founder and conductor of the Philadelphia Pops Orchestra and working as the general manager of the Opera Company of Philadelphia. Biography Born in Poland to Jewish parents, Leon came to the United States at the age of 16. He began his career working for the Whole-Sum Products candy factory in Philadelphia in the 1920s during which time he also played a variety of instruments in \\"Max Leon and his Musical Eagles\\", a local dance band. Leon eventually became the general manager of Whole-Sum Products and later bought the company in 1934, which he kept going into the 1970s. He notably forged a partnership with Breyers Ice Cream, and the company invented their marshmallow ice cream flavor along with making other products for Breyers. Leon continued to be active with several amateur musical groups in Philadelphia during the 1930s. He eventually ended up studying conducting with Paul Breisach, a conductor at the Metropolitan Opera, Martin Rich at the Curtis Institute of Music, and Eugene Ormandy, famed director of the Philadelphia Orchestra. Leon financed and founded the Philadelphia Pops Orchestra in 1943 and became the principal conductor. The orchestra was made up of musicians primarily from the Philadelphia Orchestra.

Violence towards black activists during the Montgomery bus boycott led Miller to question commitments to nonviolence as noted by Martin Luther King, Jr. himself in letter sent April 1957. Life Miller was born in 1908 at Stevenston, Ayrshire, Scotland to parents Rev. Matthew & Mrs Leonora Miller. He was the eldest of three brothers. There he married his wife Jean C MacLaren and had a son, David. Education Miller received is Masters from Auckland University, and later went on to Columbia University in the U.S. where he received his doctorate. The conferral of the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity by the Pacific School of Religion in 1958 was recognition of his contributions, both personal and theological, to theological education. Career Lex Miller's career had three sides: The articulation of the Christian faith in the academic setting, the service of the Christian Church, both his own Presbyterian denomination and Protestant Christianity at large, and the bringing of Christianity to bear on the social, economic, and political spheres of secular life. Of these three ends, the last is a thread running throughout his life. In a day when passions ran high over pacifism, the labor movement, and unemployment, he accumulated an impressive jail record in New Zealand from picketing and pacifist demonstrations. He later went to Detroit in a liaison job between Christian students and industrial workers. It was there that he impressed Reinhold Niebuhr by his activities, and was recommended by Niebuhr as a Lecturer in Religion at Stanford University. He was the first Professor of Religion at Stanford and in 1950 inaugurated their Department of Religion and became its Head. University). His students were brought through an unusually wide gamut of theological subject-matter and an approach to a theology concerned with the real world. He delivered the William Belden Noble Lectures at Harvard in 1957, which were published as his 1958 book The Man in the Mirror. He wrote two books for Niebuhr‚Äôs ‚ÄòChristian Faith‚Äô series. In total, he authored 8 books. Ministry Ordained in the Presbyterian Church of New Zealand in 1937, he occupied pastorates there, in England, and in Scotland. While in London Docklands; the area was subjected to continuous bombing attacks and he saw his first Presbyterian Church charge destroyed by the bombing. He then became Assistant to the Rev George MacLeod in the Iona Community. From 1943 to 1945 he was associated with Sir George MacLeod in the Iona Community in Scotland. He served as Pastor in Napier, New Zealand from 1945-1948. While at Stanford he was a member of the Presbytery of San Jose of the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. He was much in demand as lecturer and preacher in churches and church groups of all denominations. His theology, rooted in the great Reformation traditions and enlivened by the work and personal influence of Reinhold Niebuhr, sought a responsible and intelligible articulation of the Biblical heritage. At his death, he was a member-at-large of the Central Committee of the National Student Christian Federation, a member of the Message Committee of the National Council of Churches, and a fellow of the National Council on Religion in Higher Education. Person Stanford University's 1960 Memorial Resolution reports that Lex Miller \\"retained a rare humility of spirits informed by a study faith and accompanied by a nonchalance about himself,\\" and they would \\"remember him as a colleague who combined wisdom with innocence, humor with piety, energetic support of academic freedom with unswerving devotion to Christian truth. His own life bore eloquent testimony to a quotation from Karl Barth, which he used as a motto for his Noble Lectures: 'Man is the creature made visible in the mirror of Jesus Christ.' \\"Lex was not a pliable personality. He held tenaciously to whatever aspects of truth (that) gripped him. He ventured his whole existence on what he believed; and, because he was sometimes intellectually mistaken, ... he occasionally stumbled. But he never altered his convinced conduct just because the results hurt himself.\\" These reports on the quality his character were attested to by all those who knew him, including the well known Dr. Gene Scott, who was a student of his at Stanford in the mid-1950s.

Plot  A high school student, Han Joon-soo (Jang Keun-suk), is a troublemaker. He always quarrels with his parents and does not obey them. One day his parents are sick of his bad behavior and run away from home, leaving only a videotape and $100, stating they would come back when Joon-soo got his act together. Shrugging it off, he decides to just throw a small party with his friends, Ki-seok (Ko Gyoo-pil) and Choon-seung (Choi Jae-hwan), in his empty house. While buying alcohol at a grocery store, a baby with a note is left in his cart. The note claims the high school senior, Han Joon-soo, is the father of the baby and the mother could not take care of him anymore. The baby‚Äôs name is revealed to be Han Woo-ram (Moon Mason). Joon-soo finds himself stuck with the child, he tries abandoning Woo-ram multiple times, but always fails. Without anyone to help him, other than Kim Byul (Song Ha-yoon), a smart girl who has a crush on him, Joon-soo resorts to bringing the baby to school and his part-time jobs. Finally, he is suspended from school due to the baby being a disturbance. After days of becoming financially broke and sinking to the bottom, his parents come back home when Joon-soo has an emotional breakdown and expresses his sympathy and love for the baby; a love that changed him from troublemaker to a caring father. Joon-soo's parents acknowledge their love for their son and tell Joon-soo that they will help take care of Woo-ram. When Woo-ram is admitted to the hospital, Joon-soo becomes depressed and meets up Ki-seok. Ki-seok tells Joon-soo that he himself is the father of Woo-ram. Furious, Joon-soo beats up Ki-seok and tells him to take Woo-ram back. He later lies to Byul and Choon-seung that he does not care about Woo-ram anymore. Woo-ram, now out of the hospital, is being adopted by a couple from overseas. After contemplating, Joon-soo races to the airport and fights his way through security. At the gate, he yells for the couple to give Woo-ram back to him. Later, Joon-soon agrees with Ki-Seok that they will raise Woo-ram together. Byul sends Ki-seok and Choon-seung to go buy some soda, wanting to be alone with Joon-soo. After she coyly compliments his \\"cool\\" behavior at the airport, Byul gives Joon-soo a quick kiss before running off.  Release  Baby and I was released in August 10, 2008. The film was directed by Kim Jin-young. The film had an attendance of 435,551 nationwide.http://www.koreanfilm.org/films2008.html#boxoffice  Difference with the manga  Baby and I is loosely based on the manga. Although the situation is somewhat similar, the film's main character is a troublemaking high school student while the main character in the manga Baby and Me is a model student. In addition to the theme, Han Joon-soo has a problem with his parents and has a baby; in contrast, Takuya Enoki has the ideal family but is taking care of his younger brother in the place of his deceased mother.

Massie also served in World War I as an officer in the Australian Imperial Force, seeing action at Gallipoli and on the Western Front in France. Injuries sustained in the war ended his cricket career, but he had a successful business career, principally with British American Tobacco. Early sporting achievements Massie was a gifted sportsman, representing New South Wales at numerous sports. As a rugby union footballer he played in the position of second-rower for Sydney University while studying Civil Engineering and represented New South Wales four times. He was picked in the Australian rugby squad to tour New Zealand in 1913 but had to withdraw due to study commitments. In 1913 he won the NSW Amateur Boxing Heavy Weight Championship and the following year was state champion in the 120-yard hurdles. He also excelled at rifle-shooting and rowing. First- class cricketer A tall left-arm fast bowler, Massie came close to playing Test cricket in 1914 when he was named in the squad to tour South Africa but the series did not go ahead. He had been playing regular first-class cricket for just two seasons but had proved to be a handful for Australian batsmen, taking 59 wickets at 18.66 in the 1912‚Äì13 summer and then 37 wickets at 16.32 in 1913‚Äì14. Massie's best performance in a match came in a Sheffield Shield encounter in 1912/13, with New South Wales taking on Victoria. His second innings figures of 7 for 110 gave him 11 wickets for the match and included the scalps of Warwick Armstrong and Jack Ryder. He was generally an ineffective batsman but did manage a half century against Western Australia in 1912 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. New South Wales declared their second innings at 8/375 once he reached the milestone and went on to win the match. World War I campaign Massie, who enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 17 August 1914, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 4th Battalion on 14 September, served with distinction during the war. His battalion embarked for Egypt in October, and he was promoted lieutenant on 1 February 1915. He took part in Australia's campaign at Gallipoli and in just his second day in the conflict was fortunate to survive a suicidal advance towards the Turkish lines, resulting from orders that were misunderstood by his battalion, when his commanding officer was killed, Massie tried to recover his body. While fighting at Gallipoli he wore a scarlet rag on his right arm so that if he was shot by the Turkish marksmen it would likely be to the arm that stood out and not his left arm which he used for bowling. Massie received slight wounds on 25 June, and 20 July, he was seriously injured on the night of 6‚Äì7 August 1915, during the Battle of Lone Pine by shrapnel. The cricketer had been sent by a junior officer to investigate an outpost which was under fire, and was struck by an exploding shell. The shrapnel lodged into the back of his left shoulder and he also suffered a punctured lung and broken ribs. The injury was serious enough for him to be repatriated to Australia, he was promoted to captain during the journey, on 1 December. Massie was Mentioned in Despatches on 28 January 1916 for his service in the Dardanelles, and awarded the French Croix de Guerre. He was promoted major on 1 May, and appointed second in command of the newly raised 33rd Battalion, which he had previously been involved in training. The battalion departed Sydney on the transport Marathon on 4 May, and arrived at Devonport on 9 July. The battalion was sent to France with the 3rd Division on 21 November. Massie was Mentioned in Despatches a second time on 1 June 1917, for his actions prior to 9 April 1917. He was attached to the divisional HQ during May and June 1917. On a brief period of leave in England in August, and despite his previous injuries, he played in a cricket match at Lord's on a combined Australian and South African services side against a combined British Army and Navy side. The \\"Colonials\\" (as a report in The Times referred to them) won convincingly, with Massie taking 2/31. From October to December he was a student on a higher command course. Returning to France, he was again severely wounded on 3 February 1918, a training exercise behind the lines being interrupted by a solitary German bomb, the resulting shrapnel badly damaging his right foot. He received a further Mention in Despatches for his actions prior to 7 April 1918, this was gazetted on 28 May 1918, and he then received the Distinguished Service Order on 3 June 1918. After Massie's initial recuperation he trained with the Machine Gun Corps at Grantham, passing the tests to command a machine gun battalion. He was attached to the Australian Corps School on 12 September, appointed commandant on 24 September, and promoted to lieutenant colonel on 21 October. He was demobilised on 16 August 1919. His combined injuries meant he never played competitive cricket again. Business career Before the war Massie had been employed by British American Tobacco and returned to work with them in 1919. During the 1930s and 1940s he was Chairman of Directors for British American Tobacco's operations in Australia and also at W.D. & H.O. Wills while also serving as Director of the Commercial Banking Company. He also worked at the Ministry of Munitions to help out in World War II. From 1946 to 1951 he served as the Deputy Chairman of the British American Tobacco in London before retiring. Personal life Massie's father Hugh had also been a cricketer and appeared in nine Tests for Australia in the 1880s. Massie's grandfather, on his mother's side, Thomas Allwright Dibbs, was an eminent banker in Sydney. Massie married Phyllis Wood Lang at Holy Trinity Brompton, London, on 3 June 1919. They had a son named John who was killed in action during World War II; Phyllis died soon after. On 20 September 1947, Massie married a widow, Elizabeth Emily Squire (n√©e Crosse) in Washington DC. He died on 14 February 1966, at the age of 75, from cancer.

He received little formal schooling prior to being a teenager. When he was thirteen Munroe worked as a farmhand for a while at his grandparents' farm in Roxbury. Though he liked farming, he figured that there had to be a better way to make a living and desired to learn a skilled trade. At fourteen he became a wheelwright‚Äôs assistant. After working at this for a while he quit and briefly became a cabinet-maker‚Äôs assistant. He then worked at various day labor jobs through the age of sixteen. When he was seventeen he became employed with his second cousin deacon Nehemiah Munroe, a cabinet-maker in downtown Roxbury. He was exceptionally sharp at this trade, able to follow the written diagrams of the various pieces of furniture to make them precisely. He had his own innovative ideas and even devised a new method of hanging table leaves from their hinges, drawing a new concept that was followed thereafter.Monroe Jr., p. 148 Munroe became a journeyman in the shop for about six months after becoming twenty one years old, completing his apprenticeship. In 1800 he left and went to Concord, Massachusetts. There he worked for his older brothers, Daniel and Nathaniel, who were clockmakers. He passed his time by making clock cases. The brothers wrote in Munroe on a contract as a full partner in their business from 1801 though 1804. Monument Square and the Mill-Dam Company at Concord, Massachusetts Mid life In 1805 Munroe married Patty, daughter of Captain John Stone. Patty's family was wealthy and her father had died before they were married. They immediately took up residence in a part of the brick house that was Patty's mother's. In 1806 their first child was born, William Jr. Two years later they moved to a part of the building where the shop was where he was working as a clockcase- maker. Munroe also made some furniture, besides clockcases, which he took to Boston to sell. In 1810 he traded some clocks in Norfolk for some corn and flour. He traded the flour to a Mr. Prescott, a baker in Concord, in a round about way for a shop at the Concord Mill-Dam Company that Mr. Prescott owned. There was a credit crunch in the economy at this time and Mr. Prescott didn't have cash to pay for the flour.Monroe Jr., p. 149 In 1810, he made a voyage to Norfolk, Va., with clocks taken in payment for the cases which he had made. He sold his clocks, invested the proceeds in corn and flour, and came back with them in mid-winter, barely escaping shipwreck on the voyage. He sold most of the flour to Abel Prescott, a baker of Concord. Instead of the cash, which he could not collect of Prescott, round-about trade was made, by which he obtained the shop on the Mill-Dam, which he for several years owned and occupied. In 1811 Munroe moved his family to a small house closer to his shop. The War of 1812 with England began about this time. There were many embargo laws then enforced and basically little trading with Europe in general.Munroe, Richard, p. 104 His cabinet-making business was all but rubbed out as the New England economy was in a recession at the time.Monroe Jr., p. 149 Munroe said, In this I continued about a year, when, finding that I could make with my own hands more furniture than I could sell, business of every kind being dull, and my family expenses increasing, I found that, unless I could make money faster, I should in a few years at the most, even if I should have my health, be poor. It turned out little importation of European products came to America because of the war. There was a sharp incentive to make items in New England that were normally made in Europe. Many products were scarce and much rewarded for those that could produce them in America. Munroe figured there had to be a way to exploit this concept so thought of some ideas of things he could make. Being practical he first produced cabinetmaker's squares since he already had skills in this area and it would be easy for him to make these. He did his level best selling them at a fair price, however competition eventually made his business decline. He then noticed the scarcity of imported pencils and the high price that people paid for them.Monroe Jr., p. 150 Munroe figured that making these for people was a financial opportunity. He learned of earlier users that were successful in selling them, like Benjamin Franklin who promoted pencils in the Pennsylvania Gazette in 1729. It is not known for sure if Munroe was inspired by Franklin's expression Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing, however he did point out, William Munroe manufactured the first American lead pencils in 1812 Straight away Munroe obtained a few lumps of black graphite which he beat to a pulp with a hammer. He separated the fine particles that floated to the top of the water with a spoon and mixed them with a clay solution. His first experiments with this lead solution was not very successful. He continued making cabinet maker's squares and sold the few of these which he could. In this time he continued experimenting with graphite lead for pencils with little accomplishment. He had no knowledge of the subject and feared consulting others as they might take the idea and produce pencils themselves. Munroe continued experimenting in secret with graphite powder formulas on his own. Eventually he figured a way to come up with a suitable graphite paste formula of various ingredients that could be poured into a slotted line made in some cedar wood blanks. The pencil centers would be his secret formula of a mixture of dried graphite paste of clay and other unknown ingredients. They were air dried and not hardened by firing in a furnace as Europeans did, so the quality was not as good as theirs‚Äîbut it was fine enough to write with. On July 2, 1812, he had produced about thirty pencils and sold them to a Benjamin Andrews, a hardware dealer on Union Street in downtown Boston.Lane, pp. 33-35 These were the first wooden-cased graphite lead pencils manufactured in the United States.Munroe Jr., p. 150 But finally, securing some better lead, and picking up a little cedar wood of wholly unsuitable quality from the neighboring hills, he was able, on the second day of July, 1812, to proceed to Boston with a modest sample of about thirty lead pencils, the first American make, and naturally not of very good quality.Petroski, p. 98 Until the war with England cut off imports, pencils used in America came from overseas. William Monroe, a cabinetmaker in Concord, Massachusetts, made the first American wood pencils in 1812.Hudson, p. 468 William, b. Dec 17, 1778. He was the first, and for many years the only maker of lead pencils in America. Andrews was a previous customer of Munroe's, to whom he had sold cabinetmaker's squares. He ordered more immediately, which Munroe proceeded to grind out. Munroe showed up at Andrew's hardware store with over four hundred pencils less than two weeks later. Andrews then wrote up a contract with Munroe to take for a price all the pencils that he could make in a certain time frame. Munroe had then made a business out of making lead pencils. He made the graphite formula for his pencils in secret, with only the help of his wife. The business was quite successful. By 1814 he had made nearly 175,000 pencils, which sold for about six thousand dollars, a very large amount of money at the time. When the war with England ended there were better pencils available from Europe and his profits were erased by these better imports. Munroe figured it was pointless to try to compete against these superior products so took up his normal trade of cabinet-making. He also made tooth brushes and watchmaker's brushes, also the first made in the United States.Scientific American supplement, January 4, 1879, History of the American lead pencil manufacture During this interim time he went back to the drawing board to do further experimenting with his secret lead pencil paste. One thing led to another until he came up with a powdered graphite paste product that would make its mark. Munroe decided in 1819 he would go into pencil manufacturing full-time. He no longer desired to be number two. He made a square deal with his employees then to sell them his furniture business. He contracted with them to make his cabinet maker's squares and pencil blanks for payment of the shop business. Munroe in turn then produced the unique graphite paste for his pencils, of which only he and his wife knew the secret formula. He rented an old textile factory building and there fabricated pencils on a large scale. In 1835 alone he made over 5 million pencils. He took the lead out to become the best manufacturer of American pencils.Monroe Jr., p. 151 Munroe figured that the best way to make pencils was by starting with a quarter inch slab of cedar wood. He then would cut the slots for his special formula graphite paste and fill them. He would let the paste air dry. The next step was to glue an eighth inch veneer of wood over the slots. The final step was to saw the slab into pencils. This resulted in a wooden lead graphite pencil that was just under a half inch thick.Brondfield, p. 31 The business was a struggle at first, however in ten years' time he had sharpened his skills to perfection. He figured out how to make his machinery fabricate the wooden pencils efficiently in the old textile factory, creating the first and the most successful pencil company in the United States.Monroe Jr., p. 152 Munroe took the lead in manufacturing pencils in the United States from that time forward as long as he was in the pencil business. He also make ever- pointed-pencil leads that were very popular. There were others in Massachusetts that would follow his lead, including one of his former employees, Ebenezer Wood, who would invent the first pencil-making machinery. Some of his competitors that contemplated competing against him were Henry David Thoreau and the Thoreau family. Another competitor to be pointed out that made pens was Benjamin Ball while Joseph Dixon also made pencils and pens. Munroe led the pencil industry in the United States into the 1840s. It should be pointed out that some were not on the level and illegally copied Munroe's techniques of pencil making. They counterfeited his stamps and labels. At least two were found guilty in Massachusetts. Another merchant in New York imported German-made pencils with \\"W. Munroe\\" printed on them to be sold as an illegal knock-off product. Those pencils were confiscated and destroyed with a fine of five hundred dollars.Scientific American supplement, January 4, 1879 History of the American lead pencil manufacture Munroe's son Francis apprenticed as a pencil manufacturer and maker under the training of his father. In 1848 the entire \\"William Munroe Pencil Company\\" was given to him. By 1854 the business no longer penciled out for Francis so he wrote it off.

The parish includes the villages of Cadbury Heath and Longwell Green, and part of Willsbridge. It does not include Oldland Common, which is in the parish of Bitton.  History  Oldland was mentioned in the Domesday Book as Aldeland, the Saxon name for \\"old tract of land\\". Before the Norman Invasion of England, the overlord of Oldland was King Harold Godwinson, who had appointed Alwy as Lord of the area. After the conquest, King William I of England confiscated the land of Oldland and gave it to the Bishop of Exeter as tenant-in-chief. Oldland consisted of six houses with two plough teams. Oldland went through several variations of its name throughout history. Some of the names were Holande, Wholdland, Wooland during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, Ouldland after the Restoration of the Monarchy and Eland.  Church  Oldland had a chapel constructed in 1280. The chapel served the village as a part of the parish of Bitton with clergymen alternating services fortnightly between Oldland chapel and Hanham after performing services in the morning at Bitton's parish church. The churchyard contained a large yew tree which had been growing since the Tudor period. It remained standing until 2020 when it was blown down by a storm in 2020. In 1827, the medieval chapel was demolished following Oldland being made its own parish. The newly constructed St Annes Church was consecrated by the Bishop of Lichfield and the Bishop of Gloucester. In 1981, it was granted grade II listed building status by English Heritage. The church's vicarage and gateway were each granted separate grade II listings.

Of particular note, TPO was the first work published by Wizards of the Coast and its president, Peter Adkison. Through TPO, Wizards of the Coast introduced the \\"Capsystem\\" concept, enabling gamemasters to seamlessly integrate TPO and future Capsystem titles into other role-playing games. The supplement covers high-powered gaming and the gods. TPO provides guidelines for gamemasters to develop individual gods of various power levels, to include entire pantheons, as well as the vast support network, both divine and mortal, required to maintain and increase godly status. These guidelines stem from the foundational concept of primal energy, its sources and impact, as well as its resource management. As part of the sale of Wizards of the Coast to Hasbro in 2001, Adkison retained the rights to The Primal Order, his own original work. Published supplements Wizards quickly followed up the release of TPO with several supplements to help build on the system's foundation. These supplements included: * Pawns, The Opening Move. Written by Nigel Findley, TPO's first supplement serves as a bestiary created with the TPO ruleset in mind. It was published in 1992. * Knights, Strategies in Motion. Written by Nigel Findley, this supplement details three fictional deities and their approaches to building their respective religions based on the TPO ruleset. It was published in 1993. * Chessboards, The Planes of Possibility. Written by Dave Howell, this supplement details planar design and management with respect to TPO ruleset. It was published in 1993. The first copies went on sale at GenCon 1993, but its release was overshadowed by another new product: Magic, the Gathering. Controversy One of the driving forces behind the Capsystem concept was to provide gamemasters of various systems with conversion notes to port TPO into their respective games. As such, Wizards solicited conversions for various systems, and included the following conversions with TPO: * Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (both 1st and 2nd edition) * Arduin Grimoire * Ars Magica * Chivalry & Sorcery * Dungeons & Dragons * GURPS * H√¢rnMaster * Hero System * Palladium Fantasy Role-Playing Game * Pendragon RPG * RoleMaster * RuneQuest * Shadowrun * Synnibarr * Talislanta * Torg * Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay * WarpWorld Kevin Siembieda, the owner of Palladium Books and Palladium FRPG copyright holder, sued Wizards for copyright infringement. The parties settled the suit out of court, and Wizards released a revised edition of TPO that excluded Palladium. The revised edition also excluded AD&D;, D&D; and WarpWorld. However, Adkison took advantage of the revision to include these games: * Castle Falkenstein * CORPS * Earthdawn * Kult * Tri Tac Games * World of Darkness games The expanded coverage increased TPO's page count from 232 to 250 pages. It also included new cover art. Planned supplements Wizards initially planned several supplements, of which two are known: * Bishops, The Eternal Crusade. This TPO supplement, to be written by Loren Miller, was to focus on \\"Earthly\\" churches using the TPO ruleset. It was never completed, nor are there any notes or references available. * Rivals of Estedil. Written by Jonathan Tweet, this was an adventure using the TPO ruleset. It was never completed, although Mr Tweet compiled copious notes and an outline. In addition, the following Capsystem works are mentioned in the Legal Stuff section of both the original and revised editions: * The Military Order * The Economic Order * The Governmental Order * The Underworld Order Yet, with the dramatic success of Magic: The Gathering, coupled with previous legal issues regarding their Capsystem approach, Wizards focused almost entirely on collectible card games and did not release any further Capsystem books. Other conversions Although TPO received no further official support beyond the 1995 revised edition, several folks have put forth other game system conversions for the system, to include: * GURPS 4th Edition * Mythus * Unisystem Reception Loyd Blankenship reviewed The Primal Order in Pyramid #1 (May/June, 1993), and stated that \\"TPO is probably the single most useful book a GM can buy regarding the proper and effective use of gods and religion in a campaign.\\" TPO received very good reviews from various sources, including RPGNet.

He is a skillful and bold opening batsman, who loves to face the first ball. He is strong off his legs and through the covers and his favourite shot is the pull shot. School times He was born and lives in Kenya but has British nationality. Since Kenya is only an associate member of the ICC, Waters is also eligible to play for England. He was educated at Cranleigh School, England and captained the first XI cricket side for two years, playing alongside Stuart Meaker. In his last season at Cranleigh School, he finished with almost 900 runs. He is a very able leg spinner and in his last season at Cranleigh School was second highest wicket taker. Domestic career He scored a double century on debut for Surrey Under-17s in 2006, and in 2008 he made his Surrey second XI debut. International career In October 2008 he was called into the Kenyan Cricket team, and made an immediate impression, scoring 75 against Ireland in the Intercontinental Cup at the Gymkhana in Nairobi, and more recently 74 against South Africa at Kimberley in a full One Day International (ODI). Waters is also a very apt fielder and took two astonishing catches in the second ODI against South Africa, that belied his age and experience, to send Gibbs and then de Villiers back to the pavilion.

History  470 engines of this type were procured between 1903 and 1910 for duties on the Berlin Stadtbahn. Like the superheated locomotive, the Prussian T 12, the T 11 evolved from the T 9.3 in order to replace the older, four-coupled tank engines. Construction of the T 11 was ceased in 1910 in favour of the more economical T 12. In 1923, 16 engines were fitted with a superheater, but they retained their existing running numbers. In 1925, the Deutsche Reichsbahn took over the 358 remaining locomotives as DRG Class 74.0‚Äì3, allocating them the numbers 74 001‚Äì358. The locomotives were employed together with the T 12s especially on the Berlin Stadtbahn until its electrification in 1926‚Äì1933; as a result they had direction plates (Richtungsschilder) on their smokebox and coal tanks. But they were also used in suburban services for other cities such as Frankfurt, Hamburg and Altona. At the end of World War II there were still 120 examples of these engines in service, 65 with the Deutsche Bundesbahn and 55 with the Deutsche Reichsbahn (GDR) in East Germany. The majority of T 11s were retired by 1960; but two engines (74 231 und 74 240) continued to work the Erfurt industrial railway until 1974. Two locomotives have been preserved: 74 104 and 74 231\\\\. The former was left in Poland after the Second World War where this class was designated as PKP Class OKi1. The second was restored in 1998/99 in the Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works for the Minden Museum Railway and has been working since 2000. It is the former Hannover 7512.  Design  All four axles of the locomotives ‚Äì even the carrying axles ‚Äì were more or less equally loaded with a hefty 16 tonnes. The carrying axle was linked to the first coupled axle via a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie. The axles were located in a plate frame, inside which a well tank was rivetted. The first units had piston valves, the later ones slide valves. The riveted boiler barrel comprised two boiler shells and the smokebox was also rivetted. At the back of the boiler was the copper firebox. Two vacuum Dampfstrahlpumpen served as feed pumps. For the brakes, there was, next to the smokebox a single-stage air pump, and in front of the carrying axle were one or two air reservoirs.  T 11 of the L√ºbeck-B√ºchen Railway  The L√ºbeck-B√ºchen Railway also placed nine T 11s in service between 1906 and 1908. The four engines taken over by Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1938, with numbers 74 361 to 74 364, were however not the Prussian T 11 - that had already been retired or sold off by then \\\\- but the LBE's own special designs (LBE T10) based that were more like the Prussian T 9.3 and which had been built in 1911/1912 by Linke-Hofmann in a batch of five. The drive resembled that of the T 11, apart from the smaller coupled wheels with a 1,400 mm diameter, whilst the boiler was smaller too. The last of these engines was not retired until 1951.

While containing many of the elements of the Ordinary Form of the Mass of the Roman Rite, it incorporates elements from sub-Saharan African culture, particularly Congolese, a process referred to as inculturation. Additionally, the Zaire Use may refer to the adjusted sacramental rites utilized by the Congolese dioceses. The Zaire Use form of the Mass is unrelated to the earlier defunct African Rite. It is largely a product of the Second Vatican Council's constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium, particularly the move \\"for legitimate variations and adaptations to different groups, regions, and peoples, especially in mission lands, provided that the substantial unity of the Roman rite is preserved.\\" Promulgated by the decree Zairensium Dioecesium on April 30, 1988, by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Missel romain pour les dioc√®ses du Za√Øre (Roman Missal for the Dioceses of Zaire) is an attempt to inculturate the Roman Missal in an African context, inspired by the liturgical reform initiated at the Second Vatican Council.New Catholic Encyclopedia 2003. The Gale Group Inc. The missal is now officially entitled Congolese Missal for the dioceses of Zaire. History It follows the 1956 Masses of the Savanes in Upper Volta and of the Piroguieres and the 1958 Missa Luba in Zaire. Following the 1970 authorization from the Congregation for the Divine Worship and the 1973 draft presentation of a new Order of the Mass from the Commission on Evangelization, the Episcopal Conference in Zaire approved its use experimentally. As the \\"Zairean Rite,\\" it was adopted formally in 1985. On 1 December 2019, Pope Francis celebrated Mass for the first Sunday of Advent in Saint Peter's Basilica using this rite to mark the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the first chaplaincy for the Congolese Catholic community in Rome. Differences from the Ordinary Form =Liturgical calendar= Under pressure from Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko to remove Western influences as part of broader cultural reforms, a 1975 synod of the Congolese Episcopal Conference chose to not celebrate various feasts venerating saints when they fall during the week, moving their celebration to the nearest Sunday. This choice was approved by the Holy See. Similar pressures from the Seko government inspired a revision of the practice of baptismal names, with some families selecting traditionally native African names for common use and baptismal names such as \\"Gr√¢ce √† Dieu\\" and \\"Gloire √† Dieu.\\" =Adjustment of the liturgy= Distinct from the Ordinary Form, the congregation stands in the presence of Christ‚Äìrather than kneeling‚Äìand there is an \\"invocation of the Ancestors of upright heart\\" (\\"invocation anc√™tres au coeur droit\\") in addition to the invocation of the saints. The intention of the latter act is the veneration of only \\"ancestors\\" \\"who have lived in an exemplary way.\\" The Penitential Act is performed following the homily or the recitation of the Creed. One state intention for this placement is that only after listening to scripture that the congregation is able to seek forgiveness. Servers are permitted to dance around the altar as a form of veneration. Dancing is also permitted for the bringing gifts to those in need. Priests dress in traditional African priestly vestments. =Participation of the laity= The Zaire Use was created with intention to better incorporate the congregation into the celebration of the Mass. To do this, responses were added, including one at the conclusion of the homily and Eucharistic prayer. Additionally, the congregation is explicitly welcomed to raise their hands for the Lord's Prayer, a practice variously allowed or prohibited by episcopal conferences utilizing the Ordinary Form. Due to awareness of culturally normative displays of respect and attentiveness in the Congo, the congregation sits for the reading of the Gospel. An announcer also calls the congregation to attention at points in the liturgy. Dancing among the congregants is permitted.

The book was made into a television series entitled Longitude. In 1998, The Illustrated Longitude was published, supplementing the earlier text with 180 images of characters, events, instruments, maps and publications. Problem of longitude Determining longitude on land was fairly easy compared to the task at sea. A stable surface to work from, known coordinates to refer to, a sheltered environment for the unstable chronometers of the day, and the ability to repeat determinations over time made for great accuracy. For calculating longitude at sea however, early ocean navigators had to rely on dead reckoning, or if in sight of land, coastal navigation, which involves triangulating several bearings of the same land feature from different positions. Once out of sight of land, longitude became impossible to calculate, which sometimes led to tragedies in stormy or foggy conditions. In order to deal with not being able to calculate longitude, captains would sail to the known latitude of their destination, and follow the line of constant latitude home. This was known as running down a westing if westbound, or easting if eastbound. Dutton's Navigation and Piloting, 12th edition. G.D. Dunlap and H.H. Shufeldt, eds. Naval Institute Press 1972, In Farley Mowat's book Westviking, he gives examples from the Norse Sagas of Vikings using this practice to hop reliably from Norway to the Faroes, then Iceland, then Greenland, then North America, and then back to Ireland, with very primitive instruments. Determining latitude was relatively easy in that it could be found from the altitude of the sun at noon with the aid of a table giving the sun's declination for the day. Latitude can also be determined from night sightings of Polaris, the northern pole star. However, since Polaris is not precisely at the pole, it can only provide accurate information if the precise time is known or many measurements are made over time, which made developing an accurate chronometer for long ocean voyages even more vital. Navigating purely by latitude was of course vulnerable if the sun was clouded over at noon, and caused problems as it prevented ships from taking the most direct route, a great circle, or a route with the most favourable winds and currents, extending voyages by days or even weeks. This increased the likelihood of short rations,As food stores ran low, the crew would be put on rations to extend the time with food. This was referred to as giving the crew short rations, short allowance or petty warrant. scurvy or starvation leading to poor health or even death for members of the crew and resultant risk to the ship. Errors in navigation also resulted in shipwrecks. Motivated by a number of maritime disasters attributable to serious errors in reckoning position at sea, particularly spectacular disasters such as the Scilly naval disaster of 1707 which took Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell and four ships of his fleet, the British government established the Board of Longitude in 1714. The prizes were to be awarded to the first person to demonstrate a practical method for determining the longitude of a ship at sea. Each prize, in increasing amounts, was for solutions of increasing accuracy. These prizes, worth millions of dollars in today's currency, motivated many to search for a solution. Britain was not alone in the desire to solve the problem. France's King Louis XIV founded the Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences in 1666. It was charged with, among a range of scientific activities, the improvement of maps and sailing charts and advancement of the science of navigation. From 1715, the Acad√©mie offered one of the two Prix Rouill√©s specifically for navigation.Taylor, E.G.R., The Haven-finding Art: A History of Navigation from Odysseus to Captain Cook, Hollis & Carter, London 1971, Spain's Philip II offered a prize for the discovery of a solution to the problem of the longitude in 1567; Philip III increased the prize in 1598. Holland added to the effort with a prize offered in 1636.Longitude and the Acad√©mie Royale Navigators and scientists in most European countries were aware of the problem and were involved in finding the solution. Due to the international effort in solving the problem and the scale of the enterprise, it represents one of the largest scientific endeavours in history. Knowing longitude A blue plaque marks the location at Red Lion Square (the original house was demolished) where Harrison lived and died. As Dava Sobel explains, \\"To know one's longitude at sea, one needs to know what time it is aboard ship and also the time at the home port or another place of known longitude‚Äîat that very same moment. The two clock times enable the navigator to convert the hour difference into geographical separation. Since the earth takes 24 hours to revolve 360 degrees, one hour marks 1/24 of a revolution or 15 degrees. And so each hour's time difference between the ship and starting point marks a progress of fifteen degrees of longitude to the east or west. \\"Every day at sea, when the navigator resets his ship's clock to local noon when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky, and then consults the home port clock, every hour's discrepancy between them translates into another fifteen degrees of longitude. One degree of longitude equals four minutes of time the world over, although in terms of distance, one degree shrinks from 60.15 nautical miles or 111 km [Earth's circumference being 21,653.521 nautical miles, or 24,901.55 statute miles at the Equator], to virtually nothing at the poles. \\"Precise knowledge of the hour in two different places at once‚Äîa longitude prerequisite so easily accessible today from any pair of cheap wristwatches‚Äîwas utterly unattainable up to and including the era of pendulum clocks. On the deck of a rolling ship such clocks would slow down, or speed up, or stop running altogether. Normal changes of temperature encountered en route from a cold country of origin to a tropical trade zone thinned or thickened a clock's lubricating oil and made its metal parts expand or contract with equally disastrous results. A rise or fall in barometer pressure, or the subtle variations in the Earth's gravity from one latitude to another, could also cause a clock to gain or lose time.\\"http://www.sailtexas.com/long.html Harrison's final triumph - the compact chronometer Before the 18th century, ocean navigators could not find an accurate way of determining longitude. A practical solution came from a gifted carpenter, John Harrison, who solved one of the most difficult problems of his time by creating an accurate chronometer. The best scientists of the time, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought it impossible.

This was believed to be resulting from the fact that Ziping had lived most of his life with China under imperialist pressure from major European powers. Some accounts say he was forced into exile from his home after the end of the Boxer Rebellion and suppression of the Boxers, and became a student of Yang Hongxiu,http://higher-criticism.com/2005/12/wang-ziping- muslim-patriot-in-china.html from whom he learned the art of Chaquan. Wang won fights against Russian, American, German, and Japanese martial artists. Wang defeated a German officer's challenge in a weight lifting contest at Jiaoji. When the Germans wanted to take the antique doors of the Qinzhou mosque for themselves, Wang Zi-ping guarded the doors so the Germans challenged him to another weight lifting contest. When Wang triumphed over their challenge, the Germans left. Wang defeated a Russian who was rampaging around a public park located in Beijing after he boasted that he was the strongest fighter in the world in 1919. During a fight, Wang threw Japanese colonial military policemen down the stairs, one by one after they attacked him in Qingdao.http://m.zwbk.org/lemma/457905http://www.china.com.cn/guoqing/2016-01/27/content_37676554_6.htmhttp://culture.163.com/06/0222/13/2AIPRMAB00281MU3.htmlhttp://m.qulishi.com/news/201507/34764_5.htmlhttp://www.themcmashclan.com/rw/17076.htmlhttp://www.wanhuajing.com/d293423http://lsw1230795.mysinablog.com/index.php?op=ViewArticle&articleId;=1373653http://www.xhgmw.org/html/gonghewenhua/tiyu/2014/0716/9152.htmlhttp://ent.ifeng.com/movie/special/grandmasters/content-6/detail_2012_12/27/20590814_9.shtmlhttp://www.miercn.com/201506/thread_474497_1_2.htmlhttp://www.chinesekungfu.com.cn/html/1407/55c23bfb-85c6-42ac-b5bb-f59fc4096df6.htmhttp://www.timetw.com/4976.htmlhttp://www.rocidea.com/roc-34012.aspxhttp://iask.sina.com.cn/b/7721049.htmlhttp://zhidao.baidu.com/question/585452378.html Wang and Zhu Guofu defended martial arts historian Tang Hao (Tang Fansheng) from opponents who were angered by his work \\"Shaolin-Wudang Kao\\" which refuted the story of Bodhidharma and Zhang Sanfeng as being the creators of Shaolin and Taijiquan.

Kessler ‚Äì along with brother Boeli and cousins Tonny and D√© ‚Äì played club football for amateur side HVV Den Haag. Kessler also won three caps for the Dutch national side between 1905 and 1906. Family Background Kessler was born in a very wealthy family from The Hague, the oldest son of six children. His father Jean Baptiste August Kessler (1853‚Äì1900) was the first director of the Koninklijke Maatschappij tot exploitatie van Petroleumbronnen in Nederlandsch-Indi√´ (K.N.M.E.P.) (Royal Dutch Society for the exploitation of Petroleumsources in the Dutch East- Indies), which would eventually turn into the Koninklijke Nederlandse Petroleum Maatschappij (Royal Dutch Petroleum Company), now named Royal Dutch Shell. Football career Kessler in Dutch national team (1905) Dolf made his debut as a football player at seventeen years of age, at the Hague football club HVV. At first he stood leftback, later he was a right winger. At HVV he became national champion four times between 1901 and 1905. On 30 April 1905 he was captain during the first official international match of the Dutch national team. They beat Belgium with a 4‚Äì1 score. The second interland and first home match also saw Kessler leading the team. For his third and last interland in 1906 Dolf had passed the captaincy on to Kees Bekker. Kessler seriously considered a career in football until later that year he dislocated his knee, ending his career in football. Sports, however, remained important to him. Business career In 1907 Kessler graduated from the Technische Hogeschool Delft (Delft University of Technology), as a mechanical engineer. He got a job as secretary for Henri Deterding, who had succeeded Dolf's father as the director of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company. He worked for the company until 1915, when he left to look for a different job. As Joost Jonker and Jan Luiten van Zanden write in A History of the Royal Dutch Shell, his fianc√©e, Elizabeth \\"Bep\\" Stoop (herself a daughter of a prominent oil explorer, Adriaan Stoop), \\"put his love for her to the test by asking him to choose between her and the Group.\\" His younger brother Jean Baptiste August \\"Guus\\" Kessler Jr., who had married Bep's cousin, Anna Francoise \\"Ans\\" Stoop, continued with the Royal Dutch and eventually rose to head their father's company. In 1918 Dolf joined the committee for the funding of the Hoogovens (Dutch Blast Furnaces). In 1920 he became economical director and from 1924 on he was also the director-general. He was considered a very innovative manager, steering the company through the difficult economic environment of the Great Depression; he also believed it was necessary to provide fair wages and establish a pension plan‚Äîunusual for that time. \\"His drive, entrepreneurship, imagination and leadership secured Hoogovens a firm foothold in a very competitive industry at a very difficult time.\\" Dolf and his brother Guus, as leading figures in two major Dutch business concerns, at one point formed a joint venture between the Hoogovens and Royal Dutch Shell to combat a perceived threat to the oil business by IG Farben. Kessler would remain the director of Hoogovens until his death from a brain tumor in 1945, with a short break during the Second World War, when the Germans kept him hostage in camp Beekvliet in Sint-Michielsgestel. Personal life Dolf and his wife Bep (1891‚Äì1968) had four sons and two daughters. Their home, known as Slingerduin or the Villa Kessler, was built and designed in 1929 by the prominent Dutch architect Hendrik Wouda (1885‚Äì1946), a follower of Frank Lloyd Wright. They owned of one of the few known paintings by Hercules Seghers (1589/90‚Äì1637/38)--\\"River Valley\\" (1620)--which now is displayed by the Mauritshuis Museum (Royal Picture Gallery) in The Hague.Frick Art Reference Library: Provenance, sold in 1969 by estate of E.M.L.

Collins, Hercules Seghers, University of Chicago Press, 1953 Kessler was an uncle of the Dutch diplomat and historian Max Kohnstamm (1914‚Äì2010), with whom he was interned at camp Beekvliet in Sint- Michielsgestel; they became quite close there despite the difference in age.

It won the 2007 Royal Mail Award for Scottish Children's Books in the 7‚Äì11 age group. It reached number 8 in the Ottakars sales chart for children's books in June 2006. The plot revolves around the 12-year-old girl of the title, who is badly affected by the break-up of her parents. After leading a food fight at school, she is sent from London to live with her father in Ireland.  Summary  Scarlett is a troubled 12-year-old girl who acts out and has attended five schools in two years. She had a brilliant life up until she was 10 years old when her father left them to go live in Ireland with his new partner Clare and her nine-year-old daughter Holly. This affects Scarlett deeply and, with encouragement from her mother, Scarlett grows very angry at her dad, tearing up birthday cards and various other presents given to her from him. Scarlett acts out a lot in school and after her third suspension from Greenhall Academy, she is permanently excluded, due to her causing a riot in the school cafeteria, insulting dinner ladies, and throwing food around due to her being a vegetarian. Her mother is extremely disappointed and tells Scarlett she has no other choice but to live with her father. Scarlett protests, throws things, and shouts, but her mother stands her ground and sends her away. Scarlett is determined to be as bad as possible when she gets there, to scare them and show her dad she has changed big time and how much his leaving has affected her. Her mother asks her not to tell her dad that she got her tongue pierced but Scarlett shows every intention of doing so. Her father collects her from Ireland West Airport Knock and she is set on not talking to him at all but in the car she breaks this silence accidentally. Her father persists in talking to her, being friendly and apologizing but Scarlett will not accept any of what he is saying. When they get to the cottage, Scarlett discovers something very unexpected ‚Äì Clare, her stepmother, is pregnant. Clare's daughter, Holly ‚Äì Scarlett's stepsister ‚Äì is a very bubbly and friendly nine-year-old, chatting to Scarlett, although she does not exactly get a very enthusiastic response. For school the next day, Scarlett avoids it by pretending she forgot her pencil case and purposefully missing the bus she was supposed to take with Holly. Her father catches her in the house, however, and drives her to the school, very disappointed in her. Scarlett gets upset doing an Irish worksheet about \\"Mo Chlann\\" (English: My Family). She climbs out of the window and walks for miles. After receiving a phone call from Mum, she throws her mobile in the lough and becomes furious in the forest, eventually being rescued by Kian, a boy of about 13 or 14, on a black horse named Midnight. Scarlett's father tells her she is going to be home schooled, at least for the time being. She enjoys this as she gets to study at the lough, talking to Kian, drawing the different plants and naming them in different languages. She is progressing well and settling in with her new family. Kian's father and uncle come looking for him but Scarlett tells them she doesn't know Kian. She apologizes to Kian and he accepts but says he will have to go back ‚Äì he ran away after his mother died of cancer. They arrange to say goodbye at the lough. The summer holidays have started and Holly asks Scarlett to pierce her nose. Scarlett refuses but when she gets blackmailed by Holly she agrees. Holly jumps at the last minute and the pin they were using slips, piercing a hole in Holly's lip by mistake. Holly is taken to hospital and gets stitches, so the adults are very disappointed in Scarlett even though for once, she apologizes for her actions. The next day, Holly and Scarlett's dad head up to Galway for a dentist's appointment and to deliver handmade soap that Clare makes for a living. Scarlett helps Clare with her soap while Holly and her dad are gone and then Scarlett offers to contribute something towards Clare's quilt that she is making for the new baby ‚Äì all the family put in a piece of their own clothing to stitch in. They go up to the attic and Scarlett discovers her father kept all her old dresses and toys although he was meant to throw them away. Meanwhile, a lightning storm has started up and thunderous noises make them go back downstairs. On the way down the ladder, there is a blackout and Clare screams and falls down. After waking her up, Scarlett discovers Clare is in labor. She runs to the lough for Kian's help as it is just approaching the time they had set to say goodbye ‚Äì one o'clock. He is nowhere to be seen but on her way back to the cottage she finds two American tourists who drive them to the hospital and let Scarlett use their mobile phone to call Scarlett's father and inform him of the recent events. Clare has a long labor and the baby is premature so is put in an incubator, to be on the safe side. Scarlett kisses Kian and decides that she should go back home to London and is happy there at last.

Biography  = Early career = Des Bruslys joined the √âcole des Mineurs in Verdun on 28 September 1774. As the school was closed the following year, he joined an elite cavalry unit gardes du corps du roi (bodyguards of the king). He received a commission of second lieutenant at the 3rd Artillery regiment in July 1780. In 1781, des Bruslys took part in an attempt to invade India. He was promoted to first lieutenant in September 1783 and to captain of the Colonial troops on 7 May 1786. He took part in a diplomatic mission to Persia before returning to France in 1787. From January 1788, he served as aide to the inspector of the artillery. In September, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel. On 14 September, he distinguished himself at Croix-aux-Bois, reforming disbanded battalions and disbanding four battalions which were threatened with encirclement. On the following day, he saved the supplies of his army which were being attacked by three squadrons. On 8 October 1789, he was promoted to Adjudant-g√©n√©ral-colonel, and took part in the siege of Namur, personally leading the capture of the fort of Vilatte. On 26 November, he was wounded by a shrapnel in the right arm. = French revolution = From 26 January 1793, he led the siege at Maastricht where he was wounded on 27 February 1794 due to a cannonball in the right leg. On 7 August 1794, des Bruslys was promoted to acting G√©n√©ral de brigade and served as de facto chief of staff of the armies of the North, of Belgium and of Ardennes. His rank was confirmed on 13 May, but revoked on 10 August and he was arrested shortly thereafter following suspicions raised by the defection of his brothers in 1791. He was released at the Thermidorian Reaction, on 9 Thermidor Year II (27 July 1794). On 22 Thermidor (9 August), he was again arrested as former head of staff of Custine. He was freed on 19 Frimaire an III (9 December 1794) and dispatched to the West Army. Des Bruslys was soon called back to Paris, and defended the Convention nationale during the Prairial uprising. On 26 Germinal (15 April 1795), he was sent to the Army of the North. From 25 Pluvi√¥se an V (13 February 1797), he was in charge of defending the coast. On 28 Messidor an VI (16 July 1798), he was sent to the Army of England, which he quit to take back his previous position on 21 niv√¥se an VII (10 January 1799). He was seconded to the Army of the Rhine on 26 frimaire an VIII (17 December 1799), where he distinguished himself at Fribourg and Biberach an der Ri√ü. He served under Jean Victor Marie Moreau at Ulm and defended St. Gotthard Pass. In Vend√©miaire an X (October 1801), he took command of the Souham division, before being put at the disposal of the Ministry of the Navy. On 25 Niv√¥se (15 January 1802), he was sent to Rochefort, embarked aboard the frigate Th√™mis and sailed to √éle de France (now Mauritius), under Fran√ßois-Louis Magallon. He married there. When Magallon was sent back to France, Decaen appointed des Bruslys governor of R√©union. On 4 germinal an XII (25 March 1804), he received the Legion of Honour, and on 13 juillet 1808, he was promoted to G√©n√©ral de division. = First French Empire = Decaen had thought that the British would attempt a raid at Saint Paul. Des Brulys both did not share the conviction and was reluctant to weaken the defences of Saint-Denis, thinking that his forces did not allow him to effectively defend the entire coastline.Les gouverneurs de l'ile de la R√©union The British raided Saint Paul, on 21 September 1809. Unable to hold their position, the French retreated to a position near the gunpowder store. Corbett himself showed up with an ultimatum threatening to set the entire city on fire, should the French attack.Septembre 1809 : Le suicide du gouverneur Des BruslysL‚Äô √Æle Bonaparte tombe aux mains des Anglais On the next day, des Bruslys led his force of 50 soldiers and 800 militiamen of the National Guard to counter the British, and found himself facing a 900-man strong expeditionary force already settled in Saint Paul. Des Bruslys hesitated between launching a direct assault and building a defensive line to contain the British.

A review of the empirical literature on complementarities in organizations,\\" Journal of Management, 36.1 (2010): 207-233. Thus two assets are said to be complements when investment in one asset increases the marginal return on the other. On the contrary, assets are substitutes when investment in one does not effect the marginal return of the other. The production process is described by the production function F(x,y) , where x and y are the amounts invested of the two assets, then it is possible to define formally the elasticity of substitution as : \\\\sigma_{xy}=\\\\frac{d \\\\ln (y/x) }{d \\\\ln (MRT_{12})} =\\\\frac{d \\\\ln (y/x) }{d \\\\ln (F_{x}/F_{y})} If \\\\sigma_{xy} is equal to 1, the assets are substitutes; if lower, complements; if higher antagonists.  Strategy  In the field of strategy, the concept is sometimes understood to apply to assets, infrastructure or capabilities needed to support the successful commercialization and marketing of a technological innovation, other than those assets fundamentally associated with that innovation.Teece, David J. 1986. Profiting from technological innovation: Implications for integration, collaboration, licensing and public policy. Research Policy 15 (6): 285-305. The term was first coined by David Teece.

Complementary assets are broken down into three general types: # Generic assets: \\"general purpose\\" assets which do not need to be tailored to a particular innovation; # Specialized assets: unilateral dependence between the innovation and the complementary asset; # Cospecialized assets: bilateral dependence between the innovation and the complementary asset. Complementary assets, among other factors, are important for organizations wishing to commercialize and profit from an innovation.

These are defined as a combination of resources that jointly reduce value from the implementation of other resources.

Family Ealdgyth was the daughter of √Ülfgar, who had been earl of East Anglia a number of times in the 1050s and was appointed earl of Mercia in c. 1057, in succession of his father Earl Leofric. √Ülfgar's wife √Ülfgifu was probably her mother, and Eadwine, the later earl of Mercia, and Morcar, earl of Northumbria, were her brothers. In 1055, √Ülfgar was exiled on the charge of treason. He went to Ireland to muster troops and formed an alliance with Gruffudd ap Llywelyn, who had been king of Gwynedd (1039‚Äì1055) but assumed the sovereignty of all Wales in 1055. √Ülfgar and Gruffudd invaded England and plundered Hereford, bringing great humiliation to Earl Ralph, who needed to call in external support to repel the invaders. When peace was made, √Ülfgar resumed office before succeeding his father as earl of Mercia in c. 1057.Williams, \\"√Ülfgar, earl of Mercia (d. 1062?)\\". Marriages and issue =Gruffudd ap Llywelyn= :See also Gruffydd and Harold It was presumably in the year of her father's appointment (c. 1057) that Ealdgyth married his political ally, King Gruffudd ap Llywelyn. William of Jumi√®ges describes her as a woman of considerable beauty. Walter Map also wrote of a beautiful lady much beloved by the king and so he may have had Ealdgyth in mind.Walker, \\"Gruffudd ap Llywelyn (d. 1063)\\" On her marriage, she was given a modest amount of land in England, though the only estate which can be certainly identified as having belonged to her is one at Binley, Warwickshire. She bore the king a daughter called Nest. Nest later became the wife of Osbern fitzRichard, a marcher lord on the Herefordshire border, who acquired Binley.Edith appears in the Domesday Book as Algid uxor Grifin. Dictionary of National Biography 1885-1900, Volume 01 Nest and Osbern had a daughter who married Bernard de Neufmarch√©, also a marcher lord. The chronicles also record two of Gruffudd's sons, Maredudd and Ithel, probably for Idwal, who died in 1069, and a third son may be Owain ap Gruffudd (d. 1059). The alliance between Ealdgyth's father and husband was of great significance in resisting the growing power of the Godwinesons. On the death of Earl Ralph in 1057, Hereford was added to Harold's earldom. The following year, √Ülfgar was outlawed for a second time, but he was restored to office before long. √Ülfgar is last heard of in 1062 and seems to have died by 1063, when Harold Godwineson invaded Wales. Gruffudd was killed in the event. =Harold Godwinson= Silver penny depicting King Harold II of England, the second husband of Edith of Mercia Ealdgyth later became the wife and queen consort of her late husband's enemy Harold. The date of the marriage is unknown, but it must have taken place at some stage before the Conquest, whether before or after Harold's coronation as king of England (January 1066). It seems that Harold's choice of bride was \\"aimed not only at securing the support of the Mercian house for himself in his royal ambitions, but also at weakening the links between that same house and the rulers of north Wales\\". In any event, Ealdgyth was soon to be widowed for a second time. In October that year, Harold was defeated and died in the Battle of Hastings, which was fought against the invading forces of William, Duke of Normandy, who would subsequently ascend the English throne. At the news of Harold's death, Ealdgyth's brothers went to London to fetch her and immediately sent her to Chester for shelter. It is unknown what happened to her thereafter. Harold had a number of children with his common law wife Edith the Fair, but his marriage to Ealdgyth may not have produced any offspring. It has been suggested that Ealdgyth may have been the mother of Harold's son Harold, but this possibility is not universally accepted.

Plot introduction The novel does not take place at the time of the events recounted, but at the time its narrator recalls them. There are three main characters: the narrator (who is the only survivor), Glenn Gould, who died a natural death at fifty-one, and Wertheimer who committed suicide some time later. The novel consists almost entirely of recollections and ruminations relating to the relationships between the three. Wertheimer and the narrator were students in a piano class taught by Vladimir Horowitz at the Mozarteum in Salzburg in 1953, where they met a young Canadian piano prodigy (Gould). Plot summary In Mozarteum in Salzburg in 1953 the main characters met a young Canadian prodigy who played the Goldberg Variations miraculously and who, they quickly came to realize, was a greater pianist than even their teacher‚Äîindeed, \\"the most important piano virtuoso of the century,\\" as the narrator puts it in the novel's opening sentence. The encounter with Gould affects both characters decisively for almost three decades, as they experience an endless series of personal and intellectual travails. Gould‚Äôs talent triggers the suicidal tendencies of his two colleagues: so great is the impact of Gould's genius on the other two that, even as it nourishes them, it destroys them: they realize that Gould represents an artistic ideal to which they cannot hope to aspire. So the narrator eventually decides to give up the piano in favour of philosophy, and spends much of his subsequent time composing a rambling, never-completed essay entitled \\"About Glenn Gould\\". Wertheimer, who had been a very promising virtuoso himself, follows suit, abandoning music and moving into the \\"human sciences\\", the meaning of which is left vague. Eventually, Wertheimer's behaviour becomes more and more erratic and self-destructive; he alienates all his friends, and tyrannises his devoted sister. It was Gould who, with his \\"ruthless and open, yet healthy American- Canadian manner\\" first called Wertheimer, to his face, \\"The Loser\\" (\\"Der Untergeher\\"‚Äîa much more evocative word, lit. \\"the one who goes under\\"). As Wertheimer comes to see the accuracy of this epithet, he gradually loses his grip on life. Allusions to actual events Bernhard and Gould never met in real life; however, Gould did play twice in Salzburg: the Bach D Minor Concerto with Dimitri Mitropoulos on 10 August 1958, and a Sweelinck- Sch√∂nberg-Mozart-Bach recital on 25 August 1959. Narrative style The novel is written in the form of a continuous first person interior monologue, with no paragraph indentations and a high number of run-on sentences, obsessive repetitions, unexplained uses of italics, and alienating leaps (without transition) from verb tense to verb tense. Adaptations The Brooklyn Academy of Music commissioned a one-act chamber opera by David Lang based on the novel, which had its premiere in September 2016.

Andr√© Marcel Desoutter (31 January 1894-13 April 1952) was an English aviator, who lost a leg in an early flying accident, but went on to a successful career in the aviation industry. Early life Desoutter was one of six children of Louis Albert Desoutter, an immigrant French watchmaker, and Philom√®ne Duret. Along with his four brothers, Rene, Charles, Louis and Robert, Marcel trained as a watchmaker. Aviation career Learning to fly with the Bl√©riot Company at their Hendon works, he passed the flying tests at the age of 17, but could not receive his licence until he was 18, receiving Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate no. 186 on 27 February 1912. He became an instructor, test and demonstration pilot. Desoutter's accident occurred at the London Aviation Meeting held at Hendon Aerodrome at Easter 1913: whilst flying his 50-h.p. Gnome-Bl√©riot on the afternoon of 23 March, the control stick slipped from his hand and the Bl√©riot dived into the ground at the edge of the aerodrome. Desoutter's leg was badly broken, and later had to be amputated above the knee. He was fitted with the standard wooden leg, but his younger brother Charles used his knowledge of aircraft materials to design a new jointed Duralumin alloy leg of half the weight, with which he was able to return to flying. In 1914 the pair formed a company, Desoutter Brothers Limited, at 73 Baker Street, London, to manufacture the legs. The firm expanded greatly during and after the First World War, and moved to The Hyde, Hendon in 1924, where they manufactured both artificial limbs and the pneumatic portable Desoutter Tools which had been developed initially as a sideline. Marcel married Margaret F. Rust in 1918; they had three children. Marcel Desoutter left the business in 1928 and formed the Desoutter Aircraft Company Ltd. at Croydon to build the Dutch Koolhoven F.K.41 three-seat monoplane, renaming it as the Desoutter I. 41 of this type and the improved Desoutter II were produced, but the business folded in 1932 after its main customer, National Flying Services at London Air Park, Hanworth, went into liquidation. In 1935 Desoutter became a partner with Morris Jackaman in Airports, Ltd., which had been set up to develop Gatwick and Gravesend aerodromes as airports, and was still managing director of the company when he died at his home in Horley, Surrey on 13 April 1952.

It was first flown on 9 October 1906 and was later purchased by the German Army and operated as Z I until being retired in 1913. Before being purchased by the Army, LZ 3 made many flights and carried a number of influential passengers, including the German Crown Prince.Robinson 1973 p.34 Design and development The design of LZ 3 closely followed that of its predecessor, the LZ 2\\\\. The hull framework was of identical layout and size and the same engines and propellers were used, although the volume of lifting gas was increased. LZ 2 had shown severe pitch instability, and LZ 3 was fitted with two pairs of biplane elevators, one set in front of the forward gondola and the second behind the rear gondola, and fixed biplane horizontal stabilisers at the rear of the hull. Following the first flights in 1906 some modifications were made: the triangular section keel between the gondolas was extended fore and aft, the biplane elevators were replaced by two sets of quadruple elevators mounted at either end of the cylindrical section of the hull and the rudders were mounted between the tips of the horizontal stabilisers.Robinson 1973 pp.33-4. After the destruction of LZ 4 it was extensively rebuilt, with the addition of an extra bay increasing its length by 8 m (26 ft 6 in) and gas capacity to 12,888 cu m (430,800 cu ft). A large vertical fin was added above the stern of the hull and new engines, each providing 105 hp (78 kW) were fitted, giving a maximum speed of (27.5 mph)Robinson 1973 p.42. Operational history LZ 3 was first flown on 9 October 1906, when a successful flight was made lasting 2 hours 17 minutes and carrying eleven people. A second shorter flight was made the next day, following which it was deflated and laid up for the winter. These flights caused a reevaluation of Zeppelin's work on the part of the German government, and a grant of 500,000 marks was made to him.Robinson 1973, p.32. However it was stipulated that an acceptance flight lasting 24 hours would have to be completed before any airship could be bought by the Government: realising that LZ 3 was incapable of meeting this requirement, work was started on the LZ 4\\\\. Following modifications to the control surfaces LZ 3 was next flown on 24 September 1907, when it made a flight lasting 4 hours 17 minutes, and a series of successful flights was made in the following days, including one on 30 September lasting 7 hours 54 minutes during which it was flown over land for the first time, flying north as far as Ravensburg. During this flight some difficulty in managing the airship due to the up and downdraughts produced by the hilly terrain was experienced. On 8 October a brief flight was made with Crown Prince William, the heir to the throne, on board and the airship was then deflated for the winter. On 14 December the floating hangar broke loose from its moorings during a storm and was driven ashore, severely damaging LZ 3.Robinson 1973 pp.34-5. Following the destruction of LZ 4, LZ 3 was repaired and enlarged. It was reinflated on 21 October 1908 and a series of short test flights were made between 23 and 26 October. On 27 October a flight lasting 5 hours 55 minutes was made with the Kaiser's brother, Admiral Prince Heinrich, on board and on 7 November, with Prince William as a passenger, it was flown 80 km (50 mi) to Donaueschingen, where the Kaiser was then staying. In spite of poor weather conditions, the flight succeeded: two days later LZ 3 was officially accepted by the Government and on 10 November Zeppelin was rewarded with an official visit to Friedrichshafen by the Kaiser, during which Zeppelin was awarded the Order of the Black Eagle.Robinson 1973 p.43. The renamed Z I's military crew and ground staff, commanded by Major Sperling, arrived at Friedrichshafen in March 1909 to begin training. In June it was flown to Metz, where it was stationed until being broken up as obsolete in March 1913.

ULSA also serves as a peer to peer support network for survivors, providing them with training in vocational, leadership and advocacy skills in partnership with other organizations throughout Northern and Western Uganda. The Uganda Landmine Survivors Association is composed of district-level survivor groups across the country and other like minded NGOs and stakeholders whose mandate include addressing landmine related issues, support to landmine survivors and other persons with disabilities, including survivor groups in Apac, Lira, Gulu, Kasese, Kitgum, Oyam and Pader.

Since 2006, the landlocked African nation has been negotiating a peace deal with the Lord's Resistance Army, a rebel group known for terrorizing the Acholi and Lango people of the North through child- abductions, mutilation, massacre and sexual enslavement. There is also significant contamination in the Western region of Uganda, stemming from conflict on the Congolese border. Despite improving political conditions, however, landmine survivors continue to face serious injustices daily in Uganda, including inadequate medical support and inability to find sufficient employment or food. Moreover, victims are often shunned by their families for fear of becoming a burden.http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=80183 While the landmine problem in Uganda is less severe than countries like Angola, Mozambique and Afghanistan, the nature of the weapon has made it difficult to overcome.http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/KHII-6RG9YV?OpenDocument According to Ugandan officials, there are more than 350 suspected hazardous areas in the country, of which 153 are Kitgum; 91 in Gulu; 61 in Amuru and 57 in Kasese.Comprehensive Plan on Victim Assistance ‚Äì Ugandan Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development See also * International Campaign to Ban Landmines * Convention on Cluster Munitions References External links * Uganda Landmine Survivors Association (ULSA) Web Site Category:Mine action organizations Category:Non-profit organisations based in Uganda Category:Organizations established in 2005 Category:2005 establishments in Uganda ","title":"Uganda Landmine Survivors Association"},{"id":"20054322","text":"The Stadio Franco Ossola (also called Luigi Ganna Velodrome) is a sports stadium and velodrome currently in use by the football team A.S.D.

Perception Within weeks of the battle, it began to be compared to the Greek stand at the Battle of Thermopylae.Glaser (1985), p. 61. Efforts to preserve the Alamo have largely been an Anglo-American cause. The first major calls to restore parts of the Alamo occurred after 1860, as English-speaking settlers began to outnumber those of Mexican heritage.Schoelwer (1985), p. 52. Likewise, according to Schoelwer, within \\"the development of Alamo imagery has been an almost exclusively American endeavor\\", focusing more on the Texian defenders with less emphasis given to the Mexican army or the Tejano soldiers who served in the Texian army.Schoelwer (1985), p. 56. Many Tejanos viewed the Alamo as more than just a battle site. They or their ancestors had experienced the benefits of the Alamo compound when it served as a mission, a hospital, or a military post. Americans had arrived in Texas much later, when the Alamo no longer served in those roles, and they tended to see the compound solely in relation to the battle.Schoelwer (1985), p. 18. According to author Richard R. Flores, in the early 20th century the Alamo was perceived by many in the majority white population of Texas as a symbol of white supremacy over the minority Mexican population. This symbolism followed the late 19th century to early 20th century development of a new capitalist system in Texas that placed whites at the top of the social ladder as profit earners and Mexicans at the bottom of the social ladder as wage earners.Flores, Richard R. Remembering the Alamo (Austin: University of Texas Press, 2002) In Mexico, perceptions of the battle have often mirrored those of Santa Anna.Glaser (1985), p. 98. Initially, reports of the Mexican victory concentrated on glorifying Santa Anna, especially among newspapers that supported the centralist cause.Costeloe (1988), p. 537. Typical headlines included, \\"Immortal Glory to the Illustrious General Santa Anna: Eternal Praise to the Invincible Army of Mexico\\".Costeloe (1988), p. 536. Within days of the news, people began composing patriotic marching songs about Santa Anna and his victory at the Alamo.Costeloe (1988), p. 538. Santa Anna's political opponents were displeased that the focus had shifted to him; within days newspapers supporting the federalist viewpoint began questioning whether the victory had come at too great a cost, and whether it would actually help Mexico. Many of the newspapers were disenchanted with Santa Anna's deployment of General Martin Perfecto de Cos, who had been paroled back to Mexico after the Siege of Bexar on the condition that he no longer take up arms against Texians.Costeloe (1988), pp. 539‚Äì40. On April 27, 1836, Mexican Secretary of War Jos√© Mar√≠a Tornel announced that Mexican soldiers who participated in the campaign to retake Texas would be eligible to receive a special medal; to commemorate the battle of the Alamo, the establishment date for the program was retroactively set to March 6, 1836. Within weeks, however, the Mexican government learned of Santa Anna's defeat and capture at the Battle of San Jacinto; the medal program was immediately cancelled.Glaser (1985), p. 102. The Texas campaign, including the Battle of the Alamo, was soon overshadowed by the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War of the 1840s. In the 1960s, the battle was often used as a historical parallel to the Vietnam War. United States President Lyndon Johnson, whose father had authored the 1905 legislation that allowed the state of Texas to buy the long barracks, often compared the war to the Alamo. He remarked once that his decision to send more troops to Southeast Asia was \\"Just like the Alamo, somebody damn well needed to go to their aid.\\"Schoelwer (1985), p. 166. These remarks, and other similar ones, prompted a strong anti-Alamo backlash in the United States. The New York Times editorialized that \\"If Americans must remember the Alamo, let's remember that gallant men died needlessly in that old mission and that their sacrifice led eventually to a war that reflects little credit on the United States. ... To persevere in folly is no virtue. To dare to retreat from error can be the highest form of courage.\\"Schoelwer (1985), p. 168. In the late 1960s and early 1970s numerous anti-war protests were held on the grounds of the Alamo. Alamo Mission An artist's conception of how the Alamo was used during its years as a Spanish mission Memorial to the fallen soldiers at the Alamo Following the Mexican victory at the Battle of the Alamo, Mexican troops quartered in the Alamo Mission. As the Mexican army retreated from Texas following the Battle of San Jacinto, they tore down many of the walls and burned the palisade which Crockett had defended. Within the next several decades, various buildings in the complex were torn down, and in 1850 the United States Army added a gable to the top of the chapel.Todish et al. (1998), p. 198. Speculation is that the gable was originally at Mission San Jos√©, due to its presence at that mission in 1846‚Äì48 sketches, and its absence in later images.George Nelson, The Alamo: An Illustrated History. Uvalde, Texas: Aldine Books, 1998, pages 74‚Äì78. Today, the remnants of the Alamo are in downtown San Antonio in the U.S. state of Texas. The church building remains standing and serves as an official state shrine to the Texian defenders. As the 20th century began, many Texans advocated razing the remaining building, the Long Barrack. A wealthy rancher's daughter, Clara Driscoll, purchased the building to serve as a museum. The Texas Legislature later bought the property and appointed the Daughters of the Republic of Texas as permanent caretakers.Todish et al. (1998), p. 199. In front of the church, in the center of downtown San Antonio's Alamo Plaza, stands a cenotaph, designed by Pompeo Coppini and erected in 1939, which commemorates the Texians who died during the battle.Groneman (1998), p. 56. According to Bill Groneman's Battlefields of Texas, the Alamo has become \\"the most popular tourist site in Texas\\".Groneman (1998), p. 52. Literature John Henry Brown wrote the first history of the battle, which was published in 1843. Many of the Mexican officers who participated in the battle left memoirs, although some were not written until decades after the battle. Among those who provided written accounts of the battle were Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, Vicente Filisola, Jos√© Enrique de la Pe√±a, Jos√© Juan S√°nchez Navarro, Juan N. Almonte, and Francisco Becerra.Nofi (1992), p. 211. Texians Juan Segu√≠n and John Sutherland also left memoirs,Nofi (1992), p. 212. although some historians believe Sutherland was not at the Alamo and wrote his memoirs from hearsay.Lindley (2003), p. 115. Of the Texian survivors, more weight was given to the account of Susannah Dickinson, the only American adult to live. The other survivors, including former slaves and several Tejanos, were not lauded as much as Dickinson.Schoelwer (1985), p. 117. The first report of the names of the Texian victims of the battle came in the March 24, 1836 issue of the Telegraph and Texas Register. The 115 names on the list came from John Smith and Gerald Navan, who had left as couriers.Chariton (1990), p. 180. In 1843 former Texas Ranger and amateur historian John Henry Brown wrote and published the first history of the battle, a pamphlet called The Fall of the Alamo. He followed this in 1853 with a second pamphlet called Facts of the Alamo, Last Days of Crockett and Other Sketches of Texas. No copies of the pamphlets have survived.Lindley (2003), p. 106. The next major treatment of the battle was Reuben Potter's The Fall of the Alamo, originally published in 1860 and republished in The Magazine of American History in 1878. Potter based his work on interviews with many of the survivors of the Battle of the Alamo. One of the most used secondary sources about the Alamo is Amelia W. Williams's doctoral dissertation, \\"Critical Study of the Siege of the Alamo and of the Personnel of Its Defenders\\". Completed in 1931, it attempted to positively identify all of the Texians who died during the battle. Her list was used to choose the names carved into the cenotaph memorial in 1936.Lindley (2003), p. 37. Several historians, including Thomas Ricks Lindley, Thomas Lloyd Miller, and Richard G. Santos, believe her list included men who had not died at the Alamo.Lindley (2003), p. 41. Despite the errors in some of her work, Williams collected a large amount of information and her work serves as a starting point for many historians.Lindley (2008), p. 68. The first full-length, non- fiction book covering the battle was not published until 1948, when John Myers Myers' The Alamo was released. Since then, a litany of books have followed, most notably Walter Lord's seminal work in 1961, A Time to Stand. As the 19th century progressed, the battle began to appear as a plot device in many novels and plays. In 1869, novelists Jeremiah Clemens and Bernard Lile wrote fictionalized accounts of the battle. Novelist Amelia Barr produced her own fictional version, Remember the Alamo, in 1888. In her book, Alamo Images, Susan Pendergrast Schoelwer noted that in these early novels \\"the Alamo passages seem almost incidental to the main plot, included perhaps as a means of attracting interest and encouraging sales\\".Schoelwer (1985), p. 41. Art The first artistic depiction of the battle came in 1838 in John Milton Niles's History of South America and Mexico. In Schoelwer's opinion, the scenes \\"bore absolutely no resemblance to the original\\". These and other early paintings often depicted buildings that looked nothing like the Alamo and battles that occurred very differently than the 1836 battle at the Alamo. However, their presence and popularity increased the Alamo's fame, and likely contributed to the early waves of tourism at the battle site.Schoelwer (1985), p. 43. Film This replica of the Alamo is located at Alamo Village. It was built for the 1960 John Wayne film The Alamo. According to Todish et al., \\"there can be little doubt that most Americans have probably formed many of their opinions on what occurred at the Alamo not from books, but from the various movies made about the battle.\\"Todish et al. (1998), p. 187. The first film version of the battle appeared in 1911, when Gaston Melies directed The Immortal Alamo, which has since been lost. Through the next four decades several other movies were released, variously focusing on Davy Crocket, Almeron Dickinson, and Louis Rose. The Alamo achieved prominence on television in 1955 with Walt Disney's Davy Crockett: King of the Wild Frontier, which was largely based on myth.Nofi (1992), p. 213. In the early 1950s John Wayne began developing a film based on the Battle of the Alamo. When he left his contract with Republic Pictures he was forced to leave behind a partial script. Republic Pictures had the script finished and developed into the 1955 movie The Last Command. Although the film had its historical inaccuracies, it was the most detailed of the films on the Texas Revolution.Todish et al. (1998), p. 188. Wayne continued to develop an Alamo movie, resulting in the 1960 film The Alamo, starring Wayne as Davy Crockett. Although screenwriter James Edward Grant claimed to have done extensive historical research, according to Todish \\"there is not a single scene in The Alamo which corresponds to an historically verifiable incident\\", and historians J. Frank Dobie and Lon Tinkle demanded that their names be removed from the credits as historical advisors. The movie was banned in Mexico.Graham (1985), p. 59. The set built for the movie, Alamo Village, includes a replica of the Alamo Mission and the then-Mexican city of San Antonio and is still used as an active movie set. As the 150th anniversary of the battle approached in the 1980s, several additional movies were made about the Alamo, including the made-for-television movie The Alamo: 13 Days to Glory, which Nofi regards as the most historically accurate of all Alamo films. The movie Todish calls \\"the best theatrical film ever made about the Alamo\\" was also filmed in the 1980s.Todish et al. (1998), p. 190. Filmed in IMAX format using historical reenactors instead of professional actors, Alamo ... The Price of Freedom is shown only in San Antonio, with several viewings per day at a theater near the Alamo. It runs only 45 minutes but has \\"an attention to detail and intensity that are remarkable\\".Todish et al. (1998), p. 191. In 2004 another film, also called The Alamo, was released. Described by CNN as possibly \\"the most character-driven of all the movies made on the subject\\", the movie starred Billy Bob Thornton as Crockett, Dennis Quaid as Sam Houston, and Jason Patric as Bowie. However, the film was one of the year's biggest box office failures. In Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Pee-wee Herman's stolen bike is said by a fortune teller to be in the basement of the Alamo, but during a tour of the structure he is told by the tour guide that the Alamo has no basement. Music A number of songwriters have also been inspired by the Battle of the Alamo. For example: *\\"Remember the Alamo\\" (1955), written by Texas folk singer and songwriter Jane Bowers, was recorded by the Kingston Trio, Johnny Cash, Tex Ritter, Donovan and others.Jane Bowers' obituary *Tennessee Ernie Ford's cover of \\"The Ballad of Davy Crockett\\" (recorded February 7, 1955) spent 16 weeks on the country music charts, peaking at number 4 in 1955.Todish et al. (1998), p. 194. *In 1960, Marty Robbins recorded a version of the song \\"The Ballad of the Alamo\\", which spent 13 weeks on the pop charts, peaking at number 34.Todish et al. (1998), p. 196. *English band Babe Ruth's song \\"The Mexican\\" (1972) is about the Mexican point of view. Replicas Replicas of the Alamo have also appeared. One being a 6,533 sq.ft residential home located in Spicewood, Texas just northwest of Austin. Built in 2007 and with an estimated value of $1.35 million. Rustic on the outside, it is far more luxurious on the interior than the real Alamo. Cypress. Another replica of the historic mission is located on the grounds of the Cy-Hope foundation in Cypress. Built by Kwik Kopy owner and founder 'Bud' Hadfield on the Kwik Kopy Northwest Forest Conference Training Center on Telge road. The complex itself serves as a wedding reception and banquet hall with a seating capacity of 180. In mid 2020, the Cypress Alamo had suffered a decline in visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Note knurled nut holding in the replaceable front sight insert A globe sight is a front sight component used to assist the aiming of a gun/device, usually those intended to launch projectiles, such as firearms, airguns, and crossbows. It is found in particular as a front sight element on rifles. To obtain a usable sighting line the diopter has to have a complementing rear sight element. Diopter and globe sighting lines are commonly used in ISSF match rifle shooting events. Globe front sight A globe front sight with various types of front sight inserts. The globe front sight consists of a hollow cylinder with a threaded cap, which allows differently shaped interchangeable front sight elements to be used. Most common are posts of varying widths and heights or rings or holes of varying diameter ‚Äî these can be chosen by the shooter for the best fit to the target being used. Tinted transparent plastic insert elements may also be used, with a hole in the middle; these work the same way as an opaque ring, but provide a less obstructed view of the target. High end target front sight tunnels normally also accept accessories like adjustable aperture and optical systems to ensure optimal sighting conditions for match shooters. Some high end target sight line manufacturers also offer front sights with integrated aperture mechanisms. Complementing rear sight element The complementing rear sight element may be an open type iron sight or an aperture sight as used in ghost rings and target aperture sights such as a target shooting diopter sight. Diopter and globe sighting line principle The concentric circle alignment principle is used for precise aiming at round targets The use of round rear and front sighting elements for aiming at round targets, like used in ISSF match shooting, takes advantage of the natural ability of the eye and brain to easily align concentric circles (circles all having a common centre). For optimal aiming and comfort the shooter should focus the aiming eye on the front sighting element. To avoid eye fatigue and improve balance the non- aiming eye should be kept open. The non-aiming eye can be blocked from seeing distractions by mounting a semi-transparent occluder to the diopter. Even for the maximum precision, there should still be a significant area of white visible around the bullseye and between the front and rear sight ring (if a front ring is being used). Since the best key to determining center is the amount of light passing through the apertures, a narrow, dim ring of light can actually be more difficult to work with than a larger, brighter ring. The precise sizes of the employed components are quite subjective, and depend on both shooter preference and ambient lighting, which is why target rifles come with easily replaceable front sight inserts, and adjustable aperture mechanisms.

Stained Glass in England during the Middle Ages, Routledge, 1993, p.178 Biography, works The East Window of Winchester College Chapel. The glass largely dates from an 1820s restoration, but is a fairly accurate copy of Glazier's original window. Glazier's workshops were based in Oxford, and he was clearly an important figure in the town; he is recorded in New College's Steward's Book as being regularly invited to dine with the Warden and Fellows.Glazier's Magnificent Seven, The Oxford Times, 08-02-08 Although we have some record of his professional activities (and appearance; see below) almost nothing is known of his personal life, other than that he was married.Matthew, H. et al. (eds.) Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, p.455 Glazier is particularly notable for his early adoption of elements of the emerging International Gothic style in his work: he may have been influenced by his contacts with European artists through William of Wykeham and his circle.Marks, p.46 His work is characterised by sophisticated draughtsmanship and placement of figures, and also by its remarkable stylistic development, indicating that such artists were open to absorbing new ideas during the course of their careers.Marks, p.46 Along with the work of John Thornton of Coventry, Glazier's style was highly influential. It is possible that Robert Lyen, who made windows for Exeter Cathedral, was his apprentice. Glazier's work survives in the chapels of New College, Oxford and of Winchester College. The latter scheme contains an 1822 copy of a self-portrait included in the original east window: this depicts him kneeling in prayer, wearing a long gown and with a short, forked beard of the sort fashionable in the late 14th century. There is a panel probably executed by him in the church of Thenford, Northamptonshire, as well as windows in Winchester Cathedral and the chapel of Merton College, Oxford.

This is a Mediterranean species. In Britain this species is now sometimes called the \\"Cliveden snail\\", as in 2004 a very small colony was found to have been living on the estate at Cliveden House, a large stately home in Buckinghamshire, England. Individuals of the species had been living on an Italian balustrade which was imported to Britain in the late 19th century, and have survived at the estate for over a century before they were discovered there. Other introduced populations of P. papillaris can be found across South East England. There is a complicated nomenclatural problem with the name of this species. Some argued that the name should be Papillifera bidens. See further discussion under \\"Nomenclature\\".  Nomenclature  The ICZN opinion, number 2176, preserved the name Turbo bidens Linnaeus, 1758, and indicated implicitly that the name Helix papillaris M√ºller, 1774 was a junior synonym of the same species. However, at this time the meaning of the name Turbo bidens was not fixed with a valid type specimen designation. In 2009 Kadolsky Kadolsky D. (2009). \\"Turbo bidens Linnaeus 1758 (Gastropoda: Clausiliidae) misidentified for 250 years\\". Journal of Conchology 40(1): 19-30. abstract. reviewed the nomenclatural history of the name Turbo bidens and concluded that a neotype designation proposed by Falkner et al. (2002) was invalid because it was not based on an existing specimen but on a figure of Papillifera papillaris published by Gualtierus (1742), which did not agree with Linnaeus' description of Turbo bidens, and which Linnaeus did not quote. Kadolsky (2009) argued that Linnaeus' brief description was consistent with a figure in Gualtierius' (1742) work that Linnaeus (1758) quoted, and so Kadolsky fixed the meaning of the nominal species Turbo bidens Linnaeus, 1758 with the designation of a neotype. This neotype is a specimen from Florence (where Gualtierius lived and where he might conceivably have collected) of the clausiliid species hitherto known as Cochlodina incisa (K√ºster, 1876). However, the malacologist Hartmut Nordsieck and others did not accept Kadolsky's interpretation.Nordsieck, H. \\"Papillifera bidens (Linn√© 1758) (Clausiliidae, Alopiinae), eine h√§ufige, aber wenig bekannte Art\\". Link , accessed 26/05/11. One reason for this opinion was Linnaeus' description of the shell suture of Turbo bidens as \\"subcrenata\\". This does not apply to Cochlodina incisa, except for minute crenellations which hardly deserve the name, but Gualtierius' figure does actually show these crenellations. Kadolsky argued that Linnaeus accepted the figure as correct and described his species accordingly. Nordsieck and others instead argued that Linnaeus accidentally referred to the wrong figure, but that his verbal description was an accurate description of the Papillifera species. Kadolsky's neotype designation for Turbo bidens claims to fix the meaning of this name conclusively. In this case the valid name for the Papillifera species would be Papillifera papillaris (M√ºller, 1774). Others did not accept that the designation of a neotype was valid, in which case the correct name is Papillifera bidens (Linneaus, 1758). The issue was raised with the ICZN and their ruling (Opinion 2355) was not to set aside Kadolsky's neotype; hence the name to use is Papillifera papillaris (M√ºller, 1774).

The Archeo+Malacology Group Newsletter, (10): page 4-6., Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. At least some of these introductions appear to have been accidental, on imported stonework, and may in some cases date back to the Roman occupation of these areas. But the process is continuing: in 2009‚Äì2010, Papillifera papillaris imported on Italian limestone blocks were found to have survived overwinter in a stonemason's yard near Stuttgart, Germany. =In Great Britain= This snail was also accidentally introduced to southern England, more than once, and became established there. In 2004, the species was found in Buckinghamshire, southeastern England, in the crevices of a travertine marble and brick balustrade. This balustrade was originally constructed in Italy in about 1816, and had stood in the grounds of the Villa Borghese, in Rome. In the late 19th century the balustrade was taken from there, and was installed in the formal gardens of the country house Cliveden in 1896. These small snails shelter in the many nooks and crannies of the travertine marble stonework; presumably they feed on lichens that grow on the surfaces of the stone. The snails at Cliveden were noticed by a specialist volunteer who was cleaning the stonework and statuary; the identity of the snail was recognized by Janet Ridout-Sharpe. The snails have spread from the balustrade to a red brick terrace and a stone fountain, but apparently no further than that. Although this is certainly an introduced species, it is not an invasive species. Subsequent to the publicity surrounding this find, it was pointed out that the same species had already been recorded in 1993 from Brownsea Island, Dorset in southwest England. At Brownsea Island, as at Cliveden, the snails live on stonework and statuary imported from Italy a century or more earlier. There are even indications of a Dorset occurrence of this snail, perhaps from the Brownsea Island locality, 250 years earlier. References External links * Paul Eccleston. 21 August 2008.

The clausilium is one part of the clausilial apparatus. The presence of a clausilium is the reason for the common name \\"door snails\\", because all the snails in this family have a roughly spoon-shaped \\"door\\" or clausilium, which can slide down to close the aperture of the shell. However, this structure is emphatically not the same thing as an operculum, which is virtually non-existent in pulmonate snails, only occurring in the Amphibolidae. The exact shape of the clausilium varies from genus to genus: it can be tongue-shaped, spoon-shaped or spatula-shaped. The wide flat end of the clausilium can close the aperture of the snail shell, and thus protect the soft parts against predation by animals such as carnivorous beetle larvae. The narrow end of the clausilium slides in a groove, which is formed by spiral folds on the inside of the shell around the columella. Because the groove is long, and the muscles that control the clausilium are also long, the whole structure can be retracted into the shell. The mechanism is totally different, but the clausilium is vaguely reminiscent of an automated garage door opener.

He competed in the 1948, 1952, 1956, and 1960 Summer Olympics. Personal Wolf was born in Los Angeles, California, and was Jewish. He was the son of famous vaudeville music director Rube Wolf Sr. and Fanchonnette Sunny (Rutherford) Wolf.\\"Beverly High Athletes Inducted into Hall of Fame\\", Beverly Hills Weekly, November 3, 2011. He married Carolyn Wyatt and had three children - Wallace Scott, John, and Lori, and the family lived in Manhattan Beach, California. He died in Santa Ynez, California. Career At Beverly Hills High School (class of 1947), Wolf won the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) 220y-freestyle championship three years in a row, 1945-47 (with times of 2:32.2, 2:23.7, and 2:19.1), the individual medley - 75 yards two years in a row, 1946-47 (with times of 45.7 and 44.4), and was the CIF record holder in 220y-freestyle and individual medley.\\"ALL-TIME BOYS SWIMMING/DIVING TEAM CHAMPIONS,\\" cifss.org. As a 17-year-old representing the United States at the 1948 Olympics in London, Wolf won a gold medal as member of the U.S. team in the men's 4√ó200-meter freestyle relay which set a world record of 8:46. At the US Olympic trials of the 1948 4x200-meter freestyle relay, several swimmers who had already qualified in other events slowed down in their heats or swam fast in the prelims and scratched themselves for the final to allow more swimmers to qualify for the US Olympic Team.New York Times 25 July 1948 Page S3 He was the top qualifier in the 4√ó200-meter freestyle relay trials final with a time of 2:14 flat.Page 119 1948 US Olympic Book Ultimately, coach Robert Kiphuth did hold a time trial shortly after the actual trialsNew York Times 28 July 1948 Page 29 with 11 of the swimmers. This time trial had Jimmy McLane as first overall with a time of 2:11.0, Bill Smith and Wally Wolf in 2:11.2, and Wally Ris in 2:12.4. This quartet was used for the Olympic final and won the gold medal. The next four-Eugene Rogers in 2:14.2, Edwin Gilbert in 2:15.4, Robert Gibe in 2:15.6, and William Dudley in 2:15.9, were used in the Olympic prelims.Page 128 1948 US Olympic Book The next three swimmers-Joe Verdeur who came in 2:16.3, Alan Ford in 2:16.4 and George Hoogerhyde in 2:17.4 were not used in any capacity in the 4x200 freestyle relay. Four years later at the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, Wolf once again was the top qualifier in the 4x200-meter freestyle relay at the US Olympic trials. Like the trials in 1948, several top swimmers-Ford Konno, Clarke Scholes, William Woolsey, Wayne Moore and Jimmy McLane swam under their potential in the trials and failed to qualify for the final who had otherwise qualified in other events.Page 131 1952 US Olympic Book Coach Matt Mann used four of the swimmers who actually qualified in the trials for the Olympic prelim. He swam a second heat leg setting a new Olympic record of 2:11.4. For the final, Mann used Konno, Woolsey, Moore, and McLane who won the gold medal. Wolf helped the U.S. relay team to qualify for the final of the men's 4√ó200-meter freestyle relay, but, under the international swimming rule of the time, he was not awarded with a medal because he did not swim in the event final. Wolf attended the University of Southern California (USC), where he swam for the USC Trojans swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition and was a four-time All American. He graduated from USC with a bachelor's degree in 1951, and later returned to USC Law School to earn a law degree in 1957.University of Southern California, About USC. \\"A Trojan Olympic Miscellany\\".

History The Winder musket was the brainchild of Colonel C. B. Winder, who advocated marksmanship training with a rifle of similar size and weight to a service rifle but chambered in .22 rimfire, which was both economical and suitable for indoor ranges. The Winder musket was based on the Winchester Model 1885 single-shot rifle. Although it was never officially referred to as the Winder musket, the weapon was informally named in honor of Colonel C. B. Winder and has since generally been referred to as the Winder musket. Winder muskets were used for target and training purposes well into the early twentieth century. Many were purchased by the United States Ordnance, and many were issued to American N.R.A. affiliated rifle clubs. The Winder musket was superseded by the 1922 Model bolt-action training rifle, and remaining Winder muskets were sold. Design and Features The action for the Winder musket was originally developed by John Browning. Winchester bought the patent and manufacturing rights from Browning in 1883. The Winder musket featured a full stock and was chambered for .22 Short or .22 Long Rifle. It had a 28-inch barrel and an overall weight of 8.5 lbs. Variants The Winder musket was produced a \\"high wall\\" version and a \\"low wall\\" version, with the name referring to the height of the side walls of the action alongside the falling block and the hammer. There were two major high wall variants and one low wall variant. The Winder musket was also produced in both military and civilian versions.

It is found in Europe. Its natural habitat are rivers and large streams. The dragonfly flies from June to September depending on the location.  Geographical distribution  G. flavipes is a European species. It has the biggest geographical range among the European Gomphid species, occurring from France to eastern Siberia. The species has a very patchy occurrence in Central Europe and has become rare in Western Europe. The southernmost occurrence is known from Greece. In Southern Europe G. flavipes is replaced by other Gomphid species. However, the exact geographical range of the species is still unclear. Habitat G. flavipes lives along the middle and lower reaches of slow flowing medium-sized and big rivers The species prefers riverbed with mud, clay, loam or fine sand as soil, since larvae develop buried in the soil, but avoids areas with decomposition of organic matter and oxygen-poor stagnant water. Reaches with high drift and coarse substrate are also avoided, however, occasionally G. flavipes can be found in bigger lakes with high oxygen content. Morphology As a medium- sized dragonfly G. flavipes is 50‚Äì55 mm long and with an average wingspan of 70‚Äì80 mm. The eyes are widely separated, this is a typical genus-specific feature, males have blue while females have green eyes. Both sexes have predominantly yellow legs and the males has thin angled appendages, while his 10th segment is entirely black dorsally. Behaviour and life cycle G. flavipes, as all dragonflies, are predators; they capture smaller insect in flight. Imagos are rarely seen, the easiest way to observe them is in the mating period or during the emergence of young adults. Mating usually takes place in June or July. During the day adult males search for females, far from the riverbank, in low altitude above the waterfront. If they successfully catch a female copulation takes place in the shelter of water edge willows. After fertilization females fly 20‚Äì30 cm above the water and lay eggs (one at a time or in a small packets) into the water. Larval development The larvae develop for three years buried in the fine soil of the riverbed. As imagos, they are predators too, their diet consisting of small invertebrates which they capture with they specialized labium called the mask. The emergence of the larvae starts mostly at end of May or June, but it depends highly on location and other environmental circumstances (e.g. a rainy period could delay the start of emergence). The emergence in G. flavipes is often highly synchronised and it is therefore referred as a ‚Äôsummer species‚Äô, in Odonatology EM50 values are used to describe the emergence pattern (extent of synchronization). The patterns often have two peaks in G. flavipes due to the phenomenon called ‚Äôcohort splitting‚Äô. Larvae of G. flavipes, unlike other Anisoptera larvae, often choose riverbank soil as an emergence substrate, however the type of substrate depends on location and characteristics of the riverbank, probably the larvae have no substrate specific attachment.  Threat factors  G. flavipes has become an endangered species in most Western European countries due to water pollution and river regulation. The species is listed in the Annex IV of Habitats Directive.

A British force of 2,000 was surrounded by around 12,000 men of Tipu Sultan's forces. The latter were held off, albeit with heavy losses, until the arrival of reinforcements. Battle Lieutenant-General James Stuart and the Bombay Army of 6,500 under his command advanced from Cannanore, aiming to cross the Western Ghats and converge at Seringapatam with the larger Madras Army advancing from the east. He then took up a defensive position on the Anglo-Mysore frontier to await further orders from General Harris, placing his right brigade in an advanced position at Seedaseer on 2 March so as to better receive Harris's orders. This was under Lieutenant-Colonel Montressor and was made up of what are now the 1st and 2nd Maratha Light Infantry battalions and the now-defunct 1st Bombay Pioneers. He kept his other 2 brigades, the main body of his force, at Siddapura and Ahmootenaar 8 to 12 miles from Seedaseer. Receiving news of a possible Mysorean march Stuart reinforced the advanced position with one more battalion of sepoys. This advance was Tipu's main force moving to destroy the Bombay Army (whilst a small Mysorean force held off the Madras Army), and reached Seedaseer at 9am on 6 March 1799. Stuart led the Left Brigade there as reinforcements by 2pm, forcing Tipu to withdraw. The place where this battle took place was in the jagir of Nawab Subhan Khan, father of Nawab Qutub Ali Khan. This place was taken over by Government of India after Police action in 1948. Estimation The Governor-General wrote in his despatches to the British East India Company's directors \\"I am confident that your most honourable Court will be of the opinion that the conduct and success of the Army of Bombay on that day [at Seedaseer] has seldom been equalled and never surpassed.\\", and the battle's anniversary has been celebrated annually ever since as \\"Seedaseer Day\\" with regimental sports and, in the case of the 2nd Battalion, with a pageant of episodes during the battle in replicas of the 1799 uniforms.

Opened in 1975, the mall features a food court and more than 60 tenants, currently anchored solely by JCPenney. Macy's, which had two locations at Regency Square, closed in spring 2016, Sears closed in summer 2017, and JCPenney will close in fall 2020. Forever 21 closed in early 2020 as part of that brand's restructuring plan. History Regency Square opened in 1975. It was developed by Leonard Farber of Pompano Beach, FL in conjunction with local developer E. Carlton Wilton. At the mall's opening, anchor stores included JCPenney, Sears, Miller & Rhoads and Thalhimer's. Besides the addition of a food court in 1987, the mall remained largely unchanged. After Miller & Rhoads closed in 1990, Hecht's bought the location, along with three other former Miller & Rhoads stores in Virginia, and converted it to a Hecht's. Two years later, the Thalhimer's chain was also acquired by Hecht's, and as a result, the Thalhimer's became a second Hecht's location. In 1991, Wilton sold the mall to Prudential. Taubman Centers then acquired the Regency Square mall in 1997.HighBeam A children's play place was added in 2003.http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-8865008_ITM In January 2012, Taubman returned the mall to its mortgage lender to avoid foreclosure on the property. The lender hired Jones Lang LaSalle for management of the property. In February 2015, Thalhimer Realty Partners and The Rebkee Company, both local companies, bought Regency for 13.1 million. The new owners plan to revitalize the mall while keeping it focused on retail. In 2016, Macy's closed both of its stores at Regency Square as part of a nationwide closing of 40 stores. In September 2017, Sears closed its store at Regency Square as part of a nationwide closing of 16 stores. This left JCPenney as the mall's only original anchor. The same month, an overpass over one of the mall's entrances was demolished, starting work on a 30 million dollar renovation of the mall. It will remove the parking deck on the second story of the mall, making its parking space completely level. Regal Entertainment Group will move into the former Macy's spaces as well. In September 2019, Forever 21 announced that it would be closing its two-level store at Regency Square after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. On August 20, 2020, it was announced that JCPenney would also be closing in November 2020 as part of a plan to close 155 stores nationwide which will leave the mall with no anchors left.https://richmond.com/business/j-c-penney-plans-to-close-two-stores-in- virginia-including-one-in-henrico- county/article_edc0431b-c276-5400-a3e4-c1be2cdf3bb3.html Competition with other malls Regency Square faced additional retail competition in 2003, when two other malls opened nearby: Short Pump Town Center and Stony Point Fashion Park, the latter also a Taubman property.

She is best known as the author of the novels Golden Handcuffs and Poles Apart. Background In her early years, Courtney was a straight-A student who spent her free time playing a multitude of sports and playing violin with various orchestras and string quartets. She grew up in London. Courtney graduated from the University of Cambridge with a first-class degree in mechanical engineering, and worked in investment banking for two years before resigning to spend time writing her first novel based on her experiences in the City. In an interview, she claimed this was due to the strenuous hours and pressures synonymous with the banking culture. Fiction Courtney has written a number of novels. Her early novels, Golden Handcuffs and Poles Apart, were self-published, based on her experiences as an investment banker and the story of a Polish migrant acquaintance. Her publishing success earned her a three-book publishing deal with HarperCollins imprint, Avon. At the release of It's a Man's World in 2011, Courtney announced plans to return to self-publishing because she did not agree with the chick lit marketing approach used by HarperCollins. On returning to self-publishing, Courtney said in an interview that she was pleased to have regained control. Feral Youth (2013) is based on Courtney's experiences of the London riots and her concerns that more unrest would be only a matter of time.

It is operational across the aerospace, defence, nuclear, and automotive industrial sectors in the fields of manufacturing, services and transport. It was founded in 1863 as a shipping company based in Marseille, France; within its first decade of operation, it was taken over by the Daher family, who have held a controlling stake in the company for over 100 years. During the first half of the twentieth century, Daher became a specialist as transporting outsized payloads, such as railway locomotives and industrial equipment, over long distance sea routes. It was increasingly chartered to undertake challenging tasks, becoming involved in the energy and aerospace sectors to handle logistics. By the end of the century, Daher was active around the world, being contracted to undertake logistical services to a variety of heavy industries. During the twenty-first century, Daher has grown its presence within the aviation industry, acquiring both French general aviation manufacturer SOCATA and American aircraft company Quest Aircraft. In addition to manufacturing its own light aircraft range, it is also active as a subcontractor of aerostructures on behalf of several aerospace firms, including Airbus, Boeing, Dassault, and Gulfstream Aerospace. The company marked its 150 years of existence in 2013. During the 2010s, Daher launched an intensive effort to expand its footprint in the Americas. History Daher was originally established in 1863 as a shipping company based in Marseille, France, by Alphonse Barban. During 1871, the company was taken over by Paul Daher. During 1880, one of the company's ships, the Herald of Morning completed the Marseille ‚Äì San Francisco crossing in a record-breaking time of 100 days, achieved by going around the treacherous Cape Horn. During 1887, the company adopted the name Barban & DAHER. During 1920, Paul Daher's son, Gabriel, opened a branch of the firm to handle the charter sector. One year later, the firm operated its first route to the Middle East, supporting the construction of pipelines in the region; accordingly, Daher became a leader in the fast- growing energy market. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, it continued to expand its largescale transport activities. During 1930s, Daher became a specialist in the transportation of locomotives and railway rolling stock by sea. During 1972, the Daher group decided to involve itself in France's nuclear power industry, directly contributing to the construction of these nuclear power plants via the provision of three 550 tonne cranes. During the late 1980s, Daher enlarged its presence in the global logistics sector, providing services for manufacturing, distribution and supply. During 1989, Daher began to transport outsize aircraft components on behalf of the multinational Airbus consortium, carrying payloads between Southampton, England and Toulouse, France. The company took advantage of the end of the Cold War to seek out business in the east. In 1990, Daher participated in the construction of the first nuclear power plant in China built with French technology; the firm was made responsible for delivering all components to the construction site in Daya Bay. During 1994, the firm was awarded the contract to provide logistics management services for the Omsk refinery project in Siberia, Russia. During 1999, Daher took over the aerospace and defense business Lhotellier Montrichard. Two years later, high pressure pipe fabricator Lacroix Lucaero became a part of Daher Group. In 2003, thermal insulation systems Manutex was also acquired by Daher. That same year, the company secured a major logistics contract with British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce Plc to handle its RFID- based logistics system. During 2007, Daher acquired the nuclear energy logistics company Nuclear Cargo + Services (NCS), based in Hanau, Germany; this purchase marked Daher's first major push into the nuclear sector. Subsequently, the American company Transport Logistics International, Inc. became a part of the Daher group on 1 January 2010. On 27 June 2008, multinational European Aeronautic Defence and Space (EADS) announced its intention to sell a controlling interest in the general aviation manufacturer EADS Socata to Daher. On 3 November 2008, EADS and Daher announced that they had reached an agreement for Daher to acquire a 70% share of Socata. On 7 January 2009, Daher confirmed its acquisition of a majority 70% stake in SOCATA. During 2010, Daher launched its operational base in Mexico, establishing a composites manufacturing factory in Nogales. On 7 September 2011, the Daher Group announced that it was undertaking the acquisition of valve and control specialists Vanatome and Verdelet, two key players in the supply of equipment for nuclear power plants. During 2013, the Daher Group celebrated its 150 years of existence; in November of that same year, the firm announced the acquisition of the aeronautical equipment manufacturer Dyonix. Also in 2013, Daher becomes a major partner for the Airbus Helicopters H160 rotorcraft, becoming responsible designing and manufacturing the tail boom and distinctive fenestron anti-torque device. By this point, Daher was already an active aerostructures suppliers for multiple companies, including Airbus for its A350 XWB airliner, Dassault Aviation's Falcon 5x business jet, and Gulfstream Aerospace's Gulfstream G500/G600 business jet family. In 2015, Daher underwent considerable management changes; for the first time in living memory, the firm was no longer directly managed by a member of the Daher family as then-CEO Patrick Daher began to transfer his responsibilities over to David Kayat. The firm's ownership remained unchanging, the Daher family holding a controlling stake of 80 per cent, while French public investment bank BPI owned the remaining 20 per cent. During 2016, the company launched the improved TBM 930 turboprop aircraft; that same year, the 800th TBM came off the assembly line. That same year, Daher reinforces its presence in Mexico, opening a logistics base in Queretaro. By 2017, the aerospace sector accounted for roughly 80% of Daher group's overall turnover, while the remainder was generated from its engineering and logistical support contracts for the French nuclear industry. That same year, the firm announced that its on-time delivery figures to Airbus, its biggest customer at the time, had risen from 85% to 99.7%. During early 2018, the company secured its first contract with the American aerospace company Boeing to supply subassemblies for its 787 airliner; at the time, Daher's managing director, Didier Kayat, stated that it intended to be earning one third of its revenues with the Americas within five years. In June 2019, Daher announced its plan to purchase American general aviation company Quest Aircraft from Japanese firm Setouchi Holdings. During October of that year, the acquisition of Quest Aircraft was finalised, expanding Daher's North American footprint and merger its sales efforts with the former SOCATA's own.

Product planning serves as the basis for decisions about price, distribution and promotion. Product planning is the process of creating a product idea and following through on it until the product is introduced to the market. Additionally, a small company must have an exit strategy for its product in case the product does not sell. Product planning entails managing the product throughout its life using various marketing strategies, including product extensions or improvements, increased distribution, price changes and promotions. Phases of product planning =Developing the product concept= The first phase of product planning is developing the product concept. Marketing managers usually create ideas for new products by identifying certain problems that consumers face or various customers need. For example, a small computer retailer may see the need to create a computer repair division for the products it sells. After the product idea is conceived, managers will start planning the dimensions and features of the product. Some small companies will even develop a product mock-up or model. =Studying the market= The next step in the product planning process is studying the competition. Secondary research usually provides details on key competitors and their market share, which is the percent of total sales that they hold in the marketplace. The business can then determine places in which it has an advantage over the competition to identify areas of opportunity. Market research is a complex task. It must include an analysis of products that are indirect competitors products manufactured by the company observed. =Market research= A small company should consider doing both qualitative and quantitative marketing research for its new product. Focus groups are an example of qualitative information. Focus groups allow companies to ask their consumers about their likes and dislike of a product in small groups. A focus group allows the company to tweak the product concept before testing it through phone surveys‚Äîa more quantitative marketing research function. Phone surveys enables a company to test its product concept on a larger scale, the results of which are more predictable across the general population. Qualitative research is a method of inquiry employed in many different academic disciplines, traditionally in the social sciences, but also in market research and further contexts.[1] Qualitative researchers aim to gather an in-depth understanding of human behavior and the reasons that govern such behavior. The qualitative method investigates the why and how of decision making, not just what, where, when. Hence, smaller but focused samples are more often used than large samples. Quantitative research refers to the systematic empirical investigation of social phenomena via statistical, mathematical or numerical data or computational techniques.[1] The objective of quantitative research is to develop and employ mathematical models, theories and/or hypotheses pertaining to phenomena. Market research is the one stage of product planning and it can be regarded as the way to accomplish the activity though designing questions, preparing the samples, collecting data and analyzing. It also can be considered as a kind of the communications between markets as research is always question-answer form. For example, suppliers can collect buyers‚Äô suggestions and opinions through research and then get conclusion so that they can get buyers‚Äô satisfaction. In short, market research is applied to get market information, market segmentation, market trend and SWOT analysis such as consumer perceptions, market structure, distribution, past trends, strengths and weakness. The process to get these information can be divided into four parts which are definition, collection, analysis and interpretation. The steps are objectives, planning, data collection, data analysis, reporting and marketing decisions.Hague,Paul N.,2002 Thereinto, data collection is the communication process as interviewers ask some questions and shoppers answer these and marketing decisions are results of communication. Market researchers always use quantitative and qualitative research to differentiate the methods of investigation into those which are cared about getting an understanding of a subject and those which are involved in measuring things. At a word, quantitative and qualitative mean that one is based on quantity and the other one on quality. Qualitative research can be looked upon as a number of ways.(Gordon,Wendy,1943) Qualitative researchers do not need to interview so many people but they speak to really do count. The researchers are interested in asking ‚ÄòHow‚Äô questions not like ‚Äòhow many‚Äô. Sampson(1967) has said that ‚Äú it is centrally concerned with understanding things rather than with measuring them‚Äù this means that the lack of measurement can not make sure that the findings are accuracy. For example, the government has until recently used little qualitative research as it is worried that the public security would not believe these findings. Qualitative research is suited to solve the problem areas as following. The first one is basic market exploratory studies. For example, the research findings can be used to define consumer segmentations in relation to a product brand or understand the dimensions which differentiate between brands. The second one is new product development. For instance, product, packaging, positioning and advertising information can be collected through researching to confirm a new product proposition. The third one is diagnostic studies which is used to determine to what extent the brand image has changed since the start of an advertising campaign. (Gordon,Wendy,1943). The methods of qualitative research can be departed into observation and focus groups. Nowadays, observation is used wherever people think that watching is better to speaking and it plays an important role in researching people who can not articulate correctly and clearly what they think. It is frequently applied in shopping surveys particularly in-store, it regularly make customers try products and then ask them questions or do surveys. The results sometimes will be more reliable and creditable. Focus groups also can be called group discussions which is a tool on the basis of psychotherapy where it has found that if people are divided into small groups and asked to share their opinions and suggestions, they will be open up. Because there will generate a brainstorming effect in the groups so that a comment from one person can stimulate another one's ideas. Although qualitative research does not need many people to attend, one group is not enough that will cause the results are untypical. In general, there are always need four groups to cover a single respondent type. And the outcomes of group discussions are rely on the group leaders‚Äô abilities of structuring the discussion, conducting the meeting and analyzing and understanding the results. Quantitative research is about understanding aspects of a market or what kinds of customers making up the market. And it can be split into soft and hard parts. Soft part means phenomena like customer attitudes and hard part is market size, brand shares and so on. Quantitative researchers are different from qualitative researchers, they pay more attention to asking ‚ÄòWhat‚Äô questions. (Allen,Mike,1959) Quantitative research often provides three aims : description, forecasting and decision-making. (Franses,Philip Hans,1963) Quantitative market research means getting relevant information or measures from each single customer or shopper who are carrying out a census in the market. It is based on the strict sampling methods so that its data or results have levels of accuracy and can be taken to represent and stand for the population or to projecting. As the large basis will be collected in quantitative research, the types of quantitative data can be fallen into market measures, customer profiles or segmentation and attitudinal data. Firstly, market measures are used to quantify and describe a market like market size, the number of shares the suppliers or brands hold, how often does consumers purchase, schema of purchasing and so on. These data can help company or brand to plan or develop their product or marketing planning. Secondly, if a company want to plan a new product, it is necessary to know about the potential consumer base such as the age of people, what types of products or service they always use. There are various forms are included in profiling data like socio-demographics, geo-demographics customer behavior. The difference between market measures and consumer profiles is that only consumers can be the target people to collect profiling data. Thirdly, attitudinal data needs to collect the minds of individuals and then get results like awareness, beliefs, preference and so on. (Hague,Paul N.,2002) Attitude can influence behavior so that company or brand can use data to foresee customers‚Äô future behavior and then make product planning or business decision. On the other hand, there are many elements can change customers‚Äô attitude like price or appearance are changed. In a word, it is obvious that the communications between markets not only help each other to gain what they want but also develop the company or brand. It will make positive cycles between markets and then might promote the economy. Thus, both of quantitative and qualitative research can be used to do market research to do the product planning and both of them are realized through communications so they can be regarded as kinds of communications between markets. The differences between quantitative and qualitative research can be summarized that qualitative research is always open-ended, more flexible, gives consumers more creativity, pays more attention to deeper understanding so that they can get deeper data and richer ideas and quantitative research are usually statistical and numerical measurement and people will be divided into groups to get sampling or comparisons.(Gordon,Wendy,1943) =Product introduction= If the survey results prove favorable, the company may decide to sell the new product on a small scale or regional basis. During this time, the company will distribute the products in one or more cities. The company will run advertisements and sales promotions for the product, tracking sales results to determine the products potential success. If sales figures are favorable, the company will then expand distribution even further. Eventually, the company may be able to sell the product on a national basis. =Product life cycle= Product planning must also include managing the product through various stages of its product life cycle. These stages include the introduction, growth, maturity and decline stages. Sales are usually strong during the growth phase, while competition is low. However, continued success of the product will pique the interest of competitors, which will develop products of their own. The introduction of these competitive products may force a small company to lower its price. This low pricing strategy may help prevent the small company from losing market share. The company may also decide to better differentiate its product to keep its prices steady. For example, a small cell phone company may develop new, useful features on its cell phones that competitors do not have. PLC can be viewed as an important source of investment decision for the company. If a company or brand wants to make sure that its products are successful, it needs to study the product life cycle to analyze market attractiveness and supplement the conclusion before it launches a new product or enters a new market. Product life cycle (PLC) theory is used to be explain the potential life cycle of a product from design to regression and the whole life cycle can be defined as four stages : introduction, growth, maturity and decline. Product life cycle plays an important role in marketing. The first reason is that the managers will follow the four stages to make product plans for pushing out new products. Secondly, the level and growth of sales will change a lot during the four stages so the managers need to adjust the product plan appropriately and timely. The last one is that the prices and costs will decrease markedly in the early stages of the product life cycle. Marketing Science, 2004 The first stage is introduction which means it is time for a company or brand to promote its new products. The goal of introduction is to attract customers‚Äô attention as much as possible and confirm the products‚Äô initial distribution, the company does not need to worry about the competition generally as the products are new. In this stage, there will have the first communication between marketers and customers as it will be the first time for consumers to know about the new products. In addition, the cost of the things will be high like research, testing and development and the sales are low as the new products‚Äô market is small. The second stage is growth. In this stage, the new products have been accepted in the market and their sales and profits has begun to increase, the competition has happened so that the company will promote their quality to stay competitive. The products also have basic consumers‚Äô attention and can develop their loyal customers. There will have second communication as marketers can start to receive customers‚Äô feedback and then make improvements. The third stage is maturity where the sales and profit have grown slowly and will reach their peak. The competitions between companies and brands will be fierce so that the companies will go out of their ways like providing higher quality products with a lower price or thinking about any improvements to survive in the competitions and make profits maximum. The last one is decline which means the product is going to end and be discontinued. The sales of product will decrease until it is no longer in demand as it has become saturated, all the customers who want to buy this product has already got that. Then the company or brand will cut down the old products and pays attention to designing and developing the new products to gain back the customer base, stay in the markets and make profits. In conclusion, although the differences will be happened if the product life cycle theory is applied to different types of products, it is important to the marketers. Product life cycle can show the strengths and weakness of a product so that the marketers can make a product successful and avoid loss through analyzing them. A good-managed product life cycle can also help a company or brand maximize the profit and stay in the markets for a long time. On the other hand, although the product life cycle theory seems that it just about products and marketers, it has the communications between marketers and customers. The interests, needs and feedback from the customers are necessary to the product life cycle. Because only the consumers have demand and they are interested in the new products, the products can start their introduction, and marketers need to collect and analyze the feedback and then adjust and improve their products to meet consumers‚Äô needs in order to increase the sales and profits in the growth and maturity stages.

Ms. Bachman's brother, Marvin, had studied with Wright at Taliesin West, his home and studio in Scottsdale, Arizona. In 2014 the house was acquired by the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas and has been relocated in its entirety to the museum's campus. Architecture The Bachman-Wilson house is an example of Wright's invention of Usonian architecture. Wright built many of his houses around the notion of comfortable, low-cost living that fits the needs of its residents, as well as building a structure to match its environment. Wright was determined to use his new style to reinvent the previously box-like forms of early-to-mid twentieth century architecture, and create buildings that were right for modern times, as well as engaging and exciting for people to experience in a visual sense. Wright's ideas for low-cost living originated in the early twentieth century, and Wright was able to produce a large number of designs in that time. These would eventually turn into one of the largest collections of designs done by Wright in the early twentieth century. The house is a beautiful example of Wright's ongoing pursuit of the \\"destruction of the box,\\" and gives visitors a wonderful experience with its continuous open and flowing spaces and transparency. Wright's invention of the transparent corner, which can be seen in the way the tall windows meet at a corner looking out onto the back porch area of the house, allows the interior space to have an even greater sense of openness and calm. Another architectural signature of Frank Lloyd Wright is also seen in the fireplace, as it sits in the central portion of the house, making it a sort of symbolic architectural centerpiece. While it does have many features that give a sense of open space, it also has many other interesting architectural features. The front fa√ßade of concrete blocks has an almost fortress-like appearance to ensure privacy from the street. The house is built with Way-Lite concrete blocks and Philippine mahogany trim. It has a second story, rare in a Usonian house, with cantilevered balconies. The living room has a built-in banquette facing a wooded scene through a wall of 10 foot high glass panes, symbolizing a transcendental pew set before the altar of nature. The public space is a dramatic focal point, with walls of glass and an open floor plan. Cut-out wooden panels of abstracted forms over 24 clerestory windows provide an unobtrusive yet restrained decorative touch to this lavish space. These recall Native American geometric motifs as well as stylized forms that may be based in nature. Construction was completed in 1956. Gloria and Abraham Wilson were the original owners of the home, and it was later bought and restored in 1988. Sharon and Lawrence Tarantino In 1988, Sharon and Lawrence Tarantino acquired the neglected Bachman Wilson House. Tarantino Architects has since guided the home's complete restoration and rebuilt the kitchen according to Wright's original drawings. Sharon and Lawrence Tarantino have received several awards for their restoration work, including the Wright Spirit Awardhttps://savewright.org/what-we-do/wright- spirit-awards/ from the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy. The house was originally located along the Millstone River in Millstone Borough. It exemplifies Wright's \\"Usonian\\" philosophy and employs his early green building principles, including minimizing the size of the house and ancillary spaces, pioneering passive solar and radiant heat design, employing natural daylight and recycling construction waste. As its location was prone to flooding, the owners sought to relocate and rebuild it at a safer site in order to preserve it. Relocation and renovation On January 15, 2014, the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, announced that it was acquiring the Bachman‚ÄìWilson House and have made plans to relocate the house in its entirety to the museum's campus. Due to its past flooding and other circumstances, not all of the original structure could be relocated, such as the exterior concrete block wall and the stained concrete flooring, both of which have been remade by Crystal Bridges' reconstruction crew for the relocation. Despite flood damage, most of the interior of the house has been saved and can be seen and toured on the grounds of Crystal Bridges. The house is located on the south side of Crystal Bridges and is only a brief walk from the south entrance. As well as the house there is also a welcoming pavilion constructed by the Fay Jones School of Architecture from The University of Arkansas that tells visitors not only about the Bachman‚ÄìWilson House but also about Frank Lloyd Wright and his works elsewhere.

Tall-i Bakun phase A was inhabited c. 4000-3500 BCE. Four layers can be distinguished. Layer III was the best preserved and shows a settlement in which the residential buildings were built close together with no roads or paths. Individual houses consisted of several rooms. Remains of mural paintings and of wooden columns suggest a once rich interior. Richly painted pottery was produced. There were also ceramic female figurines and those of animals. There were also cylinder seals, which indicates some type of administrative activities. Artifactual remains from the site include objects made of copper, pottery and stone.Langsdorff and McCown 1942 > The wealth and variety of material items at Bakun and the evidence of large > workshop areas point to the existence of local industry and connection/trade > with distant regions such as the Persian Gulf, the central plateau, Kerman, > and northeastern Iran whence goods like shells, copper, steatite, lapis, and > turquoise were procured.

These double-chamber kilns have been in use for at least 300 years with no significant changes. A number of other kilns in the Near East share some elements of the Bakun kilns. There are close parallels with those of Tepe Gawra of the same time period. Also there are parallels with those from the Sinai Peninsula of the Egyptian New Kingdom period. Similar designs are not found elsewhere in the Levant.Abbas Alizadeh, A Protoliterate Pottery Kiln from Chogha Mish. Iran 23:39 ¬∑ January 1985. DOI: 10.2307/4299752 Bakun culture The Bakun culture flourished in the Fars Province of Iran in the fifth and early fourth millenniums BC. It had a long duration and wide geographical distribution. Its pottery tradition was as sophisticated as that of Susa I. Nevertheless, it was mostly a nomadic culture, and its settlements were typically much smaller than those of Susa. Bakun pottery is known in the Fars region in the form of bowls and jugs with green, reddish brown or deep brown bands and stripes.The Dehdaran mound: a Bakun settlement in Kazeroon, Iran Antiquity Vol 82 Issue 316 June 2008 Outside Fars this pottery has been found in northern Khuzestan,Le Breton 1943; Weiss 1976; Wright 1981 in the Bakhtiari mountains,Zagarell 1975; 1982; Nissen and Zagarell 1976 and in the Behbahan and Zuhreh regions.Nissen 1976; Dittmann 1984Abbas Alizadeh (1988), Socio-Economic Complexity in Southwestern Iran during the Fifth and Fourth Millennia B.C.: The Evidence from Tall-i Bakun A (PDF); text file is available here In the late fifth and early fourth millennia BC, Bakun A settlements were at once manufacturing sites and centres for the administration of production and trade.

Highly speculative, the railroad never had the financing necessary to begin construction. Chartered in 1897, it began to lose control of the two short lines in 1900, but continued to litigate the matter until 1909. Left a paper corporation without railroad property, it was dissolved a few years later. Charter and origins The company was chartered on October 2, 1897, to build a railroad between the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Johnstown and the Altoona and Philipsburg Connecting Railroad (A&PC;) at Ramey. The line would climb north from Johnstown along Hinkston Run to Ebensburg, and turn east to cut across the drainages to Loretto. From there, it would follow the PRR's Cresson and Irvona Branch, connecting with the Altoona and Beech Creek Railroad (A&BC;) at Dean before turning away to cross the Pennsylvania and Northwestern Railroad at Utahville and descending to Ramey. It obtained a lease of the A&PC; on October 20, 1897. The principal figure behind the line was Samuel P. Langdon, a mine owner in the Clearfield Coalfield. Rail shipments from the coalfield were almost entirely controlled by the PRR, and Langdon had already chartered and built the A&PC; and engaged in a court battle for control of the A&BC.; The PJE&E; represented an extension of Langdon's original plan to connect the two railroads, giving Altoona and the southern Clearfield Coalfield an alternative outlet to the PRR, via the Beech Creek Railroad (New York Central) at Philipsburg. Langdon's earlier battle for control of the A&BC; (then known as the Altoona, Clearfield & Northern) had ended in failure when a group of stockholders he had contracted with failed to deliver a controlling interest in the railroad. In the aftermath, he brought suit against the group, who subsequently gained control of the AC&N; after it was foreclosed and reorganized as the A&BC.; To settle the lawsuit, they leased the A&BC; to the PJE&E; on highly favorable terms. Failure Langdon's plan was speculative in the extreme. Construction south of Loretto would be difficult and the grade steep; nor was the A&BC;'s steep, twisting line into Altoona particularly suitable for heavy coal traffic. Short on funds, no construction work was done on the PJE&E; proper. It did order two narrow gauge engines for the A&BC; in 1901. In the meantime, the lease of the A&BC; was annulled by the Court of Common Pleas of Blair County in 1900, due to Langdon's failure to complete the PJE&E.; The latter company appealed to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and obtained an extension until January 1, 1902, to complete its railroad and retain the lease. It did not succeed in doing any new construction, and the Blair County sheriff ejected the PJE&E;'s officers from the A&BC; at the end of 1901. The PJE&E; did continue to operate the A&PC; from Phillipsburg to Ramey. On August 1, 1903, the PJE&E; was sold to the New York and Pittsburg Central Railroad, an unincorporated railroad run by Langdon. However, suit was brought against the company by the A&PC; bondholders, including W.L. Shellenberger, president of the A&BC; and head of the stockholders whom Langdon had sued. They sought to have the A&PC; placed in receivership, terminating the PJE&E; operation. Legal skirmishing continued for the next several years, during which Langdon sold off two of the A&PC;'s new engines. The case was finally settled in 1906, when the court ordered the A&PC; to be sold on April 1, 1906 should it default on the first mortgage payments, as it inevitably would. Legal maneuvers On April 1, it was announced that the A&PC; had been bought by the New York and Pittsburgh Air Line Railroad, which had been organized on March 22, 1906. One of the directors was John Langdon, a mine owner in Huntingdon County and probably a relative and agent of Samuel P. As the road was then in the hands of a court-appointed receiver, the NY&PAL;'s ability to carry out this transaction was highly suspect. It did briefly operate the A&PC;, which in the meantime was sold to David L. Krebs, for the bondholders; the sheriff of Clearfield County turned the railroad over to him on September 27, and it was reorganized as the Philipsburg Railroad the next year. Litigation by the NY&PAL; to regain control continued, unsuccessfully, until 1909.

The outpost was defended by a battalion of 140 men in extremely hot, inhospitable conditions against an overwhelming native force until they were forced to capitulate. Backgrond In mid-December 1839, a force consisting of 150 soldiers of the 1st Grenadiers, and 60 Irregular horses, commanded by Captain George Raitt, was dispatched from Lehri () to take possession of Kahun, the \\"capital\\" of the Marri tribe, who occupied a portion of the mountainous country east of the Bolan Pass. After their arrival, Riatt estimated there were about 400 warriors and at least 2000 \\"fighting men\\" in the town. Despite introducing themselves peacefully, Kahun's chief Dodah later heard of the intention to occupy the fort, and came in person to Riatt to discourage him from this, as the town's people already had shown hostility towards the soldiers. Captain Riatt left a detachment of 100 men posted within a mile of Kahun, and returned to join Major Billamore. Days later, with the Marri having left their habitations, and moved to the hills with their families and propriety, the town was left empty, and the detachment posted there by Riatt, now of no more use, departed and joined Billamore's men at around January 10 and 12, 1840. In April 1840, Kahun was ordered once more to be occupied. The command of the troops directed for this service was entrusted to two of the officers who had accompanied expeditions under Major Billamore ‚Äî Captain Lewis Brown and Lieutenant Walpole Clarke. On May 11, the troops arrived at the fort, now abandoned. Siege After the troops were settled, Captain Brown ordered the empty camels to be returned to Foliji () under the charge of Lieutenant Clarke, and on May 16, at 2 a.m., the return convoy departed with 80 infantry soldiers and 50 irregular horses, plus 5 havildars and 80 \\"rank and rifle\\". Finding no opposition in crossing the first hill, Clarke supposedly directed their return to Kahun. While on their way they were attacked by about 2000 balochs, and soon the escorts were overwhelmed by enemy forces. Lieutenant Clarke and most of the soldiers died, with only 12 survivors having returned to Kahun. 1893 American map showing Kahun (below the center of the image), north-northeast of Jacobabad This reduced Brown's force to 140 men, and the enemy force immediately besieged Kahun. Holding off the besieging force from May to September, Brown eventually received word from the Officer Commanding in Upper Sind to do whatever he thought best for his men's safety and so capitulated on 25 September. The Marris accorded him the honours of war, letting the small remnants of Brown's force to march out in possession of their arms, guns, ammunition, and baggage. In recognition of their conduct, the General Orders of 5 April 1841 accorded the battle honour \\"Kahun\\" to the 5th Native Infantry and in May 1841 the unit was honoured by being made \\"Light Infantry\\".

It was known as MWM GmbH Motoren- Werke Mannheim (MWM) until November 2013. In 2009 the company was the third- largest producer by revenue of gas and diesel engines. The main focus of production is gas engines and gensets for the generation of electrical energy from 400 to 10,300 kWel per unit. It also provides consulting, designing and engineering, construction and commissioning of plants as well as global after sales service. The company also has its own training center.  History  In 1922 the department for the construction of stationary engines was outsourced and had its name changed from Benz & Cie. Rheinische Gasmotorenfabrik in Mannheim to Motorenwerke Mannheim. The renowned German engineer Prosper L'Orange, a pioneer of diesel engine technology, was the technical manager then. Before that he worked for Benz & Cie. The construction of diesel engines in particular used to be the core business of MWM, amongst others for utility vehicles and agricultural machines. In 1924 MWM manufactured their first tractor, which was called Motorpferd (\\"motor horse\\"). In 1931, tractor production was discontinued. For quite a long time, combines by Claas, tractors by the French manufacturer Renault, and by the German companies Fendt, Lanz, Bautz, Holder and Ritscher, were equipped with MWM engines. In 1926 Knorr-Bremse AG was able to acquire the majority of shares and took over. In 1985 they sold MWM to Deutz AG (Cologne). The company's site was maintained. The company, along with MAN SE, remained the chief engine manufacturer in the field of commercial diesel engines in Germany. DEUTZ restructured the whole company several times and expanded the gas engine division. MWM was known as Deutz Power Systems at the time 3i purchased it.

Formed in 1984, they have released 16 albums.  History  Backstreet Girls formed in 1984 and were influenced by the Ramones and Rose Tattoo. The band was formed in 1984 by brothers P√•l Kristensen on bass and Tom Kristensen on vocals. They were joined by guitarist Petter Baarli, formerly of the band Riff/Raff, and his brother, drummer Bj√∏rn Terje Baarli. In 1985 Tom Kristensen left the band, to be replaced by Arne Aarnes. Later that year they started writing and recording their first album, and also contributed to the Norwegian film X. In 1986 they released their debut album Mental Shakedown on the small independent label Medicine Records. The album was released on a very limited press at first, but was re-released three years later on Polygram Records. Later that year Arne Aarnes left the band, and was replaced by Bj√∏rn M√ºller of the band Z-off. The line-up of Petter Baarli, P√•l Kristensen, Bj√∏rn Terje Baarli and Bj√∏rn M√ºller remained for the subsequent three albums, Boogie Till' You Puke, Party On Elmstreet and Coming Down Hard. In May 1991 Bj√∏rn M√ºller left the band, and was replaced by the band's fourth vocalist, Ole Hillborg, formerly of Glorius Bankrobbers. The album Let's Have It was released in October 1992 on Warner Music. In 1993 the band released a live album Live - Get Yer Yo-Yo's Out, and Ole Hillborg left the band shortly thereafter. After this The Backstreet Girls went to England to hold auditions for another lead singer. They chose Irishman Pat Diamond, and returned to Norway to perform some concerts and record an album. The album Don't Fake It Too Long was not released until 2008 . However, Diamond was soon deported from Norway, and by 1995 Bj√∏rn M√ºller had rejoined the band as lead vocalist. In 1997 the 7\\" single \\"Monster In My Caddillac\\" was released on Hit!Me Records, but another album was not to appear until 1999, six years after the previous one, when the album Hellway To High was released on FaceFront Records. In October 1999 bassist P√•l Kristensen left the band to be replaced by Morten Lunde, of The Mormones. In November 2000 Universal Records released a greatest hits compilation entitled Boogie Till' You Bleed. In March 2001 the band released their eight studio album, Tuff Tuff Tuff, on FaceFront Records, and that summer went on a tour of Europe with Australian band Rose Tattoo, a long-time influence on the Backstreet Girls. Live recordings of these concerts were released in September 2002 on the album Black Boogie Death Rock N' Roll featuring six live recordings from the tour and six new songs. At the end of 2002 Morten Lunde left the band to concentrate on his other band, The Mormones, and Dan Thunderbird was recruited on bass. In 2003 the band recorded another album in between touring. The album was released in June on Facefront Records, entitled Sick My Duck. The band embarked on a Norwegian tour of over 20 dates called \\"Boogie My Life Away Tour\\".

The curve is wiggly because of absorption bands in the atmosphere. In the original paper, the solar spectrum was approximated by a smooth curve, the 6000K blackbody spectrum. As a result, the efficiency graph was smooth and the values were slightly different. In physics, the Shockley‚ÄìQueisser limit (also known as the detailed balance limit, Shockley Queisser Efficiency Limit or SQ Limit, or in physical terms the radiative efficiency limit) is the maximum theoretical efficiency of a solar cell using a single p-n junction to collect power from the cell where the only loss mechanism is radiative recombination in the solar cell. It was first calculated by William Shockley and Hans-Joachim Queisser at Shockley Semiconductor in 1961, giving a maximum efficiency of 30% at 1.1 eV. This first calculation used the 6000K black-body spectrum as an approximation to the solar spectrum. Subsequent calculations have used measured global solar spectra (AM1.5G) and included a back surface mirror which increases the maximum efficiency to 33.7% for a solar cell with a bandgap of 1.34 eV. The limit is one of the most fundamental to solar energy production with photovoltaic cells, and is considered to be one of the most important contributions in the field. The limit is that the maximum solar conversion efficiency is around 33.7% for a single p-n junction photovoltaic cell, assuming typical sunlight conditions (unconcentrated, AM 1.5 solar spectrum), and subject to other caveats and assumptions discussed below. This maximum occurs at a band gap of 1.34 eV. That is, of all the power contained in sunlight (about 1000 W/m2) falling on an ideal solar cell, only 33.7% of that could ever be turned into electricity (337 W/m2). The most popular solar cell material, silicon, has a less favorable band gap of 1.1 eV, resulting in a maximum efficiency of about 32%. Modern commercial mono-crystalline solar cells produce about 24% conversion efficiency, the losses due largely to practical concerns like reflection off the front of the cell and light blockage from the thin wires on the cell surface. The Shockley‚ÄìQueisser limit only applies to conventional solar cells with a single p-n junction; solar cells with multiple layers can (and do) outperform this limit, and so can solar thermal and certain other solar energy systems. In the extreme limit, for a multi-junction solar cell with an infinite number of layers, the corresponding limit is 86.8% using concentrated sunlight. (See Solar cell efficiency.) Background The Shockley‚ÄìQueisser limit, zoomed in near the region of peak efficiency. In a traditional solid-state semiconductor such as silicon, a solar cell is made from two doped crystals, one an n-type semiconductor, which has extra free electrons, and the other a p-type semiconductor, which is lacking free electrons, referred to as \\"holes.\\" When initially placed in contact with each other, some of the electrons in the n-type portion will flow into the p-type to \\"fill in\\" the missing electrons. Eventually enough will flow across the boundary to equalize the Fermi levels of the two materials. The result is a region at the interface, the p-n junction, where charge carriers are depleted on each side of the interface. In silicon, this transfer of electrons produces a potential barrier of about 0.6 V to 0.7 V. When the material is placed in the sun, photons from the sunlight can be absorbed in the p-type side of the semiconductor, causing electrons in the valence band to be promoted in energy to the conduction band. This process is known as photoexcitation. As the name implies, electrons in the conduction band are free to move about the semiconductor. When a load is placed across the cell as a whole, these electrons will flow from the p-type side into the n-type side, lose energy while moving through the external circuit, and then go back into the p-type material where they can re-combine with the valence- band holes they left behind. In this way, sunlight creates an electric current. The limit The Shockley‚ÄìQueisser limit is calculated by examining the amount of electrical energy that is extracted per photon of incoming sunlight. There are several considerations: =Blackbody radiation= Any material, that is not at absolute zero (0 Kelvin), emits electromagnetic radiation through the black-body radiation effect. In a cell at room temperature, this represents approximately 7% of all the energy falling on the cell. Any energy lost in a cell is turned into heat, so any inefficiency in the cell increases the cell temperature when it is placed in sunlight. As the temperature of the cell increases, the outgoing radiation and heat loss through conduction and convection also increase, until an equilibrium is reached. In practice, this equilibrium is normally reached at temperatures as high as 360 Kelvin, and consequently, cells normally operate at lower efficiencies than their room-temperature rating. Module datasheets normally list this temperature dependency as (NOCT - Nominal Operating Cell Temperature). For a \\"blackbody\\" at normal temperatures, a very small part of this radiation (the number per unit time and per unit area given by , \\"c\\" for \\"cell\\") is photons having energy greater than the band gap (wavelength less than about 1.1 microns for silicon), and part of these photons (Shockley and Queisser use the factor tc) are generated by recombination of electrons and holes, which decreases the amount of current that could be generated otherwise. This is a very small effect, but Shockley and Queisser assume that the total rate of recombination (see below) when the voltage across the cell is zero (short circuit or no light) is proportional to the blackbody radiation . This rate of recombination plays a negative role in the efficiency. Shockley and Queisser calculate to be 1700 photons per second per square centimetre for silicon at 300K. =Recombination= Black curve: The limit for open-circuit voltage in the Shockley‚ÄìQueisser model (i.e., voltage at zero current). The red dotted line shows that this voltage is always below the bandgap. This voltage is limited by recombination. Absorption of a photon creates an electron-hole pair, which could potentially contribute to the current. However, the reverse process must also be possible, according to the principle of detailed balance: an electron and a hole can meet and recombine, emitting a photon. This process reduces the efficiency of the cell. Other recombination processes may also exist (see \\"Other considerations\\" below), but this one is absolutely required. In the Shockley‚ÄìQueisser model, the recombination rate depends on the voltage across the cell but is the same whether or not there is light falling on the cell. A factor fc gives the ratio of recombination that produces radiation to total recombination, so the rate of recombination per unit area when V = 0 is 2tcQc/fc and thus depends on Qc, the flux of blackbody photons above the band-gap energy. The factor of 2 was included on the assumption that radiation emitted by the cell goes in both directions. (This is actually debatable if a reflective surface is used on the shady side.) When the voltage is non-zero, the concentrations of charge carriers (electrons and holes) change (see Shockley diode equation), and according to the authors the rate of recombination changes by a factor of exp(V/Vc), where Vc is the voltage equivalent of the temperature of the cell, or \\"thermal voltage\\", namely :V_c=kT_c/q (q being the charge of an electron). Thus the rate of recombination, in this model, is proportional to exp(V/Vc) times the blackbody radiation above the band-gap energy: :\\\\int_{ u_g}^\\\\infty\\\\frac 1{\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{h u}{kT_c}\\\\right)-1}e^\\\\frac{qV}{kT_c}\\\\frac{2\\\\pi u^2}{c^2}d u (This is actually an approximation, correct so long as the cell is thick enough to act as a black body, to the more accurate expression This paper finds the same open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current as de Vos and Pauwels, but does not give the correct function for . :\\\\int_{ u_g}^\\\\infty\\\\frac 1{\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{h u- qV}{kT_c}\\\\right)-1}\\\\frac{2\\\\pi u^2}{c^2}d u, The difference in maximum theoretical efficiency however is negligibly small, except for tiny bandgaps below 200meV.) The rate of generation of electron-hole pairs not due to incoming sunlight stays the same, so recombination minus spontaneous generation is I_0[\\\\exp(V/V_c)-1]. where I_0=2qt_cQ_c/f_c. (Shockley and Queisser take fc to be a constant, although they admit that it may itself depend on voltage.) The rate of generation of electron-hole pairs due to sunlight is :I_{sh}=q(t_sf_\\\\omega Q_s-2t_cQ_c) where f_\\\\omega Q_s is the number of photons above the band-gap energy falling on the cell per unit area, and ts is the fraction of these that generate an electron-hole pair. This rate of generation is called Ish because it is the \\"short circuit\\" current (per unit area). When there is a load, then V will not be zero and we have a current equal to the rate of generation of pairs due to the sunlight minus the difference between recombination and spontaneous generation: :I=I_{sh}-I_0[\\\\exp(V/V_c)-1]. The open-circuit voltage is therefore given (assuming fc does not depend on voltage) by :V_{oc}=V_c\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{I_{sh}}{I_0}+1\\\\right). The product of the short- circuit current Ish and the open-circuit voltage Voc Shockley and Queisser call the \\"nominal power\\". It is not actually possible to get this amount of power out of the cell, but we can get close (see \\"Impedance matching\\" below). The ratio of the open-circuit voltage to the band-gap voltage Shockley and Queisser call V. Under open-circuit conditions, we have :\\\\ln I_{sh}=\\\\ln I_0+\\\\ln[\\\\exp(V/V_c)-1]. Asymptotically, this gives :-V_g/V_s\\\\sim-V_g/V_c+V/V_c or :V/V_g\\\\sim1-V_c/V_s where is the voltage equivalent of the temperature of the sun. As the ratio goes to zero, the open-circuit voltage goes to the band- gap voltage, and as it goes to one, the open-circuit voltage goes to zero. This is why the efficiency falls if the cell heats up. In fact this expression represents the thermodynamic upper limit of the amount of work that can be obtained from a heat source at the temperature of the sun and a heat sink at the temperature of the cell. =Spectrum losses= Since the act of moving an electron from the valence band to the conduction band requires energy, only photons with more than that amount of energy will produce an electron-hole pair. In silicon the conduction band is about 1.1 eV away from the valence band, this corresponds to infrared light with a wavelength of about 1.1 microns. In other words, photons of red, yellow and blue light and some near- infrared will contribute to power production, whereas radio waves, microwaves, and most infrared photons will not.C. S. Solanki and G. Beaucarne, \\"Advanced Solar Cell Concepts\\", Interuniversity Microelectronics Center, Belgium This places an immediate limit on the amount of energy that can be extracted from the sun. Of the 1,000 W/m2 in AM1.5 sunlight, about 19% of that has less than 1.1 eV of energy, and will not produce power in a silicon cell. Another important contributor to losses is that any energy above and beyond the bandgap energy is lost. While blue light has roughly twice the energy of red light, that energy is not captured by devices with a single p-n junction. The electron is ejected with higher energy when struck by a blue photon, but it loses this extra energy as it travels toward the p-n junction (the energy is converted into heat). This accounts for about 33% of the incident sunlight, meaning that, for silicon, from spectrum losses alone there is a theoretical conversion efficiency limit of about 48%, ignoring all other factors. There is a trade-off in the selection of a bandgap. If the band gap is large, not as many photons create pairs, whereas if the band gap is small, the electron-hole pairs do not contain as much energy. Shockley and Queisser call the efficiency factor associated with spectrum losses , for \\"ultimate efficiency function\\". Shockley and Queisser calculated that the best band gap for sunlight happens to be 1.1 eV, the value for silicon, and gives a of 44%. They used blackbody radiation of 6000K for sunlight, and found that the optimum band gap would then have an energy of 2.2 kTs. (At that value, 22% of the blackbody radiation energy would be below the band gap.) Using a more accurate spectrum may give a slightly different optimum. A blackbody at 6000 K puts out 7348 W per square centimetre, so a value for of 44% and a value of photons per joule (corresponding to a band gap of 1.09 V, the value used by Shockley and Queisser) gives equal to photons per second per square centimetre. =Impedance matching= If the resistance of the load is too high, the current will be very low, while if the load resistance is too low, the voltage drop across it will be very low. There is an optimal load resistance that will draw the most power from the solar cell at a given illumination level. Shockley and Queisser call the ratio of power extracted to the impedance matching factor, . (It is also called the fill factor.) The optimum depends on the shape of the versus curve. For very low illumination, the curve is more or less a diagonal line, and will be 1/4. But for high illumination, approaches 1. Shockley and Queisser give a graph showing as a function of the ratio of the open-circuit voltage to the thermal voltage . According to the authors, this ratio is well approximated by , where is the combination of factors , in which is the solid angle of the sun divided by œÄ. The maximum value of without light concentration (with reflectors for example) is just , or , according to the authors. Using the above-mentioned values of and , this gives a ratio of open-circuit voltage to thermal voltage of 32.4 ( equal to 77% of the band gap). The authors derive the equation :z_{oc}=z_m+\\\\ln(1+z_m) which can be solved to find , the ratio of optimal voltage to thermal voltage. For a of 32.4, we find equal to 29.0. One can then use the formula :m=\\\\frac{z_m^2/z_{oc}}{1+z_m-\\\\exp(-z_m)} to find the impedance matching factor. For a of 32.4, this comes to 86.5%. =All together= Considering the spectrum losses alone, a solar cell has a peak theoretical efficiency of 48% (or 44% according to Shockley and Queisser ‚Äì their \\"ultimate efficiency factor\\"). Thus the spectrum losses represent the vast majority of lost power. Including the effects of recombination and the I versus V curve, the efficiency is described by the following equation: :\\\\eta=t_su(x_g)v(f,x_c,x_g)m(vx_g/x_c) with :x_g=V_g/V_s :x_c=V_c/V_s where , , and are respectively the ultimate efficiency factor, the ratio of open- circuit voltage to band-gap voltage, and the impedance matching factor (all discussed above). Letting be 1, and using the values mentioned above of 44%, 77%, and 86.5% for the three factors gives about 29% overall efficiency. Shockley and Queisser say 30% in their abstract, but do not give a detailed calculation. A more recent reference gives, for a single-junction cell, a theoretical peak performance of about 33.7%, or about 337 W/m2 in AM1.5. When the amount of sunlight is increased using reflectors or lenses, the factor (and therefore ) will be higher. This raises both and . Shockley and Queisser include a graph showing the overall efficiency as a function of band gap for various values of . For a value of 1, the graph shows a maximum efficiency of just over 40%, getting close to the ultimate efficiency (by their calculation) of 44%. =Other considerations= Shockley and Queisser's work considered the most basic physics only; there are a number of other factors that further reduce the theoretical power. Limited mobility When an electron is ejected through photoexcitation, the atom it was formerly bound to is left with a net positive charge. Under normal conditions, the atom will pull off an electron from a surrounding atom in order to neutralize itself. That atom will then attempt to remove an electron from another atom, and so forth, producing an ionization chain reaction that moves through the cell. Since these can be viewed as the motion of a positive charge, it is useful to refer to them as \\"holes\\", a sort of virtual positive electron. Like electrons, holes move around the material, and will be attracted towards a source of electrons. Normally these are provided through an electrode on the back surface of the cell. Meanwhile, the conduction-band electrons are moving forward towards the electrodes on the front surface. For a variety of reasons, holes in silicon move much more slowly than electrons. This means that during the finite time while the electron is moving forward towards the p-n junction, it may meet a slowly moving hole left behind by a previous photoexcitation. When this occurs, the electron recombines at that atom, and the energy is lost (normally through the emission of a photon of that energy, but there are a variety of possible processes). Recombination places an upper limit on the rate of production; past a certain rate there are so many holes in motion that new electrons will never make it to the p-n junction. In silicon this reduces the theoretical performance under normal operating conditions by another 10% over and above the thermal losses noted above. Materials with higher electron (or hole) mobility can improve on silicon's performance; gallium arsenide (GaAs) cells gain about 5% in real-world examples due to this effect alone. In brighter light, when it is concentrated by mirrors or lenses for example, this effect is magnified. Normal silicon cells quickly saturate, while GaAs continue to improve at concentrations as high as 1500 times. Non-radiative recombination Recombination between electrons and holes is detrimental in a solar cell, so designers try to minimize it. However, radiative recombination‚Äîwhen an electron and hole recombine to create a photon that exits the cell into the air‚Äîis inevitable, because it is the time-reversed process of light absorption. Therefore, the Shockley‚ÄìQueisser calculation takes radiative recombination into account; but it assumes (optimistically) that there is no other source of recombination. More realistic limits, which are lower than the Shockley‚ÄìQueisser limit, can be calculated by taking into account other causes of recombination. These include recombination at defects and grain boundaries. In crystalline silicon, even if there are no crystalline defects, there is still Auger recombination, which occurs much more often than radiative recombination. By taking this into account, the theoretical efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells was calculated to be 29.4%. Exceeding the limit Breakdown of the causes for the Shockley‚ÄìQueisser limit. The black height is energy that can be extracted as useful electrical power (the Shockley‚ÄìQueisser efficiency limit); the pink height is energy of below-bandgap photons; the green height is energy lost when hot photogenerated electrons and holes relax to the band edges; the blue height is energy lost in the tradeoff between low radiative recombination versus high operating voltage. Designs that exceed the Shockley‚ÄìQueisser limit work by overcoming one or more of these three loss processes. It is important to note that the analysis of Shockley and Queisser was based on the following assumptions: # One electron‚Äìhole pair excited per incoming photon # Thermal relaxation of the electron‚Äìhole pair energy in excess of the band gap # Illumination with non- concentrated sunlight None of these assumptions is necessarily true, and a number of different approaches have been used to significantly surpass the basic limit. =Tandem cells= The most widely explored path to higher efficiency solar cells has been multijunction photovoltaic cells, also known as \\"tandem cells\\". These cells use multiple p-n junctions, each one tuned to a particular frequency of the spectrum. This reduces the problem discussed above, that a material with a single given bandgap cannot absorb sunlight below the bandgap, and cannot take full advantage of sunlight far above the bandgap. In the most common design, a high-bandgap solar cell sits on top, absorbing high-energy, shorter-wavelength light, and transmitting the rest. Beneath it is a lower-bandgap solar cell which absorbs some of the lower- energy, longer-wavelength light. There may be yet another cell beneath that one, with as many as four layers in total. The calculation of the fundamental efficiency limits of these multijunction cells works in a fashion similar to those for single-junction cells, with the caveat that some of the light will be converted to other frequencies and re-emitted within the structure. Using methods similar to the original Shockley‚ÄìQueisser analysis with these considerations in mind produces similar results; a two-layer cell can reach 42% efficiency, three-layer cells 49%, and a theoretical infinity-layer cell 68% in non-concentrated sunlight. The majority of tandem cells that have been produced to date use three layers, tuned to blue (on top), yellow (middle) and red (bottom). These cells require the use of semiconductors that can be tuned to specific frequencies, which has led to most of them being made of gallium arsenide (GaAs) compounds, often germanium for red, GaAs for yellow, and GaInP2 for blue. They are very expensive to produce, using techniques similar to microprocessor construction but with \\"chip\\" sizes on the scale of several centimeters. In cases where outright performance is the only consideration, these cells have become common; they are widely used in satellite applications for instance, where the power-to-weight ratio overwhelms practically every other consideration. They also can be used in concentrated photovoltaic applications (see below), where a relatively small solar cell can serve a large area. Tandem cells are not restricted to high-performance applications; they are also used to make moderate-efficiency photovoltaics out of cheap but low-efficiency materials. One example is amorphous silicon solar cells, where triple-junction tandem cells are commercially available from Uni-Solar and other companies. =Light concentration= Sunlight can be concentrated with lenses or mirrors to much higher intensity. The sunlight intensity is a parameter in the Shockley‚ÄìQueisser calculation, and with more concentration, the theoretical efficiency limit increases somewhat. If, however, the intense light heats up the cell, which often occurs in practice, the theoretical efficiency limit may go down all things considered. In practice, the choice of whether or not to use light concentration is based primarily on other factors besides the small change in solar cell efficiency. These factors include the relative cost per area of solar cells versus focusing optics like lenses or mirrors, the cost of sunlight-tracking systems, the proportion of light successfully focused onto the solar cell, and so on. A wide variety of optical systems can be used to concentrate sunlight, including ordinary lenses and curved mirrors, fresnel lenses, arrays of small flat mirrors, and luminescent solar concentrators.Elizabeth A. Thomson, \\"MIT opens new 'window' on solar energy\\", MIT News, 10 July 2008 Another proposal suggests spreading out an array of microscopic solar cells on a surface, and focusing light onto them via microlens arrays, while yet another proposal suggests designing a semiconductor nanowire array in such a way that light is concentrated in the nanowires. =Intermediate band photovoltaics= There has been some work on producing mid-energy states within single crystal structures. These cells would combine some of the advantages of the multi-junction cell with the simplicity of existing silicon designs. A detailed limit calculation for these cells with infinite bands suggests a maximum efficiency of 77.2% To date, no commercial cell using this technique has been produced. =Photon upconversion= As discussed above, photons with energy below the bandgap are wasted in ordinary single-junction solar cells. One way to reduce this waste is to use photon upconversion, i.e. incorporating into the module a molecule or material that can absorb two or more below-bandgap photons and then emit one above-bandgap photon. Another possibility is to use two-photon absorption, but this can only work at extremely high light concentration. =Thermal photon upconversion= Thermal upconversion is based on the absorption of photons with low energies in the upconverter, which heats up and re-emits photons with higher energies. The upconversion efficiency can be improved by controlling the optical density of states of the absorber and also by tuning the angularly-selective emission characteristics. For example, a planar thermal upconverting platform can have a front surface that absorbs low-energy photons incident within a narrow angular range, and a back surface that efficiently emits only high-energy photons. A hybrid thermophotovoltaic platform exploiting thermal upconversion was theoretically predicted to demonstrate maximum conversion efficiency of 73% under illumination by non- concentrated sunlight. A detailed analysis of non-ideal hybrid platforms that allows for up to 15% of absorption/re-emission losses yielded limiting efficiency value of 45% for Si PV cells. =Hot electron capture= One of the main loss mechanisms is due to the loss of excess carrier energy above the bandgap. It should be no surprise that there has been a considerable amount of research into ways to capture the energy of the carriers before they can lose it in the crystal structure.Gavin Conibeer et all, \\"Hot Carrier Solar Cell: Implementation of the Ultimate Photovoltaic Converter\\", Global Climate & Energy Project, Stanford University, September 2008 One system under investigation for this is quantum dots.A. J. Nozik, \\"Quantum Dot Solar Cells\\", National Renewable Energy Laboratory, October 2001 =Multiple exciton generation= A related concept is to use semiconductors that generate more than one excited electron per absorbed photon, instead of a single electron at the band edge. Quantum dots have been extensively investigated for this effect, and they have been shown to work for solar-relevant wavelengths in prototype solar cells. Another, more straightforward way to utilise multiple exciton generation is a process called singlet fission (or singlet exciton fission) by which a singlet exciton is converted into two triplet excitons of lower energy. This allows for higher theoretical efficiencies when coupled to a low bandgap semiconductor and quantum efficiencies exceeding 100% have been reported. Also in materials where the (excited) electrons interact strongly with the remaining electrons such as Mott insulators multiple excitons can be generated. = Fluorescent downconversion/downshifting= Another possibility for increased efficiency is to convert the frequency of light down towards the bandgap energy with a fluorescent material. In particular, to exceed the Shockley‚ÄìQueisser limit, it is necessary for the fluorescent material to convert a single high-energy photon into several lower-energy ones (quantum efficiency > 1). For example, one photon with more than double the bandgap energy can become two photons above the bandgap energy. In practice, however, this conversion process tends to be relatively inefficient. If a very efficient system were found, such a material could be painted on the front surface of an otherwise standard cell, boosting its efficiency for little cost.\\"Sunovia, EPIR Demonstrate Optical Down-Conversion For Solar Cells\\" In contrast, considerable progress has been made in the exploration of fluorescent downshifting, which converts high-energy light (e. g., UV light) to low-energy light (e. g., red light) with a quantum efficiency smaller than 1. The cell may be more sensitive to these lower-energy photons. Dyes, rare- earth phosphors and quantum dots are actively investigated for fluorescent downshifting. For example, silicon quantum dots enabled downshifting has led to the efficiency enhancement of the state-of-the-art silicon solar cells. =Thermophotovoltaic downconversion= Thermophotovoltaic cells are similar to phosphorescent systems, but use a plate to act as the downconvertor. Solar energy falling on the plate, typically black-painted metal, is re-emitted as lower-energy IR, which can then be captured in an IR cell. This relies on a practical IR cell being available, but the theoretical conversion efficiency can be calculated. For a converter with a bandgap of 0.92 eV, efficiency is limited to 54% with a single-junction cell, and 85% for concentrated light shining on ideal components with no optical losses and only radiative recombination.

It is near Eluan Village in the township of Hengchun in Pingtung County, Taiwan. The lighthouse is open to the public all year around. Names The lighthouse is named after nearby Cape Eluanbi, the southernmost point on Formosa or Taiwan Island. The name also appears as Eluan and ; as Oluenpi. and from its Wade- Giles romanization; and as Garanbi or Garambi from its Japanese pronunciation. Eluanbi Lighthouse is also known as \\"The Light of East Asia\\" because its light is the most intense of those on Taiwan. History =Qing Empire= Shipwrecks were common around Cape Eluanbi in the early modern era owing to the nearby Qixingyan reefs and strong currents. The hostile native reactions to these accidents rose to the level of international incidents in the case of the Rover and a Ryukyu convoy, which prompted invasions from the United States and Japan in 1867 and 1874. In the latter case, the Qing Dynasty explicitly disavowed responsibility for native-held areas on Taiwan Island, creating a power vacuum that threatened Japanese or European colonization of the region. Following the advice of Charles Le Gendre, the American consul at Xiamen (then known as \\"Amoy\\"), the Viceroy of Liangjiang, Shen Baozhen, began constructing coastal defenses to improve the situation. Construction of the Eluanbi Lighthouse fell under the purview of the British diplomat Robert Hart, inspector general of the Imperial Maritime Customs Service. He sent agents to purchase the southern cape from the leaders of the Guƒ´z«éiji«éo) in 1875. Construction began in 1881. Although Shen largely favored French officers like Prosper Giquel, Hart placed construction of the Eluanbi works under the English engineer John Ropinald and architect W. F. Spindey. Wang Fulu W√°ng F√∫l√π) oversaw the project and the 500 soldiers sent to protect it. Native opposition from the Paiwan and other local aboriginal tribes was severe and sustained. The structure was the only armed lighthouse on the island, surrounded by a fosse provided with caponiers and barbed-wire fencing. It was riddled with gunports to allow its garrison to repel assaults. Work was finished in early 1883 and the tower began operation on 1April. The total cost was 71,248 Mexican dollars,. more than 200,000 silver taels. ¬£5,881 were used for the tower and fort; ¬£3,223 for the light and its housing. A great deal of the rest was used for dynamiting the coral around a nearby creek and constructing a concrete jetty for landing personnel and supplies; the jetty had proved necessary because of the difficult landing at Eluanbi's beaches owing to their heavy swells. George Taylor assisted with construction after its first year and served as its first lightkeeper until 1889. He maintained close relations with the Paiwan and even became proficient in their language, but was also protected by 16 Chinese soldiers under a German officer. Their arsenal included two 18-pounder cannons, two Gatling guns, and a Cohon mortar; and they maintained food and water provisions capable of lasting a three-month siege. The station also kept a team of laborers and kitchen staff on site. The first tower was high and cast iron. It was in diameter at the base and at the top. The lantern included revolving steel shutters to protect the glass from attack, and its gallery included gunports for rifles and one of the fort's Gatling guns. The foreign staff had spacious brick bungalows whose rooms were connected by bulletproof corridors to the fort; they stayed in quarters inside the tower during assaults. The Chinese staff lived in the fort at all times and maintained its kitchen, armory, storerooms, and underground cisterns. The garrison was later reduced to eight men. =Imperial Japan= During the First Sino-Japanese War, the lighthouse was severely damaged by attack and then from sabotage by its retreating Qing garrison. After the Treaty of Shimonoseki gave Japan control of the island, colonial officials first repaired the lighthouse in 1898 and then installed a stronger light in 1910. During World War II, the lighthouse was again seriously damaged by American bombing. =Republic of China= The lighthouse was rebuilt by the Republic of China in 1947.. It was refurbished with a powerful Fresnel lens in 1962. The surrounding Eluanbi Park opened to the public on 25 December 1982 and the lighthouse itself welcomed regular visitors ten years later. On the memorial to Eluanbi Lighthouse as one of the 8 Views of Taiwan, the Chinese \\"Eluanbi\\" is sculpted into the surface in Wang Xizhi's calligraphic style.

Provisions  The act consists of 5 chapters spread across 31 sections. = Chapter I: Preliminary = This chapter contains sections describing title, territorial extent, basic definitions, etc. Two of the main definitions are \\"public servant\\" and \\"undue advantage\\". Following are some sections:  Section 3: Appointment of special Judges  Power To Appoint Special Judges: The Central and the State Government is empowered to appoint Special Judges by placing a Notification in the Official Gazette, to try the following offences: ¬∑ Any offence punishable under this Act. ¬∑ Any conspiracy to commit or any attempt to commit or any abetment of any of the offences specified under the Act. The qualification for the Special Judge is that he should be or should have been a Session Judge or an Additional Session Judge or Assistant Session Judge under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973  Section 4: Cases triable by special Judges  The offences punishable under this act can be tried by special Judges only. When trying any case, the special Judge is empowered to try any offence other than an offence punishable under this act, with which the accused may be charged at the same trial. It is recommended that the special Judge should hold the trial daily. Case Trial By Special Judges: Every offence mentioned in Section 3(1)shall be tried by the Special Judge for the area within which it was committed. When trying any case, a Special Judge may also try any offence other than what is specified in S. 3, which the accused may be, under Cr.P.C. be charged at the same trial. The Special Judge has to hold the trial of an offence on day-to-day basis. However, while complying with foretasted, it is to be seen that the Cr.P.C. is not bifurcated.  Section 5: Procedure and powers of special Judge  The following are the powers of the Special Judge: He may take cognizance of the offences without the accused being commissioned to him for trial. In trying the accused persons, shall follow the procedure prescribed by the Cr.P.C. for the trial of warrant cases by Magistrate. he may with a view to obtain the evidence of any person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to an offence, tender pardon to such person provided that he would make full and true disclosure of the whole circumstances within his knowledge or in respect to any person related to the offence. Except as for S. 2(1), the provisions of Cr.P.C. shall apply to the proceedings before a Special Judge. Hence, the court of the Special Judge shall be deemed to be a Court of Session and the person conducting a prosecution before a Special Judge shall be deemed to be a public prosecutor. The provisions of secs. 326 and 475of the Cr.P.C. shall apply to the proceedings before a Special Judge and for purpose of the said provisions, a Special Judge shall be deemed to be a magistrate. A Special Judge may pass a sentence authorized by law for the punishment of the offence of which a person is convicted. A Special Judge, while trying any offence punishable under the Act, shall exercise all powers and functions exercised by a District Judge under the Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance,1944. Power to try summarily: Where a Special Judge tries any offence specified in Sec. 3(1), alleged to have been committed by a public servant in relation to the contravention of any special order referred to in Sec.12-A(1) of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 or all orders referred to in sub-section (2)(a) of that section then the special judge shall try the offence in a summarily way and the provisions of s. 262 to 265 (both inclusive) of the said code shall as far as may be apply to such trial. Provided that in the case of any conviction in a summary trial under this section this shall be lawful for the Special Judge to pass a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year. However, when at the commencement of or in the course of a summary trial it appears to the Special Judge that the nature of the case is such that a sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding one year may have to be passed or it is undesirable to try the case summarily, the Special judge shall record all order to that effect and thereafter recall any witnesses who may have been examined and proceed to hear and re-hear the case in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the said code for the trial of warrant cases by Magistrates. Moreover, there shall be no appeal by a convicted person in any case tried summarily under this section in which the Special Judge passes a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding one month and of fine not exceeding Rs. 2000. = Chapter III: Offences and penalties = The following are the offences under the PCA along with their punishments:- Obtaining an undue advantage, with the intention to perform or cause performance of public duty improperly or dishonestly, etc., and if the public servant is found guilty, he shall be punishable with imprisonment which shall be not less than 3 years but which may extend to 5 years and shall also be liable to fine. * Taking gratification in order to influence public servant, by corrupt or illegal means, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than three year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine. * Taking gratification, for exercise of personal influence with public servant shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than six months but which may extend to five years and shall also be liable to fine. * Abetment by public servant of offences defined in Section 8 or 9, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not les than six months but which may extend to five years and shall also be liable to fine. * Public servant obtaining valuable thing without consideration from person concerned in proceeding or business transacted by such public servant, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than six months but which may extend to five years and shall also be liable to fine. * Punishment for abetment of offences defined in Section 7 or 11 shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than six months but which may extend to five years and shall also be liable to fine. * Any public servant, who commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than one year but which may extend to 7 years and shall also be liable to fine. * Habitual committing of offence under Section 8, 9 and 12 shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than two years but which may extend to 7 years and shall also be liable to fine. = Chapter IV: Investigation = Investigation shall be done by a police officer not below the rank of: *In case of Delhi, of an Inspector of Police. *In metropolitan areas, of an Assistant Commissioner of Police. *Elsewhere, of a Deputy Superintendent of Police or an officer of equivalent rank shall investigate any offence punishable under this Act without the order of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a magistrate of first class, or make any arrest therefore without a warrant. If a police officer not below the rank of an Inspector of Police is authorized by the State Government in this behalf by general or special order, he may investigate such offence without the order of a Metropolitan Magistrate or Magistrate of First class or make arrest therefor without a warrant. Provided further that an offence referred to sec 13.1.e shall not be investigated without the order of a police officer not below the rank of a Superintendent of Police. Any such investigation without the order of a SP or above rank will be dismissed see Umesh Kumar Choubey vs State of Madhya Pradesh.http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1107113/  Amendment Act 2018  As the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 saw limited success in preventing corruption in Government departments and prosecuting and punishing public servants involved in corrupt practices, an amendment was enacted (Amendment Act) and brought into force on 26 July 2018. The Amendment Act attempted to bring the Prevention of Corruption Act in line with United Nations Convention against Corruption 2005, which was ratified by India in 2011. = Highlights of the Amendment =  (i) Definition of Undue Advantage  The terms ‚Äúgratification other than legal remuneration‚Äù and ‚Äúvaluable thing‚Äù are being replaced by the term ‚Äúundue advantage‚Äù. The bill, therefore, redefines the offense of accepting bribes as ‚Äúobtains or accepts or attempts to obtain from any person an undue advantage, intending that in consequence a public duty would be performed improperly or dishonestly, either by himself or by another public servant is guilty of offense under section 7 and shall be imprisoned for a term of 3 to 7 years.  (ii) Offering of Bribes by Person/Commercial Organization  In addition to treating bribe-giving as an offense, section 9 specifically provides for an offense by a commercial organization if any person associated with the commercial organization gives or promises to give any undue advantage to a public servant to obtain or retain business or an advantage in conduct of business. Such a person/commercial organization shall be punishable with a fine, quantum of which is not prescribed in the act.  (iii) Redefining Criminal Misconduct  The offense of criminal misconduct specified in section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, is being substituted by a new section restricting the criminal misconduct to dishonest or fraudulent misappropriation of any property entrusted to the public servant or if the public servant intentionally enriches himself illicitly during the period of his office. Thus the scope of criminal misconduct has been narrowed in the amendment and the threshold to establish the offense has been increased.  (iv) Prior Sanction of Appropriate Government for Investigation and Prosecution  The amendment extends the protection of requirement of prior approval to investigation prior to prosecution. Under the new Section 17A, except when a public official is caught ‚Äòredhanded', the police cannot begin a probe, without the approval of the relevant authority, of any public official. Earlier, this was limited to protecting joint secretaries and above. This universal inclusion provides a great deal of protection to honest officials irrespective of their ranks or levels.  (v) Forfeiture of Property  The new Section 18A also introduces a provision for special courts to confiscate and attach the property acquired through corrupt practices.  (vi) Time Frame for Trial  To ensure speedy justice, the Amendment Act now prescribes that the courts shall endeavor to complete the trial within 2 (two) years. This period can be extended by 6 (six) months at a time and up to a maximum of 4 (four) years in aggregate subject to proper reasons for the same being recorded.  (vii) Enhancement of Punishment  Punishment has been increased from a minimum imprisonment term of 6 (six) months to 3 (three) years, and from a maximum of 5 (five) years to 7 (seven) years, with or without fine.  Prominent cases  = 2G Spectrum Case = The telecom spectrum, which is allotted to private players through the spectrum auction, was allotted by the UPA government at throwaway prices to companies through corrupt and illegal means. A special CBI court is conducting the trial under this act. =Ketan Desai= The CBI recently arrested the Medical Council of India's former president Ketan Desai and three others under this act, for allegedly accepting a bribe to permit Patiala-based Gyan Sagar Medical College to recruit a fresh batch of students without having an adequate infrastructure.

Through Iowa, I-35 and US 69 are mostly parallel routes; Iowa 152 connected the two routes at the narrowest location between them. The route was formed in 1980 from a portion of Clarke County Road R35 and did not undergo any changes in alignment while it was designated. The highway was relinquished to Clarke County and the City of Osceola in 2014. Route description Iowa 152 began at a diamond interchange along I-35 northwest of Osceola. CR R35 continued along the roadway to the north and west as Iowa 152 headed to the south-southeast. It passed country homes and wooded acreages along a two-lane road. east of I-35, the highway curved to the south as it passed between farms. Just from its eastern end, it curved back to the east and crossed the city limits into Osceola. Iowa 152 ended at an intersection with US 69, which runs along Main Street in Osceola. The rural portion of the highway had an annual average daily traffic of 940 vehicles, while the portion within the city limits handled 1270 vehicles. History Iowa 152 was designated in 1980 from a segment of CR R35. It was entirely paved upon designation and did not undergo any route changes. In 2014, the Iowa DOT negotiated the transfer of Iowa 152 to Clarke County and the City of Osceola. Pursuant to Section 306.8 of the Iowa Code, any time the a roadway is transferred from one jurisdiction to another, the highway either must be in good condition or the transferring agency must make a one-time payment to the accepting agencies for an amount which would pay for improvements to the road. In the case of Iowa 152, the Iowa DOT paid Clarke County $2.5 million, which included the payment to the City of Osceola.

He is a retired United States Navy SEAL and former United States Air Force Tactical Air Control Party member who served in the Iraq War. His self-help memoir, Can't Hurt Me, was released in 2018.  Early Life  Goggins was born on February 17, 1975, to Trunnis and Jackie Goggins. In 1981, Goggins lived in Williamsville, New York with his parents and brother, Trunnis Jr.. Goggins has been open about experiencing racism during his early life. As a six year old, Goggins worked with his family at his father‚Äôs skate rink, Skateland. In the gap between his discharge from the Air Force and enlisting in the Navy, Goggins worked as a pest control fumigator.  Military career  Goggins initially applied to join the United States Air Force Pararescue. Goggins failed his ASVAB twice before succeeding and entering into 'The Pipeline' (Pararescue training). During the training he had been diagnosed with sickle cell trait and was advised to stay home for a week, when he had returned to the doctor after a week, he had been told that he could return to the training, but the commander said he would have to do it all over again, he decided not to. He then proceeded to serve as member of the United States Air Force Tactical Air Control Party also known as TACP after completing successful training. Starting from 1994 Goggins served his time in TACP until 1999 and left the United States Air Force. After three attempts, Goggins succeeded in graduating from BUD/S training with Class 235 in 2001 and was assigned to SEAL Team FIVE. Goggins served in Iraq. In 2004, Goggins graduated from Army Ranger School with the distinction of enlisted \\"Top Honor Man.\\"  Charity  After several of his friends died in Afghanistan in a helicopter crash in 2005 during Operation Red Wings, Goggins began long-distance running with the aim of raising money for the Special Operations Warrior Foundation. The Foundation gives college scholarships and grants to the children of fallen special operations soldiers. Competing in endurance challenges, including the Badwater Ultramarathon three times, has enabled Goggins to raise more than $2 million for the Special Operations Warrior Foundation.  Marathon and ultramarathon running  Goggins attempted to enter the Badwater Ultramarathon as a fundraiser, but was told by organizers that he needed to enter another ultramarathon first; as the Badwater is an invitational event. In 2005, Goggins entered the San Diego One Day, a 24-hour ultramarathon held at Hospitality Point in San Diego. He was able to run 101 miles in 19 hours and 6 minutes‚Äîdespite never having attempted to run a marathon previously. Soon after, David completed his first marathon (Las Vegas), in a time that qualified him for entrance into the Boston Marathon. After those two events, having yet to be invited to the Badwater-135, Goggins entered into the Hurt-100; an ultra marathon in Hawaii which is widely regarded as one of the hardest ultra-marathons in the world. He was the ninth runner to cross the finish line, and only 23 runners finished the event. He was subsequently granted entry into the 2006 Badwater-135. During the 2006 Badwater-135, he finished 5th overall, an unheard of result from an ultramarathon novice at a world-class event.Badwater-135 results since 2000 He has participated in the Las Vegas Marathon where he placed highly. He also has participated in the Furnace Creek-508 (2009), an ultra-distance invitational Cycling Race. Three months after completing his first Badwater Ultramarathon in 2006, he competed in the Ultraman World Championships Triathlon in Hawaii. He placed second in the three-day, 320-mile race, cycling 261 miles in two days on a rented bicycle. Before training for that race, he had never ridden a bike competitively. In 2007, Goggins achieved his best finish at the Badwater-135 by placing 3rd overall. He returned to the Badwater-135 in 2013, finishing 18th, after a break from the event since 2008. Over the next two years, he competed in another 14 ultra-endurance races, with top-five finishes in nine of them. He set a course record at the 48-hour national championships, beating the previous record by 20 miles with a total distance traveled of 203.5 miles and earning himself a spot among the top 20 ultramarathoners in the world. In 2008 he was named a \\"Hero of Running\\" by Runner's World. In 2016, Goggins won the Infinitus 88k in 12 hours, almost twenty minutes ahead of the next finisher. In the same year, he also won the Music City Ultra 50k, and Strolling Jim 40 Miler. In 2020, Goggins ran the Moab 240 ultramarathon, placing 2nd in the 241 mile event with a time of 63 hours and 21 minutes, approximately 95 minutes behind race winner Michele Graglia.  Motivational speaking  Goggins said \\"motivational speaker\\" is just his job title. As an inspirational speaker, Goggins travels and speaks to sports teams. He has spoken to athletes from professional teams, including the Atlanta Hawks and the Seattle Seahawks, as well as collegiate athletes from the Alabama, Tennessee and Michigan university football programs. Entrepreneur Jesse Itzler, upon seeing Goggins perform at a 24-hour ultramarathon, called and hired Goggins to live with him in his house for a month. Itzler wrote about his experience on a blog and later published the story as the book His self- help memoir, Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds, was released on December 4, 2018. In the book he refers to the 40% rule, his belief that most of us only tap into 40% of our capabilities. The Audible version of this book has sat in the Amazon best sellers list since day 1 with over 15,000 positive reviews. = Health problems = Goggins has reported the following health conditions: * Asthma * Obesity ** In the late 1990s, after spending four years in the Air Force, Goggins, who weighed almost 300 pounds, was told that he was too heavy to make it through SEAL training. In less than three months, he returned weighing 190 pounds. ** In 2005, when he decided to run an ultramarathon to raise money for charity, he \\"weighed 280 pounds from years of power lifting...Eight months later, when I ran Kiehl's Badwater Ultramarathon, I weighed 177 pounds.\\" * Congenital heart defect ** In May 2010, during a routine medical checkup, his doctor discovered a birth defect known as atrial septal defect (ASD), or a hole between atrial chambers of his heart, and it is only able to function at about 75 percent capacity. This condition typically prevents people from doing activities such as scuba diving or anything at high altitude. Only a few days after learning of the condition, Goggins had surgery to repair his heart.

It charted out an elegant and simple solution based on a SVD-based factorization scheme for analysing image measurements of a rigid object captured from different views using a weak perspective camera model. The crucial observation made by authors was that if all the measurements (i.e., image co-ordinates of all the points in all the views) are collected in a single matrix, the point trajectories will reside in a certain subspace. The dimension of the subspace in which the image data resides is a direct consequence of two factors: # The type of camera that projects the scene (for example, affine or perspective) # The nature of inspected object (for instance, rigid or non-rigid). The low-dimensionality of the subspace is mirrored (captured) trivially as reduced rank of the measurement matrix. This reduced rank of measurement matrix can be motivated from the fact that, the position of the projection of an object point on the image plane is constrained as the motion of each point is globally described by a precise geometric model. Method The rigid-body factorization introduced in provides a description of 3D structure of a rigid object in terms of a set of feature points extracted from salient image features. After tracking the points throughout all the images composing the temporal sequence, a set of trajectories is available. These trajectories are constrained globally at each frame by the rigid transformation which the shape is undergoing, i.e., trajectory of every point will have similar profile. Let the location of a point j in a frame i be defined as pij = (xij, yij)T where xij and yij are horizontal and vertical image co-ordinates respectively . A compact representation of the image measurements can be expressed by collecting all the non-homogeneous co-ordinates in a single matrix, called the observation matrix P such that : \\\\mathbf{P}= \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{ccc} x_{11} & \\\\cdots & x_{1N} \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\ x_{F1} & \\\\cdots & x_{FN} \\\\ y_{11} & \\\\cdots & y_{1N} \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\ y_{F1} & \\\\cdots & y_{FN} \\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right) P is a 2F √ó N matrix, where F is the number of frames and N the number of feature points. Ideally, the observation matrix, should contain perfect information about the object being tracked. Unfortunately, in practice, most state-of-art trackers can only provide point tracks that are incomplete (due to occlusion) and inaccurate (due to sensor noise) if placed in an unstructured environment. As mentioned earlier, the central premise behind the factorization approach is that a measurement matrix P is rank limited. Further, it is possible to factor P into two sub-matrices: a motion and a shape matrix, M and S of size 2F √ó r and N √ó r respectively. : \\\\mathbf{P} = \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\mathbf{S}^T.\\\\, The size and structure of S generally depends on the shape properties (for example whether it is rigid or non-rigid) and M depends both on the type of camera model we assume and the shape properties. The essence of factorization method is computing The optimal r-rank approximation of P with respect to the Frobenius norm can be found out using a SVD-based scheme.

By 1920 a total of 96 engines had been manufactured. In 1919, three examples had to be give to France; the remaining 93 were taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn and 89 survived into the Deutsche Bundesbahn fleet. From 1959 they began to be retired. The last one was taken out of service in 1963 and was kept at Aulendorf as a museum engine until 1968. This last example was then scrapped as well.

Baer (20 May 1885 - 26 June 1956) was a German-Israeli author, social worker, reformer, suffragist and Zionist. Assigned female at birth he became, in December 1906, one of the first people to undergo sex-change surgery, and one of the first, in January 1907, to gain full legal recognition of his gender identity and to have a new birth certificate issued reflecting his new gender.Date of medical certification Baer wrote notes for sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld on his experiences growing up as a girl while feeling inside that he was male. Together they developed these notes into the semi-fictional, semi-autobiographical Aus eines Mannes M√§dchenjahren (Memoirs of a Man's Maiden Years) (1907) which was published under the pseudonym N.O. Body. Baer also gained the right to marry and did so in October 1907. Life Beglaubigte Abschrift von Baers Geburtseintrag beim Standesamt Arolsen / 1969 Official Copy \\"certified copy\\" of his corrected entry in the German Births Register Arolsen (Hesse) =Personal Life and Activism= Baer studied political economy, sociology and pedagogy in Berlin and Hamburg, and became a social worker (Volkspflegerin) and confirmed suffragette. In May 1904 he was sent to Galicia under the auspices of the Hamburg chapter of the B'nai B'rith, to campaign against the trafficking of women from poor countries and for the rights of all women to education. Here, in Lemberg (now Lviv), Karl met the equally active Beile Halpern, who he was later to marry. Baer's work included activism among local women. He encouraged them to campaign for kindergarten and school provision, which would allow women to hold jobs outside the home and reduce the financial hardship that prompted some to traffic their daughters or send them into service. Baer worked to oblige the authorities along established human trafficking paths to check ID documents and combat illegal movement. He also promoted the women's education movement, and became well known as a reformist throughout eastern Europe and Germany.Maretzki, p. 222f.M. Baer, \\"M√§dchenhandel\\", in: Arena, ed.

Baer had initially been sent to Galicia for two years; he returned to Germany after only one, having attracted censure for his male body language, argumentative style, and forceful advocacy of the cause. According to case notes by Magnus Hirschfeld, Baer then transitioned to his male identity and began living as a man. He was diagnosed as a man living in a woman's body after accidental hospitalization, when his female anatomy was discovered; at the same hospital he underwent multi-stage rudimentary sex-change surgery in October 1906. After convalescence he was released from hospital in December 1906, with a medical certificate of his new gender. His new identity was confirmed by the courts in Arolsen (his birthplace) on 8 January 1907. Karl Baer retained the middle initial \\"M\\", ostensibly stemming from his birth name, to connect him to his earlier publications under the name \\"M Baer\\". In later life he said the letter stood for \\"Max\\"; on his gravestone the middle name is given as \\"Meir\\". In October 1907 he married Beile Halpern; she died in March 1909, and he remarried, with Elza Max (1887‚Äì1947). From 1908 to 1911 Baer was an insurance sales agent; on January 1, 1911, he took up a post as Consul for Jewish Life in Berlin. In December 1920 he became director of the Berlin section of the loge B'nai B'rith, a post he held until the Section's forcible closure by the Gestapo on 19 April 1937.About the closure of the loges see the report by Grete Baer. Baer was by then an important figure in Jewish society, and his influence on cultural life brought him into conflict with the Nazi administration. He was allowed to emigrate with his wife in June 1938 to Palestine, later to become Israel, where he worked between 1942 and 1950 as an accountant. By 1950 he was going blind and had to give up his job; nothing more is documented about him up to his death in 1956. He is buried in the Kiryat-Shaul cemetery in Tel Aviv under the name Karl Meir Baer. Book and film As part of his analysis and therapy, Baer wrote notes for Hirschfeld on his experiences growing up as a girl while feeling inside that he was male. He and Hirschfeld together worked up these notes into the semi-fictional, semi- autobiographical Aus eines Mannes M√§dchenjahren, \\"Memoirs of a man's maiden years\\", published in 1907 under the pseudonym N.O. Body. Details of Baer's background were also changed to prevent readers identifying him from the text. Hirschfeld, a keen advocate of the notion of a 'third sex', to which anyone uncomfortable with gender norms or sexual dichotomy could attribute themselves, hoped the book would explain the dilemma that many intersexed children suffered when forced into a two-gender system. The book went through several reprints and translations, earning Baer a continuing income in later life. Later editions, especially those published after the First World War, were rewritten in light of shifts in social acceptance and to fulfil new social and political aims. In 1919 Karl Grune adapted Baer's book into a fictional autobiography, and into the script for a silent film starring the German actress Erika Gl√§ssner (1890‚Äì1959) as \\"Nobody\\".

On August 17, 2010, BlueFire Ethanol Fuels rebranded itself as BlueFire Renewables. Technology BlueFire Ethanol employs what it calls a \\"concentrated acid hydrolysis\\" process of converting waste material to ethanol. The technology, developed by and licensed from Arkenol Fuels in Orange County, California, reduces waste material to minuscule dimensions, where it is combined with sulfuric acid. This releases lignin structures within the biomass, where the sugar and acid are separated. The sugar goes into a yeast-fermenting process that results in its conversion to ethanol.‚ÄúBlueFire to Break Ground,‚Äù GreenTech Media, May 8, 2008 Projects In 2007, BlueFire Ethanol received US$40 million funding from the U.S. Department of Energy to construct a per year cellulosic ethanol plant in Fulton, MS.‚ÄúGarbage - clean fuel, or just a load of trash?‚Äù, Reuters/New Zealand Herald, June 2, 2008 In 2008, the company unveiled plans to create a network of ethanol refineries located at landfills around the world.

Persico.BBC Two, Last Day of World War One 8:15pm 1 November 2008 The German 1918 Spring Offensive was Germany's last attempt to force the British and French to capitulate before the expected arrival of overwhelming American forces. The gamble almost succeeded but the allies first held and then, in July at the River Marne. pushed back the Germans. On 8 August - The Black Day of the German Army, the British launched their counter-attack at Amiens. The Germans were forced back and would never recover. They had suffered extremely high casualties in their offensives; the allied naval blockade was threatening starvation; revolution at home meant troops were fighting both the enemy and their own countrymen; and now American troops were arriving at the front at a rate of 300,000 each month. Faced with disaster, the German Government dispatched a civilian peace delegation under Matthias Erzberger. On Thursday, 7 November French soldiers on the Front line near La Capelle witnessed the approach of several German cars bearing white flags. The delegation was escorted through the devastated French landscape via Guise and onto Hombli√®res from where they were placed on a train. The train was routed through Tergnier to a gun siding by Rethondes in the forest of Compi√®gne and the personal train carriage of Marshal Foch, supreme commander of the Allied armies. Foch was in no mood to compromise and greeted the delegation: What do you want from me?. The Germans stated that they were there to negotiate an armistice. Foch replied that as far as he was concerned there would be no negotiation - they were there to receive his terms. A meeting was arranged for the next day from whence the Germans would have 72 hours, from the 8th to 11th, to agree to Foch's terms; Erzberger suggested an immediate ceasefire but this was refused by Foch. Foch conceded virtually nothing during the ensuing talks. Erzberger was required to telegraph the terms back to the Supreme Command and was told to accept any terms as the situation was so grave; the messages were uncoded and were read by the Allies. At 5:10 am on 11 November 1918, the two sides signed and the news was sent around the world that hostilities would cease at 11:00 am.

Early history Armenians are believed to have come to India, when some Armenians joined the auxiliary elements of the forces under the command of Alexander the Great when he crossed Armenia en route to India. The earliest documented references to the mutual relationship of Armenians and Indians are found in Cyropaedia (Persian Expedition), an ancient Greek work by Xenophon (430 BC ‚Äì 355 BC). These references indicate that several Armenians traveled to India, and they were well aware of land routes to reach India, as also the general and political geography, socio-cultural milieu, and economic life of the Indian subcontinent.India and Armenia Partners - Embassy of India in Armenia [ENG] According to Zenob Glak, one of the first disciples of Gregory the Illuminator, the patron saint of Armenia, at least 7 Hindu cities were established in Armenia sometime around 349 B.C. The institution of Nakharar was founded by Hindu Kings from even earlier. Zenob wrote that the colony was established by two Indian princes from Ujjain who had taken refuge in Armenia.India-Eurasia, the way ahead: with special focus on Caucasus, Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development, Centre for Caucasian Study Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development, 2008 p. 205 They worshipped Ganesha and their descendants multiplied and ruled over a large part of Armenia.

Detroit: Wayne State University Press. pp. 100‚Äì101. . Literary evidence indicates the existence of Indian settlements in Armenia as early as 149 BC. The settlements were established in Taron, Greater Armenia (roughly corresponding to the Mu≈ü Province of present-day Turkey) by two Indian Princes, their families and retinue, on land provided by the then rulers of Armenia. An archive directory (published 1956) in Delhi states that Armenian merchant-cum-diplomat Thomas of Cana arrived on the Malabar Coast in 780 AD using the overland route. Thomas was an affluent merchant dealing chiefly in spices and muslins. He was also instrumental in obtaining a decree, inscribed on a copperplate, from the Chera Dynasty, which conferred several commercial, social and religious privileges for the regional Saint Thomas Christians. In current local references, Thomas of Cana is known as Knayi Thomman or Kanaj Tomma, meaning \\"Thomas the merchant\\". Armenians had trade relations with several parts of India, and by the 7th century a few Armenian settlements had appeared in the present-day state of Kerala on the Malabar Coast. Armenians controlled a large part of the international trade of the area, particularly in precious stones and quality fabrics. Medieval history Mughal emperor Akbar (1556‚Äì1605), invited Armenians to settle in Agra in the 16th century,Julfa v. Armenians in India and by the middle of the 19th century, Agra had a sizeable Armenian population. Armenian traders visited Agra during the Mughal Empire. Akbar granted Armenians several privileges, considerable religious freedom and the opportunities to work for the government. Mariam Zamani Begum, one of Akbar's wives, was an Armenian. By an imperial decree, Armenian merchants were exempted from paying taxes on the merchandise imported and exported by them, and they were also allowed to move around in the areas of the Mughal Empire where entry of foreigners was otherwise prohibited. In 1562, an Armenian Church was constructed in Agra. From the 16th century onwards, the Armenians (mostly from Persia) formed an important trading community in Surat, the most active Indian port of that period, located on the western coast of India. The port city of Surat used to have regular sea borne to and fro traffic of merchant vessels from Basra (in present-day Iraq) and Bandar Abbas (in present-day Iran). Armenians built two Churches and a cemetery in Surat. A tombstone in the city, dating back to 1579, bears Armenian inscriptions. The second Church was built in 1778 and was dedicated to Mary. An Armenian language manuscript written in 1678, currently preserved in Saltikov-Shchedrin Library, St. Petersburg, has an account of a permanent colony of Armenians in Surat. The Armenians settled in Chinsurah, near Calcutta, West Bengal, and in 1697 built a Church there. This is the second oldest Church in Bengal and is still in well preserved on account of the care of the Calcutta Armenian Church Committee. The Armenian towns of Artashat, Metsbin and Dvin became important centres for barter trade with India by the Middle Ages. India exported stones, herbs and textiles to Armenia, and imported hides and dyes. The Armenian community in India grew in size and wealth throughout the 17th century. Armenians also held varying relationships with the East India Company. Armenians made some contributions in the areas of artisanship including gun-making and printing. Many Armenians in Calcutta were engaged in the legal profession as they were comparatively highly educated. The Holy Church of Nazareth, the oldest and largest Armenian church in Calcutta, was built in 1707. The Church was repaired and embellished in 1734. The 250th anniversary of the Holy Church of Nazareth was celebrated on 25 November 1957. The Armenian College and Philanthropic Academy is located in Calcutta. The Armenian language journal Azdarar, first published in Madras in 1794, was the first Armenian journal to be published anywhere in the world. In 1994, Armenia issued a special postage stamp to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Azdarar. In 1773, Shahamir Shahamirian, an Armenian nationalist in Madras, published his vision of a future Armenian nation, which Armenians consider to be an attempt to draft the first ever Constitution of an independent Armenia. Modern history Indian classical singer Gohar Jaan, who in 1902 became the first person to be recorded on a gramophone, was of Armenian descent. Following India's independence on 15 August 1947, most of the Armenian community in India migrated to Australia, the United States and other countries. The remaining Armenian community in India is primarily concentrated in Calcutta, with a few also residing in Mumbai, Delhi, Agra and Chennai. All of these cities have Armenian churches and cemeteries. Marriages between Indians and Armenians has resulted in a small population of Indo- Armenians. Indian President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan visited the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic in September 1964, and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi visited in June 1976. India recognized Armenia on 26 December 1991, three months after it declared independence from the Soviet Union. Diplomatic relations between India and Armenia were established on 31 August 1992. India opened its embassy in Yerevan on 1 March 1999. Armenia, which had opened an honorary consulate in April 1994, established its embassy in New Delhi in October 1999. Armenian Presidents Levon Ter-Petrosyan and Robert Kocharyan visited India in 1995 and 2003 respectively.

The force went through further changes in 1902, when the Indian Nursing Service and the Army Nursing Service were combined and on 27 March 1902, it was redesignated to Queen Alexandra‚Äôs Imperial Military Nursing Service. At the outbreak of the World War in 1914 there were just fewer than 300 nurses in the QAIMNS, by the end of the war this had raised to 10,404. The Army nurses served in Flanders, the Mediterranean, the Balkans, the Middle East and onboard hospital ships. Of the 200 plus army nurses died on active service, many were Indians. After, the war on 1st October 1926, the Nursing Services was made a permanent part of British Indian Army. This date is now being celebrated as the Corps day of Military Nursing Service, though in actual its origins occurred 45 five years before (many Corps of the Army) the Army Medical Corps also traces its origin to more than hundreds of years back in the similar way, though it was constituted in the present form in 1948. = Second World War = With the outbreak of the Second world war, nurses once again found themselves serving all over the world, including Singapore, Burma, Italy, Mesopotamia, Ceylon, Egypt and Western Africa. The changing working conditions and wartime shortages led to changes in uniform. Khaki slacks and battledress blouses replaced the grey and scarlet ward dress and rank insignia was adopted to signify the officer status of the nurses. In the Far East, the fall of Hong Kong and Singapore led to many army nurses (including Indian) being captured by the Japanese and endured terrible hardships and deprivations of the Far East prisoner-of-war camps. During the middle of the war in 1943, the Indian arm of the Nursing Services was separated through Indian Military Nursing Service Ordinance, 1943 and redesignated, thereby constituting the Indian Military Nursing Service (IMNS). The IMNS was an auxiliary subject to the provisions of the Indian Army Act, 1911. However they were of commissioned officers ranking equally with Indian commissioned officers. This was the first time in the history of the Indian Army women were granted commissioned officer ranks. = Post Independence = After the independence in 1950, the Government of India constituted the Military Nursing Service (MNS) by issuing Army Instruction 274/50, to set the terms and conditions of service for the grant of regular commissions in the MNS forming part of the regular Army, subject to the Army Act, 1950. The IMNS stood subsumed in the MNS as on 12 August 1950, and the auxiliary force called IMNS formally cease to exist. The MNS was constituted as an all women, all officer Corps of the Indian Army, and it remains so. On 23 November 1954 the Central Government made the Army Rules, 1954 and brought MNS under the Army Rules along with every other Corps/ Service of the regular Army. Subsequently, on 3 January 1959, through Army Instruction 4/59, the Government of India re-designated the rank of the officers in the MNS to conform to the nomenclature used by the other officers of the regular Army. After having re-designated the rank in the MNS by the Government, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) through Army Order 501/63 laid down that the MNS Officers are required to salute and are entitled to salutes in the manner as other Commissioned Officers of the Army. The COAS further issued Army Order 120/73; and laid down the order of precedence of the Arms/ Services and Units of the Army including the MNS. On 15 March 1982 the COAS had cancelled the earlier Army Order 120/73 and issued Army Order 11/82 laid down the order of precedence of the Arms/ Services and Units of the Army including the MNS and the on the subject with some further additions of newly raised Corps, which is valid even today. On 5 December 1986, the Government of India issued the Defence Service Regulations, Regulations for the Army, 1987 for the administration of the regular Army. The said regulations addresses the MNS as a Corps/Service, and stated that officers in the MNS are Army Officers and will rank equally with male officers of the same titular rank, and on 5 December 1993, the Government of India amended the Army Rules 1954 and inserted the Rule 16A dealing with the retirement of officers of the regular Army from all Corps/ Services including the MNS. Now, the Military Nursing Service is an integral part of the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS).. The AFMS consists of Army Medical Corps (AMC), Army Dental Corps (ADC) and the Military Nursing Service (MNS). The AFMS personnel serve in the medical establishments of Army, Navy and Air Force. The women officers in the MNS was treated as under dogs since the inception of AFMS in 1948 (the AMC and AD Corps are more or less equally positioned). After independence, the Officers of MNS have not only served in India but have also played a role in United Nations peace keeping missions abroad in UN missions to Lebanon, Cambodia, Somalia and scores of other Nations. Many of such missions are still active. Rank Structure The various ranks of the Military Nursing Service are listed below in descending order:Commissioned Officers *Major General *Brigadier *Colonel *Lieutenant Colonel *Major *Captain *Lieutenant Presently there are no personnel equivalent to JCOs/OR in the Military Nursing Service as the other para-medical personnel such as Nursing Assistants and Ambulance Assistants are part of Army Medical Corps.

Opened in 1967 and once one of the most successful malls in the country, the mall now features around 20 stores, including two anchor stores, Dillard's Clearance Center and JCPenney, Impact Church, and a food court. It is owned by Namdar Realty Group and Mason Asset Management. History Regency Square Mall was a $12 million project of Regency Centers, constructed at an expanse of sand dunes. It initially featured three anchor stores: national chain JCPenney, along with May-Cohens and Furchgotts. The mall also included a Woolworth dime store as a junior anchor, as well as a cafeteria style Piccadilly restaurant. In outparcels, the single-screen (later twinned) Regency Cinema opened on the northeast corner of the property, and Annie Tiques bar and restaurant opened on the southwest corner. =1970s= According to an Urban Land Institute study published by the Florida Times-Union in 1979, it was one of the most profitable retail centers in the nation, with yearly average sales of $156/ft¬≤ versus a national average of $88/ft¬≤. To give back to the community, the mall operators turned over thousands of dollars in coins from their decorative fountains to charities. All types of social events, from art shows to science fairs to horticultural exhibits were held there. =1980s= In 1981, a $30 million major expansionFlorida Times-Union: November 16, 2008-Remember when we all used to go to the Mall? by Diana Middleton nearly doubled the size of the mall, adding Sears and a relocated Ivey's. The former Ivey's became Furchgott's, and the existing May-Cohens was also enlarged. As a result of this expansion, the mall comprised two separate segments: the original mall between JCPenney and May-Cohens, and the new segment between May-Cohens and Sears. Furchgott's was closed in 1985 when the chain merged with Stein Mart. Unlike the other Furchgott's stores, the one at Regency Square did not become a Stein Mart, as the mall management considered the chain too low-end for the mall. A food court and a six-screen AMC theater was added midway along the east wing. The southwest outparcel was removed to make room for the expansion, requiring Annie Tiques to open a new location years later at the Jacksonville Landing when it opened in 1987. May Cohen‚Äôs briefly operated as May Florida before being converted to Baton Rouge-based Maison Blanche in July 1988. =1990s= In 1990, the Regency Twin theater on the northeast corner of the property closed, and Picadilly's Cafeteria moved from inside the mall to the new structure they built in its place. In 1991, Regency Group sold the property to General Growth Properties of Chicago for $71.8 million. In early 1992, Maison Blanche was sold to Mobile-based Gayfer's via Mercantile Stores. Dillard's, who had rebranded the Ivey's store in June 1990, built a new location onto the West Wing, which opened -along with of new inline store space- also in 1992. This was likewise done at The Avenues Mall a year before. The mall's Woolworth closed in July 1997. Ivey's former store became Montgomery Ward. While Dillard‚Äôs purchased Gayfer's parent company in late 1998, both stores overlapped in this market, so this store instead became Belk. As a result, they opened in Jacksonville for the first time, and the store was in the process of a second expansion when the nameplate was converted. The mall also underwent a $30 million renovation in 1998, which comprised the addition of a new, 24-screen AMC movie complex on the northwest corner of the property to replace the existing six-screen theater inside the mall. A substation of the Jacksonville Sheriff's office was also added, as was a food court. Old Navy also came to the mall in the late 1990s. Regency announced formal conduct and dress codes in 1999 to deal with offensive or intimidating behavior and gang activity. Because the mall is private property, management has the right to ask individuals not in compliance to leave the premises.Florida Times-Union: August 9, 1999-Mall code puts out 'offensive' patrons by Peralte C. Paul =2000s= Montgomery Ward closed in 2001, and Burdines expressed interest in moving into the vacated building.http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/010901/bum_5076449.html Starting in 2003, General Growth began talking with other retailers, such as Kohl's (which did not operate any stores in Florida at the time) to fill the space vacated by Montgomery Ward. Finally, in 2006, Homeworks Furniture opened in the former Montgomery Ward space, but it later closed. Since 2000, crime has become a major issue at Regency Square, and the perception of the area as crime-ridden hurt the mall. Over 1,000 incidents were reported in 2004, the highest ever. Between September, 2007 and September, 2008, 650 unlawful acts were documented by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, more than the combined total of crimes at Jacksonville's other two major retail centers, The Avenues Mall and St. Johns Town Center. On January 26, 2008, a suspect was killed by an off-duty policeman who was called to pursue a fleeing man who had stolen a pair of jeans from the mall's Belk store. The shoplifter shot the officer four times before being fatally wounded himself.Florida Times-Union: November 8, 2008-Heroic actions earn honors for police, fire officers by Dan Scanlan =2010s= In 2014, Belk began construction of a new store nearby, and announced in September 2014 the Regency store would close on its completion which was February 17, 2015.http://www.jacksonville.com/news/metro/2014-09-15/story/belk-confirms- plans-close-regency-square-mall-store On April 21, 2016, Sears announced that its store would also be closing as part of a plan to close 78 stores nationwide. The store closed on July 17, 2016. The closure of Sears left Dillard's Clearance Center and JCPenney as the only anchors left.https://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/article/sears-regency-store-closed-forever On June 4, 2020, JCPenney announced it would close by around October 2020 as part of a plan to close 154 stores nationwide.https://companyblog.jcpnewsroom.com/storeclosings/ After JCPenney closes, Dillard's Clearance Center will be the one and only remaining anchor store left. Future In a 2010 Arlington vision plan, citizens recognized the Regency Square Mall property as being ripe for redevelopment, with the potential to attract new businesses and consumers. The comprehensive report covered environmental, economic, and quality of life issues in the Greater Arlington region. The groups approach to the mall property was to redevelop the land with transportation and density in mind. The approach would entail mix-used structures, a gridded street pattern, and infill development. Emphasis is put on the vastness of the area and its equitable size to downtown. Just as customers shifted from stores in the city center to Regency when it opened in 1967, the mall lost business with the opening of the Avenues mall in 1990, St. Johns Town Center in 2005, and River City Marketplace in 2006. At the end of 2011, Regency's occupancy rate was just over 74%, but two years later, it had dropped below 38%. In August 2013, General Growth Properties put the mall up for sale. It was marketed as a \\"turn key\\" power center redevelopment opportunity. In February 2014, a press release announced the sale of Regency Square for $13 million to a pair of businesses from Great Neck, New York: Mason Asset Management and Namdar Realty Group. In the summer of 2016, International Decor Outlet is expected to open up to 80 storefronts in Regency Square Mall. This comes after the announcement that locally based Impact Church will take over the former Belk location as well. Anchors & Major Retailers The largest retail space was occupied by Sears with 216,711 sq. ft before Sears closed its store in 2016. Three department stores are similarly sized, with former Belk (which closed down its store and will become Impact Church) at 188,827 sq. ft., Dillard's Clearance Center in a 182,444 sq. ft. building but only occupying half of that and original anchor JCPenney occupying 176,019 sq. ft. As of 2012, there was one vacant anchor space of 115,000 sq. ft., originally home to Montgomery Ward and later, Homeworks Furniture and later a car museum that closed as well. Smaller tenants included Champs Sports/World Foot Locker (37,505 sq. ft.) and Lunar Mini Golf utilizing 24,440 sq. ft. Dillards owns its respective store building and parking lot and Sears also did before it closed down, with the remainder belonging to Namdar Realty Group and Mason Asset Management.

Life and career McDowall has been described by the International Record Review as having 'a communicative gift that is very rare in modern music' and Gramophone has said of her that 'she has an instinctive understanding of the medium allied to the ability to speak directly to the listener wholly without artifice'. Often inspired by extra-musical influences, her writing combines a rhythmic vitality with expressive lyricism 'which is, at times, intensely moving'. She read music at the University of Edinburgh continuing her studies at Trinity College of Music, London, later completing an MMus in composition. She studied with Joseph Horovitz, Robert Saxton and Adam Gorb. She has won many awards and has been short-listed seven times for the British Composer Awards. In 2014, she won the British Composer Award for choral music. Cecilia McDowall's music has been commissioned and performed by leading choirs, including the BBC Singers, ensembles and at major festivals both in Britain and abroad and has been broadcast on BBC Radio and worldwide. A commission from the Portsmouth Festival Choir,Portsmouth Festival Choir , UK. The Shipping Forecast, gained national media attention, in June 2011. The work reflects the mystery and force of the sea, drawing together the poetry of Se√°n Street, the psalm 'They that go down to the sea in ships', and the words of the shipping forecast itself. Recent commissions include the Musicians' Benevolent Fund St Cecilia anthem for the service of St Cecilia at St Paul's Cathedral, sung by the joint choirs of Westminster Abbey, Westminster Cathedral and St Paul's Cathedral, and liturgical works for Durham and Liverpool Cathedrals. Future works include commissions from the BBC for Scunthorpe Co-operative Junior Choir, the winner of the BBC Radio 3 2008 Choir of the Year: the Welsh Chamber Orchestra, Jeremy Huw Williams, baritone, David Juritz, violin, conductor, Anthony Hose at the Beaumaris Festival; the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. and Chorus in conjunction with the NE Community Choir for performance in Aberdeen in October, 2011: the City of London Sinfonia (a commission from the Scott Polar Research Institute to celebrate the centenary of Scott's death in 1912), performed in the Birmingham Symphony Hall in February, 2012; and in a new work for the 2012 Presteigne festival.

Background  Zhang Baofu was born in 727, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family traced its ancestry to the Jin Dynasty official Zhang Hua. His father Zhang Jiazhen had previously been a chancellor under Emperor Xuanzong and continued to serve in prominent positions after his removal in 723. Zhang Jiazhen died in 729, however, when Zhang Baofu was only two years old. Near the end of Emperor Xuanzong's Kaiyuan era (713-741), the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, i.e., the region of the Tang capital Chang'an), Han Chaozong (), who had previously been recommended by Zhang Jiazhen, stated to Emperor Xuanzong:New Book of Tang, vol. 127. Emperor Xuanzong, hearing this, was saddened, and he summoned Zhang Baofu and made him an army officer. Emperor Xuanzong also gave him a new name ‚Äî Yanshang, meaning \\"extended favor.\\" It was said that Zhang Yanshang was well-versed in the Confucian classics and histories and he also became known for administrative talent. The official Miao Jinqing, who later served as a chancellor as well, was impressed with his talent and gave him a daughter in marriage.Old Book of Tang, vol. 129.  During Emperor Suzong's reign  During the Anshi Rebellion, Emperor Xuanzong's son and successor Emperor Suzong was, for some time, at Fengxiang (È≥≥Áøî, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), and while there, he made Zhang Yanshang an imperial censor, initially with the rank Jiancha Yushi (), then as Dianzhong Shiyushi (). Thereafter, the general Wang Sili (), who then carried the title of military governor (Jiedushi) of Guanzhong Circuit, requested to have Zhang serve as his assistant, and when Wang was later made the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), Zhang served as the deputy mayor of Taiyuan Municipality under Wang. He was later recalled to Chang'an to serve as a low-level official at the ministry of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®, Xingbu).  During Emperor Daizong's reign  After Emperor Suzong died in 762 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Daizong, the chancellor Yuan Zai became a dominant figure at court. As Yuan had been recommended by Miao Jinqing, he treated Zhang Yanshang, as Miao's son-in-law, with kindness. When Emperor Daizong was forced to flee to Shan Prefecture (ÈôùÂ∑û, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan) in 763, at Yuan's recommendation, Emperor Daizong made Zhang an imperial attendant (Áµ¶‰∫ã‰∏≠, Jishizhong). Soon thereafter, he became deputy chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤‰∏≠‰∏û, Yushi Zhongcheng) and Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). In 767, Zhang was made the mayor of Henan Municipality (Ê≤≥Âçó, i.e., the region of the eastern capital Luoyang). During the Anshi Rebellion, Luoyang suffered greatly from the wars, and much of it was in ruins. It was said that Zhang was diligent and hardworking, and he ruled simply. He also reopened the canals and rebuilt the palaces and imperial temples. Within several years, refugees returned, and Luoyang returned to prosperity. Emperor Daizong thus praised him in an edict. In 770, when the office of deputy supreme commander of the Henan, Huaixi (Ê∑ÆË•ø, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan), and Shannan (i.e., the region south of the Qinling Mountains) Regions was abolished, the troops formerly attached to that office were transferred to Zhang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 224. Subsequently, Zhang was recalled to Chang'an to serve as chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤Â§ßÂ§´, Yushi Daifu). While he was serving in that role, there was an occasion when the junior official Li Shaoliang () submitted a number of accusations against Yuan, and Yuan's associates, in turn, accused Li of false accusations and had him arrested and detained at the office of the imperial censors. Zhang disapproved of the action and did not want to be involved, and he was sent to Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) to serve as its military governor as well as the prefect of its capital Yang Prefecture (). At that time, there was a drought in the circuit, and a large number of the people were trying to depart for other regions. Zhang's subordinates detained them, but Zhang, pointing out that the people should be given the opportunity to survive the drought, allowed them to leave and, in their absence, kept their houses maintained and exempted them from taxes. As a result, many returned thereafter. He later left governmental service when his mother died, to observe a period of mourning for her. After the mourning period was over, he was recalled to serve as the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), as well as the mayor of its capital, Jiangling Municipality.  During Emperor Dezong's reign  Emperor Daizong died in 779 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Dezong. Later that year, Emperor Dezong made Zhang Yanshang the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) and the mayor of its capital Chengdu Municipality. During this time, when Xichuan was under attack by Tufan and Nanzhao forces, and imperial forces, commanded by Li Sheng and Qu Huan () were in Xichuan to aid Xichuan forces; they were ultimately able to repel Tufan and Nanzhao attacks.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 226. (At the end of the campaign, however, there was a serious dispute between Zhang and Li Sheng ‚Äî Li Sheng had, after the campaign, taken the military prostitute Gao Hong () with him. Zhang, angry with this, sent messengers to chase after Li Sheng's army to demand Gao back, thus causing a grudge between Li Sheng and Zhang.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 232. In 783, there was a mutiny by his subordinate Zhang Ku (), who had been posted in the mountains in the west of Chengdu in defense against Tufan. Zhang Ku attacked Chengdu, forcing Zhang Yanshang to flee to Han Prefecture (Êº¢Â∑û, in modern Deyang, Sichuan). It was only after another subordinate of Zhang Yanshang's, Chigan Sui (), attacked and killed Zhang Ku, that Zhang Yanshang was able to return to Chengdu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 229. It was said that Zhang followed the law and ruled the circuit leniently, allowing the people of the circuit to recover from the wars that had ravaged the circuit ever since Anshi Rebellion. At that time, Emperor Dezong was faced with a rebellion by the general Zhu Ci and was forced to flee Chang'an. During the times that he was at Fengtian (Â•âÂ§©, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) and then at Liang Prefecture (Ê¢ÅÂ∑û, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), until he was able to return to Chang'an after Zhu was defeated by the general Li Sheng in fall 784, Emperor Dezong relied on supplies from Xichuan Circuit, and in summer 784, he gave Zhang the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 230. In 785, when the chancellor Liu Congyi was seriously ill (and Liu would die later in the year), Emperor Dezong thus recalled Zhang to Chang'an, intending to make him an actual chancellor. Li Sheng, still displeased with Zhang, submitted a petition accusing Zhang of a number of crimes, and Emperor Dezong, not willing to go against Li's wishes, for the time being only made Zhang Zuo Pushe (), one of the heads of the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). By 786, however, Zhang was beginning to gain the upper hand against Li in their struggle, as Li's son-in-law Zhang Yu (), displeased that Li had held a grander ceremony and given more dowry when marrying another daughter to Cui Shu () than when marrying Zhang Yu's wife to him, became an associate of Zhang's, as did another subordinate of Li's, Zheng Yunkui (). Emperor Dezong also had been suspicious of Li due to his longtime hold on the loyalty of the army, as well as various rumors fostered by Tufan agents that Li was planning treason. Li, hearing that Emperor Dezong was suspecting him, offered to resign his post as military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), in winter 786 when he was Chang'an. Emperor Dezong declined, and instead requested the intervention of the chancellor Han Huang, who was friendly with LI. Han and the general Liu Xuanzuo (), the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), therefore, held a feast for Zhang and Li, hoping to dissolve their enmity. Both agreed, and Li further tried to dissolve Zhang's resentment by endorsing him as chancellor. In spring 787, Emperor Dezong, accordingly, made Zhang a chancellor. However, while Zhang agreed to dissolve his resentment, the resentment persisted, and when Li requested that Zhang give a daughter to one of his sons in marriage, Zhang refused, causing Li to comment: Later in 787, Zhang, in conflict with his chancellor colleague Qi Ying, who had already offended Emperor Dezong by his honest words, and Zhang opined to Emperor Dezong that Qi did not have the talent to be a chancellor. Emperor Dezong demoted Qi to be a prefectural prefect. Around the same time, Han died, and both Zhang and the general Ma Sui, who also had a grudge against Li, advocated for peace for Tufan, which Li had opposed. Emperor Dezong, who personally favored an alliance with Tufan against Huige, used Li's opposition against the Tufan alliance to remove Li from his post at Fengxiang. Zhang recommended Zheng, but Emperor Dezong allowed Li to recommend his successor; Li recommended his officer Xing Junya (). Emperor Dezong recalled Li to Chang'an to serve as Zhongshu Ling and Taiwei (Â§™Â∞â, one of the Three Excellencies) and relieved him of all of his military duties. It was said that once Li returned to Chang'an, despite the suspicions that he was under, he nevertheless spoke honestly whenever he had opinions about the matters of state. In light of Zhang's involvement in Li's command being lifted, subsequently, when Zhang wanted Li Baozhen the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), and then Liu, to serve as the new commander of defense forces on the borders with Tufan, both Li Baozhen and Liu declined. Meanwhile, Zhang also drew resentment from other officials when he made major cuts into the ranks of prefectural and county officials ‚Äî eliminating about 1,000 positions ‚Äî hoping to use the savings in reduced salaries for military purposes, despite objections from Ma, Wei Lun (), and Bai Zhizhen (). By summer 787, Emperor Dezong and Tufan's chancellor Shang Jiezan () had negotiated a peace treaty, and the general Hun Jian, as Emperor Dezong's emissary, was set to meet with Shang at Pingliangchuan (Âπ≥Ê∂ºÂ∑ù, in modern Pingliang, Gansu). Li Sheng, fearing Tufan treachery, instructed Hun to be careful, but Zhang, hearing this, accused Li Sheng of interfering with the peace with Tufan. Emperor Dezong thus instructed Hun to relax, not to aggravate Tufan in any way. On July 8, 787,http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms- bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna;=%AD%F0&king;=%BCw%A9v&reign;=%ADs%A4%B8&yy;=3&ycanzi;=&leap;=1&mm;=5‚ÖÜ=19&dcanzi;= at the meeting site, Shang laid a trap for Hun and launched a sudden attack, killing and capturing many of Hun's attendants, but Hun escaped. When the news reached Chang'an, Emperor Dezong was so panicked that he considered fleeing Chang'an, but remained due to Li Sheng's advice. As a result of this debacle, Zhang claimed an illness and retired, while Emperor Dezong recalled Ma to the capital and stripped him of his command. Subsequently, the reduction in officer ranks was reversed under the advice of another chancellor, Li Mi. Meanwhile, Zhang's rivalry with another official ‚Äî Li Shuming () the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan) ‚Äî which formed when they governed neighboring circuits, led Zhang to carry out some additional actions intended to bring down Li Shuming. At that time, Li Shuming's son Li Shƒìng (ÊùéÊòá, note different tone and character than the great general) was repeatedly seen visiting Emperor Dezong's aunt Princess Gao, whose daughter was the wife and crown princess of Emperor Dezong's son and crown prince Li Song. He informed this to Emperor Dezong, intimating that Li Shƒìng was having an affair with Princess Gao. When Emperor Dezong asked Li Mi to investigate this, however, Li Mi correctly guessed that it was Zhang who informed Emperor Dezong of this and suggested no investigation, pointing out that Zhang's accusations also appeared to be intended to endanger Li Song. Emperor Dezong agreed, and thereafter moved Li Shƒìng to the position of head of Li Song's household, away from Princess Gao. Zhang died in winter 787 and was given posthumous honors. He was also given the posthumous name of Chengsu (ÊàêËÇÖ, meaning \\"successful and solemn\\"). His son Zhang Hongjing later served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Dezong's grandson Emperor Xianzong.

The show was picked up by the NBC Blue radio network and premiered at 10:30 p.m. Eastern Time on January 27, 1931. Thus, it became the first nationally broadcast radio soap opera. When Clara, Lu 'n Em was moved to a regular daytime time slot on February 15, 1932, it became the first networked daytime soap opera. The first daytime serial drama-by-installment program, network or otherwise, is widely considered by scholars of the genre to be Painted Dreams, when it premiered in October 1930. Clara, Lu, 'n Em continued in various forms through the 1930s and early 1940s on the NBC Blue Network and CBS, finally airing as a syndicated series in 1945. Background The series began as a Northwestern University sorority sketch by Louise Starkey (Clara), Isobel Carothers (Lu) and Helen King (Em). Rejection by several radio executives in Chicago led the trio to WGN. Program manager Henry Selinger was skeptical of their working without scripts, but their audition convinced him to let them perform without pay. They eventually began writing their own scripts and receiving pay. Super Suds was a sponsor of the program as early as August 1930. NBC As interest grew, they were sponsored by Colgate-Palmolive and were heard evenings on the NBC Blue Network from January 27, 1931, to February 12, 1932, before moving to weekdays from February 15, 1932, to March 23, 1934. From March 26, 1934, to January 10, 1936, they ran on the NBC (Red) network. On June 26, 1936, they returned to the NBC Blue Network, doing a weekly evening series, with music by Ted Fio Rito. The 30-minute program was sponsored by Frigidaire dealers. Characters and hiatus Story lines centered on three women who lived in a small-town duplex. Clara Roach and her family lived on one side of the duplex, Emma Krueger lived with her family on the other side. Widow Lulu Casey lived upstairs with her daughter Florabelle. When Carothers suddenly died January 8, 1937, at age 32, Starkey and King decided not to continue. Return on CBS When the program returned with Starkey and King in 1942 on CBS, another of their Northwestern University friends, Harriet Allyn, portrayed Lu.

The current editor is a Catholic priest, Fr Brian McKevitt, who refers to the publication as a 'newszine'. While it claims a circulation of 240,000 copies, its actual readership is difficult to establish since a substantial portion of its circulation is delivered door-to-door, with most of the remainder being available through Ireland's network of Catholic churches (who do not provide estimates of take-up). It is printed by Datascope, an independent publishing company in Enniscorthy and contains an appeal in each issue for donations totalling ‚Ç¨160,000 annually to remain in circulation. Political stance and editorial opinion Since September 2008, the front page has contained the following disclaimer text: \\"The content of the newspaper Alive! and the views expressed in it are those of the editor and contributors, and do not necessarily represent the views of the Irish Dominican Province\\". The majority of its articles are written anonymously. The publication strongly opposed the Nice Treaty and the Lisbon Treaty on all four occasions on which they were submitted to the Irish people, a position which drew criticism from Irish politicians such as Senator Paschal Donohoe on the grounds that its position could be erroneously interpreted by many Catholics as representing the official views of the Catholic hierarchy. TD Thomas Byrne criticised the publication, claiming that he was \\"bombarded\\" with its \\"anti- EU\\" views while attending Mass. Individual politicians and the Oireachtas sub- committee on Europe asked the Catholic Church and Se√°n Cardinal Brady to ban it from being distributed in churches. Senator Labhr√°s √ì Murch√∫ stated that it was \\"completely wrong\\" to suggest that Cardinal Brady should ban the publication from churches simply because it espoused views opposing the Lisbon treaty. Senator Ivana Bacik defended the criticism of the publication stating that it espoused extreme views that most moderate Catholics opposed and that it was the \\"equivalent of the paramilitary wing of the Catholic Church\\". Format A regular article entitled \\"Dumbag writes...!\\" features letters, purportedly from a devil named Dumbag, which highlight what the newspaper believes to be the folly of non-Catholic viewpoints. This feature is inspired by The Screwtape Letters by the Anglican writer, C.S. Lewis. The newspaper also features a column by Fr. Owen Gorman, an interview with a public personage about the role of religion in that person's life, a column dealing with perceived media bias against religion and Christianity and a Window on History article on a historical topic of relevance to the Catholic Church (such as the Penal Laws or the Protestant Reformation). Fr. Brian McKevitt Fr. Brian McKevitt from Dundalk, is a member of the Dominican Order, and based, in St. Mary's Priory, Tallaght. He is the founder and editor of Alive! In 2009, Fr. McKevitt attended a meeting in Roscommon of the John Paul II Society along with Declan Ganley (the founder of the now-defunct political organisation Libertas), Senator R√≥n√°n Mullen and a number of other conservative Roman Catholics..

In the anglophone and francophone world, however, he was also notorious as the alleged perpetrator of atrocities in Charleroi, Belgium, during the German invasion of 1914. Early life Bahrfeldt was born into a family from Prenzlau in the Uckermark. Joining the Corps of Cadets in 1869 he was made a Lieutenant in the 75th Infantry Regiment \\"Bremen\\" in 1873, stationed at Stade. Bahrfeldt had been interested in numismatics from his youth. He specialized in the coinage of the Roman Republic and the coins of Lower Saxony. Bahrfeldt commenced his numismatic researches while he was in the Army and he published his first numismatic essay in 1874. One year later he became co-editor of the Numismatisch-Sphragistischer Anzeiger. Zeitung f√ºr M√ºnz-, Siegel-, und Wappenkunde (published in Hannover). 3 years later he was assigned to the post of Regimental Adjutant. During this period he served as secretary for the local historical society and curated its coin collection. He also carried out excavations at the Perleberg site of the beaker people. On October 14, 1878, Bahrfeldt married in Gotha Elisabeth (Ella) Mary Charlotte Samwer (October 8, 1859, Gotha - October 19, 1954, Frankfurt/Main), the daughter of the jurist, professor of constitutional law and author Karl Friedrich Samwer (1819‚Äì1882), who was also a numismatist. In 1883 Bahrfeldt published in Vienna from Samwer's papers the History of the Older Roman Coinage from about 200 B.C. He followed this up with further publications about the coinage issued in the region between the Elbe and the Weser. In 1879 Bahrfeldt published, based on the previous work of Wilhelm Heinrich Jobelmann and Wilhelm Wittpenning, a revised History of the City of Stade. From 1882 to 1885 he studied at the Prussian Staff College. In 1911, Bahrfeldt was granted an honorary doctorate by the philosophical faculty of the University of Giessen and from 1921 onwards was honorary professor for numismatics at the University of Halle-Wittenberg. He was awarded the medal of the Royal Numismatic Society in 1912.http://numismatics.org.uk/medals-honorary- fellowship-prizes/the-societys-medal/ Late military career Bahrfeldt was promoted to Oberst in 1904, and to Generalmajor in 1908.University of Halle- Wittenberg,\\"Max von Bahrfeldt,\\" Catalogus Professorum. He commanded the 37th Infantry Division from 1911 till 1913. Being promoted to Generalleutnant on June 16, 1913, Bahrfeldt was ennobled as a member of the Prussian hereditary nobility (as part of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the reign of Kaiser Wilhelm II) and was awarded the Order of the Red Eagle 2nd class with oakleaves and the Order of the Crown 2nd class. In August 1914, at the start of First World War, Bahrfeldt was given command of the 19th Reserve Division, part of the X. Reserve Corps and the 2nd Army. He captured Charleroi on August 22, 1914 and, accused by the Allies of atrocities at Charleroi, in 1925 he was condemned to death in absentia by a Belgian court.; Max von Bahrfeldt, Kriegsverbrecher Nr. 10: Zur Erinnerung an das vor 10 Jahren durch das belgische Kriegsgericht zu Mons √ºber mich gef√§llte Todesurteil (Breslau, F.

He fought in the First Battle of Champagne and in June 1915 he was given command of the 10th Reserve Division and promoted to General der Infanterie. He led his division into the Battle of Verdun and was phased out of the Army in April 1916. Later life Bahrfeldt joined the Deutsche Vaterlandspartei upon its formation in 1917.

Early life Stokes was born in New York City on May 22, 1852. He was the son of James Boulter and Caroline (n√©e Phelps) Stokes; brother of Anson Phelps Stokes and Olivia Eggleston Phelps Stokes. One of his grandfathers was London merchant Thomas Stokes, one of the 13 founders of the London Missionary Society, and Anson Stokes later actively supported the American Bible Society, the American Tract Society and the American Peace Society. His other grandfather, Anson Greene Phelps, was a New York merchant, born in Connecticut and descended from an old Massachusetts family.

He was also a share holder in the Ansonia Clock Company. When his father died in August 1881, Stokes contested the will, sued his brother Anson for conspiring to throw him out of the family business, and gained a $1 million inheritance. He left Phelps Dodge and, from 1885 to 1890, he developed real estate on the Upper West Side. Stokes and the Building of the Upper West SideLuxury Apartment Houses of Manhattan: An Illustrated History By Andrew Alpern Published by Courier Dover Publications, (1992), pg 33 =Property developer= After his marriage in 1895, the couple moved into one of Stokes's new developments at 262 West 72nd Street. In 1898, Stokes began work on a new mansion at 4 East 54th Street designed by McKim, Mead and White. However, in 1900, just as the house was nearing completion, Rita Stokes filed for divorce, and neither ever lived in the house. In 1899, Stokes commissioned architect Paul E. Duboy (1857-1907) to build the greatest and grandest hotel in Manhattan, New York. The result was The Ansonia, named after Stokes' grandfather industrialist Anson Greene Phelps, located at 2109 Broadway between West 73rd and West 74th Streets. Opening in 1903, the $3 million Ansonia had 350 suites with several restaurants, a bank, a barbershop, a ballroom, a swimming pool and full hotel services, along with an imposing Parisian-style facade of turrets and balconies. 'A West Side Developer's Other Side' 'The New York Times' August 28, 2005 In 1907, the New York Board of Health planned to raid the Ansonia hotel's roof and confiscate the four pet geese and a pig, called Nanki-Poo, that they had been informed that Stokes kept there. Stokes and his butler hid the animals in the basement and convinced the inspector that the roof was animal-free. =Railroad venture= In 1900, as reported in The New York Times, Stokes bought at auction, for $25,000, the Chesapeake & Western Railroad, a bucolic venture that in an earlier incarnation, circa 1870s, was to be part of the Washington, Cincinnati & St. Louis Railroad, linking through the Shenandoah Valley at Harrisonburg, Virginia and into the central and southern coal producing areas of West Virginia and southern Ohio. The Chesapeake & Western had already been capitalized with $811,200 of common stock, $608,400 of preferred stock and $1,419,000 of first mortgage bonds. Stokes renamed it the Tidewater & West Virginia, but just a year later in 1901 renamed it the Chesapeake Western Railway. In an attempt to revive the plan to link more of east with west, Stokes pushed west and laid 13 miles of rail to Stokesville, west of Bridgewater in 1902, and east to Elkton. The Allegheny and Blue Ridge Mountains proved to be formidable obstacles to further expansion, and without serious financial backing there was no chance of true success. Stokes' best chance for success came in the form of an offer by Colonel Henry H. Rogers, a major stakeholder in Standard Oil, who attempted to buy the 40-mile railroad from Stokes, so he could complete the route as intended, but Stokes' asking price was far too high and Rogers turned down the offer and chartered his own railroad, the Virginian Railway, which became one of the nation's most efficient and best run railroads. Eventually, the Chesapeake Western Railway became a subsidiary of the Norfolk Southern and survives to this day, primarily linking Harrisonburg to Staunton, Virginia. =Publications= In 1917, Stoke wrote The Right to be Well Born; or, Horse Breeding in its Relation to Eugenics which was published by C. J. O'Brien in New York. In this book, Stokes, who was a horse breeder, extended his theories from the equine, advocating selective breeding in humans and the grading of men who are candidates for marriage. He writes that the genealogical records of the working class should be kept so that prospective employers can assess their capabilities. The book was so ill-received that the publishers sued Stokes for the recovery of their costs. Personal life In 1895, aged 43, Stokes married 19-year-old Rita Hernandez de Alba Acosta (1875‚Äì1929), the daughter of Cuban √©migr√© Ricardo de Acosta. Rita's youngest sister, Mercedes de Acosta, wrote in her autobiography that \\"when Rita finally decided to marry Will Stokes it was, I believe, because she felt his wealth could open doors... But she paid a high price for any material gain.\\" Together, Rita and William were the parents of one son, whom they called \\"Weddie\\". According to her sister, Rita hated the child and could hardly bring herself to hold him. In 1900, Rita filed for divorce and the settlement was said to be $2 million, a record at that time. * William Earl Dodge Stokes Jr. (1896‚Äì1992), who ran Hotel Ansonia after he inherited the property from his father.Grave Memorial. https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199083607/william-earl_dodge-stokes In 1907, Stokes was sued by a woman named Lucy Randolph for child support. She claimed that she had met Stokes in the Ansonia and that he had told her that he wanted to have a child with her. After getting her pregnant Stokes had ignored her. Although it was proved in court that Stokes had been intimate with her, and that he had previously given her regular payments, the case against him was dismissed on a technicality. In February 1911, Stokes, then aged 59, secretly married the 24-year-old Helen Blanche Ellwood (1885‚Äì1951). He married in secret because when he was divorced by his first wife, Rita de Acosta Stokes, the judge had told him he could not marry again during her lifetime. In June 1911, Stokes was shot and wounded by a 22-year-old vaudeville actress, Lillian Graham. She claimed that Stokes had attacked her because he was angry at her refusal to return compromising letters he had written her. For his part, Stokes claimed that Graham had been trying to blackmail him and that she had attacked him when this had been unsuccessful. Graham was found not guilty. Together, they were the parents of: * James Ellwood Stokes (d. 1998), also a developer and philanthropist. * Helen Muriel Stokes (1915‚Äì2010), who married Charles Jules Lowen, Jr. in 1941. After his death in 1956, she married Donald F. Magarrell, who died in 1980. In 1989, she married childhood friend Gerald H. Phipps. In 1918, Stokes filed for divorce from Helen Stokes. Stokes was represented by attorney Max Steuer, and started what proved to be a very acrimonious legal case. He claimed that she had had affairs with her cousin, his own son and at least nine other men. She stated that his witnesses were lying, and that he had had numerous affairs throughout their marriage, that with Lillian Graham being just one. She added that he kept several dozen chickens in their apartment at the Ansonia. In February 1922 Rita de Acosta Lydig appeared before the Supreme Court of Justice on behalf of Helen Stokes, claiming that Stokes used to beat her during their marriage. 'The New York Times' February 4, 1922 In 1923, after paying $1 million in legal fees,'A Filthy Mess' Time Magazine November 12, 1923 Stokes' request for a divorce from his wife was denied; she won a counterclaim for separation. Stokes was tried for conspiracy to defame her, but was acquitted in 1925. Stokes died on May 18, 1926, aged 74, and The New York Times noted in his obituary that, even though Stokes had been involved in \\"almost incessant litigation,\\" he had left about $8 million in his will. However, in 1928 that estimate was reduced to $300,000, and even that would be erased, The Times said, \\"if his estate lost all the many pending lawsuits that plagued his controversial career, even after death\\".

When the Boxing Day tsunami struck, he used the disaster to \\"evacuate\\" the villagers and build more hotels in the place. James, disgusted, quits the mission and joins Kyle in a scheme to embarrass Abdullah. James' younger sister Lauren Adams and a younger agent, Kevin Sumner, are also going on the mission. James sneaks into Lauren's room early in the morning and installs a tracking device in her mobile phone. He is about to leave when his friend Bruce Norris (who has broken up with his girlfriend Bethany Parker) agrees to join them. Together, they go and meet Helena Bayliss, runner of charity Guilt Trips, journalist Hugh Verhoeven and former businessman Dion Frei, who are working to discredit Abdullah. Lauren and Kevin go on a shopping trip with the son and daughter of Tan Abdullah, and James, using the tracking device in Lauren's phone, invites paparazzi to their locations, embarrassing Tan Abdullah's family. Meanwhile, Frei, claiming to act on behalf of the French Government, offers Abdullah a weapons deal that is more favourable than Britain's offer and secretly films Abdullah making disparaging remarks about the Malaysian Prime Minister. When Abdullah's actions are revealed to the media, Abdullah commits suicide to avoid further embarrassment. James and Bruce return to CHERUB campus, where Chairwoman Zara Asker implies that she knows what they were up to. However, she decides not to take any action against them. James leaves for Stanford University in California, but changing his name to \\"Robert James Choke\\" for post-CHERUB life. A year later, he returns to London to visit Kerry and Lauren. The three visit Gwen Choke's grave, and Kerry tells James and Lauren that their mother would be very proud of them. In the epilogue of the book, Bethany Parker is expelled from CHERUB because she breached security by continuing to have a relationship with someone she met outside campus on a mission. Kerry leaves CHERUB and joins with James at Stanford University. Even though Kerry was suspicious that James cheated on her during his first year of college, he did not. CHERUB chairwoman's dog Meatball is also revealed to have become a father of three puppies. Lauren's father Ron dies from throat cancer shortly after being released from prison, and James meets his biological father after seeing his name on one of his school textbooks (hence the origin of James' above average Mathematics skills).  Release information  The book was released on 27 August 2010 in hardback edition, (2 September 2010 in some locations). The paperback version was released in May 2011. A special edition of the book was available at W H Smith with an orange cover. The book was the second in the series to be released in hardback format.

The company was established in December 2012 and is based in Alzenau, Germany. Hyundai Motorsport is primarily responsible for the Hyundai's works team in World Rally Championship. In 2015, its customer racing division was established to provide competitive machinery in the R5 and later TCR motorsport categories.  History  = WRC = Hyundai competed in the F2 class of the World Rally Championship in 1998 and 1999. It was run by British company Motor Sports Development (MSD), with David Whitehead as team principal. In September 1999, Hyundai unveiled the Accent WRC, a World Rally Car based on the Hyundai Accent. The Hyundai World Rally Team debuted the car at the 2000 Swedish Rally and achieved their first top- ten result at that year's Rally Argentina, when Alister McRae and Kenneth Eriksson finished seventh and eighth, respectively. Eriksson later drove the car to fifth place in New Zealand and fourth in Australia. In 2001, Hyundai debuted a new evolution of the Accent WRC, which was intended to improve reliability, but the performance of the car was still not good enough to challenge the four big teams (Ford World Rally Team, Mitsubishi, Peugeot and Subaru). However, at the season-ending Rally GB, the team achieved their best result with McRae finishing fourth and Eriksson sixth. For the 2002 season, Hyundai hired the four-time world champion Juha Kankkunen, along with Freddy Loix and Armin Schwarz. Kankkunen's fifth place in New Zealand was the team's best result, but it managed to edge out ≈†koda and Mitsubishi by one point in the battle for fourth place in the manufacturers' world championship. In September 2003, after a season hampered by budget constraints, Hyundai withdraw from the WRC ending the partnership with MSD. 9 years later at the 2012 Paris Motor Show Hyundai announced that it would be returning to the WRC for 2014, using the i20 model built to World Rally Car specifications. Hyundai nominated Juho H√§nninen, Bryan Bouffier and Chris Atkinsonas the official test drivers for 2013. On 19 December 2012, Hyundai Motorsport GmbH was established in Alzenau, Germany, responsible for Hyundai's World Rally Championship programme.  2014 WRC season  Thierry Neuville was named lead driver for Hyundai Motorsport's World Rally Championship programme and, together with his co-driver Nicolas Gilsoul, he has piloted the i20 WRC ever since the team's debut at the Monte-Carlo Rallyin January. Also competing for Hyundai in 2014 were Dani Sordo and co-driver Marc Mart√≠, who entered six events. H√§nninen contested six rallies, while fellow test drivers Atkinson and Bouffier entered two each. Hayden Paddon and John Kennard joined the team for six rallies. Neuville was the first driver to score a top-three finish for Hyundai in WRC. He finished third in Rally M√©xico. He and Hyundai also took the team's first victory at that year's Rallye Deutschland.  2015 WRC season  For the 2015 WRC season, Neuville, Sordo, and Paddon returned to pilot the Hyundai i20 WRC. All three drivers added to the team's podium tally at Rally Sweden (Neuville), Rally Italia Sardegna (Neuville, Paddon), and Rally de Espa√±a (Sordo). Dutch driver Kevin Abbring competed in five events for the team. Hyundai Motorsport finished third in the manufacturers‚Äô championship.  2016 WRC season  2016 saw Hyundai Motorsport regularly challenging for podiums and victories. Paddon took the team's first victory with the New Generation Hyundai i20 WRC in Rally Argentina. Neuville won Rally Italia Sardegna and scored seven podiums, ultimately finishing runner-up behind Volkswagen driver S√©bastien Ogier. The team finished as vice champions in the manufacturers‚Äô championship.  2017 WRC season  New regulations for the 2017 season saw the birth of the Hyundai i20 Coupe WRC. Hyundai announced a crew line up of Neuville and Gilsoul, Sordo and Mart√≠, Paddon and Kennard. Paddon was later joined by new co-driver Seb Marshall. Andreas Mikkelsen and co-driver Anders J√¶ger later signed for three events. Neuville scored four wins and eight podiums in 2017, again finishing runner up to Ogier, who had switched to M-Sport. Hyundai finished second in the manufacturers‚Äô standings for the second consecutive year.  2018 WRC season  At the season launch at Autosport International, Hyundai unveiled its 2018 crew line-up. Neuville and Mikkelsen would compete in every round, with Sordo and Paddon alternating events. Sordo was reunited with his previous co- driver Carlos del Barrio for the season. A four-car entry for Rally Portugal ensured equal appearances for Sordo and Paddon. Neuville secured three wins and claimed six podiums, but was again outscored by Ogier.  2019 WRC season  For 2019, Hyundai Motorsport announced it would field four crews for the WRC season: Neuville and Gilsoul, Mikkelsen and J√¶ger-Amland, Sordo and del Barrio, and S√©bastien Loeb and Daniel Elena. Craig Breen and Paul Nagle later joined the squad for Rally Finland and Wales Rally GB as the team focused its efforts on winning the manufacturers‚Äô championship. Hyundai Motorsport sealed the 2019 Manufacturer's Title after Rally Catalunya as Rally Australia was called off amid widespread bush fires in the area.

The car was first tested in January 2016 and made its competitive debut in the WRC2 class at Tour de Corse. The i20 R5 quickly made a name for itself, taking wins and championships in local and regional championships around the world. = Hyundai i30 N TCR = In early 2017 Hyundai Motorsport announced it was developing an i30 N touring car based on TCR regulation. The car made its debut in the Touring Car Endurance Series 24h of Misano before being made available to customers by the end of the year. For the 2018 World Touring Car Cup(WTCR), two teams entered the Hyundai i30 N TCR: YMR with Yvan Muller and Thed Bj√∂rk, and BRC Racing Team with Gabriele Tarquini and Norbert Michelisz. Tarquini clinched the inaugural WTCR Driver's Championship, and YMR secured the Teams' Championship. BRC Racing Team entered four i30 N TCR cars in to the 2019 World Touring Car Cup season. Reigning drivers‚Äô champion Tarquini and teammate Michelisz returned to compete with BRC Hyundai N Squadra Corse team. Newcomers to WTCR Augusto Farfus and Nicky Catsburg signed to BRC Hyundai N LUKOIL Racing Team for the season. The i30 N TCR won the USAC Pirelli World Challenge TCR class in 2018 with Bryan Herta Autosport in owner and manufacturer championships. = Veloster N TCR = Hyundai added the Hyundai Veloster, a car sold in some markets where the i30 is not sold, as a TCR option in 2019. The Veloster N competed in the 2019 Michelin Pilot Challenge and the 2019 24 Hours N√ºrburgring under the Hyundai Motorsport N marque alongside a Hyundai i30 N TCR. Both cars finished on the podium of the TCR class.

McVee ran a hotel and store at 108 Mile House on the Cariboo Wagon Road from 1875 to 1885 during the Cariboo Gold Rush. Along with her husband Jim McVee and her son-in-law Al Riley, she is said to have killed many miners for their gold and kidnapped women for sale to miners as white slaves. The story has achieved local prominence, but documentary evidence is absent. Her story was the subject of the 2019 graphic novel Agnes, Murderess by Canadian writer Sarah Leavitt.  Crimes  The actions attributed to Agnus McVee and her accomplices are multiple murders, kidnappings, torture, and white slavery. The murders were of traveling gold miners (most likely killed for their gold). The kidnappings were of eight young women who were tied up in the hotel basement. The women were mistreated until they were obedient and then sold to miners.  Capture and punishment  The story goes that a miner, Jim MacDonald, wished to buy a young girl from the McVees. Agnus agreed to sell MacDonald a 17-year-old girl. The next morning, Jim McVee followed MacDonald down the Cariboo Wagon Road. McVee murdered MacDonald and took all his money. The next morning, Agnus McVee poisoned her husband in retaliation for this murder. The girl, however, was able to escape and to identify Jim McVee to the North West Mounted Police. Upon investigation, the police found McVee, Al Riley (her brother-in-law), Jim McVee's body, and eight young girls in the basement of the McVee's hotel. The police arrested McVee and Riley and the pair were taken to Fort Kamloops. They were charged and convicted of murder and kidnapping. They were then transported to New Westminster and incarcerated in the New Westminster jail. McVee committed suicide in 1885 while in the jail by swallowing poison. Riley was hanged shortly after.  Controversy  The Agnus McVee story seems to have originated from a single source: According to Maryanne Rutledge, president of the 100 Mile and District Historical Society, the story comes from an out-of-publication booklet titled \\"Lost Treasure in BC #3\\" by Larry Lazeo of Fort Langley. The author received the details from an old-timer. The tale has become widespread in the 100 Mile district and has expanded beyond it. In 2006, Red Barn Productions filmed the story for CTV's Travel and Discovery series, intended for satellite broadcast in late September or October 2006. The story is also on a BC Government web page of historical information. One form of evidence that is sometimes given is that caches of gold have been found in the area. Rutledge states \\"In 1929, there was a farmer who unearthed a cache of gold in bags. More recently, when a nearby airport was built, excavation dug up a sum of cash from that era.\\" Joyce, Greg. \\"The Murdering Madame of 108 Mile House.\\" Prince George Citizen, Prince George, B.C. Sep 1, 2001. pg. 13. However, documentary evidence for the story is absent. An article by Greg Joyce in the Prince George Citizen newspaper discusses the story of the McVee murders. He states that there are no documents of ownership of the 108 Mile Hotel during the decade that McVee is supposed to have run it. Missing persons records do not list anyone who lodged at the hotel between 1875 and 1885 as reported missing. No police records of the arrest or trial have been found \\"despite Rutledge's extensive searches in Kamloops, New Westminster, and in the provincial archives in Victoria.\\" Furthermore, there are no death certificates for either McVee or Riley.

Based in Lexington, Kentucky, IITA is the only association focused solely on international inbound travel to the United States. The association has several membership categories for various travel and tourism industry sectors: Inbound Tour Operators are travel organizations (for example, receptive tour operators, destination management companies, or incentive management companies) with offices in the United States deriving more than 75% of their annual revenue from inbound tourism services to the United States. Tour Operators are domestic or international companies with packaged product to the United States promoted via brochure, website or other electronic means. These companies do not currently meet the requirement of 75% of revenue coming from international business. Associate Members are destination marketing and management organizations (including international, national or subnational bodies, state or provincial tourism offices, convention and visitors bureaus, and chambers of commerce). They promote cities, regions, states, or the whole United States as a travel destination. They provide travel services (transportation, restaurants, attractions), link to other organizations engaged in selling products and services to Inbound Tour Operator Members, and other organizations with an interest in international inbound travel, like government agencies, educational institutions, travel trade associations, and travel trade media. Industry Service Providers provide non-travel goods and services used by Inbound Tour Operator or Associate Members in conducting normal business activities. These goods and services may include accounting, legal printing, insurance, advertising, technical, and similar other goods and services. Sustaining Members are leading tour suppliers (Associate Members) that comprise the Advisory Board, which provides advice and input to the association's elected Board of Directors.  History  Beginning as RSA in 1991, RSAA formed to associate major receptive tour operators and suppliers in the New York and New Jersey region. As a result of continuing interest and growth from across the country, RSA grew into a national organization. RSA joined forces with ITSA, the International Travel Services Association to form RSAA in September, 2004. ITSA was formed and founded in 1993, by receptive tour operators and destination management companies to create a united voice to address issues of importance, educational opportunities, and networking with new business partners. In 2012, RSAA became the first travel association to enter into a strategic partnership with the U.S. Commercial Service. This partnership helped RSAA and the U.S. Commercial Service promote travel to the United States and enable international operators to form relationships with U.S. receptive operators. Today, IITA is involved in a wide range of industry activities, focusing on working with suppliers, regulatory agencies and travel promotion bureaus to improve the quality of travel related services for foreign visitors. IITA also addresses economic and public policy issues affecting tourism at local, state, and federal levels. Furthermore, international tour operators, as well as international entities that promote travel to the United States, are eligible for membership in IITA. More than ever, IITA serves as the bridge to international inbound business and is committed to serving the needs of its members and to advancing the industry as a whole.  Events  The largest annual event is the IITA Summit. IITA inbound tour operators, suppliers and industry service providers from across the country gather in a new location each year for the opportunity to learn about current happenings in the industry, strategically plan for the year, and network. In addition to Summit membership events are held quarterly in various destinations. These events are open to members and those interested in learning more about the association.  Inbound International Travel  The international inbound travel industry brings in 75 million visitors with $175 billion in spending annually.https://www.ustravel.org/system/files/Media%20Root/Document/Research_Fact- Sheet_International-Inbound.pdf IITA represents the major inbound operators in the United States who inbound package tour business in the United States. IITA also addresses economic and public policy issues affecting tourism at local, state, and federal levels. It is interested in building awareness of the unique role receptives play in linking suppliers from all parts of the United States with the global travel industry.  Governance  The chairman of the association is Gary Schluter of Rocky Mountain Holiday Tours and the executive director is Lisa Simon, former president of the National Tour Association.http://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Tour-Operators/Inbound- travel-group-names-Simon-executive-director IITA offices are located in Lexington, Kentucky. The association is governed by a board of directors that consists of 16 members, supported by an Advisory Board currently consisting of 16 suppliers. The association is managed by Associations International. On August 22, 2011, RSAA announced that it had formed a strategic partnership with VISIT USA - Europe. On April 12, 2012, the association changed its bylaws to create an international membership class. In February 2016, RSAA re-branded as the International Inbound Travel Association (IITA) and launched their new website inboundtravel.org.

This has been done through an annual GameCity Festival, described as the \\"Sundance of the video games world\\", the GameCity Prize since 2011, and the National Videogame Arcade since 2015. Each year, GameCity hosts talks and presentations from individuals and companies working in the games industry.  GameCity Festivals  The GameCity Festival has run annually in Nottingham since 2006. Gamecity 3 was held over Halloween 2008. To coincide with this, GameCity arranged a successful world record attempt at the largest number of people to dress as zombies in one place. The record was set to 1227 people, although even more 'unregistered zombies' were present at the attempt. Also during the 2008 event, the National Videogame Archive for the UK was launched with the Save the Videogame campaign. This was led by the recording of the first public Director Commentary event, with Martin Hollis and David Doak playing Goldeneye 64 live. GameCity Squared took place from the 27th to 31 October 2009. Events in 2009 included: Brickstock (a LEGO Rock Band celebration); Elite: Paper Universe - which celebrated 25 years of Elite by bringing together David Braben, Ian Bell, Robert Holdstock and others involved in its creation; Crysis: LIVE - a large scale re-enactment of Crysis; and various industry talks from Jagex and Masaya Matsuura. The final location of the Keita Takahashi-designed playground was also revealed as being Woodthorpe Grange Park in Nottingham. GameCity 7 took place in Nottingham from the 20th to 27 October 2012. There were several events held over the 8 day festival, including keynotes from Leigh Alexander, Phil Fish, Adam Saltsman, Ed Stern and many more. The festival also had the first UK showing of the LEGO: Lord of the Rings game, demonstrated by LEGO's Creative Director Jonathan Smith. A World Record was broken on the final day of the festival, as GameCity attempted to host the World's Largest Practical Science experiment. 292 people participated in the event, succeeding the previous record of 276. = GameCity Prize = The GameCity Prize was announced on 15 September 2011. As part of the annual GameCity Festival it is awarded for a game's \\"accomplishments and contribution to popular culture\\". Minecraft won the first GameCity Prize in 2011.  National Videogame Arcade  In March 2015, GameCity opened the UK's first permanent cultural centre for videogames. Located in the centre of Nottingham, the National Videogame Arcade is \\"a place where the whole family can discover videogames, play videogames and make videogames\\". Spread across five floors, the NVA has three floors of playable galleries showcasing games both old and new, and exploring videogame culture through unique interactive exhibits. Alongside this, the NVA further features a floor dedicated to education and the National Curriculum, allowing students a hands-on experience of game-making through a variety of workshops. In 2016, the NVA in Nottingham fell into cash flow difficulties. An eleventh hour investment by a director-led consortium, led by director Iain Simons, saved all 40 jobs. The destination was being taken into administration in August 2016. In 2018, the NVA closed down in Nottingham. The same team has since launched the UK National Videogame Museum in Sheffield.

In the jury room, an initial vote is 11 to 1 in favor of guilty. Juror #8 (Robert Cummings) is the holdout voting not guilty. Juror #3 (Franchot Tone) criticizes Juror #8 as being \\"out in left field.\\" They go once around the table, each juror having an opportunity to express his point of view. Juror #10 (Edward Arnold) focuses on the neighbor who testified that she saw the defendant stab his father. Juror #7 (Paul Hartman) focuses on the defendant's record -- reform school at age 15 for stealing a car, arrested for knife fighting, and he comes from slums that are breeding grounds for criminals. Juror #5 (Lee Phillips) takes offense and points out that he's lived in a slum his whole life -- \\"maybe it still smells on me.\\" Juror #8 asks for the alleged murder weapon, a switch knife, to be brought into the jury room. Juror #4 points out that the shopkeeper where defendant purchased the knife testified it was the only one he had in stock and that it's a very strange knife. When the knife is brought into the jury room, Juror #8 pulls an identical knife from his pocket. He purchased it the prior night at the junk shop around the corner from the defendant's house. Juror #8 asks for a secret ballot. If there are still 11 guilty votes, Juror #8 will go along. The votes are handed in. =Act II= There are now only 10 guilty votes. Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney) admits that he was the one who changed his vote. Juror #8 focuses on the noise from the elevated train that passed by as the murder took place. One of the witnesses, an old man, claimed that he heard the defendant say, \\"I'm going to kill you,\\" and then heard the body drop one second later. He questions how the witness could have heard these things, at a distance, with the train roaring by. Juror #5 changes his vote to not guilty. The vote is now 9-3. Juror #8 next questions how the old man who's had a stroke and walks with a cane could have gotten up out of bed and run through his apartment to see the defendant running down the stairs. The old man testified this happened only 15 seconds after the murder. Juror #3 says the old man may have been confused when he said 15 seconds: \\"He's an old man. You saw him. Half the time he was confused. How can he be positive about anything?\\" Juror #3 and the others pause, reacting to the import of Juror #3's question. Juror #8 performs a reenactment to show that the old man could not have gotten up and walked that distance in 15 seconds. Juror #3 complains about Juror #8's dishonesty and says the kid's got to burn. When Juror #8 calls Juror #3 a sadist, Juror #3 lunges and threatens to kill him. =Act III= A new vote is taken. It is now 6-6. Juror #2 (John Beal) is troubled by the angle of the stab wound. Juror #5 has experience with switch blades and says they are typically used with an underhand motion, but the wound here was from an overhand motion. Another vote is taken, and it's 9-3 in favor of acquittal. Jurors 3, 4 and 10 are now the holdouts. Juror #10 focuses on race: \\"How can you believe that this kid is innocent? You know how these people lie . . . They don't know what the truth is . . . They don't need any big reason to kill someone either . . . That's the way they are. . . Human life doesn't mean as much to them as it does to us . . . They haven't got any feelings. . . .

The program looks to tap into the community of area specialists and other university researchers, particularly those who work on Islam, Iraq, China, and related areas.Minerva Initiative, http://minerva.dtic.mil/ Since its establishment in 2008, the Department of Defense has awarded over 70 grants to private researchers. Grants are awarded on an annual basis for research projects that typically last three years. In 2011 the DoD hosted the first annual Minerva Conference. The event has since become an annual gathering in September for Minerva researchers, DoD keynote speakers, and scholars to highlight the most relevant research conducted through the program's support. History In 2008, the project was provided $50 million by the United States Department of Defense to fund research on five separate themes. When the program began in 2008 project funding was split between DoD and the National Science Foundation.https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=112015 Since that time, all projects have been funded solely by the DoD. The goal was to create improved relations between the Department of Defense and the universities and to develop knowledge that the military can benefit from in the long term. Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates commissioned the Minerva Initiative under the vision of \\"... a consortia[sic] of universities that will promote research in specific areas.\\"http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=1228 Originally, Secretary Gates proposed four principal focus areas: 1) Chinese Military and Technology Studies 2) Iraqi and Terrorist Perspective Projects 3) Religious and Ideological Studies, and 4) New Disciplines Project and 5) Open Category. Since its establishment, the Minerva Initiative has expanded the breadth of sponsored research to include a wide range of academic disciplines and topics [see Ongoing Research]. The program continues to fund research on the most important social science topics for universities like Arizona State University, which recently received a grant to support research on terrorists' use of social media.http://www.hstoday.us/briefings/industry-news/single- article/arizona-state-university-awarded-minerva-grant-to-research-terrorist- use-of-social-media/8ccb655066e27c7103573a96721f3bae.html Purpose The stated goal of the Minerva Initiative \\"is to improve DoD's basic understanding of the social, cultural, behavioral, and political forces that shape regions of the world of strategic importance to the U.S.\\" The program seeks to achieve this by sponsoring research designed to bring together universities, research institutions, and individual scholars. Three key priorities reflect the objectives of the Secretary of Defense for the Minerva Initiative: > \\"1) Leverage and focus the resources of the Nation's top universities. 2) > Seek to define and develop foundational knowledge about sources of present > and future conflict with an eye toward better understanding of the political > trajectories of key regions of the world. 3) Improve the ability of DoD to > develop cutting-edge social science research, foreign area and > interdisciplinary studies that is developed and vetted by the best scholars > in these fields.\\" Ongoing research As of 2015 the Minerva Initiative's priority research areas fall within four categories: > I. Identity, Influence, and Mobilization II. Contributors to Societal > Resilience and Change III. Power and Deterrence IV. Innovations in National > Security, Conflict, and Cooperation A list of all research awards made since the start of the Minerva Initiative are listed at the program's site: https://web.archive.org/web/20091212104216/http://minerva.dtic.mil/funded.html. In 2015, the Minerva Steering Committee received over 300 applications (297 white papers and 46 full proposals). Controversy The program's funding of social science research for national security purposes has proven controversial. Although many scholars support Minerva, at the program's start a number of academic researchers sounded public alarm about the prospect of Defense Department funding for research. In 2008 the American Anthropological Association sent a public letter suggesting that the funding be transferred to a different body, such as the National Science Foundation (NSF). Hugh Gusterson, a prominent anthropologist at George Mason University, wrote a series of articles in a variety of venues that have attracted significant attention, The journalist Nafeez Ahmed has expressed concern that Minerva research, in its effort to understand mass mobilization, may be targeting peaceful activists, NGOs and protest movements. Others believe social science should continue to emphasize security issues but worry that DoD funding will bias findings.

The gloss occurs from the abrasive action of silica in both wild and cultivated stems of cereal grasses, meaning the occurrence of reaping tools with sickle gloss doesn't necessarily imply agriculture. The first documented appearance of sickle-gloss is found on flint knapped blades in the Natufian culture (12,500 to 9500 BC) in the Middle East, primarily in Israel.  How sickle- gloss forms  Sickle-gloss has been recognized as a characteristic of reaping grasses since the 1930s, at least. There is a general consensus that sickle- gloss occurs after the reaping of grasses and it may form in as little as a few hours of work. However, it may require more time to accumulate enough sickle-gloss for archaeological preservation. It is also speculated that the gloss may accumulate from cutting canes or reeds, woodworking or perhaps even hoeing or digging. It may be possible to distinguish between different types of glosses on a macro or microscopic level.  Gloss lines  Direction of the gloss lines are relative to the work edge of a sickle. Gloss lines rarely penetrate more than 5 mm on the face of the segment. Later period sickles were more likely to show gloss patterns that were parallel or near parallel to working edges.  Importance of context  At sites with sickle-gloss, it is reasonable to assume that there were sickles used for varying lengths of time. Sickles that lack gloss may be assumed to be unused or unfinished (since flint sickles only require a few hours to accumulate sickle-gloss.)  Controversy  According to Lithics After the Stone Age: A Handbook of Stone Tools from the Levant, there is much debate over the actual formation of sickle-gloss, focusing on whether the gloss results from abrasive polishing of silica in the flint artifact or whether a silica coating is added from silica in the grasses that are harvested. According to \\"Cutting Graminae Tools and 'Sickle Gloss' Formation\\", there are at least four main concepts that have been invoked to try to explain the origins of sickle-gloss: * Gloss is a result from working with plant materials in which the tool used forms a silica gel.

It was created in 1998 after University Avenue was vacated by U.S. Highway 218 (US 218), which had recently moved to a new freeway a few miles north. Iowa 934 extended from the Iowa 27 / Iowa 58 freeway in Cedar Falls, which was constructed at the same time as the US 218 freeway, to US 63 (Sergeant Road). Route description Iowa 934 began along University Avenue at an interchange with Iowa Highway 27 and Iowa Highway 58 in Cedar Falls. It traveled east past College Square Mall and the restaurants which surrounded it before turned to the southeast at Waterloo Road. It passed through a residential neighborhood followed by a commercial area dotted with auto dealerships and restaurants. Just into Waterloo, University Avenue met Greenhill Road at an unusual partial cloverleaf interchange. From Greenhill Road, it continued southeast, passing many restaurants which served as a buffer from the road. Just before Ansborough Avenue, Iowa 934 turned to the east, straightening out for the rest of the trip. from its eastern end, University Avenue crossed Black Hawk Creek, a tributary of the Cedar River. The highway ended at an intersection with Sergeant Road, which carries US 63\\\\. The intersection with US 63 was less than away from US 63's interchange with US 218. History Prior to the creation of Iowa 934, US 218 followed University Avenue. As the Leo P. Rooff Expressway was being built, US 218 was gradually rerouted off of University. US 218 had been completely removed from University Avenue by 1997. In 1998, the Iowa Department of Transportation took over the segment of University Avenue from the Iowa 58 expressway to US 63, designating it Iowa 934. On May 12, 2014, the Cedar Falls city council accepted an agreement with the Iowa DOT to transfer control of Iowa 934 within the city limits. The DOT paid the City of Cedar Falls $20 million to complete the transfer on July 21. A similar agreement in Waterloo is expected later in 2014.

McMahon; July 7, 1898 ‚Äì August 5, 1985) was an American college and professional American football player and coach. He played and coached both for Harvard University and in the National Football League (NFL). Horween played left halfback, right halfback, fullback, and center for the unbeaten Harvard Crimson football teams of 1919, which won the 1920 Rose Bowl, and 1920. He was voted an All-American. Horween also played four seasons in the NFL, as a fullback, halfback, and blocking back (quarterback) for the Racine Cardinals and the Chicago Cardinals. He was a player-coach for the Cardinals. Later, he was Harvard's head football coach, from 1925 to 1930. His brother Ralph Horween was also an All-American football player for Harvard, and also played and coached in the NFL for the Cardinals. They were the last Jewish brothers to play in the NFL until Geoff Schwartz and Mitchell Schwartz, in the 2000s. After retiring from football, Horween and his brother inherited and ran the family leather tannery business, Horween Leather Company. Early and personal life Rose Horween, Ralph Horween, Arnold Horween, and Isidore Horween Horween's parents, Isidore and Rose (Rabinoff), immigrated to Chicago from Ukraine in the Russian Empire in 1892. During his youth the family changed its name to Horween from its original name, which was either Horwitz or Horowitz. Horween was Jewish, and was born in Chicago, Illinois. He was the brother of Ralph Horween, who was two years older. They were the last Jewish brothers to play in the NFL until offensive tackles Geoff Schwartz and Mitchell Schwartz in the 2000s. He played high school football at center and fullback for four years at Francis W. Parker School. He was captain of the football team in his senior year. Horween was 5' 11.5\\" (1.82 m), and weighed 206 pounds (93 kg). In 1928, he married Marion Eisendrath, daughter of leather tycoon William Eisendrath. College and Navy career Horween followed his older brother to Harvard University, where they played together on the Harvard Crimson football team, in 1916. In his freshman year, he played both football (as a fullback) and baseball (as a pitcher), and was a member of the track team as a shotputter. The next year, he enlisted in the United States Navy during World War I, in April 1917. He was promoted to ensign in October 1917, eventually reaching the rank of lieutenant. He served on a destroyer in the Atlantic and was discharged in 1919, when he returned to Harvard. Horween played left halfback, right halfback, fullback, and center for the Harvard Crimson, and was a First-Team All-American, from 1919 to 1920. In both 1919 and 1920 Harvard was undefeated (9‚Äì0‚Äì1 and 8‚Äì0‚Äì1, respectively). In 1919, Donald Grant Herring ranked him the Second-Team fullback on the Princeton-Yale-Harvard composite team. Horween was unanimously elected the Harvard Crimson's first Jewish captain in 1920. That year, he kicked a field goal against Yale in a 9‚Äì0 victory, and a field goal against the Centre Colonels. He was part of the unbeaten 1919 team that won the 1920 Rose Bowl against the Oregon, 7‚Äì6, as he kicked the extra point that decided the game, and Harvard relied in part on his running game. It remains the only bowl game appearance in Harvard history. The New York Times wrote: \\"The way he smashed through the line was considerable... there were even some protests that this dark-haired, sturdily built Crimson fullback was a little too rough.\\" In 1920 he was chosen Walter Camp third team All-American and selected by a number of newspapers to the All-America first team. He graduated from Harvard in 1921. NFL career Horween played fullback, tailback, and blocking back (quarterback) in the National Football League for four years, in 32 games, for the Racine Cardinals (in the American Professional Football Association, the predecessor to the NFL) in 1921 and the Chicago Cardinals (as the Cardinals changed their name) from 1922 to 1924. He was a player‚Äìcoach for the Cardinals from 1923 to 1924. Arnold's brother Ralph Horween, alongside whom he played football at Harvard and in the NFL In 1922‚Äì23, Horween appeared in all 11 games and scored 4 rushing touchdowns as the Cardinals were 8‚Äì3‚Äì0. In 1923‚Äì24, the team was 8‚Äì4‚Äì0. On October 7, 1923, he and his brother both scored in the same game, as he kicked two extra points and his brother ran for a touchdown as the Cardinals beat the Rochester Jeffersons 60‚Äì0 at Normal Park in Chicago. On November 12, 1922, he made a long pass to Paddy Driscoll for the game's only touchdown, in a 7‚Äì0 victory over the Akron Pros. On December 2, 1923, he kicked a field goal and his brother ran for a touchdown as the Cardinals beat the Oorang Indians, 22‚Äì19. His brother Ralph Horween also played for the Chicago Cardinals. Horween and his brother played for the Cardinals under the alias McMahon (he played as A. McMahon) to protect their family's social status. He kept that name until 1923. Coaching career at Harvard Horween returned to Harvard as the school's head football coach from 1925 to 1930, compiling a record of 21‚Äì17‚Äì3. The New York Sun reported: > The boys are for him unreservedly. It is no, secret, however, that Horween's > appointment didn't please the Beacon Street-Park Avenue element among the > grads. The clique that supported the old regime would prefer to see a Cabot > or a Wendell, we use the names as symbols, in the saddle... Charlie Devens, who later played baseball for the New York Yankees, played football under Horween at Harvard. He recalled that anti-Semitic posters aimed at Coach Horween were displayed at a game in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Horween married Marion Eisendrath in November 1928. The couple had a long engagement, as they had agreed to postpone the wedding until the Harvard football team defeated Yale. The requisite victory took place on Saturday, November 24, and the wedding on the following Thursday. He resigned following the 1930 season. Horween Leather Company After retiring from football, Horween returned to Chicago in 1930, and he and his brother inherited the family leather tannery business, Horween Leather Company, which had been founded by their father in Chicago in 1905. He operated the business, a successful company that supplied (and still supplies) the leather for Wilson's NFL official football, from 1949‚Äì84. In 1945, he coached the football team of his former high school, Francis Parker. In 1952, he was vice president of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He also served as a trustee of the Chicago Symphony, and on the Harvard University board of overseers.

Trento DOC has more rigorous requirements than Methodo Claissico or M√©thode Traditionnelle: The wine has to be made using techniques characteristic of the region, including how the vines are planted, cultivated, pruned, and hand-harvested (e.g., see photo of 'Pergola Trentino'). Forcing is not permitted, irrigation is allowed only as an emergency measure, maximum vine yield is 150 q.l. per hectare for all varietals, and maximum grape yield is 70%. The wines must rest for a minimum of 15 months on their lees for non-vintage, 24 months for vintage, and 36 for riserva. Minimum alcohol content must be 11.5%, or 12% for riserva. Thus ensuring Trento DOC on the label means the wine is of the highest quality and made using these very strict standards. Trento DOC wines are distinguished by a delicate, rich bouquet, a dry, smooth, rounded and elegant flavor, and a straw-yellow color. While there are no DOC restrictions on the exact proportions of the blend, the grape varieties used in Trento DOC are limited to Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Pinot Meunier and Pinot blanc. After secondary fermentation, the wines must rest on their lees for a minimum of 15 months for non-vintage wines, 24 months for vintage wines and 36 months for wines labeled as Riserva. The alcohol level for the finished wines must be a minimum of 11.5% for non-vintage and vintage wines and 12% for Riserva wines.

In the early days of Edgerton, Wisconsin, it was common practice for public school teachers to read aloud from the King James Bible to their students. In 1886, Roman Catholic parents protested this practice to the school board, citing their belief that the Douay version of the Bible was the only correct translation for their children. After failing to convince the school board to end the practice, the parents took their case to court. In November 1888 the circuit court decided that the readings were not sectarian because both translations were of the same work. The parents took their case to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. In State ex rel Weiss v. District Board 76 Wis. 177 (1890), 3, otherwise known as the Edgerton Bible Case, the judges overruled the circuit court's decision, concluding that it illegally united the functions of church and state. In 1963, the United States Supreme Court banned government-sponsored compulsory prayer from public schools (see Abington School District v. Schempp), and Justice William Brennan, Jr. cited the Edgerton Bible Case in his decision.

In the accident one person was killed and several were seriously injured.  Flight  The plane, an Antonov An-24W, registered SP-LTD, named \\"Dunajec\\", took off from Okƒôcie airport, Warsaw for regional flight 703 to Rzesz√≥w-Jasionka Airport. It had 25 passengers on board (including the famous radio presenter Tomasz Beksi≈Ñski) and four crew members. The captain was Kazimierz Ro≈ºek (with 30 years of experience) and the co-pilot was Waldemar Wolski. The emergency started about two minutes before the planned landing, at 10:25, when the plane was flying east to runway 27. According to officials, pilots turned on the anti-icing installation too late and, during approach, both engines immediately shut down because of icing of the engine intakes. Just after that, Ro≈ºek and Wolski, knowing that they would not reach the airport, started an emergency descent, which ended in a glade.  Crash-landing and evacuation  The aircraft landed on a glade at high speed . It became airborne above a drainage ditch and crashed further on. In the moment of crash-landing, one person ‚Äì a 69-year-old woman from Rzesz√≥w ‚Äì was killed. Within several seconds after the crash, two stewardesses and two militia officers evacuated all passengers from the aircraft, which quickly caught on fire.  Aftermath  The crash-landing has been the last fatal air crash in Polish commercial aviation so far.

Some jurisdictions have declared that, legally, election silence is in violation of law regarding freedom of speech.

YMCA Camp Minikani is a residential summer camp located along the shores of Lake Amy Belle in Hubertus, in Washington County, Wisconsin, United States. YMCA Camp Minikani was established in 1919 by the Milwaukee YMCA. Minikani is also home to Amy Belle Lake. At its conception, Minikani served as a summer camp for boys living in the Milwaukee area who came for two weeks to learn camp skills and participated in competitive athletic events. Minikani has since transformed to a co-ed camp that has shifted from competitive activities to challenge by choice to eliminate the emotional pressure of competitions. Minikani still offers its traditional summer programs such as the Pioneer Unit, the Trail Blazer Unit, and the Explorer Unit, and has since begun to offer day camp and equestrian camps.  Meaning of Minikani  The word Minikani stems from Native American roots and is believed to have a double meaning. In Menomonee, the word Menukunee means \\"a place of beginnings\\", and in Chippewa a different word, Minikani, means \\"a place where seeds are planted\\". This double meaning is appropriate to the mission of YMCA summer camps to provide a place for children to participate in new activities and become comfortable in social settings with other campers.  History  Minikani was established in 1919 as a residential summer camp for boys from the age of eight to sixteen to participate in outdoor camping skills and athletic competition. The boys would be trained in Milwaukee to stay for two weeks where they stayed in teepees In the 1960's camp shifted from competitive activities to more challenge by choice activities that didn't bring about pressures from competition. In 1967, Minikani offered its first girls' overnight camp program. In the 1980's Minikani started a leadership training program which has since become its staple program in developing young campers into responsible counselors. In 2006, Minikani added an equestrian center and added a day camp option to its list of summer programs.

The Pioneer Unit is made up of nine cabins. Cabins 10-17 are all separate from the continuous Pioneer Unit, with cabins 18 and 19 located on the waterfront, farther away from the rest of the unit. Most cabins in the Pioneer Unit are named after cattle brands used during Western Expansion.  Explorer Unit  The Explorer Unit allows campers to attend camp for one week to learn outdoor camping and adventure skills followed by the second week on a camping trip in Rhinelander in northern Wisconsin. The Explorer develops whitewater canoeing skills, backpacking skills, the knowledge to maintain a clean and efficient base camp, and the ability to build strong relationships. Campers in the explorer program are ages 13,14 and 15 are paired with a brother and sister cabin for the week up north. This is also the feeder program into the Leadership Training program, which develops the leadership skills to become a full-time counselor at camp.  Equestrian and day camp programs  Added in 2006 due to a neighbor camp closing, Minikani inherited the equestrian and day camp programs. An equestrian center was constructed on a newly purchased plot of land that allows for resident or day equestrian programs. These campers train with a knowledgeable instructional staff and learn horse care and riding techniques. The day camp program allows campers to participate in the same individual activities and the residential campers with afternoon group activities with the rest of the unit.

He was born in Morristown, New Jersey, the second of the three sons of Henry Kirke Macomber, a medical doctor who moved his family to Pasadena, California, in 1883. African adventurer As a young man, in 1894 Kingsley Macomber explored parts of Central Africa at the invitation of American adventurer Frederick Russell Burnham. With Burnham and seven other Americans, he spent six months surveying and mapping in an area that today is known as Zimbabwe. When hostilities broke out between the native Matabeles and the white intruders, Macomber escaped a massacre but then was caught in the Siege of Bulawayo. A small group of British and a few Americans held off attacks for two months at a hastily erected laager at Bulawayo until being rescued by the British military. Macomber soon left Africa and traveled to London, England where he was honored with a Fellowship in the Royal Geographical Society. In December 1896, he returned to the United States. Kingsley Macomber's time in Africa led to a lifelong friendship with Frederick Burnham and years later in 1939, Burnham, Macomber and John Eagle gifted a natural history collection to the state of Arizona. Although largely African, the significant collection included artifacts gathered worldwide. In 1899, in New York City, Kingsley Macomber married heiress Myrtle Harkness, the daughter of the wealthy Lamon V. Harkness, one of the largest stockholders in Standard Oil. The couple maintained residences on both coasts. Business career At the end of the nineteenth century, Macomber and a partner established a business that operated a coal mine in Gallup, New Mexico and undertook prospecting and mining ventures in the Cascade and Pacific Coast ranges. In 1902, Macomber became a founding owner and first president of the Los Angeles Trust Company, which, in 1905, became a part of a multi-bank amalgamation. California Banks Amalgamated New York Times, August 4, 1905 In 1905, Kingsley Macomber, Henry E. Huntington, and William R. Staats developed the Oak Knoll subdivision in terrain between Pasadena and San Marino, California. In 1906, Macomber purchased Rancho Cienega de los Paicines, a cattle breeding operation located in Paicines, California. He invested a great deal of money in a new home as well as stables to facilitate the introduction of thoroughbred horses to the operation. He kept a private railcar at nearby Tres Pinos, which allowed him and his wife to travel to horse-racing venues throughout the country. After World War I, the Macombers made a chateau in France, at Carri√®res-sous-Poissy, their primary residence, and, in 1927, sold the Paicines ranch to Walter Murphy.History of the Paicines Ranch Thoroughbred racing From 1892 until her marriage to Kingsley Macomber, Myrtle Harkness had spent much time around horses at her father's Walnut Hall Farm near Lexington, Kentucky. With both having considerable interest and history with horses, Kingsley and Myrtle Macomber became major international figures in the sport of Thoroughbred horse racing. In 1918, Kingsley Macomber's colt War Cloud ran fourth in the Kentucky Derby then won the Preakness Stakes. Of his six Kentucky Derby runners, Star Hawk had the best result when he ran second in 1916. Other Macomber horses won a number of important American races including the Travers Stakes, Suburban Handicap, and Withers Stakes. In 1911, virtually all horse racing in the United States shut down as a result of government legislation that banned parimutuel betting. As a consequence, Macomber and several notable American stable owners shifted their racing operations to England and France. While the ban on wagering was lifted within two years, and racing returned to U.S. tracks, many owners retained large operations in Europe, and, by 1925, Macomber had more than one hundred horses in training in England. Nonetheless, he supported California racing, and, in 1923, he became a founding member and Director of the Pacific Coast Jockey Club, headed by Adolph B. Spreckels. The \\"Macomber Family Collection about Race Horse Breeding\\" is at the Department of Special Collections in the University of California, Los Angeles library. The collection is made up of photographs, ephemera, an album, and a catalog relative to the horse-breeding and ranching interests of Dr. Henry Macomber, A. Kingsley Macomber, and John Kingsley Macomber. =Life and racing in France= During the second decade of the 20th Century, Kingsley Macomber was a frequent visitor to Europe and, around 1919, he purchased the Haras de Cheffreville horse breeding farm. A few years later he acquired two properties owned by a fellow American, William K. Vanderbilt: the Haras du Quesnay breeding farm in Normandy, and a chateau at Carri√®res-sous-Poissy, which included a stable for Thoroughbreds, a training track, and bloodstock of approximately one hundred and fifty mares and sires, including the great Maintenon. The Carri√®res-sous-Poissy property, located near the Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse, was on the Paris-to-Deauville railway line, making for easy shipping of horses to the Deauville Racecourse. Thoroughbreds owned by Macomber won major races in France and England. Notably, in 1923, his colt Parth won the prestigious Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Racecourse, and Gold Bridge won back-to-back runnings of the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot in 1933 and 1934. Gold Bridge Part of Parisian high society, according to his obituary in Sports Illustrated, Macomber was hailed as the \\"undisputed head of American society in Europe.\\" He served as president of the American Hospital of Paris from 1926 to 1928.The American Hospital of Paris Philanthropy Macomber was a lover of military history; his father had served with the Union Army during the American Civil War. While living in France he promoted the important historic relationship between that country and the United States. In 1931 he commissioned a monument of Admiral Fran√ßois Joseph Paul de Grasse which was erected at the Trocadero Palace in Paris. During the American Revolutionary War De Grasse had commanded the 1781 French fleet which blocked the British retreat from Yorktown and made possible the American victory.Message to Dedication Ceremonies for a Monument of Admiral Comic de Grasse at the Trocadero Palace in Paris, France In 1934, Macomber donated another American Revolutionary War statue to the city of Newport, Rhode Island. The sculpture of French General Rochambeau is a replica of one in Paris. It was from Newport that General Rochambeau departed with his army to join General George Washington and march on to Yorktown.Rochambeau Macomber also patronized the game of tennis. In the 1920s and 1930s, he supported the A. K. Macomber tournament at Monte Carlo.Sport: Who Won May 5, 1930 Time Magazine A. Kingsley Macomber died in on October 6, 1955, in Paris, France.

Charles Grier Sellers, a leading historian of the Market Revolution, portrays it as a highly negative development that marked the triumph of capitalism over democracy. He argues that this was one of the most significant transformations of America within the first half of the nineteenth century-- indeed, the defining event of world history-- the evolution from an agrarian to a capitalist society. Sellers observes: : While dissolving deeply rooted patterns of behavior and belief for competitive effort, it mobilized collective resources through government to fuel growth in countless ways, not least by providing the essential legal, financial, and transport infrastructures. Establishing capitalist hegemony over economy, politics, and culture, the market revolution created ourselves and most of the world we know. Process Traditional commerce was made obsolete by improvements in transportation and communication. This change prompted the reinstatement of the mercantilist ideas that were thought to have died out. Increased industrialization was a major component of the Market Revolution as a result of the Industrial Revolution. Northern cities started to have a more powerful economy, while most southern cities (with the marked exception of free labor metropolises like St. Louis, Baltimore, and New Orleans) resisted the influence of market forces in favor of the region's slave system. It also was in part influenced by the need for national mobility, shown to be a problem during the War of 1812, after which the government increased production of early roads, extensive canals along navigable waterways, and later elaborate railroad networks. Following the War of 1812, the American economy was altered from an economy dependent on imports from Europe to one that evolved greater internal production and commerce. In 1817 James Monroe replaced James Madison as president of the U.S.. The Democratic-Republicans continued policies begun in Jefferson's administration. With a new generation of leaders, the Democratic-Republican Party came to embrace the principles of government activism and the development of large-scale domestic manufacturing. Despite all of the promises that characterized the United States, discrepancies loomed: the survival of slavery, treatment of the Native Americans, the deterioration of some urban areas, and a mania for speculation. The nation was not just growing through the addition of land, but population shifts brought about new states to the Union and when Missouri petitioned for statehood in 1819, the issue of slavery was thrust on the national agenda. Thomas Jefferson wrote that the issue awakened him \\"like a fire bell in the night.\\"https://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/fire-bell-night-quotation That the Missouri question coincided with the nation's worst financial crisis awakened anxieties in many Americans. By the 1820s Americans recognized a rough regional specialization: plantation-style export agriculture in the south, a north built on business and trade, and a frontier west. The regions were interdependent but in time their differences would become more obvious, more important, and increasingly more incompatible. The market revolution also brought about a change in industry and agriculture. Eli Whitney perfected a system of producing muskets with interchangeable parts. Prior to Whitney's invention, most muskets‚Äîand all other goods‚Äîhad been handmade with parts specially designed for each particular musket. The trigger of one musket, for example, could not be used to replace a broken trigger on another musket. With interchangeable parts, however, all triggers fit the same model of the musket, as did all ramrods, all flash pans, all hammers, and all bullets. Manufacturers in many different industries soon took advantage of Whitney's invention to make a variety of goods with interchangeable parts. Many new products revolutionized agriculture in the West. John Deere, for example, invented the horse-pulled steel plow to replace the difficult oxen-driven wooden plows that farmers had used for centuries. The steel plow allowed farmers to till soil faster and more cheaply without having to make repairs as often. In the 1830s, Cyrus McCormick invented a mechanical mower-reaper that quintupled the efficiency of wheat farming. Prior to the mower-reaper, wheat farming had been too difficult, so farmers had instead produced corn, which was less profitable. As in the South after the cotton gin, farmers in the West raked in huge profits as they acquired more lands to plant more and more wheat. More important, farmers for the first time began producing more wheat than the West could consume. Rather than let it go to waste, they began to transport crop surpluses to sell in the manufacturing Northeast.http://www.sparknotes.com/history/american/precivilwar/section6.rhtml The market revolution further exacerbated sectional tensions in the United States. As King Cotton became the primary crop in the South, the need for increase in labor arose; thus, the South increased its use of slaves in producing crops. The American North and Western European countries banned slavery in their countries/regions, and attempted to push the South to abolish slavery as well. The slave trade ended, but slavery did not end. As the textile industry in the North drastically increased, changing women and children's roles and further revolutionizing family structure, the demand for raw products such as cotton increased, meaning an increase in the South's demand for more labor. Ironically, this Northern demand for more cotton for the textile industry increased the Southern demand for slavery, making it harder for the North to end slavery in the South. This increase of labor and industry brought the United States into the world picture for economy and commerce, planting the seed for the United States to increase in wealth and power majority of the time. Historiography Sellers argued: Sellers has explained his motivation for this interpretation: : As both citizen and historian, I took alarm when consensus historians armed the United States for Cold War by purging class from consciousness. Muffling exploitative capital in appealing democratic garb, their mythology of consensual democratic capitalism purged egalitarian meaning from democracy. I winced when Ronald Reagan evoked \\"democracy\\" against the Evil Empire though clearly meaning capitalism. I grieved when public discourse translated democracy into \\"freedom\\" (\\"liberty\\" in the academic mode)-- typically meaning freedom to aggrandize yourself without any concern for people who lack the gumption, social advantages, or luck to do the same.Sellers, \\"Capitalism and Democracy in American Historical Mythology,\\" in Stokes and Conway, eds. The Market Revolution in America: Social, Political, and Religious Expressions, 1800-1880 (1996) pp 312-13 Professor John Lauritz Larson has considered these transformations in his book, The Market Revolution in America: Liberty, Ambition, and the Eclipse of the Common Good. Historian Daniel Walker Howe challenges the Sellers' interpretation.Daniel Walker Howe, \\"Charles Sellers, the Market Revolution, and the Shaping of Identity in Whig-Jacksonian America.\\" in Noll, ed. God and Mammon: Protestants, Money, and the Market: 1790- 1860 (2001) pp: 54-74. First, Howe points out that the market revolution happened much earlier, in the eighteenth century. Second, Howe claims that Sellers errs in emphasis arguing that because \\"most American family farmers welcomed the chance to buy and sell in larger markets,\\" no one was mourning the end of traditionalism and regretting the rise of modernity.Howe, What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815-1848 p 5 The market revolution improved standards of living for most American farmers. For example, a mattress that cost fifty dollars in 1815 (which meant that almost no one owned one) cost five in 1848 (and everyone slept better). Finally, retorts Howe, the revolution that really mattered was the \\"communications revolution\\": the invention of the telegraph, the expansion of the postal system, improvements in printing technology, and the growth of the newspaper, magazine, and book- publishing industries, and the improvements in higher-speed transportation.This review of the Sellers/Howe dialogue, which goes back to at least 1994, is from Jill Lepore, \\"Vast Designs: How America Came of Age,\\" New Yorker, October 29, 2007; see p. 88 for quotations. In his debate with Sellers, Howe asked. \\"What if people really were benefiting in certain ways from the expansion of the market and its culture? What if they espoused middle-class tastes or evangelical religion or (even) Whig politics for rational and defensible reasons? What if the market was not an actor (as Sellers makes it) but a resource, an instrumentality, something created by human beings as a means to their ends?\\"Howe, \\"\\"Charles Sellers, the Market Revolution, and the Shaping of Identity in Whig-Jacksonian America,\\" p 179 However, Sellers summed up the differences between his and Howe's arguments this way. Howe was proposing that the \\"Market delivers eager self-improvers from stifling Jacksonian barbarism\\" whereas he saw that a \\"Go-getter minority compels everybody else to play its competitive game of speedup and stretch-out or be run over.\\"Sellers, \\"Capitalism and Democracy in American Historical Mythology,\\" in Melvyn Stokes and Stephen Conway, eds. The Market Revolution in America: Social, Political, and Religious Expressions, 1800-1880 (1996) p 314 Howe has praised Larson's approach for rejecting Sellers' \\"villain\\": : Larson here redeems the term \\"market revolution\\" from the treatment accorded it by Charles Sellers...Sellers reified the market revolution, making it an actor in his story‚Äîindeed, its villain. Sellers's wicked \\"Market\\" ruined the lives of happy subsistence farmers, forcing their sons and daughters to become a proletariat in the service of a repressive bourgeoisie. By contrast, Larson shows how the market revolution was made by the people themselves, bit by unwitting bit. His own stance toward this process is richly ironic and nuanced; he never fails to point out ambiguities and paradoxes.Howe, Review of Larson\\" 2011 References Further reading * Eric Foner, Give Me Liberty!

(ŒëŒ£Œ¶, commonly known as Alphans) is a co-ed service fraternity with 34 active undergraduate chapters, colonies and interest groups. History From anecdotal sources, it appears that four groups used the Greek letters \\"Alpha Sigma Phi\\" as their fraternal name. = Gregorio Araneto University Foundation, Caloocan City, 1952 = Little is known about this group, except that one of its members was Bobby Ledesma, a TV host prominent in the '70s. They emerged when conflicts arose between their members and Alphans who studied at GAUF. The groups remained separate organizations. No record shows that this group was invited to the national convention in 1972. The group that affiliated with ASP Philippines is now known as the Alpha Nu Chapter. = Central Mindanao University, Musuan, Bukidnon, 1959 = This group was organized by Tomas Gavarra, with the assistance of Ramon del Carmen as Faculty Adviser. This group used the name \\"Agricultural Students of the Philippines\\" and its acronym ASP was represented by the Greek letters Alpha Sigma Phi. Some of its members organized chapters in other schools. A chapter was established at Rafael Palma College in Tagbilaran City, now University of Bohol. This group known as Theta Chapter played a role in developing ties with the Silliman group which eventually gave impetus to the formation of a national organization. = University of the East Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center, Sta. Mesa, Manila, 1959 = This group claims to be the oldest fraternity of the University Medical Center. No information described the origins of its name. No record shows that it was invited to the first national convention in 1972. = Silliman University, Dumaguete City, 1965 = The chapter was organized by Manuel Momongan. The group tookthe name Alpha Sigma Phi. No record shows that its organization was with the knowledge and authorization of ASP USA. It appears that the group appropriated the symbols of ASP USA. This practice was spurred when ASP USA and ASP Philippines forged the ‚ÄúHeads of Agreement‚Äù and established ‚ÄúAlpha Sigma Phi International.‚Äù This group served as the convenor of the first national convention in 1972 at Silliman University. = First National Convention, Silliman University, Dumaguete City, 1972 = Some of these groups grew and organized chapters in other colleges. Their respective members met and interacted. In 1972, at Silliman University, the first national convention was held and the first set of national officers were elected. Only chapters originating from SU and CMU were represented in that gathering. Greek-letter names were assigned to existing chapters During the 1978 convention in Davao City, the Greek-letter names of the chapters were updated and approved. In 1980 the national organization was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission using the name ‚ÄúAlpha Sigma Phi ‚Äì Philippines, International Collegiate Service Organization, Inc.‚Äù Beginning in 1972 the national organization met in national conventions, leadership conferences, regional conclaves, chapter and association meetings, spreading the reach and scope of Alpha Sigma Phi Philippines across the world. Relationship with Alpha Sigma Phi of the United States In 1984, Alpha Sigma Phi of the Philippines entered into a \\"Heads of Agreement\\" outlining a relationship between the two countries. This agreement outlined mechanisms by which the groups would share information, assist in solving mutual problems. It established the \\"International Council of Alpha Sigma Phi\\". The purpose of this relationship was to foster a sense of international brotherhood. Beyond the sharing of open publications such as the Tomahawk, chapter operations manuals and the like, little contact between the two organizations developed. However, the recommendation of the US Grand Council of Alpha Sigma Phi Fraternity were that the 2008 Grand Chapter would nullify the 1984 Heads of Agreement between the two, that the national staff of the US chapter inform the Filipino chapter of this nullification and that it be directed to cease use of the group's marks and symbols in accordance with US trademark law. The 2008 Grand Chapter Delegates approved the motion to dissolve the 1984 Heads of Agreement between the two. In 2010, the \\"International Council of Alpha Sigma Phi\\" was revived by both fraternities and linkages between the two were established. Through frequent exchange visits by both parties, they agreed to reaffiliate. On November 14, 2013, the US ASP Grand Council restated their withdrawal from the Heads of Agreement signed in 1984, severing formal ties between the two organizations. US ASP retained all rights to intellectual property, marks, and symbols associated with the fraternity. Pledge Education Program (No-Hazing Policy) In 1982, the fraternity implemented a form of acceptance of new prospective members which is known as the Pledge Education Program (PEP).

Biography Born on 19 May 1732 at W√ºrzburg as a son of the engraver Johann Salver (‚Ä† 1738) from his third wife. He attended high school until 1749, then the University of W√ºrzburg where he first studied the law, then history and heraldry. He showed talent for painting and practiced diligently in drawing. Because he lacked the means to further his art education and failed to secure support from wealthy benefactors, Salver returned to his legal studies although he also dealt in passing with the production of maps. Later he did historical research in Gotha, Weimar, Mainz, Speyer, etc. In 1762 Salver was appointed Episcopal Lehnamtsregistrator. In addition, beginning in 1768, he worked as a diplomat for the Bishopric of W√ºrzburg. In 1770 he was a Protocollist of the princely court chamber and head of the Jewish Office. In his spare time he made a description of the Erthal collection of coins and medallions. Due to the death of the princely archivist J. J. D√ºmler in 1773, he received D√ºmler‚Äôs office. After becoming archivist to the Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim, Salver completed the major work of his life, Proben des hohen Te√ºtschen Reichs Adels oder Sammlungen alter Denkm√§ler, Grabsteine, Wappen, Inn- und Urschriften, u.d.

It was released in 1775 with more than 300 folio engravings. Salver died on 23 April 1788. His posthumous collections of manuscripts were scattered after his death, a portion of them came into the hands of the learned Kuustforschers Jos.

Information technology infrastructure is defined broadly as a set of information technology (IT) components that are the foundation of an IT service; typically physical components (computer and networking hardware and facilities), but also various software and network components. According to the Information Technology Infrastructure Library's (ITIL) Foundation Course Glossary, IT Infrastructure can also be termed as ‚ÄúAll of the hardware, software, networks, facilities, etc., that are required to develop, test, deliver, monitor, control or support IT services. The term IT infrastructure includes all of the Information Technology but not the associated People, Processes and documentation.‚Äù Enterprise IT infrastructure typically refers to components required for the existence, operation and management of an enterprise IT environment. It can be internal to an organization and deployed within owned facilities, or deployed within a cloud computing system, or a combination thereof. An IT infrastructure consists of a set of physical devices and software applications that are required to operate the entire enterprise. Overview In IT Infrastructure, the above technological components contribute to and drive business functions. Leaders and managers within the IT field are responsible for ensuring that both the physical hardware and software networks and resources are working optimally. IT infrastructure can be looked at as the foundation of an organization's technology systems, thereby playing an integral part in driving its success. All organizations who rely on technology to do their business can benefit from having a robust, interconnected IT Infrastructure. With the current speed that technology changes and the competitive nature of businesses, IT leaders have to ensure that their IT Infrastructure is designed such that changes can be made quickly and without impacting the business continuity. While traditionally companies used to typically rely on physical data centers or colocation facilities to support their IT Infrastructure, cloud hosting has become more popular as it is easier to manage and scale. IT Infrastructure can be managed by the company themselves or it can be outsourced to another company who has consulting expertise to develop robust infrastructures for an organization. With advances in online outreach availability, it has become easier for end users to access technology. As a result, IT infrastructures have become more complex and therefore, it is harder for managers to oversee the end to end operations. In order to mitigate this issue, strong IT Infrastructures require employees with varying skill sets. The fields of IT management and IT service management rely on IT infrastructure, and the ITIL framework was developed as a set of best practices with regard to IT infrastructure. The ITIL framework assists companies with the ability to be responsive to technological market demands. Technology can often be thought of as an innovative product which can incur high production costs. However, the ITIL framework helps address these issues and allows the company to be more cost effective which helps IT managers to keep the IT Infrastructure functioning. Background Even though the IT infrastructure has been around for over 60 years, there have been incredible advances in technology in the past 15 years. These advances have meant that IT infrastructure has become an integral component of companies both large and small. Workers used to use desktop computers at the office and technology speed was not great. Nowadays each user connects to the network using multiple devices such as laptops, phones and tablets. Therefore, the IT infrastructure has to be available 24/7 with fast speed and have enough capacity to support a higher number of devices. Components of IT Infrastructure The primary components of an IT Infrastructure are the physical systems such as hardware, storage, any kind of routers/switches and the building itself but also networks and software . In addition to these components, there is the need for ‚ÄúIT Infrastructure Security‚Äù. Security keeps the network and its devices safe in order to maintain the integrity within the overall infrastructure of the organization. The IT Infrastructure is integral to the layers of the OSI Model. Without an IT Infrastructure, IT operations would not be possible. Everything from physical devices of the end user to the network in which they work on as well as the data they consume are not possible without the proper infrastructure in place in all the layers of the OSI model. Specifically, the first three layers are directly involved with IT Infrastructure. The physical layer serves as the fundamental layer for hardware. The second and third layers (Data Link and Network), are essential for communication to and from hardware devices. Without this, networking is not possible. Therefore, in a sense the internet itself would not be possible. IT Infrastructure Types Different types of technological tasks may require a tailored approach to the infrastructure. These can be achieved through a traditional, cloud or hyper converged IT Infrastructure. Skills There are many functioning parts that go into the health of an IT infrastructure. In order to contribute positively to the organization, employees can acquire abilities to benefit the company. These include key technical abilities such as cloud, network, and data administration skills and soft abilities such collaboration and communication skills. It is vital that employees keep up to date with the latest tools and technologies because of the ability to cloud host which creates the need for certifications. A lot of specialized skill sets often require certifications for career growth and IT Infrastructure integrity. Future As data storage and management becomes more digitized, IT Infrastructure is moving towards the cloud. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) provides the ability to host on a server and is a platform for cloud computing. IaaS, PaaS (Platform-as-a- service), SaaS (Software-as-a-service) are all different models of how companies can choose to go with their IT road map. Companies can carry this function out themselves or they can hire a firm that can do this for them via private cloud. Additionally, they can also go with the public cloud, which would potentially involve either Microsoft's Azure, Amazon's AWS, or Google's Cloud.

History and Preservation Windows on the western fa√ßade, c.1270 The oldest parts of the building have been dated by dendrochronology to 1094. There was a second construction phase in the 12th century, from which part of the western wall, with a sandstone double-arched window, has been preserved. Around 1270, a larger synagogue incorporating parts of the earlier building was constructed. The western fa√ßade, with five lancet windows and a large rosette window, dates from this time. In the early 1300s, it was extended and another storey was added. After the Erfurt Massacre of 1349, in which the Jewish population was murdered and expelled from the city, the synagogue was damaged. The city of Erfurt took ownership of the building and later sold it to a local merchant. It was converted into a warehouse and a vaulted cellar was built underneath. The alterations considerably changed the interior of the building. For the next 500 years it was used for storing goods. From the 19th century, the building had various uses and had at different periods a ballroom, a restaurant and even two bowling alleys. These changes, and changes to the surrounding buildings, meant that the Old Synagogue, which is on a back lot down a narrow alleyway, was largely forgotten about. Its history wasn't recognised, which helped to protected it during the Nazi period. It was not until the late 1980s that interest was awakened in the old building. The architectural historian Elmar Altwasser began to research it in 1992. Erfurt City Council bought the property in 1998 and extensively researched and conserved it. \\"During the conservation, great emphasis was put on the preservation of all traces of use: those dating from synagogal use as well as those from later alterations.

The vertices and edges of the subdivision form an embedding of Tietze's graph onto the strip. In the mathematical field of graph theory, Tietze's graph is an undirected cubic graph with 12 vertices and 18 edges. It is named after Heinrich Franz Friedrich Tietze, who showed in 1910 that the M√∂bius strip can be subdivided into six regions that all touch each other ‚Äì three along the boundary of the strip and three along its center line ‚Äì and therefore that graphs that are embedded onto the M√∂bius strip may require six colors.. The boundary segments of the regions of Tietze's subdivision (including the segments along the boundary of the M√∂bius strip itself) form an embedding of Tietze's graph. Relation to Petersen graph Tietze's graph may be formed from the Petersen graph by replacing one of its vertices with a triangle. Like the Tietze graph, the Petersen graph forms the boundary of six mutually touching regions, but on the projective plane rather than on the M√∂bius strip. If one cuts a hole from this subdivision of the projective plane, surrounding a single vertex, the surrounded vertex is replaced by a triangle of region boundaries around the hole, giving the previously described construction of the Tietze graph. Hamiltonicity Both Tietze's graph and the Petersen graph are maximally nonhamiltonian: they have no Hamiltonian cycle, but any two non- adjacent vertices can be connected by a Hamiltonian path. Tietze's graph and the Petersen graph are the only 2-vertex-connected cubic non-Hamiltonian graphs with 12 or fewer vertices. Unlike the Petersen graph, Tietze's graph is not hypohamiltonian: removing one of its three triangle vertices forms a smaller graph that remains non-Hamiltonian. Edge coloring and perfect matchings Edge coloring Tietze's graph requires four colors; that is, its chromatic index is 4. Equivalently, the edges of Tietze's graph can be partitioned into four matchings, but no fewer. Tietze's graph matches part of the definition of a snark: it is a cubic bridgeless graph that is not 3-edge- colorable. However, some authors restrict snarks to graphs without 3-cycles and 4-cycles, and under this more restrictive definition Tietze's graph is not a snark. Tietze's graph is isomorphic to the graph J3, part of an infinite family of flower snarks introduced by R. Isaacs in 1975.. Unlike the Petersen graph, the Tietze graph can be covered by four perfect matchings. This property plays a key role in a proof that testing whether a graph can be covered by four perfect matchings is NP-complete.. Additional properties Tietze's graph has chromatic number 3, chromatic index 4, girth 3 and diameter 3. The independence number is 5. Its automorphism group has order 12, and is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6, the group of symmetries of a hexagon, including both rotations and reflections. This group has two orbits of size 3 and one of size 6 on vertices, and thus this graph is not vertex-transitive. Gallery File:Tietze's graph 3COL.svgThe chromatic number of the Tietze graph is 3.

(2001) Gone But Not Forgotten: Civil War Veterans of Northeastern Pennsylvania. Wilkes-Barre, PA: Luzerne County Historical Society. He is best known for his battery's defense against a Confederate attack on Cemetery Hill on the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg. Early life Elijah Ricketts was a merchant and farmer in Orangeville in Columbia County, Pennsylvania. He married Margaret Leigh Lockart (1810‚Äì1891) in 1830. Robert Bruce Ricketts was the fifth of nine children of this union, born on April 29, 1839. An older brother, William Wallace Ricketts (b. 1837), attended the United States Military Academy; but he died in 1862. Bruce Ricketts was educated at the Wyoming Seminary near Wilkes-Barre. When the war broke out, he was studying law and considering the possibility of a university education. Early Civil War The First Pennsylvania Light Artillery (otherwise known as the 43rd Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers) was organized in 1861. The regiment left for Washington, D.C. in August of that year. Battery F was formed under Capt. Ezra W. Matthews. Bruce Ricketts joined the service on July 8, as a private of that year, and he was commissioned as first lieutenant in that battery about a month later. The regiment was split up, with individual batteries serving with different divisions of the Army of the Potomac. Battery F first saw combat at the Battle of Dranesville on December 20, 1861. Ricketts' section had one gun disabled in that action. Later the section served in the defense of Hancock, Maryland, against a foray by Stonewall Jackson. Battery F served in the Army of Virginia in the corps of Major General Irwin McDowell, joining it on March 21, 1862, at Warrenton, Virginia. In that context it was involved, under Ricketts' leadership, in a reconnaissance expedition to Rappahannock Station, Virginia, that left on April 7, of that year. This force advanced and then withdrew, having accomplished its information-gathering purpose. Thereafter the battery was involved in the campaign culminating in the Second Battle of Bull Run. Battery F was seriously engaged in the Battle of Cedar Mountain on August 8, helping McDowell cover the retreat of the corps of Major General Nathaniel Banks. The battery helped defend Henry House Hill at Second Bull Run, and it was present at the Battle of Chantilly though not engaged. It also participated in the \\"artillery hell\\" of the Battle of Antietam. Lt. Ricketts missed most of these actions while serving on recruiting duty. He returned to the Army of the Potomac on September 23, 1862. Ricketts commanded Battery F, First Pennsylvania Light Artillery from then on until the summer of 1864. Capt. Matthews went down ill and did not return to battery command. Ricketts was engaged with his guns at the Battle of Fredericksburg, serving with second division I Corps under Major General John F. Reynolds. When Capt. Matthews was promoted to the rank of major, Ricketts became a captain on March 14, 1863. At the Battle of Chancellorsville Ricketts' battery was with Major General Abner Doubleday's third division I Corps. Gettysburg Ricketts' battery was ‚Äì beginning on May 13, 1863 ‚Äì in the third volunteer brigade of the Reserve Artillery under Capt. James F. Huntington. Battery G, First Pennsylvania Light Artillery, was attached to Ricketts' battery a few weeks before the Battle of Gettysburg, on June 1, 1863. This merger was resented until gunners from Battery G were permitted to form a section of the consolidated battery. This merger took place while the army was marching north in pursuit of the Army of Northern Virginia, beginning on May 15. Ricketts' battery arrived in Gettysburg on the Taneytown Road on the morning of July 2, 1863, and replaced Capt. James H. Cooper's Battery B, First Pennsylvania Light Artillery, on East Cemetery Hill about 4:00 PM. It was exposed to enfilade fire from Benner's Hill and Seminary Ridge. Around nightfall, two Confederate brigades from the division of Major General Jubal Early attacked the hill. It broke the thin Union front line at the foot of the hill in two places. In other places they were repelled. Some Confederates reached the top of the hill, and one group attacked the left of Ricketts' battery, trying to spike the guns. The fight for the guns became hand to hand, but the Confederates were unable to capture the whole battery. Eventually Union reinforcements from the II Corps brigade of Col. Samuel S. Carroll drove the Confederates down hill. A monument to the battery stands in the general location of their fight.VirtualGettysburg.com After the battle, Ricketts criticized Adelbert Ames' division of XI Corps, although he probably could not see what was going on down there at the foot of the hill.Pfanz, p. 452, n. 10. He thought they fled unnecessarily. Ricketts' account of the action makes it look as if his battery stood alone for an extended time.Pennsylvania at Gettysburg, vol. 2, pp. 918‚Äì923. However, a less colorful account by a modern historian shows that some of the XI Corps troops had rallied and stood fast atop Cemetery Hill even before reinforcements from Col. Carroll's brigade of II Corps came up behind Ricketts' position.Pfanz, Culp's Hill, pp. 189, 252‚Äì253, 270. After Gettysburg After Gettysburg, Ricketts' battery F was transferred to the artillery brigade of II Corps in time for the Bristoe Campaign. At the Second Battle of Auburn on October 14, 1863, the battery helped first division II Corps cover the withdrawal of the corps under harassing fire from horse artillery of Major General J. E. B. Stuart's command.Walker pp. 330, 333‚Äì334. At the Battle of Bristoe Station later that day, Ricketts' battery F came up at a gallop and unlimbered behind BG Alexander S. Webb's second division II Corps. Their fire helped defeat Major General Henry Heth's attack on the federal line.Walker, pp. 351, 357. The battery was given the privilege of presenting captured Confederate guns to Major General George G. Meade, the commanding general. Ricketts' battery remained with the II Corps for the Overland Campaign. During the Battle of the Wilderness, a section of Ricketts' battery advanced on the Plank Road with Major General Winfield Scott Hancock's attack on the Confederate lines on May 5, 1864, at about 3:30 PM. The section accompanied BG George Getty's division of VI Corps, serving with Hancock at that time. A Confederate counterattack captured the section, but Col. Carroll's brigade recaptured the guns by 6:00 PM.Walker, pp. 413‚Äì415; Priest, pp. 153‚Äì154, 180‚Äì181, 195. BG Getty praised Ricketts for his \\"great coolness and courage\\" in this action.War of the Rebellion, series 1, vol. 36, p. 678. Ricketts was engaged in support of Grant's offensive attacks on the Confederate positions in the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House on May 18, 1864, being moved up close to the captured Confederate works.Rhea, p. 134; Tidball, pp. 326‚Äì327. He also supported Hancock's attack on Henagan's redoubt at the Battle of North Anna on May 23.Rhea, p. 298; Tidball, p. 332. The battery remained with II Corps throughout the remainder of the campaign, except at the Battle of Cold Harbor, when it was detached to serve with XVIII Corps on June 3,.Walker, p. 516; War of the Rebellion, series 1, vol. 36, pt. 1, pp. 531‚Äì532 (Ricketts' report). Ricketts' battery crossed the James River with II Corps and participated in the Second Battle of Petersburg. Battery F fired some of the first federal shots into the beleaguered city. Ricketts' guns were on the battle front for two weeks until they were relieved by a battery from V Corps.War of the Rebellion, series 1, vol. 40, pt. 1, p. 438 (Ricketts' report); Tidball, pp. 341‚Äì342. During the subsequent Siege of Petersburg, Ricketts was promoted to higher ranks in the First Pennsylvania Light Artillery. When Major James H. Cooper reached the expiration of his term of service on August 8, 1864, Ricketts was named his successor. When, in 1865, Colonel R. M. West was commissioned colonel of the Fifth Pennsylvania Cavalry, Major Ricketts was promoted to the rank of colonel in his place to date from March 15.www.pa- roots.com During the early stages of the siege, Ricketts continued in command of his battery with II Corps. This included a role supporting BG Gershom Mott's division in the Second Battle of Deep Bottom.War of the Rebellion, series 1, vol. 42, pt. 1, pp. 405, 420, 422 (Ricketts' report). After returning to the Petersburg front, the battery was assigned to positions near the Jerusalem Plank Road. During this period, Capt. Ricketts presided over a court of inquiry into the loss of a gun at the Second Battle of Ream's Station. He also served on a board deciding which units could add the names of particular battles to their flags.War of the Rebellion, series 1, vol. 42, pt. 2, pp. 838, 941, 968. In December 1864, Ricketts, as \\"acting major,\\" commanded the II Corps batteries serving on the lines of IX Corps for a period of three weeks.War of the Rebellion, series 1, vol. 42, pt. 3, pp. 813, 1078. In 1865, Ricketts played a role in the Artillery Reserve; and, by the spring of 1865 he was assistant chief of artillery of IX Corps. Whenever the chief of artillery, Colonel John C. Tidball, was absent, Ricketts took charge of the guns of IX Corps in his place.War of the Rebellion, series 1, vol. 46, pt. 1, pp. 365, 661, 1075, 1081, 1084, pt. 2, pp. 332, 347. The report that a Confederate veteran looked at Ricketts, a slight man, and commented, \\"And did this little cuss command Battery Hell!,\\" may be apocryphal.Minnigh, p. 127, \\"Brave Bruce Ricketts.\\" Post-war After the war, Ricketts, with his father and an uncle, began buying timber land in Columbia, Luzerne and Sullivan counties. By 1873, they had ca. . In 1872 Ricketts and partners opened a saw mill. He used his own lumber to build North Mountain House at Ganoga Lake in the area where he had his timber lands. The house took guests until 1903, when it became his family's summer home. Ricketts' interests suffered financial hardship in the years 1883 to 1885, and he had to sell off much of his land. Ricketts married Elizabeth Reynolds in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, on October 1, 1868. They had three children: William Reynolds (1869‚Äì1956); Jean Holberton (1873‚Äì1929), and Frances Leigh (1881‚Äì1970). Lakes Jean and Leigh are named for their two daughters. Ricketts belonged to the Grand Army of the Republic and the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. The colonel was politically active too. He supported Major General Winfield Scott Hancock for president in 1880.National Cyclopedia of America Biography, vol. 5, p. 216, \\"Ricketts, Robert Bruce.\\" At his death on November 14, 1918, at Ganoga Lake, Ricketts still owned about around Red Rock Mountain in Columbia, Luzerne and Sullivan counties, including Ganoga Lake (or Long Pond) and Lake Jean. Ricketts was buried nearby. His heirs sold much of this timber land to the state of Pennsylvania via the Central Penn Lumber Company 1920-1924. This land became the nucleus of Ricketts Glen State Park.

Niemann‚ÄìPick type C affects an estimated 1:150,000 people. Approximately 50% of cases present before 10 years of age, but manifestations may first be recognized as late as the sixth decade.  Signs and symptoms  Niemann‚ÄìPick type C has a wide clinical spectrum. Affected individuals may have enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and liver (hepatomegaly), or enlarged spleen or liver combined (hepatosplenomegaly), but this finding may be absent in later onset cases. Prolonged jaundice or elevated bilirubin can present at birth. In some cases, however, enlargement of the spleen or liver does not occur for months or years ‚Äì or not at all. Enlargement of the spleen or liver frequently becomes less apparent with time, in contrast to the progression of other lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann‚ÄìPick disease, Types A and B or Gaucher disease. Organ enlargement does not usually cause major complications. Progressive neurological disease is the hallmark of Niemann‚ÄìPick type C disease, and is responsible for disability and premature death in all cases beyond early childhood. Classically, children with NPC may initially present with delays in reaching normal developmental milestones skills before manifesting cognitive decline (dementia). Neurological signs and symptoms include cerebellar ataxia (unsteady walking with uncoordinated limb movements), dysarthria (slurred speech), dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), tremor, epilepsy (both partial and generalized), vertical supranuclear palsy (upgaze palsy, downgaze palsy, saccadic palsy or paralysis), sleep inversion, gelastic cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone or drop attacks), dystonia (abnormal movements or postures caused by contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles across joints), most commonly begins with inturning of one foot when walking (action dystonia) and may spread to become generalized, spasticity (velocity dependent increase in muscle tone), hypotonia, ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid), microcephaly (abnormally small head), psychosis, progressive dementia, progressive hearing loss, bipolar disorder, major and psychotic depression that can include hallucinations, delusions, mutism, or stupor. In the terminal stages of Niemann‚ÄìPick type C disease, the patient is bedridden, with complete ophthalmoplegia, loss of volitional movement and severe dementia.  Genetics  Approximately 95% of Niemann‚ÄìPick type C cases are caused by genetic mutations in the NPC1 gene, referred to as type C1; 5% are caused by mutations in the NPC2 gene, referred to as type C2. The clinical manifestations of types Niemann‚ÄìPick types C1 and C2 are similar because the respective genes are both involved in egress of lipids, particularly cholesterol, from late endosomes or lysosomes. The NPC1 gene is located on chromosome 18 (18q11-q12) and was described by researchers at the National Institutes of Health in July 1997. * The NPC1 gene encodes a protein that is located in membranes inside the cell and is involved in the movement of cholesterol and lipids within cells. A deficiency of this protein leads to the abnormal buildup of lipids and cholesterol within cell membranes. * The NPC2 gene encodes a protein that binds and transports cholesterol. It has been shown to closely interact with NPC1. = \\"Type D\\" variant = Type D Niemann‚ÄìPick has only been found in the French Canadian population of Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia, and is now known to be allelic with Niemann‚ÄìPick type C. Genealogical research indicates that Joseph Muise (c. 1679‚Äì1729) and Marie Amirault (1684 ‚Äì c. 1735) are common ancestors to all people with Type D. This couple is the most likely origin for the type D variant.  Pathophysiology  Niemann‚ÄìPick type C is biochemically, genetically and clinically distinct from Niemann‚ÄìPick Types A or and B. In Types A and B, there is complete or partial deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme called acid sphingomyelinase. In Niemann‚ÄìPick type C, the protein product of the major mutated gene NPC1 is not an enzyme but appears to function as a transporter in the endosomal-lysosomal system, which moves large water-insoluble molecules through the cell. The protein coded by the NPC2 gene more closely resembles an enzyme structurally but seems to act in cooperation with the NPC1 protein in transporting molecules in the cell. The disruption of this transport system results in the accumulation of cholesterol and glycolipids in lysosomes. Cholesterol and glycolipids have varied roles in the cell. Cholesterol is a major component of cell plasma membranes, which define the cell as a whole and its organelles. It is also the basic building block of steroid hormones, including neurosteroids. In Niemann‚ÄìPick type C, large amounts of free or unesterified cholesterol accumulate in lysosomes, and leads to relative deficiency of this molecule in multiple membranes and for steroid synthesis. The accumulation of glycosphingolipids in the nervous system has been linked to structural changes, namely ectopic dendritogenesis and meganeurite formation, and has been targeted therapeutically. Several theories have attempted to link the accumulation of cholesterol and glycolipids in the lysosomes with the malfunction of the NPC-1 protein. * Neufeld et al. hypothesized that the accumulation of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) in the late endosome signals failure of retrograde trafficking of cholesterol via the trans Golgi network. * Another theory suggests that the blockage of retrograde cholesterol breakdown in the late endosome is due to decreased membrane elasticity and thus the return vesicles of cholesterol to the trans Golgi Network cannot bud and form. * Iouannou, et al. have described similarities between the NPC1 protein and members of the resistance- nodulation-division (RND) family of prokaryotic permeases, suggesting a pumping function for NPC1. * Recent 2008 evidence indicates that NPC-1 may play an important role in calcium regulation.  Diagnosis  Niemann‚ÄìPick type C is diagnosed by assaying cultured fibroblasts for cholesterol esterfication and staining for unesterified cholesterol with filipin. The fibroblasts are grown from a small skin biopsy taken from a patient with suspected NPC. The diagnosis can be confirmed by identifying mutations in the NPC1 or NPC2 genes in 80‚Äì90% of cases. This specialized testing is available at Thomas Jefferson University Lysosomal Disease Testing Lab and the Mayo Clinic.  Treatment  There is no known cure for Niemann‚ÄìPick type C, nor is there any FDA-standard approved disease modifying treatment. Supportive care is essential and substantially improves the quality of life of people affected by NPC. The therapeutic team may include specialists in neurology, pulmonology, gastroenterology, psychiatrist, orthopedics, nutrition, physical therapy and occupational therapy. Standard medications used to treat symptoms can be used in NPC patients. As patients develop difficulty with swallowing, food may need to be softened or thickened, and eventually, parents will need to consider placement of a gastrostomy tube (g-tube, feeding tube). = Arimoclomol = In 2014, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted orphan drug designation to arimoclomol for the treatment of Niemann‚ÄìPick type C. This was followed in 2015 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Dosing in a placebo-controlled phase II/III clinical trial to investigate treatment for Niemann‚ÄìPick type C (for patients with both type C1 and C2) using arimoclomol began in 2016. Arimoclomol, which is orally administered, induces the heat shock response in cells and is well tolerated in humans. = Hydroxypropyl- beta-cyclodextrin (HPbCD) = In April 2009, hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbCD) was approved under compassionate use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat Addison and Cassidy Hempel, identical twin girls suffering from Niemann‚ÄìPick type C disease. Medi-ports, similar to ports used to administer chemotherapy drugs, were surgically placed into the twins' chest walls and allow doctors to directly infuse HPbCD into their bloodstreams. Treatment with cyclodextrin has been shown to delay clinical disease onset, reduced intraneuronal storage and secondary markers of neurodegeneration, and significantly increased lifespan in both the Niemann‚ÄìPick type C mice and feline models. This is the second time in the United States that cyclodextrin alone has been administered in an attempt treat a fatal pediatric disease. In 1987, HPbCD was used in a medical case involving a boy suffering from severe hypervitaminosis A. On May 17, 2010, the FDA granted Hydroxypropyl-beta- cyclodextrin orphan drug status and designated HPbCD cyclodextrin as a potential treatment for Niemann‚ÄìPick type C disease. On July 14, 2010, Dr. Caroline Hastings of UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland filed additional applications with the FDA requesting approval to deliver HPbCD directly into the central nervous systems of the twins in an attempt to help HPbCD cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. The request was approved by the FDA on September 23, 2010, and bi-monthly intrathecal injections of HPbCD into the spine were administered starting in October 2010. On December 25, 2010, the FDA granted approval for HPbCD to be delivered via IV to an additional patient, Peyton Hadley, aged 13, under an IND through Rogue Regional Medical Center in Medford, Oregon. Soon after in March 2011, approval was sought for similar treatment of his sibling, Kayla, age 11, and infusions of HPbCD began shortly after. Both have since begun intrathecal treatments beginning in January 2012. In April 2011, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in collaboration with the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases Program (TRND), announced they were developing a clinical trial utilizing cyclodextrin for Niemann‚ÄìPick type C patients. On September 20, 2011, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted HPbCD orphan drug status and designated the compound as a potential treatment for Niemann‚ÄìPick type C disease. On December 31, 2011, the FDA granted approval for IV HPbCD infusions for a fifth child in the United States, Chase DiGiovanni, under a compassionate use protocol. The child was 29 months old at the time of his first intravenous infusion, which was started in January 2012. Due to unprecedented collaboration between individual physicians and parents of children afflicted with NPC, approximately 15 patients worldwide have received HPbCD cyclodextrin therapy under compassionate use treatment protocols. Treatment involves a combination of intravenous therapy (IV), intrathecal therapy (IT) and intracerebroventricular (ICV) cyclodextrin therapy. On January 23, 2013, a formal clinical trial to evaluate HPŒ≤CD cyclodextrin therapy as a treatment for Niemann‚ÄìPick disease, type C was announced by scientists from the NIH's National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). = Other treatments under investigation = One drug that has been tried is Miglustat. Miglustat is a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, which inhibits the synthesis of glycosphingolipids in cells. It has been shown to delay the onset of disease in the NPC mouse, and published data from a multi-center clinical trial of Miglustat in the United States and England and from case reports suggests that it may ameliorate the course of human NPC. Several other treatment strategies are under investigation in cell culture and animal models of NPC. These include, cholesterol mobilization, neurosteroid (a special type of hormone that affects brain and other nerve cells) replacement using allopregnanolone, rab overexpression to bypass the trafficking block (Pagano lab) and Curcumin as an anti-inflammatory and calcium modulatory agent. The pregnane X receptor has been identified as a potential target. Neural stem cells have also been investigated in an animal model, and clear evidence of life extension in the mouse model has been shown. Low cholesterol diets are often used, but there is no evidence of efficacy.  Prognosis  The lifespan of patients with NPC is usually related to the age of onset. Children with antenatal or infantile onset usually succumb in the first few months or years of life, whereas adolescent and adult onset forms of Niemann‚ÄìPick type C have a more insidious onset and slower progression, and affected individuals may survive to the seventh decade. Adult cases of NPC are being recognized with increasing frequency. It is suspected that many patients affected by NPC are undiagnosed, owing to lack of awareness of the disease and the absence of readily available screening or diagnostic tests. For the same reasons the diagnosis is often delayed by many years.  Research directions  Loss of myelin in the central nervous system is considered to be a main pathogenic factor. Research uses animal models carrying the underlying mutation for Niemann‚ÄìPick disease, e.g. a mutation in the NPC1 gene Niemann‚ÄìPick type C disease. In this model the expression of Myelin gene Regulatory Factor (MRF) has been shown to be significantly decreased. MRF is a transcription factor of critical importance in the development and maintenance of myelin sheaths. A perturbation of oligodendrocyte maturation and the myelination process might therefore be an underlying mechanism of the neurological deficits. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown patients with Niemann‚ÄìPick, type C to have a corpus callosum with microstructural abnormalities. Clear reductions in corpus callosum mean thickness and surface area have been shown when compared to age-matched controls. Also, studies using diffusion tensor imaging have shown marked reductions in callosal fractional anisotropy, which suggests architectural abnormalities based on the directional flow of water. These conclusions suggest that the corpus callosum plays an important role in the disease and should be explored for use as a biomarker of disease progression. Parents of children with NPC are being studied in an attempt to gain insight into the Ebola virus, which uses the protein encoded by NPC1 to enter cells. Researchers have found that mice with one normal copy of the NPC1 gene are more likely to survive Ebola infection than mice with normal two copies of the gene. Mice lacking any normal copy of NPC1 all survived. Studying cells from parents who are NPC disease carriers may allow for better understanding of how changes to the NPC1 gene affect Ebola risk. Findings from Zhang et al Zhang M, Dwyer NK, Love DC, Cooney A, Comly M, Neufeld E, Pentchev PG, Blanchette- Mackie EJ, Hanover JA. Cessation of rapid late endosomal tubulovesicular trafficking in Niemann‚ÄìPick type C1 disease. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. April 2001, 98 (8) 4466-4471; DOI: 10.1073/pnas.081070898 suggest that NPC is a late endocytic trafficking disease resulted, at least in part, from disruption of communication within late endocytic (LE) compartments and possibly between LE and other subcellular organelles. Crosstalk between the late endocytic compartment and other orgranelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, as well as early endocytic compartments has become one of the most interesting frontiers in neurondegenerative disease research including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, as well as lysosomal storage disorders.

Descriptions of type E and type F have been published, but they are not well characterized, and are currently classified under type B. Genetics Mutations in the SMPD1 gene cause Niemann‚ÄìPick Types A and B. This gene carries instructions for cells to produce a lysosomal enzyme called acid sphingomyelinase. Insufficient activity of the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase causes the buildup of toxic amounts of sphingomyelin, a fatty substance present in every cell of the body. This enzyme is found in special compartments within cells called lysosomes (compartments that digest and recycle materials in the cell), and is required to metabolize the lipid sphingomyelin. If sphingomyelinase is absent or not functioning properly, sphingomyelin cannot be metabolized properly and is accumulated within the cell, eventually causing cell death and the malfunction of major organ systems. Diagnosis =Type A= Niemann‚ÄìPick Type A, the most common type, occurs in infants and is characterized by jaundice, an enlarged liver, failure to thrive, progressive deterioration of the nervous system and profound brain damage. Children affected by Niemann Pick Type A rarely live beyond 18 months. Niemann‚ÄìPick Type A occurs more frequently among individuals of Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish descent than in other ethnicities. The incidence within the Ashkenazi population is approximately 1 in 40,000 people. The incidence for other populations is 1 in 250,000 people. =Type B= Niemann‚ÄìPick Type B involves an enlarged liver and spleen hepatosplenomegaly, growth retardation, and problems with lung function including frequent lung infections. Other signs include blood abnormalities such as abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels, and low numbers of blood cells involved in clotting (platelets). The brain is not affected in Type B and the disease often presents in the pre-teen years.

He took part in the 1916 Easter Rising and later became the Irish Free State's first minister to the United States. Life Brennan was born at John's Gate Street, Wexford, the son of Robert Brennan, a victualler, and Bridget Kearney. He was a member of the staff of the Enniscorthy Echo. He joined the Gaelic League and the Irish Volunteers and was recruited into the IRB by Se√°n T. O'Kelly. He married √öna Brennan who was also active in the republican movement and had her sworn into the IRB. She was with him in Wexford for the 1916 Easter Rising. He commanded the insurgents in Wexford during the 1916 Easter Rising and, along with other leaders Seamus Rafter and Se√°n Etchingham, was sentenced to death. The sentence was commuted to penal servitude. His continuing political activity resulted in further imprisonments in 1917 and afterwards. His daughter Maeve Brennan was born while he was in prison. In April 1918 he was placed in charge of a newly formed Sinn F√©in Department of Propaganda/Publicity. However, in November 1918 he was arrested in the run-up to the General Election (held in December), in an effort by the British Government to stifle the Sinn F√©in election campaign. The election manifesto on which he had worked was \\"mutilated by the censor\\" - only about one half of it could be published. He became Sinn F√©√≠n National Director of Elections in December 1918. The election turned out to be a resounding success for the party. He was Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs, D√°il √âireann, from February 1921 to January 1922. He organised the Irish Race Convention in Paris in 1922. He was director of publicity for the anti-Treaty Irish Republican Army during the Irish Civil War. He was a founder and a director, in 1934, of The Irish Press newspaper. His imprisonments and activities greatly fragmented his daughter Maeve's childhood. In her story The Day We Got Our Own Back she recounts her memory of how, when she was five, her home was raided by Free State forces looking for her father, who was on the run.

It was opened in succession by two companies, the first in 1861 to connect the important woollen town of Witney to the main line network, and the second in 1873 as the rump of an ambitious scheme to connect to Cheltenham, but which ran only between Witney and Fairford. The junction with the main line was at Yarnton, north of Oxford. The Great Western Railway worked the two companies' lines as a single branch line from 1873, and later absorbed them. British Railways withdrew passenger services in 1962; a residual goods service to Witney remained until 1970. Origins Witney had been an important town with a significant woollen industry, but found itself at a competitive disadvantage as northern manufacturing towns gained railway connections. A number of schemes were put forward, including a possible branch from the London and Birmingham Railway at Tring. The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway (OW&WR;) opened on 4 June 1853 from Wolvercot Junction, on the Great Western Railway (GWR) a little north of Oxford to , and Witney had at least a nearby station at . Nonetheless a railway to Witney itself was desirable, and after some false starts a public meeting was held on 23 December 1858 to propose a branch line from the OW&WR; at Yarnton, where there was to be a new junction station. Sir Charles Fox was appointed Engineer and in the 1859 session a Bill was presented to Parliament to authorise the railway. Despite GWR opposition, the Witney Railway was authorised by Act of 1 August 1859. Capital was to be ¬£50,000 in shares and ¬£16,000 in borrowings.Jenkins says ¬£34,000 in shares and ¬£16,000 in borrowings, but this seems to be an error; the phrase Capital ¬£50,000 and one- third of the sum in debentures may have been misinterpreted. Opening to Witney The Witney Railway and its connections in 1861 Joseph Pickering was appointed contractor to build the line, and an arrangement was made with the OW&WR; company for it to work the line for 10 years for 50% of gross receipts. By the time of opening, the OW&WR; had merged with another company and formed the West Midland Railway. On 5 November 1861 Captain Tyler of the Board of Trade made a formal inspection. He approved the line for opening, noting that the Witney station was temporary only, \\"pending construction of a permanent station, the probable site of which is as yet uncertain\\". There was no turntable at Witney, so only tank engines might be used, and a turntable was to be provided within twelve months. Sidings seem not to have been provided at first. The line was single, and eight miles long,Actually . with earthworks and overbridges made for double track. It was to be worked on the one engine in steam principle. The permanent way employed Seaton rails, in which the material below the head was formed in an inverted V in section; the rail was supported on a triangular longitudinal timber itself bedded on longitudinal timbers. Tyler commented that > This form of rail is not well adapted for obtaining a maximum of strength > from the iron employed, but the roadway will I conceive be a safe one for > the light traffic There is one disadvantage attending it, that it is not > available for the application of points and crossings, and where these are > employed, other forms of rails have to be intermingled with it. The line was ceremonially opened amid considerable festivity on 13 November 1861, and the public passenger service started the next day, 14 November 1861.MacDermot says 18 November 1861; Carter says 20 November. As the connections to the goods facilities were not yet in place, the operation of a goods service was delayed until 1 March 1862, a local contractor Malachi Bartlett being brought in to complete work apparently left unfinished by Pickering. It appears that goods working was performed by mixed (passenger and goods) trains. There were four or five return trips to Oxford in the early years of the line's operation. Intermediate stations were at South Leigh and Eynsham. At the time of planning the new line, the OW&WR; was running through trains to London over the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) and Yarnton would have been an important interchange. By the time of opening, the OW&WR; had changed its allegiance to the GWR, and Yarnton lost its significance. Building the new station there was the responsibility of the West Midland Railway, and they delayed opening it until summer 1863. It had a separate bay platform and run-round for the Witney trains. The Company was profitable, earning between ¬£4,000 and ¬£4,600 throughout its first decade. The East Gloucestershire Railway The East Gloucestershire Railway was originally conceived as a through line from Faringdon to Cheltenham, with a branch to Witney. It obtained an authorising Act in 1862 with share capital of ¬£600,000, but GWR opposition frustrated the promoters' intentions, and a second Act was obtained on 29 July 1864, for a line to be worked by the Midland Railway. The GWR appealed against the arrangement, and the powers were reduced to building a line from Witney to Fairford, with share capital of ¬£300,000. The East Gloucestershire Railway and its connections on opening The usual Board of Trade inspection took place on 10 January 1873 and the line was opened with the usual ceremony on 14 January 1873, with ordinary passenger operation starting the next day. In effect the line was simply an extension of the Witney line. The junction at Witney was on the Oxford side of the original Witney station, so that the new Witney station was on the new line; the former Witney station was reduced to the status of a goods station. Fairford station in 1961 Stations on the new line were therefore Fairford, Lechlade, Alvescot, Bampton and Witney. The GWR operated the line (as a continuous branch incorporating the Witney line and the new extension) and also maintained the line. Absorption by the GWR Whereas the Witney Railway had achieved its objective, of connecting the town to the railway network, the East Gloucestershire Railway failed in its long-distance objective. Limited to a local service only, and being worked by and dependent on the GWR, the question of its absorption by the larger company arose. The East Gloucestershire Company was absorbed by share purchase on 1 July 1890; the Witney Railway Company sold out on the same date. The line was now in effect the Fairford branch of the GWR. Stations and features on the line The stations on the line were: * ; the configuration showed its conception as a through station, with a platform on the Cheltenham side of Lechlade Road overbridge, and the run-round loop and goods shed to the west of it. * * ; opened on 4 November 1907; initially referred to as a platform. * * ; opened on 2 October 1944 to serve the new RAF station at Brize Norton. * Bampton; renamed on 1 May 1940. * ; the passenger station was the new, through station built by the East Gloucestershire Railway; the original Witney Railway terminus was a goods station on a short spur.  ; opened on 9 March 1936; on the south side of the Cheltenham main road, the access was found to be dangerous and in 1947 it was moved to the north side, where direct access to the village was provided, avoiding the main road crossing. Later years BR closed the line to passenger traffic on 18 June 1962. The section between Yarnton and Witney only remained open to goods traffic until 2 November 1970, when BR closed it completely. Reopening the railway There is a strong case for reopening the line, with severe traffic congestion on the roads to and from Oxford. In January 2019, Campaign for Better Transport released a report identifying this line was listed as Priority 2 for reopening. Priority 2 is for those lines which require further development or a change in circumstances (such as housing developments). p.42 Notes References Sources   * External links * The Fairford Branch Line * Fairford Railway, Fairford History Society * Category:Closed railway lines in South East England Category:Closed railway lines in South West England Category:History of Gloucestershire Category:History of Oxfordshire Category:History of Oxford Category:Rail transport in Oxfordshire Category:Rail transport in Gloucestershire Category:Railway lines opened in 1861 Category:Railway lines opened in 1873 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1890 Category:Railway lines closed in 1970 Category:Transport in Oxford Category:West Oxfordshire District Category:1861 establishments in England ","title":"Oxford, Witney and Fairford Railway"},{"id":"20058552","text":"Spank Rock and Benny Blanco Are... \\"Bangers & Cash\\" is an EP by Philadelphian Virginian alternative hip hop group Spank Rock and record producer Benny Blanco.

The ability to layer many features onto the same map and select or unselect as needed allows for a multitude of views and ease of interpreting data. More important, this allows for in depth scientific analysis and problem solving. Mean grain sizes found as sediment. Ichthyology involves many areas of study related to fishes and their habitat. The natural habitat is water, but fish are dependent upon many other factors. Water quality, type, food, cover, sediment are essential for the life cycle of any given fish. Being able to map the presence of certain species with layers of these features provides invaluable insight into species requirements. GIS is an essential tool that allows immediate visualization of all data present and to accurately interpret impacts of habitat degradation or species success. GIS GIS is useful when data is specific to a location. It is used to classify, analyze and understand data relationships based on the location and then drawing conclusions from the data. Data capture can occur in the field on small, handheld GPS devices, and then imported and compared to an existing map. This freedom of movement between field and computer is critical to streamlining data collection in field endeavors and generating more accurate data sets. Ichthyology Connecticut fish sampling sites on water. Mercury in fish consumption advisory. Ichthyology requires an understanding species geographic requirements. Fish require different abiotic environments or sediments for successful completion of biological life cycle based on species. Serious examinations of species should always include habitat because habitat differences create changes in population. Sediment could thereby be mapped and changes in sediment could easily be verified using previous records while simultaneously showing changes in resident fish populations. Various factors relating to the fish life cycle, such as food sources, migration patterns, changes in spawning grounds, could all be more accurately explained and documented using GIS versus a more traditional paper. More important, data could be gathered in the field on handheld GPS units and downloaded directly to an existing map. Streamlining data entry removes error by having observations made and recorded and entered in the field while observations are actively being recorded and uploading the data to a computer upon return to the lab. The other alternative is making observations in the field and then recording the data upon return to the lab; this second technique can allow for opinions to affect how data in interpreted during collection. Advantages One of the biggest advantages in using GIS is assimilating information and using it to highlight significance or irrelevant data. Use of GIS increases the possible integration of many different types of data into a single usable resource making analysis and interpretation easier as well as increasing management of the data involved. Ichthyology is a field of study that requires active examination of a multitude of areas at the same time for accurate study. GIS programs improve spatial data aspects frequently to accurately represent substrate, habitat, quality or other various factors. This tool enables scientists to access information and share results quickly and concisely. Scientists realize the need for a GIS component in their research as evidenced by the founding of such groups as Fishery-Aquatic Research Group. This group organizes an annual symposium with the expressed goal of furthering ichthyology research utilizing GIS.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was named a National Historical Landmark in 1991. It was designated a New York City landmark in 2003.Harris, Gale (March 25, 2003) \\"Brown Building (formerly Asch Building) Designation Report\\" New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission History The iron and steel building was constructed in 1900‚Äì01, and was designed by John Woolley in the neo- Renaissance style., pp. 64‚Äì65 It was named the Asch Building after its owner, Joseph J. Asch.Historical plaque on the southeast corner of the Brown Building, facing Greene Street, placed by the New York Landmarks Preservation Foundation in 2003. During that time, the Asch Building was known for its \\"fireproof\\" rooms, which attracted many garment makers, including the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, which was the site of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire that killed 146 garment workers on March 25, 1911. The majority of the workers who occupied the Asch Building were female immigrants. The immigrants came to the United States for a better life, although they were working in terrible conditions within the factory and were underpaid. The building's top three floors were occupied by the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, owned by Russian immigrants who went by the names Max Blanck and Isaac Harris. Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, March 25, 1911 Even though the immigrants were provided a job, their work environment was not safe. Rooms were overcrowded with few working bathrooms and no ventilation, resulting in conditions ranging from sweltering heat to freezing cold. In regard to working conditions, the Asch Building at the time did not comply with several requirements that were needed to ensure the safety of the building. The rooms in the upper three floors were packed with flammable objects, including clothing products hanging from lines above workers' heads, rows of tightly spaced sewing machines, cutting tables bearing bolts of cloth, and linen and cotton cuttings littering the floors, that resulted in a massive spread of fire occurring in the matter of seconds. The building had a single fire escape that was not durable enough to hold many people, and there were no sprinklers installed in the building. The rooms on each floor were overcrowded because there was no limit at the time as to how many people could occupy one floor. The staircases did not have landings and the stairwells were poorly illuminated, resulting in unsafe, often dark conditions in the stairwells. A survivor of this incident indicated that there had been a blue glow coming from a bin under a table where 120 layers of fabric had just been stacked prior to cutting. Fire rose from the bin, ignited the tissue paper templates hung from the ceiling, and spread across the room. Once ignited, the tissue paper floated off haphazardly from table to table, setting off fires as it went. Many people died during the fire, some from inhaling thick smoke or from being burned in the fire. Others died because they jumped out the building's windows to escape the flames ‚Äì the interior stairs were blocked and the elevators stopped functioning properly because of the heat. Workers piled up at the entrance of the stairway because the stairway (which had no landing) was too dark for one to see his or her way down the steps. In the panic during the fire many people were crushed to death from behind while workers were attempting to get through the locked doors. As for the elevators, the owners and their family went into the elevator, which only could have held twelve people and escaped the building. In request of the owner, they told the elevator operator to send the elevator back up; however, by the time the elevator made its way back, the fire was fully engaged on the eighth floor and quickly spreading to the ninth. This had forced the workers to jump out the windows and jump into the elevator shaft that was nine stories down. Although there was the option of using the fire escape to get out of the burning building, only few did manage to escape through it. With many workers going through the fire escape, the fire escape eventually collapsed. Prior to the fire escape collapsing, people still could not make it to the ground safely, because the ladder from the fire escape did not reach the ground, nor was it close enough for people to jump down, which led to many more deaths. The New York City Fire Department did not have the proper equipment to battle the fire, such as the ladder, which ‚Äúcould only reach the sixth floor, fully two floors below the level of fire\\". The factory owners Max Blanck and Isaac Harris were charged with ‚Äúcriminal negligence‚Äù, and faced multiple lawsuits from the victims‚Äô families. As a result of this fire, there were several new building and safety regulations, ‚Äúsuch as mandatory fire drills, periodic fire inspections, working fire hoses, sprinklers, exit signs and fire alarms, doors that swung in the direction of travel and stairway size restrictions.‚Äù The fire led to wide-ranging legislation requiring improved factory safety standards and helped spur the growth of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. The building survived the fire and was refurbished. Three plaques on the southeast corner of the building commemorate the women and men who lost their lives in the fire. NYU began to use the eighth floor of the building for a library and classrooms in 1916. Real estate speculator and philanthropist Frederick Brown later bought the building and subsequently donated it to the university in 1929, when it was renamed the Brown Building. In 2002, the building was incorporated into the Silver Center for Arts and Science.

Retrieved 25 October 2013‚Äì 24 March 1980) was a German Oberkommando der Wehrmacht officer who served during World War II as the adjutant to Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel. He is notable for unwittingly helping to place the 20 July plot bomb that was intended to kill Adolf Hitler. Biography On 20 July 1944, he held the rank of Major and arrived at the Wolf's Lair headquarters in Rastenburg, East Prussia for a situation conference attended by Hitler. Also there as a subordinate to Field Marshal Keitel was Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg who arrived clutching a briefcase. As Stauffenberg was disabled following the loss of his right hand and two fingers from his left hand, von Freyend offered to carry it for him. Stauffenberg at first refused, but then relented upon approaching the conference room and he asked von Freyend to put him as near as possible to Hitler so that \\"I catch everything the F√ºhrer says for my briefing afterwards\\". Freyend placed the briefcase by the conference map table to the right of General Adolf Heusinger who was standing next to Hitler and Stauffenberg adjusted its position. However, Heinz Brandt, wanting to get a closer look at a map on the table, re-positioned the briefcase farther away from Hitler on the other side of a thick table leg. Seven minutes later the bomb exploded. It was later concluded that its exact positioning next to the table leg was a crucial factor in determining who in the room survived. Freyend survived the explosion and the remainder of the war. After surrendering with Keitel, he was briefly interrogated by the Americans who decided that he was not involved in military decision making and acted mainly as Keitel's valet. In the early 1950s, he became an employee of Gehlen Organization.

Rachel's father was for a time in the insurance business. She had one sibling, a younger brother, Gustave, who later became a chemist. She learned Hebrew as a child, and her family observed the major Jewish holidays. After her family moved to Warsaw, she attended a state gymnasium there. At school she became interested in mathematics and the natural sciences. She learned French and German, and took private lessons in Polish. At this time she also developed an interest in Jewish history and culture.Sherman, Claire Richter. \\"Rachel Wischnitzer: pioneer scholar of Jewish art,\\" Woman's Art Journal, vol. 1, no. 2 (Autumn 1980/Winter 1981), pp. 42-46. Wischnitzer studied at the University of Heidelberg in 1902 to 1903. She went on to study architecture in Brussels, at the Academie Nationale des Beaux-Arts, and in 1907 graduated from the √âcole Sp√©ciale d'Architecture in Paris, one of the first women to receive a degree in that field. She also studied art history for two semesters at the University of Munich in 1909 to 1910. After her return to Russia, she continued to publish scholarly articles and reviews, and to develop her ideas about Jewish art. She was especially interested in illuminated medieval Hebrew manuscripts, which she studied in the collections of St. Petersburg. In 1912 Rachel (Bernstein) married Mark Wischnitzer (1882-1955), a sociologist and historian, who was one of the editors of the Russian-language edition of the Jewish Encyclopedia (Evreiskaia entsiklopediia), where her first writings on synagogue architecture and ceremonial objects were published.\\"Dr. Mark Wischnitzer, Jewish historian, dies; was 73\\" Jewish Telegraphic Agency, 18 October 1955.

It is one of Wright's \\"Usonian\\" houses, which were designed to be functional homes for people of average means. The primary building construction materials employed in the design of the house were red brick, old growth tidewater cypress wood, and glass on a Cherokee red radiant heated concrete floor mat. The Richardson House, originally designed in 1941 to be built in Livingston, New Jersey but built a decade later in Glen Ridge due to complexities imposed by World War II, is set on a large suburban lot. The home is a stunning, extremely rare example of a FLLW Usonian home based on dynamic hexagonal geometry - all angles are either 60 or 120 degrees. Invisible from the street (save for its handsome gate) and tucked into a woodland meadow setting with a stream and multiple ponds and waterfalls running along its private landscaped entry, this hidden sanctuary is 20 miles/45 minutes door- to-door from midtown Manhattan. The home's centerpiece is a massive triangular living/dining space with prow-like wood-burning fireplace, an astonishing sculptural inverted truss pyramidal ceiling unlike anything seen in any other home designed by FLLW, and dramatic illuminated clerestory windows with perforated motifs that relate to the 'Scherzo' name of the home. Fourteen full-length french doors allow sunlight to pour in, swinging open onto two terraces and a flagstone in-ground heated swimming pool sparkling in the backyard oasis. In addition to the spacious triangular living/dining area, the home also contains a carport, entry/loggia, large kitchen, library/studio, two bedrooms, a guest bathroom, a master suite with separate bedroom, dressing area, and master bath, and a large garden/sun terrace. Every room contains the original desks, dressers, shelving, tables, chairs, and credenzas all designed by Wright, and there is ample storage space integrated throughout the home. A recent ten year restoration by previous owners John and Edith Payne with the expertise of New Jersey based TARANTINOarchitect returned this architectural treasure to the integrity and beauty FLLW envisioned, and earned the 2010 Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy Spirit Award for outstanding stewardship to private individuals in the conservation of their FLLW designed homes.

A Giffordland Mill, originally with stepping stones and now a bridge, lie at the Caaf Water (Keaff in 1747Roy's Military Survey of Scotland 1747-55 ); a smithy lay close to the Caaf Water near the Dalry to West Kilbride Road. A limekiln were located near to the 'Mains' farm buildings. A ford existed over the Auldmuir Burn until the late 19th century. The Auldmuir Burn runs through a deeply cut glen which has been planted up with beech trees in the vicinity of Giffordland Farm. A small building sat close to the junction of the road to Auldmuir, and a building known as 'Green House' is marked as a ruin in the 1840‚Äì1880 Ordnance Survey map and an active settlement on Roy's map of 1747.  History  A semi-natural 'Moot Hill' in the glen with old beech trees and the Auldmuir Burn The Barony of Giffordland included the estate of Auldmuir, including the one merk land of Wardlaw and Bradshaw. Paterson describes Gifford as being a mansion house set on the banks of a rivulet (the Auldmuir Burn) about two miles West of Dalry, small in dimensions, but surrounded by old woods.Paterson, James (1866), History of the Counties of Ayr and Wigton. Vol.III. - Cunninghame. Part 1. Pub. James Stillie, Edinburgh. P. 175‚Äì6. George Robertson gives the same account, but states in the 1820s that it was not in the best of order..

Cunninghmae press, Irvine. P. 102. The Barony would have had a Moot hill and the small mound in the Giffordland Glen shows signs of having been artificially altered (see illustration). Giffordland had also been known as Netherton.Thomas, Lord Boyd's lands. =The Giffords= Gifford or Giffordland takes its name from the Giffords or Giffards, a Norman family who under King William the Lion (1165‚Äì1214) obtained lands in Scotland, such as the Parish of Yester in the Lothians near Haddington. The male line failed with Sir Hugh Gifford who had four daughters and died in 1409.Groome, Francis H. (1903), Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland. Pub. Caxton Publishing, London. P. 646. Robertson relates that Sir Thomas Boyd of Kilmarnock married Alice, one of these four daughter co- heiresses, but he does not actually record any relationship with the Craufurds of Kilmarnock, progenitors of the Gifford cadet branch at just this time.Robertson, George (1823), A Genealogical Account of the Principal Families in Ayrshire, more particularly in Cunninghame. Vol.1. Pub. Cunninghmae press, Irvine. P. 105. A village named Gifford is located near the old Yester Castle of the Gifford's in East Lothian. =The Craufurds= Yester or Garvald Castle in East Lothian; once held by the Gifford family The Craufurds of Giffordland were cadets of the house of Craufurdland. John was the first of the line, son of John Craufurd of Craufurdland and living in 1440 was succeeded by his son John in 1480. Andrew Craufurd of Giffordland was killed at Flodden in 1513 and in 1547 John Craufurd was killed at the battle of Pinkie, having married twice, once to the daughter of the Laird of Kelburne; and secondly to the daughter of the Laird of Hunterston.Paterson, James (1866), History of the Counties of Ayr and Wigton. Vol.III. - Cunninghame. Part 1. Pub. James Stillie, Edinburgh. P. 177. The Craufurds of Birkheid were cadets of Giffordland. In 1543 John Craufurd of Giffordland and John Craufurd of Birkheid were found to have failed to support Mary Queen of Scots at the Siege of Coldingham during the troubles linked to King Henry VIII of England's attempts to persuade the Scottish Queen to marry his son, Prince Edward.Paterson, James (1866), History of the Counties of Ayr and Wigton. V. III. - Cunninghame. Part 1. Edinburgh : James Stillie. P. 31 - 32. John Craufurd obtained a grant of the lands of Giffordland from James VI under the Great Seal on 27 March 1576.

At the Castle of Blair on May 3, 1595, Margaret Craufurd and her husband Thomas Craufurd of Giffordland granted their eldest daughter, Grizel and her husband, John Blair of Windyedge, a third part of the Three pound land of Giffordland. At a later stage they also gave the lands of Bradshaw (Broadshaw) and Knockendon. It is recorded that Margaret Craufurd could not write and it is clear from the original parchment that the notary had to guide her hand. From this marriage the Blairs of Giffordland were descended.Dobie, James D. (ed Dobie, J.S.) (1876).

Isabel Craufurd, Grizel's sister, married John Craufurd of Walston and had been retoured a portion of the Giffordland lands in 1548; their son John died in France. Thomas Craufurd of Walston, their direct descendant, is recorded as a portioner of Giffordland after 1600 and he married a daughter of the Laird of Craufurdland.Robertson, George (1823), A Genealogical Account of the Principal Families in Ayrshire, more particularly in Cunninghame.

Alexander Blair inherited the lands from his father in 1634, confirmed by the Superior, Lord Boyd, in 1641. He married a Jean Brown of Burrowland and his second son, John, became Laird of Burrowland. The line continued and William Blair married an English Lady, having two sons, the eldest of whom, Edward, was a ward of Chancery due to a commission of lunacy and the youngest therefore became proprietor.

The model was solved by , who found that it was related to the Rogers‚ÄìRamanujan identities. The partition function of the hard hexagon model The hard hexagon model occurs within the framework of the grand canonical ensemble, where the total number of particles (the \\"hexagons\\") is allowed to vary naturally, and is fixed by a chemical potential. In the hard hexagon model, all valid states have zero energy, and so the only important thermodynamic control variable is the ratio of chemical potential to temperature Œº/(kT). The exponential of this ratio, z = exp(Œº/(kT)) is called the activity and larger values correspond roughly to denser configurations. For a triangular lattice with N sites, the grand partition function is :\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathcal Z(z) = \\\\sum_n z^n g(n,N) = 1+Nz+ \\\\tfrac{1}{2}N(N-7)z^2+\\\\cdots where g(n, N) is the number of ways of placing n particles on distinct lattice sites such that no 2 are adjacent. The function Œ∫ is defined by :\\\\kappa(z) = \\\\lim_{N\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} \\\\mathcal Z(z)^{1/N} = 1+z-3z^2+\\\\cdots so that log(Œ∫) is the free energy per unit site. Solving the hard hexagon model means (roughly) finding an exact expression for Œ∫ as a function of z. The mean density œÅ is given for small z by :\\\\rho= z\\\\frac{d\\\\log(\\\\kappa)}{dz} =z-7z^2+58z^3-519z^4+4856z^5+\\\\cdots. The vertices of the lattice fall into 3 classes numbered 1, 2, and 3, given by the 3 different ways to fill space with hard hexagons. There are 3 local densities œÅ1, œÅ2, œÅ3, corresponding to the 3 classes of sites. When the activity is large the system approximates one of these 3 packings, so the local densities differ, but when the activity is below a critical point the three local densities are the same. The critical point separating the low-activity homogeneous phase from the high-activity ordered phase is z_c = (11+5\\\\sqrt5)/2 = \\\\phi^5 = 11.09017.... with golden ratio œÜ. Above the critical point the local densities differ and in the phase where most hexagons are on sites of type 1 can be expanded as : \\\\rho_1 = 1-z^{-1}-5z^{-2}-34z^{-3}-267z^{-4}-2037z^{-5}-\\\\cdots : \\\\rho_2=\\\\rho_3 = z^{-2} + 9z^{-3} + 80z^{-4} + 965z^{-5}-\\\\cdots. Solution The solution is given for small values of z < zc by :\\\\displaystyle z=\\\\frac{-xH(x)^5}{G(x)^5} : \\\\kappa = \\\\frac{H(x)^3 Q(x^5)^2} {G(x)^2} \\\\prod_{n\\\\ge 1} \\\\frac{(1-x^{6n-4})(1-x^{6n-3})^2(1-x^{6n-2})} {(1-x^{6n-5})(1-x^{6n-1})(1-x^{6n})^2} :\\\\rho =\\\\rho_1=\\\\rho_2=\\\\rho_3= \\\\frac{-xG(x)H(x^6)P(x^3)}{P(x)} where :G(x) = \\\\prod_{n\\\\ge 1}\\\\frac{1}{(1-x^{5n-4})(1-x^{5n-1})} :H(x) = \\\\prod_{n\\\\ge 1}\\\\frac{1}{(1-x^{5n-3})(1-x^{5n-2})} :P(x) = \\\\prod_{n\\\\ge 1}(1-x^{2n-1}) = Q(x)/Q(x^2) :Q(x) = \\\\prod_{n\\\\ge 1}(1-x^n). For large z > zc the solution (in the phase where most occupied sites have type 1) is given by :\\\\displaystyle z=\\\\frac{G(x)^5}{xH(x)^5} : \\\\kappa = x^{-\\\\frac{1}{3}}\\\\frac{G(x)^3 Q(x^5)^2} {H(x)^2} \\\\prod_{n\\\\ge 1} \\\\frac{(1-x^{3n-2})(1-x^{3n-1})} {(1-x^{3n})^2} :\\\\rho_1 = \\\\frac{H(x)Q(x)(G(x)Q(x)+x^2H(x^9)Q(x^9))}{Q(x^3)^2} :\\\\rho_2=\\\\rho_3 = \\\\frac{x^2H(x)Q(x)H(x^9)Q(x^9)}{Q(x^3)^2} :R=\\\\rho_1-\\\\rho_2= \\\\frac{Q(x)Q(x^5)}{Q(x^3)^2}. The functions G and H turn up in the Rogers‚ÄìRamanujan identities, and the function Q is the Euler function, which is closely related to the Dedekind eta function. If x = e2œÄiœÑ, then q‚àí1/60G(x), x11/60H(x), x‚àí1/24P(x), z, Œ∫, œÅ, œÅ1, œÅ2, and œÅ3 are modular functions of œÑ, while x1/24Q(x) is a modular form of weight 1/2. Since any two modular functions are related by an algebraic relation, this implies that the functions Œ∫, z, R, œÅ are all algebraic functions of each other (of quite high degree) .

Created by general Pavel Kiselyov in 1832, the organization survived until 1948, when it was abolished by the communist authorities. Initially, by General Kiselyov's decree of April 2, 1832, the board had the authority of managing the Col≈£ea, Pantelimon and Filantropia hospitals in Bucharest. In the course of time, it created and managed other hospitals, mainly in Walachia, but also in Moldova. The Board was reorganized on October 2, 1864, when new legislation required the board's budget to be submitted to parliament's approval and that the accounting be done according to government regulations and subject of the control of the Court of Accounts (\\"Curtea de conturi\\"). To finance the hospitals, the board had been endowed with land property, a significant part located in the territories of the former Turkish rayas. By 1921 it had a property of tens of thousands hectares of farm land and over 50,000 hectares of forests. After the agrarian reform of the 1920s, the Board retained its right on the payments for oil extraction from its former properties. The board also owned several important buildings in Bucharest and several hotels in Sinaia. Building The building where Eforia Civil Hospitals functioned was located on Elisabeth Boulevard in Bucharest and built between 1885‚Äì1886 in neoclassical style. During the 1944 bombing, the building lost its roof, being renovated and upgraded after the war. Starting with 1950, the building hosted the People's Council of V. I Lenin District.

Legacy Sinclair was immortalised in the poem \\"The Ballad of George Sinclair\\" translated into English from the original Danish/Norwegian and written by Edvard Storm, in 1781.Edvard Storm, The Ballad of Sinclair, from Scottish Soldiers of Fortune by Grant (retrieved 13 November 2008) Childe Sinclair and his menyie steered Across the salt sea waves; But at Kringellens' mountain gorge They filled untimely graves. They crossed the stormy waves so blue, for Swedish gold to fight; May burning curses on them fall That strike not for the right! The horned moon is gleaming red, The waves are rolling deep; A mermaid trolled her demon lay - Childe Sinclair woke from sleep. Turn round, turn round thou Scottish youth, Or loud thy sire shall mourn; For if thou touchest Norway's strand, Thou never shall return. Henrik Wergeland wrote a historical tragedy of the incident, Sinklars D√∏d (Death of Sinclair), in about 1840. Wergeland also refers to the battle in his known poem Norges Fjelde (mountains of Norway), where he calls the lumber barricade used in the ambush a \\"barricade of freedom\\".

Like Herb Goldberg's The Hazards of Being Male, Farrell's The Myth of Male Power is considered a standard of the men's movement, and has been translated into several languages, including German and Italian. Defining male power and powerlessness Farrell explaining the future of our sons' definition of 'power' at the Integral Spiritual Experience World Conference of Spiritual Leaders, 2010. In The Myth of Male Power, Warren Farrell offered his first in-depth outline of the thesis he would eventually apply in his subsequent books‚Äîbooks on communication (Women Can‚Äôt Hear What Men Don‚Äôt Say), parenting (Father and Child Reunion), and the workplace (Why Men Earn More). As The Myth of Male Power's title implies, Farrell challenges the belief that men have the power by challenging the definition of power. Farrell defines power as \\"control over one's life.\\" He writes that, \\"In the past, neither sex had power; both sexes had roles: women's role was [to] raise children; men's role was [to] raise money.\\"Warren Farrell, The Myth of Male Power, (N.Y.: Simon & Schuster, 1993), Chp. 2 One of the examples that Farrell uses to illustrate male powerlessness is male-only draft registration. He writes that if any other single group (the examples he lists are Jews, African-Americans, and women) were selected based on their birth characteristics to be the only group required by law to register for potential death, we would call it anti-Semitism, racism or genocidal sexism. Men, he says, have been socialized to call it \\"glory\\" and \\"power,\\" and as a result do not view this as a negative. Farrell contends that this viewpoint creates psychological problems for both sexes: that \\"men's weakness is their facade of strength; women's strength is their facade of weakness.\\"Warren Farrell, The Myth of Male Power, (N.Y.: Simon & Schuster, 1993), Chapter 2 & 3. He adds that societies have generally socialized boys and men to define power as, in essence, \\"feeling obligated to earn money someone else spends while we die sooner.\\" Feeling obligated, he contends, is not power.This critique of Farrell is part of feminist James Sterba's critique of The Myth of Male Power and Why Men Earn More in Oxford University Press' book, Does Feminism Discriminate Against Men?, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), which is a debate of thirteen gender issues between James Sterba, representing feminist theory, and Warren Farrell, articulating gender transition theory. =\\"Why Men are the Disposable Sex\\"= The subtitle of the book is \\"Why Men are the Disposable Sex.\\" Farrell argues that historically both sexes were disposable in the service of survival: women risked death in childbirth; men risked death in war. However, Farrell notes, there is a key difference: women's disposability emanated more from biology; men's expendability required socialization.Farrell chapter 2. Farrell observes various characteristics of modern US society, such as the tendency to assign higher-risk jobs - soldier, firefighter, coal miner, and so on - to men: almost all of the most hazardous professions are all-male, and segments within professions have higher percentages of men as their level of hazard increases. Other statistics, in conjunction with the lack of public outcry or mobilization around them, point in the same direction of male expendability. Men are victims of violent crime twice as often as women and are \\"three times more likely to be murder victims\\". Suicide rates are much higher for men than for women. While the death rates for breast cancer and prostate cancer are comparable, the US spends six times as much on breast cancer. These statistics, Farrell suggests, can only be explained if US society places greater value on the lives of women than of men. Todd Jones cites this as an example of abductive reasoning: rightly or wrongly, Farrell assumes that such behavior is rational, and the only explanation then is that \\"women are actually perceived as the valuable gender (especially in evolutionary terms) who need to be protected and preserved at all cost, while men (a dime a dozen in evolutionary terms) are thought of as essentially disposable\\". =\\"Where Do We Go From Here?\\"= Farrell posits that men and women need to make an evolutionary shift from a focus on survival to a focus on a proper balance between survival and fulfillment. He claims that the women's movement has led to the re- socialization of girls to become women who balance survival with fulfillment but that there has been no similar re-socialization of boys to become men who pursue that balance once they take on the responsibility of children. Thus, Farrell believes, boys and men are decades behind girls and women psychologically and socially, and increasingly behind women academically and economically.especially Components 1 and 2. In Farrell's recent presentations on this topic, he estimates that men are in 2011 where women were in 1961.(text of a presentation from the Dec. 2010 Integral Spiritual Experience). Farrell's political solution is \\"neither a women's movement blaming men nor a men's movement blaming women, but a gender transition movement.\\" He defines a gender transition movement as one that fosters a transition from the rigid roles of our past to more flexible roles for the future.Warren Farrell, The Myth of Male Power, (N.Y.: Simon and Schuster, 1993), Personal Introduction. =The \\"Pay Paradox\\"= Men, Farrell posits, learn to earn money to gain the approval of their parents and the respect of other men; heterosexual men also learn to earn money to earn their way to female love (\\"Women don't marry men reading Why Men Are the Way They Are in the unemployment line.\\") Farrell introduced in The Myth of Male Power a thesis that he pursued in-depth in Why Men Earn More in 2005: that earning money involves forfeiting power. He goes on to describe his theory that earning money is less about power, and more about trade-offs. Farrell proposes that \\"the road to high pay is a toll road--you earn more when you pay 25 specific tolls such as working more hours, or taking less-fulfilling or more-hazardous jobs...\\"Why Men Earn More, Dr. Warren Farrell, Part I. Critical responses Academic Kenneth Clatterbaugh, in an overview of literature of the men's movement, comments that \\"eventually, [Farrell's] arguments reach absurd heights, as when Farrell actually argues against sexual harassment laws and child molestation laws on the grounds that they give even more power (to abuse men) to (women) employees and children\\". Social critic Camille Paglia, writing for The Washington Post, says The Myth of Male Power \\"attacks the unexamined assumptions of feminist discourse with shocking candor and forces us to see our everyday world from a fresh perspective\\", though she added that Farrell is sometimes guilty of \\"questionable selectiveness or credulity about historical sources\\". Paglia nevertheless concludes that the book \\"is the kind of original, abrasive, heretical text that is desperately needed to restore fairness and balance to the present ideology-sodden curriculum of women's studies courses.\\" Reviewer Robert Winder describes the book as \\"shock-horror hyperbole posing as scholarship\\" and goes on to write \\"...Farrell might be right to see the gender conflict as a war to which only one side has turned up, but this is only a sarcastic way of confessing to an authentic male worry: the twinge of jealousy men sometimes feel when confronted by feminine solidarity. Farrell, however, just like some of his female opposite numbers, prefers accusation to self-examination\\". Linda Mealey notes that the book is recommended reading for educators in the social sciences, particularly gender studies; she does also critique Farrell for easily seeing causality in correlation. Academic Margot Mifflin writes that \\"most of Farrell‚Äôs tit-for- tat theories about man‚Äôs greater societal burden are slanted, self-serving, and absurdly simplistic.\\" Anthropologist Melvin Konner writes that, like Christina Hoff Sommers' Who Stole Feminism? (1994), The Myth of Male Power is a good antidote to the way in which \\"real knowledge about sex roles...tends to get buried in postmodernist rhetoric.\\" The Los Angeles Times notes that \\"...some critics say 'The Myth of Male Power' goes beyond the nurturing rituals of the male movement to mount an outright assault on the victories of the modern women's movement.\\" An article in Mother Jones notes that the book \\"...has spawned a network of activists and sites that take Farrell‚Äôs ideology in a disturbing direction.\\" The book includes several factual errors concerning murderer Laurie Dann, who is used as an example of violence against men by women. Farrell states that all of her victims were male, that she burned down a Young Men's Jewish Council, burned two boys in a basement, shot her own son, and alleged that she killed an eight-year old rapist. Some men's rights activists, academics, and media figures have repeated Farrell's errors and conclusion. Farrell later issued a correction on his web site.
