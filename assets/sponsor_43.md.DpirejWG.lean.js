He works steadily in many high-profile films. Harlow won an Academy Award for his work in the successful film Star Trek (2009), subsequently receiving another two nominations for The Lone Ranger (2013) and Star Trek Beyond (2016). Life and career Born and raised in Grand Forks, North Dakota, Harlow was inspired to work in film-making after seeing the 1933 film King Kong as a child. He later explained that he spent \\"hours in the basement creating things and I knew I wanted to make characters. I just didn't know what it was at the time, that makeup was the way to do that.\\" After graduating from high school he moved to New York City to attend the School of Visual Arts, where he majored in animation. Harlow worked together with actor Johnny Depp on several films, such as Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Alice in Wonderland. While they were both working on The Rum Diary in Puerto Rico, they found a photograph of a Native American which they developed into the makeup design used on Tonto as played by Depp in the 2013 film The Lone Ranger. They had also used it to encourage Walt Disney Studios into producing the film, as at the time that they discovered the image, the film was close to being dropped. In the final design of Tonto, some eight prosthetics were created by Harlow for Depp and eighteen overlapping prosthetics when the actor played the older version of the character. Awards In 2008, Harlow was nominated with Debbie Zoller, Brian Penikas, and Jake Garber for an Emmy Award for Prosthetic Makeup For A Series, Miniseries, Movie Or A Special for their work on the Mad Men season one episode \\"Nixon vs. Kennedy\\". He was a member of the team that won the Academy Award in 2009 for Star Trek, which he shared with Barney Burman and Mindy Hall. This was the first Oscar to have been awarded to any film in the franchise. He was once again nominated for an Academy Award for his work on The Lone Ranger alongside hairstylist Gloria Pasqua-Casny. He was the only person in the category who had previously been nominated. The award went to Adruitha Lee and Robin Mathews for Dallas Buyers Club.

the elements of X_i are said to be ‚Äúhomogeneous of degree i‚Äù. ** The index set I is most commonly \\\\N or \\\\Z, and may be required to have extra structure depending on the type of X. ** Grading by \\\\Z_2 (i.e. \\\\Z/2\\\\Z) is also important; see e.g. signed set (the \\\\Z_2-graded sets). ** The trivial (\\\\Z\\\\- or \\\\N-) gradation has X_0 = X, X_i = 0 for i eq 0 and a suitable trivial structure 0. ** An algebraic structure is said to be doubly graded if the index set is a direct product of sets; the pairs may be called ‚Äúbidegrees‚Äù (e.g. see spectral sequence). * A I-graded vector space or graded linear space is thus a vector space with a decomposition into a direct sum V = \\\\bigoplus_{i \\\\in I} V_i of spaces. ** A graded linear map is a map between graded vector spaces respecting their gradations. * A graded ring is a ring that is a direct sum of abelian groups R_i such that R_i R_j \\\\subseteq R_{i+j}, with i taken from some monoid, usually \\\\N or \\\\mathbb{Z}, or semigroup (for a ring without identity). ** The associated graded ring of a commutative ring R with respect to a proper ideal I is \\\\operatorname{gr}_I R = \\\\bigoplus_{n \\\\in \\\\N} I^n/I^{n+1}. * A graded module is left module M over a graded ring which is a direct sum \\\\bigoplus_{i \\\\in I} M_i of modules satisfying R_i M_j \\\\subseteq M_{i+j}. ** The associated graded module of an R-module M with respect to a proper ideal I is \\\\operatorname{gr}_I M = \\\\bigoplus_{n \\\\in \\\\N} I^n M/ I^{n+1} M. ** A differential graded module, differential graded \\\\mathbb{Z}-module or DG-module is a graded module M with a differential d\\\\colon M \\\\to M \\\\colon M_i \\\\to M_{i+1} making M a chain complex, i.e. d \\\\circ d=0 . * A graded algebra is an algebra A over a ring R that is graded as a ring; if R is graded we also require A_iR_j \\\\subseteq A_{i+j} \\\\supseteq R_iA_j. ** The graded Leibniz rule for a map d\\\\colon A \\\\to A on a graded algebra A specifies that d(a \\\\cdot b) = (da) \\\\cdot b + (-1)^{a}a \\\\cdot (db) . ** A differential graded algebra, DG- algebra or DGAlgebra is a graded algebra which is a differential graded module whose differential obeys the graded Leibniz rule. ** A homogeneous derivation on a graded algebra A is a homogeneous linear map of grade d = D on A such that D(ab)=D(a)b+\\\\varepsilon^{aD}aD(b), \\\\varepsilon = \\\\pm 1 acting on homogeneous elements of A. ** A graded derivation is a sum of homogeneous derivations with the same \\\\varepsilon. ** A DGA is an augmented DG-algebra, or differential graded augmented algebra, (see differential graded algebra). ** A superalgebra is a \\\\mathbb{Z}_2-graded algebra. *** A graded-commutative superalgebra satisfies the ‚Äúsupercommutative‚Äù law yx = (-1)^{x y}xy. for homogeneous x,y, where a represents the ‚Äúparity‚Äù of a, i.e. 0 or 1 depending on the component in which it lies. ** CDGA may refer to the category of augmented differential graded commutative algebras. * A graded Lie algebra is a Lie algebra which is graded as a vector space by a gradation compatible with its Lie bracket. ** A graded Lie superalgebra is a graded Lie algebra with the requirement for anticommutativity of its Lie bracket relaxed. ** A supergraded Lie superalgebra is a graded Lie superalgebra with an additional super \\\\Z_2-gradation. ** A differential graded Lie algebra is a graded vector space over a field of characteristic zero together with a bilinear map [,]\\\\colon L_i \\\\otimes L_j \\\\to L_{i+j} and a differential d\\\\colon L_i \\\\to L_{i-1} satisfying [x,y] = (-1)^{xy+1}[y,x], for any homogeneous elements x, y in L, the ‚Äúgraded Jacobi identity‚Äù and the graded Leibniz rule. * The Graded Brauer group is a synonym for the Brauer‚ÄìWall group BW(F) classifying finite- dimensional graded central division algebras over the field F. * An \\\\mathcal{A}-graded category for a category \\\\mathcal{A} is a category \\\\mathcal{C} together with a functor F\\\\colon \\\\mathcal{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{A}. ** A differential graded category or DG category is a category whose morphism sets form differential graded \\\\mathbb{Z}-modules. * Graded manifold ‚Äì extension of the manifold concept based on ideas coming from supersymmetry and supercommutative algebra, including sections on ** Graded function ** Graded vector fields ** Graded exterior forms ** Graded differential geometry ** Graded differential calculus In other areas of mathematics: * Functionally graded elements are used in finite element analysis. * A graded poset is a poset P with a rank function \\\\rho\\\\colon P \\\\to \\\\N compatible with the ordering (i.e. \\\\rho(x) < \\\\rho(y) \\\\implies x < y) such that y covers x \\\\implies \\\\rho(y)=\\\\rho(x)+1 .

The album, released on 15 January 2014, is a tribute to the life of the group's matriarch Nellie Shabalala (1953-2002), the late wife of Mambazo leader Joseph Shabalala. It is also only the second album in the group's 50-year career to feature female Zulu vocalists singing alongside the male members. Background Joseph Shabalala was married to Nellie for thirty years. During that time, Nellie became a supportive matriarch of her husband's group Ladysmith Black Mambazo.Goldstein, Mitch (2014). In Always With Us [CD booklet]. Ladysmith Black Mambazo. In 1976, the Shabalalas became Christians and joined the Church of God of Prophecy. Nellie began singing with other female churchgoers and eventually formed her own choir, which she later named Women of Mambazo.Shabalala, Joseph (2003). In Mamizolo [CD booklet]. Johannesburg: Gallo Record Company. In early 2000, Nellie and Women of Mambazo made their first studio album in a South African recording studio. In October 2001, Women of Mambazo supported Ladysmith Black Mambazo on a 30-date tour of the United Kingdom. In May 2002, before Women of Mambazo could build a name for itself, Nellie was brutally murdered by a masked gunman, and the recordings of Zulu church music that she had made with her group in the studio in 2000 remained unreleased for many years. Production The members of Ladysmith Black Mambazo had long desired to create a lasting memorial to Nellie's memory. In 2010, the opportunity finally arose and the group decided to mix together their own voices with the unreleased recordings Nellie made with Women of Mambazo in 2000. Work on the album project began in 2010, but it became technically very difficult to mix Mambazo's newly recorded vocals with Nellie's archive recordings in a seamless manner. As a result, the album took three years to complete. Upon its eventual release in early 2014, Always With Us garnered positive reviews, noting a \\"bittersweet\\" and \\"emotional\\" nature to the album's ten songs.

History of medical cinematography=Late 19th century The use of cinematography to enhance healthcare practice and delivery dates back to the late 19th century in Western Europe. √âtienne-Jules Marey (French scientist and physiologist), Eug√®ne-Louis Doyen (French surgeon), Boles≈Çaw Matuszewski (Polish cameraman, in France his first name was written as Boleslas), and Gheorghe Marinescu (Romanian neurologist) are some of the pioneers of medical cinematography.Genevi√®ve Aubert. Arthur Van Gehuchten takes neurology to the movies. NEUROLOGY 2002;59:1612‚Äì1618 In 1888, Doyen had his surgeries captured on film. His films were brought into disrepute by the fact that they were copied and shown on fairgrounds. The resulting social prejudice may explain the slow take-off of medical cinematography. For example, in 1910 someone said the following regarding Doyen's videos: ,‚ÄúThese pictures savoured of advertisement, and were never popular, save as a side show among the less scientifically inclined members of the profession.‚Äù Roentgen Cinematography. The British Medical Journal, Vol. 2, No. 2603 (Nov. 19, 1910), p. 1645 Doyen's work, however, marked the distinction between the concepts of ‚Äòfilm for entertainment‚Äô versus ‚Äòfilm for medicine‚Äô. In 1893, Marey used the technique to study human physiology and movement.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11lKItGNuiY In 1898 Boleslas Matuszewski recorded medical films in Paris (at the time, the world's neurologic capital). At Salp√™tri√®re and Piti√© hospitals he filmed surgeries and cases of persons affected by nervous and mental disorders. Gheorghe Marinescu (Romanian neurologist) studied under renowned French professor Jean- Martin Charcot and returned to Bucharest as Chief Physician at Pantelimon Hospital. Between 1898‚Äì1902 he conducted a cinematographic project, recording and analyzing a series of neurological conditions in patients. He perfected the application of filming techniques to clinical neurology and published five articles based on cinematographic analysis. Marinescu wrote that the role of cinematography is ‚Äúto complement and even replace, in whatever measure possible, the descriptive exposition of phenomena by more rigorous, more exact analysis, which consists of recording movement with the help of special procedures‚Äù Barboi A C, Goetz C, Musetoiu R. The origins of scientific cinematography and early medical applications. NEUROLOGY 2004;62:2082‚Äì2086 In 1905 Arthur Van Gehuchten (Belgian anatomist and neurologist) began to film neurologic patients and built up a collection of films for teaching purposes. His collection is exceptional both quantitatively and qualitatively.Genevi√®ve Aubert. Idem. Early 20th century: medical cinematography as propaganda In 1910 Thomas Edison produced the first ever public health education film, raising awareness about the prevention of tuberculosis. The view at the time was that ‚Äúpropagandists saw education as limited to providing facts. Propaganda was designed to control opinions and actions, without having to use direct force. Propaganda appealed to most progressive health reformers as a way of providing genuine popular democratic support for the trained medical elite. Dr. H. E. Kleinschmidt of the Tuberculosis Association defined good propaganda as ‚Äòmental inoculation‚Äô whose avowed goal was ‚Äòwill-control through education‚Äô. The goal of health propagandists was not simply to inform but to persuade, to control individual thoughts and actions.‚Äù Martin S. Pernick. Thomas Edison's Tuberculosis Films: Mass Media and Health Propaganda. The Hastings Center Report, Vol. 8, No. 3 (Jun., 1978), pp. 21-27 Edison‚Äôs film came under criticism for ‚Äúthe distortions, exaggerations, and inaccuracies inherent in the melodrama format. The films clearly exaggerated the power of medicine to deal with tuberculosis; and they greatly over dramatized the effects and symptoms of the disease.‚Äù During World War I, the use of medical propaganda appealed to the US government and private agencies, which worked together ‚Äúto produce and distribute anti-venereal disease motion pictures, including the feature-length melodramas Fit to Fight and The End of the Road and other lesser-known films. These movies, originally made for military trainees and war workers, were revised for showing to civilians, as evidence mounted that many soldiers had been infected prior to induction.‚Äù Martin S. Pernick. Sex Education Films. Isis, Vol. 84, No. 4 (Dec., 1993), pp. 766-768 Medical cinematography employed in healthcare The 1930s saw the rise of medical cinematography employed to reach goals of public health. In 1933, the Journal of Communication published an article regarding immunization propaganda in the US: ‚ÄúDr. Nash has enlisted the cinematograph film. He has noticed that American films illustrating immunization never show the instant of puncture, so that spectators are left to infer something disagreeable. But in the 16 mm. film taken by Kodak Ltd. in his own clinic the whole operation is photographed, and although now and then there may be a grimace or a hint of nervousness, there is certainly no crying or resistance. The children in the film, quite unrehearsed, behave perfectly. It is an excellent film and should do much to dispel parental apprehensions.‚Äù Immunization Propaganda. The British Medical Journal, Vol. 1, No. 3769 (Apr. 1, 1933), p. 573 In a 1935 issue of the British Medical Journal, one could read the following advice regarding the use of films in public health: ‚ÄúIf the medical profession wanted, for example, to introduce widespread prophylaxis against diphtheria it could take a leaf out of Papworth's book and tell a story on the films that would help to wipe out diphtheria in a few years' time. It is no good trying to persuade people of the Tightness of this or that measure of health with the sweet voice of reason. It is the emotional appeal that wins the day; reason follows humbly after. The film, with its forcible assault upon both eye and ear, is a powerful weapon of propaganda. And it could be used with effect for ‚Äòputting across‚Äô to the public the idea of preventive medicine. Perhaps the Minister of Health, Sir Kingsley Wood, a master of propaganda, might enlist the help of the moving picture in his campaign for the improved health of the people.‚Äù Papworth and Propaganda. The British Medical Journal, Vol. 2, No. 3911 (Dec. 21, 1935), pp. 1213-1214 Contemporary cinematographic use in healthcare: healthcare knowledge transfer By the 1980s, medical films had become an established vehicle of both medical and patient training. A 1987 issue of the American Journal of Nursing contained a full-page section on Films & Tapes covering broad topics such as Aids to Daily Living for the elderly, working moms, AIDS, alcohol abuse and even emotional fitness.Film listings. The American Journal of Nursing, Vol. 87, No. 12 (Dec., 1987), p. 1713 Today, the concept of healthcare knowledge transfer recognizes that film clips (with carefully crafted and verified content, and using graphics, animations and live-action video), can be one of the most efficient ways of transferring knowledge with clarity and speed, to both lay-people (patients, families, and friends), and healthcare professionals. Traditionally the transfer of generic information (i.e. non patient-specific information) tends to happen on a somewhat ad-hoc, live, one-to-one basis, that is generally less well structured, less comprehensive, and thus less successful (whilst also being more expensive and less time efficient). However, in order to be efficient and effective, the quality of the film's content must be very high. A patient's understanding of conditions and treatments is important to their care and well-being, so it is useful for carefully crafted clips to be available 24/7. It also helps patients when attending the all-important one- to-one consultations that are the bedrock of good healthcare. If patients are better informed and better prepared they can focus on their own case rather than generic issues. The literature in this area also contains examples of what can happen when the film content is not particularly well crafted and presented. In 2000, a UK cancer study highlights the impact of poor quality video. The authors acknowledge that ‚Äúnot all randomised trials of video education, however, have had similarly consistent results. A randomised trial in patients undergoing colonoscopy reported increased knowledge and satisfaction but failed to demonstrate a reduction in anxiety. A similar study in patients receiving genetic counseling reported similar benefits but again no reduction in anxiety. Two further randomised trials, the first in patients having breast surgery and the second in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty, failed to show any improvement in satisfaction or anxiety. The variation in these trial results suggests that, like all educational materials, the quality of the content is paramount and how it is used is vital to success. Involving patients in the development and showing patients recounting their personal experience undoubtedly helps. Using respected TV personalities offers the familiar face of respectability and professionalism. Above all, most studies fail to take advantage of the role which video has to play in continuing the educational process at home with their carers and friends, but instead ask patients to watch it in the unfamiliar environment of the clinic.‚Äù Thomas R et al. Forewarned is forearmed - benefits of preparatory information on video-cassette for patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy - a randomised controlled trial. European Journal of cancer 36 (2000) 1536-1543). With the widespread use of the internet since the late 1990s, there is a tremendous potential for health-related films to be made available, free at the point of need, over the internet. Moreover, the 21st century sees an expanding integration of social media and mobile devices into our lives, thus enabling an even wider adoption of film-based health knowledge transfer. Case studies of healthcare knowledge transfer via cinematography A recent slate of long-form films includes ‚ÄòOutreach‚Äô - a film about the workings of a specialist spinal injury unit, [h The Spinal Injury Patient Film], an award-winning film for new patients with spinal cord injuries, Choosing a Wheelchair,http://www.choosingawheelchair.com a film about the correct protocol of wheelchair assessment and procurement for individual patients, and several films on cancer survivorship. Choosing a wheelchair: case study in the UK The 55 minute production is set to help improve well- being and long-term outcomes for Britain's 1.2 million wheelchair users. Too many people do not understand the importance of getting the right wheelchair; the right set-up and support, and the appropriate pressure relief. UK provision is patchy, indeed there is - surprisingly - no qualification requirement for a wheelchair services provider/specifier in the National Health Service (NHS). The film includes leading experts and practitioners in this area, plus case studies, and even an introductory history of the wheelchair. It thus provides a comprehensive and holistic overview of best practice and assessment, and is supported by many voices of experience. For the NHS the long-term cost benefits of proper provision in an aging population are very considerable. Spinal injury patient film Newly injured spinal cord injury (SCI) patients are anxious about what is happening to them and the related long-term implications. When a patient is admitted to hospital with an SCI it is traumatic for their family, friends and loved ones too. One challenge faced by clinicians is communicating with a patient's ‚Äòadvocates‚Äô, people who may know little of spinal cord injury, the care process, nor the problems of prognosis. They may be understandably overwhelmed, they want answers... ‚Äúdoctor, will he/she walk again?‚Äù. Inspired by patient feedback, award-winning director Marcus Dillistone, has created the film ‚ÄúFrom Darkness Into Light‚Äù],http://www.spinalinjury.tv to help explain the core issues with SCI and to provide patient insight. The film is designed not to replace face- to-face discussion, but to complement it. The film was conceived as a ‚Äòprescriptive‚Äô communications tool in hospitals, with the decision of when (and if) to introduce the film to the patient or their advocates being made by the clinical team. Cancer survivorship films When a person is diagnosed with cancer, treatment is often the focus of discussion among patients, health care providers and family. However, the next phase of care, cancer survivorship, is much less discussed. The 2005 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report ‚ÄúFrom Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition‚Äù Institute of Medicine: From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Translation. 2005, National Academy Press: Washington, D.C. raised the awareness of the issue. Survivors of cancer face unique challenges, while health care providers do not always have the time, resource and training to provide counseling and assistance. A 2005 randomized controlled study, Moving Beyond Cancer Trial,Stanton, A. L., et al., Outcomes from the Moving Beyond Cancer psychoeducational, randomized controlled trial with breast cancer patients. J Clin Oncol, 2005. 23(25): p. 6009-18. showed that a peer-modeling video as a psychoeducation tool is more effective than print materials in recovery of energy/vitality in post-treatment breast cancer patients. This 23-minute film, now available on the National Cancer Institute website, addressed re-entry challenges in four life domains: physical health, emotional well-being, interpersonal relations, and life perspectives. Designed to promote adaptive peer modeling, the film observes four breast cancer survivors as they describe their experience in each of the four domains, as well as active coping skills they used to meet associated challenges. The film also includes commentary by an oncologist expert in breast cancer on the re-entry experience and on active methods for approaching problems during re-entry. Since then, many video resources have been made available on the internet to cancer survivors and their care providers. Examples include a general education video on the issues of cancer survivorship produced by the IOM, a video series by Living Beyond Breast Cancer, a national education and support organization, addressing specific and sometimes sensitive issues during breast cancer survivorship.

The current club was formed in 2003 by a merging between the floorball section of H√∂gaborgs BK and Raml√∂sa IBK. In the spring of 2003 the club separated with H√∂gaborg and formed the standalone club FC Helsingborg. The team acquired H√∂gaborgs place in the Elitserien (currently Swedish Super League.) The team has played a total of 6 playoffs since the first time in the season of 2005/2006, were FCH was eliminated after losing 3:0 in a best-of-5 series against Pixbo Wallenstam IBK. The following season the team was eliminated after losing to Warberg IC with 8‚Äì5 in the 5th decisive game of the quarter-final series. After that the team was unable to secure a playoff-spot for the following two season. In 2009/2010, FCH was once again eliminated after losing the series 3:0 against Warberg IC in the quarter-finals. In the 2010/2011 season the team faced IBF Falun, and was eliminated after an overtime penalty-shootout in game 5. FCH did not qualify for playoffs during the 2012/2013 season. FCH started the 2013/2014 season with a new head coach, Magnus Svensson, but opened the regular season poorly. Decision was made to take in former player Magnus Anderberg as new head coach. He led the team to the playoffs, where they were eliminated after losing 4:0 in games against Pixbo Wallenstam IBK, all of which were overtime losses. The 2014/2015 season was the most successful in team franchise history. FCH finished 7th place in the table at the end of the regular season, and was picked to face Pixbo Wallenstam IBK in the quarter- finals. FCH won the series 4:2, but lost the semi-finals 4:1 in games against Link√∂ping IBK. It was the first time in franchise history FCH had reached semi-finals, and the bronze was also the first since the introduction of a national floorball series. On 23 November 2008, football legend Henrik Larsson made his debut for FCH against J√∂nk√∂pings IK in front of 1 968 spectators. FCH won the game 7-6 after sudden-death. Henrik Larssons unexpected change of clubs caught huge attention in the media. He was noted for 9 games during the 2008/2009 season, scoring 4 assist and 1 goal, an empty-netter against V√§ster√•s IB. With that goal Larsson set the new league-record for longest time between goals in the highest league, 19 years between his 6th and 7th career goals. Larsson scored his first points for Viskan HBK during their time in the highest league in the fall of 1989.

Background An armistice was concluded on 28 January 1871 to allow elections to the French National Assembly. A preliminary peace was signed on 26 February with the Treaty of Frankfurt signed on 10 May.A. J. P. Taylor, The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848-1918 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983), p. 317. The Prussian State Ministry on 8 February recommended an indemnity of 1 billion thaler (3 billion francs), 95% of which would be paid to the army. The Prussian Finance Minister Otto von Camphausen said: > The German nation had after all suffered so many additional losses in blood > and material goods which are beyond all accounting that it is entirely > justified to assess the price of the war generously and in addition to the > estimated sum to demand an appropriate surcharge for the incalculable > damages.Jonathan Steinberg, Bismarck: A Life (New York: Oxford University > Press, 2011), p. 309. The Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck sent his personal banker Gerson von Bleichr√∂der to negotiate between the French government and French financial circles. Adolphe Thiers, the head of the French provisional government, offered an indemnity of 1.5 billion francs and claimed that France would be unable to pay 5 billion. Bismarck responded by saying that the Prussian Army would occupy France, \\"we will see if we can get 5 billion francs from it\\".Geoffrey Wawro, The Franco-Prussian War: The German Conquest of France in 1870-1871 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 305. Bismarck wrote that \\"France being the richest country in Europe, nothing could keep her quiet but effectually to empty her pockets\\". The French National Assembly ratified the terms by 546 votes to 107. Indemnity Areas of France occupied until the indemnity was paid The indemnity was 5 billion francs (¬£200 million or $1 billion), with German troops occupying France until it was paid.David Thomson, Europe since Napoleon. Second Edition (London: Longman, 1963), p. 291. The 5 billion gold marks, converted using the retail price index in 2011, was worth 342 billion. Converted using the GDP deflater it amounted to 479 billion and substantially more according to other comparisons such as GDP per head.Steinberg, p. 329. The indemnity was proportioned, according to population, to be the exact equivalent to the indemnity imposed by Napoleon on Prussia in 1807.A. J. P. Taylor, Bismarck: The Man and the Statesman (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1955), p. 133. Aftermath The last payment of the indemnity was paid in early September 1873, two years before the deadline, and the German army of occupation was withdrawn in mid-September. It was generally assumed at the time that the indemnity would cripple France for thirty or fifty years.Wawro, p. 310. However, the Third Republic that emerged after the war embarked on an ambitious programme of reforms: it introduced banks, built schools (reducing illiteracy), improved roads, increased railways into rural areas, encouraged industry and promoted French national identity rather than regional identities. France also reformed the army, adopting conscription. In Germany the swift payment of the indemnity caused a stock market boom, along with an asset bubble in the form of a property boom. This lasted until the Panic of 1873 which ushered in the Long Depression until 1896.Steinberg, pp. 329-330.

Still in the second level, Palhinha scored his first senior goal on 4 April 2015, his header contributing to a 3‚àí1 home victory over Leix√µes SC. From July 2015 to January 2017 he was loaned to Primeira Liga clubs Moreirense F.C. and C.F. Os Belenenses, respectively, making his debut in the competition whilst with the former in a 0‚àí2 home loss to F.C. Arouca where he played 22 minutes from the bench, and netting for the first time while at the service of the latter against Vit√≥ria de Guimar√£es (1‚àí1 away draw, 90 minutes played). Subsequently, returned to the Est√°dio Jos√© Alvalade, Palhinha made his competitive debut with the first team on 21 January 2017, starting in a 2‚àí2 draw at C.S. Mar√≠timo. He scored his first goals for them on 12 October of the same year, netting twice in a 4‚Äì2 away win over ARC Oleiros in the Ta√ßa de Portugal. Palhinha spent the following two seasons on loan to S.C. Braga. He appeared in 76 competitive matches during his spell, helping to a third-place finish in 2019‚Äì20 and notably scoring the game's only goal against S.L. Benfica for the club's first win at that opposition in 65 years.

The Soroda dynasty is a part of the Nala dynasty and originated from the Khidisingi clan. They are contemporary to Raja Mukunda Dev-I of Puri and the same is reflected in all the 24 volumes of Raja Mukunda Dev of Puri. According to the Census Report of T.J. Maltobi of 1880, the Khidisingi Estate was established in 1168 by Raja Sobha Chandra Singh of Sabeijaipur. He was crowned by the Tribal Chief Pattamalik (Last Kandha king of Khidisingi) and his four sons on the order of Goddess Barahi. The Khidisingi estate was bounded by Hinjalak(Hinjili) in the east, Kalahandi, Jaipore and Gadapur in the west, Khimandi in the south and Ghumusar in the north. They were devotees of Goddess Khambeswari or Stambeswari. Goddess Kandhunidevi is one of the Chata Khamba. Their Gotra is Parasara. Seven generations of Raja Sobha Chandra Singh ruled the Khidisingi estate peacefully by the successors like Krushna Chandra Singh, Raya Singh, Priti Singh, Padmanava Singh, Bikram Singh and Baliar Singh. In 1476, Raja Baliar Singh divided the Khidisingi into four princely states among his four sons: *Badagada ‚Äì Raja Daman Singh *Dharakote ‚Äì Raja Hadu Singh *Soroda ‚Äì Raja Sandhadhanu Singh (also known as Abhaya Pratap) *Sheragada ‚Äì Raja Parsuram Singh (Minor) (Represented by Raja Baliar himself). The Soroda estate was ruled by Raja Sandhadhanu Singh, his son Raja Shyam Sunder Singh and Raja Kunja Singh peacefully and without much trouble. Raja Kunja Singh accepted the British rule along with other princely states of Ganjam and Orissa. In 1830, Raja Janardhan Singh succeeded to the throne of Soroda. He was a tyrannical king and also a revolutionary ruler. He refused to pay cess and duties to the Britishers and as a result of that the Soroda estate was auctioned by the Britishers on 09.12.1833 and the king of Ghumusar auctioned it. Raja Janardan Singh organized the tribals of Khidisingi and revolted against the Britishers staying at the hilltop of Chakunda forest of Badagada. The Britishers compelled Raja Raghunath Singh of Badagada and arrested Raja Janardan Singh. Raja Janardan Singh and his son Yubraj Sunder Singh Deo again organized the tribels and fought with the king of Ghumusar to take revenge and become successful in their mission. At this instances the Britishers were compelled to grant the inam villages of Sundarrajpur(Lanjipally), Pitala and Dhobadi to Raja Janardan Singh and his son Yubraj Sunder Singh Deo. Raja Sunder Singh Deo was a peace-loving king and preferred to stay in Sundarrajpur (Lanjipally). Raja Sobha Chandra Singh Deo, son of Raja Sunder Singh Deo continued to rule Soroda in exile. The system was discontinued for some time and the rituals were continued by the freedom fighter and social activist Jagannath Singh Deo at the instances of Great freedom fighter Sashi Bhusan Rath and others and is being continued by his son Dr. Debadutta Singh Deo.

The border runs lengthwise through the two buildings, passing just to the left of the mural. The mural and everything to the right of it lies in Switzerland; France lies to the left. The Hotel Arbez, also called the Hotel Arbez Franco-Suisse, is a hotel that straddles the international border between France and Switzerland in the tiny village of La Cure, which is itself divided by the boundary. Built by a private landowner and businessman specially to take advantage of an impending border adjustment between the two countries, the structure was originally used as a grocery store (its Swiss portion) and a pub (the French half). Today, the entire building houses a hotel, whose dining room, kitchen and several rooms are bisected by the boundary. Background The unique situation of the Hotel Arbez grew out of a dispute between France and Switzerland over possession of the Vallee des Dappes, just south and west of the tiny town of La Cure. Though the valley had little value as a territorial possession, it provided an accessible military route between France and Savoy. Annexed by Napoleonic France in 1802, it was returned to Switzerland by the Congress of Vienna, though the French continued to call for its retrocession. After several attempts to acquire the area were firmly rebuffed by the Swiss, France decided in 1862 to offer a nearby section of its own territory, comparable in size, in exchange. The Swiss agreed, and a treaty was accordingly signed in Bern by which slightly less than changed hands. While La Cure had previously been located entirely inside France, the new boundary was slated to cut the village --including some residences and a pub--in half. The treaty stipulated that any already-existing structure bisected by the border was to be left undisturbed, and this gave one local businessman an idea. Construction of the hotel At the time of the signing of the treaty in December 1862, the land currently occupied by the Hotel Arbez was owned by a French citizen named Ponthus. Taking advantage of the provision about leaving undisturbed previously- existing buildings bisected by the new boundary, coupled with the delay in ratification by the Swiss Parliament, he hurriedly erected a three-story structure in a location that would straddle the border, with approximately one-third in what would become Swiss territory, and the remaining two-thirds in France. Hoping to take advantage of the new cross-border traffic, he opened a grocery store in the Swiss portion of the building and a bar in the French section. By 1921 Ponthus's heirs had fallen on hard times, and the building was sold to Jules-Jean Arbeze, who remodeled it and reopened it as a hotel. World War II and afterwards During the German occupation of France in World War II, their troops were allowed to enter the French side of the hotel, but were strictly prohibited from crossing to the Swiss side. Since the stairway to the upper floor started in French territory but ended in Switzerland, the Germans were not permitted to access any of the upper rooms, which became a refuge for refugees and French Resistance members. The hotel was chosen in 1962 for negotiation of the √âvian Accords between France and Algeria, which resulted in the independence of the latter. The Arbez today Today, the Franco-Swiss border passes through the kitchen, dining room, hallway and several rooms of the Hotel Arbez: *The dining room is divided by the boundary. *The bar is entirely located in France, though the boundary passes just outside its front door. *The bed in the honeymoon suite is bisected by the border, with half in France and half in Switzerland. *The main hall and stairway are bisected by the border. The lower half of the stairs lie in France, the upper half in Switzerland; *Another room has its bathroom in France, while the rest of the room is in Switzerland. *The annex to the hotel is located entirely in Switzerland. Today, the Hotel Arbez is operated by the French company SARL Arbez Franco Suisse, which pays taxes equally to both countries. When the French government banned smoking in French pubs and restaurants in 2008, the rule was applied in both the Swiss and French sides of the dining room.

They have been described in retrospect as \\"emblematic of the spirit of the 1960s\\" and an \\"international sensation.\\" At the time they were met with angry protests, particularly from feminists who saw them as an objectification of women. Description Hatstand, Table and Chair are three fibreglass sculptures of women transformed into items of furniture. They are each dressed with wigs, and are naked apart from their corsets, gloves and leather boots. Each is slightly larger than life-size. (Text from The Tate Gallery 1980-82: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London, 1984) For Chair the woman lies curled on her back, a seat cushion on her thighs and her legs acting as a back rest. Table is a woman on all fours, with a sheet of glass supported on her back. For Hat Stand the woman is standing, tall, her hands upturned as hooks. Each fibreglass figure was produced from drawings by Jones. He oversaw a professional sculptor, Dick Beech, who produced the figures in clay. The three female figures were then cast by a model company, Gems Wax Models Ltd, who specialised in producing shop mannequins. Each figure was produced in an edition of six. Jones explained that they weren't illustrations of scenes, but rather that \\"the figure is a device for a painting or a sculpture. It‚Äôs not a portrayal of someone ‚Äì it‚Äôs a psychological construction.\\" Background Allen Jones was one of the first of the 1960s British Pop artists, and produced paintings and prints. A 1968 set of prints, In Life Class, has been cited as an immediate predecessor of his chair, table and hatstand. Each print is made of two halves, the bottom being a pair of women's legs in tights, the upper halves drawn in a 1940s fetishist graphic style, representing \\"the secret face of British male desire in the gloomy post-war years\\". Jones enjoyed combining different visual languages to expose the historical constructions underlying them. He examined the cultural representations of the female body. At the time of his 70th birthday Jones gave an explanation of his motives for creating the sculptures: > \\"I was living in Chelsea and I had an interest in the female figure and the > sexual charge that comes from it. Every Saturday on the King's Road you went > out and skirts were shorter, the body was being displayed in some new way. > And you knew that the following week somebody would up the ante... I was > reflecting on and commenting on exactly the same situation that was the > source of the feminist movement. It was unfortunate for me that I produced > the perfect image for them to show how women were being objectified.\\" Aftermath The sculptures were exhibited in 1970 and met with an outcry from feminists, who objected to women being made into items of furniture. The Guardian newspaper suggested the works should be banned from exhibition. Spare Rib magazine suggested the sculptures showed that Jones was terrified of women. Jones was contacted by film director Stanley Kubrick with a view to creating similar sculptures for his new film, A Clockwork Orange. Jones turned down the request because no payment was offered. However, he gave Kubrick permission to use the idea and sculptures reminiscent of his work in the film's Korova Milk Bar scene. According to art historian and curator, Marco Livingstone, writing in 2004: > \\"More than three decades later, these works still carry a powerful emotive > charge, ensnaring every viewer's psychology and sexual outlook regardless of > age, gender or experience. But a few moments of reflection should make it > obvious that these works are manifestations of fantasy and the imagination, > and that they poke fun at male expectations.\\" The 2008 music video for \\"No Can Do\\" by Sugababes was inspired by Jones' 1970 Chair sculpture, and features the group using men as objects such as cars, motorcycles and bridges. A set of the sculptures was purchased by German playboy, Gunter Sachs, at the time of their release. His set was sold in 2012 at a Sotheby's auction for ¬£2.6 million. In the wake of this, another set came to market in February 2013, selling at Christie's for ¬£2.2 million. 2014 parody In 2014 a reinterpretation of Jones's Chair by Norwegian artist Bjarne Melgaard, using a mannequin of a black woman, created fresh controversy. Images of the chair on the fashion website Buro 24/7 were met with accusations of racism, when they showed a white woman, Dasha Zhukova, sitting on the seat. Melgaard's Chair was part of a collection of sculptures exhibited under the name Allen Jones Remake at the Venus Over Manhattan gallery, New York in 2013.

Previously, he held the John Herr Musser endowed professorship at the Perelman School of Medicine. Wilson is responsible for the death of Jesse Gelsinger. The government banned him from working on FDA-regulated human clinical trials for five years as a result of the Gelsinger case, which led to a shift in his research focus towards a study of adeno-associated viruses (AAV). Scientific contributions Wilson‚Äôs research involves the development of viral-based gene therapies for genetic diseases. A major research focus is the generation of novel vectors for improved transduction efficiencies and regulated expression, as well as the elucidation of host immune responses to viral vectors. His work emphasizes the creation of vectors for in vivo gene therapy concentrating on adeno-associated viruses. This work began with the discovery in his laboratory of a new family of primate AAVs; over 120 new AAV capsids were rescued as latent genomes from primate tissues and studied for their biology and potential as vectors. This has led to an enhanced understanding of vector host interactions and a new generation of vectors with substantially improved performance profiles beyond that provided from the original 6 AAV isolates. More recently, Wilson‚Äôs laboratory has used AAV to accomplish successful in vivo genome editing. As of 2018, his laboratory‚Äôs translational research portfolio included more than 30 orphan disease programs.

This is because the saints were in a state of transcendental, spiritual love, where they were metaphorically women reuniting with their beloved. (In its inversion of the conventional genders of worshipper and worshippee, Maulana Da‚Äôud's Chandayan departs from this tradition.) Literary works in Braj Bhasha Some major literary works in Braj Bhasha are: * Yugala Shataka by Swami Sri Sribhatta Devacarya; known as the first 'Vani' book in Vraja Bhasha composed in the 14th Century AD as a part of Nimbarka Sampradaya tradition of Radha Krishna worship. * Vinaya Patrika by Tulsidas * Sur Sagar by SurdasHindi Literature * Buddha Charit by Acharya Ram Chandra Shukla * Sufi poetry by Amir Khusro * Eulogies by Kavi Bhushan * Vrind Satsai by Vrind (1643 - 1723), court poet of ruler of Kishangarh  See also  * Braj Bhasha References Further reading  * Category:Hindi-language literature Category:Indian literature by language Category:Hindi-language culture Category:Culture of Uttar Pradesh Category:Rajasthani culture Category:Brij ","title":"Braj literature"},{"id":"41834181","text":"Frank Orr (born 1936) is a Canadian sports author and journalist.

The museum is home to the largest documentary collection of Staten Island's African- American culture and history and it may also be home to the only intact 18th -century African cemetery in America. The museum is operated by the Sandy Ground Historical Society and its annual festival is a celebration of black history, culture and freedom. The museum is also chartered by the New York State Department of Education to bring education and awareness of Sandy Ground to adults and children alike through guided tours, exhibits, interactive activities including arts and crafts, and lectures. Sandy Ground reaches about 10,000 people a year in these education initiatives (about 4,000 children and about 6,000 adults.) The museum also preserves artifacts from the early years of the town such as art, quilts, letters, photographs, film and rare books. Town history Within Rossville is Sandy Ground, among the oldest surviving communities in the United States, which was founded by free African Americans prior to the American Civil War, with the first documented land purchase by an African American named Captain John Jackson on February 23, 1828, just months after the abolition of slavery in New York. Sandy Ground was originally called Harrisville, soon being changed to Little Africa before receiving its current name of Sandy Ground for the infertility of the land Several of the community's historic structures are still extant, including five that have been designated as New York City landmarks, including a church, a cemetery, and three homes. Some residents also live in the original community. After slavery in New York was abolished in 1827, freedmen settled in the area known since colonial times as Sandy Ground, which was located in the area around what is now the intersection of Bloomingdale and Woodrow Roads in Rossville. These early settlers were skilled in the oyster trade, and brought this knowledge with them to Staten Island. MAAP (Mapping the African American Past ) talks about the link from Maryland Oyster Workers in the 1800s and Sandy Ground. Oyster harvesting Staten Island was mainly conducted on the island's south shore. Prince's Bay was the main hub and was within walking distance from Sandy Ground. Sandy Ground also served as an important stop on the Underground Railroad, and is the oldest continuously settled free black community in the United States. Oyster farming ended around 1916 due to water pollution in the harbor. The records of the Sandy Ground African Methodist Church go back to 1850.

Early life  Chris Haver was born on Feb. 6, 1966 to Joyce Haver and Ralph Haver II in Phoenix, Arizona. A 3rd generation Phoenician, Chris Haver is the grandson of Ralph Burgess Haver, an architect that made a significant impact in Phoenix with his affordable Haver Home tract housing developments and numerous commercial projects such as the North Phoenix Baptist Church, American Express Regional Headquarters, and the old Phoenix City Hall Complex. Haver was an adventurous child from an early age. At the age of two years, he tried to scale a 50-foot flagpole at a playground near his home. As he grew up, he took a significant interest in sports and went on to become an accomplished skier. Haver attended Brophy College Preparatory, a prestigious all-boys college preparatory in Phoenix. He graduated in 1984.  Notable accomplishments = Seven Summits  While attending SDSU, Haver decided that he wanted to climb and ski the Seven Summits, the tallest mountain on each of the seven continents, before he was 30. He first climbed Mount Everest in 1989 at the age of 23 with the International Goodwill Expedition. While on the expedition, he met Mike McDowell, a founding partner of Quark Expeditions and other adventure travel enterprises. He would go on to become one of Haver's business associates and a close friend. After returning from the Everest trip, Haver broke both of his ankles while jumping off an 80-foot cliff at Tonto Natural Bridge outside of Payson, Arizona. He was aiming for a deep pond, but missed and landed on a rock. After sustaining two compound fractures, Haver required multiple surgeries and 2 ¬Ω years of physical therapy. Haver resumed his quest for the Seven Summits in 1993 by climbing and skiing Mount McKinley in North America. In early 1994, he tackled Africa's Mount Kilimanjaro. Later that year, he conquered Mount Elbrus in European Russia, Australia's Mount Kosciuszko, and Antarctica's Mount Vinson Massif where he sustained frostbite on one of his big toes. He finished the quest in January 1996 in Argentina on Mount Aconcagua approximately two weeks shy of his 30th birthday, becoming the first American to accomplish the feat.  Trip to Titanic  In 1998, Haver planned to join an expedition to the shipwreck of the RMS Titanic with Deep Ocean Exploration. When RMS Titanic heard of the trip, the company obtained a court order that banned Haver and any other party from visiting the site. In 1999, Haver joined Deep Ocean Expeditions and other parties in a suit against RMST for salvager and possession rights. While Haver and the others lost in Federal Court, the case moved onto the 4th Circuit Appellate Court where the judge ruled in their favor. The decision was appealed once again. When the case was presented to the US Supreme Court, the decision from the Appellate Court stood. After the case, Haver joined DOE on an expedition to the shipwreck with Mike McDowell and a pilot, where they had lunch on the bow of the ship. In all, they spent 11 hours diving and photographing the site. Throughout the course of litigating and diving the Titanic, Haver became friends with film director and documentarian James Cameron. Haver went on to found Deep Ocean One (DOO) with Mike Mcdowell, a company that aimed to bring the benefits of deep-sea exploration to the public. In 2007, DOO worked with Cameron's documentary film company to televise and host a live feed with Cameron and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Chris hosted the event in Phoenix while Cameron was on a support ship positioned directly above the Titanic.  Relationship with Gregorio Fuentes  Haver met Gregorio Fuentes, considered by some to be the influence for Hemingway‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Old Man and the Sea,‚Äù with a few of his business associates in Cohimar, Cuba in 1995. After the group traded stories for a few hours, Haver and Fuentes formed a quick friendship. Haver made it a point to see Fuentes and his grandson any time he was in Cuba until his last visit (in 1999) before Fuentes's death in 2002. Famed radio personality Paul Harvey did a segment on his show, ‚ÄúThe Rest of the Story‚Äù which chronicled Chris and his friends finding and meeting Gregorio.  Career = 92 & 95 America‚Äôs Cup  After graduating from college Haver began working with Knight and Carver, a company that owned a marina in Mission Bay of San Diego. In 1991, Haver formed the Mission Bay Organizing Committee (MBOC) to develop facilities for the 1992 and 1995 America's Cup sailing races in San Diego. Because none of the international teams had returned his phone calls or faxes, Haver snuck into the Challenger of Records Dinner hosted by Louis Vuitton at the San Diego Yacht Club to meet the teams face to face. After mingling during the cocktail hour, he sat with the Japanese team because it was the only open seat at the reception dinner. After meeting the team's PR director, Emily Miura, he realized she was the daughter of Yuichiro Miura. The two of them had initially corresponded while Haver was preparing to climb Everest. Yuirchiro was the first person to ski Mt Everest in 1970, and became the first person to climb and ski all of the Seven Summits. The Japanese America's Cup team became the first to join up with Knight & Carver and the MBOC. Ultimately, Haver hosted six of the nine teams including France, Japan, Sweden, Australia, Spain, and the US in Mission Bay. He was responsible for the complete design, construction and facilities management for each of the teams Haver hosted in the 1992 and 1995 America's Cup races.  95 to Present  In 1995 Haver expanded his private equity group to include investments in software, technology, finance and real estate both in the United States and abroad. Since the mid-90s he has been a founding partner and/or principal in 16 companies, many of which are still operating today.  Real Estate Development  Haver has developed real estate, both residential and commercial, in the US and abroad under a number of different banners. * Haver Homes * HHDC (Haver Homes Development Corporation) * Developed land in British Columbia, Canada and Eastern Europe * Haver Williams (Currently holds real estate assets in the US.)

In the end, the group delivered nearly 70 tons of food and medicine via an Antonov An-225 airplane. The group provided valuable supplies and resources to the people of Moscow.

It represents an extreme form of passenger loading, and normally considered to be representative of a system with serious capacity limitations. Crush loads result from too many passengers within a vehicle designed for a much smaller number. Crush loaded trains or buses are so heavily loaded that for most passengers physical contact with several other nearby passengers is impossible to avoid. Definition In the context of transport economics and planning, crush load refers to the maximum level of passenger load for a particular vehicle or rail carriage. Crush loads are calculated for the number of passengers per unit area, standing up. Crush loads are not an issue for passengers that are seated, as passengers will not normally sit on one another. Crush loads are most common on city buses and rail metro systems, where passenger loading is high, and most passengers stand. Airlines almost never have crush loads, nor do high speed and/or long- distance rail or long-distance bus routes, where all passengers are generally seated. Crush loads are normally measured using number of standing passengers per . Six passengers per square metre is often considered the practical limit on what can be accepted without serious discomfort to passengers. However, severe crush loads can be much in excess of this. In India, the term \\"super dense crush load\\" https://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/08/super-dense- crushload/ \\"Super-Dense Crushload\\" has been coined by railway officials to describe passenger loads on peak-hour trains operating on the Mumbai Suburban Railway when carriages built for 200 passengers carry over 500, translating to 14‚Äì16 people per square metre.Bellman, Eric (18 April 2007). \\"Super Dense Crush Load\\". Wall Street Journal. Retrieved 8 February 2014. Effects Crush loads in transport vehicles can result in many secondary issues, such as petty theft and pickpocketing, extreme discomfort for passengers, sexual harassment, and an inability for passengers to board and alight vehicles in a timely manner. For a rail vehicle which has a crush load, passengers are touching and there is no space for another passenger to enter without causing serious discomfort to the passengers on board.Sacramento Regional Transit District. Glossary of Transit Terms. Retrieved 8 February 2014. According to Hoel et al. in Transportation Infrastructure Engineering, operating at crush load increases dwell time (the length of time the transport vehicle remains in the station or stop) and reduces overall vehicle capacity per unit of time.Hoel, Lester; Garber, Nicholas; Sadek, Adel (2010). Transportation Infrastructure Engineering: A Multimodal Integration, SI Version, p. 177. Cengage Learning. Large dense concentrations of passengers can create dangerous conditions, both within transit vehicles and at overcrowded stations. In 2014, a news service in Mumbai, India reported several serious platform gap mutilation incidents and a death within a few months, mostly attributed to crowded conditions.

The last gave her a co-starring role alongside Peter Fonda in 1964 as one of the title characters in The Young Lovers. Other than a single TV guest shot, she had been away from the cameras for nearly a decade, when an attempted return to filmmaking was cut short by a crippling automobile accident in 1977. Early years A native of Los Angeles, Hugueny, born on a leap day, became interested in the arts, particularly acting, in her early teens. She took language and ballet classes, had written a play at age 14, and a year later, in 1959, was attending San Fernando Valley State College as a student in drama. Having co-starred in a staging of Madge Miller's Land of the Dragon, she was seen in Blue Denim, James Leo Herlihy's play about teen pregnancy, by Solly Baiano, the head of Warner Bros. talent department. With her parents' permission, Baiano arranged a meeting with producer-director Delmer Daves, then in the midst of preparing Parrish, a big-budget vehicle for Troy Donahue. Describing her as \\"a lovely little Madonna with black hair and deep blue eyes\\", Daves concluded that she presented the desired appearance and personality to be one of Donahue's romantic conquests in the film, and introduced her to studio head Jack L. Warner, who saw to it that a contract-signing ceremony was ready for February 29, 1960, her 16th birthday. Warner Bros. contractee 1960 was a very busy year for Warner Bros., which had a large roster of contract performers appearing in an assembly-line-style mass production of TV episodes and theatrical features. In the eight-year period between 1955 and 1963, Warner Bros. Television provided the ABC network with 19 shows, including eight western and four detective series. Hugueny was enrolled in the studio's school to continue her education and immediately was put to work, appearing over the next two years in 12 installments of six Warners' series as well as playing supporting roles in two features. During this period, her career was sidelined by a brief marriage to Warners contractee Robert Evans and a move with him to New York City. Her TV acting debut came on May 4, 1960, a little over two months after the contract signing, in the episode \\"Shadow of the Blade\\", broadcast near the end of the first season of the popular detective series Hawaiian Eye, which gave her top billing among the guest cast, with her second appearance coming three weeks later, on the 24th, playing an Indian maiden named Running Deer in \\"Attack\\", one of the later installments of the half-hour western, Colt .45. In June and July, she was on location in the tobacco fields of Connecticut as well as in Hartford and at the submarine base in New London, Connecticut, alongside the cast and crew of Parrish, with filming completed on July 24. On October 14, she was seen in \\"The Wide Screen Caper\\" episode of 77 Sunset Strip, playing an up-and-coming starlet named Sprite Simpson, and a month later, portrayed Native American girl Chantay\\", the title character in the November 13 segment of the western series Lawman. Her last 1960 TV appearance was as Irish lass Deidre Fogarty whose sympathies lay with \\"The Bold Fenian Men\\", the December 18 episode of Maverick. The plot arranged still another romantic character pairing for her, with episode star Roger Moore in the role of cousin Beau Maverick. Employing a distinctive Irish accent, Hugueny received a substantial amount of screen time punctuated by several closeups. At about the same time, a brief news item publicized that \\"[S]ixteen-year-old Sharon Hugueny who makes her film debut with Troy Donahue in Warners' \\"Parrish,\\" has already written her autobiography‚Äîa by-line piece which will be published in the January issue of the General Motors Corporation magazine. 1961 was a tumultuous year for her ‚Äî in addition to appearing in another four episodes as well as a major feature film, she married Robert Evans in May, went with him to New York, thus effectively being suspended from her Warners contract, then divorced him in November and returned to Hollywood. Her first series episode, \\"A Touch of Velvet\\", was broadcast January 11, in the middle of Hawaiian Eye's second season, and provided her with the heavily dramatic role of blind girl Ellie Collins who helps one of the show's detectives, Tracy Steele (Anthony Eisley), catch a killer and, in the process, develops feelings for him. On March 3, she was in the \\"Tiger by the Tail\\" installment of 77 Sunset Strip, playing Sari, the daughter of a visiting Middle Eastern prince. Her last 1961 episodes, April 16 and 23, representing a two-part story on Maverick, \\"The Devil's Necklace\\", cast her as Indian girl Tawny, who falls in love with that episode's Maverick, Bart Maverick (Jack Kelly), repeating to him the phrase \\"me friend\\". Major role in Parrish Sharon Hugueny with her first husband Robert Evans, 1961 Sharon Hugueny photographed by Frank Bez, 1961 The following month brought big changes for Hugueny ‚Äî May 4 was the release date for the studio's 2 hour-18 minute multi- star Technicolor production Parrish, in which she is seventh-billed, playing Paige, the daughter of tobacco farm tycoon Karl Malden. The brunette Paige competes for and wins the heart of Troy Donahue's title character against two blondes, Hawaiian Eye regular Connie Stevens and Surfside 6 regular Diane McBain. The three young actresses had major supporting roles, and in the film's publicity releases, were described as co-stars. The film, budgeted at $1,500,000, was a major hit, bringing in $4,200,000 in U.S. rentals alone, but the critics were dismissive; Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote: \\"Sharon Hugueny as the farmer's daughter who grows up to be sublimely marriageable...in the slick fiction tradition\\" and criticizing the film as \\"synthetic\\" and \\"artificial\\" and of its characters that \\"[N]ot one of them is representative of credible humanity\\". Marriage to Robert Evans In his 1994 autobiography The Kid Stays in the Picture, Robert Evans describes how he met Sharon Hugueny on the set of Parrish where \\"she was Warner Brothers' entry as the next Elizabeth Taylor\\" while \\"being protected as if she were the Hope diamond\\" and \\"so pure I felt guilty kissing her\\". In May 1961, Evans asked her to marry him, hoping, as he recounts in the autobiography, that his mother, who was dying of cancer, would see him as potentially becoming, aged nearly 31, a responsible family man. Hugueny, however, was barely three months past her 17th birthday and \\"[T]his beautiful, genteel innocent not only was a virgin when I married her, but had never been on a date\\". The May wedding took place \\"on the grounds of a romantic carriage house on La Colina in Beverly Hills. All my family were there, along with a host of friends‚ÄîCary Grant, Elizabeth Taylor and Eddie Fisher, Natalie and R.J., Felicia and Jack Lemmon, Anne and Kirk Douglas, and more\\". Shortly after the wedding, Evans decided to give up his acting career and returned to New York so that he could be near his mother and to help manage the women's fashion house Evan-Picone. Referring to Hugueny as \\"my child bride\\", he recounts a panic attack she suffered on Manhattan's Lexington Avenue and her call to his office from a phone booth, \\"[C]hildlike, 'I don't know where I am'.\\" He writes \\"What had I been thinking, bringing this child to New York? It was like setting a Persian cat loose in the Amazon.\\" Describing her as a \\"fragile flower\\", he explained that he \\"couldn't stand by and watch her be hurt anymore. It was unfair to her. Listening like a child, she understood.\\" A \\"quickie divorce\\" in Mexico ended the marriage in November, but it would not be until June 1964 that the final property settlement was signed, and until July, when the divorce became final on the grounds that Evans \\"was never home\\". Return to Hollywood Back in Hollywood shortly before her 18th birthday, Hugueny was photographed attending Bob Ender's twist party with Richard Chamberlain, but found that leaving for New York and putting her contract with Warner Bros. on hold, had damaged her career prospects. A prominent supporting role in the two-hour, 36-minute Technicolor film version of Leonard Spigelgass' hit Broadway comedy-drama, A Majority of One, which she had been completing at the time of her departure, was edited to little more than a cameo, with eighth billing in the cast list.A Majority of One production details at IMDb After three more guest-starring roles in Warner shows, filmed in the first months of 1962, Hugueny's time with the studio was done. A news item noted that she was taking driving lessons, instead of having no other choice but to live within a walking distance of the studio entrance. The first of her 1962 shows was a third appearance on 77 Sunset Strip, in the episode \\"Twice Dead\\", which cast her as the daughter of Margaret Hayes and did not provide her character with a love interest. Two months later, her third appearance on Hawaiian Eye, in the episode \\"Rx Cricket\\", which focused on Connie Stevens' title character, left Hugueny competing for attention among a number of other guest stars. Finally, the pilot for The Gallant Men, directed in March by Robert Altman and broadcast on October 5, after her departure from the studio, gave her a couple of brief atmospheric scenes as Rosa. In the final scene, upon mention of her name in the aftermath of battle, the audience, but not the show's regular characters, is implicitly made aware of her ultimately tragic fate by the camera panning to a nearby pile of rubble, where a cross hanging from a ribbon, which had been prominently seen earlier around her neck, was barely perceptible amidst the destruction of war. Freelancing after Warner Bros. Now at liberty, she received two additional job offers that year, a guest shot on the \\"Operation Arrivederci\\" episode of Ensign O'Toole, which spotlighted her as an Italian girl attracted to the title character (played by Dean Jones), and a heavily dramatic part as a mental patient in the independently produced The Caretakers, released on August 21, 1963. In an interview conducted over 40 years later, supporting actor Van Williams recalled the troubled production, produced, directed and co-written by Hall Bartlett and starring Jeffrey Hunter as a progressive doctor at a psychiatric clinic. After running out of funds the production was halted, and the leading man replaced by Robert Stack who put up the financing from his earnings on The Untouchables. In addition to Williams, the cast included another familiar Warner's contractee from Surfside 6 as well as from Parrish, Diane McBain, playing a psychiatric nurse. Billed eighth in the opening credits and eleventh in closing credits, Hugueny was Connie, whose personality is childlike, and who hears imaginary voices and has visions of becoming \\"free like a daisy\\". Most of the critical notices did little more than mention the character. The next time she was seen on-screen occurred on May 20, 1964 in \\"The Mismatch Maker\\" episode of The Farmer's Daughter. She played Maria Cortez, the daughter a South American ambassador, who develops a crush on the show's congressman, played by William Windom, with the sensible title character Katie (Inger Stevens), diplomatically resolving the situation by introducing her to another congressman's handsome son (Yale Summers). At the end of the year, with release of her fourth and final feature film, The Young Lovers, she received second billing, after Peter Fonda. Producer Samuel Goldwyn Jr., in his sole outing as a director, conducted a seven-month search to find the appropriate young lead opposite Fonda, with the proviso that in addition to having \\"training and dedication\\", she must be \\"an actress, not a starlet\\". The highly dramatic story of two unmarried college students, Eddie and Pam, faced with an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy provided numerous opportunities for heated confrontations and provocative (for 1964) contemplation of abortion. A number of critics commended Hugueny on her acting skills, but few had more than tepid words for the film. Only 20 years old at the time of the film's release, Hugueny was approaching the end of her career. Her only work in 1965 was \\"This Town for Sale\\", the November 15 episode of Run for Your Life, and in 1966, as college student Eliza in \\"The Ten Letterman\\" in Hank. Also in February, gossip columns reported that she was dating 34-year-old Night of the Iguana actor James \\"Skip\\" Ward. Two marriages, motherhood and auto accident In April 1968, at the age of 24, Sharon Hugueny was married in Santa Barbara, California to 21-year-old freelance photographer Raymond A. Ross, and in December, they become parents of a son. The marriage ended in 1974, but sources are unclear whether she was divorcedSharon Hugueny biographical details at IMDb or widowed. Five months into her marriage, she was seen in a one-minute guest shot on the September 18, 1968 episode of Peyton Place, playing Donna Franklin, a glamorous and sophisticated mystery woman. Despite the brevity of her role and billing at the bottom of the episode's cast list, the character was mentioned in a few subsequent installments of the serial and seemed to have a potential of becoming a semi-regular, but did not appear again, other than for a fleeting, unbilled, sighting in the December 11 episode. Hugueny's impending motherhood that month may have contributed in putting an end to any future plans of developing the Donna Franklin story. After a passage of six years, in the last days of 1974, the year of her divorce/widowhood, she made one final appearance in front of the cameras, as a guest star in \\"Choice of Victims\\" on Mannix. Less than two years later, on April 16, 1976, Hugueny, age 32, married Gordon Cornell Layne, 45-year-old writer and founder of Mid America Pictures. The following year, deciding to return to acting, she acquired new management and was en route to sign performing contracts when she was badly injured by a police vehicle engaged in a high-speed pursuit. Attended by her husband at their home in Lake Arrowhead, California, she partially recovered and lived for 19 more years until succumbing to cancer at age 52.

He served as the bishop of the Diocese of Sokoto in Nigeria from 1967-1984. Early life and education James Edward Dempsey was born in Providence, Rhode Island, to Joseph M. Demspey and Julia Mary McSherry. He was educated at St. Mary's Grade School, LaSalle Academy and Providence College all in Providence. Dempsey entered the Dominican novitiate at St. Rose Priory in Springfield, Kentucky, and took the religious name Michael. He made his first profession of vows on August 16, 1936. Philosophical studies were taken at the Dominican House of Studies in River Forest, Illinois, and Dempsey made his solemn profession on August 16, 1939. He decided to join the newly established Province of St. Albert the Great and continued his theological studies at River Forest. Dempsey was ordained a priest by Bishop Bernard J. Sheil on June 11, 1942. Priesthood Michael Dempsey taught English and religion at Fenwick High School in Oak Park, Illinois, from 1943 to 1950. At the same time he obtained a master's degree in English literature at DePaul University in Chicago. In 1951 he entered the missionary field in Nigeria. He served five terms as pastor and local superior at St. Dominic's Parish in Yaba, Lagos. He was on leave from January 24, 1955, to February 2, 1956. When he returned he was made the Vicar Provincial for the Dominicans of Nigeria. His responsibilities were reduced to Yaba from 1959 to 1962. On August 27, 1965, Dempsey was appointed the vicar of the Nigerian Vicariate. Bishop of Sokoto On July 13, 1967, Pope Paul VI appointed him as the Bishop of Sokoto. He was consecrated a bishop by Cardinal John Cody of Chicago on August 15, 1967, at St. Pius V Church in Chicago. The principal co-consecrators were Archbishop John Kwao Amuzu Aggey of Lagos and Chicago auxiliary bishop Aloysius John Wycislo. He was installed as the diocesan bishop in Sokoto on October 1, 1967, and continued to serve there until his resignation was accepted by Pope John Paul II on December 3, 1984. Prior to his appointment as bishop there were anti-Igbo and anti-Christian riots in 1966 that left the diocese of Sokoto without most of its people, its only indigenous priest fled, and many of its church buildings were destroyed. He focused on the northern part of his diocese where the people remained, and opened the first secondary school in Gusau in 1968. The civil war ended in 1970 and the Catholic people began to return to the Sokoto diocese. The oil industry expanded in the 1970s and that helped to increase the size of the diocese. The Dominican sisters opened a house in Gusau. The catechetical school at Malumfashi trained catechists for northern Nigeria. Successful evangelization efforts were made among the Hausa people. Good relations were maintained with Muslims and other Christian churches. Dempsey suffered several minor strokes toward the end of his time as bishop. He was also the only non- Nigerian bishop in the country. He had to check in and out with the police when he left Sokoto State to enter Katsina State, which was also a part the diocese. Later life and death In the autumn of 1985 Dempsey returned to the United States. He took up residence at St. Dominic Priory in Denver, Colorado, and helped out at St. Dominic parish where he ministered to the sick and aged. His health declined and he moved into the Mullen Home, which was operated by the Little Sisters of the Poor in Denver. He died there at the age of 84 on March 19, 1996. Archbishop J. Francis Stafford of Denver celebrated the funeral on March 25, 1996, at St. Dominic's Church. Bishop Dempsey was buried in the Dominican plot at Mount Olivet Cemetery.

Van Buren St. in Marion, is the former county jail serving Williamson County, Illinois. The Prairie School building served as the county jail from 1913 to 1971. The jail housed prisoners involved with three violent conflicts in the 1920s: the Herrin massacre, the Klan War, and a gang rivalry between the Shelton Brothers Gang and Charles Birger's gang. The building is now a history museum and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The jail was built in 1913 to replace the county's previous jail, which suffered from flooding, overcrowding, and poor living conditions. It soon played a central role in a number of conflicts which engulfed Williamson County in the 1920s, giving the county the nickname \\"Bloody Williamson\\". In 1922, the jail housed the men arrested for their role in the Herrin massacre, a deadly riot between union and non-union coal miners. Of the 125 men originally indicted after the massacre, only five were tried before their release; a pro-union jury found these five men not guilty of murder. The riot and trial brought national attention to the county, leading President Warren Harding to refer to the massacre as \\"shocking\\", \\"shameful\\", and \\"butchery\\". A grand jury later indicted 214 defendants, eight of whom were held without bail at the jail; these men were provided with meals and entertainment by union supporters during their time at the jail. Later in the 1920s, the jail became part of another conflict when the Ku Klux Klan assumed control of the Marion Law Enforcement League and hired S. Glenn Young to conduct violent raids on bootleggers. Young's actions were divisive and sparked violence among Williamson County residents in a conflict which became known as the Klan War. The conflict escalated until state troopers were called to the jail to stabilize the county and protect the prisoners from lynch mobs. The war ended when Young and Deputy Sheriff Ora Thomas killed each other in a shootout. The jail played a role in yet another conflict in the 1920s when a gang war arose between the Shelton Brothers Gang and Charles Birger's gang. The gangs, led by rival bootleggers, became notorious for exchanging murders. The majority of the members of both gangs spent time in the Williamson County Jail; fourteen members of the Shelton Brothers received life sentences for murder, and Rado Millich of Birger's gang became the last man to be hanged in Williamson County in 1927. Birger only spent a single night in the jail; after being arrested for murder, he was released after claiming he acted in self-defense, a claim which kept him out of the jail on two other occasions as well. The jail closed in 1971, and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 30, 2007. Williamson County Museum The building is now owned by the Williamson County Illinois Historical Society and operated as the Williamson County Museum. Several rooms have been restored to a Victorian-era period, and other rooms feature historic small businesses, military and clothing displays, a schoolroom and the original jail cells. There is also a genealogical and historical research library. Architecture The architectural firm of N. S. Spencer and Temple designed the building in the Prairie School style. The three-story building was built with brick and stone. The building's design features an emphasis on horizontal lines, a low roof with an overhanging cornice, and an art glass transom and sidelights around the front entrance, all characteristic Prairie School elements. The jail was capable of housing 87 inmates, including 81 men and 6 women. The building also included the county sheriff's residence, which was separated from the jail by of concrete and two steel doors. A verandah over the jail's front porch was accessible from the sheriff's residence; the verandah was also used by armed guards during the Klan War.

It was the third powered aircraft designed by pioneering Romanian aviator Aurel Vlaicu. Design and development Engineer and inventor Aurel Vlaicu, who was among the first pilots in Romania, began the design of the third in his series of powered aircraft in the second half of 1911. The design was based on his earlier A Vlaicu II. A nacelle underneath a parasol wing housed the pilot and a Gnome Gamma engine. Gears, chains and shafts drove two propellers, one in front of and one behind the wing; these turned in opposite directions to cancel each other's torque. Like Vlaicu's other designs, the A. Vlaicu III did not have ailerons. The pilot turned the aircraft by using the rudder, controlled by moving a tiller left or right; to control the elevators and make the aircraft go up and down, a steering wheel attached to the tiller was turned left or right. It was the world's first metal-built aircraft.Jozef Wilczynski, Technology in Comecon: Acceleration of Technological Progress Through Economic Planning and the Market, p. 243 At the time of Vlaicu's death in the crash of the A Vlaicu II in 1913, two A. Vlaicu IIIs were under construction for delivery to the Marconi Company. The British company was supposed to receive one for performance evaluation and experimentation with aerial radio, the other was supposed to remain in Romania. After Vlaicu's death, one of the two aircraft was completed by his friends Giovanni Magnani and Constantin Silisteanu; and was ready to fly in May 1914. Operational history Two test 'hops' covering a ground distance of 200‚Äì300 metres (220-330 yards) at a maximum altitude of about were made in 1914 by pilot Petre Macavei at Cotroceni airfield. Military authorities of the time refused permission to continue the tests. At a later date, pilots Mircea Zorileanu and Gheorghe Negrescu obtained permission from the Romanian Minister of War to modify the controls of the aircraft and continue the experiments, but it never flew again. In 1916, during the German occupation of Bucharest, an A Vlaicu III was seized and shipped to Germany. It was last seen in 1942 at an aviation exhibition in Berlin by Romanian military officers. However, no mention of it is made in records of the Berlin exhibition.Hundertmark & Steinle (1985), pp.110-114Gheorghiu, Constantin C. (1960). Aurel Vlaicu, un precursor al avia≈£iei rom√¢ne≈üti.

The feature film debut of director √Åd√°m Cs√°szi, the film had its debut at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival. The film stars Andr√°s S√ºt≈ë as Szabolcs, a young man who returns home to Hungary after quitting his budding football career in Germany, and begins a romantic and sexual relationship with √Åron (√Åd√°m Varga), an apprentice stonemason from a nearby town. The situation is complicated when Bernard (Sebastian Urzendowsky), Szabolcs' former roommate in Germany, arrives to convince him to return to football training. Plot Szabolcs (Andr√°s S√ºt≈ë), a talented but passionless football player in an amateur German team, mangles a match and is sent off with a red card. As a result, a league scout leaves, he picks a fight with his best friend Bernard (Sebastian Urzendowsky) and quits the team. He returns to a dilapidated family home in rural Hungary to farm bees instead. One night, he catches √Åron (√Åd√°m Varga), a local from the nearby village who lives with and cares for his invalid mother, attempting to steal his scooter. He knocks √Åron off, knocking him out in the process, and stays with him until he wakes. Instead of calling the police, Szabolcs has √Åron help repair the house. They become friends and Szabolcs joins the locals playing football. One night, after going swimming and drinking too much, they lie on the road and Szabolcs gives a barely-conscious √Åron a handjob. √Åron is clearly confused about how he feels about the encounter. Despite this, he keeps returning to help Szabolcs with the house and their relationship deepens. Eventually, √Åron tells his mother about Szabolcs, who in turn tells others, raising the ire of the conservative community. After some of the villagers beat Szabolcs during a football game and √Åron refuses to stand up for him, Szabolcs calls Bernard. Though √Åron soon returns to him, Bernard also arrives in Hungary, creating tension. Bernard expresses an interest in a relationship with Szabolcs and tries to convince him to return to Germany to play football. Eventually the community sentiment turns against √Åron as well. After he is also assaulted by his friends and criticized by his mother, he moves in with Szabolcs. He and Bernard compete for Szabolcs' attention. Eventually Szabolcs chooses to stay in Hungary with √Åron, and Bernard returns to Germany. √Åron returns home to find his mother near death after he was not there to take care of her. He takes her to hospital where she remains in a coma. Unable to deal with the guilt of not being there for her, combined with the animosity of the villagers, he returns to Szabolcs. After a final sexual encounter, he mortally stabs Szabolcs in the chest and flees the farmhouse.

The site was occupied from the Early Archaic period to the Late Woodland period. The site includes two zones, both of which contain extensive midden deposits. Burials were also conducted at the site, and human remains have been recovered from both zones. The site was discovered in 1972 during construction work at the base; formal excavations at the site began the following year. Research by the University of Louisville concluded that KYANG was part of the \\"Old Clarksville Phase\\", a group of Middle Archaic sites straddling the Ohio River in the vicinity of the Falls of the Ohio, dated circa 6000-4400 BC, including a prehistoric component at the Old Clarksville Site.Jefferies, Richard W. Holocene Hunter-Gatherers of the Lower Ohio River Valley. Tuscaloosa: U of Alabama P, 2009. It is also included in the later Lone Hill Phase, circa 4400-3200, a group of sites all located in Jefferson County. Extensive deposits of bone from the Middle Archaic period are present in KYANG's large midden, preserved by its highly alkaline soil, and their high degree of preservation facilitated a comprehensive study of local Middle Archaic bone-working toolmaking technology in 1992. Extensive burials at the site, together with the large midden, testify to its long period of use. A large mussel-shell layer atop the midden appears to indicate that the inhabitants used it as a processing spot for river mussels, while the site's bones appear to indicate that their diet was otherwise based on small mammals and deer. Conversely, no evidence of cold- weather occupation is present, suggesting that all occupations were seasonal. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 12, 1972. The boundaries of the National Register listing were decreased in 1990.

At the time of description P. tuberculatus was one of two Pseudarmadillo species known from the fossil record and one of only two from Hispaniola. History and classification P. tuberculatus is known from four isopods, both female and male, all of which are inclusions in three different transparent chunks of Dominican amber. Two of the paratypes are fossils in the same amber specimen while the other two individuals are both in separate amber specimens. The amber specimens which entomb the holotype and paratypes, are currently preserved in the Division of Invertebrate Zoology collections at the Staatliches Museum f√ºr Naturkunde Stuttgart in Stuttgart, Germany. The type specimens were collected from an undetermined amber mine, in fossil bearing rocks of the Cordillera Septentrional mountains, northern Dominican Republic. The amber was produced by resin from the extinct tree Hymenaea protera, which formerly grew on Hispaniola, across northern South America and up to southern Mexico. The amber dates from at least the Burdigalian stage of the Miocene, based on studying the associated fossil foraminifera and may be as old as the Middle Eocene, based on the associated fossil coccoliths. This age range is due to the host rock being secondary deposits for the amber, and the Miocene the age range is only the youngest that it might be. The fossil isopods were first studied by paleontologist Helmut Schmalfuss of the Staatliches Museum f√ºr Naturkunde Stuttgart. Schmalfuss's 1984 type description of the new species was published in the journal Stuttgarter Beitr√§ge zur Naturkunde. Serie B (Geologie und Pal√§ontologie) and no explanation of the specific epithet tuberculatus was given. P. tuberculatus is one of the first two species of Pseudarmadillo described from the fossil record, the other species being Pseudarmadillo cristatus. Both are known only from Dominican amber and were described in the same 1984 paper.  Description  The Pseudarmadillo tuberculatus specimens are moderately well preserved, though since isopods lack the wax coatings found in insects, they show deterioration and distortion from the resin after entombment. The species has an estimated adult body length of up to approximately and a width of . In contrast to P. cristatus which has two ribs running the length of the body on each side, only one rib is on each side of P. tuberculatus. While both species have two rows of bumps running the width of the body between the ribs on each body segment, the front row of bumps is eleven across and the posterior row is ten across in P. tuberculatus rather the row and five and four in P. cristatus. The cephalon has notably enlarged antennal lobes that served to shelter the antenna when an individual curled into a defensive ball. The compound eyes of the species are composed five ommatidia.

The film was released on 18 January 1999 through Full Moon Features and was followed by a 2011 sequel, Killer Eye: Halloween Haunt. It stars Jonathan Norman as a mad scientist that unwittingly unleashes a killer eyeball upon the world. Plot Dr. Jordan Grady (Jonathan Norman) hires a kid off the street, Japlo (Ryan Van Steenis), to participate in an experiment. He administers special eye drops to Japlo in an attempt to allow him to see into the eighth dimension. During the test, Jordan is confronted by his wife Rita (Jacqueline Lovell) about his neglect of her and while he is away, Japlo's eye is possessed by a creature from the eighth dimension, killing him. Rita goes next door to have sex with her neighbors, Joe (Roland Martinez) and Tom (Dave Oren Ward), while Jordan finds Japlo's body. Jordan demands that his employee Morton (Costas Koromilas) help him, ruining Morton's date with his wife Jane (Nanette Bianchi). Japlo's eye has morphed into a massive monster that rapes Rita and Jane. Jordan and Morton put Japlo's body in the attic, and the body is found by Jordan's other employee Bill (Blake Adams). Jordan and Morton hunt for the eye, and both Morton and Jane are hypnotized by the eye. However, Morton accidentally shines a light into the eye; it is injured and runs away. Jordan, Rita, Bill, and Morton regroup and realize that light hurts the eye. Jordan hypothesizes that because the monster has been deprived of brain matter, the eye requires regular contact with a brain, which explains the victims' wounds. He also states that the eye could be harmed by shining bright light into it, just like a normal- sized human eye. However, the eye possesses Joe and causes him to sexually assault Jane, but he suddenly dies due to having his brain matter drained by the eye. The building's lights go off due to a power outage, so the group turns on a backup generator to power lights in their efforts against the eye. The eye attacks Rita when she gets separated from the others. Jordan appears, revealing that he wants to help the eye because it is advanced and intelligent. Rita manages to escape before she can be consumed, but Tom and Bill are murdered by the eye. Morton is able to trap the eye and forces it to go back home, but Jordan follows it back to the eighth dimension. Rita, Morton, and Jane think they are safe, but Rita and Jane feel sudden abdominal pain, implying that they were impregnated by the eye and ending the film on a cliffhanger.

Description The approximately high, long, and wide beeswax sculpture is believed to be a maquette for a full size bronze sculpture. The model used to cast the sculpture sustained damage, resulting in the sucuplture suffering the loss of the horse's front-left leg along with the rider's feet and hands. According to professor Ernesto Solari, curator of a 2016 exhibition of the sculpture, it is innovative, far removed from the classical models the young Leonardo had been familiar with during his time with Andrea del Verrocchio; particularly when Verrocchio was working on the Equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni. Solari's interpretation of marks on the statuette includes a signature, a date and a fingerprint, which he assumes to be Leonardo's. Historian hypothesizes that \\"this is a funeral monument. There are several clues that lead to this interpretation; the horse is portrayed disarranging the rider to indicate that the animal is frightened. It is going down to the underworld, while the knight Charles d‚ÄôAmboise, on the other hand is portrayed in a serene mood and eyes closed, the hand on his heart; the Governor of Milan is parting from his loved ones. Finally, one can notice the thigh protector in the shape of a shell, a symbol of travel, in this case without return.\\" History The pre-20th century history of Horse and Rider has not been established; the first sources mentioning the statue are attributed to the Giorgio Sangiorgi (1886‚Äì1960) collection in Rome, which had recorded the beeswax sculpture as previously owned by a member of the Melzi di Cusano family in Milan. An unnamed art collector moved the sculpture from Italy in the early 1920s, and by 1938 it was in Switzerland. Italian art historian Carlo Pedretti discovered the existence of the wax model in the late 1970s, and took black and white photos of it - Pedrettri would later attribute the model to da Vinci. When compiling a 1987 catalogue raisonn√© of Leonardo's drawings stored in the Royal Collection in Windsor Castle, Pedretti added some of his photos for comparison. David Nickerson, director of the Mallett at Bourdon House in London, acquired the wax model in 1985. It was presented to a group of American businessmen in 1985. As it was continuing to degrade, they had a latex mold made to preserve its condition. Their intention was to market a limited edition of bronze castings, which didn't happen until 25 years later. The beeswax sculpture was displayed around the world in the 1990s as part of a travelling exhibition named \\"Leonardo da Vinci: Scientist, Inventor, Artist\\" in Sweden in Stockholm, Malm√∂ and G√∂teborg in 1995, Vienna in 1996, and in Boston and Singapore in 1997. Due to its fragility, it now remains in a temperature-controlled private collection in London.  Da Vinci provenance  According to Pedretti's attribution, the history of the sculpture is directly tied to da Vinci. In 1506 Charles II d'Amboise summoned Leonardo to return to Milan from Florence. D'Amboise commissioned Leonardo to design the gardens for his suburban villa. At this time Leonardo began to develop the concept of an equestrian portrait of his patron, Charles d'Amboise. Leonardo is known to have used wax models to study the compositions of his paintings, as noted by Benvenuto Cellini in reference to the paintings in Milan and Florence. Upon Leonardo's death in 1519 his unfinished works, drawings and notebooks were inherited by Francesco Melzi, Leonardo's friend and prot√©g√©. The documents of the Melzi d'Eril family, who own Francesco's still existing Villa Melzi in Vaprio d'Adda, don't however have a record of this wax sculpture. The 1985 mold made directly of the beeswax model showing the \\"pulled\\" red wax. Attribution The sculpture was attributed to Leonardo da Vinci by art historian Carlo Pedretti in 1985, mainly due to a note Leonardo had written for himself in another work. On a c.1503-1504 worksheet from the Codex Windsor set of Leonardo's drawings are sketches of horses, believed to be part of a study for the painting of The Battle of Anghiari. In the middle of the sheet is a note to \\"make one of wax about finger long\\", c.1503-1504 and the bucking posture of one of the horses is similar to the sculpture. Leonardo may indeed have used wax models to prepare for Anghiari. Art historian Patricia Trutty-Coohill also noticed a resemblance between the rider and Charles II d'Amboise from Andrea Solari's painting from c.1507. Charles was one of Leonardo's patrons, and the subject matter would suit what's known of him. The beeswax statuette, including black and white photographs, was first published as a work by Leonardo in 1987 in \\"The drawings and miscellaneous papers of Leonardo da Vinci\\" in The collection of Her Majesty the Queen at Windsor Castle. The book was part of a series that Pedretti had taken over from Kenneth Clark, cataloging Leonardo's drawings stored in the Royal Collection in Windsor Castle. Most art historians have made no comment on the work, and Pedretti's attribution has been criticized over the years. After examining the model, art historian Martin Kemp stated that \\"it has none of the characteristics of understanding horse anatomy and renaissance armor that you would expect from Leonardo\\". Art history professor Francesco Caglioti dates the sculpture to the late 19th century as a revivalistic work. When exhibited at the Boston Museum of Science in 1997, the museum agreed to change the credit on the label of the sculpture from \\"by Leonardo\\" to \\"attributed to Leonardo\\", but art historian Jack Wasserman still insisted that nothing has survived to support the attribution. Art historians Pietro Marani and Franco Cardini, and art critic Vittorio Sgarbi, likewise doubted the sculpture's provenance when the bronze cast was exhibited in Milan in 2016, commenting that there still isn't adequate hard evidence to support the attribution of the work to Leonardo, and that Pedretti and Solari are often too generous with their attributions. Following his studies of medieval cavalry, Cardini also criticised the historical accuracy of the sculpture. Bronze sculpture 2012 bronze casting of Horse and Rider In 1987 art collector Richard A. Lewis acquired the 1985 latex mold. Beginning in 2012, Lewis and a team of experts \\"pulled\\" a wax from the latex mold and, using the lost wax process, cast the Horse and Rider sculpture in bronze. Bronze castings were sold with a certificate of authenticity stating each to be one of 996 castings, which were available in three different applied patinas and in silver. They were at sale for $25,000‚Äì35,000 each. The plan to cast up to 1000 statues however never reached fruition, and the art gallery fulfilling orders sold around 70 replicas. Some of the replicas have since been for sale with the option of joint ownership to the 2012 bronze cast. The 2012 bronze casting was unveiled to the public in August 2012 at Grey Stone Mansion in Beverly Hills, California. It has been exhibited in Las Vegas, Dallas, San Diego, and in 2016 in Milan. In 2015 the mold made of Leonardo's beeswax model, together with the 2012 bronze casting, were acquired by another private collector. Since then, further bronze castings have been exhibited in New York, London,Miami, and Oregon. The latex mold and one of the bronzes is up for no-reserve auction in October 2019 at Guernsey's. The promoters appraised them somewhere between $30 and $50 million. In an auction on 30 October 2019, the sculpture failed to find a buyer, and the price was dropped to $10 million. A Bloomberg article described the auction as a \\"flop\\".

C. M. Paine is an award-winning book published in 2012 by Cambridge University Press. The work presents a view of three \\"nested wars\\" in early twentieth century East Asia, seen as distinct conflicts which, while carried on simultaneously, had their own welter of cause and dynamic: the Chinese Civil War 1911-1949; the Second Sino-Japanese War 1931-1945; the Second World War 1941-1945. Content summary The principal participants discussed here were Japan, China, and Russia. The first part of Paine's work describes each in terms of their political-economic stance and condition, and their different war aims and strategies. Mention is also made of Germany and the United States. Concerning Japan during this era, its Kwantung Army in 1931 with regard to Manchuria made crucial decisions independently of the central government in Tokyo. Several assassinations of civilian politicians followed; in the end, the army's expansionists policies prevailed. In China a fragile republic which lacked country-wide authority had been founded by Sun Yat-sen. In the late 1920s under Chiang Kai-shek the republic became a national power in China, but unity in the chain of command eluded its government; it remained a shifting coalition of warlords. In 1917 the Bolsheviks had seized power in Russia. The Soviet government inherited the expansionist policies of the Czars, yet, Paine argues, duplicitously managed to project a benign international image sustained by the allure of its then novel party ideology.Paine, The Wars for Asia 1911-1949 (2012). Part I, pp. 1-105: \\"Japan 1931-1936\\" pp. 13-47, at 15-17, 22 (Kwantung Army), 35 (technical success, but bitter enemies made), 45-47 (Army leads the government), cf., 116-118, 119-120 (Japan's impossible war in China); \\"China 1926-1936\\" pp. 48-76, at 57-58 (Sun Yat-sen), 64-65 (Chiang's victory in Northern Expedition), 69, 70 (coalition of warlords); \\"Russia 1917-1936\\" pp. 77-105, at 78-79 (Bolsheviks), 83, 84-86 (Soviets as heirs to the Czarist policies), 98, 102-104 (Soviets facilitate Second United Front against Japan). In her second and longer part, Paine gives a chronological narrative of the events of the three wars. After a review of the early years of the Civil War, she picks up the thread in 1937 with the military history, while touching regularly on political matters, fiscal policy, and the world context. Paine situates the long Chinese Civil War in terms of a dynastic interregnum, which are recurrent in Chinese history. Normatively the passage between eras involves a transformative armed struggle for sovereign power between rivals. The Qing dynasty, whose Manchu rulers were in decline, fell in 1911. During the disorder and chaos caused by the ensuing violent struggle among the Chinese, the armies of Imperial Japan, already established in \\"Manchukuo\\", in 1931 launched a further invasion of China. This attack sparked Chinese nationalism and hatred of the Japanese. This Sino-Japanese war eventually spread across China and beyond, creating a regional war. According to Paine, in this contest Japan's chief target remained throughout the Chinese Republic. Consequently this regional conflict tipped the balance in the preexisting civil war in favor of the insurgent Communist Party of China under Mao Zedong, despite Japan's continually reiterated state policy of hostility to communism. Paine writes that during the 1920s Soviet Russia had recognized the importance of China, and understood that its interests required political, diplomatic, and military involvement. Accordingly, the Soviets dealt extensively with the Kuomintang (KMT) party which led the Chinese Republic, and with the KMT's Chinese Communists allies, rivals, and eventual enemies. Soviet Russia also contended directly with Japan. Here the Soviets by the early 1940s successfully managed to deter an all-out war with Japan and to steer the destruction of the conflict away from Russia's borders, thus avoiding a two- front war. Hence, Soviet Russia had framed the impact of World War II. In 1941 the Japanese, in a strategic decision made in terms of winning their war in China, attacked Pearl Harbor and European colonies. The complex result in East Asia was the coincidence of the three wars: the Chinese Civil War, the Second Sino-Japanese War, and the Second World War. That world war, and with it the regional war, would end in 1945 with Japan defeated but the KMT weak. Thereafter the final act of the Chinese Civil War commenced, starting in Manchuria. Here the Soviet-supplied Chinese Communists prevailed, then conquered the south by 1949. Paine argues that, despite massive American military assistance to the nationalist Kuomintang during World War II, it was the Communists who had secured what traditionally was called the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or the legitimacy to rule a unified China at the start of a new era.Paine, The Wars for Asia 1911-1949 (2012), Part II, pp. 107-299: start of \\"long\\" Civil War, pp. 109-121, at 109 (1911 start date), at 111-112 (after Qing dynasty, brief Republic of China), at 114-115 (ideological struggle between nationalists and communists); regional war, pp. 123-169, at 123 (1931 as start date), at 128 (Marco Polo Bridge), at 133-134, 137 (war sparks Chinese nationalism), at 146-147 (Soviet-Japanese battle at Nomonhan in May 1939); global war, pp. 170-220, at 157, 177 (April 1941 Soviet neutrality pact with Japan); civil war final act, pp. 223-270; conclusion, pp. 271-299.

She led a rebellion at Experimental High School which was attached to Beijing Normal University, in Beijing, China. Newspapers reported she took part in the beating of the deputy principal, Bian Zhongyun, to death in August 1966 with a wooden stick, and seriously injuring vice-principal Hu Zhitao. That night, Song Binbin and others reported the cause of Bian Zhongyun's death to Wu De, the second secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China at the Beijing Hotel.The Chinese Cultural Revolution; Remembering Mao's Victims 05/15/2007 Spiegel Bian was the first teacher killed in the Cultural Revolution, and her slaying led to further killings by the Red Guards, and eventually over one million of the Guards gathered in Tiananmen Square, where Binbin famously pinned a red band on Mao Zedong's arm. The scene was captured in a famous photograph, causing the Red August. On August 20, 1966, Guangming Daily published an article signed by Binbin under her pen name Song Yaowu, \\"I Put a Red Armband on Chairman Mao\\", which was reprinted by People's Daily newspaper the next day. Bian Zhongyun At the end of August, Wang Renzhong met Liu Jin and Song Binbin at the Diaoyutai Guesthouse and mobilized them to go to Wuhan to protect the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. Before Liu Jin went, Song Binbin and her classmates went to Wuhan in early September. Soon after, they wrote an article with the keynote of protecting the Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China and handed it to the Provincial Party Committee. Immediately, the local newspaper published an open letter signed under pen name \\"Song Yaowu\\". The content was different from the original article by Song Binbin and others. The wording was stronger to protect the Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. Song Binbin was dissatisfied with this. She asked the person in charge of the provincial party committee and issued a statement through the provincial party committee stating that the open letter was not written by her, but she still did not agree to overthrow the provincial party committee. After returning to Beijing, Song Binbin became a member of the \\"Xiaoyao faction\\", and did not participate in the old Red Guard organizations. In April 1968, Song Binbin and her mother were taken to Shenyang under house arrest. In the early spring of 1969, Song Binbin escaped from Shenyang and came to the pastoral area of Xilingol League in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and then joined the team. In the spring of 1972, at the recommendation of the local herdsmen and the brigade commune, Song Binbin was accepted by a university and then returned due to rumors. According to reports from fellow villagers and educated youths, the teacher in charge of enrollment in Xilingol League admitted Song Binbin under pressure, and Song Binbin entered Changchun Institute of Geology as a Worker-Peasant-Soldier student. In 1975, Song Binbin received a bachelor's degree from Changchun Institute of Geology. Later life After the Cultural Revolution, Binbin was admitted to the Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences as a graduate student, from 1978 to 1980. In 1980, Binbin went to the United States to study. She received a master's degree in geochemistry from Boston University in the United States in 1983. She completed a doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1989. After being naturalized as an U.S citizen, Binbin worked for the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection as an environmental analysis officer from 1989 to 2003. In 2003, she moved back to China, where she served as chairwoman of the British-owned Beijing Cobia System Engineering Co., Ltd. and Beijing Cobia Innovation Technology Development Co., Ltd.Bowed and Remorseful, Former Red Guard Recalls Teacher‚Äôs Death By Chris Buckley, New York Times, http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/13/bowed-and-remorseful-former- red-guard-recalls-teachers-death/ In September 2007, the Experimental High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University (formerly the Women's Affiliated High School of Beijing Normal University) named Song Binbin as one of the 90 \\"honorary alumni\\" when celebrating the 90th anniversary of the school. This matter caused controversy when Wang Jingyao, husband of Bian Zhongyun, protested because he believed that Song Binbin was the main person in charge of the Red Guards in the school during the Cultural Revolution and thus responsible for the death of his wife. Controversy over the death of Bian Zhongyun Song Binbin (center) and others bowing before a bust of Bian Zhongyun (2014) In 1995, Normal University High School for Girls 1968 alumni Wang Youqin published a text in Hong Kong, \\"1966: Students play the teacher's revolution\\", for the first time since August 5, 1966, where Youqin wrote that Binbin and other guards played a role in the death of Bian Zhongyun, are linked to form a casual relationship during those times. In 2003, Carma Hinton, a graduate of Beijing 101 Middle School, directed the Cultural Revolution documentary Morning Sun, which was not officially released in China, but was released in the United States. Song Binbin was interviewed, and for the first time publicly stated that during the Cultural Revolution, she had never participated in violent actions such as beating people, ransacking homes, or destroying the Four Olds. She claimed that The Guangming Daily signed her article without seeking her opinion in advance. Song Binbin denied that the article was written by her, nor did she authorize the reporter to ghostwrite. In 2004, Wang Youqin published another article \\"The Death of Bian Zhongyun\\", where he pointed out that Song Binbin was responsible for the Red Guard violence that led to Bian Zhongyun's death. The evidence was a list of seven people who had pledged to the hospital to rescue Bian Zhongyun at the Beijing Posts and Telecommunications University Hospital in Changping District, saying \\" Six of the seven are Red Guards students. The first name on the list is Song Binbin, a senior in the school and the head of the Red Guards.‚Äù Song Binbin responded to the claims in the article saying that the first name on the list of seven is Li Songwen, a teacher, while her name is ranked last, suggesting that she could not have played a major role in the death of Zhongyun. In 2002, a collection of publications related to sexology seminars, Chinese Femininities, Chinese Masculinities: A Reader, included research articles by American female scholar Emily Honig on the death of Bian Zhongyun. According to Wang Youqin's article, Honig claimed that Song Binbin was responsible for some of the violent activities in the early parts of Cultural Revolution. Apology On January 12, 2014, at a meeting held at High School Attached to Beijing Normal University and was attended by more than 20 students and more than 30 teachers and family members of the alumni, she apologized for the actions of the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.\\"Ex-Red Guard Offers Fresh Cultural Revolution Apology,\\" January 13, 2013, Wall Street Journal https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/01/13/fresh-cultural-revolution- apology/ The apology was met with mixed reactions in China: some people welcomed her words; some people said that these words came too late and are inadequate; others said that the Communist Party of China should apologize for the incidents that happened during those times. Cui Weiping, Beijing Film Academy professor and social critic, said in a telephone interview: > Considering her identity, this is not enough.

After they said that they do > not know who the murderer is, this makes no sense. Wang Youqin said in an interview that Song Binbin and various other Red Guards, in the past decade, have been actively denying persecution and involvement during the Cultural Revolution and mass killings during that time and believes that Song Binbin's responsibility in all the violence in the Women's Affiliated High School should be obvious, due to her position as one of the deputy directors of the school and organizer of the meetings by the school's revolutionary committee. In 2014, Wang Jingyao ssued a statement accusing Song Binbin and others of covering up their evil deeds during the Cultural Revolution. He called their apologies hypocritical and he would not accept their apologies until the truth about their involvement in his wife's death was revealed to the world.

The project area encompasses approximately in Nevada, Placer, and Sierra Counties. Owned by the Nevada Irrigation District, it consists of 16 storage dams plus numerous diversion and regulating dams, and four generating stations producing 425 million kilowatt hours of electricity each year. The Yuba‚ÄìBear Hydroelectric Project consists of the Bowman development, Dutch Flat No. 2 development, Chicago Park development, and Rollins development. History The Yuba‚ÄìBear project was incepted in 1962 when NID voters approved a bond issue to construct the system. Construction began in 1963 and was completed in 1966, at a cost of $65 million ($ in dollars). The Rollins Dam and Bowman power plants were added in the 1980s. The Yuba‚ÄìBear Project introduced additional canals, reservoirs, ability to generate power, and 145,000 acre-feet of water storage to be utilized by residents of the district.  Geomorphology of the region = Geology and soils  The Yuba‚ÄìBear Hydroelectric Project is located within the Sierra Nevada mountain range, which experienced uplift beginning 3 to 5 million years ago, and contains faults resultant of tectonic collision during the late Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. This uplift and tilting of the Sierra Nevada created drainage patterns and channel incisions that shaped the landscape, including the Yuba and Bear rivers. Incision of the modern Yuba River began 5 million years ago, compounded by glacier erosion in the Quaternary period. The bedrock underneath the Yuba‚ÄìBear has a strong effect on the soils in this region. The soils include Mollisols, Inceptisols, Entisols, Alfisols, Andisols, and Ultisols.  Yuba River watershed  The Yuba River creates an incision through metamorphic bedrocks, including Mesozoic igneous rocks (granodiorite), Paleozoic phyllite, and slate from the Shoo Fly and Calaveras Formations. Over time, these channels were filled with Tertiary deposits of gravel, large boulders, and sands that were rich in gold. The Yuba River has been heavily influenced by gold mining activity, with lingering effects such as abandoned mines, residual mercury sequestered in sediment, erosion, and alteration of sediment transport through the river system, with resulting consequences to channel structure. In addition to gold, major minerals of the area include copper, chromium, tungsten, and manganese. In 1994, mining of gravel and sand surpassed gold, with the Feather, Yuba, American, and Bear rivers providing a large amount of alluvial deposits for aggregate mining. The Yuba River has a high level of sediment supply, with a bed-load composed primarily of mining gravel as a result of intense levels of hydraulic mining that occurred in the area.  Bear River watershed  The Bear River displays characteristics of an \\"underfit\\" stream, indicating that it was formed by a larger river that had higher flows. The Bear River is located in a deep V-shaped canyon that suggests not only the work of a larger river, but also glacial advances that carved the topography and created this watershed. The Bear River has been severely impacted by hydraulic mining, and struggles with mercury contaminationleft over from the gold rush. The Bear River originates in the Tahoe National Forest, twenty miles west of the Sierra Nevada crest, and comprises three distinct sections termed the Upper, Middle, and Lower Bear River. The largest water body in the Bear River watershed is Camp Far West Reservoir, which Bear River feeds into before joining with the Feather River south of Yuba City. The Bear River supports popular brown and rainbow trout fisheries, and is popular among fly fishing clubs. Project features The main water sources for the project are the Middle Yuba River, and Canyon Creek (a tributary of the South Yuba River). Jackson Meadows Dam stores water from the Middle Yuba, which is diverted southward through the Milton-Bowman Diversion Conduit into Bowman Lake, an impoundment of Canyon Creek. In addition to Jackson Meadows and Bowman reservoirs, the Yuba‚ÄìBear project derives water from fourteen smaller high elevation Sierra lakes, which have been dammed to increase their size. After passing through Bowman Powerhouse, the water continues south via the Bowman‚ÄìSpaulding Conduit to Lake Spaulding, which is part of the heavily interconnected Drum-Spaulding Hydroelectric Project owned by PG&E.; Lake Spaulding is an impoundment of the South Yuba River, and is an important hub of the system as nearly all the water used by both projects passes through it. Below Lake Spaulding water passes through Drum-Spaulding Project canals through Emigrant Gap into the upper Bear River, where it powers six hydroelectric plants on its long descent to Rollins Reservoir, the lowermost major reservoir of the Yuba‚ÄìBear project. The Yuba‚ÄìBear project operates two of these plants (Dutch Flat No. 2 and Chicago Park), in addition to a smaller powerhouse below Rollins Dam. Together with the Drum-Spaulding Project, the Yuba‚ÄìBear project is considered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to be \\"the most physically and operationally complex hydroelectric project in the United States\\".  Yuba‚ÄìBear Hydroelectric Project  NID was granted the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) license for the Yuba‚ÄìBear project in June, 1963. That license was set to expire and be up for renewal as of April, 2013. The four developments discussed in detail below compose the Yuba‚ÄìBear Project, with a total of 13 mains dams and 207,865 acre-feet of gross combined storage capacity. Accompanying this are 4 powerhouses, 4 water conduits, a 9-mile-long transmission line, appurtenant and recreational facilities. = Bowman development = Faucherie Lake (3,980 ac-ft) Canyon Creek, which feeds from French Lake and into Faucherie before making its way through Sawmill Lake and into Bowman The first installment of the Yuba‚ÄìBear project is the Bowman development. It begins with the Jackson Meadows Dam, which is located 45.6 miles up on the Middle Yuba River from where it joins with the North Yuba River. This includes the Jackson Meadows Dam Spillway and Reservoir. The Jackson Meadows Reservoir is man-made, with a surface area of 1,054 acres, and storage capacity of 69,205 ac-ft. Jackson Meadows Reservoir Recreation Area offers a combined 282 camping sites spread out over eight different campgrounds. Downstream of Jackson Meadows, located 42.2 miles upstream of where the Middle Yuba meets the North Yuba, is the Milton Main Diversion Dam, Milton South Diversion Dam, the Milton Diversion Dam Spillway, and the Milton Diversion Impoundment. The Milton Reservoir has a surface area of 103 acres, and 295 ac-ft of storage capacity. Not to be confused with Jackson Meadows, is Jackson Dam. This is located on Jackson Creek, 2.9 miles upstream from Bowman Lake. Jackson Dam is an earth-filled dam accompanied by the Jackson Dam Spillway and Jackson Dam Lake, which has 58 acres of surface area and 1,330 ac-ft of storage capacity. Jackson Creek Campground has 13 available camping sites. The remaining impoundments contributing to the Bowman Development are on Canyon Creek. The first of these is French Dam, a rockfill dam, followed by French Dam Spillway and French Lake. French Lake has 356 acres of surface area and 13,940 ac-ft storage capacity. Next is Faucherie Dam, Spillway, and Lake, with 143 acres surface area and 3,980 ac-ft storage. Faucherie Lake Recreation Area contains 25 campsites and a day-use area. Sawmill Dam is another rockfill dam, and the last impoundment of Canyon Creek before reaching Bowman Lake. Sawmill Dam Spillway and Lake allow for 3,030 ac-ft storage capacity, and create 79.4 acres of surface area. 356px 337px Bowman Lake is formed on Canyon Creek by Bowman North Dam, and Bowman South Dam and Spillway. Bowman Lake has a surface area of 820 acres, and 68,510 ac-ft of storage capacity. The Bowman Penstock, Powerhouse, Switchyard, and Transmission Line originate here, with the Transmission Line connecting the Bowman Development to the Drum-Spaulding Project run by PG&E.; Bowman Campground has 10 camping sites. 345px = Dutch Flat No. 2 development = Water reaches the Dutch Flat Development by way of the Bowman-Spaulding Conduit. This diverts flow from Canyon Creek below Bowman Lake through 40,501 feet of flumes and canals, and through 16,192 feet of tunnels. Texas Creek Diversion Dam and Fall Creek Diversion Dam also redirect portions of Canyon Creek flow into the Bowman-Spaulding Conduit. The Dutch Flat No. 2 Conduit is a combination of flume, tunnel, siphon, and canal that takes water from PG&E;'s Drum-Spaulding Project (at Drum Afterbay), and channels it into Dutch Flat No. 2 Forebay. The Dutch Flat Forebay Dam is an off-stream earthfilled embankment dam adjacent to the Bear River. The Dutch Flat Forebay Dam Spillway leads to Dutch Flat Forebay, a reservoir adjacent to the Bear River with a surface area of 8 acres and 185 ac-ft storage capacity. The remaining components of the Dutch Flat Development are Dutch Flat No. 2 Powerhouse Penstock, Dutch Flat No. 2 Powerhouse, and Dutch Flat No. 2 Powerhouse Switchyard. = Chicago Park development = Six miles upstream from where the Bear River meets Rollins Reservoir, is the Dutch Flat Afterbay Dam. The Dutch Flat Afterbay Dam Spillway discharges uncontrolled into the Bear River, and contributes to Dutch Flat Afterbay reservoir located on the Bear River. This reservoir has a surface area of 140 acres, and 2,037 ac-ft storage capacity. From here, the Chicago Park Conduit utilizes 21,700 feet of flumes and ditches to transport water to the Chicago Park Forebay Dam, an earthfill dam adjacent to the Bear River. The Chicago Park Forebay Dam Spillway allows water into Chicago Park Forebay, another reservoir adjacent to the Bear River with 7 acres of surface area and 117 ac-ft of storage capacity. The remaining components of this Development are the Chicago Park Powerhouse Penstock, Chicago Park Powerhouse, and the Chicago Park Switchyard. = Rollins development = This Development consists of an embankment dam on the Bear River known as Rollins Dam, Rollins Dam Spillway, and Rollins Reservoir, which has a surface area of 825 acres and 65,989 ac-ft of storage capacity. Rollins Reservoir also offers 332 camping site spread over 4 campgrounds. The Rollins Powerhouse Penstock, Rollins Powerhouse, and Rollins Switchyard complete this project.  Drum‚ÄìSpaulding Project  The Drum-Spaulding Project is heavily intertwined with the Yuba‚ÄìBear project, and is run by PG&E.; The Drum-Spaulding Project is composed of the following: = Upper Drum‚ÄìSpaulding = Drum No. 1 and No. 2 Development, with generation of 105.9 MW. Spaulding No. 1 and No. 2 Development, generating 11.4 MW. Spaulding No. 3 Development with 5.8 MW, Dutch Flat No. 1 Development with generation of 22 MW, and Alta No. 1 Development that is proposed to retire. = Lower Drum = Halsey Development generating 11 MW, Wise Development with 14 MW and Wise No. 2 Development generating 3.2 MW, and Newcastle Development with 11.5 MW. = Deer Creek = Deer Creek development, generating 5.7 MW.  Yuba River Development Project  The Yuba River Development Project is run by the Yuba County Water Agency, and is connected to the Yuba‚ÄìBear Hydroelectric Project. This Development Project includes the New Bullards Bar Reservoiron the North Yuba River, two diversion dams (Our House Diversion Dam on the Middle Yuba, and Log Cabin Diversion on Oregon Creek), three powerhouses (New Colgate, Fish Release, and Narrows No. 2), along with various recreation facilities. The installed capacity of this Project is 361.9 megawatts. Uses At maximum capacity, the project can generate 79.32 megawatts. Power is distributed under contract with Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E;). The project's reservoirs have a gross storage capacity of . In addition to hydroelectric power, the project significantly increases the water flow in the Bear River, the main source of NID's irrigation water supply.

The mesa is a sacred place for the Zuni people, who fled to the mesa top to escape the Coronado expedition in 1540, and it is closed to outside visitors.  History  Dowa Yalanne was settled before European contact. In 1540, Zuni people from the village of Hawikuu fled to the Dowa Yalanne mesa top to escape the attackers of the Coronado expedition. The 14 structures used as a refuge from the Spaniards between 1540 and 1680 were called Heshoda Ayahltona (\\"ancient buildings above\\"). Before the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, the Zuni lived in six different villages. After the revolt, until 1692, they took refuge in a defensible position atop Dowa Yalanne. About 48 Pueblo structures were built between 1680 and 1692 on the top of the mesa, which covers approximately . The population of Dowa Yalanne in 1680 is estimated to have been approximately 2500 people, living in buildings of one and two stories, with over 500 rooms. On November 11, 1692, Don Diego de Vargas climbed to the top of Dowa Yalanne and baptized over 290 people.

Camp Meriwether is the largest of the Cascade Pacific Council's four resident camps in Oregon. During World War II, the camp was closed for two years and served as a US Army outpost until 1943. Since 2015, there has been controversy over the intended development of a golf course over 200 acres of the coastal land.  Early years  Camp Meriwether's Western Half The land upon which Camp Meriwether sits was purchased in 1925 by Scout Executive George \\"Chief Obie\\" Obertueffer of the Portland Area Council. Following a fire and the destruction of the lodge at Camp Chinidere, near Wahtum Lake on Mt. Hood, the council began to look for a new property. Oberteuffer was able to persuade the council to purchase the land from the Chamberlain family for $19,000 (when the operating budget for the council was $26,000). The camp was named for Meriwether Lewis, of the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1804. The camp to the north of Camp Meriwether is Camp Clark, which runs a similar program but for Cub Scouts. The combined camps make the Meriwether-Clark Scout Reservation and over 1,000 acres of land along with two miles of private access beach.  Location and geography  Camp Meriwether is located between Cape Lookout (to the North) and Cape Kiwanda (to the South), along the Oregon Coast near the town of Cloverdale, Oregon. This location between the two capes creates a strong outward current that is also known as a rip current, which can make swimming in the area dangerous. The two miles of coastal beach adjacent to the Meriwether-Clark Scout Reservation can be accessed by hiking from a parking lot near the top of the cape or by walking North from Sand Lake Recreation Area. This makes for one of the most secluded beaches in Oregon. A weekly service project also makes this one of the cleanest beaches during the summer camp season.  Cape Lookout  Cape Lookout is a sharp rocky promontory along the Pacific Ocean coast of northwestern Oregon in the United States. It is located in southwestern Tillamook County, approximately 10 mi (16 km) southwest of Tillamook, just south of Netarts Bay. The promontory extends 1 mi (1.6 km) perpendicular to the coast, and is approximately 0.25 mi (0.5 km) wide at its base, tapering as it extends outward from the coast. Cape Lookout State Park is located on the north side of the promontory, which is part of the Siuslaw National Forest and Camp Meriwether is located to the south. The Cape Lookout Trail is a popular hiking trail, extending 2.5 miles through Sitka spruce forest to the tip of the promontory. The cliff-top viewpoint offers views of Cape Kiwanda and Cascade Head to the south, and Cape Meares and Neahkahnie Mountain to the north. Migrating whales can also be seen, generally from December through June. During World War II, the cape was the location of a notable crash of a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber. There was one survivor (the bombardier), Wilbur L. Perez who died in 2009. A plaque on the cape memorializes the victims of the crash. Information taken from Cape Lookout.  Wells Cove  Named after Kenneth Wells, one of the original staff members at Camp Meriwether and a staff member at Camp Chinidere when the dining hall burnt down in 1925, Wells was one of the first people to discover a small opening at the easternmost face of Cape Lookout that at low tide revealed a small cove that one could walk into and explore. Time and traffic have eroded the trail heading down to Wells Cove but with careful planning and keeping the tides in mind, one can still trek down to the cove. Apart from having a cove named after him, Kenneth Wells is the author of Camp Meriwethers only historical book entitled \\"An early history of Camp Meriwether: With some additional notes about Obie (G. H. Oberteuffer) and the Columbia Pacific Council's early years\\". His memoir of historical events and personal experiences was written in 1986 for 60th anniversary of Camp Meriwether. In the Obie Rangers program (a leadership comprehensive Trail to First Class program at Camp Meriwether) the highest honor a Scout can receive is the \\"Kenneth Wells Award for Individual Excellence\\", which is awarded to Scouts that participated in the program and demonstrated the most leadership and initiative.  Chamberlain Lake  Chamberlain Lake, Camp Meriwether Chamberlain Lake is the small Coastal freshwater lake located on the Camp Meriwether property. It is the largest lake in Cascade Pacific Council and is the home to the waterfront area. In the early years of camp, the lake was home to the S.S.S. Lion, a building on the shore that was made to look like a ship. Complete with masts, pilothouse, and galley, the ship was home to Sea Scout campers who bunked and prepared meals on board. Other locations of importance near Chamberlain Lake include the campfire bowl, which is located on the west face of the lake, and a boat house donated by the Rotary Club in the 1950s. Future activities include a possible mountain biking trail around the lake, fishing, and rugged campsites placed above the lake for outbound adventures.  Sand Lake Recreation Area  The Sand Lake Recreation Area is located along Oregon's North Coast, 15 miles southwest of Tillamook between Cape Lookout and Cape Kiwanda, and is just south of Camp Meriwether. It is a rather large recreational area, covering 1,076 acres of open sand dunes surrounded by forests, and adjacent to Camp Meriwether and the Pacific Ocean. The area is largely used by All Terrain Vehicles and Dune Buggies for off-roading.  Historical events = Military presence at Camp Meriwether  A B-17 bomber, similar to the one that crashed into Cape Lookout From 1942 through 1943 during World War II, Camp Meriwether was shut down as a Boy Scout Camp and used as a United States Army outpost along with a temporary home for the United States Coast Guard. Roads constructed by the National Guard and Coast Guard still function as main roads at Camp Meriwether. Also, there is a distinctive slash through the trees that was cut for telegraph lines and there are turret mounts located at the top of the present day flagpole and parade grounds. Several alumni proclaim that the camp used to have the machine guns that were mounted there but those have since then been lost. These Browning M2 guns may have come from the wreckage noted in the following paragraph, and were located on top of the Big Lodge fireplace mantle piece. The plaque on Cape Lookout in memoriam of the B-17 Plane crash On 1 August 1943 a Boeing B-17F-95-BO Flying Fortress, 42‚Äì30326, c/n 5440, of the 541st Bomb Squadron, 383d Bomb Group, piloted by Roy J. Lee, was headed north up the Oregon coast on a routine patrol flight. The plane had left Pendleton Field, near Pendleton, Oregon, at 0900 and was tasked with flying to Cape Disappointment on the Oregon coast. They were then to fly 500 miles out to sea, followed by a direct flight back to Pendleton Field. On arriving at the coast, the crew found the entire area hidden in overcast clouds that extended to an elevation of 8000 feet. The pilot decided to locate Cape Disappointment by flying below the overcast. The overcast proved to reach almost to the level of the sea. The plane was flying at about 50‚Äì150 feet above the waves. Deciding that the risk was too great the crew began to climb back up into the overcast. Unfortunately, the plane crashed into the side of Cape Lookout at about 900 feet in elevation. The Aviation Archeological Investigation & Research website lists the crash date as 2 August. Parts of the bomber can still be seen today. The lone survivor Wilbur Perez lived for another sixty six years before dying on March 20, 2009 in Escondido, California.  Golf Course Controversy  In late 2015, council executive Matt Devore unveiled Cascade Pacific Council's plans to lease 200 acres of the coastal property for 50 years to Mike Keizer, an internationally renowned golf course developer. The lease is due to a multimillion-dollar maintenance deferral for properties and operating costs of a council that has seen a drop of nearly 25,000 registered youth since 2004, when Camp Meriwether's current dining hall was built. The proposal was met with opposition from conservation groups like the Oregon Coast Alliance and the Oregon Shores Conservation Coalition along with several in the scouting community. Over 4,000 people signed a petition opposing the project on Change.org. As of April 2017, the decision to develop a golf course has been alleviated due to delays in the letter of intent signage, probability of the proposed project moving forward, and additionally the property didn't suit Mike Keizer's vision for the golf course he had in mind.

Koyas are commonly referred to as Koi, Koyalu, Koyollu, KoyaDoralu, Dorala Sattam, etc. Koya tribes can be further divided into Koya, Doli Koya, Gutta Koya or Gotti Koya, Kammara Koya, Musara Koya, Oddi Koya, Pattidi Koya, Rasha Koya, Lingadhari Koya (ordinary), Kottu Koya, Bhine Koya, Raja Koya, etc. Koyas call themselves Koitur in their dialect. The Koyas speak the Koya language, also known as Koya basha, which is a Dravidian language related to Gondi.  Population & Livelihood  The Koya population is concentrated in southeastern Telangana, northern Andhra Pradesh and southwestern Odisha, just south of Bastar. In Telangana they live mainly in Khammam, Bhadradi Kothagudem and Warangal districts and are sparsely found in the old Adilabad and Karimnagar districts. In Andhra Pradesh the Koya mainly live in West Godavari and East Godavari districts, while in Odisha they live almost exclusively and are the dominant tribe in Malkangiri district in the far southwest of the state. The Koya in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana had a population of 590,739 according to the 2011 census. However, many became residents of Andhra Pradesh when their lands became part of Andhra Pradesh during the Polavaram project. There are another 147,137 Koya in Odisha. According to Edgar Thurston, the Koya were formerly armed soldiers in the service of the various palegars in the region, and the time of his writing, practiced podu cultivation. Today the Koya are mainly settled cultivators and artisans, expertise in making bamboo furniture including mats for fencing, dust pans, and baskets. They grow Jowar, Ragi, Bajra and other millets. Tubers and roots such as Tella Chenna Gadda, Kirismatilu and edible green leaves such as Chencheli, Doggali, Gumuru, bacchalakura, gongura, pacchakura, pullakusiru, Thota kura, Boddukura are dietary staples as are curries made from some of these ingredients. Koya practice marriage after maturity, and infant marriage is not practiced. The bride's maternal uncle has the deciding factor in the match, and cross-cousin marriages are permitted and common. Usually a wealthy groom will have no issues in finding a bride, but if they are poor enough, they can bribe the village headman to allow them to capture the bride. In the most simple Koya wedding ceremony, the bride bends her head and the groom leans over her, while water is poured on the husband's head by friends. Once the water has drained off the bride's head, they are said to be man and wife. They then drink milk, eat rice, and walk around a mound of earth organised under a pandal. They then get elders' blessings and go to their new home.  Displacement of tribal communities  The tribal community faces the new threats of development and conflicts, posing a serious questions on its existence and civilization. For instance, the displacement and migration of Gotti koyas tribals taking place in Andhra Pradesh. In the absence of land and access to a forest, the Koyas depend on wage labour in farm lands. The scarcity of these jobs lead to malnutrition of children and instances of anemia in women. The Andhra Pradesh state government proposed Polavaram Project is posing a serious threat of displacement of 170,275 Koyas of the tribal population and more than 276 villages in the Khammam district of Bhadrachalam, Palwancha divisions.

As a trainee lawyer, notary and a district judge he served in Kri≈æevci, Osekovo, Novi Marof and Ludbreg. In 1848 he was elected as a representative in the Croatian Parliament. Nemƒçiƒá's literary opus is described as one of the few that transcended the pragmatic and revivalist function of the Illyrian movement. His first poems were published in Danica ilirska (1839), and until his death he had made a sizeable poetic opus, mostly covering romantic love motifs. These were posthumously assembled in the book Pjesme (\\"Poems\\", 1851). His Putositnice (1845) is a canonical work of Croatian romanticism. It is a travelogue modeled on Laurence Sterne's Sentimental Journey.

Facade and flank of San Domenico History The church structure dates to some time in the mid to late 13th century. Dominican fathers are documented to have preached originally from the small Oratory of the Crucifix (Oratorio del Crocifisso). The latter contains frescoes dating to the 13th century. The church contains work from the 14th and 15th century, including frescoes by Giovanni Cristiani and Antonio Vite. There is no documentation to substantiate the rumors by later art historians including Giorgio Vasari that either the two Dominican order brothers Sisto and Ristoro, architects of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, or that Giovanni Pisano, were at work here. View towards main altar Traces of late 13th century frescoes are found in the convent and church, some attributed possibly to Coppo di Marcovaldo and his son Salerno. The tomb of the jurist Filippo Lazzari (first on right), and of the Blessed Lorenzo da Ripafratta, are attributed to Bernardo and Antonio Rossellino. The church also has the tomb of the bishop Andrea Franchi, who led the White Procession during the plague outbreak of 1399. In 1497, the florentine painter Benozzo Gozzoli died here. The painter Fra Paolino, a Dominican follower of Savonarola painted for this church an Adoration of the Magi and a Holy Conversation. The latter work is now in the church of San Paolo of Pistoia. The cloister has frescoes depicting the Life of San Domenico by Sebastiano Vini. The church also has frescoes depicting the Life of the Magdalen, painted by Ulisse Ciocchi, Michele Cinganelli, and Giovanni Martinelli: all pupils of Bernardino Poccetti. The painter Giovanni Cristiani painted a now detached last judgement for the convent refectory. The convent was suppressed in 1783; Dominicans returned only in 1928.

A number of human rights organizations have criticized the country's rape laws and their enforcement.  Definition  Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration perpetrated against a person without that person's consent. The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent. This can include one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability or is below the legal age of consent. The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault.  Prevalence  Rape in Afghanistan is largely under-reported. In many cases, the victim is punished under Afghan culture, although the Pashtunwali and Islamic law states that the rapist must be punished and not the victim. Violence against women in Afghanistan reached record levels in 2013, according to the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC). Women are respected for their virginity, and even if the woman gets pregnant, it is uncommon for the rapist to marry her. Thus a woman is now punished for being \\"impure\\". The authorities treat such cases as adultery. Even if the woman is not punished, she remains rejected by society as \\"dishonorable\\" (badnaam in Pashto), while the rapist is not considered dishonored.  Afghan law  Afghanistan is currently led by President Ashraf Ghani. Afghanistan does not currently have any laws that directly address and protect rape victims or at risk groups. In the Pashtunwali and Islam, it is illegal to sexually assault someone, including rape and is considered a great sin. In Afghanistan, rape is a crime although Afghanistan passed the Shia Family Law in 2009 under Afghan President Hamid Karzai. The United Nations Development Fund for Women, NATO, Canada, United States, Germany and other nations have come forward expressing concern over the oppressive nature of the law. The Shia Family Law takes away women's rights within a marriage and specifies that Shia women must submit to their husband's demands. It even specifies that they must have sex with their husbands at least once every four days except in the case of illness. The law will only apply to Shia women, which totals around 6 million. The argument in favor of this law is that it is an improvement upon the customary regional law imposed previously. With the support of the conservative and political elite, Afghan courts have taken, and continue to take, action in efforts to remove, lessen, or limit women's rights.  Available statistics and stigma  Rape in Afghanistan is a crime which can be legally prosecuted, but in practice it is very rarely reported, because of the immense risks that women face if they report it. Rape victims in the country face a double risk of being subjected to violence: on one hand they can become victims of honor killings perpetrated by their families, and on the other hand they can be victimized by the laws of the country. Women also undertake many smaller personal risks to their social status and daily life: they can be charged with adultery, a crime that can be punishable by death. Furthermore, they can be forced by their families to marry their rapist which is especially likely if the woman becomes pregnant. Rape victims in Afghanistan are more stigmatized than the rapists. Women who are raped can and are often be punished. While their male counterparts rarely face jail time when accused of rape. Women are often punished as \\"fornicators\\" under the zina, the part of Islamic law that has to do with unlawful sexual intercourse. Women are often persuaded to marry their rapist in hopes of restoring honor to her family. This is also done so the rapist can avoid facing charges. Thus putting women in the, very often dangerous position, of either marrying the man who raped and attacked them or facing honor crimes, possibly murder, at the hands of their own family members. In 2012, Afghanistan recorded 240 cases of honor killings and 160 cases of rape, but the number for both honor killings and rapes is estimated to be much higher and unreported, especially in the more rural areas. In 2013, Afghanistan made international news in regard to the story of a woman who was raped by a man, jailed for adultery, gave birth to a child in jail, and was then subsequently pardoned by Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai, as international interest and outrage grew. And in the end of her whole ordeal, societal pressure and her families pressure she was forced to marry the man who raped her. In 2013, in eastern Ghazni, a man attacked a woman and attempted to rape her, and as a result the relatives of the woman killed both the woman and the man in an honor killing. In Afghanistan, crimes such as adultery, rape and trafficking are often conflated with each other, and it is generally not acceptable for a woman and a man to be alone together (unless married or related), and if this happens the response can be very violent: an Afghan medical doctor and his female patient were attacked by an angry mob who threw stones at them after the two were discovered in his private examining room without a chaperon. Recently, the security forces have been also alleged to rape children in the country.  Soviet invasion of Afghanistan  During the Afghan-Soviet war the Soviet forces abducted Afghan women while flying in the country in search of mujahideen. In November 1980 a number of such incidents had taken place in various parts of the country, including Laghman and Kama. Soviet soldiers as well as KhAD agents kidnapped young women from the city of Kabul and the areas of Darul Aman and Khair Khana, near the Soviet garrisons, to rape them. Women who were taken and raped by Soviet soldiers were considered 'dishonoured' by their families if they returned home.  Afghan Taliban  In 2015, Amnesty International reported that the Afghan Taliban had engaged in mass murder and gang rapes of Afghan civilian women and children in Kunduz. Taliban fighters killed and raped female relatives of police commanders and soldiers. The Taliban also raped and killed midwives who they accused of providing forbidden reproductive health services to women in the city. One female human rights activist described the situation: > When the Taliban asserted their control over Kunduz, they claimed to be > bringing law and order and Shari‚Äôa to the city. But everything they‚Äôve done > has violated both. I don‚Äôt know who can rescue us from this situation. Reactions In 2013, Fereshta Kazemi played the leading role in The Icy Sun, one of the first films to deal openly with rape in Afghanistan. NBC News said that her \\"film breaks new ground for Afghanistan, where victims of rape can be forced to marry their attackers to preserve their families' honor\\".

Background  Pettibone was born on May 26, 1841 in Hartsville, New York. His family moved to Beaver Dam, Wisconsin in 1850. Pettibone attended public schools, and obtained what was described as a \\"partial collegiate education\\" in the Wayland Academy and Lawrence University. During the American Civil War, he enlisted Aug. 15, 1851, in Co. C of the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry of the Union Army. He served as private and second lieutenant, eventually reaching the rank of captain. He took part in most of the engagements in which the regiment participated, and was mustered out of service March 7, 1865. Pettibone returned to Wisconsin, where for a while he tried his hand at schoolteaching and farming. On May 26, 1865, Pettibone married Emily Maria Brown. They had five children.  Newspapers  During the War, Pettibone had published a newspaper for his unit while they were stationed in Cleveland, Tennessee. He began publishing the weekly New London News at New London in 1874; when that failed, he started The Telephone, later the Juneau Telephone, at Mayville in 1877.  Political career  Pettibone had recently purchased the Horicon Reporter in Horicon in 1886 when he was elected for the 13th district of the Senate (Dodge County) as an Independent for a four-year term of office, receiving 4,621 votes, against 3,722 votes for Jacob Beldon (political affiliation unknown), and 337 votes for Prohibitionist 0.

He became sergeant-at-arms of the Senate as of the 1895 session.Casson, Henry, ed. The blue book of the state of Wisconsin 1895 Madison, 1895; p. 186 In 1896, he attempted to return to his old Senate seat, running as a Republican; but lost to Democrat Michael Burke, with 4240 votes to Burke's 4945 and Populist Charles Williams' 170. By 1897, while he was still sergeant-at-arms (and Stanley Pettibone, \\"student\\", was a messenger on his staff), he had sold the Reporter and moved to Oconomowoc, where he and his sons Daniel and Stanley, operating as Pettibone & Pettibone, published the Oconomowoc Republican, which had been the Oconomowoc Democrat until they purchased and renamed it.Casson, Henry, ed. The blue book of the state of Wisconsin 1897 Madison, 1897; pp. 315, 345, 594, 595  After leaving Oconomowoc  He retained his office until the Senate's 1903 session. About that time, the Pettibones sold the Republican and purchased the Watertown Republican, which they operated for two years before selling it. He then moved to Waupun, where he assisted Wilford A. Sanborn, proprietor of the Waupun Leader and husband of Pettibone's daughter Hannah.

She is all decked up and ready to wish him happy wedding anniversary, piano, song and all. The tell-tale white streaks in her hair show that they have been married for a while. She faints as the song ends and you‚Äôve guessed it ‚Äì she is pregnant. But hubby dear is not happy. When she delivers twins, he hates to share her with them. Enter villain Charandas, an old friend of Prosanto who had the twitters for Debi but is out to avenge the stinging slap she gave him before he went to jail. He wants to set up a business. Prosanto writes out a cheque for Rs.3 crore. But Charandas‚Äô intentions are different. He kidnaps the older of the twins but to avoid being caught by the neighbourhood public, dumps the baby into the community dustbin and makes good his escape. Rahmat, the neighbourhood thief, picks up the infant, takes him home and brings him up, without keeping the story of how he found him a secret. Debi suspects that her husband of the kidnap because she finds his wrist-watch on the floor. During a heated argument, she falls off the stairs, loses her sanity and is placed in a mental home. Prosanto is jailed for 14 years and in the meanwhile, the kidnapped twin who has named himself Arjun, grows up to become the modern Robin Hood of the locality, fighting the bad ones for justice. Nandini, Charandas‚Äô beautiful daughter, falls in love with him at first sight when he steps into her marriage mandap and rescues her from marriage to a politician‚Äôs villainous son. Though he does his quota of singing and dancing, he longs for the mother he thinks threw him away and feels a strange pull towards the crazy Debi when Prosanto, out of jail, asks him to help him fight Charandas for revenge. Around this time, the second twin, Akash, flies back home with a degree in psychiatric medicine under his arm. He wants to cure his mother and also falls in love with a fellow-passenger on his way back home. Some more singing and dancing follows while Arjun becomes a trusted aide of Prosanto, each one unaware of the father-son tie they are bound by. With a great deal of action scenes filled with fights, fisticuffs, breaking of ropes and so on, Charandas is defeated in his devious plans of decimating the family he hates, Debi is cured completely, Arjun and Nandini are united, blood ties are reinforced, and you just wait to hear the still photographer say ‚Äòsmile‚Äô for the last group photograph.

Under-reporting of crimes, for example, makes it hard to figure the actual incidence of crimes. Under- reporting is a failure in data reporting. Crime Various estimates have been provided in relation to under-reporting of crimes across the world. According to the American Medical Association (1995), sexual violence, and rape in particular, is considered the most under-reported violent crime. Common reasons for individuals not reporting crime include fear of not being believed, insecurity, and fear of getting into trouble. These reasons are most common for not reporting rape. It is commonly assumed that most of the rape cases go unreported; some estimates go up to or above 90%. (See also Rape reporting.) Non-recognition of domestic violence may lead to under-reporting. Murders are sometimes not reported. Due to the fear of alleged murderer's connection with the other murderer, or because of settlement.

This 26 km ghat section rail road connecting coastal Goa to the hinterlands of Karnataka and other parts. It has three stations en route in the ghats ‚Äì Caranzol, Doodhsagar and Sonaulim. Location The Braganza Ghat section is located on the Goa - Karnataka border in the Western Ghats. It starts from Castle rock in Karnataka and ends up at Kulem in Goa. Prior to the Konkan Railways this was the only way one could have reached Goa via rail. Stations The 26 km section of ghats starts at Castle Rock in Karnataka and ends at Kulem in Goa and has 3 stations en route - Caranzol, Doodhsagar and Sonalium. Both the uphill as well as the downhill trains have commercial halts at Castle Rock and Kulem which also serve as the stations for attachment and detachment of brakes. But, the trains do not have commercial halts at the three en route stations. While descending the ghats, a train - whether passenger or freight - has to stop at all the 3 stations for mandatory brake tests; whereas, the uphill trains are not required to halt unless there is a crossing. Tourist attraction Its fame is mostly derived from the waterfalls which slide down gracefully in its midst, somewhere in the middle of the ghat with the name Dudhsagar Falls or Sea of Milk.It is one of the most beautiful falls in all of india. The speciality of this location is it is only connected by the railroad. The panorama offer high waterfall as a backdrop to the trains passing right in front of it. Train movement The route earlier belonged to the South Central Railway zone of the Indian Railways but after the formation of South Western Railways. In 2003 it came under the Hubli division of South Western Railways. Tens of thousands of tons of freight move up and down the ghat section. The Braganza Ghat Section is one of the toughest ghat sections in Indian Railways. The ruling gradient here is 1 in 37 which requires the use of bankers. Earlier the Gooty shed's WDM-3A and WDG-3A class locomotives were used and now the WDG-4 locomotives. Hubli is the nearest loco shed has almost 250 of these locos. There are quite a few passenger trains plying this section. Freight consists mostly of iron ore being transported from the interior regions of Karnataka to the ports for export. In return the rakes bring in coal, fertilizers and the like.

Computer programs may manage their own resources by using features exposed by programming languages ( is a survey article contrasting different approaches), or may elect to manage them by a host ‚Äì an operating system or virtual machine ‚Äì or another program. Host- based management is known as resource tracking, and consists of cleaning up resource leaks: terminating access to resources that have been acquired but not released after use. This is known as reclaiming resources, and is analogous to garbage collection for memory. On many systems the operating system reclaims resources after the process makes the exit system call. Controlling access The omission of releasing a resource when a program has finished using it is known as a resource leak, and is an issue in sequential computing. Multiple processes wish to access a limited resource can be an issue in concurrent computing, and is known as resource contention. Resource management seeks to control access in order to prevent both of these situations. Resource leak Formally, resource management (preventing resource leaks) consists of ensuring that a resource is released if and only if it is successfully acquired. This general problem can be abstracted as \\"before, body, and after\\" code, which normally are executed in this order, with the condition that the after code is called if and only if the before code successfully completes, regardless of whether the body code executes successfully or not. This is also known as execute around or a code sandwich, and occurs in various other contexts, such as a temporary change of program state, or tracing entry and exit into a subroutine. However, resource management is the most commonly cited application. In aspect-oriented programming, such execute around logic is a form of advice. In the terminology of control flow analysis, resource release must postdominate successful resource acquisition; failure to ensure this is a bug, and a code path that violates this condition causes a resource leak. Resource leaks are often minor problems, generally not crashing the program, but instead causing some slowdown to the program or the overall system. However, they may cause crashes ‚Äì either the program itself or other programs ‚Äì due to resource exhaustion: if the system runs out of resources, acquisition requests fail. This can present a security bug if an attack can cause resource exhaustion. Resource leaks may happen under regular program flow ‚Äì such as simply forgetting to release a resource ‚Äì or only in exceptional circumstances, such as when a resource is not released if there is an exception in another part of the program. Resource leaks are very frequently caused by early exit from a subroutine, either by a \`return\` statement, or an exception raised either by the subroutine itself, or a deeper subroutine that it calls. While resource release due to return statements can be handled by carefully releasing within the subroutine before the return, exceptions cannot be handled without some additional language facility that guarantees that release code is executed. More subtly, successful resource acquisition must dominate resource release, as otherwise the code will try to release a resource it has not acquired. The consequences of such an incorrect release range from being silently ignored to crashing the program or unpredictable behavior. These bugs generally manifest rarely, as they require resource allocation to first fail, which is generally an exceptional case. Further, the consequences may not be serious, as the program may already be crashing due to failure to acquire an essential resource. However, these can prevent recovery from the failure, or turn an orderly shutdown into a disorderly shutdown. This condition is generally ensured by first checking that the resource was successfully acquired before releasing it, either by having a boolean variable to record \\"successfully acquired\\" ‚Äì which lacks atomicity if the resource is acquired but the flag variable fails to be updated, or conversely ‚Äì or by the handle to the resource being a nullable type, where \\"null\\" indicates \\"not successfully acquired\\", which ensures atomicity. Resource contention=Memory management Memory can be treated as a resource, but memory management is usually considered separately, primarily because memory allocation and deallocation is significantly more frequent than acquisition and release of other resources, such as file handles. Memory managed by an external system has similarities to both (internal) memory management (since it is memory) and resource management (since it is managed by an external system). Examples include memory managed via native code and used from Java (via Java Native Interface); and objects in the Document Object Model (DOM), used from JavaScript. In both these cases, the memory manager (garbage collector) of the runtime environment (virtual machine) is unable to manage the external memory (there is no shared memory management), and thus the external memory is treated as a resource, and managed analogously. However, cycles between systems (JavaScript referring to the DOM, referring back to JavaScript) can make management difficult or impossible. Lexical management and explicit management A key distinction in resource management within a program is between lexical management and explicit management ‚Äì whether a resource can be handled as having a lexical scope, such as a stack variable (lifetime is restricted to a single lexical scope, being acquired on entry to or within a particular scope, and released when execution exits that scope), or whether a resource must be explicitly allocated and released, such as a resource acquired within a function and then returned from it, which must then be released outside of the acquiring function. Lexical management, when applicable, allows a better separation of concerns and is less error-prone. Basic techniques The basic approach to resource management is to acquire a resource, do something with it, then release it, yielding code of the form (illustrated with opening a file in Python): f = open(filename) ... f.close() This is correct if the intervening \`...\` code does not contain an early exit (\`return\`), the language does not have exceptions, and \`open\` is guaranteed to succeed. However, it causes a resource leak if there is a return or exception, and causes an incorrect release of unacquired resource if \`open\` can fail. There are two more fundamental problems: the acquisition-release pair is not adjacent (the release code must be written far from the acquisition code), and resource management is not encapsulated ‚Äì the programmer must manually ensure that they are always paired. In combination, these mean that acquisition and release must be explicitly paired, but cannot be placed together, thus making it easy for these to not be paired correctly. The resource leak can be resolved in languages that support a \`finally\` construction (like Python) by placing the body in a \`try\` clause, and the release in a \`finally\` clause: f = open(filename) try: ... finally: f.close() This ensures correct release even if there is a return within the body or an exception thrown. Further, note that the acquisition occurs before the \`try\` clause, ensuring that the \`finally\` clause is only executed if the \`open\` code succeeds (without throwing an exception), assuming that \\"no exception\\" means \\"success\\" (as is the case for \`open\` in Python). If resource acquisition can fail without throwing an exception, such as by returning a form of \`null\`, it must also be checked before release, such as: f = open(filename) try: ... finally: if f: f.close() While this ensures correct resource management, it fails to provide adjacency or encapsulation. In many languages there are mechanisms that provide encapsulation, such as the \`with\` statement in Python: with open(filename) as f: ... The above techniques ‚Äì unwind protection (\`finally\`) and some form of encapsulation ‚Äì are the most common approach to resource management, found in various forms in C#, Common Lisp, Java, Python, Ruby, Scheme, and Smalltalk, among others; they date to the late 1970s in the NIL dialect of Lisp; see . There are many variations in the implementation, and there are also significantly different approaches.  Approaches = Unwind protection  The most common approach to resource management across languages is to use unwind protection, which is called when execution exits a scope ‚Äì by execution running off the end of the block, returning from within the block, or an exception being thrown. This works for stack-managed resources, and is implemented in many languages, including C#, Common Lisp, Java, Python, Ruby, and Scheme. The main problems with this approach is that the release code (most commonly in a \`finally\` clause) may be very distant from the acquisition code (it lacks adjacency), and that the acquisition and release code must always be paired by the caller (it lacks encapsulation). These can be remedied either functionally, by using closures/callbacks/coroutines (Common Lisp, Ruby, Scheme), or by using an object that handles both the acquisition and release, and adding a language construct to call these methods when control enters and exits a scope (C# \`using\`, Java \`try\`-with-resources, Python \`with\`); see below. An alternative, more imperative approach, is to write asynchronous code in direct style: acquire a resource, and then in the next line have a deferred release, which is called when the scope is exited ‚Äì synchronous acquisition followed by asynchronous release. This originated in C++ as the ScopeGuard class, by Andrei Alexandrescu and Petru Marginean in 2000, \\"Generic: Change the Way You Write Exception-Safe Code ‚Äî Forever\\", by Andrei Alexandrescu and Petru Marginean, December 01, 2000, Dr. Dobb's with improvements by Joshua Lehrer,ScopeGuard 2.0, Joshua Lehrer and has direct language support in D via the \`scope\` keyword (ScopeGuardStatement), where it is one approach to exception safety, in addition to RAII (see below).D: Exception Safety It has also been included in Go, as the \`defer\` statement.Defer, Panic, and Recover, Andrew Gerrand, The Go Blog, 4 August 2010 This approach lacks encapsulation ‚Äì one must explicitly match acquisition and release ‚Äì but avoids having to create an object for each resource (code-wise, avoid writing a class for each type of resource).  Object-oriented programming  In object-oriented programming, resources are encapsulated within objects that use them, such as a \`file\` object having a field whose value is a file descriptor (or more general file handle). This allows the object to use and manage the resource without users of the object needing to do so. However, there is a wide variety of ways that objects and resources can be related. Firstly, there is the question of ownership: does an object have a resource? * Objects can own resources (via object composition, a strong \\"has a\\" relationship). * Objects can view resources (via object aggregation, a weak \\"has a\\" relationship). * Objects can communicate with other objects that have resources (via Association). Objects that have a resource can acquire and release it in different ways, at different points during the object lifetime; these occur in pairs, but in practice they are often not used symmetrically (see below): * Acquire/release while the object is valid, via (instance) methods such as \`open\` or \`dispose\`. * Acquire/release during object creation/destruction (in the initializer and finalizer). * Neither acquire nor release the resource, instead simply having a view or reference to a resource managed externally to the object, as in dependency injection; concretely, an object that has a resource (or can communicate with one that does) is passed in as an argument to a method or constructor. Most common is to acquire a resource during object creation, and then explicitly release it via an instance method, commonly called \`dispose\`. This is analogous to traditional file management (acquire during \`open\`, release by explicit \`close\`), and is known as the dispose pattern. This is the basic approach used in several major modern object- oriented languages, including Java, C# and Python, and these languages have additional constructs to automate resource management. However, even in these languages, more complex object relationships result in more complex resource management, as discussed below. = RAII = A natural approach is to make holding a resource be a class invariant: resources are acquired during object creation (specifically initialization), and released during object destruction (specifically finalization). This is known as Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII), and ties resource management to object lifetime, ensuring that live objects have all necessary resources. Other approaches do not make holding the resource a class invariant, and thus objects may not have necessary resources (because they've not been acquired yet, have already been released, or are being managed externally), resulting in errors such as trying to read from a closed file. This approach ties resource management to memory management (specifically object management), so if there are no memory leaks (no object leaks), there are no resource leaks. RAII works naturally for heap- managed resources, not only stack-managed resources, and is composable: resources held by objects in arbitrarily complicated relationships (a complicated object graph) are released transparently simply by object destruction (so long as this is done properly!). RAII is the standard resource management approach in C++, but is little-used outside C++, despite its appeal, because it works poorly with modern automatic memory management, specifically tracing garbage collection: RAII ties resource management to memory management, but these have significant differences. Firstly, because resources are expensive, it is desirable to release them promptly, so objects holding resources should be destroyed as soon as they become garbage (are no longer in use). Object destruction is prompt in deterministic memory management, such as in C++ (stack-allocated objects are destroyed on stack unwind, heap-allocated objects are destroyed manually via calling \`delete\` or automatically using \`unique_ptr\`) or in deterministic reference-counting (where objects are destroyed immediately when their reference count falls to 0), and thus RAII works well in these situations. However, most modern automatic memory management is non-deterministic, making no guarantees that objects will be destroyed promptly or even at all! This is because it is cheaper to leave some garbage allocated than to precisely collect each object immediately on its becoming garbage. Secondly, releasing resources during object destruction means that an object must have a finalizer (in deterministic memory management known as a destructor) ‚Äì the object cannot simply be deallocated ‚Äì which significantly complicates and slows garbage collection. = Complex relationships = When multiple objects rely on a single resource, resource management can be complicated. A fundamental question is whether a \\"has a\\" relationship is one of owning another object (object composition), or viewing another object (object aggregation). A common case is when one two objects are chained, as in pipe and filter pattern, the delegation pattern, the decorator pattern, or the adapter pattern. If the second object (which is not used directly) holds a resource, is the first object (which is used directly) responsible for managing the resource? This is generally answered identically to whether the first object owns the second object: if so, then the owning object is also responsible for resource management (\\"having a resource\\" is transitive), while if not, then it is not. Further, a single object may \\"have\\" several other objects, owning some and viewing others. Both cases are commonly found, and conventions differ. Having objects that use resources indirectly be responsible for the resource (composition) provides encapsulation (one only needs the object that clients use, without separate objects for the resources), but results in considerable complexity, particularly when a resource is shared by multiple objects or objects have complex relationships. If only the object that directly uses the resource is responsible for the resource (aggregation), relationships between other objects that use the resources can be ignored, but there is no encapsulation (beyond the directly using object): the resource must be managed directly, and might not be available to the indirectly using object (if it has been released separately). Implementation-wise, in object composition, if using the dispose pattern, the owning object thus will also have a \`dispose\` method, which in turn calls the \`dispose\` methods of owned objects that must be disposed; in RAII this is handled automatically (so long as owned objects are themselves automatically destroyed: in C++ if they are a value or a \`unique_ptr\`, but not a raw pointer: see pointer ownership). In object aggregation, nothing needs to be done by the viewing object, as it is not responsible for the resource. Both are commonly found. For example, in the Java Class Library, \`Reader#close()\` closes the underlying stream, and these can be chained. For example, a \`BufferedReader\` may contain a \`InputStreamReader\`, which in turn contains a \`FileInputStream\`, and calling \`close\` on the \`BufferedReader\` in turn closes the \`InputStreamReader\`, which in turn closes the \`FileInputStream\`, which in turn releases the system file resource. Indeed, the object that directly uses the resource can even be anonymous, thanks to encapsulation: try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(fileName)))) { // Use reader. } // reader is closed when the try-with-resources block is exited, which closes each of the contained objects in sequence. However, it is also possible to manage only the object that directly uses the resource, and not use resource management on wrapper objects: try (FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream(fileName)))) { BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(stream)); // Use reader. } // stream is closed when the try- with-resources block is exited. // reader is no longer usable after stream is closed, but so long as it does not escape the block, this is not a problem. By contrast, in Python, a csv.reader does not own the \`file\` that it is reading, so there is no need (and it is not possible) to close the reader, and instead the \`file\` itself must be closed.Python: No csv.close()? with open(filename) as f: r = csv.reader(f) # Use r. # f is closed when the with- statement is exited, and can no longer be used. # Nothing is done to r, but the underlying f is closed, so r cannot be used either. In .NET, convention is to only have direct user of resources be responsible: \\"You should implement IDisposable only if your type uses unmanaged resources directly.\\" In case of a more complicated object graph, such as multiple objects sharing a resource, or cycles between objects that hold resources, proper resource management can be quite complicated, and exactly the same issues arise as in object finalization (via destructors or finalizers); for example, the lapsed listener problem can occur and cause resource leaks if using the observer pattern (and observers hold resources). Various mechanisms exist to allow greater control of resource management. For example, in the Google Closure Library, the \`goog.Disposable\` class provides a \`registerDisposable\` method to register other objects to be disposed with this object, together with various lower-level instance and class methods to manage disposal.  Structured programming  In structured programming, stack resource management is done simply by nesting code sufficiently to handle all cases. This requires only a single return at the end of the code, and can result in heavily nested code if many resources must be acquired, which is considered an anti-pattern by some ‚Äì the Arrow Anti Pattern,Flattening Arrow Code, Jeff Atwood, 10 Jan 2006 due to the triangular shape from the successive nesting.  Cleanup clause  One other approach, which allows early return but consolidates cleanup in one place, is to have a single exit return of a function, preceded by cleanup code, and to use goto to jump to the cleanup before exit. This is infrequently seen in modern code, but occurs in some uses of C.

Initially the Regent of Jember, Abdul Kahar Muzakir, intended to use it for his family's personal recreation. However, after receiving input from friends and acquaintances, he ultimately decided to make the garden open to the public. The garden was formally established on 24 February 2007. The garden had an average of 50 visitors daily in 2011, with numbers increasing to 200 on the weekends. By December 2012 that average had increased to 300 visitors daily, with 1,000 visitors per day visiting during the Christmas holidays. During that holiday the garden was one of Jember's most popular tourist attractions, together with Papuma Beach and Rembangan.

A contemporary luxury brand for sophisticated, independent thinkers, Valextra produces design-inspired leather goods combining craftsmanship and innovation with a timeless style. Rooted in a quintessential Milanese heritage, Valextra‚Äôs clean, no-logo aesthetic has redefined modern chic. The name is a portmanteau of \\"valigia\\", the Italian word for suitcase, and \\"extra\\" . History= Foundation and early years  The Valextra brand was founded in 1937 by Giovanni Fontana in Milan's Piazza San Babila. This location reflected the brand‚Äôs clientele: sophisticated women who were involved in the city‚Äôs cultural life and knowledgeable about European avant- garde movements. From the beginning, Valextra specialised in creating luggage, handbags and accessories from exotic hides such as alligator, hippopotamus and elephant skins. Fontana traveled to Paris twice a year, looking for inspiration in the fashion capital. He then translated these influences into a modern idea of beauty, which mixed aesthetics and functionality. He set up a workshop above the shop, where he worked with a model-maker to bring his concepts to life. In its first few decades, the company licensed over 100 patents and won a Compasso D‚ÄôOro for the 24 Ore bag, at the award‚Äôs inaugural edition in 1954 .  Brand Evolution  During the rich postwar period, Valextra started catering for entrepreneurs and international jet-setters. This coincided with the introduction of Fontana‚Äôs son, Tito, into the company. Together with his son Stefano, Tito introduces a new, design-led direction for the company . The pair introduced several innovations between 1963 and 1972, when the company also released two new inventions with the modern man in mind: AG Fronzoni‚Äôs Forma 0, Valextra‚Äôs first rigid suitcase, and the Premier suitcase, which was gifted to Milan‚Äôs mayor Aldo Aniasi . This is also when the Small Leather Goods line was properly developed: small, pocket-sized objects designed to easily manage cash and the newly-popular credit cards, to be lightweight and easy to carry for travel and whose quality was reflected both in the choice of materials and in the product design itself. Over the decades, Valextra has continued to follow its founder‚Äôs belief in craftsmanship, in the past few years also strengthening its design-led aesthetic with special collaborations that expanded the company‚Äôs vision .  Acquisitions  In 2000, the company was purchased by Emanuele Carminati Molina who served as its President until 2013. In 2013, private equity firm Neo Capital bought 60% of Valextra . Between 2013 and 2014 Marco Franchini was CEO, and the role was passed to Alessandra Bettari who served as CEO until May 2015 . Since May 2015, the company‚Äôs CEO has been Sara Ferrero . Production Each Valextra piece is hand-made in Italy by a team of master craftsmen . Most of its pieces are crafted from soft-grained Martellato calfskin or the newer smooth Parigi leather (a smooth, semi-matte material), and lined in velvety suede. Almost every bag is produced with white leather lining on the inside. The collections include a vast palette of neutral as well as bright colours. Each piece is characterised by distinctive details such as the hand-finished black Costa lacquered edge, engineered closures, metallic details. A logo and unique serial number embossed inside the bag, and a monogramming service is available upon request. Each bag bears the individual artisan number of the craftsperson who oversaw its creation. Since its beginning Valextra's designs have been modernist and un-ornamented, and aesthetically minimalist and discreet. Lightweight, graphic and essential, silhouettes derive from the brand‚Äôs design-led aesthetic. Valextra conveys an ideal of absolute and lasting beauty, devised in every detail as a complex architecture. Every component is cut and assembled through specialised engineering and technicality, modelling geometrical contours, folding constructions, asymmetrical frames and sharp angles. Valextra does not make logo-pattern products, the logo is kept exclusively on the inside of their pieces. Several of the items first made by the company in 1937 are still in production; while cleaning and repairs are provided for life. The company also offers a service to create custom luggage and handbags to the customer's specification . The brand operates based on values of culture, beauty, quality and innovation. Stores= Via Manzoni, Milan  The company‚Äôs flagship store in Milan‚Äôs via Manzoni is inside an 1850s palazzo that also houses the company‚Äôs head offices. The store sells the company‚Äôs bags, small leather goods and travel accessories for men and women.  International stores  Valextra operates stores worldwide. Valextra is present with flagship stores in Mainland China (Chengdu, Shanghai, Beijing), Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan. It also operates flagship locations in department stores in the USA and Asia.  Design projects  CEO Sara Ferrero has been commissioning international architects, artists and designers to work on projects that re- invent the aesthetics of Valextra stores. Since 2015, the Milanese flagship store was reinterpreted through pop-up installations designed by the most celebrated international designers and architects. Every year, the Via Manzoni store gets a pop-up facelift by an international creative, and past collaborators of the brand include John Pawson , Kengo Kuma , Michael Anastassiades, Snarkitecture and more. Ferrero also commissions designers and architects to work on both temporary and permanent projects for international stores and in-store corners, with previous projects by Neri & Hu , Shingo Masuda , Atelier Biagetti , Max Lamb , Martino Gamper and Aranda Lasch among others. Key products Some of the company‚Äôs key products include: Iside: Launched for the first time in 2011, with its distinctive pyramidal shape, the Iside is one of the highest successes of the brand. An eclectic and feminine bag which can be carried as a top handle or worn more casually as a cross body, it is available in four different sizes (micro, mini, medium and large), two different clutches and two cross-body bags, one backpack and one travel bag . Brera: a piece from the 1950s, the Brera is an everyday bag featuring the distinctive Pignone fastening, developed in Valextra workshop in Piazza San Babila. Brera has grown into a collection which includes a top handle style, available in two sizes (medium and large), a shoulder bag, a soft tote, a cross-body bag, purses and accessories . Passepartout: considered by Valextra the most versatile bag of its collection, the Passepartout is a large bag that can be carried as a handbag, as a tote or as a duffle bag, with a front pocket that detaches and doubles as an evening clutch. It is available in three sizes (maxi, medium and mini) . Tric Trac: a patented design from 1967, its modern silhouette takes cues from a camera case. The bag was named after the original geometric snap closure, whose ingenious design takes advantage of the natural stiffness of the leather. It is still one of the company‚Äôs best sellers thanks to its modern form, available in two models. The Tric Trac features a small handle and a zipper compartment that can be used as an on-the-go notebook, or become a mirror case in the bag‚Äôs more feminine version . Serie S: it was launched launched for the first time in 1961 and given a patent for its innovative approach to shape. Valextra relaunched this piece in 2019 with an updated design , and also collaborated with designer Michael Anastassiades on a special version . Small Leather Goods: the collection includes purses, wallets, coin purses, card cases, glasses cases, key holders . Travel: faithful to its name, the company still produces a vast range of travel goods. The collection includes the rigid Costa suitcase, two trolleys as well as a series of travel bags and accessories .  Celebrity customers  From the 1940s through 1970s, Valextra handbags and luggage were frequently purchased by celebrities and wealthy clients. Among them were Gianni Agnelli, Grace Kelly, Aristotle and Jacqueline Onassis, Maria Callas . In November 2019, Jennifer Aniston selected Valextra accessories for her highly anticipated TV series, This Morning Show . Today, Valextra bags are regularly sported by celebrities such as Priyanka Chopra, Reese Witherspoon, Sharon Stone and Anne Hathaway.
